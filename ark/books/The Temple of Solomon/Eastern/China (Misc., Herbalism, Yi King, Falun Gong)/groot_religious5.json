V 6 P A R T I I DEMONOLOGY @ p.465 At the commencement of this Part, devoted to a description of the Chinese world of spectres, devils or demons, it is necessary to repeat what has been said in Ch. XV of Part I on the fundamental conceptions about those beings. We saw there, that though every shen and kwei may work both good and evil, yet the special function of the kwei, in their quality of particles of the Yin, or that Breath of the Universe which is identified with darkness, cold, death and destruction, is to act as maleficent spirits, and as rewarders of good and punishers of evil under the supreme control of Heaven. We have further seen there, that many of them are ghosts of the dead, and therefore possess human attributes, and that they appear to the living under a great variety of circumstances, keeping up friendly or unfriendly intercourse with them. Finally, Chapter XVI of Part I has showed us, that such human spectres exercise retributive justice on those who harmed them during their life. We have now to sketch in a series of chapters the prominent part which the demon-world plays in the mind and religion of the Chinese people, and the widespread customs which have arisen therefrom in their domestic and social life. In fulfilling this task, we shall steadfastly pursue the same path we have hitherto followed in this work, and treat the subject historically ; that is to say, we shall continually look into the past for light upon notions and customs still extant or already obsolete, and thus trace out their antiquity and development. This method will also have the advantage of bringing out in strong relief the great fact, which always forces itself prominently upon the notice of every serious student of the Chinese nation : that its present in almost every respect is its past, and its past its present. Though we mostly find, from the earliest times, maleficent spirits p.466 denoted in literature by the character kwei, and occasionally by shen, still other written names for them exist ; but they are actually obsolete, or"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 7 nearly so, and we do not find them used in writings of the past and the present except as a pedantic display of learning. As such we have or ki, only mentioned by Liu Ngan, who wrote : « The people of King have their kwei, and those of Yueh their ki (101). The Shwoh wen gives us the term hü, attesting that it means ‘a destructive, evil spectre’ (102), and the Khanghi Dictionary has the following series : sih ; ling ; soh ; or ch’e ; yun ; luh ; , or , yiu ; kiang ; wei ; and furthermore, ch‘iao, a slightly mischievous spectre ; teng, a spectre in the air ; kuh, a headless spectre ; kih, a rain-spectre ; and lei, a thunder-spectre. Probably most of these rare characters are written forms of local terms, either formerly in use, or still employed here or there. None of them occurs in the Classics. Much oftener we find in the books the terms mo, and ya-ch‘a, as transcriptions of the Indian terms Māra and Yaksha, imported by Buddhism. They need not occupy us until we treat of this religion. There exists few special terms for certain classes of spectres, which we shall duly mention in speaking of those classes. Likewise, the influences which spectres exercise in the world of men, or the effects thereof, are denoted by special terms. In the first place we have one which means pernicious or baleful in general, viz. hiung. We have seen on page 416 that Wang Ch‘ung used this word in this sense as early as the first century of our era. It stands as the opposite of kih, felicity, which the shen or good spirits and gods bestow, especially in requital of sacrifices offered to them. Another common term expressive of the harmful influences of spectres, is yao, with which the reader has made acquaintance on page 430. But no word of the same meaning is used with so much frequency as sié. To understand this word, the reader has to recall to mind what he learned in this work as the great fundamental tenet of China’s Cosmology, Philosophy,"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 8 Psychology and Theology, namely that the shen constitute the Yang and the kwei the Yin., and that, p.467 whereas the Yang and the Yin constitute the Tao or Course of Nature, the shen and the kwei are the forces by which the Tao operates. Further we have to realize the doctrine that the Tao represents all that is ‘correct, normal, or right’ in the Universe, that is to say, ching or twan, including all correct and righteous dealings of men and spirits, which alone eminently, nay exclusively, promote universal happiness and life. All other acts, as they oppose the Tao, are puh ching or puh twan , ‘abnormal, incorrect’, or, as it is specially expressed, sié or yin. Yin essentially means overflowing as water, excessive, surpassing due limits, and therefore comprises also the sense of evil in general ; which is also the case with sié. Both words occur in the Classics, and therefore are of a great age. It is clear that both among men and spectres there may be such anti-natural actions which are sié or yin. They are all detrimental to the good of the world, destroy the prosperity and peace which are the highest good of man, and, as a consequence, all good, beneficial government ; they may thus endanger the world and the Throne. If they proceed from men, they ought to be combated by everybody, and eradicated ; it is the natural duty of right-minded, orthodox rulers and statesmen to persecute such heresies, and even the thoughts and sayings which produce them, the more so as they may be detrimental to virtue and morality, without which humanity cannot possibly prosper, nor durably exist. And when such actions proceed from spirits, a defensive war should be waged against them by man, with or without the help of his good spirits and gods ; they should be combated, repulsed, driven away and exorcised, if possible annihilated, by artful expedients. Man in the course of time has contrived quite an abundance of these ; properly speaking that warfare never pauses, and is carried on quite systematically every day throughout the empire. We shall have to devote the fourth Part of this Book to its description. The sié then are, as the Chinese themselves explain it, ‘abnormal, incorrect breaths or influences’, or , ‘spectral influences’. They are,"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 9 of course, also called puh tao or ‘not tao’, that is to say, not in harmony with the correct course or laws of Nature. We need hardly add, that whereas the word sié always suggests spectres, it actually has got the meaning of ‘spectre’ or ‘spectral’. The work of spirits is also called sui. This character seems p.468 to mean what is produced or emitted () by spiritual manifestation () ; indeed, the learned Yen Shi-ku attests this in his commentary on the Books of the Early Han Dynasty, as he says : « That graphic sign is composed of and , the latter component indicating that sui means that by which the kwei and the shen manifest themselves to man (103). It is a character of respectable age, as it occurs in the Tso ch‘wen. Finally we have to mention the terms sheng , and ts’ai , which we may translate by calamities inflicted by nature. These too are very old. They occur in the Canon of Shun, one of the oldest parts of the Shu king. There we find the phrase : « he pardoned (his officials) if calamities (not caused by them) occurred ; but if they offended presumptuously and persistently, he punished them with the death of rebels. In another section of the Shu king, which is a kind of instruction given to a prince on his investiture with a feudal state, we read : « If men are responsible for slight evil which is not caused by calamities (sheng), but merely by their persistent doings and their voluntary acts, unlawfully, purposely — although that evil for which they are responsible be small, you may not but put them to death. And when men have to answer for great evil which is not caused by their persistent doings, but only by calamities (sheng and ts‘ai), or accidentally, if they make a complete confession of their guilt, you may not put them to death (104)."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 10 The same Classic also mentions sometimes ‘heavenly calamities’, or calamities sent down () by Heaven, which no doubt means calamities inflicted by this supreme natural power through the agency of its spectres. Ts‘ai and sheng also occur in the Yih king in the same sense, and ts‘ai, besides, in some other Classics 1. p.469 We need, of course, hardly add that yet other terms expressing misfortune are used to denote the work of spectres. Nor need we state that the spectres and their baleful work are regularly confounded together and, as a consequence, most of the terms given above virtually occur as denominations for the spectres themselves. This is more particularly the case with yao, sié, sui, and sheng. Imagination has even created a special category of spectres, called hoh sheng or Black Calamities, of which we shall speak in Chapter XIII. @  1 Sheng is also considered to have in classical and other pre-Christian literature the meaning of offences committed involuntarily or inadvertently. "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 11 CHAPTER I On the Omnipresence and Multitude of Spectres @ p.470 The dogma, prevailing in China from the earliest times, that the Universe is filled in all its parts with shen and kwei, naturally implies that devils and demons must also swarm about the homes of men in numbers inestimable. It is, in fact, an axiom which constantly comes out in conversing with the people, that they haunt every frequented and lonely spot, and that no place exists where man is safe from them. Even the privy is not respected, and the numerous narratives, transmitted by books and by word of mouth about people frightened, maltreated and killed there, point explicitly to a tendency of spectres to select preferably for their cruel and malign exploits those malodorous spots, where man is so lonely and helpless. Public roads are infested and haunted by them everywhere, especially during the night, when the power of the yin part of Nature, to which spectres belong especially, is strongest. Numerous, in fact, are the tales of wretches who, having been accosted by such natural foes of man, were found dead on the roadside without the slightest wound or injury being visible : their souls had simply been snatched out of them. Many victims of such encounters could find their way home, but merely to die miserably there shortly after. Others, hit by devilish arrows, got boils or tumors which carried them off, or died even without any such visible marks of the shots. And how many wayfarers have fallen in with whole gangs of demons, with whom they engaged in pitched battles. They might stand their ground most heroically, and ultimately worst their assailants ; yet, hardly at home, they succumbed to sickness and death. And who could number the houses haunted by spectres which brought disease and death on the inmates, and thus rendered those houses virtually uninhabitable ? « In Tung-lai (prov. of Shan-tung) there was a dwelling where the Ch‘en clan lived, over a hundred strong. One fine morning the (water in the) boiler on which the food was being steamed, would"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 12 not bubble. They lifted p.471 up the pot containing the food, and glanced into the boiler, when lo ! a greybeard rose out of it. This event led them to go to a diviner. — This is an important apparition, this man said, which portends the destruction of a family ; go home, make weapons in great numbers, and have them placed against the walls at the gate : then fasten the gate firmly on the inside, and should horsemen appear with banners and canopies and knock at the door — beware of answering them. With this advice they went home. All hands armed, and more than a hundred weapons were procured, which they placed against the rooms flanking the gate. Indeed, some men appeared ; but however loudly they shouted, no answer was given them. Their leader, enraged by that silence, ordered them to scale the gate. But no sooner had his men cast a glance behind it and seen those hundred weapons of all sizes, than they retreated from the gate to report to him. The news threw the leader into great consternation. — Tell our men to come here immediately! he exclaimed to those that stood by, if they do not forthwith come, not one will get away from here ; how shall I then escape punishment ! Some eighty miles hence to the north, one hundred and thirty people live ; let us take them instead. Ten days afterwards this whole family had died out. It also belonged to the Ch‘en clan (105). Not even the establishments of virtuous monasticism are exempt from attacks of the malicious demon world. « In the Lung-ch‘ing district 1 there was a Buddhist monastery, named Tung-ko, which p.472 exercised a mysterious attraction. From its lofty balconies the wide horizon could be contemplated, and its windows opening on the celestial orb gave access to the  1 At present Ts‘in-ngan, in Kansuh."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 13 wind. Tourists (visiting the place in crowds) caused it to look like a busy market. One fine day there began to occur there ill-boding and strange things. Pot-sherds were thrown down from the air, and dust was whirled up, so that nobody dared to stand upright, and the resident monks found no rest at night. Their garments and religious instruments disappeared now and then, and were recovered afterwards. A Taoist doctor heard of it. — Whence have those ill-boding spirits the courage to do such things ? he said ; I can expel them. And the monks, very glad to hear it, hastened to invite him to their home. The doctor strode through the gate. He stepped the Yü dance in the great temple, and muttered the incantations of the celestial p‘eng ..lant 1 in a very harsh tone of voice. After a good while he missed his bonnet, and the bystanders clearly saw it flung through the air over the wall. When he had recovered it, and fixed it on his head with a throat-band, he went on reciting his incantations and striding round the place, but successively his robe was taken off him, his girdle was loosened, and his trousers slipped off ; and when even his cowl in which he had his written charms and other requirements for his arts, disappeared in a moment, he slunk away like a wolf. Several days after this, the cowl was found at the bottom of a hedge-row by a neighbouring villager while digging in the ground. p.473 The prefect of the district, Tu Yen-fan, an upright and straightforward man, went in person to the spot to see what had happened. — How is it that such things come to pass here ? he exclaimed.  1 [css : illisible]"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 14 He then sat down cross-legged, while the spectres flung down from the air a disorderly mixture of written leaflets in countless numbers, bearing for the most part complete sentences full of insults and malice. No sooner had the prefect deciphered the contents of one or two and understood their meaning, than he too hurried home. Still an inspector, Wang Chao-wei by name, relied enough on his blood and breath (innate power) to resort boldly to the spot and scold and revile (the spectres) ; but scarcely had he arrived, when a big stone smote him in the loins, and sent him back (106). Ghosts of improperly buried dead, haunting dwellings with injurious effect, and not laid until re-buried decently, are the subject of many written tales. But these tales are of little interest ; hence we confine ourselves to referring the reader to the one we gave on page 445. Naughty demons and devils do not even respect the deep recesses of Imperial harems. We read, for example, « that the Forbidden City was haunted in the Süen hwo period (1119-1126) by a being known as lai, a lumpish thing without head or eyes. Its hands and feet were covered with hair shining as varnish. When at midnight a thundering noise was heard 1, the people in the Forbidden City all cried : — The lai is coming ! and they bolted the doors of all buildings. Sometimes the spectre lay down in the bed of a lady of the harem, which was then felt to be warm ; and at daybreak it rolled out of the bed and disappeared, nobody knowing where it had gone. And when the ladies of the harem dreamed that they were sleeping with somebody, that somebody was the lai 2.  1 The word lai in its written form shows a dog () and thunder. 2 Yang o man pih, a small collection of miscellanies relating to the Sung period, by Chao Tsin, named also Yuen-tsin, who was prefect of Kien-ning fu, in Fuhkien, in the Hien shun period (1265-1275).

V 15 Being assimilated with the Yin or the dark half of the Universe, ghosts are bound to confine their deeds of evil especially to the night-time, more particularly to the deepest part of it, that is to say, the third watch, which lasts from eleven to one. In defiance, however, of this natural law, they go out for mischief very often in broad daylight and under the brightest sun. « In Ch‘ang-shan, an aged sire, Ngan by name, had a passion for agricultural work. Once in autumn, when the buckwheat was ripe and cut, and stood in stacks on the higher parts of the ground and in the field-paths, he told his labourers to take advantage of the moonlight and bring their loaded wains to the place where the grain was to be piled up, corn-thieves being known to live in the nearest village. And while the full wains were on their way home, he remained on the spot, to guard the rest. His head resting upon his lance, he lies down under the open sky, and his eye-lids droop, when suddenly he hears the crackling noise of human feet on the dry buckwheat stubble. ‘Here the rude visitors are, he thinks, quickly raising up his head ; but a tall devil it is, upwards of one chang in height, with red hair and tangled beard. It is already so near, that in his terror time fails him to devise anything better than to jump up and stab at the monster. With a thundering shout the spectre vanishes, and the old man, fearing its return, shoulders his lance and walks home. On the way he falls in with his labourers, to whom he relates his adventure, warning them not to go to the spot ; but they do not altogether believe him. Next day, as they are sunning grain in the threshing-floor, they suddenly hear a noise in the air. — There is the spectre again, the old man cries, terror-stricken, and he takes to his heels, everybody following his example. The p.475 next hour sees them back in the same place, and the old sire orders them to put a great number of bows and cross-bows handy against the spectre’s return. Next day it re-appears indeed. Several arrows at once whistle through the air, which so scare the spectre that it vanishes, to return no more for two or three days.

He himself is on the stack to tread the straw down ; but ere it has risen a few feet high, he suddenly scans the distance and exclaims affrighted : — The spectre is coming ! III. An Attack of a Spectre. — The demon snaps at his forehead, and vanishes. Every one looks to his bow and his arrows, but the monster is already upon the aged sire ; he falls down, the demon snaps at his forehead, and vanishes. The crowd hurries up to the stack to look at the old man. A piece of his forehead-bone, as large as the palm of a hand, is quite gone, and he lies insensible, recognizing nobody. They take him to his house, where he dies. The spectre appeared no more, and it is unknown what apparition this was(107)."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 17 The story of the clan in Tung-lai (p. 471), among which so terrible a havoc was made by spectres, has taught us that they often band p.476 together in gangs and hordes, armed, equipped and led by chieftains quite like terrestrial troops and armies. Kwei ping or ‘spectral warriors’, and their feats, form in fact a main feature of China’s Demonology. Already on page 445 we saw them appear on the side of Shi Wan-sui as his auxiliaries against rebels and enemies, in reward for his good treatment of the bones of their general. We read also in the Books of the Tsin Dynasty : When Sun Ngen attacked « the Hwui-khi region, Wang Ning-chi was entreated by his fellow-officers to take measures against him ; but instead of doing so, he retired into a cell to pray. On coming forth from it, he said to his generals : — I have besought the Great Tao to allow spectral soldiers to help us ; the enemy therefore will be defeated. Thus neglecting all preparations, he was killed by Sun Ngen (108). Especially singular it is to read of such hosts of spectres setting whole towns and countries in commotion, and demoralizing the people so thoroughly as to compel the authorities to intervene. « Groundless rumours about spectre-soldiers were abroad in Tsin-yang (in Shansi pr.) in the third year of the Ho ts’ing period (A. D. 564). The people, to drive them away, beat emulously on copper and iron implements (109). « And in the twenty-third 1 year of the Ching yuen period, in the sixth month, when the emperor was sojourning in the Eastern Capital, the people affrighted each other with spectre-soldiers, and all fled, quite at a loss where to stay, here and there thronging, beating, maiming and wounding each other. At first the spectre-soldiers crossed at the south of the Loh river, causing tumultuous  1 This must be a misprint. The Ching yuen period embraced no more than twenty years, from A. D. 785-804.

Every night they thus crossed the river twice or thrice. The emperor was highly displeased at the matter ; he ordered his wu and his Invokers to subdue them by means of sacrifices, and to set out every evening food and drink for them on the banks of the Loh 1. In the second year of the Kien chung period of the T‘ang dynasty (A. D. 781) false rumours circulated in the regions of the Yang-tszĕ and the Hwai about spectres coming from Hunan. Some called them hairy demons, while others declared them to be hairy men. It was reported that various tales were told of them, and nothing could be done with success against them in their variable forms. People would have it that they were bent on eating the hearts of men, but kidnapped young children of both sexes entire. Frightened out of their wits, people often crowded together in their houses, kept up flaming fires at night, and lacked courage to sleep ; they armed themselves with bows and swords, and each time when the devils entered a house, all other families beat on wooden boards and copper utensils, thus producing a noise which shook heaven and earth. Some died of frantic terror. Such was the state of things everywhere. The mandarins interfered, but they were powerless to put a stop to the matter. p.478 A former Judge of Merit of Yen-cheu, Liu Ts’an by name, had been on duty in Hwai and Szĕ (in Nganhwui pr.), and therefore dwelt in Kwang-ling with half a dozen sons, fellows all strong and brave. With them he kept watch by night, armed with bows and arrows.

The lads are startled, but the door being barred, they cannot enter to run to the rescue, and they must content themselves with keeping on the alert and peeping into the hall. They behold a being like a couch ; it has hairs and prickles like a hedge-hog ; it measures from three to four feet in height and has legs on the four sides, on which it hurries around in the hall. At its side another spectre moves, black-haired, naked, and with claws and teeth like swords. It seizes the youngest daughter, and puts her on the hairy couch ; then it grasps the other girl, but at this critical moment the brave lads push down the wall and enter. They shoot their arrows into the couch, and it runs away with the other spectre ; in a moment the latter vanishes, while the couch runs eastward. Now it is hit so truly by a hundred and more arrowshots, that it cannot fly any further.

The Emperor then composed a decree, by which a commissioner was sent to that country to warn those spectres and offer sacrifices to them. That officer spoke to them as follows : — In this World of Light we have ceremonies and music, and the World of Darkness has its kwei and its shen. The sacrifices the Imperial House has to offer, serve for ruling the people ; but the sacrifices of the people extend not further than to their ancestors ; all sacrifices which they might offer to other beings are not agreeable to the shen, on account of their being inconsistent with the Rites. The spirits of the principal mountains, the seas and streams, and all other mountains and rivers which have a place in the State Canon of Sacrificial Worship, have all without exception to accept orders from the Supreme Emperor (of Heaven) and from the God of Earth about the way in which they are to exercise their power to bestow felicity on good men and to visit the bad with misfortune. Hence, whenever felicity and p.480 misfortune are distributed in an erroneous way, so that the people feel dissatisfied, we have to report to Heaven the wrong they suffer.

Ourselves since Our accession to the throne have sacrificed to the shen without falling short in any of the statutory ritual rescripts ; but you have no right to demand any sacrifices which We are not in duty bound to offer. Torch-bearing spectres, bring mishap on all whosoever deserve it, but confer felicity on those who deserve to be happy, and do not do any evil to people inconsiderately, thereby bringing upon yourself the punishments of Heaven (110). p.481 Nineteen years later, the same Son of Heaven had to wield his exorcising sceptre anew on behalf of his harrassed subjects in the same region. « In the thirtieth year of his reign, the country outside the suburbs of Ngan-tung was haunted by kwei wandering about in broad daylight, and making noise in troops of hundreds, nay thousands. The emperor Kao prepared a writing, and sacrificed to them, and then the spectres ceased (111)."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 22 Such spectre-panics are also stated to have taken place in other parts of the empire. « According to the General Memoirs relating to Szĕ-ch‘wen, kwei entered the bazaars of Wu-lung in the twenty-third year of the Kia tsing period (A. D. 1544), and carried people on their shoulders (112). « And according to the General Memoirs bearing on Kwangsi province, there were yao and p.482 sheng (pp. 466 and 468) at work in Hung-cheu in the tenth month of the thirty-sixth year of the same period. Before it was made out what beings they were, it was reported that they came from the north, and passing through Kiangsi reached Kwangtung. Sometimes they penetrated into human dwellings in the night, and there indulged in obscenities. Some showed themselves in the shape of sing (a kind of ape), or as bats, monkeys or dogs, or as black vapours apparently having tails and claws with which they could inflict wounds, so that adulterers who came into contact with them, suffered death. At night the families crowded together to withstand their attacks by beating on gongs and drums, and holding bamboo and willow sticks. Those spectres used to come in compact masses, but when struck at, they dispersed, and changed into sparks quickly conglomerating into balls, which disappeared on striking against the eaves. In the second month of the next year they visited the department again, and molested the villages as before, not ceasing until several months had elapsed (113). About the year 1886 we found it still fresh in the memory of people at Amoy, that, eight years before, the country had generally been thrown into commotion by spectres of a very malicious character, which preyed on nothing less than the pigtails of inoffensive people. During that time of panic, very respectable gentlemen, even the highest notabilities, suddenly, in a most mysterious way, had found themselves robbed of their queue, even in broad daylight, in noisy streets, preferably while enjoying some public theatrical performance in a square or bazaar, or when visiting a shop, or even in their"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 23 own houses, with securely barred doors. Such periods of ‘tail-cutting’ p.483 occur frequently. Most absurd stories are then rife, and universally believed by the populace, who, with their implicit belief in spectres and magic arts, deem nothing incredible. To some it occurs that the miscreants may be men, bad characters, bent on deriving advantage somehow or other from the prevailing excitement. Thus tumults arise, and the safety of unoffending people is placed in actual peril. Unless it be admitted by general assent that the mischief is done exclusively by invisible malignant spectres, the officials interfere, and to re-assure the populace and still the tempest of emotion, imprison persons upon whom suspicion falls, preferably sending out their yamen-runners among members of secret religious sects, severely persecuted by the Government as heretics, enemies of the old and orthodox social order, evil-intentioned outlaws, the corroding canker of humanity. In most cases their judicial examinations corroborate their pre-conceived suspicion, for they admirably understand the art of extorting by scourge and torture, even from the most obdurate temperaments, any confessions, but especially such as they beforehand have assumed to be true. There are always, of course, during such panics clear-sighted men and women reported to have caught a glimpse of tail-cutting phantoms, and to have perceived they were tiny, and of paper : an idea engendered, no doubt, by the circumstance that the Chinese are in the habit of sending paper people, servants, concubines and slaves into the other world, to serve the dead as living beings. Some authors have written on the subject. Mr. Holcombe, Acting Minister of the United States in Peking, stated in an entertaining book, published in 1895, that nearly every year in some section of the empire a perfect whirlwind of excitement suddenly springs up with no apparent cause, over what is commonly called ‘tail cutting’. It comes and goes unexpectedly, no one knows how it began, what occasioned it, or how it may end. In such a fever, the entire mass of the population, the must intelligent as well as the most ignorant, goes wild with excitement and fear. The absurdest stories are circulated and believed. Such and such a Chinaman is walking along the street, when his queue suddenly drops off and vanishes, without any human being being near him at the time. Another man puts up his hand to coil his queue, and finds that he has none. Another falls into"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 24 conversation with a stranger in the street, who suddenly vanishes, together with the man’s queue. Another glances at a child, when the child gazes steadily at him, and his queue at once fades out of sight, leaving only an odour of burnt hair. These are p.484 specimens of the stories told everywhere, and universally believed. It would naturally be expected that, in such emotional disturbances, the officials would concert measures to re-assure the populace. They do nothing of the sort. In all matters of superstition or belief they are hardly more enlightened than those whom they govern. « I have — the writer assures us — seen at least a dozen proclamations, issued by magistrates of Peking, in times of this sort of excitement, and every one was directly calculated to increase rather than lessen the disturbance of the public mind. They commonly began by warning the people that these were days of danger, when every person should stay closely at home and attend to his own affairs. They advised all to avoid strangers, see that their doors and windows were carefully closed at all hours, on no account to be out after dark, and to look after their children. Some of them concluded by furnishing a sovereign protection, a sort of patent-medicine recipe for securing the queue from harm. This recipe in most cases was very simple. In one proclamation it merely directed that a red and yellow cord be braided in with the hair ; in another it prescribed a medicine to be taken internally, and in another, which also prescribed a medicine, one half was to be swallowed and the other half thrown upon a kitchen fire (114). It should be added that, though in such tail-cutting excitements every man’s mouth is full of stories such as have been described, the people being thus utterly demoralized and business brought to a standstill, yet generally not the slightest tangible evidence is forthcoming that a single Chinaman has suffered the loss of one hair of his head. The basis of every one of the stories is hearsay, and each such excitement is an unaccountable, but dangerous epidemic of superstitious fear. It is, of course, hard to admit that such panics have occurred only. in later times ; but the introduction by the Manchu dynasty now reigning, of the"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 25 fashion of pig-tails, easy to cut, may have increased their number. In Chapter V, 4, we shall make mention of one, caused by malicious fox-elfs as early as the year 477, and of another prevailing forty years later in the then Imperial capital. They have often prevailed, under the present dynasty, causing even the emperors to intervene with edicts. So did Kao Tsung in 1768. On the 29th day of the eighth month (9th Oct.) he decreed, that owing to searches made for tail-cutters by the authorities, a Mahayāna p.485 sect and a Wu-wei sect had been discovered outside the walls of Su-cheu, the famous city in southern Kiangsu ; it had as many as eleven chapels or meeting-places. The leaders and the principal members of all these parishes had been captured, together with the inmates and servants of the buildings, more than seventy in all. The decree refers to a precedent. Sectarianism, it declares, throve nowhere so much as in the department of Süen-hwa, in the far north-west of Chihli, notwithstanding frequent persecutions. On a certain occasion, while searches were being made there for tail-cutters, religious communities were discovered ; the seditious among the members were punished in accordance with the Law ; those who persisted in their heresy were banished to Sin-kiang (Turkestan), and the apostates were castigated with long sticks and banished within China proper, in this way to learn not to defy the laws a second time. A like event is that which has now occurred in the vice-royalty of Kiangnan ; so, to nip the evil in the bud, great numbers of persons must be prosecuted, as a warning for the future. As has been done in Süen-hwa, the seditious elements and tail-cutters shall be searched for with the utmost diligence, thus to get to the very bottom of the matter ; the captives shall be examined one by one as soon as possible, and condemned to punishments, without the slightest indulgence or lenity being shown (115). And on the 21st day of the next month (31st Oct.) another Imperial resolution announced the receipt of a report from the provincial Governor of Honan respecting the arrest of sectaries in three parts of that province, and it prescribed severe punishment to be inflicted on those people and their accomplices. It has, so that edict continues, not yet been pointed out that the tail-cutting certainly proceeds from such seditious sectaries ; the perpetrators of that crime have not, like the latter, headmen or leaders, but are seditious scoundrels, who, desirous of causing mischief, send out bands to commit the"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 26 crime under cover of darkness, in order to keep whole districts and villages in a perpetual state of alarm and agitation, and thus to bring about revolutionary movements. Now this stamps their proceeding as the most heinous of crimes, viz. rebellion. Generally speaking it does not emanate from Buddhist or Taoist heresies, nor from people who have been led astray by reading heretical writings, but thus far have kept quiet. But p.486 when heretical sects have the courage to issue seditious and rebellious writings and sow the seeds of seduction, their ways run parallel with those of the revolutionary tail-cutters. The Governor of Honan therefore must scrupulously examine each of his prisoners on that point, in order to get hold of some clue which may lead to the detection of the chief culprits of the tail-cutting ; and as soon as any certainty is obtained in this direction, he must send in a circumstantial report to the Throne., Should he discover nothing of the kind, he shall sentence his prisoners to the heaviest penalties for the crimes for which they were prosecuted (116). Three days afterwards this decree was followed by another on the same topic. It proclaimed that the panic had first broken out in Kiangsu and Chehkiang, and not having been suppressed in time by arrest of the culprits, had spread over all the provinces of the empire. Then the emperor had felt compelled to issue edicts ordering the official world to arrest unsparingly the miscreants everywhere. But, as usual, they had done the work in a wrong manner, arrested many innocent people, and sent up to Peking a number of them, who for the most part proved guiltless, or at least not to be the chief culprits. As a consequence, the emperor ordered the arrests to be stopped ; but now he commands again that the high provincial authorities shall by no means be remiss in diligently searching for disturbers of the peace. On the fifth of the next month (13th Nov.) this decree was again followed by another. It declared that the panic had even spread over Yunnan, Kweicheu, Szĕ-ch‘wen, and the two Kwang, and to the north as far as Shingking and Kirin, and gave new instructions to the Viceroys and Governors for the suppression of the evil. A further edict, which appeared twelve days later, informs us of the arrest by the authorities in the Kiangsu vice-royalty of two Buddhist priests, who distributed charms and papers inscribed with red characters purporting to counteract the evil, a practice which had also been"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 27 reported before from Hukwang. The emperor demands prosecution of those priests, who, using the name of Chang, the Celestial master, seriously misled the people ; and whereas all that tail-cutting probably is a crafty plot of scoundrels wishing by the sale of charms to make money out of the consternation, the Viceroy should diligently avail himself of the capture of those priests to search for Glues which may lead to discovery of the guilty. p.487 These edicts plainly show, that in that memorable year 1768 the panic swept over nearly the whole empire, occupying the minds of the authorities high and low, although they did not themselves share the belief that it was the work of spectres. That this belief was that of the people generally, the sale of charms proves. It is worth notice that this craze is mentioned by a European then living in China. Father Ventavon wrote in a letter reproduced in the Lettres Edifiantes (vol. XXIII, p. 561) : « Dans le milieu de l’année 1768 il s’était répandu dans diverses provinces des bruits qui ne laissaient pas d’inquiéter le Gouvernement. Plusieurs se plaignaient qu’on leur avait coupé furtivement leur queue ; la coupure de cette queue était suivie, à ce qu’on disait, de défaillances, d’évanouissements, et de la mort même, si on n’y apportait un prompt remède ; pour quelques-uns à qui cela pouvait être arrivé, on en supposait des milliers, et le beau c’est que, malgré toute la diligence possible et les récompenses promises par l’empereur, on n’a pu attraper sur le fait aucun de ces coupeurs de queue, soit que, pour mieux jouer leur rôle, les auteurs de cette forfanterie fussent d’accord avec ceux même qui se plaignaient d’avoir eu la queue coupée, soit pour quelque raison qu’on n’est jamais venu à bout de tirer au clair. Le soupçon assez généralement est retombé sur les bonzes ou faux prêtres des idoles, en sorte qu’il y a eu des ordres de rechercher toutes les différentes sectes tolérées dans l’empire, et, comme il arrive ordinairement dans ces sortes de perquisitions, quelques chrétiens furent surpris et arrêtés dans une des provinces... In a decree issued by the Throne in 1812, on the 21st of the sixth month (29 July), we find it stated that, since that storm of consternation, no"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 28 complaint about tail-cutting had reached the throne, but that shortly before, a Censor, Yung Ch‘un (117) by name, had reported that the evil had showed itself in the Metropolis, and required thorough investigation and prosecution. The emperor ordered, however, that this high dignitary should be punished with degradation, his statement having been found to be untrue. Then we hear again of a tail-cutting panic in 1821, through an edict of the 25th day of the eighth month (20th Sept.), as follows : « According to a report of the Censor Li Teh-lih, an epidemic is spreading in the province of Shantung, infecting every house. In the p.488 department of Teh (in the north-west of that province) scoundrels seize this opportunity to relate, that on the first or the second day of the seventh month spectres will knock at the house-doors, and that those who answer will be sure to die. They thus cause the inhabitants, who transmit this lie to each other, to pass their nights in dismay and fear. And in the Tung-ch‘ang circuit the rumour is also spread abroad, that heretical villains clandestinely cut off tails and hair, and cut out the organs from young boys and young girls ; carriers of vegetables and flour, who frequent the roads there, take advantage of those tales to distribute (for money ?) things like packets of medicine. And further there is a swindler living in Tung-kwan, in the Tsi-ning department, Hwang ’Rh by name, who has hitherto occupied himself with the painting of charms to cure the sick, and is called Hwang the Semi-immortal. About the 10th of the seventh month he conceived the idea of taking advantage of the prevailing disaster to swindle people out of their money. To this end he devised the name ‘evil spectres of the Buddhist priests with plaited hair’ ; and his comrades, a set of worthless scoundrels, therewith confounded the ears of the people, and then, late in the evening, rushed into their premises and dwellings, saying they were such evil spectres, and promiscuously stealing and robbing in the vilest manner. As afterwards the band divided their spoil unequally and therefore cruelly thrashed each other, that man was delivered up by the chief of the ward to the magistrate ; but this head of the"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 29 department despatched nobody to make enquiries, and released him. That in Shantung, while an epidemic of the season is spreading, malicious rogues should venture to take advantage thereof and spread heretical sayings which cause the inhabitants to lead one another astray and fall into panic and terror, is a violation of the existing law. But that, moreover, malignant and depraved swindlers should pretend to be evil spectres, intrude themselves into the premises and dwellings of others, and promiscuously commit the vilest robberies — this is abominable in a still higher degree. Wherefore Khi Shen (the Governor), and the Provincial Chief Judge Lo Han-chang shall depute officials to track and arrest the chief culprits among the spreaders of that heretical talk, and they shall rigorously bring them to justice. And that Governor shall forthwith give orders to arrest Hwang ’Rh, and bring him before his tribunal, and examine him with regard to his crew of p.489 accomplices ; and if he discovers that they really have committed such villanous acts of theft and robbery, he shall forthwith punish them according to the law, without the slightest indulgence (118). Again we have found an edict, of the 29th of the seventh month (12th Sept.) of the year 1844, informing us of tail-cutting practices in T‘ai-yuen, the provincial capital of Shansi, and in its environs, as also in the districts of Yü-tszĕ and T‘ai-kuh situated to the south of it. The emperor in that edict, of course, orders the officials to make strict, but prudent inquiry for the dangerous culprits, who always and ever vanish like spectres (119). Probably we may admit, that in those panics, as in all that have prevailed, the culprits were, as a rule, not believed to cut the tails themselves, but to procure spectres to do so. Thus their work was sorcery. In fact, in an edict which the Viceroy of Nanking promulgated in Shanghai in 1876, the following passages occurred, according to an official French translation : « p.490 Aujourd’hui j’apprends que les bruits qui circulent dans les endroits soumis à ma jurisdiction relativement aux hommes en papier, aux tresses coupées, se tourneraient contre les Chrétiens"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 30 qu’on accuse, et donneraient naissance à de mauvais projets contre eux. Si je me reporte au temps passé, je vois que les membres de la Société du Nénuphar blanc ont employé ces moyens : hommes en papier, tresses et plumes de poulets coupées, afin d’arriver en troublant les esprits, à s’emparer des valeurs d’autrui. Depuis quelque temps des gens sans aveu font circuler des bruits sur les tresses et les cheveux coupés. Tout le monde en parle, mais personne ne l’a vu de ses yeux ; personne ne s’est assuré du fait. D’un autre côté, tous ces bruits ridicules n’ont rien à faire avec la religion chrétienne. Vous devez donc rester calmes, paisibles, ne point prêter attention aux histoires sans fondement, ne point vous effrayer, ne point vous exciter (120). As is shown in the foregoing pages, spectres in China manifest their presence very often by sounds or noise. Thus, daily and hourly, new sources of commotion, alarm and panic are developed, every mysterious sound being readily ascribed to spectres in a country where man is so exceedingly credulous. As early as the first century of our era the author of the Shwoh wen attested the prevalence of the belief in the crying of ghosts, by inserting in that vocabulary the character , now pronounced jü, stating it « to represent the noise made by kwei and mei, and, when pronounced twice, to mean incessantly (121) ; no doubt then, in those times the howling of ghosts was deemed to be long and protracted. The belief that the souls of the dead often give evidence of their presence by howls and plaintive cries, was, as we saw on page 414, so general about the time of Christ as to make Wang Ch‘ung it find worth to refute it with ardour. Chinese books abound with intimations that this belief flourished throughout subsequent ages, and that spectral sounds, generally denoted by the characters ts‘iu-ts‘iu, meaning to hiss, to buzz or to moan, always inspired the living with fright, on account of their entailing famine and death, bloodshed, rebellion, war, p.491 dispersion of the people, and all the"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 31 horrors and misery connected with it, nay, even the death of the Son of Heaven, or the total dethronement and destruction of the reigning dynasty. To give a few instances : « When Wei Khiüng had been defeated at Siang-cheu in the second year of the Ta siang period of the Cheu dynasty (A.D 581), several tees of thousands of his adherents were buried alive in the Yiu-yü parks, and the howling voices of all those kwei were then frequently heard at night in that spot. The Traditions about the Five Elements of the Great Plan 1 say : ‘Howling by which the dead manifest their propinquity, is an evil of nocturnal spectres ; spectres and howling in the dark portend that death shall ensue’. And the Yih fei-heu, by the hand of King Fang 2, has : ‘When kwei howl at night, the dynasty will be destroyed’. Next year the princes of the Cheu family were killed, and its rule too was overthrown. — In the Jen sheu period (601-605) bowling of kwei was heard over and over again in the Jen-sheu palace and along the long wall, whereupon the empress Hien and the emperor died successively in that palace, unexpectedly. And in the eighth year of the Ta yeh period (612), Yang Yuen-kan (Book I, p. 1406) revolted against the Imperial authority in Tung-tu 3, and the minister Fan Tszĕ-kai buried his clan and his associates alive outside the Ch‘ang-hia gate, to a total of some myriads. In the last year of that period (616) the kwei were often heard howling in that place in a plaintive, moaning tone, which foreboded like events as in the above cases ; for afterwards T‘ung, the prince of Yueh (son of the emperor Yang),  1 Hung-fan wu hing ch‘wen. A work based on a section of the Shu king entitled Hung fan or The Great Plan, which we have mentioned on p. 955 of Book I. It seems to have been held in great esteem in the sixth century as an expositor of prognostics. It was then composed of eleven chapters, with a commentary by Liu Hiang, so that it must have existed previous to our era (Books of the Sui Dyn., ch. 32, l. 11). It is often quoted in the Books of the Later Han Dynasty, especially in the [], or Memorials concerning the Five Elements, forming its chapters 23-29. I do not believe that it still exists. 2 A work evidently of the same character as the preceding. Its author as a grandee of the first century B.

Book I, p. 1001). 3 The then Imperial Metropolis, the present Ho-nan fu or Loh-yang, in Honan pr."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol.

Horror-stricken, he caught the small-pox, and died (123). The reader has seen on page 56 that Chu Hi referred in his writings to the belief in evil spectres which howl about human dwellings, in these words : « Those kwei and shen that groan and whistle on the house tops and butt against our breasts, are evil beings of darkness. Coming down to still later times, we read in the Memoirs concerning the Lu-ngan Department (124), which forms a part of the province of Shansi : « In the sixteenth year of the Ch‘ung ching period (1643), in winter, kwei howled by the south-east corner of the chief city of the department, in the unoccupied fields and the open country. A very plaintive howling it was, produced by groups of thousands or hundreds, a mixture of short shrieks and prolonged wailing, slowly receding in the distance and there dying away. At night it increased in intensity. This lasted for three months. Next year the insurgents under Ch‘en 1 crossed the Hwang-ho, and the city could not hold out against them (125). p.493 Even nowadays it must be obvious to every one who maintains intercourse with the Chinese and studiously observes them, that they much dread all mysterious sounds, and are always ready to ascribe these to maleficent ghosts. In the south-east of Fuhkien, people are remarkably quick to say, whenever they hear some strange noise : kúi ki-ki háo, ‘the kwei are peeping’. It is deemed especially ill-omened and dangerous for a man to hear a spectre call him by his proper name. The soothsayer in such a case is applied to immediately. He opens his vademecum — a thumbed little book in  1 That is to say, Li Tszĕ-ch‘ing, who overthrew the Ming dynasty (Book I, p. 1134). He was Prince of Ch‘en.

Should it be a day denoted by the character tszĕ (comp. Book I, page 103), the event foretokens injury to the children and cattle of the client ; on a ch‘eu day it announces the sudden, violent death of an elder relation of his ; on a yin day it proves that terror and fright are going to affect his children at home. Occurring on a mao day, it prognosticates that a great catastrophe, a conflagration or inundation, is imminent ; on a ch‘en day, that some woman in the family-way is going to die ; and on a szĕ day, that the client’s father or mother will depart this life. If the calling was heard by him on a wu day, maledictions or curses will work their effect on him ; on a wei day, catastrophes will come down upon the younger members of his family ; on a shen day, the event prophesies to him a case of death ; on a yiu day, the demise of his father or mother is imminent, and on a suh day, accidental death of somebody ; finally, on a hai day, scourges of war are to be expected. It would be an error to suppose that ghosts always make themselves heard with malign intent or evil consequences. Being occasionally kindly disposed to man, their voices may sometimes announce good, and many a tale stands in Chinese books to prove this. We read e. g. : « In the Yuen t’ung period (A. D. 1333 or 1334) one Sung Kien-nah, a native of Yen-ts‘ang, which belongs to Hang-cheu, sojourned in the Metropolis in search of a chance to make himself meritorious and famous (in the service of the State), but he was unsuccessful. His means were totally exhausted ; nevertheless he remained very careful of his conduct, and incapable of any dishonest act. So he left the City by the Ts‘i-hwa p.494 gate, to find a suitable place to die. He beheld a pond, and was on the point of throwing himself into it, when he heard the voice of a kwei in the air. — Sung Kien-nah, it said ; the life you have to live in the world of light is not yet ended ; you may not die."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol.

V 35 CHAPTER II On Spectres of Mounts and Forests @ p.495 The Chinese having a world of demons enormously populous, we can hardly expect them to have left it unclassified. Specifications of spectres according to their idiosyncrasies, shapes or manners have, indeed, arisen in course of time, developing spontaneously with superstition generally, without, as it appears, being proposed or sanctioned by leading thinkers, philosophers, or prominent men of intellect. Such worthies probably never troubled their heads to any great extent with such things, but none withheld their approval from a division of spectres into those living in mountains and forests, in the water, and in the ground, which, according to tradition, had been declared by the great Confucius to be correct. It is related in the Kwoh yü, that Ki Hwan-tszĕ, a grandee of the state of Lu, « caused a-well to be dug, when they fetched up something like an earthen pot with a goat in it. He had Chung-ni (Confucius) interrogated about it, in these words : — I dug a well, and got a dog ; tell me what this is. On which the Sage answered : ‘According to what I have learned, it must be a goat ; for I have heard that apparitions between trees and rocks are called khwei and wang-liang, while those in the water are lung or dragons, and wang-siang, and those in the ground are called fen-yang (127). That these lines give us a folk-conception older, perhaps much older, than the time of Confucius, is self-evident. Those three classes of spectres often recur in the books of subsequent times, with information about their characteristics and activity, which we shall now review for each of them separately."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 36 The first class then comprises the khwei and the wang-liang. p.496 In the first century of our era, the etymologist Hü Shen, author of the Shwoh wen, wrote in that work, that « a khwei () is a hü (see p. 466) resembling a dragon with one leg represented by the component , and that the character represents the beast with horns, hands, and a human face (128). Immediately before, that dictionary gives the same character, but without the horns (), saying « it means a greedy quadruped, generally stated to be a she-monkey resembling a man ; it contains the component head , with , and, , representing respectively the arms and the leg of the beast. Consequently, unless we reject these dissections as trifling, the khwei were thought to be a class of one-legged beasts or dragons with human countenances. From very ancient times they seem to have inspired the Chinese with awe and fear, for in one of the oldest sections of the Shu king the character khwei occurs with the meaning of intimidating, awe-inspiring, stern. That Classic states indeed, that a Minister of the great Shun declared on a certain occasion, that his Imperial master, « on appearing before Ku-seu (his blind father), was khwei-khwei, and behaved in a composed and timid manner (129). Those one-legged dragons were in ancient China fancied to be amphibious, and to cause wind and rain. In the Shan-hai king we read : « In the Eastern Seas is a Land of rolling Waves, extending sea-ward over seven thousand miles. There certain animals live, shaped as cows with blue bodies, but hornless, and one-legged. Whenever they leave or enter the waters, winds are sure to blow, and rains to fall. Their glare is that of the sun and the moon, their voice is that of thunder. They are named khwei.

The representation of the khwei as one-legged dragons we may readily explain by consulting the Shu king and the writings of Han Fei, which date from the third century B. C. The first-named work tells us in the Canon of Shun, that a minister of this emperor, his Director of Music, bore the name of Khwei, and moreover that of Lung or Dragon. And Han Fei relates : « The ruler Ngai of Lu asked Confucius, saying : — I have heard that there has lived in ancient times a certain Khwei with one leg ; may we really believe in his one-leggedness ? Confucius answered : — No ; he was no monopod ; he was a choleric, perverse, ill-natured man, who raised much discontent ; but he escaped being by reason of this killed by the hand of man on account of his trustworthiness, for everybody said : this is the only man of one piece and complete. Thus Khwei was not one-legged, but he was a man of a piece and complete. The ruler Ngai now said : — Thus the fact is, that he was solid and complete. « According to another reading, the ruler Ngai asked Confucius, saying : — I have heard that Khwei had one leg ; does this deserve belief ? The answer was : — Khwei was a man ; why should he have had no more than one leg ? he had no other peculiarity but that he was versed in music. Yao said : ‘Khwei is of a piece and complete !’ and he made him his Director of Music, and therefore princely men have described him as a man of a piece and complete, but not with one leg (130)."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 38 The legend then owes its origin p.498 to the accidental circumstance that has a double meaning, namely ‘one leg’, and ‘of a piece and complete’. As the ancients thus represented the khwei as spirits with an animal shape, it becomes clear why in the extract from the Kwoh yü, with which we began, their congeners or other selves, the wang-liang, are represented by the characters , in which we see the radical , ‘animal’. In some editions we find this prefix replaced by kwei. Other works, as the Tso ch‘wen, give the term with no radical at all. In the Historical Records, which also relate the same episode of Confucius’ life (ch. 47, l. 5), it has the form . Apparently none of those forms are ideographic : they rather seem to be phonetic pictures of certain colloquial works denoting demons or ghosts. According to all Chinese authorities who have occupied themselves with the wang-liang, they are identical with the fang-liang which, according to a passage in the Cheu li translated by us on page 162 of Book I, were expelled from graves at burials by certain masked exorcists. This word fang-liang looks like a dialectic variation or a corruption of wang-liang. The fact that those spectres are mentioned in that book, to which the Chinese ascribe a very early date, attests the antiquity of the belief in their existence. That later ages did not alter the ideas in China respecting the shape of the wang-liang or khwei, we may learn from the commentary which Wei Chao wrote upon the Kwoh yü in the third century of our era. In a note upon the Ki Hwan-tszĕ anecdote he stated : « Some say that the khwei have one leg. The people of Yueh (Chehkiang and northern Fuhkien) style them (sao) of the hills, which character occurs also in the form (siao). They exist in Fu-yang (about the present Hang-cheu), have a human countenance and an ape-like body, and can speak. Some say that the one-legged wang-liang are spirits (tsing) of the hills, who by imitating human voices bewilder people. Those terms sao and siao too are, we think, local expressions. Authors of later times use them in their writings preferably to p.499 khwei, wang-liang and fang-liang ; hence these old words have become obsolete, and are hardly"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 39 used but in classical writing. Mostly we find the word sao or siao written or . Another designation for these spectres is shan-tsing , ‘tsing or vital spirits of hills or mountains’. All those terms are applied by Chinese authors indifferently to whatever demons play tricks upon man and disturb his peace, and which we may take to represent for China the broad class of sprites, elves, fairies and hobgoblins, with which mankind generally peoples forests ; rocks and hills, increasing their ranks daily with souls of the dead buried abroad. The human mind, imbued from its first development with the belief in a close relation between men and animals, readily identified in China those spirits with beasts. Fancy never ceased from inventing hybrid and grotesque forms for them even when man had changed the nomadic state for a settled life in hamlets and villages ; and so the remote, unfrequented mountain-forests still are to the Chinese people a kingdom full of mysterious spectral beings, strange and wonderful. Though invested with semi-animal shapes, yet the human character of those mountain-elves was never lost from view, and the belief in their descent from man was adhered to tenaciously. That this was so in the beginning of our era, we may infer from the following tradition, recorded by Wang Ch‘ung : « The (books of) rites say, that Chwen-süh — a mythic emperor of the 26th century B. C. — had three sons, who died at their birth, and on their departure became kwei causing contagious diseases. One lives in the water of the rivers and is the kwei that produces fever. Another dwells in Joh-shui and is the wang-liang demon. And the third lives in buildings and rooms, in nooks and corners, and in tumble-down storehouses, and his speciality lies in frightening babies 1. The reader will observe that entire classes of spirits are here identified each with a single human being of antiquity. This p.500 phenomenon points to  1 Lun heng, ch. 22, sect. Ting-kuei [cf. trad. Forke, I, p. 239]. This passage occurs also in the Sheu shen ki, ch. 16, and in the Tuh twan, some thirty leaves of notes on dynastic rescripts, rites, customs, and history up to the time of Ts’ai Yung, its author, a famous man of letters and politician who lived from A.

V 40 a firm belief in the divisibility of souls (Book II, ch. 3), a belief which pervades the idolatry of the Chinese in all its parts, and the knowledge of which is indispensable for the understanding of several usages and conceptions attending their Animism. Books of ensuing centuries are replete with particulars about the siao. Liberal in such data is the Shen i king. « Deep in the mountains of the West human beings exist, more than a chang 1 in size. They go naked, and catch frogs and crabs. They are not shy of men, and when they see them halt to pass the night, they betake themselves to their fire, to roast their frogs and crabs. They also watch the moment on which the men are absent, and steal their salt, to eat their frogs and crabs with. They are called hill-sao, because they cry out this sound themselves. People have cast bamboo in their fires, which, on exploding therein, leapt out of it and scared the sao away altogether. When an attack is made on them, they cause their assailants to catch fever. Although these beings have a human shape, they take other forms, and thus belong also to the class of kwei and mei. Nowadays their abodes occur everywhere in the mountains. We learn also much about the subject from Koh Hung’s pen. « In all mountains, he writes, the big as well as the small, there are shen and ling. Big mountains house big shen, small mountains small ones. If a man should enter the mountains unarmed with expedients, he is certain to suffer injury or death. He will, for example, be rendered ill, or he will be wounded or stabbed, scared and disquieted, or he will see lights and shadows, or smell strange odours. Sometimes those beings will cause big trees to snap in the absence of any wind, or rocks to tumble down with no palpable reason, men being thus hit and killed. Others bewilder men, and cause them to run about, deprived of reason, and to tumble down into abysses. Others again send tigers upon them, or wolves, or  1 Some editions have a ch‘ih or foot, one tenth of a chang. "},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol.

You should make such excursions in the third month of the year, or in the ninth, as it is in these months that the mountains are accessible. Moreover, it is necessary to select from these months an auspicious day and a favourable hour ; but should these preliminaries take too much of your time, or should it be impossible to delay your departure, so that you must depart in the current month, mere selection of a lucky day and hour may suffice.

Let him call out at the same time the word jeh-juh, which is also a name of those beings. Furthermore there exist certain mountain-tsing like drums, of a carnation colour and with one leg, which are known by the name of hwui. Others, named kin-lei, have human forms, are nine feet long, and wear fur coats and hats of bamboo. Others are the so-called fei-fei, resembling five-coloured dragons with red horns.

V 42 denominations of those demons we are indebted to Twan Ch’ing-shih. In his Noh-kao ki 1, a small treatise incorporated with the Yiu-yang tsah tsu, we read, in the second part : « The hill-siao are also called hill-sao. The Shen i king writes their name as . The Description of the Yung-kia principality calls them hill-mei. Still other names are : hill-horses, dragons or gavials, choh-juh, jeh-juh, hwui, and flying dragons. They are blue as doves.

They always regard each other in the attitude of archers ready for defence. They employ tigers to kill men, and they set fire to cottages and houses. The common people call them hill-siao. p.503 From the multitude of their names we may infer the probability that the belief in these spectres prevails generally in China. The authors who have deemed it worth while to write on them, for the most part content themselves with transcribing the older statements, of which the reader now has a synopsis before him ; fresh information is supplied by only a few. The Hu wei, the interesting tiger-lore book of the sixteenth century, known to our readers, relates : « The hill-siao occur everywhere south of the Sierra (i. e. in Kwangtung). They have one leg with reverse heel, so that they possess three limbs. Their females are fond of painting themselves with red cosmetics and rice-flour. They make their nests in big hollow trees, in which they have wooden wind-screens and curtains. They have a great store and variety of food. When a southerner is on travel in the mountains, he mostly carries with him some yellow cosmetics, as also lead paint, rice-powder, some coins, etc. When then he falls in with a male, he calls him mountain-chief, and a female he styles mountain-lady ; she is sure  1 The meaning of this title is ambiguous. The word Noh-kao appears in the writings of Koh Hung (Pao P‘oh-tszĕ, ch. 17*) in a spell, beginning with the words : ‘Noh-kao, T‘ai-yin General’ ; thus the term must be the name of a divinity who played a great part in China’s ancient chronology, and of whom we shall have more to say elsewhere."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 43 to ask for some cosmetics and rice-powder, and if he gives these things, he may ensure her protection’. In the T‘ien pao period of the T‘ang dynasty (742-755) there was among the foreigners from the north a man travelling through the hills south of the Sierra. Fearing an encounter with tigers, he climbed a tree at evening to pass the night in it, but found therein a female hill-siao. Our man was accustomed to carry some slight presents with him. He descended from the tree, made some bows to that being, and called her mountain-lady ; and on her asking him from the tree what things he had with him, he gave her some cosmetics and powder. Delighted with these, she laid : — Quietly lay yourself down to rest, and have no p.504 fear ; so the traveller slept under the tree. In the night two tigers came thither, but the hill-siao quitted the tree and patting the monsters on their head, said : — Stripes, here is a guest of mine, go away quickly ! and the monsters withdrew. Next morning, when he took leave of her, she overwhelmed him with warm thanks (132). Another work relates : « In the Khai yuen period (713-741), the scholar Wei Chi-wei was invested with the post of prefect of the Siao-shan district in Yueh (Chehkiang pr.). In that region many hill-siao lived, playing their tricks in a hundred ways, and nobody had the courage to undertake anything against them ; even the magistrates had to suffer from their attacks, though they worshipped them now and then as gods. But Chi-wei came, and examined where they had their cave-dwellings ; then he prepared a large store of fire-wood, watched for the moment when they were all assembled, piled up the fuel round about, and set fire to it. Meanwhile the crowd stood ready with spears and swords, so that nearly all the siao were burned or killed. Thus for several months every trace of them was effaced from that district."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 44 One day, in the early morning, a stranger appeared at the gate of the city of the district. His cart and horses were covered with dust, and his servants and drivers looked weary and exhausted. Straightway he made up to the prefecture, begged to see the magistrate, and stated he came from Siao-tsao, in the Lan hills. Chi-wei, without any suspicion, immediately invited him to walk in. He sat down, chatted and gossiped with them, joked and jested, and every remark he made was so peerless that Chi-wei bestowed on him the greatest attentions. He even offered him his mansion to stay in. The stranger then spoke : — The road took me through a gorge, where I caught a young monkey, the wit and skill of which are most amusing ; I beg respectfully to offer it to p.505 you. Producing a little box from his bosom, he opened it, and it contained a monkey, not bigger than a chestnut. To and fro it hopped, whirled round and round, and knew and understood the ways of man ; and Chi-wei, struck with admiration, took it in-doors, to boast in his house of this curious thing. But now the monkey jumped upwards, and suddenly changed into a tiger. They could not bolt the door in time ; arms were not at hand, and as Chi-wei closed the gate, everybody was devoured, not one remaining alive (133). On reading such stories, we feel tempted to believe that the Chinese place in their great class of hill-spirits certain quadrumana, besides actual human beings, mountaineers alien to Chinese culture, perhaps a dying race of aborigines, who, occasionally making raids upon their more refined neighbours, were chastised and victimized by merciless mandarins. No doubt the Chinese rank among them human monsters and mongrels which strike the imagination by their oddity, such beings as parade on many pages of the Shan-hai king as inhabitants of the regions real or imaginary, which that work purports to describe. Still another demon-tribe falls under this great category, viz. the so-called ch‘i-mei, or ch‘i and mei."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 45 These beings are mentioned already in the Tso ch’wen. In the p.506 time of the Hia dynasty, this book tells us, certain objects and pictures were employed « to acquaint the people with the malicious tricks of shen, and so, whenever a man entered watery valleys or elevated forests, he did not encounter any such adverse ch‘i-mei and wang-liang (134). In another part of the same work we are informed that Shun, on becoming Yao’s Minister, banished some wicked individuals to four distant regions, ‘there to resist the ch‘i-mei’ (135). From these passages later authors could hardly draw any better inference but that the ch‘i-mei were spirits of the wilderness, akin to the wang-liang, or even perfectly identical with these ; and, in fact, we see them in their writings adhere to this conception very faithfully. It is not impossible, of course, nor even improbable, that the term ch‘i-mei originally, in some dialect or other, denoted spectres in general. It deserves notice that in a section of the Tso ch’wen, where that expulsion of those bad men under Shun’s ministry is related a second time (136), the term is written , the first character in which, sometimes pronounced li, denotes, as we have seen on page 1141 sqq. of Book I, some dragon-like or saurian animal. Possibly it is this fact which occasioned Wang Ch‘ung to write : « Those who give their opinion on the ch‘i, state that they are dragon-like beings ; therefore, as the word mei is copulated to (the name of) a dragon, the mei must be a congener of this animal (137). This hypothesis is readily subscribed to by later authors, but data for verifying its correctness are lacking. In the Cheu li we find the character mei in the shape . « At the summer solstice, this work declares, the clan-officials of the several families make the spirits of the earth and the mei of living beings come up, thus averting from the realm misfortune and dearth (138)."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 46 Ching Khang-ch‘ing assures us in his commentary p.507 upon this passage, that « we have to regard those mei as denoting the shen of all living beings (139), and Hü Shen confirms this. « The mei are the vital spirits (tsing) of old living beings, he wrote, and the character is composed of kwei and , which represent the hairs of the kwei (140). Thus again we see the mountain-ghosts identified with animals and men, for we can hardly take those ‘living beings’ in any other sense. The mysterious hill-tribes, reminiscences of which survive in those and similar traditions, were, of course, distinguished by a variety of names. Some were cannibals. Says the ’Rh ya : « The fei-fei (or, in some southern dialects, hwui-hwui) resemble men. They wear their hair disorderly, are good runners, and anthropophagous (141). We have much earlier mention of such beings in the Shan-hai king : « In the Yuh-fah hills animals live, dog-shaped, with human countenances. They throw with dexterity. Whenever they see men, they laugh. They are named hill-hwui. They move as swiftly as the wind, and when they appear, storms arise in the world*. The same work makes similar statements about these beings in its notes on other unidentified southern countries (142). Kwoh Poh, commenting upon the ’Rh ya, wrote that the fei-fei « have long lips, a black hairy body, and their heels in front, and that they live also in the mountains, from Kiao-chi (Tongking) and Kwangtung and Kwangsi, unto Nan-khang (in northern Kiangsi).

In the north they are styled t‘u-leu (prattlers ?) (144). Contemporaneous and later authors, harping on those ancient traditions, framed some new theories on this amalgam of apes, men, and spectres. One of them wrote in the sixth century : « In Nan-khang shen live, known by the name of hill-tu. They are shaped like men, their size is upward of two chang, their colour is black, their eyes are red, and they have yellow hair. In trees standing far away in the mountains they make their nests, which are shaped like eggs, over three feet in height, well lighted and adorned on the inside, hollow, and of light material. They make therein mattresses of bird’s feathers ; they are united by pairs, that for the male above, and that for the female under it. They can transform themselves and render themselves invisible, so that their shapes are seldom seen. They are beings of the same sort as the tree-dwellers and the hill-siao (145). And Twan Ch‘ing-shih stated : « He who drinks the blood of a fei-fei can become a ghost-seer. They are strong enough to carry weights of a thousand kin on their back. When they laugh, they raise their lip over their forehead. They are shaped as mi-monkeys, and can express themselves as a man in a bird-like voice. They foreknow births and deaths. Their blood is good for dyeing textiles, and their hair may be used for tresses. Of old it was related that they have their heels in front, and huntsmen say they have no knees (146). In the twelfth century, the author of the ’Rh ya yih, resuming the old traditions, wrote : « When the monster catches a man, the first thing it does is to laugh for joy and to p.509 fold its upper lip over its forehead, and after a time it devours him.

The Hwai-nan philosopher says : ‘The mountains produce hiao yang (owls and goats ?), the waters wang-siang, the trees pih-fang, and wells fen-yang’ (147). The learned Li Shi-chen, compiler of the Pen-ts’ao kang muh, devoted in this work (ch. 51, II) the following page to the hill-siao : « Tung Fang-shoh’s Shen i king (148) states that there are in the deep mountains of the western regions men over one chang in size, going naked, and catching frogs and crabs, which they roast over the fires of men to eat. They are called hill-siao, a name by which they style themselves. If a man attacks them, he is smitten with fever. As they are kwei and mei, they are common also elsewhere. They only fear the crackling noise of bamboo exploding in the fire. Liu I-khing says in his Yiu ming lui : In the mountains of the district of Tung-ch‘ang (Shantung pr.) there live in the crags a class of beings resembling men of four or five feet, who go naked and wear their hair dishevelled, letting it grow to a length of five or six inches. They utter screaming and whistling cries, and while keeping themselves unseen, fling stones from time to time out of the gorges. The frogs and crabs they catch they roast on fire before eating them.

They make a sport of stealing away the salt of woodcutters, and eat their roasted rock-crabs with it. p.510 People dare not attack them, for they would not only smite them with disease, but also set fire to their houses.

In the fifth century there existed a tradition, asserting « that the emperor Hwang making a tour of inspection, reached the eastern shore, where the animal of that Water came out of it. It could speak, and thoroughly knew everything about the souls of the myriads of beings, so that it taught him how to avert periodical evils from his people.

They had hitherto lived everywhere. Rendering themselves invisible, they entered human dwellings to commit sexual excesses and disturb peace ; they visited people with disease, committed arson and thefts, and were a great nuisance in houses.

A hole in that old tree contained the nest of a hill-tu. In the first year of the Yuen kia period of the Sung dynasty (A.

Hour after hour passed away, and the music of the count-less flutes was hushed, when suddenly a blast of wind began to bellow, and the gate on the hill-side creaked. ‘The monks must have bolted it badly’, my great-grandfather said to himself ; but no sooner had this thought flashed through his brain than the bellowing wind drew nigh to the dwellings, and the door of his cell flew open. Not knowing in the least what to think of it, he had not yet arranged his ideas when the noise resounded in his cell, and the tramp of boots approaching the inner gate reached his ears. Now he began to feel uneasy, for the inner gate flew open, and turning his eyes, he beheld a large demon pushing through the doorway in stooping     1 Thus, evidently, they simulated a fasting for their dead."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol.

It reached almost to the ridge of the roof ; its face had the colour of an old pumpkin-skin, and with eyes flashing p.515 fire it strode round in the room, glancing from side to side. Its gaping large mouth, rather a basin than a mouth, showed teeth wide apart, more than three ts‘un long ; its tongue moved (outside its mouth) ; guttural chattering cries echoed along the four walls. My great-grandsire’s terror was extreme. ‘With a few feet for room, he said to himself, it is impossible to elude that phantom ; the best course to pursue will be to accept the situation and fight it with the edged weapon’. Gently he drew forth his sword from underneath his pillow, hastily unsheathed it, and aimed a blow at the spectre ; he hit its belly, which gave a sound like an earthen pot. The spectre flew into a passion. It stretched out its huge claws to grasp my great-grandfather, but as he recoiled a little, it got hold merely of the lapel of his gown. With the folds in its claw it ran away furiously, so that my great-grandfather was dragged forward, and fell to the ground, yelling and screaming. The inmates of the building ran together with lights, and finding the door closed, pushed open the window and entered. Their consternation on beholding the scene was great. They placed him on his bed, and on his telling them what had happened, they conjointly examined the spot, and found the lapel squeezed into the chink of the inner gate. They opened this, and inspecting it by the light of their torches, found it covered with marks of claws, running over it like the texture of a sieve, and perforated in every spot which the five fingers had touched. p.516 By that time it was daylight, and my great-grandfather, not daring to stay any longer in that monastery, shouldered his wallet and went home. Afterwards he interrogated the monks, who assured him that nothing particular had happened since (151). "},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 54 This chapter has introduced us to a kind of spectres called pah, explicitly assimilated by early authors with the great class of hill-demons (see pp. 510 and 511), and charged with visiting mankind with drought. We have now for some moments to give our attention to these beings. IV. An Attack of a Mountain-spectre. ‘With a bound he stood before his bed’. Droughts have always harrassed China as a chronic plague. Books from the oldest times mention their prevalence, and special ceremonies to avert them and bring down the rains have always formed an integral part of the religious duties of princes, governors and mandarins. In Book I (pp. 918 sqq.) we were able to demonstrate from original texts, that it always was a conviction in China, traceable in its literature up to the seventh century before"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 55 our era, that such calamities were caused by the souls of unburied dead, this circumstance rendering it of the utmost necessity to the people and its rulers to give a decent interment to neglected bones and skeletons. This fact becomes of increased interest when we collate it with what the Chinese have to tell us of their pah. Like by far the largest number of terms denoting demons and spectres, pah is a word the origin and etymology of which lie hidden in the darkness of the past. An analysis of the character with which it is written (), gives the radical kwei with an element that is apparently phonetic and teaches us nothing. As early as in the Shi king that character occurs, preceded by the word , drought, and ever since in the books of all periods we find this binomium used as a standard name for these spectres. The place in question p.517 in the Shi king is a jeremiad against a prevailing drought, conventionally admitted to have been uttered by the ruler Süen, who occupied the throne of Chen in the ninth and the eighth centuries before Christ. — Excessive, he lamented, is this drought ; dried up are the mountain-hills ; the devils of drought wreak their atrocities, like flames, like scorching fire (152). Thus, if the Chinese are right in ascribing that origin to this ode, the pah haunted their ancestors already in the earliest times which their history records. The pah are mentioned also in the Shan-hai king, in a curious tradition which seems to be the base of later legends on those beings. It runs as follows : « In the vast desert human beings live, dressed in blue ; they are named female pah of the emperor Hwang. When Ch‘i-yiu (Book I, p. 1403) formed an army to fight Hwang, this sovereign ordered Ying-lung to attack it in the wilds of Ki-cheu. This Ying-lung withheld the waters, whereupon Ch‘i-yiu invoked the Lord of Winds and the Rain Master with such effect that gales arose and rains poured down. Now the emperor Hwang sent down a celestial virgin, named Pah ; thus that rainfall was stopped, so that they"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 56 could slay Ch‘i-yiu. Pah then was unable to re-ascend, and wherever she was, rains would not fall. Shuh-kiün reported this to the Throne, on which the emperor (Hwang) assigned to that woman a place on the north of the Red Waters. Thus Shuh-kiün (by his intervention) became the Patriarch of Agriculture, and Pah was banished for the time being. Those who wish to expel her utter this command : — Spirit, depart thou to the north, removing beforehand all obstructions from the aqueducts, and opening the canals and ditches (153). p.518 In ancient China the devils of drought do not seem to have been particularly prominent in the demon-world, for no Classic except the Shi king mentions them. The earliest source which acquaints us with popular conceptions with regard to them, is the Shen i king. « The southern regions, says this work, are inhabited by human beings two or three feet in height, naked, with their eyes on the top of their heads. They run as quick as the wind. Their name is 1. Countries where they appear suffer of great parching. They are also named koh-tszĕ. They move much amidst the people in markets and at meetings, and should these men meet with one and throw it into the privy-pit, it dies, and the drought will vanish. There is an ode (in the Shi king) which runs : ‘The devils of drought wreak their atrocities’. Some declare that if they are caught alive and murdered, misfortune passes away, and happiness ensues. Li Wei-ching, a high official, scholar and historian who lived from circa 1547 to 1626, says in one of his writings :  1 We suppose that this character phonetically represents some dialectic term. The Khanghi Dictionary does not give its sound, this being, it says, unknown. Its radical denotes the order of the Rodentia ; therefore the demons of drought may have some time been conceived to have an animal shape. "},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 57 « it is a positive fact that the pah have their eyes on the top of their head, and the people opine that droughts are a consequence of a fear of Heaven that the falling drops may injure their eyes. Higher powers, as we have hinted on page 918 of Book I, also withhold the rains out of commiseration for the souls of unburied dead. This means so much as that disembodied human souls may be equally devils of drought ; and the inference is ready that they may become so also for other reasons than because their material remains are exposed mercilessly to the inclemencies of the weather. The actuality of this belief is attested by the following tale in the Tszĕ puh yü (ch. 18) : « In the twenty-sixth year of the Khien lung period (1761), when a great drought prevailed in the Metropolis, p.519 a courier, named Chang Kwei, had to carry an urgent dispatch from a Banner General to Liang-hiang. He left the city when the water-clock was sinking. When he was in a lonely place, a black shower suddenly hurtled around him. It blew out his torch, so that he had to take shelter from the rain in the pavilion of a post-house. Here a woman with a lamp joined him. She was about seventeen or eighteen years old, and very beautiful. She beckoned him to her house and refreshed him with tea, and he tied his horse to a post, hoping to pass the night with her. The courier’s happiness exceeded his wildest expectations. He held her in close embrace until the cock announced the first glimpse of day, causing the woman to throw on her clothes and rise. She could not be prevailed upon to stay. The courier, exhausted, fell again into a sweet doze, and became aware in the midst of his dreams that his nose was being cooled by the dew, and his mouth tickled by the points of the grass. And when it was a little clearer, he found himself on a tomb in the open plain. Greatly affrighted he fetched his horse, which he found tied up to a tree. The dispatch he had to convey to its destination arrived there fifty quarters of an hour too late, and the officer to whom it was"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 58 addressed sent a message to the General to ask for an explanation, and to express his sorrow that matters had been managed in a wrong way by reason of that delay. The General ordered his adjutant to interrogate the courier sharply. The detailed account which this man then gave of the causes, induced the General to have that tomb investigated. It was found to be that of a young woman of the Chang family, who had hung herself out of shame at the discovery of the adultery which she had committed in her unmarried state. From time to time her ghost had haunted way-farers, and some took her for the pah of the prevailing drought, whereas spectres in the shape of nao monkeys, with dishevelled p.520 hair and on one leg, are animal pah, while hanged persons whose undecayed corpses appear and bewilder men, are spectral pah. In order to cause rain to fall, it suffices to catch and to burn these. The case having been reported to the Throne, they opened the coffin, and it contained in fact the undecayed corpse of a woman with features like those of a living person, and covered all over with white hair. They burned it, and next day it rained heavily. Cases of corpses exhumed, mutilated or destroyed on the charge of causing a scarcity of rain, we must conclude to be far from rare in China, seeing that its Code of Laws contains a special article forbidding such practices. We gave a translation thereof on page 888 of Book I. Devils of drought having been men, or at any rate possessing a human appearance, it is not surprising to learn from some authors, that certain monstrous births become demons of this character. The Kho t‘an shi ch‘wen, ‘Traditions good for discussion’, a work which belongs, I believe, to the T‘ang or the Sung dynasty, mentions « women who give birth to beings shaped like demons. If such a mother cannot seize and despatch the monster, it flies away, to come back at night and suck her breasts, thus often exhausting her strength. The people declare them to be devils of drought.

V 60 CHAPTER III On Water-Demons @ p.521 The second great division of the demon-world according to Confucius comprised, as we have seen on page 495, the water-ghosts, distinguished as lung or dragons, and wang-siang. The lung, which ancient works class also with the khwei or land-demons (see p. 496 seq.), may be passed unnoticed here, as they have not been retained in China in their old position of demons, but have been apotheosized at an early date as beneficent gods of clouds and rain. Wang-siang looks much like wang-liang which denotes the mountain-spectres of the ancients ; but it would be preposterous to infer from this resemblance the identity of the beings which the two terms denote. If these terms were synonymous, we should certainly not find them in one and the same strophe of the Kwoh yü, which we quoted on page 495, denoting two different categories of spectres. Nevertheless the one term may be a dialectic variation or a corruption of the other, and at any rate it is a fact that Chinese authors generally do not take the trouble to distinguish between them. To the etymology of the word wang-siang the characters with which it is written do not give any clue, not being, as far as we can discern, ideographic. In his commentary upon the Kwoh yü, which we mentioned on page 498, Wei Chao says : « Some pretend that the wang-siang are anthropophagous. They are also called muh-chung. And Yü Pao, when reproducing the story of the earth-goat of Ki Hwan-tszĕ, adds : « The Hia ting chi or Record of Tripods of the Hia says, that a wang-siang looks like a child of three years, has red eyes, a black colour, big ears, and long arms with red claws. Even when fettered with ropes it can find its food (155)."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 61 p.522 Thus this class of spectres was, as well as the mountain-demons, invested by popular belief with human forms ; which coincides with the fact, reported by Wang Ch‘ung, the author of the Lun heng (see p. 499), that they are of human descent, being the progeny of the ancient sovereign Chwen-süh. That author informs us in the same passage, that they were regarded as fever-causing agencies. This peculiarity may have its origin in the observation that malaria arises especially from quagmires and bogs, and in the mud of rivers. References to water-devils are frequent in works of early date. The imagination of the ancient Chinese, peopling, as it did, the surface of the earth with an unlimited number of demons, had every reason to do the same with the waters, seeing that these too are an integral part of the earth. « The waters, we read in the writings attributed to Kwan Chung, who lived more than twenty-five centuries ago, are the lifeblood of the earth, which courses through it like arteries and pulses (156). And he continues : « things which mankind sees sometimes, produce khing-ki, and things which remain sometimes unseen engender the kwei. When the bed of a quagmire is not displaced for centuries, and its waters are not absent from it all that time, it produces khing-ki. These are shaped like men. Their height is four ts‘un ; they wear yellow clothes with caps of the same colour, and carry yellow umbrellas. They ride on colts, and like to galop with great velocity. By calling them by their names they may be made to bring in one day tidings from a place more than a thousand miles off. Such are the spirits (tsing) of muddy bogs. The tsing of shallow brooks are produced by the kwei, that is to say, by beings with one head and a double body, who are like snakes, eight feet long. By calling them by their names you may employ them for catching fish and turtles. Such are the tsing of dry brooks (157). p.523 Those khing-ki must not be confounded with a high minister of the same name who flourished under Hoh Lü, king of Wu, and was killed in the"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 62 second year of the reign of this prince (513 B. C.). He too is represented in history as a great runner. « The king said of him : — Notorious among mankind he is for his strength ; his sinews and bones are so robust that ten thousand men cannot stand their ground against him. He overtakes animals in full galop, and he seizes birds in their flight ; his bones then soar through the air, and his flesh flies ; there are then distances of several hundred miles between his knees. I have pursued him in the Kiang region, but my galoping team of four did not overtake him ; I shot at him, but he, I know not how, caught my arrows in his hand and could not be hit (158). Such stories may have grouped themselves around this person owing to the similarity of his name to that of Kwan Chung’s water-ghosts ; or he may have been nicknamed a khing-ki on account of his swiftness. The Wu Yueh ch‘un-ts‘iu, to which we owe the above particulars about that Khing-ki the Swift, teaches us also that in king Hoh Lü’s time water-demons were by no means slighted as inoffensive beings. It relates that Wu Tszĕ-sü said to that king : — Tsiao Khiu-yin was a superior man from Tung-hai. Travelling as an envoy from the king of Ts‘i to the state of Wu, he had to pass a ferry on the Hwai river, and would let his horse drink at it, when the ferry-man said : ‘There is a god (shen) in the water, which when it sees a horse, comes out to harm it ; do not let yours drink there, sir’. ‘A sturdy warrior is proof against this danger, his answer was ; what gods dare attack me ?’ and he told his men to let the horse drink at the ferry ; but the demon seized the animal and drowned it. Tsiao Khiu-yin, enraged, stripped and seized his sword, and he entered the water to seek the god and fight it. He re-appeared after several days with one eye blinded, and pursued his journey to Wu (159)."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 63 p.524 In the time of the Tsin dynasty there was a tradition rife, according to which the great Yü, the founder of the Hia dynasty, « while inspecting the Hwang-ho, had seen a giant with the body of a fish, who, emerging from the water, said : — I am the spirit of the Hwang-ho. Fung-i from Tung-hiang in the Hwa-yin region (Shensi pr.) having obtained the Tao of the Immortals, was transformed into a director of the Hwang-ho. This immortal Fung-i rides on a dragon or a tiger, while the watergods ride fishes and dragons. They move with mad haste, ten thousand miles being to them not more than the width of a house (160). Thus Fung-i was the chief and leader of the host of spirits which crowd China’s biggest stream. We find an old reference to him in the writings of Chwang-tszĕ, which state : « When Fung-i had obtained the Tao, he availed himself of it to journey on the big streams (161). His name occurs in the shape in the Shan-hai king (162). We may fairly confess that his origin is lost in the night of time. With some more water-spirits he is generally classed among the beneficent gods, who, far from causing ill, temper and repress the maleficent aquatic powers under their control, or make them work on behalf of man. Thus we must treat them afterwards, in our monographies of gods and goddesses. The old superstition which ascribes accidents that befall those who cross a stream, mere or lake, to water-demons, comes out in numerous tales and legends of all times. To quote here one as an instructive example : « In the district of Puh-wei, in the principality of Yung-ch‘ang (pr. of Yunnan), there was under the Han dynasty a tabooed water, having a poisonous vapour. Only in the eleventh month and in the twelfth it might be crossed or waded, but from the first month till the tenth it might not, or it would p.525 smite with sudden sickness and death those who did so. There were in that vapour evil beings"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 64 which never showed themselves, but seemed to produce sounds as if they were fighting therein. If a tree was hit by them it snapped, and if a man, he was killed, and the people spoke of their demonish bullets. Those attacks caused all the criminals of that principality who were transported to the forbidden spot, to die before the tenth day (163). Nowadays the belief in spirits inhabiting seas, fiords and creeks, rivers, meres, marshes and wells, is general. We have seen its prevalence in the Amoy region strikingly illustrated by the custom of appeasing and propitiating them by means of paper money when people are passing over water with a coffin on the way to the grave (Book I, p. 154), and also by throwing for the same purpose money into wells from which they draw water to wash their dead (Book I, p. 14). The common opinion in that part of China is, that those tsúi-kúi or ‘water-spectres’ mostly are souls of the drowned. Having spent some time in their wet abode in the bondage of the watergods, they may be redeemed from this servitude by substitution, and therefore they lie in ambush for victims to draw into the water and make them take their place. Thus they are a constant lurking danger for people on the waterside, fishers, boatmen and washer-women. They blow hats into the water, or bleaching linen, or other articles, and while the owner exerts himself to recover his, property, they treacherously keep the thing just outside his reach, until he loses his equilibrium and falls into a watery grave. It is told in a book, « that outside the gate of Wu-lin (near Hang-cheu, in Chehkiang) a family, settled on the dyke of the western lake, had an old servant, who fetched water after sunset and saw at some distance a wine-jar floating part with the current. Thinking it would be useful for holding things, he desired to get it, and suddenly it floated towards him till it was just before him ; but p.526 as he seized it, his fore-arm was against his will pulled into the mouth, which closing around it, dragged him into the water. His cries of distress brought people to the rescue, who released him from his precarious position (164)."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 65 Should a corpse be found on the silt, its arms or legs worked deep into the mud, every one is sure to believe it a victim of a water-ghost, drawn down by those limbs with irresistible force. Cramps paralyzing a swimmer are likewise the clutches of a ghost. When a man is suddenly missed and found dead in the water, every one is ready to tell that a water-ghost decoyed him away from his house by some artifice, and drowned him : ‘a water-spectre has called some one to take its place’ : tsúi-kúi kiò kao-t‘òe ; or ‘it has seized a substitute’ : liáh kao-t‘òe. It has been asserted (165) that the natives are often unwilling to help a drowning man or any one in absolute peril of life, fearing that the spirit of the person who perished last before him and is longing for relief by a substitution, will haunt the person whose humanity has condemned it to a fresh term of dismal servitude. We must, however, demur to the correctness of this statement, for we could never discover in Fuhkien a trace of such unwillingness, while, moreover, all the Chinese we interrogated on this head, protested against their humanity being thus called in question. On the great rivers there exist even life-saving societies, possessing boats and implements for the rescue of the drowning. The belief that ghosts of drowned men catch substitutes, is by no means one of recent growth, but prevailed very long ago. « The Memoirs concerning the Sung-kiang Department (in southeast Kiangsu) relate : In the Wan lih period (A. D. 1573-1620) there lived in the western suburb at the upper end of a creek where boats were repaired, a fisherman. One night he heard a spectre say : — I have endured this miserable fate for a year, and p.527 now I can get a substitute, but this is a woman in the family way, and I do not feel at liberty to destroy the two lives. Next morning a woman slipped into the water, but she was drawn out safe and sound ; she was, indeed, in the seventh month of pregnancy. Another year passed away, when the fisherman again heard the spectre say :"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 66 — The man who is now to take my place has scanty means, and heavy responsibilities rest on him ; if he dies, his whole family becomes homeless and will be dispersed ; I had better wait yet a year. And next morning a man fell from the bridge, but he too escaped with his life. Then again that same evening the spectre applied to the fisherman for some food. — Twice, it said, I have had a noble thought, and the gods have apprised the Supreme Emperor (of Heaven) of it, who thereupon has ordered that I shall no more have to beg here for food’. The fisher said he hoped so, and in the evening of the next day the spectre returned to take leave of him, and announced to him its appointment as Manager of the soil in Mao-khiao. Still older are the two following tales from a book of the tenth century 1 : « On the banks of the Yang-tszĕ river and the Hwang-ho there are many ch‘ang demons, who now and then call a man by his surname and his name. If he answers, he is sure to be drowned, it being the soul of a dead man that decoys p.528 him (into the stream). One Li Tai-jen had moored his boat in a bend of the shore in the Chi-kiang district (in South Hupeh, on the Yang-tszĕ) and saw in the bright moonlight a damsel with a boy emerge from the water. She gazed around, and then whispering ‘yonder is a living man’, she hurried off over the water as if on solid ground, went ashore, and disappeared. Su Jui, prefect of Tang-yang (north of Chi-kiang), once, when in Kiang-ling (King-cheu), was going home at night, and saw by the  1 Namely the Poh mung so yen or Fragmentary Communications from my Dreams in the North, i. e. north of the Yang-tszĕ, in King-cheu, where the author resided. This work, in twenty charters, is ascribed to Sun Kwang-hien, also named Meng-wen, a high official under the founder of the Sung dynasty. It deals mostly with officers and official life under the T‘ang Dynasty and the Five dynasties, and is reputed among scholars to contain much of genuine historical value.

He asked her jokingly : — Are not you a river-ch‘ang ? This question infuriated the woman, and with the words : — You say I am a spectre ?, she ran after him. He ran away with all speed, till he fell in with a patrol of watchmen, who saw the woman turn her back on them and go by the same way she had come (166). We learn from these two tales, that souls of the drowned are styled ch‘ang . This term indicates also the souls of victims of tigers, which popular belief represents as urging these monsters to devoir new victims, in order that the spirits of these may take their place in the bondage in which they are held by the tiger, and thus deliver them therefrom. We shall meet these ch‘ang anew on pp. 554 sqq. As illustrations of the modern notions on water-spectres, we offer the reader here a couple of tales from the Tszĕ puh yü. « Chang Hung-yeh, my cousin by the mother’s side, lodged in Ts‘in-hwai in a house of the family Fan, built on the river. In a summer-night he went to the privy. The water-clock had sunk. to the mark of the third watch and all human sounds were hushed, and, as. the moon shone bright, he leaned for a moment over the balustrade, charmed by its lovely light. There he heard a rippling noise in the water, perceiving at the same time a p.529 human head coming up to the surface. Astonished to see a swimmer at this untimely hour, he looked at it attentively, and saw that neither its eyes nor eyebrows were marked with black. The creature reared itself straight up in the water, rigid, with a neck as immovable as that of a wooden image. Chang threw a stone at it, on which it sunk back into the water. Next day in the afternoon a lad was drowned by that spot, and then it was no longer doubtful that that apparition was a water-demon."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 68 As he related this event to some fellow lodgers, a rice-dealer amongst them told them, that water-ghosts are curious fellows searching for human lives. In his early years, when a rice-dealer in Kia-hing (Chehkiang pr.), he had to cross a yellow mud canal, which he did on a buffalo, the mire being deep. When just in the middle of the pool, a black hand was protruded from it to grasp his foot. But as he drew up his legs, the hand seized that of the buffalo, preventing the animal from stirring. Struck with fright, the rice-merchant called the passers-by to the rescue. All hands combined to pull the buffalo forward, but the beast did not move ; they therefore singed its tail with fire, on which, unable to endure the pain, it dragged itself out of the mud by a sudden exertion of its whole strength. An old broom was then found tied to its belly, so fast that it could not be detached. It was even hardly possible to approach, so rotten and so filthy it was. They struck it off with sticks, and during this operation it made a moaning noise, while a liquid trickled out of it — mere black blood. Having cut the thing off with knives, they fetched fuel and burned it, but the stench was not gone in a month. Since that time there were no more cases of suffocation in that yellow mud canal (167). p.530 « In Hwui-ki, one Wang ’Rh, a dress-maker, passed after sunset along the Heu hills with some female garments in his hands, when he saw two men in a state of nature, with black faces, jump forth from the water. They pulled him into the river, and he, unable to resist, followed them, when on a sudden, after a few steps, another being with pendent eyebrows and a tongue protruding from its mouth, came flying down out of the pines on the hill. In its hands it held a long rope, which it slung around Wang ’Rh’s waist, to pull him ashore ; but thus a contest arose with the black-faced spectres. — He is our substitute, the latter cried, why do you rob us of him ? But he with the rope retorted :"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 69 — Wang ’Rh is a master-tailor, and you are river-demons living with naked buttocks in the water ; you wear no clothes at all, on what tasks then will you employ him ? you had better give him to me. And Wang ’Rh perceived through his faintness that they pulled him to and fro between them. He was conscious a little, and said to himself : ‘If these woman’s clothes are lost, all my labours will not avail to pay their value, and he hung them on a tree. Just then his uncle was going home by another path. Astonished to see in the moonshine woman’s clothes, green and red, on a tree, he came nearer to see, and the three spectres dispersed, leaving Wang ’Rh with his mouth and ears stuffed with blue mud. His uncle took him home, and thus in the nick of time saved him from death (168). p.531 Tales of water-demons possessed of more or less power to work evil, have been recorded in Chinese literature in considerable numbers. Many are very wild and absurd. Thus, « the fisherman Li Holf-t‘ah, who always cast out his nets in the Yang-tszĕ, hauled up a child, some three feet in height. It made the water in the net foam up wildly, and the whirls it caused were not calmed in ten days. A Taoist doctor witnessed it. — Pour out some molten iron there, he said ; the other did it, and the whirls came to a standstill. It was observed that the child’s mouth, nose, eyebrows and hairs all looked as if painted, and that it had no eyes ; its mouth smelt of liquor. The crowd in their consternation threw it back into the water (169). « And one Yao, serving in the Tsing-hai army in Tung-cheu (?), was at the head of some of his footmen fishing in the sea for a certain instalment of annual tribute, when it grew dusk before they had caught more than a very small quantity of fish.

But Yao retorted : — No, he is a divine being, and mishap will on the contrary befall us if we kill him. He then disentangled him from the net, and invoked him, saying : — If you bring shoals of fish here for me, and thus save me from punishment for falling short in the work imposed on me by my office, I will believe you are a god. On these p.532 words the hairy man made some dozen steps back over the water and sank out of sight. Next morning they caught a large haul of fish, twice as much as they were wont to catch in other years (170). No doubt every part of China possesses special notions and superstitions on water-devils, not always reduced to writing. We have obtained some from the lips of seamen in coasting along the Fuhkien shores. Sometimes in full sea a compact cloudy mass suddenly darkens the horizon. It nears the ship with great rapidity, to capsize her and drown her crew. It is no tornado, no waterspout, no squall, but the spirit of a woman, once a sailor’s lovely wife. Her husband, most unworthy of her, treated her ignominiously, even cruelly, until, preferring death to such a life, she cast herself into the vasty deep. Since then she rages at sea, a wrathful demon, against every junk she sees, in the hope that her husband may be amongst the crew and be sunk into her own watery grave. Happily there are efficient means to combat her. First of all all the hatches must be closed ; indeed, she is so unmannerly as to pass on high a flood of urine, which may fill the ship in a moment up to the deck. Therefore Amoy sailors call her the ts‘oā jiō pô, the Pissing Woman. But still more measures are to be taken. As soon as this nymph appears, paper mock"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 71 money must be burned on the deck, in order to propitiate her and appease her wrath ; crackers and blunderbusses must be fired to scare her away, and one of the crew in the garb of nature has to climb the mast, his hair dishevelled, with a club, axe, sword or spear. This weapon he brandishes up there most awe-inspiringly, abusing the woman in every way and sense, and exhausting his vocabulary of invectives to the last word ; no wonder that the fair Naiad, sure to see and hear her lovely goodman of former days, takes fright and decamps. Meanwhile p.533 another sailor in a black gown with long, spacious sleeves has taken up a position on the deck, and is pacing a kind of dance to the sound of a gong beaten by a comrade. During these exorcising movements he brandishes a stick, from the top of which some shreds of red cloth flutter in the gale. By these efficacious and dignified evolutions he greatly aids the prowess of his undressed comrade up the mast. Success certainly crowns their efforts, for they do not cease until the dangerous phantom withdraws and the shower clears off. Such ship-saving dancers the Amoy Chinese call bú tik khò. There is one on each junk that plies, especially enrolled to exorcise the Pissing Woman, but performing sailor’s work in good weather times. The dances require special study and training, their effect being nought unless performed with all the finesse of art. A bú tik khò receives extra pay for all ship-saving work he does. Another dreaded demon. of the Amoy seamen is the hái hê-siūng or ‘sea-bonze’. This resembles a fish, but its head is like that of a bald-shaved Buddhist priest. It may be a seal or dugong. When the sea is rough, this monster seizes junks and capsizes them, or drags them down into the deep, crew and all. Against this demon also the bú tik khò is set to work with his stick, gown, and dances ; moreover, some handfulls of feathers are burned on the deck, for the stench of these is bad enough to make even a sea-devil turn tail. With a view to the visits of sea-bonzes, every supercargo who combines belief with prudence, takes good care to have one or two small bags of feathers in the ship. Cases are known of dozens of small sea-monks having been caught in one net, looking up to the fishermen in the attitude of praying Buddhist priests, as if imploring their mercy. How great are the dangers with which sea-devils beset poor seafaring folk, the following tale will tell :"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 72 « A certain Ch‘ing Chi-chang of Hang-cheu was under sail from Ch‘ao-cheu and passed Hwang-kang, when halfway the voyage a gale arose. A black vapour came up of a sudden, and in the midst of it a man was seen, painted black all over, but his eye-sockets and his lips were as white as flour. He settled on the bow of the ship and blew at the sailors. These, thirteen in number, turned at the same moment as black in their faces as the spectre itself, and only three of them were not thus coloured ; then in a few moments the vapour dissipated, and the apparition vanished. The ship p.534 proceeded on her voyage amid violent storm and heavy seas ; she capsized, and ten men were drowned, namely all those who had changed colour. The three who had not suffered the change were the sole survivors (171). By far the greatest contingent to the class of water-devils is made by aquatic animals. We find among them otters or beavers, tortoises, gavials or crocodiles, and fishes, occasionally in human shape or in their own ; but a rational arrangement of our material compels us to treat them in Chapter V, 5, 7 and 9. @"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 73 CHAPTER IV On Ground-Demons @ p.535 Finally we come to the last of the three categories into which the ancient Chinese have divided their world of spectres, namely those inhabiting the ground, which, as we have seen on page 495, were called fen-yang in the time of Confucius and thought to have a goat-like shape. Of the story, related in the Kwoh yü, how Ki Hwan-tszĕ discovered a fen-yang in the ground (page 495), a strange version is stated to have been written two centuries before our era by Han Ying ‘in a collection of anecdotes from ancient times, embellished and illustrated by odes which, side by side with other documents all now lost, have furnished material for the compilation of the Shi king under the Han dynasty. According to that book, now printed in ten chapters and bearing the title of Han-shi wai ch‘wen, Han’s extra Traditions concerning the Odes, « Ngai, the ruler of Lu, ordered a well to be dug. In three months they had not yet reached the watersprings, but they found a living goat. The ruler ordered his Invokers to operate on it with drums and dances, in order to send it up (as a sacrifice ?) to heaven, but the goat could not be sent up. Confucius saw the animal and said : — The vital spirit (tsing) of water is jade stone, and that of earth is a goat ; so this goat must have an earthen liver. The ruler ordered the animal to be killed, and they found its liver to be of earth 1. It appears strange that this gnome was represented as a goat. p.536 We find nothing in any book to account for it. Possibly the word fen-yang may, fundamentally, not have meant goat, but being written, as in the Kwoh yü  1 This tale does not occur in the copy we have on our shelves. We quote it from the T S, sect.*, ch. 113."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 74 version, with the characters signifying some goat or sheep because, as at present, the word yang denoted the genus Capra, the Chinese, deluded by appearance, may have imagined a fen-yang to be a specimen thereof. That, originally, fen-yang did not mean sheep, is suggested also in some degree by its appearance in some works without the first component having the prefix . In a biography of Confucius which occurs in the Historical Records (172), it has the prefix , earth, which, without modifying its sound, gives it the meaning of a grave (comp. p. 1073 of Book I), so that in this form () the binomium is translateable by ‘grave-goat’. The beast seems, indeed, to have been connected with graves in subsequent times, for we find in the third century goats or sheep play a part in the imagination of the people as devourers of the buried dead. We have stated this fact already on page 468 of Book I. We there learned two other names for those necrophagous demons, viz. ngao and wei , which may be local terms, the characters by which they are written not being ideographic. Thus simple-minded people, having from days of yore been Kent on keeping the dead in their graves uncorrupted, and yet finding them there regularly eaten away in a mysterious manner, ascribed this phenomenon to the teeth of underground beasts, unable, as they were, rationally to explain natural decomposition. P‘ei Yin asserts in the commentary which he wrote in the fifth century upon the Historical Records, that « according to T‘ang Ku, the fen-yang were beings with undeveloped sexuality (173). The sexless or hermaphroditic beast was, as Wang Ch‘ung has taught us (supra, p. 499), the progeny of an ancient emperor, haunting houses and ruins, and afflicting babies with convulsions. Besides this statement, Wang Ch‘ung inserted in his valuable book the following interesting notice on this class of spectres : « If it is true that the spirits who inhabit the soil object to it being disturbed and dug up, then it is proper for us to select special good days for digging ditches and ploughing our fields. (But this is never done) ; it therefore follows that the spirits of p.537 the soil, even"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 75 though really annoyed when it is disturbed, pals over such an offence if man commits it without evil intent. As he commits it merely to ensure his rest and comfort, the act cannot possibly excite any anger against him in the perfect heart of those spirits ; and this being the case, they will not visit him with misfortune even if he do not choose auspicious days for it. But if we believe that the earth-spirits cannot excuse man on account of the object he pursues, and detest him for annoying them by disturbing the ground, what advantage then can he derive from selecting proper days for doing so (174) ? Thus we learn that in the first century of our era the earth-spirits, except on certain selected days, did not tolerate any digging in the ground, and exacted vengeance for so doing. We find this superstition illustrated as follows : « The T‘ai p‘ing yü lan has the following quotation from the Sin yen of P‘ei Yuen : Amidst the people there are spirits, called lords of the earth, and they say that the soil may not be stirred. I, P‘ei Yuen, possess a grand-daughter, five years old, who suddenly became ill. I went to the diviner in the bazaar, who told me that she had offended the soil. Forthwith I applied to her the remedies usual in such cases, which effected her total cure. Ever since I have been convinced that there exist ground-spirits in this world 1. In these extracts the gnomes appear under the names of ti shen and t‘u shen, ‘spirits of the ground or the earth’. They are generally so denoted in the books. We have seen on page 499 p.538 that in Wang Ch‘ung’s age they were deemed to reside also in objects attached firmly to the ground, as in dwellings and ruinous buildings, in corners and nooks. With all these characteristics they survive in China to the present day. In Amoy and the surrounding farming-districts the existence of earth-spectres, locally called t‘ó sîn or ‘earth-spirits’, is an implicit article of the  1 T‘ung suh pien, Book on the Investigation of Customs, a cyclopaedia in thirty-eight chapters bearing the name Cheu T‘ien-tu for its author. Our edition is dated 1751. "},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 76 popular creed. The belief in them there bears, as may be the case everywhere in China, the clearest marks of the influence of the philosophical conception that the soil is the productive part of the Universe, which, fecundated by the celestial sphere, engenders everything that has life. In the Cosmos the soil represents perfect stability, and for this propensity it is able to bring forth vegetation. A natural conclusion is, that if the soil is disturbed, the repose and growth of the embryo in the womb of women is, by the law of sympathy, disturbed too. Therefore, still more often than by the term t‘ó sîn, the Amoy Chinese denote those spectres by that of t‘ai sîn, ‘spirits of the womb or fruit’. Their baneful influence extends even to babies already born, these just as well as vegetable products being dependent for their growth on life-producing earth. It is the t‘ai sîn that cause the convulsions, restlessness, and other ailments to which infants are so subject, and everybody feels sure that, should a child fall into the clutches of such a spirit, it will forthwith turn blue or black. Especially, however, the t‘ai sîn are notorious for causing the pains of pregnancy. These are usually called tāng t‘ai or t‘ai tang, ‘displacements or movements of the fruit’, and ascribed to the shifting of some earth, some heavy object, or piece of furniture. Such agitation of the foetus may assume serious proportions, and entail miscarriage. The fear of such a result restrains a man from many imprudent acts, should his wife or concubine be pregnant. Especially perilous it is then to drive a nail into a wall, as it might nail down the earth-spirit that resides in it, and cause the child to be born with a limb stiff and lame, or blind of one eye ; or it might paralize the bowels of a child already born, and give it constipation with fatal result. The dangers which threaten a pregnant woman, increase as her pregnancy advances. In the end nothing which is heavy may be displaced in the house, it being well known that the earth-spirits are wont to settle preferably in things which, owing to their weight, are seldom moved. But even the shifting p.539 of light objects is a source of danger. Instances are known of fathers who had rolled up their bed-mat after it had long lain flat, being frightened by the birth of a child with a rolled-up ear. One day I saw a boy with a harelip, and was told by the father that his wife, when pregnant of"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 77 this child, had thoughtlessly made a scissure in an old coat of his, while repairing it. In a small obstetrical handbook circulating in Amoy under the title of Kwang sheng pao kien, ‘Precious Mirror for the Furtherance of Childbirth’, we find it explicitly stated, that a pregnant woman « may not witness the beginning of any works connected with the reparation or erection of buildings, nor any grubbing in the ground (175). On another page of that book we read : « A work entitled Necessary Knowledge for the Furtherance of Childbirth says : Among the matters which do not promote procreation of offspring, the moving and displacing of objects certainly causes calamities. Repairs performed at a neighbour’s house or at one’s own, or the stirring of the ground, produce evil effects upon the breath or soul of the unborn fruit, and are apt to destroy its body and injure its life. But that infliction of injury with a sharp instrument should wound the foetus, or injury done to the soil should close its apertures, or beating or kicking things should render the foetus blue and black, or the binding together of things should cause its limbs to be cramped or stiffened — such sayings are groundless stories of doctors of (occult) science, and not one in a hundred having a good foundation, they must not be believed. But what women in the family way must never see, is the first commencement of any works or repairs, pounding or battering, and the stirring of the ground ; it is advisable for them to absent themselves carefully from such works (176). Thus the commotion created among the earth-spirits by repairs p.540 of edifices or by earth-labours seems especially perilous for pregnant women at the beginning of the works. In fact, when at Amoy any one undertakes something of the kind, the neighbours take good care to seek lodgings elsewhere for their women who are expecting confinement, not allowing them to return ere the works are fairly advanced and the disturbed spirits have had time to re-settle in their old seats. In default of a suitable place to shelter"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 78 such a woman, public opinion, I was assured, absolutely obliges the builder to delay till after her confinement. It is not only earth-ghosts that cause abortive pregnancy. Every demon may do this, even by actually fecundating the woman and rejoicing her heart with a pregnancy which, after long duration, results in nothing. On this point we shall have more to say in Chapter XIV. The gnomes of our western folklore, guardians of mysterious underground treasures, are very slightly represented in China’s Demonology. We may ascribe this to the fact that mining never was of great significance there. All we have found concerning them amounts to the following strange narrative : « Celestial roes are no men, but belong to the class of kiang si or corpse-demons (see Ch. X). Yunnan province has many mines from which five kinds of metal are extracted. If they collapse, preventing the miners from getting out, then, if these men are fed for ten years or even for a hundred by the breath of the earth and of those metals, their bodies do not decay. Though they are not dead, their material substance is dead. It being underground perpetual night for those who work those mines, these men mostly carry a lamp on their forehead. When, while working their way into the ground, they fall in with a celestial roe, this is entranced with joy. Complaining of cold, it asks them for some tobacco, which it smokes immediately ; then it prostrates itself upon the ground, entreating the men to take it out of the mine. In reply the miners say : — We have come here for gold and silver, and we have not yet discovered any veins from which to procure some ; do you know where the gold grows ? And the celestial stag guides them to a mine where they can reap a rich harvest. But on leaving the mine, they delude the spectre, saying : — We must get out first, and then we shall take you out of the shaft with the lift."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 79 And by the rope fastened to the bamboo lift they haul the creature up, but halfway they cut the rope, letting it fall down and die. It has occurred that the men in charge of the mine-sheds p.541 were more benevolent and compassionate, and hauled up some seven or eight of those beings. But as soon as these felt the wind, their clothes, flesh and bones changed into a liquid giving out a rancid, putrid stench, which smote with contagious disease all those whose olfactory nerves it affected, so that they died. This is the reason why, ever since, those who haul up celestial stags cut the rope, lest they have to endure again that stench and lose their lives. Should they refuse to haul them up, they risk being molested by them incessantly. It is also said, that when a small number of celestial stags are overpowered by a great number of men, tied, placed against an earthen wall, and immured firmly on the four sides with walls of clay, a sort of terrace with a lamp being built overhead, they will do no further harm. But if men are outnumbered by stags, they are tormented to death by these, and not allowed to escape (177). @"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 80 CHAPTER V On Animal-Demons @ p.542 The three preceding chapters have demonstrated, that from the earliest times to which the written products of China enable us to ascend, spectres have often been represented in that country in animal forms. We have, in fact, found dragons and goats among them, apes or monkeys, and stags, and we may then reasonably expect to find a very large contingent contributed to China’s demon-world in all times and ages by the animal kingdom in general. To comprehend adequately the rationality of this phenomenon we only have to realize another, already brought out in this Book in strong relief, to wit, that spectres generally are represented in the shape of man and with his characteristics and attributes, while at the same time animals are not in Chinese mind and thought essentially different from men. If a man can be a spectre, why then cannot an animal be a spectre as well ? Philosophy implicitly decreed since olden times that beasts have the same natural constitution as man, both being built up, body and soul, of the same yang and yin substances of which the Universe itself consists. But while identification of spectres with men remained the prevailing conception, the investment of animal-spectres with human attributes was the result. Men, as well during their lives as after, may assume animal forms with malicious intent ; but, conversely, animals may transform themselves into men with no more kindly object. Such metamorphoses may be bodily, but hardly ever seem to come about but for the co-operation of the soul. Such animal-spectres do not differ from the ordinary were-beasts we have described in our chapter on Zoanthropy (pp. 156 sqq.), except in the possession of a large dose of manifest malignity, which seems, indeed, the only feature entitling them to a place in the world of demons."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 81 The belief in animals haunting as spectres would hardly seem p.543 possible if there were no conviction that their souls may show themselves outside their bodies in the same shape as these. Numerous places in Chinese books attest that such a conviction prevails, but the two following tales may suffice to prove it : « Sun Hiu of the Wu dynasty 1 having a patient, sought an exorcist (hih) and seer. Having found one, and wishing to put him to the test, he killed a goose, buried it in the open plain, constructed a little shed over the spot, and placed a couch therein, with female shoes and clothing upon it. Then he told the man to examine that spot. — If you can tell me the shape of the woman who abides as a ghost in yonder grave, he said, I will bestow a rich reward on you, and believe in your capacities immediately. But the man uttered no word in the course of that day. The emperor then repeated his question with more emphasis. — To speak truly, came the answer, I see no ghost ; a white goose standing on the tomb is all I see. I did not tell this immediately, for it might be a kwei or shen that took this form, and I had to wait until its true shape should re-establish itself ; but as, for some reason unknown to me, it does not re-assume its other shape, I now dare tell Your Majesty the truth (178). « When the Minister of Agriculture Yang Mai was young, he was fond of hunting. He himself tells us, that when hawking in the fields during his stay at Ch‘ang-ngan, he saw a hare hop about in the shrubs at some distance from him. His falcon too perceived the animal, and immediately flew to the spot to catch it, but when it came there, there was nothing at all. Yang Mai took the bird on his cuff, and having proceeded several paces, looked behind him at the same spot, and again he saw the hare run there. As before, the hawk swooped upon it, but likewise p.544 without catching it ; and  1 The emperor King ; he reigned from A. D. 258-263."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 82 the same thing taking place a third lime, Yang Mai ordered his men to cut the herbage away and seek for the hare. They then found its skeleton, so that they had had to do with a hare’s ghost (179). The literature of China is rich in tales of animal-devils in all forms and shapes. Mammals, birds, fishes and insects are represented as transporting their souls into men, thus infecting these with disease or making them mad ; they also emit their souls from their bodies to disquiet villages and dwellings. Koh Hung was convinced that especially old animals might become devils in a human shape, and he gave expression to this opinion in a passage we have translated on page 162. We shall see that his view was generally shared, and is set forth frequently in the legends and traditions which have served us for the composition of this Chapter. Since there are hardly any animals in China which play a part of some importance in human life without doing this also as demons under some aspect or other, a large amount of material illustrative of Demonism is supplied to the student who explores the written zoological mythology of that part of the earth. 1. Tiger-Demons @ The royal tiger we find foremost in China on the list of animal-demons. He is, indeed, its most ferocious brute, distributed over almost its whole area, the terror of its people, often throwing villages into general commotion and panic, or compelling country-people to remove to safer spots. The reader knows from page 160 that early Chinese literature mentioned man-tigers as ravening demons. Tales preserved in the books of every age prove that the belief in such spectres has always prevailed. And that this belief is not extinct at present, is sufficiently attested by the fact that such tiger-lore is continually reprinted, read, and transmitted by mouth ; moreover, a somewhat intimate acquaintance with p.545 Chinese soon convinces us, that tiger-tales are generally taken for actual events, as, in truth, is the case with everything which is transmitted by the writings of by-gone days. Many such tales reveal new and interesting points in tiger-lore. Hence the small"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 83 collection inserted in the following pages will be found useful also as a supplement to the dissertation on Tigroanthropy, which we have written pp. 163 sqq. of this Book. Folk-lore represents tiger-demons as metamorphosed men ravening over large areas. « Ch‘en Tsung, a native of Tan-yang, T‘ao-Ts‘ien relates, exercised the profession of diviner near the chief city of that district. In the I hi period (A. D. 405-419), when Tan Heu, a general of the left division, who was very fond of the chase and occupied himself much with tiger-hunting, was governor of Ku-shuh 1, it happened that a rider wearing fur breeches, followed by another in similar dress, came to that soothsayer with some ten coins wrapped in paper. — Must we go westward to find something to eat, they asked, or is the easterly direction the best ? Tsung laid out a combination of divining-stalks, thereupon consulted it, and declared the easterly direction to be auspicious, but the other (where the formidable Nimrod lived) unprofitable. Still the men asked him for some drink, and put their mouths inside the cups after the manner of cows that drink ; then they left the diviner’s house and went on in the easterly direction, but no sooner were they some hundred paces off than the follower and his horse both changed into tigers. And since then tigers ravened in the country with extraordinary fierceness (180). Who shall count the hapless men who, suspected of being tigers in disguise, have fallen victims to fear and exasperation ? p.546 And how many times has this vulgar credulity been aroused against objects of hatred, in order to get them lynched ? A man-tiger despatched by the mob was Wang Yung, whose story we gave on page 177. Another victim was the poor heroine of the following tale :  1 Ku-shuh and Tan-yang were parts of the present T‘ai-p‘ing department on the Yang-tszĕ, in Nganhwui province. The city of T‘ai-p‘ing is the first on the river above Nanking."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 84 « About the end of the rule of the Liang dynasty (circ. A. D. 556), Hwang Khien, a Shi-hing man (in the north of Kwangtung), had a younger sister, named Siao-chu or Little Pearl, affianced to a native of the same district, who answered to the name of Li Siao. Little Pearl accompanied her brother’s wife into the mountains to gather tree-seeds. They passed by a temple, where Little Pearl felt so great an attraction exercised upon her, that she refused to go home. And when on the way home, she ran away alone up the road to the temple, hurrying into the shrubs at the sight of people. Hwang Khien’s wife apprised Li Siao of the incident, who concluded from it that the girl must have some ulterior object. One night he was returning with a comrade from the district magistrate, by whom he was summoned, when the two men were surprised by a shower of rain, and perceiving a fire in an apartment of the temple, resorted thither to dry their clothes. They discovered some worn clothes on the raised platform which bore the image of the god, and after a moment heard the sound of footsteps outside. Affrighted, they concealed themselves behind the platform and the screen, and instantly beheld a tiger, moving with waving tail and rapid bounds straight towards the fire. There the monster divested itself of its teeth and claws, rolled up its skin, and placed every-thing on the platform of the god ; then it put on the clothes, and squatted down by the fire. Now Li Siao saw that there was his Little Pearl. He straightway embraced her and spoke to her, but not one word passed her lips. At daybreak he took her home and deposited her at Hwang Khien’s house. Here they confined her in an outhouse, and cast raw flesh before her, which she accepted and devoured ; and her mother, who watched her constantly, perceived that she did nothing else but gaze at the pig. A few days later she changed again into a tiger. The villagers now armed themselves with bows, ascended the roof of the house, and thence shot their arrows into the outhouse, thus killing her. In the next year a tiger ravened so frightfully that the people had to shut their houses even in the"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 85 daytime, and the prefect Hiung Ki-piao reported the matter to the Throne (181). p.547 We also read of were-tigers delivered by the people up to the magistrates, and formally put to death by their orders. Thus, « in the first year of the T‘ai yuen period of the Tsin dynasty (A. D. 376) there lived in the district of Ngan-luh, which forms a part of the Kiang-hia department (province of Hupeh), a certain Shi Tao-süen, twenty-two years old, who, before his youth had entirely passed, became mad and changed into a tiger. The number of those whom he thereupon devoured cannot be given. A girl who plucked mulberries under the trees, he carried off, and when he had devoured her, he concealed her bracelets and hairpins between the rocks, whence he fetched them up afterwards, when he had re-assumed human shape and remembered his deed. One year after, he returned home and lived there again as a man ; subsequently he distinguished himself in the service of the Government and became a dignitary within the Palace. One night he was chatting with some people, when the subject of metamorphoses and strange apparitions in the Universe was touched upon. — There was a time, Tao-süen said, when I was p.548 so ill that I became deranged in mind, changed into a tiger, and devoured men ; and he mentioned the names of his victims. But there were persons among those seated around whose fathers, sons or brothers he had devoured. With loud cries and howling they seized him, and delivered him to the magistrates ; and he died of hunger in the prison of Kien-khang (182), i. e. the present Nanking, then the Imperial capital. « A certain man in Sung-yang entered the mountain to gather fuel.

V 86 that the tigers sprang up against it, but without reaching him. Suddenly they said to one another : — If we can find Chu Tu-shi, we are sure to get this man. One tiger then remained to keep watch at the tree, while the other went away, and on a sudden there appeared another tiger, leaner and longer, and consequently peculiarly fitted to catch prey. The moon was shining brightly that night, so that our hero distinctly discerned how the small tiger frequently stretched out its paws at his coat ; but his fuel-axe was still at his waist, and just when the brute grabbed at him again, he dealt it a blow and hacked off its fore-claw. With loud roars the tigers ran off one after the other, and not until the morning the man went home. The assembled villagers asked him what had happened, and when he had related his adventure, one of them said : — There lives one Chu Tu-shi in the east of this district ; let us go and visit him, to see whether it is he or not. Some men went and asked about him ; — Last night, they were told, he went out for some moments and wounded his hand ; hence he is now in bed. Having thus attested that he was the tiger, they denounced him to the prefect of the district. This grandee ordered his underlings to arm themselves with swords, to besiege his dwelling, and set fire to it. Chu Tu-shi suddenly rose from his bed, ran about, changed into a tiger, and charging upon the men escaped ; and it is unknown whither he went (183). p.549 This anecdote demands our attention. It strikes us, that a wound inflicted on a were-beast is believed in China to be visible also on the corresponding part of its body when it has re-assumed the human shape. This is also a trait of our own lykanthropy. Olaus Magnus (184) relates, that a few years before he wrote, the wife of a nobleman expressed to her slave her disbelief in the possibility of the metamorphosis of men into wolves ; whereupon the slave, to prove that she was in the wrong, himself assumed"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol.

In the same century it is stated by Majolus (185), that duke Albrecht of Prussia had a peasant brought before him at Königsberg, who had devoured his neighbour’s cattle and bore large wounds in his face, which he had received from the teeth of dogs whilst he had been in the form of a wolf. Bodin Angevin wrote (186) that the Royal Procurator-General Bourdin had assured him he had had to pass sentence in the case of a wolf whom some one had wounded with an arrow in the thigh, which arrow had been found some hours later in the thigh of a man in bed. And Collin de Plancy relates (187) : « L’an 1588, en un village dans les montagnes d’Auvergne, un gentilhomme, étant sur le soir à sa fenêtre, aperçut un chasseur de sa connaissance, p.550 et le pria de lui rapporter de sa chasse. Le chasseur en fit promesse, et, s’étant avancé dans la plaine, il vit devant lui un gros loup qui venait à sa rencontre. Le loup l’attaqua fort vivement, mais l’autre, en se défendant, lui ayant coupé la patte droite avec son couteau de chasse, le loup estropié s’enfuit et ne revint plus. Le chasseur gagna la maison de son ami, et tira de sa gibecière la patte qu’il avait coupée au loup, mais il fut bien étonné de voir cette patte convertie en main de femme, et à l’un des doigts un anneau d’or que le gentilhomme reconnut être celui de son épouse. Il alla aussitôt la trouver ; elle était auprès du feu, et cachait son bras droit sous son tablier. Comme elle refusait de l’en tirer, il lui montra la main que le chasseur avait rapportée ; cette malheureuse éperdue avoua que c’était elle en effet qu’on avait poursuivie sous la figure d’un loup-garou ; ce qui se vérifia encore en confrontant la main avec le bras dont elle faisait partie. Le mari courroucé livra sa femme à la justice ; elle fut brûlée. On ne sait trop que penser d’une telle histoire, qui est rapportée par Boquet (188), comme étant de son temps.

Whilst travelling to Ch‘u-cheu (in Nganhwui) he reached Lih-yang, situated to the south, and started for Ch‘u-cheu at daybreak, then halting at an inn for travelling officers, called Benevolence and Rectitude, to pass the night. — This inn is under evil influence, the inn-keeper said, I pray you, do not lodge here. But T‘ao would not heed this advice, and with his satchel on his back went up to the main apartment, while the inn-keeper provided him with a lamp and a candle. At the second watch T‘ao spread out his blankets, and was just going to rest, when he saw at the gate a big paw like that of a quadruped. On a sudden the gate was flung open, and he saw a tiger walk in. In his fright he hurried into an obscure corner, and there concealed, observed the beast put off its animal skin in the middle of the courtyard and become a girl of extraordinary beauty, well dressed and ornamented, who walked p.551 up the steps into the main apartment, and laid herself down on his blankets. Now T‘ao appeared. — Why do you lie down in my blankets ? he asked ; just now I saw you enter in the guise of a beast, what was that for ? The girl rose and said : — I hope you will dismiss all your surprise. My father and my elder brother are professional huntsmen, and my family is so poor that all their attempts to find a fashionable match for me have failed. I became aware of this and secretly wrapped myself in a tiger-skin at night, for, well knowing that there lodge high class people here, I had resolved to give myself to one of them for sprinkling and sweeping his floor 1.

Next day he took the girl with him, having first thrown the tiger-skin dress into a dry well behind the hall. Afterwards he took a degree on account of his studies of the Classics, and became (military ?) prefect of Süen-ch‘ing. While journeying thither with his wife and boys, they after a month or p.552 so again stayed for a night in the inn of Benevolence and Rectitude. — It is here that I met with you for the first time, said T‘ao laughingly, and at once he went to the well to look into it ; and verily, there the skin-dress still lay. This caused him to burst again into a laughter. — The dress you had on at that time is there still, he called to his wife. — Have it fetched up, she said. And when she saw it in his hands, she continued, still laughing : — Let me try it on again. He gave his consent ; the woman descended from the steps and put on the skin-dress ; but no sooner had she done so than she changed into a tiger, which moved up the steps of the main apartment with roars and bounds, devoured the boys and T‘ao into the bargain, and ran away (189). The Hu wei, from which we draw this tale, gives us yet another of a ravening tiger-demon who made himself a tiger or a man at pleasure by putting a tiger-skin on or off."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 90 « In the Kien yen period (1127-1130) there were so many tigers in King-nan (King-cheu, in Hupeh pr.) that a great part of the population living without the walls removed into the city to escape their attacks. One Chang Szĕ had not yet removed, when a tiger came. He hastily hid himself among the beams of the roof. The brute walked up the steps of the main apartment of the house, put off its skin, and changed into a man, who departed through the gate to look for him. Chang forthwith descended and grasped the skin ; but no sooner had he placed it on the beam than the tiger came back. Missing his skin, he showed great consternation, then drew a sealed commission out of his bosom, unfolded it on the ground, and said : — Heaven gave me this commission to take away the members of the Joh and other clans, but I have erased their names from it, except those of the Joh ; give me back my skin, and I will leave the Joh people unmolested. But Chang said : — I will not give it unless you blot out my name too ; and when the p.553 tiger took a writing-brush out of his clothes and erased his name, Chang cast the skin down. The tiger put it on, re-assumed his former shape, and reared and bounded so tremendously that Chang shivered for fright, and was about to tumble down from his place when off ran the beast. Next day the tiger was killed by a flash of lightning, more than sixty miles from that place. Like our were-wolf 1, the man-tiger of China is represented sometimes as a necrophagous brute. « Under the reign of the emperor Hiao Wu of the Tsin dynasty, an old tale runs, it happened in the fifth year of the T‘ai yuen period  1 On connaît on Basse Normandie une sorte d’esprits appellés les Lubins.

D. 380) in the district of Ts‘iao, in the department of the same name, that one Yuen Siang, a poor fellow, while going home in the twilight fell in on the road with a girl of fifteen or sixteen, whose charms and beauties were perfect in every respect. She gave herself to him to be his wife, and in five or six years they attained very flourishing pecuniary circumstances. She gave birth to two sons, and when these boys were ten years old, the family had grown very wealthy. But then there occurred a fresh case of death in their village. After the burial the woman hurried to the grave, there put off her clothes and hair-pins, hung them on a tree, changed into a tiger, opened the grave, dragged the coffin out of it, seized the corpse, and devoured it. When satiated, she returned to the human shape. But some one had seen it, and secretly apprised her husband of it ; — Your wife is no human being, he said, she will commit some outrage upon yourself. Siang did not believe it ; but when after a time another case of death occurred and the woman behaved in the same way, that man p.554 took him to the spot to observe her. Thus he learned the truth. She thereupon scoured the district and its hills, devouring corpses again and again (190). As in other countries where royal tigers live, so in China exceptional specimens are known to prey preferably on men. But instead of ascribing this idiosyncrasy to their having experienced how easy a prey man generally is, or to their steady predilection for human flesh after having once tasted it, the Chinese aver that the man-eater is incited by the ghost of every last victim to a new murder. Thus fancy has created a class of injurious devils which have no animal shape, and are no animals transformed into demons, but human spectres in the service of an animal, or sometimes thought to inhabit it. The human soul under the impulse or guidance of which a man-eater ravens, is called ch‘ang kwei. This term we may probably translate by ‘the"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 92 ghost of him who lies flat upon the ground,’ that is to say, of the victim. Often this ghost is denoted by the word ch‘ang alone. « When a man has been slain by a tiger, Li Shi-chen wrote, he becomes a ch‘ang kwei, which leads the monster as a guide (191). In the Khanghi dictionary we find the same belief expressed in the following words : « When a tiger bites a man in such way that death ensues, his soul (hwun) has not the courage to go elsewhere, but regularly serves it as a slave, and is called a ch’ang. At the very time when it kills its victim, p.555 the beast avails itself of this remarkable fascinating power in order to compel the soul to re-enter the corpse and revive it, so that it may properly undress before being eaten, and thus no clothes or threads may bother the monster at its bloody meal (comp. Book I, p. 44). « When a tiger slays a man, said Twan Ch‘ing-shih, it has the power to make his corpse rise and doff its clothes, after which it devours it (192). The two following tales illustrate this curious folk-conception : « A literary graduate of the second rank, bearing the surname of Li, but whose name I have not found, lodged in the mounts of Süen-cheu (now Ning-kwoh, in Nganhwui pr.). He had a slave in constant attendance on him, a man so lazy that he had to lash and cane him frequently, and who entertained for this reason a deep grudge against his master. It was in the ninth year of the Yuen hwo period of the T‘ang dynasty (A. D. 814), that Li had two friends with him in an outhouse of his dwelling, and called the slave. But he was asleep. This aroused Li’s anger to such a pitch that he inflicted on him several times ten lashes. With hatred and rancour in his heart the slave left the room. — This is a year with an intercalary month, said he to his comrades, and thus, as men declare, there must be many tigers ; why then do not they devour me ?"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 93 With these words, he left the gate, and then suddenly his shrieks were heard. The other slaves rushed out to seek him, and as they failed to discover him, they followed the track of a tiger over a distance of more than ten miles. There they found him half devoured, by the river-side. His clothes with his kerchief and boots were neatly folded up and placed in a pile on the grass ; for tigers can keep their victims in employ as servants, and these are the souls of those victims (193). « In Süen-cheu, one Chang Tsun was the guest of Yuen T‘an-chwang, the prefect of the district of Lih-shui. His wife was carried off by a tiger, and Tsun swore that he would avenge himself. Armed with arrows, he entered the mountains, climbed a big tree close by the tiger’s den, and watched the beast. He there perceived that his wife was dead, and was watched by the tigress, until the corpse rose of its own accord, made obeisance to the brute, doffed her clothes, and in this naked state fell down again upon the ground. Then the tigress led four cubs out of the den, each of the size of a wild cat. Wagging her tail and hopping joyfully, she licked the dead body, till the cubs came and gnawed at it emulously ; but Tsun killed the brute with some arrows, cut off its head, and having slain the four cubs too, took their heads home, with his wife on his back (194). The principal advantage a man-eater draws from his ch‘ang kwei consists in that it brings him on the track of new human prey ; indeed, every such spectre in turn desires no better than to deliver itself from its servility by getting a substitute. Thus continuously driving tigers to homicide, those spectres belong to the most dangerous class in China. On account of their aversion from the bondage they are in, they sometimes decoy their striped master, and rid themselves of his tyranny by leading him into traps and pitfalls prepared by his enemies. Thus did the ch‘ang kwei of which the following lines give us the story : « In the last year of the T‘ien pao period (A. D. 755) there lived in Süen-cheu a young lad close to a mountain. Whenever he grazed"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 94 the cattle, he saw a spectre with a tiger behind it, p.557 and when this had occurred more than ten times, the lad spoke thus to his parents : — As that spectre brings a tiger along with it, I am sure to be killed. People say, that the souls of those whom tigers devour become their ch‘ang kwei ; thus shall I certainly have to become such a spectre on my death. When then I find myself under the orders of the tiger, I will lead it to the village, where you may then catch it with a pitfall you must prepare in the main street. Some days afterwards the boy was actually killed by the tiger, and later on appeared in a dream before his father, saying : — I am a ch‘ang kwei now ; to-morrow I shall take the tiger thither ; be quick to prepare a pitfall on the west side. The father and his fellow villagers followed this hint, and when the pitfall was ready, they caught a tiger in it on the same day (195). Instead, however, of leading their tyrants to their doom, thus to obtain their own redemption without causing the destruction of other human lives, the ch‘ang kwei protect their tigers, accompanying them everywhere to remove dangers out of their path. « In Sin-yang (now Kiu-kiang, in Kiangsi) a huntsman earned a living by capturing tigers. He set out a cross-bow on the roadside and inspected the spot every day ; and regularly he found the prints of a tiger close by and the arrow loosed, without the beast being bit. On account of the old assertion that a man whom a tiger devours becomes its ch‘ang kwei, he lurked in a tree beside the spot, in order to watch it, and perceived after the second watch a little sprite in blue garments, with hair growing to a level with its eyebrows. Cautiously it walked to the bow, let the arrow fly, and withdrew, and after a moment a tiger came, trod against the bow, and passed on. Now the hunter knew all about it ; he put another arrow into the bow and retired, but there the sprite was again to act as before. A second time p.558 the man hurried down from his"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 95 tree and adjusted an arrow in the same place, climbing into the tree again to spy. And in a few moments the tiger came and trod against the bow ; the arrow went off and pierced its flanks, so that it expired. After a good while the spectre re-appeared. Finding the tiger dead, it hopped about with gesticulations of excitement, and vanished (196). Thus may dangerous ch‘ang kwei, as other spectres, be outwitted by men. Another proof that their intellect and perspicacy are not above those of man, is afforded by the following tale : « In Sin-cheu (now Kwang-sin, in Kiangsi pr.) a certain Liu Lao exercised on behalf of the lay world functions as an abbot (in a monastery) between the mountain-brooks. A man who possessed some two hundred geese (wished to obtain religious merit and) requested Liu Lao to keep those birds for him until they died a natural death, and he came regularly himself to that place to see and feed them. A few months later not a day passed without some of the geese being stolen by a tiger, and more than thirty were thus destroyed, when its behaviour began to displease the villagers. They set pitfalls around the place where the birds were kept, but from that moment no tiger came there any more. Some days passed thus, when Liu Lao received an unexpected visit of an old gentleman with a large head and a long beard, who asked him how it was that the geese had diminished so considerably. The answer was that a tiger had stolen them. — Why then do not you catch the beast ? the old man asked. — We have set out traps, but it has not come back, replied Liu Lao. — Then it is its ch‘ang kwei that warns it, the other retorted ; p.559 first arrange matters with that sprite, and then you will get the tiger. On being asked how then the capture were to be effected, the old man said :"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 96 — The spirit is very fond of sour things ; so you must lay black and white plums on the highroad, and arbutus fruits ; it will eat them up without heeding anything else, and meanwhile you will catch the tiger. On these words the greybeard vanished. That same night they followed his advice and strewed such fruits on the road ; and after the fourth watch-drum had resounded they heard a tiger fall into a trap. From that time there was no further disappearance of geese (197). Man-eaters then being dependent on their ch‘ang kwei for their safety and life, we cannot be surprised to find the two beings represented as having completely reversed their respective positions of master and slave. Indeed, not seldom the spectre completely domineers over the tiger ; nay, we see it turn harmless men into tigers with no other purpose, evidently, than to gratify on them its passion for despotism. This trait renders the ch‘ang kwei doubly dangerous, as the following legend may show : « In King-cheu (probably the present Teng-cheu in Honan) a certain man passing over a mountain, fell in with a ch‘ang kwei, which cast a tiger-skin over him, and thus transformed him into a tiger. For some three or four years he was under the domination of the sprite, seizing and devouring all that time an untold number of men and cattle, and wild animals too. But p.560 though he had the body of a tiger, he did so maugre himself, and merely because he could not help it. Once upon a time, as the spectre was conducting the tiger past the gate of a Buddhist monastery, the beast availed himself of this opportunity and fled into the store-room, where he concealed himself under the bed of the monk in charge of that place. The scared brethren hurried to the abbot to apprise him of the event, and a Dhyâna-master 1 just then abiding in the monastery, who  1 A monk who seeks salvation by means of dhyâna, i. e. by fixing his thoughts steadfastly upon the state of bliss."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 97 possessed the capacity of taming intractable beasts, appeared at the place where the tiger lay. — My dear disciple, he asked, laying his crosier upon him, what do you want here ? is it to devour us, or are you merely disguised as a beast ? On this the tiger lowered his ears and shed tears. The Dhyâna-master slung his towel around the monster’s neck and took him to his own cell, where he fed him regularly on ordinary food for men and animals, and other good things. After half a year the tiger shed his hair, returned to human shape, and recounted in detail the beginning of this tale. For two years he did not venture out of the monastery, but after that period he walked out of the gate now and then, and on one of such occasions he suddenly met the ch‘ang. Again this cast a skin over him, and he immediately leapt back into the monastery ; but the skin had touched his limbs below the waist, which thus re-assumed tigrine forms. He then set himself to recite fervently holy books for longer than a year, and then regained his old shape ; but from then he dared no more pass through the gate of the monastery, and finally died there (198). p.561 The conceptions prevailing in China about the ch‘ang kwei, we find for the most part amply illustrated in a curious legend reprinted in the Hu wei, which relates how such a spectre entered the body of its mother, and recounted through her mouth its adventures as a tiger’s slave. That legend reads as follows : « The Buddhist monk Tsing-yuen relates : Below the Kin mounts in Hu-cheu (Chehkiang pr.) a family in the village So-and-so had a child, named So-and-so, fifteen or sixteen years old, whom a tiger devoured. His mother, unable to bear this grief, fell very ill indeed ; but one day towards nightfall she suddenly sat up, and in the tone of the child’s voice incessantly uttered a series of cries of woe."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 98 — Mother ! she exclaimed in the end, be not so excessively sorry ; it was my natural pre-destination. — Who are you ? exclaimed the affrighted father. — Father, why do not you recognize your child ? was the laughing answer. — But where are the proofs that you are my child ? he asked again. Now the mother behaved as under demonial influence, and answered : — I lacked courage to ponder any longer on my mother’s uncessant sorrow about me, and the great So-and-so having departed, I found time to go home and give her consolation. Great So-and-so is the term by which the ch‘ang in general denote the tigers, as they dare not roundly pronounce the word tiger. Now the father entreated the child to give some account of its past adventures. — When the first wounds were inflicted on me, it replied, and I felt intolerable pains, then forthwith a p.562 second servant appeared. — What servant ? interrupted the father. — Every new ch‘ang that arrives is ordered to carry with the first ch‘ang a large net, and then it sets this ch‘ang free ; hence, whenever an old ch‘ang sees a new one come, it is overjoyed. The net is very heavy. — And what do they do with it ? the father asked. — We catch men with it, who are thereafter eaten. None of those in this country who were devoured, escaped it ; they have all been in the bondage of tigers. When the tigers set out for another region, we escort them to the frontier, and on their return we meet to receive them, and then the ch‘ang kwei again enjoy neither rest nor leisure : No coffins must be used for those who are wounded by a tiger, but they ought to be burned, for else they desire to"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 99 carry the coffin with them, which, added to the net they bear, increases their woe. The mountaineers forbid to use coffins for them. And now, the woman concluded, So-and-so and So-and-so are here with me, anxious to see their folk ; you will oblige me, father, if you call them hither. The father took a torch, and went round the whole village ; and the kinsmen of all who had been devoured since the Kia tsing period, over fifty in number, gave ear to him and assembled to the spot. The mother spoke in the voice of each of those victims, and the discourses were accompanied by tears. They lasted as long as the day itself, the woman not being restored to her senses ere night had come. But from that very moment she recovered ; no evil consequences befell her, and still to this day she is living there. This event occurred in the spring of the year wu-suh of the Wan lih period (A. D. 1598). p.563 The above tales show that ch‘ang kwei are not considered by the Chinese as inhabiting their tigers, but leading an existence apart, merely accompanying them. There is, however, indication in the following tale that they are sometimes deemed to nestle in the monster : « In the last year of the Khai yuen period (A. D. 741) a tiger ravened frequently in Yü-cheu (in Szĕ-ch‘wen pr.). They set out a trap with a spring, but without surprizing the beast. Once at new-moon time a man ascended a tree to observe the trap, and perceived a ch‘ang kwei in the shape of a child of seven or eight years ; it was unclothed, moved nimbly, and its whole body had the colour of jade. It released the spring and passed on ; but our hero descended from the tree, re-adjusted the spring, and after a while a tiger which was passing was caught by it and expired. A good while after, the child returned wailing, and entered into the tiger’s mouth. When the day broke, the man opened this, and saw a piece of jade as large as a fowl’s egg in the throat (199). In passing from this subject we have to remind the reader, that the souls of the drowned, who, anxious to liberate themselves from their watery grave,"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 100 drown others to make their souls take their place, are called likewise ch‘ang or ch‘ang kwei (see page 528). 2. Wolf-Demons @ Though, as we have seen on page 182, were-wolves are mentioned in Chinese literature antecedent to the T‘ang dynasty, tales about p.564 ravening anthropomorphous wolves do not crop up until the reign of that house. Books then refer to them with sufficient frequency to justify the conclusion, that the belief in the existence of such demons in animal guise must have been far from sporadic ; and this fact in its turn authorizes us to surmise, that that belief was then already old. A few tales devoted to them have been preserved by the T‘ai-p‘ing kwang ki (ch. 442). Two of these, professedly borrowed from the Kwang i ki, deserve our special attention, as the one calls to mind in must. distinct forms our own were-wolf superstition referred to on page 549, that wounds inflicted on the beast remain visible when it has returned to the human form, and the other shows, that Chinese lykanthropy, like that in Europe, is a form of insanity, and may be produced by hallucination. « At the end of the Yung t‘ai period of the T‘ang dynasty (A. D. 765) there lived in the Hung-cheu department, in a village of the Ching-p‘ing district, an old man, who having been ailing during several months, for more than ten days refused to take any food ; he then suddenly disappeared in the evening, and nobody could guess the reason of it. Another evening, a villager who had gone out to gather mulberry leaves, was pursued by a he-wolf. He narrowly escaped up a tree, but the tree was not high enough to prevent the wolf from rearing itself up against it and fixing its teeth in the tail of his coat. Under pressure of the danger, the villager hacked at the beast with his mulberry axe, hitting it exactly in its forehead. The wolf then crouched down but remained on the spot so long that it was broad daylight before our hero could leave the tree. He followed the track of the wolf, which took him to that old"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 101 man’s house. He entered the main apartment, called the sons, and communicated to them the whole affair from beginning to end ; and the sons, on inspecting their father’s forehead, discovered on it the trace of a wound inflicted with an axe. Lest he might attack people again, they throttled him, and saw him turn into an old wolf. They went to the district magistrate to justify themselves, who let them go unpunished. « p.565 In the same year there was in another village of the same department a lad of some twenty years, who after a disease quite lost his vital soul (tsing shen), as he sent it away to change into a wolf. This monster secretly devoured a great number of the village boys. Those who missed their sons did not guess the reason, and sought for them in vain. As a rule the lad was employed by the villagers for sundry jobs. One day as he was passing the dwelling of a family that also were missing a boy, he heard the bereaved father call him, with the words : — Come to-morrow to work with us, and we will prepare a full meal for you. But he burst into a loud laugh. — What sort of man should I be if I went to your house a second time to work ? he exclaimed, do you think that there was the slightest particular flavour about your son ? This language surprised the father of the lost boy, and he interrogated him. — Nature orders me to devour men, he answered, and yesterday I ate a boy of five or six years ; his flesh was most delicious. The father perceived some stale blood in the corners of his mouth, and rained on him a shower of frantic blows, which made him turn into a wolf and expire."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 102 A tale of the same epoch intimates, that the Hunnish, Turkish or Mongol tribes living to the north and west of China, then were especially credited with ability to become wolves at pleasure. « Wang p.566 Han of T‘ai-yuen was general of Chen-wu (the north of actual Shensi). His mother, madam Kin, was of Hunnish origin, excelling in the use of the bow and in horsemanship, and notorious for her ruthless energy. Riding a strong horse, a bow at her arm, and arrows at her waist, she penetrated into the depth of the mountains in search of bears, stags, foxes and hares, which she killed and took with her in very great numbers. No wonder that her power was feared throughout the north, and that a general interest was taken in her. But when she had passed her seventieth year, she began to labour under the infirmities of old age. She then retired into a room, sent away her private slave-women, and did not allow her attendants to approach her unexpectedly. Sometimes, when she had barred the door at sunset and lay down to sleep, she had fits of fury, and soundly caned the inmates of the house. One night she had barred her door as usual, when suddenly they heard a rasping, creaking sound. They rushed out to see what was the matter, and saw a wolf open the door from the inside and leave the room. Before daybreak the brute came back, entered the room, and barred the door. The inmates were greatly affrighted, and at dawn they reported the matter to Wang Han. That same evening he watched her through a crevice, and thus saw that they had told him the truth. It filled him with dismay and horror, and he felt very uncomfortable. At daybreak his mother called him, to tell him to buy a roe for her immediately. He cooked the animal and took it to her, but she said : — I want it raw. A raw roe was then placed before her, which she devoured in a moment, thus increasing Wang Han’s fright. Some of the family"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 103 spoke of the matter in private ; she heard it, and appeared very ashamed ; and that same evening, after she had locked the door, and while the servants stood watching what she would do, — a wolf burst out of the door, never to return (200). p.567 Since the T‘ang dynasty, the belief in ravenous were-wolves has, no doubt, never languished in China. In the fourteenth century it certainly held sway also over cultivated minds, whereas we find it reported in all good faith in the Standard Annals of the Yuen dynasty, that « in the tenth year of the Chi ching period (A. D. 1350) the Chang-teh region (in the north of Honan) suffered much from wolves that broke into the dwellings at night in human disguise, and with howls made for the men, from whose arms they snatched babies, in order to devour them (201). Almost three hundred years later it was recorded in the local Memoirs concerning the Khüh-wuh district, in the southern part of Shansi, that the following episode had occurred within its confines : « In the years of the Ch‘ung ching period (A. D. 1628-1644) of the Ming dynasty so terrible a famine prevailed, that the people devoured each other. Then there lived in the hamlet of Kih-pih, situated twenty miles east of the chief city of the district, a herdsman, named Ts‘ang, whose surname has not been rescued from oblivion. Every morning he went out, and returned not before it was quite dark. His wife asked him whence he got food during that time, and he answered that he devoured men. — Is it lawful to do so ? she asked. — To-morrow, he replied, at noon, I will devour you ; and on her asking him why, he said : — Some time ago I passed a temple of a local tutelary divinity p.568 and saw there a wolf-skin ; I placed myself upon it, and suddenly profound sleep overcame me. When I awoke, I was a wolf, and not conscious of the change went out and devoured a man.

In a bewildered state of mind and unconsciously I did the same thing every day, and to-morrow at noon it is your turn to be eaten. I fear you cannot escape that fate, nevertheless I am unwilling to attack you. Therefore make a straw image of yourself to-morrow, and stuff it with the intestines of a pig, then, I assure you, nothing bad will befall you. Thus he spoke, and departed. The wife was so frightened, that she ran to the women in the neighbourhood to tell them. They wavered between belief and doubt, but her brother advised her to do what she had been told, and she obeyed him, to safeguard herself against eventualities. When the next day had come, she bolted the window and peeped through it at her husband’s movements, and no sooner was the sun at its height than a wolf bounded over the wall into the premises. Several times he flung himself head foremost against the window, but finding it impossible to enter through it, he fell back upon the straw woman, seized and devoured it. This done, he jumped over the wall again and left the place. On the loud cries of the woman the neighbours flocked together to the spot, and the bolder among them pursued the beast, our heroine in the rear. In this way they came to the temple, just in time to see the wolf crouched on the ground. From the hands of his wife he received a severe thrashing ; his tail was severed from his body, but the brute made his escape. Never did he come to the house again. Whenever after that the villagers saw a bobtail wolf, they called out his name, which made him shake his head and go the other way, without looking at them 1 and without devouring them. To this day old people still talk about that wolf (202). p.569 The attacks of were-wolves upon men are by no means always represented in China as sudden and impetuous, artless and clumsy.

V 105 innocent, charming maid, and in this disguise demurely enters into human society, to await patiently the right moment for devouring unsuspecting victims. « The wolf, says a work which existed in the seventh century, when a hundred years old, changes into a woman, called woman of knowledge. She looks like a beauty, and seated by the roadside, accosts male persons with these words : — No parents have I, no brothers ; sir, take me to your house and make me your wife ; and she devours men in the third year. If her name is called out, she runs away (203). This trait links the wolf to the fox, his congener, who, as we have seen already on pp. 188 sqq. and shall see more clearly from the fourth section of this chapter, holds in China the position of deceitful were-spectre par excellence, though without devouring the victims of his treachery. It must, however, be admitted that the occurrence of the wolf in this character is not sufficiently frequent in Chinese folk-lore p.570 to allow us to infer, that he has ever been generally regarded in the Far East as an artful diable à quatre. Only one tale in which he appears in this rôle we can set before our readers. « Under the T‘ang dynasty, a Governor of Ki-cheu (in the present Pehchihli) had a son, whose family-name and personal name I have forgotten. Being sent by his father to the Metropolis to solicit another post, he saw, ere yet he had crossed the frontier, the house of a notable man, crowded with visitors and followers. They had with them a girl of a countenance and form so charming, that our hero took a fancy to her and asked her in marriage. This called forth a general commotion in the house. — Who are you, angrily exclaimed an old slave woman, who surprises us with such foolish nonsense ? she is a daughter of our     1 Compare what is stated on page 165 on the same trait of European lykanthropy."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol.

But he answered them that his father held office in Ki-cheu, and that he would ask him for his consent. This answer much surprised them, and their consent was gradually obtained ; they lived together as man and wife for some days, and then the young couple were received on the road by the bridegroom’s family, and conducted home. Too fond were the Governor and his consort of their son to importune him with questions ; besides, the answers which the bride gave them were so rational as to arouse scarce any suspicion, and so many men and horses had come with her, that everybody in the house was elated. But after some thirty days had passed, it happened one evening that the horses of the newly married lady began to stampede. Slaves and others were repeatedly sent to see what was the matter, but she shut the door on them, and when at dawn the Governor’s men came to the son’s room, they found there none of her male or female slaves ; and no horses were to be seen in the stable. Filled with suspicion, they reported all this to the Governor. This grandee went with his wife to the room and called the son, but he gave no answer. They ordered the window-shutters to be broken, when through the opening thus made a large hoary wolf rushed out upon the men, and ran away. Their son they found almost entirely eaten up (204). 3. Dog-Demons @ p.571 As dogs do not devour men, they do not occur in China in the character of bloodthirsty demons. We have seen a dog-shaped devil represented by the Books of the Han Dynasty as employed by a human soul"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 107 as its instrument of revenge to cause the death of an empress in the second century before our era (see p. 437). Almost exclusively, however, dogs appear, on a par with the fox, as spectral harbingers or bringers of evil, as crafty impostors, and abusers of women. A few tales may depict them in this rôle. « Under the Sung dynasty, Wang Chung-wen was receiver in Honan, dwelling to the north of the city of the Keu-shi district. After his retirement from service, he was out for an airing in the evening between the lakes, and saw a white dog following behind his carriage. He took a fancy to it and would catch it, but on a sudden it transformed itself into a man resembling a Rescuer of the Country (Book I, p. 161 sqq.). Red as fire were its eyes ; its tusks were whetted, and its tongue hung out of its mouth ; indeed, a very horrid apparition it was. Chung-wen and his slave, greatly scared, attacked it, but they could not master it, and fled. Before they reached their house, they fell to the ground and died (205). p.572 A similar ill-boding or evil-producing demon was « the house-dog of the official Ts‘ai Ch‘ao, which visited him in the guise of a spectre. Squatted in the hall and using clapping-boards for beating measure, it chanted songs in a piteous tone of voice, and one morning he sought in vain for his kerchief, which the dog had put on, sitting in this attire upon the stove. In that same month Chao met with a violent death (206). With the same devilish deliberation for which the wolf is notorious, dogs wickedly assume human shape, with the purpose of gratifying their sexual lusts on modest maids and wives. « In Poh-p‘ing one T‘ien Yen was in mourning for his mother, and regularly lived in the mourning-shed ; but one day about nightfall he entered his wife’s private room. She received him with silent astonishment. — Sir, she said, may you visit me in this place of abstinence ?"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 108 but he did not listen to this remark, and nature had free course 1. Afterwards (the real) Yen entered for a moment, but he did not speak one word to his wife, and she, astonished at his silence, reprimanded him for what he had done the other day. This taught the husband that there must have been demonry in play. The evening came ; he was not yet asleep, and his mourning-clothes hung in the shed, when suddenly he saw a white dog scratch at the shed. Taking the mourning-clothes between its jaws, the beast changed into a man, put on the clothes, and entered (the female apartment) ; Yen hurried after him, and found the dog ready to get into his wife’s bed. He beat him to death, and his wife died for shame (207). p.573 « In the Hung chi period (A. D. 1488-1506) there lived in the district of Yü-t‘ai, which forms a part of the Yen region (in Shantung), a family of commoners, keeping a well-trained white dog, which always followed its master abroad. So also it once accompanied him when he set out to a far region for trading purposes. But unexpectedly it returned after thirteen days, in the shape of its master. The wife asked him what he came back for, and he told her he had fallen in with highwaymen, who had relieved him of everything he had with him, but fortunately he had escaped with his life. The woman did not doubt the veracity of his words. A year later the real husband came home. The two men resembled one another perfectly in shape, and while they were quarrelling about the question who was the true husband and who the false one, the wife and the neighbours informed the magistrate, who ordered them to be put in jail. A policeman then related the matter to his wife. — The one that came home first, she said, is the spirit of the dog, and this can be proved by discovering whether the breast of the woman bears marks of its paws.  1 Sexual intercourse is forbidden in time of mourning ; Book I, p. 608 sqq. "},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 109 The policeman told this the magistrate ; this summoned the woman before him, and on her asking wherefore she was called, he stript her, thus discovering that there were indeed prints of paws on her breast. He then gave secret orders to suppress (that demonry) by means of blood, and the pseudo husband changed into a dog, which they instantly beat to death (208). There are also early instances on record of house-dogs which p.574 with astounding impudence have assumed the shape of dead men, with the object of devouring the food and drink devoutly sacrificed to their shades. Thus, according to a book of the second century of our era, « the corpse of the minister of works Lai Ki-teh, a native of Nan-yang, was still unburied in his house, when suddenly he sat down upon the sacrificial table. His countenance, clothes and voice were thoroughly his own. He told his grand-sons, sons, wife and daughters to serve him in turn, and he whipped the slaves of both sexes, all of whom he found to blame. And when he had satiated himself with food and drunk his fill, he took his leave and went away. The family thus were in a great sorrow, and as this event was repeated three or four times, they felt more and more depressed and miserable. But then it happened that he drank (of the sacrificial spirits) till he was tipsy ; his (human) shape collapsed, and — they found nothing but an old dog. They beat this to death, and on making inquiry, discovered it was the house-dog of the liquor-vendor of the village (209). We must not dismiss the dog in its character of demon without saying a few words about the so-called t‘ien keu or ‘heavenly dog’, a mysterious devil, mentioned frequently enough in books to convince us that it has fascinated superstition for a long series of centuries. It appears as early as the sixth century in the Standard Histories : « in the thirteenth year of the T‘ien kien period (A. D. 514), in the sixth month, there were stories abroad in the Capital (the present Nanking) that ch‘eng-ch‘eng (?) stole the livers of men, as also"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 110 their blood, to feed the celestial dog therewith. The people were in great consternation for twenty days. And in the fifth year of the Ta t‘ung period (A. D. 539) p.575 the story was circulated in the Capital that the Son of Heaven took livers out of men for food for the celestial dog. Old and young thus affrighted each other so much, that after sunset they shut their doors and armed themselves with clubs ; this panic ceased after several months (210). The origin of the belief in that bloodthirsty anthropophagous monster we are not able to trace. Evidently, as its name indicates, it is related to the sky. We read indeed that in the second year of the Hwang kien period (A. D. 561) a celestial dog came down, and ceremonies were performed to counteract the ill resulting therefrom, on which occasion the emperor fell from his horse which was scared by a hare, and expired soon after (211). Looking into Chinese uranographical works, we find mention made of a luminary, called the heavenly dog, placed somewhere about Cancer. Szĕ-ma Ts‘ien has the following notice concerning it : « It has the shape of a large moving star, and produces a noise. When it descends and reaches the earth, it resembles a dog. Whatever it falls upon becomes a flaming fire, it looks like a fiery light, like flames flaring up to heaven. Its base is round and covers a field of several acres ; its upper part is pointed and spreads a yellow colour over a thousand miles ; it may defeat armies and kill the commanders (212). Evidently the great historian here describes an enormous dog-shaped meteor, which some time had come down somewhere and was confounded with a cornet in the sky. Perhaps it is to this same thing that the Shan-hai king refers, which states : « Midway in the large plain or desert there is a red dog, called the celestial dog. Wherever it descends, armed violence will prevail (213). p.576 There is, however, nothing in these extracts which accounts for the investment of the ominous comet with attributes of a devil craving for human"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 111 blood and livers. We further learn that it has announced its advent by a thundering noise : « In the second year of the Chung hwo period (A. D. 882), in the tenth month, thunder resounded in the north-west in a cloudless sky, and this was called a descent of the celestial dog (214). And in the third year « of the T‘ung kwang period (A. D. 925), in the ninth month, on the day ting-wei, when dark clouds covered the sky everywhere at night, a noise as of thunder was heard in the north, and the wild pheasants screamed. This was what people call a descent of the celestial dog (215). Probably the heavenly dog lives everywhere in China in imagination as a dreadful demon. According to some of my Japanese friends, this is also the case in their country. In many Chinese almanacks we find that dog mentioned as a demon prowling in different points of the compass according to the seasons, the solstices and the equinoxes, the knowledge of which fact is highly useful to all who then have any business in those directions, and wish to avoid its pernicious influences. The monster thus plays a significant part in Chinese Chronomancy, and we shall therefore again have to give our attention to it when, in another Book, we treat of that important branch of the Taoist system. 4. Fox-Demons @ Already in ancient China the fox was in bad repute as portending or causing evil, for we read in the Shi king : « Nothing here is red but evil foxes, nothing black but evil crows (216). Chu Hi comments upon this verse in these words :"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 112 « The fox was an ill-boding animal which men disliked to see. The fact that there was p.577 nothing to see there except those animals, proved that the kingdom was about to be imperilled and thrown into confusion. In the third century before our era it was Chwang-tszĕ who gave evidence of the prevalence of the belief in ill-boding foxes. « In a hillock of not more than a pu or a jen in size, he wrote, no large beasts conceal themselves, but evil foxes there give their omens (217). And that the fox was associated with evil spirits under the Han dynasty, we may infer from these two lines, which Hwang Hien, who lived in the second century of our era, inserted in a literary composition which he devoted to the fox : « Its prints wind over the regions inhabited by ch‘i-mei, And are traceable in the wilds where wang-liang abide. But by what did Reynard show his dangerous character ? This is revealed to us somewhat later by Chinese writers. The Standard Histories of the third and the fourth centuries of our era frequently refer to him as the cause of insanity, disease, and even of death. We read e. g. in the biography of Han Yiu, a famous diviner who died in A. D. 312 : « The daughter of Liu Shi-tseh had been visited with disease by a demon for quite a number of years. Wu’s had fought, invoked and attacked it, and captured in empty graves as well as in the old city-walls several dozen foxes and lizards ; but still the patient recovered not. Then Han Yiu consulted the divining-stalks on this matter, and ordered a linen bag to be made, which, when the woman had an attack, he hung out at the window. He then closed the door and blew from his mouth as if he drove out something, and shortly after, the bag was seen to swell as if blown up ; but the air made it burst, and the woman had another violent attack. Now Yiu made two bags of leather, which he hung out together in the same way as the other bag ; again they swelled up to their full"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 113 volume. Quickly he tied up p.578 their opening with a rope, and suspended them from a tree, where they began to shrink gradually for some twenty and odd days. On being opened they were found to contain two pounds of fox-hair. The woman recovered (218). And of another magician and diviner, named Ku Hwan, who died A. D. 493, history relates : « In the village of Poh-shih on the north of the mountains, much disease was caused by demonry. The villagers informed Ku Hwan of this, and implored his compassion. He repaired to the village, delivered a sermon about Lao-tszĕ (?), and traced a prison on the ground. Instantly foxes appeared, and turtles and lizards, which entered the prison of their own accord in great numbers. He ordered them to be killed, and all the patients recovered (219). Much light is shed upon the Chinese ideas respecting the fox as author of disease by tales such as the following, which represents him as entering into men so as to change them into raving lunatics. « In the seventh year of the T‘ai hwo period (A. D. 483) there lived in the Buddhist monastery of the Blue Dragon in Shang-tu a monk, named Khi-tsung, whose lay family dwelt in Fan-chw‘en. His elder brother Fan-king fell ill of a burning fever, which made him utter insane talk, and laugh stupidly. The monk kept him in restraint with all the vigour his soul could muster, and tried to exorcise the disease by burning incense, when suddenly the patient began to revile and scold. — You monk, he cried, get back to your monastery and your abbot ; why do you p.579 thwart my business ? I am dwelling in Nan-ko, and I am in love with you ; but the grain grows thick and the harvesters are abroad so numerously that I can come to you for a short time only. These words made the monk suspect that he was possessed by a fox-demon. Again he held the (exorcising) peach tree branch over"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 114 his brother and beat him with it, but the patient merely laughed and said : — You beat your elder brother : this is against the rules of submissiveness ; the gods will kill you for it ; beat harder ; go on. Khi-tsung now conceived that there was no help in this way, and abandoned the task. Thereupon the patient rose impetuously. He dragged his mother about with so much violence that evil (death) smote her ; in the same manner he treated his wife, who perished likewise, and then he maltreated his younger brother ; and when his wife came home, she (so suffered at his hands that she) lost her eyesight. When the day had passed, the patient was quite in his old condition. — As you do not go, he said to Khi-tsung, I shall convoke my family. No sooner had he spoken these words than the squeaking of several hundreds of rats was heard ; they were bigger than ordinary rats, showed a bold front, and could not be expelled. They disappeared indeed on the next day 1, but had greatly increased Khi-tsung’s fears. p.580 — Spare your voice and breath, his brother now exclaimed ; I do not fear you, for my great brother himself now comes. Cool moon, Cool moon, come here ! cried he with a prolonged scream, and at the third summons there sprang a beast from the feet of the patient, a beast of the size of a fox and as red as fire. Moving over the coverlet, it crouched upon his belly ; light sparkled from its eyes all around, but Khi-tsung seized his sword and aimed a blow at it, which struck one of its  1 This appearance of rats during a temporary abatement of the delirium of our madman, that is, according to the Chinese idea, while the fox, the author of the illness, was absent for the time being, is no doubt an allusion to the circumstance that the fox is a great destroyer of rats, so that these animals only venture to swarm out when it has gone. At the same time we have here a reference to the supremacy of the fox over rats and mice, enabling it to call upon those creatures when it wants their help, as in this case against the monk."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 115 paws. It then ran out of the door, but the monk followed the bloody print by the light of a cord, and thus came to a house, where he saw the beast take shelter in an earthen jar. Taking a large dish, he placed it over the mouth of the jar, and closed the crevice with clay ; and opening it after three days, he saw that the beast had become as (stiff as) iron and could not move. Khi-tsung killed it by frying it in oil, during which operation the stench extended for several miles. His brother then recovered, but one month later a family in that village lost by death its father with six or seven sons, and everybody opined that this was caused by pot-vermin sorcery which had been set up (220). Apart from its functions as author of disease and delirium, odium attached to the fox in those times as a harbinger of disaster in general ; which quality in the homes of ignorant simplicity meant much the same thing as to be the causation thereof. In a biography of the renowned diviner Shun-yü Chi, murdered in A. D. 396, we read : « Hia-heu Tsao of the Ts‘iao region had a p.581 mother, who was very ill. Therefore he went to Shun-yü Chi, in order to consult the oracle about her ; but just then a fox at his door set up a howling against him. Much terrified he hastened to Chi, who said : — The misfortune which this case portends is very imminent ; hurry home, and howl and wail with your hands on your breast on the very spot where the fox did so, so that all your family, old and young, rush out in fright and amazement ; go on howling as long as there is one person in-doors, and they will be saved from that misfortune. Tsao went home and followed the advice. His mother too, in spite of her illness, rushed out, and no sooner were the members of the family gathered in the main apartment than five side-rooms of the house fell in with a thundering noise (221). The superstitious fear of foxes, entertained in those ages, was shared by emperors and courtiers."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 116 « In the second year of the Ching ming period (A. D. 588), we read in the chronicles of the reign of Heu-chu of the Ch‘en dynasty, this sovereign dreamed that a fox crept under his couch, and on being seized became invisible. The emperor, considering that this apparition would cause evil, in order to avert the same sold himself as a slave to a Buddhist monastery 1, and built a seven-storied pagoda in the great imperial Buddhist monastery within the city-walls. But ere this was finished, a conflagration burst out within it, and devoured everything down to the stones with such rapidity that a very great number of people perished in the flames (222). p.582 Dangerous demonish propensities were especially attributed after the Han dynasty to foxes under human disguise, contributing a class of were-beasts with which we have acquainted our readers on pp. 188 sqq., promising to dwell upon them again here. They play their part in Chinese demonism mostly under the names of hu mei, hu tsing, or hu kwai : ‘fox-spectres’ or ‘apparitions of foxes’. Tales about them occur in the literature of the Han dynasty. In the Histories of that epoch we read concerning Fei Ch‘ang-fang, one of the greatest magicians that ever trod the Chinese soil, who ruled demons and ghosts at pleasure : « While out for a stroll with a companion, he saw a student wearing a yellow kerchief and a fur coat, alight from an unsaddled horse and salute him by knocking his head against the ground. — If you restore this horse to him, said Fei Ch‘ang-fang, I will exempt you from the penalty of death. On his companion asking him what these words meant, he replied : — He is a fox, and has stolen the horse from a local tutelary spirit (223).  1 Selling themselves as slaves to the Buddhist clergy as a token of the utmost devotion to Buddha and his Church, was no uncommon practice for Sons of Heaven in those halcyon days of Shakya’s religion. As they had themselves forthwith redeemed with large sums drawn from their treasury, the deed virtually became a rich donation bestowed on the Sangha ; which doubled its merit."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 117 In subsequent centuries, legends of fox-demons in human shape must have been current in great numbers, if we may conclude so from the fact that so very many have been preserved in writing to this day. They show that in all times the dangerousness of those beings was deemed to consist in the first place in that, like spectres of all classes, they caused disease and madness, sometimes acting in a spirit of revenge, but mostly from mere unprovoked malignity. Besides increasing our knowledge of Chinese demonism, the tales which place the were-fox before us in the character of a demon of illness, acquaint us with interesting notions on pathology and medical art. When Khü-tsih, the prince of the house of Han, who, as we saw on pages 289 and 397 of Book I, gratified his curiosity, and probably his rapacity also, by ransacking ancient graves, opened that of one Lwan-shu, « the coffin and the utensils for the use of the shade had been destroyed or had rotted away, to such an extent that nothing remained. There was p.583 a hoar fox in the grave, which, affrighted at seeing men, fled. The prince’s attendants pursued it, but they could not catch it, and only wounded its left paw with a javelin. Next night the prince dreamt that a man came to him with beard and eyebrows entirely white, and with the words : — Wherefore did you wound my left leg ? touched his left foot with his staff. On this the prince awoke with a swollen leg, and immediately an ulcer appeared thereon, which remained incurable till his death (224). The book, in which this tale occurs for the first time, is stated to have been written in the fourth century, but this fact does not, of course, exclude the possibility of the tale having become current at the date at which its author placed it. In ensuing centuries, were-foxes continue to appear in myth as beings smiting men and children with illness. Not to spin out this subject to an extravagant length, we will here pass on immediately to the T‘ang dynasty, and translate an amusing legend of that time, which sheds some stronger light on the character of the fox as an agent of disease, and at the same time places him before us in the capacity of unparalleled impostor."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 118 « In the Ching yuen period of the T‘ang dynasty (A. D. 785-805), Mr. P‘ei of Kiang-ling (in the south of Hupeh pr.), a sub-intendant of the palace, whose personal name is lost, had a son over ten years of age, very clever and intelligent, studious, brisk, and accomplished both in manners and appearance, whom he therefore deeply loved. This boy was attacked by a disease, which grew worse and worse for ten days. Medicines took no effect, and Pei was on the point of fetching a doctor of Taoist arts who might reprimand and thwart (the demon of the disease), in the hope of effecting a cure, when a man knocked at his door, announcing himself as one of the surname Kao, whose profession was to work with charms. P‘ei forthwith invited him to walk in and look at his son. — This boy suffers only from a sickness which is caused by a demonish fox, said the doctor ; I possess an art of curing this. The father thanked him and p.584 implored his help ; the other set to work to interrogate and call (the demon) by means of his charms, and in the next moment the boy suddenly rose with the words : — I am cured.

A few days later, a doctor bearing the surname Wang called on P‘ei, announcing himself as an owner of charms with divine power, and able to reprimand, thwart and expel therewith diseases caused by demons. While discoursing with P‘ei he said : — I have been told that your darling son has been rendered ill, and not yet cured ; I should much like to see him. P‘ei let him see the boy, when the doctor exclaimed with terror : — The young gentleman has a fox-disease ; if he be not forthwith placed under treatment, his condition will become grave. P‘ei then told him of the doctor Kao, on which the other smiled and said : — How do you know this gentleman is no fox ? They sat down, and had just arranged a meal and begun the work of reprimanding and thwarting (the demon), when colleague Kao dropped in.

With the words : — This matter is easy to arrange, he entered, in order to see the two ; but at once they cried out against him : — This too is a fox ; how has he managed to delude people here under the guise of a Taoist doctor ? He however returned their abuse : — You foxes, go back to the graves in the wilds beyond the town, he shouted, why do you harry these people ? With that he shut the door, and the trio continued for some moments to quarrel and fight, the fright of P‘ei still increasing and his servants being too perturbed to devise a good means to get rid of them. But at nightfall all noise ceased. They then opened the door, and saw three foxes stretched on the ground, panting and motionless. P‘ei scourged them soundly till they were dead, and in the next ten days the boy recovered (225). p.586 It can hardly be questioned, that for an explanation of the character of the fox as an impostor, always ready to torment man with antic tricks, we need not look further than the fact that it possesses a cunning and shrewd disposition, disguised under a gentle, innocent look. We have shown (p. 582) by translation of a legend, that it already bore that character under the Han dynasty. We have also seen from one of Yü Pao’s tales (p. 189), that in the time in which this author lived, foxes were believed to change themselves into charming maids, with the object of tempting men to sexual intercourse. It is especially in this character of seducer that in all ages, down to the present day, Reynard has afforded to the Chinese mind a favourite topic for the exercise of its mythmaking ingenuity. The fact that a work extant in Yü Pao’s time identified such bewitching were-vixens with a woman of loose morals who lived in very ancient times (see page 189), intimates a belief in the existence of such devils in times anterior to the fourth century."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 121 The Hüen chung ki, which existed before the sixth century, formulated the popular ideas on dangerous fox-elves in the following terms : « When the fox is fifty years old, it can transform itself into a woman ; when a hundred years old, it becomes a beautiful female, or a wu possessed by a spirit (shen), or a grown-up man who has sexual intercourse with women. Such beings are able to know things occurring at more than a thousand miles distant ; they can poison men by sorcery, or possess them, and bewilder them, so that they lose their memory and knowledge. And p.587 when a fox is a thousand years old, it penetrates to heaven, and becomes a celestial fox (226). The continuation of Yü Pao’s book of marvels, written not much later than this, teaches us, that in the fourth century women of easy virtue were represented as formally enlisted by the fox-world for purposes of harlotry. Thus we read in one of its pages : « One Ku Chen of Wu was hunting, and came to a hill, where he heard a human voice say : — Tut-tut, matters go badly this year. He searched upon the hill with his companions, and discovered in a pit, which was an ancient tomb, a hoary fox, squatted behind a written scroll, over which it bent its fingers and made an addition. They set the hounds upon it, which killed it with a loud barking. He then picked up the scroll, and found that it contained nothing but a list of lewd women, and that those who had already submitted to illicit intercourse were marked with a red circlet. There were more than one hundred names, and that of Chen’s daughter stood in the list (227). The belief in bewitching were-vixens, or, as we find them generally denoted in the books, hu mei, ‘vulpine enchantresses’, was specially prominent during the T‘ang dynasty. A great number of tales devoted to them, still current nowadays, may be traced back to that period. The Kwang i ki, probably the principal book of marvels of that epoch, devoted much space"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 122 to tales relating to such demons in the drama of human life. An idea of the ingenuity of fablers of that time, and of the tenor of their products, may be gathered from the following legend : « A son of the family Wei in Tu-ling dwelt in Han-ch‘ing (in p.588 Shensi) and was the owner of a country-house, some ten miles north of that town. In the first year of the Khai ch‘ing period (A. D. 836) he left the town for it in the autumnal season, and saw at nightfall a woman in plain dress coming from the north with a calabash. — For a year I have dwelt in a village north of the town, said she ; my family is very poor ; I suffer ignominious treatment from a village tax-collector, and am now on the way to denounce that man to the magistrates ; I shall be much obliged if you will write down the case on paper and let me have the document, that I may take it to the town, and thus wash away the shame that is brought upon me by that man. Wei consented to do this, and the woman bowing to him politely, they sat down on the turf. Taking a wine-goblet from her clothes, the woman said, — I have wine in my calabash : let us empty it together, and be drunken ; and filling the cup, she drank to his health. Wei in his turn raised the goblet, but just then a huntsman on horseback came by from the west with a pack of hounds. On perceiving them, the woman instantly ran off eastwards, and she had not taken more than ten paces at the most, when she was transformed into a fox. Wei’s fright was great on seeing that the cup he held was a human skull, and that the wine was something like cow-piss. He had an attack of fever, which subsided however in a month (228). The following poetic formulation of the principal ideas entertained by the Chinese of the T‘ang period concerning the bewitching influences of were-vixens on the minds and passions of men, we p.589 owe to the writing-brush"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 123 of Poh Kü-yih, a statesman of renown, who lived from 771-847, at the same time a prolific prose-writer and poet : When a fox-spectre of an old grave is growing old, It changes into a woman of lovely features ; Its head changes into a female coiffure, its face into a painted countenance ; The big tail it trails behind becomes a long red petticoat. Slowly she strides along the paths between the rustic hamlets, And where at sunset no human sounds are heard She sings, she dances, and alternately laments and wails, Without raising her eyebrows velvety as the kingfisher, but bowing her pretty face. Site bursts into a fit of laughter, a thousand, a myriad of joys, Eight or nine out of ten who behold her, are beguiled ; If false beauties may fascinate man in such a manner, The attraction exercised by genuine beauties cannot fail to surpass it. Such false and such genuine beauties both can bewilder a man, But the human mind dislikes what is false, and prefers what is real, Hence a fox disguised as a female devil can do but little harm, Nor can beguile a man’s eyes for longer than a day or a night ; But a woman acting like a vulpine enchantress is the cause of absolute ruin, For man’s mind she makes boil for a length of days and a series of months (229). p.590 It is unnecessary for us to review at length the numerous adventures of men with bewitching were-foxes, that have been invented by Chinese fablers and committed to writing, or transmitted by oral tradition 1. It is sufficient for our purpose to translate only such legends and extracts as give  1 Some have been translated or paraphrased by European authors, and contribute useful material to our knowledge of oriental animal lore. See e. g. the paper of Birch in the Chinese and Japanese Repository for 1863, p. 91 ; that of Watters in the Journal of the N. Ch. Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, VIII, and that of Mayers in the Notes and Queries on China and Japan, I, p. 26.

V 124 us the main features of the subject ; all the rest we may consider as mere repetition, and therefore quietly pass over. Among those which demand our attention, there are some which depict Reynard as an impostor so enormous that, far from contented with the simulation of human forms, he assumes the garb of religious holiness, nay, the shape of the Buddhas themselves, to insinuate himself into the favour of men, and even to obtain access to such awe-inspiring places as imperial palaces. Invested with this characteristic he appears especially in the tales of the T‘ang dynasty. « In the Yung hwui period of the reign of that House, thus the Kwang i ki relates, there lived in T‘ai-yuen (Shansi pr.) a man calling himself the Buddha Maitreya (the Messiah of the future). Those who went up to pay him their respects saw his stature so great that it reached to the skies ; then after a while he gradually shrank unto the size of five or six feet ; his body was like a red lotus flower amidst its leaves. — Do you know, spoke he to the people, that the Buddha has three bodies (tri-kāya) ? The greatest is his real body ; worship it, prostrate yourself before it respectfully. But Fuh-li, a monk in the city, deeply versed in the esoteric doctrine, heaved a sigh and said : — After this Dharma (i. e. state) of reality, that of ideas will begin, and beyond this still lies a final Dharma (viz. a final state of perfect intelligence) ; and from this final Dharma till the state of ideas in Nirvāna still lie several thousand years. After the extinction of Shakya’s doctrines our Great Kalpa will be destroyed, and after this event Maitreya will descend from the Tuchita heaven unto the Djambudwipa ; but Shakya’s doctrines have not yet vanished ; hence I do not understand why Maitreya descends at so early a date ; all that fervent and devout reverence then seems p.591 to be merely paid to a counterfeit of him. Suddenly he perceived from the sole of the saint’s foot that he was an old fox, as also that his pennons, flowers, yak-tail and canopy were mock paper money from a grave."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 125 — Is Maitreya something like this ? exclaimed Fuh-li, rubbing his hands ; and no sooner had he uttered these words than the fox returned to its true form. Down from its seat it came, and off it ran. They gave chase, but could not overtake it (230). The same work relates : « When the empress Tseh-t‘ien of the T‘ang dynasty was seated on the throne (684-706), there was a woman who called herself a holy Bodhisatwa. Everything which men fixed their thoughts upon, she knew. The empress summoned her to Court, where all she said proved to be so reliable that she was surrounded with devotion for some months, and praised as a genuine Bodhisatwa. Then the monk Ta-ngan entered the Palace, and was asked by the empress whether he had seen the female Bodhisatwa. — Where is she ? he replied ; I long to see her ; and the empress gave orders to let them have an interview. p.592 The volatile soul of the monk (his thoughts) now soared away for a while, and then he asked : — You can see thoughts ; well, try to see where mine have been. — Between the bells at the round disks on the top of the pagoda, she answered. Immediately he repeated his question, and the answer was : — In the palace of Maitreya in the Tuchita heaven, listening to the preaching of the Law. And then he questioned her a third time, and she laid, his thoughts were in the highest heaven where even no unconsciousness exists ; and those three answers all were correct. The empress was delighted ; but Ta-ngan fixed his thoughts upon the fourth fruit of sanctity, viz. on Arhatship, and this time the saint could not find it out. Now Ta-ngan exclaimed :"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 126 — You cannot discover it when I fix my thoughts upon Arhatship ; how then can you do so when I fix them upon the (still higher) state of Bodhisatwas and Buddhas? The woman confessed herself beaten ; she changed into a vixen, ran down the steps, and hurried off, and nobody knew whither she ran (231). « Under the T‘ang dynasty there lived among the people of T‘ai-cheu (prov. of Shansi) a girl, whose brother was not at home, but in a distant garrison. While thus the girl lived alone with her mother, they unexpectedly saw a Bodhisatwa come, riding on a cloud. — Highly virtuous is your house, quoth he to the mother ; I desire to abide in it ; hasten to put it into good condition, as I will then visit it frequently. The villagers emulously went there to put the matter in order, and no sooner were they ready than the Bodhisatwa descended into the house on a five-coloured cloud. Numerous were the villagers who resorted to the spot with sacrifices ; but the saint ordered to make no stir about the matter, lest believers should flock incessantly to and fro from all sides. They accordingly admonished each other to hold their p.593 tongues, and the Bodhisatwa had intercourse with the girl, so that she became pregnant. A year passed by, and the brother came home ; but the Bodhisatwa declared that he did not desire to see any male creatures, and prevailed upon the mother to drive her son out. The latter thus being unable to approach the saint, used his money for securing the help of a Taoist doctor, and finally found one who applied his arts on his behalf. They thus discovered that the Bodhisatwa was an old fox ; sword in hand, he rushed into the house, and despatched the brute (232). Popular superstition seems to have sometimes ascribed the bewitching faculties of were-foxes to the fact that they are possessed of a mysterious pearl, probably representing nothing else than their soul. Indeed, as we have seen on pp. 330 seq., pearls are deemed to be particularly animated, and"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 127 hence the idea that souls of living beings may have the shape of pearls is perfectly natural. « Liu Ts‘üen-poh of the T‘ang dynasty, runs a tale, relates that Chung-ngai (lit. Every one’s Love), the son of his foster-mother, used to amuse himself in his youth by placing a net across the road in the night, in order to catch some wild pig, fox or other animal. Ts‘üen-poh’s hamlet lay at the foot of a hill. One evening Chung-ngai set his net some miles to the west of the hamlet, hiding himself by it to observe what would come. There he heard in the dark the sound of steps, and saw a beast in crouching attitude, which, perceiving the net, reared itself up, and changed into a woman wearing a red petticoat. Evading the net, she walked to a car that stood before Chung-ngai, there caught a rat, and devoured it. Chung-ngai drove her into the net by his cries, and cudgelled her to death ; but as she did not change her shape under the blows, he fell a prey to doubt and fear ; and thinking p.594 she might after all be a human being, he cast her, net and all, into a tank used for the soaking of hemp. It was night when he returned home. He consulted his parents, and at daybreak the family would flee, but Chung-ngai said to himself : ‘do women devour living rats ? this one must be a fox’. He returned to the tank, and seeing that the woman had revived, he struck at the small of her back with a large axe, and lo, she turned into a hoary fox. Chung-ngai, elated, took the beast to the village, where an old Buddhist monk, seeing that it was not yet dead, advised him to keep it alive. — The mouth of the fox contains a bewitching pearl, said he ; if you get it, you will become a favourite of the whole world. He placed the brute with tied paws under a large hamper, and when after some days it could take food, the monk buried a jug with a narrow mouth in such a manner that the mouth was on a level with the ground. Then he put two slices of fried pork into it, and the fox, craving for the roast, but unable to reach it, placed its"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 128 jaws over the jug ; and when the roast was cold, another couple of slices were put into the jug, with the result that the mouth of the animal began to water. They went on in this wise till the jug was full, when the fox vomited out a pearl and died. This pearl was shaped like a draughtsman, perfectly round, and of the purest water. Chung-ngai frequently wore it in his girdle, with the result that he was greatly esteemed by his people (233). p.595 If the capacity of foxes to change into men is also ascribed to their alleged contact with human bodies in old graves (comp. p. 192), it is reasonable that they should often be represented as appearing in the form which men assume after death, that is, as human spectres. Yü Pao describes for us a goblin of this sort in the following tale : « In the western suburb of Nan-yang stood a pavilion, where nobody could sojourn without incurring harm. But one Sung Ta-hien, a man of that town, imperturbable on account of his having walked in the correct Path (Tao), has succeeded in passing a night in the storey of the pavilion, seated in the dark and playing on a lute, without any weapon or stick about him. At midnight a spectre appeared ; up the ladder it climbed and accosted Ta-hien. It had a staring look, whetted teeth, and repulsive form and features. As he went on strumming on the lute, the spectre departed to fetch a dead man’s head out of the street, with which it returned. — Will not you take a nap ? it said to Ta-hien, flinging the head before his feet. — Very good, retorted the other, I have no pillow to lay my head on this night ; this is just the thing I want. Again the spectre departed, to come back after a while. — Shall we now have some boxing ? it said. — Very good, replied Ta-hien,"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 129 and ere these words were out of his mouth the spectre stood before him, but was grasped so tightly about the loins that it only could cry in distress : — I am dying ! Ta-hien despatched it, and when the day broke he saw that it was an old fox. Since that time there have no more been any apparitions of spectres in that pavilion (234). p.596 Although his double capacity of originator of disease, and of impostor under human guise amply suffices to assign to the fox a prominent place among the most dangerous demons that keep China in constant fear, there are yet other black stains in his character which add to the popular odium that attaches to him. Thus he lies under constant suspicion of arson. Conjecture seems useless to establish a reason for this, unless we attribute it to the old idea, mentioned on page 194 in an extract from the Yiu yang tsah tsu, that he produces fire by beating his tail. The fox appears as an incendiary as early as the traditions about the remarkable exploits of Kwan Loh, the peerless magician and soothsayer of the third century, of whom the reader has heard on page 1000 of Book I. « When Kwan Loh was lodging in a country-house, he visited a distant neighbour, who was harrassed by frequent outbreaks of fire. Kwan Loh consulted the tortoise-shell about the matter, and ordered him to go the next morning to the end of the road towards the south, and wait there for a gentleman wearing a single-pointed kerchief and driving in an old car with a black ox ; this man he was to take to his house, to detain, and to treat well as a guest, for it was he who could remedy the evil. The other obeyed these orders, and though the gentleman was in a great hurry and begged leave to pursue his journey, he was not allowed to do so, and was detained. When he retired to rest, a very uneasy feeling came over him. He took counsel with himself, and when his host had finally left his room, he grasped a sword and left the house. Between two piles of"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 130 fuel he stood leaning, and feigned to doze, when suddenly a little animal passed right in front of him, resembling a quadruped and holding fire in its paw, which it fanned with its breath. The affrighted stranger raised his sword, struck the beast right through the loins, and then saw that it was a fox. Henceforth the host suffered no more from fire-disasters (235). p.597 Those among the Chinese, who wish to realize what an enormous evil fox-demons are, can hardly do better than acquaint themselves with the following sad tale in Yü Pao’s collection : « Under the reign of the Tsin dynasty there was in Wu-hing (in Chehkiang pr.) a man with two sons. These were harvesting in the field, when they saw their father appear and pursue them with invectives and even with blows. They complained of this treatment to their mother, who asked the father why he had done so. He was greatly startled by there words, and arrived at the conclusion that this must be a trick played by a spectre. So he told the sons to slay it with their axes, but the spectre kept quiet, and did not go there again. The father, fearing that it might harry his boys somehow or other, went to look after them, on which the sons, crying out — Here is the spectre ! killed him, and buried his body in the ground. Thereupon the spectre hurried to the house, assumed the shape of the father, and told the inmates that the boys had killed the spectre. In the evening they came home, and were congratulated cordially by every one. The actual truth remained a secret to them for several years, until a priest passed their house. — Your father, said he to the two sons, exercises a very unpropitious influence. They reported this saying to their father, who burst into such a rage that the sons hurried out of the door to advise the priest to beat a hasty retreat ; but as the latter entered with a noise, the"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 131 father, turning p.598 into a big old fox, crept under the bed, where he was seized and killed. The man they formerly slew was their real father. They re-interred him in another grave and observed mourning for him ; but subsequently one of the sons committed suicide, while the other died of remorse (236). Far from being always so dangerous, the tricks played by foxes on men are sometimes of a rather humorous sort, though no less terrifying to the simple-minded people. Thus it was deemed an event worthy of record in the dynastic annals of the Wei dynasty, that « in the first year of the T‘ai hwo period (A. D. 477) fox-elves cut off the people’s hair, diverting themselves with the same play forty years later, « in the second year of the Hi p‘ing period, in the imperial capital, from the spring of that year onwards, keeping the population in fright and terror. The empress-dowager Ling decreed in the sixth month, that all such cutters of hair should be whipped without the gate of the Thousand Autumns by the good care of Liu T‘eng, the chief of the guards of the Ch‘ung-hiun palace (237). We find some particulars about this strange panic in the interesting ‘Description of Buddhist Convents at Loh-yang’, of which we made mention on page 344 of Book I. « To the north of the bazaar were two wards, named Ts‘zĕ-hiao and Fung-chung, where the people sold coffins and grave-vaults, and hired out funeral carriages. There dwelt there a singer of dirges, named Sun Yen, who had been married for three years without his wife having ever slept undressed. This in the end aroused his curiosity to such a degree that he watched a moment when she was asleep, and undressing her discovered three hairs, three feet in length, resembling the tail of a wild fox. Out of fear he divorced her, and when the wife p.599 departed she took a knife, cut off his hair, and away she ran. As the neighbours ran after her, she changed into a fox, which could not be caught."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 132 After this event, more than a hundred and thirty people in the capital were relieved of their hair. At first the fox moved on the roads in the shape of a woman, dressed, adorned and painted, who charmed everybody that saw her ; but those who approached her had their hair cut off. Thus it was that women in gaudy dress were pointed at with the finger by every one as fox-elves. These things occurred in the fourth month of the second year of the Hi p‘ing period, and they did not end until the autumn of that year (238). The possibility of fox-demons depriving men of their hair being thus established by history, fabulists have often framed tales thereon. We need not, however, here pay any more attention to their work, as the numerous fox-tales contained in Chinese books posterior to the T‘ang dynasty shed no new light on our theme. They may all be said to move within the orbit of the ideas which we have passed in review ; which fact renders fox-literature rather tedious, monotonous, and often insipid. But this does not imply that much of it will not amply reward translation. It may considerably increase our knowledge of Asiatic zoological myth, enlarge our insight into the inventiveness and genius of the Chinese, acquaint us with all sorts of tricks which their fancy has contrived and ascribes to animals in general and to Reynard in particular. It may also show us the ways in which tricks of malicious foxes may be frustrated and they themselves unmasked. Apart from wounding or killing were-foxes or setting dogs upon them, which, as we p.600 know, are sure means to force them to re-assume the vulpine form, they may be unmasked by clever bookmen, priests, monks, and ghost-seers. They may be conjured back into their animal state by incantation, or should they have set themselves up as scholars or saints, by being outwitted or checkmated in discussion. The same result, according to some tales, may be obtained by giving them poisonous food, or by employing written charms against them. A good device for unmasking them is to investigate whether they have a complete tail or something like a caudal appendage, and then to cut it off, when they will be seen immediately take to flight on all fours. It is not surprising after all this, that fox-literature leads to the conclusion that Reynard has always been an object of hot persecution. To unearth him and his progeny, and doom them all to a death by fire, was ever a"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 133 commonplace sport in the Empire of the Midst, and the fact that the Code of Laws of the Ming dynasty and the present reigning house contains special provisions against damaging graves by smoking foxes thereout (see Book I, p. 872), certainly points to the frequency of such work of destruction. Besides by means of human skulls and bones (comp. pp. 192 sqq.), the fox, like the tiger, often brings about his metamorphosis into a man by swallowing written charms or pronouncing spells. He may possess still other expedients for effecting the same end, but we do not find them mentioned in Chinese works. 5. Various Wild Mammals as Demons @ Whereas every animal, according to the Chinese, possesses a soul, and, as Chapter X of Part I has shown, may assume the human shape, it is quite rational that they also admit that every animal may be a spectre capable of inflicting evil upon man. As early as the fourth century Koh Hung warned mankind against quite a series of animals, especially against a dozen in connexion with the twelve Branches which each denote a day in every dozen (comp. page 987 of Book I), these animals thus exercising an influence each in its turn on the human fate during one day. « If on a yin day there is a being in the mountains calling himself a forester, he is a tiger ; if he calls himself a prince on the road, he is a wolf ; and he is an old fox if he declares himself to be a chief ; Should he appear on a mao day and p.601 style himself a senior, he is a hare ; but if he says he is the royal father of the east, he is a deer, and he is a stag should he say he is the royal mother of the west. On a ch‘en day, he is a dragon if he styles himself rain-master, a fish if he says he is a river-chief, and a lobster if he says he is a bowelless gentleman. He who on a szĕ day calls himself a widow, is a snake living in the villages, or a tortoise if he says he is"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 134 the lord of time. On a wu day, he is either a horse or an old tree, according as he says he is one of the three ministers, or an immortal. And on a wei day, such a being is a goat if he says he is a host, and a roe if he says he is an official. On a shen day, he is either a monkey or a gibbon, according as he says he is a prince or one of the nine ministers. On a yiu day, he is a cock should he say he is a general, or a pheasant if he says he is a catcher of insurgents. Should he say on a suh day he bears a human surname and cognomen, he is a dog, but if he states on such a day he is a lord of the accomplished Yang, he is a fox. On hai days, those that call themselves ladies are gold or jade, and those that say they are divine princes are pigs. Those that on a tszĕ day declare themselves to be tutelary divinities of the soil, are rats, and those that say they are divine men are bats ; and finally, such beings as assert on a ch‘eu day that they are scholars, are oxen. If you only know these their animal names, they can do you no harm (239). p.602 The stag being neither dangerous nor malicious, save in certain exceptional cases, we should hardly expect it to occupy a place in Chinese folklore as a demon. Yet we find it in this rôle in the following old tale : « Sié Kwun of the Ch‘en province had resigned his office on account of ill-health, and was living in retirement in Yü-chang. There while making an excursion, he spent the night in an empty pavilion. Before that time, human lives had frequently been lost there. At the fourth watch, a man in yellow clothes called Kwun by his cognomen, saying : — Yiu-yü, open the door, but, perfectly imperturbable and without any symptoms of fear, he bade the other to put his arm through the window. The man indeed offered his wrist to Kwun, who pulling at it with all his might, tore the arm right off the body. The owner beat a retreat, and the next morning Kwun saw that it was the foreleg of a stag. Tracing up the bloody prints, he caught the beast, and the pavilion was no longer haunted (240)."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 135 The hare too occasionally becomes a dangerous spectre, especially if it is old, and (see p. 162) thereby apt to assume other shapes. « In the Hwang ch‘u period of the Wei dynasty (A. D. 220-227) a man of the Tun-khiu region was travelling on horseback in the dark, and saw in his path a beast of the size of a hare, with eyes like mirrors. Hopping before his horse, it prevented this from proceeding, affrighting the rider so much that he tumbled off. The spectre then approached, and seized him so that fright killed him, and it was a long time before he revived. By that time the spectre had gone, he knew not whither. Our hero remounted his horse, and after travelling a few miles fell in with a man, whom, after having exchanged the customary questions, he informed of his recent adventure, declaring how glad he was now to find a companion. — I too am quite alone, replied the other, and I cannot tell you how relieved I feel to have your company ; your horse moves faster than I ; if you p.603 ride on ahead, I will walk behind. While journeying together in this fashion, the wayfarer asked : — How did that beast look, that just now affrighted you so ? — Its body was like a hare, was the answer, its eyes resembled mirrors ; its shape was most repulsive. — Then look at me, said the other ; so he did, and there he saw that same spectre again. It leapt on the horse, the rider fell off lifeless with fright. His family, astonished to see the horse come home alone, immediately ran out to seek him, and found him by the roadside. During that night he awoke, and told them the incident as we have here related it (241).

V 136 us the monkey in the rôle of the fox, the wolf and the dog, that is, as a lewd fornicator of wives and maids, and as a seduceress, in beautiful female forms, of adults and inexperienced youths, whose senses it bewitches at the detriment of their health. « In the T‘ai yuen period (376-396) of the Tsin dynasty they kept a monkey in the back palace of Tih Chao, prince of Ting-ling, in front of the chambers of his concubines. These women once upon a time simultaneously got in the family way, and each of them gave birth to three children that danced and hopped while p.604 discharging from the bowels. Chao thus being convinced that the monkey was the culprit, killed the beast and the children ; which made the women burst out all at once into wailing. He interrogated them, and they avowed they had seen a young man dressed with a yellow silk robe and a white gauze cap, a most lovely personage, jesting and chatting quite like a man (242). « In the last year of the T‘ai yuen period (A. D. 396) Sü Tsih-chi, while out for a stroll in the open country, saw a girl with a water-lily, who held up her hand and beckoned him to approach. Tsih-chi was charmed, and she invited him to share her dwelling. From that time they had intercourse as old friends, but he began to suffer from wasting, talking sometimes of visions of beautiful rooms and deep halls with odorous divans and broad mats. After he had indulged with that woman in feasting and revelling for several years, the attention of his brother Sui-chi was attracted to a conversation of several people in the house. He stole near to investigate the matter, and saw a number of girls leave the house by the back door, while only one stayed and concealed herself in a basket. He entered, and then his brother angrily assailed him with the words : — We were just so merry together, why do you surprise us so unmannerly ? There is one in that basket, he immediately continued ;"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 137 Sui-chi opened it, and saw a she-monkey, which he killed. Thereupon his brother became quite well again (243). p.605 The position of the rat in Chinese demon-lore is rather significant. Like the fox and the monkey, it is, as we have showed by two tales on page 202, notorious for assuming the human shape to commit adultery with men, and for embracing Buddhist religious life with purposes not always deceitful. Should it wish to bewitch women for immoral purposes, it may do so without assuming human shape, as the following legend shows : « In recent times there lived a man, who brought up a girl over ten years old. One morning she was missed. A year elapsed without any trace of her being discovered, when they heard from time to time in a room of the house underground wailing of a baby. They turned up the ground and discovered a hole, gradually increasing in depth and width, and more than a chang in length and breadth ; here they found the girl sitting with a baby in her arms, and a bald rat as large as a bushel beside her. She saw them enter without recognizing her superiors, from which the parents concluded that she was under the demonish influence of that rat. They slew the beast, whereupon the girl burst into bitter weeping ; — He is my husband ! she cried, why do they murder him ! As they killed the child also, her lamentations were unceasing, and ere they could cure her she died (244). Folklore also allows whole packs of rats, either in other animal forms, or as men, to haunt human dwellings and settlements, or swarm out of cracks and apertures and withdraw thither ; and it represents such apparitions as omens of evil. Tales on this topic are numerous, a fact which, we may, no doubt, readily assign to the frequent occurrence of rats in human dwellings, where daily they disturb the sleep and dreams of man. The following tale may characterize their position as harbingers or causes of evil. « In the last year of the T’ien pao period (A. D. 755) the Censor Pih Hang was Governor of Wei-cheu, when this region fell into the power of the insurgent p.606 Ngan Luh-shan. He was just contriving"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 138 the necessary stratagems to reduce him to submission, and had not yet marched out, when some days later he saw to his surprise several hundred pigmies, five to six inches in size, loiter and gambol in his courtyard. He and his family beat them to death. Next morning quite a troop of such dwarfs, all in white mourning dress, with lamentations took away the corpses in funeral cars and coffins, with quite as much care as is observed at funerals of the gentry ; they then made a grave in the courtyard, and after the burial disappeared into a hole in the southern wall. In great fear and wonder, Pih Hang opened the grave, and found an old rat in it. He boiled water and poured it into the hole, and on digging it up after a while, found several hundred dead rats. Some ten days afterwards his whole family was killed, because he had not been victorious (245). Of rats infesting the public roads as well armed highwaymen we hear in the following legend : « In the first year of the Wan sui period (A. D. 695) the roads to Ch‘ang-ngan were infested by a gang of robbers, who concealed themselves in the daytime, and operated during the night. Every now and again itinerant strangers were murdered without a trace of the perpetrators being discovered next day ; which disheartened the people so much that they dared not set out in the morning, even though inns might be reached in the evening. When the matter reached the ears of a certain Taoist doctor who lodged there in an inn, he said to the crowd : — To be sure, there are no men ; they must be spectres. In the dead of night he provided himself with an antique looking-glass, and took his post by the roadside to look out for them. On a sudden a troop of young men appeared, fully armed and accoutred. — Who stands there by the road ? they shouted with one voice at the Taoist, p.607 do not you care for your life ?"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 139 but the doctor let his mirror shine upon them, with the result that they flung down weapons and shields, and ran off. For some five or seven miles the doctor pursued them with spells and formulas, until they all ran into a big hole. He kept watch over it till the morning came, and then returning to the inn summoned the people to dig up the hole. It was found to contain over a hundred big rats, which as they swarmed out were slain to the last. The evil was thereby ended (246). Rats may also haunt human dwellings in the shape of other animals. « Li Lin-fu, a high magnate of the eighth century, was unwell. In the morning he rose, washed and apparelled himself, and intending to repair to the Court ordered his men to bring the letter-bag he was wont to use. Feeling it was heavier than usual, he opened it, and out sprang two rats, which on reaching the floor changed immediately into grey dogs. With ferocious eyes and showing their teeth these beasts regarded him ; he seized his bow and shot at them, on which they vanished ; but Lin-fa was so deeply impressed with this incident that he died ere a month had passed 1. p.608 Among the many animals notorious in China for assuming the human shape with the object of enjoying sexual intercourse with men or women, we also find the otter. « In the Wu region, thus runs one of Yü Pao’s tales, there existed at Wu-sih (in the south of Kiangsu) the great dike of the upper-lake, the warden of which, Ting Chru by name, made his rounds over the dams at every heavy rainfall. Once when there was abundance of spring rains, he went out for a tour on the dikes, and was returning in the evening, when he discovered that he was  1 T S, sect.*, ch. 83.

But in the copy we have of it, we do not find the tale among the eighty-two notes and tales on marvellous matters and events from the Han dynasty to that of T‘ang, which it contains.

He quickened his pace, but on looking behind him saw that the woman came trotting after him with a like speed. So he actually took to flight, and on turning round again, saw her in the distance dive with a plump into the waves. Away flew her cloches and umbrella, and thus he saw that she was a big grey otter, and that her dress and umbrella were mere water-lily leaves. Such anthropomorphoses of that otter took place frequently with intent to seduce youths (247). « p.609 In Ho-tung, Shang Ch‘eu-nu with a young lad collected rushes on the borders of the lake, and usually spent his nights in a cottage in a waste field. Once at sundown he saw a young girl of very beautiful figure and countenance pass by there in a small boat loaded with rushes. She came up to his cottage for a lodging, and as he slept with her, he perceived she had a rank smell. When the woman had enjoyed sexual pleasure, she asked permission to go out, and when out of doors changed into an otter (248). « According to the Fuh-kien t‘ung chi or General Memoirs concerning Fuh-kien, there were false rumours abroad in the 35th year of the Kia tsing period (A. D. 1556) about spirits (tsing) of water-otters shaped like fire-flies, which, if they settled on the coat of a man, were sure to cause his death. In the houses in the cities gongs and drums were beaten as if in defence against gangs of robbers ; at night people did not even prepare their beds, and several Taoist doctors were selling charms against the evil. The magistrates suspected them of having invented the matter, and they were on the point of chastising them, when they escaped, and the apparitions too occurred no more (249)."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol.

Domestic Animals in Demonology @ Notwithstanding the general prevalence in China of the domesticated cat, tales about cat-demons are scarce there in literature, so that it is tolerably evident that this class of evil beings has never occupied a pre-eminent place in its superstition. Very interesting p.610 and instructive, however, is an episode of high court-life in the year 598, described in the Standard Annals, and teaching us that China at that time had her witches believed to employ cat-demons for works of iniquity. It is in the following words that the historian relates it : « Tuh-hu T‘o’s character had a tendency towards heresy. Madam Kao, his maternal grandmother, served a cat-spectre and had therewith killed her brother-in-law Kwoh Sha-lo, and from her this practice had entered his dwelling. The emperor had been secretly apprised of it, but did not believe it. It then happened that the empress Hien, and madam Ching, the consort of Yang Su (see Book I, p. 1406 seq.), fell ill simultaneously. The physicians, called in to see the patients, declared unanimously that this was caused by a cat-demon. The emperor, taking into consideration that Tuh-hu T‘o was a younger brother of that empress by a different mother, and that his wife was a younger sister of Yang Su by an other mother, concluded that it must be his work. He gave secret orders to his elder brother Muh to display his (fraternal) affection and admonish him, and having sent away his officers in attendance, warned him himself, but T‘o denied everything, and the emperor, displeased with this, reduced his rank to that of prefect of Ts‘ien-cheu ; and as he expressed discontent, he appointed Kao Kung, Su Wei, Hwang-fu Hiao-sü, and Yang Yuen in commission to bring T‘o to justice. A female slave of T‘o, named Sü O-ni, made the following confession : The practice came from the house of T‘o’s mother,"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 142 who regularly served cat-spectres ; she sacrificed to them at night on every tszĕ day, because, as she said, tszĕ corresponds with the Rat 1, and whenever a cat-spectre had killed somebody, the possessions of the victim secretly came into the house where the beast was kept. Once T‘o had asked his family for some liquor, and on his wife answering that she lacked money to buy it, he had said to O-ni : — Tell the cat-devil to go to the house of Mr. Yueh and procure us money enough, on which O-ni had uttered her spells. A few days after that, the cat-spectre had gone to Yang Su’s house. And finally, on the emperor’s return from Ping-cheu, T‘o had said to her in the park : — Tell the cat-spectre to go to the abode of the empress and make her give me more ; on which she had pronounced her spells p.611 as before and the spectre had entered the palace. Now Yang Yuen in the outer office at the gate sent O-ni away to call the cat-spectre. That same evening she set out a bowl of fragrant rice-gruel, and drumming against it with the spoon, exclaimed : — Come pussy, do not remain in the palace now. After some time her countenance turned quite blue, and she moved as if she were trailed by somebody, and she exclaimed : — Here is the cat-spectre. The emperor now put the matter into the hands of his Ministers of State. The advice of Niu Hung, lord of Khi-chang, was : — When spectral evil is produced by men, its effects may be stopped by killing those men. So the emperor gave orders to place T‘o and his wife on an ox-car, and was on the point of ordering them to commit suicide at home,  1 See for the explanation on page 987 of Book I."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 143 when T‘o’s younger brother Ching, a Chamberlain for the judgment of merits, appeared in the palace and implored his mercy. The result was that T‘o was granted his life, but he was divested of all his dignities, and his wife, madam Yang, was made a Buddhist nun. Before that time a man had lodged a complaint that his mother had been murdered by the cat-spectre of somebody, but the emperor had considered this to be ghost-tale nonsense, and sent him away with indignation ; now, however, he ordered the families accused of setting such spectres to work to be exterminated. T‘o died not long after (250). p.612 This is a valuable illustration, indeed, of the astounding credulity which in those times swayed even crowned head and ministers. The Standard Annals teach us, that in the following century imperial consorts implicitly believed also in the possibility of persons changing themselves after death into cats, to take revenge upon those who were their persecutors during life. Thus they relate how Siao Liang-ti, a favourite court-lady of Kao Tsung and of his consort Wang, was disgraced together with this empress, in consequence of the calumnies and intrigues of Chao-i, who supplanted the latter in the imperial favours and became the famous empress Wu or Tseh-t’ien (comp. p. 591). The two women being accused by her of sorcery, « the emperor decreed that they should be degraded to the rank of commoners and imprisoned in the palace, and that the empress’mother and brothers with Liang-ti’s whole clan should be banished to the south of the Sierra (to Kwangtung and Kwangsi). On this, Hü King-tsung came forward with a memorial to demonstrate that Jen-yiu (the late father of the deposed empress) had no extra merits, so that his whole clan ought to be exterminated and his coffin hacked in pieces because of that offence now committed against the Court. A resolution then was issued to the effect that Jen-yiu was divested of all his (former) offices and dignities ; the empress and Liang-ti were killed by the empress Wu. Before this, the emperor’s thoughts had reverted to his former consort and he had proceeded to the place of her confinement. p.613 "},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 144 Here he was accosted by her ; — Your Majesty, said she, is so kind as to remember our former happy days ; when I die, and revive to behold the sun and the moon again, then, I pray, make here (in the palace) an abode for me, to which my heart may revert. — I will do so immediately, was the imperial answer, but no sooner did the empress Wu know of it than she compelled him to order the two women to receive a hundred lashes and to have their hands and feet chopped off ; these she tied together, and cast them into a wine-jar, saying she wanted to make the two ladies tipsy to their very bones. After some days they were dead, and then their corpses were mutilated. When the emperor’s order reached them, Liang-ti cursed their enemy, saying : — The vulpine tricks of Wu even here hover over us, but I shall become a cat, and Wu shall be changed by me into a rat, and then I will throttle her in vengeance for the wrong she has done me. The empress was informed of this threat, and forbade any cats to be kept in her six palace-buildings (251). A demon of a non-descript hazy shape, turning out to be a kind of horse, is represented to us in a tradition recorded in the Memoirs concerning the District of Wu-ch‘ing, which forms a part of the province of Chehkiang. Its hero is a famous warrior who played a leading part in the bloody troubles connected with the downfall of the Ts‘in dynasty in the third century before our era. « When Hiang Yü beat a retreat before his enemies in the Wu region, he crossed a broad stream in which a strange beast lived, that p.614 every morning and every evening intercepted some people with its tail and devoured them. He placed himself astride of this brute, grasped its neck with one hand and threw the other around a tree, several big stems being thus uprooted in succession. When daylight broke, they saw that it was a horse, covered all over with the figures of a black dragon (252)."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 145 The following tale furnishes a good illustration of the belief that donkeys are apt to haunt mankind in indistinct forms : « In the first year of the T‘ien pao period (A. D. 742) there lived in Ch‘ang-ngan, in the village of Yen-sheu, one Wang Hiun. One night some three persons had assembled in his dwelling to have a meal. They had just finished it, when on a sudden a big arm appeared under the candle-light. Hiun and his friends were startled, yet they inspected the thing together, and saw that it was black and very hairy. After a while a voice was heard beyond the light : — Sir, you have guests, but may I call on you for one moment ? I want some meat, put some into my hand. Hiun, unable to discern from whom these words came, forthwith gave some ; on which the arm was withdrawn. Shortly after it was stretched out again. — I was so pleased, sir, that you gave me some meat, said the voice ; it is almost finished now, give me some more ; and again Hiun put some meat into that hand, and again it vanished. Now the men after some deliberation concluded that it must be of a spectre, and that they should on its return hack off the arm. Some moments passed, and there it was again ; they grasped their swords, and they hewed it off. As it fell to the ground, the body of the spectre made away ; and the men stooping down to look at the arm, perceived that it was the leg of a donkey, and that quite a stream of blood stained the soil. Next morning they followed the bloody print, in order to find the brute. It had run straight into a house in the hamlet. The inmates whom they interrogated, told them that they had had in their house an ass for more than twenty years, which had p.615 lost a leg that night, apparently by a sword-blow, and that this case had just caused them much consternation. Hiun told them circumstantially what had befallen him, on which they killed the beast and ate it (253)."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 146 Thus again we see that the wounding of a beast in human shape entails a similar mutilation of the corresponding part of its animal body (comp. page 549). To pass now to other domestic animals. The ancient Chinese, as we have seen on page 536, gave a goat-form to the spectres inhabiting the ground, probably because they took the written form of the name fen-yang of those beings for ideographic characters. In the literature of later ages those ground-demons no longer occur in a goat’s shape, and the rôle of the goat merely amounts to that of other animals, that is to say, under human or indistinct ghostly forms it plays antics and dangerous tricks, the effects of which may, however, be frustrated by human sagacity, wisdom and intrepidity. Yü Pao relates : « When Sung Ting-poh of Nan-yang (Honan pr.) was young, he, while walking in the dark, met with a spectre. He interrogated it, and it said : — I am a spectre, but who are you, sir ? — I am also a spectre, said Ting-poh, to deceive it. — And where are you going ? the ghost asked again. — To the market of Yuen, was the reply. p.616 — I am likewise going there, rejoined the other ; and they walked a few miles together, when the spectre remarked : — We go too slow ; what do you think of carrying each other on our shoulders in turn ? — Very good ! retorted Ting-poh. The ghost was the first to carry him. After a few miles it laid : — You are too heavy to be taken for a spectre, sir. — I did not become a spectre till quite recently, hence I am still heavy,"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 147 and with this answer he shouldered the spectre, which weighed almost nothing. Both had had their turn two or three times, when Ting-poh observed : — Being a new spectre, I do not know what we have to shun and to fear. — There is nothing we dislike so much as human spittle, was the reply. Thus again they proceeded, till they come to some water. Ting-poh bade the spectre to wade it first, and listened sharply, but he heard no noise at all. He himself, however, while wading caused the water to gurgle, which led the spectre to say : — What that noise caused by ? — By the fact that one who has died only a short time ago is not versed in the crossing of streams ; do not feel astonished about me. When close to the market of Yuen, Ting-poh, who just then had the spectre on his shoulders, suddenly grasped it. Heedless of its loud piercing shrieks, he bound it with a rope, and without paying any further attention to its words straightway took it to that market. Here on being put down it changed into a goat. He spat on the animal, lest it should re-assume its other shape, sold it for fifteen hundred coins, and passed on (254). p.617 In this tale it is the clever, bold man who outwits the spectre. In the following, however, the rôles are reversed, and spectres under the shape of goats delude the man : « Chu Hwa, a Loh-yang mail, used to make a living by trading in goats. In the first year of the Ching yuen period of the T‘ang dynasty (A. D. 785) he had travelled westward as far as Pin-ning, to exchange his goats for others, when a man saw him and said : — You try to enrich yourself by dealing in goats... well, if you change yours for bigger ones, you will get a smaller number, and if"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 148 you exchange them for smaller ones, you get more of them ; in the latter case your gains will be great. Hwa agreed to this opinion, and said : — If you know somebody who has little kids, I will exchange all my goats against them. After a few days, that same man introduced to him an owner of goats, to whom he parted with his own for one hundred and ten young kids. With his animals big and small in one flock, he returned to Loh-yang, but at the Pass-gate the kids he had obtained by that transaction one evening changed into spectres all at once, and ran away. Terribly scared, and not understanding what might be the cause of that phenomenon, Chu Hwa returned the next morning to Pin-ning to see the aforesaid owner of those kids. In the heat of his indignation he was about to arrest him and take him before the magistrates, when the man asked : — What wrong did I do ? — You gave me those kids in exchange for mine ; I drove them to the Pass-gate, and they all changed there into spectres ; must not this be black art on your part ? — And you, rejoined the man, you traffic in goats by p.618 whole droves, thus destroying lives for the purpose of gain ; do not you know or remember that this is the acme of all crimes against Universal Heaven ? you entirely overlook your own deeds, and against mine you turn your anger ; I am a spectre ; I shall set those goats to catch and murder you. With these words he vanished, and Hwa was so terror-struck that he by his own hand died at Pin-ning 1.  1 Khi shi luh or Record of Strange Matters, quoted in the T S, sect. *, ch. 114.

V 149 To appropriate surreptitiously the worship and sacrifices destined by people for their patron divinities, is a trick played not by foxes only, but also by goats or bocks. Yü Pao tells us, that under « the Han dynasty there lived a man in the Ts‘i region, named Liang Wen, so devoted to Taoism that he had set apart in his house a room with three or four compartments for sacrificing to a god. A black curtain hung there above its throne, and for more than ten years it had always resided behind it. Once when a sacrifice was being offered to it, a human voice was heard behind the curtain : — I am the prince of the high hills, it said ; I am able to consume great quantifies of food and liquor, and in curing diseases I work with good results ; Wen, you have served me for a series of years with the utmost reverence, so you may come behind this curtain now ; the god is drunken. Wen begged permission to respectfully view the face of the god. — Give me your hand, was the answer ; he stretched it out, and p.619 caught hold of the beard on the god’s chin. It was a very long beard ; gently he twisted it around his hand, and then suddenly gave a tug, and — the bleat of a buck was heard from the throne of the god. The affrighted bystanders sprang up and helped Wen to pull, and behold, it was a goat of Yuen Kung-lu, which had been lost seven or eight years ago, and was never traced. Now they put an end to its tricks by killing it (255). The pig occurs in Chinese demonology with much the same attributes as the fox and the dog, inasmuch as shrewd specimens of its kind may assume the forms of women, to bewitch the other sex by their charms and indulge their passions. We learn this from the following tales : « Li Fen was a man of the Shang-yü district in Yueh-cheu. He was fond of country scenery, and therefore dwelt on mount Szĕ-ming.

Unable to guess from whom these sounds proceeded, he asked : — Who is there so late in the night at this country-house ? — I am charmed by the nice voice of a talented man, replied a smiling woman. He opened the gate, and his eyes fell on a regular beauty, quite peerless, but who, as he perceived, had a deep black colour about her mouth. — Are you not a ghost, or an immortal ? he asked. — No, she replied ; I am the daughter of Chang, who dwells here p.620 in the hills ; this night my parents are attending a feast in the village to the east, and in the mean time I am coming here furtively to pay you a visit . . . . . . . . They drew the curtains, and did no more pay any attention to the lamp ; and the lute was dumb. On a sudden the morning cock announced daybreak. The woman rose and took her leave, but Fen, quite in love and unwilling to part with her, stole one of her blue felt shoes, and concealed it in his clothes’ basket. Then, quite drowsy, he fell asleep. The woman caressed him, and sought her shoe, wailing and weeping. — Please do not keep it ; I will come back here this evening ; if you keep it I am sure to die ; respectfully I entreat you to be so kind as to restore it to me.

He followed the bloody track downhill, and it led him straightway into the sty of Mr. Chang, where the pig, on seeing him come, grunted at him with an angry glare. He told the whole matter to Chang with all the details, and this gentleman, affrighted and astonished, boiled the beast. Fen gave up this country-house for another place to ramble in (256). p.621 Yü Pao further relates : « A member of the gentry under the Tsin dynasty, bearing the surname Wang, lived in the Wu region. Journeying home, he came to a bend (in the river), where, as it was growing dusk, the crew pulled up the boat against a large dam. Here he beheld a maid of seventeen or eighteen, whom he called, and spent the night with her. At daybreak he untied a metal jingle and fastened it to her arm ; then he told his men to follow her, and when they came to her house they found no maid, but on passing the pig-sty saw a sow with that jingle on its ankle (257). Let us finally quote an interesting tale showing that buried domestic animals, if their carcasses do not decay, may haunt people as spectres : « A villager of T‘ung-tsing, situated in Kiang-ning, had kept a cow for more than ten years, in which time it had given birth to twenty-eight calves, thus yielding much profit to its owner. It was now too old to draw the plough, and all the butchers asked him to sell it, but the owner could not make up his mind to thus dispose of the animal. He entrusted it to a boy, to take devout care of it till it should die a natural death, and after its death he buried it in the ground.

The enraged owner seized a sword and hacked off its four feet ; then he slit up its belly and poured out dung and filth over it ; and the beast thereafter remained quiet. They opened the ground again, and found the cow in a state of decay (258). 7. Reptile-Spectres @ Fei Ch‘ang-fang, the matchless wonderworker, who, as we saw on page 582, could discern horse-riding foxes through their human disguise, is also stated in the Standard History of his time to have unmasked and utterly baffled a horrid tortoise-spectre. « In Jü-nan there appeared year by year a spectre, which, assuming the attire of the Governor, haunted the drummers at the gate of the mansion of this grandee, much to the distress of the inhabitants of that region. Once the spectre fell in with Ch‘ang-fang, who just then called on the Governor. Horror and fear nailed it to the spot ; then advancing, it put off its official dress and cap, knocked its head against the ground, and begged for its life. Ch‘ang-fang reprimanded it ; — And now, he concluded, forthwith resume your old shape here in the central courtyard. Immediately it turned into an old tortoise as large as a car-wheel, p.623 with a neck a chang long. He ordered the monster to go to the Governor and avow its crimes, and he handed a letter to it, containing some order to the king of the Koh dyke.

D. 581-601) the apartments and courts of the Palace were haunted every night by a man who teased and provoked the waiters. The intendants reported it to the emperor, who said : — The watch kept at the gates is so strict ; I do not understand where anybody could possibly pass and enter ; it must be an evil spirit. Should you meet with it, he told the waiters, then cut it down. Thus, when a being like a man appeared in the night and mounted their couch, they drew their swords and struck. It was as if the blows fell upon dry bones ; the thing tumbled from the couch and ran away, the servants after it, and it plunged into a pond. Next day the emperor ordered this pond to be drained, and then a tortoise was found in it, over a foot in diameter, with sword-cuts on its back. They killed it, and the matter was herewith finished (260). With sundry other animals, tortoises have been the bugbears of East Asia as authors of dangerous diseases. « In days of yore, T‘ao Ts‘ien relates, a man was smitten with disease in his p.624 abdomen, together with a slave of his. All attempts to cure them were vain. When the slave was dead, they cut open his belly and examined it, and found a white tortoise in it with very bright red eyes. They poured (extracts of) poisonous herbs over the beast and put such herbs into its beak ; but nothing could harm or even affect it, and they tied it to the leg of a couch. Unexpectedly a visitor arrived to see the patient. He rode a white horse, the urine of which bespattered the tortoise. The reptile took fright and sought to escape quickly from the urine, but being tied up, it could not get away. It retracted its head, neck and feet into its shell, and the sick man, who saw it, said to his son : — Perhaps my disease may be cured with such urine."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 154 They poured some urine of a white horse over the tortoise by way of experiment, and forthwith dissolved some in several pints of water ; and the patient taking in this way more than a pint of urine by potions, was cured thoroughly (261). Tortoises may be extremely dangerous also when hidden in the ground, and people have been suddenly smitten with disease and other evil by passing overhead. « Li Tsung was Governor of Ch‘u, when within his territory a Buddhist nun, who made her round in the market, suddenly sank to the ground, sat down, and could not be made to move. For many days there occurred cases then of people who could not eat or speak, so that the officials informed Li Tsung of it. He ordered the military to carry the nun away and dig on the spot, and they found there a huge tortoise, some feet in length. When they had taken the beast into the water, the nun recovered (262). p.625 The t‘o, a species of gavial or alligator stated by some native authors to attain a considerable length, is another beast with the doubtful reputation of changing itself sometimes into a woman to seduce lewd men, and acting as a devil of sickness. « Chang Fuh, a Yung-yang man, while travelling home by boat, one evening saw by the river-bank in a waste part of the country a maid with very beautiful features, who moved towards him in a small canoe and said : — It is dark, I am afraid of tigers ; I dare not travel by night. — Where are you going, asked Fuh, that you travel in such a thoughtless way without a rain-hat on ? be quick, get into my boat ; here you will not get wet from the rain. After some friendly discourse, the woman entered Fuh’s sleeping-berth, tying her canoe to his boat. After the third watch the rain cleared off, and by the moonlight Fuh perceived that the woman was a big gavial, which was using his arm for a sleeping-pillow. He sprang to his feet with fright, and was about to seize the beast, but"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 155 it quickly ran away, plunged into the water, and swam to the canoe, which was a rotten stump of a tree, over a chang in length (263). « A prefect of the Kiai district had a daughter, who was under the influence of demonry. The doctors tried their arts upon her, with no result. Then the father applied to one Tung Fung to cure her, promising that if he managed to restore her health she should become his wife. Fung accepted this proposal, and called forth a white gavial, several chang long. It crawled over the ground to the door of the sick girl, where Fung told the attendants to kill it with their swords. Immediately the p.626 girl’s health was restored, and he accepted her as his wife (264). « The Buddhist monk Chuh-yao had obtained a spell possessing divine power, which enabled him to completely overpower demonry. The unmarried daughter of the prince of Kwang-ling fell sick under the influence of demonry, and Yao entered the house to cure her. With closed eyes he upbraided the spectre ; — Thou old devil, he exclaimed, why dost thou forget to behave in accordance with the Tao and dost attack men ? Upon these words the girl loudly wailed ; — They are murdering my husband ! she cried, while the spectre beside her exclaimed : — My last hour has now come. Then in an outburst of sobs and sighs it said : — Against such godly power I cannot fight, and changed into an old gavial, which ran out into the courtyard. Here Yao ordered it to be beaten to death (265).

Tales of snake-demons"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 156 are remarkably numerous there. They tell of victims to the wrath of snakes, incurring death, illness or misfortune, either themselves alone, or with their families ; in some legends we hear of such catastrophes brought about without any provocation whatever. But impartiality compels us to avow, that according to at least as many stories, apparitions of vipers and serpents have proved to be propitious. Like spectres in general, snake-demons appear in Chinese myth as instruments of punishment. Thus, towards the close of the reign of the Tsin dynasty such a being foreboded and prepared the ruin p.627 of Chu-koh Ch‘ang-min, a bold warrior who had routed many an army, but indulged in such insatiable rapacity in his territory, that his discontented subjects murdered him along with the principal members of his family. « After having become wealthy and famous, so runs the Standard History of his time, he was always frightened out of his sleep some ten nights in one month, and then skipped about as if fighting with somebody. Mao Siu-chi once passing the night with him, saw him in such a panic, and asked him what was the matter. — I see a beast, quite black and hairy, but I cannot discern any legs of it ; its uncommon strength is more than mine, I cannot prevail over it. After this it returned several times, and everywhere in the house the head of a snake appeared on the pillars and in the rafters of the roof. Ch‘ang-min told his men to hang up swords there (to frighten it), and to strike at the monster ; but it regularly recoiled before those weapons, to re-appear as soon as they were withdrawn. They beat it also with washing-mallets. It spoke with the inmates as if it were a man, but nobody could understand it. A huge hand some seven or eight feet long was then seen on the wall with a wrist several spans thick, but it vanished entirely when he gave orders to strike at it. Not long after this, Ch‘ang-min was murdered (266)."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 157 But not only the wicked were in old China persecuted by demoniacal serpents. The T‘ai p‘ing kwang ki gives us a legend about such a monster having haunted no less a worthy than Confucius. « Yen Hwui and Tszĕ-lu were seated at the gate of the sage, when a spectre came and tried to call on him. Its eyes beamed like suns, and at that moment it looked so awesome that p.628 Tszĕ-lu lost his senses ; his lips stiffened, and he could not utter a sound, but Yen Yuen (Yen Hwui) took his shoes, his club and his sword, stepped to the front, and seized the spectre by its hips. On this it changed into a snake, which he slew immediately with his sword. The Master came out to see what happened, and said with a sigh : — The bold man has no fear, and wisdom is not misled ; the wise man is not bold, and the bold does not always possess wisdom (267). A ghastly tale of a huge serpent deceiving under a human shape a whole family with the object of gratifying its lusts on an innocent girl, is recounted by T‘ao Ts‘ien. « In the T‘ai yuen period of the Tsin dynasty, a member of the gentry married a girl in a neighbouring village. The time fixed for the nuptials having come, the family of the bridegroom sent out their men to fetch the bride, and the relations of the latter let her go, but sent her foster-mother to accompany her. The procession reached a double gate and a series of halls, as if it were the mansion of a prince. Torches flared before the pillars, and a slave maiden, gorgeously apparelled, kept watch beside them. And the back apartment, was furnished with curtains and tapestry of great beauty. The night came, and the maid embraced her nurse, weeping silently. Then stealthily the matron passed her hand over her behind the curtains, and felt a snake as thick as a pillar of several spans, coiled around the bride from head to feet. Horror-struck she ran out of the house, and saw that the slave maid charged with the"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 158 torches at the pillars was a smaller serpent, and that the torch-lights were snake-eyes (268). p.629 We find the snake as a devil of disease as early as the writings of the Han dynasty. These relate, that « in the time of the emperor Chang (A. D. 76-89) there lived one Sheu Kwang-heu, who could prosecute and punish all kwei and mei, ordering them to fetter themselves and to render their forms visible. A fellow villager of his had a wife, smitten with sickness by a mei. Kwang-heu arraigned this being, and found a large snake of several chang, dead outside the gate (269). Variations on this theme are not unfrequent in books of earlier and later time. Old and numerous also are the tales of men and women who, having fallen ill, vomited snakes or vipers. And no wonder, for rustic simplicity, by stretch of fancy, would at all times have readily exaggerated intestine worms of all sorts to the bulk of snakes. In the Lieh sien ch‘wen, which may have been written under the Han dynasty or shortly after it, it is related of Yuen Suh, a famous seller of drugs and nodules with universal curative power, « that the prince of Ho-kien, who had constipation, bought drugs of him and took them, with the effect that he excreted more than ten snakes. This maleficent vermin does not in China always glide into the human body in a gentle way or imperceptibly ; they sometimes make their entrance with rough violence, raging and gnawing inside with ferocity. Peculiarly instructive on this head is the case of « one Ts‘in Chen, a villager of P‘eng-hwang in Khüh-o, into whose brains a serpent-like beast worked its way. When it came, he scented a foul stench ; thereupon it bored through his nose and coiled itself up in his head ; he perceived a buzzing sound, and distinctly heard a crunching, as if something were gnawing at his brains.

V 159 apertures, and for several years nothing ailed him, except a pressure in his head (270). There are also instances on record of snakes having caused illness by sending their souls into the bodies of their victims. « In the district of P‘i, a commoner caught on the bank of a ditch at the south wall of the city, a little snake, somewhat more than a foot long. He cut out its five intestines, then coiled it up, put an awl through it, and dried it over a fire. After some days, a son of the family, a few years old, suddenly became red with vesicular eruptions over his whole body ; his skin cracked as if it were roasted, and he exclaimed : — You have murdered me without any charge of guilt having been brought against me ; then you have cut the intestines out of my belly and put me over a fire ; this is why I make your child smart under those sufferings. The family on hearing these words were terror-struck and filled with amazement. They took the snake, extracted the bamboo awl, and moistened it with water ; then they burned incense, prayed to it, and took it back to the place where it had been found. After some time it wriggled away, and the child was restored to health 1. Some books make mention of ophidian reptiles acting as devils of disease under the name of ‘celestial snakes’. We are unable p.631 to discover what the Chinese understand by these beings. There exists an asterism of the same name, somewhere by Pegasus, but whether there is a connection between it and the demon in question, we cannot say. Perhaps we have here to do with a mere invention of quark doctors, magicians and exorcists. The only Chinese in whose writings we have found any mention of the matter is the author of the Mung khi pih t‘an. « In the T‘ai p‘ing period (circa A. D. 976), when Yun Kwan-khi was in government function in the circuit of Kwang-nan and Kwang-si  1 K K, ch. 459 ; from the Luh i ki, or Writings on Recorded Wonders, eight chapters on fabulous matters, by Tu Kwang-t‘ing, a Taoist priest who lived in the latter part of the ninth century."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 160 (eastern Yunnan), a lower official was poisoned by some animal ; his body was covered all over with gatherings, and a physician who declared himself able to cure him, was called in and bidden to examine the patient. — He is stung by a celestial snake, said this man, and as the disease in now deep in his body, nothing can be done against it. By applying some drugs to the ulcers and thrusting needles into the swollen spots, he caught more than ten snake-like beasts, and the disease did not recur. « And close to my grandfather’s tomb at Si-khi in Ts‘ien-t‘ang, a farmer was attacked by leprosy. His body was covered with running ulcers, and he cried and shrieked as if his last hour had come. A Buddhist monk of Si-khi, who understood the case, declared : — Here we have a case of poisoning by a celestial snake ; it is no leprosy. He fetched some bark of a tree, decocted it, and gave the patient over a pint of the juice to drink, prescribing him large doses of it ; next day the disease was reduced to one half of its virulence, and after two or three days it was cured. I have found out that that bark was from the hazelnut. But after all I know not what a heavenly serpent is. Some say it is a yellow flower spider, living in the shrubs, and that when a man is stung by it and moreover moistened by the dew, he gets this disease. Thus let those who walk in the dew be careful (271). p.632 We thus learn that the diseases ascribed to that celestial reptile are certain forms of leprosy or ulcerous affections caused by its bites or stings. Even snake-like shadows may be very dangerous should they by any means enter a man’s body. This need not, of course, astonish us greatly, since we know quite well that the shadows of beings are identified with their souls. Ying Shao related the following anecdote in the second century of our era :"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 161 « When my grandfather Ch‘en was prefect of Kih, he went to see the general tax-collector Tu Süen on the day of the summer-solstice, and offered him some liquor. Just then there hung a red bow on the wall at the north side of the apartment, which cast a snake-like shadow into the cup. This intimidated Süen and filled him with aversion against the liquor, but he dared not refuse to drink, and from that day he had cutting pains in his breast and belly. His power to digest food and drink was impaired ; he became very weak and lean, and though his disease was combatted and treated in a myriad of ways, no cure was effected. Ch‘en then went to the dwelling of Süen, having some business there, and saw him. He asked him how it was that this change had come over him, and the answer was, that he was filled with fear of that snake, this beast having entered his belly. Ch‘en now returned to his judgment seat and pondered on the matter a good while, when his eyes fell on the suspended bow. Convinced that this object must have been the cause of all the trouble, he told one of his writers at the gate of his mansion to fetch Süen in a sedan-chair ; then he set out spirits on the same spot, and again the snake actually appeared in the cup. — It was the shadow of the bow there on the wall, he said to Süen, and no spectre. On these words the other cheered up and felt quite comfortable, and he regained his health from this very moment. He rose in official service to the rank of a Minister, and became Governor of four regions successively, in high repute as a man of commanding presence 1. p.633 We will conclude with a tale of a toad-demon, related in a work of the T‘ang dynasty.  1 Fung-suh tung i, ch. 9.

A wu was called in to treat her, who put up a sacrificial altar, had drums and clarinets played, and operated on her with spells. Just then a man in a passenger-boat, which happened to be moored in the river at the end of the quay, laid himself down by the gangway to sleep, and saw in a concealed ditch a toad as big as a bowl, with red eyes and hairy legs, dancing at the sound of the drums. He took a bamboo pole, hauled up the beast, and tied it to an oar. At the same moment he heard the girl exclaim : — Why do you bind my husband ? On this he knocked at the house, and said to the owner : — I can cure diseases like this. The other, rejoiced in his inmost heart, asked how much pay he desired. — Not more than a few thousand coins, was the answer. — I love my daughter above everything, and the attempts to cure her have relieved me up to this time of so many hundred strings of coins, that I do not care about a few thousand coins more if her health can be bought for them ; I will give you twice that sum. The passenger now simmered the toad in oil, and next day the girl was hale and healthy (272). 8.

V 163 literature to suggest the idea that there must also exist tales about bird-shaped demons, being for instance wrathful souls of men who suffered death by violence or injustice. This presumption is largely confirmed by the facts. « In the reign of the emperor Hwui, in the second year of the Yung hi period (A. D. 291), we read in a book of the fourth century, a ‘wounded soul bird’ was presented to that monarch from the principality of Shang-shan. Its shape was that of a fowl, but its feathers were coloured like a pheasant. The emperor refused to accept it, because he abhorred its name, but on the other hand he liked it for its feathers. Then a man with much knowledge of animals spoke : — When the emperor Hwang had put to death Ch‘i-yiu (see Book I, p. 1403), an ounce attacked a woman with its teeth, mistaking her for another person, but she was still breathing on the seventh day, and the emperor out of pity buried her in a double coffin in a vault of stone. Then a bird soared over the grave, screaming out that it was the wounded soul ; it was indeed the soul of that woman. Thenceforth, whenever people died without the ordinance of fate that so it must be, such birds gathered in that kingdom in the fields and forests. So it was under the dynasty of Han, at the close of the reign of Ngai and P‘ing, when (the usurper) Wang Mang destroyed so many wise and good men ; the bird then appeared so often with piteous p.635 screaming, that mankind loathed its name. Orders were then sent to Shang-shan to drive away the birds with arrows, but it was not until the rise of the present Tsin dynasty, when shields and spears were laid aside and the world between the four seas was subdued far and wide, that the birds only from time to time appeared in the wilds. Out of the dread which their name aroused, this was changed from siang hwun (wounded soul) into siang hung. Sun Hao (the last sovereign of the house of Wu, dethroned by that of Tsin) then was invested with the dignity of feudal ruler of Kwei-ming (to present his soul from becoming revengeful and changing into such a bird), and the meaning of the"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol.

Sighs then resounded at the gates, and wailing in the streets, and Shang-shan came forth again with its tribute ; but the birds were let loose and chased away (273). Notwithstanding that every bird, as indeed any sort of animal, may turn into a spectre, yet a rather limited number of species of the feathered tribe appear in Chinese demonology. Among them we find the cock. « Within the Tai-kiün principality, a fabulist of the fifth century relates, stood a pavilion haunted by spectres, to whose tricks it was impossible to put an end. One evening, some students, men strong and bold, went thither, wishing to pass the night in it. The keeper of the building told them not to do so, p.636 but with the words : — We can by our nature dispel those spectres, they put up in it. On taking supper, a hand playing a flute with five holes came forth in front of the place where they sat. This sight made them burst into laughter. — How can you handle a flute over its whole length with the one hand you have ? they said to the spectre, we will play it for you. But the spectre rejoined : — Do you think that I have not fingers enough ? and it put forth another hand with several times ten fingers on it. Now the graduates conceived that the right moment to deal their blows had come ; they drew their swords and hacked at the hand, and they found an old cock (274). In the year 614 of our era, one Wang Tsih, the happy possessor of a very miraculous mirror, « departed for Pien, in the land of Sung (Honan pr.).

Tsih stayed there for a night, and no sooner had he heard the shrieks of the girl than he brought forth his mirror and let it flash upon her. — He with the comb is murdered, she exclaimed ; and under her bed there lay a large cock, quite dead, the host’s old cock of seven or eight years 1. p.637 « A certain Yang, a Ts‘ing-yuen man (Shansi pr.), was a vice-commander of the garrison of that province. There was a plot of open ground by the western wall.

All the family without exception ran away in a panic. Yang then came home, and hearing of the incident seized a stick and attacked the spectre, but it appeared and disappeared in the four corners with so quick a succession of metamorphoses that the stick could not in any way hit it. With increased rage he exclaimed : — I shall come back after dinner to beat it to death ; on which the spectre stopped forward with a bow, and said :  1 Wang Tu ku king ki.

The elder one went to the kitchen to cut meat and prepare his dinner, but when she placed the meat on the cutting-stone, it suddenly vanished. With the knife in her hand she told this to her father, when from under the stone a big, black feathered hand appeared, and a voice said : — Cut it, please. The girl ran away till she was out of breath, and became ill from the effects. The other daughter took some salt out of a great pot, when a big monkey burst forth from it and climbed on her back ; she ran away, and not till she was in the hall did she get rid of the beast. She too became ill. p.638 A wu was then called ; he erected an altar to cure the girls, but the spectre put up an altar also, and performed (counter-)rites in a still more effectual way. No other wu proved able to conquer the spectre ; each of them was seized with fright, and died. Shortly after, the two daughters and the wife died. Then a man versed in the methods of dealing with demons, named Ming Kiao, was invited to recite holy books ; and in the first night the spectre went away, after having spit at Yang and scolded him. Thus these visitations ceased ; but Yang too died in that same year (275). Spectral animals in particular are crows or ravens, and owls. The voice and the presence of these birds are not merely ill-boding, but decidedly productive of evil, and that this was the case with the crow in very ancient times, is intimated by the verse of the Shi king, of which we gave the translation on page 576. « The white-necked crow, says the commentator of the Classic of Birds 1, is called by the people in the southwest the spectral sparrow, and its cawing means misfortune and evil.  1 Khin king, a small collection of short notes on birds, in one chapter.

The p.639 souls of slain crows may persecute their murderers with a shrewdness that souls of dead men could hardly improve upon. Thus a work on the T‘ang dynasty tells us : « When P‘ei Chung-ling was Governor of Kiang-ling, he sent his military commanders T‘an Hung-sheu and Wang Chih to the south of the Sierra (extending along the north of Kwangtung and Kwangsi). Having carried out their mission there, these men while travelling home came at a lodging-house in Kwei-lin, where they were croaked at by a flight of crows. Wang Chih flung a stone at them, and dashed out the brains of one, so that it dropt down dead into a bamboo grove. His companion T‘an Hung-sheu then suddenly got so severe a headache that he could not proceed with the journey. He told Wang Chih to travel on before him, and await him somewhere, or to inform his family of his condition, that they might send people to go and fetch him. Suddenly P‘ei Chung-ling dreamt that T‘an Hung-sheu told him he had been murdered on the way by Wang Chih, and that this man, after appropriating his money and other effects, had left his corpse in a bamboo copse. Before two days had elapsed, Wang Chih arrived and asked him for new orders, but the Governor summoned him to court, and as soon as he appeared before him delivered him over to the officers, who bamboo-ed him and subjected him to all the rigours of the law.

His family was rich, counting its wealth by myriads of coins, but he had an ugly wife, and a son of ten years old, both diseased in their loins and lower limbs. He had always hated them, and married four concubines, with whom he spent his days in pleasure. Once these concubines, when tipsy, advised him to divorce the ugly one with a hundred thousand coins. But the latter’s resolution to bring the matter before the authorities withheld him. So he and the concubines contrived another plot. That night they gave the poor woman liquor to drink, and then poisoned her, together with her son. But from the tenth day after the burial they saw two crows appear at every noontide to peck Ch‘ing-szĕ’s heart, causing him intolerable sufferings. It was impossible to drive them away ; senseless with despair he sank to the ground, and it was long ere he recovered consciousness. This went on for a year, a myriad of expedients to which recourse was had, proving ineffective to help him. It chanced that one Lo Kung-yuen, a Taoist doctor of Ts‘ing-ch‘ing, was wandering between the Hwai and Szĕ rivers. Him Ch‘ing-szĕ entreated to visit his house, and asked if he had any magical art to avert the evil and help him. — Wronged souls are at work here, the doctor replied ; they have laid an accusation before the Emperor of Heaven, and have been authorised by Heaven to wreak vengeance upon men ; in such cases no magic can stop them ; the only way to obtain absolution from the sins committed is to put up a Taoist altar adorned with the yellow charms, and there to appeal to Heaven with reverence.     notes and tales on the eighth century and the first quarter of the ninth, ascribed to Li Chao, a high officer.

V 169 Ch‘ing-szĕ did so for the space of three days and three nights. After the second day the black birds ceased their visits, and then, his wife and his son appeared to him in a dream. — Unjustly you destroyed by poison the lives of us both, mother and son, they said ; we denounced you for it to the Emperor of Heaven, and He has allowed us to take revenge ; but on account of the virtuous work performed with yellow charms, the Most High has sent down an order, to the effect that we shall be reborn in Heaven, there to be rewarded with bliss ; we therefore loosen for ever the ties of revenge that bind us to you (277). p.641 As to the owl, of which several varieties are found in China, its nocturnal life and screeching no doubt are the principal reasons for its general investment with demoniacal attributes. It is deemed to be extremely ill-boding, especially the tufted species, called keu-koh, or denoted by various other names. Ch‘en Tsang-khi wrote in the first half of the eighth century : « When it enters a city, the city will be depopulated, and the same fate will befall the house into which it flies ; but it is harmless when it steadfastly remains in the same spot. When any one hears it emit a cry like a laugh, he should hurry away. In the northern countries there exist two varieties of this kind, called hiun and hu, resembling each other, and yet being distinct species ; they are named so from the sounds hiun and hu which they utter, have eyes like kittens, and are of the size of the khü-yuh ; should these birds emit a cry like a laugh, somebody is sure to die. Further we have the hiu-liu, also belonging to this kind, but smaller, and yellow ; it enters houses at night, and there gathers finger-nails ; becoming p.642 acquainted (therefrom ?) with the good and bad fortunes of the inmates. When it is caught, nails are found in its crop ; hence those who clip their nails bury them within the house (278). The ku-hwoh can fetch away the dual soul of man. According to the Hüen chung ki, this is a bird spectre, a kind of spirit, which, when it dresses itself with feathers, is a flying bird, and when it puts the"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 170 feathers off, becomes a woman ; this is said to be a woman transformed after having died in childbed, and therefore has two nipples on her breast, and is bent on snatching away the sons of others, to bring them up as her own. No family with young infants should leave the clothes of the latter in the open night-air, for if the bird, while flying around at night, marks them with spots of blood, the child will suddenly get convulsions from terror and also suffer from a kind of atrophy, named atrophy of the guiltless. This bird is abundant in King-cheu, and there too is called the spectre-bird (279). In the ninth century, Twan Ch‘ing-shih deemed this ornithological lore good enough for a place in his writings. He added that this nocturnal wanderer was called Daughter of the Emperor of Heaven, and tiao-sing, which may be the name of a star. He acquaints us with an owl, called ‘the spectral chariot’, notorious as a devil devoting itself to the theft of human souls : « p.643 The bird called the spectral chariot formerly had, according to tradition, ten heads, and could ravish human souls, but one of its heads was devoured by dogs. In the Ts‘in region, when the sky is dark, that bird sometimes produces a noise like of swords and chariots, but, according to some, this noise is caused by water-fowls passing through the air (280). Before Twan Ch‘ing-shih committed these notes to paper, Ch‘en Tsang-khi had written something about this dreaded soul-robber : « The spectral chariot flies about in the dark, crying, and sneaks into human dwellings, there to gather the souls and breath of men. Time was, according to tradition, when this bird had ten heads ; one was then devoured by dogs, and nine remained. Out of the place of that one head blood trickles continually, and should this come down upon a house, misfortune will befall it. When the inhabitants of King and Ch‘u (Hunan and Hupeh) hear the bird fly and cry in the night, they extinguish their lamps, and in order to prevail over it drum on the doors and twitch the ears of their dogs, for, they say, it is afraid of dogs (which once bit off its head) (281)."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 171 We read, indeed, in a ‘Calendar of Customs in the King and Ch’u regions’ (282), which was written in the sixth century : « In the first month of the year many spectre-birds migrate during the night. In every house the inmates hammer on the beds, and beat against the doors, pinch and twist the ears of the dogs, and extinguish lamps and candles, in order to ward them off. The stately crane, so highly esteemed and so generally appreciated in China as an emblem of longevity, there dishonours and p.644 debases itself now and then like a fox, by playing the devil of lewdness in human disguise. Thus, « in the reign of the emperor Hwai of the Tsin dynasty, in the Yung kia period (A. D. 307-313), one Sü Shih was out for a stroll, and in the field perceived a young maid of nice complexion, fresh and white. She approached him, they exchanged some words of endearment, and the girl sang this verse : Your good repute reached my ears a long time ago, And my heart has since waited for you for days and months ; How could I meet you, excellent man ? I longed for you, but owing to the distance no attachment could be formed. As soon as Shih’s love was in harmony with hers, she, in delight, invited him to a house, and there placed food and drink before him, with much fish. As he did not come home next day, his brothers tracked him, and found him sitting on the bank of the lake, face to face with the lady. They attacked her with their rattan canes, but she changed immediately into a white crane, which flew high up into the sky. Shih was quite bewildered, and it was more than a year ere he recovered (283). "},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 172 9. Piscine Devils @ Confucius, whose holiness, as we saw on page 628, did not safeguard him from attacks of serpent-demons in human shape, is stated by early authors to have had also a visit from a most diabolic man-fish. « In a fit of melancholy he was seated in a lodging-house at the ordered strings (of his lute), and was singing, when in the night a man appeared, over nine feet high, in a blackish dress and with a high cap. His harsh voice set all the attendants in commotion. Tszĕ-kung stepped forward and asked : — Who are you ? but the intruder seized him and gripped him under his arm. Then Tszĕ-hi came forth with a drawn bow, and fought the stranger in the courtyard. When after some moments the latter still stood unconquered, Confucius scanned him, and perceived that the pivots at the joints of his coat-of-mail opened now and then like the palm of a hand. — Why do not you test those joints ? he exclaimed, shoot him there, and run up the steps ! Tszĕ-lu did so, and thus stretched the stranger flat on the ground, where he became a big t‘i fish of over nine feet. Then Confucius said : — Wherefore did this beast come here ? I have heard, that when animals become old, all vital spirits (tsing) may possess them, and that then they appear where there is adversity. It must be this which brought this beast here ; would not its coming have some connexion or other with my fit of melancholy and distaste for food, or with diseases of those who follow me ? Yes, the six domestic animals, as also tortoises, snakes, fish, turtles, shrubs, trees, and so on, all become possessed in the long run by shen, and then they can haunt mankind as spectres, which I call the five yiu, that is to say, the five regions (points of the compass) corresponding with"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 173 the five elements, as all those regions contain such beings. Yiu means old, as such beings haunt when they are old. But their activity ceases when they are killed ; what evil then can impend now over me ? This incident may even be created by Heaven’s undiminished goodness to bind my fate (with firmer ties) ; wherefore else should that beast have come here ? Accordingly I need not desist from my lute-playing and my songs. Tszĕ-lu cooked the fish, which had a fine flavor ; and the ailing followers rose from their beds, so that next day the party could pursue its voyage (284). p.646 In a specially bad repute as a demon of disease is a fish designated by the name of shang. We read of it as follows : « The shang resembles the tench, and has red spots ; the largest specimens are over a ch‘ih long. It occurs in Yü-chang, where it lifts mostly in dirty and muddy ponds, sometimes by hundreds. These fishes can become tsu spectres, evil apparitions bewitching and bewildering men, and also capable of possessing them. The owners of fields and grounds in the neighbourhood of such pools dare not injure them, but they invoke them sometimes and present sacrifices to them, in order to improve their harvests, and thus they make their fields yield double crops. But the owners have to conceal their names, and to desert their fields after having cultivated them for three years, this being the sure way to escape the misfortune which those fishes cause. The ill they may bring upon men consists in this, that they turn the posture of their faces, hands and feet ; the way to be delivered from this evil is to pray and sue out a pardon. At night they can move over land, where they mark their path by muddy prints ; and on the spots they visit a sound like seu-seu is heard. The general-in-chief of the twenty-fifth division of the Emperor of the North has a charm which may conquer those tsu of the waters.

V 174 are sure to remove in consequence of a storm of wind and rain, or a thunderbolt. Those who understand this magic should apply it (285). p.647 To act as a devil of sickness, a fish needs by no means belong to a special kind. Under the T‘ang dynasty, a story runs, « one Liu I of Ho-tung sojourned in Loh-yang, and availing himself of the vernal weather was angling in the I, and caught a big fish, which he took home and placed in a basin with water. He had a child, not more than six or seven years old, which he dreamed that same night was bitten in the breast by a fish. With a shudder he awoke, just in time to hear the child cry. — I dreamt that a big fish was biting its breast, said he ; it is crying because it cannot endure the pain. As this tallied with his dream, he, in surprise, inspected the child’s breast, and his fright was great when he found on it pustules and blood. At daybreak he flung his fish into the stream ; then he ordered some Buddhist clergymen to recite sutras before painted images of the saints ; and in a little more than ten days the child’s pustules were cured. He never angled again (286). The cold blood peculiar to the fish tribe has not prevented Chinese authors from recording tales of fishes that, like so many other animal-demons, have cheated men and women by tempting, seducing or marrying them in human forms. Such stories are even told of crabs. « In Kin-ling, where crabs abound, there is an old tradition abroad of a crab the back of which measured five feet, and the legs of which had twice that length ; it appeared regularly in the dead of night to bite people. At that time there p.648 was in the country a chaste woman, still unmarried, though thirty years old. One night her house was assailed by robbers and she ran out of it, but found the giant crab across her path. On a sudden it stood before her as a beautiful youth, who seduced her.

V 175 — What spectre are you that dares dishonour me ? when I am dead I shall transform myself into a poisonous fog and therewith kill you ; and with there words she dashed her head against a rock with so much vehemence that she died. Next morning people found the crab dead on the road in a dense fog, and wayfarers were then no longer molested. And to this day many crabs lie torpid when fog is thick (287). 10. Insects as Demons @ Even insects are not too insignificant in China for a place among animal-demons. « In the I hi period of the Tsin dynasty, we learn from T‘ao Ts‘ien, one Koh Hwui-fu of Wu-shang was passing a night at the house of his wife’s family, when after the third watch two men with torches appeared in front of the steps. Apprehending that they were there with evil intent, he went to give them a thrashing and was on the point of laying his stick about them, when they changed into butterflies, which flew about in confusion and dashed against Hwui-fu’s flank ; he tumbled to the ground, and was dead in a short time (288). p.649 Cicadas in human disguise are no less prone than sundry mammals and reptiles to seduce women. « In the reign of Sun Hao of the Wu dynasty (third cent.), Chu Tan of Hwai-nan, prefect of the capital, whose cognomen was Yung-ch‘ang, was Governor of Kien-ngan. One of the delegates in his service had a wife, labouring under demonish disease, but her husband suspected her of illicit sexual intercourse. Afterwards he started on a journey, but spied upon her through a cleft in the wall, and presently saw her seated within her loom to weave, looking at something in a distant mulberry tree, and then approaching this,"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 176 speaking and jesting. And the delegate discovered a lad in the tree, fourteen or fifteen years old, wearing a blue quilt with sleeves, and a headband of the same colour. Supposing that this was the true gallant, the delegate drew his bow and shot at him ; but the knave turned into a chirping cicada as large as a refuse-basket, and fluttered away. The wife, affrighted by the hissing of the shot, exclaimed : — Beware ! they are shooting at you, rather to her goodman astonishment. Erelong the delegate saw two lads in the street, holding the following discourse : — Why did not I see you again ? — Well, replied the other, who was the lad in the tree, I was so unfortunate as to be ill with a wound for a long time, having been shot at. — And how do you feel now ? — I cured myself with an ointment standing on the rafter of Governor Chu. Now the delegate said to Chu Tan : — Do you know that your unguent has been stolen ? — I have had it upon the rafter for a long time, was the reply, how could it be stolen thence ? — You are wrong, mylord ; examine it. Tan did not believe a word of it, but he examined the unguent, and found it wrapped up as before and with its old label. — Thou villain, then liest wilfully and knowingly, he exclaimed, the ointment is, of course, quite in the same condition as it was ; but the delegate retorted : — Open it, and in fact, one half of the contents was gone, and the remainder bore clear marks of having been scraped off with a finger. Great"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 177 now was Tan’s fright. He interrogated the man minutely, who told him everything from beginning to end (289). p.650 Spiders too have shown themselves very dangerous to man’s morals. « To the south of the city of Kiang-hia (Hupeh pr.) there is in the convent of the Iron Buddha a spider-well. According to popular tradition, there existed there in the time of the T‘ang dynasty a red and a white spider, which adopted the shape of charming women to bewitch men ; hence the Iron Buddha was cast to subdue them (290). In their rôle of maleficent ghosts, spiders appear in Amoy especially as authors of nightmare. People there hold the bái-kúi or ‘bái-spectre’, a large, harmless domestic octopod, in great abhorrence, on the ground that it places itself on the ceiling right over sleeping persons, oppressing their chests if they happen to lie on their backs, until they change their posture and turn their breasts away from the monster. This is said to be distinguishable from ordinary spiders by a missing leg. Unmistakeable marks of its grasps are the blue and red wales, sometimes visible on parts of the body which have been subjected to pressure during sleep. To conclude with a tale that acquaints us with a centipede as harbinger and cause of evil : « In the fifth year of the Yuen kia period (A. D. 428), on an evening of the autumnal p.651 season, it happened in Yü-chang to one Hu Ch‘ung, that a large centipede, two feet long, fell down before his wife and his sister ; they told a slave maid to pick it up and throw it away, but no sooner was the slave out of doors than they saw an old hag with stinking and ragged clothes and without eye-balls. In the third month of the next year, while his door was closed, they died one after another (291). Insects, as also vipers, toads, and perhaps yet other small reptiles, in one word, various crawling vermin really poisonous or thought to be so, are especially dangerous to men if they or their souls are sent out against them on purpose by malicious people, in order to poison them or otherwise destroy"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol.

Such artificial animal-demonism is sorcery, of a kind which the reader will find treated in the next Part of this Book. @ "},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 179 CHAPTER VI On Plant-Demons @ p.652 As set forth in our chapter on Plant-spirits (p. 272), trees, shrubs and herbs are admitted in China by philosophy and folklore to possess souls, as much as men and animals. That chapter has also shown the correctness of the obvious inference, that there must be among plants a considerable number bent on inflicting evil on man, and thus fully entitled to be ranked in the demon class. And in the third place, that chapter has taught us, that animated plants are distinguished into two categories, viz. those which contain amorphous shen substance, and those which are possessed of spirits in human or animal shape. The former, we have also seen, exercise a salutary power upon man, curing him of mental and bodily infirmity and disease, prolonging his life, and even making him live for ever. We may then expect to find plant-devils exclusively in the other category ; and this is confirmed implicitly by the evidence set before us in Chinese books. On page 286 we gave a tale which shows, that, like foxes, wolves and other beasts, anthropomorphous plant-devils waylay married or unmarried women, seducing them for the satisfaction of their vile lusts. From numerous tales we may learn how they bewilder such victims and make them mad or ill, how they allure them to their haunts by shrewd tricks, and abduct them or their souls. Thus, « under the Tsin dynasty, a member of the gentry purchased a fresh-looking slave woman who answered to the name of Hwai-shun, and was told by her that the daughter of her paternal aunt had been possessed by a red hien plant. Having seen a lad with a nice, fresh complexion, in a red dress, who told her that his dwelling stood to the north side of the privy, the girl had been carolling continuously with marks of great satisfaction ; every"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 180 evening she suddenly stopped working, and went behind the p.653 house, and her family who watched her, saw nothing but the hien with the girl’s bracelets and fingerrings hanging on it. They cut down the plant, on which the girl, having wailed and wept the whole night through, breathed her last (292). « In the first year of the Ching kwan period (627) the darling daughter of Li Tsih died. She was buried in Poh-mang, and he ordered a house-slave to dwell beside her grave. One day the girl came to this man with the following words : — In reality I am not dead, but I have been kidnapped by the shen of a big tree ; he happens to be away now for an audience with the god of the Western mountain, which gave me a chance to escape, and knowing you are here, I come to you, for the disgrace I have suffered since I left my parents prevents me from going home ; I hope you will conceal me somewhere ; I shall reward you for it by making you a wealthy man. The slave stood aghast for a long while, but he promised to do it, and constructed a separate dwelling for her. Sometimes the woman left it in the morning, to return at the end of the day, but it happened also that she went away in the evening, to come back at daybreak. She walked with the lightness of the wind. When a month had passed, she brought with her ten pounds of gold and gave it to the slave, who accepted it and sold a few ounces. But then some one among the people, whose gold had disappeared, seized him and lodged a complaint against him before the Loh-yang authorities, who enquired whence he had got the gold. On being informed by the slave of all the details of the event, they tried to catch the woman, but she had disappeared. The rest of the gold transformed itself entirely into yellow stone (293). p.654 We read in a work of the highest class : « When Chang Ping had been promoted to the third literary degree in the eighth year of the Ch‘ing hwa period (1472), he was invested with the prefectural dignity of the Yen-shan district (in"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 181 Kiangsi). There a girl had been given in marriage, but on the arrival (of the bridal procession) at the housedoor of the son-in-law she had vanished. Wherefore both families had lodged complaints before the magistrate, who, however, had found it impossible to give a verdict. Then Chang Ping made an excursion through the demesnes of the city, and seeing a big tree which prevented the ground on the spot from being cultivated, would fell it ; but the people said that there were shen nestled in its top. Ping did not heed their words, and at the head of the crowd went thither to fell it, whereupon these men, dressed and capped after the fashion of ceremonial attire, on the left side of the road made reverences to him ; but he scolded them, and they disappeared of a sudden. His men then set to the work of felling, and a stream of blood gushed out of the tree. At this sight Ping flew into a passion ; he swung the axe with his own hands, and brought down the tree, and out of the nest two women tumbled, who declared that a gale had blown them somewhere to an upper story. One of them was that woman who had been given in marriage (294). p.655 But let us lay aside the instances of crafty abduction and seduction perpetrated by tree-devils, and turn to those which speak of mischief of a more serious description. Koh Hung stated, that in the time of an immortal, named Liu P‘ing, who was quite youthful in spite of the three centuries which had passed over his head, « there existed an old temple with a tree, over which there continually hung a glare of light, while many cases of violent death occurred among people stopping under its foliage. No bird ventured to build its nest in it. P‘ing arraigned and punished it, with the result that, though it was the height of summer, it withered and died ; while a big snake of seven or eight chang was found hanging in it, and died. After that, the tree did no more harm (295). A similar story was related of Sheu Kwang-heu, the wonderworker of whom we spoke on page 629."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 182 « There was a tree possessed by a spirit, at which whosoever stopped immediately died, and birds flying overhead always fell down. Heu arraigned it, on which the tree withered, though it was mid-summer, and fell down ; and a big serpent of seven chang by eight was seen hanging in it, dying (296). Accordingly, by felling trees in which demons house, the latter may be disabled and killed. Conversely, attacking trees may be very dangerous work, as it may anger the indwelling spirit and unchain its wrath. Yü Pao relates, « that in Yang-cheu the sister of one Ku Khiu of Pieh-kia had been ill from her tenth year, and that he asked Kwoh Poh, when she had already passed her fiftieth, to give an oracle about her condition. This sage obtained the kwa called shing, meaning a serious offence, and the appended verse of explanation ran thus : ‘The meaning of the kwa ‘serious offence’ is not favourable ; a withered willow growing on a tomb is not clothed with bloom ; a busy wandering soul beholds p.656 a dragon’s chariot ; a person being involved seriously, a child is afflicted with a devil ; this is caused by the felling of a tree, and the killing of a snake possessed of spiritual power ; but these are not offences of his own, but of his ancestors’. Khiu then searched the history of his family ; and discovered that certain of the last generation had felled a big tree, and killed a large snake which they found in it ; from that moment the woman had sickened, and when she was ill, thousands of birds had soared round about over the roof, which had astonished all, as nobody could give a reason for it ; and a farmer of that district, passing by the house and looking up at them, had seen a dragon drawing a chariot, and a dazzling five-coloured glare of light, which most extraordinary sight had disappeared after a while (297). And Sui Yuen relates :"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 183 « When Yin Wen-twan was Governor General of Shensi, he received a missive from the prefect of the district of Hwa-yin, to-the following effect : ‘Herewith I detail the particulars of my collision with an evil spirit, and report my death. In front of my third hall stood an old Hwai tree (Sophora), making the rooms very dark ; I wished to fell it, but the petty officers in the city all said : ‘there is a spirit in this tree ; it may not be felled’. I did not believe them, and felled it ; moreover I had the roots dug up, and when these had been removed I saw fresh flesh, and under it a painted paper showing a naked girl in a reclining attitude. With great detestation I burned the picture and gave the flesh to the dog to eat, and that same night I felt that my soul was uneasy ; I was not ill, but dejected, and this has become worse every day ; alarming sounds are drumming in my ears ; my eyes see nothing, but my ears hear ; I feel that I shall live no longer in this world. p.657 Therefore I beg Your Excellency to send another functionary hither’. Yin put this missive in his sleeve, and then gave it his private secretary to read, who asked : ‘what reply shall we send to this ? He had not finished these words when another missive arrived, announcing the death of the prefect of Hwa-yin in consequence of his illness (298). Plant-spirits being sometimes, as we saw on page 282, dog-shaped, they may harry mankind in such a form. « Towards the end of the Liang dynasty, an empty house in Pu-sih-kia, in Ts‘ai-cheu was declared by those who had successively dwelled in it to be unlucky and not habitable. A man named Wei Fuh-t’o entered that house with a light, and stopping in the front hall saw in the twilight a being with a human face and a dog’s body without a tail, running and jumping in the apartments. Our hero put an arrow into that beast, and this one shot sufficed to make it vanish. Next day they opened the house, and saw the arrow buried up to its feathers in a rotten tree-stump over a ch‘ih in length, with"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 184 some coagulated blood under it. Thenceforth apparitions occurred there no more (299). p.658 Tree-demons may appear as monsters in black giant forms. « In the T‘ai hwo period (827-836) there lived one Kiang Hia, secondary officer, in whose official mansion mysterious and range things occurred. Every night they saw a giant, totally black and very shining ; all who beheld him were forthwith seized with fright, fell ill, and died. Afterwards there was there one Hü Yuen-ch‘ang, an able devil-seer, who, when the officer ordered him to arraign the spectre with his written magical charms, sat down one evening under the western balcony of the hall. On a sudden the giant came ; Yuen-ch‘ang drew forth a charm and let fly at the monster ; it struck its arm with a sound as if it were cut through, and the arm fell to the ground. Off ran the giant, and Yuen-ch‘ang perceived that the arm which had dropped off was a dry branch of a tree. Next morning a slave of the house said to him : — Your charm is sticking to the dead tree by the north-east corner of the hall ; they immediately went to see and perceived a branch severed from the tree : in fact the arm cut off from the giant. Forthwith they felled the tree and burned it, and from that moment there were no more apparitions in that house (300). Thus we learn, when a tree-spirit in human shape is wounded, the wound shows itself in the corresponding part of the tree. So, also, as we have seen on page 549, when men transformed into animals are wounded, the wound is visible, on the same limb of their human body, and their dangerous character is thus disguised. Here is another illustration of that trait of tree-spirit lore : « To the north-west of Lin-lai a Buddhist convent stood, where a monk, named Chi-t‘ung, regularly sank into dhyâna-abstraction p.659 with the Saddharma-pundarîka Sutra in his hands, every evening sitting down thus in some quiet spot in the cool forest, whither hardly any one came. When several years had elapsed, it happened one night that a man strolled around the convent, calling"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 185 out the monk’s name, till daylight broke. He did so again till the third night, when his voice penetrated the door, so that Chi T‘ung could not help asking : — Wherefore do you call me ? come in and tell me. It was a being of more than six ch‘ih, wearing a black robe, with a blue face, wide-opened eyes, and big lips. On seeing the monk it also joined its hands together, and Chi-t‘ung having regarded it sharply for a while, laid : — Are you cold ? come here by the fire. The being sat down, while Chi-t‘ung went on reciting his holy book. Towards the fifth watch, the creature, sleepy under the influence of the fire, snored loudly by the stove with closed eyes and gaping mouth. Seeing it in this condition, Chi-t‘ung took his incense-spoon and put some hot ashes into its mouth. With a loud shriek it jumped up, ran off to the sill of the gate, and there was a sound in the hill behind the convent as if it stumbled. Chi-t‘ung searched that spot next morning, and found a piece of bark. Then, in search of the creature, he ascended the hill, and saw, some miles off, a large green Sterculia, the branches of which were quite fresh, but a dent in the root looked as if freshly chipped. He placed the piece of bark upon that spot, and found that it fitted the dent perfectly, leaving no trace of a chip. Halfway up the trunk a woodcutter had cut out a step in the tree, over six ts‘un in depth ; this was the mouth of the spectre, for it was full of ashes and fire still glimmering and sparkling. Chi-t‘ung set fire to the tree therewith, and from that moment the spectre ceased to appear (301). p.660 The dangerous character of tree-devils manifests itself in nothing so much as in their being very frequently the causes of disease and death. Their position as demons of illness has been illustrated already by a tale on page 655 ; here are two to the same effect, from a book of the ninth century of our era :"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 186 « Some ten miles south of the district city of Kiao-ch‘ing there were always nocturnal apparitions, producing much consternation and illness among the people, and even cases of death. The villagers had been afflicted thereby a long time, when one of them, walking in the dark with a bow and arrows, saw south of the city a monster like a giant in human form, dressed in red, with a black kerchief over its head. It approached him at a slow pace in a stooping attitude, like a very drunken man ; whereupon the villager in his consternation drew his bow to its full strength and let fly an arrow, which hit the spectre. It made away, and the other, as soon as his fright had subsided a little, took to his heels in a northerly direction, and reached an inn, where he related his adventure. Next morning he saw by the city, to the west of the moat, a red Cassia with an arrow sticking in it, which he recognized for his own. He pulled it out to take it home, and found much blood adhering to the point. The district magistrate, being informed of the matter, ordered the tree to be burnt ; and from that moment no further evil occurred southward of the city (302). p.661 « On the eastern Loh river (near Loh-yang) stood an old house, the hall and main room of which, decorated with windows of perforated masonry and steps, were particularly spacious. The people dwelling these had met with violent deaths so often, that it stood empty, firmly bolted. For a long time it had been in this condition, when the Minister in constant attendance on the Throne, Lu Khien from Fan-yang, became a Censor in the Ching yuen period (A. D. 785-804), and was appointed to the censorship in the east (i. e. in Loh-yang). Desiring to purchase that house, he lodged in it. Some one said to him : — This house is haunted and not habitable ; but he retorted : — I can by my nature put an end to that. Then one night he laid himself to sleep in the hall, accompanied by an underling, and told his servants to abide quite outside the gate."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 187 A brave man that underling was, an excellent archer ; he sat down with his bow and arrows under the window in front. In the dead of night somebody was heard knocking at the gate. The underling at once asked what was the matter, and the answer came : — Here is a messenger with a letter from the commander Yang (or Willow, a family-name) to the censor Lu. Then, as Khien answered no further, the letter was thrown through the perforated brickwork. Khien ordered the underling to read it ; it ran as follows : ‘I have dwelt here for a year ; this hall and main room with the perforated brickwork and steps are my dwelling ; the spirits of this gate and these doors are my subordinates ; is it then just and right of you, sir, to intrude into my house ? If you had a house and I entered it, would you approve of that ? p.662 You do not fear me, but should not you rather cherish some sense of shame ? Be quick, get away from here, sir, lest you call down upon you the disgrace of being destroyed’. No sooner was this letter read than it dispersed in all directions as if carried away by the air, just like flying ashes. And on a sudden another voice rang out : — The commander Willow desires to call on the censor Lu ; and there he was, a tall spectre several tens of fathoms high, standing erect in the courtyard, with a gourd in his hand. But the underling had already bent his bow with all his strength ; the arrow whirred, but hit the gourd. And the spectres made off, leaving his gourd behind. After a while it came back, and with its hands on the brick-work stooped down to peep through it, showing a face of very singular description. The underling shot again, and sent the arrow into its breast. The spectre started and, seized with fright, ran away in an easterly direction. Next morning Khieu ordered his men to track its"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 188 footprints. These led them to an empty plot of ground on the east of the house. Here they found a willow over a hundred feet high, with an arrow sticking in it. This was the so-called commander Willow. Khien had the tree chopped for fuel, and from that moment no more evil befell the inmates of that house. After another year the hall and rooms were being repaired, when they found under its roof-tiles a gourd, over a chang in size, with an arrow sticking in its handle. This was the gourd which the commander had carried in his hand (303). p.663 Writers on tree-devils follow the lines of the preceding narratives as a rule. It would in consequence become tedious to quote more of their tales. Let us conclude with the statement, that to this day the belief in tree-spirits dangerous to man is obviously strong. In southern Fuhkien it deters people from felling any large trees or shopping off heavy branches, for fear the indwelling spirit may become irritated and visit the aggressor or his neighbours with disease and calamity. Especially respected are the evergreen banyan or ch‘îng, the biggest trees to be found in that part of China. In Amoy some people even show a strong aversion from planting trees, the planters, as soon as the stems have become as thick as their necks, being sure to be throttled by the indwelling spirits. No explanation of this curious superstition was ever given us. it may account to some extent for the almost total neglect of forestry in that part of China, so that hardly any except spontaneous trees grow there. @"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 189 CHAPTER VII Lifeless Things as Spectres @ p.664 The animation of what we call lifeless things or dead matter passes in China for undisputable reality. We also know from Chapter XIII of the first Part of this Book, that the soul of a thing is able to appear and work outside the same as a man or animal, or that it may make that thing a living and working being, especially if the thing is an image. Such conceptions or doctrines lead directly to the belief that lifeless things may exercise baneful demoniacal influences, or, in plain terms, may haunt, and harrass mankind. We find such ‘object-spectres’, like animal-spectres, mentioned in books as tsing or vital spirits (see p. 10), and their visitations as tsing kwai, ‘apparitions of tsing’ (comp. p. 429). In this class of demons a large category consists of the ground-spectres already treated of in Chapter IV, which, nestling in heavy things seldom moved, may be irritated by shifting these, and vent their wrath by attacking pregnant women and babies. The general belief in the existence of these spectres does not, however, imply that every indwelling ghost of an object is a ground-demon. Spirits of lifeless things manifest their pernicious existence very often by announcing untoward events, which therefore, according to illogical simple minds, they actually prepare and cause. Very often we read in books of cases of death, conflagrations, or calamities of any kind having occurred as a consequence of things tumbling over without any apparent cause, or after the apparition of strange objects in indistinct hazy forms, as clots of blood, extraordinary colours or coloured things in the air, clouds or vapours within dwellings and abroad. In many cases all doubts concerning the animation of such things were removed by their emission of a glare, or, much more often, by their showing themselves for some moments in a shape which, as we know from Chapter XIII of Part I, souls of objects mostly possess, viz. that of a man or a beast. Koh Hung p.665 (see p. 601) mentioned ill-boding, evil-brewing spectres of gold and jade in the forms of women, infesting mountains"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 190 and forests. We read of miniature men or animals of stone or iron, appearing and vanishing as living spectres ; and according to an old work, « it has occurred in Kiang-hwai that a woman, who, being lewd, cherished thoughts which she could not dismiss, and which always infatuated her day and night, saw, on rising in the morning, two young lads behind her house, very fresh and clean, resembling court pages ; she was just going to clasp them in her arms, when on a sudden they became brooms, which she thereupon burned (304). Thus hysterical hallucinations are seriously taken for women-seducing ghosts. Still worse may lifeless things behave. « Tsiang Wei-yoh feared neither devils, nor spirits. Once sleeping alone under a window, he heard human voices outside. — Are you wronged spectres ? he exclaimed with a curse, if so, walk in and see me ; but if you are spectres without any business here, then it is unseemly to frighten me. On these words the spectres burst in the door, and were about to step on his bed, when they saw Wei-yoh’s intrepid attitude, and retired to the wall of the apartment. They were seven strong. He asked them wherefore they stood there, and receiving no answer, attacked them with his pillow. Then they ran away alltogether through the door, and he ran after them, only to see them disappear in the court-yard. Next day he turned up the ground, and found seven broken wheel-spokes (305). « And in the Khai ch‘ing period (836-841) it occurred that the family of Shih Tsung-wu, the Assistant Commander of Kwei-lin, a good bowman from his youth, were visited by a p.666 contagious malignant disease, which left scarce any of the elder and younger people among them hale and sound. Daily, in the dead of night, they saw a man come from outside, enveloped by a glare of light, whose arrival was a signal for the sufferers to cry and to moan more bitterly. As no physician could effect a cure, Tsung-wu one"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 191 evening took his bow, and watched the door, in wait for the spectre. Suddenly it arrived ; Tsung-wu took aim, and the first shot took effect, scattering the demon’s flaming light into sparks. He then called for a torch to inspect, and they found a candlestick of camphor wood, in use among the family for a long time, knocked over. They chopped it into fragments, which they burned, strewing the ashes into the river ; whereupon the patients entirely regained their health (306). The mountain-devils treated in Chapter II, so notorious in China for the dangerous tricks they play on men, have been known for centuries to change themselves into objects for evil purposes. « In the first year of the Yuen kia period of the Sung dynasty (A. D. 424), a Fuh-yang man of the Wang clan had made a crab-weir in a dry canal, and going to look at it in the morning, found a block of wood in it, some two ch‘ih in size, and a gap through which the crabs had all escaped. He repaired the weir and cast the log upon the bank ; but next morning it was again in the weir, and the latter was broken as before. A second time he mended it, and threw out the block ; and next morning there was the same tale to tell. No wonder that he took the thing for a spectre. He put it into his crab-basket, fastened the cover on the latter, and thus carried it home, saying he would chop it there in pieces and burn them. When still two or three miles from his dwelling, he heard in the basket a confused movement. He turned his head to look, and — the wood had become a p.667 being with a human face and a body like a monkey, with one hand and one foot. — I am instinctively fond of crabs, it said to Wang, so I entered the water to-day, broke into your weir, and ate the crabs ; I have committed an offence against you, but please pardon me, sir ; open the basket and let me out ; I am a hill-spirit ; I will help you and cause you to catch in your weir the biggest crabs."},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 192 — You molest and worry us here, Wang replied ; this is not the only crime you have committed in course of time ; this shall cost you your life, for certain. In divers terms the being begged to be let free, but Wang simply looked into its face without answering. Then it said : — Which is your family-name and your name, sir ? I want to know them, and it asked this question over and over again ; but Wang gave no answer. On nearing the house, the being muttered : — He does not let me free, nor does he give me his names, what then can I contrive to do ? if he only answers, he is a dead man. On reaching home, Wang kindled a fire and burned the thing, whereupon it was permanently laid, and never again uttered a sound. According to the country-people, it was a hill-sao ; they say, that if such a being knows a man’s names, it can strike and wound him, and hence it was that it asked so urgently for Wang’s, intending to harm the man, and thus liberate itself (307). p.668 Tales of a nature similar to the few quoted above occur in Chinese books in considerable numbers, also in those of modern date. Sui Yuen e. g. relates : « When passenger-ships in the Poh-yang lake were surprised by a gale, there always appeared a black cable resembling a dragon, to beat them, and they invariably incurred damage. It was called the Cable-general. For a series of years sacrifices had been offered to it, when in the tenth of the Yung ching period (1732), during a long drought, in a spot where the lake stood dry, a rotten rope was found lying across the sand. A farmer chopped it to pieces and burned them, so that all the liquid it contained disappeared and the blood gushed out ; and from that time the Cable-general no more caused any spectral evil, and the crews accordingly no more presented any offerings to him (308)."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 193 We read of whole gangs of anthropomorphous spectres of large or small dimensions, spreading consternation and fear, and being later on found to be leaves blown about by the wind. We read of people overhearing conversations in the dead of night, which at daybreak were discovered to have been held by utensils or other things, and were no more heard after the things had been burned or utterly destroyed. For reasons which we need not explain, ming khi (page 6) or vessels and other articles placed with the dead in their graves, are often described as doing harm in the shape of spectres, and returning to their real shape when beaten or hacked, stabbed or shot. Lids of coffins have shot through the air, wounding people or crushing them to death, and they could not be laid but by burning the coffins and their contents. A great number of such flying object-spectres emitted a nauseous smell of decaying human or animal matter, and when touched were found to be loft and slippery. Objects which were in the p.669 possession of ancestors, may recall the remembrance of these to superstitions minds, that is to say, haunt them. « Liu Hüen, who lived in the city of Yueh, was surprised to see after sunset a being come, with black breeches and coat. He took a torch, and saw that its face and head lacked the seven apertures, so that it ran blindly against everything. He asked a soothsayer to consult the divining stalks about this event, who said : — This is a thing coeval with your forefathers ; if it exists any longer, it will become a spectre and murder men, but having no eyes yet, you may still ward it off in time. Liu caught it and tied it with a rope, and dealt it several blows with a sword, whereupon it changed into a pillow, which was discovered to date from his grandfather’s time (309). Rotten wood and old brooms may haunt houses in China as incendiary spectres. « In the year ting-mao, Liu Wei, Governor of Lü-cheu, was removed to Kiangsi to administer the government there. After his departure great conflagrations broke out in that province, and certain beings from time to time wandered about at night with torches. As it was found impossible to arrest them, some were"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 194 killed with arrowshots, and thereupon seen to be coffin-boards, rotten wood, old brooms, and such like things. This discovery still more disheartened the people of that province, and it was not until several months afterwards, when Chang Tsung became Governor of Lü-cheu, that the conflagrations ceased (310). We need not remind our readers, that objects are assimilated in China with real men and beasts especially vividly when they represent these by their shape. As a consequence, images are firmly believed to be capable of haunting ; Chinese books contain many tales which show that this conclusion is correct. « There was p.670 in the house of Lu Tsan-shen a porcelain figure of a bride. When it had been there for some years, his wife jokingly told it to become her husband’s concubine, and from that moment Lu was agitated, and always saw a woman lying within his bed-curtains. When this had frequently taken place, it occurred to him that the porcelain statue might be haunting him ; hence he sent it to a monastery, to be worshipped there with sacrifices. Next morning, the servant in employ there swept the temple-hall and saw a woman, and asking her where she came from, she said she was the concubine of Lu Tsan-shen, sent hither because the principal wife was jealous of her. And then seeing there one of Lu’s family, that servant told him about the concubine, which induced Lu Tsan-shen to interrogate him on every point ; thus he learned that the man had seen her in the same dress and with the same countenance as those of the image. He then ordered this to be smashed to pieces, and — at its heart there was a spot containing blood, as large as a fowl’s egg (311). « At the north gate of Kia-hwo (Hunan pr.) there was a Children’s bridge, so called because at the four corners the balustrades ended in images of children, cut in the stone. The date of its erection is unknown, but when that year was long passed, it gave forth spectral apparitions. This sometimes occurred in the night ; they knocked at the doors and asked for food, or in the moonshine"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 195 strolled and gambolled in the bazaar, where people often saw them. Once some brave and hardy fellows secretly watched them at nightfall, and actually saw the second and the third stone child slowly descend from the bridge. With loud cries of spectres ! spectres ! they hurried after them with their swords, till they reached the statues and hacked away their heads ; and from that time the visitations ceased (312). p.671 « A military judge of Yueh-cheu, Liu Ch’ung by name, was suddenly smitten with ulcers in his head, which caused him to moan and sigh in a manner intolerably piteous. He called a doctor of arts. This man contemplated him in the night, and said : — There is a woman, dressed in a green petticoat ; she does not answer my questions ; she is under your window ; have her removed without delay. Ch‘ung searched the place under his window, but saw nothing except a porcelain singing-girl accurately modelled, the ornaments of which were of green porcelain. They pounded it in an iron mortar and burned the powder, on which the ulcers healed (313). « During the reign of the T‘ang dynasty it chanced in the capital of the empire, — that one Wei Hiun spent a holiday at home in his study reading the Wradja Sutra, when he saw outside the gate a woman, three chang in size, wearing a purple petticoat. She scaled the wall and straightway entered the house. She seized that gentleman by his hair, pulled him to the ground and pushed him with her hands, but he firmly clasped the Sutra in his arms, and thus, though trembling all over with fright, managed to extricate himself. While thus being dragged, all the inmates of the house were running after him, crying at the spectre, thus causing it to take refuge in a large dung-heap. The gentleman was by this time quite blue all over, and his tongue was hanging out of his mouth more than a foot ; the inmates of the house bore him into his closet, and it was long before he recovered his senses.

They burned it in a place where five roads met, and thus put an end to its visitations (314). Among the images which sometimes haunt mankind, we find also mentioned the large paper Rescuers of the Country, which, as we remember (see pp. 160 sqq. of Book I), are carried in front of funeral processions to drive away spectres. It seems strange that these images, instead of honestly doing what they are made for, should on the contrary themselves act as devils ; but the impression which their hideous appearance makes on simple minds, is strong enough to create the conviction that they may prowl about as living demons. « Hwan Yen-fan, prince of Fu-yang 1, went out with some guests to take part in a drinking bout among the lakes. At sunset his guests dispersed, but he and a few others were so dead drunken that they had to sleep among the lakes. After the second watch there suddenly appeared a being upward of a chang in size and more than ten spans in circumference, with a halberd in his hand. With furious looks and loud cries it made up straight to Fan and his comrades, all of whom kept themselves hidden and did not stir. But Fan possessed courage and strength. He sprang to his feet, yelling and shouting, and with his fists up advanced, thus causing that being to turn tail and run away. Chancing to see a big willow, he broke off a branch and tell on the spectre, dealing it blows which sounded as if they fell on a hollow object ; but he had to give it a good number of them before it fled on all fours. With increased vigour Fan pursued it, till it sank into an old p.673 grave- pit. When the day dawned our heroes approached, and saw that they had to do with a broken Rescuer (315). And a tale of an incident assigned to the middle of the eighth century, runs as follows :  1 A biography of this famous grandee of the eightht century occurs in ch. 120 of the New Books of the T‘ang Dynasty, and in ch. 91 of the Old Books."},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol.

His home was in T‘ai-yuen (Shansi pr.), where his house stood by the north wall, in the Yang-khüh district. He was a bold man, brave and strong. Some miles north-east from T‘ai-yuen city the land was incessantly haunted by a road-spectre, two chang in height, usually appearing when the atmosphere had been obscured by thick rain. People who saw it sometimes died of fright. Young people had promised more than five thousand coins to him who dared go and shoot it, but no one responded to this call, except Puh-i, who offered to go. Just before dark he set out. The crowd said : — This man will hide himself somewhere when outside the city, and then cheat us with the tale that he shot it ; must we then believe it ? And they secretly followed him. Puh-i reached the haunted place just when the spectre came out. He pursued it, and shot an arrow into its body, and the spectre feeling itself hit, ran away. But Puh-i ran after it, and p.674 hit it twice more, whereupon it threw itself into a ravine. Puh-i returned, and was met by the crowd with merry laughter ; they gave him the money, and Puh-i spent it on a drinking-bout. The next day they set out to seek the being he had shot, and in the ravine they found a Rescuer of king twigs, with the three arrows buried in its flanks.

V 198 CHAPTER VIII Demonism in Pathology @ p.675 A perusal of the foregoing chapters will have convinced the reader that spectres, naturally performing in the Universe the leading part in the distribution of evil, in particular visit mankind with disease. We have so often seen them represented by Chinese authors as doing so, that it seems superfluous to devote any further attention to this point, were it not that they are also acknowledged as authors of illness by the Chinese system of pathology and medical art, so that this opinion of China’s leading men in these branches of knowledge demands our attention. The belief in spectres as authors of disease is of long standing in China : Chwang-tszĕ by a curious tale proves that it prevailed in his age, and was then shared even by men of, the highest rank. « The ruler Hwan (of Ts‘i, 683-642 B. C.) was hunting beside a marsh, with Kwan Chung driving his carriage, and saw a spectre. Grasping Kwan Chung’s arm, he said : — Do you see it, father Chung? — Your servant sees nothing, was the reply. The ruler then returned, giggling and smitten with sickness, so that he did not go out for several days. Among the officers of Ts‘i there was one Hwang-tszĕ Kao-ngao, who said : — Your Grace is injuring yourself — how could a ghost injure you ! The ruler Hwan then said : — Yes, but do there exist spectres ? The officer replied : — Yes ; in the mud there are li, about furnaces hieh, and in the dust-heap inside the door the lei-t‘ing dwell ; in low places in the"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol.

The ruler smiled, laughed, and said : — This was what I saw. On this he duly arranged his robe and cap and made Hwang-tszĕ sit with him. Before the end of the day his illness had insensibly passed away (317). The antiquity of the belief in demons of disease is illustrated also by the fact, noticed on page 499, that traditions, preserved by authors contemporary with the Han dynasty, assigned special health-destroying functions to three deceased sons of a mythic emperor of the twenty-sixth century before our era, describing them as distributors of fever and plagues, which by their frequency and destructiveness must always have deeply impressed the Chinese mind. In the sixth chapter of the writings of Lieh-tszĕ we find a description of visits of three doctors to a sick friend of Yang Chu (see Book I, p. 684), two of whom declared his disease not to be p.677 caused by spectres.  1 A commentator of the surname Szĕ-ma, evidently a great authority in matters relating to ghosts, says that wa-lung have the shape of a child of one foot and four inches, with black clothes, a red turban, a sword, and a spear ; a yih-yang has the head of a leopard or a dog, and the tail of a horse ; a chen or sin is a dog with horns and a striped, five-coloured body, and a fang-hwang is a snake with two heads and five-coloured stripes. Other descriptive information about those spirits we have not so far discovered."},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 200 Still it may be noted that in the Shih ming, which dates from the second century of our era, it stands written, that « yih (which means epidemic, plague or contagious disease) is the same word as yih (which means to employ) ; that is to say, there are kwei that set plagues to work (318). Wang Ch‘ung, though so generally sceptical about superstitions of his time, was quite unable to rise above those notions. « One opinion, he writes, is, that kwei which are visible to man are breaths (khi) which may tender him ill. Breaths not congenial to his nature may strike him, and when they do so they become kwei, assume human forms, and become visible. When an illness is in its worst stage, those breaths are in the plenitude of their intensity ; in that condition they come to the patient in a human shape, and on reaching him he may see them. Should he have incurred his disease in a hill-forest, the kwei he sees is a forest-spirit ; one who is ill in Yueh will see in his disease men of this region sit beside him. From this we see, that the apparitions of Kwan Fu and Teu Ying (see p. 437) were probably breaths of the prevailing season, assuming visible forms . . . . . . . . . And still another opinion is that spectres take their origin from men, and become diseases when they collide with men (319). Attribution of disease to spectres has never ceased to predominate in China’s popular lore and pathology. From the Han dynasty onward the books of every age abound with instances of their inflicting sickness and death in various ways. They are described as announcing their arrival and presence overtly by cold, icy winds, for they belong to the Yin, which is cold ; or by a noisome stench ; or by tapping on doors and windows, throwing stones and other missiles, and producing mysterious sounds, preferably on house-roofs ; or by calling their victims by their names ; or by p.678 holding dialogues clearly overheard ; and such events were always readily taken by the people as the causes of the ensuing ill. The common conception, and the most natural, is that spectres occupy the bodies of those they afflict with sickness ;"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 201 it prevailed already in pre-Christian times, as the following anecdote of B. C. 580, narrated by the Tso chw’en, shows : « The ruler (King) of Tsin dreamt of a tall demon with dishevelled hair reaching to the ground, which beat its breast and stamped the ground, saying : — You have killed my grandsons unjustly, but I have had my request granted by the Emperor (of Heaven). It then broke down the great gate, reached the inner gate, and entered ; the started ruler fled into the back chamber, the door of which it also broke. The ruler then awoke and called for the wu of Sang-t‘ien, who told him everything which he had dreamt. — What does it signify ? asked the ruler. — You will not taste the new wheat, she replied. And the ruler became ill. He asked Ts‘in for a doctor, and the ruler of this kingdom sent the physician Hwan to treat him. Before this man arrived, the ruler dreamt that his illness was caused by two boys, who said : — He is a skilful physician ; I fear he will hurt us ; shall we run away ? Then one of them said : — If we nestle above his diaphragm and below the place which lies above his heart, what can he do to us ? The physician arrived, and said : — Nothing can be done for this disease, for it is settled above his diaphragm and under the place which lies above his heart ; I cannot assail it there ; (my needles or caustics ?) cannot penetrate so far ; my medicines cannot reach that spot ; nothing can be done for it.

The cook prepared it, and the ruler ordered the wu of Sang-t‘ien to come, showed her the wheat, and put her to death. About to eat of it, he had a tension of the bowels ; he went to the privy, fell into it, and so died. An official of lower rank had dreamt that morning that he carried the ruler on his back up to heaven ; at noon he bore him out of the privy, and was thereupon buried with him (320). p.679 That diseases are considered to be demoniacal possession is also clearly showed by the following narrative from a book of the fourth or fifth century of our era : « Li Tszĕ-yü, though still young, was an able medical expert, whose perspicacy and spirit his contemporaries extolled. Hü Yung was Governor of Yü-cheu, and resided at Lih-yang when his younger brother fell ill ; his heart and his belly ached severely for more than ten years, and he was almost dead, when one evening he overheard a spectre from behind the screen accosting the demon within his belly. — Why do not you kill him immediately ? it said ; if you do not, Li Tszĕ-yü when passing along here will strike you with something hitherto unused, and this will cost you your life. On which the spectre in the belly said : — I do not fear him. Next morning Hü Yung sent somebody for Tszĕ-yü ; he came, and no sooner did he pass through the gate than the patient heard within himself a plaintive voice.

We read e. g. the following of Kwan Loh, the peerless soothsayer : « In his time the wife and the daughters of the prefect of Sin-tu lived in a state of fright, and they fell ill successively. He told Kwan Loh to divine their condition, who said : — My lord, on the west side of this hall two dead men lie, one with a spear, and the other with a bow and an arrow ; their heads lie inside the wall, and their feet outside : that with the spear pierces the heads of your family, and this is it why their heads ache so much that they cannot even raise them ; the other aims at their breasts, whereby their hearts feel so anxious and pained that they cannot eat or drink ; in the daytime those beings soar about, but at night they come and make people ill, striking them with fright and anxiety. On this they grubbed up the skeletons and removed them elsewhere, and everybody in the house recovered (322). The exercise of demoniacal influence upon a man, either by possession or in any other way, is expressed in Chinese books by the same word mei which, as our readers know (see pp. 505-507), denotes mountain or forest spectres, and also spirits in general, especially of old beings ; and indeed, many pages of the three preceding chapters have taught us that it is a very common thing p.681 for spirits of animals, plants, and even objects to possess and afflict men. Mei then is, besides a noun, a verb, translatable by ‘to bedevil’, e. g. in , ‘kwei bedevil man’, or in , ‘men are bedevilled by kwei’ ; etc. Other terms with the same meaning, likewise of frequent use, are i and p‘ing , the primitive meaning of which is ‘to lean upon’ ; besides we have fu , ‘to attach one’s self to’ ; t‘oh or lai , ‘to rest on for support’ ; jan , ‘to infect’, etc."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 204 It is especially when acting as avengers of wrongs inflicted on them by men that spectres appear as authors of disease. We have already demonstrated by a special chapter (pp. 436 sqq.) the such vengeance mostly causes the victim to labour under delirium or frenzy, and kills him in the end ; how, in truth, could it occur to the mind of the simple that the random, incoherent talk of a raving patient is other than an expression of what he really sees and feels, or that the spasmodic movements of his limbs are aught but a frantic wrestling with unseen tormentors, or symptoms of pain suffered from invisible, merciless hands ? Such torturers are represented in many a tale as having told the bystanders through the mouth of the victims themselves the reason of their presence in the body ; and in such cases exorcisms and medicines proved as a rule totally ineffectual. The identity of disease with the operation of demons may have been invented in primaeval times, but it has held its place in China as a fundamental principle of pathology to this day. Pathologists, who in every age have enriched China’s literature with numerous and voluminous treatises, are wont to denote therein such demoniacal work by the word sié which our readers know (see p. 466), and which, in the narrower sense of disease-inflicting, we find in the Su wen and the Nan king, the oldest compilations of Chinese medical lore we have. The word sui, likewise familiar to the reader (p. 467), has ever been the special medical term denoting the effects of the sié, and is found with this meaning in the Tso ch‘wen, where we read that in the year 540 B. C. the ruler of Tsin was ill, and the diviners declared the cause to be that ‘the spirits of ‘Shih-ch’en and T‘ai-t‘ai produced sui’ (323). Also the term sié sui, ‘sui of sié’, though pleonastic, is very common in medical and other works. p.682 There have, however, been some authors who denied explicitly that diseases are caused by spectres, pretending with peculiar emphasis that the sié are the culprits. But if their contention proves anything, it is merely this, that the word sié has gained its position as a technical term denoting certain mysterious, uncongenial, unwholesome influences, the true character and operation of which every Chinaman, even the most learned, ignores, but which unschooled people bluntly identify with spectres, just as their ancestors always used to do."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 205 Pathologists and other medical men divide the sié into several sorts. In particular they babble about extraneous and internal sié which work respectively on man from without, or within him ; accordingly they conceive the sié as capable of dwelling in men, and as the sié are practically identified with the spectres that produce them, disease thus virtually amounts to demoniacal possession. Clear distinction is also made between yang sié, and sié which are yin. The former injure man’s health by thwarting and neutralizing the yin influences which ought to work upon and within him, while the latter effect the same end by opposing his yang influences. The yang sié attack man especially in the daytime ; the yin sié during the night. Particular stress is laid upon the existence of wind-sié ; indeed, winds disturb the weather, change the temperature, and therefore are main sources of disease, the more so as the venerable medical bible of Hwangti has decreed, once for all, that « winds are the originators of the hundred diseases that exist (324). Further we have sié of heat, which work especially in the hot season ; sié of cold, authors of catarrhs and rheumatism ; sié of humidity and vapours, and of drought. Fire-sié dry up the blood and humors, or coagulate them, and suppress perspiration ; and those of the element Wood manifest their unwholesome presence especially in spring, which is the season associated with Wood ; and so forth. The theories about the ways in which those different sié operate, are many and various, but they agree on this point that all sié produce within man health-destroying tuh khi, ‘poisonous breaths or influences’, or simply tuh, ‘poisons’. If sié thus kill him, they are shah sié or ‘murdering sié’, and their poisons shah khi or ‘murderous breaths’. Authors generally admit, that should the influences of the blood, which constitute the shen, leave the body, dwindle or faint, the sié are always ready at hand to take their place ; in other words, when the ching khi or ‘correct, normal breaths’ (see page 467) retire, the sié khi, their opposites, thrust themselves into the vacant place ; and as if to prove the reality of this process, the patient labours under abnormal functions and delirium, indulges in insane talk and acts. From this it follows that a man has little to fear from sié as long as the normality of his"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 206 constitution is shing or ‘full, abundant’, and strong enough to keep off the sié ; not until his constitution is disturbed by one or more of the many causes of disease excogitated by Chinese brains, do the sié gain a hold upon it, and proceed to destroy him. Thus there are hardly any processes of disease in which the sié do not do their work ; they seldom work therein from the outset, but play the most active and decisive part. Spectres assailing men whom they observe to be ill, are indicated in medical works by the term shi, or , which means a corpse, but in this case has to be translated by corpse-making agencies, agencies of death, mortality. Wang Ch‘ung, as we have seen on page 416, already mentioned them, saying that people with an unlucky fate sometimes see ‘flying shi’ () or ‘running hiung or evil’ (), or human forms, altogether kwei. Elsewhere in his writings he mentions the flying shi simultaneously with ‘flowing hiung’ () (325), and he speaks of ‘flying hiung’ () and ‘flowing shi’ () gathering in the dwellings of man (326). All there terms evidently denoted in his time one and the same thing, viz. spectres causing mortal disease. We obtain more theory about the shi from a medical work in eight chapters, ascribed to Koh Hung, but professedly enlarged and completed by T‘ao Hung-king, viz., the Cheu heu pi kih fan, ‘Ready and Quick Medicaments for behind the Elbow’ (to be kept handy). There (ch. I, § 6) we find the shi divided into five species, which all attack men suddenly : p.684 1. flying shi, which run through the skin and penetrate into the viscera and mansions ; whenever they work, piercing pains are felt in changeable forms without constancy. 2. hidden shi, which attach themselves to the bones, enter the flesh, and attack and pierce the blood-vessels. When they occur, one should not approach a corpse or make mourning visits. When wailing and lamentation are heard they set to work. 3. wind-shi, which wildly jump about on the four limbs of the patient, so that the point at which they penetrate cannot be"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 207 determined. When they manifest themselves, the patient is dull and troubled. They work when there is wind or show. 4. immerging (penetrating) shi, which coil themselves around the viscera and the mansions, and assail the heart and the flanks, causing at every action tramp in the former, and a cutting pain in the latter. They work when it is cold. 5. corpse-maladies ; the whole body is paralyzed, the vital spirits work abnormally and confusedly, the patient always feels dull and weak. If the character of this disease changes at every fortnightly period, it will suddenly bring the great evil (death). The symptoms of the attacks of these five shi do not differ much, and therefore the same means and cures, or nearly the same, may prove effective against them all. — Those symptoms are : a swollen abdomen with heavy pains, very difficult breathing, attacks upwards against the heart and breast, and sidewards against the flanks. p.685 We cannot doubt that Koh Hung, or medical philosophers preceding him, arrived at the discovery of five shi simply through the fact that, as we may see on page 26, the cipher five plays an important part in the system of the Universe, in the natural ethics, and the internal construction of the human body. It is at any rate a fact that, ever since, medical authors often teach that each shi corresponds with one of the five principal colours, and with one of the five viscera and mansions in which it settles preferably. Thanks to this wise arrangement, good physicians, guided by good books, are able to ascertain at every diagnosis which of the five categories of drugs which heal the viscera they have to order from the apothecary’s shop. Again the same standard work on medicine states : « Demonish maladies are, according to Koh Hung, the corpse-maladies which have their place among the five shi, and they embrace also all injury caused by kwei and sié. There are from thirty-six to ninety-nine forms of them.

During the lapse of years and months he is wasted away and his functions cease, and death is the end of this. And after his death the disease passes over to people about him, with the result that his whole family may be destroyed 1. Beside these complaints, against which, as we may expert, Chinese doctors and their arts stand powerless, there is mentioned one, evidently contagious, called ch‘wen shi , ‘transmissible or inheritable shi’. « This malady, says an old work, consists in p.686 that the blood and breath of a man deteriorate and weaken, and his viscera and mansions are emaciated and empty. When he is hit by the influence of spectres and these set their sié to work, they produce this disease 2. Evidently then consumptive diseases belong to this class of complaints. But, principally, spectres are the authors of sudden diseases, which therefore are appropriately called kwei kih , ‘spectre-blows’ or ‘spectral attacks’. The work of Koh Hung gives the following diagnosis of them : « screwing pain within the breast, rigorous pains in the flanks, cutting pains in the belly, which cannot be kept under ; sometimes the patient vomits blood immediately, or has nose-bleedings, or passes blood. Such diseases are also named kwei pai, ‘spectre pushes’ (327). Pien-ts‘ioh (of the sixth century B. C. see page 71) said that to be struck by evil (chung wuh) is analogous with sudden death (tsuh szĕ) and a spectre-blow (328).  1 Cheu heu pi kih fan, ch. 1, § 7. This passus is copied in the standard work of Sun Szĕ-moh, one of the most celebrated physicians China has possessed, also deeply versed in Taoism. He is believed to have lived from A. D. 581-682. His work is entitled Pi kih ts’ien kin yao fang. ‘Ready and quick urgent Medicines a thousand gold coins worth’ ; it contains 93 chapters. 2 Chung ts‘ang king, a medical treatise ascribed to Hwa T‘o, an ever famous leech of the second and the third century of our era.

V 209 Sun Szĕ-moh put down these same statements to the letter in his own work, and added : « Those who become ill from a blow of a spectre never die a slow death ; it comes down upon a man like a dagger stab (329). Sudden attack (tsuh wu) is the same thing as to be struck by evil, and of the same kind as sudden death and a devil’s stroke (330). Such chung wuh or ‘strokes of evil’, or, unabbreviatedly, tsuh chung wuh khi or tsuh chung kwei khi , ‘sudden strokes of evil or of spectral influences’ may come down upon a man at any moment, but especially during the night, if he has to expose himself to spectres by going out. Therefore he acts wisely if he protects himself against p.687 them by carrying a lantern on such occasions, or, better still, a flaming torch. Nocturnal excursions are hardly ever undertaken except in case of need, for instance to go to the public privy. While there, one may on a sudden feel cramp in the breast and bowels, and sink to the ground, suffocated, cold, and with spasmodic contractions of the arms and fingers ; blood may even flow from the mouth and nose. In this state of suspended animation or apparent death the patient should be succoured immediately, else he will not revive. It would be dangerous to remove him from the spot before his revival ; the people gathering around should forthwith set to drumming and gong-beating, and kindle thyme with incense of any kind, and spit in his face, until he comes round. Sudden torpor, coma, trance, catalepsy, epilepsy, lethargy, convulsion, and whatever more forms spectre-blows may have, are comprised by the Chinese under the general term küeh (), and considered to be a suspended animation consequent upon the spectre having snatched away the soul. We have noted this point already on pp. 243 seq. of Book I, giving there also the names of two classes of such soul-thieves, and the simplest expedients resorted to to bring the soul back into their victims. In Koh Hung’s book of medicine we find these complaints called shi küeh or ‘corpse-küeh’, and the word küeh written , meaning to rob or draw off, which we think can hardly be accidental or a mistake."},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 210 « Shi küeh disease, he states, is tsuh szĕ or sudden death, but the pulse still moves, and the patient hears within his ears a hissing or whistling sound, and his thighs are warm (331). Koh Hung thus placed those diseases in the class of spectre-blows, these being, as we have seen, identical with sudden death ; and all medical men after him have done the same thing. It may, however, be remarked here in passing, that, as is plainly shown by Chapter VII of Part I of this Book, it is generally admitted that absence of the soul from a person by no means necessarily shows itself by vehement symptoms. The following tale is a proof of it : « Under the Southern Ts‘i dynasty, Ma Tao-yiu, Chancellor at Court, was seated in the palace in the first year of the Yung ming period (A. D. 483), when suddenly he saw the place in front of him crowded with spectres, which, however, his attendants did not p.688 perceive. In another moment a couple of demons entered his ears, and pushed his soul (hwun) out of him, so that it fell down upon his shoes. He pointed to it with his finger, asking the attendants whether they saw it, but none of them did. On their asking him what shape his soul had, he answered : — It is just like a frog. Surely, he continued, I have no longer any vital matter in myself, and the spectres are still in my ears. They looked at his ears, and saw that they were quite swollen. On the next day he was dead (332). Chu Chen-hing (see p. 301), who lived under the Yuen dynasty, wrote : « Corpse-küeh, flying shi, and sudden küeh are symptoms of a stroke of evil. If some abnormal (puh ching) influence is offended, the hands and legs suddenly become paralyzed and cold, the epidermis granulous, the face blue and black, and the vital spirits do not maintain themselves in the body. The patient makes mistakes in speaking, or utters random talk, or gets lock-jaw, or is absent-minded and recognizes nobody, or becomes dizzy, whirls round, and tumbles. Such are the symptoms of sudden küeh,"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 211 attacks of extraneous influence (koh wu), flying shi, and spectre-blows. These complaints often result from visits of condolence and to temples or graveyards (333) thus from contact with places where spirits abide. Chang Kiai-pin (334) of the fifteenth century also says : Corpse-küeh is in every respect the symptom of a sudden stroke of evil inflicted by extraneous sié, such as abnormal (puh ching) influences of the four seasons, or mountain-demons, or murderous p.689 influences of the soil, or the five shi, nightmare-spectres, and the like 1. Strokes of evil, representing the worst of demonish maladies, may show themselves under various forms. Leu Ying states, that we should rank among them belly ache, constipation or colic, asthma, distortion of the back and the hips, and so on ; moreover he says : « When a patient suddenly suffers from a dilated heart or a swollen abdomen, without diarrhoea and vomiting, then he is what people call ‘struck by evil’. This arises from the fact that his vital soul is incomplete and his heart and will are constantly terror-stricken, so that he is struck by evil spirits. Some thus possessed are dejected and silent ; others utter incoherent and delirious talk, or slander and revile, or divulge secrets of others, not even abstaining from deriding those whom they are bound to respect ; or they give utterance to predictions of misfortune and felicity, but when the time of fulfilment arrives, not one hair is lost 2. They climb heights and cross abysses as if they are level ground ; some wail and weep, or moan and sigh, and avoid the society of men, behaving as if drunken or crazy. The disease shows itself in ten thousand ways, each of which is to be examined and treated in accordance with the local customs (335). It is in such terms that medical men in China explicitly express their belief that patients who are delirious or have fits of p.690 insanity, are struck with  1 King yoh ts’üen shu, Complete Works from the King Mountains, where the author lived in seclusion ; a voluminous medical work in sixty-four chapters.

V 212 evil, that is to say, possessed or attacked by demons. They include among such devils’ strokes fever or fever delirium ; indeed, there is no illness of which they have formed correct notions. We have already seen on page 499 that, in accordance with an ancient tradition, fever is identified with the ghost of a son of a mythic emperor of the twenty-sixth century before our era ; and here let us add, that no leading medical authorities ever have disputed its demonish origin or nature. Intermittent or typic fever, they declare, is devils or their sié entering and leaving the patient’s body repeatedly, thus causing hot or yang fevers, also called ‘male fevers’, and cold or yin fits or ‘female fevers’. Violent attacks during which the patient raves, especially if they occur at night, are explicitly styled ‘devil-fevers’. By this name many doctors denote also the febrile or malarious epidemics which may prevail in connexion with the seasons, periodical winds or monsoons, damp and sultry weather ; some, however, call devil-fevers those which rise at night, that is the time when spectres roam, and it needs no saying that uneducated people in particular adhere this theory. There exist very subtle classifications of fevers, as e. g. those caused by yang sié nestled within the yin soul or the yang soul of the patient, or by yin sié occupying one of these souls ; but such overlearned gossip falls beyond the sphere of our interest. From folklore still better than from scholarly theories we may learn the reality of demonry in febrile disease. « The prefect of Shang-yuen (in Kiangsu pr.), Ch‘en Ts‘i-tung, once, when still young, dwelled with one Chang in the temple of Kwanti in T‘ai-p‘ing, and Chang got fever there. Ch‘en, who occupied one room with him, felt tired at noon and took a nap on a coach opposite him, and saw outside the door a pale boy with pale clothes, and a hat, shoes and stockings of a deep blue colour. This boy put his head through the door and looked at Chang, and Ch‘en, thinking that he was somebody connected with the temple, did not interrogate him ; on a sudden Chang’s fever rose, and when the boy went away, the fever left him. The next day Ch‘en was sleeping again, and suddenly heard Chang cry deliriously, while he vomited spittle like a bubbling spring. Ch‘en, startled from his sleep, saw the p.691 boy standing before Chang’s bed, making"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 213 dancing gestures with his hands and feet and merrily laughing, and casting looks upon him as if to say that he did it on purpose. Ch‘en now understood that it was the fever-spectre. He hurried towards him to give him a thrashing, and where his fists touched him he was untolerably cold. The boy ran out of the room with a noise like a blast, and Ch‘en ran after him as far as the central courtyard, where he vanished. Chang became better, but Ch‘en’s hands had a blackish colour as if they were smoked, which he could not remove until some days had elapsed (336). At Amoy the fear of fever-spectres is deeply ingrafted in the popular mind, and manifests itself also by a general aversion to pronouncing the name of the disease, which is koân-jiét, ‘cold and-heat’ ; indeed, the best means to bring a devil upon one’s self is to mention him. People prefer denoting fever by the term khit-tsiáh á pīng, ‘beggar’s disease’, hoping thereby to make its spectres think that they perfectly despise it, so that they may just as well leave off worrying them with it. The name of the disease, and therewith the disease itself, are also cleverly shelved, and thus avoided, by not asking fever-patients about their complaint, but merely about the general state of their health ; a line of conduct followed also with regard to diseases generally. So e. g. it is a mark of bad breeding to use in correspondence the words disease or spectres of disease ; for these should always be substituted ‘babies producing vicissitudes (in life)’. As well as febrile delirium, insanity is naturally ascribed by the Chinese to evil spirits. The famous classic of the healing art p.692 classifies its causes under five heads : « The following are the five derangements caused by sié : — when they enter the yang of an individual, he turns mad ; when they enter his yin, he becomes paralyzed. Should they seize firm hold of his yang, he will have epileptic fits, and if they hold fact his yin, he becomes dumb. If yang sié enter his yin, he becomes quiet, and when yin sié leave his yang, he turns furious. These are the so-called five derangements (337)."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 214 The sié in destroying a patient’s reason may lead him through a series of ailments. A medical work by Chang Ki, a high officer who flourished in the second and the third century, states : « When sié disturb by their howling the tranquility of a man’s hwun or p‘oh, his blood and breath decrease ; this decrease imparts itself to his heart, and whereas his heart-breath thus becomes void, the patient becomes timorous. Then, when he shuts his eyes to sleep, he dreams that he roams far away, for his vital spirits are dispersing, his hwun and his p‘oh wander about erratically, the deterioration of his yin makes him epileptic, and the decline of his yang deranges his reason 1. Hai-ping throughout on this string, medical authors declare, that if a madman under demoniacal influence sees and tells of strange, unknown things and spectres and ghosts, having lost even the slightest control of his eyes, his tongue, ears and gestures, this is a proof that the ‘vacuity of his breath and blood’ is at its very highest pitch, and that his shen lacks lucidity. It is not, however, always quite certain that superabundant secretion of mucus, p.693 combined with insane restlessness, is proof that spectres or sié are at work in him ; such things are often to be explained by catarrh, infection, etc. If a woman dreams of spectres having sexual commerce with her, or if she utters insane talk after a confinement or during excessive menstruation, it may be vacuity of her blood, consequent on the effluence of her shen, that causes it. Medical men are also almost unanimous on the point that lunacy and frenzy is a consequence of sié possessing the heart of the patient, which is the central seat of his soul. These ideas of medical sages in regard to derangement of intellect tally with those of the common people. In Amoy these say that madmen all alike are under the influence of siáo kúi, ‘demons of insanity’. Should a man suffer from raving fits in the genial days of early spring, he is in the power of ‘peach-blossom devils’, t‘ô-hoe kúi, so called from the peach-trees just then in their vernal garb ; hence a man may be maddened by striking him with a  1 Kin kwei yao lioh, a voluminous medical work in 24 chapters, held in the highest esteem by practitioners of the healing art to this day.

It is especially for the tenacity with which they keep hold of their victims, that the siáo kúi are dreaded. Against them the most powerful exorcisms ever invented by human genius prove inefficacious, and if such a spectre has maddened a man, nothing remains for the family but to wait with resignation till it is pleased to depart. The fact that insanity is thus positively and generally ascribed to malevolent ghosts, fully explains why hallucinations of delirious patients, presenting to them imaginary beings and beasts, are taken by the healthy for nothing less than real apparitions of spectres. And it is striking to note how frequently medical works, in enumerating symptoms of maladies, mention ‘insane, random talk’ in immediate connexion with the ‘seeing of spectres’ ; indeed, as the Chinese, while hale and hearty, always have spectres before their minds, it is no wonder that this is the case also when they are ill and delirious. Closely akin to the demons of insanity, but not so malicious, not so tenacious, are those causing transient or constant abstraction or vacancy of mind, which the Amoy Chinese know as bê kûn kúi, ‘spectres bewildering or confusing the hwun’ ; they call them also mô sîn á kúi, ‘spectres causing absence of the shen’. Their operation consists in removing the hwun or the p.694 shen, which constitutes the intellect, or a part of it, out of men, thus causing profound listlessness and absence of mind. Placid distraction, temporary mental aberration, madness without violence or frenzy, are ascribed to these spectres, and so are idiotcy and imbecility, in short, harmless alienation of any kind. The people assert, that it often occurs in the dead of night that a person, leaving his house to go to a public privy in the street, is bereft of his soul by some spectre. Drowsy, silly, he wanders about between the malodorous pits, unable to find his way out of the labyrinth of partition-walls. Should then another come with a torch or lantern, the soul in most cases forthwith re-settles in the noctambulist, the spectre that holds it in its grasp being, like all spectres, afraid of light, and having to run for its life at the sight of it. This photophobia of the devil race explains why, as the people assert, such privy accidents never occur in the daytime. But there is more, and worse : — many a man or woman is known to have wandered from home for no obvious reason whatever, to be found after many days in the hills, bewildered and"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 216 starved. Consciousness is restored to such victims by calling out their names so loud and long that the absent soul, hearing and obeying this summons, returns to the body. That Koh Hung wrote of spirits of this kind we have already seen on page 502. Young children, being tender and weak, and their organism devoid of power of resistance, are exposed to demonish influence much more than grown-up people. Every sudden fright, producing wailing and obstinate crying fits, is believed to be the work of sié. « Fits of wailing caused by fright, states a book, are sié influences settled upon the heart, and should be cured with soul-calming pills 1. Convulsions and spasms brilliantly prove the correctness of these theories ; let us summarise what authors have to tell about these complaints. They manifest themselves in consequence of terror affecting the heart and the kidneys, and then p.695 harm the soul. They may have several causes. The principal and worst among these is koh wu or ‘collision with strange or extraneous influence’ (338), a matter discussed already in the medical book ascribed to Koh Hung. This authority for all time stated, « that koh wu belongs to the class of strokes of evil, and causes cramps in the heart and a swollen abdomen, with shocks at the heart and in the breast. Wu means a collision, that is to say, a collision with extraneous influence. This influence may be emitted also by men, and therefore convulsions are medically distinguished as chung kwei-wu and chung jen-wu : ‘collisions with spectres, or with men’ ; nay, many clever authors divide them into several sorts, according to the kind of man or woman who affrighted the child, or even according to the kind of animal that did it, and in connexion therewith  1 Siao ’rh yoh ching chi küeh, the Correct Art of Medication in Infantile Disease, perhaps the oldest surviving special work on diseases of children, all those mentioned in older catalogues being lost.

The koh wu counteract the normal or ching influences which constitute the health of the child ; they are sié transmitted unwittingly by men approaching the child, or by beasts or winds ; a child may at any time catch such infection, even at the moment of its birth, also from women unclean by menstruation. On account of the resemblance which convulsions bear to catalepsy, as well in cause as in aspect and in consequences, they, like this disease, are often styled ‘stokes of spectres or evil’. As in other demoniacal maladies, the ingress of spectres and their sié is rendered possible or facilitated by antecedent irregularities of the health or indispositions of the organs, to particularize which would lead us too far. Spectres attacking babies take a particular delight in seizing their souls. « The influence of the shen of a baby is tender and weak, the soundness of its vital spirits delicate and feeble ; hence when its shen or hwun is seized by a demon, this fact shows itself in its being unexpectedly smitten with unusually severe disease : it directly becomes paralyzed and yellow ; it cries often and loud, and its breath all that time has a foul smell 1. We have noticed p.696 already on page 243 of Book I, that in Amoy people try to cure such sufferers of convulsions by re-calling their souls by the sound of a gong, and bring it back into the patient by means of a garment. A special class of baby-haunting demons is the ki, fruits of superstitious fancy haunting China from early times. The Shwoh wen says : « Ki means the dress of a spectre ; it is also said to signify a baby-devil. The character is composed of spectre and the phonetic ki. It seems not improbable that these baby-demons were allied or identical with the ancient infant-frightening spectres, children of Chwen-süh, dwelling in ruinous buildings, which we mentioned on page 499. The first author who gives us some information concerning the ki and their doings, is Sun Szĕ-moh.  1 Ching chi chun shing, Reliable Clue for Diagnoses and Cures, in 120 chapters, written in the first half of the sixteenth century by Wang Kheng-t‘ang."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 218 « As a rule, he writes, a baby will get the ki disease if, when its mother becomes pregnant anew, a bad spirit incites this fetus in her womb to make that baby ill out of jealousy. Ki spectres therefore are tiny sprites. The complaint shows itself occasionally also when a pregnant woman has not called the ki away to the last. When this spirit produces disease, it preferably causes slight diarrhoea and fever, sometimes appearing as a hairy, hideous, disagreeable being with long eyebrows ; such are the symptoms. Patients should take broth of dragon’s gall. When a woman, who has a child that cannot yet walk, becomes pregnant again, and still suckles that child, the fetus also will become a ki giving it a yellow colour ; the symptoms then are emaciation, protrusion of the bones through the skin, loss of hair, and excessive heat (339). p.697 Later authors ascribe yet other complaints of babies to the ki, prescribing sundry efficacious medicines ; but it is of no use to particularize all this. Unanimously they admonish pregnant mothers to wean their sucklings as soon as they observe in them a decline of health, an advice probably seldom followed in a country where women may be seen very often with boys and girls of four and five at their breasts. It needs no saying, that medical works emphatically dissuade parents from having their babies suckled by nurses in the family way. Generally they taboo milk of pregnant women as poisonous. « Such milk, says Li Shi-chen, I call forbidden milk ; if a baby sucks of it, it vomits and gets diarrhoea, atrophy, and the ki disease, for it is so extremely poisonous (340). Thus, according to Sun Szĕ-moh and others, a ki is the soul of a fetus which harms its older brothers and sisters ; but some authors declare, that the ki disease is so called from the emaciation of the child who is attacked, causing it to look lean and weak like a ki. In Amoy the spectres are quite well known by the people, and it is not improbable that in the expression ki-ki háo, which, as we said on page 493, is in vogue there to denote mysterious chirping sounds in houses and corners, ki-ki means these baby-devils. Foreigners are often mockingly called there á-ki. "},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 219 Since China’s pathology, like her science generally, consists merely in distilling, by pure reasoning, verisimilar conclusions from superficial and inaccurate observation of facts, it is by no means able to sharply distinguish trance, catalepsy, and other forms of insensibility from death. Indeed, in either case the body is motionless, mute, and retains any given position ; mental faculties are gone, as is all voluntarily movement, and from either state revival is possible. No wonder then that we find in the medical works of China sundry hints how to cure the dead, that is to say, how to restore them to life, and that authors make the freest use of the word death () where only transient death is meant. No wonder also that we find death as well as other states of insensibility represented as the work of evil spirits striking their victims with their baleful influence, or snatching their souls out of them. To show how explicit these popular notions are, the following p.698 tale may serve : « In the last year of the Shing p‘ing period of the Tsin dynasty (A. D. 361) an old man in the district of Ku-chang had a daughter, with whom he lived far away in the hills. One Chao Kwang of Yü-hang asked her in marriage, but he was refused. On this the old man sickened and died. The maid went to the district-city to buy a coffin, and fell in on the road with Kwang, to whom she told what had happened. « I am, she added, so busy now ; if you go to my house and guard my father’s body till I return, I will become your house-wife. This proposal was accepted. — In our sty, the girl went on to say, you will find a pig ; kill it, that we may prepare a (sacrificial) meal of it. On reaching the girl’s house, a noise reached Kwang’s ears of a clapping of hands accompanied by laughter and dancing. He lifted up the mat suspended before the doorway, and beheld a crowd of spectres in the main apartment tossing the corpse about. At this sight he seized a stick, and with loud screams burst into the room,"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 220 whereupon all the spectres without exception decamped. Kwang watched the corpse, fetched the pig, and slaughtered it. At nightfall he saw an old demon beside the corpse. It held out its hand, begging for some of the flesh, but Kwang grasped it with so much force that its owner could not get away. Firmly keeping hold of it, he heard the spectres outside the door cry of one voice : — That old slave, that glutton, has put his foot in it, hurrah ! — Old devil ! Kwang exclaimed, for certain, it is you that murdered this old sire ; bring back his vital spirits immediately, and I will let you go, else never ! — It was my children that amused themselves with killing him, the old demon cried, and it told the young spectres to bring back the soul. The old man now revived ; the old spectre was allowed to go, and when the girl came home with the coffin and saw her father, she stood aghast and burst into wailing. Kwang married her (341). p.699 Spectres are also readily believed to kill their victims sometimes by creeping into their food, and thereby making their way into their bellies. « The Yü-chang people, thus relates the Ki shen luh, are fond of mushrooms, but above all they esteem the ‘yellow dame’ mushroom for its fine flavour. A certain man, while repairing his dwelling, cooked such mushrooms for the workmen. One of these, while on the roof of the kitchen to lay the tiles, looked down and saw nobody, but around the caldron with its boiling contents covered with a dish a tiny, naked spectre ran and suddenly jumped into it. The house-owner served up the mushrooms, and the said workman was the only one who abstained from eating them, without telling why ; and that same evening all who had eaten of the mushrooms were dead (342). The belief in disease-causing demons being engrafted firmly in the popular mind for all time, few things were better suited to uphold and confirm it then"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 221 nightmare. Indeed, a sleeper labouring under this sensation seems crushed down under the weight of a demon riding on his chest ; his panting is due to the demon’s suffocating grasp ; the sudden movements which interrupt his sleep are desperate attempts to throw the demon off. Quite appropriately, in fact, nightmare is written , composed of a spectre and a p.700 component meaning pressure. This character does not occur in the Classics, but this is no proof that the idea that nightmare is caused by spectres did not prevail in ancient times. We have said on page 650 that such spectres may be spiders. And, as if to bring out still more clearly that the authors of nightmare are spectres, medical writers very regularly call it ‘demoniacal nightmare’. They assure us, that those spectres are apt to totally suffocate a man : an easy way to account for sudden cases of death in bed by apoplexy or other causes. These cases are, they say, ‘abrupt nightmare’, or ‘demonish nightmare without awaking’ or ‘a violent end in sleep by nightmare’, not actually distinguished from strokes of devils or evil, and also caused by spectres who tear the soul out of the patient. In the work of Koh Hung we read : « In case of nightmare, when the patient does not awake from his sleep, his hwun and p‘oh wander about outside his body, being seized by sié or inscribed in the lists (of the dead) ; these souls wish to return, but as long as they are unable to do so, they shun light, for if light shines they cannot re-enter the body (343). It is then quite natural that Koh Hung advises that such patients should be brought round by calling back their souls. This remedial method should, according to him, be connected with a certain amount of hocus : « Tie the patient’s feet with hemp, ask him why he is in that condition, and promise him that orders shall be given to untie him ; then let a man sit down to watch his head, and another call out his surname and name within the house, and the sitting man answer : ‘yes, I am here’ ; then revival will follow (344). If a sleeping person does not awake, no light may be allowed to shine on him, for this may kill him ; but if painful bites be inflicted on his heels and his big toes at the roots of the nails, and p.701 his face be repeatedly spat upon, he will revive (345). Blow breath (i. e. shen)"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 222 into the ears of the patient with a hollow reed, and introduce into his nose twenty-seven hairs of his own, made up as a thread (346). Other authors write in other terms, but in the same sense. « Five causes by which life is cut short are : hanging, falling dead, nightmare, drowning, and smothering. In such mortal casualties the five viscera are not yet dead, because they are deaths by violence caused by some external disaster ; the hwun and p‘oh still keep watch beside the corpse, and thus, being not far away, they may, if called back in accordance with animistic magic, re-settle in or on the body and make it revive (347). « If a person harrassed by nightmare in his sleep does not awake, his hwun and p‘oh wander about outside his body and are held fast by sié ; you ought then call him in the dark, and beware of letting light shine on him, else his shen or hwun will not enter into him, and he will expire under the light itself. Nightmare spectres come forth from light, and therefore are not shy of light. The patient must not be called to near by or impatiently, for such things too might cause the loss of his shen and hwun (348). Lumbago, gout, and kindred rheumatic affections are ascribed in p.702 Amoy to the grasps of certain devilish pigmies, denoted by bookmen by the character hwoh. These dangerous beings there busy themselves with arousing sudden gusts of wind and draughts of air whirling up the dust in narrow cross-streets and alleys ; hence these phenomena are styled in the local tongue kúi-ă hong, devil-winds. Apart from causing the above ailments, the hwoh often amuse themselves by wrenching people’s faces awry with so much force that the features can never again resume their former correct position. They stiffen limbs, and lame men for the whole of their lives — in short, they are the authors of all complaints comprised in the term ‘strokes of murderous influences (shah) of winds’. The belief in the evil wrought by these spectres is in Amoy so deeply rooted and so general, that it is a very usual"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 223 thing to hear people there vent their anger by this curse : khit kúi-ă hong p‘ah tióh, ‘may a demon-wind strike you’. The origin of these devils of rheumatic affections can be traced to China’s early days, that is, if, relying on the great Khanghi Dictionary, we may admit that their written name is merely another form of yuh, which, as its radical indicates, denotes an insect or an amphibious animal. In the ancient Shi king we find these yuh associated with spectres, as this Classic mentions them in juxtaposition with kwei in this line : « Were you a kwei or a yuh, you could not be got at (349). Liu Hiang, the philosopher of the first century before our era, « opined that the yuh occurred in southern Yueh (Kwangtung), a country with a surplus of women where the two sexes used to bathe in the same streams, the women taking the precedence, wherefrom a spirit of lasciviousness arose. Hence it was that the holy ancients styled those animals , on account of the affinity of this character with , temptation ; indeed, those animals could shoot at men from the river side, being cognate with shooting spectres in general ; the commandments of Heaven severely and justly forbid men to place themselves on a footing of equality with women, and therefore It created these mischievous things which kill with their shots those who are tempted to lasciviousness (350). p.703 Later authors, not so much affected by holy indignation of the sinful bains mixtes of those southerners, give us some information about the yuh which is better than such flashes of fancy. The Shwoh wen says ‘it is a twan-hu’ (351). The written form of this term is translatable into ‘short bow’, but probably is merely a phonetic transcription, for we also find it in the form , the translation of which gives ‘short fox’ and is apparent nonsense. Nevertheless native authors may be right who maintain, that twan-hu is to be taken in the sense of a short bow, the beast being, as we shall see presently, described as shooting maliciously a poisonous breath, water or sand. This circumstance may have created the word ; yet we feel just as much inclined"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 224 to think that the word has created the belief in the shooting-capacities of the animal. « It resembles a tortoise, the Shwoh wen goes on to say, and it possesses three legs ; it squirts its breath at men, thus destroying their lives. Chang Hwa, who lived from A. D. 232-300, wrote : « In the hills of Kiang-nan or the regions south of the Yang-tszĕ there live in the becks certain archer-animals of the scaled class. Their size is one or two ts’un. They have something in their mouths which looks like a bow, and they squirt their breath at the shadows of men ; ulcers then break out in the places hit, which, unless attended to properly, are mortal. Nowadays when a khü-seu urinates upon a human shadow, the spots thus defiled likewise become ulcerous (352). These khü-seu, which we have already met on page 84, are in general described as small lizards, but need not occupy us for the present. A contemporary of Chang Hwa, Luh Ki by name (A. D. 260-303), further said about the yuh : « On the banks of the Yang-tszĕ and the Hwai they occur everywhere. When the shadow of a man on the p.704 bank appears in the water the beast by throwing itself upon it kills the man ; it is on this account named the shadow-archer. When a southerner has to go into the water, he previously flings some sherds and stones into it to render it turbid. Some say, that if the animal takes fine gravel in its mouth and squirts it at men, it fixes in his flesh and produces ulcers like leprosy (353). The first author who represents the yuh to us with their present attribute of causes of paralysis, painful stiffness, and head-complaints is Yü Pao. « Under the reign of Kwang Wu of the Han dynasty (A. D. 25-58) there lived in P‘ing (in Szĕ-chw‘en ?) certain animals in the river, named yuh or twan-hu, which could take sand in their mouths and squirt it at men. Those hit felt the tendons and nerves of their body"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 225 stiffen ; they got head-ache and burning fever, and in the worst cases they died. The people on the river who repressed them with magical arts, found sand and gravel in their flesh. The meaning of the passage in the Shi king : ‘were you a kwei or a yuh’, escapes me. The people now call them river-poison (354). Koh Hung also dilated on this beast in his own peculiar manner, apparently seasoning his remarks with inventions of his prolific brain. « In Wu and in Ch‘u (Chehkiang, Kiangsu and Kiangsi) there exist in the country so-called twan-hu, yuh, archers, or shadow-shooters. In fact they are aquatic animals, shaped like the chirping cicada, and as large as a cup holding three double handfuls ; they possess wings and can fly, and have no eyes, but acute ears. In their jaws they have something jutting out cross-wise, which is a bow with tips, and when the animal hears a man, p.705 it puts a string into this instrument as between the tips of a bow, and using its breath as an arrow, squirts it out of the water at him. If it hits him, boils break out on the spot ; if it bits his shadow, disease also ensues, the ulcers not appearing, however, immediately, but killing him all the same if they are not soon attended to. The symptoms of this disease resemble those of a bad catarrh ; both complaints entail death within ten days (355). The reader will remember (see page 83), that the conception that a man may be harmed by harm being done to his shadow, is an old one, connected with certain ideas about the affinity of his shadow and his soul. After all, it seems tolerably clear that the yuh must be something like a water-bee.., crab, or amphibious creature, which our zoological science will not fail one day to define and strip of its fabulous garb. The disastrous influence of demons is never so much felt and feared as in times of epidemics, when myriads of wen-yih kwei, ‘demons of epidemic or pestilence’, hover over the country, slaying victims by hundreds in every direction. A roaring trade is driven in charms, amulets, and demon-dispelling medicines ; the people flock to the temples and have recourse to religious"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 226 ceremonies and processions, of which we shall have much to say in Part IV of this Book, and still later on. That the belief in such demons is an old one, is proved by the tradition we mentioned on page 499, according to which a son of Chwen-süh became a devil of pestilence. Medical works of all times are unanimous in declaring, that plagues are produced by certain categories of sié doing their work in connexion with the vicissitudes of the seasons, each of these having its peculiar prevailing maladies. Hence their name : ‘sié of the movement of heaven’. p.706 No doubt devils of epidemics have in all times lived in popular imagination in various parts of China under various local names, and occupied themselves with other malignant works besides spreading disease. A work of the sixth century is stated to have related, that « in the-city of Hwang-cheu (in Hupeh ?) hwang-fu spectres existed, who worked evil whenever they appeared. Their clothes and coats were all yellow. If they came to a human dwelling, laughing with gaping mouths, pestilential disease was sure to break out there. Their size was not invariable, but varied with the height to which the mat hanging before the doorway was drawn up. As they had not showed themselves for ten or more years, the gentry and the people lived under constant fears (that they were about to come). A man in Lü-ling, Kwoh Khing-chi by name, had a female slave, born in his own house ; her name was Ts‘ai-wei ; she was young and beautiful. In the Hiao kien period of the Sung dynasty (A. D. 454-457) there appeared a man, calling himself a hill-spirit ; he resembled human being, but was in the garb of nature, and over one chang tall ; his arms and his breast were yellow, but his skin and his face were perfectly fresh and clean ; his speech was correct in every respect. The people took him for a hwang-fu spectre. He came for sexual intercourse with the slave, who submitted to his will, as if he were a man. He then visited her many times, always keeping his bodily shape concealed, but from time to time it became visible, showing constantly varying forms. Now and then he was tall, at other times small ; sometimes he"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 227 looked like smoke or vapour ; on other occasions he was as a stone, infant, or woman, or like a bird or quadruped ; but his footprints were as those of a man and two ch‘ih in length, except on some occasions, when they resembled those of a goose. The palms of his hands were as large as a bowl. He opened the doors and shut the windows, entering in a spirit-like manner, and jested with the slave as a man would do (356). p.707 Those hwang-fu demons are believed to have played their part as spirits of pestilence as early as the period of the Han dynasty, for the commentary upon the official history of the later part of that house, written under the T‘ang dynasty, narrates how Yoh Pa, Governor of Yü-chang in the first half of the second century of our era, renowned for his great capacities as an exorcist, « found that province in constant distress on account of evil brought upon the people by hwang-fu spectres ; but on his arrival these beings all disappeared, and from that time no more cases of pestilence occurred in that province (357). Devils are also engenderers of cattle-plagues. « In the sixth year of the Shao hing period (A. D. 1136), while the Chang family in the village of Yü-kan were asleep, their cowboy in the stable heard somebody knock on the door. He rose instantly, and saw several hundred robust men, all clad in armour adorned with five flowers and with red helmets on, rush into the stable and vanish there. At daybreak all the cows, fifty head strong, lay dead. Those men were plague-demons (358). The doctrine that the Universe is composed of five Elements the influences of which work in all the phenomena of Nature, necessarily leads to the inference that those Elements influence also the p.708 several diseases which harrass man. Accordingly the spectres which cause illness are of five different classes corresponding to the Elements. We read as follows in a standard work of divination :"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 228 « When kwei of Metal arise and flourish, the teeth and the head are affected, and when they co-operate with the White Tiger 1, blood and pus flow. When spectres of the element Wood set to work, complaints caused by Wind (rheumatism, etc.) arise, and head-aches and dimness of the eyes pass away after a time. Water-spectres cause alternatingly cold and heat, generally producing fever in this way ; diarrhoea and catarrh then are difficult to cure. Spectres of Fire cause consumption combined with languor, which produces pains in the eyes. And the demons of Earth cause voidness of the spleen and the stomach, as also yellow ulcers ; when they are at work in the body, they are bound to produce disease in the thorax 2. Of these five classes three play a pre-eminent part in Demon-lore, and have been treated by us in special chapters, viz. those of Wood, including those which dwell in trees, plants, and wooden objects ; those of Water, and those of Earth or the ground. The latter in particular are believed to create much disease, none being liable to so much collision with man, not only the soil he walks on, but even his house and every object he handles being under their direct influence, or inhabited by them. Fire-devils are the will-o’the-wisps, which, as the reader has seen on page 80, were declared by the ancients to be in the main products of bloodshed. In the writings of Lieh-tszĕ too it is proclaimed that « blood of horses becomes whirling ignes fatui, in the same way as that of men becomes field-lights (359). Those lights never figure in China as good spirits. They are stigmatized as extremely bad, intent on bringing sickness on people and making serious p.709 havoc in corn-fields. « When, after the ears of corn have sprouted, spectral lights flit about in the dark and singe it, it is a sixth catastrophe. Those lights  1 Metal and the White Tiger are correlative, as both belong to the West ; see Book I, page 988. 2 Puh-shi ts‘üen shu or Complete Books on Divination, in fourteen chapters, by Chao Tsi-lung of the Ming dynasty ; ch.

As long as children are within their mother’s womb, her body does not decay, for it is the nature of children not to destroy their mother even should they abide in her for a thousand autumns ; but whenever the year is rainy, so that in the graves in the lonely plains — sapped and ruined by foxes as so often they are — the coffins are soaked and in an extremely rotten condition, then their wood, which I have called mother-matter, decays, and the lights having no longer anything to adhere to, detach from it and fly about. Being lights produced by Yin, they endure no yang light, and await the twilight after sunset to burst forth from their crevices ; lacking force to rise into the air, they move about irregularly over distances of a few feet only ; and when ears and blades of the corn come in contact with them, these are cut off immediately, singed or burned. Men who chase away those lights, whenever they see roots of trees emit them, fall upon them as upon spectres, with a hail of blows. I do not know whence the statement comes that there are spectres produced by decayed wood. When spectre-lights see lamp-light, they vanish of themselves (360). Unbiassed minds may recognize in those harvest-destroying luminous devils, born from rotting vegetable and animal matter, a species of fire-fly, voracious, or placing its destructive eggs and larvae in p.710 cornfields. We read as early as in the Li ki (ch. 23, l. 3), that « decaying herbs become fire-flies in the last month of summer (361). Sundry authors explicitly call those insects , which is, as we saw on page 81, the usual old name for will-o’the-wisps ; so, e. g. did Ts‘ui Pao in his Ku kin chu, in a paragraph treating of fishes and insects ; we may then ask whether the fact that that character contains the elements fire, rice, and untoward, is merely accidental. In some tales we find fire-flies, just like will-o’the-wisps, described as products of human blood."},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 230 « Under the emperor Hwai of the Tsin dynasty it occurred in the Yung kia period (A. D. 307-313) that one Ting Tu, a Ts‘iao-kwoh man, crossed the Yang-tszĕ, and reaching the frontier of Yin-ling when it was dark and foggy, saw a being like a man, northward from his path. This creature fell down, and then as it reared itself up blood flowed out of both its eyes, from its head to the ground, where it formed two pools of more than one pint each. Tu and his cousin cried out at that apparition with one voice, with the result that it faded away. And on the spot where it had stood the blood changed entirely into several thousands of fire-flies, flying away in all directions (362). Fire-flies appear in China in the hottest times of the year. In Fuhkien they swarm especially in the seventh month, when the whole population is busily engaged in feeding the souls of the dead, temporarily released for the purpose from hell by Buddhist sacerdotal art. This coincidence tends, of course, to corroborate every year the popular belief that those insects are human ghosts. Fortunately, as the Amoy Chinese say, they generally keep aloof from human habitations, and seldom enter. « The lasses roving about at night, an author writes, are lights of fire-flies. They are the vital spirits (tsing) of corpses lying on the ground. Burning incense turns them away. They bring happiness if they enter a p.711 human dwelling blue coloured, but calamity if they are then red 1. For the rest, tales connecting evil spirits with wandering lights and fires are numerous. To give two instances : « In the Hwui-ki department there appeared regularly a tall demon of many chang, with loins several dozen spans in circumference. A high cap it wore, and black clothes. Sié Tao-hin, coming to a pond across a graveyard, saw in the evening shades at that pond a pair of torches.

And in the midst of those lights he perceived distinctly the huge ghost, with a head as big as a basket for five stones of rice. This being behaved as if dead drunk, and was supported on either side by tiny spectres. In that same year the rebellion of Sun Ngen broke out (towards the end of the fourth century), which nobody in Hwui-ki neglected to join and succour ; and it was opined at that time that Tao-hin’s vision was the forboding of it (363). « Li Cheu was an officer in Hü-heu, whose farm stood in Fu-keu. In the spring of the second year of the Yung t‘ai period (A. D. 499) he went home for the celebration of the Ts‘ing ming festival, and, when about to reach the Poh-liang river came by a spot which formerly was a shrubless grave, twenty paces from the roadside, where the herdboys were wont p.712 to play and gambol ; but this evening he saw there a grotto as large as a dish, with a glare of light in it. This aroused his curiosity ; he alighted, went to the grave, and saw five lasses in beautiful dress, seated in the order of the five cardinal points, stitching and sewing with untiring zeal, stooping over candle-lights. Cheu made some noise, on which the five lights all went out, and the five maids vanished out of sight. Uneasy feelings sent him back to his saddle ; he galopped off, but still ere he was on the road, five torches rushed forth from the grave and gave chase to him. He fled at his courser’s fullest speed, unable, however, to outrun his pursuers. He brandished his whip, but it was singed by the lights, which did not vanish until he had covered some ten miles which separated him from the Poh-liang river, where he came upon dogs. At daybreak he perceived that the tail of his horse was burned off, and that its rump and its legs were singed. Thenceforth the grave was called that of the five lasses.

Such also is the behaviour of self-murderers ; they are always in search of so-called substitutes : t‘i or kao-t‘i, tai or kao-tai. Hence in a house where some one has killed himself, suicides are likely to occur at shorter or longer intervals, and this conviction prevails so strongly that houses infected with this evil are difficult to let, and even stigmatized as totally uninhabitable. It is not by the shen of the self murderer that the substitute is sought, for, soaring on high, to blend with the supreme Yang from which it sprang, it is not its nature to do harm ; but it is sought by his p‘oh or kwei, returning to the earth on the very spot where the suicide was perpetrated. We learn this from Li Shi-chen, who says : « The p‘oh of a man is something lying under a hanged person and resembling carbonized wheat-bran ; if dug away immediately, it may be destroyed, but if this precaution is delayed, it sinks deep into the ground, and unless eradicated, a repetition of the incident is sure to occur. Indeed, man is gifted with a yang breath and a yin breath, which constitute his body, his hwun and his p‘oh ; as long as these breaths dwell in him conjointly, he lives, but when they separate he dies, his hwun then rising to heaven, and his p‘oh descending into the earth. As this p‘oh belongs to the Yin, the tsing of it is absorbed by the earth, wherein it changes into the above-mentioned substance (364). p.715 Self destruction is perpetrated in China mostly by means of the rope ; hence suicidal spectres are denoted in Amoy by the term tiào kúi ‘hanging-spectres’. Every one in that town, from the most learned man down to coolies"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 234 and beggars, firmly believes in their existence, and numerous tales are in circulation to prove that they are fully entitled to do so. Two of these may be retold here : Not so very many years have passed away since a boatman ferried over an unknown man from the main land to the town. A small rafter which this stranger carried with him, aroused his suspicion, for who was ever so odd as to fetch from beyond the broad bay a thing like that, so easy to buy anywhere in the town ? Quietly rowing on, he entered into conversation with him, and thus learnt from him where he was going. He landed him at the jetty, and was paid his fare, but no sooner was the stranger out of sight than the coins transformed themselves in the hand of the ferry-man into just so many sheets of paper currency for the world of ghosts. He at once fathomed the mystery to the very bottom, hurried to the house which his passenger had mentioned, and arrived just in time to save the life of the housewife, who was busily engaged with hanging herself at a rafter of the roof, in her wrath at a thrashing just received from the partner of her joys and sorrows. The following case had a less satisfactory issue for its hero. He happened to pass by a grave in the shades of evening, when he perceived a man doing his best to push a rafter over a wall of a neighbouring house. Thinking that this signified burglary, he stole to a side-door and warned the inmates, who searched the house thoroughly for thieves, but found nothing suspicious, except a woman of the family just trying to hang herself from a roof-beam. The devil’s murderous intent being thus frustrated, the discoverer of it, elated with pride and self-satisfaction, and loaded with the cordial thanks of the family, went home and immediately told his wife of it. But she was an inquisitive character, not contented with bare tale, and wanted an actual exhibition of the hanging-scene. The obedient goodman mounted upon a chair, slung a cord across one of the rafters, p.716 and laid a running noose around his neck, when suddenly an unseen hand capsized the chair and swung him into eternity with a broken neck. Thus the rancorous spectre had its victim, and its vengeance in addition."},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 235 The generality of the belief in such suicide-spectres working to the peril of mankind, may be admitted from the existence of various written tales, of which they and their mischief are the topics. « Ch‘en Kung-ping lived on terms of friendship with his fellow villager Li Fu. One evening, in autumn, he strolled in the moon-light to the house of this man to have a chat. — I am just wishing to take some wine with my wife, said Li to him, but I find that I have none ; sit down for a moment, I will go and buy some, and then enjoy the moonlight with you. Ch‘en sat down with a piece of poetry in his hand, to await his friend’s return. Then outside the gate a woman appeared, in a blue dress and with dishevelled hair. She opened the door and entered, but on seeing Ch‘en she immediately retired. Ch‘en supposed that she was one of Li’s family, who thought it better not to enter because she wished to avoid the stranger ; therefore he shifted a little sideways, to give room to her. She took something out of her sleeve, hid it under the railing of the gate, and hurried into the home ; and Ch‘en, curious to know what she had hidden there, went to the railing, and saw a cord emitting a bad smell and stained with blood. It now occurred to him that she might be the ghost of a hanged person ; he hid the cord in his boot, and sat down again. After a short while, the woman with the dishevelled hair came out of the house and groped in the spot where she had put the cord. Missing this, she flew into a passion and made straight for Ch‘en. — Give me back my thing ! she cried. — What thing ? asked he, but the woman did not give an answer. Drawing herself up to her full height, and opening her mouth as wide as she could, she blew out a cold wind over him, which froze his hair and made his teeth chatter ; the lamplight sputtered and became green, as if about to be extinguished. ‘The spectre has breath, Ch‘en thought, have I"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 236 none ?’ — and he too blew at the woman ; and lo, the spot where his breath hit her grew hollow. First her belly was bored right through, then followed her breast, and in the end her head disappeared ; a moment had sufficed to turn her into a light vapour, which dissolved and vanished, and did not re-appear. p.717 After some moments Li entered with the wine, and loudly cried that his wife had hung herself from their bed. But Ch‘en smiled ; — She cannot be hurt, said he, for I have still the rope of the spectre in my boot ; and while he related what had come to pass, they entered and untied the woman. They poured ginger-water into her mouth, and seeing her come round, asked her why she had desired death. She replied : — Although we are very poor, my husband is always so bent on guests ; the only hairpin I still have he has drawn out to buy wine with, and however deeply this grieved me, I could not cry, because of the visitor on the premises — when suddenly a woman with dishevelled hair stood beside me, saying she was a neighbour living to the left ; my husband, she told me, had not drawn out my hairpin on behalf of the guest, but to go with it to the gambling-house. These words increased my sorrow and indignation ; the thought crossed my brain that if my husband did not come home because it was late at night, the visitor would not go, there being nobody to tell him to do-so, p.718 and — the woman with dishevelled hair with her own hands made a noose. — Through this you may pass into the boundless delights of Buddha’s realm, she said ; I put my head into the noose, but her hands could not draw it tight ; it slackened repeatedly. Then with the words : — I shall fetch my own Buddha-cord, this will make a Buddha of you,"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 237 she hurried out of the door to fetch it, but was absent for a long time, during which I was dozy and dreaming ; and then you came to save me. They made inquiries, and indeed, some months ago a village woman in the neighbourhood had hanged herself (365). We learn from this tale, that the cord with which a suicide has strangled himself is an appendage of his ghost while in search of a substitute, and that this instrument, having once done its fatal work successfully, is particularly suited to perform it a second time, and even many more times in succession. « In Hang-cheu (Chehkiang pr.), a storeyed house inhabited by the Hü family and standing by the Wang-sien bridge, was said to be inhabited by the ghost of a hanged person. A butcher, Chu Shih-’rh by name, confident of his courage, took the knife with which he used to kill pigs, mounted to the upper storey with a candle, and slept there. After the third watch-drum had sounded, the flame of the candle turned blue, and an old hag with dishevelled hair climbed the ladder, with a rope in her hand. Chu struck at her with his knife, and as she tried to catch him with the rope, he hacked this through ; the ends however rejoined and the rope whirled around the knife, but the knife passed through it as easily as if it were a hempcutter’s knife. Thus the struggle went on for some time, the strength of the old woman p.719 gradually failing. ‘Chu Shih-’rh !’she cried with a curse, I am not at all afraid of you, but there is still due to your good fortune a sum of 15 000 copper coins which you have not yet received ; it is on account of this circumstance that I will pardon you now, but no sooner will you have received that money than you will experience the dexterity of the hands of me, Mrs. Kin Lao-ts’in. With these words she departed, dragging the rope after her. Chu descended from the storey and told the crowd what had happened, showing them his knife, stained with red blood and stinking. A year later he sold his house for 15 000 coins, and died the same evening (366)."},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 238 Thus we see that ghosts of suicides by the cord sometimes attack brave people by brute force. The following tale confirms this : « A detective in Kü-yung (Nganhwui pr.), Yin Khien by name, was a famous thief-catcher, who every night used to lie on the look-out in obscure, unfrequented spots. Once he was on the way to a village, when a man with a cord, running with blind haste, dashed against his back. ‘This must be a thief’, said Yin to himself, and he followed him till he came to a house and scaled the wall. Yin thought it better not to catch him yet, but to watch him first, for if he delivered an innocent man to the magistrate, he would probably not receive any reward, while by waiting till the man should leave the house and then robbing him of his loot, he would be sure to get much more. But suddenly the suppressed wailing of a woman reached his Bars. He was now all suspicion, scaled the wall, and saw a married woman dressing her hair before a mirror, while a being in the roofbeam with dishevelled hair tried to catch her with a cord. p.720 Yin now conceived that it was the ghost of a hanged person seeking for a substitute. Shouting loudly, he broke through the window ; the neighbours ran together in consternation, while Yin explained his behaviour, and indeed they saw the woman hanging from the beam. They lifted her up and thus saved her, and her parents-in-law came to tender their thanks, and brought wine to refresh them. After they had dispersed, our hero went home by the same road. The day had not yet broken. Hearing a ticking sound behind him, he looked back, and saw the spectre with the rope. — What did it matter to you that I was catching that woman ? said it with a curse ; why did you infringe our customary laws ? and it gave him blows with both its hands. But Yin, brave and strong, paid it back its blows, and the spots where his fists lighted were cold and rank. Daylight by and by broke, and the force of the spectre with the cord waned in proportion, while Yin’s agility and strength increased ; he grasped the ghost tightly in his arms, and a"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 239 passer-by saw him embracing a piece of rotten wood and furiously uttering vehement curses. Approaching to investigate the matter, that man found Yin apparently dreaming, but he came round, and the rotten wood dropped to the ground. — The spectre clings to this wood, he angrily exclaimed, but I do not pardon the wood ; and he took a nail, and nailed it up against the pillar in his courtyard. There they heard it wail and weep every night as if labouring under untolerable pain and grief. After some nights had thus elapsed, moaning, childlike voices were heard speaking with that being, and soothing it, and imploring mercy on its behalf, but Yin did not attend to them. Among those voices was one of a spectre which said : — Be glad that the house-owner has merely nailed you up ; had he tied you with a rope, your suffering would be much worse. — Hold your tongue !, the other spectres whispered at once. On the next day Yin replaced the nail by a rope. That evening he no more heard the spectre weep, and the next morning he saw that the rotten wood had disappeared (367). p.721 As ghosts of hanged persons are always in search of victims to follow their example, they are, of course, present immediately wherever intent to self-murder arises. In the Standard History of the Kin dynasty we read of a loyal officer, P‘u-ch‘ah Khi, also named Jen-khing, living in the first half of the thirteenth century, who put an end to his life to avoid ignominy : « When he came home, his mother was just having a nap, and awoke with a shudder. — Mother, asked Khi, what is the matter with you ? — I was just dreaming, she replied, of three men hidden in the roof-beams ; this frightened me out of my sleep. Jen-khing knelt down and said :"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 240 — Those men in the beams are ghosts ; I, your child, intend to hang myself from the beams, and you have foreseen this in your dream. The family burst into tears, and dissuaded him with the words : — Do not you think of your old mother ? But p.722 she stopped them, saying : — Do not interfere with my child ; his resolve is correct. And he did hang himself. That spectres not seldom impel men to selfmurder at the state-examinations for literary degrees, we have already seen (pp. 461 sqq.). Suicidal intent may arise by the mere apparition or presence of a suicide-spectre, as the following tale shows : « In the first year of the Yung shun period (A. D. 682) the mother of Yuen Shui, in T‘ung-cheu, was seated by broad daylight in the main apartment of her house, when she saw on the other side of the screen a dwarf riding on a pony into the house. It was two or three feet in size, and the dimensions of the pony were in proportion. It was in ornate dress and armour, which glistered as sunlight. It swiftly rode round the walls of the courtyard for a good while ; then it faded away, and on this the woman continuously sought to put an end to her life, so that the whole family guarded her. After a year or so her passion for suicide abated a little ; but one night, on having retired to rest, she put her clothes under the blankets instead of herself, and escaped through the gate. Her guardians perceived it and sought her, but she threw herself into the well, and while they were drawing her out she expired 1. @  1 K K, ch. 361, which quoted the tale from the Kwang ku-kin wu hing chi or Elaborated Account of Phenomena produced by the five Elements in Times Ancient and Modern, a work on wonders of all sorts, mentioned in the Catalogue of the New Books of the T‘ang Dynasty (ch. 59, l. 28) as written by one Teu Wei-wuh, and consisting of thirty chapters. It still existed under the Sung dynasty, but it seems to be now lost."},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 241 CHAPTER X Spectres with a Material Body. Vampirism. @ p.723 It will not have escaped the attention of the reader in perusing various chapters of this Book, that the Chinese by no means always imagine their ghosts with a volatile, etherial shape, but rather manifest a tendency to think them more or less solid and substantial, if not material. This phenomenon has given birth to terrible devils of great strength, of which we must now treat at some length ; first, however, its reality may further be instanced by a couple of authentic tales. « In the Khai yuen period (713-742) the Governor of the province of Liang (now Kansuh), Kwoh Chi-yun by name, while on a tour of inspection, was smitten by death at a post-house one hundred miles from the provincial chief city. His soul then left the room, ordering the headman of the post-house to shut it and open it no more, and returned to the city, while his menials who travelled with him had no idea that he was dead. Having arranged his public and private business in his mansion in some forty days, he ordered some men to go and fetch his remains from the post-house. On their return he himself directed the dressing and coffining ; subsequently he took leave of his family, and entered into the corpse and the coffin. After this he appeared no more (368). The following strange story teaches us not less strikingly how a soul may be a perfect duplicate, visible and tangible, of its body : « In p.724 the first year of the Ching yuen period (A. D. 785), Li Tsih from Ho-nan, Sub-intendant of the Palace, breathed his last. Before they laid him in his coffin, a man in red appeared at the house to offer his condolences, telling the family that he was one Su, Chancellor of a Board. He entered, and his wailing and lamentation had reached the highest pitch of intensity, when"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 242 suddenly the corpse drew itself up and exchanged blows with him. The members of the family ran out of the hall in consternation. The two men closed the door, and fought until eventide ; and when the mourning sons thereupon ventured into the room, they saw two corpses side by side on the couch. Their dimensions, shapes and features, their beards and their clothes did not show the slightest difference. The clanspeople were called together, but none could distinguish the one from the other ; so they buried them together in one coffin (369). The idea that souls may move about in solid forms hardly different from corporeality, cannot appear unnatural when we consider that ghosts of the dead can scarcely rise before the mind of man otherwise than in the material shape in which he knew them while they were alive. Ghosts dwell, as our readers know, according to the Chinese, in their graves, implicated in the corpse, or even in single portions of it ; as a natural consequence we see them rise before their imagination very often as dry carcasses, or even as bones or skulls. Corpses or bones are deemed to sustain, strengthen and solidify the souls to which they belong ; — accordingly, a ghost which still has its corpse or bones at its disposal, either in or outside the grave, must, when breeding evil, naturally be a demon of special power. It is no feeble ghost, easily frustrated in its bad designs by clever men, and therefore having to recur to sly, covert artifices if it wishes to do harm ; but, having substantiality to rely on, it is apt to attack men straightforwardly, with brute force and clumsy violence. p.725 For instance : « In the first year of the Yung t‘ai period (A. D. 765) one Wang lived in Yang-cheu, to the north of the Hiao-kan monastery. In a summer month he got drunk, and his arm hung down from his bed. His wife, fearing that he might catch rheumatism, would lift it up, when suddenly a large hand appeared before the bed, and pulled Wang down from it by his arm, his body thereupon slowly sinking into the ground. His wife and his female slaves together pulled him back, but they could not stop him, for it was as if the ground burst asunder. The clothes and girdle which he had laid aside"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 243 disappeared also. Then the family with all their might grubbed him up, and at a depth of more than two chang found a dry skeleton, apparently some centuries old. I have never known what spectre this was (370). Such notions about extraordinary power of ghosts which retain possession of their body or parts of it, are further corroborated by the conception, so vividly impressed in all ages upon the Chinese mind, about the possibility of bodily revival. There is then sufficient ground for a thriving belief in what we may call corpse-spectres or haunting corpses, a belief which, as books teach us, has frequently induced people to exhume and destroy corpses on account of apparitions ascribed to there. « Outside the south gate of Tan-yang, we read for instance, a member of the Lü tribe possessed a garden of beans, from which he drew very considerable profits. Always when the fruits were ripening, Lü and his sons kept watch there against thieves. One night the moon was shining brightly, and the father was squatting on a boulder with his eyes on his plants, when he saw among them a being, with hair hanging down disorderly, emerge from the ground. His eyes grew dim with fear ; he called his sons, and going to catch that being, they saw a young woman in red dress draw herself up with a bound ; the father fell to the earth in terror, and the sons ran back home like madmen, with the woman at their p.726 heels. At the main gate of the house she gave up the chase and stood quite rigid and motionless, one leg outside the gate, and the other within. The shrieks of the sons summoned the members of the family with their swords and sticks, but none ventured near the woman, lest her cold breath might strike them. Thus she quietly resumed her advance, stooped, and disappeared under a bed. Having revived their unconscious father with some ginger-water, the sons took him home, and convoked the neighbours. They all set to work to dig up the ground under the bed, and they found a red coffin with the corpse of a woman in red, resembling that of"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 244 the previous night. From that time the father and the sons lacked courage to watch their garden and its trees. Three days passed away, when a man was found lying under the beans. Lü and his sons brought him to his senses with a liquor, and asked him whence he came. — I am a neighbour of yours from the west side, he said ; seeing so many beans of you quite unguarded, I came to steal them, but suddenly saw under the plants a headless man beckoning to me ; I fell to the ground in terror at the sight. Again the sons fetched men to dig up the spot, and this time they found a black coffin with a headless corpse. The two bodies, quite rigid and undecayed, they placed side by side and burned them ; and henceforth there occurred no more visitations (371). p.727 Such radical measures against corpses so dangerous seem to have been adopted in all times and ages. As noted on page 1406 of Book I, some two thousand years ago the Imperial consort Chao-sin disinterred and burned five of her husband’s concubines and slaves whom she had murdered, because their spectres disturbed her rest. In the fifth century, « antecedent to his demise, Tszĕ-hiun, prince of Tsin-ngan, was advised by a wu to open the mausoleum of the empress-dowager Chao (the consort of the emperor Wen), and to destroy her coffin, in order to suppress the evil it might work (372). Inspired by the same notions no doubt was the grandee of whom we have heard on page 424, when he destroyed by fire the corpse of his wife, to prevent it from emerging anew from her coffin for adulterous intercourse with another mandarin of that region. Not a few corpse-spectres have visited mankind in the shape of skulls. They did so at least so early as the fourth century, for we read in the collection of T‘ao Ts‘ien : « In Sin-yé the mother of one Yü Kin was ill. He and his two brothers were all at home to nurse her, and even in broad daylight burned fires (to scare away spectres). Once on a sudden they saw"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 245 the hangings for tying up the curtains roll themselves up and down several times, and heard for a moment a dog before the bed howl strangely. All the inmates of the house came to see what was the matter, and saw no dog, but a dead man’s head lying on the floor, with the hair still on it ; its two eyes rolled in their sockets — a most dreadful sight, scaring the family out of their wits. The thing then moved out of the house through the gate without being touched, and they buried it behind in a field ; but next morning going to look, they found that it had worked itself out of the ground, and that its eyes were still rolling as before. Again they buried it, and again it appeared next day above the ground ; on which they interred it with tiles over it, so that it came forth no more. Next day their mother breathed her last (373). p.728 Another work relates, that « in the village of Lai-t‘ing in Shang-tu Mrs. Li was sitting in the hall of her house in broad daylight, when suddenly she beheld her husband’s deceased sister in white dress, with a linen kerchief over her head. The phantom approached and pursued her, and she tried to escape by running round the bed, but the ghost did not give up the chase. She then ran away through the door. At full speed they tore across hills and rocks, and nobody had the courage to help her, but happily some cavalry at the north gate fell upon the ghost with their whips ; under their blows it shrunk away, until nothing remained of it on the ground but the kerchief, covering something which they found to be a skull (374). « Sun Kiün-sheu of Shang-shuh was an atrociously bad character, bent on insulting the shen and maltreating the kwei. Once he was strolling in the hills with some others, and had reason to retire. For fun he squatted over a dry skull by a neglected grave, and made it swallow his faeces, saying : — Eat this, is it not delicious ? on which the skull, its jaws wide open, spoke : — Yes it is."},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 246 Horrified at this, Kiün-sheu ran away as fast as his legs could bear him, with the skull rolling behind him over the ground like a car-wheel, till he reached a bridge, up which it could not manage to raise itself. From an eminence he saw the skull roll back to its old place. Ashy pale as a corpse he came home, and fell ill. Constantly he brought his excrements to his mouth with p.729 his hand, and swallowed them, saying to himself : — Eat this, is it not nice ? then he voided them anew, and devoured them again, going on in this wise for three whole days, when he died (375). This story seems an embellished version of the following : « In the year ping or ting of the Chi yuen period (1336 or 1337),. Yin Kang-lo and some other men of Lü-ling were out in the evening for a stroll to the Sih-kia lake. They were eating salted plums, and put the stones into the mouth of a skull lying on the roadside, with the words : — Do you find them salt ? They then passed on and came to a long trench. Here they saw in the bright moonlight a black ball coming rolling on behind them, crying : — They are salt, salt. In the greatest fright they ran more than ten miles, till they got across some water at the village of Yung, and heard the voice no more (376). Skulls may haunt even without being so bitterly provoked. « The country of Ch‘u-cheu (in Chehkiang pr.) is very mountainous. There, in the district of Li-shui, situated south of the peak of the Residence of the immortal Genii, farmers ploughing and sowing often break up waste ground, even as far as halfway up the mountains. In those mountains spectres abound, and people all begin and finish their work early, not venturing abroad in"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 247 dark. Once in the latter part of autumn, a land-owner, Li by name, came to the village to cut his rice, and put up alone in a farm-house. One night when the moon was shining splendidly, he was p.730 taking a stroll on the hill in front, when suddenly he saw a white thing hopping towards him. This strange sight quickly scared him back to his dwelling, which he reached with the thing close on his heels. Happily the entrance of the hut had a kind of railing, which could be slid forward, and which the spectre could not get over. He succeeded in pushing it to, and regaining his courage distinctly saw in the bright moonlight through the openings of the railing that a skull was biting the latter and butting against it ; the fetid stench was intolerable. After a few moments the cock crew, and he saw the thing drop to the ground as a mere heap of white bone ; and when it was light, he saw no more of it. He asked for information about that apparition, and a husbandman said : — You may congratulate yourself that you have had to do with a white bone ghost ; this circumstance has saved you from disaster ; — had it been the hoary old wife, feigning to keep a shop, she would of a certainty have offered you some of her tobacco to smoke, and those who smoke it generally lose their vitality. That spectre always appears to do its evil work in nights with bright moonshine and pure breeze, and it can be knocked down with nothing else but a broom. I have never learned what spectre this is (377). Even fragments of skulls may become haunting spectres. « The p.731 medical Buddhist priest Hing-jü related the following adventure of a colleague of his in Fuh-cheu, named Hung-tsi, a man of high order, living a pure life of severe abstinence. Having found a piece of a skull on the sand at the riverside, he placed it in his clothes-basket, and took it to his convent. Here, a few days later, while asleep, a being bit his ear and pulled at it, on which there followed a noise as of a falling object several peeks in size."},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 248 He thought that it was the bone, but next morning he found himself on the floor before his couch. He then broke the bone into six pieces, and placed them in the gutter of the eaves, and at midnight a series of lights as big as fowl’s eggs moved from there and disappeared under the tiles. He took a torch to the spot and admonished the bone, saying : — You cannot help a living man, for which of His designs would Heaven employ you, a decayed bone ? Herewith the phenomenon ceased (378). A much greater number of spectre-tales have for their topic corpses prowling about materially in their horrid entirety. We saw on page 410, that according to the Tso ch‘wen, Tszĕ-ch‘an stated as early as the sixth century before Christ, that a dead man might become a devil of an especially bad sort if his soul or souls did not leave his corpse. Numerous narratives point to the prevalence of that belief in all ages, up to this day. As early as the second century of our era an author wrote : « The pavilion at the west gate of Jü-yang, a place in Jü-nan (in Honan), was inhabited by a spectre. Visitors who lodged there had lost their lives, or if they resisted the spectre, some hair or some of their vitality ; and when one made inquiries after all that, he was told of strange beings haunting that place from days of yore. Later on, Ching Khi of I-luh, the literary officer of that province, arrived there. While yet six or seven miles from the spot, a very beautiful woman asked him for a seat in his p.732 carriage. At first he objected, but finally she mounted, and drove with him into the pavilion to the bottom of the stairs. Here the custodians had posted up a warning that the storey should not be ascended, but he answered that he did not feel any aversion to doing so ; and as it grew dark then, he mounted the stairs, and put up there for the night in the company of that woman. Before daybreak he departed. A custodian went upstairs to sweep, and found the corpse of a woman. Horrified he ran to the super-intendant of the pavilion, who beat the drum to call together the"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 249 officials from their apartments, and hurried with them to the spot to inspect the corpse. They discovered her to be the wife of one Wu, who lived eight miles off to the north-west. She had just then died, and on her being coffined that same evening the light had gone out ; and when another light was brought, she had disappeared. Her family now took the corpse home immediately. As to Ching Khi, he had hardly travelled a few miles when he was seized with belly-ache ; this became worse at the Li-yang pavilion in Sin-tun, and there he breathed this last. After that event nobody ventured to that storey (379). Yü Pao, in whose book the same narrative occurs (ch. 16), adds another-to the following effect : « In Yung-ch‘wen, one Chung Yin, alias Yuen-shang, had not attended the official meetings for several months, and his ideas and character took so singular a turn, that somebody asked him what was the matter with him. He then avowed that he received p.733 frequent visits from a lovely woman, an extraordinary beauty. — To be sure, she is a spectre, the other said, slay her ! Next time when the woman went, to him, she did not immediately advance, but lingered outside the door. He asked her for the reason ; — You wish to kill me, she replied. — No, said Yiu, and he called her urgently ; so she entered, and Yiu, though unwilling, struck at her and wounded her in the hip. Immediately the woman ran out of the house, wiping off the blood with a piece of new cloth all the way down the road. Next day Yiu had her footprints traced.

V 250 blood had been wiped off with some cotton hidden within her trousers (380). « The local notable Ching Pin-yü, we read in a work of the eighth century, relates, that when he sojourned somewhere in Ho-poh, the wife of the village-headman had just died and was still unburied, when after sunset her daughters suddenly heard music which slowly approached. On its arrival in the courtyard, the corpse moved ; when it had entered the room and apparently sounded between the beams and rafters of the roof, the corpse raised itself up for a dance ; the music then left the house, and the dead woman, after some stumbling, left the dwelling to follow it. This struck the family with terror. The moon being in its dark phase, they dared not go out to look for the corpse, but in the first watch of the night the village-headman came home. Apprised of the event, he broke a branch as thick as his arm from a mulberry tree, and nerved by some liquor set out in search, uttering deep maledictions. Penetrating into the brushwood which was full of graves, he marched five or six miles, when he heard p.734 the music in the trees of a cypress grove ; he drew near, and saw the woman dancing under the trees in the glare of lights. The head-man raised his stick and knocked her down ; the music stopped, and he carried the corpse home on his back (381). Thus also in China the dead are known to dance about occasionally at the sound of music, but I do not find them represented as gathering together purposely for nocturnal danses macabres. It is self-evident that, as two of the above tales bring out, bodily spectres must as a rule be corpses still fresh and undecayed, and indeed we find in the tales, that they rise especially before burial has hampered their movements by an envelope of solid wood and clay. Even tender women may then rage most fearfully, as the following story, much read, told, and re-told to this day, may testify : « A certain old man of Yang-sin (in Shantung) lived in Ts‘ai-tien, a place in that district. His village lay five or six miles from the walls of the district-city. He and his sons kept a roadside-inn to lodge"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 251 travelling traders, and several carters and itinerant pedlars used to put up under their roof. One day as it was getting dark, four men appeared. Perceiving the house, they went thither with the intention of staying, but the sleeping-rooms destined for visitors were all occupied. Considering that there was no other place to put up, the four men urgently entreated he landlord to take them in somehow, on which he hm’d, and said he thought a place might be found for them, though it would not suit their taste. The strangers replied that all they desired was a single mat to sleep on, and a shelter, and that they could not be at all particular. The fact was, that a daughter-in-law of the old man had just died, her body still lay p.735 uncoffined in her house, and the son had gone to fetch a coffin and had not yet returned. The old man took the strangers down the street into the lonely house where the corpse lay. They entered the apartment, where a lamp shed a dim light over a table ; behind this a curtain hung, and the deceased woman lay there under paper shrouds. They saw also a sleeping-place in a screened-off section, with four beds placed against each other in a row. Fatigued by their journey, the strangers had no sooner thrown themselves on their pillows than they were snoring loudly. One of them was not quite off, when suddenly he heard a creaking sound on the couch of the corpse. Immediately he opened his eyes, and saw distinctly by the light of the lamp standing before the corpse, that it had raised the shroud and risen. In a moment it was on the floor, and slowly entered the sleeping-room. Her face had a wet gold hue, and she wiped her forehead with a coarse gauze cloth. In a stooping attitude she approached the beds and blew thrice on the three sleeping travellers ; the fourth, terror-struck, fearing that he too might be hit, gently drew the blanket over his face and held his breath to listen. Forthwith she breathed on him as she had done on the others ; then he perceived that she left the room, and hearing the rustling sound of the paper shrouds, he put out his head to take a peep, and saw her lying rigid as before. p.736 "},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol.

After a short pause, he knew by the noise on the death-bed that she had"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 253 lain down as before. Now he put his hand very slowly out of the blanket, seized his trousers, quickly got into them, and ran out of the house, bare-footed. The corpse too jumped up as if to give him chase ; but by the time it came forth from behind the curtain the traveller had drawn the bolt and was off. With the corpse at his heels he rushed forth with loud shrieks, which alarmed everybody in the hamlet. He would have thumped the door of the inn, but for his fear that it would make him lose time and bring him within reach of the demon ; so, seeing the road to the district-city before him, he ran up it with all his might, till he reached the eastern suburb. Here he saw a Buddhist convent, and hearing the wooden fish 1, nervously beat on the outer gate. But the monks, astonished at such an unusual tumult, hesitated to let him in ; and as he turned round, he saw the corpse quite near him, hardly one foot off. In these straits he sought shelter behind a white willow four or five feet thick, standing outside the convent-gate. As the corpse dodged to the right, he dodged to the left, and so on, which enraged the corpse more and more, and exhausted them both. On a sudden the corpse stood still. The traveller, soaked with perspiration and with panting chest, sheltered himself behind the tree ; the corpse raised itself fiercely and threw both its arms around it to grab him. At that moment he sank to the ground in fright, and the corpse thus missing its victim, remained rigid embracing the tree. For a good while longer the monks stood listening, and hearing nothing p.737 more, they came forth circumspectly, to find the traveller flat on the ground. By the light of their torches they perceived, that though he was apparently dead, there was still a slight palpitation under his heart. They bore him into the convent, but the night passed away before he came round. Having refreshed him with some broth, they interrogated him, and he related to them the whole story. By that time the  1 A hollow, fish-shaped block beaten with a clapper white reciting sacred books and liturgies."},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 254 morning-bell sounded, and in the early dawn, still dimmed by mist and fog, the monks examining the tree discovered the woman upon it in a rigid condition. In great consternation they reported the incident to the magistrate of the district. This grandee appeared in person on the spot to hold an inquest, and ordered his men to pull off the arms of the woman ; but so firmly were they fixed in the tree that it was impossible to unclasp them. They found, in fact, on a closer inspection, that the four fingers of either hand were bent like hooks, and sunk into the wood so deeply that the nails were buried in it. A fresh batch of men was set to work to pull with p.738 all their might ; and as they tore her off, the holes made by the fingers were found to look as if made with a chisel or auger. Now the mandarin dispatched a messenger to the old man, who gave him a confused mixture of truth and untruth about the disappearance of the corpse and the death of the travellers. The matter being explained to him, he followed the messenger and took the corpse home. The traveller, bursting into tears, said to the magistrate : — I left my home with three men, and now I must return alone ; what shall I do to make my fellow-villagers believe my words ? So the mandarin gave him a certificate, and sent him home with some presents (382). Not less instructive on our subject is the following tale : « In Shao-hing (in Chehkiang pr.), a scholar, named Wang So-and-so, had enjoyed a government allowance of rice (for his literary attainments) for a year, when a wealthy family in a village engaged him as a teacher. Their house was too small to lodge him, but fortunately there was a new house about one mile off, for which the owners sought a buyer. The family purchased it, and lodged the teacher in it."},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 255 Having inspected its interior, Wang returning to the gate proceeded to walk up and down and lean on it. By that time night had fallen, and by the bright moonlight he saw on the hill a brilliant glare. He hastened thither, and perceived that it beamed forth from a coffin of unpainted wood. ‘Were this a ghost-light (will-o’the-wisp), said Wang to himself, it would be white, with flames slightly tinged red ; is it perchance the spirit of gold or silver ?’ It now flashed across him that it was recorded in the ‘Bag of Knowledge’, that a number of Turks and Huns in mourning clothes had loaded some coffins on cars and buried them outside the town, and that their pursuers, on tracing those coffins, had found them full of yellow and white metal ; would not this coffin p.739 be something similar ? What luck that nobody but he was there to appropriate it ! He picked up a stone, hammered the nails out, and forced up the lid at the head ; but how great was his horror on seeing a corpse with a livid face and a swollen belly ! It wore a cap of hempen stuff and sandals of straw, it being customary in the Yueh region to bury with such articles all parents who have survived their sons. Wang recoiled in terror, but every receding movement was a signal for the corpse to rise a little more, and when he made a few more steps backward, the corpse of a sudden rose upright, Wang ran away like a madman at the top of his speed, the corpse at his heels. Right through the door he tore and up to the garret of the house, closed the door, and bolted it. Now for the first time he got a little breath. Supposing the corpse to have gone, he opened the window to take a peep, but at the same moment it raised its head, and with gestures of delight rushed in with a bound and thumped the door repeatedly, but finding it impossible to enter, suddenly gave vent to a loud piteous cry. At the third shriek the doors flew open, as if by an unseen hand ; the corpse climbed the stairs up to the garret, and Wang had no other alternative but to take his club and confront it. No sooner did it reach the landing than the club came down on its shoulder, scattering over the floor several ingots of silver paper hanging thereon ; the corpse stooped to pick them"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 256 up ; Wang took this chance, and gave it a push with all his might, so that it rolled from the top of the stairs. Just at this juncture he heard the cock crow, and from that moment the corpse remained motionless and silent. On examining it by the daylight, he found it lying across the ground, its thigh-bone wounded by the tumble p.740 it had suffered. He summoned the people, and as they carried the corpse away to burn it, he heaved a sigh, saying : — It was my covetousness that called the corpse upstairs, and it is the covetousness of the corpse that now causes it to be destroyed by fire ; thus, if demons should not be covetous, how much more ought men not to be so ! (383) Corpse-demons do not always content themselves with homicide ; many indulge also in theft or robbery. « Two men of Kin-ling (Nanking), Chang Yü-kuh and Li So-and-so, connected by ties of friendship, had a trading business together in Kwangtung. Chang, returning for some reason from the south homewards, was entrusted by Li with a letter for his family, which, as soon as he came home he went to deliver at its address. On this occasion he saw a coffin in the hall, and learned that Li’s father had in the mean time died. Wherefore he set out a sacrifice for the soul on the spot, and performed the customary worship, which the Li family appreciated highly. The widow appeared, and seeing this charming and elegant youth, not much more than twenty years old, she placed dainties before him and regaled him well ; and as it was already dark, she offered him lodgings for the night. Between his sleeping-place and the coffin was nothing but an open courtyard. At the second night-drum he saw by the bright p.741 moonlight Li’s widow come out of the female apartments and peep through the crevice of his window. He started, and deeming feminine decency inconsistent with such behaviour, resolved to repel her forthwith should she open the door and enter. At this juncture it struck him that the woman, with an incense-stick in her hand, turned to her husband’s soul-altar and muttered something"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 257 there as if she expostulated, upon which she returned to Chang’s room, put off her waistband, bound the upper iron rings of the door with it, and retired at a slow pace. Chang’s fright and suspicion were increased so much by all this that he lacked courage to go to bed. Suddenly he heard from the place where the coffin stood a creaking noise ; off fell the lid, and up sat a man with a pitch-black face. He had sunken eyes with green pupils emitting flashes of light ; he was of an extraordinary ferocity and hideousness. With long strides he ran out of the apartment, straightway for Chang’s room. There he uttered a shrill spectral whistling, on which a cold blast of wind got up at the four sides, and the waistband on the door snapped into fragments. With all his might Chang pushed back the door, but he was overpowered, and the corpse jumped in. p.742 Fortunately there stood beside the door a large wooden cup-board : ; Chang pushed it against the corpse, so that it capsized and the corpse fell underneath it, but at the same moment Chang swooned away. The incident had not escaped the attention of Li’s wife. She and the family ran in with torches and lights, and poured some ginger-water into Chang’s mouth to restore him to his senses, and then she spoke to him : — This is my husband ; his life having been far from correct, he has become a corpse-demon, breaking out now to work evil. He was much bent on wealth. Last night he appeared to me in a dream, and announced to me the arrival of one Chang with a letter ; ‘this man, he said, has two hundred coins in his girdle ; I will kill him, take half the amount in my coffin, and give you the rest for the household’. I took this all for a bad dream and put no belief in it, but there ! you did indeed arrive and put up here for the night. So I burned incense before the corpse, praying, conjuring, and exhorting it not to give rein to its wicked purpose ; yet fearing that it might push open the door and kill you, I tied the rings of the door with my waistband, having no idea that he would exert such tremendous force."},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 258 They bore the corpse back into the coffin, and Chang advised the woman to burn it, the sooner the better, so as to cut short its evil works once for all. — I have long been thinking to do so, the woman replied, but as he is my husband, I could not find it in my heart ; now, however, I cannot help complying with the prevailing custom. Chang assisted her in defraying the expenses of an altar, to which they called some Buddhist priests of repute to bring about his translation. into a better condition ; and they cremated his corpse ; and not till then did the family live in peace and quiet (384). p.743 These tales amply suffice to teach us how extremely ferocious corpse-spectres are. Even powerful gods do not always come off uninjured when they interfere between those demons and their victims. « In Suh-cheu, for example, one Li Kiu, who earned a living as an itinerant cloth-merchant, crossed the Hoh mountains, where the approaching night and the crowded inns compelled him to put up in a Buddhist temple. The waterclock had sunk to the second drum-watch (11 P. M.), and he was in a sound sleep, when he saw in his dream the god Wei-t‘o 1, who smote him on the back, exclaiming : — Rise, rise ! be quick, be quick, a great danger is near ; take shelter behind me and save yourself. Li awoke with a shudder, and leaping to his feet, perceived that a coffin, stored away behind his coach, was giving forth creaking sounds. And out came a corpse, covered all over with white hairs, as if it wore a robe of silvery rat-skins inside out. Its face too was overgrown with such hairs ; its eyes were deep and black, and had green eye-balls emitting glaring rays. Straightway this monster made for Li, in order to attack him ; but he rushed up the shrine  1 A warlike defender of the Buddhist Church. His image, clad in armour, stands in praying attitude, armed with a club, in the court of almost every Buddhist temple or convent, behind the main entrance, right opposite the central chapel containing the principal Buddhas to whom the edifice is dedicated. His image is also to be seen very often on the altar of these saints, on their left side."},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 259 containing the Buddhist images, and cowered down behind Wei-t‘o’s back. The corpse threw its arms around this idol, and set its teeth into it so fiercely that it cracked ; Li shouted for help at the top of his voice, and all the monks hurried out of their beds to the rescue with clubs and flaming torches ; the corpse fled, and ran into its coffin, which they found thereupon close as before. Next morning they examined whether Wei-t‘o had suffered damage from the corpse-spectre, and they found his club in three pieces, thus showing how great the force and the ferocity of that being were. The monks sent the news to the magistrate, who burned the coffin ; and Li, filled with gratitude p.744 towards Wei-t‘o for his help, caused a new image to be made for him, neatly gilded (385). The name under which corpse-spectres mostly appear in books, is kiang shi, ‘corpses lying flat or rigid’. A very common term is also shi kwai, ‘apparitions of corpses’ or ‘corpse-spectres’. We have seen (Book I, p. 106 seq.) that they greatly occupy credulous and superstitious minds in Amoy ; we may recollect that there and in the surrounding country they are deemed to be produced by the sun or the moon’ shining on encoffined human remains still unburied. This idea involves nothing strange when we remember that the light and warmth of the universe constitute universal vitality. We have stated also (Book I, page 127) that the dead are especially prone to become kiang shi when a long postponement of their burial inspires them with bitter rancour : a powerful warning to the living to not unduly delay burials. The fact that, nevertheless, the empire is actually studded with unburied human remains, on the other hand greatly nourishes the inveterate belief in those spectres. There seem to be parts of China where, merely for fear of kiang shi, the natural decay of corpses is accelerated on purpose by exposing them in the open air. We infer this from the following note of Sui Yuen : « West from Fung-siang (in Shensi pr.), common people who die are not buried immediately, but in many cases exposed in the open air until the blood and flesh have entirely p.745 decayed ; after this process is finished, they perform the burial, otherwise, it is said,"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 260 the dead will give rise to evil (hiung). If burial takes place before decomposition, and the corpse obtains breath from the earth, it will after three months be overgrown entirely with hairs ; if these are white, it is called a white evil, and if they are black, a black evil. It then enters houses to cause calamity (386). We have now to pay attention to yet another point, also touched upon already in this work (Book I, p. 106) : kiang shi are anthropophagous and prey on human blood. They are therefore correlated with east-European vampires, or living corpses which break forth from their tombs and attack the living to satiate their cravings for human flesh and blood. Tales about blood-sucking kiang shi have not been found by us in Chinese literature anterior to the eighteenth century, the Tszĕ puh yü being for the present the only work we know that has them 1. « When Tsiang, Governor of Ying-cheu, resided in Ngan-cheu, in the province of Pehchihli, he met with a man who nervously moved both his arms continuously as if he swung bells. On being asked why he did so, he told the following tale : My family lives in the village So-and-so, which consists of not more than a few dozen houses. There a kiang shi came from the hills soaring through the air, to devour the infants of the people. Though daily at sunset the people exhorted each other to shut their doors and conceal their children, nevertheless it occurred from time to time that some were kidnapped by the monster. The villagers sounded its grave, but they could not find the bottom of it, so that nobody ventured to take any measures against it. At that time we heard that there was living in the town a Taoist doctor So-and-so, proficient in magic arts. We collected money p.746 and presents for him, and went to ask him to arrest that  1 Is this coincident with the vampire-panic (the first known in Europe ?) which infested Poland and Polish Russia in the last years of the seventeenth century, spreading rapidly over Bulgaria and Servia, and occupying the minds of scholars and theologians of Europe in the first quarter of the next ?"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 261 spectre. He assented, and appeared in our village on an auspicious day. He put up an altar for the performance of his magic, and said to the people : ‘My magic enables me to spread a net over the sky and a net over the earth, preventing that demon from flying away, but you must help me with your weapons ; besides I want a man of much courage to enter that grave’. Nobody in the crowd ventured to present himself for this task, except myself, who stepped to the front, and asked for what he would employ me. ‘Corpse-spectres, the magician replied, generally fear very much the sound of jingles and hand-gongs ; when the night comes, you must watch the moment when the spectre flies out, and forthwith enter the grave with two big bells ; but do not stop ringing them, for a short pause will suffice for the corpse to enter the grave, and you will then be the sufferer’. The waterclock just began to sink, when the doctor mounted his altar to perform his magic. And I, with two bells, watched the moment when the corpse flew out. Then with all their might and main my arms waved up and down in a quick succession like rain-drops, and I dared not pause for one short moment, as the spectre was at the entrance of the grave. Horribly ferocious it looked ; its furious glances never turned away from me while the sound of the bells kept it running about the spot without courage to enter. Beset by the crowd everywhere in front, there was no way of escape for it ; so with impetuous movements of its hands and with outstretched arms it fought the villagers, until the first blush of dawn cast it flat on the ground. Our men then took it up and burned it. Meanwhile I remained in the grave, ignorant of the issue, swinging the bells incessantly, as I lacked courage to stop them.

V 262 motion, and they have been diseased like this to this day (387). p.747 « Liu N.N., a literary graduate of the lowest degree in Wu-kiang (in Kiangsu), was in charge of some pupils belonging to the Tsiang family in the Yuen-hwo district. In the season of Pure Brightness (Book I, p. 968) he returned home, some holidays being granted him to sweep his ancestral tombs. This duty performed, he would return to his post, and said to his wife : ‘to morrow I must go ; cook some food for me at an early hour’. The woman said she would do so, and rose for the purpose at cock-crow. Their village lay on the hill behind their dwelling, facing a brook. The wife washed some rice at that brook, picked some vegetables in the garden, and had everything ready, but when it was light her husband did not rise. She went into his room to wake him up, but however often she called, he gave no answer. So she opened the curtains, and found him lying across the bed, headless, and not a trace of blood to be seen. p.748 Terror-stricken she called the neighbours. All of them suspected her of adultery with a lover and murder, and they warned the magistrate. This grandee came and held a preliminary inquest ; he ordered the corpse to be coffined for the time being, had the woman put into fetters and examined her, but this brought no evidence against her ; so he put her in gaol, and many months passed away without sentence being pronounced. Then a neighbour going up-hill for some fuel, saw a neglected grave with a coffin laid bare ; it was quite a sound coffin, strong and solid, and yet the lid was raised a little ; so he naturally suspected that it had been opened by thieves. He summoned the people ; they lifted the lid off, and saw a corpse with features like a living person and a body covered with white hair. Between its arms it held the head of a man, which they recognized as that of Liu, the graduate. They reported the case to the magistrate ; the coroners ordered the head to be taken away, but it was so firmly grasped in the arms of the corpse that the combined efforts of a number of men proved"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 263 insufficient to draw it out. So the mandarin told them to chop off the arms of the kiang shi. Fresh blood gushed out of the wounds, but in Liu’s head there was not one drop left, it having been sucked dry by the monster. By magisterial, order the corpse was burned, and the case ended with the release of the woman from gaol (388). It may be noticed, that in Europe too it was a prevalent opinion that the best means to deal with vampires was to destroy them by fire. But the Chinese have yet other means of disabling those monsters. They argue, that if the lid of the coffin be removed as p.749 soon as the devil is out, its evil works will be over for good ; in truth, as the air will then enter freely into the coffin, its contents will immediately decay, and thus lose their strength. « A certain gentleman, strong and robust, sojourning in Hukwang, lodged there quite alone in an old Buddhist temple. One night he was strolling by very fine moonlight outside the gate, and saw in the grove a being with hazy form, wearing a kerchief after the T‘ang fashion, and moving so lightly towards him that he could not but take it for a ghost. As it turned to the darkest part of a pine-copse and there entered an old grave, he was fully convinced that it was a kiang shi. He had heard that such a demon can do no evil when it misses the lid of its coffin. So next night he concealed himself in the grove, to watch its departure and take the lid away. The second watch ended (after 11 P.M.), the corpse came forth indeed, as if for an assignation. He followed it to the gate of a large house, in the garret of which a woman in red had thrown out a white rope from the window, wherewith to draw him up ; the spectre seized it and climbed up it, and they engaged in a long conversation without making any peculiar noise. Our hero’s first act now was to retrace his steps and steal the lid from the coffin. Having concealed it well, he hid himself again in the deepest part of the pine-grove. Night was about to depart, when the corpse returned hurriedly. Seeing the lid gone, it showed great consternation. It searched for it everywhere, and then ran off"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 264 by the same road by which it had come. Again our hero followed it. At the storeyed building he witnessed the bounds and leaps of the corpse, and how it gave vent to chattering cries, p.750 answered by the chattering of the woman in the garret. She just motioned him off with her hand, as if to signal to him to come back no more, when on a sudden the crowing of the cock was heard, and the corpse fell down flat on the roadside. In the early morning-hour the passers-by gathered to the spot, and all without exception were greatly frightened. They hurried to the storeyed building to satisfy their curiosity : this was the ancestral temple of the Cheu family, where a coffin was kept unburied in the garret, and outside that coffin a female kiang shi was lying. The facts convinced everybody that they had to do with a curious case of irregular commerce between such demons ; wherefore they laid them side by side, and burnt them (389). Another effectful and very easy expedient for getting rid of visitations from corpses, is to watch any suspected coffin until the corpse has quitted it, and then strew rice, red peas, and bits of iron around it. The corpse on returning will find it impossible to pass over those things, and will soon be found stiff and dead on the ground ; it may then be burned without any danger, even, if desirable, together with the coffin. The only difficulty is to find a man brave enough for the dangerous part of the enterprise. It is, according to the Chinese, by no means a rare thing in their country for corpses to sit up on their death-bed and strike terror and fright into the hearts of their mourning kinsfolk. We touched on this point already on page 43 of Book I, adding that a pole, a piece of furniture, or some household utensil, especially a broom, is then required to restore the corpse to its recumbent position, while care must be taken to prevent cats from touching it. It is related, that « Liu I-hien was an able portrait-painter in Hang-cheu. For neighbours he had a father with his son, living in the same house. The father died, and the son, going out to p.751 buy a coffin, asked I-hien through another neighbour to make in the mean time a"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 265 portrait of the father. The painter went to the house, where to his great regret he found nobody ; and supposing the corpse to be lying upstairs, he walked up the ladder, sat down at the bedside, and drew forth his brushes. On a sudden the corpse rose with a start. It flashed through I-hien that he might have to do with a running corpse, and he remained therefore quietly seated, motionless. The corpse too did not stir, but with its eyes closed opened and shut its jaws continuously, only wrinkling its brows at each such movement. If I run away, said the painter to himself, the corpse is sure to pursue me ; the best thing will be to quietly do my work to the end. And he took his brushes, laid out his paper, and made a sketch of the corpse, during which it aped every movement of his arms and fingers. Meanwhile he cried aloud at the top of his voice, but nobody answered. Suddenly the son came up the ladder. Seeing his father in a sitting posture, he fell to the floor in terror, and a neighbour who arrived after him was so horrified at the resurrected corpse, that he tumbled off the landing. I-hien, in the greatest consternation, had to screw up all his courage to remain where he was, until the porters arrived with the coffin. Remembering that corpses, when in a running state, are afraid of brooms, he cried : ‘bring a broom ! and the coffin-bearers understood from these words that they had to do with a ‘running corpse’. They seized a broom, mounted the stairs, and broomed the corpse into its former position ; they also brought the man on the floor back to consciousness by pouring an essence of ginger down his throat, and coffined the corpse (390). p.752 Even when one is already in a kiang shi’s murderous embrace, there are effectual means to release him. « Ere Yiu Ming-fu, named Pei-lien, entered the Government service, he lodged somewhere in Honan. There, according to him, coffins were kept in sheds outside the towns in numbers so great, that seizures of men by kiang shi were of common occurrence. But the rural population had an expedient against them, not so very"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 266 curious : when some one was clasped by a corpse in its arms and held by it in a most firm embrace, so that even when the arms were cut off, the claws still stuck in the flesh and could not be extracted, then they drove seven jujube stones into the backbone of the corpse, with the result that its arms relaxed their hold. They applied this method on several occasions, always finding it efficacious. A corpse running about shortly after death they called a running shadow ; it thus wanders under the impulse of yang breath. If a man is embraced by such a demon, this is to be treated in the above-mentioned way (391). Chinese, theorizing on the subject of corpse-spectres, admit that in general these are under the dominion of their p‘oh or that one of the two souls which is identified with the earth, to which it returns with the corpse (cf. page 5). Now as the p‘oh is the grosser, the unintellectual soul, those spectres and their doings are not ruled by intelligence, virtue or propriety, but they rage madly without self-control, even against those who never did them any wrong. Nevertheless their actions may be regulated in some degree by their good genius, their hwun, because it is this soul which p.753 brings about their revival ; on this ground they may behave as friendly spectres, however without their dangerous character being entirely suppressed, for the p‘oh may at any moment resume its paramount influence. The following tale illustrates these theories : « In the Nan-ch‘ang district, in the province of Kiangsi, two gentlemen, the one of middle age and the other young, were studying in the convent of the Northern Orchid, and lived on terms of the closest friendship. The older one went home, and died there suddenly, while the other, ignorant of this calamity, quietly continued his studies in the convent. One day, as it grew dark, he was slumbering, and saw his friend open the gate and enter. Seating himself on the couch, he patted him on his back, saying : — Hardly ten days after I took my leave of you, I died suddenly, and now I am a ghost, which, unable to banish its feelings of friendship, comes to bid you farewell."},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 267 The young man made an effort to cry for help, but he could not utter a word ; on which the other soothed him. — Should I harbour any desire to harm you, he said, I should, indeed, not speak so unaffectedly ; do not be afraid ; I have come to entrust to you some of my affairs after my death. Thus re-assured a little, the young man asked him what these were. — In the first place, was the reply, I have an old mother, now upwards of seventy years, and a wife who is not yet thirty ; a few bushels of rice will suffice to feed them ; I hope you will take care of them in every way. Further I possess an unedited manuscript ; please have it printed, lest the little repute I have gained should perish. And in the third place, I have an undischarged debt of a few thousand coins to the merchant of writing-brushes ; pay this off. The young one promise to fulfil those wishes. Then the dead man rose, and with the words : — Having thus given you those charges, I can depart. he was about to go, when the young man, whose fears had all vanished on hearing him speak so exactly in the tone and the way of an ordinary man, and seeing his features so like those he had while alive, detained him with tears. — We are going to separate for so long a time, he said, why do not you stay a little longer, why do you go so soon ? and the dead too burst into tears, and sat down on the bed again. For a while they indulged in conversation about the concerns of life, till he rose a second time, with the words : — Now I am going away. He stood up, but did not go. He gazed hard at him, and became so hideous that the young man, whose fears returned, motioned to p.754 him to go ; — Now you have had your say, go ! said he ;"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 268 but the corpse remained, and did not even depart when the other, thumping on the couch, set up a loud cry. In a bold erect attitude the corpse remained where it was, and fright overcame the young student so thoroughly that he jumped up and took to his heels. The corpse pursued him ; faster he ran, but just as close the corpse followed him, till after a number of miles he scaled a wall, and fell flat to the ground on the other side. This obstacle the corpse could not surmount ; it stretched out its neck over it, and froth and saliva dribbled down from its mouth on the young man’s face. In the morning-light wayfarers came by and gave the young man some ginger-essence to drink ; and just as he was coming round the owners of the corpse arrived to seek it. So nothing being told them of the incident, they took it home, and completed the coffining. Experts in such matters then declared : The hwun of man is good and is his spiritual power and wisdom (ling), but his p‘oh is bad and stupidly inconsiderate. When this corpse appeared (at the bedside), the spiritual wisdom had not yet vanished from it, but the p‘oh accompanied the hwun on this excursion, and no sooner had the hwun departed then the affection (cherished towards the student) was finished. The hwun totally dispersed, and the p‘oh remained in the corpse ; as long as the hwun was present in the corpse, this was the very man himself, but as soon as it was gone, the corpse was the man no more. Corpses wandering about in this world, and ‘running shadows’ are all produced by the p‘oh ; only men who possess the Tao can dominate this soul (392). p.755 A corpse-spectre is described to us by the following tale actually helping a man out of a dreadful emergency : « Tso, a literary graduate of the lowest degree in T‘ung-ch‘ing, lived in the greatest harmony of conjugal fidelity with his wife, a woman of the Chang tribe. She fell sick and died, and Tso, unable to part with her remains, lay beside the coffin for whole days. On the 15th of the seventh month his family organized an Ulamba meeting (for the feeding of the souls and their redemption from"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 269 hell). Every one was abroad arranging the mass in honour of the Buddhas, and the graduate sat quite by himself by his wife’s coffin over a book, when with a sudden blast of cold wind the ghost of a hanged man appeared, its hair dishevelled, blood trickling from its body, and the cord trailing behind it. Straight-way it made for the graduate to attack him. In his terror he thumped hastily at the coffin, exclaiming : — To the rescue, dear wife ! and on a sudden the woman pushed up the lid and lifted p.756 herself up. — Thou bad devil, she thundered forth, dost thou thus attack my goodman without any respect ! and brandishing her arms, she dealt it such sound blows that it hobbled away out of the house. Now she turned to the graduate : — You idiot, you have incurred all this by our ardent conjugal love, but your felicity is so slight that evil spirits do not shrink from harming you ; come along to my home ; shuffle off your mortal coil, and let us plan again a life of concord, to last until our old age. The graduate assented, on which the woman returned into the coffin. He called his family, who found the rows of nails all snapped, and half a breadth of the woman’s petticoat caught under the lid. Ere that year had passed away, the graduate also died (393). Corpses may have yet other reasons for rising from their death-beds and haunting the living. Cases are mentioned, and believed by everybody, of murdered persons thus temporarily returning to life in order to denounce their murderers and cause them to be punished, superstition thus being here a good deterrent of homicidal crime. « In Si-hiang, in Shang-cheu (Kiangsu prov.), lived a man of the Ku tribe, who being out in the suburb at sunset asked for a lodging in an old temple. The priest of the temple said :"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol.

Ku assented ; he closed the temple-door, blew out the lamp, and laid himself down to sleep. p.757 At the third watch a man knocked at the door very boisterously. Ku cried : — Who are you ? and a voice outside answered : — I am Ch‘en Ting-lan. Ch‘en Ting-lan was a comrade of Ku in former days, who died more than ten years before. Greatly affrighted he refused to open the door, but the man outside cried : — Do not fear me, I have some secret to confide to you ; if you do not open without loss of time, I shall become a spectre, and do you think that I should then be unable to push in the door by myself alone and enter ? So Ku could not help opening ; and the lock gave a dull noise, as if there fell a man down to the ground. With hands trembling nervously and eye-lids quivering, Ku was going to take up a candle, when suddenly there sounded a loud voice from the ground. — I am not Ch‘en Ting-lan, said it, I am N.N., the man who has just died in the house to the east, poisoned by my principal wife, who is an adulteress ; I told you I was Ch‘en Ting-lan because I desire to ask you to redress the wrong which has been done to me. — But I am no mandarin, said Ku, how then, shall I redress it ?

Ku went to let them in : it was the priests returning to the temple, everybody in consternation, for, said they, — Just as we were reciting our holy scripts for the burial of the corpse, it mysteriously disappeared, so that we had to stop and go home. Now Ku told them what was the reason of it ; they threw light on the corpse with their p.758 torches, and saw blood flowing out of the seven openings of its face all around over the ground. The next day they reported the incident to the authorities, who avenged the victim (394). The ideas about corpse-spectres unfolded in the above pages, being expressed in writing are no doubt those of the intellectual generally, just as well as of the vulgar class. Authors also display their firm belief in such spectres by applying to them some abstruse Yin-and-Yang philosophy, for, in fact, those beings, like everything in the Universe, are created by these two powers ; but we need not follow them in this nonsense. According to the author of the Tszĕ puh yü, we have to distinguish sharply corpse-spectres from three other sorts of corpses. « There are in the ground wandering corpses, hidden corpses, and unchanging bones, altogether coffin-less and without outer garments. The first-named change place in the ground according to the (twenty-four) seasons, by lunar influence. The hidden corpses have always lain hidden in the ground undecayed for a thousand years. And unchanging bones are those of a part of the body winch was specially imbued with vitality during life ; when the bones are buried, the coffin with the clothes will decay, and the body with the skeleton become clay, but only the bones of that part will not change. They are as black as sonorous jet ; when long under the influence of the vitality of the sun or the moon, they also acquire the capacity of working evil. Of dead rice-porters the shoulder-"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 272 blades will rot away last of all, and of dead car-men the thigh-bones, for by the strength they exerted during their lives vitality gathered in those bones, so that the latter are not liable to an easy decay in the ground. So also it is with the hidden p.759 corpses ; a hidden corpse which after a long time receives vitality, becomes a wandering corpse, and after a still longer time a flying Yaksha (p. 466) (395). Kiang shi after a long time become able to fly, and do not conceal themselves in their coffins any longer. They are then covered all over with white hairs a foot long, and even longer, which hang down disorderly, and they give light when they come out or retire. After a second period of time they become Yakshas soaring through the sky, which do not die unless thunder strikes them. The only weapons which can kill them are rifles. The mountaineers in Fuhkien every now and then have to do with them, and then call huntsmen to attack them in several places from the branches of the trees. These beings are very strong, as strong as bears. They come forth in the night, then grasping men and injuring field-crops (396). « Mr. Yü Ts‘ang-shih (or Shih Yü-ts‘ang) says : — A kiang shi appearing at night to catch men generally looks fleshy not unlike living man, but when we open its coffin in the daytime, it looks as dry and lean as a mummy. Some, while being burned, make a piping noise (397). p.760 « The lions and elephants on which the Buddhas ride, says Tsiang Ming-fu of Shang-cheu, are well known to man, but the wolves (or jackals) which they bestride are unknown. Such wolves are metamorphosed kiang shi. A certain man walking at night saw a corpse open its coffin and step out. Conceiving he had to do with a kiang shi, he waited till it had left the coffin, which then he filled up with potsherds and stones, retiring thereupon into the garret of a farm to espy the issue. Towards the fourth watch (one o’clock A. M.) the corpse returned, striding with long steps, apparently with"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 273 something in its arms. Coming to the coffin and finding it impossible to enter it, it cast wrathful looks all around, its eyes wide open and emitting a flashing light. Thus it perceived there was somebody in the garret, and hurried thither to seek him, but its legs being as stiff as dead wood, unsuited for ascending a ladder, it removed this furiously. Our affrighted hero finding it impossible to descend by the ladder, grasped the branches of a tree, and let himself down by it, but the kiang shi perceived him and was at his heels. Off ran the terror-stricken man with all the speed he could muster. Happily he could swim. It flashed through him that such a corpse might be unable to enter water ; he made his way through the stream to the other shore, and left the corpse running to and fro hesitatingly for a while, with spectral cries and piteous howling. Then with three leaps into the air it transformed itself into a quadruped, and galopped off. It left something behind on the ground, which was found to be the corpse of a baby, half gnawed away and sucked quite dry. Some say that corpses at their first transformation become devils of drought, and that the next change makes wolves of them. These beasts possess spiritual intelligence, belch forth smoke and fire, and can fight dragons ; hence it is that the Buddhas ride them to keep them under (398). p.761 Thus in China too vampirism is connected with lycanthropy. If now we recall to our minds the belief, mentioned on page 518, that dead men may become devils of drought, it follows that the latter may appear in a threefold shape, or that there exist three sorts of them. The author of the Tszĕ puh yü says indeed : « There are three species of drought-causing pah. One are like quadrupeds ; an other kind are transformations of kiang shi, and both these species are able to produce drought and stop wind and rain. But the principal, superior drought-demons, called koh 1, cause still more damage ; they resemble men, but are taller, and have one eye on the top of the head.

When the latter suddenly vanish, it will rain (399). As animals, corporally and mentally, are organisms similar to men, it is clear that they too, when undecayed, may become dangerous corpse-spectres.

V 275 CHAPTER XI Anthropophagous and Necrophagous Spectres @ p.762 Apparently the belief in anthropophagous spectres must be old in China, and firmly rooted in the popular mind. Knowing from pp. 364 sqq. that the eating of human flesh under certain circumstances has been at all times a rather commonplace thing in that country, it would be, indeed, remarkable if spectres, being generally represented as cruel and ferocious, were thought entirely exempt from such savage tendencies. We have at the outset to place among the cannibal spectres the living corpses to which we have devoted the preceding chapter, so notorious also for a craving for blood. We have also to mention the man-eating tiger and wolf demons, described in Chapter V. An old reference to anthropophagous spirits we gave on page 521 in an extract from Wei Chao’s writings, according to which wang-siang were deemed in his time to be cannibals. We have mentioned on page 574 the celestial dogs, preying on human livers and blood in the sixth century of our era. In the writings of Twan Ch’ing-shih we read : « In the Ta lih period (766-780), a member of the gentry, dwelling in a village in Wei-nan (Shensi prov.), fell sick and died in the Metropolis. His wife, a woman of the Liu clan, then remained established in that village with her son, eleven or twelve years old. On a summer-night this boy was attacked by fits of fear and sleeplessness. When the third watch had set in (at 11 P.M.), she saw an old man in white, with a pair of tusks protruding from his jaws. He gazed fixedly upon her for a time, then he stepped slowly to her couch, in front of which a female slave lay in a sound sleep, and grasped this woman by her throat. A gnawing sound was heard : her clothes were tore off from her by his hands, and he grasped her, and devoured her in a moment to the bare skeleton, which he finally lifted up to suck out the five viscera. The woman saw that the old man’s mouth was as big as a sieve. Just then the"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 276 boy began to cry, p.763 so that the apparition totally vanished, but the slave was reduced to mere bones. Several months afterwards elapsed without anything particular coming to pass (400). The following tale is stated to have been derived from the writings of the same author : « In the Ching yuen period (755-805) there lived west of the Wang-yuan post-house one Wang Shen. With his own hands he had planted a copse of elms, and put up there some straw sheds, to distribute rice-water gratuitously to travellers in the summer-months. He had a son of thirteen years, whom he often charged with ministering to the visitors. One day, the boy told his father that there was a young woman on the road, who asked for some water. He ordered the boy to call her in. She was young, and wore a robe of bluish staff and a white cap. Her house, she said, stood some ten miles off to the south ; her husband had died childless, and she was wearing already the dress of the last period of mourning ; now she was going to Ma-wei, to see whether her family still had so much affection to her that she might apply to them for clothing and food. She talked so clearly and so cleverly, and behaved so charmingly, that Wang Shen made her stay in his house and gave her food ; his wife too loved her more and more. They then said to her in the course of conversation : — Sister, you have no nearest kinsfolk, cannot you become here a bride of our son ? Smilingly she answered : « As I have nobody to depend upon, I desire to do your coarse work and attend to your well and kitchen. So Wang Shen procured the wedding clothes and presents, and she became his son’s wife. It was hot that night ;"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 277 — There are many thieves just now, laid she to her husband, do not leave the door open. At midnight Wang Shen’s wife dreamt that her son with disordered hair told her that he was being devoured almost entirely. The affrighted woman desired to go and look at her son, but Wang Shen became angry, and she laid herself down again to sleep. But a second time she had the same dream. Now both took torches and called the son and his bride, but no answer was given. They tried to open the door, but it remained fast as if it were bolted, so that they had to batter it down. When it flew open, a being with round eyes, tusks and a bluish body rushed out of it and disappeared. Nothing was left of their son but some brains, bones, and hair (401). That entire hosts of anthropophagous spectres, preying especially upon babies and hearts of men, have in A. D. 781 set whole regions into commotion and panic, we have had occasion to note on page 477. We read, moreover, in the Standard Histories of the Sung dynasty, that « there suddenly appeared in the Süen hwo period (1119-1126), in the demesnes of Loh-yang-fu, certain beings resembling men, squatting down sometimes like dogs. They were of a deep black colour, and their eyebrows and eyes were not clearly visible. In the beginning they seized babies at night and devoured them, p.765 and later on they invaded the dwellings by broad daylight, to work mischief. Wherever they appeared, cries and clamour arose, and quiet was destroyed. They were called ‘black folks’. Strong men armed themselves at night with spears and clubs for self-defence ; some made use of the panic for mischievous purposes, and two years elapsed ere it came to an end (402). The existence of cannibals in the demon-world being thus placed beyond all doubt by authoritative books, we cannot but infer that tales about such beings must circulate in great numbers throughout the Empire. Traditions mention e. g. so-called land-monks, counterparts, probably, of the sea-monks of which we have spoken on page 533 ; they emerge from time to time from"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 278 rivers and creeks, especially during inundations, to attack the lonely and the weak and devour their brains. But still more debased than any anthropophagi in the world of spectres are those which push their craving for human flesh to the extent of preying on corpses. The belief in such disgusting demons is evidently old, for we saw (p. 536) that in traditions written down not long after the commencement of the Christian era, goat-shaped ground-demons were represented as devouring the dead in their graves. Evidence for the prevalence, in times long past, of the belief in necrophagous demons is brought before us by the following text : « In the Nan-khang district, one Khü King-chi, established in a military station, was travelling in the first year of the Yuen kia period of the Sung dynasty (A. D. 424), in the company of his son, in a canoe from the district city up the stream to one of its remote sources. The banks were dreary and wild, and extremely steep, and no human foot had ever been planted there. In the evening father and son landed and put up in a shed, where King-chi was ‘struck by evil’, and died suddenly. His son lit a fire and watched the corpse. Suddenly he heard in the distance cries of ‘uncle !’ uttered in a wailing tone. The filial son started, and was asking p.766 himself what this might be, when in a twinkling quicker than a nod the being that wailed appeared on the spot. It had the size of a man, and its hair hung down to its feet, covering also the greater part of its face, so that its seven apertures could not be seen. It mentioned its names to the son and condoled with him, but he remained nervous and affrighted, attended to the fuel, and kept the fire flaming well. The being, speaking of the past and the future, condoled with the dead, asserting that he had nothing to fear ; and in a moment as the son was attending to the fire, it seated itself beside the head of the corpse, and wailed. By the light of the fire the mourning son watched all its movements, and saw that the monster, bending over the dead man’s face, set immediately to tearing off the skin, laying the bones quite bare. Terror-stricken, he decided to attack it, but he had no weapons, and next moment there remained of his father’s corpse no more"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 279 than a white skeleton, stripped of skin and flesh. It was never discovered to what sort or class this kwei or shen belonged (403). Seeing that spirits are believed by the Chinese to feed on sacrificial food without this changing in the least or diminishing in quantity, we cannot reasonably feel astonished that they are deemed able also to devour corpses without these bearing thereafter the traces of it. « When Chang Han was young, he was a man of resolution and spirit, conversant in Ch‘ang-ngan with brave, straightforward people. He had a beloved concubine. Han always made her happy, but p.767 too soon a case of death called him away to one of the districts adjoining the city. Several months elapsed before he could return, just to find her carried off by disease. Deeply he bewailed her loss. The sun meanwhile set, so that he had to lodge in her dwelling for that night. She was not yet buried, but her encoffined corpse had been put away behind in the hall. There was no other apartment, but, asked he, can death cause a separation as long as love cherished in life exists ? — and he laid himself down under a muslin curtain. After midnight the moon shone brightly in the courtyard, while Han lay sleepless, sobbing and sighing. Suddenly he discovered a being between the gate and the screen in front of it. Putting out its head from behind the screen it peeped round ; then it came forth and shrank back again, subsequently moving around the screen, and appearing midway in the courtyard. It was upward of one chang in size, with trousers of leopard’s skin, teeth like a saw, and hair flowing down disorderly. Three other spectres appeared successively, hopping about in the moon-shine, with red cords trailing behind. — What about that honourable man there on the couch ? they asked. — He is asleep, they said,"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 280 and with these words they ascended the steps, and entered the place where the coffin stood. Breaking away the things placed around and over it, they bore it into the moonshine, broke it open, and seized the corpse, which they dismembered, cut into pieces, and sitting down in a circle, devoured. The blood streamed in the courtyard, and the clothes of the corpse lay disorderly on the floor. p.768 The horrified Han was pained at the sight. Just now, he said to himself, they called me a honourable man ; so if I attack them, nothing bad, to be sure, will befall on me. A bamboo pole, which he saw outside the curtain, he seized silently, and he rushed out against the demons from the dark, showering blows upon them with loud yells. In a deadly fright the devils took to their heels, on which Han, taking advantage of his success, pursued them closely, till they disappeared over the wall at the north-west corner. One of the demons, however, slower than the rest, was unable to scale that obstacle, and did not make its escape before receiving a blow which drew blood from its body. Alarmed by the tumult, the inmates of the house leapt from their beds to the rescue. Han related to them everything, and they determined to re-coffin the remains of the skeleton ; but when they reached the place in the hall where the coffin had been put away, they found there everything in its old condition, nor did they see anything in the spot where the repast was held. Han in his confusion was inclined to regard it all as a bad dream, but for the blood they saw on the wall, and the footprints on the top of it, which nobody remembered to have observed there before. A few years afterwards, Han obtained a position in the service of the state (404). @ "},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 281 CHAPTER XII Apparitions at Death @ p.769 Again we must remind our readers for a moment of the belief, field generally by the Chinese people from the earliest times, in the possibility of the revival of the dead, which is the principal source of so vast a mass of ideas and usages connected with the disposal of the dead, as we have tried to depict in our First Book. This belief naturally causes everybody to admit, that the re-animation of the body by the soul’s return will take place soon after the demise, ere decomposition shows that the soul has abandoned the corpse and the house. And ever living in constant fear of spectres, the Chinese must await that return with anxiety, for what guarantee is there that the departed soul has not in the mean time become a malicious ghost, as so many spirits are ? Thus we may admit the prevalence of a dread of re-animation of the dead among the Chinese race from its early prime. However, we find no mention made of it in books older than the sixth century. Yen Chi-t’ui then wrote in his Domestic Instructions : « Books not standing on a par (with the classical) make mention of shah returning to the house after death. Sons and grand-sons then flee and hide themselves, and all refuse to stay at home, and they decorate the tiles with written charms, performing sundry practices to suppress the evil. And on the day on which the funeral train sets out, they make a fire before the gate, placing also glowing coals outside the doors, in order to exorcise and avert that domestic ghost (405). That word shah ( or ), denoting such new ghosts, means ‘murderous, killing’ (comp. page 683), which sufficiently attests p.770 their dangerous character. A book of the ninth century of our era describes them as bird-shaped."},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 282 « It is a popular tradition that some days after the death of a man, a bird or so-called shah must come out of his coffin. In the Yuen hwo period (806-820) one Ching was catching animals in the plains of Sih-cheu (Shansi pr.), in company with some officers of that department, and caught in a net a large bird of a blue colour, over five feet high. Scarcely had he given orders to take it out of the net and show it to him, when it disappeared from sight. Affrighted, he immediately inquired of the people of the hamlet, and he got this answer from one of them : — In our village a man has died some days ago, and the diviner has said that his shah would depart to-day ; his family have kept watch to see it, and a big blue bird has flown out of the coffin ; can this be the bird you have caught ? In the T‘ien pao period (742-756), Ts‘ui Kwang-yuen, the Governor of the Metropolis, while hunting, fell in with a spectral bird, and the same thing happened as sketched above (406). A tsin-shi graduate of Ching-cheu (in Honan pr.), named Ts‘ui Szĕ-fuh, spent a night in the Dharma-hall of a Buddhist temple, and was just falling asleep, when on a sudden a voice cried to him. In terror he rose, and saw that it was that of a beast like a crane, bluish black, with eyes glaring like lamps ; it flapped its wings, and loudly cried with a shrill voice. Szĕ-fuh was so frightened that he fled into the side-gallery, whereupon it stopped crying. The next day he spoke with the priests about the incident, who said : — There have never been here any apparitions of the kind, but ten days ago a number of coffins with corpses were deposited in the hall ; it may have come thence. Szĕ-fuh, coming to the capital, related the incident to a Buddhist priest, named Khai-pao. — The matter is mentioned in the Sutras of the Pitaka, p.771 said this man ; that bird was a metamorphosis of the breath of the"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol.

In a work the preface of which is dated 1250 we find the following interesting lines, which show that the fear of the soul’s return to the house of death was connected in the age of the Sung dynasty with various superstitious ideas and usages : « According to Chao Tung-shan from Yueh (Chehkiang), Hi Fen lost his father, the Governor of Hwui-ki, in the year keng-suh of the Shun yiu period (A. D. 1250). Three memorable things took place at the funeral : they did not run away on account of the shah ; they employed no Buddhist or Taoist clergymen ; they did not credit the Yin and Yang (fung-shui). It is unknown to me when mention is for the first time made of such running away from the shah. On the hundredth day after the demise of Lü Ts’ai (see Book I, p. 1006), a doctor in the Court of Sacrificial Worship under the T‘ang dynasty, as also at the end of one year, his shah wrought harm. Such shah do so in this manner : — say a case of death occurs on a szĕ day, then, if the shah is a male one, it returns on the forty-seventh day to kill a girl of thirteen or fourteen ; and if it is a female shah, this comes from the south and kills a pale boy in the third house. Among members of the tribes named Ching, Pan, Sun, and Ch‘en, the shah comes twice to the house of death, to wit, on the twenty-fourth day and on the twenty-ninth ; for which reason those people warn each other to run away in time. From inns the dead are carried out for burial on the very day of their demise, for then whither will their shah return ? In the Metropolis too the things are upset in the house, and the inmates run out of it. Chao Tung-shan says : — But how is it possible that there should be people who, when engaged on the mourning rites for their p.772 parents, are at the same time anxious to preserve their bodies safe and sound from danger, and for that purpose leave the coffin alone, shut within an empty house ?

Heu Tien mentions the following incident in his Sî ts‘iao yé ki 3 : My fellow-villager Ku Kang having died, his shah came back to the house. This occurred in the night. Incense, paper money, meat and dainties had been placed by his wife on the table of the soul ; they had hung the apartment with ornamental curtains and closed the door, and concealed themselves in the adjacent houses, with the exception of one old woman, whom they left behind alone to guard the dwelling. This woman then saw a beast in the shape of a monkey and of the size of a dog, leaning over the table to devour the meat. On perceiving her it dealt her a hail of blows, until her cries and yells brought the family to her rescue, who, however, saw nothing at all.  1 Ch‘ui kien luh wai tsih, some sixty leaves of desultory notices and critical disquisitions on matters and events of all times, moderately esteemed by scholars.

The second name of this productive author, who lived from 1123 to 1203, was King-lu. Yung-chai, or Spacious Closet, is, I think, an epithet derived from his study, or from the place where he lived. We find this epithet in the title of another work from his hand, from which we have sometimes borrowed material, viz. the Yung-chai pih or Productions of Yung-chai’s Writing-brush, consisting of five collections of critical notes on a great variety of literary and historical subjects. 3 Writings from the Fields at the Western Tower, four chapters of tales from the Ming dynasty."},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 285 In his treatise on living shah of the male and female gender, Ch’u Yung 1 says : When some one dies on such-and-such a day, he undergoes the shah influences of such-and-such an other day. According to the books on Yin and Yang philosophy, there exist female and male shah, which either leave the corpse, or do not leave it ; but such talk seems to deserve no credit. If the female shah does not quit the corpse, the right foot turns towards the left, and if the male shah does not go out of it, the left foot moves towards the right side ; when none of these shah quit the corpse, the feet will move towards each other, and when both the shah leave it, they do not bend, but take an outward direction (408). p.774 The belief that the souls of the dead may haunt their own homes as dangerous shah, is, of course, hard to reconcile with another belief which pervades the Chinese mind at least as thoroughly, namely that those souls are not the enemies of their kinspeople, but their natural protectors, their domestic patron divinities. We have seen that a Chinese author has expressed surprise at this inconsistency. That dread may be old, for it may have been the cause of the ancient custom that rulers should provide themselves with an escort of exorcists armed with evil-dispelling instruments (Book I, p. 36 and 41). It is, no doubt, the same fear which makes the people in Amoy to this day firmly believe that dangerous influences infect all who visit houses of death (Book I, p. 32 and 108) or meet with a burial procession (Book I, p. 206), so that they should have recourse to certain cleansing-ceremonies as mentioned on pp. 32, 33, 137 and 231. The dangers from a return of the dead are enhanced considerably by the circumstance, that very often they appear in the company of devils in whose power they are. On several pages of our description of customs connected with deaths we have had to mention a belief that man, on departing from this world, falls into the hands of malicious demons 2 ; and very natural it is that such a belief should exists for how could man, after a life beset by spectres on all sides, possibly expect to be free from their insidious attacks when he  1 Also named Wen-khing, living in the age of Sung. 2 See the Index of Book I, Spirits."},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol.

When upward of thirty years old he fell ill, and expired. On his being coffined, his wife could not find it in her heart to have the lid nailed down ; daily she wept from morning to evening, and then lifted up the lid, to gaze on him. Of old, when any one among the people died, his shah was expected on the seventh day. All, even the nearest relations, fled, except the wife, who would not ; she concealed her children in another p.775 room, and sat down within the bed-curtains of the deceased, to await him. At the second watch-drum a blast of cold wind rose ; the lamp-lights became green, and she saw a devil with red hair and circular eyes. Its height was upward of a chang ; in its hands it held an iron fork, and with a rope it hauled the husband through the window into the room. But as soon as it saw the sacrificial wine and the dainties arranged before the coffin, it dropped the trident and the rope, and sat down by the food to devour it by large mouthfuls, a clicking noise sounding in its belly at each bite. Meanwhile the husband walked round, touching and stroking his chairs and tables with signs of great distress and deep sighs, finally running to the bed and raising the curtain. His wife burst into wailing and clasped him in her arms, but she became cold, as if a condensed chilly cloud followed him and enveloped her. The red-haired demon tried to drag him away from her by the rope, which made her cry so loudly that her sons and daughters ran to the rescue. The red-haired devil ran away, and with the help of her children she placed the soul, clinging around her, in the coffin, with the result that the corpse began to breathe. Then she clasped her goodman in her arms, placed him on the bed, and gave him rice-gruel to drink ; he came round at daybreak. The iron trident which the spectre had left behind, was of paper, as those which the people are wont to burn for spirits. p.776 "},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol.

The wife, who was then sixty, was once praying in the temple of the God of the Walls and Moats, and vaguely saw two bowmen carrying a criminal with a cangue round his neck. On looking more closely, she recognized in the cangue-wearer the red-haired devil. With a curse it exclaimed : — It was my gluttony that allowed you to play that trick on me which caused me to be punished with the cangue for twenty years ; shall I now that I fall in with you let you escape ? The woman went home, and died (409). Another tale in the same work informs us, that the demons accompanying returning shah are believed to be lictors or menials of the governors and chiefs of the world of spirits, who administer justice there. « Everywhere among the people, when anybody dies, they place in the fourteenth evening the clothes and coverlets of the dead beside the coffin, and the whole family hide themselves, I pretending that the soul then comes to rejoin the corpse. They call it the returning shah. The hero of the tale awaits the ghost, which is that of his wife, and asks her : — I have heard people say, that when any one dies, spectres performing the functions of lictors arrest him and bind him, so that the returning shah is accompanied by shah spirits ; how have you managed to come back alone ? On which P‘eng, the ghost, answers : — Such shah spirits are spectres acting as lictors charged with such arrests ; guilty people are drawn along by them with a rope round their necks ; but the chief of the nether world declared me guiltless ; and as I had not broken the old ties that connect me with you, he allowed me to return home alone. p.777 In the Journal of the Peking Oriental Society for 1898 (vol.

The shah khi, says he, ‘the murderous breath or soul’, may have one of the five colours. It destroys the happiness of those who meet it. It always escapes from the corpse at night, on the first, second or third day after death, or even later ; expert soothsayers inform the family of the exact date. The family then hide themselves, after having set out a sacrifice of spirits and eatables in the room, to which in the case of a woman a comb and a mirror are added. The departure of the shah betrays itself by a slight noise hardly perceptible ; after it has taken place, the family re-appear from their hiding-places. The author then gives us the tale of a thief, who wanted to take advantage of this absence of a family in order to rob them, and, dressed with a sheepskin to look like a hairy devil, with dishevelled hair and his face painted red, stole into the house. But one of the inmates had stayed in the room to look to the lamps. On beholding the spectre, he concealed himself under the coffin, and seeing it break open everything and make off with the loot, drew his white mourning gown over his head, and sprang at it from under the coffin. The trick was a perfect success : the horrified burglar, believing that he saw the real shah, sank to the ground unconscious. @ "},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 289 CHAPTER XIII Black Calamities @ p.778 Catastrophes in general, caused by spectres, are, as we have remarked before (pp. 468 seq.), denoted by the words sheng, and a special class of them are so-called hoh sheng or ‘black calamities’. In the Books of the Early Han Dynasty we read : « The colour of Wood is blue ; therefore there exist blue sheng, and blue siang (410) or felicities. We know that the element Wood and the colour blue are assimilated with the east and the spring ; accordingly, proceeding with this line of reasoning, there are sheng and siang distinguished by the five principal colours, and assimilated with the elements, the cardinal points, and the seasons, in the sense indicated on page 317 of Book I. Sheng and siang, thus distinguished into five sorts, are, in fact, mentioned in the Books of the Han Dynasty in the same chapter from which we have quoted the above passage, and also in the literature of subsequent periods. They are stated in some Official Histories to have shown themselves in different ways and shapes, but mostly as vapours or clouds of certain degrees of density, which later on proved to have been prognostics of happy events or great catastrophes for the dynasty or the people. The black sheng have especially occupied attention as spectres of a very nefarious and terrible character ; which is rational, whereas black is the colour of darkness or the Yin, to which spectres belong. We find them mentioned e. g. in the Standard Histories of the Sung dynasty : « In the last year of the Yuen fung period (A. D. 1085) there used to be a being as large as a mat, which appeared at night in the halls at the back (of the Palace), and thereupon the p.779 emperor Shen Tsung died. In the last year of the Yuen fu period (A. D. 1100) it again appeared several times, after which Cheh Tsung"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 290 departed this life. Then until the Ta kwan period it was now and then seen in the daytime, but in the first year of the Ching hwo period (A. D. 1111) and thereafter it appeared with more frequency. It came forth whenever it heard men speak, preceded by a noise as if a row of houses were being pushed down. It was nearly one chang in height, resembled a tortoise with eyes of gold, and made a grating noise when it moved. A black vapour envelopped it, which descended over everybody, and whatever it touched was sprinkled all over with rancid blood. Neither weapons nor swords could be used against it. Sometimes it changed into a man, sometimes it was a donkey. It appeared day and night, from the spring throughout the summer, and was met with at all times, but during that winter it was seldom seen. It was mostly in the side-courts, where the palace-servants dwelled, but it also came to the inner halls ; afterwards they got accustomed to it and considered it as an everyday matter, so that it no longer inspired much fear. Thereupon, in the last year of the Süen hwo period (A. D. 1125), it kept quiet and rarely appeared, but then the rebellion broke out (411) which put an end to the dominion of the house of Sung in the north. And in the third year of the Ching hwo period (A. D. 1113), at the summer solstice, the Minister Ho Tsih-chung offered the Imperial sacrifice (to the Earth) in the northern suburb, when a black vapour, several chang in length, issued from the fasting-apartment, and having moved forward for about a mile, entered the walled altar-ground, and whirled around the sacrificial place. Then, quite close to the men, it passed between the lights and p.780 torches, but on a sudden it neared the altar a second time, and disappeared when the ceremonies drew to an end (412). The dog-shaped black devils, which, as we have seen on page 764, raged between the years 1119 and 1126 in and about Loh-yang, even devouring babies, evidently were Black Calamities. Also under the Ming dynasty these spectres manifested themselves with frequency ; name thirty cases are"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 291 recorded in two folios specially devoted to the subject in the Official Histories of that house. Those folios teach us, that they appeared as black or grey vapours, or as rains of sand, ink, or black peas. Never, it seems, did they rage so tremendously as in 1476 : « In the twelfth year of the Ch‘ing hwa period, in the seventh month, on the day keng-suh, Black Calamities appeared in the western city or ward of the Metropolis. They came forth at night and wounded men. The Inspecting Censor of that ward reported it to the emperor, who commanded that measures should be taken to catch them, and warned the people not to communicate their apprehensions to others (and thereby create panics). The Grand Secretary of State, Shang Loh, because of these apparitions of Black Calamities drew up eight points by which to appease them, and the emperor accepted these with satisfaction. Those eight points, discussed by Shang Loh, were the following : the master of the realm of the Tibetan priesthood (Dalai-Lama) should not be given a patent a second time. Except the customary tribute from the four quarters of the world, no valuables should be accepted by the Throne. People of every class and rank should be allowed to report the truth personally to the authorities. Emissaries from the Boards should be sent out to examine the cases of prisoners, in order that justice might be done to the wronged and oppressed. Building-works should be suspended or delayed. The provisioning of the armies on the three frontiers should be completed. The passes on the frontiers should be put in a state of defence. A special Governor should be appointed for Yunnan province (413). p.781 This episode, for the historical truth of which the Official Histories of the Ming dynasty are a guarantee (414), is interesting, because it shows how spectrophoby may in China impose upon emperors the introduction of important political measures and improvements of the system of government. But we should bear in mind, that in China spectres are retributive agents of Heaven. How deeply that panic affected the nerves of the official world in Peking, may be seen from the fact, likewise duly recorded in the Official Histories, that"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 292 « when on the day keng-suh, in the seventh month, the Black Calamities had appeared, the emperor on the day yih-ch‘eu (fifteen days later) personally offered prayers to Heaven and Earth within the Forbidden Palace, confessing himself guilty of the four following sins : his measures were not moderate ; the services imposed upon his subjects for government works weighed too heavily upon them ; the faithful and loyal were not listened to ; no benevolent government was administered. On the day wu-ch‘en (three days later) he sent out envoys to examine the cases of prisoners throughout the empire (415). We are not told whether these measures, this self-humiliation and self-imputation induced the Universe to call its spectres back, but still the Standard Histories give us the following particulars : « If men and women among the people slept uncovered (because of the heat), a being with gold eyeballs and a long tail, shaped like a dog or a fox, with a black vapour on its back, entered the windows, and straightway proceeded to the private rooms. p.782 When it came, uproar arose among the people, and the ward all around fell into a panic and alarm. They drew their swords, set out lights, beat on gongs and drums, and chased it without succeeding in catching it. Once while the emperor held his audience at the Fung-t‘ien gate, his body-guards perceived it and began to cry ; the emperor then would rise with benevolent intent, but it grasped his gown for a moment, and then kept quiet (416). Another author writes, that in such nocturnal attacks on sleeping people, « these incurred wounds in their hands and feet, cheeks, bellies or backs, from which a yellow fluid matter came forth . . . . . . . They became aware of those wounds when they awoke, for the wounds did not ache very much . . . . . .

V 293 proofs, and reported to the Throne ; they declared that they did not know by what beings their wounds were inflicted ; many who had seen them, had told him they were black and had small, gold eyeballs, long tails, and the shape of a dog or fox ; there had been no less than twenty specimens. They did not stop their work until another ten days had elapsed (417). Black Calamities inflicting wounds and even killing men are p.783 stated to have appeared in the year 1512 in Shun-teh and Ho-kien, which are parts of Chihli province ; they varied in size and shape between a cat and a dog, and soon appeared in Peking, red and black, as also in Fung-khiu, in Honan province (418). Some particulars about their appearance in 1557 in Hung-cheu we have given on page 482. In 1572 they showed themselves in Hang-cheu, in the province of Chehkiang, in a black fog, as serpentine beings rolling like car-wheels, with eyes like lightning, and were followed by frost and hail. From many other references we only note that they sometimes threw tiles and stones ; in 1558, in Heng-yang, in Hunan, « they placed themselves as nightmare spectres upon women, so that blood streamed out of their mouths immediately, with fatal consequences (419) ; in Shansi, in the district of P‘u, there appeared one in 1600 in the shape of a large hairy barrel, which came down from a willow tree and disappeared (420). With all these written data before us, we cannot wonder that the belief in Black Calamities flourishes in China at the present day. Some popular ideas about them are sketched by Sui Yuen. « People in Chu-ch‘ing (in Shantung pr.) say, that in their country there are in a village of the Yin family, outside the city, many old graves, in which, according to old tradition, a spectre dwelled, whose shape was that of a man, and whose face did not consist of solid substance, but was a condensation of blackish vapour. It was more than a chang in height, and frequently come forth at night, hiding itself during the day. When that being was out and met a man on the road, then, when at the distance of a bowshot, it suddenly whistled like a lightning flash, so that the man felt his"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 294 heart palpitate and his courage drop ; but he who saw and heared it did not know what it was, for as soon as it had whistled it placed a black vapour between itself and that man, and when its rank and filthy stench struck his olfactory nerves, that vapour vanished. The villagers were wont to warn each other p.784 against that road, which they thought ought to be shunned, and therefore was unfrequented as long as darkness lasted. A salt-peddler X, dealing in salt there, a greedy wine-bibber, had in his drunkenness forgotten the warning, and by mistake turned down that road. The moon had already been above the horizon for two watch-drums, when in front of him the spectre suddenly sprang forth and obstructed the road, loudly whistling. X beat it with his carrying-pole, but this seemed not to hit or hurt anything ; his fright then became intense ; not knowing how otherwise to help himself, he hastily grasped some of his salt and threw it at the spectre, and lo, this moved round about him for a time, recoiled and shrank, and sank into the ground. The saltman then threw all the salt he had in his baskets over the spot where it had disappeared, and went away. When it was light, he retraced his steps, and saw that the salt which he had thrown out in one heap on the ground had become quite red, and emitted a rancid and filthy stencil hardly bearable, and that there were blood-drops beside it on the ground. After this event the apparition occurred no more (421). Evidently then such tremendous spectres are destroyed by salt, dissolved by it like snails ; and salt may therefore be deemed by many in China a mighty means of defence against spectres. @ "},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 295 CHAPTER XIV Additional Particulars @ p.785 There have undoubtedly existed in China classes of spectres occupying a large place in popular superstition, but the remembrance of which has passed away. There may also exist to this day many kinds haunting only certain parts of the realm, so that particulars about them can only be gathered orally on the spot, and cannot be found in books. There may, in short, remain much to tell of spectres of which we know as yet nothing, not even the denominations, or nothing more than the names. This is the case with the lai and the ch‘eng-ch‘eng, mentioned respectively on page 473 and page 574. Indefinable spectres are frequently mentioned in books as invisible openers of doors and windows, as makers of mysterious noises, as throwers of tiles and various missiles, and as beings responsible for naughty tricks and mischief not assigned to human agency. Such spectres have been invented by imagination in infinite numbers at all times, keeping men’s minds in continual anxiety, until new generations created new kinds eclipsing the old. Many, saved from oblivion by the pens of authors, to this day cause Chinese blood to run cold, and their deeds being read, told, and retold, maintain or steadily develop superstitious spectrophoby. To there spectres belong the specimens of which the following tales are related : « The Buddhist monk Fah-ch‘ang, of a convent at Lung-men, in Hunan, was a man from Yuen-wu in the Ching department. In the Pan lih period (825 or 826) he returned from Lung-men to Yuen-wu. His family possessed there some acres of ground, where the corn stood ripe, but still uncut. One evening he rode into the fields, when on a sudden his horse stood stock still and refused to advance ; he applied the whip, but the animal did not move for all that, and stared eastward as if it perceived p.786 something there. In the bright moonlight the monk then saw in that direction, some"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 296 hundred paces off, a being resembling a rotten tree, which approached resolutely. He was seized by fright, immediately turned his horse, and the animal galopped away from the road for some dozens of paces, whence he watched the being slowly approach, six or seven feet high, emitting a stench extremely rancid and filthy, worse than a salt-fish shop. With a soft panting noise it moved on in a westerly direction ; Fah-ch‘ang gave his horse the whip and rode on behind, keeping at a distance of some dozens of paces. When they had thus gone about one mile, they came to the house of the villager Wang, into which the being slunk. Fah-ch‘ang halted his horse and watched. After a while he heard some one in the house exclaim : — The cow in the mill-house is dying, come and see ! and after a further interval he heard a cry : — The donkey in the out-house is sinking to the ground, quite helpless ; then again he heard wails of fright, and seeing somebody rush out of the house, asked what the matter was. — The son of the house-owner, about ten years old, is suddenly dying, said this man, and no sooner were these words from his lips than Fah-ch’ang heard the lamentations again, with a series of exclamations of terror ; and this went on till after midnight, when the sounds diminished, until at dawn they entirely died away. Fah-ch‘ang, frightened and astonished, immediately warned the neighbours. Together they came up to Wang’s dwelling and inspected it closely ; the deepest silence reigned there and no sound was heard ; they opened the door, and found all the inmates, more than ten in number, dead ; even of the fowls and dogs not one was alive (422). p.787 "},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 297 « In the Süen hwo period (1119-1126), a military officer of Shensi became an inspector in a part of the province of King-tung. More than a year after he had assumed office he suddenly saw behind the partition a big, blue-faced spectre, whose head, though its owner was squatting down, still reached as high as a roof on pillars. The man of the sword, brave, bold, fearless, took his bow and shot an arrow into its belly ; the spectre laughingly said : — Got it ! and on a second shot it exclaimed : — Good shot ! Twenty arrows thus successively were discharged, sticking into its body like porcupine-quills, and then the spectre lay dead and motionless. At this juncture, two small spectres carried the mother of the inspector out of the room. Lest he might hurt or kill her, he threw his bow and arrows aside, and, to deliver her, called his sons, slaves and concubines to the rescue, but not one of them gave an answer. Therefore he went back to look into the house, and saw all the inmates dead, their bodies in a heap on the ground, and in each body one of the arrows he had shot. Of twenty persons, young and old, only he and his mother were left. As soon as his fright and sorrow were somewhat abated, his underlings hurried to the prefect to report the news, and this magistrate sent his deputies to see what had happened ; and they all stood aghast, and could devise nothing better than to buy coffins and put the bodies into these. The night passed away and he p.788 was about to carry the coffins away for burial, when he happened to open a side-room to fetch something, and — saw there the whole family seated, not dead at all, but as if in a dreamy doze. He told them the whole incident, but they understood nothing of it. Then he opened the coffins, and found therein ordure-baskets, brooms, barrels, ladles, and the like. They quickly removed to another place, and left that dwelling unoccupied (423)."},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 298 Indeed, the malignity and effrontery of demons are boundless, so as even to impel them beyond the limits of decency with respect to the fair. ‘Dreams of intercourse with spectres’ are, in fact, mentioned regularly in medical works among the symptoms of female diseases, thus pointing to a great frequency and a generality of such visions, which, as all dreams of spirits, pass for actual apparitions. Authors discoursing with the usual Chinese subtlety on such female hallucination, generally ascribe it, like most forms of mental derangement, to a diffusion of the influences of the blood. The blood being identified with the shen, the diffusion of its influences must needs cause the shen to loosen its hold on the body, the viscera, and the other principal internal organs, and to leave them partly or entirely, thus affording ample opportunity to the sié to nestle in those organs in its stead. The patient indulges then in obstinate taciturnity or soliloquy ; she has hysterical laughing and wailing fits with alternate acceleration and abatement of her pulses — altogether symptoms of sui or demonry. p.789 Another symptom of such hysterical derangement is fear of men. It victimizes especially widows and nuns, and no doubt also affects old maids, but these are rather rarities in the Empire. In many cases the matter results in ‘demoniacal pregnancy’, a real bugbear of superstitious petticoats. A gynecologist of the thirteenth century of our era wrote : « If a lady’s viscera and chief vitals are in harmony mutually, the influences of her blood are abundant and compact, and her vital spirits are so solid and flourishing that neither the sié of winds, nor evil spirits can hurt her. But if the influences of her blood are void and impaired, her vital spirits will suffer of debility and weakness, and spectres of whatever kind will occupy her person. If they enter her viscera, the woman seems to be in the family way, which is a condition called demoniacal pregnancy 1.  1 Fu jen to ts‘üen liang fang, Large and Complete Collection of efficacious Recipes for married Women, art.

V 299 Not all authors, however, are so convinced of demonish fecundation in cases of apparent pregnancy. In an authoritative work of the sixteenth century we read the following lines : « The question is put sometimes what demoniacal pregnancy is. The answer is as follows : Things thought of in the daytime become visions in the night, and so it is a rule that, if men and women be of lewd disposition, idle, and unoccupied, the fire in their liver and their kidneys flames up at any moment, with the result that, if they are timorous, they dream frequently of intercourse with spectres. So demoniacal pregnancy is unreal pregnancy, by no means a pregnancy produced by actual fecundation by spectres. An ancient recipe says : Where lewd thoughts are boundless, wishes (for children) remain unfulfilled. It is white fluid of lewdness and white foul liquid which, flowing in the uterus, curdle therein and make such pregnancy ; it is the blood of the woman herself and her semen which curdle and form a lump p.790 that puffs up her breast and her abdomen, and filling these, makes her look as if she were in the family way. But if it proves to be no unreal pregnancy, what then have we to think of it ? Well, in Hwah Poh-jen’s work, entitled The Efficacy of Medicines, I have found the following lines : In the temple of Benevolence and Filial Respect the only daughter of the Invoker attached to the building, named Yang T‘ien-ch‘ing, strolled through the side-gallery in the dim shadows of evening, and saw a spirit in yellow dress. She experienced an agitation of feeling, and that same night she dreamed that she had sexual commerce with that spirit. Her abdomen distended, and she had all the symptoms of being in the family way, when Poh-jen was asked to treat her. He examined her, and said : ‘this is a case of demoniacal pregnancy’, and her mother having related to him all about the cause of it, he cured her by causing her to evacuate by means of blood-breaking and abortive drugs more than two pints of tadpoles, porwiggles, and fish-eyes.

Ah, no ghost seduced by a woman was in question here, but a woman bewildered by a ghost. My opinion is, that that girl, advanced in years and yet without a mate, was one of those of whom we might say : where lewd thoughts have no bounds, wishes (for children) remain unfulfilled. Scholars imbued with correct principles, beware of believing in the errors of such heterodox stories 1 ! p.791 Thus Yü Poh, who wrote those lines, seems to ascribe demoniacal pregnancy to an abnormal stagnation of menstruation. Medical authors may often subscribe to this opinion, yet we regularly find in their long lists of recipes against the evil certain mysterious ‘spectre beheading medicine’ — a strong evidence that leechcraft in China is still very far from having disentangled itself from the old and common belief that demons cause such pregnancies, and that means to expel them or to scare them away from women they have fecundated, may prove efficacious. Thus far for the wisdom displayed on the subject by China’s medical men. Naturally the unlearned show still less readiness to disbelieve the reality of clandestine intercourse of spectres with men. That animal-demons and plant-devils often commit such sins, we have seen from many instances in our chapters on those beings ; we have also seen (pp. 603 and 605) that women copulating with animal-demons have produced children. Many stories relating to such commerce are abroad, and traceable in books. Thus we read, that « one T‘an Sheng of the Han dynasty was forty years old, and always nervous, having no wife. Engaged in reading the Shi king, he sat up till past midnight, when a girl of fifteen or sixteen, with a countenance so attractive and clothes so nice, that the world had  1 I hioh ching ch‘wen, Correct Traditions on Medicine, art.

They became husband and wife, and p.792 she bore him a child, but when two years had passed away, the goodman could not repress his curiosity any longer. The night came, and waiting till she was asleep, he stole to her with a light, and saw that everything above her waist was flesh like a human being, but that her lower parts were mere dry bones. At this moment the woman awoke from her sleep. — You had no regard for me, she said ; I had descended into life ; why, instead of suppressing your impatience for one year more, did you throw light upon me ? Sheng apologized with a flood of tears, which he could not restrain, while she went on to say : — We have lived together so long with the strictest observance of duty, but now we must separate for ever. Our baby occupies my mind ; were you to become poor, it would not be able to live ; come with me for some moments, I have something for you. And he accompanied her into a decorated hall, with rooms and apartments the furniture of which was not that of this life. Here she handed to him a gown stitched with pearls, with the words : — It may serve you for your sustenance ; then tearing a lapel from his robe, she left him alone, and vanished. Afterwards Sheng took the gown to the bazaar, where one of the family of the prince of Tsü-yang bought it from him for ten million coins. The prince recognized it ; — This is my daughter’s gown, he said, how could it be found in the bazaar ? to be sure, that man has exhumed her body."},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol.

He went to the grave, and found it in its former good condition ; he opened it, and saw a lapel of a robe under the coffin lid ; he called the child, and saw that it bore a close resemblance to his daughter. Now he believed everything. He called T‘an Sheng, gave him back the gown, and adopted him as his son-in-law, bestowing upon the child the title of Intendant of his Gate and Doors (424). p.793 After all, we cannot help feeling astonished at having found nothing in Chinese books which points to an ascription of monstrous births to impregnation of the mothers by spectres. It seems however a fact, that monsters are called spectres ; we have seen an instance hereof on page 520. It is recounted in the Tszĕ puh yü, that « Ching Joh-shi, a lowest rank literary graduate in Shao-hing, was presented by his wife, a woman of the Wei family, with a yaksha, blue over its whole body, with a wide mouth gaping upward ; its eyes were round, its nose contracted, its mouth pointed, and its hair red ; moreover it had cock-spurs and horse-hoofs. On falling out of the vagina it bit the midwife in her finger. The graduate was so affrighted that he seized a knife to kill it, and the yaksha made gestures to defend itself for some time before it expired. Its blood was quite blue. The mother died with fright (425). Spectres do not visit men exclusively to satisfy their sexual lust, but also because of their appetite for food. Indeed, no spirits, including the ghosts of the dead, can subsist without eating and drinking, or without clothing and money ; they therefore are always p.794 abroad in search of food and drink, generally hungry and thirsty, or even in a state of semi-starvation. We might expect to find them simply represented as satiating themselves furtively and quietly with the food of men, even without the latter perceiving it, since ghosts merely consume invisible ethereal parts of food ; yet the common opinion is, that they do not touch any eatables or dainties, unless formally set aside for them by way of sacrifice."},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 303 Man in his own interest and safety frequently presents them with such offerings. He knows well that he can never do this often enough, spectres being unlimited in number ; however liberally he spends in their behalf the good things he has, there always remain not a few perverse enough to spy out opportunities to harm him for no other purpose than to extort such gifts. Needless to say, such spectres are the miscreants among their class, transgressors of the great law that they are not entitled to harry mankind unless Heaven has affixed its consent or approval (see page 432). Hence, should they push this evil work too far and display too much impudence, they run the great risk that man, in his anxiety and despair, should hurry to the temple of the God of Walls and Moats, charged by Heaven with ruling the spectral world in that department or district, and that this god should have them caught, arraigned before his tribunal, flogged, or otherwise tortured, and even executed. Many tales describe this divine jurisprudence, and food-extorting spectres themselves have likewise been a frequent topic for fabulists. The following tale is drawn from a book of the fifth century : « A ghost of a recently deceased man, lean and weak, happened to see that of a friend who had died twenty years ago, and which was fat and strong. — What is the matter with you ? the latter asked, after mutual compliments. — I am so hungry that I can hardly bear it ; if you know any help for it, it is your day to tell me. The friendly ghost then said : — This is very easy : haunt men ; they will get afraid and give you to eat. The spectre went, and found a house. There was there a white dog ; he took it up and made it move through the air, and the family saw this with great fright, and exclaimed that such a miracle had never occurred. The oracle declared :"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 304 — A strange spectre begs for food ; kill the dog, sacrifice it to the spectre in the courtyard, together with some sweet fruits, spirits and rice, and nothing else will happen. The family followed the advice of the diviner, and the spectre really got great quantities of food to eat. Since that time p.795 it regularly haunted the people, as the other spectre had advised it to do (426). To give now some tales of modern date : « Yin Yueh-heng, living in Hang-cheu outside the north-east gate, returned home from the Sand-river rapid with half a pound of water-chestnuts in his bosom. The road took him past the lake of the Alms-bowl through a sparsely populated, uncultivated place with graveyards free to the public, containing numerous tumuli. Here he felt that the contents of his bosom lost their weight and the parcel got loose ; he felt for his chestnuts, and found they were gone. He returned to seek them, and found them in the cemetery, peeled and broken to pieces, on the top of a grave. He picked them up, put them in his bosom, and hurried home. However ere he had eaten them to the last he became ill, and loudly exclaimed : — We had not tasted any water-chestnuts for a long time and wanted yours to satisfy our constant desire for them, but you took them all away again ; why were you so stingy ? there we are in your own house ; we shall not leave it until we have eaten our full’. The family was greatly affrighted, and immediately set out food, to redeem the guilt of their headman. p.796 It is a custom among the people in Hang-cheu, whenever they see spectres out, for one person to walk ahead of them out of the gate, while another comes behind and shuts the gate. This family too followed this rule, but closed the door too hastily, and at this moment Yin Yueh-heng loudly cried : — When you have guests, you must treat them with respect ; now you shut the door so hurriedly before we have got outside, that my"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 305 leg is pinched in it ; I cannot stand the pain ; if you do not prepare another great meal and invite me to it, I will never leave your house. So the family had to exorcise them again by means of prayers and sacrifices, on which Yin somewhat recovered. Then sometimes he was better, while at other times his disease recurred, but he did not escape them, and finally died of the consequences (427). « A thief of the Ts‘ih tribe did his business with the greatest refinement, but had in the end stolen so often that he feared he had everybody on his track ; therefore he settled in a tumble-down house, beside a burial ground free to the public. Here quite a number of spectres haunted him in a dream. — If you properly sacrifice to us, they said, we shall make you rich ; and Ts‘ih promised in that dream that he would do so. But on waking he considered that it was nonsense to keep that promise, and did nothing. Then again the spectres appeared before him in a dream. — You must sacrifice to us in three days, they said, or we shall snatch away from you in broad daylight what you have stolen at night. Ts‘ih could not help giving in, but again on waking he sacrificed nothing. But then after three days he became severely ill. He p.797 told his wife to see after his things, whether the spectres did what they had threatened to do, and lo, with the sun in the zenith those things suddenly moved from their place, as if transported by mysterious hands. Ts‘ih would rise from his sickbed and catch them, but his hands and feet were as if fettered, and not until the things were all gone did his bonds relax, and he recovered from his illness. His mind was now cleared up entirely, and smilingly he said :"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 306 — I have burned sorrow-incense (?) to stupify others, but now it is I whom spectres stupify ; these here are the broad daylight spectres which people talk of. From that moment he altered his conduct, and became an honest man (428). A good trick of a spectre to obtain worship and sacrificial food is related in the following tale : « An officer of the Imperial Guards, fond of racing and shooting, while pursuing a hare at the eastern gate of the city pushed an old man, who was stooping down to draw water, into the well by his horse, which he could not stop in its rapid course. In great consternation he rode home, in all haste. The night he saw the old man push open the gate and enter. — You did not kill me intentionally, he said with a curse, but if you had called people to the rescue when you saw me fall into the well, my life might have been saved ; why did it occur to you to hurry away to your house ! The officer had nothing to say ; so the old man set to smashing his Chinaware, destroying his doors, and doing other bad work incessantly. The whole family prayed to him on their knees and set out offerings, and even celebrated sacrificial masses, but the spectre said : — All those things are of no use ; if you want to keep me quiet, you should carve p.798 a soul-tablet of wood for me, write my name and surname upon it, and sacrifice every day pigs’ feet to me ; treat me as if I were an ancestor of yours, and I shall forgive you. They did so, and the result was that the spectral work ceased. From that time, whenever he had to pass by the eastern gate of the city, he took a circuitous road, in order to avoid that well. Once passing by it while in the cortege of the emperor, he would have absconded in the former wise, but for his general, who said :"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 307 — If the emperor asks where you are, what shall we say ? besides, what have you to fear of spectres under the blue heaven in broad daylight, in the presence of a thousand cars and a myriad of horsemen ? And the officer could not help passing by the well. There he saw the old man in the same shape standing beside it, who rushed forward, grasped his coat, and said with a curse : — Aha, to-day I find you here ; some years ago you ran against me with your horse, and did not help me ; how could you find that in your heart ! He reviled him, and even beat him, and the officer, in fear and agitation, moaningly supplicated, saying : — How shall I excuse myself ? but you have accepted sacrifices in my house for years, and in your own person a promised to pardon me ; why do you now use such different language ? These words increased the fury of the old man ; — I was not yet dead, said he, why then did you sacrifice to me ? I was pushed into the well by your horse, but a passer-by hearing my cries for help immediately hauled me up ; how then can you take me for a ghost ? Now in the utmost fright, the officer took the old man to his house, and there they saw that the inscription on the soul-tablet was not his name. The old man tucked up his sleeves ; ejaculating a curse, he flung the tablet down and scattered the sacrificial articles on the ground ; and white the whole family stood aghast, quite at a loss what to think of it, a loud laughter was heard in mid air, and passed out of the house (429). p.799 « Su Tan-lao in Hang-cheu was a glib-tongued fellow, a mocker, generally hated. On New year’s day they painted the spirit of plague on a piece of paper and affixed this to his door. Opening the door at sunrise, he saw the picture, and with loud laughter took it into house ; he invited it to take a seat, drank some spirits in"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 308 company with it, and burned it. In that year there was a violent outbreak of plague. The sick among his neighbours on all sides rivalled one another in sacrificing to the spirit of the plague, and some among them, made ill (possessed) by it, spoke in the voice of the demon : — On New year’s day I have received worship from Su Tan-lao, and to my shame I have found no opportunity yet of requiting him ; those who wish to avert me must invite him to keep company with me, and then I shall depart. Now those who sacrificed to the spectre of the plague vied with each other in inviting Su, who was thus every day busily eating and drinking as much as he could. Not one in his family, which consisted of more than ten persons of various ages, caught the plague (430). Thus p.800 spectres extort food not only for themselves, but also for their friends among men. The tricks used by spectres to obtain food then vary in character and in the amount of shrewdness which they display ; yet other tales state, that it is not unusual for spectres to tell by the mouths of patients whom they possess, what sort of food they desire, what kind and what quantity of mock money, and in what place they wish these things handed over to them. These demands having been fulfilled by the family, the sufferer either recovers, or he utters new demands, his delirious talk, incomprehensible to common ears, being interpreted by experts of either sex. Not seldom the spectre declares itself to be a soul from some neglected grave in the neighbourhood, where then the family set down the offerings. Truth requires us to say, that spectres do not always prove ungrateful for the food which they extort. We have even read of some who, out of mere gratitude, rendered women pregnant of sons by placing into their wombs souls purchased somewhere with the paper money which those women had burned for them. In our systematization of the world of spectres we might have introduced an important special article on mischievous ghosts of the dead. But we have"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 309 already treated of these spectres in various chapters, as ghosts of the drowned (pp. 525 sqq.), as victims of tigers (pp. 554 sqq.) and of self-murderers (ch. IX), as living corpses and vampires (ch. X), as ghosts appearing at death (ch. XII), as avengers of wrong done to them while alive or after death (Part I, ch. XVI), or as devils of drought (Book I, p. 918 sqq.). As the dead contribute so large a contingent to the spectre-legions, it is natural that in China graves and cemeteries in particular are places where apparitions occur, and which on this account are dangerous for the living, especially when the sun has set. A tale may show what awful things may befall men there : « In the district of Yen-shi in Honan, a women of the tribe Sih, wife of the villager Chang Yuen, returned home from a visit to p.801 her mother. Her husband’s brother came to meet her on the road. The road led them past an old grave with a shadowy tree. Here the woman desired to relieve herself ; she gave her brother-in-law her donkey to hold, hung her red linen petticoat on the tree, and returned to this garment when she had finished, but it was gone. Then at home she passed the night in bed with her husband. The morning came and they did not rise ; the family tapped at the door and entered, and though the windows were in their proper state, the bodies of man and wife were there, but without their heads. The magistrate, informed of the case, found it impossible to give a verdict. He arrested the brother of the husband and examined him, and as this man related the loss of the petticoat on the day before, the mandarin repaired to the grave. He discovered a cave beside it, with a smooth path showing that some being was wont to go in and out, and on careful inspection he saw a red linen petticoat outside the cave, the same which had belonged to that sister-in-law. On digging up the grave, they found the two heads in it, but no coffin, the cave being very narrow, not larger than an arm. The mandarin could not possibly pass any sentence (431). @ "},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 310 CHAPTER XV The World of Spectres a Copy of that of Men @ p.802 The chapters which we have devoted to spectres and ghosts, and to the ways in which they work upon the fate of man, have brought out on many a page the fact that they lead an existence remarkably analogous to that of man. They appear and haunt in shapes almost, or quite, as material as his. They speak as man, cherish human affections and grudges, have human appetites and lusts, and indulge in sexual intercourse as well with men as among themselves. They fight like men, using weapons ; they combine into gangs and troops, even forming well equipped armies, and may be fought and warded off with human spears, swords and arrows. They use money, live on human food and drink, and dress as men do ; in short, man in China has modelled his spectres in almost every respect after his own likeness and image. Is it surprising then that popular imagination ascribes to spectres also a social life hardly different from the human ? As early as the sixth century before our era, as the lines show which we have extracted from the Tso ch‘wen on page 411, the power and influence of a spectre were deemed, just as in China’s human society, to be proportional to the numbers and might of the clan to which it had belonged on this earth and of which it remained a member after death ; which also points to belief in the continuity of family-life and clan-life beyond the present. The homes of those clans were situated in special ‘regions of kwei spectres or ghosts’, the real sites of which were, of course, never determined. In the Yih king we read, that a line of a kwa called signifies : « Kao Tsung attacking the spectre-regions, and defeating them in three years (432), and that the kwa named has a line suggesting the idea of p.803 "},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 311 « a movement to attack a spectre-region, producing beneficial effects on the Great Realm in three years (433). These passages refer professedly to an old tradition according to which Kao Tsung or Wu Ting, a monarch believed to have reigned in the fourteenth century B. C. (see Book I, p. 480), led his troops against some remote barbarian country. This tradition is preserved in the Annals of the Bamboo Book, in these words : « In the 32nd year of his reign he attacked the spectre-regions and camped in King, and in the 34th year the royal armies conquered those countries. It is worth observing in this connection, that to this day the Chinese show remarkable fondness for styling foreigners kwei. In the Shi king too mention is made of regions of kwei in an ode which makes king Wen, the founder of the Cheu dynasty, say of the dethroned last sovereign of the house of Shang : « Indignation is rife in the Middle Kingdom, which extends even over the spectre-regions (434). A spectre-realm inhabited by one-eyed beings with human faces, is mentioned in the Shan-hai king, which places it among the northern countries between the seas, its notices on which form the twelfth chapter, the North being indeed the region of the Yin or cold and darkness with which spectres are assimilated. Ma Twan-lin devoted some lines to a realm of that name, which he described among the countries in the extreme north. « It lies sixty days’ travelling from the kingdom of Kiao-ma. Its inhabitants roam about in the night, but hide themselves during the day. They dress in dirty pieces (?) of deerskin. Their eyes, noses and ears are like those of the people in the Middle Kingdom, but they have their mouths on the top of their heads. They eat from earthenware dishes. There is no rice in their country, and they live upon deerskin and horses of the country (or earth-"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 312 horses ?). Thirty days travelling from the south of that realm takes one to that of the Tuh-küeh (435). p.804 In those mysterious countries, never obliterated from people’s fancy and memory, spectres and ghosts carried on regular trading business, even having for the purpose special markets or bazaars. This idea may have easily arisen from the existence of markets among tribes of mountaineers whom Chinese fancy converted into spectres. The official Histories of the T‘ang dynasty inform us, that « there are, at the Western Sea, markets where traders, without seeing each other, put down beside the merchandise the price which they offer ; those places are called spectre-markets (436). And a work of later date says : « On the sea-coasts spectre-markets are kept, where people congregate at midnight, to separate at cock-crow ; men often obtain thence curious articles 1. It may be observed that rolling thunder in distant, dark clouds is to the present day often called a demon-market. It is from that region that, under the cover of night, hosts of devils swarm out regularly through imaginary gates, dubbed spectre-gates. Thus we read, « in the daytime those gates are not open, but at sunset human voices sound there, and a colour as of blue fire then beams forth from them (437). Mention is made of a spectre-gate in the south, in a spot forming at one time the farthest confine of the empire in that direction : « Thirty miles in a southerly direction from the district city of Poh-liu (in the south-eastern part or Kwangsi) two rocks stand opposite one another at a distance of thirty paces. The people call them the spectre-gate pass. The way of the general Ma Yuen of the Han  1 Pi shu man ch‘ao, Desultory Writings during a Summer Retreat, a little book which I have not seen, probably written in the Wan lih period (1573-1620) by T‘an Siu.

V 313 dynasty, the Queller of the Waves, on his expedition against the Man of Lin-yih, lay through it ; he erected there a stone tablet (commemorative of this event), p.805 of which the (pedestal in the shape of a) stone tortoise still exists. In times gone by, travellers to Kiao-chi (Cochin-China) all used to pass through this gate. Southward from it malaria is so prevalent that those who depart hence seldom return alive. It is a common saying that nine men out of ten never return through the spectre-gate pass 1. It seems that this pass owed its lugubrious name merely to a play on words or to a mistake, it being not, in fact, called gate of the kwei or spectres, but gate of the kwei , or Cassia tree. And these old names have been superseded a long time ago by one of good omen. « According to the Yü-t‘i ki shing, the pass of the kwei-tree gate was in the beginning incorrectly called that of the spectre-gate. In the first year of the Hung wu period of the Ming dynasty (1368) its name was changed into kwei-tree pass, which was replaced again in the Süen teh period (1426-1436) by that of pass of the gate of Heaven (438). In the remote spectre-countries, according to an old tradition, the inhabitants were engendered by a mysterious being, called Kwei mu, the Mother of Spectres. « In the South sea regions a mother of spectres lives in the Lesser Yü mountains. She gives birth to all the kwei that live in heaven and on earth. At every litter she brings forth ten, which, born in the morning, she devours in the evening. She is the shen who, under the name of Spectre-lady, exists in Ts‘ang-wu (i. e. the region about the spectre-gate pass). She has a tiger’s head, feet like a dragon, p.806 eyes of a python snake, and eyebrows of a kiao dragon. In Wu and Yueh (Kiangsu, Chehkiang and Fuhkien) her image of clay or wood is placed in the temples erected as a  1 That pass seems to be frequently confounded with a spectre-gate pass across the Annam frontier, to the south of Langson city where a temple to Ma Yuen stands, or formerly stood.

V 314 security against tempests ; it has a dragon’s head, a cow’s ears. and connected eye-brows, placed over one single eye (439). This mother of spectres seems, however, to be an exotic invention, imported at an early date, and playing a part in China’s Buddhist religion. We shall therefore have to pay attention to her in some later volume. Apart from those and some other legends, spectre-tales in general prove decisively that the demon-world in China has been thought at all times to exist in conjunction with that of men. It has its kwei wang or ‘spectre-kings’, and in Fuhkien it is a general custom among the people in accosting spectres, to cajolingly style them kúi ông, which is the local form of kwei wang. In particular, however, spectres and ghosts are, somewhat later than the beginning of our era, placed by popular imagination under the sway of a divinity residing in Shantung, in the T‘ai-shan or Great Mountain, also styled Tung-yoh or Eastern Mountain. He exercises justice especially over the ghosts of the dead, arraigning them for the purpose before his tribunal, and torturing and punishing them, his court being in consequence actually a hell. Or they may be haled before his coadjutors, the Ch‘ing-hwang shen or Gods of Walls and Moats. These divinities officiate in the walled towns of the empire, on a par with the mandarins who serve the Son of Heaven there. Each such town possesses a temple where the god is deemed to hold court and to wield the sceptre over the spirits within the same jurisdiction where the highest local officer residing in the town exercises terrestrial sway. The God of the Eastern Mountain likewise has a temple in most cities. These buildings are resorts for all who desire protection against evil spirits, and the gods residing therein accordingly are local patron-divinities with a p.807 paramount place in China’s religious life. We are not concerned with them as yet ; it is sufficient to state here that a number of spectres are thought to be devils in their service, sent out to arrest souls and hale them before their tribunals for examination, cruel torture, and bloody punishment (cf. 776). The comparison of the Chinese world of spectres with that of men may be drawn out still farther. We know already (see page 476) that spectres possess armies which occasionally attack man, in order to destroy his welfare ; but"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 315 apart from this, their society has its regular internal strifes, wars and battles. We read on this head, that « seventy miles northward from Ping-cheu, an old grave was besieged every evening in the first year of the Ching kwan period (A. D. 627) by more than ten thousand spectral soldiers with banners and standards, fresh and clean. Then that grave poured forth instantly several thousand ghostly infantry and cavalry, joining with the besiegers in a hot battle beside the grave, and not until it was night did the two parties withdraw. This had gone on for about a month, when one evening there appeared yet another army from the north, upward of ten thousand spectres strong. They had just arrayed their ranks a few miles from the grave, when a farmer saw them, and took to his heels in consternation. A commander of the spectres ordered some ten of his men to catch him, and on his being brought before him, addressed him in these terms : — Have no fear ; I am a shen of the Gobi desert, robbed by an subordinate commander of my favourite concubine, with whom he has eloped into this grave, and the lord Chang, whose burial place this is, employs soldiery to fight us (440). Thus spirits also have consorts of their own kind ; which, in fact, the reader knows from many of our tales. It is in truth an established tenet, brought into prominence by our chapter on p.808 Sutteeism (Book I, p. 735), that the ties uniting husbands and wives in this world are not broken by death. Now as marriage in China under whatever form purports the production of offspring, we cannot but infer that ghosts and spectres also procreate their race, and that their society is not recruited, solely from that of dying men. And where sexual life exists, jealousy is rife ; hence, naturally, spectres in China are not exempt from this hateful passion. Outside the south gate of Kü-yung, thus runs a tale, « there are the graves of nine husbands. Current tradition asserts, that once upon a time there lived a most handsome wife, whose"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 316 husband died when she had by him not more than one baby boy. Her family estate was very large ; therefore she took to herself another husband, but this one too died after having begotten one son by her ; he was buried beside the first one. Now she took a third goodman, who died in the same circumstances, and in this way things went on, till she had had nine husbands, and possessed nine sons.. The nine graves lay in a circle, and when she died, she was buried in the midst. Then at every sunset there rose a cold wind on the spot, and in the night crying, whistling and quarrelling voices were heard, as if those husbands were jealously snatching the wife out of each other’s hands. In the end wayfarers no longer ventured by the spot, and the neighbouring villagers became so uneasy about the matter, that they lodged a complaint with the prefect Chao T‘ien-tsioh. This grandee went with them to the graves. He there held a judicial session, and ordered his underlings to deal thirty heavy blows with their long sticks on the top of each grave ; and since that time the deepest silence has reigned on the spot (441). p.809 Apart from the graves which the living provide for the dead, spirits have burial places of their own making. « In Ch‘en-cheu, a work of the T‘ang dynasty asserts, forty miles west of the principal city of the Sü-p‘u district (in Hunan), a mountain lies, where spectres bury their dead. Hwang Min’s description of Yuen-cheu says : ‘There, on the central cliff, coffins stand, which, seen from the distance, seem to be more than ten chang in size. It is called the graveyard of the spectres. Old people say, that when the spectres were making those coffins, for seven days and nights nothing was heard but the clicking of axes and chisels ; tools, knives and axes disappeared from the houses in a mysterious way, and were all restored to the owners on the seventh day when the spectres were ready, those tools then all having a greasy appearance and a smell of rancid flesh. The coffins stood by that time in the same position they have at present, athwart on the brink of the cliff (442)."},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 317 Ideas about spectre regions being firmly fixed in the minds of the Chinese, tales about men who have visited them have, of course, been made in considerable numbers. As an instance the following one may be translated here : « When the Chu family or Liang dynasty reigned, a trader of Ts‘ing-cheu (in Shantung) was out at sea, and blown by a gale to a place where he saw in the distance land with a walled city. The sea-captain said : — Never has anybody been blown hither by the wind ; I have heard that the realm of spectres must be here ; could it be this ? The ship soon reached the shore ; they landed, and went to the city. The houses and fields they passed did not differ from those in the Middle Kingdom. They saluted all whom they saw, but nobody saw them. At the city-gate there was a watch ; they bowed, but the watchmen did not return their courtesy. They entered the city, and found houses, men and animals in great numbers. Then they came to the palace, where a great feast was just being given by the king to the p.810 ministers, and several dozen boon-companions attended on him. Ceremonial clothes, caps, implements, and decorations in silk and bamboo were almost in every respect of the same kind as those used in China. The foreigners went up the steps into the palace-hall, and as they crowded around the king’s seat, in order to look at him, he on a sudden became ill. His attendants carried him home, and hastily called a wu to examine him, who said : — People from a yang country have came hither ; yang influences have thronged into this place ; this is it why the king has fallen ill ; those men have come here accidentally and cause this spectral evil unintentionally ; we therefore can ask them to go away, by means of food and drink, carts and horses. Immediately they prepared spirits and eatables and set out seats in a side-room, and the ministers came with the wu to offer those"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 318 things to them and pray to them, and the foreigners ate and drank at the tables. Suddenly slaves appeared with horses ; the foreigners mounted, and returned to the place whence they had come. At the seashore they went on board, and even to this last moment the people of that realm did not see them. As there blew again a fair wind, they could sail home (443). Thus spectres treat men as men treat spectres ; men are dangerous p.811 to spectres as spectres are to men, by their natural contrary influence, and they are mutually exorcised by means of sacrifices. Another abode of spectres is sketched by the following tale, paraphrased and abridged by us : In Szĕ-ch‘wen, in the district of Fung-tu on the Yang-tszĕ, men and spectres have intercourse. There is in that place a well, into which every year paper money is thrown in great quantities, and near which very much paper is burned as a tribute to the rulers of the nether world ; those who refuse to do so are punished with plagues and diseases. At the beginning of the present dynasty, Liu Kang entered upon his functions as prefect of the district, and heard of those practices. He forbade them, and people who blamed him for so doing he caused to be arrested, but they proved obstinate, and told him that there were spectres in the well, and that nobody yet had ventured himself to the bottom of it. This tempted the mandarin and another brave man, one Li Sien, to have themselves lowered into it with a rope to a depth of some fifty feet. First it was dark, but then they entered a spot as clear as daylight, where they saw a city with walls, palaces and houses, just as in the world of men, but where people walked in the air and had no shadows. Being a mandarin, he was received by everybody with great politeness, and conducted before one lord Pao, alias Yama, a man of about seventy, enthroned in a splendid palace, with a crown on his head. A seat having been politely offered to the mandarin, he requested that the people should be relieved of that annual tax of paper on account of their poverty ; on which Pao smilingly said that Taoist and Buddhist priests always deluded the people with ghost-tales, causing them to lay out large sums on sacrifices and masses, so that mandarins should take measures to restrain them and their doings."},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 319 Just then the Great Mara-subduing Emperor arrived, that is to say, Kwan-ti, the God of War ; out of the air he came, in a cloud of red light. He asked our mandarin about various things relating to the human world, and Li Sien was so bold to ask him where his residence was. The god did not answer, but immediately took his leave and departed, evidently in wrath. Lord Pao told Li Sien that this impudent question might cost him his life, and he probably p.812 would be smashed by thunder, but his body might escape destruction by fire if he died before that disaster came ; to this end he marked his back with a great seal. Then both men had themselves hauled up out of the well, and ere they had reached the south gate of the city, Li Sien caught cold and died. Soon after this a thunderstorm set fire to his coffin and burned it, as also his clothes, but his body remained undamaged because of the impression of the seal (444). Besides such fanciful spectre-realms, the Chinese, especially owing to Buddhist influence, have infernal regions inhabited by myriads of spectres. It is not, however, these infernal beings who visit them with evil and disease, nor are these the powers against whom man is for ever waging the war for his protection. They rather are objects of his pious care, miserable victims of their own sins, to be charitably delivered from their abodes of distress by the help of religion. The methods invented and practised to this end, as also those places of woe, will be subjects for description in other parts of this work. @ "},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 320 PART III SORCERY @ p.813 As is the case with all pagan peoples which exist or have existed on this earth, so also the race which lives on Chinese soil has probably at all times produced men and women who were popularly credited with a power, surpassing that of ordinary mortals, of influencing spirits, either for good or ill. By means of such magic they might actually set in motion good and evil spirits, a fact which suggests of itself an express or tacit agreement with those beings, or the possession of a dominion over them, which imposes obedience more or less implicit. To use the common Chinese expressions, they could ‘evoke or call kwei and shen’, and then ‘employ them’. Such animistic magic then may be divided into two distinct kinds. That which aims at producing human felicity, especially by working upon good spirits or gods by means of rites, invocations, and other practices, may be called religious magic, white magic ; this constitutes the principal part of the functions of priesthood, and will occupy us much in other parts of this work. The other, which employs spirits to do harm to men, is animistic sorcery, black magic, witchcraft, and will be treated of in the following pages. This inferior sort of magic works, of course, in the dark. Since it keeps the credulous hearts of the whole nation in constant anxiety and fright, as does the whole host of evil spirits, general odium attaches to all who practise it, exposing them at any moment to public vengeance and to severe prosecution by magistrates, who as a rule are not much less credulous than the mob. Nevertheless p.814 sorcery is mentioned sufficiently often in writings to force on us the conclusion that it has always thriven in China, not less luxuriantly perhaps than in our own Europe in ancient and mediæval times.

V 321 testimony to the fact, that where belief in evil spirits prevails, black art, which calls such beings into action, cannot fail to flourish. The secrecy with which black art envelops itself, renders the study of its details extremely difficult. Wizards and witches can hardly be expected to incriminate themselves and risk their safety and lives by betraying their secrets ; illiterate men generally profess to know little of it, and probably they speak the truth ; and literati have no more to tell than what they have read in some books which we may ourselves consult as well as they. Hence the reader of these pages must content himself with desultory information gleaned from Chinese books, besides some scanty hearsay evidence jotted down in our note-books while living in China for the purpose of studying the people. Sorcery in China is not a special profession. Since the belief in spectres is universal there and profound, and those beings are within the reach of everybody, the world being crowded with them, every one may practise that art who possesses the will, and sufficient knowledge of the methods. But, as a matter of course, the extensive class of people who profess to exert influence upon the fate of men by means of the powers that work in the Universe and constitute its Tao or Order, that is, priests, soothsayers and diviners, geomancers, wu, in short, occult scientists in the widest sense, are openly suspected above all others of occupying themselves with sorcery ; and ever since the Han dynasty books testify that they have been at all times objects of such suspicion. Sorcery is generally denominated in Chinese books yao tao, yao shuh or yao fah, or sié tao, sié shuh or sié fah, all which terms equally mean ‘methods of demonry’, whereas yao and sié denote (see p. 466) the baneful influences of spectres. Since, however, the word sié has a wider sense, embracing everything which is contrary to the Tao or Order of Nature, thus p.815 heterodoxy (see p. 467), the words sié tao, sié shuh and sié fah denote also heterodox magic, religious or other, performed without any intent to do harm to men, or even with benevolent purpose ; also innocent juggling, and weird tricks of legerdemain or applications of mysterious, unknown natural laws, have been included under those terms by ignorant, distrustful minds, and"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 322 those who practised them have, no doubt, at all times often been punished even with death as corrupters of good manners, agents of disturbance and confusion, and enemies of morality and social order. We have then sharply to distinguish between heterodox magic and sorcery, for, though sorcery is heterodox magic, heterodox magic is far from always being sorcery. No doubt various parts of the Chinese empire have special vernacular terms to denote sorcery, which have not passed into the written language, and may have their origin in the night of time. Such is the word khiò, which we find in Amoy. Such expressions should not, of course, be confounded with co-existing vernacular words denoting white magic. One term of frequent use, denoting animistic sorcery, deserves special notice, because it seems to be the only one which is classical, viz. , ‘way or method to make a false or wrong use of kwei and shen’. It is borrowed from the Li ki (ch. 18, l. 38), from a passage which we may regard as the oldest Chinese written law against disturbance of public peace, and corruption of morals and customs by heterodox doctrines, magic or witchcraft of any kind : « With death are punished those who, by splitting language (criticism ?) minish the power of the law, and by casting doubt on what is authoritative try to cause revolution, or by employing aberrant Tao throw government into disorder. The penalty of death is also inflicted on makers of heterodox (sié) music, official garments different from those prescribed, strange ingenious contrivances, and strange implements, thus causing perplexity to arise among the multitude. Those who are guilty of unnatural conduct and persist therein ; those who indulge in heterodox speech and therewith dispute ; those who apply themselves to evil and become versed therein ; those who follow what is wrong and become imbued therewith — they all shall, if they cause perplexity to arise among the multitude, be put to death.

We readily admit that the term allows of other translations than ‘wrongful use of kwei and shen’, which we propose 1. Nevertheless it must as readily be agreed, that, considering the fact that later authors have attached the signification of animistic sorcery to it, it is not irrational to conclude that in the unknown time when the above passage was written, it actually referred to such sorcery — a capital offence. @  1 Legge translates : ‘to give false reports about appearances of spirits’ ; and Couvreur : ‘dire des faussetés concernant les manifestations des esprits’."},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol.

It is then simply a matter of course that the Chinese should be convinced that sorcerers may cause their own soul to haunt and inflict evil on their enemies or victims. « In Hang-cheu, one Chao Ts‘ing-yao was so fond of chess that he could not hear chess-men being set up without placing himself at the chess-board. Once when out for a stroll to the temple of the Two Saints, he found there a Taoist with vulgar features, just engaging in a game with a visitor, and showing himself so poor a player, though he called himself an accomplished master, that Chao felt disgusted, and without deigning to address a word to him took his departure. Next night, on going to bed, he perceived two spectre-lights (will-o’the-wisps) moving round and round his bed-curtains. He did not deem it worth while to bestir himself at this sight, but on a sudden a spectre with a blue face and with teeth like a saw drew back the curtains, and stood before him, sword in hand. Chao addressed some angry words to it, with the result that it vanished. The following night a humming noise sounded in his bed, as if of a number of boys reciting their lessons. At first the noise was not very distinct, but on listening more attentively he could distinguish these words : — Is it any business p.817 of yours that I am a poor player and yet call myself an accomplished master ? why did you presume to treat me disrespectfully for that ?"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol.

He heard the voice whisper thus : — A very bold fellow you are, one who fears no knives, nor swords ; but I will draw your life out of you by the method of hooking the hwun out of men. And on this he distinguished the following incantation : — Heaven’s spiritual power (ling), work powerfully ; spiritual power of Earth, work powerfully ; a needle in your fontanel, and one under your heart. On these words Chao felt his whole body shiver, as if overwhelmed by fear ; but he kept control of his nerves and did not stir in the slightest. Stopping his ears with his hands he slumbered on, and though the spell went on ringing from his pillow, he endured it with firmness. A month passed away, when suddenly the Taoist doctor knelt down before his bed, his eyes wet with tears. — I have, he said, in a fit of anger set my arts to work against you, in order to intimidate you, hoping thereby to compel you to come to an understanding with me, and to get from you some money and silk, but I was mistaken, for you were not affected in the least. I now vainly deplore what I have done, for when my magic remains ineffectual upon my victims, it brings misfortune on myself. So I died yesterday, and my soul having no refuge, I am anxious to offer you my humble services as a patron divinity of your camphor trees and your willows, thus to atone for my iniquity. Chao gave no answer, but sent a man next morning to the temple of the two Saints, who found that the Taoist had cut his own throat. Since that time Chao knew everything one day before it occurred, and it was said that the Taoist doctor was his servitor (446). p.819 "},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 326 « In the Metropolis, when young babies regularly take to crying, the people are wont to ascribe this to what they call ‘petty night-stars’. There lived there a wu, who could catch these beings by means of a bow of mulberry wood and arrows of peachwood. In the home of a Vice-president of a Board the great-grandfather had left a concubine, now upwards of ninety years old. This Old Aunt, as the family was wont to call her, used to sit on a warmed brick bod the whole day long, and never did a word pass her lips, nor a smile appear on her face. She kept a darling cat, who was her inseparable companion. The Vice-president had a baby, still carried pickaback. It spent its nights crying incessantly, wherefore he ordered the night-star hunting wu to cure it ; and this man came with his small bow, and an arrow to the shaft of which he had tied a white silk thread, several chang in length, wound around his fourth finger. Thus armed, he sat down quietly till midnight, when the moon-light began to shine upon the window, enabling him to see hazily on the paper pane a shadow, rapidly gliding over it forward and backward : a woman of seven or eight feet high, on horseback, with a long spear in her hand.

The family beat the cat to death, and deprived the Aunt of all food and drink, so that she died not long after. The child never cried again (447). This tale, which reminds us vividly of our European witches with their cats serving them to ride on, leaves it beyond doubt that the soul of that hag had gone out as a demon to torment the child, and that her cat’s soul served her as a spectral horse for her nocturnal trips. Professors of black art are even described as projecting themselves into corpses, in order to employ these as kiang si with all the atrocious, murderous propensities for which those demons are so notorious. « Two T‘ung-ch‘ing men, Chang and Sü, connected by ties of friendship, were trading in the province of Kiangsi, and they had travelled as far as Kwang-sin, when Sü died in the upper chamber of an inn. Chang then went to the bazaar to buy a coffin for him. The undertaker asked him two thousand coins for p.821 one, and the bargain was closed, when an old man seated beside the counter interposed, and told him not to let it go under four thousand. On which Chang lost his temper and returned to his inn. That evening, when he was upstairs, the corpse reared itself up and gave him a thrashing, driving him in manifold terror to seek shelter downstairs. Next day, in the clear morning light, he went out again to fetch the coffin, and offered a thousand coins more for it. The owner of the coffin-shop said nothing, but there was again the old man of the counter who had made objections, who said with a curse : — I am not the master here, but they all know me as the crouching hill-tiger ; if you do not give me two thousand coins, that is to say, the same sum as the shopkeeper wants for the coffin, you shall not have it.

Again he received an affirmative answer, whereupon he handed a whip to Chang, saying : — This is the whip with which Wu Tszĕ-sü belaboured the corpse of king P‘ing of Ch‘u (Book I, p. 349) ; should the corpse rear itself up again this night and attack you, then use this whip, and you will get the coffin and be delivered from the trouble you are in. With these words the man disappeared. Chang went to the inn and ascended the ladder ; and no sooner did the corpse jump up than he belaboured it as he had been told to do, p.822 so soundly that it fell to the ground under the blows. On his visiting the shop next day for the coffin, the shopkeeper said : — The crouching hill-tiger of last night is dead, and our country all around is thus rid of a nuisance ; now carry off the coffin for the original price of two thousand. Of course Chang asked him for further explanation. — That old fellow, the shopkeeper said, is one of the Hung tribe ; he was in possession of sorcerous arts, could employ spectres, and was also in the habit of employing corpses to attack men. Whenever any one died and a coffin had to be bought, he was to be found in my shop to extort an extra share for himself, consisting of half the price paid ; he has done so for several years, and many have incurred the evil consequences of his deeds.

The Chinese statements and narratives about men changing themselves into animals, of which we have composed our chapter on Zoanthropy (pp. 156 sqq.) and that on Animal-spectres (pp. 542 sqq.), leave no room for doubt that such metamorphoses are in many cases, if not in must, regarded by the Chinese as intentional. This appears especially conspicuously in the tale about Cheu Chen, who changed himself into a tiger by means of a charm and a p.823 painted picture of the beast (page 169) ; tigroanthropy quite or partly wilful probably was that of Ch‘en Shih-shan (page 179) ; Chu Tu-shi (p. 548) certainly was a bloodthirsty tiger by his own will ; persons changing themselves into wolves at pleasure were the lad in the tale on page 565, the Hunnish woman Kin (page 566), and the herdsman Ts‘ang (page 567). If such self-transformed were-animals inflict evil on men, this is animistic sorcery, inasmuch as the soul of the man or the animal may be deemed to have an actual share in the transformation (cf. page 156). Such four-footed agents of black art may, like all animal-devils, inflict disease. « In the twentieth year of the Khien lung period (A. D. 1755) a family in the Metropolis had a young baby which frequently was paralized by fright (convulsions), and died before it had lived for a full year. During such fits a black thing like an owl fluttered around the lamp, and the quicker it flew, the more the child panted, and when it had entirely ceased to breathe the beast disappeared. Not long afterwards another child of that family had convulsions. But then a Mr. Ngoh, officer of the Imperial Guard, an intrepid man, heard of it ; flying into a passion, he stationed himself on the spot with a bow and arrows, to shoot the black brute as soon as he would see it come. He touched the string ; off the arrow flew ; a cry of pain was heard, and blood trickled down on the ground. He followed this track across a double wall, lost it at the fire-place in the house of Li, the President of the Board of War, and took post there with his arrows."},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 330 Mr. Li, astonished, appeared, and asked him what he wanted, and Ngoh, who was a relation of his, told him what the matter was. Now the President gave orders to look about the furnace, and they found in an apartment beside it a hag with green eyes, with an arrow sticking in her waist, from which the blood trickled p.824 down ; she had the shape of a mi monkey, being a Miao-tszĕ woman whom the President had brought home from Yunnan province, where he had been a mandarin. She was extremely old and pretended not to know her own age. Thus suspected of sorcery, she was manacled and interrogated, on which she owned to the possession of certain spells, by merely reciting which she could change herself bodily into strange birds. When thus changed, she waited for the second watch to fly out and devour the brains of babies, more than several hundreds of which she had thus harmed. Mr. Li, enraged, fettered her, made a pile of fuel, and burned her alive ; and from that moment a long tranquillity reigned, and there were no more convulsions among babies (449). Instead of their own souls in an animal shape, sorcerers and sorceresses project those of animals for their evil purpose, or perhaps the animals themselves. The reader has already made acquaintance with this form of black art in our dissertation on cat-spectres (p. 610), where we have related from standard history a case of sorcerous use of cats by grandees at the Imperial court of the Sui dynasty in A. D. 598 ; it has taught us that the main principles of this form of black art consisted in this, that its practitioners imposed their will upon the animal by means of sacrifices, spells and incantations, thus inducing it to make people ill or kill them, and steal their possessions. It is interesting to learn from that event, that in those times even an emperor sacrificed to his belief in such sorcery his brother-in-law and his wife ; we may infer from this the credulity of the rest. It was, according to the historian, principally the personal intervention of the empress which saved the culprit : « When T‘o, the brother of the empress by another mother, was condemned to death for having employed cat-spectres against her,"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 331 with wu-ist ku, spells and incantations, she p.825 did not eat for three days, and interceded for his life in these terms : — If he had inflicted any damage on the government or the people, I would not venture to say one word ; but as he has merely committed an offence against my person, I have the courage to intercede for his life. On this, T‘o’s penalty of death was diminished by one degree (450). Much more significant of the strength of the belief in the reality of cat-sorcery were that emperor’s orders to persecute and destroy all families accused of it. In the chronological list of the events of his reign we read : « In the eighteenth year of the Khai-hwang period (598), in the fifth month, he decreed that families keeping cat-spectres, breeding ku poison, holding spectres in subjection, or practising any such savage or barbarous methods whatever, should be banished to the farthest frontier-regions at the four cardinal points (451). We have not found in Chinese books of any period any further reference to cat-spectre sorcery ; which may mean, either that the case of the Sui dynasty stands alone, or that the crime of which it relates merely existed in the imagination of the emperor and his courtiers. Let us notice, that his brother-in-law was accused of having occupied himself also with ‘wu-ist ku’, and that the cruel crusade was ordered against breeders of ‘ku poison’ and people ‘keeping spectres in subjection’. We have here to do with two methods of animistic sorcery, which we find in books of all times mentioned more often than any other, and to which we shall now first of all give our attention. @ "},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 332 CHAPTER II Sorcery by means of small Reptiles and Insects @ p.826 From early ages, sorcerers and sorceresses in China have used poisonous reptiles and insects for the exercise of their black art. The cauldron in which Gallic, Germanic and Scandinavian hags brewed their deleterious plants or drugs, has had there from ancient times its counterpart in a pot with insects and reptiles, which, as authors constantly assert, were left to devour each other, the last surviving creature, after having swallowed all the others and thus appropriated their venomous qualities, then being employed as the instrument of evil. This pot we find denoted by the special character , now pronounced ku, formed by the hieroglyph , a pot or vessel, and , reptiles or insects. Thus, from the very outset, we see sorcery associated with poison. The antiquity of the habit of keeping such pots is obvious from the fact that mention is made of it in the Cheu li. This work says, that a certain official, entitled Chü shi (decocter ?), « was charged with the duty of exterminating poisonous ku, attacking this with spells and thus exorcising it, as also with the duty of attacking it with efficacious herbs ; all persons able to fight ku he was to employ according to their capacities (452). It is certainly to be regretted that that work is absolutely silent about the particulars of the manner in which those anti-sorcery officials exercised their vocation. Another intimation that such black art is very ancient, occurs in the writings of Szĕ-ma Ts‘ien, in which we read, that « the Ruler Teh of the state of Ts‘in in the second year of his reign (675 B. C.) suppressed ku at the commencement of the hottest summer-period by means of dogs (453)."},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 333 According to p.827 commentators, these animals were for the purpose butchered and affixed to the four gates of the capital. We must notice, however, that the word ku may refer in this passage to insects in general, it having, as we shall see presently, acquired this signification as well. We learn something of interest about the breeding of ku from the Tso ch‘wen : « The Ruler of Tsin asked that of Ts‘in for a physician, and the latter sent one Hwo to see him, who said : — This disease cannot be cured ; it is what we call a sickness caused by approaching the women’s chambers, and its symptoms are like those of ku ; it is not caused by spectres, nor by (bad) food, but the patient’s mind is disordered, so that his firmness of will is lost.... Chao Meng then asked the physician what he meant by ku. — It is, he said, a thing which produces excessive indulgence in debauchery, as also disorders by confusion of the mind ; in its written form it contains the components ‘pot’ and ‘reptiles or insects’, constituting the character ku ; the flying insects in corn also are ku, and in the Cheu yih (the Yih king) a girl confounding a man, and the wind blowing down from the mountains are said to be due to ku ; — all these matters are of the same kind 1. Thus the term ku also included the use of philtre-maggots by women desirous of exciting the lusts of men and attracting them into debauchery. And, evidently, ku was also used to destroy crops or food-stores, or, as the learned physician expressed it, to make the corn fly away, perhaps in the form of winged insects born therein ; indeed, the character for ku is regularly used in literature to denote devastating grubs and insects, including internal parasites of the human body, which exercise a destructive influence like poison.  1 One of the kwa, treated in the Yih king, viz. , the eighteenth, bears the name of ; see the Cheu yih cheh chung, ch. 3, l. 11 ; ch. 9, l. 20 ; ch. 11, l. 29.

V 334 « Ku means insects in the belly, says the Shwoh wen ; the spectre of a dead man whose head is exposed on a stake, also is ku (454). p.828 This last statement seems to reveal to us a belief that such a soul, roaming restlessly about because of its corpse being mutilated, must be avenging itself on the living by settling in their intestines in the shape of the same maggots and grubs which gnaw away its decaying head. The fact that ku sorcery is mentioned in China’s early literature, inclines us to the belief that it may have been practised in that country from primeval times. The rôle it played under the Han dynasty must have been very considerable, if we may estimate its dimensions from the cruelty, nay ferocity, of the measures which were then adopted against those who indulged in it ; and these measures testify better than anything to the fact that such malefactors constantly tortured the souls of even the most powerful potentates with dread and terror. The Standard Histories of that House tell of empresses, princely magnates, grandees and courtiers, disgraced, degraded, imprisoned, and put to death on the charge of such crime, even of a bloody rebellion entailed by such a crusade. Generally those authoritative works call that sorcery wu ku or ‘wu-ist ku’, which evidently indicates that it was deemed to be practised in particular by wu or professional priests and priestesses, animistic magicians, exorcists, whom the reader has so often met in this work, and to whom we shall specially devote Part V of this Book, We read that the emperor Wu « in the fifth year of the Yuen kwang period (130 B. C.), in the seventh month, arrested the makers of wu ku, and that their heads were all exposed on stakes (455). No particulars are given of this bloody chase. But under that same emperor there occurred another crusade, of which many details have been preserved in different chapters of the Books of the Early Han Dynasty. One chapter relates as follows : « The son of Kung-sun Ho, King-shing, succeeded his father as director of the Court of the Imperial Stud and Stables, so that father and son both belonged to the highest dignitaries. King-shing"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 335 was the son of a sister of the empress, and therefore indulged in extravagant pomp and lawless conduct In the Ching hwo period (B. C. 92-89), he arbitrarily spent nineteen hundred myriads of coins belonging to the army of the North ; this was discovered, and he was imprisoned. At that time an imperial order was issued to arrest p.829 one Chu Ngan-shi of Yang-ling, but this man could not be found. The emperor insisted urgently upon search being made for him, on which Kung-sun Ho offered to track and catch him, if he might thereby redeem the guilt of his son. The emperor accepted his offer, and Kung-sun Ho succeeded in catching the man. This Chu Ngan-shi was one of the most influential persons in the Metropolis. Hearing that Ho used him to ransom his son from punishment, he laughed ; — The misfortune of that minister shall now involve his whole tribe ! he said, there will not be bamboo enough in the southern mountains to write the accusations on, which I shall bring, nor will the Yié valley supply wood enough for the handcuffs I shall cause to be made. And from his gaol he wrote letters to the emperor, in which he accused King-shing of sexual intercourse with the imperial princess Yang-shih, and of having by some wu offered sacrifices (to evil spirits) and imprecated evil upon the emperor. Besides he calumniously declared, that when the emperor went up to Kan-ts‘üen, they had buried human images in the high road, using imprecations and spells. Hereupon the emperor ordered some ministers to examine Ho judicially, and to take drastic measures against his mischief ; and father and son were put to death in their prisons. The calamity which wu-ist ku thus brought down on their family and clan was set in motion by Chu Ngan-shi ; it was completed by Kiang Ch‘ung, so that the princesses, the empress, and the heir-apparent altogether perished (456). p.830 This statement means that Ho’s family and clan were exterminated ; indeed, Szĕ-ma Ts‘ien’s biographical notice about Ho ends with these words :"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 336 « He was punished for the sexual intercourse of his son King-shing with the princess Yang-shih and for having made wu-ist ku, with extermination of his clan, so that he left no posterity (457). We have now to see in what way Kiang Ch‘ung ‘completed the calamity’. This man was in command of the Hunnish troops ; a bold, gigantic, martial figure, a high favourite of the emperor, who probably relied much on him for his personal safety. His biographer relates as follows : « It happened at that time, that Chu Ngan-shi of Yang-ling accused the minister Kung-sun Ho and his son the director of the Imperial Stud and Stables, of wu ku ; this intrigue involved the princesses Yang-shih and Chu-yih, and entailed the execution of Ho and his son. Later on, the emperor travelled to Kan-ts‘üen, and there fell ill. Kiang Ch‘ung seeing his great age, and feeling convinced that, should he die, the heir-apparent would put him to death, with felonious intent informed the emperor that the source of the devilry which caused the disease from which he was suffering, was wu ku. And His Majesty commissioned him to take measures against that wu ku. Now Kiang Ch‘ung had the ground dug up by his Hunnish wu, to seek for human images ; those men seized breeders of ku and nocturnal sacrificers ; they saw the spectres ; they defiled the ground (with sacrificial spirits) so as to make suspicious places. They continuously arrested people, examined them, belaboured them with hot iron tongs, and roasted them to extort confessions ; and those people consequently falsely accused each other of using wu ku ; officials were continually incriminated with rebellion ; those who fled or were condemned and put to death amounted, from the beginning to the end of that period, to tens of thousands. All that time, the aged emperor was suspecting his whole entourage of ku practices, imprecations and spells. Nobody, either among the guilty or the innocent, ventured to complain to him about the wrongs inflicted.

Then digging for ku in the mansion of the heir-apparent, he found in the ground an image of t’ung wood. The prince, fearing that he would now be unable to clear himself of guilt, arrested Kiang Ch‘ung, and beheaded him with his own hand, exclaiming reproachfully : — Slave from Chao 1, is it not enough that you have once before created discord between your Sovereign and his son ? would you do so once more ! How the prince was then worsted is related in the Traditions concerning him. Afterwards Wu was informed that Kiang Ch‘ung had deceived him, and exterminated his three clans (458) — that of himself, of his mother, and his wife. The heir-apparent, named Li, had already been appointed as successor to the throne in 122 B. C., when seven years old. Those Traditions concerning him contain the following lines : p.832 « In the last years of Wu’s reign the empress Wei lost the imperial favour. Kiang Ch‘ung intrigued against her, for there was a breach between them, and also between him and the heir-apparent, so that he had to fear that after the death of the emperor he would be put to death by the prince. Hence, when the wu ku incident occurred, Ch‘ung availed himself of it for his felonious work. At that time the emperor was of great age, and, spontaneously inclined to imagine evil, suspected the whole of his immediate entourage of working with ku, imprecations and spells. Drastic measures were taken ; the minister Kung-sun Ho and his son, the imperial princesses Yang-shih and Chu-yih, the empress and her younger brother’s son Wei Khang, vassal of Ch‘ang-p’ing, were all found guilty and put to death. This is recorded in the Traditions about Kung-sun Ho and Kiang Ch‘ung.  1 Kiang Ch‘ung was from Han-tan in the Chao principality, now in Chihli province."},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 338 While taking his measures in that wu ku affair, Kiang Ch‘ung, well acquainted with the emperor’s suspicions, told him that there prevailed an influence of ku within the Palace. He invaded the Palace, penetrated even into the imperial halls, demolished the throne, and dug up the ground beneath it. And the emperor ordered Han Yueh, vassal of Ngan-tao, as also the co-minister Chang Kan, and the Yellow Gate officer Su Wen, to assist Ch‘ung in his work. Ch‘ung also went to the mansion of the heir-apparent, dug there for ku, and found a doll of t’ung wood in the ground. The emperor being ill, had retired from the heat into the Kan-ts‘üen palace, and nobody was in the capital except the empress and the heir-apparent. The prince then called Shih Teh, his second Instructor. This grandee, being the tutor of the heir-apparent, felt himself also in danger of life, and therefore gave the prince the following advice : — The late minister and his son, the two princesses, and Her Majesty Wei have been punished with death for this affair, and now the wu and the retainers have found a damning piece of evidence in the ground ; we do not know whether they themselves have hidden it therein, or whether it really was there, and you will have no means of explaining the matter ; therefore avail yourself of your warrant : arrest Ch‘ung and his crew, put them in prison, and take drastic measures against their felony and fraud. The emperor is ill and in Kan-ts‘üen ; the empress and her officials have applied to him for orders, and have not received any answer, so that we do not even know whether he is alive or dead, and felonious ministers are availing themselves of this occasion. Crown-prince, p.833 have you forgotten the incident of Fu-su 1 of the Ts‘in dynasty ? Without any hesitation the heir-apparent followed this advice, and in the second year of the Ching hwo period (B.

The vassal of Ngan-tao, Han Yueh, thought that those delegates were deceiving him, and refused to surrender to the order of the prince, wherefore they slew him. The co-minister Chang Kan was wounded, but escaped with his life, and sought refuge in Kan-ts‘üen. That same night the crown-prince sent his chamberlain Wu Tsü with a warrant into the Wei-ying palace, and there, at the Ch‘ang-ts‘iu gate, by the agency of the chief attendant I-hwa, that delegate told the empress to remove the chariots from her stables and man them with archers, and to march out the soldiers of the military arsenals, as also the guards of the Ch‘ang-loh palace. Further the prince issued the following order to the body of officers : ‘Kiang Ch‘ung has revolted ; I have decapitated him, and scorched with fire his Hunnish wu in Shang-lin’. His adherents and guests placed themselves at the head of his partisans, and fought the minister Liu Khüh-li in Ch‘ang-ngan ; — this revolt is known as that of the crown-prince. As the populace would not side with him, his troops were worsted, but he escaped. The rage of the emperor was so great that all his subordinates were in anxiety and fear, not knowing how to escape it... The prince fled eastward to Hu (in the present Honan pr.), and concealed himself in the Ts‘üen-kiu hamlet. The man who sheltered him was poor, and for the time being provided for the wants of the prince by the sale of shoes. The prince had an old friend living in Hu, and hearing that he was well-to-do, sent somebody to call him, but this led to his discovery. Officials besieged the house in order to arrest him, and the prince, seeing that escape was impossible, entered his room, closed the door, and hanged himself. A young soldier of Shan-yang, Chang Fu-ch‘ang by name, kicked the door open, and one Li Sheu, secretary of the prefect of Sin-ngan, quickly clasped the prince in his arms and loosed him, while the owner of the house was killed in the struggle, and the two imperial grandsons also met with a violent end."},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol.

After some time, the wu ku affair was no more believed in by most people, and the emperor realised that the crown-prince had acted under no other impulse but fear ; and when Ch‘e Ts‘ien-ts‘iu had again lodged his accusations concerning the wrong done to the prince, the emperor raised that man to the dignity of minister, exterminated the whole family of Kiang Ch‘ung, and burned Su Wen on the Hung bridge (459). p.835 The chronological list of events of Wu’s reign states, that « the wu ku affair commenced in the first year of the Ching hwo period (92 B. C.) on the eleventh day of the eleventh month ; the minister Kung-sun Ho was imprisoned and executed in the first month of the next year, and the princesses Chu-yih and Yang-shih were executed for practising wu ku in the next intercalary month. In that summer the emperor sojourned in Kan-ts‘üen, and it was in autumn, in the seventh month, that the men of Han Yueh with Kiang Ch‘ung dug for ku in the palace of the prince. On the day jen-wu of that month the prince and the empress resolved to decapitate Kiang Ch‘ung, and by his authority troops were brought out, which fought so fiercely in Ch‘ang-ngan with the minister Liu Khüh-li, that some tens of thousands of people perished.

The emperor was at that time in retirement in the Kan-ts‘üen palace, owing to the heat. The chief secretary of the minister rode thither post-haste, to inform him of the state of matters. On the emperor asking him what the minister had done, the officer said : — He has hidden himself, and has not yet presumed to bring out troops. The emperor furiously exclaimed : — What do you say ? has he hidden himself, while such a turmoil is rife ? that minister utterly lacks the character of the ruler of Cheu, for did not the latter slay Kwan and Ts‘ai ? 1 He then gave him a sealed order for the minister, running thus : ‘For the catching and beheading of rebels there are, of course, rewards as well as punishments ; build armoured turrets on ox-cars, and do not engage hand to hand with swords, lest many soldiers be killed or wounded ; shut fast the city-gates, lest any rebels escape’. No sooner had the crown-prince slain Kiang Ch‘ung than he raised soldiers and issued a manifesto, in which he stated that the emperor was lying extremely ill in Kan-ts‘üen, and depraved ministers apparently were plotting rebellion. The emperor then travelled from Kan-ts‘üen to the Kien-chang palace, to the West of the city, and called to arms the troops in San-fu (the Metropolis and its environs) and the nearest districts, as also the ministers and commanders in the province who enjoyed a salary up to two thousand stones of rice.

The soldiers of the river squadron were also called to arms, and placed under the command of Shang-khiu Ch‘ing, the chief of the State Ceremonial. The warrants of the house of Han were red, but as the prince was using warrants thus coloured, others with a yellow yaktail upon it were now used instead, to distinguish them from his. p.838 The heir-apparent ordered Jen Ngan, Inspector of the army of the North, to march out this army ; but this grandee received the war-rant, closed the gate of his camp, and refused obedience to the prince.

He therefore invested them with the dignity of vassals, respectively of Chung-hioh, Teh, and Tu. The guests of the prince, who had passed through the palace-gates, were put to death ; those who had in the service of the prince levied troops for the rebellion were punished, in accordance with the laws, with extermination of their tribes, and all officials and warriors who had been pressed into the service of the prince were banished to the Tun-hwang province..... p.840 « In the next year, when Li Kwang-li, the generalissimo of ’Rh-shi (Nisā), marched out at the head of an army against the Huns, the minister offered him a parting meal, and accompanied him to the bridge across the Wei river.

Liu Khüh-li promised that he would do so. The prince of Chang-yih was the son of the harem lady Li, the generalissimo’s younger sister ; and the daughter of the generalissimo was the wife of Liu Khüh-li’s son ; both therefore had good reasons for desiring that appointment.

Wishing to cure the emperor of his mania and thus bring rest and consolation to the people, he and his co-ministers who drew a salary of two thousand stones of rice, presented to him a wish for his long life, with an eulogy of his virtues and excellence, and advice to show benevolence and out of compassion to remit the punishments....

More than a year after, the emperor fell ill, and appointed his son by the lady of the Keu-yih abode as crown-prince (463).  1 The private apartments of the empress were so called because the plaster of the walls was mixed with pepper to make them warm and fragrant. "},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 347 As this appointment occurred in the second month of the year 87 B. C. (464), we see that the emperor still refused to stop the persecution of sorcerers when two years and some months had elapsed since the rising in Ch‘ang-ngan. Probably it was not even discontinued until his death, which took place two days after the appointment of his successor. History further contains many pages which depict in sober terms the hellish cruelty with which the persecution was carried on. One chapter e. g. relates : « The heir-apparent had married the lady Shi, who had borne him an imperial grandson ; this prince married the lady Wang, who gave birth to the (future) emperor Süen. This boy was only a few months old when the wu ku incident occurred. The heir-apparent with his consort, and the imperial grandson with his consort Wang all lost their lives thereby, and the great-grandson, though in swaddling clothes, was nevertheless to be punished, and confined in the prison connected with the provincial building. But Ping Kih, an officer to the Chief Justice of the Court, when the measures against wu ku were also being applied within that building, took compassion on the innocence of the great-grandson, — and ordered two female exiles whose punishments had been remitted, namely Chao Ching-khing of Hwai-yang, and Hu Tsü of the city of Wei, to feed him in turn with their milk. And secretly he gave him clothing and food, and visited him, and showed him much kindness. The affair of the wu ku had lasted two years, and was not p.843 yet settled, when, in the second year of the Heu yuen period (87 B. C.), the emperor fell ill, and alternately resided in the Ch‘ang-yang and the Wu-tsoh palaces. A seer of influences then stated, that there prevailed in the prisons of Ch‘ang-ngan an influence which might produce a Son of Heaven. The emperor sent his delegates to repair to the various government gaols in the capital, and all the prisoners, whether they were there for slight offences or for heavy crimes, were put to death. Kwoh Jang, chief member of the Board of Revenue (?), came that night to the prison of the provincial building, but Ping Kih closed it, so that this delegate could not"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 348 enter. The great-grandson was thus saved by Ping Kih, because a general amnesty was proclaimed ; on which Ping Kih conveyed the great-grandson to the house of his grand-mother and the lady Shi (465). And thus was saved the life of a child destined to mount the throne in 73 B. C., after the death of Wu’s successor. From a biography of Ping Kih in the Books of the Early Han Dynasty we learn, that Kwoh Jang entered a complaint about his conduct ; but the emperor saw the finger of heaven in what he had done, and promulgated a general amnesty. And thus « the inmates of that prison owed their lives to Ping Kih only (466). After all it can hardly appear unnatural that in those bloody years the capital actually swarmed with spies and police, specially p.844 appointed to hunt down sorcerous conspirators. The Standard History states, « that chiefs of underlings and judges were appointed by Wu in the fourth year of the Ching hwo period (B. C. 89), who were bearers of warrants, and attached to the offices of the capital. Their followers were twelve hundred in number ; they arrested people engaged in wu ku, and searched for rebellious and seditious folks. Afterwards they were abolished (467). Wu ku cabals seem to have thereupon been of frequent occurrence. We read that even the son of that same Han Yueh who assisted Kiang Ch‘ung and was slain by the friends of the crown-prince (page 832), was implicated in such sorcery, and that his tribe then had a narrow escape from extermination : « Han Yueh found ku in the ground in the palace of the heir-apparent, and was slain by this prince. His son Hing, who inherited his dignity, was found guilty of wu ku and was put to death ; but the emperor decided, that whereas (his father) the Yiu-kih general had lost his life in the imperial service, nobody should be condemned along with this culprit (468), that is to say, his family or clan should not be exterminated. "},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 349 A terrible court-cabal of the same kind occurred under the Later Han dynasty. « Yin, the consort of the emperor Hwo, was promoted to the dignity of empress in the eighth year of the Yung yuen period (A, D. 96). Her maternal grandmother Teng Chu had access to the Palace apartments. In the summer of the fourteenth year of that period it was reported to the Throne that the empress with Teng Chu were engaged in wu ku sorcery. The matter thus being betrayed, the emperor commissioned his palace adjutant Chang Shen and the chancellor Ch‘en Pao to examine them by various means of torture in the prisons of the Palace, and pass sentence on them. The depositions of Teng Chu, her two sons Fung and I, and three younger brothers of the empress, named Yih, Fu, and Ch‘ang, were collated, and they were admitted to have p.845 sacrificed with imprecations and spells, and therefore to be guilty of high-treason and heterodoxy. Fung, I, and Fu died in gaol under the torture inflicted on them to extort confession. The empress was transported to the T‘ung, palace, where she died of sorrow ; her father committed suicide, and Yih and Ch‘ang, together with Teng Chu’s whole family, were banished to Jih-nan, in the Pi-king district.

V 350 « the law against rebellion prescribed that those venturing to employ ku against others, or inducing people to do so, were to be put to death and mutilated in the market (470). No doubt the crime was combined with theft or robbery, for, p.846 as Yü Pao of the fourth century teaches us, ku was a source of wealth for its breeders. « In the Yung-yang principality (in the present province of Honan) there lived a family of the Liao tribe, which had become wealthy by engaging for many generations in the breeding of ku. Afterwards one of its members married a bride, whom they did not tell about those practices. Once when they had all gone out, leaving her alone to take care of the house, her eyes fell upon a large vase in one of the rooms. She raised the cover, and seeing a big snake in the vase, boiled some water, which. she poured into it to kill the beast. On the return of the family she told them what she had done, thereby throwing them into fright and sorrow. Not long after this they all died to a man of a contagious disease (471). Thus, according to this tale, the ku turns itself against its breeders should they harm it, or neglect to protect it properly. Yü Pao also teaches us, that its reptiles or insects may do their work in the shape of quite other animals, as e. g. dogs ; which cannot surprise us, knowing that metamorphoses of animals into others are, in the opinion of the Chinese, most common phenomena : « In P‘o-yang (in the north of the present Kiangsi pr.) one Chao Shen kept canine ku. Once, when he was called on by Ch‘en Ch‘en, six or seven big yellow dogs rushed out at this man, all at once barking at him. And when my paternal uncle, on coming home, had a meal with Chao Sheu’s wife, he spit blood, and was saved from death in the nick of time by a drink prepared from minced stalks of an orange-tree.

The physician opined that he was stricken by ku, and secretly, without informing him of it, strewed some jang-ho root under his sleeping-mat. The patient then madly exclaimed : — The ku which devours me is ceasing to spread ; and then he cried : — It vanishes little by little. The present generations often make use of jang-ho root to conquer ku, and now and then it has a good effect. Some think it is ‘the efficacious herb’ (473), mentioned in the Cheu li (see page 826). Ch‘en Tsang-khi, the distinguished authority on Materia Medica in the eighth century, whose writings we have already quoted many times, was no stranger to the secrets of ku sorcery. « It was, he says, a stupid characteristic of the ancients to make ku. People bent on the acquisition of wealth put all sorts of insects or reptiles into a jar, and when a year had passed away they opened it, to find only one insect or reptile which had devoured the others to the last. This one they called ku. It could render itself as invisible as spectres or spirits, and when it inflicted injury on any one, he died. When such an insect or reptile has killed a man by its bites, it happens that it comes forth from the apertures of his body ; and if it is then watched and caught, and dried in the sun, it becomes a source of evil (474). In an interesting work on men and things of the southern provinces in the twelfth century we find the following lines : p.848 « In Kwangsi there are two kinds of ku poison, respectively killing quickly or slowly, that is to say, in a few moments or in half a year.

V 352 him with respect before the eyes of the world, but secretly tries to harm him (with ku). In the years keng-ch‘en of the Khien tao period (A. D. 1170-1172) there lived to the east of the chief city of Khin-cheu a seller of rice-gruel, who bred ku poison. The secret was discovered and he confessed his crime, relating that, when they made that venom at home, his wife, having stripped herself quite naked and untied her hair, sacrificed at night ; they then prepared a bowl of rice-gruel, upon which grasshoppers, butterflies and hundreds of insects came down from above the house to eat, the things they left behind or dropped being used by them as poison. Should any one wish to assure himself whether a house contains ku poison, he has only to enter, and if he finds no dust in it neither above nor below, it is such a house. Whenever Li-t‘ung or Khi-t‘ung people set out wine to regale guests, it is customary for the host to taste of it first, to show them that they need not have any suspicions (475). Another author of the Sung dynasty wrote : « Of the ku poison mentioned in classical writings several varieties exist. In Kwangtung and Kwangsi the mountaineers make it of various insects and vipers, which they put into a pot or bowl to devour each other till only one survives, which they then call the ku. They use the poison of this animal to harm men, putting it for this purpose into their wine or food. When any one is affected by such poison, it produces in him cramps at his heart and in his belly, and a feeling as if some beast were gnawing thereat, he both vomits and passes a bloody liquid resembling rotten meat, and unless he places himself under medical treatment p.849 without delay, his five viscera are devoured, and he dies. There are slow and quick diseases of this kind ; the latter are acute and entail death in some ten days ; the others may last a year, during which the poison circulates through the patient’s whole belly. Respiration stops, strength wanes, the bones become heavy and the joints stiffen ; and no sooner does the disease manifest its presence than the heart and the belly perform their functions with undue haste,"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 353 while all the food which the patient takes changes into ku, which, slowly corroding his principal vitals and his viscera, causes his death. And when he is dead, the disease spreads its contagion to others, thus forming a source of ku. The way to ascertain its presence is to let the patient spit in water, for he suffers of ku or not according as the spittle sinks or floats. Or he may take a big pea in his mouth, and see whether it swells up and its skin becomes loose, in which case he is a victim of ku ; but he is not so if the pea does not become soft, nor sheds its skin. Another method is, to place the skin of a kuh bird under the patient’s sleeping-place without letting him know it, for ku is at work or not, according as the disease then increases in intensity or not (476). Authors of the Ming dynasty, in writing of ku, generally copy the statements of earlier authors, so that, evidently, in their time these black art practices in the main continued in the old ways. p.850 A few new particulars are given us by Leu Ying ; « In the hilly regions of Kwangtung and Kwangsi the people keep in one pot snakes and vipers, centipedes, millipedes, frogs, and all sorts of insects and reptiles, to make them devour each other ; the one that conquers all the rest is, they think, possessed of spiritual power (ling), and they therefore sacrifice to it. They put its poison into vegetables, fruits, or other food and drink, with which they then do harm to others, thus recklessly trying to establish their own happiness and to become rich and honoured. If a man is hit by such sorcery, the symptoms manifest themselves in ten thousand forms, and it happens that in one year many people perish by it. There are families who offer incense and sacrifices (to that vermin) in the same way as they do to their domestic ancestors. It is also called ku. The sickness caused by it the world calls ku disease ; this may vary, in connexion with the clan-names, according to the five musical notes, so that five varieties of ku are mentioned. All such things are common in depraved and vicious border countries, but in the capital I have seldom heard of them (477)."},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 354 Li Shi-chen says, that « there exists in the southern regions ku of lizards, of beetles which lay their eggs in dung-balls which they roll up, and of crickets, of gold caterpillars, and of herbs, as also ku which draws out life, and yet other poisons, and that every region has so many remedies against them that it is impossible to put down all these in writing. According to Ts‘ai T‘ao’s Ts‘ung hwa 1, gold caterpillars first existed in the Shuh region (Szĕ-ch‘wen), and only in recent times did they p.851 find their way into Hukwang (i. e. Hupeh and Hunan), Fuhkien, Kwangtung, and Kwangsi, gradually becoming very general there (478). Our knowledge of the matter is also increased by the following notice concerning the Kwang-cheu region : « The T‘ung people (?) breed poison in the following way : on the fifth day of the fifth moon (the theoretical apogee of summer heat) they collect all sorts of reptiles and insects, none bigger than snakes or smaller than lice, and place them in a pot, to devour each other ; and the last that remains they keep, and let it loose against men to kill them. If it is a snake that remains, they speak of snake-ku ; if it is a louse, they call it louse-ku ; it devours the five intestines of the victims, who all die of the consequences. They also have flying poisons, the one called ‘that which draws out life’, and the other ‘the gold caterpillar’ ; these are men-poisoning spectres. Those who employ them soon become rich. The flying poison of these spectres enters into food and drink, and when such cooked things then enter a belly, the spectre revives therein and inflates the victim till he bursts, thus causing his death. It is also called ‘that which severs the vitals’, and when such vegetable food has entered the mouth, death follows immediately. Accordingly, when rich people, who occupy themselves with such practices,  1 That is to say, the T‘ieh-wei shan ts‘ung t‘an, probably written in the first half of the twelfth century, for which see infra, page 868. The quotation occurs in its sixth chapter. "},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 355 behave as spendthrifts, then indeed severe measures may be taken against them, and whereas the crime in question flourishes in every way and is practised very commonly, good governors and rulers are to take prompt measures against it (479). p.852 The animals or animal-spectres let loose by sorcerers upon their victims are far from attacking these always in mysterious, covert ways. « When the scholar Chu I-jen was a clerk in Khing-yuen in the province of Kwangsi, the prefect Ch‘en Hi-fang engaged him as his private secretary. Now it came to pass in the hottest time of the year that the prefect gave a drinking-feast to his colleagues and friends. On going to table, they put off their caps (on account of the heat), and saw a big frog squatting on the top of Chu’s head. They knocked the beast off, which vanished as soon as it came down to the ground. They drank till midnight, and then the frog crawled up again on to Chu’s head without his perceiving it ; they knocked it off as before, and as it fell on the table, the dainties and nuts all fell to pieces, while the beast disappeared. When Chu retired into his room, he felt an ulcer come up on his head. Next day all the hair on his crown had fallen out, and on the spot a swelling like a wen with a red skin had appeared ; suddenly it broke, and a frog peeped out of it, its two fore-legs resting on the crown of the head, and its hind legs remaining hidden in the skin. They pricked it with a needle, but it did not die ; they pulled at it, but this gave the patient intolerable suffering, and the physicians had to desist. Then an old gate-keeper said : ‘this is a case of ku ; the beast must die if you prick it with a hair-pin of gold’. They tried it, and with success. The frog was extracted from the head, and Chu suffered nothing more ; but in his skull-bone a sunken place remained, resembling a bowl with its opening upwards (480). p.853 Evidently there is no reason for surprise that snakes, grubs, and such-like vermin are especially selected by the Chinese to be let loose against people in order to poison them, or to corrode their vitals and intestines : indeed, destructive worms and tetters, which, so frequently exist in man, must be easily identified by simple ignorance with gnawing vermin of similar shape"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 356 living outside his body. This explains why grubs living in the ground, in trees and in wood, as also maggots which destroy food and other things, are often denoted by the character ku. We have seen on page 827 that the physician of Ts‘in declared that corn-destroying insects were called ku. And we read in the Shuh i ki, that « towards the end of the reign of the Tsin dynasty, King-cheu was visited by prolonged rains, so that the paddy changed into ku, and ku thus harmed the people (481). Finally we may remind the reader, that snakes are prominent among the devils which infest and kill men by feeding on their intestines (page 620). We have seen that printed evidence concurs in pointing in particular to the southern provinces of China as breeding-places of ku. Now what are the gold caterpillars of which (see pp.850-851) Li Shi-chen speaks in terms which show that these insects in his time played a prominent part in this branch of sorcery ? Statements about them, which we have found in books, by no means satisfy our curiosity. Our attempts to procure a specimen in China have all been vain, our male and female acquaintances always declaring it impossible to get one ; evidently they regarded our request to find one for us as evidence of a suspicion that sorcery was practised by them. I had to content myself with the information, scanty but unanimous, that a gold caterpillar is a very venomous little snake or viper, worm, or larva of a bright yellow colour, perhaps luminiferous or phosphorescent. The insect is mentioned by an author as early as the eighth century : « Ch‘en Ts‘ang-khi says, that ashes of old flowered silk are a cure for poison of ku of insects or reptiles which eat such silk. His commentator adds, that those insects are coiled up like a finger-ring, and eat old red silk and flowered silk, just as caterpillars eat leaves ; hence, considered in the light of the present day, those p.854 insects are gold caterpillars (482). Thus wrote Li Shi-chen in his great standard work on Materia Medica. An author of the Sung dynasty asserts,"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 357 « that a gold caterpillar is a caterpillar with a gold colour, which is fed with silk from Shuh (Szĕ-ch‘wen). Its ordure, put in food or drink, poisons those who take it, causing certain death. It can draw towards a man the possessions of such victims, and thus make him enormously rich. It is extremely difficult to get rid of it, for even water, fire, weapons or swords can do it no harm. Usually the owner for this purpose puts some gold or silver into a basket, places the caterpillar also therein, and throws the basket away in a corner of the street, where some one may pick it up and take it with him. He is then said to have given his gold caterpillar in marriage (483). The great object connected with the keeping of such an insect, viz. the appropriation of the possessions of its victims, therefore is no other than that pursued by the grandees and ladies at Court under the Sui dynasty, who occupied themselves with sorcery by means of cats. This is brought out also by the following tale from a work of the Sung dynasty, which moreover, supplies us with some more particulars on the subject : « Tseu Lang, a literary graduate of the highest rank at Ch‘i-cheu (in the present Nganhwui), was indigent, but careful about his conduct. One day intending to go to the outer borough, he opened his door in the cool morning hour, when his eyes fell upon a small basket of bamboo, which stood outside the gate. As it was not sealed or locked, he opened it, and saw several dozen silver wine-cups, weighing about a hundred ounces. The silence of early morning still lay upon the street, so that there was nobody to follow him or lay hands on him ; so he took the basket home, and said to his wife : — These things have come hither p.855 without being brought by a man ; can they be a present bestowed on us by Heaven ? No sooner had he pronounced these words than he felt a crawling insect upon his left thigh, and saw there something glittering like bright gold. It was a caterpillar ; he plucked it off and flung it away, but in less time than it took him to draw back his hand it"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 358 was again on the same spot. He crushed it under his foot, but though thus reduced to atoms, it re-appeared on his breast and belly ; he flung it into the water, he cast it into a fire, he cut it with a knife and hacked it with an axe, but it could be harmed in no way whatever, and was everywhere, on the mats and coverlets of his bed, in his food and drink. Lang, whom the matter extremely annoyed, consulted a friend of his, a man of knowledge. — My son, this person said, you have been sold ; this is what we call a gold caterpillar ; thus even our own village is visited by this evil ! When the thing is still small, it call bring calamity, but when full-sized, it enters into the belly and there gnaws away the intestines and the stomach. This explanation enhanced Lang’s fears so much that he confessed he had picked up the basket. — I know all about the matter, replied the friend ; if you employ the insect, you will become enormously rich ; every day it devours four inches of flowered silk from Shuh, and if you gather its ordure and dry and pulverize it, a little quantity of the powder, placed in food or drink, is sure to kill him who takes it ; the insect can then appropriate whatever it likes, and, to reward you, will bring to you every day the possessions of the victims. But Lang smiled : — To think that I should ever do such things ! said he. — I know that p.856 you will not, the friend replied, but what else is to be done ? — I shall put it in the basket again, with the other things that were therein, and throw it away, then it will do no harm. — But, retorted the friend, when some one has kept this insect and been enriched thereby, he is obliged, in order to send it away, to add to the things he found on it twice as much by way of interest ;"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol.

And, poor as you are, how would you find that interest ? Verily, I pity you. Upon these words Lang lifted up his eyes to Heaven. Sighing and panting he said : — In all my life I have cultivated purity of conduct ; never, I swear it, have I lost my purity, and yet I am so unhappy that such a thing should befall me ! He went home, and said to his wife : — I must employ it, there being no way to get rid of it, but this I cannot do, and therefore my only resort is death ; matters of this sort are better remitted to the life here-after. With these words he grasped the insect, threw it into his mouth, and swallowed it. The whole family ran to the rescue, but they came too late. His wife and children wailed most bitterly, exclaiming that he was sure to die ; but some days elapsed, and no evil befell him. He ate and drank as usual, and a month later nothing had happened. Finally he died at a great age 1. p.857 Our knowledge of the natural history of the gold caterpillar is enlarged a little by an author who assures us that it may also be found within precious stones. « A man in Tan-yang, on recovering an inscribed stone tablet from under a pile of stones, found a round pebble. He ground and polished it, thus discovering that it consisted of two layers, one fitting upon the other. Grinding it off to the site of a fist, he split it up, and out came an insect resembling a grub, able to wriggle. As nobody could distinctly make out what kind of thing it was, he threw it away ; but afterwards he was told, that men, if greedy of wealth, can do no better than get a gold caterpillar out of a stone  1 Moh-fu yen hien luh, a work from the Sung dynasty, in ten chapters, by Pih Chang-siün."},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 360 and breed it up, precious things then coming to him spontaneously 1. So much for written information about gold caterpillars. It is far from satisfying our curiosity. It will not be superfluous therefore to subjoin some notions prevailing on the subject among the people at the present day, collected especially from the lips of women and matrons in Amoy and the surrounding districts. A gold caterpillar is a true Jack-of-all-trades. It can spin, weave and sew, plough, sow and reap, in a word, it turns its hand to work of whatever kind with a most wonderful display of dexterity. In the house where it is kept, women merely have to stretch a few warp threads on a loom, to find the whole web finished to perfection before the next morning dawns. If its master is a farmer, p.858 he has to thrust his spade into the ground only once or twice, to find in less than no time the whole field ploughed, sown and harrowed. Thus the man or woman, who has a caterpillar at command, soon becomes wealthy. But the owner must feed and regale the insect carefully, and constantly pour scoldings and abuse upon it, lest it turn lazy and impudent, and in the end renounce obedience and submission altogether ; or, to put it in words of our own, to compel it to an implicit obedience it must be intimidated by means of spells, fascination, and songs of sorcery. Such assertions are believed generally by men and women of the lower class, to whom nothing wonderful is incredible. Superstition enforces also an implicit belief in the general tale that the insect from time to time demands a human victim to prey on, and is formally allowed by its keeper to attack one. It then slowly devours that victim to the bones and skin, nay, there are rumours abroad of its having left nothing more than the hard skeleton. Women tell how an owner of a gold caterpillar occasionally decoys a victim into his house and into the room where the insect is kept, there to let him be a prey to its murderous attacks, and how many a child or adult thus disappears mysteriously : no very rare occurrence, in fact, in a country where trade in female slaves is in a thriving state.  1 Wu seh sien or ‘Threads of five Colours’, two chapters of jottings and tales from an unknown author who probably lived under the Sung dynasty.

V 361 But, like so many crimes, these murders are often punished by august Heaven, should the soul of the victim denounce the perpetrator before its throne. Breeders of ku and caterpillars may therefore expect never to beget any male descendants, or, if they have any, to see them die. This severest of all celestial punishments may be accelerated by a flash of lightning from a serene, cloudless sky, destroying the sinner, his family and house, together with his caterpillar or vermin-pot. Public opinion further argues, that fear of such vindicatory intervention on the part of the highest power in the Universe over-balances in the end the sorcerer’s passion for wealth, rendering him anxious to rid himself of the caterpillar. We have seen that he can do so by placing it somewhere in the street, hidden under such things of value as may entice another to take it to his home. Many keep a caterpillar in an invisible shape : it is, in fact, possible to lodge its spirit in an incense-burner filled with ashes of incense-sticks which the owner puts in from time to time as a sacrifice to the beast. When a censer is seen abandoned in a street, in some obscure corner, in a field, or between boulders, or in any other p.859 unfrequented spot, people are immediately ready to conclude that it has been put there by some sorcerer or sorceress, anxious to be rid of a caterpillar. In south-east Fuhkien few spectres are known so well by the people, and believed in so generally as the gold caterpillars. In Amoy and its surroundings it is called kim ts‘ng, and heard of by old and young, and it is probable that it would be difficult to find a woman there who does not deem the whole male and female world, except herself and a few others, capable of practising witchcraft with it, should it suit their purpose. There is accordingly always some danger in putting up in a little frequented inn. Should circumstances bring any one there, prudence warns him to smear some mud off his feet on the wall, and see whether it disappears, the presence of a gold caterpillar being in this case. indubitable ; the spectre indeed is bent on cleanliness, and wipes away all coarse dirt it sees, thus readily betraying its presence. In this way it is explained why in so many inns the walls look as muddy as even the floor, but we think that the general uncleanliness of the people may better account for this fact."},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 362 The Code of Laws mentions a sentence, passed by the Throne on appeal in 1792 against « commoner of the Yung-fuh district (in Kwangsi), named Hü Kien-fang, who, giving ear to the instigations of one Ch‘en T‘ing-chang, had lodged a false accusation against Liao Chung-hang, stating that this man had induced Loh Fah-ts‘üen and others to let loose ku upon his mother, madam Hü, born of the Liu family, which lady had thereupon hung herself with fatal result (484). The Code devotes two special titles to the subject of sorcery, thus proving that the high government of China is to the present hour not less a slave to the belief in its reality and dreadful consequences than the humblest among its subjects. Like the laws of the Han dynasty (see p. 845), it threatens with punishments of great severity those who venture to rear such noxious breed or have it in their houses. « Whoever (procures or) makes, (hides) or keeps ku poison which may serve for destruction of human life, as also he who instructs or tells others to do so, shall be decapitated, (even though he has not yet actually used it to kill). The property of the maker or breeder p.860 shall be forfeited to the magistrates ; his wife, children, and all those living in his house, even though ignorant of the matter, shall be banished for life to the distance of two thousand miles 1, to remain there for ever. If the ku poison has poisoned a person living in the same house, the parents and wife of the victim, his concubines, sons and grandsons, if ignorant of the preparation of the ku, are not liable to be sent into exile ; (those among them who knew of it shall be banished, even if they were injured by the poison). And each chief of the ward or village, when privy to the crime and failing to give information of it to the authorities, shall receive one hundred blows with the long stick, but he shall not be punished if  1 The reasoning is, of course, that those relations ought to have known of the matter and checked it.

V 363 he was ignorant thereof. He who informs against and arrests the culprit shall be rewarded by the authorities with twenty ounces of silver (485). These laws can boast of a respectable age, as we find them in the Code of the Ming dynasty 1 in exactly the same terms, save for the bracketed interpolations. The laws of the Yuen dynasty prescribed the condemnation of ku breeders in these emphatic words : « those who make ku poison and injure men with it shall be put to death (486). It is worth notice that the Code of the present dynasty and that of Ming place the quoted articles immediately before that which threatens with decapitation the poisoning of men with vegetable or mineral substances ; evidently then legislators of p.861 both dynasties considered ku to be the most common and typical mode of poisoning. Among the notes inserted in that same title of the Code of Laws for instruction of the mandarins when administering justice we find one which sheds a few rays of new light upon our subject. « The writings studied by us mention numerous species of ku poison, but, generally speaking, compounders of poisonous ku have ku of snakes, of geese, of babies, of gold caterpillars, and other matter. When a man is poisoned with ku, he is sure to die within a fixed time, but his time may also come after some years. More poisonous than any other is ku of gold caterpillars ; it inevitably kills those who are injured by it. It occurs in Fuhkien, Kwang-tung and Kwangsi, Szĕ-ch‘wen and Kweicheu (487). Such ku ‘of babies’ may perhaps be the sorcery with which the next chapter will occupy us. About ku ‘of geese’ we know nothing ; we have never found any reference to it in a book, nor ever caught a word concerning it from the lips of the people. May we venture to suggest that geese, which greedily devour vipers, worms and grubs, are fed on such reptiles and insects, and  1 See also in chapter 129 of the Ta Ming hwui tien."},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 364 their souls then are induced by means of spells or other expedients to poison enemies or otherwise to afflict and kill them ? Remedies for ku @ The terror, with which ku sorcery has filled the hearts of the Chinese of all ages, has caused them to invent many quack medicines and prophylactics to annul its effects. All the leading therapists declare these effects to be merely infection with ‘poison’, against which antidotes of any kind may be efficacious. The long list of antidotes which the Chinese possess cannot, however, be reviewed here, but only the remedies which are used against ku poison in particular may occupy our attention. Ku or wu ku being very ancient in China, medical authors p.862 at an early date occupied themselves with the art of curing its effects. In the medical book ascribed to Koh Hung we read these lines : « A patient hurt by ku gets cutting pains at his heart and belly as if some living thing is gnawing there ; sometimes he has a discharge of blood through the mouth or the anus. If he is not forthwith medically treated, it devours his five viscera, which entails his death. To discover whether it is ku or not, let the patient spit into water ; if the spittle sinks, it is ku ; if it floats, it is not. The recipe for discovering the name of the owner of the ku poison is as follows : take the skin of a drum, burn it, a small piece at a time, pulverize the ashes, and let the patient drink them with water ; he will then forthwith mention the name ; then bid this owner forthwith to remove the ku, and the patient will recover immediately. Again place some jang-ho leaves secretly under the mattress of the patient ; he will then of his own accord immediately mention the name of the owner of the ku (488). After this introductory wisdom, Koh Hung mentions a series of general antidotes to cure sufferers of ku and other poison, also by making them"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 365 vomit. His magical method for discovering the evil-doer is recommended also in nearly the same words by Sun Szĕ-moh. This author moreover says : « There are people who mix the ku ingredients with snake-saliva, and then put them into the food or drink of others, thus giving them belly-disease ; this is a method which causes death after several years. Medicines for curing its effects exist for each special case. That method is practised among the mountaineers in Kiang-nan ; this fact cannot be doubted (489). p.863 Having stated that a man can be poisoned in a thousand different ways, our learned doctor goes on to say : « This is the reason why he who leaves his house should always carry about him ‘male yellow’, musk, and ‘animated cinnabar’, which are the chief medicines for averting evil ; neither the hundreds of kinds of ku, nor any cat-spectres, nor any fox-devils or spirits of old men and beasts will then ever presume to touch him. To people who would nourish their vital spirits it is of great moment to bear these things in mind (490). In a list of recipes following on these pieces of sage advice, there are two ingredients which attract attention, viz. centipedes, and so many mei or portions of spotted or striped cats. These animals have to the present hour held their place in the Pharmacopoea as destroyers of poison and ku. The centipede ( tsih-tsü, or wu-kung) simply owes the above attribute to an old belief that it is a destroyer of snakes. There may be truth in this belief, seeing that snakes may be small and Chinese centipedes large, especially in the south, where I have seen specimens almost two feet in length. There are there fabulous centipedes of enormous length. The belief in the snake-destroying virtue of the insect may, however, simply come from a passage in the writings of Liu Ngan, which is to this effect : « The moon illumines the whole world under heaven, and yet it is eclipsed by a toad (believed to dwell in it) ; — a snake ascending to the sky and coursing through the fogs yet is endangered by a tsih-tsü (491)."},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 366 A tsih-tsü may have meant some other animal in the time when Liu Ngan wrote, but posterity has simply accepted it as a centipede. The writings of Koh Hung teach us that in his time the belief that centipedes were snake-killers had given them a position in Chinese life as charms against snakes. « People in the southern countries always when they enter the hills carry a bamboo tube p.864 with living centipedes, for when these feel themselves in the neighbourhood of snakes, they forthwith stir in the tube ; and if the traveller then looks attentively into the shrubs, he is sure to see a snake. Even a snake of a chang in length and more than a span thick may, if perceived by a centipede and kept in restraint by its breath or influence, die immediately. If a snake perceives a centipede in a cliff, it will, even if it is the larger, flee to the deep bottom of the brook in the ravine, where the centipede will keep it in restraint by merely remaining afloat on the surface ; and if then we see something which is quite blue and as large as the flat top of a ceremonial cap dive right out into the water towards the snake, this will immediately come to the surface and die. Hence it is that the southerners pulverize centipedes and treat snake-bites therewith, which then are forthwith cured (492). The belief in centipedes as destroyers of snakes may be further illustrated by the following tale from a book of the eleventh century : « My grand-uncle has seen somewhere in the country a centipede chasing a big snake with great velocity. The snake shot across a brook, but the centipede followed it, and the snake, knowing itself inferior in strength and unable to escape, turned round, and with wide-opened jaws awaited its pursuer. The centipede at once ran into its mouth, and in a moment the snake was dead ; the centipede then bored its way through the belly, and came out through the flank. They cut open the snake, and found its bowels gone 1 (493). p.865  1 Mih khoh hwui si, a work in ten chapters by Peng Shing of the eleventh century."},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 367 As a destroyer of ku, we see the centipede appear in writings as early as the fourth or fifth century, at least if the following tale, occurring in the collection of T‘ao Ts‘ien, is not an interpolation of a later period : « T‘an-yiu was a man who walked in the path of salvation, a Çramana of a pure, ascetic mode of life. There was in the district of Yen a family which employed ku, so that none of those who partook of their food or drink escaped without vomiting blood and dying. T‘an-yin called on them, and the master of the house placed food before him ; but T‘an-yiu had recourse to his usual spells and vows, and — a pair of centipedes more than a foot in length jumped out of the dish and ran off. He ate his fill, and went home, quite comfortable and without any ill consequences (494). As a pharmaceutical ingredient, the centipede mostly occurs in apothecary’s shops in a dried state. Its segments are grated to powder and drunk with water, together with other medical matter ; sometimes they are roasted before being pulverized. The legs are removed as useless. If the poison produces boils and ulcers, the application of such powder in ointment of hogs’ lard is recommended, and so are ablutions with water or oil in which a centipede has been steeped for several days. Ingredients obtained from other snake-killing or snake-devouring animals are, as we might have anticipated, likewise valued as medicines against ku. So e. g. musk, because, as Koh Hung says, ‘the musk-deer as well as the wild pig devours snakes’ (495). Musk is used internally in a large number of antidotes, and is, moreover, strongly recommended as an ingredient for amulets and medicines for various demoniacal diseases. Cats, too, prey on snakes, toads and frogs ; no wonder then that (see p. 863) Sun Szĕ-moh recommended, as a remedy against ku, small pieces of spotted or striped p.866 cats. Pharmacologists have quite a series of recipes into the composition of which everything that can be got from cats may enter as chief operative ingredient. The Wei sheng i kien fang 1, Easy and simplified Recipes for the Protection of Life, says :  1 Its author, Hu Yung, flourished as an officer in the first half of the fifteenth century."},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 368 « As a preservative against ku poison, flesh of cats must be eaten from an early age ; then ku cannot do any harm. « Are we, asks Li Shi-chen on mentioning this passage, to think here of ku mentioned by the Books of the Sui Dynasty as a barbarous cat-spectre practice (496) ? (see p. 610). This famous medical man evidently suspected here an application of some similia similibus method. Further he wrote : « Bone from a cat’s head cures demoniacal malady, ku poison, and pains in the heart and belly (497). The reptiles and insects used in ku sorcery devour each other ; consequently, ku poison too is destroyed by those creatures. Ch‘en Tsang-khi wrote : « In general reptiles and insects, which are used to make ku, are cures for ku ; therefore, if we know what ku is at work, we may remedy its effects. Against ku of snakes that of centipedes should be used, against ku of centipedes that of frogs, against ku of frogs that of snakes, and so on. Those varieties of ku, having the power of subduing each other, may also have a curative effect (498). The reader sees that this theory is simple ; but it seems not so simple to discover which or what animal has caused the poisoning. Medical men do not tell us how to do that. The conviction that Heaven in his righteous wrath sometimes strikes sorcerers and their ku with his thunder, has created the belief that powder of so called ‘thunderbolt stones’ or ‘thunder-nodules’ may remove the effects of ku through the natural p.867 passages. Those stones were stated by Ch‘en Tsang-khi to be obtained from Lei-cheu, the ‘Thunder Department’, which is the most southerly projecting peninsula of Kwangtung province, opposite Hainan island, as also from some vallies in Ho-tung or the present province of Shansi, where they lie at a depth of three feet in grounds which lightning has struck. They possess various shapes, but mostly resemble axes and knives,     See his biography in the History of the Ming Dynasty, ch. 160.

According to some writers, there exist also ‘thunder-hammers’, weighing several pounds, ‘thunder-awls’ and ‘thunder-axes’, supposed to have been used by the God of Thunder to split up things ; further there are ‘thunder-rings’, lost by that god, and ‘thunder-pearls’, which dragons have dropped from their mouths, and which may thoroughly illuminate a whole house during the night ; etc. (499). Perhaps those objects may be the relics of an age of stone. A good medicine for ku poison is leek-juice mixed with spirits, which will make the patient vomit some ophidian creature. The vermin may also be expelled by means of efficacious magic spells, purporting to bully and intimidate it ; a great number have been invented to this end, and we have seen that they were already used under the ancient Cheu dynasty (p. 826). A good means to protect one’s self against ku, professedly practised by people in Fuhkien, Kwangtung and Kwangsi when putting up in an inn, is to tap the inn-keeper on his back or shoulder, and ask him whether he has ku in his house ; this done, the thing will not be set to work, as it is tolerably certain that whoever knows about ku will also know the means to defeat it. We have already stated (p.849), that ku poisoning may be discovered by means of the spittle of the patient, and by peas placed in his mouth, or by an egg of a kuh put in his bed. Victims may be recognized by a glare on their heads, which, when touched by another, emit sparks. The diagnosis may also be made by the patient himself by application of roots or leaves of a gingerlike herb, called jang-ho, which if hidden in his bed without his knowing it, will make him mention the name of the sorcerer, p.868 who then can be asked or compelled to stop his odious work. That plant is generally surmised to be the ‘efficacious herb’ by means of which certain officers of the Cheu dynasty were directed to combat the dangers of ku (cf. p. 847). Although gold-caterpillar sorcery does not seem to be actually distinguished from ku, some special preventives of its affects are prescribed. One of these is the dried skin of a hedgehog, which, as I have been assured in China, is kept for the purpose in many houses. An author of the twelfth century relates,"},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 370 « that the prefect of Yüh-lin told him that he had witnessed in the district of Fuh-ts‘ing (in Fuhkien) a process in a case of poisoning with a gold caterpillar. The sub-prefect of that district had been unable to find any trace of guilt until some one had advised him to introduce a pair of hedgehogs into that house, as then the insect would certainly be caught, because it is afraid of hedgehogs. These beasts had entered, and the caterpillar did not stir ; yet though it lay concealed in a fissure of the wall under a bed, it was drawn by the two animals out of its shelter 1. Ch‘en Shi-toh, also named Yuen-kung, in the later years of the seventeenth century compiled a work in six chapters on the healing art, in which he laid down much wisdom professedly borrowed from the most ancient medical sages, and wrote therein : « Take a weight of three ts‘ien of thunder-pills, powder them, and mix the powder with a little quantity of white alum ; then, when a gold caterpillar appears, drop a little of the powder upon it, and it will change forthwith into a red, bloody fluid. When the Shen tao (the Tao or Universal Order represented by the shen) flies into a passion and is going to cause misfortune, then, when it is heard in the sky, forthwith drop some of that powder while looking up towards the place whence the noise is heard ; the Shen tao will undoubtedly give vent to a great curse, but p.869 will calmly pass away, and never return. When any one obtains the insect, he is sure to amass riches ; it comes from the air and he feels exhilarated, sacrifices to it in a cupboard or a drawer, worships it, and prays to it the whole day ; but in the long run his face assumes the same gold colour which the caterpillar has ; he takes medicines, but in vain ; later on his belly swells up, as if he were attacked by dropsy. Such practices flourish especially in Shuh (Szĕ-ch‘wen). He who gets a caterpillar does not as a rule live for five years, and even after his death the caterpillar does not go  1 Ch. 6 of the T‘ieh-wei shan ts‘ung tan, a work in six chapters treaating of matters between the years 963 and 1130, in which period the author, Ts’ai T’ao, lived."},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol.

It is, indeed, averred that those birds show a remarkable tendency to fly away wherever ku is kept. This peculiarity was known as early as the ninth century to Twan Ch‘ing-shih, who wrote : « If fowls fly away without evident reason, there is ku in the house, and when they do not come down from the trees in the daytime, the wife or the concubines have incestuous schemes (501). The cock, as we shall see in Chapter V of Part IV, is feared by spectres ; therefore protection against ku is afforded by its head, affixed over the house-door. This conception may, however, also be due to the circumstance that fowls prey on grubs, insects, and small reptiles. @ "},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 372 CHAPTER III Infliction of Evil by means of Human Souls @ p.870 It is not only by means of their own souls and the souls of animals that sorcerers practice their cruel art ; they can further do so by means of the souls of other men. We have already seen the Code of Laws refer to or ku of babies (see p. 861), coincidently with ku by means of snakes and gold caterpillars, and may infer herefrom that the former is a practice of the same nature, that is to say, it consists in letting loose human souls or human soul-substance upon victims. The Code having thus directed our attention to this form of sorcery, we are naturally drawn to further search in its pages, to obtain yet more information on the subject. In fact we find in it, immediately before the title on ku, another, bearing on « plucking out vitality, and chopping or cutting men (502), which, according to an explanatory note, « means to steal the ears, eyes, viscera, internal organs, etc. from a living person, and chop or cut off his limbs and other parts. These crimes are of the same nature as simple dismemberment, but the perpetrator of dismemberment has no ulterior object beyond murder, and the other crime is murder followed by sorcery for the purpose of decoying others, so that it is considered to be peculiarly serious. Another official comment says : « Those who occupy themselves with sorcery either steal away men’s ears or eyes, or chop off their hands or feet ; they then take a human image made of wood or modelled in clay, and p.871 after laying all these things on the ground, perform over them such sorcerous magic as will cause them to perform functions.

In times gone by such practices prevailed in Yunnan, Kweicheu, Kwangtung and Kwangsi. And still more frequently it occurs that a man’s viscera or chief internal organs are cut out, or a pregnant woman’s fruit, or the virginal red matter of some unmarried maid, or some other thing of the kind, in order to have ingredients for sorcery. All such things fall under ‘plucking out vitality and chopping or cutting’. In these lines we have practically all that is required for the comprehension of this form of sorcery. The instrument of the sorcerer is a human soul, or some portion of it, obtained by appropriating certain parts of the body of a living person, but especially such organs as are deemed to be more especially impregnated with his mental or vital power. An image is then provided for his soul to settle in, and the latter totally subdued by the sorcerer to his will by charms and spells, formulae of enchantment, and actual ill-treatment of the image, in consequence of which it is obliged obediently to do all the mischief he ordains. Female sexual organs or secretions are selected for such sorcery since they are connected with procreation, and consequently with life and vitality assimilated with the soul. Another part of the running commentary of the Code reads as follows : « To pluck out life or chop and cut a man means to cause death to a living person and take away the openings of his senses, in order to perform black magic therewith. It happens that by means of magic and black art the hour, year and month of a man’s p.872 birth are obtained, in order to decoy him by means thereof unto some unfrequented spot deep in the mountains, there to murder him and cut off pieces from his body, or to cut out his five internal organs and his vitality, or to draw the souls (the hwun and the p‘oh) out of him, in order to turn them into a spectral servant. The"},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 374 ‘spectre-vines’, for sale nowadays in Kwangtung and Kwangsi, Honan, Fuhkien and other regions, consist of such things. As all such crimes constitute homicide followed by sorcery, they are punished by the Law more severely than simple murder. « Whosoever plucks the life out of a man, or mutilates and cuts him, (whether the victim he killed thereby or merely wounded), shall (if he is the principal culprit) be slowly carved to death with knives. His possessions shall be allotted judicially to the family of the murdered person, and his, wife, children, and the inmates of his house, even though they knew nothing of the matter, shall be banished for life to a country two thousand miles off, without permission to return when an amnesty is proclaimed.

Should the culprits have begun to carry the crime into effect, but not yet have inflicted any wounds, the (principal) offender shall be beheaded, and his wife and children banished for life to the distance of two thousand miles, while the accomplices (who have actually co-operated) shall receive a hundred blows with the long stick, and be sent into perpetual exile to the distance of three thousand miles. And if the chiefs of the ward or village have known about the crime and have not revealed it, they shall be beaten with one hundred blows with the long stick ; but if they have been ignorant of it, they shall not be liable to any punishment.

The presence of such laws in the Code clearly attests the general prevalence in China of this cruelest of all forms of sorcery during the reign of the two dynasties under which this Code was in force. The Mongol house of Yuen, which preceded them, also had a law providing against it : « Whosoever plucks life out of a man or dismembers him, with intent to procure a spectre to sacrifice to, shall be slowly carved to death with knives ; his family possessions shall be forfeited, and all the inmates of his house, although ignorant of the crime, shall be banished to distant regions. If the crime was begun, however, without murder of the victim, the case shall be treated as one of robbery with violence ; and should no wounds have been inflicted, and nothing of value appropriated, the punishment shall amount to 107 blows with a long stick and banishment for three years. And if the crime was merely p.874 plotted and not yet begun, the number of blows shall be 97, and the banishment be for a term of two years and a half. The man who was to be assassinated, and accomplices who denounced the crime or arrested the culprits, shall receive the family possessions of the culprits ; and if the arrest has been made by one to whose duty it belonged, he shall receive one half thereof (503). In order to convey to the reader some more knowledge about this branch of sorcery, we think we can not do better than bring to his notice the following long story : « Wang Pih, also named Liang-fu, a man of Ts‘in-cheu, had been appointed Governor of Lung-sha, after having travelled for the"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 376 purpose of study through north Yen-ngan. Having resigned his office, he retired into private life and practised medicine. In the second year of the Chi ching period (A. D. 1342), a crafty wu, named Wang Wan-li, practised divination and soothsaying with his brother’s son Shang-hien in the bazaar of Lung-sha. In the winter of that year, in the eleventh month, Wang Pih visited him, and, discontented with the verdict of the oracle given by that man, made the mistake of reprimanding and insulting him severely. This greatly roused Wan-li’s anger, and he incited on a spectre against Pih to disquiet him. That night Pih was sitting down studying the chapter on the Metal-bound Coffer (of the Shu king), when suddenly he heard outside the window a dreary whistling voice. He opened the door to see who was there, but though the moon shone brightly in the empty courtyard, he perceived nobody. The next day in broad daylight a wailing voice sounded at the gate, accompanied by complaints of having suffered wrong. Pih called a spectre-seer to lay the ghost, but this man could not master it. Pih now spoke : — How can it possibly be that my medicines have killed you ! therefore it is not I who have to redress the wrong under which you suffer. Upon which the spectre said : — I have convinced myself that of the many men there are, only you, sir, can be relied on ; should you be really willing to redress the wrongs under which I suffer, you must call together some ten elders to attend as witnesses. Pih promised to do so, and when they had assembled, the spectre told its story in the following terms : — I am a girl of the Cheu family in Blackbrook, in the Fung-cheu department.

V 377 for which reason my name is Moon-in-the west. When I had reached my sixteenth year, my mother fell sick ; my father called in Wang Wan-li to divine her condition, and thus I became acquainted with that man. One hundred and five days after my mother’s death, on the day ping-ch‘en of the ninth month of the third year of the Chi yuen period (1337), when my father, being drunk, was lying down to sleep and my brother was out collecting firewood, that man, while I was walking up and down in the shade of the wall, wrought upon the hour and day of my birth with bewitching spells in such wise that I became totally absent-minded and stood with staring eyes, unable to utter a word. In this condition Wan-li took me upon his back to a willow-grove, and tied me with my back against a tree ; he unfastened his hair, wound a coloured cord around it, and made a hole in my breast in order to cut my heart out, which in a few hours he pulverized, together with my eyes, my tongue, my ears, nose, nails, and fingers, and having kneaded the mass into balls, p.876 he put these into a gourd. Subsequently he made a human image of paper, and violently compelled me by means of spells to become his slave. Whenever I was a little lazy, he pricked the image with a needle ; my eyebrows then contracted with pain, and my month uttered long cries of woe. Yesterday, sir, he was insulted by you, and sent me to you to avenge him, but I cannot find it in my heart to do so. Sir, please pity me ; let me no longer endure that wrong in this nether world ; I swear to you I will bind myself to you as a child to its father. But the elders here seated must not speak of it, lest misfortune befall them’. And on these words the spectre wailed still more piteously. Pih, too, shed tears, and so did the ten gentlemen. They put down the depositions of Moon-in-the-west in black and white, subscribed their names, and secretly informed the prefect of the district. This officer surprised Wan-li and his nephew, and sharply questioned them.

V 378 depositions very bitterly, and demanded that the contents of his travelling-bag should be inventoried. Various things were produced from it, such as written charms and formulae, seal-impresses, needles long and short ; so Wan-li fell flat on the ground, and made a clean breast in the following terms : He was a man from Lü-ling. While busy collecting a store of magical arts, he came to Hing-yuen, where he met with one Liu, an alchemist, who instructed him in the art of plucking life, answering in the main to what Moon-in-the-west had told. But he did not believe in the reality of it ; therefore Liu took out of his bag a five-coloured cloth in which he had hairs in pellets, and pointing his finger at them, said : — This is Li Yen-nü of Hien-ning, obtained by me in the second month of the spring of the second year of the T‘ien lih period ; for seventy-five strings of coins I will order him to bind himself to you as a follower and attendant. On the other assenting to this bargain with delight, Liu made the Yü paces 1, and burned charms to conjure Yen-nü, whose voice was thereupon heard in the air, saying : — Master, whither do you want me to go ? — Follow Mr. Wang on his peregrinations ; he is a good man with whom you will not at all fare ill. Wan-li paid the money, thus entering into p.877 the full possession of that magic. After this, on passing through Fang-cheu, he fell in with a master Kwang, from whom, after some agreeable conversation, he obtained one Keng Wan-t‘ung from Fung-yuen, whom likewise he made his slave for the same sum he had paid to Liu, so that, including Moon-in-the-west, he possessed three.

Therefore he had nothing more to say. p.878 The prefect wrote to his colleague in Fung-cheu to trace Hwo-khing and obtain from him some evidence in corroboration. This man’s suspicions were aroused ; but when he was placed amidst a great number of people, and Pih asked : — Who is your father ? and Moon-in-the-west answered through a crack in the wall : — The man with the black dress and the rush hat, he was deeply agitated, and his daughter not less than he. When their emotion had subsided, she asked him about their family, soothing him as she was wont to do during her life. The prefect considered the examination satisfactory and placed the case in the hands of his superior, the prefect of the department. Wan-li fell ill in the gaol and died, and Shang-hien was set free in the end for a ransom (504). This story, which we seem tolerably justified in regarding as an embellished account of a real proceding by superstitious mandarins against some hapless victim of a crafty ventriloquist, is of some use in contributing to our knowledge of the principles and details of this gruesome ‘life-plucking’. This crime is, in fact, a double crime, being committed just as much against the person whose soul is wanted as an instrument of sorcery, as against the individual on whom this soul is to operate. But we may also learn from Wan-li’s confessions that there exist less bloody forms of this doubly black art, since he obtained a soul by merely becoming possessor of human hair. No doubt sorcerers treat such hair in much the same way as they treat the parts and organs obtained with destruction of life. The story teaches us furthermore that sorcerers do not always give their orders to their spectral servants verbally, but also in written forms, by burning paper charms. In fact the sending of written orders and prayers, as well as paper valuables, into the spirit-world through fire and smoke is such an everyday practice among the Chinese that we need not feel any surprise at finding p.879 that sorcerers too"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol.

A fetus contains a double soul : its own, and its mother’s. « Mr. Hü in King-shan (pr. of Hupeh), whose family had lived for many generations in Sang-hu-pan, married a wife. This woman’s toilet-boxes looked so well furnished that they aroused the covetousness of Yang Shan, a thief. After a year, when this man knew that her husband was taking his son to the Metropolis, and that the wife in the family way had not more than two female slaves for company, he sneaked into the house at night, and concealed himself in a dark spot to watch for his opportunity. After the third watch-drum he saw by the light of the lamp a man with sunken eyes and a curly beard climb through the window, with a yellow linen bag on his back. ‘I never came across that fellow before’, said Yang to himself, and he held his breath, carefully watching his doings. Drawing an incense-stick out of his sleeve, the man lighted it at the lamp, and placed it near the slaves ; then he turned to the bed of the wife and muttered a spell, on which she suddenly jumped up and, turning towards him, threw herself on her knees before him, quite naked. He opened his bag, took a knife out of it, and ripped up her belly ; then he tore the fetus out, and putting it into an urn of porcelain, slung this over his back and left the house, leaving the corpse of the woman on the floor before the bed. Yang, terror-stricken, also left the house and followed that man. At an inn by the village-gate he flung his arms around him, p.880 crying : — Innkeeper, quick, come here, I have caught a sorcerer !

Next morning they delivered him to the magistrate, who questioned him under torture, thus extorting the confession that he was a member of the White Lotus society, and had very many comrades. It was thus discovered that a pregnant woman, whose corpse had been found in Han-siang, also was a victim of the same practice. After his trial the malefactor was slowly carved to death, and the thief was rewarded with fifty ounces of silver (505). To prove the conviction of the Chinese in the reality of such murderous sorcery, we may also refer to modern imperial edicts which make it clear that we must not regard the laws, which we have quoted, as dead letters. We have already read on page 488 in a decree, that in 1821 a Censor made a report to the Throne about miscreants in ‘Shantung ‘who cut out the organs from boys and girls’. But the following edict, issued twenty-five years later, speaks volumes : « On the day ki szĕ of the sixth month of the twenty-sixth year of the Tao kwang period (6 Aug. 1846) the emperor issued the following decree to the Council of State, to be forwarded to Ki Ying, Governor-General of the two Kwang, to Na’rh-king-ko, Governor-General of Chihli, to Pih Ch‘ang, Governor-General of the two Kiang, to Yü T‘ai, Governor-General of Hu-kwang, to Liu Yun-kho, Governor-General of Fuhkien and Cheh-kang, to Ch‘ung Ngen, Governor of Shantung, and to Wu Wen-yung, Governor of Kiangsi, relating to a report of the Censor p.881 Su Hioh-kien, to whose knowledge it had come that lawless villains were decoying young boys by means of magic, and that this practice was assuming serious proportions.

This is an order of the greatest importance (506). p.882 In the great collection of edicts from which we have drawn this one, another, issued twenty-four days later, follows, in which the emperor, referring to the arrest of suspected individuals in Peking, specially insists upon great severity to be used by the Board of Punishments in examining and trying them. Another edict of the same seventh month tells us of another complaint lodged by a Censor about the same work of poisoning prevalent also in the district of Siao-shan in Chehkiang, which had entailed the arrest of several Buddhist priests who had with them medicine-cakes, which, however, proved to be harmless ; this case likewise occasioned the emperor to insist upon thorough measures being taken by his mandarins. Finally a fourth resolution, passed in the eighth month on account of reports, received from the provinces, that arrests of suspected criminals had not led to the discovery of the evil, exhorts the high authorities to observe prudence, care, and secrecy in their work of investigation. It is now possible for us to realize the capital dangers to which medical missionaries expose themselves by performing operations or amputations.

V 383 against them, and have even become sources of troubles, nay of murderous attacks. Sorcery by means of human souls may be a complicated application of various animistic notions : To give are example. We know that a grave, if placed under good fung-shui or natural influences, ensures happiness to the soul of the dead who rests in it, and, as a consequence, to his relations too, since that soul, being contented and pleased, protects them well and blesses them. This dogma engenders the belief, that any envious person may put a stop to such a happy state of things, and appropriate all the blessings for himself by burying a part of the body of a member of his own family, and therewith his soul, in that grave. But after all we have learned about the complications of the Chinese science of grave-making and sepulture, it is clear that only experts in geomancy can successfully apply this trick ; so that it is quite natural that such professors should generally be living under suspicion of sorcery. p.883 It is Sui Yuen’s useful book of tales that acquaints us with this curious grave-sorcery : « The grave of the gentleman of Ngan-khi lies on a mountain in Fuhkien. A Taoist doctor of the tribe Ki, wishing to draw profits from the fung-shui of it, said to his daughter, who was very ill and in danger of death : — You are born for my use, and it is not likely that you will be cured ; I shall take a portion of your body and enrich us by means of it. For some time I have desired to appropriate that fung-shui of the Li family, but it cannot yield any benefits to us unless a bone of my own daughter is buried in it ; your death is imminent ; those who survive you may now derive advantage from it. And ere she could give an answer, he cut off her finger with a knife, put it into the horn of a ram, and secretly buried it somewhere by the grave of the Li people. From that time, whenever there died a graduate among that family, a member of the clan of the Taoist succeeded in taking his degree, and whenever in the fields of the Li the harvest decreased by ten"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 384 bushels, those of the Taoist yielded ten bushels more : the matter raised suspicion, but remained a mystery. Once in the Ts‘ing ming period, the villagers carried the image of the Great Emperor Chang to a meeting for presentation of thank-offerings to the gods. Their beautiful procession with its ornamental flags in the van and in the rear came to the grave of Li, when the image suddenly stopped, and though several dozens of men carried it, it could not possibly be moved. One among them, a lad 1, suddenly exclaimed : — Quick, back to the temple ! The bearers followed him to that building, where the lad placed himself on the throne of the god. — I am the Great Emperor, he said, there is sorcery in the grave of Li ; go and catch the culprit, and punish him. And he told this one of the crowd to fetch a shovel, and that one to take a hoe, and A.B. to fetch ropes ; and when a gang of men had thus been procured, he exclaimed : — Go on now, quick, to the grave of Li ! The crowd obeyed, and the image was moved forth as quick as the wind. Those with the shovels and the hoes at his command searched by the grave for a while, and found a gilded ram’s horn with a red viper in it, wriggling with quick movements, and on one side of the horn the names of all the members of the clan of the aforesaid Taoist were written. Now the lad ordered the men with the ropes to go to the Taoist and bind him ; then he cried that they should go to the mandarin ; and the mandarin examined that man (under torture), convicted him, and punished him according to the law. From that moment the Li people prospered again, and worshipped the Great Emperor with peculiar devotion (507).  1 In whose body the god had settled. "},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 385 Since sorcerers, like all the Chinese people, are convinced that bones of the dead are imbued with soul-substance, we need not be surprised to see them sometimes using skulls, the head in particular being deemed to contain a great quantity of vigorous soul-substance (page 77). « In Hang-cheu there lived one Ch‘en I-khwei, versed in the ‘transportation-methods of the five spectres’. A friend of his, belonging to the Sun clan, once lodged in his house, and saw at midnight a hoary old man jump out from under his p.885 bed. This man kneeled down before him, saying : — I pray you to prevail upon Ch‘en to give me back my skull, so that my corpse may become complete again. Sun started, and rose immediately ; and looking by the light of his lamp under the bed, saw there a dead man’s head. He inferred from this, that Ch‘en, who occupied himself with the expulsion and employment of spectres, whenever he did so took heaven-bestowed souls out of decayed coffins ; they came to him because he applied charms and used spells. The first thing now for Sun to do was to reprimand his friend ; Ch‘en, however, denied the matter, but the other reduced him to silence by taking the skull from under the bed and showing it him. They then brought it back to the place whence it was taken ; yet Ch‘en was erelong assailed by a troop of spectres ; his body was studded all over with violet boils, and he expired (508). Bones of the dead may be used for such evil work with great refinement. Archdeacon Gray relates, that in the district of Sun-teh, and at Si-chu-shan, a portion of the district of Nan-hai, in Kwangtung, there are women called mi-fu-kow 1, who profess by incantations and other mysterious means to be able to effect the death of their fellow-creatures. They are consulted by married women who, owing to ill-treatment or for other reasons, are anxious secretly to kill their husbands. The witches gather the bones of infants from the public cemeteries, and invoke the soul of the infants to accompany them to their  1 Women who use mystic charms."},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 386 dwelling-houses. The bones are reduced to a fine powder, and sold in this form. Mixed in tea, wine, or any other beverage, the powder is daily given to her husband by the murderous wife. At the same time the witch daily calls upon the spirit of the infant, whose bones have been used, to effect the death of the object of the woman’s hate. Sometimes, in addition p.886 to his horrible daily draught, a portion of the bone of an infant is carefully secreted under his bed. Attempts have been made, I believe, not without success, to destroy these witches. In the public hall at Kang-hi, near to Si-chu-shan, some of these women were summoned into the presence of the gentry, and made to answer certain grave charges of this nature, which had been proferred against them by their neighbours. Upon being convicted, they were put to death by poison. As lately as the year 1865, several women of this class were put to death in this manner (509). Taking their life or soul out of men for sorcerous purposes is sometimes mentioned in the books by the term t‘iao sheng, ‘to draw out or lift out life’. There may be a difference between this term and ‘plucking out life’ ; perhaps it may denote extraction of the soul without ‘plucking’ at the same time any organs or parts out of or from the body. T‘iao sheng may, according to an author of the twelfth century, be effected by killing the victim by means of some animal sent into his body, thus coupling it with something of the nature of ku sorcery. « In Kwangsi, says he, homicide is committed by drawing out life ; they will entertain a visitor with fish, and, while sitting opposite him, set to work practices which bend it to their will, in consequence of which it can revive his belly and cause his death. And it is stated that he is then secretly employed in that family as a slave. There is living in that province a famous member of the gentry, who, when he was a judge in Lei-cheu (the southern peninsula of Kwangtung, opposite Hainan island), had to try a cause of ‘lifting out life’. He put some flesh underneath a dish, and the prisoner performed his arts over it to prove his magical capacities ; and"},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 387 when after a while they lifted up the dish to see what had taken place under it, the flesh, it is really true, was overgrown with hair. What a vicious spectre must be that which can do such things ! It is, however, quite easy to destroy the effects of such things. As soon as any one becomes aware that he has something in breast or immediately below it, he merely has to swallow quickly some shing-ma, and thus to vomit it up ; or when it is felt in his belly, he must void it in the natural way by taking p.887 without delay some yuh-kin (an aromatic root). These recipes, which are carved in Lei-cheu on printing-blocks and published there, were obtained from the aforesaid prisoner (510). We have seen (pp. 871 and 876) that human souls, obtained by the cruel method of ‘plucking out life’, may be kept by sorcerers in images, and by spells, harsh words, and ill-treatment of the same be compelled to work evil. Spirits may, however, be settled into such images without plucking of life ; they may for example be obtained from graves or cemeteries by enchantment, mostly connected with a sacrifice of food, dainties, mock money, and incense, or from soul-tablets stolen for the purpose from public repositories (Book I, p. 1058) ; probably they may be obtained also in a great many other ways of which I have not heard or read. But sorcerers or sorceresses, however wicked they may be, certainly are never so depraved or daring as to employ for black magic the souls of their own-deceased relations. Spirits thus in the power of sorcerers are called yen-shing kwei-mei or, abbreviated, yen-mei, ‘spectres in subjection’. The character yen is no doubt a later modification of , ‘to suppress, or to reduce to subjection’ ; we have, of course, to beware of confounding it with the spirits of nightmare, which (see p. 699) it represents also. The term yen-shing is old ; old therefore also is the form of sorcery which it denotes. We read in the Standard History of the house of Han, that prince Khing, eldest son of the emperor Chang who reigned from A. D. 76 to 88, was, together with his mother, a prey to the envious hatred of the empress Teu, who was sonless. She calumniated her rival by p.888 every means,"},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 388 « and having intercepted at the gate of the palace-prison a letter of hers, reading : ‘I am so ill, and longing for fresh t’u, tell my family to fetch some for me, she falsely accused her of intent to make ku and pronounce imprecations and spells, and that she would perform yen-shing magic by means of that plant (511). She attained her object : her rival fell into complete disgrace and killed herself, and the prince was deposed from his dignity of heir-apparent. It seems then that certain plants might serve to impose obedience on spectres ; but all details on this point are lacking. Undoubtedly this sort of black magic has, as well as ku, been often practised in court-life. We read for instance in one of the Standard Histories, that under Heu Tsu, the last emperor of the Ch‘en dynasty, who reigned from A. D. 583 to 589, « the harem indulged in yen-mei magic and in methods of misusing spectres, in order to confound the emperor ; they set out heterodox sacrifices in the palace, assembled there sorcerous wu, making them drum and dance, and in this way discovered occurrences outside the palace ; no word was spoken by men, no act they did, which the concubine (Chang) did not know sooner than everybody else and brought to Heu Tsu’s knowledge (512). Seeing that the whole Chinese race is enslaved by an unbounded dread of the machinations of evil spirits, it is naturally possessed by a no less overwhelming horror of the occult arts which profess to set to work such dangerous agents. These may attack the victim with the utmost impetuosity, fury and ferocity ; hear what the renowned author of the Liao-chai chi i has to say on this head : « Yü was a young gentleman of energy and courage, fond of boxing and sport, who could, with two pots in his hands, jump up in the air whirling round like a whirlwind. In the Ch‘ung-ching period (1628-1644) he was in the Capital p.889 for the purpose of submitting to the Palace examinations (for the highest literary degree), when his servant was laid up with illness,"},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 389 and could not rise. This was a great trouble to him. At that time there was in the bazaar an able fortune-teller, who could even discover whether a man was going to live or die ; this man he desired to consult about his servant, but ere he spoke a word to him, the fortune-teller said : — Is it not about the illness of your servant, sir, that you desire to consult me ? Startled at there words, Yü replied in the affirmative, whereupon the other continued : — It is not the patient who will come to grief, but it might be you yourself, sir, who are in peril. Yü now drew lots for himself. The fortune-teller laid them out into a kwa, and in alarm exclaimed : — Sir, you are fated to die in three days. Mr. Yü was affrighted for a while, when the soothsayer calmly said : — I, your humble servant, possess some insignificant magic ; for ten gold coins I will avert this calamity from you. But the other reflected that the time which a man has to live is pre-destined by fate, and he did not see how magic could alter it. So he rose without answering, and was just leaving the house, when the soothsayer said : — You will save this trifling outlay, I hope you will not repent it, I hope you will not repent it ! All Mr. Yü’s friends were concerned for him, and advised him rather to empty his purse and arouse the soothsayer’s compassion by means of its contents ; but he would not hear of it. The third day came soon, and he sat down upright in his inn, to wait calmly for what was going to happen. No evil befell him all day ; then the night came, and he shut the door, trimmed the p.890 lamp, and sat down, leaning on his sword, to brave the danger."},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 390 The water-clock had almost run out for the first time, and still there came nothing to cause his death. He was then thinking of going to bed, when suddenly he heard a rustling sound in the crack of the window. He forthwith turned his eyes to that side, and saw a little tiny man enter through with a spear on his shoulder, who, on reaching the ground, shot up to a man’s height. Mr. Yü seized his sword, got up, and at once struck a blow at that being ; but he merely cut the air, and hit nothing. The spectre forthwith grew small and re-sought the crack, in order to escape through it ; but Yü struck at it so quickly, that it forthwith fell to the ground. Then throwing a light upon it, he found a paper man, cut right through the middle. Mr. Yü did not venture to go to sleep. He sat down as before, to await whatever might befall, and after an hour another being worked itself through the window into the room. It looked strange and hideous, like a spectre. No sooner had it reached the ground than he struck at it, cutting it right in two, and as the pieces kept on wriggling about, he went on dealing blow after blow, lest they might get up again. Every blow told, and sounded as though it fell on something hard, and on examining the spot he saw a clay image, entirely reduced to fragments. Now placing his seat below the window, he kept his eye fixed on the crack. After a long while he heard a noise outside the window like the bellowing of a bull, something pushing at the same time against the window-frame with such force as to make the walls of the room shake and tremble as if they threatened to fall. Fearing they might come down and crush him, Mr. Yü thought that he could not do better than go outside and fight the spectre there. He drew back the bolt with a tearing noise, rushed out, and beheld a gigantic devil, as tall as the eaves of the house. By the dim moonlight he saw that its face was as black as charcoal ; from its eyes shot a bright yellow glare ; the upper part of its body was bare, and it wore no shoes. ; in its hand it held a bow, and it had arrows at its belt. Yü stood terror-stricken. The spectre placed an"},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 391 arrow on its bow, but he knocked it off with his sword, so that it fell to the ground ; then he prepared to strike, but again the devil had an arrow ready, which Yü evaded by a quick jump sideways. With a grating sound the arrow quivered in the wall, which enhanced the fury of the spectre. It drew its sword, made it whistle through p.891 the air, and looking straight into Yü’s face aimed a violent blow at him ; but Yü ducked forward, so that the sword came down upon a stone in the pavement of the courtyard, splitting it right in two. Now Yü ran out from between the legs of the spectre and cut at its ankles, which gave a sound as of hard metal. This again increased the devil’s fury ; with a roar like thunder it turned round to get another blow at Yü. Again, however, Yü stooped down and made a forward movement, so that the sword coming down merely cut off a piece from his skirt. But now Yü was close to the flanks of his assailant ; wildly he struck at them, the blows this time also resounding as on hard metal, and the result was that the devil came tumbling down flat. He then went on belabouring it wildly with his sword, the blows giving a rattling noise like that produced by wooden clappers. Throwing a light upon it with a candle, he saw that it was a wooden image of the size of a man. The bow and arrows were still at its belt ; its features, carved and painted, were repulsive and horrid, and where his sword had hit it, it showed bloody spots. With a torch in his hand Mr. Yü awaited daybreak, when it occurred to him that those spectres must have been sent by that fortune-teller, in order to prove the spiritual power of his art by bringing a man into the clutches of death. Next day he told the event far and wide, and went with some people to the fortune-teller’s. On seeing Mr. Yü in the distance, this man rendered himself invisible, but one of the company said : — We have here to do with shape-concealing magic, which may be baffled by the blood of a dog."},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 392 Yü gave heed to this suggestion, and told his men to go and fetch some blood ; and on the man concealing himself as before, he immediately threw the blood on the spot where he stood, with the result that they saw the man’s head and face re-appear, all stained with the blood. He stood upright before them like a devil with glaring eyes ; they seized him at once, and handed him over to the magistrate, by whom he was put to death (513). Sorcery as described in this tale becomes doubly murderous and criminal when — as is believed to be often the case — the spirit, let loose in the form of a puppet upon the victim, is the soul of a living man ; for should the puppet incur injury by reason of the heroism or cleverness of the victim, that soul may be maimed along with it, even to such an extent as to become no longer fit to p.893 animate the man to which it belongs, in consequence of which he is doomed to death, or becomes sick or idiotic for life. Such ultra black practices are believed to exist. « In Hunan, thus we read, one Chang Khi-shen understood how to get possession of the hwun of others by means of magic. Very numerous were they who regarded him with awe on that account, and Wu, a man of letters from Kiang-Ling, was the only one who refused to believe in his power. Once he disparaged him before a crowd of people. Convinced that some spectral evil would be done to him in return on that very night, he armed himself with a copy of the Yih king, and sat down by the lamp. Presently he heard on the roof a noise like a blast of wind. A spirit in metal armour pushed open the door and entered. With a spear it made up to our scholar to stab him, but he flung the Yih king at it, thus throwing it to the ground, where it changed into a paper puppet. The scholar picked this up, and placed it between the leaves of his Yih king ; but thereupon two other spectres appeared simultaneously, with blue faces, and axes in their hands. They too were struck to the ground with the Yih king, and also received a place between the leaves of that book."},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 393 At midnight the wife of the magician knocked at the door, wailing and weeping. — Chang, my husband, she said, yesterday sent out my two sons to haunt you, not expecting that you would catch them both by some spiritual magic which we did not know was in your possession ; pray let them go, that they may return to life. — Those who came here, replied Wu, were three men of paper, and not your sons at all. — My husband and my two sons, was the reply, entered into paper puppets, and under that form they came here ; at this moment I have three corpses in my house, which will revive no more after the rock has crowed, and piteously she repeated her request over and p.894 over again, until Wu said : — You have done harm to not a few men, and you deserve such punishment ; but I pity you and will give you back one son. And the woman, bathed in tears, went away with one puppet. Next day the scholar received the news that Chang Khi-shen and his eldest son had died, and that only the younger was alive (514). Many centuries ago wild tales were already current of ghosts having been let loose upon mankind en masse by means of sorcery with puppets ; and such things are stated in the books to have been freely indulged in with the object of causing general commotion and thus furthering the work of insurgents. Such statements may be thoroughly legendary, or perhaps we ought to make large allowance for exaggeration, yet the fact that they were made and, moreover, transmitted by authors to this day as actual events, testifies to the intensity of the belief in the reality of sorcery on such a large scale. One of the most interesting among those stories, which takes us back to the second half of the ninth century, runs as follows : « When under the T‘ang dynasty the rebellion of (Hwang) Ch‘ao was on the point of breaking out, there lived in the hill of Meritorious Works in Pien, in the Chang-yuen region (in Honan)"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 394 sorcerous Buddhist monks, to whom the clergy far and near resorted. Even the scholars and the people were their humble adherents. They drew spirit-rebels on paper, and let them go into the dwellings of men to cause misfortune, and by this magic they sowed so much confusion among the inmates, that none could enjoy a quiet sleep from night till morning. When they thus brought sickness and misery, and the people then engaged monks of the hill of Meritorious Works for a good pay to employ p.895 their religious magic against the evil, the latter put a stop to it immediately. But there was more : the monks painted armoured soldiers on paper, and then night after night neighing sounds were heard through streets and wards, and trampling of hoofs over the city-walls ; but at daybreak everything vanished. Often also they painted dogs, which they burned and conjured with spells, and then at night dogs howled and barked in the streets and bit each other, preventing the people from sleeping ; and in these cases too, when the people engaged the monks for money, these apparitions disappeared without leaving a shadow or sound. In Hwah-cheu also there was a Buddhist monk deeply versed in sorcery, whose modus operandi was exactly the same as that of the monks of the hill of Meritorious Works ; and public persons as well as private people were greatly annoyed by it. At that time the member of the Chancery and State Council Wang Toh became governor of Hwah and T‘ai, and proclaimed that that region of southern Yen had fallen a prey to calamities, which should be averted. To this end altar grounds were laid out in his head quarters and throughout all his army corps, and several thousand monks were called upon to officiate. But their numbers were insufficient ; therefore the entire host of disciples in the hill of Meritorious Works in Pien-cheu were consecrated and repaired to the altars. With their banners and ornaments, their conches and cymbals they proceeded to the head quarters, and on the evening on which they were to go to the several altars, those among the"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 395 monk’s who possessed the highest p.896 reputation for virtue were picked out for admittance into the head quarters, while the remainder were ordered to distribute themselves among the various army divisions for the performance of rites and the recital of liturgies. When all were within the camps, the gates were firmly closed, and the monks buried alive in the ground. The wearers of square priestly robes who thus met their death were several thousands in number. At the head quarters the chiefs of the hill of Meritorious Works and their inferiors were examined (under torture), and confessed that they were commanders of clubs of Hwang Ch‘ao’s insurgents, who wanted to rise in concert with him in the two departments. They were ordered to be exterminated to a man (515). Spectres properly subdued and controlled can, of course, be employed for every sort of evil work which imaginative and superstitious minds may conceive. The wildest absurdities on this head are printed and reprinted, told and retold ; indeed, the powers of sorcerous wizards and witches in a country where neither culture nor religion has ever set limits to credulity, are simply as boundless as credulity itself. Everything we have read in this volume concerning evil inflicted by invisible spectral hands, and of course much more, may be work of sorcerers ; thus they may e. g. send forth their spectres to create panics among men by cutting off their hair, or to possess them and make them ill, idiotic or mad, or to induce them to commit suicide, or to kill them, or to render their lives in their own houses intolerable by throwing stones and other things, even taking off the tiles for missiles ; etc. etc. Sui Yuen relates the following story : « Wang Kung-nan, my sister’s husband, is living in Hang-cheu upon the Hung-ho bridge. One morning on going out he found a p.897 Taoist doctor at his gate, who said with folded hands : — Sir, give me a fish if you please ; but Kung-nan angrily retorted : — Fish you want, you, an ascetic and a vegetarian !"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 396 — I mean a wooden fish 1, the other replied ; but Kung-nan refused again ; on which the Taoist proceeded on his way, saying : — Sir, you are stingy now, but you will regret it later on. On the following night Kung-nan heard the noise of falling tiles, and at daybreak he saw them all lying in his inner courtyard. And on the next night his clothes all flew into the privy-pit. He asked the family of Chang Yiu-khien, a literary graduate, for a charm, and this man said : — I have two charms, a cheap one and a dear one ; by means of the former, Chang Chi-kho will rule those spectres. by day and night ; by the latter, Chang Chi-hien’s divine power (shen) will catch the apparitions. Kung-nan took the cheap one, and suspended it in the central apartment of his house ; and his rest was not disturbed that night. But when the third day had elapsed, an old Taoist doctor of an antique and singular appearance came and knocked at his gate. As Kung-nan happened to be out, his second son Heu-wen went out to see the man, who said : — Your house has been bothered the other day by that Taoist doctor ; he is my disciple ; you have tried to help yourself by means of charms, but you had better seek help from me ; — tell your father to come to-morrow to the pavilion of the Cool Springs by the West Lake, and to cry there aloud three times ‘iron hood’ ; I shall then come ; if your father does not do so, the charm will be stolen by spectres’. p.898 When Kung-nan came home, his son informed him of that visit. At daybreak Kung-nan repaired to the pavilion, and cried ‘iron hood’ several hundred times, but he remained alone, and no answer came. Just then the prefect of Ts‘ien-t‘ang, Wang Kia, passed ;  1 See page 736."},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 397 Kung-nan caught hold of the pole of his sedan-chair and revealed to him his troubles, but the magistrate thought he was crazy, and all he got was a shower of curses and insults. That night he assembled several brave and strong men of his family to protect that charm, but at the fifth watch a tearing noise was heard, and lo, the charm was gone, and in the morning they saw a giant’s footprint over a foot in size on a chair. From that time there was a crowd of spectres every night at his gate, who tapped and threw crockery about. Kung-nan lived in a great fright ; for fifty gold-pieces he purchased charms from Chang, and when these were put up in his house the spectres kept quiet. Then one day he was angry with his eldest son Heu-ts‘eng, and was just going to cane him, but he ran away. On the third day he had not come back ; my sister wept incessantly, and Kiang-nan went in person to seek the runaway, whom he found wandering beside the river, on the point of drowning himself. Forthwith they put him in a sedan-chair, and found him twice as heavy as usual 1. Arriving at home, he stared vacantly and jabbered unintelligibly, and lying on his sleeping-mat he suddenly exclaimed in a fit of terror : — They are going to investigate the case ; I am going ! — Where will you go, my child ? asked his father, I shall go with you. And Heu-ts‘eng rose, put on his ceremonial robe and cap, and knelt down below the spot where the charms were affixed ; Kung-nan remained at his side, but saw nothing. Heu-ts’eng now saw a god seat himself on a chair, with a third eye between his eyebrows, a golden face, and a red beard ; prostrate beside him was a crowd of elegant young men. And the god addressed him thus :  1 A spectre had settled in his body."},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 398 — Wang, your existence in the world of light was not yet near its end ; why were you seized with such fright that you were tempted to seek death ? And further he added : — And you, underlings of the five parts of the Universe, you have made p.899 yourselves the slaves of sorcerous Taoists, without any order or authorisation from the Supreme Purity (Heaven) ! Everybody confessed himself guilty ; the god administered thirty blows with sticks to the spectres, which shrieked for mercy, while Heu-ts‘eng saw their buttocks change colour under the blows and become like grey mud. The session ended, the god gave each of them a kick with his booted foot. Heu-ch’eng then awoke as if from a dream ; perspiration flowed down his back, but from that time the family enjoyed rest and peace (516). This tale is far from relating the worst : — certain witches have made their spectral slaves produce food wherewith to change unsuspecting and innocent travellers into beasts of burden : « Under the T‘ang dynasty there was to the west of Pien-cheu (now Khai-fung) an inn by a plank-bridge, the hostess of which was one Miss Three ; nobody could tell whence she came. She had lived there p.900 a spinster for more than thirty years, without having any children or any other relations. There were in the house several rooms. She earned a living by selling ready cooked food, was very well-to-do, and kept a great herd of donkeys. Whenever it came to pass that official or private travellers by car or on horseback were short of money, she regularly lowered her charges to help them. Thus she gained a reputation with all men for her virtue, and travellers from far and near put up at her inn. Now it happened in the Yuen hwo period (A. D. 806-821) that a stranger from Hü-cheu, named Chao Ki-hwo, who was passing that way on a journey to Tung-tu (the present Ho-nan), lodged there for a night. Some six or seven guests had arrived before him, and"},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 399 each occupied a bed, so that Ki-hwo, as the last comer, could only get a couch in a deep corner, close to the wall of the hostess’ room. Miss Three provided her guests with food on a very liberal scale, and when it was quite dark she brought wine, and very cheerfully kept the visitors company over their drink ; and Ki-hwo, though not in the habit of taking wine, also enjoyed her jesting. In this wise the second watch passed, and the guests, intoxicated and weary, lay down to sleep, while Miss Three retired into the house, closed the door, and blew out the candles. Everybody was soon in a sound sleep, and Ki-hwo alone tossed on his couch sleepless, when he heard through the wall Miss Three make a rustling noise, as if she were shifting things from their places. Through a crack his eyes fell upon her, and he saw how she took from underneath an up-turned dish a candle, which she trimmed and lighted, producing thereupon from a linen box a set of ploughing-implements, with a wooden cow and a wooden puppet, each six or seven ts‘un in size. Placing those things in front of the furnace, she squirted a mouthful of water over them, on which the two beings began to walk and run. The wooden man harnessed the cow to the plough, and ploughed up the ground before the bed where the mat covered it, making several furrows to and fro ; on which she fetched from the same box a parcel containing buckwheat, which she gave to the wooden man to sow. In a moment it shot up, flowered, and was ripe. She told the man to reap it, and when he had trodden out the ears, she got seven or eight pints, which he ground to flour in a small mill set on the floor for the purpose. Finally she put away the wooden man into the box, and made warm cakes of the flour. p.901 At that moment the cocks crew, and the visitors prepared themselves to depart. Miss Three was up first of all to light the lamp, and placed the fresh hot cakes on the table as a collation for the guests. Ki-hwo, nervous as he was, bade her a hasty farewell, opened the door, and departed ; but from outside he watched the house, and saw the visitors around the table eat heartily of the"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 400 cakes ; and lo, ere these had all gone down their throats, the men simultaneously began to crawl on the floor and to bray, and changed immediately into asses. Miss Three drove them into the inn, and took possession of their money and effects. p.902 Ki-hwo told nobody a word of his adventure, for he would fain get that magic for himself. A month had passed away, when he returned from Tung-tu. When about to arrive at the inn by the plank-bridge, he made some warm buckwheat cakes of the same dimensions as those of the other day, and then put up in the inn again for the night. Miss Three behaved merrily and cheerfully as of old, and as there came no travellers beside himself that night, she lavished so much the more attention upon him, still asking him late at night whether he desired anything. He answered that he would be obliged to have some breakfast served up early in the morning at his departure. The lady assured him that he might be perfectly at ease on this point, and might sleep soundly. After midnight, Ki-hwo perceived she did the same things as the other day. At daybreak she prepared a dish with food for him, putting also several warm cakes into it ; and when she was gone to fetch something else, he availed himself of her absence to run downstairs and exchange one of the cakes he had brought with him for one of hers, without the lady perceiving it. When on the point of starting and going to eat, Ki-hwo said : — Pray, hostess, taste a warm cake of mine ; and he picked out the one he had exchanged, and gave it her. No sooner had it entered her month than she stooped to the ground braying, and was transformed immediately into a shapely, robust donkey. Forthwith Ki-hwo mounted it, and departed. The wooden puppet, the wooden cow, and the other things he took along with him, but the magic itself did not become his, for all his attempts to exercise it proved vain. On the ass thus created by his trick Ki-hwo travelled about elsewhere, never hindered by any obstacles, and making a"},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol.

Here he saw an old man clap his hands with loud laughter ; VII. Chao Ki-hwo, with the Witch who was changed into a Donkey by her own Sorcery. — Miss Three of the plank-bridge, he cried, whence have you got this body and these bones ? and laying hold of the ass, he said to Ki-hwo :"},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol.

So the old man with both his hands tore asunder the mouth of the ass, and lo, Miss Three sprang out of the skin in her former shape. Then, after making some courtesies to the old man, she ran off, and it was never found out whither she had gone 1. In complete harmony with the general conviction that it is hardly possible to overrate the evil which sorcerers may cause by means of their spectres, legislators in China have for many ages judged that the laws against them can hardly be severe enough. The laws of the Sung dynasty, which are stated in the Standard History to have been modelled upon those of the house of T‘ang (517), put « yen-mei, the use of spells, and the fabrication of sorcerous writings and formulae, as also the transmission of such black arts to others (518), among the most grave crimes. In the code of the Mongol dynasty we read : « He who uses yen-mei against a high officer shall be put to death. A son who uses them against his father, shall, even though a general amnesty take place, live in banishment for life in a remote region ; and a wife, who uses them against her husband, has to submit to his will should he sell her to another husband (519). The Ming dynasty had in its code of laws, in the same title which treats of ku sorcery, an article against yen-mei, which we also find in the same place, copied to the very letter, in the code of the now-reigning house ; in fact both codes in their entirety are actually the same. In that of the present dynasty the article contains, however, some interpolations, which in the following translation we shall place between brackets :  1 Hwan i chi, Record of magical Wonders, ascribed to one Sun Wei, who must have lived in the ninth century. The copy we possess contains fifteen longer and shorter tales of little interest."},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 403 « If yen-mei have been made, or written charms and spells, with the intent to kill somebody, then each culprit (the children and grandchildren, slaves of both sexes, hired labourers, superiors, and seniors, inferiors and juniors of his family) shall be punished as in the case of intent to murder (with a beginning of execution, yet without any infliction of wounds) 1. Should any person have been killed by means of such proceedings, each culprit shall be punished, in accordance with that same law, as if the murder was actually carried into effect 2. Should the crime have been committed merely to-produce disease or suffering in any person, the punishments shall be by two degrees less than those mentioned above, except in the case of children and grandchildren against their parents or paternal grandparents, or slaves of either sex or hired labourers against their masters (520). p.905 « Yen-mei, says the paraphrase of this cruel article, means the performance of magic by means of spectres in subjection, for example, the painting or carving of human images and piercing their hearts, or driving nails into their eyes, or fettering their hands and feet. Those ‘written charms’ refer to the writing of charms or archaic characters for sorcerous use, and to burial of inscribed papers, in order to evoke spectral evil ; furthermore they refer to the burning of such things so as to give in this way orders to spectres to perform their evil work ; — and those ‘spells’ refer to such things as the practice of writing down the year, month and day of the birth of a man whom one desires to kill, and pronouncing spells over the writing. Also on pages 824, 858, 871, 876 and 885 we have seen, that it is by means of charms, spells, formulæ of enchantment or witchery, or by whatever names we choose to call those things, that sorcerers bend the spectres, instrumental to the infliction of evil, to their will, or make them their  1 That is to say, they shall receive one hundred blows with long sticks, and be banished for three years.

V 404 ‘slaves’ ; and on page 876 we have learned that charms are burned for the purpose. It is then evident enough that charms actually are written orders sent into the world of spirits ; in this quality they mostly bear, as is the case with terrestrial official orders, the impress of a seal. They are called fu ; also fu-shu, ‘charm-writings’, or fu-chang, ‘charm-formulæ’. Spells, called cheu or chu, or chuh, ‘imprecations’, no doubt bear likewise the character of orders ; they may be recited or chanted, or exclaimed with vehemence, according as they are deemed to be incantations or bullying phrases. Charms and spells thus may be explicitly said to be the very main spring of sorcery, as but for them spectres would not perform their evil work. A very common method of sorcery also consists in tempting spectres by means of sacrifices to do harm to men. We have read of sacrifices connected with sorcery in the first century of our era p.906 (pp. 844-845) ; we have learned that the incantations by which cat-spectres were launched against ‘objects’, were accompanied by offerings (p. 610) ; and we have read of sacrifices offered to ku (p. 850) and gold caterpillars (p. 858). In Amoy, and no doubt elsewhere equally, sacrifices with sorcerous purpose are especially offered on tombs, and before ownerless soul-tablets or fragments thereof. As a rule the sorcerer will at the same time vow that, as soon as his victim is really smarting under the evil destined for him, he will reward the spectre by burning for it mock money and other things, to an amount stipulated to a farthing. Such sorcery connected with sacrificial bribery is styled in Amoy hē tsoá tsòe khiò, ‘sorcery with a promise of paper’. Inferior spirits in the service of the god of Walls and Moats or the god of the Eastern Mountain, and having their images in the temples of these divinities, are preferably tempted in this way to evil ; but nobody would find it in his heart to approach with such proposals these divinities themselves, or any others of rank and dignity, except in case of serious outrage, when the hand of divine justice is wanted to secure vengeance. Under such circumstances it may even happen that spirits and deities of whatever rank and order are invoked publicly by victims of wrong-doing. This is the ultimate resource for defence, a desperate cry for help to the whole world of spirits and men, and therefore not looked upon as sorcery, not even as a thing bad or unfair, but applauded by public sympathy as a check upon cruel abuse of power."},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 405 In Amoy it is no rare occurrence to see helpless people, pressed hard by merciless creditors or enemies, make use of these means. With hair dishevelled, blackened face, a sheet of mock money behind each ear, the wretched man or woman strides through streets and lanes for a whole day, or even for several days in succession, cursing the foe with all the vehemence at his disposal, pouring out quite a vocabulary of revilings, and calling upon all spirits of heaven and earth by their names and titles to send down upon the guilty head whatever ills they have in store for the wicked. The strange accoutrement of the imprecator associates him with devils and demons who are expected to come and avenge him. In one hand he holds a round flat tray of wickerwork, otherwise used for winnowing rice by throwing it up in the wind ; round the border this object is decorated with fluttering sheets of mock money, and he beats it with a p.907 steel-yard ; hence the local name of this sorcery ; p‘ah poà-ki kó, ‘to beat a tray-drum’. As a mark of his misery and grief, the wretch wears sackcloth, as if he were mourning the loss of his father or mother. His back displays on a piece of linen or paper the name and address of the author of his woes, with a short account of his wicked deeds. One visit at least is paid to the temple of the Eastern Mountain god, and one to that of the god of Walls and Moats, where, prostrate before the images of these two supreme administrators of divine justice, the tray-drummer cries aloud his complaints. The priests in charge of those buildings feel themselves in duty bound to keep him out with gentle, pacifying words, but they stand powerless because of the mob, which with merry inquisitiveness throngs around the oppressed innocent. The height of effect is obtained when the latter gets to the big temple-drum and beats it to arouse the attention of the god, or if, by ringing, the great temple-bell, he convokes all divinities and spirits within hearing distance. But still worse should the victim affix to the bell a shred of paper bearing the oppressor’s name, this being then dinned into the ears of the just gods of vengeance at every peal.

We cannot possibly doubt that there must exist a great many more forms of animistic sorcery, which would fall within the compass of this chapter. We may instance the base attempt to bring down a malicious ghost upon a victim by smearing him with ‘corpse-oil’ (Book I, p. 23), if it may be allowed that such oil contains soul-substance of the dead man beside whose corpse it was burning. @ "},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 407 CHAPTER IV Sorcery by means of Souls of Objects @ p.908 The principle that things which we call lifeless are, according to the Chinese, actually animated, especially if they have a human or somewhat human shape, has been treated by us in Chapter XIII of Part I (pp. 325 sqq.). Naturally, as we have pointed out in Chapter VII of Part II (p. 664), this dogma has led to the inference that such things may be spectres, and may render dangerous all spots where they lie or where they are hidden. These notions, being firmly fixed in the Chinese mind, reduce sorcery to an art so simple that everybody may practise it in a hundred ways. It merely requires concealment of some image, or anything whatever, in the house of the victim, or in something which is next to his person, or which otherwise comes in close contact with him, so that the indwelling soul may do its fatal work. Such instruments of sorcery belong, of course, to the class of yen-mei or ‘spectres in subjection’ to which we have paid attention in the preceding chapter, and they are actually denoted by this name. Such sorcerous things may have been the images which, in the blood-stained last period of the reign and life of Wu of the Han dynasty, were buried in the roads by which he travelled (p. 829), and in the palace of his heir-apparent (pp. 831 and 832). They may, however, have been images of that sovereign, made for purposes of which we shall treat in the next chapter. The practise of hiding images with malicious intent is mentioned in books clearly and often enough to remove all doubts of its actual prevalence in times past and present. An author of the fourteenth century, for instance, wrote the following lines : « The people, being so ignorant, are often beguiled by sorcerous wu. The authorities severely interdict their practices, but nothing can check them. There lived a well-to-do family on the seashore, not accustomed to believe in male and female wu ; therefore,"},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 408 when once they had a house built, a wu told the carpenter to p.909 make a human image of wood and put it within a pillar ; and when the members of the family, after having suffered for some years from sickness, consulted that wu, he declared that there must be some ‘thing in subjection’ hidden in the pillar ; they made an opening in it, and actually found the thing. But on their making enquiries of the carpenter, the latter confessed what the wu had ordered him to do. The family informed the magistrates, and the wu was punished. This event was the origin of the general prohibition which Ho Tszĕ-ching, the prefect of that district, issued at that time against heterodox sacrifices and male and female wu 1. The Tszĕ puh yü also relates such sorcerous tricks. « In Tszĕ-ch‘wen (in Shantung), the great-grandson of the Secretary to the Board Kao Nien-tung, a siu-ts‘ai of the highest class, has himself told me, that in his youth, when he had emptied the marriage-goblet, he got a head-ache and suddenly sank down to the ground in a swoon, unconscious of men and things around him. Some days afterwards he frequently heard a voice by his ears, uttering sounds like leh-leh, and when another period of days had passed away, he saw an apparition like a baby, a little more than one foot high. From that day he grew weak and emaciated, finally being unable to rise from his bed. Convinced that he was under the influence of sorcery, his family called a magician, but the attempts of this man to expel the spectre were of no avail. They now secretly concealed a sword at the head of his bed, and from that moment, whenever he awoke, he saw the child flee hastily from there, and disappear under a wooden bench. They placed a copper basin with water under the latter ; and one day at noon the patient, on waking up from his slumber and seeing the child come, brandished the sword so well that it tumbled into the water p.910  1 Nung-t‘ien yü hwa, a work of the fourteenth century, in two chapters, by an unknown hand ; T S. sect.*, ch. 810."},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 409 with a grating noise. The family now found a wooden image of a child in the basin, in red clothes, with a red cord around its neck, at which it pulled with both its hand as if to strangle itself. They destroyed this image by fire, and thus put an end to that sorcery. Subsequently they were told that a workman in the village had died on the same day. The truth was, that when the graduate married and settled in the house of his wife’s family as an adopted son-in-law, his wife’s father had the roof repaired, on which occasion that workman, because something which he demanded was refused him, had performed that yen-mei sorcery ; but as soon as it was baffled, he himself lost his life (521). It is therefore a strict necessity for any one who has a house built to keep himself on good terms with his masons and carpenters, and to offer them a bounteous meal from time to time ; for should any of them insert a little puppet of wood or lime somewhere into a wall, or under the floor, or in the ridge-beam, apparitions will become frequent, and crowds of spectres of all sorts, vanishing as soon as seen, will keep the inmates in constant alarm by their moaning and whistling. Such black magic becomes more effectual should the perpetrator use a fragment of a human bone for the purpose : indeed, few things are animated so thoroughly as the remains of a human body. A soul-tablet operates very efficaciously also, or a fragment of it, easily snatched out of some public repository for such animated things (Book I, p. 1058). But souls of p.911 animals too can become spectres, and therefore a bone of a cat, dag, goose or fowl may serve the purpose equally well. Thus wives and concubines may by means of objects of sorcery always agreeably break the monotony of their dreary backroom lives, and at the same time satisfy their mutual animosity and jealousy. « Su P‘ei of Wu-kung was prefect of Ch‘u-khiu in the T‘ien pao period (A. D. 742-756). His daughter was married to a member of the Li clan, who, lavishing his favours on a female slave, did not live on the best terms of love and affection with Su P‘ei’s daughter. Then that slave asked a sorcerer to exercise upon this woman his black arts by means of souls in subjection. They buried a charm in"},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 410 the dung-hill of Li’s dwelling, and knitted seven multicoloured puppets, somewhat more than one ch‘ih in site, which they concealed in a hole of the eastern wall, covering the opening with clay, so that nobody knew it. Thus some years passed away, when that slave woman of Li died, so that Su P‘ei’s daughter remained alone in the dwelling ; but when four or five years more had elapsed, the sorcery worked, and the multicoloured women came forth and haunted the dwelling, in consequence of which the lady Su fell sick and became extremely ill. Nobody could guess the cause, Li’s slave being dead’. Another year passed, in the course of which magicians were invited over and over again to come and stop the evil by means of spells ; they came with everything necessary, but could not master it. So they watched for the re-appearance of those spirits and assailed them with several dozen men on all sides, to seize them. They caught one, which they found to be possessed of a complete body with eyebrows and eyes. It wringled incessantly in their hands, and on being belaboured with their swords its blood flowed on the ground. They then burned it on a pile of firewood. The other spirits appeared in the burning-place, p.912 wailing and crying, either in the air or on the ground. And when the incineration was completed, they carved in the house a likeness of a person, and appeared next day in white dress to howl for several days. In half a year the inmates caught successively six puppets more, and burned them. One on being caught escaped, and as they pursued it, it suddenly entered the dung-hill. Su then with more than a hundred men excavated the dung-hill to a depth of seven or eight ch‘ih ; and they found a charm of peach-wood bearing an inscription in red, still legible ; ‘Li’s slave, thus it ran, in order to bewitch the daughter of the Su family with spectres in subjection, makes seven human images ; they are on the east, above a pencil, in an earth basket ; after nine years they must do their work’."},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 411 Following this hint, they broke down the wall and discovered a last puppet, on which Su P‘ei’s daughter suffered no further harm (522). Such simple sorcery is a constant lurking danger, against which every honest man has always to be on the alert. Wise parents, who marry a son and want a new quilt for his nuptial bed, can hardly dispense with the precaution of inviting the maker of it a few times to dinner and paying him on additional fee, for should this man conceal two paper puppets of very diminutive size within the cotton, or twist two bits of flock into something like human forms, discord is certain to arise between the young couple from the very first moment they share the bed. Great harm may also be inflicted by p.913 putting objects, or characters and signs expressing evil, into an enemy’s family-grave ; indeed, the felicity of the soul which dwells therein being thus destroyed, it will no longer protect and bless its offspring, and may even henceforth injure their prosperity. That the legislator takes this view, is evident from the fact that he has inserted the following lines among the commentaries on the article which treats of sorcery by means of yen-mei, charms, and spells (p. 904) : « Whoever, cherishing a grudge, clandestinely puts a stake of peach-wood into the ancestral grave of another, with intent to frustrate the fung-shui of the same, shall be punished as if he had used spectres in subjection, written charms, or spells, with intent to render others ill or miserable, that is to say, two degrees less severely than the law would demand if he had planned a murder and begun to execute the crime, yet without inflicting any wounds — viz. with banishment for two years. Sentence passed in Chehkiang, in the 22nd year of the Kia khing period (A. D. 1817). Such malpractices are by no means modern, for we have given our readers on page 1030 of Book I an excerpt from one of the Standard Histories, telling of the grave of an imperial concubine in the sixth century of our era, in which a waxen goose and other things were secretly buried, in order to further her own son’s interests to the detriment of those of the emperor. @"},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 412 CHAPTER V Other Forms of Sorcery @ p.914 If it is possible to harm a person by means of souls and spirits, it may be possible also to harm him by means of his own soul, that is to say, by removing it from his body. We have, indeed, read in the Code of Laws (see p. 871) of miscreants stealing the vital breath or soul out of men, in order to employ there in evil-doing ; but no details of such soul-thefts are given there. There need not, however, be any mystery about the consequences of such thefts, since we have described in a special chapter (pp. 96 sqq.) the ills which the absence of his soul causes to a living man. That chapter has given us two stones of men who, without any intent to do harm, extracted souls out of women by means of evocation, connected with the use of magical charms. And on page 818 we have read of a Taoist, trying with the aid of a spell and a hook to draw the soul and life out of an enemy, this criminal work being frustrated merely by the circumstance that his victim possessed perfect command of his nervous system. The conclusion may then be drawn, that China possesses soul-thieves pursuing an object other than that of the sorcerers treated in Chapter III, who want ‘souls in subjection’ as instruments. It can hardly be doubted that those thieves too do their work mainly by means of charms and spells. To this conclusion we are led by the following narrative : « In Kwangsi people trust and respect ‘spectre-masters’. There were two men there, members of the tribes Ch‘en and Lai, who could catch lives, to put them in the place of those of dying men. Families with patients frequently engaged them. When one came, he covered a cup of water with paper, and suspended it upside down over the bed of the patient ; on the next day he came back to see him, and if no water had trickled out all that time, he declared that help was possible. Or he took a cock, stuck a clean knife seven or eight inches long into its throat, and held p.915 the"},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 413 bird before the patient, suppressing his own respiration and reciting spells ; and if after the spells no blood had trickled out of the bill of the cock, he likewise declared that help might be afforded ; he then drew the knife out of the cock, and threw it upon the ground, and the bird flew away as before. But if a drop of the water or the blood had trickled down, he took his departure, unable to help. If a cure was possible, he put up an altar, and suspended there some dozens of painted portraits of shen and kwei ; then the spectre-master, dressed like a woman, stepped a kang dance and uttered spells to the sound of a gong and a drum. And when the night had come, he made a lantern of oiled paper, and in the open country called a soul (hwun) with an indistinct voice. Then the soul of a soundly sleeping neighbour obeyed his call and came ; the spectre-master compelled it to take the lantern in hand and go away, and if then he congratulated the family, the patient recovered, while the man who had taken the lantern in hand died. There was, however, a way to neutralize the effects of such work, consisting in this, that whosoever heard his gong and drum in the night, placed himself with both his feet on the ground ; no harm then occurred to him. In this way Ch‘en and Lai became rich. The hall in their house was gradually converted into a pitch-dark place, where they sacrificed to a very large number of images of kwei and shen. p.916 The wife of my father’s younger brother fell ill, and invited the spectre-master Lai to see her. With a sword in his hand he tried to seize the spectre, and in the room a beast like a large bat crept under her bed. Lai there attacked it with the character ‘thunder’ written in his palm, but the fire flashed out of his hand in the wrong direction and scorched his beard. He flew into a passion, ordered t’ung oil to be boiled in a pan, and wrote a charm, which he burned ; and after he had stirred the oil in the pan with his hand, the spectre was heard under the bed suing for pardon with a"},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 414 chirping voice. After a while it became silent, and the woman was restored to health. One day, when spectre-master Ch‘en was calling upon a soul on behalf of a family, he saw a girl in blue clothes slowly approach. Looking at her attentively, he recognized his own daughter, who came to take the lantern in hand. Greatly startled he flung the light to the ground, slapped her on the back, and hurried home to look at his daughter, who just awoke from her sleep with a shudder, saying : — I came because I dreamt you were calling me. And the blue linen gown she wore bore the greasy marks of his hand. « In Kwei-lin, the prefect Wei had a daughter lying dangerously ill. His wife invited Ch‘en to come, and see her, and Ch‘en demanded a hundred coins ; but the prefect, a severe man, had him arrested, flogged with sticks, and sent to gaol ; yet the spectre-master smiled, and said : — Beware of remorse for the blows inflicted on me. While they flogged the spectre-master, the daughter suddenly cried from her bed : — Ch‘en orders two spectres to flog my buttocks with sticks ; they are putting me in gaol. The affrighted wife forthwith demanded that he should be set free ; she promised him double pay, but Ch‘en said : — While at work I have been scared by evil spirits ; my best efforts will now be powerless. And the girl died (523). p.917 Yet other means are mentioned in China of depriving a living man of his soul. We have seen on pp. 108 seq. that a soul, while outside a man when he is sleeping, may be sorcerously prevented from returning into him by means of sacrificial articles placed beside his bed ; thinking this is a funeral offering,"},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 415 the soul will then believe the man to be dead, and go elsewhere, thus causing death actually to follow. The same effect may, according to many, be reached by painting or blackening a sleeping man’s face, whereby the wandering soul will fail to recognize him on returning. Our chapters cannot, of course, make any pretence to depict the whole field of Chinese sorcery. The domain of Animism indeed is extensive enough to allow of the invention of sorcerous tricks and practices in indefinite numbers. There also exists sorcery in which no animistic element appears visibly, so that it is doubtful whether it falls within the compass of our work. Such is for instance black magic exerted directly upon the victim, his image, name, or horoscope, either by means of charms or spells, or by ill-treatment of any kind. The reader knows that charms and spells used for letting loose malicious spectres upon men, are commands, formulae imposing obedience. Their use consequently implies an implicit belief in the power and efficacy of words written or spoken. Felicitations, curses, and words in general arouse thoughts of realities, and thoughts may be strong enough to convince simple minds that the realities are present. Words therefore effectuate what they express ; they do not merely represent realities, but are the realities themselves. This principle has been illustrated in this work by various customs and p.918 usages 1 ; it is a principal factor in Chinese exorcising and religious magic, and will as such come to the foreground in particular in Chapter XII of the next Part of this Book, and regularly later on. Hence it necessarily follows, that spells and charms which express evil amply suffice for the performance of sorcery, and no auxiliary or intermediary spectres are wanted. Charms and spells were, in fact, (see pp. 829 seq. and 832) used against Wu of the Han dynasty, and it therefore seems admissible that they were instruments of sorcery in much earlier times, considering also that we find them in use among peoples in very low stages of civilisation. That the penal laws of China have for many centuries attached to their use  1 See the Index of Book I, Characters and Words."},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 416 the same punishments as to the use of ‘spectres in subjection’, we have seen from the article translated on page 904. Charms and spells for purposes of sorcery, whether they convey orders to the spectres, or express the harm which is to be inflicted, generally do so in occult forms or terms, into the particulars of which, owing to the want of data, we cannot enter. They may, however, have the simplest form imaginable ; a shred of paper, for instance, inscribed with the character or ‘to kill’, and hidden in the clothes of somebody, even in those which he does not wear, may suffice to kill him and all his family. Characters expressing disease or any evil whatever, may he concealed in an enemy’s house, nay, even a scrawl of strokes and dots may harm him and his family, because perchance something resembling a letter may be formed therein. A character representing a spectre may render a man’s house a prey to any devil desired, especially if the sorcerer enhances its operation by means of spells. The written name of an insect may make his dwelling the haunt of vermin, or at every meal ruin the appetite of the family by suddenly producing in the bowls and dishes cockroaches, centipedes, or lice. In short, sorcery here has the widest scope ; everything imaginable may find a place in it. We have seen in this work so many symbolic representations of felicity actually producing felicity in the opinion of the Chinese, that we cannot but allow that representations of evil, however faint or fantastic they be, ought to be believed by them to produce evil ; and all such representations may be classed by us in the long list of sorcerous charms. Charms and spells may also serve rogues to benumb the senses of others, so as to cause them to fall into traps and snares. So p.919 firmly do the Chinese believe in the reality of such dangers that the Code of Laws contains a notice, to this effect : « There exists a murderous, detestable rabble who use charms and spells, herbs or food to decoy boys and girls, in order to dismember them, or to roast or rob their brains and marrow. Such people must be traced and arrested by the district magistrates, arraigned, and punished. Should any of these authorities fall short"},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 417 in discovering them, they shall be degraded two steps (in the record of merits in the Board of Civil Office) (524). It is interesting to read also in Chinese books, that harm may be wrought upon a victim by pronouncing evil over characters expressing the year, month, day, and hour of his birth, and that this circumstance is made use of by sorcerers to fascinate those whose life they want to ‘pluck out’, or whose soul they want to rob (see pp. 872, 875, 905). Those characters are eight in number, forming four binomiums from the sexagenary cycles (Book I, p. 103) used for counting years, days, months and hours. They constitute the horoscope of the man, which determines his fate for ever ; therefore to injure this horoscope is to injure his fate. To write them down and inscribe imprecations across, or pronounce curses and spells on them, or harm them in any other way, is to apply cruelly the ethnic law of association and identification of representations with their realities. In Amoy a common trick also is to paste a shred of paper, bearing those birth-dates as well as the name of the victim, upon the bell of some temple, because every peal when the bell is rung will then shake and stir his person and fortunes most tremendously. Fortunately there are many people against whom sorcery in whatever form, and in this form in particular, is powerless. These are they whose four natal binomiums are, according to almanacks or soothsayers, or even in spite of those books and men, all of first rate quality ; of these children of fortune the eight characters are ‘heavy’, thus forming a natural destiny which is as good as an impregnable stronghold defying all attacks. But woe to those whose eight characters are ‘light’ ! these are they whom sorcerers victimize. p.920 Persons who become silly or idiots are commonly looked upon as victims of sorcerous attacks made upon their horoscopes. Everybody in Amoy occasionally has to place his horoscope in the hands of soothsayers, chronomancers and geomancers for the purpose of allowing them to derive predictions from it with regard to its owner’s fate, fortunes, and chances of success in his enterprises. No wonder therefore that those professors of occult arts lie under constant suspicion of sorcery, or at least of betraying for money horoscopes to those who want them for works of"},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 418 iniquity. No wonder also that every man of cunning and prudence seeks protection by a most careful concealment of the two characters which denote the hour of his birth ; the other six define his birth with less precision, and therefore are not so dangerous to his fate in malicious hands. The objection to divulging natal hours is so great, that in written prayers addressed to gods and ancestors at sacrifices, in which the offerers, in order to obey established custom, are wont to describe themselves with some precision, they only inscribe the year, month and day of their birth, replacing the horary characters by the neutral term ‘auspicious hour’. Charms and spells may also inflict every sort of harm on a victim if they are made to work upon something representing his body. The reader remembers that we have demonstrated (pp. 339 sqq.) how closely the Chinese are wont to associate beings with their likenesses. They then are perfectly aware that it is possible to harm a man by maltreating or cursing an image of his ; he will then suffer everything which the image suffers, especially if the identity between both is intensified by writing on the image the name and horoscope of the man. This method, according to my native informants, is extensively practised. In Amoy the images used for the purpose are mostly very roughly made of two bamboo splinters fastened together crosswise, on one side of which is pasted some paper supposed to represent a human body. They are not larger than a hand, and those of men are distinguished from those of women by two shreds of paper, said to be boots. They are called t‘òe sin, ‘substitutes or surrogates of a person’, and may be had, for a cash or so a piece, in every shop where paper articles are made and sold for sacrifice to the dead and the gods, for they are also burnt as slaves for the dead in the other world. In particular they are used for exorcising practices and religious magic, to be p.921 described by us afterwards. Even a few straws, bound together crosswise, suffice for sorcerous ends, the identity of a person with his surrogate being not nearly so much established by its form as by his name and horoscope, attached to it on paper 1.  1 It is clear that the use of puppets of sorcery thus inscribed rests on the same principle which underlies the use of soul-tablets for the dead, these being likewise assimilated with individuals because they bear their names, dates of birth and death,"},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 419 Menfolk generally assert that this form of black art is especially practised by the fair sex. Hatred of tyrannous husbands ; mutual jealousy of wives and concubines, aroused by a partial distribution of sexual and other favours by the common husband ; domestic quarrels and animosities of all sorts, from which no home in China is exempt, are things which easily convert female apartments into nurseries of occult iniquity. Besmearing the ‘substitute’ of a rival with faeces, or throwing it into the privy, in order to infect herself with a foul smell which may turn the husband’s affection into aversion, is there the order of the day, and so is burial of substitutes, or thrashing them amidst loud curses and maledictions, female slaves showing special ingenuity in such refined malpractices. The use of ‘surrogates’ also has the advantage of enabling sorcerers and sorceresses to hurt their victims in whatever parts of their bodies they desire. If the puppet’s eyes are pierced with a nail, pin or needle, and at the same time the proper spell or curse is pronounced, the victim may become blind, especially if the pricking object is not removed ; a pin in the belly may produce colic ; in the heart it may entail death ; the more pricks, and the louder the spells, the more certain is the effect. In this way poor Moon-in-the-west was treated (p. 876). Surrogates are often thrown away in busy streets, in order that the crowd may trample them ; but he whose eyes fall upon one is sure to turn aside, and will spit upon it to annul its effects. In all cases, such sorcery is more effectual if the connexion of the surrogate with the ‘object’ is intensified by passing it beforehand over him, or hiding it in his clothes for a time, or under his chair or bed. In Amoy it is said to be far from unusual to bring ‘objects’ by means of puppets of sorcery within the grip of spirits of low rank in the service of the God of Walls and Moats or of the Eastern Mountain ; indeed, these gods are the judges of human souls, who often order their underlings to extract souls out of living men and draw them before their tribunals. When a man deems himself p.922 wronged by another, he may successfully hide a paper substitute of him close by the image of a lictor in the temple of one of those gods, at the same time enjoining on that being by means of imprecation with a sacrifice of     and other particulars descriptive of their persons."},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 420 some food or dainties, to arrest the soul of the wrong-doer, in order that this may suffer before the divine judge just the same terrible torture which terrestrial mandarins are wont to inflict on men whom they arraign. In the temple of the Eastern Mountain is a large cylinder of wood, which, revolving perpendicularly on an axis, lifts the souls of women who died in the state of contamination by childbirth, out of a tank of blood in which they abide in hell to expiate that state. Women do not shrink from throwing substitutes of members of their sex under this instrument of salvation, in order that these women may die in childbed and be plunged into that tank. The method of causing injury by means of images apparently is old. We have read of puppets in the account of the great ku incident of the Han dynasty, which may have been ‘spectres in subjection’, though the possibility is not excluded that they were ‘substitutes’ of Wu’s own august person buried in the ground, either to cause sympathetically his death and burial, or in order to receive his soul-substance on his passing by, and thus become fit for being operated on successfully. It is a fact that in the historical account of a similar event in A. D. 453, upon which we have touched on page 1408 of Book I, it is explicitly stated that the puppets used were images of the emperor. That account is of sufficient interest to be related in its entirety : « There was a female wu, Yen Tao-yuh by name, who pretended to have communication with spiritual influences and beings (ling), and to possess the faculty of having in her employ spectral beings. Being introduced to an imperial princess by her slave woman Wang Ying-wu, she gained the favour of Shao, the crown-prince, and of Siün, the second prince, « who respectfully employed her and called her Celestial Master ; and after her directions they made wu-ist ku, and made an image of the emperor, consisting of a puppet of jade, which they buried in front of the Han-chang hall. p.923 Those princes indeed were conscious of many offences, which they feared their father might discover and punish. Wang Ying-wu was their accomplice, together with Ch‘en T‘ien-hing, a male slave of the princess, brought up by Wang Ying-wu and used by her for the satisfaction of her sexual appetites."},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 421 Yet a fourth in the sorcery plot was the eunuch Khing Kwoh. The princess happened to die, and Wang Ying-wu was thereupon given by the crown-prince as a concubine to one of his officers, named Ch‘en Hwai-yuen, who discovered her secret relation with Ch‘en T‘ien-hing. On his request the crown-prince put this slave to death. This execution filled Khing Kwoh with fears, it being well known that he too was one of Wang Ying-wu’s intimate friends ; hence, to save himself, he revealed the sorcery to the emperor. This occurred in the seventh month of the year 452. The Son of Heaven had Ying-wu arrested. Her dwelling was searched, and this led to the discovery of a great many papers from Shao and Siün, all relating to spells and wu-ist ku ; also the buried image was found. Tao-yuh managed to escape, and was sought in vain, even in the provinces. The two princes did not even try to purge themselves of their guilt, and at once made open confession. The younger one took the missing woman with him to the river-port of the capital, and from there into the northern army, under disguise of a Buddhist nun, and he even ventured to return with her to the capital in the second month of next year. But all this iniquity was betrayed to the emperor by two female slaves. He divested Shao of his dignity of heir-apparent, and ordered Siün to commit suicide. These sentences were a signal for these princes to try a coup d’état. In the early morning, while the guards were still sleeping, Shao made an onset on the Palace, and his partisan Chang Ch‘ao-chi killed the emperor, cutting off his five fingers. Several grandees were slain ; Shao placed himself on the throne, and adopted the style of reign T‘ai ch‘u or ‘the very first beginning’, suggested to him by Tao-yuh. But the third imperial prince, lawful successor in consequence of the deposition of the eldest and the condemnation of the second, raised a large power in the provinces. After a short campaign and a naval struggle on the Yang-tszĕ, his troops conquered the p.924 capital, which was pacified by means of twenty-two days of great bloodshed. Shao, found in a well in the arsenal, was decapitated ; Siün escaped on horseback from the city, but had to surrender to the general of the victorious army, who beheaded him. Their wives, concubines and children were put to death or compelled to commit"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 422 suicide. The heads of the princes were exposed on stakes, and afterwards thrown into the Yang-tszĕ together with their bodies. Their faction was exterminated ; Chang Ch‘ao-chi’s body was partly devoured by the soldiers, partly burned (see p. 369). Shao, compelled to betray the place where he had hidden the imperial seals, said they were in the abode of Yen Tao-yuh. This entailed new searches for her and for Wang Ying-wu ; they were discovered, and publicly flogged to death ; their corpses were burned, and the ashes strewed in the Yang-tszĕ (525). The principle that images are physically connected with that which they represent is stated without reservation in the practice of sorcery. People have told me with the utmost seriousness that shipowners and merchants are not seldom ruined by enemies furtively drawing the faint outlines of a junk somewhere at the entrance of their homes with the bow pointing to the street ; their ships then sail out, but do not return. In one of the celebrated tales of P‘u Sung-ling we read : « A man in Shansi, whose names I have forgotten, a member of the White Lotus sect and a disciple of Sü Hung-jü 1, misled the masses by heterodox doctrines, and many who wished to learn his magic worshipped him as their master. One day having to depart, he placed a basin in the main apartment of his house, and covered it with another basin, telling his disciple to sit down by it and watch it, without, however, lifting up the cover to see. But after his departure the disciple did what had been forbidden him, and saw that there was clean water in the basin and a ship of plaited straw floating on it, fully rigged with sails and masts. His curiosity induced him to take it up with his fingers, but it was capsized thereby ; he set it up in its former position, and put the cover over it, when suddenly his master came back. — Why have you disobeyed me ? he angrily exclaimed.  1 A rebellious leader of the Lotus-sect who assumed imperial dignity in Shantung in the period of the downfall of the Ming dynasty. See my Sectarianism and Religious Persecution in China, p. 167 seq. "},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 423 The disciple retorted he had done nothing, but the master said : p.925 — Do you think you can deceive me ? My ship has just now capsized at sea (526). There is standard history to prove that the Chinese even deem it possible to destroy conjugal affection by operating on emblems thereof painted or drawn. In the History of the Kin Dynasty we read the following incident, which occurred in A. D. 1209 : « The late emperor (Chang Tsung) had had his special favourites, of whom the lady Li (his principal concubine) was jealous. She told a female wu, named Li Ting-nü, to make a human image of paper and wood, and a charm representing a couple of mandarin ducks (which are in China symbols of conjugal attachment, see Book I, p. 471), and to direct ‘spectres in subjection’ to use these, in order to cut short the line of the imperial progeny with those things. As nobody could fully explain what evil she had done, the emperor, as soon as the matter had transpired, ordered a high officer to submit her to an interrogation, and on her confessing everything, commissioned high ministers to examine her ; and as these grandees obtained no other results, the judges pronounced her worthy of death in accordance with the laws, demanding, however, that she should be reprieved on account of her having for so long a time bestowed care on the late sovereign. But now imperial princes and officers came forward with a memorial demanding that the emperor should definitely order her to put an end to herself (527). Her mother, crazed with age, was p.926 put to death ; her two brothers, high grandees, were divested of all their dignities and banished, and some accomplices of high rank were rigorously punished or executed. Not only likenesses, names and horoscopes may serve for inflicting sorcery, but also parts of the body and clothing of the ‘object’. This shows that either the connexion between such things and the individual himself is not deemed to be broken, or a portion of the latter is identified or associated with him, since, like his image, name or horoscope, it calls up thoughts of"},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 424 him, or such a portion is deemed to contain a part of his soul. We know that fragments of a dead man contain substance of his soul ; why then should this not be the case with fragments of a living man ? Hairs, nail-clippings, even droppings, are efficient instruments of sorcery, as well as old shoes and garments, queue-threads, buttons, etc. ; caning or burning, imprecating or chanting spells over such things may render the former owner ill or unhappy, or may even kill him. Hence it passes for prudence not to give cast-off garments to paupers or beggars. Such sorcery is no doubt performed in China on a extensive scale. Ch‘en Tsang-khi in the eighth century advised that « hair of a runaway person should be taken and laid out crosswise on the woof of loom ; he will then get so confused that he will not know where to go (528). By application of the same principle, injury may be inflicted upon cattle, dogs and cats of an enemy, and may make these ill, stubborn or mad, nay even his lifeless possessions may in this way be spoiled or destroyed. We read of « a wu in the district of Teng-ch‘ing, which forms a part of Siang-yang (Hupeh pr.), who could spoil the brew of spirit-distillers by sorcery, and therefore was feared and respected by all wineshop-keepers. In every spring and autumn he visited their shops to collect gifts, and they gave him 20,000 coins in each of the dozen shops which were there, and for this pay they enjoyed peace the whole year round. Once he was short of money for some reason, and applied to a well-to-do distiller for some additional pay, but was put off with a scornful refusal. Therefore, on leaving the chop, he bought a pint of p.927 liquor, put it into a small vase, and stirred some dung into it ; subsequently he repaired to a copse to pace a Yü dance and mutter spells, and having walked there several times around the mixture, he buried it in the ground, and went away. On a sudden the whole row of jars in the distillery emitted a stench of dung. A Taoist doctor said : — I possess a magical art which may remedy this evil, but the liquor already spoiled it is too late to save."},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol. V 425 Burning incense, he applied his art, with the result that after half a day the stench had disappeared (529). Our chapters on Chinese sorcery, though very deficient, have mentioned much which has been found to occur also among other peoples of the earth, including not a few at a low stage of civilisation. We learn from Sui Yuen that Chinese sorcery also has traits in common with sorcery of non-Chinese people living in Hainan island. « In Yai-cheu, which belongs to Kwangtung, one half of the inhabitants are Li natives, divided into barbarous Li and civilised Li. Among the fair sex of this people there are women who keep spectres in subjection, and are able to bewitch men by means of spells so well that they die. They perform their sorcery by getting possession of some hair from the beard or the head of the man who is to be belaboured with spells, or a bit of a penang nut which he has spat out ; having put this in a bamboo case, the sorceress lies down in the night on the top of a hill in a state of nature, her face upwards, working upon it under the stars and the moon with charms and spells, with the result that the man dies on the seventh day. Not the slightest injury is then to be discovered on his body, which is as supple as cotton. Those hags can bewitch none but Li people ; Chinese are beyond their reach. If those injured by their attacks arrest one and take her p.928 to the magistrate, they are sure to pass the rope, which they sling round her neck in order to drag her thither, through a long bamboo, lest she may get near them and bewitch them. These hags pretend that, if the period (of seven days) should elapse without the sorcery taking effect, they themselves must die. Some among them perform such practices when still young, even before their marriage. The art has been transmitted to them by their ancestors. Their spells are very occult. Such witches may be beaten to death without betraying each other. Only sorceresses of this kind exist, and no sorcerers, the art being delivered by the women exclusively to their own sex (530). @"},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"The religious system of China vol.
