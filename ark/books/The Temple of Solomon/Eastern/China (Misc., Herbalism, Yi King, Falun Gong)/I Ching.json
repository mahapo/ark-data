By the time of the Han dynasty (206 BC to 220 AD) it became some-thing similar to the text we know today as the “Classic of Changes” or “Book of Changes” (易经). Of course, the interpretation of the text has changed over time, but the ordering of the material has remained unchanged since the Han Dynasty to the present.The Classic of Changes is composed of 64 short chapters, composed of several elements and 10 appendixes, known as “The Ten Wings”. The parts of each chapter (commonly called hexagrams) are:•\tA graphic symbol (卦 Gua), which is a drawing composed of six par-allel\tlines,\tsome\tfilled\tand\tother\tbroken.\tExample:\tG.•\t A\t text\t that\t explains\tthe\t meaning\tof\tthe\t hexagram\tand\t whose\tfirst\t one\tor two characters give it its name (卦辞 GuaCi), commonly called “The Judgment”.•\tShort texts attached to each of the six lines (爻辞 YaoCi), except for the hexagrams 1 and 2 that have seven texts.•\tSeveral texts, from the Ten Wings: The Image (DaXiang), the Tuan Commentary, etc.Composition of the text according to Chinese traditionLegend has it that FuXi (伏羲) designed the 64 hexagrams (hypothetically about 3000 BC) and King Wen (周文王) wrote the texts that accompany each hexagram, GuaCi, “The Judgment”.Preface"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"8His son, the Duke Dan of Zhou (周公旦) added explanatory texts for each line of the hexagrams.The texts due to King Wen and his son were know in his time (the Bronze Age in China) as ZhouYi (周易), “The Changes of the Zhou” being Zhou the name of the dynasty started by King Wen.Several hundred years later, the Confucian school added comments to the text, which are known as the Ten Wings (十翼 ShiYi), and are divided into ten parts.These comments can be placed at the end of the text, as appendixes, or inserted into each hexagram, as is usually done with the commentary called “The Image”, which comprises part of the Wings 3rd and 4th.Modern hypothesis about the origin of the textOn the origin of the hexagrams symbols and the texts that accompany them there is no certainty, but it might be possible that the traditional story about the composition of the text (The Judgment and the lines) is correct and that King Wen\t–which\twas\ta\treal\t historical\tfigure–\t was\t the\t compiler\tof\ttexts\t from\tthe\toracular tradition (circa 1000 BC), and that his son did something similar for the lines of the hexagrams.The Ten Wings come from various sources, some of them certainly are of the Confucian school, but it is not currently believed that they are a direct work from the hand of Confucius. Probably the Ten Wings were composed between 200 BC and 200 A.D., during the Han dynastyEuropean translationsThe\t first\t translations\tfrom\t Chinese\tto\t Western\tlanguages\t\t\twere\t done\t by\tJesuits, who translated the text into Latin and French. Much later, during the nine-teenth century English and French translations began to appear.The most prestigious of the English translations of the nineteenth century was that of James Legge; the following translation of importance (in German) was the one from Richard Wilhelm, which was published in 1924. Later, this same translation was translated into English by Cary Baynes, and published in 1950. It remains the most popular English translation until today.Throughout the XX century many other translations appeared, but most of them were only recombinations of previous versions but not true translations.In the last decades of the twentieth century several new English transla-tions tried to shed light on the original meaning of the YiJing, going as far back to its origins as a document from the Bronze Age, trying to separate the layers of the original text to understand the original meaning of the earlier parts of the text. Some of them are the translations from Kunst, Rutt, Shaughnessy and Whincup; all of them attempt to elucidate the original meaning of the Chinese characters in the earlier layers of the YiJing."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"9Limitations of translations to Western languagesMost Chinese characters have a wide range of meanings, and its symbolic richness makes them particularly suitable for oracular use. When translated into another language it is impossible to preserve the multiple meanings in the original text, because the translator is forced to choose words that cannot cover the full range of meanings of the Chinese characters. As an example, a common character (repeated 34 times) in the YiJing is 悔, hui, commonly translated as “repentance.” That translation is not incorrect, but the word originally meant “problems.” Considering both meanings, the word refers to an objective situation and the internal reaction to it, but there is not an English word that covers the two meanings.Another common word is 亨, heng, which appears 47 times, and means “success,\tachievement,\tsatisfaction,\tgrowth,\tpenetration,\toffering,\tsacrifice.”\tAny\ttranslation into a Western language will exclude some of those meanings. It is usually translated as “success” but that word does not cover the rich array of meanings of the original word."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"11Introduction to the TranslationThis translation attempts to facilitate an approach to the YiJing original text*. It includes The Judgment (GuaCi) and the comments for the lines. From the Ten Wings it only includes The Image (DaXiang).For each Chinese character it shows its pronunciation and its assigned number,\tto\tallow\tfinding\tit\tin\tthe\tdictionary.The characters shown on a gray background at the start of each hexagram are the ones used as tag for each hexagram, which are the hexagram’s “title”. Most of the hexagrams use a single character as tag, although some use two.This translation attempts to maintain balance between two extremes:•\t A\tliteral\ttranslation,\twhich\twould\tbe\tvery\tdifficult\tto\tunderstand,\tand;•\tA translation of high literary level that for the sake of style would dis-tort the meaning of the text.Since Chinese characters have gained new meanings but also lost some archaic meanings, along the millennia, when possible, we choose words that cover both the original and the newer meanings**, always inside the time frame from * The original text used for this translation is 周易折中 Zhouyi Zhezhong, “Balanced Com-ments on Zhouyi”, published in 1715 under the patronage of Qing Dynasty, is the same text used by Wilhelm and many other sinologists as the basis of their translations.** A good example is the term in JunZi, 君子, which appears 73 times in the text. In many translations it is translated as “noble,” which captures well the range of meanings of JunZi, but in some versions it is translated as “superior man”, a term used by the Confucian school. It is not wrong to use the term “superior man”, but it restricts arbitrarily the range of meanings and leaves out the original meaning used by the author of the ZhouYi. Using “noble” is preferable because it covers both the original (son of a lord) and and the newer (superior man) meanings."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"121000 BC to 200 AD, which was the approximate time when the Ten Wings were ended.The graphic layout of the Chinese characters was designed to reduce the space\t occupied\ton\t the\t page,\t so\t that\t each\t hexagram\tcan\t fit\t in\t two\t pages.\t Line\tbreaks\tare\tnot\tsignificant.The Chinese characters indicating the numbering of the lines were omit-ted, because they do not add anything to the text’s meaning."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"13Introduction to the DictionaryThe dictionaries of Chinese characters can be divided into two different types: dictionaries of single characters and dictionaries of words (composed of multiple characters).Currently, most Chinese language words are composed of several charac-ters, but in antiquity that was not the case.This dictionary is primarily a dictionary of characters, although it also ex-plains many multi-character words.Unfortunately the Chinese characters do not have a single pronunciation; multiple characters may share the same sound. For example 悔 pronunciation is hui3, but also other 16 characters have the same pronunciation, and there are 127 different characters that are pronounced hui, regardless of the accent (which is indicated by the number).For most of the twentieth century the Wade-Giles system was used to indi-cate how to pronounce Chinese characters. Wade-Giles is a romanization system, which shows the pronunciation with western letters. But in the last decades of the 20th century, the Pinyin pronunciation system (meaning “sound-spelling”) was adopted by China and since then it prevailed almost universally.Pinyin uses four tones to indicate the pronunciation of each syllable, in-dicating the tone either with different accents (e.g., huī, huí, huǐ and huì) or with numbers (e.g. hui1, hui2, hui3 and hui4).In this dictionary, the pronunciation of each character is indicated using Pinyin. The numbers shown in Pinyin syllables indicate the accent. The appendix on PinYin pronunciation has more information about this topic.The numbers assigned to the characters are the same used by the Mathew’s Chinese-English dictionary. Notice that characters with numeration over 7773 are"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"14not included in Mathew’s dictionary. Also the numbers used by Karlgren’s Gram­mata Serica Recensa dictionary are show for each character.The radical number and stroke count for each character are indicated as well.\t This\t is\t useful\t when\t looking\tfor\t the\t definition\tof\ta\t character\tin\t others\t dic-tionaries than Mathew’s or Karlgren’s, since locating characters by radical number and stroke count is very common in Chinese dictionaries.The meaning of some Chinese characters has been maintained throughout the ages, but in many cases new meanings have been added and/or old meanings have changed.In general, we have attempted to provide both the archaic and the modern meanings. To avoid confusion anachronisms and modern meanings, not in use in the past, are omitted.To indicate where characters are located in the text, the placement of the characters is shown by adding a point and a letter or number after the number of the hexagram.0 indicates The Judgment; 1 to 6 indicate a Line number;7 indicates the comment for the cases when all lines change, in hexagramas 1 or 2;X indicates The Image.Characters included in this dictionaryThis dictionary includes all the characters found in The Judgment, The Image and the lines. Although the image is of much later origin than the Judg-ment and lines (the texts known as ZhouYi), it has become common to include the image next to the oldest texts and we follow that custom. In total the dictionary includes more than 900 characters, plus dozens of words composed of multiple characters.Since\t 1956\t simplified\tcharacters\tare\t in\t use\t China,\t but\t this\t work\t shows\t only\tthe traditional characters used for the last two millennia.Archaic characters are found in inscriptions on oracle bones (mostly from the Shang Dynasty). Other ancient characters can be found in archaic bronzes of the Shang and Zhou dynasties. In many cases these archaic character are shown in the dictionary, below the normal ones, when they clarify the character’s original meaning."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"YIJIng TRAnSLATIOn"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"161.

It means that Yang and Yin interact, stimulating each other.Each hexagram can be divided into two trigrams, which are groups of three consecutive lines, either the lower or the upper three lines. There are only eight trigrams, which are called ba gua, 八卦 (ba means eight) because there are only eight ways to combine broken and whole lines in groups of three.Although tradition tells us that the tri-grams preceded the hexagrams, there is no proof of that. They may have been abstracted from the hexagrams something between the creation of the ZhouYi text (comprising The Judgment and the lines) and the composition of the Ten Wings, which mention the tri-grams.The names of the eight trigrams refer to the natural elements: Qian (Heaven), Kun (Earth), Zhen (Thunder), Kan ( Wa-ter), Gen (Mountain), Xun (Wind or Wood), Li (Fire) and Dui (Lake).It is important to understand the sym-bolic meanings of each trigram, and how they relate to each other to com-prehend better the main idea of the hexagrams.The image at the top of the next col-umn shows the arrangement of the trigrams in the Inner-World (Later Heaven), arrangement, which is tradi-tionally attributed to king Wen, and is the one used in the Eight Wing, the ShuoGua, which also provides most of the meanings for the trigrams.
