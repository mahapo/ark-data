China"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"IntroductionThis book at heart is a study of stories told and retold; thus it is fittingthat it begins with a story. The following anecdote was published in 1194by the prolific chronicler of the strange and miraculous, Hong Mai, inthe eleventh installment of hisTales of the Listener.Hong informed hisreaders that the story was passed on to him by Zhu Conglong, an oth-erwise unknown figure who apparently was a refugee from the Jin king-dom then ruling north China. The story is undated, but the rest of theanecdotes attributed by Hong to Zhu date from the 1140s and 1150s,and this one probably does as well.Liu Xiang, a shopkeeper, had the good fortune of marrying a beauti-ful wife née Zheng, but his business fared poorly. Wretched and haggard,the disheartened Liu would spend his days drinking with rather unsa-vory companions in the tavern. Zheng, abandoned to suffer hunger andprivation alone, bitterly resented her husband’s absence. One day Zhengcontracted a feverish illness. After a few days she recovered somewhat,but she withdrew to her bedchamber, where she would sit and stare with-out uttering a word. Whenever her husband approached, Zheng scowledand sneered at him. Liu, more despondent than ever, left home altogether.His wife sealed herself in the house, admitting no visitors, yet it oftenseemed as if she were whispering with some invisible guest. Family mem-bers spied on her through a crack in the wall, but they never saw anyone.Some time passed, and Liu Xiang eventually returned home. Upon en-tering his house he was amazed to discover that it was filled with gold1"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"coins and richly worked silks. When he asked his wife how she came topossess all of these treasures, she replied, “For several months a youngman has come every night after the midnight watch has sounded. He callshimself Sir Wulang. He shares my bed and has given me everything yousee. I dare not hide this from you.” Liu was outraged at his wife’sinfidelity, but he had endured poverty for so long that, finally seeing somerelief at hand, he could not bring himself to rebuke her. Subsequentlythe stranger appeared before Liu in broad daylight, admonishing himnever again to spend the night with his wife. Frightened, Liu heeded thiswarning and moved to another lodging.Awed by the riches the strange spirit had brought to his wife, Liu him-self cast a bronze image of Wulang and paid homage to it morning andnight. Soon the spirit procured a new wife for Liu. Not having any sons,Liu prayed to Wulang for assistance. Wulang thereupon kidnapped theninth son of Marshal Xi, the local governor, and presented the child toLiu so that he could continue his family line. The governor offered a lav-ish reward for the return of his missing child. A woman in Liu’s neigh-borhood happened to catch sight of an infant dressed in fine silk swad-dling in Liu’s house. Suspecting that the child could not have been raisedin the household of a poor shopkeeper, she ran to the constables to makea report and collect the reward. Liu and Zheng were arrested, and all oftheir goods were confiscated.Incensed, the Wulang spirit summoned a host of demons and specterswho threw open the gates of the prison, releasing Liu and his wife andat the same time allowing all the other prisoners to escape. Enraged inturn, the governor had Liu and his wife seized the next day and orderedthat they be beaten mercilessly. That same night the spirit once again freedthe couple and then set fire to the governor’s compound, which burnedto the ground. Bricks and tiles streamed down like rain, preventing any-one from drawing near enough to extinguish the blaze. Conceding de-feat, Marshal Xi consented to allow worship of the spirit to continueand foreswore any further prosecution of Liu and Zheng. Sir Wulang inthe end kept possession of Zheng.1Wulang, more commonly known by the name Wutong, was a famil-iar figure in the religious culture of Hong Mai’s day. The diabolical spiritappears in no fewer than two dozen stories in the surviving portions ofTales of the Listener.Custodians of public order, like Marshal Xi in theanecdote recounted here, were aghast at the tenacity of popular devo-tion to such phantom spirits who flagrantly violated the cherished val-ues of fidelity, chastity, and deference to imperial officers. Though Hong2Introduction"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Mai himself was deeply versed in classical learning, his tale, which con-cludes with the triumph of the wanton spirit over the forces of order,contradicted the fundamental Confucian tenet that righteousness in-evitably prevails over evil. Many Confucians scoffed at the kind of su-pernatural accounts recorded by Hong, dismissing them as wild con-fabulations of credulous bumpkins, but the imperial state kept vigilantwatch on those who would exploit “sinister doctrines” (zuodao)to en-thrall its subjects.2Zuodao—the “sinister way,” as opposed to the “correct way” (zheng-dao)necessary to the governing of a well-ordered society—had commonlybeen used to describe the heretical teachings of sorcerers and conjurerssince the beginning of the imperial era. The “Regulations of the King”chapter of the Canon of Ritual,composed during the Han dynasty (202b.c.e.–220 c.e.), deemed recourse to “sinister doctrines” a heinouscrime:Those who use clever speech to violate the law, subvert or circumscribe the statutes by exceeding their proper duties, or resort to sinister doctrinesin order to disrupt imperial governance, shall be put to death. Those whocreate lewd music, strange costumes, and mysterious devices or perform out-landish stunts in order to delude the masses shall be put to death. Thosewho persevere in evil conduct, engage in specious sophistry, spread falselearning, or hide their evildoing behind a beguiling countenance in order to delude the masses shall be put to death. Those who falsely claim to con-jure ghosts and spirits, predict lucky or ill-omened days, or practice divina-tion in order to delude the masses shall be put to death. No appeals shall be allowed for these four capital crimes.3The word zuodaoappears in the first of the four crimes enumerated inthis passage, which seems to refer strictly to political machinations,specifically the self-serving cant of unscrupulous officials seeking to de-ceive the emperor. In contrast, the other three sets of criminal acts allconcerned various kinds of sorcery, soothsaying, and mantic arts intended“to delude the masses.” Over time,zuodaotoo came to be associated withsorcery and malediction. In the first century b.c.e., the language used inthis passage, “resort to sinister doctrines,” was on several occasions citedin indictments that charged ministers of state with the broadly insidiouscrime of impiety (budao).4In other cases zuodaoreferred to the extrav-agant claims of soothsayers and fortune-tellers seeking to curry favor withthe emperor.5Especially noteworthy was the allegation of “resort to sin-ister doctrines” in memorials seeking the death sentence for palace womenaccused of engaging in witchcraft—more precisely, “spells and curses”Introduction3"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"(zhouzu)—to harm or kill the emperor or other members of the impe-rial family.6In 18 b.c.e., when Xu Mi, sister of the disowned consort ofEmperor Cheng, was condemned to death for using witchcraft againstthe emperor’s new favorite, she was specifically charged with “resortingto sinister doctrines.”7By the end of the Han zuodaohad become synony-mous with sorcery.8In 224, Emperor Wen of Wei, successor to the Han,decreed that those accused of sorcery and offering improper sacrifices tospirits should be tried on the basis of the statute against “resort to sinis-ter doctrines.”9In subsequent legal codes “resort to sinister doctrines”was invariably linked to witchcraft and sorcery.10In Hong Mai’s day, local magistrates continued to invoke the statuteoutlawing “resort to sinister doctrines” to prosecute sorcery and illicitforms of worship.11A century earlier, in 1023, a prefect by the name ofXia Song serving in Hong Mai’s native province of Jiangxi called thecourt’s attention to the prevalence of self-anointed “spirit-masters” es-pousing “sinister doctrines” in his jurisdiction and throughout southChina.12These charlatan thaumaturges, Xia reported, smugly claimedto be able to conjure spirits and heal the sick, yet they forbade familymembers from giving food or medicine to, or even remaining in the housewith, sick persons. Instead, the spirit-masters set up altars on which theyplaced graven or painted images of “goblins and fairies”(chimei)—asXia called them—and tried to exorcise the demons afflicting the ill bymeans of charms and talismans. Most abominable of all in Xia’s eyes,local people often entrusted newborn infants to these sorcerers, whoraised their wards as acolytes, training them in diabolical arts with theexpectation that the youths would eventually succeed them. Xia claimedto have arrested and defrocked more than nineteen hundred such sor-cerers within his jurisdiction, and he called upon the imperial govern-ment to enforce the strict laws against “sinister doctrines,” “spells andcurses,” and “wanton practice of heretical rites.” Hong Mai’s accountof the Wulang spirit shows that, despite such periodic persecutions, civilofficials failed to shake popular faith in the abiding presence of ghostsand demons in the people’s lives.13Although historians of Chinese religion have devoted considerable at-tention to the origin and development of cults centered on individualgods, less attention has been paid to the demonic aspect of the super-natural realm.14No single figure in Chinese religious culture embodiedevil like the Satan of Christian religion, nor did the Chinese imagine adivine world starkly divided between forces of good and evil. Misfor-tune could be attributed to the inexorable workings of an inscrutable4Introduction"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"destiny, but it was most commonly blamed on a host of demonic enti-ties. Almanacs from the third century b.c.e.detail inauspicious days forparticular activities (because of the presence or activity of malicious spir-its), taboos (often based on the fear of offending spirits), sources of ill-ness (including disgruntled ancestors as well as demonic attack), and thecauses of dozens of forms of affliction (ranging from spirits inhering inanimal forms and inanimate objects to natural phenomena).15Later an-ecdotes and folklore suggest that beings best described as specters,fairies, and goblins populated the most intimate sphere of the supernat-ural and had the greatest impact on the daily lives of ordinary people.Yet historical documentation for such figures is scant. Most unsavory godsand demonic spirits lacked shrines, or their shrines were excluded fromofficial records, and their cults were typically described in a highly stereo-typical fashion that sheds little light on actual beliefs and worship.16Thisstudy seeks to repair this omission in the study of Chinese religion byexamining the remarkable history of the cult of Wutong within the largercontext of China’s evolving religious culture.Chinese religion, past and present, has functioned above all as a meansof invoking supernatural powers to gain some measure of control overone’s mortal existence. It has also provided moral injunctions; explana-tions for sin, suffering, and the disposition of the dead; symbols andmetaphors for structuring social order and temporal authority; and spir-itual, ritual, and physical disciplines for the attainment of immortality.But Chinese religion never produced a conception of the divine that stoodapart from the cosmos, and the mundane world human beings inhabitedwas not governed by laws fashioned by a transcendent creator god. Thusthe divine and the mundane remained organically connected, each sub-ject to powers of change and transformation inherent in the physical uni-verse. These “powers” were often represented as gods, although Chinesecivilization also produced philosophic traditions that conceived of thecosmos as spontaneously self-generating, a product of insuperable mys-tical processes unbeholden to any god or divine will external to itself. Inboth the grand organized religious traditions like Daoism and Buddhismand the multitude of local religious traditions without church or scrip-ture, the sacred was wedded to the ability to wield divine power in pur-suit of human aspirations. Powers of miraculous intervention (ling)demonstrated the efficacy of the gods, the sacrifices employed to propi-tiate them, and the intercessors who mediated between the mundane andthe divine.Chinese religious culture not only admitted a vast number of gods butIntroduction5"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"also acknowledged the involvement of lesser spirits, especially the ghostsof the dead, in human affairs. Indeed, the ghosts of the dead often loomedlarger in the popular religious imagination than the heavenly gods. Whileexalted deities remained distant and aloof from the mortal realm, thespirits of the dead, both one’s own ancestors and the anonymous legionsof wandering ghosts, were vivid presences in everyday life. In his classicstudy of religion in modern Taiwan, Arthur Wolf has drawn attention tothe marked correspondences between popular images of supernatural be-ings and the categories of social identity and interaction. The tripartitedivision of the spirits into gods, ancestors, and ghosts mirrored popularperceptions of the principal divisions of social life: officialdom, family,and the amorphous mass of “strangers” with whom one had no kinshipties.17This congruence between the supernatural world and lived socialexperience extended to relations of power and the reciprocal obligationsincumbent upon mortals and spirits. Though the exalted but remote godspossessed great power, they encroached only slightly on everyday socialexistence. The ancestors, in contrast, commanded constant attention inthe form of worship and sacrifice, and they closely supervised the moralconduct of their descendants. Yet the ancestors were no more powerfulin death than they had been in life. Ghosts, the spirits of unrelated dead,remained resolutely alien. Whether envisioned as hapless and beggarlysouls or predatory bandits, ghosts were shrouded with a fell aura of ma-lignancy that evoked fear and aversion.This map of the spiritual landscape thus provided the necessary guide-posts for safely navigating social life on both the mundane and super-natural levels. It is especially important to note that this conception ofthe divine was founded on principles of bureaucratic authority and hi-erarchy derived from the model of imperial government that prevailedin China for two millennia. The symbols, vocabulary, and rituals thatmediated political action were reprised, not simply as metaphors, but asthe actual instruments of intercourse between the divine and mundaneworlds.18Wolf’s model of Chinese religious culture as a reflection of social re-lations offers important insights into the operation of religious ideas andpractices and is especially helpful in understanding Chinese religion notsimply as an inventory of beliefs and rituals but as a product of socialand historical experience. Yet the functionalist logic of the model, andespecially its implication of rigid categorical distinctions among divinebeings corresponding to sharp differences in social status, fails to cap-ture the complex and fluid dynamics of the relationships between Chi-6Introduction"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"nese gods and their worshipers. As many scholars have noted, there arenumerous gods and spirits—and indeed whole categories of divine be-ings, for example the Buddhist pantheon, or female deities—that do notfit easily into Wolf’s tripartite model of the supernatural world.19Themost important qualification to the tripartite model is that the categoriesthemselves of god, ghost, and ancestor were unstable over time; manygods, especially local tutelary deities, originated as ghosts; ancestors, too,might be transformed into gods; and in some cases the images of the ances-tors scarcely differed from those of other ghosts. Finally, the tripartitemodel offers only limited insight into the nature of evil, and the prob-lems of theodicy posed by morally ambivalent gods like Wutong.While anthropologists have constructed models of Chinese religionbased on contemporary behavior (above all ritual practice), historianshave tended to categorize religion in terms of the dominant hieratic tra-ditions, the Three Teachings (Sanjiao) of Daoism, Buddhism, and Con-fucianism (or state religion). Each of these traditions can be identified interms of a distinct theology, a body of sacred writings, ritual practicesand precepts for the conduct of daily life, a cadre of learned men (and,in rare cases, women) who authorized the teachings and practices of thetradition, and enduring institutions that served to reproduce it. Recently,historians have begun to give ample consideration to “popular religion”as a fourth distinct religious tradition. Despite the secular ethos of Con-fucian education and socialization, the religious practices of the rulingelite of imperial China shared much in common with the “folk” religionof the peasantry.20Instead of distinguishing “popular religion” from asublime elite religion, historians of China have typically defined “popu-lar religion” as a body of beliefs and practices common to laypersons ofall social classes, in contradistinction to the religious world of scripturaltraditions and ecclesiastic authority. This notion of popular religion es-sentially reprises the binary structure postulated by C. K. Yang in his land-mark study of Chinese religion. Yang delineated two structural forms inChinese religion: 1) institutional religion (primarily understood as de-noting Buddhism and Daoism, but also including a wide range of prac-titioners of mantic arts and congregational groups), systems of theology,rituals, and organization independent of secular social institutions; and2) diffused religion, whose beliefs, practices, and organization were em-bedded in and inseparable from secular life.21Yang emphasized the rel-ative importance of the latter, which in his view derived from the classi-cal religion of ancient China, rather than the former in Chinese religiouslife. Yang also claimed that diffused religion was crucial to reinforcingIntroduction7"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"the social and economic cohesion of secular institutions (family, lineage,guild, village, fraternities and other associations) and in justifying thenormative political order of the imperial state.Although scholars today abjure the Weberian and Parsonian socio-logical precepts underpinning Yang’s analysis, his basic premise that thisdiffused religion constituted the principal form of Chinese religious lifehas gained broad acceptance. In a groundbreaking study Valerie Hansenhas sought to show how this diffused religion (what she refers to as “sec-ular” beliefs and rituals), rather than being vestiges of an archaic reli-gion, emerged out of the social and economic changes of the pivotal Songdynasty (960–1276).22Patricia Ebrey and Peter Gregory likewise havedescribed popular religion as “diffuse,” centered on family and commu-nity rather than congregational and ecclesiastic institutions. Like Hansen,Ebrey and Gregory insist that popular religion should not be opposedto “elite” practices, invoking once again Yang’s distinction between thediffused religion of laypersons of all social classes and the doctrinal andritual traditions of organized religion. In their view, popular religion com-prised a distinct tradition alongside the Three Teachings of Buddhism,Daoism, and Confucianism. Yet all four of these traditions evolvedthrough mutual interaction and influence. Following an analogy firstdrawn by Eric Zürcher, Ebrey and Gregory suggest that the popular tra-dition formed the bedrock of all Chinese religious practice.23This pop-ular religion proved remarkably pliant and amenable to the needs of itspractitioners, precisely because it was unencumbered by the doctrinal andtheological rigidities of organized religion. Because popular religionlacked canonical scriptures and an established priesthood, its heteroge-neous beliefs and values were reproduced and transmitted in the formsof symbol, myth, and ritual primarily through the agency of folklore,performance arts, and family culture.24Anthropologists have also underscored the distinction between thelay/secular/diffused religious practice of ordinary laypersons and the hi-eratic theology and liturgy of Buddhism and Daoism. Anthropologicalstudies of modern Chinese popular religion to a large degree have beendominated by the question of whether religious ideas and practices pro-moted unity or difference in society and cultural values.25C. K. Yang andMaurice Freedman, for example, maintain that the manifold variationsin Chinese religious practice were subsumed under an all-encompassingstructure that bound Chinese culture together.26James Watson, in con-trast, contends that the superficial uniformity of religious beliefs disguisedwide divergence in the meaning of these beliefs among discrete social8Introduction"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"groups; worship of a given deity ramified into distinctive social identi-ties fractured along lines of status, class, and gender.27Recent scholar-ship on religion in contemporary Taiwan has stressed the ways in whichreligion simultaneously creates both ideological coherence and social dif-ferentiation. Steven Sangren, for example, argues that a consistent sym-bolic logic pervades the “structures of value” in Chinese culture, but thecontingent histories of individual communities generate variations in in-stitutions and social behavior that mask this essential cultural continu-ity. Rather than seeing the divine world as a projection of social cate-gories in the style of Wolf and Yang, Sangren views religious symbols asmultivocal, subject to conflicting interpretation precisely because of theinherent tensions in social relations. Ultimately, though, ritual actionserves to reinforce the hegemonic social order. Sangren describes the re-lationship between social organization and its symbolic representationsas “recursive” and concludes that the particularizing tendencies of localcommunities become sublimated within a universal cosmo-political or-der.28A different sort of dialectic between orthodox sociopolitical normsand religious practice has been proposed by Robert Weller, who contraststhe shared body of basic cultural values with the variety of interpreta-tions and meanings drawn from that common fund. Weller distinguishesbetween the ideological constructs of formal religion (the state and ec-clesiastic authorities) on one hand and the “pragmatic interpretations”derived from them in the course of lived social experience on the other.Different groups utilize a range of styles of pragmatic interpretation, andthus the same sets of general values and ritual structures can engenderstarkly different meanings. He then illustrates how people in Taiwan inthe recent past have adapted hieratic ritual and scriptural “ideologies”to suit their own purposes.29Sangren’s emphasis on the recuperative function of ritual coincideswith the views of other anthropologists who assert the primacy of ritualaction over belief in Chinese religion, arguing that the standardizationof ritual substantiates and maintains a unified culture across Chinese so-ciety.30Weller, while acknowledging that shared social experiences fos-ter ideological as well as social unity, instead stresses the potential forsocial change to undermine the unity of interpretation and values: “See-ing beliefs as mechanical correlates of class or society hides the flexibil-ity of interpretation in light of ongoing historical experience. People use,manipulate, and create culture (including religion) as part of everydaylife within a system of social relations.”31The formulations proposed bySangren and Weller certainly improve upon Yang’s institutionalized/Introduction9"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"diffused dichotomy. Both recognize the importance of “history” (livedsocial experience) in forming religious values and practices; they avoidthe pitfalls of marking a stark disjuncture between great and little tra-ditions, whether conceived in sociological (elite/commoner) or religious(lay/clerical) terms; and they recognize that Buddhism, Daoism, state re-ligion, and popular religion are all part of a single cultural system.Although anthropologists generally have endorsed Yang’s basic dis-tinction between institutional and diffused religion, in one major respectthey have turned it on its head. Yang believed that diffused religion, be-cause it pervaded—and thus was dependent upon—secular institutions,lacked the autonomy to challenge social convention and hierarchy. Atthe same time, the alienation of the Buddhist and Daoist clergy (to saynothing of covert religious sects) from the rest of the social body placedthem in a position to become a dissenting force.32Sangren concurs thatthe ritual process acts to disguise or mystify the ways in which the pre-vailing “structure of values” legitimates and reproduces existing socialinstitutions. But Weller disputes the notion that popular religion in-evitably reinforces the prevailing structures of power and dominance thatundergird the status quo and suggests that it has greater potential forgenerating alternative ideologies than the already ideologized traditionsof clerical religion.33Emily Martin Ahern has gone even farther, argu-ing that religious ritual, far from mystifying the true nature of authorityor concealing it from the ruled, instead provides the lower classes withthe means to access divine power and to manipulate it for their ownpurposes.34The heterogeneity of both “ideologies” and “interpretations” (in Wel-ler’s sense of the words) tends to affirm the view that Chinese religion isnot a system of beliefs, but rather a set of purposeful actions (ritual inthe broadest sense) undertaken to effect some transformation upon theworld and the place of the individual in it. This conception of Chinesereligion has gained broad acceptance among anthropologists, and evensome historians of religion. James Watson explains the apparent unifor-mity of funerary rites across China as a consequence of the essentiallyperformative nature of the ritual process: cultural identity inhered in rit-ual “orthopraxy” (correct performance of ritual), not beliefs and values.This ritual orthopraxy thus acted as a powerful force for cultural ho-mogenization.35Jordan Paper concludes that Chinese religion, foundedon a core of ritual action (in his view, the communal meal shared withthe spirits), has been singular and relatively homogeneous since ancienttimes.36In a similar vein, Sangren asserts that it is not a deity or shrine10Introduction"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"but rather communal ritual that constitutes a cult in Chinese religion.37In contrast to the anthropologists who emphasize ritual action, histori-ans have focused their attention on belief, and especially on the cults ofprominent deities.38My own approach to the study of Chinese religion is deeply indebtedto these models but also diverges from them in important ways. On onehand, I emphatically stress the diversity of Chinese religious culture. Theapparent uniformity of myth, symbol, and ritual in Chinese religion con-ceals wide variations in “pragmatic interpretations,” to use Weller’s term,that inform social ideology and action. In an important sense, in Chinaall religion is local. Only by examining the histories of local communi-ties can we truly appreciate the dialectical relationship between religionand society. (Here I diverge from Sangren’s sense of “history” as a processof authenticating cultural norms and social categories and allow greaterscope for “history” as an open-ended process whereby social order andvalues are reinterpreted and reconstructed.) Nor do I find satisfying defini-tions of Chinese religion grounded in notions of ritual practice to the ex-clusion of belief and values. Ritual forms no less than “ideologies” wereflexible practices subject to pragmatic interpretation and adaptation. Asinstruments of power, rituals could be deployed in manifold ways.On the other hand, I believe we can define the religious culture of Chinain terms of certain basic orientations regarding the role of divine powerand human agency in shaping the course of human life. I take exceptionto Yang’s dichotomy of institutionalized and diffused religion, and to thesharp distinctions drawn between hieratic and lay religion in recent stud-ies. Nor do I find it helpful to define Chinese religion in terms of distincttraditions such as Buddhism, Daoism, and popular religion. As Weller’sconcept of pragmatic interpretation suggests, Buddhist or Daoist beliefsand rituals could be utilized in more or less ideological forms to achieveends quite different from those canonically authorized. Similarly, the dis-tinction between hieratic/institutionalized religion defined by “canoni-cal scriptures” and “professional clergies,” and lay/secular religion thatlacked either, is overdrawn. We cannot separate out a body of popularor secular religious values and practices from the larger social and insti-tutional matrix in which those values and practices appear. Althoughthere is a certain utility to the notion of “secular religion” as ValerieHansen defines the concept—religious practices unmediated by clergy—I think Hansen underestimates the importance of scripture and clergy inthe formation of this “secular” religious culture. In addition, I stronglydisagree with Yang’s contention that this secular religion (or “diffusedIntroduction11"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"religion,” to use Yang’s own term) was so deeply embedded in the insti-tutions of secular society that it inevitably served to reinforce existingsocial identities and relationships.Consequently, I have chosen to avoid some of the misleading conno-tations of “secular” by describing the common religious culture of Chinaas its “vernacular” religion. “Vernacular” suggests a demotic idiom, butone that is rooted in local and regional history. Vernacular language ofcourse is closer to common speech than classical language, yet the ver-nacular language is as much a literary as an oral tradition. Contrastingvernacular language or religion with classical language or religion runsthe risk of merely replicating Yang’s dichotomy between diffused and in-stitutionalized religion. Instead, we must recognize that Buddhism, Dao-ism, and state religion were all integrally related to vernacular religion.Hence, in this study vernacular religion denotes local and common dis-course, expressed in belief and ritual, for interpreting and expressingideas that derive from complex and shifting sets of religious ideologiesand practices. While vernacular religion shared certain salient orienta-tions that make it possible for us to speak of a common Chinese reli-gious culture, the meaning of vernacular religion diverged across spaceand time. It is in the instantiation of this religious culture in manifoldforms in history, rather than in an overarching, hegemonic “structure,”that we will find its meaning and significance. The striking mutationsof the Wutong cult over its thousand-year history epitomize the work-ings of vernacular religion.My formulation of “vernacular religion” as a local and demotic idiomin some respects corresponds to the distinction between “vernacular” and“classical” delineated by Kristof Schipper in his studies on Daoist litur-gical traditions.39Schipper portrays the vernacular ritual tradition as ex-clusively local, pared down in form and substance from the classical tra-dition of ordained priests while at the same time saturated with localmyths, orally transmitted ritual traditions, and ecstatic performances. Herejects the reductionist opposition of diffused versus institutionalized re-ligion, contending that Daoism always remained vitally integrated intolocal religious cultures. Masters of classical ritual borrowed from ver-nacular rites, and the two traditions often converged in ritual practice atthe community level. Yet Schipper still gives priority to the classical tra-dition, which he describes as “a literate, refined, elegant, and sophisti-cated expression of Chinese religion,” the “superstructure” that impartsunity and coherence to “more ordinary local cults.”40In historical terms,Schipper sees the Tang-Song transitional era (the eighth to twelfth cen-12Introduction"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"turies), when the Daoist ritual repertoire became deeply ingrained in lo-cal cults, as the formative era of vernacular Daoism. While I agree thatthe Tang-Song transition witnessed an unprecedented vernacularizationof ritual, it was also characterized, as Hansen has shown, by the spreadof secular (again, in Hansen’s sense of unmediated by religious special-ists) techniques of ritual action. For Schipper, ritual always requires hi-eratic mediation, and thus he overlooks the equally important contribu-tions of ordinary believers and their cults to the creation of vernacularreligion. Proper understanding of vernacular religion must also give con-sideration to the distinct social contexts (individual, familial, and com-munal) in which it operates.It is my contention that Chinese religious culture throughout its his-tory has manifested two fundamental orientations: 1) eudaemonisticregimes of propitiation and exorcism that regulated relationships betweenthe human and spirit worlds; and 2) an abiding belief in a moral equi-librium inhering in the cosmos itself (though frequently mediated throughthe agency of divine powers).41Both of these orientations can be tracedback to the earliest literate civilizations of the Bronze Age: the former iswell attested in the court religion of the Shang dynasty (ca. 1700–1045b.c.e.), and the latter was central to the cult of Heaven developed un-der the succeeding Zhou dynasty (1045–256 b.c.e.). Both orientationswere incorporated into the later hieratic traditions of the Three Teach-ings. However, there was an irreducible tension between the two. WhileChinese (in the imperial era, at least) did not adhere to one orientationto the exclusion of the other, the two could not be embraced equally.Mu-chou Poo observes that the most enduring substrate of religiousmentality in ancient China (the Shang-Zhou era) was fundamentally con-cerned with securing one’s personal welfare through acquisition of man-tic knowledge and powers.42In Poo’s view, the religion of the commonpeople primarily consisted of transactions with the divine mediated bydivination and sacrifice lacking any moral component. Misery and mis-chance, the perennial afflictions of human existence, were attributed tothe actions of supernatural beings. Yet suffering was caused not only byevil spirits, but also by intemperate ancestors, unfortunate ghosts, andvengeful gods. Poo thus concludes that “in everyday religious attitudesthere was little difference between gods, ghosts, and spirits.”43Althoughthe idea that supernatural beings judge the worthiness of sacrificeschiefly according to the moral character of the supplicant attained somecurrency among intellectuals like Confucius, the most “potent” (ling)super-natural beings—in terms of their effect on human lives—often wereIntroduction13"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"demons. The mantic regimens and exorcistic therapies devised to fendoff their afflictions rarely obtained any moral dimension. From the begin-ning of the imperial era, the calendar of religious ritual and festival wasconstructed above all around the necessity of purging baleful spirits andappeasing capricious ancestors at regular intervals.The introduction of a moral ethos into the vernacular religious culture(as opposed to court religion) accompanied the spread of “correlative cos-mology,” a worldview grounded in belief in the organic nature of a cosmosin which the individual, society, and the natural world were subject to ho-mologous cycles of change and mutation (see chapter 1). This worldviewemphasized the harmonious equilibrium and coherence that underlay allphenomena and forces, seen and unseen, at work in the world. From thefourth century b.c.e., virtually every facet of knowledge—philosophy,government, religion, medicine, natural science, and military strategy—and the application of each to human life was deeply colored by the pre-cepts of correlative cosmology. On the level of the individual, correla-tive cosmology produced mantic practices to halt the entropic decay ofthe body and human life through regimens of personal discipline (phys-ical and moral) and gnosis. In the social and political realm, the tax-onomies of correlative cosmology enabled the ruler to adapt humanbehavior—especially as manifested in ritual and institutions—to patternsof cosmic structure and change. Although initially devoid of moral ethos,correlative cosmology was infused with ethical significance over thecourse of the Han dynasty, and this notion of moral equilibrium was sub-sequently strengthened and elaborated by Daoist and Buddhist doctrines.Robert Campany has referred to this belief in a moral equilibrium gov-erning relations between the human and divine/cosmic worlds as the“doctrine of Heaven and Humanity” (tianren shuo).44Correlative cosmology, and the “doctrine of Heaven and Humanity”that issued from it, was based on a fundamental belief in the “resonance”(ganying)that mediated between different orders of reality. In correla-tive cosmology, events in the human world stimulate (gan)responses(ying)in the cosmos. Similarly, human actions (all human actions, moraland ritual, not just those of rulers and priests) evoke responses from thedivine world and the gods and spirits that inhabit it. Human misdeedswould provoke signs of divine opprobrium (omens and portents) and in-vite punishment (personal or general calamity). As Campany observes,the “doctrine of Heaven and Humanity” asserts that “morality andpiety—no matter of what kind—are unfailingly rewarded; immorality14Introduction"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"and impiety are unfailingly punished.”45The specifically moral charac-ter of this resonance between the human and the divine orders becomesespecially clear in the concept of “retribution” (baoying,a word that ini-tially referred specifically to portents, and was later employed to trans-late the Buddhist concept of karma), which becomes fundamental to re-ligious discourse from the Han dynasty onward.Yet ganyingdid not necessarily imply a moral order. The idea that thespirits respond in predictable ways to ritual propitiation long antedatedthe emergence of correlative cosmology. The power possessed by godsand spirits to intervene in mundane affairs (ling)was amenable to hu-man manipulation through sacrifice and mantic arts. Thus, gods were es-teemed in proportion to their responsiveness to human entreaties, a qual-ity referred to as “potency of resonance” (linggan). This potency cannotbe understood simply in terms of belief in the efficacy of the powers ofa given god or spirit, however. As Sangren emphasizes, the ling,or mirac-ulous power, of any entity is “defined or constrained by both general cul-tural logic and by a historically unfolding logic of social relations in par-ticular contexts.”46The manifestations of divine power (lingyan)in theforms of the miracles a god performs or boons a god grants not onlytestified to the god’s ability to affect human destiny, but also defined andauthenticated social relations among its worshipers. As social relationschanged, so did the power wielded by the gods. The bond between a godand its worshipers was based not on a moral covenant, but rather on thetransactions between them: a circular exchange of sacrifice and devotionon one hand and protection and aid on the other. Indeed, many gods ap-peared to be morally ambivalent or even demonic in nature, prone to re-sort to violence as much as moral power.The history of Chinese religious culture presented in this study pro-ceeds from analysis of these fundamental orientations of eudaemonisticentreaty and moral equilibrium since antiquity, and treats the develop-ment of the distinctive religious traditions of state religion, Daoism, andBuddhism as derivations of these basic orientations. I propose that therewere two major moments in the transformation of Chinese religion dur-ing the imperial era. First, in the Han dynasty, new ideas about deathand the afterlife emerged that coalesced in a much-changed cult of thedead that in turn became the touchstone for the formation of salvific re-ligions, both the indigenous tradition of Daoism and the imported Bud-dhist religion (see chapter 2). Second, in the Song dynasty, the religiousculture was transformed by a vernacularization of ritual practice andIntroduction15"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"mantic arts that rendered the divine more accessible to ordinary humanbeings (see chapter 5). This vernacularization of ritual established theframework of modern Chinese religion.Demons and demonic forces were cardinal features of both of the ba-sic orientations that I have identified. In the final chapters of this bookI turn to a case study of the cult of the god Wutong, which cogently sym-bolizes the interpenetration of the divine and the demonic in Chinese re-ligious culture. The Wutong cult represents an instance of the near totaleclipse of the moral equilibrium orientation by the eudaemonistic ori-entation, and in this respect it diverges markedly from the apparent trendtoward a greater integration of the two. The successive transformationsof the Wutong cult, from its origins in the tenth century down to the twen-tieth century, reflected the continuous evolution of vernacular concep-tions of both the divine world and the human social order. Throughoutthis period the state, ecclesiastic authorities, devout laity, and secular crit-ics each sought to recast the deity in a form that suited their own moraland religious sensibilities. Although their efforts failed to eradicate thedemonic aspect of Wutong, they did influence vernacular perceptions ofthe deity.In archaic Greece, the word daimondescribed not a category of gods,but rather “an occult power, a force that drives man forward when noagent can be named.” The mood and temperament of the individual per-son were determined by the indwelling presence of either the “happy de-mon” (eudaimon)or the “unhappy demon” (kakodaimon). Daimonalsoreferred to the spirits of dead heroes who became guardians over mor-tals, and “imaginary apparitions” that drove people to desperate acts.47In the late Greco-Roman period, daimon(like the Latin genius) com-monly referred to lesser spirits and demigods, especially patron orguardian spirits joined to a person at birth that would protect the home-stead and family. Only with Plato’s disciple Xenocrates was the wordsystematically applied to evil spirits filled with lust for blood and sex.48In Chinese religious culture, as in archaic Greece, it would be more ap-propriate to think of the “demonic” as a propensity of gods, spirits, andhumans toward hostility and malevolence, rather than a specific categoryof divine beings. Certain spirits, such as the mountain goblins discussedin chapter 3, were inveterately demonic. Others, like the plague demonsdiscussed in chapter 4, could be construed as demonic in character butwere also conceived as emissaries of the august gods who exacted justpunishment on sinful mortals. The god Wutong shared some traits withthese demonic spirits, but Wutong was also recognized as a deity who16Introduction"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"manifested potent responsiveness (linggan)in his relations with mortalvotaries.In his earliest forms Wutong appeared in a variety of guises, both goodand evil, sometimes as a healer of the sick, at other times as a noxiousdemon. During the Southern Song period (twelfth to thirteenth centuries)Wutong was inducted into the pantheon of imperially sanctioned cultsand achieved a similar apotheosis in the liturgical traditions of the newlyascendant Daoist Thunder Magic movements. In the late Ming dynasty(sixteenth to seventeenth centuries) Wutong emerged as the dominant cultfigure in Jiangnan, the economic and cultural heartland of China, in theform of a god who governs the dispensation of wealth. The most remark-able feature of Wutong’s incarnation as a god of wealth was the deity’sdiabolical character. Wutong was perceived neither as a culture hero noras a reification of noble human qualities, but rather as an embodimentof humanity’s basest vices, greed and lust, an actively maleficent demonthat preyed on the weak and vulnerable. As such, Wutong was very muchthe antithesis of the modern gods of wealth.The history of the Wutong cult and the development of Wutong intoa god of wealth provide a unique perspective on popular conceptions ofthe nexus between money and social relations. Many observers have com-mented on the absence in Chinese culture of religious sanctions againstacquisitiveness such as those imposed by the medieval Christian church.49Although Chinese religion did not condemn the acquisition of wealth asa motive for invoking the aid of the gods, the popular image of Wutongas a demonic figure reveals a keen awareness of the subversive and po-tentially dangerous consequences of avarice. Not surprisingly, the cultwas often subjected to proscription and repression—sporadically in themid-Ming, and systematically from the late seventeenth century onwards.Ultimately, although the Wutong cult lingered on into the twentieth cen-tury, Wutong’s preeminence as the god of wealth was eclipsed by newcult figures that personified positive, “bourgeois” virtues of hard work,modesty, thrift, and moral integrity. Yet the demise of Wutong did nottestify to the dominion exercised by the state over popular belief. Instead,the symbolic construction of the modern cult of the god of wealth be-ginning in the eighteenth century reflected changes in the society, econ-omy, and culture of Jiangnan as profound as those that elevated Wutongto the pinnacle of the popular pantheon two centuries before.Since this book proposes to study collective popular mentality throughthe literary record of the dominant patrician (shidafu)class, a brief noteof explanation about methodology is in order. The variety of sources usedIntroduction17"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"here is extremely broad, ranging from Daoist scriptures, religious primers,temple inscriptions, and vernacular fiction to government documents,official memoirs, and local gazetteers. The most important source for theWutong cult, though, is the vast repertory of anecdotes accumulated overits long history, like the Wulang tale with which this book began. Theseanecdotes were, of course, written down by men of exalted social classwhose book learning distanced them from the mental universe of the cult’snonliterate devotees. To those who insist upon the fundamental auton-omy of plebeian culture and belief, reliance upon written anecdote posessubstantial risks of misinterpretation or calculated distortion.50Yet theutility of studying the mentality of nonliterate classes through an analy-sis of books they never read has been amply demonstrated by MikhailBakhtin’s classic work on humor and folk belief in the novels of Ra-belais.51Close attention to the symbols and metaphors found in anec-dotes can reveal the structure of the ideas behind them and how this struc-ture evolves. Indeed, to the extent it preserves the language of concreteexperience, the anecdote offers valuable insight into plebeian mentality:“Repetitive stories of this kind are close in form to that of peasant com-munication, a form which may exist in most communities with ‘face-to-face’ relationships. This form involves concrete language of symbolic con-tent, which constantly reiterates central aspects of social relationships.Its repetitiveness and its seeming triviality is a pointer to what in fact wewant to investigate.”52The essential congruity of Wutong stories and an-ecdotes from diverse hands suggests that the written versions preservemuch of the oral narrative.A greater danger perhaps lies in assumptions concerning the essen-tially classless character of collective mentality and the tendency to ab-stract “values” out of their social context. Superficial similarities betweenthe ideology of the dominant patrician class and representations of pop-ular mentality in the written record have been read as evidence of a“growing integration” of Chinese culture and “closer congruence” of eliteand peasant values in the late imperial period.53The present study chal-lenges this view. While recognizing reciprocal influences between the cul-tures of dominant and subordinate classes, it distinguishes between theculture imposed on the plebeian classes and the vernacular culture thatthey themselves produce. Only by recognizing this distinction can we be-gin to hear the authentic popular voices so often elided from patriciandiscourse about Chinese religious culture.18Introduction"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"chapter 1Ancestors, Ghosts, and Gods in Ancient ChinaAlthough only dimly perceived before the advent of modern archaeol-ogy, the Shang kingdom, which ruled over the North China Plain in thelate second millennium b.c.e.(ca. 1700–ca. 1045 b.c.e.), is now recog-nized as the progenitor of many basic features of Chinese religious culture.The eudaemonistic beliefs and practices that became the foundation forlater Chinese vernacular religion were already present in the court reli-gion of the Shang. The subsequent Zhou dynasty (ca. 1045–256 b.c.e.)incorporated many of these practices into its own ritual culture, but theZhou also departed from the Shang in formulating the earliest versionof the moral equilibrium orientation, the cult of Heaven. Wolf’s tripar-tite division of the supernatural realm into gods, ancestors, and ghostscan also be observed in ancient times, but the status and significance ofthese categories of divine beings differed greatly from their modern coun-terparts. Indeed, in terms of historical evolution, it would be more properto invert (as the title of this chapter does) Wolf’s ordering of “gods, ghosts,and ancestors” to trace the successive emergence of “ancestors, ghosts,and gods” as epitomes of supernatural power.The Shang kingdom was a dynastic state encompassing an extensivenetwork of noble domains under the dominion of a paramount king. Eachdomain was centered on a walled town, the seat of its ruling lineage. Theroyal clan consisted of ten lineages that alternated succession to king-ship. Periodic fission of the royal lineages and award of domains to jun-ior branches impelled aggressive expansion of the Shang realm through19"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"war and conquest. The royal and noble lineages who ruled over this politywere above all warriors and sacrificers; conquest and ritual symbioticallynourished each other and swelled the might of the kingdom.The bonds of royal kinship formed the sinews of military and politi-cal power. Ultimately, though, Shang kings derived their authority frompowers they could command through the mediation of their deified an-cestors. The Shang kings, and indeed the entire noble class, communi-cated with their deceased ancestors by means of divination. Records ofroyal divinations were inscribed on the animal bones (cattle scapulae andtortoise plastrons) used to perform the divination. After a king died thearchive of inscribed oracle bones accumulated during his lifetime wassometimes interred in the tomb of the deceased or in nearby pits, thuspreserved until they were once again brought into the world of light byarchaeological excavations. Much of our knowledge about the activitiesof the Shang ruling class has been obtained from these oracle bones, theoldest literary remains in East Asia.1The Shang projected the social and political hierarchy of the mundaneworld beyond death and onto the world of the divine.2Shang rulers ad-dressed their deceased ancestors as deified spirits, imagining that deathonly augmented their majesty and power. The divine hierarchy, organ-ized along kinship lines, largely replicated the secular one: the ancestorgods were ranked according to the order of precedence of the royal lin-eage. Thus the Shang kings ruled by virtue of their charisma,in Weber’ssense of a special relationship to the divine that endows a mortal beingwith extraordinary powers.3The thaumaturgic powers the Shang kingscould exercise through divination and ancestral sacrifices enabled themto obtain bountiful harvests and victory in battle, which in turn enhancedtheir charismatic authority.The eclipse of brute force by charismatic authority undoubtedly con-tributed to the stability of the Shang kingdom. But the divine realm wasalso subject to the same strife among warring clans that beset the mor-tal world. The Shang kings did not enjoy exclusive access to divine power;rather, every noble lineage, including the enemies of Shang, could makesimilar claims based on their intimate relationships with their own ex-alted ancestors. The exact means by which the ancestor gods aided theirmortal descendants remains murky. Prevailing scholarly opinion holdsthat the Shang believed in a supreme deity known as Di, or Thearch, whowas the ultimate arbiter of human fate but stood aloof from ordinarymortals.4In contrast to the Yahweh of Abrahamic religions, Di did notimpose his moral will on humanity. Di was an impersonal god, indiffer-20Ancestors, Ghosts, and Gods"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"ent to mortal concerns and largely inaccessible to human supplicants. Liv-ing rulers sought to curry favor with Di through the intercession of theirdeified ancestors, who could communicate directly with the supreme god.A lineage enhanced the potency of its charisma by providing its ancestorswith the most munificent sacrifices, thereby magnifying their influence overDi. Shang religion, and indeed the whole Shang social order, revolvedaround this necromantic propitiation of the ancestor deities.Thus the Shang kings depended upon the mediation of their ancestorsto ensure their political supremacy. The intersecting logic of Shang reli-gion and political legitimation emphasized the mutual interdependenceof the living and the dead. Only by receiving rich and regular sacrificialofferings could the ancestors maintain their exalted place within the di-vine realm. Consequently, the political economy of the Shang state wasbased on tribute, in the form of sacrifices, offered to the ancestor godsin exchange for their aid in obtaining blessings from Di.5In addition totribute goods submitted to the Shang king by subordinate lords, royalhunts and processions also provided occasions for the king to mobilizethe produce of his realm in service to his ancestor cult.6Divine blessingsmore than repaid the copious expenditure of grain, wine, animal and hu-man sacrifices, and ritual objects, especially bronze vessels, consumed bythese ancestral rites. The sacrifices also mandated scrupulous attentionto the minute details of ritual. The refined bronze-making skills of Shangartisans were concentrated not on the manufacture of weapons or agri-cultural tools, but rather on the production of ritual vessels that servedas the tangible instruments of both sacred and secular power. Shangbronze art is noteworthy for its lack of iconographic representations ofgods and mortals. Instead, Shang ritual bronzes featured images of fan-tastic creatures, either spirits or priests wearing animal masks, who me-diated between the living members of the lineage and their deified kin.Chief among them was the enigmatic taotie,the most pervasive imagein Shang bronze art, a fantastic zoomorph distinguished by prominenteyes, fangs, and horns (figures 1, 2, and 3). In the minds of later Chi-nese, the striking taotiemotif of Shang bronzes conjured up demonic im-ages; indeed, the word taotie,first applied to this motif in the WarringStates period, meant “glutton” and was associated with a monstroustyrant of insatiable greed and lust.7Though the original meaning of thetaotieis greatly disputed, with many scholars denying that the taotiehasany iconic meaning at all, there can be little doubt that the fantastic crea-tures depicted in Shang ritual art metaphorically displayed the union ofdivine power and temporal authority.8Ancestors, Ghosts, and Gods21"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Figures 1–3.

Yet the oracles themselves show that the Shang livednot only in awe but also in fear of their deceased kin. Lapses in ritualpiety provoked severe punishment. Oracles concerning illnesses sufferedby the ruler typically inquired about which ancestors had been rousedto anger and how to placate them. Ironically, although distant, more sen-ior ancestors were generally portrayed as powerful and benevolent pa-trons, the oracles often identified the recent dead—who most likely hadpersonally known the living—as the sources of “curses.”The oracle bones also show that the Shang believed in numerous na-ture deities (the spirits of mountains, rivers, wind, fire, and rain, for ex-ample) associated with particular places. Akatsuka Kiyoshi has arguedthat these nature deities were totemic tutelary gods of ruling local line-ages (“tribes” in Akatsuka’s nomenclature) that the Shang, upon subju-gating these groups, incorporated into their own pantheon. Akatsuka de-picts the Shang polity as a theocratic tribal federation united by aperipatetic king who periodically progressed throughout the entire realm,performing sacrifices to local gods and thereby garnering a commonbounty of fruitful harvests and military triumphs. Although many aspectsof Akatsuka’s portrait of Shang government and religion, especially hisconceptions of tribe and totem, are subject to dispute, his overall visionof the sacred nature of kingship is a compelling one.9In the late Shangperiod, sacrifices to nature deities and the more remote Shang ancestorsdeclined markedly.10These intermediate divinities were apparently ef-faced by the late Shang kings’ assertion of their direct control over thedivine, including Di, an assertion that may have been based on claimsthat the Shang king himself was a living god.11The oracle bones of thelast Shang kings also indicate a shift away from heavy reliance on div-ination and toward systematized, routine administration of sacrifices,reflecting the increasing hubris of kings who no longer dwelled in dreadof their ancestors.Shang religion thus revealed no sharp distinctions between the divineand the mundane worlds, nor between the sacred and the profane. Nei-ther the supreme deity, Di, nor any of the lesser gods of Shang religionimposed any absolute moral standards beyond the ritual obligations bind-ing the living to the dead. The king, through correct performance of rit-ual acts, could manipulate these spirits and bend them to his will. Thecharismatic authority wielded by the king inhered not in the king as aheroic individual, however, but in the corporate group, the lineage, thatAncestors, Ghosts, and Gods23"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"the king represented. Similarly, Shang religion betrays little concern forthe fate of the individual (or “soul”) after death. The recent dead appearto have retained many of their personal attributes and temperament, butwith the passage of time and erasure of memory the ancestors were grad-ually reduced to the abstractions of rank and title. Depersonalization be-came congruent with authority: the distant ancestors exercised greaterpower than the recently deceased, and the supreme deity Di was shornof any personal qualities whatsoever. Therefore the mortuary ritual ofthe Shang eschewed veneration of exemplary, “heroic” individuals; in-stead it concentrated on securing the place of each individual in the eter-nal hierarchical order of the lineage. The grave goods interred with Shangnobility proclaimed the individual’s exalted status, but only in order toconfirm and augment the charisma of the lineage as a whole. Shang re-ligion thus allowed little scope for mythology, since it emphasized theprescribed ritual/kinship roles of the ancestors rather than the celebra-tion of their individual traits and life histories.12The divine realm remained a privileged world accessible only to theruling class. Shang gods never became gods of the masses, nor of the com-munity as a whole. The walled towns that served as political capitals werefirst and foremost cult centers, sites of the ancestral temples and tombsof royal and noble lineages, the cynosures of sacred as well as secularpower.13In contrast to cities of the early civilizations of west and southAsia, Shang cities conspicuously lacked monumental architecture glo-rifying the achievements of the living. Shang cities, reflecting their pri-mary function as ceremonial centers, were defined by walled enclosuresand the ancestral temple and tombs of the ruling lineage. Yet the tem-ples devoted to the ancestral cult were dwarfed by the tombs, whereinthe greater portion of royal treasure came to rest. The Shang capital wasindeed a necropolis, a city of the dead who provided the essential linkto divine power. The religious and ceremonial functions of Shang citiesthus reinforced rather than mitigated social stratification. Assimilationof local gods into the ancestral cult of the ruling lineage resulted in theexclusion of plebeian urban inhabitants, chiefly artisans and slaves, fromreligious life.The intimacy between rulers and their apotheosized ancestors also pre-cluded the rise of a priestly class that might contest the sovereign pre-rogatives of the ruling lineages. Priestly intercessors had an ancient pedi-gree dating back to well before the Shang kingdom. The human figureswith plumed headdresses conjoined to masklike animal faces that deco-rate the remarkable jade carvings from the Liangzhu neolithic culture24Ancestors, Ghosts, and Gods"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"(third millennium b.c.e.) of the lower Yangzi River valley display strik-ing parallels with the taotieand other zoomorphic motifs of Shang ritualart.14The Liangzhu jade tubes were undoubtedly used in hieratic ritual,and presumably the figures portrayed on them were priests or chieftainswho wielded sacerdotal powers. Although there is no evidence for a directfiliation between the Liangzhu jades and the high Shang culture more thana thousand years later, it seems plausible to infer that the Liangzhu cul-ture, like the Shang kingdom, was dominated by a ruling class claimingthe power to marshal divine forces through the mediation of supernat-ural creatures.15We have no way of knowing whether the priests of theLiangzhu culture exercised temporal power as well. But in Shang timesreligious and political authority were inseparable. Since the living king,or lineage chief, had the closest relationship to his deceased ancestors,the rulers of secular society retained primary responsibility for commu-nicating with the gods. Given the heavy quotidian schedule of divina-tions and sacrifices, the Shang rulers employed numerous specialists inmantic arts, including diviners and priests, to assist them.16Yet the kinghimself always occupied the position of chief priest, personally conductingdivinations and ancestral rites. In one of the most important Shang cere-monies, the “guest” (bin)ritual, the Shang king communed with his ances-tors in the divine world, or even with Di.17During the final decades ofthe Shang, the king’s retinue of diviners and priests was almost entirelysuperseded by the king himself, who acted as sole intermediary betweenthe mortal and divine realms.Shang religion enjoined the ruling class to punctilious performance ofprescribed rituals, but not to laws, or a code of ethics, that transcendedtemporal authority. Consequently, Shang religion evinces no sharp sep-aration between good and evil, or between the divine and the demonic.The taotieand other fearsome images found in Shang ritual art conveysome sense of the awe and mystery with which the Shang regarded thedivine, but ultimately the supernatural powers depicted in these imageswere subordinated to kingly authority. Through ritual practice groundedin the logic of lineage solidarity, the Shang rulers gained mastery of thegods and harnessed divine power in service to their earthly designs.Around 1045 b.c.e., an upstart rival lineage deposed the Shang andinaugurated its own Zhou dynasty.18The Zhou typically are depicted asrude barbarians emerging from beyond the pale of Shang civilization, animage that traces back to the Zhou’s own legends, which extol the aus-tere martial vigor of their ancestors in contrast to the effete decadenceof the Shang. But archaeological research has shown that the Zhou, atAncestors, Ghosts, and Gods25"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"least in the century or more before their conquest of the Shang, were partof the Shang ecumene and shared many cultural traits with the Shang.The most obvious continuity between Shang and Zhou is found in theassemblages of sacred bronze ritual vessels central to the royal cults ofeach dynasty. Despite similarities in manufacture and style, though, Zhoubronzes differed from those of the Shang in function. Unlike the Shang,who buried ritual bronzes with their owners, the Zhou preserved manybronze vessels in the world of light, passing them down to their descen-dants. Although Shang bronzes were rarely inscribed with more than thenames of their owners and the ancestors to whom they were dedicated,Zhou bronzes bear lengthy testaments intended for the edification of theancestors and future generations alike. In the minds of the Zhou rulers,it was the merit accrued by living descendants rather than the charismaticpower of dead ancestors that assured the perpetuation of the lineage andits patrimony of rank and property. Zhou bronze inscriptions consistedprimarily of announcements to the ancestor spirits proclaiming the mer-itorious accomplishments of the living kin, especially the honors and giftsthe latter received from the king.19Thus, Zhou bronzes bore witness tothe lineage’s pedigree and legacy of achievement; their presence in theancestral temple constantly reminded the living of the weighty chargethey inherited from their forebears. The changed meaning and use of rit-ual bronzes in the Zhou ancestral cult betokened a larger transforma-tion in political and religious culture.Zhou religion departed most significantly from Shang precedents inits new conception of the supreme deity, whom the Zhou simply namedTian or “Heaven.” In contrast to the distant and inscrutable Di, Tianwas perceived as an immanent god who manifestly intervened in humanaffairs. In addition, Tian subordinated the king and all of his subjects toa universal moral law, and imposed his will on humanity by selecting theruler of the mortal realm, the “world under heaven” (tianxia). If the rulerfailed to abide by Tian’s decrees (understood not as specific revelations,like the Shang oracles, but as a general set of moral principles), Tian wouldtransfer his blessings to a more worthy choice. “Heaven’s Mandate”(Tianming) sacralized royal authority, endowing the king with a moralsanction none could defy. The Zhou justified their overthrow of the Shangby insisting that their actions were ordained by Tian, who commandedthe Zhou to vanquish the evil Shang and succeed them as monarchs ofthe civilized world. The charter myth of the Zhou dynasty—encapsulatedin the Odesand Documents,the oldest works in the Chinese literaryheritage20—portrayed the Zhou as benevolent agents of a providential26Ancestors, Ghosts, and Gods"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"god. Tian, like Di, was an omnipotent but impersonal god, unbeholdento any particular race or lineage. Yet unlike Di, Tian discriminated be-tween righteous rule and mere tyranny. Zhou religion also renouncedShang belief in the charismatic power of the ancestor gods, supplantingthe indelible biological bond between the Shang king and his ancestorswith a metaphorical kinship between Tian and the earthly monarch. TheZhou king acknowledged his deference to the patriarchal authority ofTian by referring to himself as “Son of Heaven,” but his right to rule re-mained contingent on upholding Heaven’s Mandate.21Tian probably originated as a tutelary god of the Zhou people (or,more precisely, the ruling lineage of Zhou). The elevation of Tian to theposition of a universal, supreme deity may not have occurred until wellafter the Zhou had installed themselves as supreme rulers.22By elimi-nating the ancestors as intermediaries between the mortal ruler and thesupreme god, the Zhou made the king the sole avenue of access to di-vine power. Other noble lineages could share in divine blessings onlythrough subordination to the king. Although the Shang kings exaltedthemselves as paramount rulers over their world, their claims to univer-sal kingship were undermined by the diffusion of charismatic authorityamong a large number of lineages. The Zhou severed the divine, in theperson of Tian, from all human supplicants save the king himself. Unre-stricted interaction between gods and humans, such as the practice ofdivination fostered by Shang belief in the charisma of the ancestors, wasdeemed inimical to social and political order. Zhou mythology paid scantheed to the narration of theogony and the creation of the mundane worldand its mortal subjects, so central to the mythologies of early civiliza-tions in West Asia. Instead, Zhou myths focused on the means wherebya primeval world beset by chaotic commingling of gods, humans, andbeasts became civilized and humanized.23The ancient sage-kings lion-ized in Zhou legend and song contributed to the advance of human civ-ilization by inventing useful productive and social technologies (for ex-ample, farming, fire, laws, and ritual codes). The sage-kings tamed thenatural world, rendering it fit for human habitation; they instilled disci-pline and harmony in the human community by devising codes of socialconduct; and they brought order to the cosmos by establishing bound-aries that separated heaven from earth, human from beast, and civiliza-tion from barbarism.Although the Zhou kings reserved to themselves exclusive access tothe supreme deity Tian, at the same time they founded a political orderbased on delegation of sovereign powers among hundreds of vassals.Ancestors, Ghosts, and Gods27"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Through rituals of investiture (known as fengjian), the Zhou kings al-lotted benefices to both kinfolk and their allies against the Shang. Thecompacts with the vassals were sealed by bestowal of ritual regalia, in-cluding bronze vessels—the emblems of royal authority—bearing in-scriptions specifying the obligations and rights assigned to the recipi-ents of the king’s largesse. Later histories record that most benefices wereawarded to men bearing the royal surname, Ji. By subsuming most rul-ing lineages into the royal clan, the Zhou perhaps sought to obliteratethe ancestry of formerly independent noble lineages, yoking their for-tunes even more tightly to those of the royal house. The protocols ofinvestiture also included an important rite wherein the vassal receiveda clod of earth taken from the Soil Altar (She)of the royal capital, whichthen was placed at the Soil Altar of the vassal’s own capital. The tan-gible joining of king and vassal through the Soil Altars, whose role inZhou ritual life paralleled that of the ancestral temples, no doubt rein-forced the vassal’s awareness of the derivative nature of his own sov-ereign powers.24Despite the repudiation of Shang theology implicit in the Zhou cultof Tian, ancestral sacrifices still were central to Zhou religious life. As inShang times, the cities that served as the seats of noble lineages were pri-marily ceremonial centers. The very definition of a capital city was basedon the presence of a lord’s ancestral temple and the Soil Altar (which,because of its crucial place in rituals of investiture, became a synecdochefor sovereignty).25It was believed that the ancestors remained sentientspirits, residing “on high” in the company of Tian but also exercisinginfluence over the lives of their descendants. As in Shang times, the an-cestors were keenly concerned about the welfare of their living descen-dants and lent them supernatural support. Ancestral sacrifices took theform of communal feasts celebrated in the physical presence of the ances-tors, who descended into the body of an impersonator to partake of thefood offerings. The ritual songs preserved in the Odesand Zhou bronzeinscriptions reaffirm the idea that noble ancestors were powerful spiritswho could bring good fortune to their living kin, protecting them fromenemies and ensuring that they enjoyed long, ripe lives.26The ancestorscontinued to receive munificent sacrifices, and the main beneficiaries ofthis ritual exchange, as in Shang times, were the living descendants avidlyseeking the blessings of their exalted forebears. But the political mean-ing of the ancestral cult had changed. To the Zhou, nobility was commen-surate with moral excellence and virtuous government. Noble lineages28Ancestors, Ghosts, and Gods"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"could assure their continued prosperity only through steadfast emula-tion of their meritorious ancestors.Within a century following the conquest of Shang, the supreme mili-tary power of the Zhou kings waned significantly, and royal authoritywas challenged from both within and without the Zhou polity.27Inva-sions by hostile peoples to the south and west forced the Zhou to aban-don their homeland in the Wei River valley in 771 b.c.e.and reestab-lish their court in the heartland of the old Shang kingdom. The relocationof the Zhou capital near the modern city of Luoyang marked a crucialshift in dynastic fortunes. During the Eastern Zhou period (771–256b.c.e.), the attenuation of royal authority allowed the vassals to arro-gate to themselves sovereign powers formerly exercised by the Zhou kingalone. By the early seventh century b.c.e., the Zhou king had been re-duced to an otiose figurehead, easily manipulated by power mongersamong his nominally subordinate vassals. Though still acknowledgingthe Zhou king as supreme monarch in a ritual sense, the vassals—someof who became rulers of great states vastly larger than the royal domain—brooked no interference on the part of the king in the internal affairs oftheir territories. No ruler wielded sufficient authority to displace theZhou, however, and the Zhou ecumene became divided among warringcamps defined not by ritual protocols but rather by transitory militarysupremacy and shifting interstate alliances. Deference to lord and kingno longer sustained the hierarchical order enacted by the Zhou founders.Constant warfare throughout the so-called Spring and Autumn period(late eighth to fifth centuries b.c.e.) abetted the rise of a warrior culturein which military might outweighed ritual rank. Dissolution of the normsof fealty also strained relations between the rulers and native noble lin-eages of the now independent states. Many rulers discovered that theyhad freed themselves from subordination to the Zhou king only to be-come captive to the increasingly restless and ambitious warrior aristoc-racies of their own domains.The rise of the warrior aristocracy and the prevalence of warfareamong competing states subtly transformed the meaning of ancestralsacrifices and their relationship to political authority.28The ancestors con-tinued to be a powerful and vital presence in the lives of their descen-dants. Political authority once again was rooted in the ancestral cult, es-pecially through the presentation of “blood sacrifices” (xueshi)to theancestor spirits at the ancestral temple and the Soil Altar.29War itselfwas understood as a sacrificial rite that proved the mettle of the livingAncestors, Ghosts, and Gods29"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"descendants while winning glory for the ancestral lineage. War, hunting,and animal sacrifice became enshrined as a trinity of homologous litur-gies performed in service to the lineage; each was a form of “bloodsacrifice” entailing the taking of life to nourish the ancestor spirits.30Yetservice to the ancestral cult did not imply that the ancestors conferredsupernatural powers on their descendants, in the manner of the Shangancestor gods. In contrast to bronze inscriptions of the early Zhou, whichportrayed the ancestors as powerful spirits who blessed their descendantswith long life and good fortune, Spring and Autumn bronzes lauded themerits and dignity of the descendants, scarcely mentioning the ancestorsat all.31The ancestral cult of the Spring and Autumn period thus em-phasized the primacy of the living, whose glorious deeds ensured the pros-perity of future generations in the name of ancestors who symbolized theeternal legacy of the lineage as a whole.The impotence of the Zhou dynastic house called into question itslogic of legitimation, and the very notion of moral authority itself. Tian’sapparent countenance of manifest injustice and the demise of royalpower rocked the foundations of Zhou religion.32The warrior cultureof the Spring and Autumn period equated virtue and honor with mar-tial prowess, not moral pedigree or deference to ritual order. In the ab-sence of any presumption of allegiance to the Zhou or any other sanc-tioned authority, relationships between states were governed by oathsand covenants sanctified by blood sacrifices.33The growing prevalenceof oath taking in itself betrayed the lack of trust among aristocratic lin-eages, even within a single state.34These oaths and covenants typicallycalled upon the ancestors and other spirits to bear witness to the com-pact and punish those who violated their vows. Undergirding theseoaths, and the conduct of warfare, was a code of chivalry imbued withthe sacred authority of Zhou ritual but no longer constrained by thedictates of Tian’s mandate.During these centuries of endemic warfare and aggressive conquestthe relationship between the living and the dead once again underwenta major transformation. Although the ritual aspect of ancestorhoodevolved in the direction of ever-greater abstraction and systematization,as individuals the ancestors now were believed to have their own specificexistence (“soul”) and fate in the afterlife. In the eyes of the living, thedead endured more and more as distinct personalities even as their rit-ual preeminence diminished. Moreover, the warrior aristocracy’s cult ofhonor fostered vivid images of the ancestors as heroic figures whose ro-bust vitality could not be bound by the coils of mortal existence.30Ancestors, Ghosts, and Gods"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Sometimes the spirits of the dead appeared as awesome titans re-splendent in battle dress, but most realized only a pathetic existence asemaciated ghosts dependent on their descendants for sustenance. Thistheme recurs throughout the Chronicles of Zuo,a narrative history of theSpring and Autumn period probably compiled in the fourth century b.c.e.For example, the Chroniclesrelates that in the year 628 b.c.e.the Lordof Wei, after being driven from the Wei homeland, set up a new capitalat Diqiu and continued his ancestral sacrifices there. Soon afterward, thelord had a dream in which the founder of the house of Wei complainedto him that the sacrificial offerings intended for the Wei ancestors hadbeen stolen by a certain Xiang, an ancient king of the Xia dynasty (leg-endary predecessors of the Shang) who dwelled at Diqiu long ago. Uponawakening the lord instructed his officials to prepare sacrifices to Xiangas well as his ancestors. But an advisor named Ningwu objected, sayingthat “unless the spirits of the dead [guishen]are members of one’s ownlineage, they cannot partake of your sacrificial offerings.” The descen-dants of Xia had forsaken Xiang, Ningwu continued, but Wei bore noresponsibility for Xiang’s unfortunate fate, and indeed could do noth-ing for him.35Bereft of ancestral sacrifices, orphan ghosts like Xiang werecondemned to a shadowy existence as restless, perturbed spirits.Eastern Zhou culture was permeated by fear of ghosts or revenants,spirits of the dead who linger in the world of the living. One of the prin-cipal purposes of ancestor worship was to keep the dead in their place.If properly cared for, the souls of the dead would remain in the tomband not seek to return to the world of the living. The most likely reasonfor the ghosts of the dead to remain in the mortal world was that the ap-pointed life span of the deceased had not yet been exhausted, leaving aresidue of liminal vitality in the form of a ghost. This was especially trueof those who died by violence, including victims of suicide, and infantswho died in childbirth. In addition, unfortunates like Xiang, the neglectedking of Xia, who failed to receive proper offerings from their descen-dants, might return to the mundane realm in search of nourishment. Themorbid touch of these ghosts could harm the life force of the living, caus-ing sickness and death. Moreover, victims of violence were believed tobe actively malevolent, seeking vengeance against those responsible fortheir deaths. The culture of violence and the never-ending cycles ofvendetta and bloodshed it inspired, so central to the culture of the East-ern Zhou warrior aristocracy, produced many such ghostly souls, unableto find peace until the injustices they suffered had been avenged. Anotheranecdote from the Chronicles of Zuoillustrates the fears aroused by theseAncestors, Ghosts, and Gods31"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"“vengeful ghosts.” In 534 b.c.e., the aristocratic lineages of the pettystate of Zheng were stricken by terror of the ghost of a notorious no-bleman named Boyou, who had been accused of treason and slain by hisenemies eight years before. Subsequently Boyou’s ghost appeared beforeseveral witnesses and warned that he would kill specific individuals incertain years. Two of his announced victims indeed died at the prophe-sied time. The chief minister of Zheng, the renowned statesman Zichan,responded to the ensuing panic by appointing Boyou’s son to his father’sformer office, which allowed the son the privilege of building an ances-tral temple and offering sacrifices to his father’s spirit. AfterwardsBoyou’s ghost ceased his hauntings. Asked to explain his actions, Zichanreplied, “When the spirit of a dead person has a proper abode to whichit can return, it will not engage in evildoing. I simply provided a restingplace for Boyou’s spirit.”36Zichan also attested to the pervasive belief in ghosts shared by his con-temporaries. In response to inquiries about whether Boyou had indeedbecome a ghost capable of inflicting harm upon the living, Zichan an-swered in the affirmative:When a man is born, he is transformed into a corporeal being, which wecall po.Possessing a body, he thus also is endowed with vitality, his yangspirit. Those who command great property and occupy high station arestrong both in body and spirit. For this reason [upon their deaths] theirpure and sublime qiwill attain manifest spirithood. If men and women of vulgar station die violent deaths, their somatic [po]and psychic [hun]souls are capable of possessing the living and causing grievous harm. Howmuch more so is this true of Liangxiao [i.e., Boyou], descendant of our for-mer ruler Lord Ma, grandson of Ziling, son of Zi’er, all nobles of our state,who have served as ministers for three successive generations!37Zichan’s explanation of the malevolent powers of ghosts reflected thevast differences in social status inherent in the aristocratic society of theSpring and Autumn era. Persons of noble birth were believed to be en-dowed with greater vital energy and more refined physical substance (ex-pressed by Zichan in terms of qi,a concept central to Chinese metaphysicsthat encompassed both matter and energy; see below, pp. 36–37). Thesublime qiof the nobility persisted long after death, in contrast to thecrude qiof the multitude, which quickly dissipated. Yet Zichan also ac-knowledged that the unspent life force of even a lowborn person whosuffered a violent death might remain in the mundane world as a bale-ful ghost, and even assume another bodily form.Zichan’s reference to po and hunsouls signaled the emergence of a32Ancestors, Ghosts, and Gods"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"dualistic conception of the postmortem “soul” that became widespreadby early Han times. According to this belief, human beings possessed bothsomatic and psychic identity, in the form of the conjoined poand hunsouls.38At the moment of death, these poand hunsouls divided, eachseeking its proper place of repose. The hunsoul, the conscious spirit ofthe person, fled the body and dissolved. The pocontinued to reside withthe body, though eventually it too decayed, much like the corpse itself.Ancestor worship increasingly focused on enabling the deceased to makea successful transition to the afterlife and ensuring that the posoul re-mained securely ensconced within the tomb and not left to wander amongthe living. In this light, Confucius’s famous pronouncement that oneshould “revere the spirits, but keep one’s distance from them” probablyreflects the common sentiment of an age in which the souls of the deadwere increasingly feared as potentially harmful to the living.39Beginning around the fourth century b.c.e., the noble classes becamemore and more entranced with the idea of escaping death altogether.Soothsayers beguiled the monarchs of the day with fantastic descriptionsof distant yet earthly paradises populated by “immortals” (xian). Oncemere mortals themselves, the xianhad, through arduous regimens of dietand yogic exercises along with ingestion of purifying elixirs, purged theirbody of its gross properties and transformed it into a light, ethereal formcapable of ascending to the cloud-borne paradises.40The xianthusachieved immortality by escaping death altogether. Fascination with thisliberation from death initially developed along the eastern seaboard, inthe states of Yan and Qi, whose inhabitants imagined a paradise of theimmortals existing beyond the sea’s horizon. In the landlocked states ofthe west and south, however, the immortals were believed to reside inan Olympian paradise atop Mount Kunlun, the axis mundiat the cen-ter of the world that joined together heaven and earth. Mount Kunlunwas thought to be located far to the west, in the twilight where the sunset, and it thus became entwined with a variety of Chinese myths aboutthe afterlife. Mount Kunlun was also said to be the abode of a mysteri-ous monarch, the Queen Mother of the West (Xiwangmu). Perhaps afigure from a vestigial legend from early Zhou times concerning a femaleruler at the far western margins of the Zhou polity, the Queen Motherof the West reemerged in Han mythology as the guardian of the secretsof immortality, which she imparted only to the most august princes ofthe mortal world.41Throughout the Eastern Zhou period, the cult of Tian continued torecede along with the moribund authority of the Zhou king. Rulers ofAncestors, Ghosts, and Gods33"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"the rising independent states oriented their attention instead to regionalcults, particularly the tutelary deities of their own domains. The notionof a supreme being who acted as the arbiter of human fate persisted,though this god now was more commonly referred to as Shangdi(Supreme Thearch) or Tiandi (Celestial Thearch). But like the aloof Diof Shang religion, Shangdi/Tiandi remained distant and inscrutable,seemingly deaf to human cries against tyranny and injustice. With themoral foundations of monarchy in ruins, even Confucians despaired ofseeking moral order in the workings of the cosmos.The obligation to pursue glory through rites of violence led to inces-sant warfare among states and also provoked civil wars between com-peting lineages within states, culminating in the annihilation of many ofthe original vassal domains along with their ruling families. By the fifthcentury b.c.e., fewer than two dozen of the hundreds of domains es-tablished by the early Zhou kings remained in existence. Those that sur-vived did so largely because their rulers had succeeded in subduing theirdomestic rivals and instituting a more autocratic form of government.Monarchs of the Warring States era (traditionally dated to 403–221b.c.e.) gained direct control over the land and labor resources of theirrealms, enabling them to mobilize and maintain the large armies requiredby escalating warfare, now that massive infantry engagements had su-perseded chariot duels. Commoners were released from their obligationsto the noble lords, whom they once had served as serflike dependents,and instead became direct subordinates to the monarch and his bur-geoning bureaucratic state. The monarch awarded land grants to plebeianhouseholds in return for military and corvée labor service and tax pay-ments of grain and cloth. The individual household, now responsible forits own economic welfare, became the basic unit of production, con-sumption, and taxation in Chinese society. The new political and eco-nomic relationship between prince and subject established during theWarring States era foreshadowed the imperial system inaugurated by therulers of Qin in 221 b.c.e.The new political order of the Warring States era was founded on prin-ciples of a raison d’état,exemplified above all by the Legalist statesmen-philosophers of Qin, that effected a radical separation of governmentfrom ethics. It was Qin that, in the fourth century b.c.e., first deprivedits aristocratic lineages of their hereditary offices and benefices and in-stituted a bureaucratic state under the supreme rule of an autocraticmonarch. The Legalist political philosophy admitted no authority exceptthe ruler’s decrees, which were codified into elaborate and harshly puni-34Ancestors, Ghosts, and Gods"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"tive systems of administrative and penal law. Legalism repudiated the en-tire charter of Zhou governance, denying any supernatural source ofmoral or political legitimation. But the constant turmoil of the WarringStates period fed rulers’ fears and ambitions in equal proportion. De-spite their embrace of the austere and uncompromising rationalism ofLegalist philosophy, the rulers of Qin and rival states hungered for proof,conveyed through divine omen and prophecy, that they would ultimatelytriumph in the contest for supremacy. This hunger quickened with theextinction of the house of Zhou at the hands of the rapidly expandingQin in 256 b.c.e.Philosophy in this age was dominated by two contrary yet interrelatedtrends. Growing skepticism of Zhou theology or any belief in a provi-dential supreme being, evident by this time in Confucian as much as Le-galist thinking, whetted faith in the power of human reason to governhuman affairs. Yet this skeptical rationalism was counterbalanced by ananxious search for consistent meaning and pattern in both human affairsand the cosmos as a whole. Legions of learned men flocked to the courtsof powerful monarchs, offering esoteric knowledge and magical formu-las that would enable rulers to achieve both personal and political im-mortality. While these “masters of occult arts” (fangshi),as contempo-raries dubbed them, professed to wield a wide array of mantic skills, theirclaims of efficacy rested on a common ontological ground, one perhapsbest described as correlative cosmology.42Correlative cosmology asserted a fundamental homology between hu-man affairs and cosmic order, both of which were governed by certaincycles, rhythms, and patterns of change and transformation. The rela-tionship between the human and natural worlds was seen as organic butasymmetric: although changes in one produced corresponding changesin the other, ultimately the human realm was subordinate to the inex-orable logic of self-generating metamorphosis imbedded in the cosmos.The fangshiclaimed exclusive knowledge of the underlying principles ofchange, knowledge that would enable the ruler to align himself and hisgovernment with the ascendant phase of cosmic order and thereby gainmastery of the mundane world.Some of the theories subsumed under the general rubric of correlativecosmology stemmed from older, holistic notions of cosmic order, suchas the dyadic principles of yinand yang,or female and male essences,frequently invoked as the ineffable ground of reality in the renowned mys-tical text Dao De Jing.Correlative cosmology often is linked to the DaoDe Jing,but in contrast to the latter, which derogates the human mindAncestors, Ghosts, and Gods35"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"as utterly incapable of apprehending the workings of the cosmos (ex-pressed as Dao,or “the Way”), correlative cosmology confidentlyaffirmed that the wise ruler could indeed attain such omniscience. Otherversions of correlative cosmology were novel inventions conceived byleading fangshiof the Warring States period. The best known of themwas the theory of Five Phases (Wuxing), espoused most notably by ZouYan (ca. 305–ca. 240 b.c.e.). One of the most celebrated and success-ful fangshiof the day, Zou believed that human history and cosmic or-der repeatedly passed through a cycle of five phases or “powers” (de,aword also central to the philosophy of the Dao De Jing that connotescharismatic sovereignty). Zou linked the Five Phases with their corre-sponding instantiations in the natural world, beginning with the fiveelemental forces of nature (water, fire, wood, earth, and metal) and ex-tending to the five cardinal directions (including the center as well asthe four points of the compass), the five visible planets, the five primarycolors, and innumerable other phenomenological categories. Zou’s for-mula, and the numerous variations it spawned, enjoyed great popular-ity, especially among the monarchs contending for dominion over theChinese world.Given the centrality of the precepts of correlative cosmology in laterChinese thought, it is surprising that we find no real evidence of themprior to the Warring States period. Another concept that enters promi-nently into Warring States philosophical discourse, and indeed becamefundamental to theories of correlative cosmology, is qi.We have alreadyseen the term employed by Zichan to express the different gradations oflife force that enabled the spirits of the nobility to endure far longer af-ter death than those of common birth. Qidefies any simple translation.In its earliest attested form, the word qidenoted the vapor of clouds orboiling grains. These meanings suggest on one hand the formless sub-stance or kinetic powers of the universe, and on the other the nourish-ing energy vital to sustaining life.43As a philosophical concept, qicameto represent the pervasive “stuff” of the universe, with equal emphasison what Greek physics distinguished as matter and energy. But qican-not be reduced to a single constituent. Rather, all phenomena possesstheir own unique qi,which in the categorical schemes of Five Phases cos-mology ramified into virtually limitless types and permutations. The con-cept of qiassumed an especially important place in the emerging discourseabout the human body and how it functioned. Qiwas applied to boththe somatic and psychic dimensions of the body, encompassing a per-son’s emotions, dispositions, and qualities of character as well as the phys-36Ancestors, Ghosts, and Gods"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"ical self. Qiquickly achieved prominence in medical theory, as in cor-relative cosmology as a whole, because of its utility in giving sublime ex-pression to both the organic unity and the boundless heterogeneity ofthe cosmos.The primary impulse behind the Five Phases theories propounded byZou Yan and others was a prophetic one. The ability to correctly situ-ate the present historical moment within the grand cycles of cosmicchange conferred foreknowledge, and thus control, of the future direc-tion of human history. By adapting his government—particularly in itsall-important ritual dimension—to prevailing cosmic principles, the pre-scient monarch could maintain harmony between the cosmic and humanorders and thereby preserve his own political supremacy amid the vicis-situdes of a constantly changing world. Some fangshiinterpreted dis-turbances of nature—such as irregular astral phenomena (comets andeclipses), natural disasters, and other manifestations of discordant qi—as omens, issuing prophetic warnings of cosmic imbalance. Fangshialsoutilized correlative cosmology to devise techniques for maintaining bal-ance and stasis within the body, thereby forestalling the debilitation ofaging; their prescriptions for long life and even immortality naturally at-tracted the rapt attention of contemporary rulers. In many cases the fang-shiclaimed that the esoteric formulas in their possession were impartedby spirits or gods, or by the xianimmortals.One monarch captivated by the fangshiand their theories was KingZheng of Qin (r. 247–210 b.c.e.), who brought the imperial aspirationsof his house to completion by unifying all of China under his iron rule.After vanquishing his last rival in 221 b.c.e., Zheng declared himselfFirst Emperor of the Qin empire. The First Emperor’s triumphs seem tohave only whetted his megalomaniacal preoccupation with his own mor-tality, and he readily indulged all manner of soothsayers, prophets, andmagicians in his quest to wrest a final victory from death itself. Despitehis allegiance to the tenets of Legalism, which denied the existence of anuminous realm beyond mundane sense perception, the First Emperorinstituted a state religion that combined the doctrines of correlative cos-mology and the exuberant visions of favored fangshiwith worship ofdeities long honored by the Qin rulers, most notably Huangdi, or theYellow Thearch. In part due to Qin patronage, Huangdi became the mostvaunted figure in both official and popular pantheons of the gods.Legends of Warring States provenance relate that the ancient sage-kingshad performed sacrifices to the gods of mountains and rivers in additionto Shangdi. The Zhou kings, too, paid homage to sacred mountains andAncestors, Ghosts, and Gods37"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"rivers, while their vassals worshiped the mountain and river spirits oftheir own territories.44The systematizing impulse of correlative cosmol-ogy prompted incorporation of these sundry local gods into a compre-hensive pantheon crowned by the Five Thearchs (Wudi), each of whomsymbolized one of the Five Phases of cosmic order. The Five Thearchsalso fused with ancient mountain-god cults, assuming alter egos as thepresiding deities of the Five Marchmounts (Wuyue), the five sacred moun-tains of China. Zhou texts often invoked the Four Marchmounts as ametaphor for the ruling lineages of distant regions, especially the foreignpeoples around the periphery of the Zhou ecumene. By the Warring Statesperiod a fifth marchmount had been added, to conform to the symme-try of Five Phases cosmology, and each of the marchmounts was identifiedwith a particular sage-king of antiquity.45According to the Han historian Sima Qian, veneration of the FiveThearchs dated back at least to Lord Xiang of Qin (r. 776–764 b.c.e.),the first Qin ruler admitted into the collegium of Zhou vassals, who wassaid to have worshiped the White Thearch (Baidi) as patron of the Qinruling house.46The White Thearch was believed to be the apotheosis ofShaohao, eldest son of Huangdi.47Shaohao was associated with thepower of metal and hence its corresponding color, white, and direction,the west. Since Qin was located at the extreme western edge of the Zhoupolity, it logically followed that the Qin rulers should have adopted Shao-hao, in the guise of the White Thearch, as their patron deity. But the claimthat Lord Xiang initiated the Qin cult of the White Thearch probablyrepresents a later interpolation that retroactively identified the WhiteThearch with an ancient god worshiped in the area of the original Qincapital. In any event, the Qin rulers were not exclusively dedicated to thecult of the White Thearch. Lord Ling of Qin (r. 423–413 b.c.e.) builtshrines for the worship of Huangdi and the Fiery Thearch (Yandi), twofigures depicted in legend as fierce adversaries.48By the reign of KingZheng, the future First Emperor of Qin, the cult of Huangdi overshad-owed all of its rivals for the attention of the Qin rulers.49In late Warring States texts Huangdi appears as an ancient sage-king,but by Han times Huangdi was regarded as an avatar of the supreme de-ity (Shangdi/Tiandi). The ruling house of Qi, the dominant state in east-ern China, claimed descent from Huangdi, and the prominence of the Qicapital as the main philosophical forum of the day and the hearth of the-ories of correlative cosmology no doubt burnished Huangdi’s image asa paragon of wisdom and leadership.50At this time the name Shangdialso was rendered as Huangdia51or “Resplendent Thearch,” and it seems38Ancestors, Ghosts, and Gods"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"likely that as the precepts of correlative cosmology became more deeplyentrenched the homonymous Huangdi (Yellow Thearch) gained wide cur-rency as an alternative name for the supreme deity.52Huangdiawas alsothe title chosen by King Zheng of Qin (who styled himself Qin Shihuangdi,or “First of the Resplendent Thearchs of Qin”) to express his dignity asemperor. (The prosaic English translation of Huangdiaas “emperor” ob-viously fails to capture the implications of theocratic power imbeddedin the Chinese word.)Huangdi emerged in Warring States mythology as the archetypal heroof the autocratic monarchs of the day and the antithesis of the warriorsof the Spring and Autumn aristocracy.53Legends current in Han timesdepict Huangdi as an extraordinary mortal named Xuanyuan who livedat the dawn of human civilization, in the declining years of the dynastyestablished by the first sage-king, Shennong (the Divine Husbandman,reputed to be the inventor of agriculture). Xuanyuan fought righteouswars against the forces of disorder, restoring tranquility to the humanworld, and in gratitude the multitude elected him as supreme ruler, dis-placing the lineage of Shennong.54Huangdi also figured in Han legendas a god of storms and rain, and thus was the natural adversary of theFiery Thearch, god of the sun and drought. Huangdi and the FieryThearch used their respective “weapons of water and fire” to battle eachother for control over the fate of the agricultural cycle and dominion overthe mortal world.55Virtually all myths emphasize Huangdi’s resort tocoercion and violence as a necessary expedient to subdue lawless elementsand restore civil rule. Consequently, the exaltation of Huangdi as theparagon of sage rule affirmed the sovereign’s legitimate use of violenceto impose order. As the inventor of the codes of ritual and law by whichcivil society could be created and sustained, Huangdi provided a com-pelling precedent for autocratic monarchs seeking to bring to heel theobdurate and fractious warrior nobility.In legend and myth Huangdi’s most formidable opponent was a bale-ful warrior known as Chiyou.56Though scholars differ on the mythicorigins of Chiyou,57by the Warring States period Chiyou was joined toHuangdi mythology as the archetype of anarchic violence and conflict.In the Punishments of Lü(Lüxing;now preserved as a chapter of theDocuments) and other third-century b.c.e.texts, Chiyou is blamed forinventing metallic weapons and using them to sow disorder.58A late Hantext describes Chiyou as a savage man-beast hybrid: “Chiyou and hiseighty-one brothers all possessed the bodies of beasts, but were capableof human speech. They had bronze heads and iron brows, and ate sandAncestors, Ghosts, and Gods39"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"and stones. Armed with the weapons they created, including swords, hal-berds, and great crossbows, they shook and awed the whole civilizedworld, attacking and killing without reason or mercy.” Unable to restrainChiyou and his cohorts with suasion and kindness, Huangdi finallylaunched a punitive campaign against them. Yet Huangdi triumphed onlythrough divine intercession. Heaven dispatched the Dark Woman to be-stow magic charms on Huangdi, who used them as weapons to vanquishChiyou and put him to death.59Popular legends, such as the one just cited, identified Chiyou as theinventor of “the five kinds of weapons” (wubing),though learned au-thorities, no doubt appalled by Chiyou’s outlaw character, instead cred-ited the invention of weapons to Huangdi. Both Huangdi and Chiyouwere venerated as gods of war by the Qin and Han emperors. The tworepresented contrasting faces of violence: whereas Huangdi exemplifiedthe legitimate use of force in defense of the rule of law, Chiyou stood forwanton mayhem. But of course the two aspects of warfare could not becompletely differentiated. Following his defeat at the hands of Huangdi,Chiyou was said to have entered the latter’s service and earned distinc-tion as Huangdi’s loyal lieutenant. Huangdi’s defeat of Chiyou thus be-came a metaphor for the triumph of order over anarchy, a basic motif inChinese religious culture. Later myth and folklore is replete with fear-some, violent demons who are subjugated by a virtuous ruler and hence-forth place their prodigious strength and martial skills at the disposal ofthe rightful sovereign.Apart from his mythological role as the chief adversary of Huangdi,Chiyou also appeared in Han religion as a guardian deity who protectedtravelers from loathsome demons lurking in wild and unfamiliar places.After all, Chiyou’s macabre visage was no less terrifying to demons thanto human beings. According to a Han legend, after Chiyou died lawlesselements once again brazenly defied the law, whereupon Huangdi orderedhis subordinates to make images of the fierce warrior and display themthroughout the realm to cow any recalcitrant evildoers into submission.60The terrifying aspect of Chiyou only enhanced his role as a queller ofdemons. Priests conducting the exorcisms held during the important mid-winter festivals conjured up Chiyou’s image to expel noxious demonsprior to the arrival of the New Year. Chiyou was also incorporated intofunerary ritual as an apotropaic deity warding off evil spirits. In Hantomb iconography Chiyou appears as a fearsome beast brandishing fivetypes of weapons (figure 4). In this guise he represented the terriblemajesty of the monarch and the swift hand of imperial justice. Chiyou40Ancestors, Ghosts, and Gods"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"also became an object of popular worship during the Han. Shrines ded-icated to Chiyou in the vicinity of Jizhou (Shandong), reputedly the siteof the climactic battle between Chiyou and Huangdi, depicted him in hu-man form but with bovine hooves, four eyes, and six hands. Chiyou wasalso described as having horns, and forelocks as sharp as the blades ofweapons.61Chiyou thus became the mythic double of Huangdi: whilethe latter evolved into a regal sovereign presiding over a tranquil king-dom, Chiyou remained a stark reminder of the harsh punishments metedout to those who flouted the monarch’s laws.The Qin rulers’ devotion to Huangdi heralded the rise of a new con-ception of the ruler as a thaumaturgic king, master of all the elementalpowers of the universe. Huangdi quite literally became central to the con-ceptions of human history that arose from Five Phases cosmology: as thepresiding god-king of the Center (linked to the element earth and the coloryellow in Five Phases correspondences), Huangdi stood both at the be-ginning of Chinese civilization and the apex of the celestial pantheon.The august majesty of Huangdi shines through the epiphany describedin the Hanfeizi,a Legalist treatise of the third century b.c.e.:Long ago Huangdi gathered together the ghosts and spirits on the westernsummit of Mount Tai [Taishan, chief of the Five Marchmounts]. He rodean ivory chariot pulled by six dragons. Bifang [a fire deity] ran beside him,while Chiyou went ahead. The Wind Lord [Fengbo] swept the path, andthe Rain Master [Yushi] wetted down the dust. Tigers and wolves were in front, and ghosts and spirits followed behind. Lizards and snakes werebeneath, while the phoenix flew overhead. When all the ghosts and spiritswere gathered together, Huangdi created the pure jiaomusic [which soothesthe savage beasts and demons].62Here we see Huangdi commanding the awesome powers of nature em-bodied in spirits like the Wind Lord and Rain Master.63Although theceremonial complex the Qin rulers built at Yong, their capital from 677to 384 b.c.e., included altars devoted to the other thearchs in additionto Huangdi, the latter ranked as the supreme lord of the divine and mor-tal realms. In Han dynasty cosmological lore Huangdi was transmogrifiedinto an omnipotent deity and progenitor of the universe. One of the cos-mographic works collected into the anthology Treatises of Huainan(sec-ond century b.c.e.) portrays Huangdi as a star god with power over thefate of mortals. The stellar monarch and his four chamberlains, locatedin the central constellations of the northern sky, took note of human con-duct, rewarding virtue with long life and punishing evildoers by short-ening their allotted life span.64Elsewhere in the same anthology HuangdiAncestors, Ghosts, and Gods41"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Figure 4.

The rationalist temper of Warring States–Hanthought produced two utterly distinct images of Huangdi. In politicalphilosophy, Huangdi was dressed in the raiment of the sage-king, aparagon of the just use of force, but nevertheless very much a mortal hu-man being. Metaphysicians, in contrast, rendered Huangdi into a whollydepersonalized abstraction, a categorical imperative of Five Phases cos-mology, essential to the workings of the cosmos but divorced from mun-dane life. Yet among the populace at large, as we shall see, these two con-trasting images fused into the more vivid person of the awesome lord ofthe underworld.Despite its remarkable success in instituting a universal empire, theQin was unable to sustain its harsh rule. The Qin state collapsed afterthe First Emperor’s death in 210 b.c.e., and a few years later it was re-placed by the far longer-lived Han dynasty (202 b.c.e.–220 c.e.). Thefounder of the Han retained the political infrastructure of the Qin em-pire, yet at the same time he embraced the nearly defunct tenets of moralsovereignty espoused in Zhou theology. The Han instituted imperial wor-ship of many new gods, such as Houtu, the Lord of the Earth (and ter-restrial corollary of the celestial Huangdi), and Taiyi, or Grand Unity,67while continuing to pay homage to the Five Thearchs at the old Qin cer-emonial center at Yong.68By the end of the first century b.c.e., though,these cults had been eclipsed by a reawakened faith in Tian and the po-litical ideals of Zhou championed by the Confucian tradition. Once se-curely in command of their empire, the Han emperors spurned the Qinstate’s exclusive reliance on military force and the rule of law in favorof Confucian homilies regarding moral authority and civil order. The re-ligious reform carried out under the watchful eyes of Confucian minis-ters in 31 b.c.e.removed the shrines to Houtu, Taiyi, and the FiveThearchs to remote sites and expunged nearly five hundred shrines fromthe official register of sacrifices. The religious reforms reoriented impe-rial worship toward exclusive veneration of Heaven (Tian) and Earth.In contrast to the ancient Zhou cult, though, the Han cult of Heavenrendered Tian into a moral abstraction devoid of personality. While stillAncestors, Ghosts, and Gods43"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"compelling allegiance, Tian no longer intimidated the mundane sover-eign as the stern patriarch of Zhou religion had.

The trepida-tion with which Han Chinese beheld the gods was reinforced by newlyarisen fears of the subjugation of the dead to punishment in the afterlife.44Ancestors, Ghosts, and Gods"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"chapter 2The Han Cult of the Deadand Salvific ReligionDuring the four centuries of Han rule, Chinese conceptions of death andthe afterlife underwent a profound transformation brought about notonly by new ideas about the divine, but also by changes in the relation-ship between the living and their ancestors. Han Chinese expressed deepanxieties about the fate of the dead. The spirits of the dead were believedto endure as vital beings in the tomb yet at the same time were subjectto divine judgment and punishment. The emerging pantheon of celestialand terrestrial deities was complemented by a vision of a vast underworldbureaucracy conceived in the image of the Han imperial state and its or-gans of justice. The infernal gods meted out severe punishments to mor-tals who led a sinful life, penalties that might also bring harm to theirdescendants. Given the grim fate awaiting the dead in the afterlife, thespirits of the ancestors, always feared, now were pitied as well. No longerseen as gods with the power to confer or withhold blessings, the ances-tors instead were regarded as abject ghouls wracked by deprivation andsuffering. The purposes and forms of ancestor worship shifted accord-ingly. Dread of postmortem punishment also spawned numerous religioussects devoted to the expiation of sin through faith healing and austereliving. Promise of salvation from mortal misery as well as infernal pun-ishment kindled popular allegiance to these upstart sects and preparedthe ground for the transplanting of Buddhism to Chinese soil in the cen-turies after the fall of the Han dynasty in 220 c.e.Changes in ideas about death and afterlife are evident in the dramatic45"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"transformation of mortuary practices that occurred between the fifth andfirst centuries b.c.e.This transformation, far more profound than thetransition between Shang and Zhou, is most readily visible in the con-struction and architecture of the tomb, the route of passage from the mor-tal world to the divine realm. Tombs of the early Zhou nobility, thoughlavishly furnished with bronzes and other grave goods, were simple ver-tical pits of modest dimension, barely sufficient to accommodate the coffinand its accompanying ritual paraphernalia.1Beginning in central Chinaas early as the eighth century b.c.e., and most strikingly in the state ofChu in south-central China from the sixth century b.c.e., persons of no-ble descent were provided with more elaborate and better-protectedtombs using stout, intricately joined wooden frames. From the late fifthcentury b.c.e.onward, vertical-shaft tombs were replaced by spaciouschambers, often divided into two or more separate rooms laid out hor-izontally, with brick walls, arched doorways, and gabled ceilings. Thesemultichambered brick tombs replicated the world of the living, their scaleand amenities graded according to the deceased’s rank in mortal society,which as time wore on was determined more by the individual’s ownachievements in public life than by the hereditary status of his or her fam-ily.2Living monarchs, starkly conscious of their mortality, began to pro-vide for their own afterlife by building mausolea on a monumental scale,recreating within the tomb the sumptuous lifestyle to which they wereaccustomed. Even the modest catacomb tombs of those of more humblestation reveal an effort to imitate domestic architecture in constructinga permanent resting place for the poof the deceased.3An equally remarkable change in mortuary goods accompanied thetransformation in tomb architecture. Zhou tombs, like those of Shang,were equipped with a ritual inventory that marked the occupant’s rankand position within the lineage, present and past. In the Spring and Au-tumn era, tombs of the Zhou nobility were supplied with assemblagesof bronze offering vessels (in quantities prescribed by ritual protocol),sets of bells and musical chimes, weapons and other accoutrements ofwarriors, and human sacrifices (subject to strong regional variation). Be-ginning in the seventh century b.c.e., the finely wrought bronze vesselsused in rituals came to be replaced by cheaper or miniature replicas,known as mingqi,intended exclusively for entombment in the grave. Theuse of mingqiapparently originated in the northwest, where the Qin rulerswere the first to build large, complex tombs.4During the Warring Statesperiod, the old bronze ritual vessel assemblages disappeared. Some newforms of bronze vessels appeared, and ritual regalia continued to exalt46The Han Cult of the Dead"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"the nobility’s supreme powers over life and death by featuring the “threegreat affairs of state”—warfare, hunting, and sacrifice—as the principalmotifs of bronze decoration.5Yet the most striking features of WarringStates mortuary goods were the novelties in tomb furnishings, includ-ing the introduction of lacquer utensils; domestic items like braziers,lamps, incense burners, mirrors, and ordinary cooking vessels; and wallmurals illustrating the tomb occupant enjoying his postmortem existencewithin the tomb.6These changes in tomb construction and mortuarygoods indicate that the tomb gradually became perceived as the post-mortem abode of the dead, who maintained an ineffable yet materialexistence after burial.7The new conception of the tomb as the perpetual abode of the powasalso reflected in mortuary ritual. In Shang and Western Zhou religion,ancestral temples and tombs were integral elements in a cohesive regi-men of sacrifice vital to the regeneration of the charismatic power uponwhich secular authority rested.8In the Spring and Autumn period, thetemple still served as a sacred space for ritual renewal of lineage soli-darity through communion between the living and the dead. By the War-ring States period, though, the tomb began to supersede the ancestraltemple as the focus of mortuary rites. The displacement of the temple bythe tomb was loudly condemned by ritual experts of the Han dynasty,who blamed the notorious First Emperor of Qin for instigating this de-viant practice. In fact the First Emperor’s vast mausoleum, with its mas-sive army of life-size terra-cotta guardians, merely represented the cul-mination of a trend that had been underway for several centuries. Thedisplacement of the temple by the tomb as the primary site of ancestralsacrifices inherently changed the nature of the sacrifice itself. Whereassacrifices made at the temple were offered to the ancestors as a collec-tive body, rituals performed at the tomb were addressed to individualancestors. It was this unseemly emphasis on the individual, and its po-tential for disrupting lineage solidarity, that most enraged Han scholars.The spreading belief that the spirits of the departed continued to re-alize a sentient existence within the tomb provoked much anxiety abouttheir welfare. Great mausolea like the one built by the First Emperor ofQin offer eloquent evidence of this unease. Apart from these magnificentroyal monuments, though, most people provided for the material com-fort of their ancestors in far more modest fashion by equipping tombswith utilitarian mingqimade in the likeness of granaries, livestock, stoves,wells, and other articles of domestic life believed to help sustain the spiritof the tomb occupant. Mingqialso represented people, places, and ob-The Han Cult of the Dead47"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"jects familiar to the individual, such as houses, servants, or musical in-struments. Unlike the precious and finely made artifacts interred withthe Shang and early Zhou nobility, though, mingqiwere typically crudelyrendered in plebeian materials, especially ceramics, on a miniature scale.As offerings to the dead, mingqienunciated the sharp disjuncture betweenmundane existence and the afterlife.9Mingqiattested to an afterlife imag-ined not as a continuation of earthly splendor, but instead as its morbidshade, a realm of vestigial vitality and darkness.Confined to the tomb, the spirits of the dead remained woefully de-pendent on their descendants for sustenance. We see evidence of this con-cern in a set of tombs near Jining (Shandong) dating from the first cen-tury b.c.e., which contained ceramic jars filled with grain and wineintended as victuals for the ancestor spirits. One jar bears an inscriptionexpressing the hope that the grain it contained would alleviate the an-cestor’s anxieties over provisions in the afterlife, and thus ward off anycurse the ancestor might visit upon his descendants.10Here again wesee that the living harbored lingering fears of ancestor spirits who mighttake vengeance on their descendants for any lapse in piety. The livingprovided minimal comforts to the dead, sufficient to encourage the lat-ter to remain tranquil and content within the tomb, but remained evermindful of the need to keep a safe distance between themselves and thedeparted.The diffusion of the cult of the xianimmortals among the aristocracyin the Warring States and Han periods was registered in mortuary art byrepresentations of the hunsoul rising to join the immortals in their par-adise among the clouds. Perhaps the best example of this aspiration forimmortality is the funerary banner found at the Mawangdui tombs nearChangsha, within the Chu cultural sphere, which date from circa 168b.c.e.The central tableau of the banner depicts emissaries of the im-mortals greeting an elderly woman, presumably the occupant of the tomb,the Countess of Dai, who is escorted by several servants (figure 5). In thelower tableau we see an assembly of ritual vessels representing the an-cestral sacrifices offered by the living, while the top section displays a ce-lestial paradise presided over by a female figure, most likely the QueenMother of the West.11The Queen Mother of the West assumed many dif-ferent forms in Han mythology (see pp. 58–61), but in mortuary art shewas portrayed as a benevolent matriarch who welcomes the hunsoulsof the dead into her heavenly paradise atop Mount Kunlun. While theimmortals beckoned the hunsoul of the Countess of Dai to enter theirelysian paradise, the posoul, like the body itself, faced the grim prospect48The Han Cult of the Dead"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"of decay and putrefaction. A jade stopper had been placed in the count-ess’s mouth, perhaps to prevent her posoul from escaping. The count-ess’s family took elaborate care to embalm the corpse and encase it withinmultiple heavy-timbered coffins sealed in lacquer; in other cases, the bodyof the deceased was wrapped in suits of jade joined with gold filigree.12All of these exacting procedures were intended to forestall corruption ofthe body and dispersion of the po.The sumptuous decoration and grave goods of elite tombs like thoseat Mawangdui clearly show that the occupants aspired to reach a heav-enly paradise via the tomb. By the first century b.c.e.the cult of xianimmortality, once restricted to kings and nobles, had begun to attract awider audience among the upper orders of Han society. But mortals ofless exalted status viewed the passage to the afterlife and the prospect ofinfernal judgment with great unease.Han tombs were outfitted with a variety of apotropaic talismans in-tended to protect the deceased from the forces of putrefaction and de-cay. Guardian figurines in the form of ferocious creatures—such as thehybrid beast from a Chu tomb whose imposing antlers, bulging eyes, andprotruding tongue no doubt were intended to frighten off baleful un-derworld spirits (figure 6)—are found in tombs dating from the WarringStates period.13This wooden figure is depicted in the act of devouring asnake—symbolizing the corruption of the body in the tomb—that itgrasps in its hands. Similar motifs appear on the Mawangdui lacqueredcoffins, which are decorated with hybrid antelope-human figures engagedin combat with birds and snakes (figure 7). Late Han tombs often con-tain sculptures or stone reliefs of horned creatures placed at the entranceof the tomb as guardians.14It has already been noted that in Han timesthe tamed yet still fearsome Chiyou was invoked to protect tombs. Im-ages of the Queen Mother of the West were also placed at the entrancesof tombs to repel evil spirits. Bronze mirrors, perhaps the most distinc-tive feature of the mortuary inventory of Han tombs, most likely werealso intended to assist the deceased in their treacherous journey to theafterlife. These mirrors possibly served as a kind of cosmographic com-pass to guide the hunsoul of the deceased to the world of the immor-tals.15By the fourth century c.e.the idea that mirrors revealed the truenature of a being, and thus could be used to expose disguised demons,had gained some currency, but it is not known whether this belief waspresent in the Han.16Recently it has been argued that the placement ofbronze mirrors in Han tombs expressed aspirations for longevity (com-monly voiced in the inscriptions on the mirrors themselves) rather thanThe Han Cult of the Dead49"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Figure 5.

Astrologers proclaimedthat human fortune was in the hands of imperious celestial bureaucratsresiding in the far-off heavens. For example, the astral deity Siming (Sov-ereign of Life Destiny, associated with the constellation Ursa Major) wasportrayed as a celestial minister invested with the authority to determinethe life span of human beings.19Like a terrestrial magistrate, Siming alsoheard appeals on behalf of the wrongful dead who sought redress fortheir shortened life spans. One such petition appears in a recently exca-vated official document of the Qin state dated 269 b.c.e., which recountsthe case of a man named Dan, who committed suicide in 297 b.c.e.af-ter injuring another man in a sword fight. The governor of the regionsubsequently appealed to a subordinate of Siming, asking that Dan, whosefated life span had not yet been completed, be restored to life. Dan wasindeed resurrected from the dead, but he still bore the scars of his so-journ in the netherworld: though eventually his senses revived and hecould eat human food again, Dan never recovered the use of his armsand legs. Dan also was said to have instructed his familiars in the propercare of the dead. He emphasized that the dead gratefully welcomed eventhe most pedestrian offerings, but they were easily scared away and wouldonly eat offerings that had been prepared in strict accordance with rulesof ritual purity.20Dan’s fate, and his beggarly plea for humble offerings,undoubtedly mirrored prevailing views of the dead as weak and power-less, enduring an abject and forlorn existence in the grave.Around the end of the first century c.e., the cult of the dead began toassume increasingly elaborate forms. Elite mortuary ritual became fixatedon ascension to the paradise of immortals presided over by the QueenMother of the West. But in contrast to elite mythology, in which the dualhunand posouls implicitly aspired to ascend to paradise, plebeian reli-gion evinced no separation of souls at death. Instead, the souls of thedead were believed to descend to the submontane netherworld to awaitinfernal judgment. We find in Han religion a variety of gods who appearas supreme deities, controlling the fate of mortals in life and in death. Aswe have seen, contemporary mythology ascribed to Huangdi the power(not unlike that of Siming, the Sovereign of Life Destiny) to lengthen orshorten the life span of mortals in accordance with their good and evilactions. More commonly, the disposition of the dead was ascribed to theLord of Mount Tai (Taishan fujun), the presiding deity of the sacred52The Han Cult of the Dead"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"mountain of the east, chief among the Five Marchmounts (Wuyue). TheLord of Mount Tai ruled over an array of officials charged with record-ing all good and evil acts committed by individual mortals, as well as theappointed hour of their death, in voluminous registers of life and death.Those who ended their lives with a positive moral balance were welcomedinto the royal paradise on the summit of Mount Tai; those whose crimesoutweighed their virtues were sentenced to the “netherworld prisons”(diyu)beneath the mountain.Although the Lord of Mount Tai prevailed over Huangdi as thesupreme god of the underworld in later mythology, in Han texts the twodeities seem to be virtually interchangeable. For example, a mortuary textdated 173 c.e.states that “the Yellow God [Huangshen; i.e., Huangdi]governs the Five Marchmounts, who are in charge of the registers of thedead and summon the hunand posouls.”21This document suggests thatthe gods of each of the Five Marchmounts kept registers of life and deathfor the population within their jurisdiction, while Huangdi retained finalcontrol over the fate of the dead. Even more commonly, Han tomb doc-uments refer to the supreme deity as the Celestial Thearch (Tiandi). Thesuzerainty of the Celestial Thearch over not only the dead but also thedemonic spirits of the underworld is attested in a talisman recovered froma late Han tomb (figure 8). The top left corner of this wooden plaquebears the legend “talisman lord” (fujun),below which appears a dipper-shaped drawing of Ursa Major, seat of the celestial gods. The talisman,composed in esoteric script, is inscribed along the left edge of the plaque,while the legend at the lower right reads: “The name of the demon [gui]of those who die on the yisiday [one of the sixty days in the Chinese cal-endar] is Heavenly Light [Tianguang]. The spirit-master [shenshi]of theCelestial Thearch already knows your name; quickly remove yourself toa distance of three thousand leagues. If you fail to depart, Magistrate . . .[graphs illegible] of South Mountain will come to devour you. Promptly,in accordance with the statutes and ordinances.”22Like other Han tombdocuments (see below), this talisman invokes the awesome authority ofthe omniscient Celestial Thearch and his army of martial gods to pro-tect the tomb occupant against the depredations of evil spirits, who darenot defy the imperial command.The language of this talisman, which closes with the standard vale-diction used in Han imperial edicts, expresses the close correspondencebetween the operations of imperial and celestial government. The un-derworld magistrates before whom the dead were brought to be judgedapplied inquisitorial procedures that replicated the language and for-The Han Cult of the Dead53"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"malities of the actual Han judicial system. The Celestial Thearch (or, al-ternatively, Huangdi or the Lord of Mount Tai) delegated authority overmatters of life and death to subordinates who—like their counterpartsin Han government, the local magistrates—determined guilt or innocenceafter meticulous review of the comprehensive documentary record of theindividual’s life. Although induction into the ranks of the immortals re-mained a theoretical possibility, the somber tone of Han grave documentssuggests that most people anticipated a far bleaker end awaiting them inthe afterlife.The most intimate insight into popular beliefs regarding death andthe afterlife can be gleaned from various kinds of mortuary documentsrecovered from Han tombs.23These texts, written on durable materialslike lead or tile tablets or ceramic jars, sought to invoke the aid of thespirits of the grave site and the underworld on behalf of the soul of thedeparted. Among these documents are land-purchase contracts in whichthe survivors provide proof of their ownership of the tomb site and in-ventories of grave goods—typically ceramic figurines of slaves, chariots,Figure 8.

From the endof the first century c.e.a new type of grave document appears in theform of lengthy petitions written on ceramic jars that perhaps containedfood or elixirs intended to fortify the soul of the deceased during its so-journ in the netherworld. Composed in the style of legal plaints, thesepetitions were plainly modeled on the documents and judicial proceduresemployed by the Han government. The petitions were addressed to theCelestial Thearch or the Yellow God (that is, Huangdi). Early specimensof these documents, which Anna Seidel has called “celestial ordinancesfor the dead,” beseech the magistrates of the underworld to make cer-tain that the deceased was fated to die at this moment, and to protectthe soul from hostile demons. They implore the magistrates of the un-derworld to be diligent in reviewing the registers of life and death, mak-ing sure that no errors have crept in that might have distorted the indi-vidual’s record of conduct or wrongly altered the prescribed hour ofdeath. The living supplicants also included prayers addressed to the lo-cal earth spirits upon whom the tombs of mortals intruded, seeking for-giveness for having disturbed their domicile.Later petitions, dating from ca. 170–200 c.e., introduce a new con-cern, asking that the living descendants be exonerated from the crimesand misdeeds of the deceased and spared any punishment ordained bythe tribunes of the underworld.

But rather than reflectingfear of maverick vengeful ghosts characteristic of the Eastern Zhou era,the Han ordinances disclose new anxieties about the severe punishmentsmeted out by a forbidding underworld bureaucracy acting in the nameof the imperial sovereign. Fear of implication in the crimes of one’s an-cestors was rooted in actual Han jurisprudence, which mandated thatindividuals share in the culpability for crimes committed by any mem-ber of their family. The ordinances instead insisted that each individualis responsible for his or her own sins, and divine punishment must be re-stricted to the individual alone.By late Han times, then, the afterlife loomed before mortals as a ter-rifying world of merciless judgment and harsh punishment. Wracked bythe torments of penal servitude, the dead became a menace to their ownfamily members, seeking to escape their ordeals by displacing the bur-den of guilt, or at least the pain of punishment, onto their living de-scendants. Illness and misfortune were commonly blamed on vexed an-cestors who had filed with the underworld magistrates “writs of grievancefrom the grave” (zhongsong)requesting divine punishment for a panoplyof personal grievances and ritual infractions.28However pathetic the deadmight be, no matter how miserable their existence in the afterlife, theystill posed a threat to the living, and especially to their own descendants.In Han religion, death conferred power, both malevolent and benign.Once liberated from the confines of a mortal body, the spirits of the deadtook on a new life. As in earlier times, the hierarchy of the divine reflectedthe social order of the mortal world. But the social order itself hadchanged. The imperial bureaucracy emerged as the model for the hier-archical order of the divine. Learned authors portrayed the gods not astranscendent beings, but as ethereal transmutations of dead humanswhose exalted pedigree in the divine realm reflected their prodigious ac-complishments during their mortal lifetimes. Still, the spirits of the deaddid not fade away. Instead, two contrasting visions of the numinous realmexisted side by side. In the newer conception, the divine was conceivedas a simulacrum of temporal government, a hierarchical order of official-dom subject to the same constraints of law and administrative procedureimposed on imperial subjects. This bureaucratic model of the divine,which first emerged in the late Warring States period, enjoyed special cur-The Han Cult of the Dead57"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"rency among the educated elite, though it also found expression in pop-ular religious movements as well. At the same time, cults devoted to spir-its of the dead whose supernatural powers were fed by sacrificial offer-ings from the living, especially potent “blood sacrifices,” continued tohold sway among all social ranks.Certainly the deity who left the most marked imprint on Han mythand art was the Queen Mother of the West (Xiwangmu). The familiariconography portraying the Queen Mother of the West as a regal figurepresiding over a mountaintop kingdom of feathered immortals and fab-ulous creatures developed only in the last two centuries of the Han dy-nasty. In a separate, and earlier, mythological tradition preserved in theClassic of the Mountains and Seasshe appears not as an imposingmonarch (or, as a later tradition imagined her, a seductive temptress) butrather as a hideous ogre associated with ill-fated events and epidemics.In this form the Queen Mother of the West is described as a cave-dwellinghybrid creature having the tail of a leopard (or the body of a tiger) andtiger’s teeth; she is skilled at whistling (used by demons to lure their preyinto danger); and she commands spectral forces that spread misfortuneand pestilence among mortals.29It is possible that these sharply con-trasting portraits of the Queen Mother derived from distinct regional tra-ditions; the regal and feminine image of the Queen Mother seems moreakin to the xianmythology of Yan and Qi on the eastern seaboard thanthe putative “western” demonic representation. But the bestial image ofthe Queen Mother also resonates with older demonic images dating backto Shang times and perhaps earlier. The “tiger teeth” mentioned in theClassic of the Mountains and the Seasimmediately remind one of thefanged “demon” faces found in jade iconography extending from Shang(and perhaps from as far back as the Liangzhu culture) to Han times. Inthe absence of any documents explaining the meaning of these “demonic”images it is impossible to link them to any specific mythical figures, butit seems likely that they represented an exorcist-priest wearing a maskor headdress in order to commune with the spirits.30The associationsbetween the Queen Mother of the land of the setting sun, “who knowsneither birth nor death,” and the demonic imagery found in the Classicof the Mountains and Seaspoint toward a conception of her as a fear-some deity of death and perhaps, for a chosen few, immortal life.In the late Han period, tomb murals typically depict the QueenMother in regal pose flanked by her court (figure 9). By this time the older,demonic form of the Queen Mother had receded behind a refurbishedimage of her as a potent deity controlling the forces of nature. The idea58The Han Cult of the Dead"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"that the Queen Mother was a divine counterpart of the earthly monarchwho, in contrast to the severe gods of heaven and the netherworld, suc-cored her mortal children permeated all levels of Han society. The per-vasive belief in the benevolence of the Queen Mother was demonstratedmost strikingly by the mass movement that erupted during the terribledrought of 3 b.c.e.Thousands of people thronged the roads to the cap-ital bearing wands of straw and hemp representing the Queen Mother’s“edict,” presumably an order directing the emperor and his ministersto take action to bring relief to the people. Apart from her ubiquitouspresence in mortuary cults, though, the Queen Mother was refractedinto a variety of different forms at the regional and local level. Repre-sentations of the Queen Mother as a regal deity and avatar of cosmicyin—necessitating the invention of her binary opposite, the King Fatherof the East (Dongfangjun), as an icon of yangforces—were most preva-lent in Shandong (figures 10 and 11). In the west, in Sichuan, the QueenMother appeared as a more immediate and concretely maternal bene-factress who granted boons to her mortal supplicants and protected themfrom harm.31Cast-bronze “money trees” depicting the Queen Motherand her immortal companions among branches full of glowing coins werea conspicuous feature of Han tombs in Sichuan. While the money treesderived primarily from the sun-tree lore associated with the paradise ofimmortals, the coins link this vision of paradise to the material bountyof the mundane world.32The Queen Mother was the first in a series ofbenevolent goddesses who attracted a great popular following, thoughin later times she was almost entirely eclipsed by the Buddhist goddessof mercy, Guanyin.Figures like the Queen Mother of the West, the Lord of Mount Tai,and to some extent Huangdi were directly modeled on terrestrial mon-archs, yet they remained transcendent gods. In contrast, most of the godsof Han religion were portrayed as once having been ordinary mortals.Because of their extraordinary accomplishments in life, or the circum-stances of their death, these persons acquired numinous powers in theafterlife. In elite religion such deified mortals were incorporated into abureaucracy of gods, each with its own proper sphere of jurisdiction. Onesuch codification of the divine can be found in the Treatises of Huainanof the second century b.c.e.: “The Fiery Thearch [Yandi] invented theuse of fire; upon his death, he became the God of the Hearth [Zao].

Fewdetails are known about vernacular religious cults current in Han times,but the limited evidence at our disposal suggests that most gods were be-lieved to be the apotheosized spirits of dead mortals. Though worshipof the gods differed in substantial ways from the cult of ancestors, bothexemplified the centrality of the dead in the imagination of the living.Worship of spirits of the dead other than one’s own ancestors evokedharsh criticism from officials and members of the Confucian-educatedelite, however. Such cults exceeded the bounds of ritual propriety andperforce were branded as “profane” (yinci)and outlawed. But given thelimited means available to police popular piety, state sanctions generallyhad negligible impact.One of the most vibrant cults of the late Han centered on a prince ofthe imperial house and grandson of the founder of the Han dynastynamed Liu Zhang, posthumously entitled Prince Jing of Chengyang(Chengyang Jing wang). Liu earned fame for his forthright oppositionto the usurper Empress Lü and became a hero for his role in suppress-ing an attempted coup d’état by the Lü clan after the empress’s death in180 b.c.e.Two years later, while still in his twenties, Liu suddenly died.35A shrine dedicated to Liu was erected at Chengyang (in modern Shan-dong) to commemorate his meritorious actions on behalf of the Han dy-nasty.36Though modest in scale, this shrine apparently galvanized fer-vent popular worship. According to Ying Shao, writing at the close ofthe second century c.e., “from Langye and the six commanderies of Qing-zhou to Bohai [an area encompassing all of modern Shandong], everygovernment seat, every township and canton, and every village raisedshrines in honor of Prince Jing.”37Another contemporary claimed thatno fewer than six hundred shrines devoted to Prince Jing had proliferatedthroughout this region. Popular festivals affirmed the god’s dignity.Merchants dressed images of the god in the official regalia of a “two-thousand-bushel minister” (referring to Liu Zhang’s stipend, whichplaced him in the highest rank of Han officialdom). The images were thenparaded through the streets in five carriages to the accompaniment offeasting, music, and theatrical performances lasting for days. Around the62The Han Cult of the Dead"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"end of the second century c.e., the governor of the region, the famouspoet-general Cao Cao (155–220), ruthlessly suppressed the cult, but wor-ship of Prince Jing apparently revived after Cao’s departure.38Another historical personage who became a popular cult figure afterhis death was Jiang Ziwen, bailiff of Moling (modern Nanjing), who diedof wounds suffered while fighting bandits. In life Jiang was a venal andarrogant tyrant. Local legend records that after his death Jiang’s spiritdemanded that the people of Nanjing honor him as the tutelary deity(tudi)of the area. Rebuffed, Jiang punished the faithless populace witha plague to compel their allegiance. Sun Quan, who made Nanjing thecapital of his Wu kingdom (222–80), likewise was bullied into erectinga shrine devoted to Jiang, who reportedly caused a great fire that de-stroyed much of Sun’s palace. Sun conferred on Jiang the posthumoustitle of hou,or “sire,” and his temple at Bell Mountain (Zhong Shan)outside Nanjing became one of the great pilgrimage sites of the age.39The founder of the Liu Song dynasty (420–79) singled out Jiang’s tem-ple as the chief target of his campaign to eradicate deviant popular cults,but a subsequent Song emperor rehabilitated Jiang and awarded him ad-ditional honors, including promotion within the official pantheon to therank of king (wang).40Among other historical figures widely revered asgods were Wu Zixu, a noble of the sixth century b.c.e.whose heroic ef-forts to avenge the deaths of his father and brother at the hands of theevil King of Chu transformed him into the supreme paragon of filial piety,and Xiang Yu, chief rival to the founder of the Han dynasty, who waswidely celebrated in popular legend and song as a tragic hero.41The common motif linking all of these popular gods was their statureas heroic warriors who met a premature, and usually violent, death. Inthis respect they resembled vengeful ghosts, whose life force, not yet ex-hausted, remained a palpable presence in the mortal world. Some of thesespirits, like the ghost of Jiang Ziwen, were perceived as rapacioustyrants, while others were heralded as bulwarks of the established order,invested with rank and authority as supernatural arms of the bureau-cratic state. Though the titles and honors showered upon such figuresenhanced their dignity in the eyes of the people, it was not their bu-reaucratic office but the popular belief in the supernatural powerswielded by heroic victims of violence that made them into gods. More-over, the cults of dead warriors proliferated among the populace with-out any sanction or control by state authorities, much to the consterna-tion of the latter. Witness the contempt vented by Lu Xiujing (406–77),The Han Cult of the Dead63"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"a Daoist cleric waging a zealous campaign against the corruption of or-thodox religion by popular beliefs, in his lurid description of popularworship during the late Han period:The stale vapors of the Six Heavens42[Liutian Xieqi] took on official titlesand appellations and brought together the hundred sprites and the demonsof the five kinds of wounding [wubing zhi gui],43dead generals of defeatedarmies, and dead troops of scattered armies. The men called themselves“General” and the women called themselves “Lady.” They led demontroops, marching as armies and camping as legions, roving over heavenand earth. They arrogated to themselves authority and the power to dis-pense blessings. They took over the people’s temples and sought theirsacrificial offerings, thus upsetting the people, who killed the three kindsof sacrificial animals [ox, sheep, and pig], used up all their prospects, castaway all their goods, and exhausted their produce. They were not blessedwith good fortune, but rather received disaster. Those who died unjustlyor early and violently could not be counted.44Despite its fulsome invective, Lu’s diatribe yields valuable insights intoconceptions of the divine in Han times and his own day. Vernacular re-ligion was replete with violence and combat, demons and renegade gods,the powerful and malefic spirits of dead mortals. Violence of course hadits place in the bureaucratic order of official religion, whose godsunflinchingly applied corporal punishment to evildoers. Yet in official re-ligion penal sanctions required imperial warrant; none dared take thelaw into one’s own hands, and the supreme deity—in the various per-sonae of the Celestial Thearch, Huangdi, or the Lord of Mount Tai—alone had the authority to sanction the use of violence. This image of therighteous supreme deity also offered solace to the populace at large. TheHan ordinances for the dead disclose both a pervasive fear of renegadeghosts and demons and also an abiding hope that the divine bureaucracywill preserve order among the unruly legions of the dead.Such, then, was the religious universe that gave birth to the Daoist re-ligion in the second century c.e.45The Daoist religion traces its originsto a sectarian movement that claimed a divine mandate from a supremedeity, known as Lord Lao (Laojun), to found a community devoted tothe pure religion called the Way of the Celestial Masters (Tianshidao).46When the Han dynasty, riven by factional conflict within and withoutthe palace, began to crumble in the late second century, the Celestial Mas-ters created their own utopian “parishes” in rugged mountainous areasof western China. The founders of the Daoist religion deplored popularidolatry of “aberrant” gods, the ghosts and demons Lu Xiujing dubbed64The Han Cult of the Dead"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"“the stale vapors of the Six Heavens,” but sympathized with the fears ofdeath and the dead that permeated all levels of Han society. The earlyDaoist movements were also strongly tinged by the profound sense ofsin and guilt manifested in the ordinances for the dead. In constructingtheir pure religion of Lord Lao, the Celestial Masters embraced the prin-ciples of bureaucratic authority that framed both Han social life and con-ceptions of the underworld. In contrast to the heterogeneous local cultsof Han religion, though, the Celestial Masters established a formal, sys-tematic pantheon of the divine. The Celestial Masters also undertook adetermined effort to eradicate the countless “perverse” and “deviant”forms of contemporary religious worship. Members of the sect were pro-hibited from engaging in divination, consulting almanacs of taboo daysand activities, or performing “blood sacrifices” (xueshi,that is, offeringsof sacrificial animals to the gods). The sect also forbade any resort to themedical arts to cure illness. To protect their flock against such “super-stitions,” the Celestial Masters sought to sever themselves from the sec-ular world by investing both sacred and temporal authority in their ownhereditary priesthood.Yet, in spite of its wholesale repudiation of much of current religiouspractice, the religion of the Celestial Masters incorporated many ver-nacular beliefs into its own distinct doctrinal, liturgical, and institutionalframework.47The Celestial Masters did not deny the existence of the spir-its of the dead; instead, they subjected them to heavenly authority. Ce-lestial Masters’ doctrine transformed the lawless ghosts and demons ofprofane religion into the subservient foot soldiers of celestial officers,without any diminution of their terrifying aspect. The Celestial Mastersfirmly proscribed worship of the dead, an injunction that implicitly en-compassed virtually all vernacular gods. Daoist ritual codes, such as theone from which the above passage by Lu Xiujing is excerpted, delineatednot only an official register of sacrifices, but also a hierarchy of cults,one that largely replicated the orthodoxy stipulated by Confucian ritualcanons. Laypersons were permitted to worship only the soil and hearthgods, and to offer sacrifices to their ancestors five times a year.48Although the Celestial Masters refused to condone prevailing formsof worship, they nonetheless addressed the main religious concerns be-setting Chinese of the late Han period and after: the expiation of sin andprotection against demonic attack. According to the Celestial Masters’doctrine, human conduct was under constant surveillance by a divine bu-reaucracy known as the Three Offices (Sanguan) of heaven, earth, andwater, which maintained meticulous records of the sins committed byThe Han Cult of the Dead65"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"mortals. The priesthood of the Celestial Masters acted as the terrestrialambassadors of this heavenly bureaucracy. Lay members of the sect couldobtain absolution of their sins through confession mediated by a priest,who communicated with the celestial gods through written petitions(composed, like the ordinances for the dead, in formulaic language im-itating the Han government’s bureaucratic correspondence). In one pen-itential ritual, sinners demonstrated remorse by smearing their bodieswith mud and charcoal and reciting their sins with their hands boundbehind their back.49Although lay believers were required to submit aregular tithe to the priesthood (which gave rise to the sect’s popular name,the “Five Pecks of Rice Teaching” [Wudoumi jiao]), sacrificial offeringsto the gods were strictly forbidden. Deliverance from sin and infernalpunishment depended on penance and contrition, not purchase of thegods’ indulgence. It also seems likely that the Celestial Masters offeredtheir adherents not only absolution from divine punishment but even theprospect of induction into the ranks of celestial officers, through post-mortem appointment to the heavenly bureaucracy.50The Celestial Masters also shared contemporary assumptions that as-cribed illness and misfortune to demonic attack by the spirits of the dead.Ghosts, especially the shades of ancestors, were seen as the primary agentsof demonic affliction. As we can see from the ordinances for the dead,spirits of the dead who harbored grievances against the living could ap-peal to the underworld bureaucracy for satisfaction. If the complaint wasdeemed valid, the culprit was subjected to appropriate punishment in theform of a curse. These “writs of grievance from the grave” (zhongsong)were typically directed against unfilial descendants. Also, ancestors con-demned to infernal punishment might request that some portion of theirsentence be transferred to their descendants (a possibility that, as the ordi-nances for the dead reveal, greatly worried the latter). Daoist priests oftenwere sought out to protect the living against these “sepulchral suits.”Armed with the necessary ritual paraphernalia to communicate with thedivine (registers of the gods, petitions, and seals of office), the priest con-ducted an investigation to determine the source of the affliction and thenenlisted the aid of the gods to dispel the curse. Sample petitions in Daoistliturgical texts contain lists of underworld officials that closely parallelthe litanies of gods and spirits found in the ordinances for the dead, sug-gesting that in constructing their own models of the divine bureaucracythe Daoists borrowed heavily from their predecessors among Han spiritmediums.51The total collapse of the Han dynasty at the turn of the third century66The Han Cult of the Dead"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"ushered in a protracted period of political disunity and social turmoil.None of the contenders for the mantle of imperial rule succeeded in restor-ing a unified empire, nor could they mount an effective defense againstthe steppe nomads encroaching upon China’s northern frontier. In 317,after north China was overrun by marauding nomad invaders, the reign-ing emperor of the Jin dynasty (280–420) reconstituted his court at anew capital in the lower Yangzi valley at the site of modern Nanjing. TheEra of Disunion, during which China was sundered among weak Chi-nese dynasties in the south and a kaleidoscope of regimes set up by for-eign conquerors in the north, lasted until the end of the sixth century.The channels of movement and communication opened between Chinaand central and western Asia during this age accelerated the diffusion ofthe Buddhist religion throughout China. A vanguard of Buddhist evan-gelists had first reached China at the close of the first century c.e., butBuddhist beliefs and monastic institutions became entrenched on Chi-nese soil only after they gained the patronage of the aristocracies in boththe north and south starting in the fourth century.The complex history of the introduction and spread of Buddhism inChina cannot be recounted here, but certainly the prime appeal of Bud-dhism to the Chinese lay in its doctrines of salvation.52In its pristineform Buddhism abjured the whole of the phenomenal world and soughtto transcend the inevitable miseries incited by human desires throughextinction of the self (nirvàna),attainable only through arduous regi-mens of austerity and self-discipline. But the Mahàyàna tradition of Bud-dhism that gained ascendancy in China promised salvation from the tor-ment of continual rebirth in the world of suffering not just to a few, butto all. Mahàyàna Buddhism derided the clerical establishment’s emphasison the monastic vocation as the only path to salvation. Instead, Mahày-àna held out the possibility of salvation through the intercession of al-truistic enlightened beings, known as bodhisattvas, and the eternal Bud-dha, who promise to come to the aid of devout believers. One of thechief innovations found in Mahàyàna doctrine is its pantheon of com-passionate buddhas and bodhisattvas who preside over heavenly para-dises and actively assist the faithful in their quest for salvation. Amongthese celestial saviors are Amitàbha, buddha of the western (“PureLand”) paradise; Maitreya, the earliest cult bodhisattva and the futurebuddha of the Tuãita Heaven, a land of inexhaustible bounty; MañjuMrí,the bodhisattva of wisdom and eloquence; and AvalokiteMvara (bestknown by the Chinese name Guanyin), the omnipresent bodhisattva ofcompassion who responds to the heartfelt appeals of pious believers,The Han Cult of the Dead67"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"rescuing them from immediate peril and bestowing boons in answer totheir prayers.Buddhist soteriology centered on the concept of karma, or the accu-mulated residue of human action and intention. Buddhists believed thatthe moral balance of good and evil deeds generated through the opera-tion of karma determined the nature of the individual’s next rebirthwithin the five classes of sentient beings (pañca-gati):deity, human, beast,“hungry ghost,” and denizen of hell. The Buddhist adept sought to achievean enlightened state in which karma ceased to be produced, thereby free-ing the self from the cycle of continual rebirth and enabling one to at-tain nirvana. Buddhist concepts of karma and infernal punishment thusresonated with indigenous Chinese ideas about life and death. Althoughkarmic retribution was quickly grafted onto indigenous belief in post-mortem punishment, in the process the doctrine of karma underwent sub-stantial modification. In Buddhism, karmic destiny was determinedsolely by the actions of the individual. In China, karmic destiny, and es-pecially retribution for sin, was seen as shared by the family (living anddead) as a whole. Fate was collective, not individual: the living inheritedthe burden of the accumulated sins of the ancestors, while the wickeddeeds of the living were likewise projected onto dead ancestors. The doc-trine of the transmigration of souls through cycles of rebirth of coursewas wholly new to the Chinese. The Buddhist notion of reincarnation,which simultaneously denied the continuity of the self/ego and insistedthat salvation was purely individual, never became fully reconciled withthe Chinese ancestral cult. Belief in rebirth did infuse Chinese religiousconsciousness, but the Chinese tended to transfer karmic retribution tothe realm of the dead.In Indian Buddhism, the laws of karma operate automatically, with-out mediation by any divine powers or gods. The individual’s actionsspontaneously generated the causes and conditions that would “bearfruit,” to use a favorite Buddhist metaphor, in the person’s future pathof rebirth. Yama, the Buddhist lord of the underworld, had been no morethan a passive instrument of the autonomous laws of karma, powerlessto alter an individual’s fate. In Chinese religion, though, karmic meritand sin were subsumed into the operations of the underworld bureau-cracy and its vast apparatus of surveillance, record keeping, and judicialreview. Interposition of the many-layered Chinese pantheon of bureau-cratic gods and their hordes of supernumeraries compromised the in-eluctable workings of karma and opened up possibilities for manipula-tion of karmic destiny. The Indian notion of the underworld as a68The Han Cult of the Dead"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"sprawling charnel house of horrors replete with every imaginable formof physical torture had no precedent in Chinese religion. But whereasBuddhists viewed hell and its afflictions as one of the five karmic des-tinies (pañca-gati),Chinese continued to see the underworld as a realmof death, not rebirth. The troubling prospect of parents and ancestorssubjected to brutal, unremitting torture in the dungeons of death read-ily galvanized Chinese to undertake merit-earning actions on behalf oftheir deceased family members. Pursuit of salvation, like karmic destiny,was conceived as a collective enterprise rather than a solitary religiouspractice.The soteriological goal of nirvana remained unfathomable to mostChinese, who were firmly wedded to materialist conceptions of the self.Nirvana was reconceived as deliverance from mortal cares; the vacuousannihilation of the self implied by the Indian term gave way to a questfor rebirth in a paradise of celestial splendor akin to the fantastic islesof the immortals. In Daoist religion, the ascent to paradise was depictednot as a reincarnation or transmigration of the soul but rather as the trans-mutation of the person’s purified body to a realm beyond death.53Bud-dhist teachings never succeeded in dislodging Chinese belief in the es-sential unity of body and self. On the contrary, the reorientation ofChinese Buddhism away from the extinction of the self encapsulated bythe doctrine of nirvana and toward rebirth in a heavenly paradisedemonstrated the powerful pull Chinese religious concerns exerted onBuddhist doctrines. Similarly, the belief that individuals could earn meriton behalf of one’s parents and ancestors, one of the many accommoda-tions Buddhist monks made to Chinese values, repudiated fundamentalBuddhist ideas of the self and karma (though it perhaps derived a tenu-ous theological justification from the Mahàyàna doctrine that the bod-hisattvas could transfer some of their store of karmic merit to the unen-lightened but pious faithful to help them attain salvation).The interaction of Buddhism with Chinese culture was rendered evenmore complex by the emergence of new currents within native Chinesereligion. Following the flight of the refugee Chinese court to the envi-rons of modern Nanjing, two new Daoist traditions—inspired by theteachings of the Celestial Masters but also rooted in southern traditionsof occult arts—emerged during the second half of the fourth century.

In other respects, though, the two new Daoist traditions di-verged sharply in doctrine and religious practice.The Shangqing teachings revealed to a young visionary named YangXi between 364 and 370 instantly became the property of Yang’s patrons,a powerful aristocratic family named Xu.54Yang Xi served as spiritualintercessor for the Xu family; he was one of a number of religious spe-cialists engaged by the Xus who practiced a variety of occult arts origi-nating both from southern local traditions and the Celestial Masterpriesthood.55After the Daoist parishes in western China disintegratedduring the course of the civil wars of the third century, the priests of theWay of the Celestial Masters became unmoored from their sectarian com-munities and drifted among the ranks of secular society. Like the fang-shithey once disdained, many priests began to offer their services as mas-ters of mantic arts to private patrons. Thus, following the fall of the Handynasty the priesthood of the Way of the Celestial Masters underwent atransformation, as Peter Nickerson aptly puts it, from leaders of a sectto members of a guild. No longer ordained priests ministering to a sec-tarian congregation, these “officers of the Way” (daoshi)were forced tocompete with the gods and spirit mediums of “vulgar” religion for pop-ular allegiance. Consequently, many priests added formerly proscribedpractices like divination and spirit possession to their liturgical repertoirewhile still asserting their unique access to the true gods.56Priests of theCelestial Masters tradition did succeed in acquiring a clientele amongthe court aristocracy at Nanjing, including the Xu family, whose mem-bers were initiated into the sect. But Yang Xi claimed a higher spiritualauthority than the gods of the Celestial Masters.Shangqing religion centered on the goal of ascent to the paradise ofthe immortals without passage through death. Yang Xi spoke of a moreexalted class of immortals known as the perfected (zhenren)who dwelledamong the stars. The religious practice prescribed by Yang Xi chiefly fo-cused on using techniques of meditation to purify the body and therebyescape the inevitable decay of mortal flesh. In contrast to the CelestialMasters sect, Shangqing religion remained a resolutely individual formof piety in which neither priests nor collective worship had any significantrole. The Shangqing precepts and techniques of individual spiritual dis-cipline transmitted through sacred scriptures were clearly intended for aselect audience of aristocrats; no act was more harshly proscribed thandivulging these scriptures to someone deemed unworthy to receive70The Han Cult of the Dead"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"them.57The Shangqing adept sought to join the company of the perfectedthrough a regimen of meditation and visualization of astral deities, butthe gods themselves remained transcendent beings aloof from the mun-dane world. Though ritual purity was a fundamental requirement of Shang-qing practice, the obsession with sin, demonic affliction, and exorcism thatso strongly colored the religion of the Celestial Masters was wholly ab-sent from Shangqing religion, at least in its formative stages.58Also, incontrast to the rival Lingbao movement, Shangqing Daoism borrowed lit-tle directly from Buddhism, even though the images of the demonic thatappear in Shangqing teachings—embodiments of sensual vices who try todistract adepts and prevent them from achieving transcendence—displaystriking parallels with Buddhist ideas.The Lingbao scriptures were compiled circa 397–402 by Ge Chaofu,a scion of the southern aristocracy, as a direct challenge to the religiousauthority claimed by the Xus, whose Shangqing religion had gained somecurrency among elite circles in the Nanjing area.59Lingbao religion bor-rowed heavily from Buddhist doctrines, and even more so from the evan-gelical methods of the Buddhist clergy. Ge adapted the literary tropes ofBuddhist sÜtras,sacred texts purported to be sermons spoken by the his-torical Buddha Tàkyamuni, to produce a voluminous body of scripturesrecording the preaching of the Primordial Celestial Worthy (Yuanshitianzun), a new supreme deity cast in the likeness of the timeless and uni-versal buddhas of Mahàyàna theology. In contrast to the esoteric reli-gious practice of Shangqing, which was devoted to the salvation of theindividual adept and his family, the Lingbao tradition fully embraced theMahàyàna ideals of compassion and universal salvation. It spurned cul-tivation of the physical body through therapeutic regimens, alchemy, andmeditation and instead propagated liturgies of collective salvation basedon ritual performance, prayer, abstention from sinful acts, and above allrecitation of holy scriptures (all of which betrayed Buddhist influence).The prime text of Lingbao Daoism, the Scripture for Universal Salvation(Duren jing),contained the secret language (rendered in psuedo-Sanskrittranscriptions) that could be used by the adept to invoke the aid of gods,demon-kings, and spirit warriors, as well as formulas for collective sal-vation borrowed from Buddhist writings.60Sacred texts like the Scrip-ture for Universal Salvation also possessed miraculous powers that in-hered in the book as a physical object. Recitation of the text not onlysummoned divine guardians, but it also enabled the blind to see, the lameto walk, and barren women to conceive.61Like the Way of Celestial Masters—but in contrast to ShangqingThe Han Cult of the Dead71"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"religion—Lingbao Daoism interposed the priesthood as mediators be-tween the sacred and mundane worlds. Priests and other initiates alonepossessed the esoteric formulas necessary to invoke divine aid. Yet Ling-bao rituals (such as the Yellow Register Retreats [Huanglu zhai] performedon behalf of the dead) provided ordinary laypersons a more accessiblemeans of gaining deliverance from postmortem suffering than the aus-tere religious discipline demanded by Shangqing Daoism and contem-porary Buddhism. In addition, brief morality tales (clearly imitating para-bles of the life of the Buddha) were often inserted into Lingbao scripturesas concise and readily understandable illustrations of the workings ofkarmic retribution.62The accessibility of Lingbao teachings and liturgyearned them a prominent place in vernacular religious culture through-out later Chinese history.The Daoist traditions also borrowed from Buddhism a new languageof the demonic, though the Daoist concept of evil remained largely un-altered. Màra, the personification of evil in Buddhism, usually appearedin sÜtrasas the personification of ignorance, temptation, and death. Mostcommonly, Màra connoted the evil intent lurking in human hearts thatobscures truth and hinders enlightenment. But in some cases Màra wasportrayed anthropomorphically as lord of the Lower Six Heavens of Bud-dhist cosmology, the realms of sensual desire and the four lower pathsof rebirth. The ready correspondence between the Lower Six Heavens ofBuddhism and the decadent Six Heavens of Daoist lore facilitated adop-tion of Màra as the embodiment of selfish desire. Màra achieved partic-ular renown in Chinese Buddhism as the satanic adversary of Tàkyamuni,who ultimately foiled Màra’s utmost efforts to thwart his entry into nir-vana. It is in this guise, as a tempter who tests the spiritual resolve of theDaoist votary, that Màra appears in Shangqing and Lingbao scriptures.But Màra was also assimilated into the bureaucratic conception of thedivine and cast as a fearsome deity who punishes sinful mortals. In thisrole Màra was depicted, like Chiyou in Han religion, as a vanquisheddemon who becomes a righteous avenger, marshaling the terrifying le-gions of justice against the forces of evil. In the Lingbao tradition, demonsthemselves became the objects of salvation. The “demon (Màra)–kings”(mowang)that appear in the Scripture for Universal Salvationresolvedinto two distinct types: stern judges who decide the fate of the dead andtempters who test the mettle of adepts seeking transcendence. Thus thesedemon-kings embodied both good and evil, or—in terms more recog-nizable to Chinese—order and chaos.63The profound abhorrence of the grave and ghosts that pervaded Han72The Han Cult of the Dead"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"religion continued unabated throughout the Era of Disunion and foundnew expression in the apocalyptic Daoist cults that arose in the fifth cen-tury. Fascination with ghosts was a basic trope of the “annals of thestrange” (zhiguai)literature that proliferated during this period. Thoughwritten in a narrative mode often misconstrued as fiction, the “annals ofthe strange” claimed to be authentic accounts of interactions betweenhuman beings and the hidden world of darkness (xuan)beyond mortalken.64Much of this literature consists of polemics intended as proofs ofthe validity of Confucian, Daoist, or Buddhist teachings, yet at the sametime these stories are suffused by a common religious ethos reflecting con-servative moral values. They depict the indissoluble correspondences link-ing the mortal world to the unseen realm and the logic of moral actionthat governs this relationship. As Robert Campany observes, the zhiguailiterature sought to reconcile apparently anomalous disturbances of theorder of nature with inexorable moral laws that govern both the phe-nomenal world of human perception and the unseen realm of spirits andthe dead. Though this moral order was typically expressed in the Bud-dhist idiom of karma, the notions of reciprocity, cosmic resonance, andmoral equilibrium that underlay its ethic of retribution can be traced toindigenous, Han-era sources.65Among the most common figures in the “annals of the strange” genreare revenants, ghosts who return from the underworld to report on theterrors that await heedless mortals. Many stories feature ill-fated en-counters with ghosts disguised as living persons. Often these ghosts arepathetic souls, caught in a liminal zone between the living and the dead,who seek the aid of mortals to make a successful transition to the after-life, for example by providing the corpse of the deceased with a properburial or sacrificial offerings.66The theme of these stories is abandon-ment, and the sites of these encounters often turn out to be disturbedtombs or neglected graves hidden by weeds. Another motif involves tombguardian effigies that become animated by bodiless life forces and escapethe grave, causing havoc among mortals.67Although many of these sto-ries underscore the reciprocal bonds of sympathy that link the living andthe dead, virtually all of them also mark the grave and ghosts as, at thevery least, passively dangerous. Contact with the spirits of the dead, re-gardless of their intentions, posed a dire threat to the vitality of livinghuman beings.In contrast to the “annals of the strange,” in which wandering ghostsare likely to seek out blameless mortals, Daoist religion placed the onusfor demonic affliction squarely on the victim. In the fifth century, a va-The Han Cult of the Dead73"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"riety of Daoist (and also Buddhist) messianic movements sprang up thatportrayed the legions of malevolent beings abroad in the world as sinis-ter omens of an approaching cataclysm. Once these demons cleanse theworld of evil, a messiah would appear to restore a paradise of plenty inwhich the pious will abide in peace. The messianic movements attrib-uted the calamities besetting China, especially the ravages of war andepidemic, to the work of demon-kings (literally, “Màra-kings,” mowang)and their henchmen. According to the Scripture of the Divine Incanta-tions of the Grotto-Abyss,a widely disseminated apocalyptic tract dat-ing from this time, the demon-kings are spirits of dead sinners who pro-liferate uncontrollably in times of moral decay. In their ignorance andconfusion, the masses are led astray onto the path of perdition: they seeksolace by worshiping profane gods, and they compound their heresy bymaking offerings of bloody sacrifices to them. The appearance of Mes-siah Li, an incarnation of Lord Lao of the Celestial Masters, will inau-gurate a great cataclysm that will destroy these sinners, and only the de-vout faithful, the “elect” (zhongmin),will survive and enjoy the era ofGreat Peace under the rule of the messiah.68(The term zhongminliter-ally means “the seed people,” in reference to their role in repopulatingthe earth after the apocalypse.)69Although the Scripture of Divine Incantationsunleashed a polemicalrant against the moral torpor resulting from the penetration of Buddhisminto Chinese culture, the text borrowed heavily from both the formal el-ements of Buddhist scriptures and the Buddhist eschatology of under-world torments and paths of reincarnation. The liturgical practices ad-vocated in this work, including recitation of sacred books, charity,communal retreats, and funerary rites, were also inspired by Buddhism.Yet the theology of the Scripture of Divine Incantationsultimately de-rived from the Way of the Celestial Masters. Evil forces at work in theworld were ascribed to the proliferation of “demonic cults” (guidao)inwhich charlatan spirit mediums extract from the naive masses offeringsof blood sacrifices for the spirits of the dead. Only through initiation intothe community of the elect could mortals escape the coming apocalypse.70Like the Lingbao revelations, the Scripture of Divine Incantationsde-scribes a world overrun by hordes of “demon (Màra)–kings” whospread pestilence and misery among humankind. In their mortal lives,these demon-kings were renowned generals and warriors; in death, theybecame (as the vernacular religion of the time fully attests) the objectsof profane cults. The first chapter of the text inveighs against “souls ofthe dead” who “falsely claim to be great gods, receiving worship from74The Han Cult of the Dead"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"temple wardens at profane shrines hidden in the hills and forests. Thesedead generals of vanquished armies who have eluded registration amongthe dead and instead come to the aid of evil kings, spreading disease andaffliction among mortals while refusing to comply with the Great Law,will be seized and beheaded by the executioner-spirits of the ten direc-tions.”71Yet the same text also describes the demon-kings as rehabili-tated evil spirits who submitted to the authority of the Daoist priesthoodand were appointed military officers in command of the legions of “pettydemons” (xiagui). Dread punishment awaited the demon-kings who failto restrain their underlings and allow them to run amok, but those whoheed commands, assist in the propagation of true religion, and bring re-lief to the people will be rewarded with promotion to high rank withinthe celestial pantheon.72Still, even these righteous demon-kings bring suf-fering and pain to humanity, for it is they who serve as the arms of vin-dictive justice, punishing evildoers by afflicting them with disease andmisfortune.Though the demon-kings and their minions portrayed in the Scrip-ture of Divine Incantations and similar texts are tightly yoked to bu-reaucratic authority, their origins as spirits of the dead remain fully trans-parent. Like other Daoists (and some Buddhists), the leaders of thesemessianic movements sought to co-opt vernacular cults by convertingtheir gods to true religion. The demon-kings of the Scripture of DivineIncantations in some cases were identified as actual historical persons,almost always heroic, martial figures who probably had become the ob-jects of popular worship deemed heterodox by the Daoist priesthood.73Once profane spirits who extorted blood sacrifices from the people, theywere now assimilated into the Daoist celestial hierarchy as the stormtroopers of the gods. The Declarations of the Perfected (Zhen gao),thecorpus of Shangqing revelations assembled by the great Buddho-Daoistsyncretist Tao Hongjing (456–536), likewise contains lengthy lists of mi-nor divinities—spirits of those who suffered violent deaths—who hadsubmitted to celestial authority and received appointments within thelower echelons of the supernatural bureaucracy.74The Han cult of the dead played an important role in shaping Daoistand Buddhist ideas of the relationship between the living and the dead,yet at the same time indigenous conceptions of the afterlife themselvesunderwent profound change. The fear of the dead and their supernatu-ral powers that so strongly marked Chinese religion of the Warring Statesand Han eras was increasingly supplanted by sympathy for one’s deceasedancestors and the tribulations they endured in the afterlife. The deifiedThe Han Cult of the Dead75"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"ancestors of the Shang kings and nobles had long since faded away.Mighty warriors and men of rank retained in death the intimidatingpower they wielded in life, but the vast majority faced the grim prospectof penal sentences in the dungeons of the underworld. As fears of the“curse of the ancestors” abated, the concerns of the living shifted to res-cuing the ancestors from their infernal torments, succoring them, andaiding their quest for transcendence and salvation. Moreover, in Bud-dhist soteriology, and in Lingbao Daoism as well, the sharp distinctionbetween ancestors and ghosts (the immanent spirits of those with whomone has no kin relationship) became blurred. Both Buddhism and Ling-bao Daoism championed an ethic of universal salvation, and their ritualpractices were dedicated to the salvation of all beings regardless of kin-ship ties. Of course, we must not overstate the extent to which the an-cestors dissolved into an undifferentiated mass of pathetic souls. Muchof lay Buddhism centered on earning merit expressly for one’s ancestorsrather than the unshriven dead at large. Nonetheless, religious movementsof the Era of Disunion tended to efface the boundary between the an-cestors and the ghosts of strangers, instead demarcating between the pi-ous faithful and abject sinners. This tendency was most apparent in themessianic cults, which divorced the spirits of the dead from their famil-ial context as ancestors and instead merged them together as objects ofsympathy and salvation.Ancestors and ghosts, while retaining their distinctive features withineach religious tradition, thus increasingly converged into a common im-age of pitiful sinners subject to postmortem judgment and punishment.Buddhist and Daoist concepts of godhood, however, remained starklydifferent. Chinese Buddhism was dominated by the cults of celestial di-vinities dedicated to the salvation of all sentient beings. The most pop-ular deity of all was Guanyin, the ubiquitous bodhisattva of compassion,who assumed a wide array of human incarnations in order to propagateBuddhist teachings to those yearning for deliverance and salvation.75Thecelestial deities of Shangqing Daoism, in contrast, were remote, tran-scendent beings accessible only through possession of sacred books andperformance of an austere religious regimen. The Daoist gods exemplifiedthe normative moral order of the cosmos, which was governed by a sim-ulacrum of the imperial bureaucracy. But within vernacular religion—the profane religion scorned by the elevated ranks of the Daoist clergy—fervent belief in the power of death to transform the souls of powerfulmortals, especially those who live and die by violence, into gods and de-mon spirits remained undiminished. In the minds of the populace, the76The Han Cult of the Dead"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"divine world did not divide neatly into the counterposed forces of goodand evil.

Theenlightened monarch, anointed by Heaven, used his authority to fash-ion a world of symmetry, regularity, and tranquility. But this ideal statewas perpetually besieged by the entropic forces of disorder. Anomaly anddeviation posed grave challenges to a civilization predicated on defer-ence and hierarchy. Not surprisingly, then, the Zhou portrayed the sage-kings above all as civilizers triumphant over the wilderness landscape andits denizens. Political philosophers of the Warring States era viewed bothbarbarian lands and mountain wildernesses within the royal domain asterra incognita,and hence beyond the reach of the monarch’s benigninfluence. At the same time they affirmed that the task of classifying andrecording strange flora and fauna, mountains and rivers, and gods andpeoples was an integral part of sage governance. Omniscience conferredpower over not only the mortal domain, but also the unseen realm ofgods, ghosts, and demons. By extension, writing served apotropaic pur-poses: the actualization of knowledge in the written word exposed thetrue nature of demonic entities and thereby rendered them impotent. Thisapotropaic function of writing was enhanced by the emergence of cor-relative cosmology, which assimilated all strange and uncanny phenom-ena to disruptions of the moral and political order.2From the perspec-tive of correlative cosmology, nothing in the cosmos was truly abnormal.Yet anomalies foreshadowed fissures in the organic unity of heaven andearth.The yin/yangand Five Phases cosmographies elaborated from thefourth century b.c.e.onward subsumed the vagaries and complexitiesof the immense natural world within regular and predictable patternsthat the human mind could apprehend, and thus control. Alongside thisburgeoning literature of cosmographic science we find a complementarybody of anomaly lore that sought to explain the appearance of human,animal, and natural prodigies in terms of disturbances in cosmic matterand energy that produced deviant life forms.

These myths ac-centuated the “panoptic gaze of the sage-ruler,” to use Robert Campany’sapt phrase: through tours of inspection and collection of tribute, the ruleracquired knowledge of the peoples and territories on the periphery ofhis realm and used it to fix them in their proper places within the orbitof imperial control.3Chief among these sage-kings was Yu the Great, re-putedly the founder of the pseudohistorical Xia dynasty, whose Herculeanlabors in channeling and draining the waters of the primeval Great Floodmade the earth fit for human habitation. An early tradition relates thatafter the founding of the Xia dynasty, the peoples of the “Nine Conti-nents” formed by the rivers Yu dug sent missions to pay tribute to theirbenefactor. Each mission also submitted pictures of the unusual flora andfauna of its homeland. Yu ordered that nine bronze cauldrons be cast“bearing images of the hundred strange beings. In this way people couldrecognize all spirits and evil influences, so that when they traveled overrivers and marshes and through mountains and forests, they would en-counter no adversity, and the specters of the mountains and waters4couldnot bother them.”5In ancient China, bronze cauldrons were regalia usedin rituals to propitiate the gods and ancestors, and thus embodied sov-ereign authority. Yu’s act of casting the nine cauldrons affirmed his do-minion over the entire world, including regions beyond his own ken, andall of its creatures. At the same time this passage also insinuates that for-eign lands were populated by malevolent spirits who assumed bizarrephysical forms: only through proper cognizance of these demons couldvisitors from the civilized world keep them at bay.Other myths depict Yu measuring the length and breadth of the world(which early Chinese cosmography conceived as square in shape), record-ing the products of each of the Nine Continents, and compelling theirinhabitants to submit tribute, a ritual gesture symbolizing their defer-ence to his supreme authority. By the Warring States era, Yu’s labors werealso celebrated for enabling the free flow of wealth and communication,which was deemed integral to the imperial project of creating a unitarycivilization.6Geographical knowledge thus had potent political uses. Theimportance of esoteric knowledge of distant lands is cogently revealedby the career of the fourth-century b.c.e.philosopher Zou Yan, who iscredited with developing the Five Phases cosmology into a highly influen-80Shanxiao:Mountain Goblins"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"tial philosophy of history. In essence, Zou Yan and his legions of imita-tors offered contemporary rulers the hope of duplicating the heraldedaccomplishments of the great monarchs of the past. Knowledge ofstrange places and creatures inaccessible to ordinary mortals entailed mas-tery over them, enabling the ruler to expand his dominion to all cornersof the world. Most importantly, the ability to penetrate the mystery en-folding aberrant phenomena and correctly deduce their portentoussignificance would guide the ruler in conforming his actions to the ever-changing norms of the cosmos. The historian Sima Qian’s brief biogra-phy of Zou Yan describes Zou’s political philosophy as grounded in claimsto omniscience spanning both time and space:[Zou] plumbed the reciprocal successions of yinand yangand compiledrecords of astonishing and aberrant phenomena in a tract of more than one hundred thousand words entitled A Complete History of the Succes-sion of the Great Sages [Zhongshi dasheng].His theories, based on obser-vation of petty phenomena from which he inferred universal principles,were extraordinary and unorthodox. Drawing upon the collective wisdomof learned men, Zou recapitulated the alternations of ages of prosperity anddecadence from the present day back to the time of Huangdi. But then Zouproceeded to derive from this history laws of felicity and misfortune that heapplied to the remote and unfathomable past as far back as the dim, darkages before the birth of heaven and earth.Zou began by classifying the notable mountains and great rivers ofChina;7the birds and beasts of its manifold valleys; the abundance of itswaters and soils; and its rare and precious products. But Zou went farther,extending his survey to lands beyond the seas and things men are unableto observe. He spoke of how the Five Powers [Wude, i.e., the Five Phases]have rotated in sequence since heaven and earth were first separated; howeach epoch had its ruling power; and how auspicious omens correspondedto each epoch. In Zou’s view, what orthodox scholars [ru]regarded asChina occupied only one of the eighty-one divisions of the world. To Chinahe gave the name Chixian Shenzhou [Divine Land of the Red Province],which encompassed nine regions, the so-called Nine Continents laid outby Yu the Great. In addition to China there were eight other territoriesequal to Chixian Shenzhou, which according to Zou are the true Nine Con-tinents. These Nine Continents are surrounded by an ocean severing theirinhabitants and creatures from the rest of the world. The Nine Continentsthus form a separate division. There are nine of these great divisions, en-circled by a vast ocean reaching to the point where heaven and earth arejoined together.Sima Qian’s synopsis bespoke his strong antipathy to Zou’s inductivemethod, which deduced patterns of historical change since earliest an-tiquity from events of the more recent past. Yet Sima also stressed thatShanxiao:Mountain Goblins81"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Zou’s philosophy ultimately rested on the conventional virtues of benev-olence and righteousness, moderation and austerity, and the hierarchi-cal principles defining ruler and subject, superior and inferior, and thesix grades of kinship; “it was only in their premises that Zou’s theorieswere preposterous,” he concluded.8But, as Sima ruefully admitted, rulersof the Warring States era eagerly sought Zou’s advice on how to trans-form themselves into supreme monarchs.The concrete political rewards of geographical knowledge inspiredprodigious efforts to map the world and its multitudinous creatures. Oneof the chief literary products of this quest was the encyclopedia of ex-otic places and their native flora and fauna known as the Classic of theMountains and Seas,whose authorship was commonly ascribed to Yuthe Great himself. This unusual work has survived through numerousmutations, notably the efforts of the prolific scholastic commentator GuoPu (276–324) to impose order on the text by dividing it into concentriccosmogeographic realms extending outward beyond the “civilized world”of the Zhou realm.9The first five chapters of the Classic of the Moun-tains and Seas,the oldest portion of the extant text, identify the loca-tions of more than four hundred mountains within the known world ofHan China and detail the distinctive flora, fauna, and minerals of each.Later additions describe the “Realm Beyond the Seas” and the “GreatWastelands” lying beyond the Nine Continents surveyed and mapped byYu. These remote and exotic lands were worlds of fantastic peoples andcreatures, mutant life forms that defied belief. Regrettably, the illustra-tions that accompanied the original text of the Classic of the Mountainsand Seashave long since been lost. But a second century c.e.tomb mu-ral from Shandong depicts a parade of fantastic creatures, including nu-merous human-beast hybrids and bizarre morphological anomalies,highly reminiscent of those described in the Classic of the Mountains andSeas(figure 12).10The fangshialso professed knowledge of mysterious worlds muchcloser at hand: the mountain wildernesses looming just beyond the cul-tivated fields and ordered settlements of the human habitat. Chinese re-garded the mountains and forests as an eerie world of constant and sur-prising mutation detached from the regular symmetry of civilized life,inhabited by all manner of strange beasts no less exotic than the inhab-itants of the most distant countries of the “Great Wastelands.” The crea-tures of the forest perhaps bore some faint resemblance to the familiarfauna of the humanized landscape, but their grotesque forms belied vividfears of the unknown and the unknowable.82Shanxiao:Mountain Goblins"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Figure 12.

The bizarrecreatures encountered in the pages of the Classic of the Mountains andSeaswere not merely anomalous curiosities; they also were viewed asbaleful omens. The older sections of the text, devoted to China proper,list numerous strange creatures whose appearances foretell impendingdisturbances of the natural and human orders (such as drought, flood,war, and epidemic).11Implicit in the worldview of these macrogeogra-phies was the belief that nothing in the world is truly anomalous: thecognoscenti can discern the hidden patterns that underlie seemingly aber-rant phenomena. Anomalies were inevitable by-products of a universeundergoing constant change, a universe in which natural phenomena re-sponded organically to the vicissitudes of human affairs. At the same timeanomalies were signs, the keys to a symbolic language that articulatedthe moments of rupture in the continuum of humanity and the cosmos.12The Classic of the Mountains and Seasthus served not only as a store-house of geographic knowledge, but also as a manual for warding offimminent disaster. In this respect it contains apotropaic elements simi-lar to those found in exorcism texts such as the Album of White Marsh,which probably dates to the early Han dynasty. The “White Marsh” ofthe title refers to a mysterious creature who, according to a Tang dynastyversion of the legend, taught Huangdi about all the dangerous and malev-olent beings inhabiting the world:Huangdi went on a tour of inspection. In the east he reached the sea andascended Mount Huan. At the seashore he encountered White Marsh, adivine beast who could speak in human language and had extensive knowl-edge of the natures of all creatures. Therefore Huangdi interrogated WhiteMarsh about the spirits and demons of the world. He was told that fromancient times to the present there have been many numinous specters [jing-qi]that assume corporeal form, and many wandering souls that undergometamorphosis, a total of 11,520 kinds in all. Huangdi ordered his sub-ordinates to record the names of the beings described by White Marshtogether with illustrations of them so that they could be made known to the entire world.13Today the Album of White Marshexists only in fragments.

Whatever their textual differences, in theiroriginal forms the various versions of the Album of White Marshcon-tained illustrations as well as literary descriptions of the noxious demons(referred to as jing,“apparitions” or “specters”) that might waylay un-wary humans. In Ma Guohan’s composite text, these spirits almost al-ways are identified in terms of the places they inhabit. Some of thesespecters are associated generically with mountains and waterways;many others are specifically connected to ancient and decrepit objectsand places routinely encountered in daily life: old gateways; abandonedgraves; unused paths, ponds, and wells; discarded carts; and even de-funct marketplaces. In some instances they are said to be creatures ofgreat age, such as the hundred-year-old wolf or the thousand-year-oldtree. In each case, calling the spirit by its true name, which the text sup-plies, ensures that it can inflict no harm.16Pictures included in the textprovided visual keys for recognizing these spirits. The surviving illus-trations from the Dunhuang manuscript, which displays greater concernwith interpreting omens than expelling demons, do not feature hybridcreatures, however.We now can trace back this tradition of demonological lore to at leastthe third century b.c.e.An exorcism text recently excavated from a Qindynasty tomb dated to 217 b.c.e.contains many parallels to the de-monology and exorcistic practices found in the Album of White Marsh.This text, entitled “Spellbinding,” confirms that odious demons typicallywere believed to be aberrations of “vapors” (qi).Others were identifiedas the lost souls of dead children and infants, whose life force had notyet been exhausted. While demons of the former type were portrayed asconsciously malevolent, those of the latter type, and indeed most of theremainder, appeared as pathetic, rootless ghosts seeking shelter andfood.17The word jing,translated here as “specter,” also can mean “seed” or“germ” and often was used to denote the essential nature of a thing, adistillation of its vital force.18But we can infer from the Album of WhiteMarshthat these specters are not innately present in certain creatures orobjects; rather, they are transient beings who invade and lodge themselvesShanxiao:Mountain Goblins85"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"in aged and decrepit things. The renowned collection of anomaly storiesQuest for the Divine,composed ca. 335–49 by Gan Bao, offers corrob-oration of this conception of the demonic. In a speech put in the mouthof Confucius, who is called upon to explain strange phenomena and thenature of spirits, Gan wrote that “when things age, various and sundryspecters [jing]lodge in them because they have become weak and vul-nerable. Thus, when the six kinds of domestic animals, as well as tor-toises, snakes, fish, turtles, grasses, and trees, become old, inevitably theyare possessed by specters capable of causing baneful afflictions [yao-guai].”19Elsewhere in his book Gan Bao explains that demonic afflic-tion results from possession by numinous specters (jingqi):“Disturbancesof qiwithin are manifested by mutations in external form.” These mu-tations, Gan declared, were produced by the ceaseless but imperfect trans-formations of the Five Phases.20Gan Bao also asserted that morphol-ogical difference reflected environment as much as the innate nature ofbeings: “Divergences in qicause the nature of a being to vary; in differ-ent regions it will assume different physical forms.”21The vital tie bind-ing demonic spirits to their particular habitats is underscored in an an-ecdote recorded by Gan concerning a local official who while hunting inthe mountains captured a strange creature that looked like a human in-fant. The official wished to bring his captive home, but when he emergedfrom the forest, it suddenly died. The official explained to his puzzledentourage that he recognized the creature from its description in the Al-bum of White Marsh,which had predicted that if removed from its habi-tat it would perish.22Like entries in the Album of White Marsh,this an-ecdote reinforces the idea that baleful spirits are rooted to wild placesbeyond the horizons of civilization.A similar point was made by Wei Zhao (ca. 200–273) in his com-mentary on the Dialogues of the States,a historical work of the late War-ring States era. The Dialoguesrecounts an apocryphal episode featuringConfucius and a nobleman named Ji Huanzi from Confucius’s home stateof Lu. The Analects,which records Confucius’s conversations with hisdisciples, depicts Confucius as an unwavering agnostic who refused tosay anything on the subject of “spirits.”23But the author of the anecdotein the Dialogues of the States,like Gan Bao and many others, invokedthe authority of Confucius to make pronouncements about the logic ofthe supernatural world. In this story Ji Huanzi’s men, while digging awell, unearth a clay jar containing a sheep. To test Confucius’s knowl-edge of the spirit world, Ji reported to Confucius that he found a dog in86Shanxiao:Mountain Goblins"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"the jar instead. Unfazed, Confucius replied, “From what I have heard, itwas a sheep. Prodigies of trees and stones [mushi zhi guai]are known askuiand wangliang.Prodigies of water are known as wangxiang.Prodi-gies of earth are known as fenyang(literally, gelded sheep).”24Confu-cius’s terse answer illustrated his conviction that even seemingly anom-alous phenomena are readily comprehensible in rational terms: since“prodigies of earth” take the form of sheep, Ji should not be astonishedat finding a sheep buried in the ground.25In his explication of this pas-sage Wei Zhao observed that “trees and stones” should be read as ametaphor for mountain wildernesses. In other words, the import of Con-fucius’s words was not that trees and stones were possessed by spirits,but rather that aberrant phenomena of this sort reflect the peculiar char-acter of their natural environment.The Chinese, like most cultures, associated lofty mountain peaks withpowerful gods who commanded the elemental forces of nature. An oldercontemporary of Confucius reportedly warned his prince of the dangersof lapses in royal piety in the following words: “The gods of the moun-tains and rivers inflict calamities of flood, drought, and disease; there-fore they must be propitiated with sacrifices; the gods of the sun, moon,stars, and planets cause unseasonable snow, frost, wind, and rain; there-fore they must be propitiated with sacrifices.”26Through proper wor-ship and sacrifice the ruler could abate the wrath of the gods, but thesemountain deities remained fearsome and unapproachable. The most pow-erful mountain gods, the marchmounts (yue),were believed to exercisesovereign power over their own vast domains. The Zhou kings also ap-plied the name “marchmount” to ruling houses on the margins of theZhou realm, signifying the independent authority they exercised withintheir own territories. By the Warring States period, the analogy betweensovereignty and mountain gods was elaborated in the light of Five Phasescosmological correlations. The Chinese ecumene was believed to en-compass Five Marchmounts, the sacred mountains of the five cardinaldirections, each with its own corresponding deity.27The Zhou rulers as-sociated themselves with the Central Marchmount, Mount Song, but byearly Han times the Lord of Mount Tai, the Eastern Marchmount,emerged as the paramount mountain god, ruler of not only his Olympianparadise but also the subterranean prisons of the underworld.Powerful gods of impeccable rectitude like the Lord of Mount Taipresided over the great mountains, but lesser places were infested withpetty demons who preyed on vulnerable humans. These malevolent spir-Shanxiao:Mountain Goblins87"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"its posed a special hazard to fangshi,who often availed themselves of thesolitude and telluric energy of the mountains to perfect their techniques.In his monumental treatise on occult arts, The Master Who EmbracesSimplicity,the great philosopher-alchemist Ge Hong (283–343) ob-served that demonic forces ran rampant among the less exalted moun-tains: “Divine alchemy of the golden elixir cannot be performed in thenumberless small mountains. None of the smaller mountains have aproper deity [zhengshen]ruling over them. Instead, in such places youwill find many aberrations of trees and rocks; ancient, thousand-year-old beings; and blood-eating ghosts.28Spirits of this ilk are invariablydemonic. They have no intention of benefiting mortals, but are fully ca-pable of inflicting harm.”29Venturing into the mountains, home to pow-erful gods and unruly demons, thus was fraught with hidden dangers.Ge Hong devoted an entire chapter of The Master Who Embraces Sim-plicityto strategies for ensuring one’s safety while abroad in the moun-tains and forests. All mountains, no matter how small, have spirits, Gewrote, and the unprepared voyager is vulnerable to illness, physical at-tack, and fright caused by these spirits. Ge enumerated the proper sea-sons and days for entering mountain regions, and provided detailed in-formation on how to defend oneself against assault by changelings whoseinnocuous outward form disguised their true malefic nature. Like hisyounger contemporary and friend Gan Bao, Ge believed that “the spec-ters [jing]of old things and creatures are capable of falsely assuming hu-man form in order to confuse and deceive mortal eyes.” Therefore theessential equipment for forays into the mountains included a mirror wornon the back to expose the true forms of demons, talismans for wardingoff evil spirits, and apotropaic books like the Album of the True Formsof the Five Marchmounts (Wuyue zhenxing tu)and the Writs of the ThreeSovereigns (Sanhuangwen).30Elsewhere in his treatise Ge Hong proclaimed that he valued the Al-bum of the True Forms of the Five Marchmounts and the Writs of theThree Sovereignsas the two most important documents bequeathed tohim by his teacher. From Ge’s descriptions of these works, it’s clear thathe considered they had great value in protecting mortals from demonicaffliction:Having a copy of the Writs of the Three Sovereignsin your home enablesyou to repel demonic and baleful ghosts and ethers of hot pestilence. It willforestall calamity and drive off affliction. In cases of serious illness where aperson is on the brink of death, a devout believer of perfect sincerity who hasthis book in his possession certainly will not perish. . . . Having the Album88Shanxiao:Mountain Goblins"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"of the True Forms of the Five Marchmountsin your home enables you todeflect violent assault and repulse those who wish to do you harm; theythemselves will suffer the calamity they seek to visit upon you.31The Album of the True Forms of the Five Marchmountsconsisted of tal-ismanic images of the mountain gods that could be used to commandthese deities to repel malevolent spirits.32The images essentially took theform of esoteric mountain landscapes seen from a bird’s-eye view. TheWrits of the Three Sovereignsno longer survives, but it probably con-sisted of esoteric incantations used to enlist the aid of divine powers. Geclaimed that the book could be used to conjure celestial deities and vi-sualize the spirits of the mountains, waterways, and temples in order tomake inquiries about the causes of demonic affliction and good and illfortune within their jurisdictions.33The use of such formulas again demonstrates the conviction thatknowledge of a spirit’s true identity and form enabled mortals to gainmastery over gods and demons alike (recall, for example, the apotropaictalisman from a Han tomb shown in figure 8). The prescriptions of theAlbum of White Marshand other early demonologies manifest an abid-ing faith in the power of esoteric knowledge to repel baleful spirits. Call-ing demons by their proper names—that is to say, exposing their trueidentities—negated their supernatural powers and thwarted their evil de-signs. Ge Hong urged his disciples to consult books like the Album ofWhite Marshand Records of the Nine Cauldrons (Jiuding ji)in order toapprise themselves of the proper names of demons.34(The latter text,otherwise unknown, undoubtedly contained the names and pictures ofthe strange creatures purportedly recorded on the nine cauldrons of Yu.)Also included in the vast corpus of esoteric writings Ge received fromhis teacher was a three-scroll work entitled Classic of Subduing Moun-tain Demons and Aged Goblins and Controlling Malevolent Specters(Shou shangui laomi zhixiejing jing).Armed with such books, the adeptcould travel freely throughout the wilderness without fear of the bogiesresiding in it.35Ge Hong mentioned numerous types of goblins and specters that mightwaylay the unwary traveler. Several of these evil spirits are described innearly identical terms in the Dunhuang manuscript of the Album of theSpecters and Apparitions of White Marsh.36Among the predatory“mountain specters” (shanjing)about which Ge warned his readers wasa creature known as qia,characterized by its small stature (it was the sizeof a human child) and a single, inverted foot. This creature could harmShanxiao:Mountain Goblins89"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"humans, but Ge assured his audience that calling the qiaby its propername would drive it off. Ge Hong also mentions another mountain spirit,called hui,which was red in color, shaped like a drum, and had only asingle leg.37Ge’s description of the huirecalls that of a mountain spiritin the Album of the White Marshcalled kui,which was “shaped like adrum and ran on one leg.”38As noted above, the Dialogues of the Statesrecords that kuiwas one of the names given to “prodigies of trees andstones.” The older sections of the Classic of the Mountains and Seasmen-tion the kuionly as a kind of large buffalo. But in a later chapter, the kuiis described as a blue-skinned, one-legged, hornless bovine that utters athunderous bellow. The kuiprovoked wind and rainstorms whenever itentered or left ponds and rivers, and legend had it that Huangdi fash-ioned from the skin of a kuia drum whose sound could be heard at adistance of five hundred leagues.39In the mythological literature of theHan dynasty the kuiappears in anthropomorphic form as a musicianwhose melodies could make the hundred beasts dance (an instance, mostlikely, of reverse euhemerism). But even in this distorted and sanitizedguise the musician Kui still shared with the bestial kuithe distinctive traitof having only one leg.40It seems probable that the image of the hui/kui,and of mountain spir-its in general, derived from mountain-dwelling simian species of south-ern China. Wei Zhao asserted that the kuihad a single leg and an ape’sbody, but otherwise was humanlike and capable of human speech.41Ananalogous beast known as the “mountain huia” (shanhui)appears in theClassic of the Mountains and Seas.No mention is made of the shanhuihaving only a single leg like the kuiand Ge Hong’s (no doubt epony-mous) hui;instead, it is described as a doglike creature with a humanface that was fond of throwing objects and whistled or laughed uponseeing humans. The shanhuiwas said to run like the wind, and its ap-pearance, like that of the kui,whipped up great windstorms.42Anothercreature resembling an ape or monkey was the xiaoyang,the name givento mountain spirits in the Treatises of Huainan,compiled in the secondcentury b.c.e.43“Xiaoyang” appears in an early chapter of the Classicof the Mountains and Seasas the name of a country to the south of Chinawhose inhabitants “have human faces and long arms, and black bodiescovered with hair. Their feet are inverted. Upon seeing human beings theylaugh.”44In Han times the xiaoyangalso was identified with a four-leggedbeast known as the feifei.A legend dating at least to the early Han re-lates that at the beginning of the Zhou dynasty one of the peripheral coun-tries that swore allegiance to the Zhou submitted as tribute a beast called90Shanxiao:Mountain Goblins"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"feifeiathat was “human in form, but with inverted feet, given to spon-taneous laughter. When it laughs its upper lip covers its eyes. It eatspeople.”45The Han-era lexicon Eryarecords that the feifeiwas “simi-lar to humans, but with long, unbound hair; it runs quickly and eatspeople.” Guo Pu, in his gloss on this entry, identified the feifeiwith thexiaoyangdescribed in the Classic of the Mountains and Seas.46It seemslikely that the name xiaoyangoriginated as a specific local name for fear-some apes, and later became identified with demonic creatures of moun-tain landscapes known more generically as the hui/kui.The Tang col-lector of fantastic tales, Duan Chengshi (803–63), identified the feifeiasa gibbon of prodigious strength capable of human speech (of a bird-songtype). The feifeiwas clearly more than a rude beast, however, since itwas also reported to have foreknowledge of matters of life and death,and drinking its blood enabled one to visualize demons.47What made these “mountain specters” strikingly anomalous was theirsingle leg (monopode) and/or inverted heels (antipode).48Monopodes andantipodes are typical of the zoomorphic oddities encountered in the pagesof the Classic of the Mountains and Seas.The strange land of Xiaoyang,as we have already seen, was populated by antipodes, while the even morefantastic inhabitants of the country of Mouli were said to be bothmonopodes and antipodes. Closer to home, in the south of China, dweltpeople known as the Gan giants who were described in the exact samewords as the Xiaoyang race.49These motifs also appear as characteris-tic features of “mountain specters” in the zoological lore of the Era ofDisunion.50The mythology of Vedic India also featured monopodedemons known as ekapada.Greeks who traveled to India in the wakeof Alexander’s conquests, perhaps acquainted with these indigenous In-dian myths, listed among the fabulous peoples of India the Monocoli,monopodes of great agility, and the antipodes of Mount Nulo, who hadinverted, eight-toed feet.51Apart from the penchant for describing theinhabitants of remote and foreign lands in terms of morphologicalanomalies, it seems likely that this particular aspect of mountain-dwellingdemons reflected actual observation of the elongated arms and prehen-sile hands and tails of arboreal primates.It must be remembered that the northerners who fled with the courtto south China following the sack of Chang’an in 311 had to acclimatethemselves to a new and strange abode that, in their eyes, was no lessexotic and eerie than the fantastic lands glimpsed in the pages of the Clas-sic of the Mountains and Seas.The dismal subtropical environment andforbidding mountain forests of the south readily inspired visions of allShanxiao:Mountain Goblins91"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"kinds of ogres and hobgoblins. Ge Hong, though himself a native of thesouth, bluntly attributed the profusion of demons in the south to the re-gion’s fetid climate: “In the north, where the qiof the central plains ispure and harmonious, there are none of the noxious fiends one finds inthe mountain valleys south of the Yangzi River. The wildernesses of Wuand Chu [southeast and south-central China] are hot, wet, and unbear-ably humid. Though proper deities like the Heng and Huo Marchmountsreside there, still the south is infested with many kinds of poisonous ver-min.”52The rugged southern wilderness and its strange beasts provedimpervious to the civilizing efforts of not only human monarchs, but thegods as well. It was in this inhospitable environment that the shanxiao,a composite of savage beast and hostile foreigner, was conceived.Shanxiao(also written as shansaoor shanzao) was but one appella-tion for the specters and bogies of the mountain wilderness, who alsowere known in demonological lore as shanduor muke(literally “treelodgers”). Shandu,according to Guo Pu, was the colloquial name for xiao-yangused throughout the mountain regions extending from southernChina to northern Vietnam.53The “annals of the strange” literature ofthe Era of Disunion describes the shanduas short in stature but humanin form, covered with hair, and noteworthy for its distinctive whistlingand laughter, and also its habit of rapidly opening and shutting its eyes.54A typical description, from the brush of Zu Chongzhi (429–500), ac-knowledges its ability to change form:In Nankang [the upper reaches of the Gan River valley, the backbone ofmodern Jiangxi province in south-central China] there is a spirit [shen]known as shanduthat has a human body and stands slightly more than two feet high. It is black, with red eyes and yellow hair. It makes a nest in the shape of a bird’s egg in the trees of remote mountains. . . . [Theshandu] makes a double-layered skirt from bird feathers, with cock’s feath-ers on top and hen’s feathers underneath. It is capable of transformationsand disguising its form, so it is rarely seen. The shandubelongs to the samecategory as the mukeand shanxiao.55According to the fifth-century Gazette of Nankang,the muke/shanzaolikewise resembled humans in form and speech, but instead of hands andfeet they had birdlike talons and nested in high trees.56The tree-dwellingshanduand mukeboth seem to have some affinity with a changeling birdknown as ye,which nested in the high trees of the remote mountains ofsouthern China. The yebird could change shape and take human form;when humans violated its habitat, the yebird commanded tigers to at-tack the trespassers. These creatures displayed a strong, defensive terri-92Shanxiao:Mountain Goblins"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"torial instinct, fiercely protecting their forest habitat from incursion bywoodcutters and other human intruders.57Yet the mukealso figured in local legends as merchants who earnestlysold timber to Han settlers (the name mukecould also mean “timbertraders”).58Descriptions of the silent trade between mukeand their Hancounterparts, which typically remarked upon the honesty and absence ofgreed among the former, are reminiscent of cross-cultural trade where lin-guistic barriers occasion resort to unspoken (and often unseen) forms ofbarter.59The description of the mukerecorded by the geographer and his-torian Gu Yewang (519–81) betrays common Han Chinese perceptionsof the inhabitants of the southern wilderness as semihuman aborigines:Shangluo Mountain in Ganzhou [southern Jiangxi] is full of muke,who arekindred to ghouls [gui]. In physical form, and also in speech, they resemblehumans. From afar they can be seen distinctly, but when you approach themthey retreat into hiding. They are skilled at felling timber of fir and sandal-wood, which they pile up atop high ridges. When trading with humans, theyexchange timber for knives and axes. The person making the trade sets downthe goods to be exchanged beside the cut timber, then withdraws to a re-mote spot. The mukecome forward to collect the trade items, leaving aquantity of timber proportional to the value of the goods they take. In con-ducting trade the mukeare highly reliable and never cheat others. When adeath occurs among them, they wail and mourn, and bury the departed in a coffin.60Gu remarked approvingly upon the essential fairness of the mukein com-mercial transactions and their humanlike emotional attachments, whichdistinguished them from mere animals.61Nonetheless, Gu clearly dis-criminated between the cretinous mukeand the human race to which hebelonged. The poet Liu Yuxi (772–842), exiled to the recesses of the Nan-ling Mountains, described the region’s aboriginal inhabitants, called MakYao by Tang Chinese, as blood relatives of the muke,with whom theyshared common attributes and mysterious powers:The Mak Yao once born and grown,Take names and epithets, but lack tallies and registers,In market and trade they mingle with shark-dragon men,In wedding and marriage they intermix with the “tree lodgers.”By the sites of stars they divine the eyes of springs,By sowing with fire they open up the spines of mountains,At night they cross gorges of a thousand fathoms,The sand mouthers have no power to spurt at them.62Liu Yuxi’s older contemporary and fellow exile Han Yu (768–824) like-wise wrote that the aborigines of the Nanling “resembled langurs andShanxiao:Mountain Goblins93"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"macaques,” the lanky, long-tailed monkeys prevalent in the forests ofsouth China.63Shanxiaoalso were viewed as baleful creatures capable of inflictingharm on humans. The Classic of Spirits and Prodigies (ca. 200 c.e.) de-scribes the shanzao/shansaoas a species of human being more than tenfeet in height inhabiting the remote mountains of the west. The shanzao,which went about naked, fed on crustaceans and were said to seek firefrom humans to cook their catch.64Wei Zhao recorded that shansaowasthe name the Viet peoples, the original inhabitants of the south Chinalittoral, gave to the kuimountain spirits.65Similarly, Zu Chongzhiclaimed that shanzaowas a colloquial name in upland Zhejiang for one-legged anthropoid demons that preyed on humans.66A gazetteer of south-ern Zhejiang spoke of mountain-dwelling monopode demons who werefond of crabs and salt (which they stole from woodcutters); humans whocrossed them invariably suffered harm.67The attributes of creatures known as shanduor shanxiao—shortstature, hairy body, humanlike face, whistling or laughing cries, speed inmoving through the forest, and a predilection for eating crustaceans—all are reminiscent of primates, particularly the langurs and macaquesindigenous to the region.68It seems likely that these demonic images de-rived from frightening encounters with denizens of the mountains, bothhuman and ape. By Tang times the various strands of local legend anddemon lore had been woven together into a common narrative of bale-ful mountain-dwelling demons known generically as shanxiao.DuanChengshi collapsed all these creatures, including the huiof Ge Hong, theshanzaoof the Classic of Spirits and Prodigies,and the yebird, into thesingle category of shanxiao,which perhaps can best be rendered as“mountain goblins.”69Another archetypal image of the shanxiaoappears in a ninth-centurytale in which the shanxiaowere said to be aged tree spirits that can as-sume a variety of human guises, both pathetic (beggars clutching infants)and seductive (beautiful women adorned in elegant dress). These shanx-iaowere poltergeists who caused all sorts of minor mischief, such as sit-ting on the eaves of a house and throwing roof tiles. Though usually nothostile to humans, they were capable of deadly violence if offended.70Interaction between Han Chinese and the shanxiaoalso took the formof seduction. Shanxiao,like restless wandering ghosts, might seek thecomfort of human companionship. A twelfth-century tale recounts thestory of a firewood gatherer in southern Fujian who one day returns witha one-legged bride. The strange woman failed to arise from her bed the94Shanxiao:Mountain Goblins"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"next day, however, and when family members entered her chamber theyfound only a skeleton. Her trousseau chest was opened, but it containednothing except tiles, stones, and paper money offerings for the dead. Thefamily concluded that this woman was actually a shanxiao.71Thoughsexual encounters between humans and shanxiaodo not appear in thefolklore of Tang times and earlier, Song tales of shanxiaotypically piv-oted on the dangers of sexual predation posed by the one-legged moun-tain goblins. These themes of seduction and greed also pervaded the nas-cent cult of the Wutong spirits, who originated as a species of shanxiao.Older myths concerning the hui/kuidescribed them simply as denizensof the mountain wilderness, but the anomaly lore of the Era of Disunionand later times located the shandu/shanxiaospecifically in the Wuyi andNanling mountain ranges extending southward from the Yangzi Rivervalley to Vietnam, the territories of the ancient Viet peoples. Belief inshanxiaowas especially deeply rooted in the southern reaches of the WuyiMountains, in the prefectures of Ganzhou in southernmost Jiangxi andadjacent Tingzhou in western Fujian. A Tang etymologist defined theshanxiaosimply as “one-legged demons of Tingzhou.”72Another ninth-century author, recounting the advance of Han Chinese settlement inTingzhou, observed that as settlers cleared the forests they encounteredtree-dwelling shanduwho appeared in a variety of forms: as humans, aspigs, and as birds (the last had human heads, though, and were capableof speech). The elusive shanduproved difficult to eradicate until an ex-orcist was employed who could immobilize these creatures and preventthem from transforming into another shape.73Ganzhou legends aboutthe muke/shanducurrent in the early thirteenth century describe themas demons dwelling in the deep forests who ran about naked, whistlingto each other; after storms pass, the hills filled with the sounds of drumsand pipes as the shandusang and danced. And yet these creatures, likethe muke described by Gu Yewang long before, also consorted with hu-mans through the common medium of commerce.74Han Chinese colonists in Tingzhou built shrines in which they offeredsacrifices to the mountain goblins. A local official stationed in Tingzhouin the mid-eighth century was sufficiently vexed by such pagan cults thathe penned the essay “On the Nonexistence of Shades” for the edificationof his constituents.75One of the most notorious of these mountain gob-lin cults was that of the Seven Sisters (Qiguzi), whose shrines and tem-ples were found throughout Tingzhou and Ganzhou. The local inhabi-tants regarded the Seven Sisters as malicious spirits, yet nonethelessprovided them with sacrificial offerings in hopes of warding off theirShanxiao:Mountain Goblins95"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"afflictions.76Zhou Mi, the prolific late Song writer who generally ex-pressed strong skepticism toward claims about the potency of spirits,nonetheless gave eyewitness testimony of the supernatural powers of theSeven Sisters. Zhou’s father, upon his assignment as prefect of Tingzhouin 1255, intended to remove the Seven Sisters shrine he found withinthe prefectural examination hall. After a demonstration of the spirits’ability to work miracles, however, Zhou instead had the shrine reno-vated.77The Wutong likewise were widely venerated in Tingzhou asshanxiaospirits.The shanxiaolore of Tang-Song times, although drawing on older im-ages of mountain goblins, cast them in a new role as the hostile, barbaricforces resisting the relentless onslaught of Han Chinese expansion intothe untamed southern wilderness. The following anecdote from Dai Fu’s(fl. 738–94) Wide World of Marvels, although edged with sharp remindersof the dangers posed by the shanxiao,nonetheless underscores the sym-biotic, if fragile, economy of mutual exchange that developed betweenthe indigenous lords of the forest and the new colonists from the north:The shanxiaoare found everywhere in the Nanling ranges. They are mono-podes with inverted heels and three claws on their hands and feet. Theymake their nests in the hollows of great trees; these nests have woodenscreens to shield them from the wind and are amply supplied with food.When southerners travel in the mountains they usually carry powder, rouge,cash, and other items with them. The male shanxiao,which are called shan-gong[sire of the mountain], invariably demand gold and coin; but if youencounter a female, known as shangu[lady of the mountain], she willdemand powder and rouge instead. If you give them what they want, they will protect you.In the Tianbao period of the Tang dynasty (742–55) there was a strangerfrom the north traveling in the mountains of the Nanling. At nightfall, be-cause of his great fear of tigers, he tried to climb a tree in order to pass thenight there. Suddenly he encountered a female shanxiaoamong the branches.The traveler habitually carried money for expenses, so he climbed downfrom the tree, bowed deeply, and called out “Shangu!” From out of the treea voice asked, “What goods do you have?” The traveler then presented herwith powder and rouge, which pleased her immensely. “You may rest com-fortably without any cause for fear,” she told him. The man spent the nightbeneath the tree. In the middle of the night two tigers approached, but theshanxiaodescended and stroked their heads, saying, “Striped ones, he is myguest. You’d best leave quickly.” The two tigers then departed. The nextmorning, when the traveler took his leave, she thanked him graciously.What’s difficult to fathom is that every year the shanxiaowork in thefields together with humans. When humans come out to the fields to sowtheir grain, they find that the remaining fallow ground has been cultivated96Shanxiao:Mountain Goblins"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"by shanxiao.When the crops ripen, the shanxiaocome forward to dividethe harvest. By nature they are simple and honest. When dividing the har-vest they never take more than their portion. Humans also dare not takemore than their share; otherwise they will suffer heaven-sent illness andplague.78In Dai Fu’s telling, the shanxiaowere feral creatures, kindred to tigersand other dangerous creatures of the forest. Yet at the same time the shan-xiaodisplayed the all-too-human vices of vanity and greed. Though DaiFu ridiculed their petty avarice, like other observers he also applaudedtheir fairness and honesty in dealings with humans. The uneasy coexis-tence between humans and shanxiaodepicted in Dai’s anecdote un-doubtedly testifies to the frictions, and potential for violent confronta-tion, between Han Chinese and the indigenous inhabitants of the mountainrecesses of south China.79Thus the shanxiaolore also reiterated the intensifying struggle betweencivilization and barbarism that accompanied the southward push of Hansettlement. Old legends of mountain-dwelling goblins and fairies wererevived in the dread image of the shanxiao, nimble poltergeists, denizensof the wilderness who stubbornly—if ineffectually—resisted the inex-orable advance of Han civilization. Like the inveterate enemies of thenorthern frontier, the steppe nomads, the shanxiaooscillated betweenthe roles of violent predators and benign trading partners in their rela-tions with Han settlers.80But the Han could not discern, in the nativesof the southern mountains no less than the misshapen, bestial shanxiao,any resemblance to members of the civilized races such as themselves.On the contrary, Han perceptions of the indigenous species of the south-ern forests, both human and animal, fused into the composite image ofthe shanxiao,one that inspired fear and loathing, and occasionally pity.Shanxiao:Mountain Goblins97"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"chapter 4Plague Demons and Epidemic GodsFor noble and commoner alike, the scourge of illness was perhaps themost compelling evidence for the existence of demons. Chinese attrib-uted illness, like misfortune in general, either to adventitious afflictionby some malefic entity or to just punishment inflicted on the victim forhis or her own moral transgressions. Thus the agents of sickness andplague were sometimes perceived as demons, and in other cases as theminions of divine justice. This ambiguity was also characteristic of theWutong cult. Wutong was feared as an evil spirit that visited sicknessand other miseries on luckless innocents, yet Wutong also appeared as abenevolent god who delivered the community from plague. In Wutong,the demonic and the divine were folded into a single entity. In the realmof illness and disease, as in Chinese religion in general, the emphasisshifted away from ancestors or malevolent ghosts toward gods and theirunderlings as the primary sources of supernatural affliction. From theSong dynasty onward a class of specialized gods emerged to whom com-munities would appeal for deliverance from the ravages of epidemic dis-ease. Some of these gods were portrayed as stalwart champions of theirmortal clients, but in other cases plague deities shaded toward the de-monic, for they were perceived as both cause and cure.An abiding concern with illness and its causes and remedies appearsalready in the Shang oracle bone divinations, which were principally de-voted to securing the well-being of the Shang ruling class. The Shang at-tributed many physical infirmities to a common etiology: the curse of an98"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"ancestor. To the Shang, illness was not a discrete set of pathologies to betreated by specific therapies collectively categorized as “medicine.” In-stead, illness, like war and harvest failure, was an ominous symptom ofa rupture in the reciprocal economy of exchange between deified ances-tors and their mortal descendants. In the oracle bone inscriptions, theword “curse” (sui)generally signified illnesses inflicted by direct ances-tors or other spirits of the dead. Treatment therefore centered on pla-cating the offended spirit with offerings and reestablishing ritual harmonybetween the dead and the living. The Shang apparently also believed thatsome illnesses resulted from demonic affliction in the form of “evil wind.”But there is no evidence that the Shang utilized drugs or any other kindof medication to cure illness, nor do we find a group of healers otherthan the diviners who interpreted oracles received from the dead.1Belief in demonic causes of illness remained prominent in the Zhouand Han eras as well. Despite the efforts on the part of the Zhou to erad-icate the ancestor cults of the Shang, the belief that the dead could harmthe living persisted, spurring the invention of exorcistic therapies to com-bat demonic attack. Whereas the Shang concept of illness revolved aroundpropitiation of dead kin and nurturing the symbiosis of ancestors anddescendants, Zhou lore tended to emphasize the malevolence of the dead,particularly ghosts seeking revenge. A cogent example of Zhou belief inthe demonic nature of illness appears in the Chronicles of Zuo’s accountof the sudden death of the Marquis of Jin in 581 b.c.e.The marquis isreported to have had a dream in which he was visited by an ancestralspirit of the Zhao lineage, which the marquis had ruthlessly massacredtwo years before. The giant, menacing figure—readily recognizable as ademon by his “disheveled, unbound hair hanging to the ground”—gravely announced that he had petitioned the Celestial Thearch for per-mission to punish the marquis for his iniquity, and the supreme deity hadgranted his request. Sure enough, the marquis was struck by a sicknessthat neither spirit mediums nor physicians could cure, and he died soonafter.2The belief that the ghosts of the wrongfully dead exacted revengeby inflicting illness on those responsible for their deaths endured in pop-ular belief throughout Chinese history.But demonic affliction did not necessarily spring from this kind of per-sonal animus. Sudden outbreaks of disease or perturbations of the mindwere often regarded as random events caused by malignant, though notnecessarily evil, entities. The entries in the Classic of the Mountains andSeas suggest that the most common maladies travelers in strange landswere likely to suffer were derangement (huo)and malefic poisoning (gu).3Plague Demons and Epidemic Gods99"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"“Derangement” was a general term for infections of the mind that causeddelusions, erratic behavior, and physical illness. Episodes of huoweretypically blamed on demonic possession. Gu,already identified in theShang oracle bones as a baneful affliction, appears to have been a gen-eral term for black magic, but gualso denoted a variety of debilitatingillnesses.4One of the most systematic discussions of guappears in a fa-mous dialogue between a later Marquis of Jin and the renowned physi-cian He recorded in the Chronicles of Zuo.In 541 b.c.e., the marquisfell ill and summoned He to cure him. Physician He diagnosed the mar-quis’s ailment as a case of gu,which He described as a degenerative ill-ness caused by sensual, especially sexual, indulgence. The learned doc-tor advised his patient that the most certain cure required that the marquisrein in his unbridled concupiscence.5The connection between guand se-duction by women insinuated in Physician He’s admonitions also in-formed the widespread conviction that guwas a form of witchcraft.Wugu,or black magic practiced by sorcerers, figured in the most noto-rious witchcraft scandal of the Han dynasty, which occurred in 91 b.c.e.,in the twilight years of the megalomaniac emperor Wu (r. 140–87b.c.e.). This case, which was rife with sexual innuendo, centered on ac-cusations that certain officials and even imperial princesses had used guwitchcraft in an attempt on the aged emperor’s life. The hysteria whippedup by these charges, the investigations they prompted, and the recrimi-nations launched by the targets of the accusers resulted in hundreds ofdeaths, including the executions of the most powerful civil official in theempire and two of Wu’s daughters.6In this instance the sorcerers allegedlyemployed effigies and spells to curse their victims, but in later accountsguwitchcraft involved the use of poisons concocted from venomous rep-tiles and insects. Physician He identified guwith flying insects spawnedby rotting grain, and later texts linked guto maggots; such associationsechoed the common belief that parasitic worms living in the human bodycould cause illness and death.7The earliest surviving medical literature demonstrates that belief inthe demonic origins of illness was deeply entrenched at the highest lev-els of Han society. The ancient medical treatise Recipes for Fifty-Two Ail-ments,recovered from the early Han tombs at Mawangdui (dated to 168b.c.e.), prescribed a broad range of therapies for the alleviation of com-mon ailments, both internal and external. What is striking about theseremedies is their frequent recourse to spells and other exorcistic tech-niques such as ritual dances, magical weapons, and purgative drugs. Fromthe evidence of this text, which probably drew on a medical tradition100Plague Demons and Epidemic Gods"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"dating back to the Warring States period, we can conclude that physi-cians routinely engaged in exorcism, uttering maledictions against inva-sive demons and summoning spirits to drive them out of the victim’s body.The use of these exorcistic incantations demonstrates once again the con-viction that knowledge of a demon’s identity endowed one with powerover it.8The rise of correlative cosmology in the Warring States and early Hanperiods profoundly altered Chinese conceptions of disease and medicine.Human anatomy and, even more importantly, the functions of the bodywere easily analogized to the organic processes of cyclical change, de-pletion, and renewal embedded in Five Phases and yin/yangcosmologies.These ideas crystallized into a sizable corpus of homeopathic medicinethat linked the microcosmic functions of the body to the macrocosmicphenomena of the natural world. This emerging medical discourse postu-lated that human physiology was governed not only by the individual’sown actions, but also by the movements of celestial bodies, the alter-nation of the seasons, and the constantly changing natural environment.The salience of any particular set of these ruling principles at a giventime dictated the proper means of regulating the body through con-sumption of food and drink; schedules of movement and rest; choice ofclothing, lodging, and all other appurtenances of daily life; and disci-pline of conduct and the emotions. The new medical tradition repre-sented the correlations between the functions of the body and their gov-erning macrocosmic forces in terms of qi,which in this context perhapscan be translated as “vital humors.” Illness resulted from disruption ofthe normative rhythms of the body, which in turn was attributed not toevil demons but to “pathogenic humors” (xieqi). The therapies gener-ated by this medical discourse spurned exorcistic practices in favor ofregulation of the body and behavior in harmony with the macrocosmicenvironment.9During the early Han dynasty, then, various theories of human phys-iology that disparaged demonic invasion as the principal cause of dis-ease began to coalesce into what eventually became the classical tradi-tion of Chinese medicine. Although antecedents of this new conceptionof the body can be glimpsed in the Mawangdui medical texts, it emergesclearly in the anthology of medical writings known as The Inner Canonof Huangdi (Huangdi neijing), compiled in the first century b.c.e.10Theheterogeneous texts united in The Inner Canondid not constitute a sin-gle coherent tradition, but they established a core of basic ideas aboutthe structure and function of the body. The body was conceived in termsPlague Demons and Epidemic Gods101"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"of twelve functional vessels and the conduits connecting them, throughwhich vital humors circulated. The physiology of circulation of vital hu-mors through these vessels and conduits was based on analogy with in-ternal organs of the body rather than anatomical evidence of the work-ings of specific organs, blood vessels, muscles, nerves, etc. The kidneys,for example, were classified as yinvessels in which the latent energeticforces of the body were concentrated, while on the psychic level the kid-neys were associated with willpower and susceptibility to fear.11Med-ical therapy aimed at ensuring that vital humors circulated without ob-struction through these conduits and vessels. This nascent canon ofmedical knowledge still admitted the importance of external influenceson bodily functions, though. The application of analogical reasoning de-rived from correlative cosmology to the vessels of the body ramified intoa complex system of correspondences between bodily functions and cos-mological processes.Essential to this new conception of the body was the idea that the in-dividual assumed primary responsibility for his or her own health andwell-being. Health and sickness were commonly expressed through po-litical metaphors. Indeed, the transitive verb zhiwas employed for both“cure” and “rule.” The body came to be understood as a country headedby a ruler (the mind) in concert with his officials (organic processes identi-fied with the five viscera) and populated by a coterie of spirits that ani-mated the body and regulated its functions. As ruler of one’s own body,each individual must conduct his or her life in such a way as to harmo-nize the vital humors within the body with the ever-changing macrocos-mic qi.12Using the terms of Ge Hong’s simile, the person who avoidsdissipation and preserves the vitality of his body will prolong his life,just as the austere ruler who nurtures the welfare of his subjects therebyperpetuates his rule.13By the second century c.e., the disparate strains of homeopathic med-icine based on correlative cosmology became synthesized and codifiedinto a “classical” canon of medical orthodoxy, one perhaps best describedas “qimedicine.”14Yet, while qimedicine triumphed as the dominantmedical orthodoxy, it did not eradicate older beliefs in the demonic causesof illness and disease. Malign demons resurfaced in the subtly alteredform of numinous influences, often given concrete expression as gods andspirits, emanating from celestial bodies and other phenomena of thenatural world. One example is the baleful star known as Taisui, whichshadowed the progress of Jupiter in its twelve-year rotation through theheavens. The “lodging” that Jupiter occupied in the firmament had its102Plague Demons and Epidemic Gods"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"corresponding region on earth. As Jupiter moved through its celestial or-bit, it brought blessings and good harvests to its terrestrial equivalent.But Taisui, moving in the reverse direction, sowed death and calamity inthe regions that fell under its baleful influence. In popular belief, though,Jupiter and Taisui became conflated, and people sought to ward off theinfluence of Jupiter as well.15The two chapters of Wang Chong’s bookdevoted to belief in baleful asterisms attest to the prevalence of the fearsaroused by Jupiter/Taisui. Wang also bore witness to the frequent re-course to talismans and exorcisms to protect mortals from this chief ofthe spirits of pestilence.16The movements of another celestial spirit, Taiyi(who, as mentioned earlier, also figured as the supreme deity in officialHan religion), were also linked to illness and death. The conjunctionof the location of Taiyi and the direction of the wind was said to deter-mine whether the wind would have malefic or auspicious effects. If thewind blew from the direction of Taiyi, blessings would ensue; but windblowing in the opposite direction was an evil wind that caused sickness.The etiology of disease caused by Taisui or wind was couched inmetaphors of war and combat. For example, Taisui, or alternatively wind,“launched offensives” (chong)against the victims of disease, who mustmobilize their body’s defenses (“camps” and “guards”) to repel this de-monic invasion.17The demonic conception of disease also survived in the enduring beliefthat violent death left a residue of morbidity that could infect the living,a fear vividly expressed in the idea that victims of violent or prematuredeath lingered in the mortal world as ghosts. (Indeed, another meaningof guin Han times was demonic affliction caused by vengeful ghosts.)The malignant touch of these ghosts, much like the Shang curse of theancestor, could result in potentially fatal illness. Exorcism was deemedthe most effective remedy. “Ghosts of those who die violent deaths fre-quently inflict illness on mortals,” wrote the commentator Gao Youaround the turn of the third century c.e., “but sorcerers are able to ex-terminate them by means of conjuration and inquest (zhuhe).”18The ex-orcist’s use of spells to subject demons to summary investigation, judg-ment, and execution reflected his role as a magistrate of the world ofshades. Just as the Lord of Mount Tai and his underlings conductedsearching judicial inquiry into the mortal conduct of the dead, so toocould the exorcist assume the mantle of bureaucratic authority in orderto discipline and punish wayward demons.As is true for most Chinese mythology, mythical accounts of thecauses of plague appear fairly late in the written record, in texts of thePlague Demons and Epidemic Gods103"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Warring States and early Han eras. One myth, evidently widespread inthe Han, traced the origins of disease to the ill-fated progeny of the an-cient sage-king Zhuanxu. Although Zhuanxu was celebrated in Zhoulegends for siring eight talented sons who were boons to humanity, itwas also said that Zhuanxu had three sons who died in childbirth andbecame plague demons: the fever demon (nuegui), who dwelled in theGreat River (presumably the Yangzi); the wanglianginhabiting the RuoRiver19(elsewhere described as mountain goblins, in this instance thewangliangwere associated with water, more properly the domain ofthe wangxiang); and a third who lurked in the dark, dank corners ofhuman dwellings and frightened children.20The sons of Zhuanxu whodied in childbirth clearly belonged to the category of the ghosts of thosewho suffered untimely deaths and continue to haunt the world of theliving. According to Cai Yong (132–92), the Great Exorcism (Nuo), oneof the most important rites of the Han court’s ceremonial calendar, wasperformed primarily to drive these plague demons from the palaceprecincts.21The Great Exorcism was a spectacular ritual conducted at the time ofthe midwinter La festival, when the cosmic powers of death and decaywere at their height, to expel demonic influences prior to the inaugura-tion of the New Year. The Great Exorcism is best known through de-scriptions of its performance in connection with the state cult, but sim-ilar rites were conducted by the populace at large.22The most detailedaccount of the Great Exorcism appears in the poet Zhang Heng’s(78–139) “Ode to the Eastern Capital.” In Zhang’s description of theGreat Exorcism, the chief exorcist, known as the fangxiang,donned ananimal mask and led an assembly of officials through a series of purga-tions aimed at eradicating twelve classes of baleful demons. Palace at-tendants clad in fur, feathers, and horns masqueraded as the evil demons.The exorcist called upon specific deities to “devour” the demons, andwith a great flourish of weapons the assembly dispatched each group ina specific manner of execution (e.g., mutilation, decapitation, or drown-ing).23Although little is known of the character of the plague-expellingdeities invoked to repel the demons, it seems that they were associatedwith both the twelve months of the year and the twelve points of thecompass, and thus represented guardian deities deployed across bothspace and time.24The Great Exorcism thus was a rite of mortification and purificationwherein exorcists impersonated spirits in order to stage a ritual combat104Plague Demons and Epidemic Gods"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"against the specters of pestilence, drought, flood, and other calamities.The Rituals of Zhoudescribed the fangxiangwho presided over the GreatExorcism as “clad in a black tunic and crimson robe and having a bear(or tiger) skin with four golden eyes draped over his head, while grasp-ing a lance and shield in his hands.”25The bear headdress with fourgolden eyes suggests a totemic mask that endowed the wearer with su-pernatural powers, and many authors have concluded that the fangxiangwas a type of shaman. William Boltz argues convincingly for seeing thefangxiangas a conjurer of visions, a phantasmagoricist who enables thetroops of exorcists under his command to visualize and then put to deaththe multitude of specters that afflict humankind.26But the fangxiangwasindeed a shaman in the sense that he was someone who impersonatedthe demonic spirits he sought to exterminate. The striking semantic re-semblance between the names of the fangxiangand his chief adversary,the demonic fangliang,reinforces this sense of the fangxiangas a posi-tive alter ego of the forces of disorder. Impersonation of spirits as a meansof enabling mortals to communicate with them was a common featureof Chinese religious life. The Odesdescribes the use of mediums in an-cestral rites to impersonate the dead and enable them to partake of thefood offerings sacrificed to them, a practice that was still current in theHan dynasty.27Although the Great Exorcism also aimed at eradicating demons rep-resenting calamities of fire and water, its main theme was the expulsionof pestilence (zhuyi, zhuli).28Individual households also performed rit-uals of expiation known as Nuo on the eve of the New Year as a meansof protecting family members from sickness and pestilence.29One of theseNuo rites, recorded in a Han prognostication text but apparently ple-beian in origin, involved tossing beans, sesame seeds, and locks of fam-ily members’ hair into the household well while uttering a spell invok-ing the well spirit’s protection against the “plague demons of the fivedirections” (wufang yigui).30In Tang times, Huangdi was credited withinventing the Nuo ritual as a means of expelling “evil specters” (yao-jing), “fevers” (zhen), and “drifting, wandering, floating ghosts.” Ratherthan annihilating these malign spirits, though, the ritual was supposedto banish them beyond the frontiers, at a safe remove from the commu-nity. This theme of expulsion of pestilential spirits outside the bound-aries of the community later became a common motif of plague cults.We find no mention of the fangxiangexorcist in descriptions of the pop-ular Nuo of Tang times. Instead, the ritual typically invoked the de-Plague Demons and Epidemic Gods105"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"monifuge spirit Zhong Kui to drive away malicious spirits, though insome cases the deities of the underworld such as Yama, the Lord of MountTai, or the General of the Five Paths of Rebirth (Wudao jiangjun) weresummoned to reclaim the vagabond souls of the dead.31Of the twelve classes of demons mentioned by Zhang Heng as targetsof the Great Exorcism, the only ones specifically linked to plague andepidemic were mysterious specters known as the Wild Youths and Rov-ing Lights (yezhong32youguang). Xue Zong (d. 243), in his gloss onZhang’s poem, identified the Wild Youths and Roving Lights as “evil spir-its,” adding that they were a group of eight brothers who often engagedin malice in the world of mortals.33The Dunhuang manuscript of theAl-bum of the Specters and Apparitions of White Marshalso identified theWild Youths and Roving Lights as a demon gang of eight brothers whoseappearance foretells many deaths from plague throughout the empire.34The illustration accompanying this passage depicts a group of eightyouths surrounding a fire-cart (figure 13). The fire-cart may reflect Bud-dhist influence; in the Treatise of the Perfection of Wisdom,one of themost influential Mahàyàna texts in Chinese Buddhism, sinners are trans-ported to hell in a fire-cart, and later Buddhist depictions of the under-world include a “fire-cart hell.”35But the fire-cart also symbolized anexcess of yanghumors, believed to be one of the chief causes of sickness.Already in Han times the Roving Lights plague spirits were associatedwith exorcisms conducted on Double Fifth (Duanwu, the fifth day of thefifth month), which immediately preceded the summer solstice, theapogee of fiery yanginfluence, as well as the midwinter Great Exorcism.The winter and summer solstices were deemed the most dangerous timesof the year, because mortals were especially susceptible to demonic in-vasion at these times of extreme imbalances of yin(winter) and yang(sum-mer) influences in the cosmos. Not surprisingly, then, the rituals per-formed both on Double Fifth and at the midwinter La festival, heldaround the time of the winter solstice, were principally devoted to ex-orcising baleful forces.The association of disease with the hot, humid climate of the south,the direction of fiery yang,and the increased activity of insects and otherloathsome vermin during the summer probably reinforced the notion thatthe fifth month was a time of great vulnerability to disease. Indeed,throughout the entire fifth lunar month Chinese scrupulously obeyed nu-merous taboos and took precautions to protect themselves from pesti-lence and other kinds of misfortune. As the Han ritual calendar, theMonthly Ordinances (Yueling), observed:106Plague Demons and Epidemic Gods"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"In [the fifth] month the days attain their greatest length. Then yinagaincontends with yang,and death once again begins to overtake life. The su-perior man fasts and follows ritual taboos, remaining in retirement at homeand avoiding violent activity.

The corps of officials ceasejudicial proceedings and inflict no corporal punishments. In these ways thetransition to Ascending Yin can proceed in orderly fashion.36The extremes of yinand yangwere equally hazardous during this limi-nal period of cosmological transition. Ying Shao, writing in the late sec-ond century, mentioned the custom of “wearing the five colors to wardoff the five weapons” (wubing;a metaphor for demonic attack) at thetime of the summer solstice in connection with exorcising the RovingLights demons. Ying reported that an epidemic that swept through thecapital during the Yongjian reign period (126–31 c.e.) was blamed onPlague Demons and Epidemic Gods107Figure 13.

Afterwardpeople ascribed outbreaks of epidemic to these same demons and worefive-colored silk cloths embroidered with the legend “Roving Lights” torender themselves immune. “Wearing the five colors,” Ying explained,referred to attaching small pieces of green, red, white, black, and yellowsilk to one’s clothing as protective amulets.37Colored silk streamers alsowere tied to the entrance gates of homes to ward off plague. Plague ex-orcism rites grew increasingly elaborate during the Era of Disunion. Asixth-century work on annual festivals reports that in south China onDouble Fifth people used mugwort (which, because of its red color andpungent aroma, was regarded as a powerful vermifuge) to bind up effigies(presumably representing the plague demons) and hang them from theirgateways in order to dispel “pathogenic humors.” They also wore col-ored silk ribbons attached to their sleeves, and silently intoned the nameof the “demonic Roving Lights” to protect themselves against infectionfrom virulent disease.38The Great Exorcism and Double Fifth rituals both portray the ex-pulsion of plague demons as a violent combat against heinous, terrify-ing creatures. In many remedies for demonic affliction preserved in theRecipes for Fifty-Two Ailments,the physician or the spirits he conjuressubjugate the demon by violent means, using magical weapons such asa rammer, a thuja-wood pestle, or an iron hammer.39A relief carving fromthe Wu family shrine, constructed in the mid-second century c.e., verylikely illustrates a conjurer engaged in just such an exorcism. The reliefshows two figures, one wielding an axe and the other a hammer, com-ing to the rescue of the central figure, who is writhing in the clutches ofa snake (the snake, of course, was a common metaphor for demonic afflic-tion). Another figure, with fin-shaped legs, gesticulates in the background;this figure presumably is a spirit medium summoning the warrior spir-its to kill or expel the demon.40Ying Shao’s invocation of the five weaponsas a metaphor for attack by plague demons undoubtedly alludes toChiyou, the reputed creator of the five weapons. As noted in chapter 1,Chiyou was venerated in Han times as an apotropaic deity who uses hisformidable arsenal to drive off evil spirits. Indeed, the fangxiangexor-cist described in the Rituals of Zhou closely resembles descriptions ofChiyou, and it has been argued that the fangxiangassumes the alter egoof Chiyou to conduct the Great Exorcism.41A Han relief carving froma second-century c.e.tomb, which has been identified as an illustrationof the Great Exorcism rite, portrays Chiyou as a demonifuge acting at108Plague Demons and Epidemic Gods"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"the behest of the fangxiangexorcist (figure 14).42In this frieze, the figureat the far right, wearing a headdress with bearlike ears, is shown in theact of devouring a man, which recalls the metaphorical use of “devour”to connote demonic attack. The cannibal, undoubtedly a demon, is con-fronted by another fantastic bearlike creature flourishing five weapons,most notably a crossbow above his head. This figure, which appears re-peatedly in Han mortuary art, can be firmly identified as Chiyou.43ToChiyou’s right stands another figure, presumably the fangxiangexorcist,with a bear headdress and holding a shield and sword. Behind the fang-xianga series of figures run toward the demon carrying not conventionalweapons but rather ladles, spades, and a flask. These demonifuge spir-its battle demons by dousing them with some sort of purgative water orelixir. The efficacy of purgative waters for dispelling demonic invasionis well attested in other Han sources.44The mural’s depiction of illnessand cure as a mortal combat between violent demons and guardian war-rior spirits again reminds us of the martial metaphors commonly usedin Han medical texts.In addition to rites of exorcistic combat tied to the ritual calendar,Chinese of the Han era employed a wide variety of charms and talismansto ward off sickness and plague. Recourse to such devices was at leastas common as use of medicinal substances to cure illness. Among theflora and fauna mentioned in the older sections of the Classic of theMountains and Seas,thirty-nine species are identified as having medici-nal (primarily demonifugic) value and twenty-nine were worn on the bodyfor protection against demons.45Wearing talismans and amulets preparedby sorcerers and priests was a common practice among all ranks of so-ciety. For example, a girdle ornament known as a gangmao,made of jade,ivory, metal, or peach wood and engraved with an apotropaic charm,was worn on the body as protection against illness (figure 15).46We havealready encountered Ge Hong’s claims that possession of sacred bookslike the Writs of the Three Sovereignsprotected one’s home from vari-ous malign influences, including “humors of illness and plague.” Simi-larly, if travelers carried on their person the diagram of the True Imageof the Southern Marchmount (south being the direction of fire andplague), “the five kinds of pestilence will not draw near.”47The woodof peach and thuja trees was deemed especially baneful to demons. Manyof the remedies included in the third-century b.c.e.“spellbinding” textinvolved making weapons such as arrows, hammers, swords, or stavesout of jujube, mulberry, or peach wood.48Door guardians representingPlague Demons and Epidemic Gods109"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Figure 14.

Whence do these thoughts arise? Why, from illness.

Thus, Huangdi dispatched Sorcerer Xian, who instructed the black-headed masses to perform ablutions and fasting in order to open up theNine Apertures; to strike drums and ring bells in order to rouse their hearts;to exercise their bodies marching in processions in order to stimulate theyinand yanghumors; to drink wine and consume vegetarian feasts in orderto unblock the Five Viscera. As for striking drums and crying and shoutingto expel demons and ward off plague, it is simply a matter of the black-headed masses, in their ignorance, believing that illness is caused by demoniccurse.”51The author of this passage provided a rational basis, grounded in theprecepts of qimedicine, for exorcism rituals. Although belief in demonscould be dismissed as mere superstition, the physical activity of ritualperformance had the beneficial effect of stimulating the circulation of vi-tal humors throughout the body. But the strident tone of skeptics whoderided belief in demonic affliction in itself bears witness to its tenacioushold on popular psychology.Wang Chong, too, subscribed to the new medical orthodoxy basedon qihumors. He attributed disease to somatic causes, especially inade-quate hygiene and nutrition, that produced imbalances in the body’s vi-tal humors. Even more important in the spread of disease, though, washuman ignorance of the real etiology of illness:Among the acute diseases afflicting humankind, rare are those that are notcaused by wind and damp, or food and drink. After falling ill from expo-sure to wind or sleeping in the damp, the vulgar masses foolishly emptytheir purses and hire soothsayers to determine the cause of the curse theybelieve has been laid upon them. And after stuffing their bellies in glutton-ous feasting, such people devote themselves to fasting and bathing to dispelthe sickness that results. If the illness does not abate, it is said that the exor-cism was not performed properly; if the patient dies, then the medium isblamed for committing some ritual error.... In cases where many people die in a brief span of time, with as many asten coffins interred at once, people do not attribute the deaths to a contam-ination of qi,but rather to a baneful day of interment.

In cases of acute illnessthey do not seek the counsel of physicians, but rather harbor dire fears oflapses in ritual piety.53Elsewhere, Wang Chong’s convictions about the environmental causesof disease led him to argue that the southern regions of the empire wereunfit for human habitation. The toxic “fierce qi” of the hot, fetid south,the land of “Great Yang,” infected not only the landscape and its crea-tures, but also the human beings who dwelled there. “The people of Chuand Yue are frenzied and febrile,” Wang—himself a native of Yue (mod-ern Zhejiang)—declaimed. “When southerners curse a tree, it dies; whenthey spit at a bird, it falls dead.” It was precisely because of their birth“south of the Great River” that southern sorcerers possessed the powerto cure the sick or curse the healthy by means of spells and incantations.By the same token, the myriad creatures of the south were exceedinglypoisonous and injurious to humans. While the ignorant say that thesecreatures are “demons,” in fact their morbidity is a result of the patho-logical excess of Great Yang characteristic of the southern regions.54Wangcould thus comfortably reconcile the vaunted efficacy of the spells ofsouthern sorcerers and the prevalence of disease in the south with hisfaith in the tenets of qimedicine.But Wang Chong also delineated a moral etiology of plague, one thatreaffirmed prevailing concepts of divine retribution. In his rebuttalagainst claims that the Great Exorcism was necessary to prevent epi-demics, Wang argued that pestilence and other calamities act as barom-eters of the ruler’s virtue. Thus the virtuous sage-kings of antiquity re-quired no recourse to sorcerers and exorcists, but the reign of evil in thedays of the tyrants Jie and Zhou unleashed rampant disease and devas-tation.55Wang shared with the learned men of his time the belief that asupreme deity governed human existence and expressed displeasure withor approval of the ruler’s actions through “disasters and marvels.”56Inthe new religious movements of the later Han dynasty, this notion of di-vine retribution became fused with an apocalyptic messianism, produc-ing a radically different understanding of illness that rejected both theexorcistic practices of the fangshiand the homeopathic therapies of qimedicine.The founders of the Celestial Masters and Great Peace sects in the sec-ond century c.e., Zhang Lu and Zhang Jue, first gained audiences asPlague Demons and Epidemic Gods113"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"preachers and healers. Both sects rejected conventional medical arts andinsisted that faith healing alone could cure the ills that tormented hu-manity. Although these religious teachers shared their contemporaries’beliefs in the demonic origin of illness, they also impressed on their fol-lowers the stern warning that illness was a punishment for moral trans-gressions. Invading demons were not simply malevolent parasites, butrather agents of moral authority acting in the name of divine judgment.Thus healing must begin with contrition and penance. Confession of sinswas central to both the Celestial Masters and Great Peace sects. The Ce-lestial Masters congregations practiced mass rituals of confession andpenitence; in addition, they stipulated that victims of illness must writeletters of repentance to the ruling gods of heaven, earth, and water (theSanguan or Three Offices) seeking absolution for their sins. Similarly, thehealing regimen propagated by Zhang Jue consisted of a threefold for-mula of repentance, absolution, and exorcism. Once the stricken personhad demonstrated remorse and pledged to sin no more, the priest pre-pared a talisman that served as a warrant summoning spirit warriors tocome to the aid of the victim. The talisman was then burned and im-mersed in consecrated water, which the victim drank. Finally, marshallingthe spirit warriors through spells and ritual dance, the priest exorcisedthe disease and restored the victim to health.57The idea that illness was punishment for moral and ritual transgres-sions of course dated back at least to the Shang dynasty. But the correl-ative cosmology that dominated Warring States and Han thought largelyignored the causes and conditions of individual existence and focusedinstead on the supreme role of the ruler in maintaining cosmic harmony.The “tremblings of heaven,” omens of misfortune that would touch allof the empire’s subjects, occupied the attention of rulers and theirofficials. The new religious movements of the Later Han, in contrast,shifted the site of divine retribution from the macrocosmic level of theempire to the microcosmic level of the individual person. The Canon ofGreat Peace (Taipingjing),revered as revealed scripture by the CelestialMasters and Great Peace sects, condemned the evils of the present erawhile offering a vision of a reformed society in which each individualcontributed to order and peace by fulfilling the duties of their calling.The Canonthus assigned to individuals a personal moral responsibilitylargely absent from the classical traditions of political philosophy. Onceindividuals assumed the burden of responsibility for their own actions,the ruler could attain the ideal of ruling by nonaction celebrated in theDao De Jing.58114Plague Demons and Epidemic Gods"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"The moral order envisioned in the Canon of Great Peacerested on abureaucratic infrastructure of gods and spirits engaged in constant sur-veillance of the individual’s conduct. Every sin was duly reported to thedivine authorities, who subtracted a corresponding number of days,months, or years from the miscreant’s life span. Ge Hong, writing in theearly fourth century, identified these watch-guard spirits as the ThreeWorms (Sanshi), which dwelled within the body and on every gengshenday (one of the sixty days of the Chinese calendrical cycle) reported theperson’s evil deeds to the Sovereign of Life Destiny (Siming), who ad-justed the person’s life span accordingly.59The Three Worms were be-lieved to actively seek the death of their host, and so became objects offear and loathing.60Yet in the eyes of the new religious movements, theagents of disease were not malevolent demons at all, but rather legiti-mate spirits duly deputized by the supreme gods to punish sinners. Theplague demons of yore now became transfigured into deities acting asemissaries of divine justice.The Daoist literature of the Era of Disunion spells out in detail thenames, titles, and functions of these plague deities. Among the lengthyrosters of demons recorded in the Demon Register of Nüqing,a Celes-tial Masters text believed to date from the late fourth century, we findfive “demon masters of the Five Directions” (wufang guizhu)dispatchedby the supreme deities to punish the wicked and eradicate evil from theworld of mortals. Each of the demon masters commands legions of plaguedemons who visit maladies on sinners (table 1).61Knowledge of the es-oteric names of the demons and deities responsible for particular typesof ailment or affliction that were recorded in the Demon Register ofNüqingenabled priests to heal the sick by summoning spirit warriors torepel the invading demons.62The origin of these five demon masters isobscure, but most probably they derived from a conflation of fears ofwandering ghosts and popular god cults. Especially prominent in the de-monology of the Celestial Masters are the “ghosts of the five tombs”(wumu zhi gui), who were associated with both vexed ancestral spiritsand also victims of “fire, flood, calamity, bandits, and exposure.”Whereas the former brought curses down upon their descendants by filing“sepulchral suits” with the gods of the underworld, the latter were venge-ful ghosts condemned to remain in the mortal world because their corpsesdid not receive proper burial. Both were malignant specters whose touchcaused sickness and death.63Some of the demon masters, notably the martial spirit Zhao Gong-ming, apparently acquired a place in the popular pantheon.

Gan’scomment on this story mentions a “sorcerer’s book” that depicts ZhaoGongming and Zhong Shiji as warriors dispatched by the SupremeThearch to claim the souls of those about to die.64This brief referencemakes no mention of plague, but it suggests that Zhao Gongming, in hisrole as the grim reaper, had already acquired some notoriety in lay society.Tao Hongjing, the eminent scholar and conservator of the manuscriptsof the Shangqing revelations, included in his Declarations of the Perfectedwhat he believed to be a spurious document that identifies “Zhao Gong-ming and the others spirits of the Five Directions” as tomb spirits whocause harm to the living. In his notes on this document, Tao observedthat Zhao Gongming was listed as a plague demon (wengui)in the Pro-tocols of the Twelve Hundred Officers (Qian erbai guanyi).65The actualtext of the Protocols no longer exists, but it is believed to have been oneof the original revealed texts of the Celestial Masters, containing thenames and ranks of the entire celestial pantheon.66On the basis of thisattribution it seems likely that the pentad of Zhao Gongming et aliawasnone other than the “plague demons of the Five Directions” (wufangyigui)that appeared as the objects of popular New Year’s exorcisms inthe Han dynasty. Support for this association comes from a much latersource, a fourteenth-century hagiography of Zhang Daoling, revered bythe Celestial Masters as the founder and patriarch of their religion. Inthis account, Zhao Gongming and the other demon masters, along withthree other figures who are sometimes substituted for one or another ofthem, are identified as the Eight Demon Marshals. The demon marshalsspread plague among mortals; each of the demon marshals was associ-ated with a particular type of physical ailment, such as fevers, diarrhea,swellings, violent fevers and chills, headaches, and “red eye.” They alsohaunted tombs, harassing filial children who came to pay respects to thedead and stealing offerings intended for their ancestors, and they invadedthe fetuses of pregnant women. Zhang Daoling was said to have usedmagical powers to defeat and destroy the eight marshals and their de-mon hordes. In the end the vanquished demons make a pact with Zhang,vowing they will never again invade the world of mortals.67The closeassociation of this particular group of demons with themes of death, dis-ease, and tombs suggests that this late text perhaps does accurately reflectan early tradition in which malefic demons haunting tombs and ceme-teries are vanquished by, and then enter the service of, righteous gods.The demon masters of plague also appear in the Daoist apocalyptic118Plague Demons and Epidemic Gods"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"literature of the Era of Disunion. The demon masters Liu Yuanda andZhong Shiji are mentioned as the objects of heterodox “blood sacrifice”cults in the Scripture of Divine Incantations,which suggests that theyoriginated as local deities.68A Tang dynasty supplement to the same textmentions not five but six demon masters. They are depicted as martialfigures commanding legions of “demon-specters of the five wounds”(wushang guijing)who spread plague and disease among humankind.69As we saw in chapter 2, Lu Xiujing, the crusading reformer who soughtto purge the Celestial Masters sect of popular superstitions, listed the“demons of the five wounds” among the profane cults that commandedthe allegiance of his benighted contemporaries. Lu did not elaborate onthe nature of these demons, but clearly he perceived them as false godsassociated with violent death. In light of the passage in the Scripture ofDivine Incantations,it seems likely that the “demons of the five wounds”were dead soldiers resurrected as demon warriors in the service of theplague deities. The “five wounds” also recall Chiyou and his five weapons,which reinforces the conclusion that the term is a metaphor for plaguedemons.The depictions of the Five Demon Masters as plague deities in Daoistliterature of the Era of Disunion illustrate the ambiguities attending theoutbreak of plague and illness. The agents of disease were seen as bothdeities and demons or, more precisely, as terrifying demons meting outjust punishments decreed by the celestial gods. Zhao Gongming and theother demon masters probably originated as demonic figures in popularworship, but Daoist lore portrayed them as defeated adversaries of theforces of order who are conscripted into the ranks of celestial legionnaires.Most likely, though, the nuances of this conversion of wanton demonsinto obedient subjects of the celestial gods were lost on the public, whosaw disease strictly in terms of demonic affliction, however well deserved.The Enlarged Quest for the Divine,a religious tract that gained widecurrency in Yuan and Ming times, claimed that the demon masters(identified in this text as the Five Emissaries of Plague) were worshipedon Double Fifth already in the Sui and Tang dynasties.70The same bookcontains an account (probably apocryphal, since no contemporarysources corroborate it) of a dream experience of the Sui emperor Wendi(r. 581–604), in which the emperor was visited by five martial figures.After the emperor described his dream to his chief ministers, the courthistorian identified the apparitions as the Five Emissaries of Plague. Theemperor subsequently awarded official titles to the five deities. Althoughwe have no evidence of popular cults devoted to the Five Emissaries ofPlague Demons and Epidemic Gods119"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"Plague in the Sui and Tang periods, worship of the five plague deities onDouble Fifth during the Song dynasty is well attested, at least for Jiangxiand Hunan in central China. The inhabitants of Lizhou in western Hu-nan, for example, organized Assemblies of the Five Plagues (Wuwenshe)that held annual festivals to ward off epidemic disease. Each cult group(she)attending these assemblies built an elaborately decorated boat inwhich they placed lists of their members’ names and birth dates, alongwith “Buddhist” religious paraphernalia. The boats were then set adrifton waterways to expel the plague deities.71Boat exorcisms later becamecentral features of plague cults in the coastal regions of southeasternChina, such as the Wen Qiong cult in Zhejiang, the Five Emperors (Wudi)cult in Fujian, and the Lords of Pestilence (Wangye) in modern Taiwan.72The boat exorcisms of these plague cults thus made explicit a theme fore-shadowed in the shanxiaodemonology: the need to define and enforcethe boundaries of community and to expel marauding demons beyondthe precincts of this unified community through the intercession of pa-tron deities.The Five Emissaries of Plague were also assimilated into the ThunderMagic rituals of the new Daoist movements of the Song dynasty such asShenxiao (Divine Empyrean), Qingwei (Pure and Sublime), and Tianxin(Celestial Heart).73The Thunder Magic movements arose out of localritual traditions during the tenth and eleventh centuries, but gained na-tional exposure thanks to the zealous patronage of Emperor Huizong (r.1100–25). Huizong sought to secure divine blessings for his rule by cre-ating a Daoist theocracy that derived its inspiration and leadership fromthese local sects. Rooted in the liturgical traditions of Lingbao Daoism,the Thunder Magic sects featured the use of demonifugic powers not onlyin healing the sick, but also to remedy a wide range of social and polit-ical problems. The primacy of Thunder Magic in Song Daoism prompteda wholesale reorientation of Daoist religious practice toward healing bymeans of exorcisms that took the form of judicial inquisition.74The Thunder Magic ritual traditions of the Song departed from thefirm tenet of early Daoism that illness and disease were caused by themoral transgressions of the afflicted person (or his or her ancestors). In-stead, the practitioners of Thunder rites shifted the blame for misfortuneto aberrant demonic agency.75To combat demonic attack they employedan esoteric arsenal of incantations, talismans, and seals to summon, bind,interrogate, and expel the offending spirits. From the fifth century on-ward these techniques had been closely associated with the figure of Beidi,Thearch of the North, who appears in Daoist theology as both ruler of120Plague Demons and Epidemic Gods"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"the underworld and a celestial divinity. Over the course of the Tang dy-nasty various exorcistic practices associated with Beidi coalesced into aset of personal therapies and communal liturgies, which then became in-tegrated into the ritual complexes of the Tianxin and other ThunderMagic movements.76Practitioners of Thunder Magic, who included un-lettered village healers as well as ordained Daoist priests and even gov-ernment officials, invoked one of a number of fierce demonifuge warriorgods to exorcise malevolent demons. Chief among these divine interces-sors were the Four Saints (Sisheng): Beidi (more commonly known in theSong and after by the imperially bestowed title Zhenwu, or True War-rior); Black Killer (Heisha); Heaven’s Mugwort (Tianpeng), whose cu-rious name of course alludes to the plant’s demonifugic properties; andHeavenly Benefaction (Tianyou).77The Thunder Magic liturgies spawneda host of other demonifuge warrior-gods, one of the most important ofwhom was the transfigured chief of the erstwhile Five Demon Masters,Zhao Gongming.The Five Demon Masters appear (sometimes with slight variations inpersonal names) in the Shenxiao and Qingwei exorcism liturgies underthe titles Emissaries of the Five Thearchs (Wudi shizhe) or the Five Emis-saries of Plague (Wuwen shizhe). Zhao Gongming was canonized as oneof the cardinal deities of the Qingwei movement, and also ranked as oneof the Four Grand Marshals (Yuanshuai), the demonifuge spirits featuredin the liturgies promulgated by the thirteenth-century masters of theShenxiao and Qingwei traditions. In this capacity Zhao no longer ap-peared exclusively as a plague deity; instead, he exercised broad domin-ion over the legions of demon warriors abroad in the world. Nonethe-less, the Five Emissaries of Plague were key subordinates of Zhao(Zhao’s place among the five was taken by a new figure; see table 1). Atleast one Daoist plague exorcism liturgy was exclusively devoted to ZhangYuanbo.78Although these plague deities were heralded in the ThunderMagic scriptures as benefactors of humanity, in the theology of apoca-lyptic sects they reprised their older role as avenging messengers ofdoom.79It was during the Song dynasty, too, that the Five Emissaries of Plagueacquired definitive iconographic forms. The legend about the Sui em-peror’s dream preserved in the Enlarged Quest for the Divinedescribeseach of the five deities as possessing a distinct type of weapon: 1) ladleand urn, 2) leather bag and sword, 3) fan, 4) hammer, and 5) fire gourd.These magic weapons, though clearly different from the five weapons ofChiyou portrayed in Han art, were reputed to be highly efficacious inPlague Demons and Epidemic Gods121"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"combating plague demons; the ladle and urn and the hammer, as we haveobserved, appear in Han murals depicting exorcisms (figure 14).80TheBook of Transformations,a hagiography of the divinity Zitong said tohave been revealed to a medium in 1181, introduces the Five Emissariesof Plague bearing feathered insignia representing their “weapons of fireand water, and axe and chisel.” This text also depicts the five emissariesas human-beast hybrids, each with a different animal head: tiger, cock,human, crow, and donkey.81A thirteenth-century Thunder Magic liturgydevoted to Zhao Gongming likewise describes the Five Emissaries as hav-ing animal forms, though the types of animals differ somewhat (tiger,cock, pig, horse, and “demonic visage” [guixiang]).82These iconographicmotifs also are present in a section of a liturgical painting for the Bud-dhist Land-and-Water Mass believed to date from the second half of thefifteenth century. Here the plague deities, who are identified in the ac-companying cartouche as the “Five Emissaries of Plague who rule thedemon kings of illness,” appear in the forms of: 1) a crow with a sword,2) a horse holding a gourd (the horse is surrounded by flames, whichsuggests that the gourd is a fire-gourd), 3) a cock with mallet and awl,4) a tiger with a fan, and 5) an anthropoid demon with a ladle and bucket(figure 16).83The weapons shown here are identical to those mentionedin the Enlarged Quest for the Divineand probably those alluded to inThe Book of Transformationsas well, while the animal heads essentiallycorrespond to both texts. Although the iconography of the Five Emis-saries of Plague was by no means exactly uniform, the generic consis-tencies suggest that a well-established iconographic repertoire had spreadthroughout both north and south China by the fifteenth century, andprobably as early as the Song dynasty. This iconography shows that theerstwhile plague demons had become fully rehabilitated; they were nolonger seen as scourges, but rather as benevolent spirits who exorcisedthe demons afflicting the sick.Another spirit who defended mortals against demons of illness andepidemic was the demon queller Zhong Kui. The cult of Zhong Kui com-monly is said to have begun with, or at least been popularized by, theTang emperor Xuanzong (r. 712–55).84Bedridden from illness, Xuan-zong had a dream encounter with the demon afflicting him in which afearsome spirit suddenly appeared and seized the demon, gouged out themiscreant’s eyes, and then devoured it. The emperor’s rescuer identifiedhimself as Zhong Kui and said that in his mortal life he had committedsuicide after failing to earn high honors in the civil service examinations,but he was awarded posthumous honors by the second Tang emperor122Plague Demons and Epidemic Gods"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"and thus pledged to devote himself to eradicating demons. Upon recov-ering from his illness shortly afterward, Xuanzong instructed the re-nowned artist Wu Daozi to paint an image of Zhong Kui based on theemperor’s dream vision. The emperor was greatly pleased with Wu’s ren-dering of Zhong Kui and subsequently had court painters producecopies that the emperor presented as New Year’s gifts to favored courtiers.There is compelling evidence that the demonifuge Zhong Kui ante-dated the Tang dynasty, however. In Ma Rong’s lyric on the Great Ex-orcism of the Han court the troupe of exorcists flourishes hammersknown as zhongkuiin the ritual drama of expelling demons. Though writ-ten with different graphs, this zhongkuiis a close homonym of the nameZhong Kui, and it is possible that the spirit’s unusual name derived fromthese magical hammers (which, as exorcism texts of the Han era show,were believed to be efficacious weapons against plague demons). Thesixth-century millenarian tract Scripture of the Divine Incantationsin-vokes the spirit warrior Zhong Kui to exterminate the demon hordes be-setting humanity, which suggests that the spirit may have already emergedas the object of a popular cult at that time.85But in the Tang and after-ward Zhong Kui was invariably associated with the expulsion of demonson the eve of the New Year, in essence succeeding to the role of the fang-xiangexorcist in the ancient Nuo rites. New Year’s Eve spectacles in theSong period commonly featured a theatrical rite of exorcism known asthe “Dance of Zhong Kui” that was performed before imperial as wellas popular audiences.86In addition, beggars, perhaps mimicking theseexorcistic rites, dressed themselves as Zhong Kui and his company ofdemons on New Year’s Eve and marched through the streets of the cap-ital striking drums and cymbals, stopping at each gate to extort paymentbefore moving on to the next house.87The beggars’ processions invertedthe apotropaic rites of the New Year season. Instead of summoning ZhongKui in his role as a demon tamer, the beggars masqueraded as ZhongKui and other spirits associated with plague and death in order to wringbribes from the cowed populace.Hanging a painted or printed illustration of Zhong Kui above the doorgate on the eve of the New Year became virtually a universal custom inSong times.88Indeed, nearly all references to Zhong Kui in Tang-Songtimes pertain to these portraits.89Zhong Kui never became an indepen-dent deity, an object of sacrifice and prayer with his own shrines. Instead,Zhong Kui’s demon-quelling powers were channeled through the talis-mans bearing his image. These mass-produced etchings and prints prob-ably descended from Wu Daozi’s famous painting of Zhong Kui, whichPlague Demons and Epidemic Gods123"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"had been widely copied and disseminated. Although none of Wu Daozi’sworks, including his portrait of Zhong Kui, survive, a tenth-century au-thor described Wu’s painting as follows:In Wu Daozi’s painting, Zhong Kui wears a blue robe and a leather booton one foot. He has but one eye, with a tablet of official rank at his waist.His head is wrapped in a turban, his beard askew, and his hair hangs downunbound. He grasps a demon in his left hand, and with the second finger ofhis right hand he is gouging the eye of the demon.90Zhong Kui was a popular motif in literati painting during the Songand subsequent dynasties, yet surviving literati paintings from this erabear no resemblance to this description. Instead, they typically depictZhong Kui in scholar’s robes escorted by a procession of grotesquedemons (figure 17).91These paintings, which often evoke Zhong Kui asan alter ego of the neglected and despised scholar, probably were mod-eled after the New Year’s Eve beggars’ processions. A better likeness ofZhong Kui as Wu Daozi painted him can be found appended to ZhongKui’s hagiography in the Yuan dynasty religious primer Enlarged Questfor the Divine(figure 18). In this illustration a ferocious Zhong Kui isportrayed in the act of gouging out the eye of the demon, and this self-contained scene was surely more suitable for door-guardian images thanthe elaborate processions found in the hand scrolls composed by literatiartists.92The use of images of Zhong Kui as protective talismans to guard thehome against demonic invasion recalls the legend that Huangdi had por-traits made of his fearsome lieutenant Chiyou in order to intimidate crim-inals and instill a proper fear of the law. Both artistic and literary repre-sentations of Zhong Kui (again like the ancient Chiyou) emphasized hisrepellent ugliness, and his baleful visage no doubt is what endowed thesetalismans with apotropaic power.

As his popularity grew Zhong Kui evolved into a genericdemonifuge, but on the evidence of early accounts, most famously Em-peror Xuanzong’s dream, the Zhong Kui cult in its initial form wasspecifically dedicated to exorcising demons of plague and illness.The Song dynasty also witnessed the development of specialized plaguecults centered on local deities. One who achieved lasting fame as a pro-tector against epidemic disease was Wen Qiong, whose cult originated inthe eponymous town of Wenzhou, on the coast of southern Zhejiangprovince.93Wenzhou also was the birthplace of the Shenxiao movement,which became the foundation of Emperor Huizong’s theocracy in theearly twelfth century, and the Shenxiao priesthood seems to have playeda prominent role in the propagation of Wen Qiong’s cult. A Shenxiaohagiography of Wen Qiong written in 1274 portrays Wen as an ordinarymortal renowned for his martial prowess who upon his death was in-ducted into the ranks of officials in the underworld government of theLord of Mount Tai. Although the apotheosized Wen Qiong was said tohave refused temples dedicated to him personally, in Huizong’s day localDaoist priests in Wenzhou repeatedly invoked Wen’s aid to repel noxiousdemons afflicting the local community. The emphasis on Wen Qiong’shumility and orthodox credentials (the author of the hagiography at-tributed the founding of Wen Qiong’s cult to the contemporary patri-arch of the Celestial Masters tradition, the official Daoist church) beliesWen Qiong’s true origins as a popular deity who lacked the sanction oforganized religion. In all of the Wen Qiong myths Wen dies young andby violent means, which of course conforms to the archetype of the venge-ful ghost. The Wen Qiong mythology also bears traces of an older in-carnation of Wen as a serpent deity, very possibly a demon who spreadpestilence among the people. Paul Katz suggests that Wen Qiong, likeother demonic figures, probably originated as a vengeful ghost turnedinto a plague demon, only to be rehabilitated and converted into a propergod by the priests of the Shenxiao sect.94Local lore in Wenzhou por-trayed Wen Qiong as a heroic martyr who disobeyed a divine com-mandment to poison sinful mortals and instead swallowed the poisonhimself, causing him to metamorphose into a fierce demon figure. Thesupreme deity, moved by Wen’s self-sacrifice, assigned him to the retinueof the great demon-quelling god Zhenwu, who employed Wen to rootout and expel plague demons.128Plague Demons and Epidemic Gods"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"The development of the Wen Qiong cult thus sprang from the inter-section of a local ritual tradition with the kind of popular god cult Daoistsusually spurned as vulgar superstition. Katz argues that the case of WenQiong attests to a process of “reverberation” whereby a cult is createdthrough reciprocal interaction between popular worship on one hand andappropriation and codification of such cults by religious specialists onthe other.95The production of a corpus of ritual, myth, and iconogra-phy paved the way for inclusion of such popular cults in canonical reli-gion, which in turn conferred legitimacy on the cult. Such was the powerof canonization and bureaucratic rank, which erased the ambiguous iden-tity of nefarious spirits and recuperated them into the phalanx of impe-rial order.96A similar process of incorporation and reverberation occurredin the transformation of Wutong from malicious demon to benevolentdeity. In its earliest incarnation, Wutong became a tutelary deity who pro-tected local communities from plague. Yet the ambivalence surroundingthe god’s true nature was never resolved. In many parts of south Chinaduring the late imperial period plague cults emerged that featured setsof five spirits, local variations on the archetype of the Five Emissaries ofPlague. Several of these groups bore the distinct imprint of the Wutonglegacy.

Economic ex-pansion generated abundant wealth, and possession of wealth endowedgreater social distinction. Confucianism recaptured the intellectual alle-giance of the ruling class, yet at the same time Buddhism became fullydomesticated within Chinese society and culture. New social and cul-tural opportunities afforded by the growth of cities, burgeoning merchantand artisan classes, and the dissemination of printing gave birth to anintensely vital “commoner culture.” All of these developments reshapedreligious life.Most profound of all of these changes was the shift in the center ofgravity of Chinese civilization from the Yellow River valley in the northto the Yangzi valley in the south. Civil war and invasions of steppe no-mads wracked north China from the onset of the An Lushan rebellion(755–63) to the turn of the eleventh century, provoking massive migra-tions to the Yangzi River basin and the southern coast. In 750, two-thirdsof the population of the Chinese empire lived in the north, and only one-third in the south; by 1100, that ratio had reversed, and the south hasremained more populous than the north to the present day. The primacy130"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"of the south reached its apogee following the conquest of north China,including the whole of the Yellow River valley, by Jurchen invaders in1127. Remnants of the imperial family continued the Song dynasty afterreestablishing their court at Hangzhou, at the southern terminus of theGrand Canal. During the Southern Song period (1127–1276), whichended with the even more humiliating conquest of all of China by theMongols, the Chinese empire barely extended beyond the northern bankof the Yangzi River.Intensive settlement and domestication of the southern frontier trans-formed the livelihood and material culture of the Chinese people. Ricereplaced wheat and millet as the staple food; the abundant natural andman-made waterways of the south encouraged mobility and trade; andsouthern products like tea, sugar, porcelain, silk, and later cotton en-gendered new industries and new patterns of consumption. The un-precedented growth of cities and towns, which widened circulation ofgoods and enabled the acquisition of great fortunes through landown-ing and commerce, exerted a profound impact not only on social andeconomic life, but on religious culture as well.Economic change also wrought a wholesale transformation of the so-cial order. The aristocracy that had dominated Chinese society and gov-ernment since the Han dynasty lost its political and economic privilegesin the aftermath of the collapse of the Tang imperium. Most aristocraticfamilies failed to adapt to the rising market economy, and the establish-ment of the civil service examinations as the primary instrument of officialrecruitment inhibited perpetuation of social station through hereditaryrights to political office. The dissolution of the medieval aristocracystrengthened autocratic rule at the center and fostered the developmentof provincial elites whose social base remained rooted in local society,not the capital. Like the aristocracy of yore, these provincial elites de-rived their social status from landed wealth, investment in education, andendogamous marriage alliances. But henceforth the social and spatial di-mensions of elite power were more spatially circumscribed, and oftenconfined to the local level. Although these provincial elites exhibited re-markable durability and stability, the vicissitudes of examination successprecluded the re-creation of aristocratic society, either at the national orat the local level.1One consequence of the spatial transformation of the Chinese empirewas the emergence of the Jiangnan region—the southern half of the YangziDelta, stretching from Nanjing on the bank of the Yangzi River south-ward to Ningbo on the seacoast—as its economic heartland (see map 2).2Song Transformation of Religious Culture131"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"Although Nanjing had served as capital of the Chinese dynasties duringthe Era of Disunion, the delta’s economic potential was not fully exploiteduntil massive waves of immigrants from the north arrived in the late Tangand early Song periods.

The delta’s dense network of canals, initially builtto drain the marshes, also served as arteries of trade and transport. Theready availability of cheap water transport in the south, and especially inthe Jiangnan region, facilitated rural-urban exchange and interregionaltrade, making south China the most dynamic economy in the world.3The urban landscape was also transformed.

Marketsand residential quarters in Song cities no longer were encumbered bywalled enclosures. Freedom of movement spawned a profusion of bazaarsand craftsmen’s alleys inside the city walls and out, as well as a subur-ban sprawl of wharves, warehouses, inns, taverns, and wholesalers’shops. In addition to the capital at Hangzhou, other great cities of theSouthern Song—like Suzhou, Jiankang (modern Nanjing), Yangzhou, andNingbo—continued to serve as important seats of government. Yet thelifeblood of these cities flowed through their commercial veins.Commercial expansion also fostered the development of markettowns with minimal or no official presence. These market towns sprangup along the Grand Canal between Yangzhou and Hangzhou and alongother avenues of trade crisscrossing the delta. In addition, foreign tradeand interregional domestic shipping stimulated the growth of seaportsall along the coast from the Yangzi Delta southward to Canton. Markettown development facilitated mobilization of rural produce destined fordistant markets, and also provided villagers with a wide range of con-sumer goods. At the close of the Song dynasty, Fang Hui (1227–1307),a scholar-official from rugged upland country to the west, marveled atthe prosperity of towns and villages in the plains of the Yangzi Delta, ob-serving that villagers bringing rural produce to sell in the market townreturned home laden with “incense, candles, paper offerings for the spir-its (zhima), cooking oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, flour, noodles, pepper,ginger, and medicines.”4The striking presence of religious parapherna-lia like incense, candles, and ritual offerings at the head of this list co-gently reveals the importance of towns and commerce in the religious aswell as economic life of the countryside.Indeed, cities and towns dominated religious life as much as otherspheres of social activity. Hangzhou, Suzhou, and Ningbo boasted mag-nificent temples both within the cities and in their surrounding hinter-lands. Though Buddhist monasteries were often located in more tranquilsettings in the hills, other temples, especially Daoist shrines and the tem-ples of local tutelary deities, were almost always found within theprecincts of towns. “Buddhism and Daoism flourish in Hangzhou morethan anywhere else,” wrote a local historian.5Urban temples thrived inconcert with the burgeoning fortunes of smaller market towns, too. Theseaport of Qinglong, located on the Wusong River, the main waterwayconnecting the inland cities of Suzhou and Songjiang with the ocean, en-joyed a remarkable growth spurt during the twelfth century, becominghome to so many “rich merchants and powerful lineages” that contem-Song Transformation of Religious Culture133"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"poraries described it as “Little Hangzhou.” The town also became fa-mous for its splendid architecture and the “three pavilions, seven pago-das, and thirteen Buddhist monasteries” that towered over “the hearthsof ten thousand families.” Magnificent religious edifices dominated thelandscape and social life of towns like Qinglong, just as they did the cathe-dral towns of medieval Europe.6The exuberance of the Song economy thus had a direct and pervasiveimpact on religious life. It has become commonplace for historians toconclude that the economic prosperity of the Song engendered a risingconfidence in the power of mortals to manipulate the gods and thus shapetheir own destiny. Valerie Hansen has argued that the commercializationof the Song economy reshaped the religious landscape as merchants,through patronage of temples and dissemination of cults throughout tradenetworks, imprinted their own distinctive ethos on the character of thegods.7David Johnson likewise has suggested that the proliferation ofchenghuang(commonly translated as “city god”) temples from the lateTang onward resulted from merchant sponsorship.8Yet these hypothe-ses rest on slender pillars of evidence. The mere appearance of templesin centers of trade does not mean that merchants played a unique or dom-inant role in founding temples and propagating cults. Nor did the greateraccessibility of these gods, made possible by the spread of simple and di-rect techniques of communication with the gods, necessarily reflect a pos-itivist faith in human dominion over the divine. It would be just as plau-sible to assert that the proliferation of such techniques resulted fromanxiety about the individual’s fate that prompted a desperate resort todivine forces in the hope of finding security in an increasingly competi-tive and mobile society.The vernacular religious universe on the eve of the convulsive trans-formations of the Song era can be most readily glimpsed through GlenDudbridge’s reconstruction of the folklore anthology Wide World of Mar-velscomposed by Dai Fu (fl. ca. 734–81).9Virtually all of Dai Fu’s an-ecdotes involve breaches of the margins between the seen and unseenrealms, especially the boundary between life and death. A prominenttheme coursing through Dai’s stories is the notion that the institutionsand practices created to regulate contact with the unseen worlds such asmortuary ritual, sacrifice, and acts of piety cannot wholly control irreg-ular transgressions of these boundaries.10Ghosts, demons, and change-lings abound in this world; the farther one ventures from the civilizeddomain of home and town, the greater the likelihood of chance en-counters with them. The home itself is portrayed as a fortress defended134Song Transformation of Religious Culture"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"against malign attack by an elaborate staff of household spirits arrayedacross space (the well, stove, gate, commode) and time (different hoursof the day and months of the year).11The supreme celestial gods are seenas remote figures; like the human emperor, they pay little heed to the pettytribulations of their subjects. Instead, ordinary people must arm them-selves against these potentially deadly encounters with spirits by acquiringthe weaponry of religious specialists like spells and talismans. Widely dis-seminated Buddhist tracts like the Diamond SÜtra (Jin’gangjing)andHeart SÜtra (Xinjing), Tantric mantras, Daoist spells, and invocation ofthe Buddhist divinity Guanyin (on which see below) were deployed bylaypersons as well as priests and monks to ward off demonic affliction.This vernacularization of ritual mechanisms, already underway in DaiFu’s day, becomes a defining feature of Song religious culture.The pervasive fear of unseen powers that animated much of the pop-ular religious imagination is most apparent in the growing concern withsin and punishment. Many of Dai Fu’s tales dwell on the exercise of jus-tice by the underworld bureaucracy. Penitence and the burden of karmicsin remained abiding features of Song religiosity, perhaps even more sothan before. The cult of the dead had been central to Chinese religionfrom earliest times, but by the tenth century it had evolved into elabo-rate, indeed baroque, forms. The Daoist movements of the Era of Dis-union had affirmed the Han vision of the underworld as a gigantic ap-paratus of civil and military control. In the Declarations of the Perfected,Tao Hongjing described an underworld divided into six great chambers,each supervised by its own complement of record keepers and inquisi-tors, all under the ultimate authority of Beidi, Thearch of the North (thedirection of death and malign influence in Five Phases cosmology). Al-though Tao identified the six chambers with the fell Six Heavens, sourceof malefic emanations and bane to all mortals, he construed this infer-nal realm as a place of judgment, not corporal torment.12From aroundthe seventh century Buddhist ideas fused with indigenous eschatologyinto a new concept of the afterlife centered on purgatorial punishment.Indian lore describing the gruesome tortures that befell the unfortunatedead (preta)became wedded to the terrifying prospect of official inves-tigation, interrogation, and torture, producing a nightmarish vision ofthe afterlife in the form of the Courts of the Ten Infernal Kings.13Drawn from both Buddhist and Chinese mythology, the Ten Kingswere conceived as imperial officials presiding over law courts replete withscribes, bailiffs, and the “ox-headyakãa” jailers of Indian myth. Soulsof the dead appeared before each of the Ten Kings in turn and were sub-Song Transformation of Religious Culture135"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"jected to rigorous examination of their mortal conduct. Retribution forsin was meted out through grisly corporal punishment. The “forest ofswords,” “fire wheels,” and “bronze pillars” of Indian mythology weretranslated literally into instruments of torture: the infernal executionerspounded the bodies of sinners into paste with mortars and pestles; flungthem into cauldrons of boiling oil; impaled adulterers on swords; andcut out the tongues of slanderers. The operation of karmic retribution,once a purely automatic process that determined the nature of the indi-vidual’s subsequent rebirth, now became a purgatorial ordeal mediatedby the underworld bureaucracy. Yet this image of the gods of the under-world as stern and upright officials was tinged with suspicion of gov-ernment incompetence and malfeasance. The ample folklore concerningdeath and descent to the underworld, like the Han ordinances for thedead, was suffused with stark fears that death and infernal punishmentmight result from clerical errors and venal abuse of power rather thanbe meted out as just punishment for sin.The intensification of this baroque cult of death stimulated the growthof salvific cults specifically focused on rescuing the souls of the dead fromthe torments of the underworld. In the Scripture of the Ten Kings,a non-canonical Buddhist tract that circulated widely beginning in the tenth cen-tury, the Ten Kings occupied positions subordinate to the bodhisattvaKãitigarbha (Dizang), whose compassion for the inmates of purgatorycould overturn the judgments of the underworld tribunes. In Daoist the-ology the role of Kãitigarbha as bodhisattva of the underworld was as-sumed by the Supreme Heavenly Worthy Who Delivers Sinners from Suf-fering (Taiyi jiuku tianzun).14The cults of Kãitigarbha and Jiuku tianzunoffered solace by holding out the possibility of escaping the net of karmathrough contrition, repentance, and faith in the power of a compassionatesavior.This new concept of purgatory was propagated not only through textslike the Scripture of the Ten Kings (which circulated in many variant edi-tions, often in pocket-sized breviary form), but also through visual im-agery (figure 19). “Transformation images” (bianxiang), didactic muralsfor religious contemplation and devotion painted on the walls of monas-teries and shrines, often illustrated the “subterranean prisons” of the af-terlife.15The painter Wu Daozi, who won great fame for his vivid por-traiture, executed a series of bianxiangof the underworld at Chang’an’sZhao Jinggong Monastery in 736 that inspired universal imitation. Al-though Wu Daozi’s murals do not survive, the remarkable statuary atthe Southern Song rock temple at Baodingshan Grotto in Dazu, Sichuan136Song Transformation of Religious Culture"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"province, powerfully evokes the sense of foreboding and terror ascribedto Wu’s rendition of the torments of hell (figure 20).

Below the ten kings, at eye level withviewers, are two tiers of scenes illustrating the eighteen hells of the nether-world. The predominant theme of this tableau is the punishment metedout for violating Buddhist prohibitions against speaking falsehoods andconsuming wine and meat. The group of sculptures shown in figure 20,for example, features grisly scenes of the punishments that await thosewho, like the couple seated at the table, defy the taboo against eatingmeat (the servant to their right is butchering a lamb for their dinner).Just as vivid imagery was used to convey the pain of torment in hell,deliverance from infernal punishment often depended on the miraculouspowers inhering in physical images of the savior gods. Miracles evokedthrough veneration of paintings, statutes, and murals of Guanyin, Kãit-igarbha, and Jiuku tianzun were set down in books entitled Anthologiesof Verified Miracles (Lingyanji).17In one such tale, recorded in the Recordof Verified Miracles of the Daoist Teachingsby Du Guangting (850–933),a wayward Daoist cleric by the name of Zhang Renbiao dreams of a visitto an underworld in which he encounters hideous monsters “truly likethose in paintings of the ‘subterranean prisons’ one sees in the mortalworld.” Terrified, Zhang repeatedly intones the name of Jiuku tianzun,but his captors laugh at this belated attempt to ward off divine retribu-tion. When he is taken before the majestic Jiuku tianzun, Zhang pros-trates himself, confesses his sins, and vows repentance. After deliveringa stern rebuke, Jiuku tianzun forgives the priest’s sins and restores himto life with the admonition to propagate images of the deity in order toconvert others to right religion.18Deepening fears of the charnel horrors of the underworld also wereexpressed through the elaboration of mortuary ritual. A major portionof both hieratic and lay rituals and observances was devoted to purga-tion of sin and absolution from (or at least alleviation of) suffering inthe afterlife. By the sixth century Daoist priests had expanded funeraryrites to include a series of ten memorial services (one for each of the firstseven weeks after the passing of the deceased, and subsequently on thehundredth-day, first-year, and third-year anniversaries), which Buddhistsalso adopted. These memorial services, whose origins can be traced toboth Daoist confessionals and Buddhist monastic practice, took the formof rituals of penitence and absolution in which priests invoked saviordeities to help the deceased rid themselves of karmic sin and gain rebirthin (or ascension to) paradise. Daoist priests performed rituals like the138Song Transformation of Religious Culture"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Yellow Register Rite (Huanglu zhai) and the Nine Shades Rite (Jiuyouzhai) in the course of these memorial services.

The endowments of land and fundsattached to the grave chapels ensured the continuation of ancestralsacrifices in perpetuity, even if latter-day descendants should neglect them.In the Song period, sacrifices to the ancestors were commonly offered atthe grave site rather than at the ancestral temple, despite the opprobriumof ritual specialists. Fang Hui observed that numerous icons of Buddhistand Daoist divinities—among which paintings of the bodhisattva Guanyinwere the most prominent—were installed in these grave chapels.22Tomb furnishings also underwent significant change during the Tang-Song transitional period. In the eighth century smaller, more intimatetombs that mimicked domestic architecture and furnishings began toeclipse the estates, palaces, and public gatherings depicted in the moregrandiose brick-vaulted tombs prevalent in the Sui and the early Tang.23The sets of tomb guardians (either ferocious human-beast hybrid crea-tures or heavily armed human warriors) ubiquitous in tombs of the Eraof Disunion and the Sui and early Tang periods disappeared by Songtimes. Song tombs were equipped with fine objects of daily use such assilver and porcelain vessels, gold and silver jewelry, and writing utensils,in contrast to the crude ceramic replicas that had predominated since theHan. One interpretation of this shift in mortuary practice suggests thatfears of postmortem punishment were receding and that the upperclasses of the Song, whose lives revolved around pursuit of success in thecivil service examinations, had greater aspirations for attaining eminentstation in the realm of the afterlife.24Indeed, there is literary evidencesuggesting that Song literati and officials entertained expectations of re-ceiving appointment and rank in the celestial pantheon commensuratewith their achievements in their mortal lives.25Yet the baroque elabora-tion of the underworld and its torments clearly demonstrates that fearof retribution in the afterlife, far from abating, had intensified. The tombitself was no longer the site of postmortem incarceration, however. In-stead, the tomb served as a transitional space, a liminal junction on thejourney to the infernal regions of the Ten Kings, rather than a perma-nent resting place for the soul of the deceased. The domestic motifs andarchitecture so notable in north China tombs during the Northern Song,Liao, Jin, and Yuan are virtually absent from Southern Song tombs.26Al-though the domestic comforts and familial intimacy represented inNorthern Song tombs may have alluded to enduring ideals of conjugal,filial, and ancestral devotion, they hardly mitigated the prospect of di-vine retribution and punishment.140Song Transformation of Religious Culture"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"It was in the Song period, too, that Chinese began to quantify the bur-den of sin in an effort to alleviate punishment in the afterlife. The ledgersof merit and demerit that first appeared in the twelfth century assignedevil acts a specific moral value and prescribed good works to redeem one’ssins.27An alternative approach involved measuring sin in monetary termsand purchasing redemption by burning spirit money (ritual offerings inthe form of paper money), thus ensuring a positive karmic balance. DaiFu’s anecdotes attest to the widespread use of spirit money already inthe Tang. Spirits of the underworld in Dai’s stories inform mortals thattransactions in the world of the dead, no less than among the living, re-quire the accumulation and expenditure of money.28In Tang stories, of-ferings of spirit money were intended for souls of the dead, to enablethem to purchase partial redemption for their sins and alleviation of in-fernal punishment. In Southern Song Daoist liturgy, spirit money was alsoemployed to ward off affliction and death by making contributions toone’s fund of “original destiny” (benming). This practice derived fromthe idea that at birth each individual receives a sum of fortune (often ex-pressed in monetary terms) that determines his or her destiny (life span,social station, and material well-being) in that lifetime. People can aug-ment their stock of “original destiny” by making deposits in the form ofspirit money offerings to their accounts in the celestial treasury. This typeof ritual action also allowed individuals to build up a reserve of goodfortune that could be used to allay punishment in the afterlife, lesseningtheir dependence on offerings provided by descendants.29From as early as the Warring States period folklore about death andthe afterlife was often propagated in the form of return-from-the-gravetales in which a mortal, wrongly summoned to the world of the dead,returns to the realm of the living and delivers a first-hand report of allhe or she witnessed.30Return-from-the-grave narratives became a stan-dard literary genre from the sixth century onward. Although these sto-ries tended to recapitulate generic, and hence literary or doctrinal, con-ventions (as we have seen in Du Guangting’s anecdote about ZhangRenbiao), they also provide us with our most direct evidence of popularbeliefs about the uncertain fate of the dead. An episode recorded in Talesof the Listenerexemplifies beliefs about death and purgatory current inSong times.31The story concerns the visions of the twelve-year-old sonof Madame Zhao, wife of a local prefect named Wei Liangchen who in1155–56 would be appointed councilor of state, the highest office in theland. Madame Zhao died in 1151, and her family invited an eminentDaoist priest to perform the memorial services for her.32In the course ofSong Transformation of Religious Culture141"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"a Yellow Register Rite performed on the fifth of the seven-day memorialservices, Madame Zhao’s son has a vision of his mother in the ritualchamber and falls into a trance in which he sees celestial spirits arriveand receive the memorial sent up to the gods by the priest. That nightthe boy dreams that he is summoned to the palace of Jiuku tianzun tobear witness to the execution of justice. Awestruck, the boy watches asa host of sinners shackled in iron fetters is led into the court and theneach is dispatched to the appropriate subterranean prison. The god in-structs the boy on the procedures of the underworld bureaucracy: helearns the importance of solemnity and scrupulous adherence to detailin the performance of ritual; that sinners can be relieved of their suffer-ing only through proper procedures spelled out in Daoist scriptures;33and that the officials of the underworld are to be called only by their bu-reaucratic titles, not by their former mortal names. As in all stories ofthis type, the boy is urged to report all he has seen when he returns tothe world of the living, in order to enlighten others. During his tour ofthe underworld the boy discovers that a series of ritual errors haveblunted the efficacy of the memorial services dedicated to his mother.Upon awakening he alerts his father to these discrepancies, includingthe placement of the altar too close to the kitchen; the presence of chil-dren at play; the employment of ritually tainted persons (in this instance,an old soldier with scabies) as attendants at the rite; and a miswrittenword in the memorial dispatched by the priest to the gods. Once theseproblems are corrected, the rite is completed successfully. The boy’s abil-ity to identify these problems verifies the authenticity of his visions ofthe underworld. Though this trope was a long-standing literary con-vention, there is little doubt that such return-from-death experienceswere commonplace and readily accepted as genuine. With each reen-actment, belief in this vision of the underworld was freshly imprintedon the popular imagination.The baroque elaboration of the tribulations of purgatory attested toabiding anxieties about not only one’s own postmortem fate, but espe-cially that of one’s ancestors. Such concerns were most keenly expressedthrough the mythology and ritual practices centering on the figure of Mu-lian (Skt. Maudgalyayana), a disciple of the Buddha who became uni-versally acclaimed in Chinese culture as the paragon of filial devotion tothe salvation of ancestors. In Tang and Song times, Mulian was closelyassociated with the Avalambana Feast (popularly known as the GhostFestival) held on the fifteenth day of the seventh lunar month to allevi-ate the suffering of sinners in purgatory. The myth of Mulian’s epic strug-142Song Transformation of Religious Culture"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"gle to rescue his mother from the most abysmal of the manifold Bud-dhist hells and ensure her rebirth in paradise was propagated throughvernacular narratives known as “transformation scripts” (bianwen),which—like bianxiangillustrations—were widely employed by Tangmonks as evangelical tools. Although various aspects of Mulian’s heroicquest appear in Buddhist scriptures and morality tales originating in In-dia, the classic version of his story found in the “transformation script”narratives (and later in popular drama as well) was a product of the Chi-nese milieu. The bianwentales feature Mulian’s protracted journeysthrough the labyrinthine underworld in search of his mother and his en-counters with various deities and groups of woeful sinners. Finally hediscovers his mother in the most ghastly hell of all—the Avíci Hell, whereshe is impaled on a bed of nails in perpetuity for refusing to give alms toa mendicant monk. Though Mulian, as an advanced disciple of the Bud-dha, possesses formidable magical powers, he is unable to obtain her de-liverance solely through his own efforts. Yet by combining his own rit-ual practice (magnified by his stature as a monk and a disciple of theBuddha), the merit-earning piety of the Buddhist faithful, and the sav-ing power of the Buddha himself, Mulian ultimately wins his mother’srelease from hell and the lower paths of reincarnation and she is rebornin paradise.34The Mulian story thus reconciled the perennial tension between Bud-dhist renunciation of the world and Chinese filial piety. Through faith,charity, and ritual effort the dutiful son and devout disciple of the Bud-dha succeeds in abrogating the laws of karma and expiating his mother’ssins. The Mulian story also resolves another persistent tension in Chi-nese religion, the uneasy relationship between the ancestors and the le-gions of dead souls unrelated by kinship (i.e., ghosts). The Mulian bian-wenand the Buddhist Avalambana Feast both champion the bodhisattvaideal of universal salvation, advocating devotion not only to one’s ownparents but also to all sinners. The bianwenpointedly teach that Chineserites of ancestor worship are utterly ineffective, and only Buddhist pietycan bring any comfort to sinners in purgatory. Nonetheless, the Mulianmythology often was separated from its original soteriological contextand integrated into mortuary practices focused exclusively on the an-cestors. Reenactment of the Mulian story through dramatic performancebecame an essential part of Chinese funeral rites.35Its universal popu-larity testified to the intense anxiety about the fate of the ancestors pro-voked by Buddhist eschatology.As a catechetical device, the Mulian story was aimed primarily at anSong Transformation of Religious Culture143"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"audience of pious laity rather than clergy. In its emphasis on the salvificpower of the Buddha’s compassion and its aspiration for rebirth in par-adise the Mulian story resonated with the theology of the Pure Land(Jingtu) tradition in Buddhism. Although its roots lay in Indian scrip-tures, as a distinct movement Pure Land was a wholly Chinese productthat emerged in the sixth century as a reaction against the proliferationof esoteric Buddhist schools patronized by the Chinese aristocracy. PureLand expressed deep pessimism about the human condition and the abil-ity of any believer, lay or clergy, to achieve deliverance from mortal suf-fering solely through one’s own efforts. Abjuring the accumulation ofkarmic merit through performance of austerity, charity, and ritual, PureLand Buddhism instead espoused faith and devotion to a savior, typi-cally the Amitàbha (Amituofo) Buddha or the bodhisattva Guanyin. PureLand teachings stressed the performance of simple devotional acts, suchas recitation of the savior’s name (nianfo), that did not require commit-ment to a monastic vocation, mastery of scripture and ritual, or even themediation of the clergy. During the Song period Pure Land Buddhismbecame the substrate upon which much vernacular religious devotion andpractice rested. Since Pure Land teachings did not comprise a distinctdoctrinal “school” within the monastic orders, elements of them wereadopted by all of the major ecclesiastic traditions of Chinese Buddhism.But it was the ecumenical turn taken by the Tiantai tradition in theeleventh century that was chiefly responsible for the diffusion of PureLand Buddhism throughout all layers of Chinese society.In the Sui and Tang dynasties the Tiantai school had enjoyed lavishpatronage from the imperial court and the aristocracy. In the two cen-turies of turmoil after the An Lushan rebellion, however, Tiantai nearlysank into oblivion before being reborn in the Jiangnan region under thepatronage of the rulers of the Wu-Yue kingdom in the tenth century. Ini-tially, the Tiantai revival was centered at Ningbo, but by the SouthernSong Hangzhou had eclipsed Ningbo as the leading center of Tiantai asboth a lay and a monastic movement.36The revived Tiantai tradition em-braced the devotional practices associated with Pure Land, and becameparticularly identified with penitential rituals and sponsorship of lay con-fraternities known as Lotus Assemblies (Lianshe).37The liturgical foundations of Pure Land Buddhism in the Song werelaid by the monk Ciyun Zunshi (964–1032), one of the leading figuresof the Tiantai revival in Jiangnan. After earning widespread renown dur-ing his tenures as abbot at monasteries in Ningbo and Taizhou (Zhejiang),in 1015 Zunshi assumed the abbacy of the Lower Tianzhu Monastery144Song Transformation of Religious Culture"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"(Xia Tianzhusi) outside Hangzhou. During Zunshi’s sixteen years atLower Tianzhu the monastery began its ascent from a humble moun-taintop retreat to one of the most illustrious centers of the Tiantai tra-dition, a formidable rival to the more senior Tiantai monasteries inNingbo. Zunshi dedicated himself to the reform of popular religiouspractice and the eradication of its heinous “blood-eating” gods. In placeof the popular ritual calendar of blood sacrifices offered to local deities,Zunshi proposed alternative liturgies intended to earn spiritual and ma-terial rewards for the supplicant as well as promote doctrines of uni-versal salvation.38Zunshi especially objected to contemporary mortuary practice, com-plaining that the Avalambana Feast had degenerated into little more thanconventional mourning rites for the ancestors. Zunshi informs us that inhis day most monasteries had separate Land-and-Water chapels (shuilu’an)where offerings were presented to “orphan souls,” the dead who have nodescendants to perform ancestral rites on their behalf. Zunshi condemnedthis exclusive focus on orphan souls (which implicitly acknowledged theprimacy of ancestor worship) and insisted that the offerings should beprovided for all of the dead.39He also decried contemporary fears of “hun-gry ghosts,” emphasizing that the “gift of nourishment to hungry ghosts”(shishi egui)should be understood as an act of charity intended to pro-vide spiritual as well as material sustenance to the unfortunate preta,ratherthan an exorcism of malicious demons.40Among the religious practicesZunshi promoted as alternatives to blood sacrifice were the Release ofLiving Beings (Fangsheng) and Golden Light Penance (Jinguangchan)rites. The Fangsheng ritual, which Zunshi initiated around 1020 on theanniversary of the Buddha’s birth (the eighth day of the fourth lunarmonth) by releasing fish into Hangzhou’s West Lake, pointedly repudi-ated the animal sacrifices offered to blood-eating deities. The Fangshengliturgy also included rites of confession and repentance on behalf of thereleased creatures that would enable them to attain a better rebirth. Inthe performance of this ritual, as with the Avalambana Feast, Zunshistressed the importance of aiding all sentient beings reborn into the lesserpaths of reincarnation rather than focusing exclusively on one’s ances-tors. The Golden Light Penance was largely intended for monks, but itsmain components—confession of sins; profession of faith in the Buddha,his teachings, and the clergy; and eidetic offerings of incense and flowers—were also central to the practices Zunshi encouraged his lay audience toadopt.Yet even Zunshi acknowledged that these rites brought blessings notSong Transformation of Religious Culture145"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"only to less fortunate beings but also to those who performed them. Theprotocol for Land-and-Water Masses composed by Zunshi’s discipleLingjian focused not only on repentance and salvation, but also on mun-dane boons like wealth, progeny, long life, and harmony among kinfolk.The ritual invoked a massive assembly of divine beings encompassingnot only buddhas and bodhisattvas but also the lords of the underworldand non-Buddhist spirits, including the various ranks of local tutelarygods and even “the demon-kings who spread sickness and calamity.” Allof these spirits were represented in iconic form, by either statues or paint-ings, in order to facilitate the postulant’s concentration.41Murals andpaintings depicting many hundreds of buddhas, gods, and divine beingsbecame a standard feature of chapels dedicated to the Land-and-WaterMasses in the Song and later periods.42Tiantai monks fostered lay devotion by founding lay congregations(she)that met periodically to perform penance, recite scriptures, makeeidetic offerings, and undertake charitable works. In 1009, Zhili (960–1028), abbot at Yanqingsi, Ningbo’s chief Tiantai monastery, initiatedannual mass assemblies for the purpose of offering alms to the clergy,conferring “bodhisattva precepts” on laity, and propagating the practiceof nianforecitation. Members of the assembly received almanacs torecord the number of recitations they uttered each day. Such quotidianrituals of repentance and renewal of vows exhibit the Pure Land emphasison the accumulation of merit through repeated actions and quantitativecalculation of spiritual progress that also inspired the practice of keep-ing merit ledgers.43Zunshi also convened Lotus Assemblies, but with amore concentrated focus on the upper ranks of society. Subsequently theselay congregations—known by a wide variety of names, including LotusAssemblies, Pure Land Assemblies (Jingtushe), Return-to-the-West As-semblies (Guixishe), and Assemblies to Gather Resources for Return tothe West (Xizishe)—and Pure Land practices such as nianfowere fullyembraced by the Tiantai ecclesiastic establishment. The popularity of Lo-tus Assemblies soon exceeded the bounds of the Tiantai monasteries. Bythe twelfth century, Lotus Assemblies began to proliferate throughoutJiangnan without the explicit sanction or tutelage of the Tiantai clergy.Though branded as spurious by the Tiantai clergy, these lay congrega-tions attracted the devotion and financial support of wealthy landown-ers.44The People of the Way (Daomin), as they often called themselves,did not form a distinctive sectarian tradition, nor were they anticlerical.On the contrary, they sought to emulate monastic ideals within lay life.Acting more often as individuals than as groups, these lay Buddhists en-146Song Transformation of Religious Culture"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"gaged in a wide array of altruistic activities to earn karmic merit, no-tably through donations not only to support the clergy and evangelicalprojects such as printing copies of Buddhist scriptures, but also for sec-ular purposes like building bridges. Yet the more successful of thesegroups, such as the White Lotus Assembly (Bailianshe) founded by thepreacher Mao Ziyuan (ca. 1086–1166) in the Suzhou-Jiaxing area, be-came targets of clerical jealousy and sporadic persecution. Mao spurnedthe performance of good works to gain karmic merit that was a cardi-nal feature of the monastic Lotus Assemblies, instead stressing the im-portance of contrition and simple devotional acts like nianfo.By the thir-teenth century, the White Lotus Assemblies had become a broad-basedreligious movement throughout southeastern China, taking root in areaslike Fujian and Jiangxi where competition with powerful monastic or-ders was less intense.45The most importance lay practice championed by Zunshi and otherTiantai adherents to Pure Land teachings was a repentance ritual invokingthe bodhisattva Guanyin (Skt. AvalokiteMvara). Guanyin was a proteansalvific figure prominently featured in the Lotus SÜtra,the cardinal scrip-ture of the Tiantai tradition and Mahayana Buddhism as a whole. In theLotus,Guanyin is portrayed—as the literal meaning of the bodhisattva’sname, “listening for sounds from the mortal world,” implies—as a com-passionate figure whom the devout faithful invoke to avert calamity andrescue them from life-threatening peril. Already in the Era of Disuniona large body of miracle tales featuring Guanyin circulated widelythroughout China.46In the Tang period, Tantric elements were intro-duced into the cult that transformed Guanyin into the “Great Com-passionate Bodhisattva Guanyin Who Delivers Us From Suffering”(Dabei jiuku Guanyin pusa), an awesome deity and ubiquitous guardianangel with “a thousand arms and a thousand eyes” (figure 21).47In thisincarnation the bodhisattva vows to come to the aid of all in peril whowith sincere heart intone the “invocation of the Great CompassionateGuanyin” (Dabei Guanyin zhou). Guanyin subsequently became themost important savior figure in Chinese vernacular religion.48Religiousiconography commonly paired Guanyin with Kãitigarbha, representingboth as bodhisattvas who show special compassion for those sufferingin the underworld.49The cult of the Great Compassionate Guanyin combined simple actsof devotion like recitation of the Guanyin invocation with demonstra-tions of sincere repentance, most notably through physical mutilations.The Tiantai patriarchs Zhili and Zunshi also began to develop peniten-Song Transformation of Religious Culture147"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"tial rituals centered on Guanyin.50Zunshi’s disciple Biancai Yuanjing(1011–91) took the leading role in popularizing the Guanyin invocationas part of lay rites of contrition. In 1062, Yuanjing was appointed abbotof Hangzhou’s Upper Tianzhu Monastery (Shang Tianzhusi), whichhoused a statue of Guanyin renowned for its curative powers. Yuanjingacquired considerable fame for his ability to cure illness and dispel ma-lignant spirits using holy water consecrated through the Guanyin invo-cation rite.51In the course of his stewardship the Upper Tianzhu Monas-tery became the most important Guanyin shrine and, thanks to its famousstatue of Guanyin, perhaps the single most important pilgrimage site ofthe Song period.52The early Song period also witnessed the most significant developmentin the history of the Guanyin cult: the metamorphosis of the bodhisattvainto a female deity. The potential for this transformation was inherentin the Lotus SÜtra,which listed thirty-three bodily forms, including seven148Song Transformation of Religious CultureFigure 21.

The mir-acle-working statue of Guanyin at the Upper Tianzhu Monastery, whichwas identified as a White-Robed Guanyin, may have represented the bod-hisattva in female form. The Water-Moon Guanyin (Shuiyue Guanyin),perhaps the most widely reproduced iconographic form of Guanyin inSong times, still appeared in androgynous form. In the Ming period, how-ever, the Water-Moon Guanyin became indelibly identified with the shrineat Mount Putuo, on an island off the coast of Ningbo, where Guanyinwas typically depicted in female form. Mount Putuo’s status as the mostimportant Guanyin pilgrimage site in the Ming-Qing period gave strongimpetus to the conversion of Guanyin to a purely feminine image.54Perhaps the image of Guanyin that contributed most to the popular-ization of the bodhisattva’s female identity was that inspired by the cultof Miaoshan. The Miaoshan myth centers on a pious young woman ofroyal birth who spurns the enticements of marriage and a life of leisureto devote herself completely to Buddhist practices. Her impudent refusalto marry provokes the wrath of her father. The old king tries to dissuadehis daughter by depriving her of the comforts of her station, eventuallyimprisoning her at a nunnery where she is compelled to perform ardu-ous labor. Miaoshan’s resolve remains unbroken, prompting her fatherto order that she be put to death. Miaoshan is miraculously spared, how-ever, and she is transported to distant Fragrant Mountain, where she livesas an ascetic nun.Years later, Miaoshan’s father is stricken by a terrible illness that afflictshim with hideous sores. No doctor can cure the king, and indeed nonecan even look at him without being overcome by revulsion. Upon learn-ing of her father’s illness, Miaoshan comes to him disguised as a monkand proclaims that only a potion made from the eyes and hands of a per-son unbesmirched by anger and hatred could cure the disease. When theking objects that surely no such person exists, the monk replies that theascetic of Fragrant Mountain is indeed such a person. The king then sendshis envoys to Fragrant Mountain to make this audacious request, where-upon Miaoshan immediately gouges out her eyes and severs her arms.After taking the potion the king recovers and then embarks on a pil-grimage to offer thanks. When the royal party arrives at Fragrant Moun-tain the queen recognizes their benefactor as none other than their daugh-150Song Transformation of Religious Culture"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"ter. Overwhelmed by grief at his daughter’s sacrifice, the king vows todevote himself completely to the Buddhist faith. Miaoshan then revealsherself to be an incarnation of Guanyin and transforms herself into theawesome form of the thousand-eye and thousand-hand bodhisattva.55Though the origins of the Miaoshan myth are unknown, it seems likelythat, like the Mulian myth, it was composed in China in an effort to rec-oncile Buddhist renunciation of the world with the supreme Chinese valueof filial piety. The myth is first attested in China at the turn of the twelfthcentury, when a prefect at Hangzhou who had learned of Miaoshan’s storyduring a previous assignment in central China had it inscribed on a stele.The stele was erected at the Upper Tianzhu Monastery, already renownedas a Guanyin shrine, in 1104.56The popularity of Upper Tianzhu as a pil-grimage site ensured that the Miaoshan story would soon spread through-out the empire. Miaoshan also became the subject of popular religiousprimers and later, in the Ming dynasty, full-length novels, and the dis-semination of her story (often tailored for a variety of audiences) madeher perhaps the most widely known incarnation of Guanyin.57Like Mulian, Miaoshan is revealed to be a powerful thaumaturge whocan overturn the laws of karma. Like Mulian, too, Miaoshan epitomizesa sublime form of filial piety that transcends mere submission to parentalauthority. But whereas Mulian symbolizes steadfast devotion to one’sparents, creating a space for the monastic vocation within the larger cul-ture of filial duty, repudiation of paternal authority lies at the heart ofMiaoshan’s story. Moreover, Miaoshan’s self-mutilation takes selfless-ness to a much more extreme degree than anything encountered in theMulian mythology. It is hard to imagine Miaoshan as a practical modelfor emulation. Instead, the Miaoshan cult connected private devotion tothe awesome salvific powers of a great goddess. Miaoshan’s sacrifice ofher hands and eyes alludes to the fundamentally illusory nature of theworld of flesh, while her epiphany in the form of the thousand-eye andthousand-hand bodhisattva manifests the true reality that can be per-ceived only through faith and devotion.The female forms of Guanyin, together with the emergence of othergoddess cults in the Song,58attest to a spreading phenomenon that per-haps can be called a “feminization” of compassion. In contrast to malegods cast in the role of upright monarchs and officials, stalwart defend-ers of social norms and the unbendable rule of moral law, female deitiesdisplayed deep empathy for the tribulations of mortal sinners. The emer-gence of these goddess cults and the feminization of compassion provideevidence for the growing importance of women in devotional cults.Song Transformation of Religious Culture151"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"Nonetheless, cults focused specifically on the lives and concerns ofwomen did not emerge until after the Song period. For example, the im-age of Guanyin as “Deliverer of Children” (Songzi Guanyin) and patronof childbirth only appears during the period ca. 1400–1600, even thoughthis attribute of Guanyin is specifically mentioned in the Lotus SÜtra.Likewise, the goddess (niangniang)cults of north China also seem to havefirst developed in the Ming dynasty.59Obsession with sin and atonement, terrifying images of the afterlife,dissemination of the pragmatic Pure Land liturgies, and the feminizationof compassion pervaded Song religion and society well beyond theconfines of explicitly Buddhist doctrines and believers. Indeed, the mostsalient feature of Chinese religious culture in Song times is the emergenceof a unified realm of the sacred that amalgamated religious beliefs andpractices of disparate origins.60By “unified” I do not mean to imply thatChinese religion assumed a single, monolithic form. On the contrary, eventhe most basic features of this unified realm of the sacred were subjectto constant reinterpretation and modification in the context of discretesocial and historical experiences, and religious belief and practice dis-played striking diversity across time, space, and social milieu. Nonethe-less, we witness in the Song the crystallization of basic assumptions aboutthe nature and structure of the divine and the laws governing interac-tions between mortals and spirits that informed vernacular religious con-sciousness throughout the late imperial era. The significance of these pre-cepts can be grasped not through schematic models of the structure ofChinese religion, however, but only by studying their concrete historicalinstantiations.Song religious culture evinced a growing awareness of the gods as partof human history; not the remote history of the ancient sage-kings, butthe common history of communal memory, a history that took place inthe past but is continually relived in the present through story and per-formance. The lore of the gods that accumulated in the storehouse ofmemory was brought to life through ritual gesture and community ob-servance that reaffirmed the reciprocal relations—forged as much by his-tory as by faith—binding the gods and their worshipers. The roles ofmemory, folklore, and ritual in shaping the religious traditions of fam-ily and community were by no means unprecedented. We can see themat work in the “annals of the strange” of the post-Han era, Buddhist mir-acle tales, and Dai Fu’s anecdotes, all of which sought to reveal the work-ings of the divine through concrete and attestable historical events. What152Song Transformation of Religious Culture"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"was novel in the Song and afterward was the vernacular framework ofreligious understanding.The popular pantheon that emerged in the Song rendered the gods ac-cessible and responsive to ordinary people. In Daoist theology, knowl-edge of the gods endowed power over them. Much of the scriptural andliturgical content of Daoism from the inception of the Celestial Mastersmovement in the Han dynasty centered on acquiring knowledge of thegods’ names, powers, and places in the celestial hierarchy. Only throughsuch knowledge could human beings harness supernatural powers andtrain them on worldly concerns. Thus, knowledge of the gods bestowedpowers rivaling those of temporal suzerains. It was a closely guarded se-cret divulged only to worthy cognoscenti; ordinary mortals had no re-course except to seek priests to intercede with the gods on their behalf.In the Song period, laypersons began to exploit more direct avenues ofcontact and communication with the gods.61Simplified forms of div-ination like the casting of “moon-blocks” or choosing divination stickscould be performed without recourse to priests, texts, or ritual knowl-edge. Local communities also used their own increasing economic re-sources to create pantheons that reflected both the particular history ofa place and the needs of its inhabitants. In the process, many of the godsinvented in the Song bore a striking resemblance to their clients. In con-trast to the astral abstractions of Daoist theology and the deified states-men and generals of older “blood-sacrifice” cults, new local cults in theSong often featured commoners whose lives (or, more typically, deaths)imbued them with supernatural power. Local people could evoke em-pathetic response (ganying)from these gods precisely because of theirshared membership in the local community.Yet both Buddhist and Daoist clergy continued to occupy key posi-tions in Song society. Though by no means as central to community lifeas the parish priests of medieval Europe, Buddhist and Daoist clergy wereindispensable as celebrants at funerals and memorial rites, as well as atmany communal festivals (though they were absent from births and mar-riages, which were purely domestic affairs). Neither Daoist priests norBuddhist monks assumed leadership within village society, however. In-stead, they served as temple wardens and religious specialists, minister-ing to the particular needs of individuals and families when called uponto do so. From the Tang period onward large numbers of clergy occu-pied such specialized niches within local society, and we can perhapsspeak of their social roles in terms of a vernacularization of ritual. ThatSong Transformation of Religious Culture153"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"is to say, the essentially generalized forms of ritual performed by clergy(e.g., communication with the gods by means of bureaucratic corre-spondence mediated by Daoist priests, or repentance and atonement ofsin orchestrated by Buddhist monks) were situated not in a discrete the-ological and hieratic context, but rather within the framework of the sec-ular life of lay postulants. As Kristofer Schipper has observed, Daoist litur-gies like the Yellow Register Rite could be and were adapted to a widevariety of public uses.62The Daoist priest did not demand an explicit re-ligious commitment from those who sought his services (though his Bud-dhist counterpart perhaps was more likely to). Instead, he provided aservice to a client. Though the miracles wrought by priests and monksinspired belief and piety among the beneficiaries, the latter often with-held their devotion until the miracle occurred. It was common to ap-proach the gods with a request accompanied by a promise to make of-ferings or perform acts of thanksgiving only after the supplicant’s prayershad been answered.In addition to Buddhist monks and Daoist priests, a heterogeneousclass of “ritual masters” (fashi)emerged in the Song dynasty who spe-cialized in one or another set of liturgical therapies for exorcising demonsand restoring health to afflicted persons.63The term fashiencompassedevery denomination of religious practitioner, both ordained and not, rang-ing from unlettered village mediums to learned masters of scripture. Theircommon denominator was the ability to invoke a specific patron deityby means of spirit possession and metamorphosis whereby the deity in-heres in the body of the fashiand endows him with its supernatural power.Fashiwere expert in techniques of spirit detection, often employing child-mediums to personify demons afflicting sick persons. Once identified, theoffending spirit was forced from the body of the patient, subjected to ju-dicial inquest, and banished. Ned Davis has suggested that Buddhist andDaoist fashiwere imitating exorcistic practices that originated with thesundry local spirit mediums (wu), while the latter adopted the patrondeities and repertoires of liturgies and spells of ecclesiastic religion.64What seems to distinguish the two is the peripatetic nature of the fashi,who appear in Song accounts as highly mobile figures traveling widelyin response to the summonses of clients. The wu,in contrast, remainedrooted, as their patron deities were, to particular places. In any event,the fashiacted as the catalyst for the vernacularization and dissemina-tion of ritual practices throughout Song society.Temples, even modest ones (or indeed abandoned ones), were wreathedin an aura of sacred power. One of the most common tropes of folklore154Song Transformation of Religious Culture"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"was the severe punishment meted out to impious visitors to temples whocommitted acts of desecration by toying with statues of gods and othersacred objects. Yet temples remained public places, open to any suppli-cant who approached the gods with private prayers. The use of meritledgers and spirit money shows that laypersons increasingly pursued sec-ular avenues of deliverance. Yet they were still engaged in a dialectic withthe ideologies and institutions of established religion. Temple wardenshad frequent contact with these supplicants and might perform serviceson their behalf. Communities of clergy, like the monastic orders of me-dieval Christianity, had far less direct involvement in the lives and reli-gious practices of the great majority of the population. Nonetheless, thegrowing popularity of devotional cults like Pure Land Buddhism, andthe Guanyin cult in particular, brought lay believers into more frequentcontact with clerics. Priests and monks also officiated at community rit-uals on major feast days—including Guanyin feast days (especially on2/1965and 6/19), the anniversary of the Buddha’s entry into nirvàJa(4/8),the Ghost Festival (7/15), and feast days of local gods—as well as at ir-regular community-wide events like the consecration of a new templebuilding and at rituals involving crises like prolonged drought. (At othertimes, though—including the New Year’s season [1/1–1/15], the Qing-ming rites of sweeping the ancestors’ graves [3/3], and the midsummerDuanwu festival [5/5], dedicated to the exorcism of demons—religiousactivities were largely confined to domestic rites that did not involve theparticipation of religious specialists.) As Jean DeBernardi has observed,the ritual calendar celebrated the totality of divine beings, even in theabsence of doctrinal unity or congregational commitment.66The ritualcalendar, and by extension the hierarchical order of the divine, variedfrom one local community to the next in keeping with their own localtraditions and priorities. Sites of worship likewise were diffused, in spaceas well as time. The fluidity of this system of worship encouraged diver-sity and specialization of mediation with the divine, rather than a single,exclusive ecclesiastic order.It is tempting to associate the vernacular religious culture of the Songand later Chinese history with local and essentially oral traditions, in con-trast to the scriptural and hieratic traditions of organized religion. Daoistand Buddhist clergy themselves strictly demarcated between the pure the-ology and disciplined liturgy preserved in their respective canons and themotley variety of popular beliefs and practices. Yet there is no evidenceto suggest that ordinary people conceived of religion in terms of suchclearly segregated spheres. The encounter between the literate and oralSong Transformation of Religious Culture155"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"realms took multifarious forms, and literacy was not a requirement forgaining access to scriptures. The precepts of scriptural traditions, no lessthan stories of miracles wrought by gods, circulated by word of mouth.As Hansen suggests, the tangible presence of gods in the forms of tem-ples and statues provided important keys for ordinary people to learnabout the gods, and a means of recognizing them when they appeared,as they often did, in dreams and visions. Yet temples also served as store-houses of scriptural knowledge. The iconography of temples and therepertory of services provided by the religious specialists they housedbrought lay believers, however unwittingly, into the domain of scripture.One example of the imbrication of scripture and lay religion is theScripture of Universal Salvation (Duren jing). This brief, one-chapterwork was one of the primary revealed texts of the Lingbao liturgical cor-pus circa 400, and it was well known among educated men in Songtimes.67Lin Lingsu made the Duren jingthe cornerstone of the Shenxiaorevelations he presented to Emperor Huizong (r. 1100–25) in 1116, andthis scripture, in a greatly amplified sixty-one-chapter version, becamethe foundation of Huizong’s short lived Daocracy.68Recitation of theDuren jingwas believed to ensure a place in paradise for both living pos-tulants and their deceased ancestors, saving them from underworld tor-ment. Reflecting Buddhist conceptions of the function and nature ofsacred texts, the Duren jingdeparted from earlier Daoist works in ex-panding its soteriological concerns to embrace the salvation of all, notjust the individual.69The text largely consists of the secret names of ce-lestial deities, written in an esoteric language of Sanskrit transliterations.Well before Lin Lingsu, though, the text’s fame had been embellished bypriests such as the heralded oracle Xu Shouxin (1033–1108), who usedits enigmatic language to tell fortunes. Xu responded to supplicants’ ques-tions by writing down a phrase, sometimes a single graph or two, seem-ingly taken at random from the Duren jingthat proved unerringly ac-curate as prognostications. Greatly celebrated in his own day andpatronized by three emperors (one of who built a monastery of five hun-dred bays in his honor), Xu nonetheless mostly catered to a clientele ofordinary laypersons. His popularity testified to the talismanic power ofsacred texts, and the authority wielded by those who could manipulatesuch texts.70Nor was Xu unique. Folktales from the Song confirm that the Durenjingoften was used in fortune telling.71Intoning sacred scriptures alsoenabled believers to invoke their prophylactic and curative powers. Suchpractices seem to have been diffused among lay believers as well as clergy156Song Transformation of Religious Culture"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"beginning in the Song period. Although tales of the miraculous benefitsof reciting the Duren jing—to regain health, protect oneself from harm,or deliver one’s ancestors from infernal punishment—are found in DuGuangting’s Record of Verified Miracles of the Daoist Teachings,the pro-tagonists in all of Du’s anecdotes are Daoist priests, and the text itself isdepicted as an esoteric scripture.72By contrast, a series of miracle sto-ries appended to a Yuan commentary to the Duren jingfeatures ordi-nary, and even illiterate, laypersons. In one story a blind man regains hissight through recitation of the text. In another, a lame man’s infirmity iscured simply by hearing the Duren jingchanted during a religious festi-val devoted to collective recitation of the text.73Popular lore also atteststo the talismanic powers of the Duren jing.Copies of the scripture, pro-duced in mass quantities, could serve as currency in the afterlife, used toprocure positions in the infernal bureaucracy or purchase escape fromthe dread hands of underworld judgment.74The scriptural message of the Duren jing was also communicated tononliterate audiences in pictorial form. For example, when Suzhou’s mainDaoist temple was renovated in 1146, its galleries were painted with“transformation images” (bianxiang)inspired by the Duren jing.75Grootaers’s study of the iconography of Zhenwu temples in north Chinain the 1940s has shown that such temple murals played a crucial role indisseminating, and also in reworking, the lore of the gods. Through a com-parison of legends concerning Zhenwu in two late Ming works, a popu-lar religious tract76and a folk novel,77with murals preserved in twentieth-century rural temples, Grootaers discovered that the stories representedin these murals varied considerably from the literary sources. Some mu-rals included episodes unknown in the literary records, perhaps derivedfrom the theatrical repertory or devotional pamphlets. Grootaers alsofound that the mural captions contained numerous errors based on theform or sound of graphs, leading him to conclude that these legends hadbeen transmitted chiefly by word of mouth.78The popularization of theconception of the underworld derived from the Scripture of the Ten Kingsalso underscores the importance of didactic illustrations in transmittingscriptural—albeit “uncanonical”—doctrines.79In tandem with the growing tendency in the Song to make direct ap-peals to the gods, the bureaucratic metaphor used at least since Han timesto express the relationship between the gods and mortals increasingly as-sumed concrete manifestation as a hierarchically ordered pantheon. Theskeletal frame of the divine bureaucracy became fully fleshed out by ranksof officials headed by a supreme deity, himself a mirror image of the Chi-Song Transformation of Religious Culture157"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"nese monarch. Like the Chinese emperor, the supreme deity was signifiedby his office rather than his person. The supreme deity was known by avariety of interchangeable titles, including the archaic Shangdi or Tiandiand titles that originated in Daoist theology, like the Jade Emperor(Yuhuang dadi) and the Primordial Celestial Worthy (Yuanshi tianzun).80The Song state promoted this idea of the divine realm as an extension ofmundane government by seeking to integrate all religious cults into animperially authorized canon of worship and sacrifice. Like earlier dy-nasties, the Song compiled registers of sacrifices (sidian)that defined theproper objects and forms of worship. The canon of Confucian ritual, it-self a reflection of the aristocratic age of the Zhou dynasty, nominallyrestricted ordinary subjects to veneration of their ancestors and a lim-ited number of household tutelary deities. All other forms of god wor-ship were deemed “profane cults” (yinci)and strictly prohibited. By theSong period, the imperial state generally condoned communal observanceof rites once restricted to the long-defunct aristocracy, such as offeringsmade to the spirits of sacred mountains and rivers. Over the course ofthe Song the registers of sacrifices swelled with the inclusion of hundredsof local deities who earned official recognition on the strength of the mir-acles they performed on behalf of both the dynastic house and the localcommunity. Confucian critics of religious enthusiasm railed against mag-istrates and local dignitaries who succumbed to popular importunitiesand collaborated in the promotion of such cults, but to little avail. TheSong government remained committed to the strategy of co-optation andregulation through official recognition, rather than outright suppression,as the most effective means of curbing the excesses of popular devotion.At the same time, religious iconography increasingly reflected the con-ception of the divine as a simulacrum of secular authority. Images of thegods were commonly dressed in the robes and regalia of rulers andofficials (figure 23).81The Song government’s efforts to regulate and codify religious prac-tice through official sanction of popular cults were hardly novel, but itsattempt to create a standard and universal pantheon extending from theimperial cult down to local tutelary spirits constituted an unprecedentedintrusion of imperial authority into religious life. From the outset of theSong dynasty, the central government subjected the Buddhist and Daoistmonastic orders to tight regulatory discipline. Orthodox canons of sa-cred scriptures were compiled and printed at the state’s behest, and thestate also exercised substantial control over the ordination of clergy andappointment of abbots at the most important monasteries and shrines.158Song Transformation of Religious Culture"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"The fervently Daoist Emperor Zhenzong (r. 997–1022) was especiallyenergetic in granting titles and awards to Daoist gods, honoring the chiefdeities of Daoism with rank commensurate with his own imperial dig-nity.82The Lord of Mount Tai, the presiding deity of the underworld,was invested with the rank of “divine sovereign” (dijun)and grantedthe new title of Great Sage-Emperor of the Eastern Marchmount Co-eval with Heaven (Dongyue qitian dasheng di).

The process of canoniza-tion was not merely a matter left to the central government’s discretion;devotees of popular cults competed with each other to win official recog-nition and honors for their own particular patrons. Powerful lineagesclaiming an ancestral tie to such figures vigorously lobbied to secureofficial honors for them. In other cases campaigns to seek canonizationfor a local deity mobilized a wide range of sponsors, including promi-nent local notables, clerics of all denominations, and local officials. Fiercestruggles between rival claimants to miracles induced sponsors to em-ploy all sorts of underhanded tactics, such as forging documents and steal-ing steles, to advance their causes. Official recognition (and subsequentpromotion to higher rank) was granted on the basis of miracles performedby the god and authenticated through an elaborate process of official re-view not unlike the Roman Catholic Church’s protocols for recognizingsainthood. By the end of the Song numerous local gods had been pro-moted to the second-tier rank of “king,” but none apart from Dongyueand Zhenwu had attained the august mantle of “divine sovereign.”84One feature of the unified realm of the sacred, then, was the articu-lation of a hierarchy of gods and cults that structured religious time andspace. Imperial sanction played a significant role in the formation of thishierarchy, but the pantheon was subjected to considerable alteration inaccordance with the ebb and flow of popular devotion. For heuristic pur-poses, we can separate this hierarchy into four levels: 1) domestic cults;2) local tutelary deities; 3) sovereign gods; and 4) regional cult centers.It should be emphasized immediately that these four tiers were not ar-rayed in strict relations of subordination (except, perhaps, in the subor-dination of local tutelary deities to sovereign gods). Nevertheless, thepowers ascribed to the gods and the range of their authority roughly cor-responded to this order of precedence. Moreover, all of the above cultsimpinged on the lives of the populace. Though each type of deity had itsown distinctive characteristics, their roles were by no means exclusive,and the jurisdictions of gods overlapped in concentric circles extendingoutward from the sharply delimited sphere of household gods to the wideand potentially universal reach of regional cult centers. It is also worth160Song Transformation of Religious Culture"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"noting that the gods inhabiting this pantheon varied substantially fromone locality to the next, and the pantheon as a whole underwent con-stant metamorphosis, with new gods being created and old ones some-times fading away.

The rubric of “domestic cults” should be un-derstood as encompassing two distinct sets of deities: those whose ju-risdiction was limited to the household, and those who were worshipedby family members within the confines of the home. From ancient timesChinese subscribed to a number of household cults centered on the pro-tection of the family and the home from misfortune. The stove and doorgods were generic deities who served in this capacity, and also (in thecase of the stove god) conducted surveillance of the conduct of its mem-bers.85Every household had a family altar (jiatang)on which the tabletsof the ancestral spirits would be arranged. In addition, icons represent-ing sovereign and tutelary deities of local importance might also be placedon the family altar.86Religious lore of the Song period indicates a growing orientation to-ward personal patron deities, rather than lowly bureaucratic supernu-meraries like the stove god, for protection against both personal calamityand malign spirits. Guanyin’s role as a personal savior of course had along history owing to the popularity of the Lotus SÜtra and the abun-dant miracle tales portraying the bodhisattva as an omnipresent guardianangel. Devotion to Guanyin focused on portable images of the deity, usu-ally small statuettes, and the so-called Guanyin SÜtra (Guanyin jing;ac-tually the twenty-fifth chapter of the Lotus SÜtra), which served as a per-sonal breviary. The great Daoist demonifuge Zhenwu also enjoyed greatesteem as a personal guardian. Although imperial patronage ensured thattemples dedicated to Zhenwu were founded throughout the empire, pop-ular worship of the god centered not on these Daoist shrines but on pri-vate devotional icons.

By contrast, alleighteen Dongyue stories in Hong Mai’s anthology feature temples ded-icated to the god.87Festivals held in honor of Zhenwu on the god’s feastday (3/3, coinciding with the Qingming grave-sweeping ceremony) wereimportant communal events in some places,88but the god’s primary rolein Song religion was that of a guardian angel whose image served as pro-tection from malign forces.As we have already seen in Dai Fu’s anthology, people saw themselvesas susceptible to demonic attack even within their own homes. Perhapsthe most common motif of supernatural stories in the Tales of the Lis-tenerinvolves family members or servants victimized by demonic attackor possession. Hong Mai recorded one episode of demonic possessionthat happened to his own family while his father was a minor local officialin Jiaxing, and his account affords us a revealing glimpse of the Hongfamily’s religious culture.89Hong reports that the office of public recordsin Jiaxing prefecture was haunted by the ghosts of peasants who had diedof starvation following devastating floods the previous year. Even Hong’solder brother, then nine years old, was an eyewitness to these appari-tions. One of the ghosts possesses a family maid, but Hong’s father sub-dues the ghost and demands a confession. Vexed by the ghost’s abilityto possess the young woman despite the manifold measures he tookagainst demonic invasion, Hong’s father interrogates the ghost to dis-cover why his precautions failed:“Zhenwu, whom I worship, is an extraordinarily powerful god, and in ad-dition our home houses Buddhist statues and images of tuditutelary spiritsand the stove god. How is it that you were able to enter?” The ghost replied,“The Buddha is a benevolent god who does not concern himself with friv-olous matters.

Hong’s father, though a governmentofficial steeped in Confucian skepticism, was clearly a pious man. Hismeticulous devotions to the household gods and Zhenwu as a personalguardian were typical of the great majority of the population.90local tutelary godsPerhaps the most striking development of all in Song religion was theefflorescence of cults dedicated to deities rooted in the historical experi-ence, real or imagined, of the local community. In contrast to the “deadgenerals of vanquished armies,” as Lu Xiujing sneeringly described lo-cal deities of the early imperial era, many of the new local gods were por-trayed as persons of common birth who performed heroic service on be-half of the community.91Yet, in most cases it was the circumstances oftheir death, rather than their achievements in life, that endowed thesecult figures with an aura of supernatural power. Popular religious con-sciousness continued to see godhood as a transformation wrought bydeath, and commoner deities, like the “dead generals” of yore, were fre-quently distinguished by violent or premature death.92Indeed, it was pre-cisely the enduring liminal presence of the spirit of the deceased at aspecific site that defined a local god. The origin of local gods as actualhuman beings did not in itself distinguish them from other gods; ha-giography supplied all gods with a mortal history. Instead, the chief at-tributes of local gods were ties to the locality and consequently their ser-vice as patrons of the living community, rather than their role asrepresentatives of the distant celestial bureaucracy. Though occupying alowly position in the divine hierarchies of Daoism and state religion, theselocal gods remained closest to the people, and thus were the gods mostsympathetic to their plight and responsive to their needs.Prior to the Song period, “tudispirit” was a loose designation for spir-its resident in a particular place, without reference to rank or status withina universal pantheon.93In Han times the term referred to spirits who lit-erally inhabited the soil and must be appeased when breaking ground toraise buildings, cultivate fields, and dig graves. According to Wang Chong,164Song Transformation of Religious Culture"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"on such occasions a clay effigy in macabre form (guixing)was made, whichspirit mediums used to make entreaties, offering sacrifices as compensa-tion for having disturbed the spirit’s domicile.94Han tomb ordinances typically entrust care of the deceased to thespirits of the grave site, and tudialso appear as petty spirits who escortthe deceased to the world of the afterlife.95Such spirits were kindred tothe “prodigies of trees and stones” (mushi zhi guai)and the shanxiao;in the Song period, they were worshiped at the ubiquitous rural shrinesknown as congci(“grove shrines”; see chapter 6). Yet tudialso came torefer to a class of tutelary gods who became the focal points of commu-nal identity and welfare. Such spirits were almost always portrayed asdeceased humans rather than nature spirits, though in some cases the dig-nity accorded to these tutelary gods was expressed by designating themas gods of mountains that dominated the local landscape. These new tudicults, which emerged in the late Tang and proliferated during the Song,shed the violent, morally ambivalent character and grotesque forms ofthe older tudispirits.96Kristofer Schipper has drawn attention to an as-similation of Daoist ritual and local cults, beginning probably in the Tangperiod, that invested local deities with the powers and majesty of Daoistdivinities.97In addition, canonization by the Song state delegated re-sponsibility for communal welfare to select local gods. Remolded to fitthe prevailing norms of Confucian social ethics, these gods becameparagons of justice, loyalty, and filial piety. Nonetheless, the new tudicults of the Song period share with the older cults of “dead generals” acommon origin in rituals for propitiation of the dead.98This transformation of local deities into tutelary gods can be seen inthe evolution of the cult of Filial Lord Zhou (Zhou Xiaogong), locatedin Yixing county (Changzhou), on the western shore of Lake Tai in theYangzi Delta. In his mortal existence Filial Lord Zhou was Zhou Chu, amilitary hero and martyr of the third century. Legend relates that ZhouChu was the wastrel son of a prefect stationed in Poyang (Jiangxi) whosewanton behavior became as much a scourge to the local inhabitants asthe ferocious tiger and kraken that constantly preyed upon them. Thehaughty Zhou Chu took it upon himself to sally forth and battle the tigerand kraken; though he succeeded in slaying them, during the course ofthe struggle he was submerged in a lake for three days. The local popu-lace celebrated the demise of Zhou Chu as much as their deliverance fromthe tiger and kraken. When Zhou Chu resurfaced he finally realized howmuch he was hated and vowed to reform himself. He traveled to Jiang-nan and became a disciple to the celebrated scholars Lu Ji (261–303) andSong Transformation of Religious Culture165"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"his brother Lu Yun, served the Wu kingdom and subsequently the Jin dy-nasty (265–420) as a military officer, and died heroically in battle in 299.99Although a memorial stele celebrating Zhou’s heroism was raised athis grave site after his death, there is no evidence of a cult dedicated toZhou until the early tenth century. It is likely that local people had longvenerated Zhou as one of the “dead generals of vanquished armies.” Hiscult took on a new life in the twelfth century, after locals credited Zhouwith protecting them from marauding armies during the Fang La rebel-lion of 1119–20 and Zhou was granted imperial recognition. Populardevotion to Zhou seems to have been inspired by miracles (copiously com-memorated by local officials); protection of the community againstdrought, flood, plague, and bandits; and the god’s potency as an oracle.An inscription of 1149 observes that the divination sticks (qian)at Zhou’stemple had a well-established reputation for remarkable prescience, andpeople came “from one hundred leagues around” to use them. The div-ination oracles “encouraged virtue, warned against misdeeds, and pro-moted filial piety and loyalty,” and perhaps they were the source of theepithet “Filial Lord.”100A major expansion of the temple compound wasundertaken in 1176 by a Changzhou prefect as a gesture of thanks forsaving him and his family from drowning in a storm on Lake Tai, andnumerous private donations provided the shrine with a permanent en-dowment. An inscription commemorating the 1176 renovation reportsthat the walls of the temple were decorated with murals depicting bothZhou’s exploits of slaying the tiger and kraken and an “array of celes-tial beings.”101This combination of individual heroic deeds and a pan-theon of transcendent deities illustrates the assimilation of Daoist liturgyand ancient culture heroes described by Schipper.102Another example of the new local tutelary cults of the Song period isthe cult of Sire Li (Li Hou), which originated in Changxing county inHuzhou, adjacent to Yixing. While still a youth Li acquired a reputationas an uncanny seer. In 1121, at age eighteen, he suddenly announced hisintention to serve his emperor by joining the campaign to suppress a re-bellion then raging in Shandong, saying that he probably would not re-turn for years. Thereupon Li sat down in a meditative posture and died.Li’s fellow villagers built a temple to shelter his spirit until his return,and local spirit mediums came to rely on Li’s spirit as an oracle. The shrinefirst gained imperial recognition in 1209, but the deity achieved renownin 1225, when Sire Li was said to have interceded to spare the people ofHuzhou from imperial wrath after several Huzhou men tried to instigatethe overthrow of the newly enthroned emperor, Lizong (r. 1225–64).103166Song Transformation of Religious Culture"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"The cult subsequently gained wider attention. In 1250, the celebratedDaoist priest Deng Daoshu, who had moved to Suzhou from Sichuan tenyears before, consecrated a temple in Sire Li’s honor in Changshu, oneof the county seats of Suzhou prefecture.104Proclaiming Li’s merits asa “defender of the faith,” Deng placed the shrine in Changshu’s mainDaoist abbey. The preeminence of Sire Li in Changshu’s local religiouslife was firmly established in the Yuan period, when Changshu servedas the point of embarkation for the grain tribute fleets traveling the oceanroute to the Yuan capital of Dadu (modern Beijing). Sailors prayed tothe deity for protection, and the Yuan court formally recognized Li asthe guardian deity of the tribute fleets. Thus in Changshu Sire Li becameknown as Sea God King Li (Haishen Li wang).105The close affinity be-tween Sire Li and the local Daoist establishment persisted throughoutthe Ming, when the abbey was popularly known as the King Li Tem-ple. While mariners worshiped Sire Li as a patron deity, the Changshucult also developed its own rich mythology apart from the original cultin Changxing.106The transplanting of Sire Li’s cult from Changxing to Changshuconfirms the growing mobility of cults in the Song period.107The spreadof god cults beyond their place of origin exacerbated tensions betweenpopular practice and official dogma, however. The ritual canons stipu-lated that the authority of tutelary spirits (typically imagined as the spir-its of mountains and rivers), like that of the local officials who were theirsecular counterparts, was bounded by their territorial jurisdiction. Godscould be worshiped only within their officially recognized home terri-tory. But the accelerated mobility of Song society facilitated the move-ment of cults into new territories. Still, tutelary deities like Sire Li gen-erally remained fairly localized. Despite the “innumerable” templesdedicated to Sire Li within Changshu, according to a Ming gazetteer, thecult apparently did not spread (or at least did not endure) in neighbor-ing areas.108The parochial qualities of such gods, tied to place and his-torical memory, hindered their movement much beyond their place oforigin.109Evidence from Jiangnan and Fujian suggests that the diffusionof local tutelary deity cults like Filial Lord Zhou and Sire Li was grad-ual and finite; rarely did a local god win adherents in a catchment arealarger than one or two prefectures.110The most important occasions for worship of tutelary deities were thespring assemblies held at the gods’ temples. In Jiangnan, where a settle-ment pattern of dispersed settlement and small hamlets prevailed, fewvillages had their own temples. Each hamlet or village organized a cultSong Transformation of Religious Culture167"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"group (she); the whole panoply of cult groups gathered together at thetemple on the god’s feast day for a communal celebration (huib). Wor-ship of the God of Saddleback Mountain (Ma’anshan; popularly knownsimply as the Mountain God [Shanshen]) in Kunshan county (Suzhou)seems to have been organized according to such principles. Each springcult groups from many villages gathered in a grand assembly to payhomage:On the fifteenth day of the fourth month, the feast day of the MountainGod, the county greets the deity with Buddhist and Daoist ceremonies to pray for a bountiful harvest.

Peddlers and merchants from other prefectures descendon the festival in droves, elbowing one another and stepping on each other’sfeet.111The god’s image was carried in a procession from its temple several kilo-meters outside the city to the prefectural yamen, stopping at each resthouse to receive the villagers’ oblations. Although this terse account doesnot indicate whether the shebrought along images of their patron tudias has been common in more recent times, it is clear that the God of Sad-dleback Mountain was regarded as Kunshan’s paramount deity and thusenjoyed fealty of the whole population.Evidence from later periods shows thatsherituals in rural areas ofJiangnan fostered a sense of social identity based on common residence,and thus transected rather than paralleled kinship ties.112Shemember-ship, no less than kinship identity, was an ascriptive status: the sourcesrepeatedly emphasize that no one could refuse to participate in, or pro-vide financial support to, their she.While the huifestivals demarcatedthe range of the local tutelary god’s jurisdiction through the processionof the god’s image throughout the villages of its constituent she,the huiitself does not seem to have imparted a strong sense of collective iden-tity.

The imperialstate, in its effort to submit the gods to imperial control, adopted thismodel and applied it systematically to officially endorsed cults. But thedistant supreme gods impinged on the lives of ordinary people far lessthan the local tutelary spirits. As ter Haar reminds us, the gods of localreligion were typically anointed with titles like “lord,” “king,” or even“emperor”—in other words, titles that connoted not bureaucratic officebut sovereign authority.113Local inhabitants regarded their tudias sov-ereigns over their own territories. Yet at the same time these local cultswere typically enmeshed in larger networks of affiliation and subordi-nation centered on the sovereign cults of the towns.In Ming-Qing times, the intermediate level between local tutelary godsand the celestial pantheon was occupied by a class of gods typically des-ignated as chenghuang.Chenghuang,literally “god of moats and walls,”commonly has been rendered in English as “city god,” a translation thathas been the cause of much confusion. Although chenghuangcan be con-sidered “city gods” insofar as cities were defined by walls (a definitionthat includes nearly all seats of government, but excludes most markettowns), it is more appropriate to think of chenghuangas a bureaucraticrank equivalent to that of prefect in the imperial field administration.Many chenghuangwere accorded official recognition on an ad hoc ba-sis beginning in the tenth century, but the proliferation of chenghuangresulted more from popular initiative than imperial fiat.114Chenghuangfirst arose in the Tang period, perhaps as martial guardian figures con-ceived in the image of Buddhist monastic guardians (qielanshen).115Butalready in the Tang period the chenghuanghad become closely associ-ated with the administration of the underworld.116In popular folklore,the office of chenghuangtypically was occupied by deceased local offi-cials, who retained in death the authority they wielded in life.117Thenumerous stories in the Tales of the Listenerthat mention the cheng-Song Transformation of Religious Culture169"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"huangtypically cast the god in the role of territorial governor, respon-sible for disciplining and punishing unruly spirits and demons within hisjurisdiction—a role that conforms to that accorded to the chenghuangin Daoist theology.As noted earlier, the proliferation of chenghuangcults simultaneouswith the marked urban growth of the Song has led some scholars to at-tribute the popularity of the chenghuangto its role as an emblem of anascent urban identity among merchants and other leading urban citi-zens.118Yet in the Song period chenghuangtemples were invariably lo-cated in prefectural and county capitals, a distribution that conformedmore to the political and administrative hierarchy than economic status.No chenghuangwere found in market towns. The dissemination ofchenghuangat the level of market towns was a late development, subse-quent to the regularization of the chenghuang cult in religious reformscarried out by the first Ming emperor in the late fourteenth century (seechapter 6).In the Song and Yuan dynasties, the most important sovereign godwas Dongyue (figure 25). Zhenzong’s edict mandating the worship ofDongyue throughout the empire violated the traditional ritual principlethat the worship of gods must be confined to the actual place where thegod was believed to reside, and thus gave imperial license to a prolifer-ation of Dongyue temples under private as well as government auspices.The profusion of Dongyue temples even in towns that lacked imperialofficials is particularly striking. In many market towns, citizens seekingto embellish their town’s stature raised funds to build “detached palaces”(xinggong,signifying a secondary residence of the emperor) dedicatedto Dongyue.119Indeed, the Dongyue temple became the hallmark of thedignity of market towns (zhen)that aspired to the official prestige ofcounty and prefectural seats. The sovereign authority of Dongyue overlocal, rural tudigods was demonstrated by the practice of sending im-ages of local gods to attend the “court audience” of Dongyue (chaoDongyue). In the market town of Xinshi (Huzhou), for example, “eachyear at the time of the spring festival people come in droves from sev-eral hundred leagues around bearing gifts of money and silk which theypresent in audience [chaoxian]at the Dongyue temple.”120While the Dongyue temples served as crucibles for forging a distinc-tive town identity, the cult encompassed a wide range of meanings andbelievers. Inheriting the functional role of the Lord of Taishan as the ar-biter of life and death, and also of poverty and wealth, Dongyue inspiredawe and terror as well as reverence.

Murals of the Ten Infernal Courts, completewith all of their grotesque tortures, often embellished these gods’ tem-ples. The ubiquity of rituals of redemption in the context of the Dongyueand chenghuangcults, as in other forms of piety, attests once again to aprofound preoccupation with sin. Daoist clergy consciously strove toreappropriate the notion of purgatory by embellishing the mythology ofthe Ten Kings and reasserting the primacy of Dongyue as the overlordof the underworld. Dongyue temples often included individual shrinesand icons for the entire panoply of seventy-odd departments of the su-pernatural subsumed under the god’s spiritual domain.126Often theiconography depicted, in gruesome and frightening detail, the lackeys ofthe underworld inflicting punishment upon sinful mortals brought beforethe tribunals of the various departments. The author of an inscriptionwritten in 1284 to commemorate the rededication of Dongyue’s base tem-ple at Mount Tai observed with approbation that the temple’s numerousand lurid statues “startled the eyes and sent shivers through one’s heart,”and thus instilled in the people’s minds a proper sense of resolve to com-mit no evil.127The iconography of such temples in turn informed popu-lar understanding of the soteriological message of established religion.Popular mythology likewise depicted Dongyue as a stern and awesomejudge. Stories concerning Dongyue in Tales of the Listenerfeature threedistinct themes.128First, Dongyue is portrayed as presiding over the un-derworld, where he and his minions determine the fates of dead. By ex-tension, ghosts—the spirits of the dead—also fall under Dongyue’s au-thority. Second, Dongyue commands the legions of plague gods, whichhe periodically mobilizes to exact righteous punishment for sins of mor-tals. Third, the Dongyue temples serve as courts of appeal for mortals toobtain justice denied them by the terrestrial judicial system. All threethemes are also characteristic of popular tales about the chenghuanggods,although there are differences of emphasis, too: Dongyue is much moreprominent as ruler of the underworld, while punishment of wayward spir-172Song Transformation of Religious Culture"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"its and ghosts is more frequently mentioned in chenghuanglore. Despitethese nuances, it is clear that Dongyue and the chenghuangoccupied sim-ilar niches in the popular pantheon, that of sovereign gods who act asrulers over a given territory and all the gods, spirits, ghosts, and humanswho reside in it.The progressive elaboration of the divine hierarchy, a trend abettedby the state’s patronage of local cults, produced an uneasy tension be-tween the dual roles of local gods as patrons and protectors of the com-munity on one hand and as humble agents of a supreme divine will onthe other. This tension is exemplified by a case Hong Mai recounted inhis Tales of the Listener.Set in Suzhou in 1195, the story centers on aresident of the city named Zhou, who fell victim to terrible fevers andsought relief by taking refuge in the city’s chenghuangtemple. Unbe-knownst to the temple wardens, Zhou hides in the temple. At midnighthe witnesses the marvelous spectacle of the statues of the chenghuangand his retinue of supernumeraries coming to life. The chenghuangad-dresses the assembly of tudispirits, announcing that the supreme god,Shangdi, had issued a decree commanding the local gods to spread plaguethroughout the city. The tudiacknowledge their orders, but one of theirnumber protests that the inhabitants of his district, the Xiaoyi ward, weregood people who had committed no crimes. The chenghuangsternly re-minds the dissenting tudithat he is a spirit of lowly station who mustcomply with the supreme god’s directive. The tudithen asks that he beallowed to fill his quota of victims by afflicting children, a compromiseto which the chenghuangassents. The next day Zhou reports all that hehad seen and heard, only to be ridiculed for his mad delusions. A monthlater a terrible plague struck the city, yet in the Xiaoyi ward only chil-dren succumbed. The people of Suzhou then realized the truth of Zhou’sstory, and in gratitude to the tudispirit built a great temple in his honor.129In Hong’s tale, local deities cannot but accede to the will of the supremegods (who appear as capricious, or at least inscrutable, since no expla-nation for visiting plague on the city’s residents is given), just as a localmagistrate must execute imperial orders without fail. At the same timeit conveys the hope that local gods (and local magistrates, too) will becompassionate and merciful toward the people in their charge.regional cult centersThe increased mobility of Song society was reflected in the wider cir-culation of gods beyond their original homelands. Imperial sanction forSong Transformation of Religious Culture173"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"the proliferation of temples dedicated to gods like Dongyue and Zhenwu,protectors of the realm, led to the foundation of numerous branch tem-ples (xinggong)throughout the empire. Buddhist deities had never beenconstrained by the tradition that worship of tutelary spirits be confinedto a single locality, and the major Buddhist divinities, such as Guanyin,Maitreya, and Amitàbha, had become ubiquitous even before the Songperiod. Local cults also spread to surrounding regions. A few werecarried into the expanding networks of long-distance travel and trade,sinking roots in new host communities far removed from their place oforigin.Among the most mobile of cults were those dedicated to deities be-lieved to render assistance to young men aspiring for success in the civilservice examinations. Local gods like the King of Mount Yang (Yang-shan wang) in Yichun (Jiangxi), the King of Broad Munificence (Guang-you wang) in Shaowu (Fujian), and Zitong in Zitong (Sichuan) earnedreputations for the oracular pronouncements they delivered revealing thefate of examination candidates. Those who qualified to take the nationalexaminations at the Song capital often stopped at the home temples ofthese gods seeking to discover their destiny. Consequently the cults ofthese gods also became transplanted to the capitals of Kaifeng and Hang-zhou, though none of these examination cults became widespread untilZitong (rechristened as Wenchang) received official blessing as patron ofexamination candidates in 1316, when the Yuan dynasty reestablishedthe civil service examinations.130Hansen has drawn attention to the phenomenon of local cults spread-ing well beyond their native locality in the Southern Song, which she at-tributes to the expanded horizons of merchant networks and the for-mation of regional consciousness during this period. She identifies fourdeities whose cults acquired a region-wide following throughout south-eastern China in the Southern Song: Wuxian (“Five Manifestations”),Zitong, Consort Linghui (Linghui fei; “Consort of Miraculous Benedic-tion”), and King Zhang (Zhang wang).131In Hansen’s model, “regionalcults” are transformations of local tutelary deities of commoner origin,and the chief agents of transmission are merchants and other local in-habitants who travel widely. She therefore omits from considerationdeities such as Dongyue and Guanyin because of their institutional tiesto ecclesiastic religion. Yet even these four cults display marked varia-tion in character, origin, and range of distribution.The cult of Consort Linghui—better known by the title Empress ofHeaven (Tianhou), awarded to her by the Qing in 1737, or by her col-174Song Transformation of Religious Culture"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"loquial name Mazu—is the only one of these four cults to have receivedmuch scholarly attention prior to Hansen’s study.132The origins of Mazuhave been encrusted by many layers of myth, but most likely the cult co-alesced around the figure of a preternaturally prescient young womannamed Lin, renowned for her abilities as a fortune-teller, who died youngand was subsequently revered as a goddess in her native Putian, on theFujian seacoast. Like Sire Li, Lin was no ordinary commoner but a seerand medium whose premature death endowed her with a charismaticaura. After her death Lin was believed to come to the aid of seafarers en-dangered by storms. During the eleventh century her cult slowly spreadalong the Fujian coast, finally gaining imperial endorsement in 1123 af-ter she was credited with rescuing imperial envoys sent to Korea. Yet notuntil the thirteenth century were Consort Linghui temples founded inareas outside Fujian, with the exception of a temple in the internationaltrading entrepôt of Ningbo. The cult subsequently spread throughoutcoastal cities in the southeast, but it did not begin to penetrate the inte-rior, even in the goddess’s native Fujian, until the seventeenth century.King Zhang probably is the least familiar figure among these four cults,but his cult achieved unparalleled prominence (measured in number ofbranch temples) among the regional cults of southeastern China in theSouthern Song period. King Zhang’s base temple in Guangde prefecturein modern Anhui province, like those of other regional cults, became amajor pilgrimage site, attracting devotees from distant areas, and the siteof an important temple fair as well. Hansen notes that the King Zhangcult also spawned a host of subcults. Not only did King Zhang’s familyand relatives receive official investiture as deities, but in addition nu-merous non-consanguineal deities were adopted into the family of cultssheltered under King Zhang’s extensive patriarchy (including, for ex-ample, Sire Li).133King Zhang was said to have been a mortal of com-moner origin who lived during the Han dynasty. But the mythology con-structed around King Zhang recalls the civilizing exploits of the sage-kingYu, and his cult recapitulated features common to pre-Song cults dedi-cated to legendary settlers.Zitong, as noted above, became a patron of scholars because of hisreputation as an oracle who could predict one’s fate in the civil serviceexaminations. Zitong emerged as a local cult in northern Sichuan, a dis-tant frontier in the truncated Southern Song empire. Zitong evolved froma primitive serpent cult dating back to at least the fourth century, thoughby the Tang the deity had been euhemerized as a more salutary humanthaumaturge. A series of scriptures revealed at Zitong’s base temple be-Song Transformation of Religious Culture175"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"tween 1168 and 1194 enhanced the god’s popularity as a patron of theeducated elite and stimulated the diffusion of the cult to southeasternChina in the thirteenth century. In the southeast, Zitong temples werelimited to major cities and patronized mostly by educated men. (SinceWuxian, an apotheosis of Wutong, will be discussed in detail in the fol-lowing two chapters, I will only briefly observe here that the god wasnever identified with any historical figure, commoner or otherwise, andthat there is no evidence of merchant sponsorship in the disseminationof this cult.)The variations among these regional cults show that they do not con-form to a single model. The most consistent feature of these cults is theirassociation with a specific sacred site that becomes the cynosure of pop-ular devotion, even as the cults themselves spread to other areas. It seemslikely that cycles of festival and pilgrimage stimulated the diffusion ofthese cults. As Steven Sangren has recently pointed out, a reputation formiraculous power is not a sufficient explanation for the genesis andspread of cults; ultimately, the power of a cult derives from its potentialfor authenticating its devotees’ social experience and sense of identity.134Sangren emphasizes that pilgrimage plays a vital role in spreading andsustaining cults by providing a sacred domain in space and time thatunifies members of disparate communities and integrates their own dis-crete experiences through ritual and worship. Pilgrimage thus providesthe means whereby a cult can cross the threshold of the territorially dis-crete community that nurtured it and serve to validate the spiritual lifeof outsiders as well. The Buddhist cults of relics, once translated to Chi-nese soil, provided an important inspiration for Chinese patterns of re-ligious pilgrimage. Whereas older Chinese conceptions of the divine at-tributed the sacredness of a site to the potency of its resident deity, relicsunderscored the power of divine objects to endow a place with numi-nous power.135Annual festivals held at the base temples of renowneddeities drew worshipers from throughout the realm. Pilgrims returned totheir homes with tokens—such as images of the gods or ashes from thetemples’ censers—that provided the tangible link to the deity and the ac-tive yeast from which a branch cult and a new temple community wouldgrow.136Although it is true that gods circulated with their believers, itseems that the agents of transmission more often were worshipers fromthe new host community rather than evangelists from the deity’s placeof origin. Nor should we underestimate the role of clergy in disseminat-ing information about potent deities. As we have seen above, the Daoistpriest Deng Daoshu played the crucial role in the transmission of the cult176Song Transformation of Religious Culture"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"of Sire Li to its new home in Changshu, and the evidence from other re-gional cults also points to the important role of religious specialists inthe propagation of such cults.137Although Dongyue temples were initially linked to imperial patron-age of Daoism, in the Southern Song the Dongyue cult spread in a fash-ion similar to other regional cults. Worship of Dongyue, as with otherregional cults, was focused on a specific site that served as a national cultcenter. Of course, after the Jurchen conquest of north China in 1127Mount Tai itself was no longer accessible to any but the most intrepidpilgrims. In its stead the Dongyue temple at Fushanzhen (Changshu), atthe mouth of the Yangzi River, emerged as an alternate destination. TheFushan temple, first built on a mountain slope in the 1050s, was movedto a more convenient spot along the river in 1100, and then rebuilt on amore lavish scale in 1132. Local boosters, no doubt mindful of the sup-posedly temporary residence of the Song emperor at Hangzhou, dubbedFushan’s Dongyue temple the god’s “detached palace.”138It soon beganto attract hordes of pilgrims.139From the capital of Hangzhou down tothe region’s scores of market towns, Dongyue’s feast day was the crown-ing event in Jiangnan’s annual cycle of religious festivals. Thus, theDongyue cult cannot be labeled simply as a manifestation of institu-tionalized Daoism. The cult’s identification with a specific sacred place,the proliferation of branch temples claiming affiliation with the base tem-ple, the crucial role of popular support (notably in the forms of pilgrimageand festival) in sustaining the cult, its urban locus, and its diverse con-stituencies all suggest that the development of the Dongyue cult paral-leled that of other regional cults.The diffusion of the Guanyin cult proceeded in the same way. Ofcourse, the Buddhist ecclesiastic establishment actively encouraged de-votion to Guanyin. But the potency of particular shrines as sites of wor-ship and miracles was typically rooted in tangible instruments of divinemanifestation, above all in icons. As we have seen, the renowned statueof Guanyin at the Upper Tianzhu Monastery outside Hangzhou was theprincipal attraction for the throngs of pilgrims who made the monasterya famous shrine. The same pattern can be found in less exalted shrines,such as the Guanyin temple at the market town of Guangfu (Suzhou),on the eastern shore of Lake Tai. In 1040, in the midst of a drought, alocal resident found a bronze statue of Guanyin in the mud near thetown’s eponymous Buddhist shrine (Guangfusi), which was deemed apropitious omen. The inhabitants prepared ritual regalia and prayed be-fore the statue, whereupon rain immediately fell.140The fame of theSong Transformation of Religious Culture177"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"statue’s miraculous powers spread throughout Suzhou. Whenever thearea suffered from drought or flood, it became common practice for theprefect at Suzhou to summon the goddess’s aid by bringing the Guangfustatue to the city, where the civil officials conducted rites of propitia-tion.141In 1186 the statue was stolen, but it was recovered eleven yearslater. In 1275, as the Mongol armies approached, a monk took the statueand fled. The locals were forced to replace it with a wooden substitute,which over time was gilded and embellished with gold, jade, and silverornaments.142As the author of a commemorative inscription for theGuanyin statue at Guangfu (writing ca. 1086–94) observed, epiphaniesof Guanyin through miracle-working images were crucial to the creationof other major Guanyin shrines and pilgrimage sites at Upper Tianzhu,the Fenghuasi Monastery in Ningbo, and the Shuanglinsi Monastery inWuzhou as well.143Regional cult centers stood apart from the nested hierarchy of sover-eign and tutelary deities. While the latter ruled distinct territories andthus required mandatory worship and sacrifice from the communitydefined by the god’s jurisdiction, the regional cults were sustained by con-tinual manifestations of the god’s power (through miracle and revela-tion) and cycles of festival and pilgrimage that drew large numbers ofworshipers to the god’s temple. The communities of worship that gath-ered at pilgrimage sites were linked by common faith, in contrast to theascriptive membership in the cult groups (she)of local gods. The shrinesdedicated to these regional cults likewise stood apart from the territori-ally bounded temples of local gods. The regional cults prospered in pro-portion to the intensity of devotion they attracted from the populace atlarge. Yet these devotional cults—with the exception of Guanyin and heravatars—did not foster a sense of personal closeness between mortalsand divine beings. Instead, they recapitulated the patterns of subordi-nation of humble petitioners before powerful gods that we find in sov-ereign cults. This subordination is cogently expressed in the metaphori-cal language typically used to denote pilgrimage: “attending court at themountain to present tribute of incense [chaoshan jinxiang].”144The godsof the regional cults were the most exalted beings within the ken of or-dinary people, and thus inspired the kind of reverence and awe accordedto human monarchs.The Song period thus witnessed momentous changes in religious cul-ture. Preoccupation with death and atonement, increasingly baroque rep-resentations of postmortem punishment, and the sense of awe and ter-ror that the gods evoked cast long shadows over popular piety. Yet the178Song Transformation of Religious Culture"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"vernacularization of ritual and communication with the divine, in addi-tion to the development of new liturgical practices for laity in both Bud-dhism and Daoism, gave ordinary people greater access to the gods. Elab-orate hierarchies of gods and cults were constructed in response tochanges in social life and religious needs, and these cults in turn trans-formed the religious landscape, redefining ritual time (festival) and space(temple). The diffusion of religious lore accelerated through the spreadof the printed word and image, while the greater mobility of society wasechoed by the expanded circulation of cults and worshipers. The stateand ecclesiastic authorities sought to appropriate local cults for their ownpurposes, at the same time imposing their own definitions of orthodoxyand deviance, but popular devotion proved much too supple and cre-ative to be governed by these interventions. The mutability of the godstestifies to the salient role of the popular imagination in creating them.The devout faithful, either as individuals or through collective action,tried to establish reciprocal, symbiotic relations with the gods, provid-ing offerings and allegiance in return for protection and divine favor. Thefeminization of compassion in the forms of Guanyin and other goddessesis one reflection of this effort to establish a more personal relationshipwith the divine. Yet people never lost sight of their humble station beforethe sovereign might of the gods that controlled their destiny.The unified realm of the sacred that coalesced during the Song periodprevailed in Chinese vernacular religion throughout the late imperialperiod, and it remains the framework of Chinese religion today. Yet, al-though the structure of the religious universe has exhibited a basic sta-bility, the divine realm remained an arena of constant conflict, negotia-tion, and change. Tensions within human society exerted pressure on thedivine world as well. No aspect of Chinese religion exemplifies these ten-sions better than the Wutong spirits, to whom we now finally turn.Song Transformation of Religious Culture179"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"chapter 6Wutong: From Demon to DeityThe origins of the Wutong cult, like those of most popular deities, areobscured by time and myth. Many sources of Southern Song date or laterplace the beginnings of the cult in the Tang period. It is in the eleventhcentury, though, that the god first appears in the surviving literary record.From the outset Wutong possessed the diabolical attributes that sostrongly colored his later incarnation as a god of wealth. Yet Wutong alsofigured as a benevolent deity who succored the sick. Although the Wu-tong cult gained the endorsement of both imperial authorities and theDaoist establishment in the Song period, its origins among the demonicshanxiaomountain goblins were never effaced. Indeed, in Ming-Qingtimes the complex and multifaceted god of the Song era became over-shadowed, at least in Jiangnan, by the sinister character of the shanxiaofrom which it sprang.As we saw in chapter 3, the shanxiaowere particularly identified withthe Wuyi mountain ranges dividing the Gan River valley (Jiangxi prov-ince) from the southeastern littoral of Zhejiang and Fujian. Hong Mai,who provides us with the most extensive discussion of contemporary be-liefs about the shanxiao,traced Wutong to the shanxiaoof this region.1The shanxiaoof south China, Hong reported, were known by a varietyof local names: in Jiangnan and Jiangdong (in Song times, Jiangdong en-compassed northeastern Jiangxi, southern Anhui, and the westernmostpart of Jiangsu, including Nanjing; see map 3) the shanxiaowere knownby the name “fifth lad” (wulang); in the Gan River valley and Fujian180"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"they were called “third lad beneath the trees” (muxia sanlang)or “treelodgers” (muke); while the single-footed species was referred to as “one-legged Wutong” (dujiao wutong). Despite the variations in nomencla-ture all of these noxious inhabitants of the mountains and forests weredemonic poltergeists like the kui, wangliang,and shanxiaorecorded inearlier literature. Hong also likened these changeling demons to the foxspirits of the northern regions. Furthermore, he identified the Wild Youthsand Roving Eight Brothers (Yezhong you xiongdi baren), whom we havealready encountered as plague demons, as another species within thiscommon genus.Hong Mai also linked the muke,as he calls them, to the two domi-nant motifs of Wutong lore: the god’s roles as a capricious source of ill-gotten wealth and as a sexual predator. Small-minded people veneratedthem because they could bring sudden wealth to their clients, but eventhe slightest offense would cause the spirits to repossess whatever largessethey had granted.2At the height of summer the mukecame down fromWutong: From Demon to Deity181200 km0 100PoyangLakeGanRiverLake TaiQiantangRiverYangziRiverHUAINANJIANGDONGJIANGXILIANGZHEChizhouDexingFuzhouGuangdeHangzhouHuizhouJianchangJianchangjunJiangzhouJingdezhenNanchangNanjingNankangRaozhou(Poyang)SuzhouWuyuanWuzhouMountYunjuNMap 3.

Because they seem to appear and dis-appear at will, inhabitants of this region treated the mukewith the ut-most circumspection, diligently laying out offerings to purchase theirgood graces. By nature wanton and lascivious, the mukeoften disguisedthemselves as handsome gentlemen to seduce unsuspecting and vulner-able women. In their true forms they resembled apes, dogs, or toads, butthey were capable of mutating into different bodily forms and could moveat great speed. Their touch was as cold as ice, and they were endowedwith penises of impressive size.Women despoiled by these creatures lost consciousness and enduredpainful fits and convulsions lasting for days, even weeks, which oftenbrought them to the brink of death. Some of these women, upon regainingtheir wits, spoke of having been transported to splendid palaces wherethey enjoyed a life of sensuous pleasure. Once infected by the muke/shan-xiaothey acquired numinous powers, and many became spirit mediums.Others, however, descended into madness from which they never re-covered. Hong Mai devoted particular attention to the monstrous birthsthat resulted from sexual relations with such vile spirits. He related morethan a dozen cases, apparently all from his native Jiangdong, in whichintercourse with the muke/shanxiaoresulted in macabre pregnancies, de-formed newborns, and the madness and death of women (table 2). Songmedical lore recognized the danger posed to pregnant women by malig-nant ghosts, especially the wandering spirits of dead infants.3Althoughprecautions could be taken against demonic invasion, healers and sor-cerers had no cure for the progeny of monstrous shanxiao.Everywhere throughout the mountainous interior of south Chinapeople built small shrines dedicated to the muke/shanxiaocalled congci,or “grove shrines.” Congci,typically small, crude structures, were usu-ally placed at the foot of great trees or impressive cliffs believed to har-bor these spirits, which suggests that they were located in the wildernessrather than within village compounds.4Congciperformed an apotropaicfunction, keeping strange denizens of the forests at bay, but they also be-came sites at which local exorcists and spirit mediums practiced theirtrades. An official stationed in Zhenjiang in 1048 conducted a campaignto suppress congciprecisely because they harbored bands of “sorcerers”(wu)who “extort money and goods from the local inhabitants to fash-ion statues in the likeness of kui,sao[i.e., shanxiao], guimei,yiyang,andpanghuang,which they house together in their grove shrines [congci].”5This catalogue of congcideities is rife with literary allusions that betraythe author’s ignorance of the actual figures being represented, but all of182Wutong: From Demon to Deity"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"these terms refer to aberrant and terrifying shanxiaoand their kin.6Apoem entitled “Old Temple” by Wang Ling (1032–59) vividly capturesthe dread and alarm that images of such baleful creatures could provoke.Touring a temple fallen into disrepair, Wang finds the glaring visage ofthe resident god (identified only as the “Divine Lord” [shenjun]) intim-idating nonetheless.

Thestatue shown in figure 26, which may indeed be a Song-era image of theone-legged Wutong, displays the exaggerated facial features characteris-tic of demon iconography but otherwise is human in form. In any event,worship of Wutong almost certainly originated in these congcishrines,and in domestic shrines fashioned in imitation of them.8Ursula-Angelika Cedzich suggests that the name Wutong most likelywas first applied to demonic beings like the shanxiaoby Buddhist monksseeking to curb popular devotion to such deviant spirits.

Buddhist writingsreferred to those in possession of these powers as “Wutong transcen-dents” (Wutong xianren). Aberrant spirits of this type that appear in Bud-dhist demonologies are akin to the indigenous shanxiao.9In his magnumopus synthesizing Chan and Pure Land doctrines, the renowned monkYunming Yanshou (904–75) spoke of the fifth “power” (tong)as the “de-monic power” (yaotong), which he associated with fox spirits and the“changeling spirits of trees and rocks” that can assume human form. Yan-shou observed that supernatural powers can be used for good or evil,and that only the accomplished adept can discern truth from falsehood.Thus most laypersons fall prey to the deceptions of demonic spirits.10The earliest attestable reference to worship of Wutong appears in anessay entitled “Demolishing Idols,” written in 1016 by the Tiantai monk184Wutong: From Demon to DeityFigure 26.

Upon assuming the abbacy of the Ma’naoyuanCloister in Hangzhou, Zhiyuan discovered that the monastery housedicons of the tudiand Wutong spirits. Zhiyuan immediately removed theWutong idols, while redesignating the tudias guardian spirits of themonastery grounds (huqielan shen). He also observed that the inhabi-tants of Hangzhou commonly worshiped tudiand Wutong idols in theirhomes, a practice he found abhorrent. The name Wutong, Zhiyuan noted,derived from the Buddhist term abhijñà,but had been wantonly misusedto disguise the true nature of “demonic goblins and sprites.”11Zhiyuan’stestimony reveals that worship of Wutong spirits was already prevalentin Jiangnan in the early eleventh century, but it tells us little of the na-ture of this cult apart from likening the Wutong to goblins and demons.A thirteenth-century magistrate, in a commemoration for a chapel de-voted exclusively to the worship of Wutong founded by a Buddhist monk,stated that Wutong was widely venerated as a protector of the Buddhistfaith. His testimony suggests that icons like those Zhiyuan discovered inhis monastery represented the god as a fearsome temple guardian.12The new Daoist sects of the Song period, largely devoted to exorcismand therapeutic liturgies, also took an active role in stamping Wutongspirits as malicious shanxiao.Daoist exorcism manuals dating from theearly twelfth century and later grouped the Wutong together with theshanxiaomountain goblins.13The earliest extant ritual corpus of the Tian-xin tradition, Yuan Miaozong’s Secret Essentials on Assembling the Per-fected of the Most High for the Relief of the State and Deliverance of thePeople (dated 1116), identified the shanxiaoas emanations of anomaliesin cosmic regeneration roaming the world of mortals; the shanxiaoclaimto be sages and worthies, debauch women, cause floods and fires, hurlbricks and stones, play tricks on farm animals, and engage in all man-ner of mischief.14Other exorcism manuals, probably dating from theSouthern Song, described Wutong in similar fashion, and in particularstressed the deity’s predilection for assuming the form of a handsomeman who circulates among mortals and violates the sanctity of the mar-riage bed.15Hong Mai’s stories are replete with accounts of ritual ex-perts who use their skills as exorcists to expel demonic Wutong spirits;in one case the exorcist specifically employed the Tianxin ThunderMagic rituals.16Wutong also figured prominently in spirit medium cults.Mediums, usually females, invoked Wutong’s assistance in communi-cating with the spirit world.17Corroboration of the prominence of shan-xiao/Wutong in the mediumistic traditions of south China is furnishedby another late-twelfth-century writer, Xiang Anshi (d. 1208). QuotingWutong: From Demon to Deity185"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"a local gazetteer from western Hunan, Xiang stated that “the Wutongspirits derive from Qu Yuan’s ‘Nine Songs.’ Contemporary sorcerers ofLizhou refer to the father as ‘Grand Unity’ (Taiyi), and the sons as ‘Cloud-Empyrean Fifth Lad’ (Yunxiao wulang) or ‘Mountain Goblin Fifth Lad’(Shanxiao wulang).”18A magistrate stationed in Hunan in the thirteenthcentury repeated this genealogy of the Wutong spirits, adding that thesetwo brothers were one-legged kuigoblins who contemporaries wronglybelieved to be a group of five spirits.19Buddhist theologians and Daoist sorcerers thus invariably associatedthe Wutong with diabolical shanxiao.In the popular mind, too, the Wu-tong, especially in the personae of Wulang and the “one-legged Wutong,”were indeed identified with the shanxiao.20Popular images of Wutongreproduced all of the vices detailed in the exorcists’ manuals, but theyemphasized several features in particular. Above all, Wutong becameclosely associated with the acquisition and loss of wealth. In this respectthe deity did not simply fill an existing niche in Chinese conceptions ofsupernatural agents, as was the case with its identification as a speciesof shanxiao.Instead, Wutong’s emergence as a god of wealth betokeneda burgeoning phenomenon in Song society: success or failure in a com-petitive money economy brought about abrupt changes in personal for-tunes. It is not surprising that Chinese seeking to explain rapid oscilla-tions in personal wealth would turn to the gods; what is noteworthy isthat their attention focused on such a morally ambivalent figure.The capricious behavior that Wutong exhibited in his guise as a shan-xiaocharacterized his actions as a god of wealth. The Southern Song bib-liophile and raconteur Wu Zeng recorded a story, set in Kaifeng in themid-eleventh century, about a milliner who set up shop in one of the cap-ital’s most elegant neighborhoods. The milliner encounters a sportive andmerry group of five young men, one of whom, after a long bout of con-vivial drinking, offers to invest a large sum of money in the milliner’sbusiness. Subsequently the milliner discovers the skeletons in his new part-ner’s closets. Passing the night at his benefactor’s home, he surreptitiouslypeers into the adjacent rooms. One he finds full of women and childrennailed to the walls, while the other is packed with wailing prisoners inchains. The milliner, though greatly shaken, accepts his host’s money andhis business prospers. Wu Zeng offered no moral reading of this tale. Hemerely noted that people in Kaifeng say that the five men were the Wu-tong spirits.21Tales of the Listener also contains a number of stories confirming thatWutong had acquired a reputation as a notorious god of wealth. In one186Wutong: From Demon to Deity"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"story, a plebeian (xiaomin)receives from Wutong advance warning ofevery rise or fall in his fortunes.22In another, the sudden good fortuneof a Mr. Wu, a former sandal maker who strikes it rich as a vegetable-oil dealer, raises the suspicions of his neighbors. When thieves loot thehouses of several local notables, people accuse Wu of the crimes. Undertorture Wu confesses that he had been visited by a one-legged spirit whooffered him munificent rewards in exchange for sacrifices. After beingreleased Wu renovates a defunct one-legged Wutong shrine, where heholds nocturnal rites involving extravagant “bloody sacrifices,” duringwhich his entire family sits, “heedless of rank,” naked in the dark. Suchindecency, according to local lore, enabled the Wutong spirit to have hispleasure with Wu’s wife, who bore the deity’s offspring. Many years laterWu’s eldest son marries an official’s daughter, but the well-bred wife re-fuses to participate in these rites. Denied this sexual conquest, the godangrily visits pestilence upon the Wu household. Only after Wu and hiswife, along with the resolute daughter-in-law, fall ill and die, and theirhoard of cash is scattered by violent winds, does the Wu family regrettheir blasphemous idolatry and halt their sacrifices to Wutong.23Several elements of this story became hallmarks of the Wutong cult:a diabolical pact with a shady spirit; the seduction or rape of wives anddaughters; and the culmination in tragedy and dissolution of the fam-ily’s ill-gotten gains. Even unalloyed devotion to Wutong did not ensurebenefaction. Another of Hong Mai’s stories recounts the case of awealthy landowner who was a zealous devotee of the Wutong cult. Thedeity, impressed by the man’s piety, appears before him and requests ad-ditional offerings of bloody sacrifices. The landowner neglects his finan-cial affairs and exhausts his fortune ministering to the god’s increasinglyinsatiable needs. Several months later the hapless landowner’s wife anddaughter suddenly sicken and die. Finally the voracious demon is seizedby the minions of celestial justice, but the landowner receives no satis-faction for his losses.24Here, as in most stories concerning Wutong, thegod’s favor entangles his mortal votaries in a skein of costly devotionsand dire consequences.In only one of Hong Mai’s stories do the Wutong spirits appear to actas agents of moral justice, but even here the five deities bear little re-semblance to either austere paragons of Confucian virtue or the venge-ful warriors dispatched by Daoist celestials to exact divine retribution.Instead the deities are portrayed as Rabelaisian parodies of sensual ap-petite. In this account they descend upon the establishment of a Hangzhoubrewer, who makes a handsome profit by supplying food and drink forWutong: From Demon to Deity187"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"their night-long revels. The wanton prodigality of his patrons excites thebrewer’s greed, and he makes an audacious request for additional giftsof silver and silk. The gods merrily consent, but they enjoy the last laugh:when the brewer returns home he discovers that the henchmen of theWutong had in the meantime emptied his cupboards of every object ofvalue.25The popular image of Wutong, then, shared the diabolical features ofthe baleful demon appearing in exorcism manuals. At the same time Wu-tong captured the popular imagination by assuming the form of a godof wealth—not the avuncular benefactor common to modern Chinesemythology, but a caricature of caprice, latent misery masquerading asunexpected good fortune. Yet this was only one of the changeling god’smany personae. In this same period Wutong achieved not only re-spectability but also the highest imperial honors, and he became an avatarof both Buddhist bodhisattvas and the demon-expelling divine agents(lingguan)of Daoist sorcerers.In contrast to the cruel bogey who stalks the pages of Hong Mai’s an-thology, the Wutong spirit that became the focal deity of local cults wascast in a positive light. In the Southern Song period a number of places,all in the Poyang Lake basin, were identified as the original home of theWutong cult. In these local traditions Wutong assumed the form of a tute-lary deity and was often depicted as bringing relief from the scourge ofplague. The earliest text depicting Wutong as beneficent is Li Gou’s com-memoration for a Wutong shrine outside his native town of Jianchangjun(Jiangxi). Li composed this text in gratitude for Wutong’s aid in sparingthe lives of his family and fellow townsmen during an outbreak of plaguein 1034.26The relationship between these local cults and the demonicspirit of folklore is unclear. Certainly it is plausible that two separate cultsexisted, but I am inclined to speculate that the benevolent Wutong of thePoyang basin was a transfiguration of the noxious Wutong. Such transfig-urations of demons into servants of the Buddha were standard featuresof Buddhist morality tales, and became part of the literary lore concerningthe god’s origins in later times.It was perhaps the association with Buddhist wonder working thatinspired the notion of Wutong as a queller of plagues. One of the textsclaiming to identify the original home of the Wutong cult specificallylinked it to Buddhism. In an inscription dated 1233, Zhang Dayou statedthat the Biographies of Divinities (Shenzhuan)by Li Zeng (1119–93)traced the Wutong cult to the great Chan monastery at Mount Yunju inJianchang county, in Jiangdong circuit.27Zhang traveled to the monastery188Wutong: From Demon to Deity"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"to investigate further and was told by the elder monks that the cult orig-inated in an encounter between the eighth-century monk Daorong and“five divinities” (wushenren), who donated the land on which Daorongfounded the Yunjusi Monastery. Subsequently Daorong honored the fivespirits with the epithet Lords of Peace and Joy (Anlegong).28Hong Mai,in an anecdote set in the late eleventh century, reported that the Wutongspirits worshiped at the Yunjusi Monastery as the Lords of Peace andJoy were renowned for their miraculous powers.29The inhabitants of Dexing, founded as a silver mining town in the earlyTang dynasty, advanced an even earlier claim to the Wutong cult. Locallore in Dexing credited Wutong with having pointed out the location ofthe area’s silver deposits to a local hunter in 651.30Dexing natives at-tributed their economic prosperity to Wutong’s divine aid and eagerlysought official recognition of their claim to the Wutong cult. Interest-ingly enough, of Hong Mai’s twenty-four Wutong stories, three of thefour that cast the deity in a positive light are set in Dexing. In one ac-count Wutong delivers medicine to the local population to relieve themfrom pestilence, a gesture of compassion that recalls Li Gou’s benedic-tion of 1034.31The Song court, however, recognized not Dexing but the neighboringcounty of Wuyuan as the proper home of the Wutong cult. According tolocal tradition in Wuyuan, the Wutong cult originated in 886, when fivedivine beings were said to have descended from heaven and informed alocal resident that they had been assigned to serve as patron deities ofWuyuan. The people of Wuyuan built a shrine for these gods, who wonwidespread renown for the miracles they performed on behalf of the res-idents.32In the 980s, the magistrate of Wuyuan had a dream in whichthe Wutong spirits instructed him on how to exorcise a plague then rag-ing throughout the region. The dream occurred on the eighth day of thefourth month, coinciding with the feast day of Tàkyamuni Buddha.Henceforth the people of Wuyuan held a liturgical festival (zhaihui)onthis day to celebrate their deliverance from the plague.33In 1109, the Songemperor Huizong honored Wuyuan’s Wutong shrine with a plaque bear-ing the legend “Potent and obedient” (Lingshun). After the temple wasdestroyed during the Fang La rebellion a decade later, the same emperorsent another plaque, and invested Wuyuan’s Wutong spirits with the ti-tle of “sire” (hou).34Between these two events, however, a curious event occurred in thecapital. In the first month of 1111, Huizong issued an edict banning wor-ship of Wutong and two other deities identified as the objects of profaneWutong: From Demon to Deity189"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"cults (yinci). At the same time the emperor ordered the closing of 1,038shrines in Kaifeng and transferred the icons from those shrines to Bud-dhist, Daoist, or state-managed temples.35The intention of these edictsapparently was not to eradicate popular objects of worship, but ratherto strengthen state control over them. Huizong had fervently embracedDaoism, and under the tutelage of the Shenxiao priest Lin Lingsu he in-augurated an unprecedented effort to centralize and systematize thecertification of temples and cults. Huizong reversed his predecessors’ pol-icy of allowing local jurisdictions to compile their own registers ofsacrifices (sidian), and instead sought to establish a uniform national reg-ister. Above all, Huizong’s policies aimed to curb the activities of spiritmediums and restrict the conduct of religious observances and steward-ship of temples to ordained priests.36Though not specifically mentionedin Huizong’s edicts, the congcishrines with their shanxiaogoblins andattending spirit mediums surely would have been primary targets of per-secution. Moreover, the injunction against worship of Wutong in Kaifengwas consistent with official ritual regulations stipulating that worship ofgods must be confined to their native jurisdictions.Most likely the proscription issued in 1111 was directed against thenotorious Wutong of shanxiaolore rather than the officially recognizedcult in Wuyuan. In any case, Huizong’s efforts to assert central controlover local religion failed. The outbreak of the Fang La rebellion in Zhe-jiang in 1119, which subsequently spread to Jiangdong as well, forcedhim to reverse course in the matter of canonization of local gods. Insur-rection on such a large scale exposed the serious weaknesses of Huizong’sgovernment, and in its aftermath the court tried to repair its image byrecognizing local gods believed to have rendered aid in the suppressionof the rebellion. Seizing this opportunity, dozens of local communitiesthroughout Jiangnan and Jiangdong successfully lobbied for canoniza-tion of their patron deities.37It seems likely that the official recognitionaccorded Wuyuan’s Wutong shrine in 1123 was part of this wave of can-onizations. The Wutong cult at Wuyuan continued to enjoy official fa-vor throughout the Southern Song. In 1174, Wuyuan’s patron deities werepromoted to the status of “lord” (gong)and rechristened as Wuxian (FiveManifestations), and in 1202 they received a further promotion to thetitular rank of “king” (wang).The two neighboring counties of Dexing and Wuyuan competedfiercely for proprietary rights to Wutong/Wuxian. The eminent Confu-cian scholar-official Zhen Dexiu mentioned that while serving as vice-minister of imperial sacrifices in 1213–15 he had came across the peti-190Wutong: From Demon to Deity"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"tions requesting imperial honors for Wuxian from both Dexing andWuyuan.38Both sets of petitioners identified Wuxian as a group of fivebrothers surnamed Xiao, thus providing them with a more seemly hu-man ancestry untainted by any association with the demonic shanxiao.Hong Mai ascribed the origin of the cult to Dexing, and one of his sto-ries revolves around the efforts of Dexing inhabitants to secure officialrecognition for its Wuxian deity.39But the court consistently upheldWuyuan’s claim.40The stakes were high, since localities granted exclu-sive rights to the worship of a deity often became centers of pilgrimageand attracted spendthrift devotees from distant parts of the empire.Wuyuan did become such a major pilgrimage site in the Southern Songperiod.41The peak dates of pilgrimage to Wuyuan’s Wuxian temple were4/8, the anniversary of the god’s deliverance of the local community fromplague in the 980s, and 9/28, said to be the date of the original epiphanyof the Wutong spirits in Wuyuan in 886.42Naturally, both Dexing and Wuyuan claimed to be the original homeof the beneficent Wutong. Regardless of which assertion is closer to thetruth, once Wuyuan’s cult received imperial endorsement other commu-nities throughout south China sought to associate their Wutong templeswith the orthodox cult. Fragmentary records suggest that in addition tothe congcishrines in the countryside and the domestic shrines mentionedby Zhiyuan, temples dedicated to Wutong existed in major cities as wellby the tenth century.43A Wutong shrine adjacent to Yangzhou’s famousHoutu temple was said to be the site where Wang Jie, erstwhile merchantand master of alchemical arts patronized by the Emperor Zhenzong inthe first decade of the eleventh century, was said to have obtained cru-cial ingredients for his formulas.44There also is evidence for the exis-tence of a Wutong temple in Fuzhou (Fujian) in the early eleventh cen-tury.45A local prefect in Jiangling (Hubei) is said to have desecrated aWutong temple circa 1022.46The demonic form of the cult had reachedthe capital by the middle of the eleventh century, and the 1111 pro-scription of the Wutong cult in Kaifeng suggests that it achieved consid-erable popularity there. Hong Mai’s anecdotes demonstrate that Wutonginspired fear and devotion throughout Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Anhui, Fujian,and Zhejiang in the twelfth century. But dramatic growth of the beneficentform of the cult seems to have followed the sanction accorded by thecourt’s investiture of Wutong with an imperial title in 1123.As Zhiyuan observed—and Hong Mai confirmed—small neighbor-hood or household shrines dedicated to the demonic form of Wutongwere ubiquitous in south China. Imperial patronage encouraged the con-Wutong: From Demon to Deity191"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"struction of public temples dedicated to Wutong, usually in the name ofits now-official persona, Wuxian. In Suzhou, for instance, the first Wu-tong shrine within the city was built near the Zhili Bridge in 1127–30.The emperor’s promotion of Wuxian to the rank of king prompted a spec-tacular spurt in temple building. In 1203, a Suzhou monk brought backto his retreat wooden images of the “five kings” carved in Wuyuan.47This shrine, located in the fashionable southwestern quarter of the city,apparently attracted a considerable following. The monk soon hadsufficient funds to purchase adjacent property and renovate his retreat,and in 1225 a multistory galleried pavilion (ge)dedicated to another ofWutong’s incarnations, the bodhisattava Huaguang, was added to theshrine.48In 1209, another set of carved Wutong icons arrived fromWuyuan and was installed at the Guangxiao Abbey, a Daoist temple.49In the late 1230s, the main hall of the older temple at Zhili Bridge wasrestored and subsequently complemented with two Huaguang pavilions.A third shrine, one that would become the centerpiece of the Wutongcult in Ming-Qing times, was established at a former Buddhist monasteryon the crest of Mount Lengqie at Stone Lake, about ten kilometers south-west of the city, in 1265–74.50During the thirteenth century Wuxian, enjoying full imperial favor aswell as widespread popular homage, was honored with a great numberof shrines. At the end of the Song dynasty, Hangzhou and its immediatesuburbs contained at least nine Wutong/Wuxian shrines, six of whichwere found within the precincts of Buddhist monasteries (table 3 andmap 4). Jiangzhou, the port city at the mouth of the Poyang Lake, whereit flows into the Yangzi River, numbered five Wuxian temples, as did thecity of Jiaxing.51Branch temples were also established in other parts ofJiangxi. The Wuxian temple in Fuzhou was identified as a branch of theWuyuan temple.52Chen Chun, an inveterate critic of the excesses of pop-ular religion, ruefully acknowledged the popularity of what he called “theheretical Wutong cult shrines venerated by the people of this age” in anessay composed in 1217.53According to a Ming source, the frequent pro-motions of Wuxian within the imperial pantheon in the first half of thethirteenth century encouraged a rapid proliferation of temples dedicatedto the god: “the splendor of its incense and candles [i.e., votive offerings]was comparable to those of the Daoist and Buddhist divinities. Even inthe most distant prefectures and inaccessible counties its name and titleswere universally recognized.”54The chief architectural feature of many of these Wuxian temples, suchas those in Suzhou and the one located on the grounds of the Rongguosi192Wutong: From Demon to Deity"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"Monastery in Hangzhou, was a pavilion dedicated to the bodhisattvaHuaguang (Flowery Light).55The relationship between Wuxian andHuaguang, a fairly minor figure in Buddhist doctrine, is shrouded in mys-tery. The name Huaguang (Padmaprabha) appears in the third chapterof the Lotus SÜtraas the name by which Tàkyamuni’s disciple Tàriputrawill be known when he attains Buddhahood. Yet Tàriputra never appearsin recognizable form in popular lore about Wuxian/Huaguang. The nameHuaguang is also used to designate AMvakarJa, a Buddhist fire god.

Wuxian shrines in Southern Song Hangzhou"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"Journey to the South,a sixteenth-century vernacular novel featuringHuaguang, Huaguang appears as an incarnation of celestial fire, and al-lusions to AMvakarJa abound; for example, Huaguang’s divine father isidentified as the King of Horse-Ear Mountain (Maer shanwang), an al-ternate name for AMvakarJa (see below). Yet Song texts are silent aboutthe nature and origins of Huaguang and make no explicit connection be-tween Huaguang and AMvakarJa.The earliest association between Huaguang and the Wuxian cult, thebuilding of Huaguang pavilions at the Wuxian temples in the thirteenthcentury, is iconic rather than literary. Lu Yinglong, writing in the 1240sor 1250s, specifically identified Wuxian as “the one whom the Buddhistwritings refer to as Huaguang Tathàgata [Rulai],” an identification thatis echoed in Ming and Qing texts.56Huaguang and Wutong are not linkedin Hong Mai’s tales, though in one place Hong does describe the fourthof the Wuxian figures as “by nature fond of the Way; abiding in ritualpurity, he is solely devoted to distributing medicines and thereby accu-mulating hidden merit.”57It is this fourth member of the quintet who isusually identified with Huaguang. Wuxian and Huaguang are more ex-plicitly joined in the calendar of feast days. Both share the same feastday, the twenty-eighth day of the ninth lunar month,58and both are as-sociated with the great communal liturgies held on the eighth day of thefourth month (4/8), in concert with the festival in honor of TàkyamuniBuddha.59The earliest testimony connecting Huaguang to the Wuxiancult center at Wuyuan is a poem dating from the turn of the fourteenthcentury that includes a line listing the “Temple of the Imperially Invested‘Potent and Obedient’ King [i.e., Wuxian]; Tower of the Huaguang Bud-dha” among the notable sights in Wuyuan.60Huaguang is invariably as-sociated with Wuxian rather than Wutong, which suggests that the emer-gence of Huaguang as a Buddhist alter ego for Wuxian originated withthe Wuyuan cult.At the home temple of Wuxian in Wuyuan, assemblies known as “greatmaigre feasts in celebration of the supreme goodness and all-pervasivemercy (Apratihata) of the Buddha” (zhishan wuai dazhai)were held on4/8, attracting pilgrims from far away.61The Apratihata assemblies (wuai-hui,wuzhehui)had their origin in the mass convocations initiated by thepious Emperor Wu of the Liang dynasty (r. 502–49) to pray for relieffrom pestilence or express thanksgiving to the Buddha.62Unlike most“maigre feasts” (zhai), which were reserved for clerics alone, the Aprati-hata assemblies brought together laity and clergy in common worshipto earn blessings for the multitude, both dead and living.63The rela-Wutong: From Demon to Deity195"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"tionship between the Apratihata liturgies and Huaguang/Wuxian canonly be guessed at, but we should recall that the annual festivals atWuyuan’s Wuxian shrine originated as communal rites commemoratingWutong’s intercession on this same date to save the community frompestilence.Wuyuan’s Wuxian festival achieved perhaps unparalleled popularityin the Southern Song period. One of Hong Mai’s protagonists made apilgrimage to Wuyuan’s Wuxian temple in 1196 on 4/8 and worshipedthere for eight days before returning to his home in Chizhou (Anhui).64A Wuyuan gazetteer boasted that the festival even attracted pilgrims fromoverseas.65In the late Song a judicial intendant for Jiangdong circuit,alarmed at the pilgrims who flocked to the Wuxian festival at Wuyuan,tried to ban the festival, to no avail.66In the 1280s, immediately followingthe Mongol conquest, Wuyuan’s festival on 4/8 continued to draw de-vout followers of Wuxian from “the four points of the compass.” Thefestival, described as a “Buddhist assembly” (fohui), gave a considerableboost to the local economy. The presence of great numbers of pilgrimsmade the Wuxian festival one of the great annual temple fairs of theSouthern Song, and Wuyuan became “a hub for the merchants and trades-men of the whole subcelestial realm.”67The editor of a Yuan gazetteerof Kunshan county (Suzhou) noted with dismay the enthusiasm of Kun-shan’s inhabitants for undertaking pilgrimages to the Wuxian temple inWuyuan.68In the late Song, a monk returning to Kunshan from a pil-grimage to Wuyuan had brought back incense ashes that were used to aconsecrate a branch temple in honor of Wuxian.69In the thirteenth century, the custom of holding mass Wuxian festi-vals on 4/8 spread to Jiangnan as well. In the early 1240s, the two greatWuxian temples in Suzhou (both of which erected Huaguang pavilions)began to hold processions of Wuxian images around the city on the fourthand eighth days of the fourth month (the fourth was also associated withthe Tàkyamuni Buddha). The circumambulation of the city lasted pastnightfall, and the great display of lanterns, carriages, lavishly decoratedimages, and ritual paraphernalia surpassed the city’s renowned lanternfestivals. Henceforth these processions, accompanied by theatrical per-formances, became annual events.70Cult groups (she)in Hangzhou held“Wuxian kings’ assemblies to honor the Buddha” (wuxianwang qingfo-hui)on 4/8.71Presumably the Huaguang assemblies (Huaguang hui)heldon this date during the Ming dynasty were a continuation of this prac-tice. In the 1480s, the inhabitants of Hangzhou began to conveneHuaguang assemblies on 9/28 at a temple at Beixinguan, one of the ma-196Wutong: From Demon to Deity"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"jor commercial tax depots of the Ming empire and the site of a Wuxiantemple in Song times. In 1494, the spectacle attracted such large crowdsthat the Beixin Bridge collapsed under their weight, causing more thanthirty deaths.72This tragedy prompted local authorities to ban the event,though the assemblies lived on elsewhere. In the early sixteenth centuryHuaguang assemblies were held on 4/8 in Songjiang. By Qing times thecustom seems to have died out.73The most dramatic reversal of Wutong’s unsavory image was, asCedzich has observed, the god’s transfiguration into one of the divineagents (lingguan)invoked by Daoist sorcerers to expel baleful spirits suchas the shanxiaofrom which Wutong had descended. Tracing this re-markable rehabilitation is complicated by the difficulty of dating textsin the Daoist Canon, but it most likely occurred during the latter part ofthe thirteenth century. Two of the three texts in the Daoist Canonin whichWuxian appears as a demonifuge cannot be earlier than 1265, since thedeities are identified by the titles given to them by the court in that year.74The third text, the Wonderful Most High Dongxuan Lingbao Scriptureof the Basic Deeds of Huaguang,Agent of Five Manifestations,was notincluded in the recension of the Daoist Canonpublished in 1444–45; itappears only in the supplement added in 1607.75The Wuxian portrayedin this scripture represents a complete inversion of the noxious Wutongof yore. The Wuxian spirits assume the form of five Huaguang heavenlymarshals who are dispatched by the supreme deity of the Lingbao litur-gical tradition, Yuanshi tianzun, to protect the souls of sinful mortalsagainst the depredations of evil demons. The Huaguang/Wuxian spirits,which descend to the human world in many forms, are Daoist bod-hisattvas, charged with aiding mortals in their difficult journey to the af-terlife. They command a vast array of supernumeraries, including thun-der spirits and chenghuangand tudigods. Ironically, their foes are noneother than the shanxiao!The preponderance of evidence suggests that Wuxian’s transforma-tion into a powerful demonifuge followed the god’s elevation to the rankof divine “king” by imperial decree in 1202. In this instance Daoist ha-giographers apparently took their cue from the court. The sanction oforthodoxy accorded Wuxian by imperial canonization conferred notmerely legitimacy but also the aura of power. Practitioners of exorcismsubsequently enlisted Wuxian into the ranks of divine agents, and in do-ing so they completely severed Wuxian from his erstwhile demonic form,Wutong.Yet at least one Daoist text portrays the amalgam of Huaguang andWutong: From Demon to Deity197"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"Wuxian as a malevolent spirit reminiscent of the demonic Wutong. A ha-giographical account of the guardian deity Wen Qiong, written in 1274,identified Huaguang as the resident deity of a Wuxian shrine in Chizhou.The Huaguang spirit takes a liking to the concubine of the vice-prefectand seizes her soul, causing her death. The vice-prefect’s subordinatespersuade him to summon a local “man of the Dao” skilled in the eso-teric rites used to invoke the aid of warrior spirits. This sorcerer conjuresup the Huaguang spirit (who identifies himself as “the fourth Huaguangbodhisattva of the prefecture’s Temple of the Five Kings”) and demandsthat he relinquish the woman’s soul. The spirit refuses, forcing the ex-orcist to invoke the aid of Wen Qiong. Wen vanquishes the incarnationof Huaguang and chops off his head. Although the temporal authoritiessubsequently destroy the temple at Chizhou and its images, the unre-pentant spirit scoffs at the power of the exorcist and proclaims that hedraws his power from all the sacred mountains and rivers; although nolonger able to draw sustenance from offerings at the Chizhou shrine, hewill continue to thrive elsewhere.76In addition to the association with Huaguang, during the SouthernSong the Wuxian cult also began to appear under the alternate nameWusheng (Five Saints). The sobriquet Wusheng first appears in connec-tion with the Wuxian branch shrines in Hangzhou, but the close con-nection to the Wuxian shrines suggests a possible origin in Wuyuan.77Indeed, the Wuyuan native Hu Sheng (fl. 1269), in an apologetic defenseof the legitimacy of Wuyuan’s Wuxian cult, declared that “some peopleequate the Wusheng [spirits] and the Wutong, but this view is wrong.”78The implication, of course, is that Wuyuan’s imperially ordained Wusheng(i.e., Wuxian) cult should not be confused with the demonic Wutong.The name Wusheng appears only once in Hong Mai’s anthology. In ananecdote dated to 1177, an examination candidate from Fujian is said tohave prayed for success at a “Wusheng branch temple” outside Hang-zhou’s Qiantang Gate. In this instance the temple was said to be affili-ated with the temple at Dexing rather than at Wuyuan.79Thirteenth-century gazetteers of Hangzhou confirm that there was a Wusheng templeat this location (see table 3, number 1) but make no mention of an affili-ation with either Dexing or Wuyuan. In another anecdote from Tales ofthe Listener,a shanxiaodemon identifies himself as “Wutong jiusheng”;Hong Mai appends a note stating that Jiusheng, Wutong, and shanxiaowere all interchangeable names for the same class of demons.80Con-ceivably the appellation Wusheng originated from a conflation of thetwo terms Wutong and Jiusheng. But both Daoist writings and popular198Wutong: From Demon to Deity"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"hagiographies of the Yuan and Ming periods consistently identify Wu-sheng with Wuxian, not the demonic Wutong (figure 27).81The transformation of Wutong into Wuxian/Wusheng did not entirelyeclipse the demonic form of the cult, however.

The spirit repays the family with riches, includingan infant boy for the childless woman, although the child later died atage six.83A fourteenth-century catalogue of zajudrama even includes apiece entitled “The One-Legged Wulang.”84By the end of the Song dynasty Wuxian had become one of the mostprevalent and widely celebrated cults across southern China. Scattereddata on Song temple building culled from surviving gazetteers suggestthat among popular cults, the number of Wuxian temples was exceededonly by those dedicated to King Zhang.85In the Yuan dynasty the or-thodox Wuxian still enjoyed imperial favor. Although the cult’s centralshrine at Wuyuan was destroyed during the Mongol conquest, one ofWuyuan’s wealthiest lineages, the Wang, rebuilt the temple and donatedlands for a permanent endowment.86In 1314, the Wangs persuaded thecourt to issue an imperial plaque, bearing the legend “The five potentand obedient eternal bodhisattvas” (Wanshou lingshun wu pusa), to markyet another restoration of the Wuxian temple.87Renewal of imperial gracespurred similar rehabilitation projects elsewhere. In 1317, the branch tem-ple at Suzhou’s Zhili Bridge, which had received an endowment of rentalproperty and built its second Huaguang pavilion two decades earlier, wasrenamed the Wanshou Lingshun Temple and supplemented with a treas-ure hall.88The imperially designated main shrine at Wuyuan apparentlydwindled in significance by the end of the fourteenth century, however,while Hangzhou, with its many Wuxian temples, emerged as the centerof the cult. At the end of the Yuan the common folk of Huating (the seatof Songjiang prefecture) formed cult assemblies (huishe)dedicated toWuxian “in imitation of the custom in Hangzhou.”89Ming sources uni-formly assert that Wuxian originated in Wuyuan, yet at the same timethey usually identify the people of Hangzhou as the cult’s most enthusi-astic adherents.The establishment of the Ming dynasty in the second half of the four-teenth century resulted in a profound shock to popular religious life, inJiangnan in particular. The Ming founder Zhu Yuanzhang (EmperorTaizu, r. 1368–98) took unprecedented measures to bring religious lifeunder the heel of the state. At the very beginning of his reign, in 1370,Zhu enacted far-reaching religious reforms intended to abolish all “pro-200Wutong: From Demon to Deity"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"fane cults” (yinci)and impose a tightly regulated system of officialsacrifices in their place. In contrast to the personalized, charismatic deitiesof popular religion, the state-mandated cults of the Ming dynasty weresuffused with the stultifying hierarchy and anonymity that pervaded thesecular state bureaucracy. The transformation of the chenghuangculttypified the new state religion of the Ming. Under the new system ofofficial cults decreed by Zhu Yuanzhang, the chenghuangbecame the fo-cal cults for each level of the administrative hierarchy, extending fromthe various branches of the central government at the capital down tothe provinces, prefectures, and counties. Consequently, the distinctivepersonalities of the old chenghuang were erased. Simple wooden tabletsbearing the deity’s official title but no personal names replaced theanthropomorphic iconography of the old chenghuang.Worship at thechenghuang temples was restricted to the official spring and autumn cer-emonies over which the chief local official presided.90At the same time the government forbade private worship of any othergods, exempting only domestic rites dedicated to one’s ancestors and thestove god. In an effort to inculcate proper moral temperament and com-munity values, the Ming required its subjects to attend communal reli-gious observances conducted twice a year, at the spring and autumnequinoxes. One of these ceremonies was intended to revive the ancientcustom of offering prayers of thanksgiving to the soil and grain spirits(sheji); the other, modeled on ancestral rites, entailed making offeringsto the orphan souls of the unworshiped dead so that they, like the an-cestors, may rest in peace for eternity.91Although evidence from localgazetteers indicates that local officials indeed set up altars to the soil andgrain spirits and the unshriven dead, Zhu Yuanzhang’s new religious or-der sank only shallow roots in the countryside, and after his death leftlittle trace in the rural religious landscape.The fist of official proscription fell much more heavily on cities andtowns, however. Certainly the chenghuangcults, largely confined towalled towns, underwent radical transformation. The rash of imperialedicts prohibiting (among other religious activities) public liturgies,graven images of the gods, and communication with the gods throughmediums, “petitions,” and spirit writing must have muted public displayof religious piety in towns and cities. Moreover, Zhu Yuanzhang wentfar beyond any of his predecessors in decreeing that Buddhism and Dao-ism, no less than the gods of the ignorant masses, were potentially pro-fane forms of worship that must be strictly monitored and regulated. Tocurb the propagation of deviant teachings under the aegis of the Bud-Wutong: From Demon to Deity201"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"dhist and Daoist orders, Zhu ordered a massive consolidation of Bud-dhist and Daoist temples. The two religions were permitted only a singlemonastery or abbey each within any given county. Though such a dra-conian reduction in shrines proved unfeasible, organized religion was morevulnerable to imperial whim than the refractory multitude of popular cults.In Wujiang county, for example, only twenty-one Buddhist temples anda single Daoist one survived the consolidation of shrines, and more than110 were closed.92The edict consolidating Buddhist and Daoist shrineswas relaxed by the Yongle emperor (r. 1402–20) in 1403, but many tem-ples had suffered an irreparable loss of vitality and prestige.The surge of lay piety galvanized by the White Lotus and similar move-ments during the Southern Song and Yuan periods was deemed especiallypernicious by Zhu Yuanzhang, who once had close ties to a White Lo-tus group. Zhu branded the White Lotus a heterodox sect in 1370 andruthlessly persecuted any suspected adherents. Elite families of the YangziDelta, already terrorized by Zhu’s social and economic policies, soughtto expunge the taint of religious heterodoxy by scrupulously avoidingany association with White Lotus groups or religious practices. Subse-quently, “White Lotus” became an invidious label that might be appliedto any group or activity that deviated from the Ming state’s canon of re-ligious conduct.93Nonetheless, Wuxian occupied such an exalted place in the religiousfirmament that Zhu Yuanzhang included a Wuxian temple among theTen Imperial Shrines raised in 1388 outside his new capital at Nanjing.94The official dedication noted that Wuxian had unfailingly heeded theprayers of the people of Wuyuan for deliverance from flood, drought,and pestilence. At the same time it described the Five Manifestations inthe abstract terms of the cosmic principles of order that governed thenatural world.95Wuxian thus became one of the few cults of distinctlypopular origin to receive recognition as a national cult.96Active impe-rial sponsorship of the Wuxian cult did not survive the relocation of theMing capital to Beijing in the 1420s, however. Although Ming officialscontinued to perform the semiannual sacrifices at the temple outside Nan-jing, the Yongle emperor and his successors took no interest in Wuxian.Imperial patronage instead focused on figures such as Zhenwu, Guan Yu,and Mazu.Over the course of the Ming, worship of Wutong/Wuxian graduallyfaded in many areas. In Jiangdong/Jiangxi, the birthplace of the Wuxiancult, popular devotion to Wuxian ebbed. Wuyuan no longer attractedlarge numbers of pilgrims, though Wuxian temples were still common202Wutong: From Demon to Deity"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"in the region.97Interestingly, Huaguang became an important cult figurein the religious landscape of the rising porcelain manufacturing centerof Jingdezhen, just downriver from Wuyuan. In the sixteenth century,Jingdezhen grew into a major city, swelled by the arrival of immigrantsfrom neighboring areas like Wuyuan. A Huaguang temple was built ad-jacent to the imperial factory, which supplied the imperial capital’s needfor porcelain wares. Imperial officials on several occasions attempted toconvert the temple for use as factory offices, only to be rebuffed by thecity’s potters, who claimed that the god rendered aid to ensure the suc-cessful firing of the kilns.98In Fujian, the benevolent Wuxian/Huaguang cult flourished, but thediabolical Wutong largely vanished. In the mountainous interior of Fu-jian, long associated with shanxiaolore, worship of Wutong was grad-ually eclipsed by the Wuxian/Huaguang cult of Wuyuan. A prefect serv-ing in Jianning in the mid-thirteenth century reported that it was thecustom in Fujian to hold lavish festivals in the ninth month in honor ofthe birth of the “five kings,” an unmistakable reference to the 9/28 feastday of Wuxian.99A 1258 gazetteer of Tingzhou lists three Wutong tem-ples in the prefectural seat or its immediate environs; at least two of themdated to the twelfth century. In the first half of the thirteenth centuryfour Wuxian branch temples were established in smaller towns through-out the prefecture; in one, built in the 1220s, a Huaguang pavilion wasadded in the 1250s.100A sixteenth-century gazetteer attests to diminishedofficial sponsorship of the cult: only one of the Wutong temples still re-ceived mention and two of the Wuxian temples had been converted toother cults as part of the early Ming religious reforms, although four Wu-xian temples had been raised in newly settled outlying areas.101Subse-quently Huaguang prevailed as the centerpiece of this cult down to mod-ern times. Although Huaguang continued to be identified with spiritscalled Wutong and Wuxian, no trace remained of the cult’s demonic ori-gins or its links to the shanxiaoinhabiting the surrounding wilderness.102The Wutong temple in Fuzhou, said to have been lavishly patronizedby the great families of the region in Song times, suffered decline in theMing.103The original temple fell into disuse at some unspecified date,but subsequently a Wuxian shrine was erected above the city’s main gate.Another Wuxian shrine was founded in the provincial fiscal intendant’syamen in 1388, at the time of Wuxian’s induction into the Ten ImperialShrines.104By the late Ming, though, the city gate temple was largely de-funct.105Yet the Wuxian/Huaguang cult continued to thrive in sur-rounding areas.106By the early seventeenth century, a group of plagueWutong: From Demon to Deity203"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"deities known as the Five Emperors (Wudi) emerged as one of Fuzhou’smost prominent popular cults. It is possible that the Five Emperors rep-resent a metamorphosis of the Wuxian cult. Yet the mythology and litur-gies constructed around the Five Emperors differ markedly from Wuxian,though they bear close resemblance to other plague deities, such as theWen Qiong cult in adjacent southern Zhejiang.107Although the cult of the demonic Wutong receded or was effaced inmany parts of south China during the Ming, in Jiangnan it became deeplyinsinuated in popular mentality and religious life. The persistence of thedemonic Wutong was reflected in nomenclature. Ming exegetes note thatin Jiangnan the god was sometimes known as Wutong, or alternativelyas Wulang, but perhaps most commonly as Wusheng, a name closely as-sociated with the worship of Wuxian in the Hangzhou region.108The ti-tle Wuxian appears only rarely in the middle and late Ming, generally inthe names of temples. By the mid-Ming period the beneficent figure ofWuxian derived from the ancestral cult of Wuyuan had become virtuallydefunct. Most late Ming and Qing sources indiscriminately lump Wu-xian and Wusheng together with the pernicious Wutong. Major Wuxianshrines refurbished under government auspices during the Ming failedto attract lasting support from either lay devotees or the Daoist and Bud-dhist priests. In Suzhou, for example, the Wutong temple at MountLengqie, just outside the city, eclipsed the Wuxian shrines within the cityas the center of cult activities.109Yet it was in the arena of domestic rit-ual life rather than great communal events that Wutong penetrated thelives of virtually every household, even the most exalted ones, in MingJiangnan.Virtually all accounts of the Wutong cult from the early sixteenth cen-tury observed, with evident dismay, that a small yet magnificently em-bellished Wutong shrine could be found in nearly every Jiangnan court-yard, usually just inside the gate leading to the street.110These smallshrines, a mere three or four feet high, gave rise to a curious legend claim-ing that the Ming founder created the Wutong cult. According to this ac-count, after conquering his rivals, Zhu Yuanzhang had a dream in whichtens of thousands of soldiers who had died in his service implored himto provide sacrifices for the benefit of their wandering souls. Upon awak-ening the emperor ordered that every household in Jiangnan set up a smallaltar and make offerings to the souls of the dead soldiers (who were as-signed, in detachments of five, to the various domestic shrines).111Thislegend, preserved in a number of Qing sources, cannot be corroboratedby the extant records of Zhu Yuanzhang’s reign (or, as far as I can de-204Wutong: From Demon to Deity"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"termine, by any Ming records).112It is highly unlikely that Zhu’s pa-tronage of Wuxian, mentioned above, extended to Wutong, and in anyevent the Wutong cult had far more ancient origins.113The story doestestify, however, to the prevalence of the Wutong shrines. In addition,this undoubtedly spurious legend imbued the Wutong cult with an auraof legitimacy that helped to shield it from outright condemnation by trib-unes of Confucian piety.The earliest accounts that give a fairly full description of domestic rit-ual practices date from the turn of the sixteenth century.114Typically theubiquitous domestic shrines included five figurines adorned with royalraiment, who represented the Wusheng or Five Saints, plus five consortsdressed as empresses. Shrines to Wutong also included images of the god’smother, known simply as the Grand Dowager (Taima), other generic cultfigures (such as Guanyin, chenghuang,and tudi), and a host of divinesupernumeraries who comprised Wutong’s retinue.115Those too poor toafford such shrines but not wishing to be derelict in their devotions sim-ply hung a print or drawing of the deity mounted on a wooden tablet.The reverence with which such icons were regarded is revealed in HuangWei’s (1490 jinshi) description of heads of households burning incenseon their way to the artisan’s workshop to fetch tablets and statues ofWutong for their domestic altars.116The Wutong cult spawned, in addition to the Grand Dowager, a co-terie of subordinate deities who became cult figures in their own right,with their own temples and devoted followings. Most prominent amongthese “lackey enforcers” was Lord Ma (Magong), reputed to be Wutong’suncle, though this figure undoubtedly derived from Wutong’s incarna-tion as the Daoist Heavenly Marshal Ma (see pp. 213–20 below). An-other “lackey enforcer,” Premier Song (Songxiang) was portrayed as afearsome figure associated, as an officer of the infernal Water Bureau(Shuifu), with death. In late Ming times the city of Suzhou contained atleast three shrines dedicated to him. King Zhou Xuanling, whose cultoriginated in Dexing, likewise was considered one of Wutong’s hench-men.117The god’s image was inadvertently brought to a Buddhist monas-tery in Suzhou, where it acquired considerable notoriety and an impas-sioned following.118The most prominent feature of the Wutong cult was the “tea séance”(chayan). During this night-long rite spirit mediums used esoteric lan-guage and song to conjure up the Wutong spirit and convey the wishesof their clients. Preeminent among the mediums who performed such riteswere women who boasted of their expertise in the techniques of “dis-Wutong: From Demon to Deity205"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"pelling fright” (shoujing)and “visualizing spirits,” and who claimedknowledge of “occult teachings” (yinjiao)obtained through sexual in-tercourse with the god.119During the course of the ritual the host fam-ily presented munificent offerings of spirit money and bloody sacrificesto the god.120One observer reported that during the tea séance imagesof a number of other deities, including Huaguang, were worshiped.121Patrician and plebeian families alike resorted to the tea séance to seekthe god’s favor in all matters of dire concern.The image of Wutong in Ming popular culture demonstrates that thesanctity bestowed on Wuxian by imperial and ecclesiastic authorities didlittle to alter the conception of Wutong as an actively maleficent, indeeddemonic, figure who preyed on the weak and vulnerable. Diviners hiredto determine the causes of illnesses often traced the affliction to Wutong,in which case patients were advised to forsake medical aid as futile andresign themselves to the inevitability of death. In some cases Wutong wasperceived as little more than a prankster who harassed human beings bycausing furniture to move or by breaking down doors; at other timespeople accused Wutong of stealing valuables or setting fire to their homes.Prayers and sacrifices were offered to Wutong less to ask for blessingsthan to ward off calamity.From an analysis of a set of fifteen stories collected by Lu Can duringthe 1510s and published in his book Gengsibiantwo distinct profiles ofthe popular image of the god emerge.122In one set of stories (table 4,numbers 1–7) Wutong appears as a mischievous imp who is easily of-fended by human beings and causes unnatural events to occur. For ex-ample, one story begins with a literatus desecrating an image of Wutongby urinating on it. The incensed god thereupon begins to harass his fam-ily by battering doors and scattering excrement throughout the house.On one occasion the god snatches a bag of coins into the air. When thehousehold servants curse the perpetrator of this magic the bag falls tothe floor, spilling coins throughout the room; upon being picked up thecoins are hot to the touch. Other episodes describe Wutong engaging inmalicious mischief without apparent cause. Efforts to appease Wutongby making offerings seem to have little effect. In this group of stories theafflicted persons usually resort to exorcism or the destruction of the de-ity’s temple before the vexations cease.A second group of stories (numbers 9–15) reveals a far more sinisterand diabolical portrait of Wutong. The central theme of these narrativesis the god’s possession of women through ecstatic trances or sexual li-aisons. In some cases we are told of a woman who is suddenly possessed206Wutong: From Demon to Deity"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"by the spirit and begins to behave in a lunatic manner, wildly dancingand singing, before she eventually succumbs to irremediable insanity.123In other stories Wutong appears as a handsome and radiantly attiredyouth who bedazzles susceptible young women just entering a liminalstage of life (puberty, betrothal, or marriage) and entices them into sex-Wutong: From Demon to Deity207table 4. motifs of wutong stories in lu can’s gengsibian(ca. 1520)MotifStory Number123456789101112131415Appearance of deityDesecration of temple/icon • •Apparition • • • • •Possession of woman • • • • •(at time of marriage) • • •Intercourse with woman • • • • • •Supernatural manifestationsMagic • • • • •Affliction • • • • • •Exhaustion of wealth•Palace of riches • •Bestows supernatural • •powersBestows wealth  •  •  •Calamitous consequencesInsanity • •Premature death • •Unable to marry•DenouementDestruction of temple•Exorcism • • •Propitiation • •(unsuccessful)Intervention of higher god  •  •Accepted by family • • • •God tires of woman • •and leavessource:Gengsibian,4.40–41, 5.51–54, 5.65, 6.73, 9.101."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"ual intercourse. In return, the god offers riches to the woman and herfamily. The woman’s husband or father does not necessarily regard theblatant violation of chastity and marital fidelity as a misfortune. On thecontrary, they profit from the deity’s largesse and encourage him to re-turn.124The god’s attentions and munificence are unpredictable, how-ever, and in most cases they are ultimately withdrawn, as the followingstory illustrates.A rice merchant in Jiangyin had a daughter of comely appearance who,soon after beginning to wear hairpins [i.e., reaching the age of eligibility for marriage], was suddenly possessed by a spirit. A handsome and robustman seen entering the girl’s bedchamber had sexual intercourse with her.The spirit called himself Wusheng. The woman’s parents summoned a spiritmedium to rid her of this affliction, but his efforts were to no avail. In theend the family had no choice but to accept the spirit’s comings and goings.Whatever the young woman desired, regardless of whether it was out ofseason or from some distant land, she had but to lift her finger and it wouldappear. Sometimes the spirit would fill her room with gold, silver, pearls,and the like, but after letting her play with these a while he would snatchthem away and refuse to give them back. The woman once saw severalthousand ingots of gold piled in the corner of her room. But when she tried to pick them up, as soon as her hand touched them the gold turnedinto tiles and stones, or objects made of paper. Once she put them downthey again transformed into gold.125In the above story Wutong bestows riches that whet the impressionableyoung girl’s appetites, but in the end they prove to be as evanescent asthe god himself. The ephemeral nature of Wutong’s gifts and the deity’sunderlying diabolical purposes are exposed more forcefully in the fol-lowing tale, which combines the lure of material goods with perhaps themost treasured gift of all, sons.Madame Lü, wife of Mr. Shen and the daughter of an eminent family, sur-passed all others in her domestic skills and physical beauty. At the age ofnineteen she suddenly fell down dead; but after two days passed she beganto revive, and she told the following tale: “I was summoned by the DivineLord Wusheng to attend a feast. The deity displayed a chest of gold head-gear and ornaments, and sixteen chests of fine clothes, which, though tinyin size, shone brilliantly and dazzled my eyes. The god told me, ‘If you con-sent to live here, all of these treasures will be yours.’ I cried and begged toreturn home, and his ladies-in-waiting repeatedly urged him to release me.Finally the god relented and gave me permission to come back, saying thathe would grant me another ten years of life.”From this time forward the deity occasionally visited the Shen house,addressing Madame Lü as “wife” [niangzi]. At these times members of the208Wutong: From Demon to Deity"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"household were struck by a strange fragrance, whereupon they saw arrive a fair young man in fine clothes who would spend the night in MadameLü’s chamber. Ten years later Madame Lü again died, and once more shereturned to life, saying that the god had told her that he would allow heryet one more year of life. In all Madame Lü bore five sons. Whenever shewas about to give birth Madame Lü excreted a trickle of black liquid, butshe did not bleed. Each of the sons was exceedingly beautiful, but after one full year passed the god would reappear and say, “I am now taking the child away.” And sure enough, all five sons died prematurely. FinallyMadame Lü gave birth to a daughter, but as soon as the infant emergedfrom her body the blood began to flow back into her womb and she died.Exactly a year had passed since the day she had come back to life.126The import of Wutong’s favors is clear: sexual indulgence brings transi-tory delights but leads all too quickly to tragedy.In most of the stories in this second group women come to a bad end,suffering madness, death, or the living death of spinsterhood. Lu Can’sdepiction of Wutong as an incubus who lures young, vulnerable womeninto sexual relations by bestowing riches on them is confirmed by othercontemporary anecdotes.127By the seventeenth century this facet of thegod’s character overshadowed malicious mischief as the dominant mo-tif of Wutong lore. Thirteen of the nineteen Wutong tales related in QianXiyan’s Garden of Cunninginvolve debauchery of wives or seductionof women; another deals with the sexual conquest of a young man (table5). Although the shanxiao motif is still present in Qian’s stories, it is de-cidedly secondary to transactions involving the exchange of women forwealth. In Qian’s accounts, as in Lu’s a century before, the woman’s hus-band or family proves willing to give her up in exchange for the prom-ise of riches. This feature of the Wutong cult is all the more remarkableconsidering that the sixteenth century also witnessed the growth of a cultof female chastity that honored the families of women who adhered torigid standards of marital fidelity and sexual purity, and demanded thatwomen expiate any stain on their virtue by taking their own lives.128Con-fucian savants like Lu Can usually expressed horror or pity rather thancontempt toward women suffering from demonic possession. However,the costly sacrifices consecrated to Wutong elicited harsh condemnation,as did the female spirit mediums who beguiled the benighted commonfolk with fraudulent claims of occult powers. In the late fifteenth andearly sixteenth centuries the popularity of the manifestly diabolical cultof Wutong provoked local magistrates to try to eradicate it.In 1445, the newly appointed prefect of Suzhou, Li Congzhi, issuedorders to destroy domestic shrines dedicated to Wutong.

His death naturally was interpretedas a consequence of angering the potent and vengeful god, and the mem-ory of this show of malevolent power reportedly deterred later munici-pal officials from taking such a brazenly hostile stance against the Wu-tong cult.129In 1488, the magistrate in the city of Changshu destroyedmore than one hundred Wutong icons and converted the desecratedshrines into schools, storehouses, naval barracks, and other public fa-cilities.130Several years later the prefect of Suzhou banned worship ofWutong and consigned images of the deity to fire, but as soon as theofficial was rotated out of office popular worship of Wutong resumed.131In 1520, around the time that Lu Can’s work was completed, a prefec-tural judge in Songjiang destroyed the images of Wutong and his retinuein that city’s major temple, which was subsequently converted into ashrine for the Tang dynasty official Lu Zhi, a more seemly exemplar ofConfucian virtues.132Likewise, in 1496 the magistrate of Jiangyin con-verted his city’s Wutong temple into a shrine dedicated to a Tang dynastygeneral.133The furious campaigns of suppression mounted by local officials didlittle to deter popular devotion to the Wutong cult. After 1520, overt ef-forts to suppress the cult largely ceased, and the cult flourished through-out Jiangnan as never before. Local magistrates, perhaps weary of thefutility of eradicating such an intractable foe, apparently gave up thestruggle, and public display of cult activities revived.134Despite the des-ecration of Changshu’s Wutong temple in 1488, at the beginning of theseventeenth century a temple for the Wutong of Good Merit (Fude Wu-tong) could be found in the watchtower over the city’s main gate.135Anexhaustive survey of Nanjing temples conducted in 1611 found fourteenWuxian temples within the city, second only to Guanyin and far morethan those dedicated to Zhenwu, Guandi, or Mazu (table 6).The Jiangnan literati apparently resigned themselves to the obduratetenacity of the Wutong cult as well. They continued to cavil at the bizarreand prurient tales of the demonic Wutong propagated in vernacular lit-erature and storytelling, but condoned Wutong’s incarnation as Wuxianas a legitimate object of worship sanctioned by the Ming founder.136Sur-prisingly, though, we find no evidence that the Ming tried to assimilatethe Wutong cult into the officially prescribed pantheon, the usual strat-egy employed by the Song state to channel popular belief in spirits intoacceptable modes of expression. The temple built by Zhu Yuanzhang out-side Nanjing remained on the rolls of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices,but no Wuxian temples were constructed in Beijing after the relocationWutong: From Demon to Deity211"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"of the capital in 1421. State support for the maintenance of the Wuxiantemples in Jiangnan dwindled as well. Wutong in his ubiquitous demonicincarnation remained an outlaw figure, receiving neither official titles norsacrifices. Claims of Wutong’s orthodoxy premised on Zhu Yuanzhang’spatronage notwithstanding, Ming officials typically labeled Wutong, andeven Wuxian, as a popular, local cult without official sanction (turensici).137The erasure of Wuxian from popular worship also resulted from theseparation of Huaguang as a cult figure from the Wuxian. Though nom-inally a Buddhist figure, Huaguang is represented in late Ming sourcesmore as a Daoist demonifuge than as a Buddhist savior. Daoist liturgi-cal and hagiographic works created a new avatar of Huaguang knownas Marshal Ma (Ma Yuanshuai). The two divinities were subsequentlymerged together—and at the same time distanced from the nefariousWutong—in late Ming fiction, drama, and edifying religious tracts. Hua-guang thus became an independent cult figure.A Daoist ritual code of the mid-fourteenth century, The Statutes ofthe Black Code of the Infernal Regions,tried to resolve the ambiguity ofthe Wutong spirits by dividing them into three ranks: the highest-orderWutong spirits were defined as sublime spirits, the refined condensationsof the five elemental forces (qi)that constituted the physical universe; themiddle rank consisted of spirits (including Huaguang) invested withofficial rank by the Jade Emperor; while the lowest sort, “stale breathsof weeds and trees,” wrought havoc among mortals.138This text thusappropriated the figure of Huaguang and integrated it into the Daoistcelestial pantheon.

Marshal Ma appears in the Thunder Magic exorcism rituals ofSong Daoism as an awesome stellar deity of the southern sky, and thusa crystallization of the element of fire. Marshal Ma, said to have threeeyes (a signal feature of Huaguang in later Ming texts), also possessedfive supernatural powers (wutong)and wielded an array of weapons (agolden lance, a triangular brick, and various fiery weapons, including afire wheel and a gourd filled with five hundred fire crows) to exterminatedemons like the shanxiaoand Wutong (figures 28, 29, and 30).139In ef-fect, Marshal Ma is presented as a Daoist transfiguration of the noxiousWutong demons into a righteous warrior in the service of the celestialgods, and in this respect Marshal Ma essentially replicated the BuddhistHuaguang.140The merging of the Buddhist bodhisattva Huaguang with the Daoistdemonifuge Marshal Ma is more fully evidenced in fiction and drama ofthe Ming period. In the late Ming novella Journey to the North,Hua-guang initially appears as a dissolute and irascible ruffian who flouts thedictates of the supreme gods of the Daoist pantheon until vanquished byZhenwu. Huaguang hints at his origins in the diabolical Wutong cult byintroducing himself as “Divine Agent Ma of Flowers and Wine” (Hua-jiu Ma lingguan), an allusion to his fondness for women and debauch-ery.

After his defeat, Huaguangperforms penance by serving as a lieutenant of the True Warrior in cru-sades against satanic forces. In the final chapter Huaguang is investedwith the title “Sole and Orthodox Divine Agent Marshal Ma” (Zhengyilingguan Ma yuanshuai).141The two figures are portrayed as alter egosin other popular literature of the Ming as well.142Although Journey tothe Northhas been criticized for its supposedly vulgar rendition of Daoistdoctrines, its portrayal of Huaguang as both scourge and savior deftlycaptures the ambiguous relationship between Huaguang/Wuxian and theforces of order found in the canonical literature.143In a zajudrama version of “Journey to the West,” dating probablyfrom the early sixteenth century, “Heavenly King Huaguang” (Huaguangtianwang) appears as a guardian deity sent by the Jade Emperor to as-sist the Tang monk Xuanzang on his journey to India to obtain the gen-uine Buddhist scriptures. In an aria Huaguang introduces himself as adivinity of both the Buddhist and Daoist pantheons, a fire-wielding de-mon queller assigned to the southern regions.

At the same time thegod’s roots in the Wutong cult are equally apparent, as can be seen inhis incarnation as one of five sons of a Wuyuan village headman. Thereis even an allusion to the signal physical trait of the ancient Wutong: atthe end of the novella Huaguang is tricked into chopping off one of hislegs. The mythology of Huaguang that appears in Journey to the Southis also alluded to in the one-hundred-chapter version of Journey to theWest.At the very end of the novel, the monk Xuanzang and his fellowpilgrims pass by a “branch temple of Huaguang.” The author explainsthat “the bodhisattva Huaguang was a disciple of the Flaming Five LightsBuddha. Because of his campaign of extermination against the DemonKing of Poisonous Fire he was demoted in official rank and transformedinto the divine agent Wuxian.”147This parenthetical observation is un-mistakably derived from Journey to the South or its antecedents, whichidentifies Huaguang in exactly the same terms.The association between Huaguang and Marshal Ma is further un-derscored in a popular religious handbook dating from the end of thesixteenth century bearing the title Great Compendium of Unseen Spir-its and the Traces of Their Origins in the Three Teachings.148In this text,Wusheng (i.e., Wuxian) and Marshal Ma are given separate entries. Yetthe hagiography of Marshal Ma identifies him as a “avatar” (huashen;nirmàJakàya)of the Supreme Miaojixiang Tathàgata (Zhi MiaojixiangRulai), who at the outset is punished for an act of desecration by beingborn into human form (figure 33). The remainder of the entry briefly re-capitulates the plot of Journey to the South;the two texts clearly derivefrom the same source. This spare account concludes by stating that Mar-shal Ma, like Huaguang in Journey to the North,was rewarded for hismeritorious actions with an appointment as a lieutenant of Zhenwu(though in this case stationed in the western regions, not the south).The amalgam of Wuxian and Huaguang that appears in Journey tothe Southwas also disseminated through theatrical performance.

The existence of cults centered on the merged Huaguang/Wuxian deity can be glimpsed through both literary and historicalsources. The two gods became indistinguishable in the cult at theHuaguang Temple in the Baoshansi Monastery in Hangzhou, the settingfor a Feng Menglong tale, “Imposter Spirits Wreak Havoc at the Hua-guang Temple.” In this story the divine agent Wuxian is summoned toexpose and expel a pair of demons, posing as the Daoist transcendentsLü Dongbin and He Xiangu, who used the lure of examination successto inveigle a young student into wanton sexual (including homosexual)liaisons. The narrator of the story took pains to emphasize that the pop-ular identification of Wuxian with Wutong was plainly false (but madeno mention of the similarity between Wutong’s proclivities and those ofthe impostor spirits).151The claim that Wuxian/Huaguang is wronglyaccused of wanton behavior, especially sexual predation, is also an im-portant theme of Journey to the South.In both works the god is even-tually exonerated of the kind of crime typically blamed on demons likethe Wutong spirits. Indeed, works like Journey to the Southcan be readas apologia intended to dispel the “mistaken” association betweenHuaguang and the demonic Wutong, and in so doing recuperate Hua-guang as a force for good. Interestingly, though Huaguang clearly wasa Buddhist figure in the Song period, Daoist elements predominate in de-pictions of the deity in late Ming literature. When the Huaguang of Jour-ney to the Southreprises Mulian’s rescue of his mother from the under-world, he does so by assuming the form of the Daoist divinity Taiyi jiukutianzun. The contests between demonic adversaries that constitute themain content of Journey to the Southcan also be seen as literary elabo-rations of Daoist liturgies in which ritual experts summon the god to van-quish demonic entities, including the shanxiao.152Literary sources also provide evidence that Huaguang endured as anindependent cult figure in late Ming times. The author of Journey to theSouthnotes in closing that Huaguang was worshiped by people seekingchildren, merchants (who expect that divine aid will earn them a tenfoldreturn on their capital), and students aspiring to examination success.153Similarly, the Marshal Ma entry in Traces of Origins in the Three Teach-Wutong: From Demon to Deity219"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"ingsstates that Marshal Ma responds to appeals for wealth, “emolument”(lu;in this case, probably referring to longevity), wives, and sons; but hecan also be invoked by spirit mediums seeking the god’s aid in rightinginjustices or answering their clients’ prayers.154Works like Journey tothe Southserved to popularize knowledge of the deity’s powers and toadvertise the efficacy of appealing to the god for aid.Efforts on the part of ritual practitioners to distinguish the righteousHuaguang/Wuxian from the original Wutong cult do not seem to havebeen wholly effective, however. Journey to the Southrefers to Huaguangas the “Bodhisattva Miaojixiang” (Miaojixiang pusa), once again in-voking a name employed in the “Journey to the West” zajudrama andTraces of Origins in the Three Teachingsto distinguish Huaguang fromthe Wutong cult. But some records concerning Wutong temples specifi-cally identify their resident deities by the name Miaojixiang Huaguang.Sixteenth- and seventeenth-century gazetteers from Tingzhou reportthat local legends identified Wutong as “an avatar of the Flower LightTreasure King Bodhisattva Miaojixiang” (Huaguang zangwang miao-jixiang pusa) and note that Huaguang, like Mulian, was revered for hisheroic rescue of his mother from the underworld. Here the Wuxian weredepicted as a group of five gods separate from Huaguang.155Clearly lo-cal votaries of Huaguang/Wuxian were aware of the Huaguang story asnarrated in Journey to the South,although some continued to worshipthe god under the name Wutong. We also find a reference to the inclu-sion of icons of Huaguang in tea séances dedicated to Wutong in a lateMing gazetteer of Hangzhou that likewise refers to Huaguang as Miao-jixiang.156However much Daoist ritual experts sought to sever Huaguangfrom Wutong, the two remained linked in the popular imagination.The early history of the Wutong cult thus vividly demonstrates the com-plexity of the interplay between popular cults, state-sanctioned religiousactivities, and the Daoist scriptural tradition. Far from being merely adebased relic of classical religion, vernacular religious culture activelyinfluenced the construction of official and ecclesiastic canons. Of course,the Wutong/Wuxian cults did have their champions. The local commu-nities in Jiangdong that competed for imperial endorsement of “their”patron Wuxian deity understandably chose to present the god as benefi-cent. Merchants probably had some hand in the spread of the cultthroughout Jiangnan, though there is no evidence to confirm that mer-chants as a group patronized the cult in any distinctive way.157Aboveall, the induction of Wutong into the official pantheon resulted from thepervasiveness of popular faith in the god’s powers, a faith in no way220Wutong: From Demon to Deity"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"diminished—and perhaps strengthened—by Wutong’s demonic procliv-ities. The transformation of Wutong in Daoist literature from odious fiendto loyal servant of the supreme Daoist deities reflected, and probably re-sulted from, the god’s elevation within the hierarchy of official cults. Yetboth imperial and doctrinal sanction indirectly acknowledged the pre-eminence of popular belief. We would be mistaken to interpret the pop-ular conception of Wutong as a vulgarization of a sublime theology. Onthe contrary, the orthodox Wuxian represented a truncated caricature ofa multivalent popular deity.Wutong: From Demon to Deity221"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"chapter 7The Enchantment of WealthMoney has an ancient history in China, but perhaps at no time did moneyhave greater symbolic import than in the late Ming period, when domesticeconomic growth and the infusion of foreign silver engendered a rapidexpansion in its use. The irruption of money in manifold forms into thedaily lives of virtually every household in Jiangnan, the most commer-cialized region in China, resulted not only in a new set of exchange re-lationships, but also in an elaboration of the ways in which money wasconceived as a symbol of the profound changes wrought by the moneyeconomy. To many, the proliferation of money unleashed the hordes ofMammon and ruptured the delicate bonds of reciprocity binding a sol-idary moral economy. “Gold’s decrees rule heaven, while the godMoney looms over the earth,” proclaimed a gazetteer of Huizhou, whosemerchants and moneylenders epitomized the irresistable power ofwealth.1Even champions of Confucian ethics seeking to shore up con-ventional moral standards succumbed to the compelling metaphoricalqualities of money. Authors of practical handbooks for moral guidanceadopted accounting systems that enabled readers to calculate the sumof their moral behavior and to augment merit-earning actions to ensurea positive balance.2New forms of religious piety invoked the language ofthe marketplace—“accumulation,” “savings,” “debt,” “management”—to illustrate moral teachings centered on accruing and preserving “moral”capital.3The popular imagination also invested money with cultural meaning.Most conspicuous among the symbolic representations of money in lateMing Jiangnan was the “god of wealth” (caishen). In modern times thegod of wealth has been a ubiquitous feature of domestic ritual life anda fixture of the New Year’s celebrations. The modern cult of the god ofwealth actually encompasses a number of distinct supernatural figures,each representing different facets of wealth: He He Erxian, the twin geniiof concord, symbolize the resolution of conflicts among business part-ners essential to commercial success; the cherubic Liu Hai represents222"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"abundance and generosity; the powerful warrior god Guandi personifiesthe qualities of loyalty and trust upon which business transactions de-pend.4Despite the pervasive presence of these figures in family altars andpublic temples, though, the roots of the god-of-wealth cult in popularreligious life have remained hidden. In Jiangnan, since the eighteenth cen-tury the cult of the god of wealth has focused on a group of five deitiesknown as the Gods of the Five Paths to Wealth (Wulu caishen). Thesedeities comprise the chief officials of the Ministry of Wealth, a branch ofthe vast celestial bureaucracy presided over by Daoist divinities. The Wulucaishen are not ancient gods; rather, they are derived, in greatly alteredform, from the cult of Wutong.It was in the late Ming period that Wutong as a god governing thedispensation of wealth emerged as the dominant cult figure in Jiangnan.The notion of a god of wealth was by no means entirely new. The Im-mortal Official of Profitable Markets (Lishi xianguan), a minor figure inDaoist liturgies, dated back at least to the Song period, and early Mingiconography portrayed generic gods of wealth in forms closely corre-sponding to their modern representations.5It was the image of Wutong,however, that dominated the popular imagination in late Ming Jiang-nan. The most remarkable feature of the Wutong cult was its diabolicalcharacter. Wutong was perceived not as a culture hero or reification ofnoble human qualities, but rather as an embodiment of humanity’s basestvices, greed and lust. As an actively maleficent demon that preyed on theweak and vulnerable, Wutong was very much the antithesis of the mod-ern gods of wealth.Over the course of the Ming dynasty, the Wutong cult in Jiangnan un-derwent considerable evolution. Wutong infiltrated all levels of religiousworship, in both domestic worship and public cults. Despite the South-ern Song–Yuan rehabilitation of the demonic Wutong in the forms of thepositive images of Wuxian and Huaguang, though, the Wutong cult inlate Ming Jiangnan retained distinctively demonic forms. Confusionabout the god’s “true” identity perplexed the guardians of public moral-ity, as Wang Zhijian’s (1576–1633) essay entitled “An Exegesis of theWutong Kings” reveals:Previous [Suzhou] gazetteers separated Wutong and Wuxian and regardedthem as two distinct deities. But in customary usage in Wu [Suzhou], thetwo names are frequently used interchangeably. Although investigationshows that Wuxian is a local god of Wuyuan, Our Eminent Founding Em-peror [Zhu Yuanzhang] established a temple dedicated to Wuxian at thesouthern capital [Nanjing]. There can be no doubt that Wuxian is a properThe Enchantment of Wealth223"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"deity. The wicked and uncanny events and the specious and exaggeratedstories recorded in works of fiction and propagated by vulgar custom some-times identify the god by the name Wusheng, or in other cases as Wulang,and in yet other instances the god is worshiped by a different title. Thetruth cannot be discerned. It is also said that the god has brothers sur-named Xiao and a mother called Grand Dowager [Taimu], but such absurd babble spread by vulgar custom is utterly unreliable.6It is true that the names of the god were often used interchangeably. Yetthe particular names applied to Wutong also reveal distinctive localidentities.The imperial title of Wuxian, despite the sanction it enjoyed thanksto its recognition by Zhu Yuanzhang, occurs infrequently in late Mingrecords, and chiefly as the name of long-established temples. Within Jiang-nan, the name Wuxian was most prevalent in the Hangzhou region, arelic of Hangzhou’s preeminence as a cult center during the thirteenthcentury. As noted earlier, in Ming times Jiangnan people commonly re-ferred to Wutong by the name Wusheng, a usage that also traces back toSouthern Song Hangzhou. In the Ming period the name Wusheng wasespecially common in the silk-producing region around Hangzhou, en-compassing in addition to Hangzhou prefecture the adjoining prefecturesof Jiaxing and Huzhou, a subregion known as Hang-Jia-Hu. The namesWutong and Wulang were more common in the rice- and cotton-farm-ing regions just to the north, in the prefectures of Suzhou and Songjiang.Inhabitants of Suzhou-Songjiang were also noted for their devotion to aplague god, Wufang xiansheng (Worthy Saints of the Five Directions),which became closely associated with the Wutong cult.The thirteenth and fourteenth centuries witnessed the consolidationof local tutelary cults in Jiangnan into forms that endured down to mod-ern times. Most of the tutelary deities of Jiangnan were first granted recog-nition during the Yuan dynasty, which issued patents to local cults thatawarded them the title “commandant” (zongguan). “Zongguan”was acommon title during the Yuan, applied to those holding a wide varietyof appointments, but it was especially important as a designation for lo-cal prefects. The Yuan state expanded on the Song practice of conferringhonorary noble titles on local tutelary deities by also assigning them aspecific jurisdiction as “commandant” of their native region. In subse-quent dynasties inhabitants of the region used the title zongguanas ageneric designation for tutelary deities, who were invariably identifiedwith local historical figures.7Among the most prominent zongguancultsof Jiangnan was that of Commandant Jin (Jin Zongguan), which appears224The Enchantment of Wealth"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"to have originated as a cult dedicated to members of a prominent fam-ily surnamed Jin from the market town of Zhouzhuang, in Kunshancounty of Suzhou prefecture.8Two members of the family, Jin Yuanqiand Jin Chang, were said to have received the title of “commandant”from the Yuan imperial government for their service in protecting thetribute fleets making the ocean voyage from the delta to the capital atBeijing. After their deaths local inhabitants worshiped “CommandantJin” (either separately or together) as tutelary spirits. By the seventeenthcentury Commandant Jin had become the most common deity in localterritorial cults throughout Jiangnan.9Another deity whose cult became widely diffused in Ming-Qing Jiang-nan was Fierce General Liu (Liu Mengjiang). This cult dates back per-haps to the late Song, but layers of later myth have rendered its originalform wholly opaque.10The “canonical” version of the god’s history,ratified through award of an imperial patent in 1724, identified Liu as aYuan martyr who committed suicide when the Yuan was overthrown byZhu Yuanzhang. The Qing honored Liu as a tutelary deity who protectedthe region from the scourge of locusts, though this feature of the cultitself—not mentioned in any pre-Qing sources—appears to have been arecent invention. The cult first appeared in the northern counties ofSuzhou prefecture, but official recognition by the Qing court acceleratedits diffusion throughout the Yangzi River delta. In rural areas Fierce Gen-eral Liu was closely linked to the agricultural cycle. Villagers held festi-vals in honor of the god both in the spring (either during the New Yearseason or at Qingming, the third day of the third month) and in the fall,after the gathering of the rice harvest in the eighth month. The autumnharvest festivals (locally known as qingmiaoshe) featured processions dur-ing which images of the Fierce General were paraded through theprecincts of the temple’s territory.Since relatively few Jiangnan villages had their own temples, smallshrines were erected in villages, along roads, and in the fields where lo-cal people could readily present modest offerings or recite prayers to thesetutelary gods. Although Wutong, unlike Commandant Jin or Fierce Gen-eral Liu, did not become a focal deity of territorial cults, small shrinesdedicated to Wutong were ubiquitous throughout the region. QianXiyan observed that “among the people of Suzhou and Hangzhou it is com-mon practice to erect a small shrine, no more capacious than a doumea-sure [approximately two liters], beneath large trees. The Wulang spirits—including the mother, her several sons, and their wives—are painted ona square board. Incense and candles are laid out, and from time to timeThe Enchantment of Wealth225"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"offerings are presented without fail. These deities are known as ‘Wusheng-Beneath-the-Trees’ [Shutou Wusheng].”11Wusheng was also worshipedat domestic altars within the home.12In these respects the Wutong/Wusheng gods were an even more immediate presence in quotidian lifethan the local tutelary gods.The Wusheng cult was equally pervasive in the Hang-Jia-Hu sericul-ture region, whose fortunes were closely tied to the violent oscillationsof the commercial economy. The principal annual festival in the silk tradecenter of Tangxizhen, in Hangzhou prefecture, was the Wuxian festivalheld at Qingming, which marked the advent of the silk production sea-son. This festival had already attained prominence in the sixteenth cen-tury, when Lü Xu (1514–93), a local poet of some distinction, composeda verse mentioning its connection to the fortunes of the silk industry.13Local historians in Huzhou recorded that every village possessed Wushengshrines (tangzi), which were simple makeshift structures, approximatelyone meter high, that were placed at the entrance to the village and houseda statue or painted image of the god.14Peasants hung images of Wushengin many places—in the home, in the still, and in the pens where cattle,pigs, and chickens were kept—to ward off ghosts and demons.15Suchpractices were common in Suzhou and Songjiang, too.16In Jiangnan thename Wusheng itself (like the Buddhist term pusaor “bodhisattva”) cameto mean “deity” in a generic sense, and numerous gods had “Wusheng”incorporated into their names. One prominent example was a sericul-ture deity known as Canhua Wusheng.17The ancient association between Wutong/Wuxian and deliverancefrom pestilence also endured in Jiangnan, most conspicuously in the formof a deity known as Wufang xiansheng. The exact relationship betweenWufang xiansheng and Wutong remains unclear, although the two wereclosely associated in the eyes of early Qing officials who tried to stampout both cults. The Wufang xiansheng cult cannot be traced back earlierthan the second quarter of the sixteenth century. Gazetteers for the townof Luzhizhen in Suzhou prefecture report that early in the reign of theJiajing emperor (1522–66) the townspeople founded the Five PlaguesTemple (Wuwenmiao) devoted to Wufang xiansheng.18As we saw inchapter 4, by Song times the most common designation for plague godswas “Five Emissaries of Plague.” Wufang xiansheng seems to have beena local variation on this generic title. A Five Transcendents Temple (Wuxian-miao) in nearby Changshu was explicitly identified with the Five Emis-saries of Plague; here, “Five Transcendents” was apparently used as short-226The Enchantment of Wealth"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"hand for “Worthy Saints of the Five Directions,” and thus this templetoo was part of the Wufang xiansheng cult.19A brief essay by the Suzhou scholar Wang Zhideng (1539–1612) de-tails the extravagant festivals held in honor of Wufang xiansheng inSuzhou at the turn of the seventeenth century.20Wang was unable to iden-tify Wufang xiansheng with any certainty, but he noted that popular be-lief held that the god governed sickness and disease. Consequently, fes-tivals dedicated to Wufang xiansheng, like other rituals intended to purgeplague demons, were held in the fifth month. Wang also observed thatduring times of drought and other calamities the local people staged fes-tivals for gods like King Guan (Guandi), Guanyin, and Fierce GeneralLiu, but in his day Suzhou’s Wufang xiansheng festival surpassed all oth-ers. In Luzhizhen, too, the Wufang xiansheng feast on 5/18 was one ofthe town’s four principal annual religious festivals.21Yet Wang Zhidengmakes no reference to Wutong in connection with Wufang xiansheng.The most suggestive evidence for a tie between the two is found in a con-temporary collection of folklore, in which we read that “by local cus-tom many people in the Nanjing area fear a one-footed shanxiaodemonknown as ‘Wutong xiansheng.’”22Despite the similarity between thenames Wutong xiansheng and Wufang xiansheng, though, this Wutongxiansheng spirit is depicted as the familiar incubus of Wutong lore ratherthan a plague demon.The Wufang xiansheng seem to be a local variation of the Great Spir-its of the Five Paths (Wulu dashen), who figure in Daoist exorcism ritu-als as demonifuge warrior spirits summoned by priests to dispel plague.These Spirits of the Five Paths are none other than the Five Emissariesof Plague, and are identified as such in the fourteenth-century ritual com-pendium Daofa huiyuan.23In their capacity as plague quellers the GreatSpirits of the Five Paths play a central role in the boat exorcisms thatwere the centerpieces of festivals dedicated to plague deities like Mar-shal Wen and the Five Emperors.24In Daoist ritual, and especially in ver-nacular accounts of Daoist ritual, these spirits are referred to as the FiveFierce Demons (Wuchanggui).25The Five Fierce Demons, possessing thesame Janus-faced character as the Five Emissaries of Plague, were castin the roles of both evil demons and demon-quelling warriors. For ex-ample, the Five Fierce Demons were invoked in the course of thepurification rituals enacted as part of “tranquility operas” (ping’an xi),dramas typically on the theme of Mulian’s rescue of his mother from hellthat were staged at the temples of local tutelary gods during the balefulThe Enchantment of Wealth227"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"fifth month.26Actors costumed as demons cavorted about the stage, ter-rifying the audience, until driven off by the god. In his account of thelurid spectacles staged in these Mulian operas, Zhang Dai (1597–ca.1684) commented that audiences were especially terrified of a suiteknown as “Summoning the Evil Ghosts of the Five Directions” (ZhaoWufang egui).27In both of these cases the Five Fierce Demons appearedas evil spirits requiring exorcism. But in other ritual operas the Five FierceDemons themselves perform the roles of demon slayers. The Wulu spir-its shared this ambivalent nature, too, as the following passage in agazetteer of Jiading county reveals:In the jiaziyear of the Kangxi reign [1684], rumors of an epidemic inflictedby the Wulu spirits suddenly abounded. Whenever anyone walked along a road they might hear someone calling their name from behind. If you re-sponded, you were immediately stricken with incurable illness. It was saidthat if you carried with you a bronze coin of the Kangxi era bearing thelegend “fortune” [fu]you would be spared.28Experience demonstratedthat these talismans were effective, and people placed great trust in them.Coins with the “fortune” legend thus became very valuable for a time, untilthe epidemic passed.29On balance, then, it seems likely that Wufang xiansheng derived fromthe venerable folklore that entwined the Five Emissaries of Plague andtheir alter egos, the Spirits of the Five Paths and the Five Fierce Gods. Aswe shall see, the Spirits of the Five Paths merged with Wutong as a god ofwealth during the seventeenth century, and in the Qing period the cultof the Wufang xiansheng became closely identified with the demonic formof Wutong.Song and Ming folklore, as we have seen, reveals a strong connectionbetween Wutong and wealth: the deity bestowed riches on mortals butin turn demanded a heavy price, nothing less than the sexual conquestof women. Fathers and husbands are shown as willing to accept this bar-gain. In the second half of the sixteenth century Wutong began to emergemore specifically as a god of wealth. Yet the character of the deity changedlittle. Far from becoming an industrious husbandman or frugal businessmanager, Wutong retained his sinister bent.The earliest explicit statement of Wutong’s power to “convey” (yun,which I interpret to mean both give and take away) wealth appeared inthe mid-sixteenth century and was later incorporated into the definitivedescription of Wusheng published in a 1609 gazetteer of Hangzhou:“Hangzhou folk place the utmost faith in Wusheng. The origins and par-ticulars of the cult cannot be traced, but...it is said that the deity is ca-228The Enchantment of Wealth"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"pable of conveying wealth, defiling women, and visiting both fortune andmisfortune upon mortals.”30Around this same time worship of Wutongas a god of wealth was incorporated into the schedule of New Year’s rit-uals. According to a Changzhou gazetteer of 1598, the city’s inhabitantsoffered lavish sacrifices to Wutong at the close of the year, a time for set-tling accounts and winning the favor of those deities charged with re-porting on the family’s behavior over the past year.31Since at least Songtimes the townsfolk of Jiangnan had offered sacrifices and prayers to spir-its at New Year’s in hopes of conjuring a “profitable market” (lishi).32By the late seventeenth century, peasants and city dwellers alike dedi-cated such sacrifices (known as shao lishi) specifically to Wutong.33Inthe argot of the late Ming, the phrase shaoge lishi,which denoted burn-ing spirit money as an act of propitiation, acquired the meaning “mak-ing a killing,” in the sense of a windfall profit.34In this context worshipof Wutong implied not simply a desire for general prosperity, but rathera desire to strike it rich.Around this same time, too, the God of the Five Paths to Wealth (Wulucaishen) emerged as a surrogate of Wutong. The first reference to wor-ship of Wulu caishen on the fifth day of the New Year appears in an earlyseventeenth-century gazetteer from Changshu.35Another contemporarysource states that “on the fifth day of the first month it is the custom inSuzhou for every family and every household to hold a ceremony andmake offerings to the Great Spirits of the Five Paths [Wulu dashen]; thispractice is called shao lishi.Only after eating a ‘profitable market’ meal[lishi fan]do people leave their homes and begin to conduct business.”36Henceforth the practice of worshiping Wulu caishen on the fifth day ofthe first month, when shops reopened after the New Year’s holiday, spreadthroughout Jiangnan. The Changzhou prefectural gazetteer of 1694specifically states that Wulu caishen was worshiped at New Year’s in or-der to invoke the god’s aid in gaining wealth.37In Hangzhou, Wutongwas worshiped outright as a god of wealth without the mask of the Godof the Five Paths. Hangzhou shopkeepers offered sacrifices to Wutongnot just at New Year’s, but on the fifth day of every month.38Pilgrim-ages to major Wutong shrines peaked at New Year’s, when shrines werebesieged by those of all classes of society, from members of the wealth-iest households to itinerant peddlers, seeking the god’s aid in resolvingthe weighty problems of business and marriage.39The cult of Wutong as a god of wealth coalesced around a new cen-tral shrine, one conveniently located on the outskirts of Suzhou, at MountLengqie, ten kilometers southwest of the city. Mount Lengqie is a ridgeThe Enchantment of Wealth229"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"running along the western flank of Stone Lake (Shihu), a scenic spot longfavored by men of culture and leisure such as Fan Chengda (1120–93),the renowned Song poet who took “Stone Lake” as his literary sobri-quet. Mount Lengqie was named after a Buddhist monastery built at thissite in the early seventh century. The Lengqiesi Monastery was one of anumber of Buddhist shrines raised on this ridge, but the striking profileof its seven-story pagoda at the crest of the mountain attracted particu-lar attention (figure 34). Rebuilt in the late tenth century and substan-tially renovated in the 1630s, the pagoda still stands today.40A Wutongtemple was founded within the monastery’s precincts in the final yearsof the Song dynasty, but this temple does not seem to have attracted spe-cial attention before the late Ming, when it suddenly emerged as one ofthe region’s principal pilgrimage centers.By late Ming times, Mount Lengqie had become better known amongSuzhou folk as Mount Shangfang, a name that became inextricably linkedwith its Wutong shrine. A native of the town of Hengtang, a few kilo-meters to the north of Mount Shangfang, within sight of the pagoda, lefta brief description of the temple as it existed in late Ming times: “En-tering the monastery’s ‘mountain gate’ [i.e., the main gate], there are twomain halls, one above the other on the slope of the hill. The hall in frontis dedicated to Guanyin, that in the rear to Wutong. Along both wingsof the temple are located subsidiary shrines and altars. During festivalseasons the god’s votaries ceaselessly make offerings and perform pro-cessions.”41Qian Xiyan confirmed that at Mount Shangfang’s Wutongtemple “music of pipes and strings fills the air; wine and blood of meatdrench the ground. Each year countless numbers of animals are slaugh-tered for sacrificial offerings to the god.”42Donations from worshipersenabled the resident monks to undertake renovation of the pagoda in 1636. The dedication for the rebuilt pagoda professes ignorance ofwhen the monastery became associated with “Wuxian,” but boasts thatfrom the hilltop one could see an unbroken chain of worshipers ap-proaching the temple from as far away as Hengtang. The pagoda itselfbecame a focal object of worship, referred to as the “Wuxian peniten-tial service pagoda” (Wuxian chanye ta).43Other sources confirm thatpilgrims ascending Mount Shangfang mounted great processions, com-plete with painted floats and music of flutes and drums, that filled theroadways and flowed, day and night, in endless streams.44Thanks to Wutong’s reputation as a god of wealth, Mount Shangfangand Stone Lake acquired the sobriquet “Mountain of Meat, Sea ofWine.”45Especially prominent among the worshipers who flocked to230The Enchantment of Wealth"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"Figure 34.

Money borrowedfrom Wutong, once employed in trade, was reputed to return a multi-fold profit. In addition, whenever merchants borrowed or lent moneythey felt compelled to present offerings to Wutong to guarantee that thedebt would be paid in full. Qian Xiyan described the process by whichwealth circulated between Wutong and his votaries:At the beginning of each year shopkeepers and merchants in Suzhou drawup a contract to seek a loan from Wutong. First they purchase a large quan-tity of spirit money, which they present to the god at this temple. Then theybring the spirit money back to their home and suspend it over their domes-tic altar. Throughout the year they are exceedingly circumspect in makingofferings. At the end of the year they take the spirit money—adding some“interest” to the original amount—to Mount Lengqie, where it is burned to “redeem the debt” [nazhai].46According to more recent testimony concerning “borrowing a covertloan” (jie yinzhai)from Wutong, female mediums acted as intermedi-aries in this transaction. Supplicants presented offerings of incense andcandles, “tribute of coin and grain” (sheaves of spirit money bound to-gether with straw), and a variety of forms of spirit money representinggold, silver, paper money, and bronze coins. The medium, who had en-tered a trance and was possessed by the Wutong spirit, recited the termsof the loan, which the borrower would acknowledge. Then the borrowertook four paper yuanbaoingots from the altar, and upon returning homeplaced them on the family’s domestic altar.47If after several days the pa-per ingots retained their original shape, the god was said to have approvedthe loan; if the paper had shriveled, then the request was denied. Subse-quently offerings were made as part of domestic worship on days afterthe full and new moons, and after the passage of a year the borrowerwould return to the Mount Shangfang temple to “settle accounts” bymaking offerings that included “interest” owed on the loan.48Belief in karmic debt, and specifically debts that must be requitedthrough a type of monetary exchange (spirit money), had been wide-spread at least since Song times. Hou Ching-lang has shown that one ofthe most prevalent functions of offerings of spirit money was to replen-ish one’s personal account in the celestial treasury by repaying loans ofgood fortune, or for life (more precisely, a specified life span) itself. Ac-cording to a Daoist scripture dating probably from the thirteenth cen-tury, each person at birth receives an “emolument” (lu)from the celes-232The Enchantment of Wealth"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"tial treasury consisting of a physical body and a “covert loan” (yinzhai)that determines the degree of wealth the individual will attain in that life-time.49Enjoyment of prosperity threatened to deplete one’s “emolument,”however, and necessitated “replenishing one’s fate” (buyun)through de-posits of spirit money. Ritual action thus enabled one to redeem the debtof life and secure one’s fortune.Ming vernacular literature, deeply tinged by ideas of moral equilib-rium, frequently underscored the futility of material gain by offeringdidactic lessons illustrating the impossibility of securing riches in perpe-tuity. Augmentation of fortune at one point in time inevitably entailed acorresponding diminution in the future. Those who accumulated moneyand goods were commonly denied male offspring, a telling testament ofthe essential fungibility of different forms of “wealth,” including fecun-dity and longevity as well as material possessions. Excessive profit, es-pecially from commerce, augured future ruin, often in the form of wastrelsons who dissipated their father’s hard-earned gains. All debts are even-tually repaid according to precise rules of exchange. The injustice suf-fered by an innocent is eventually recompensed, if not in this lifetime,then by future generations. Only through renunciation of material wealthcan one secure less tangible—but ultimately more valuable—fortune inthe form of male heirs to carry on the family line.50Yet this Buddhist ethic of renunciation proved too extreme. The Con-fucian elite of the late Ming largely repudiated religious action (whetherBuddhist asceticism or Daoist rituals) to improve one’s stock of fortunein favor of a positivist ethic of determining one’s own fate (liming)through moral action. The so-called “morality books” (shanshu)of thelate Ming, especially the “ledgers of merits and sins” (gongguoge), ad-vocated judicious investment in good actions as the reliable means of en-suring personal and family welfare. Accumulation of merit through vir-tuous action—defined in secular rather than religious terms—engenderedtangible rewards, measured not in terms of mere lucre, but in even morevaluable commodities: examination success, an abundance of sons, andmore diffused benefits enjoyed by society as a whole.51Such ideas in-spired increased interest in philanthropy among Confucian patricians ofthe late Ming.52These men likewise embraced a social ethic of temper-ance, a life purged of the four evils of drink, lust, greed, and wrath yetpremised on moderation and restraint rather than self-denial.53This ethic,sheathing its utilitarian goals with moral armor, endorsed the accumu-lation and conservation of wealth. Above all, the “tempered self” whoembodied this ethic gained mastery of his own destiny and no longer hadThe Enchantment of Wealth233"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"to resign himself to the inexorable workings of a supernatural system ofretribution.Ideas of wealth and fortune were intimately bound up with beliefs con-cerning life and destiny on the popular level, too. Yet the conception ofdestiny expressed in transactions whereby votaries “borrowed a covertloan” from Wutong conformed neither to the Buddhist notion of moralequilibrium nor the Confucian reaffirmation of positive moral action.Indeed, the moral character of the supplicant is never examined. Wutong’sblessings were evoked through punctilious performance of sacrifice andabject surrender to the god’s will, not moral practice and self-discipline.Once beholden to the god’s benefaction, however, the supplicant becomesensnared in a web of thickening obligations and subject to the whims ofa capricious deity. We have here, I would suggest, a notion of debt thatis fundamentally incompatible with the capitalist ethic of ever-increasingaggrandizement. As the Daoist concept of “replenishing one’s fate” sug-gests, each person lived in a state of perpetual indebtedness. Good for-tune did not conjure visions of a prosperous future; rather, it kindled fearsthat one’s allotment of life, wealth, and fortune might soon be exhaustedand therefore needed to be renewed through recourse to a powerful su-pernatural patron. This type of exchange with the yinrealm of the di-vine, cogently exemplified by the solicitation of a “covert loan” from anamoral deity like Wutong, was not a capitalist transaction.54Instead,monetary exchange with the gods illustrated the powerlessness and vul-nerability felt by those caught in the throes of the money economy.Wutong’s transformation into the preeminent god of wealth in Jiang-nan did not diminish his diabolical character. On the contrary, the motifof exchanging women for wealth remained central to the popular con-struction of the cult. Witness the Wutong depicted in a mid-seventeenth-century anecdote recorded by a native of the town of Shaxizhen, an im-portant center of the cotton trade in Suzhou’s Changshu county:The Wutong deities. . . were five brothers who controlled good and evilfortune, and also roamed the world and played sport with mortals. Thegods selected boys and girls to whom they took a fancy and had illicit sex-ual relations with them. Those who submitted to their will were rewardedwith gold and silver; whatever they desired and prayed for would instantlyappear. In many instances the youths’ families suddenly became fabulouslywealthy.Now in our town there was a certain gentleman from an eminentlineage who had four or five wives and concubines. His daughter, uponreaching the age of sexual awakening, was suddenly visited by a spirit whoinveigled her with tenderness and soothing words. This spirit, who was of234The Enchantment of Wealth"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"handsome and youthful mien, attired in embroidered gowns, and clever oftongue, was none other than Wutong. Each time he visited he rode in a car-riage accompanied by servants on horseback, as resplendent as any prince,yet no one else could see him. The daughter thus secretly took him into herbed. Although she laughed and talked as before, gradually her spirit subtlymerged with the shades. From time to time she accompanied the spirit tohis home, a paradise within the Grotto Heavens, entirely apart from themortal world. . . . This went on for several months. The woman’s father had a concubineof unblemished beauty who was also visited by a spirit pretending to be thecity god of the district. This impostor spirit seized the concubine and wouldnot allow her to have carnal relations with the old gentleman. Whenever thelatter came to the concubine’s boudoir the spirit would fling the woman tothe floor and cause her to writhe in agony. The old gentleman, unable tocope with the situation himself, summoned a talented wizard steeped in thelore of charms and talismans to mount an altar and perform rites to expelthe spirit. The spirit, speaking through a medium, hurled imprecations atthe exorcist. The Wutong spirit was summoned to act as a mediator, andultimately fashioned a compromise whereby the impostor spirit and the oldgentleman would spend alternate nights with the much-prized concubine.Prior to all this the young daughter, having already reached the age ofwearing hairpins, had been promised in marriage. The nuptial arrangementshad been concluded, but when her future spouse’s family caught wind ofthese events they annulled the betrothal and sought another wife for theirson. The old man, a miserly sort, had heard that the Wutong spirit pos-sessed the power to bestow wealth. The spirit promised that within a fort-night the old man would reap a fortune of tens of thousands of taels of silver in exchange for his daughter. The old man immediately consented to select an auspicious time for a wedding and exchanged betrothal gifts,just as if it were a marriage between mortals. In the end, though, the spiritdid not live up to his promise, and the old man lost hope of profiting fromthe match. Hearing of an expert in the arts of talismans and holy water inChangshu, the old man brought him to his home to perform an exorcism.A heavenly host descended to drive off the Wutong spirit, whose apparitioncould be dimly seen—it looked roughly like a tortoise or a hog or thelike—and then it disappeared for good.55Many similar tales circulated in the seventeenth century. One told of aman in Jiaxing who in 1669 bought a house containing a Wutong altarin the library. His daughter, upon reaching the age of marriage, was vis-ited in her bedroom by a stranger who promised to reward her familywith riches in return for her sexual favors, and threatened dire conse-quences if she refused. The stranger came to the young girl’s room everynight; she, however, became thinner and more haggard by the day. Thefamily, suspecting that the Wutong shrine was the source of their daugh-The Enchantment of Wealth235"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"ter’s affliction, sold the house and moved away, but the daughter diedshortly afterward.56Pu Songling included in his renowned Strange Sto-ries from the Studio of Leisure,published in 1679, two Wutong storiesinvolving the daughters of wealthy Suzhou merchants. In both cases thesinister Wutong (identified here as the fourth of the five spirits) forciblyimposes himself on the women, raping one and demanding the other inmarriage in exchange for one hundred taels of silver. Finally the Wutongspirit is driven off by a heroic demon slayer who cuts off one of his legs,leaving the spirit to hobble off encumbered by his trademark handicap.57The connection between acquisition of wealth and possession ofwomen, already present in the Song conception of Wutong, achieved par-ticular prominence in the late Ming period. Propitiation of Wutong in-volved drawing on the dark powers of yinforces, associated with death,disorder, and the dangerous potency of women. The desire for wealth it-self was a disruptive force. Its satisfaction required altering, if not over-turning, the prevailing distribution of wealth, and by extension the nor-mative order. As modern ethnographers have noted, those seeking theaid of gods for self-interested favors usually turn to female deities, whoare perceived as susceptible to personal pleas. In this respect female deitiesembody amoral supernatural powers that can be manipulated for per-sonal ends.58Wutong, more akin to malevolent ghosts and denizens ofthe underworld than the exalted celestial gods, occupied a similar nichein the realm of the supernatural. Women, who as embodiments of yinare at once vulnerable and powerful, served as the bridge to this darkside of the divine. Yet this path to riches was a treacherous one, ruttedwith many pitfalls. The caprice of Wutong, like that of women, threat-ened to consume even the god’s devotees. The popular conception ofwealth thus bore a striking resemblance to the conventional portrait ofwomen as alluring but inconstant, pregnant with destructive power.Though worship of Wutong surely constituted a “profane cult,” ulti-mately the Ming state took no decisive action against it. Neither did theMing imitate the Song practice of co-optation by incorporating local cultsinto the orthodox pantheon. By contrast, the Qing government, once itsattention turned from conquest to ruling, moved swiftly to uproot de-viant religious practices. Despite repeated efforts to eradicate the Wu-tong cult, it persevered in private, domestic devotions, if rarely in pub-lic worship, down to the twentieth century. Nonetheless, as attitudestoward wealth changed, Wutong’s primacy among Jiangnan’s gods ofwealth eroded.In 1685, the newly appointed governor of the Jiangnan region, Tang236The Enchantment of Wealth"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"Bin (1627–87), launched an intensive campaign against the Wutongcult.59Apparently Tang learned about the Wutong cult from a complaintfiled by a local man who believed that his daughter, on the eve of hermarriage, had been possessed and defiled by the god. The distraught fa-ther made repeated offerings to secure her deliverance, but to no avail;the woman died, prompting the father to seek redress from local officials.Tang Bin’s initial target was the cult’s preeminent shrine, the temple atMount Shangfang outside Suzhou. Appalled by the profligate sacrificesoffered by worshipers at Mount Shangfang (variously estimated as cost-ing “more than a hundred silver taels per day” or “enough to impover-ish ten families of middling means”), Tang Bin ordered his deputies toseal the gates to the temple. The faithful, fearing the god’s wrath morethan the governor’s writ, continued to gather outside the temple com-pound, where they milled about and importuned the guards to allow themto enter. Tang himself went to Mount Shangfang to supervise the de-struction of the Wutong icons. First the statues were stripped of theirofficial robes and bound with chains; then each image was punished withforty strokes of a bamboo cane. Finally, wooden statues of the deity wereburned, while clay images were cast into the waters of Stone Lake. Intheir stead Tang placed an image of Guandi, the paragon of deference toauthority.60Tang Bin then began a campaign to uproot deviant religious practicesthroughout the province. He explicitly identified the “gods who go bythe names Wutong, Wuxian, Fierce General Liu, and Wufang xiansheng”as “spurious fakes without any canonical authority” utilized by charla-tan soothsayers to swindle simple-minded folk.61Tang also took the un-usual step of seeking an imperial ordinance banning worship of Wutongso that his successors would be bound by edict to bar any renewal ofpopular devotion.62In the spring of 1686 the court granted Tang’s re-quest. The subsequent national campaign of suppression extended evento the original home of the Wuxian cult in Wuyuan, where the gods’ im-ages were destroyed and the temple was converted into a Guandi shrine.63In his memorial to the emperor Tang specifically singled out the pen-chant of shopkeepers and merchants, some of whom came from distantparts of the empire, for seeking “loans” from the god and beliefs con-cerning the susceptibility of women to demonic possession as the twomost pernicious features of the Wutong cult.64Popular lore attributedsudden grave illness in young women to Wutong’s penchant for seizingthe souls of nubile women; those who suffered from fevers and faintingspells often claimed that they had been betrothed to Wutong. AccordingThe Enchantment of Wealth237"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"to Tang’s testimony, local officials in Jiangnan every year reported sev-eral dozen cases of women who around the time of marriage experienceddelusions, claimed to have sexual relations with the god, gradually be-came weak and emaciated, and died. Unscrupulous female mediums,upon hearing of illness afflicting a local woman, would proclaim to thefamily that Wutong had possessed her, desiring her as either a maidser-vant or a concubine. Family members would then feel compelled to makeofferings to the god to win the woman’s release.65Most reprehensible ofall, Tang complained, the families of these women did not consider thedeath of their daughter a misfortune. On the contrary, they believed thatthe god would amply compensate them for their loss.66Tang Bin’s indictment thus recapitulated the salient features ofWutong—god of wealth and debaucher of women—present in the pop-ular tradition. Both motifs can be found in Song popular folklore, butthey were partially erased by the efforts to transform Wutong into moresalubrious deities like Wuxian and Huaguang. Song and early Mingsources typically report that the benighted masses prayed to Wutong,much as they would to a local tutelary god, for relief from the commonmisfortunes of drought, flood, and pestilence. In late Ming Jiangnan, bycontrast, Wutong is depicted as wielding influence over the more cir-cumscribed spheres of business and marriage. Indeed, to the extent thatmarriage was conceived principally as an economic exchange, Wutongcan be seen as a specialist in the acquisition of wealth.At the same time, the cultural topos of Wutong as an incubus couldbe employed as a strategy by desperate young women wanting to freethemselves from their conjugal duties. It does not take much imagina-tion to recognize that betrothal or marriage to an utter stranger couldeasily incite depression, mania, and a host of other psychological ills. Nodoubt many young women, faced with an unknown fate and undergo-ing the psychic and physical tensions of sexual maturation, did indeedfall ill, and in extreme cases died.67Once the idea of demonic possessionby Wutong was joined in the popular mind with psychosomatic disor-ders, it then became available as a culturally accepted explanation foraberrant female behavior. The same cultural construct also offeredwomen an avenue of escape from the conjugal duties imposed on them.Lu Can stated that husbands of women possessed by Wutong dared notsleep with their wives; “even those who were determined to lay by theirwives found themselves thrown to the floor by the demon.”68The god’sinsistence on exclusive dominion over the sexual favors of the womenhe possessed is also a motif of the anonymous seventeenth-century story238The Enchantment of Wealth"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"from Shaxizhen recounted above. Women could turn this characteristicof Wutong to their advantage, cloaking their amorous adventures withwoeful tales of violation and victimization. Feng Menglong recounted acase in which a young woman attempted to cover up her sexual indis-cretion by claiming to have been debauched by Wutong’s henchman KingZhou Xuanling.69It seems that many gods of dubious moral standingengaged in such behavior.The peculiar role of the Wutong cult in sexual politics is fully illus-trated in a Qing anecdote purportedly dating from the time of Tang Bin’ssuppression of the cult.70This story is set against the background ofSuzhou’s religious processions and pageantry, which surpassed all oth-ers in ostentatious display and attracted immense crowds of onlookers.Such pageants provided a rare chance for women, normally sequesteredin the recesses of their homes, to venture out onto a balcony to watchthe passing spectacle, and thus gave young men an equally rare oppor-tunity to catch a glimpse of potential brides. In Suzhou, large groups ofyoung men accompanied the processions through the streets with an eyeon the balconies above, comparing and judging the women on theirbeauty. Afterward the youths gathered and deliberated, often for days,to determine which woman should be chosen as zhuangyuan,or “opti-mus” (the term also used for the candidate who took first place in thetriennial palace civil service examinations). The family of the optimuscould expect to be besieged by flocks of suitors coveting their daughter’shand in marriage.The anecdote relates the star-crossed fortunes of a clerk at the citymint named Zhao Wuguan, who fell into a terrible fit of anxiety upondiscovering that the woman chosen as optimus on one of these occasionswas none other than his own fiancée. Given his humble station in lifeand a paltry income of only ten-odd strings of cash per year—barelyenough to support himself and his mother—Zhao could not afford tomarry, and thus stood to lose his promised bride to one of his now nu-merous rivals. Zhao learned from his mother that his deceased fatherhad once contributed to a lending society from which members couldborrow a hundred strings of cash or more. The right to draw on the so-ciety’s funds, however, was determined by casting dice. Zhao decided toseek the assistance of Wutong. He visited the god’s temple and vowedthat if he was successful in the competition to obtain a loan he and hisfuture bride would return together and thank the god for his aid. Zhaosucceeded in throwing a perfect score and was able to borrow the moneyneeded to complete his marriage arrangements.The Enchantment of Wealth239"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"At the betrothal ceremony Zhao was elated to discover that his bride’sbeauty fully warranted her selection as optimus; his bride, however, wasrepulsed by Zhao’s ugly countenance. Following the marriage ceremonyand the couple’s visit to pay their respects at the Wutong temple, Zhaoentered his wife’s bedchamber to consummate the marriage. He was puz-zled to find her still fully dressed in her wedding clothes. The bride re-buffed Zhao’s advances, saying that she had been married not to Zhaobut to Wutong, who was about to arrive and claim her as his bride. Shefinally drove Zhao out of the room with the threat that the god wouldpunish him if he dared to lay a hand on her. Zhao then rushed off to finda doctor to treat his apparently deranged wife. Upon returning home,though, he found her dead, her room pervaded by an eerie odor.The notion that women who died young had been taken as consortsby gods was common in Chinese popular religious culture.71Despite TangBin’s vigorous campaign of suppression, throughout the eighteenth cen-tury illnesses and deaths of young women were commonly attributed toWutong, according to the eyewitness testimony of the historian Zhao Yi.Popular medical lore categorized these afflictions as “communion withthe gods” (shenhebing).72Women, by virtue of their yinqualities, wereespecially vulnerable to demonic possession, but their access to the di-vine world could also be a source of power. In her determination to yieldonly to her supernatural consort, Zhao Wuguan’s bride resembles thespirit mediums described in Gengsibianas having gained their super-natural powers through sexual union with Wutong. Sexual liaisons withpotent spirits like Wutong, though tinged with morbidity, at least offeredwomen release from the male-dominated institutions that defined anddelimited their social existence.73Tang Bin’s campaign against the Wutong cult was more successful thanmost state efforts to restrain popular religion. Major temples were de-stroyed or converted to other purposes, and for some time even domes-tic shrines to Wutong disappeared. In keeping with Tang Bin’s decree,Wufang xiansheng temples also became targets for suppression.74A lo-cal gazetteer from Changshu noted that in addition to Wutong temples,shrines dedicated to the god’s alter egos such as the Grand Dowager(Taima) and Five Transcendents (Wuxiana; an alternative name for Wu-fang xiansheng here) were also converted to other public uses.75Yet thelate seventeenth- and early eighteenth-century accounts that credited Tangwith having fully uprooted popular worship of Wutong proved to be pre-mature.76By the mid-eighteenth century, Confucian custodians of pub-lic morals ruefully conceded that the cult continued to thrive in new240The Enchantment of Wealth"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"guises.77Tang Bin had intended to convert the desecrated Wutong tem-ples into public schools.78More often than not, though, they were sim-ply dedicated to other popular deities with equally suspect credentials.The Wutong temple in the town of Puyuanzhen in Jiaxing, which hadeclipsed the adjoining Dongyue temple in the Ming period, reverted toservice as a Dongyue shrine.79The temple at Mount Shangfang, thoughinitially rededicated to Guandi, later emerged as a shrine to Comman-dant Jin and eventually reverted to a Wutong shrine.80The Wuxian tem-ple outside Nanjing’s main gate had also been converted to a Guanditemple, but the Wutong cult continued to thrive at a separate shrine lo-cated within the same temple compound.81In 1732, another governor-general of Jiangsu, Yin Jishan, launched anew campaign of suppression aimed at eradicating the Wutong and Wu-fang xiansheng cults.82This effort, too, had only a transient effect. A fewyears later, the Suzhou counties of Wujiang and Zhenze reported thatthe custom of holding tea séances had revived. The central position amongthe array of deities placed on an altar during the séances was occupiedby an anonymous ruler of the district (junzhu), understood to be noneother than the mother of Wutong; a painted image of Wutong usuallyhung by her side.83A local historian in nearby Zhouzhuang dated the re-vival of spirit medium cults focused on Wutong to the late eighteenthcentury.84Worship of Wutong (usually under the name Wusheng) also contin-ued to flourish in the Hang-Jia-Hu sericulture region. In Huzhou,Wusheng and the tutelary deity Commandant Jin were paired as twingods of wealth: “In the eyes of the townsfolk Commandant Jin andWusheng are regarded as gods of wealth and honored with temples andsacrifices. On the second and sixteenth days of each month the inhabi-tants provide offerings of three kinds of meat to both gods. This rite isknown as ‘propitiation for a profitable market’ (bai lishi).”85On the eveof the Qingming festival, people “from one hundred liaround” flockedto the Wuxian temple outside the town of Tangxizhen in Hangzhou pre-fecture to seek the god’s blessings during the upcoming silkworm-rais-ing season.86By the beginning of the nineteenth century, the Wushengcult had fully revived in the Huzhou silk manufacture center of Shuang-linzhen: “Rural families pray equally to gods of agriculture and sericul-ture. They worship Fierce General Liu and make offerings to the Horse-Head Maiden (Matouniang, a local sericultural deity), and shrines toCommandant Jin are found everywhere. Belief in demons is an abidingcustom in Huzhou, and the Wusheng shrines are most numerous of all.”The Enchantment of Wealth241"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"Shuanglinzhen’s inhabitants worshiped Wusheng at the close of the year,at the Qingming festival in the spring, and at the summer Duanwu fes-tival, when offerings were made to the gods of pestilence.87Despite official persecution, the Wutong cult remained widespread inJiangnan, even though it was far less visible than before.88In order toevade the prohibition against worship of Wutong, people frequentlyturned to surrogates such as the Grand Dowager (i.e., Wutong’s mother)or Lord Ma (i.e., Marshal Ma).89In the Jiangnan countryside—especiallyin the Hang-Jia-Hu region, but also in Suzhou and Songjiang—the cultof Wutong persisted throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth cen-turies.90The god’s terrifying aspect endured as well. The image of Wu-xian seen in a Nanjing temple in the 1840s was described as a fierce, evil-looking statue cast in a pose of throttling and trampling upon smallchildren.91Wutong’s reputation as a debaucher of women remained acommonplace of nineteenth-century elite lore about the god, in whichWutong’s role as a god of wealth was largely rendered invisible.92TheWufang xiansheng cult also flourished in some localities in the nineteenthcentury. In the Suzhou countryside, village worship societies celebratedthe spring festivals (usually dedicated to tutelary spirits) in honor of Wu-fang xiansheng, while they devoted the autumn harvest festivals to FierceGeneral Liu and other local gods.93Interestingly enough, the memory of Tang Bin’s campaign of sup-pression was perpetuated not only by elite critics of vernacular religion,but also through the apotheosis of Tang into a demonifuge spirit whodoes battle against demonic attack. In 1823, Tang Bin received posthu-mous imperial honors and was inducted into the pantheon of Confucianworthies. Wooden plaques bearing his name were installed in the Con-fucian temples of public schools. Subsequently those who believed them-selves to be suffering from affliction caused by Wutong would take TangBin’s plaque from a school temple and place it on their domestic altar inthe hope that Tang’s spirit would exorcise the demon.94Yet this resortto Tang Bin’s spiritual aid merely underscores the tenacity of popular be-lief in Wutong’s interference in people’s lives. The influence that Wutongwas believed to exercise over ordinary people despite campaigns of sup-pression by the likes of Tang Bin is the theme of a story related by thepoet and raconteur Yuan Mei (1716–98) in his collection Things of Whichthe Master Did Not Speak.In this anecdote a local man, disgusted bythe fact that a statue of Wutong in a Buddhist monastery in Nanjing stoodin a position superior to that of Guandi, took the liberty of moving thestatues to reverse their hierarchical order. That night the man was vis-242The Enchantment of Wealth"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"ited by an enraged spirit who identified himself as the “Great King Wu-tong.” The spirit said that although he was powerless against exalted andrighteous officials like Tang Bin and Yin Jishan, he would not forgive this“petty town dweller” (shijing xiaoren)for his insolent act of desecration.The man collapsed, raving, and despite the efforts of his family membersto appease the god with sacrifices he died shortly afterward.95In 1835, the Manchu governor of Jiangnan, Yuqian (Boluoqian), re-ported that disreputable monks and spirit mediums were once again ply-ing their trade at Mount Shangfang, exacting considerable fees in ex-change for invoking Wutong’s intercession on behalf of their clients.Yuqian also complained that merchants and shopkeepers, just as in TangBin’s day, spoke of becoming rich by borrowing from the god’s stock ofsupernatural capital. The merchants did not use Wutong’s name; insteadthey appealed to Lord Ma or the Grand Dowager to assist them with a“covert loan.”96Yuqian directed local officials to take forceful measuresto halt such practices, arrested the monks at the Mount Shangfang tem-ple, and ordered the destruction of all shrines dedicated to Wutong, Wu-xian, or Wufang xiansheng. Four years later, though, he conceded thathis campaign had made little headway against entrenched superstition.97In addition to condemning the practice of “borrowing covert loans”(jie yinzhai), Yuqian fulminated against the activities of female spirit medi-ums (shiniang)who claimed to act as intercessors with Wutong.98Themediums preyed upon sick women, whose illnesses they diagnosed asafflictions caused by the god. Credulous family members would followthe medium’s instruction to take the women to one of the god’s shrines,where a healing ritual known as “invoking joy” (jiaoxi)would be per-formed.99These mediums also performed another healing ritual knownas “the Grand Dowager’s penance” (Taimu chan), which, because it wasan esoteric rite unknown to Buddhist or Daoist priests, was far morecostly than other types of ritual healing. Mediums also continued to per-form tea séances (in this instance referred to as “attending séance”[daiyan]) in the homes of their clients to succor the ill and bless mar-riages. Yuqian discovered that although the monks at Mount Shangfangdared not openly worship Wutong, an empty alcove covered by a cur-tain but containing no icon was set aside for those who wished to seekthe god’s blessings. The monks also purveyed a variety of icons—smallportable shrines; paper images of Wutong, the Grand Dowager, and LordMa; and wooden seals carved with the legend “Pursue fortune and bless-ings will descend” (Quji jiangfu)—to the public at hefty prices. Manyfamilies discreetly placed a Wutong altar in their bedchambers or toilets,The Enchantment of Wealth243"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"well hidden from public view; others, unwilling to harbor images of Wu-tong anywhere in their home, paid mediums to make offerings to Wu-tong in their stead.100In Beijing, where the cult elicited little attention from the authorities,the imperially endorsed Wuxian continued to be worshiped as a god ofwealth throughout the Qing period. Indeed, the major temple dedicatedto a god of wealth in eighteenth-century Beijing was the Wuxian God-of-Wealth Temple outside the capital’s Guang’an Gate.101In the late eigh-teenth century, a Five Brothers Temple (Wugemiao) outside Beijing’sZhangyi Gate was said to be a shrine for “the Wutong of the southernregion.” At this temple, according to Yu Jiao, a native of Shaoxing andobserver of Beijing mores, mountainous stacks of gold and silver spiritmoney were piled up before the statues (depicted in martial poses) of thefive gods in this temple. “Seekers of wealth” first performed rites ofpurification and ablution before approaching the altar, where they would“borrow” the amount they required. Several months later the borrow-ers would return to present meat offerings and return twice the amountof spirit money they had taken. Yu intercepted one such votary and askedhim whether he had obtained the money he sought. The man replied“No,” but added that by returning spirit money to the god despite nothaving received anything he was demonstrating his sincerity and couldexpect the god’s favor in the future. A diminution in his offerings, on theother hand, would surely preclude any chance of becoming rich.102Just as Wutong’s penchant for debauchery persisted as an explana-tion for illness and premature death among young women, Wutong con-tinued to be worshiped as a god of wealth. Yet over the course of theeighteenth century the conception of the god of wealth itself underwenta fundamental change. In large part this transformation resulted fromthe appropriation of the god of wealth by urban shopkeepers andwealthy merchants, groups who began to develop a bourgeois ethic ofcollective entrepreneurship and solidarity. The first stirrings of this bour-geois consciousness can be found in didactic popular literature of the lateMing, which promoted a synthetic ethic of moral integrity, wise invest-ment of money, and philanthropy as superior to the straitlaced parsimonyof both the sanctimonious Confucian and the abstemious miser. In con-trast to the devotional emphasis of organized religion, this ethic of moraltemperance stressed the practical piety of good deeds and magnanimitytoward others as the wellsprings of fortune, for oneself and one’s de-scendants. While embracing self-reliance, hard work, and individual en-trepreneurship, it also encouraged moral self-reflection, positive acts of244The Enchantment of Wealth"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"charity, and commitment to the welfare of society. This ethic thus offereda middle path between ostentatious self-indulgence and ascetic frugalitythat had particular appeal for the urban middle class of self-made shop-keepers, petty merchants, and artisans.103The ethic of moral temperance was abetted by the greater accom-modation of merchants and mercantile wealth within elite Confuciandiscourse in the late Ming and Qing periods.104More significantly, the ide-ology of moral temperance became a hallmark of merchant corporations—trade guilds, native place associations, philanthropic institutions, and wor-shiping societies—that proliferated rapidly from the seventeenth centuryonward.105All of these groups sought to cement their bonds of solidarityand to promote collective prosperity through religious ritual, with a par-ticular focus on patron saints and tutelary deities. Not surprisingly, guildsand other merchant groups defined collective prosperity in terms of ma-terial wealth and gain. Thus many patron saints became gods of wealth intheir own right. Merchants and bankers from Shanxi and Shaanxi prov-inces, whose far-flung network of partnerships and business contactscomprised the most powerful commercial institution in eighteenth-century China, routinely attributed their commercial success to the om-nipotence of their own patron saint, Guandi. Gradually Guandi came tobe venerated specifically as a god of wealth, and his cult spread through-out China.106In Jiangnan, the Wutong cult’s unsavory qualities and the shadow ofofficial proscription rendered it unsuitable as a vehicle of bourgeois aspi-rations. Urban shopkeepers instead paid homage to the god of wealth,under the title of the God of the Five Paths to Wealth (Wulu caishen), asan entity separate from Wutong. Gu Sizhang, in a work published in 1799,wrote that “the God of the Five Paths was formerly known as Wusheng”;after the Wutong cult’s suppression by Tang Bin “[the deity’s] name waschanged to Wulu, also known as ‘the god of wealth.’”107Wulu caishengradually superseded Wutong as the focal deity of the god-of-wealth rit-uals performed on the fifth day of the New Year. Qing sources refer to theprincipal ceremonies on this day and the preceding evening as Greetingthe Pathfinder (Jie lutou). This event, essentially a shopkeeper’s festival,is described in an early twentieth-century gazetteer for the silk-weavingtown of Shuanglinzhen:On the night of the fourth day of the New Year, at the fourth or fifth watch,sacrifices are prepared for the god of wealth. This ceremony is known asGreeting the Pathfinder. The sound of exploding firecrackers lasts all nightwithout cease, even exceeding the commotion made on New Year’s Eve. AThe Enchantment of Wealth245"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"statue of the God of the Five Paths to Wealth rests in the Taiping BridgeTemple. The city’s merchants join together in worshiping societies, whichmeet on the evening of the fourth to entertain the god with music andfanfare. At midnight they assemble and carry the god’s image and regalia in processions throughout the four precincts of the city.108The practice of seeking loans from the god of wealth, central to Wutong’srole as the god of wealth, endured in the Wulu caishen cult. On the fifthday of the New Year merchants would enact the ritual of “borrowing in-augural treasure” (jie yuanbao)from wealth gods. This loan is taken inthe form of spirit money, in return for which the borrower makessacrificial offerings to the god during the course of the year, and then re-pays double or ten times the amount borrowed the following year.109An-other ritual commonly performed as part of Greeting the Pathfinder washanging from the rafters a pair of live carp to which paper imitations ofthe yuanbaoingots were attached. The frantic jumping of these “livingyuanbao” was taken as an auspicious omen of the household’s futuresuccess in overcoming obstacles to obtaining wealth.110Wulu caishen’s votaries were unabashedly devoted to the pursuit ofmaterial gain, but they devised a variety of theories concerning the god’sorigins to sanitize the cult and efface its sinister past. Gu Lu, chroniclerof early nineteenth-century Suzhou customs, accepted the theory thatWulu caishen originally referred to the five sons of Gu Yewang, a Suzhounative and eminent official of the sixth century. He thus provided Wulucaishen with a legitimate origin as a cult dedicated to the emulation ofan exemplar of Confucian virtues. But Gu also admitted that in the Mingperiod the cult had grown into the excessive and deviant forms that TangBin sought to extirpate.111The effort to cloak the cult in the robes of orthodoxy largely succeeded.Temples dedicated specifically to the god of wealth, omitting any men-tion of Wutong, proliferated throughout Jiangnan in the eighteenth cen-tury, apparently with the full approval of local officials.112In 1773, forexample, the prefect of Suzhou, in concert with local notables, raisedfunds to purchase land and construct a magnificent temple to Wulucaishen.113Additional god-of-wealth temples were built in Suzhou in1796, 1807, and 1818, and by the early twentieth century numerous god-of-wealth shrines existed throughout the Suzhou countryside.114The godof wealth also figured as the principal icon in some merchant guildhalls,though guilds, particularly those organized along the lines of native placeassociations, tended to use patron saints rather than a generic god ofwealth as their focal cult.115246The Enchantment of Wealth"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"At the same time ordinary townsfolk throughout Jiangnan con-structed, on a far more modest scale, shrines to Wulu caishen, known ashalls of the Five Paths (wulutang). These small temples were especiallyprominent in the region’s textile manufacturing and marketing towns,including Nanxun, Shuanglin, Zhenze, Pingwang, Nanxiang, Luzhi,Shaxi, and Huangjing. The local histories of these towns, in contrast toSuzhou, where Wulu caishen had been stripped of any association withWutong, do not hesitate to identify Wulu caishen with Wutong. A lateeighteenth-century gazetteer from Huangjing, for instance, states that “onthe fifth day of the New Year the townsfolk worship Wutong, colloqui-ally known as Wulu caishen.”116Alongside Wulu caishen another figure, the hoary plague god ZhaoGongming, also emerged as a staunchly virtuous god of wealth. Thisdeity, grouped with Wuxian’s alter ego Marshal Ma as one of the fourgreat heavenly marshals, had an ancient pedigree in the Thunder Ritesexorcism literature.117Cryptic passages in a fourteenth-century ritualcompendium associate Zhao and his twin lieutenants He He Erxian withgood fortune in trade and imply that Zhao, in his capacity as a celes-tial bureaucrat, ensures that prosperity and amity prevail in the worldof commerce.118This account of Zhao’s origins, powers, and role as agod of wealth is reprinted almost verbatim in a popular religious tractof the Ming period.119Whereas the scriptural tradition claims that Zhaowas a Daoist adept who withdrew from the secular world in the darkdays of the Qin dynasty, the sixteenth-century novel Investiture of theGodsportrays Zhao as a potent generalissimo in the employ of the vileKing Zhou of Shang who is subdued by the supernatural legions of KingWu of Zhou. At the close of the novel, though, Zhao is reconciled withthe forces of good. The supreme deity, Yuanshi tianzun, awards him thetitle Perfected Lord of the Dark Altar (Xuantan zhenjun) and chargeshim with bestowing blessings on the good and bringing the wicked tojustice. To aid him in these tasks Zhao is assigned four assistants, whosetitles clearly indicate their function as wealth gods: the Celestial Ven-erable Who Discovers Treasures (Zhaobao tianzun), the Celestial Ven-erable Who Dispenses Rarities (Nazhen tianzun), the Messenger WhoBrings Wealth (Zhaocai shizhe), and the Immortal Official of ProfitableMarkets (Lishi xianguan).120Yet, although Zhao Gongming was widelyworshiped as a god of wealth in modern times, especially in southernChina, observers of popular customs and ritual life made scant refer-ence to him before the nineteenth century.121In the latter part of theQing period Zhao, dubbed the Martial God of Wealth (Wu caishen),The Enchantment of Wealth247"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"and his four assistants merged into the cult of the Gods of the Five Pathsto Wealth (figure 35).122Thus Wutong did not disappear; in many cases the deity was simplysubmerged in the cults of its surrogates. Yet as the god of wealth wasshorn of his malevolent features and recast as a bulwark of conventionalvirtues, Wutong receded from view. This change occurred not as a directconsequence of the state’s suppression of the Wutong cult, but rather be-cause merchants and shopkeepers increasingly abandoned the older con-ception of wealth as a diabolical force in favor of the new bourgeois ethic.Consequently, the cult of the god of wealth came to serve a different pur-pose. Rather than disrupting the existing order, the god of wealthconfirmed it, and thereby legitimated the prosperity enjoyed by the mer-chants who patronized his cult.Consider, for example, the image of Wulu caishen presented in a pop-248The Enchantment of WealthFigure 35.

Their virtuous conduct is broughtto the attention of the Jade Emperor, who bestows on them five sons,each born on the fifth day of the first month.124When the sons reach theage of sixteen each wishes to make his way in the world as an official, asoldier, a shopkeeper, an overseas merchant, or a pawnbroker. Their fa-ther dissuades them, arguing that farming is the noblest occupation ofall. Henceforth the five sons enrich the family through their keen instinctsfor managing the family farm and keeping sharp eyes on the markets fortheir goods. On one occasion they purchase charcoal at a low price fromthe town merchants and reap a great profit when heavy, unseasonablesnows fall the following autumn. On another occasion the brothers buyup a peddler’s inventory of fans after the summer heat had already passed,and then sell them off at a handsome profit when midwinter weather turnsfreakishly hot. The brothers also perform pious acts, such as releasing acarp bought from a fishmonger. The carp turns out to be the son of theDragon King, whose father is eternally grateful to the five brothers fortheir act of compassion. At the close of the story the Jade Emperor ap-points the five brothers as celestial bureaucrats entitled Great Generalsof the Five Paths (Wulu da jiangjun), who are charged with overseeingthe distribution of wealth among mortals.125The Precious Scroll of the God of Wealthis suffused with conventionalsocial values, such as the commonplace axiom that farming is a morallysuperior calling. Its secular bent—the brothers neither seek nor receivedivine aid in their ventures—and the abiding insinuation that gainingwealth is linked to personal morality and the performance of good worksunderscore the vast distance between Wutong and the emerging moderncult of the god of wealth. At the outset, the narrative reiterates the no-tion, already prevalent in didactic literature of the late Ming, that accu-mulating an abundance of material wealth invariably entails diminutionof other forms of wealth (lack of male progeny).126Yet the sons’ exploitsultimately reaffirm the acquisitive ethic of moral capital celebrated in lateMing and Qing merit ledgers.The cult of Wulu caishen, unlike its progenitor, emphasized typicalbusiness virtues: hard work, modesty, thrift, and integrity—in short,making money by using one’s own wits and talents rather than de-pending on a diabolic bargain with a malevolent spirit.

Instead, wealth was conceived as ayang virtue and associated with powerful gods of incorruptible recti-tude such as Guandi and Zhao Gongming. New Year’s prints of the nine-teenth and twentieth centuries unabashedly celebrate the multitude ofriches—rank, money, and above all a happily united family—that therich and powerful enjoy (figure 36). In the face of this “yangification”of wealth the fiendish Wutong and his coterie of surrogates like theGrand Dowager eventually faded away.127The pronounced contrast between the character of the modern godsof wealth and that of Wutong raises the question of why the modern ver-sion emerged from such tainted origins. Never does anyone suggest thatWutong possesses any redeeming virtues worthy of emulation. Wutongat best is mischievous; more commonly he is seen as actively malevolent,violating women, disrupting family life, and causing madness and death.The riches and good fortune Wutong brings are often illusory or tem-porary; sometimes the god appears as a thief or causes people to losewhat wealth they possess. Merchants who had appealed to Wutong sawthemselves as living on borrowed money that must be repaid with sub-stantial interest. In short, the development of the Wutong cult suggestsa pervasive sense of anxiety about money: how to get it, and, especially,how to keep it. In the popular mind, wealth was not produced by livingvirtuously, or through prudent investment and planning. Instead, moneywas believed to be under the control of malicious and notoriously unre-liable supernatural forces. This conception of money reflects, I think, theprofound economic insecurities generated by the rise of the money econ-omy in the sixteenth century. By contrast, the stability of the market econ-omy in the eighteenth century fostered a more positive image of moneyand wealth.The ubiquity of the Wutong cult throughout Jiangnan attests to themarked psychological impact of money and the market on the individ-ual and the household economy. The economy of Jiangnan in the lateMing period was robust, but also highly volatile. Only slowly did socialand economic institutions adjust to the rise of the money economy. Atelling illustration of this lag can be seen in the inability of either the stateor the market to stabilize the currency system. Imports of bullion fromthe New World and Japan in the final decades of the sixteenth centuryfed commercial expansion and inaugurated a long-term cycle of growth.At the same time the flood of silver wreaked havoc with a domestic cur-rency system predicated on maintaining the fragile balance in the ex-The Enchantment of Wealth251"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"change ratio between bronze currency and uncoined silver.128Actually,the scarcity of bronze specie had led to the de facto establishment of sil-ver as the dominant standard of monetary value long before the influxof foreign silver. Already at the beginning of the sixteenth century theMing state frantically tried to reassert control over the money supply byincreasing the output of its mints. Yet throughout the century China suf-fered from an acute dearth of coin. Outside the two capitals and the eco-nomically advanced areas along the Grand Canal corridor bronze coinsvirtually disappeared from circulation. The demand for coin encouragedcounterfeiting, which in turn frustrated the state’s efforts to sustain thenominal value of its coins and eventually caused a severe depreciationof legal tender. Silver, its quantity dramatically increased by imports,usurped most functions of bronze coins both in the marketplace and instate finances in the last half of the sixteenth century. But uncoined sil-ver remained a primitive, indeed regressive, form of money. Its worthwas determined solely by its intrinsic value, which could be ascertainedonly through cumbersome measurement of its weight and purity. Prolif-erating use of silver stimulated commercial growth, but it also injectednew insecurities into economic exchange.Bronze coins endured in the urban sector of the economy, whose dailypetty transactions required a more convenient means of payment. Yet vir-tually all of these coins, as government officials woefully admitted, werecounterfeit. Throughout the last century of the Ming dynasty fiscal plan-ners careened back and forth between restrictive and expansionary poli-cies. Every state initiative to control the money supply prompted mer-chants, money changers, and the urban populace in general to devisecountervailing strategies to protect their incomes. Throughout the firsthalf of the seventeenth century rampant counterfeiting of coins drove thestate to debase its own issues, triggering depreciation and inflation. Er-ratic state monetary policy also incited repeated violence and rioting inJiangnan cities. In the eyes of many plebeians, money in its physical forms,whether silver or bronze coins, exhibited the diabolical capriciousnessattributed to the fickle god of wealth upon whom fortune depended.Thus, the new forms of economic exchange tended to generate fearand unease rather than optimism and rising expectations. The rapidgrowth of the money economy fostered urbanization without producingsocial institutions that might help to integrate immigrants from the coun-tryside into the unfamiliar urban environment or to shield them from thefluctuations of the money economy. Guilds were in their infancy; noneof the corporate institutions that William Rowe sees as promoting the252The Enchantment of Wealth"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"development of civic consciousness in nineteenth-century Hankou playeda significant role in late Ming cities. Not surprisingly, then, the initial ex-pansion of the money economy gave rise to a conception of wealth as adispensation from inconstant and demonic forces.From the eighteenth century onward the image of the god of wealthin his various permutations evolved in the direction of a more standardgod, one that human beings could easily manipulate. The god of wealthbecame a euhemeristic embodiment of domestic and public virtues. Sucha conception of wealth was obviously congenial to the state and pros-perous merchants, yet popular acceptance undoubtedly could not be wonsimply through ideological appeals. Instead, the transformation of Wu-tong into Wulu caishen in the eighteenth century should be seen in thecontext of a more stable commercial economy (especially in terms of mon-etary stability) and urban social milieu. The stability of the economy inthe eighteenth century stood in marked contrast to the rapid oscillationsbetween boom and bust that plagued the late Ming. Once exploitationof Yunnan’s copper mines began on a massive scale in the 1730s, the Qingstate was able to produce bronze coins in sufficient quantities to estab-lish a sound currency. The predictability of the exchange values of cur-rency and widespread confidence in both forms of money spurred a sharpincrease in the use of coin. Bronze coins once again prevailed as the pre-dominant means of exchange.129The reliability of currency and stabil-ity of prices that characterized most of the eighteenth century coincidedwith the growth of corporate bodies, notably native place associations,trade guilds, and social welfare institutions, that provided refuges fromthe rigors of the marketplace and city life.130Thus both the money econ-omy and urban society evoked a sense of stability and security whollyabsent in the sixteenth century. Correspondingly, given the lack of insti-tutions to control prices or cushion town dwellers against economicshocks in the late Ming period, we can readily understand why the moneyeconomy initially inspired a conception of the god of wealth as a malev-olent rather than benign force.Yet even the combination of imperial repression and displacement bythe temperate piety of the growing urban middle classes did not uprootthe Wutong cult from the religious landscape of Jiangnan. Thoughlargely eliminated from urban religious life, especially in towns with asubstantial official presence, worship of Wutong remained central to ru-ral religious life.

These shrines couldeven be as rudimentary as three bricks, two standing on end and one laidon top of the others, on which a label bearing the god’s name waspasted.131A survey conducted in Jiashan county (Jiaxing) in the 1940srevealed that 289 of its 580 shrines (excepting Buddhist and Daoist ones)were dedicated to Wusheng. The same survey reported that the county’s783 shrines (including Buddhist and Daoist ones) contained 1,455Wusheng icons, far more than any other deity.132As in the Qing period,devotion to Wusheng was most fervent in the Hang-Jia-Hu sericultureregion. Canhua Wusheng, depicted in popular iconography as a malefigure with three eyes and six arms holding various equipment used inraising silkworms and manufacturing silk, was venerated at each stageof the silk manufacture process.133In addition to Canhua Wusheng, onealso found cults dedicated to Kelong Wusheng (Cocoon Wusheng),Chetou Wusheng (Silk Reel Wusheng), and Jishen Wusheng (Loom GodWusheng). Although our sources do not specify whether this set of deitieswas regarded as benevolent or baleful, the capricious trickster Wushengcertainly would have served as a fitting symbol of the economic insecu-rity that plagued Jiangnan’s peasant silk producers in the first half of thetwentieth century.134In rural religion, then, the Wutong cult and the god’s explicit associ-ation with wealth and fortune survived and even flourished.135Wuxian,Wusheng, and Canhua Wusheng continued to hold positions of honoramong the gods of wealth in the grand assembly of gods convened byspirit mediums who performed the “purchase of divine blessings” (tanfo)ritual on behalf of their clients. Although Zhao Gongming was includedamong the gods of wealth in these rites, Guandi was not.136A wood-block print from the early twentieth century shows that Mount Shang-fang and its reigning deities remained prominent in popular lore aboutthe vicissitudes of wealth and fortune (figure 37). The maxims illustratedin this print fully acknowledge that wealth confers power, but warn thatgreed and underhanded means of gaining wealth will inevitably bringruin. Still, we find here express affirmation of the belief that “wealth cancommunicate with the gods.” Piety augments, but by no means displaces,invocation of divine aid by means of eudaemonistic offerings.The cult center at Mount Shangfang has remained a popular pil-grimage site, despite periodic persecution that has continued into the Re-publican and Communist periods.

Yet worshipersstill come to the temple primarily to “borrow a covert loan” (jieyinzhai).137The ability of the cult to accommodate shifting tides of ide-ological control is epitomized by the pair of hanging scrolls flanking thetemple’s main altar, which celebrate Tang Bin, the cult’s most celebratednemesis, as a paragon of “correctness” (zheng).138Here once again wesee the symbols and instruments of state power expropriated by ordi-nary subjects to sanctify their own gods, just as the regalia of imperialritual are appropriated in service to local deities throughout China.The evolution of the Wutong cult belies the common assumption thatvernacular religion is conservative, inherently resistant to change.

Consequently worship of Wutong atrophied withinthe urban milieu. Yet at the same time devotion to Wutong, understoodprecisely as a capricious god of wealth, intensified in the countryside,most notably in the sericulture region of Hang-Jia-Hu, where peasantswere most vulnerable to the vicissitudes of the market economy. Ratherthan unifying urban and rural religious cultures, the Wutong cult of therecent past increasingly marked the disparity between them.256The Enchantment of Wealth"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"ConclusionThe shape-changing Wutong, lurid caricature of polymorphous sexual-ity, seems out of place in the urbane Song world, from which radiatedwaves of Confucian learning that brought rational reflection and soberfaith in human perfection to the farthest reaches of the empire. Or at mostthe Wutong spirits might appear to be a vestige of an earlier era of be-nighted custom and rustic ignorance. Yet the Wutong cult was very mucha part of its age, giving expression to the lures of wealth, ambition, anddesire that epitomized the convulsive changes in social mores taking placeduring the Song and afterward.Song religious culture was charged with ostentatious emotion and luridspectacle: witness the grisly tortures meted out by the Courts of the TenInfernal Kings, the penitents in Dongyue processions who turned them-selves into “living flesh lamps” by hanging flaming braziers from hooksimpaled in their arms and chests, Miaoshan’s sacrifice of her eyes andarms to heal her father’s horrible affliction, and the swarms of beggarsdressed as the ghostly lackeys of Zhong Kui who materialized on everyhousehold’s threshold on the eve of the New Year. This riot of sensation,real or imagined, bespoke a profound elaboration of the preoccupationwith sin, death, and atonement that had emerged in the Han period. Thebaroque cult of death fixated on the torments of infernal punishment gaveforce and immediacy to the notion of a cosmos predicated on moral equi-librium. Yet astringent Confucian homilies did little to relieve eschato-logical anxieties. Growing despair over the burden of sins accumulated257"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"over many lifetimes clashed with Confucian faith in human improvement.The Confucians’ stoic belief in chance destiny likewise provided thin gruelfor souls hungry for a less impoverished life, either in the mortal worldor beyond.Transformations wrought by death had been central to Chinese reli-gion since earliest times. Exalted rulers of the Shang and early Zhou eras,supreme over mortal men, lived in thrall to intemperate ancestors andtheir ravening appetite for sacrifices. From the Han onward, as the deadthemselves became subject to divine judgment and punishment, deceasedancestors evoked more pity than fear. The ancestors still compelled rev-erence, but no longer inspired awe. The charismatic majesty that had oncecaptivated their living descendants faded before the terrifying prospectof summonses from the stern underworld tribunes delivered by the ox-headed and horse-headed minions who did their bidding. As in the past,though, the local cults of Song vernacular religion coalesced around hu-man figures transfigured by death. Most gods, especially those honoredas local tutelary deities, were initially envisioned as ghosts, spirits of deadhumans whose unspent life force lingered in the mortal world. In deaththese spirits retained the charismatic power they manifested in their mor-tal lives—as officials and warriors, but also as mediums and seers. Mirac-ulous demonstrations of these powers (lingyan)prompted human beingsto worship them, not simply out of reverence, but perhaps most impor-tantly to appease these troubled spirits. Gods deemed responsive (ling-gan)to the entreaties of mortals (entreaties that were invariably medi-ated by sacrifice and pledge) achieved recognition as patrons of localcommunities. Yet just as the Song imperial state displaced military forcewith civil authority, the “dead generals” of earlier local cults became sub-ordinated to a new pantheon composed of civil officials invested withbureaucratic authority, ruling not through brute will but rather in ac-cordance with a strict canon of laws. Power and station in mortal lifetranslated into exalted position in death. Civil magistrates were believedto maintain their dignity in the afterlife by virtue of appointment to theinfernal government or as local chenghuang(the two most bureaucra-tized parts of the divine world, we might note). Yet charismatic individ-uals of humble station might also ascend to the ranks of the gods, serv-ing their communities as tudispirits.Chinese of the early imperial era looked out upon an enchanted worldpopulated by august mountain gods, fiendish fairies and goblins, ancientstones and trees that might suddenly come to life, ghosts of the unshrivendead lurking around grave sites, and resident spirits inhabiting every258Conclusion"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"patch of ground. Mortals could carve out their own domains only by ap-peasing the multitude of spirits upon whom their farms and homes tres-passed with timely sacrifices and prudent reverence. The progress of set-tlement in south China during the Song gave birth to a new class ofterritorial cults with tightly circumscribed sovereignty, each extendingno farther than a cluster of villages or a township, and many confinedto a few hamlets or an urban neighborhood. Unlike spirits who inheredin the landscape, these tudigods were bound to the community throughbonds of affinity and sentiment (ganqing)that originated in their mor-tal lives as members of the community. The tudispirits shared a com-mon history with the communities they served. Some tudihad been vir-tuous and illustrious notables, others uncanny seers and practitioners ofoccult arts, and still others ancient heroes whose deeds remained alivein memory and folklore. Graves rooted these spirits to particular sites,though temples allowed them a certain mobility, enabling them to residein more distant places as well. The tudistood in ambiguous relation tothe heavenly pantheon. They did not simply serve as terrestrial super-numeraries of the recondite celestial gods, carrying out the decrees oftheir superiors; the tudiwere also patrons and shepherds of their com-munities. Through a continuous stream of miraculous interventions—relieving drought, quelling floods, subduing epidemics, and fending offroving bandits and marauding armies—the tudirenewed their bond tothe community and secured its devotion. Though the tudioccupied thelowest rank of the divine pantheon, each was sovereign within his owndomain. Hence their mortal clients invariably hailed them as “kings,”with or without the endorsement of the imperial state.The creation of these tudicults was facilitated by the vernaculariza-tion of ritual and the means of communication with the gods. Daoist ritesof petition and propitiation required the mediation of priests, but the ris-ing tide of Pure Land Buddhism fostered a lay piety grounded in directappeal to divine saviors. The proliferation of cults devoted to deities likeGuanyin and Zhenwu abetted the vernacularization of ritual practice andenabled ordinary people to approach the gods through simple and directchannels of prayer and supplication. Both Daoism and Buddhism flour-ished not as ecclesiastic churches centrally governed by canon law, butas countless local parishes nested in the communities that nurtured them.Masters of ritual (fashi), whether ordained or not, adapted theology andritual therapy to practical purposes, to win blessings, avert calamity, andexorcise the omnipresent demons. Many of these therapeutic regimeswere subsumed into ecclesiastic religion, but institutionalized BuddhismConclusion259"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"and Daoism themselves remained congeries of local traditions. Somemodern scholars have suggested that the essential unity of Chinese reli-gion is to be found in a “shamanic substrate” underlying its disparatetraditions.1Ned Davis has modified this proposition by asserting thatspirit possession mediated by fashiwithin the context of exorcistic andtherapeutic rituals was the common basis of Chinese religious practice.2Through the fashithe vast ritual arsenals of both Daoism and Buddhismwere placed at the disposal of ordinary people, widening access to di-vine power and blessings. In many cases the fashimerged with the localspirit mediums (wu). But the wuremained rooted in the locality and itsresident spirits, while the fashicirculated widely, as did the ritual prac-tices they brought with them.The close identification of wuwith their patron gods may have playedan important role in the emergence of tudicults. Hamashima Atsutoshihas proposed that not only did the wufoster the zongguantutelary cultsof Jiangnan, but the zongguandeities themselves were the apotheosizedancestors of the wu,who were members of a hereditary profession thatlaid proprietary claims to particular territories.3The actual genealogicalconnection between the wuand their patron deities remains unclear; itwas common for mediums to take the names of their patrons as a signof a spiritual bond.4It is worth noting, though, that Jiangnan’s zong-guancults originated in the thirteenth to fifteenth centuries, a period inwhich clerics held high status and unusual authority within local soci-ety. In the competition for popular allegiance, alliances of patrician lead-ers, local wealth (landed or mercantile), and charismatic clergy no doubtcarried considerable weight in determining which gods should representthe interests of the community as a whole.Daoist and Buddhist clergy as well as the imperial state sought to ap-propriate these local gods and subordinate them to established authori-ties within both the divine and temporal realms. Ecclesiastic leaders andimperial officials each sought to impress their own particular brands oforthodoxy in recruiting proper candidates for inclusion in their respec-tive pantheons. Yet political exigency, particularly in the Southern Song,when the refugee government at Hangzhou desperately needed to shoreup popular support, often prompted concession to local interests. Norcould the clergy, possessing only modest economic resources of their own,easily defy popular will and entrenched belief. The procedures for in-corporation in the official registers of sacrifices, despite the apparent rigorof multiple independent confirmations of a god’s miraculous deeds, servedto broaden rather than narrow the domain of orthodox worship. Hier-260Conclusion"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"atic and imperial canonization generated elaborate pantheons that werearrayed in hierarchical order but still elastic enough for periodic expan-sion and local modification. The proliferation of cults resulted not in uni-formity, but rather in continual adaptation to local contexts. Definitionsof ritual space and time, given concrete expression through temples andfestivals, displayed remarkable heterogeneity across the empire.The mobility of Song society, accelerated by the shift from overlandto water-borne transport, encouraged the circulation of religious beliefs,and the gods that inspired them. The advent of printing and greater easeof pilgrimage brought tales and images of the gods to far-flung audiences.Through some combination of popular devotion, hieratic patronage, andimperial canonization local gods could gain new constituencies, tran-scending their original cults and entering the mainstream of religious cul-ture. In a very few cases (Guandi and Tianhou being the most notableexamples), a cult figure that originated as a local tutelary spirit could riseto the most exalted ranks of the imperial pantheon and achieve univer-sal recognition. Yet even in these cases, in which imperial honors werewrapped in dense layers of official propaganda dictating the manner andmeaning of worship, the hierarchs of orthodoxy failed to impose uni-formity on Chinese religion. Prasenjit Duara has drawn attention to theways in which myth and cultural symbols (to which we can also add litur-gical action) are simultaneously continuous and discontinuous. Differ-ent groups, from village communities to the imperial state, inscribe theirown interpretations on cultural symbols and practices, widening their“interpretive arena” and redefining their meaning. Duara describes thelayering of interpretation that accumulates over time as a process of “su-perscription.” In Duara’s view, superscription creates not a hegemonicdiscourse, but rather the means by which different groups can draw upona common cultural vocabulary to articulate their own distinctive world-views without necessarily challenging or undermining the validity of otherinterpretations.5Paul Katz has modified Duara’s analysis by suggestingas an alternative to superscription “cogeneration,” which emphasizes notthe layering of myth and interpretation over time but the dynamic processby which meanings are simultaneously created at different levels of a cultand instantiated in worship and liturgy.6The diversity of symbolic mean-ings attached to Wutong in all of the deity’s manifestations—in state re-ligion, hieratic myth and liturgy, and popular devotion—is a signal ex-ample of this dynamic aspect of cult, and the range of meanings attachedto deities and their cults.The complex history of the Wutong cult illustrates the flexibility ofConclusion261"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"vernacular interpretations of the divine realm within Chinese religiousculture. Particularly striking is the moral ambiguity of divine beings. Bless-ings and misfortune issue from common sources, and the powers wieldedby divine beings can be used for both good and evil. Many preeminentgods of impeccable virtue originated as demons who were forcibly con-verted to the side of good. Conversion of demons was an abiding themeof Buddhist mythology (typified perhaps most dramatically by the leg-end of Hariti, the prolific mother who ate her young), but it also becamea central theme of Daoist theology, as the apotheosis of Zhenwu, as wellas that of Wuxian, attests. This process of conversion can likewise beseen in the transformation of Zhao Gongming from plague demon torighteous demonifuge, and his later transfigurations into chief of the FiveEmissaries of Plague, who inflict epidemics upon mortals as punishmentfor their sins, and into the Martial God of Wealth. Not all demons andghosts are tamed and transformed, however. The shanxiaogoblins, forexample, remained resolutely alien, denizens of the margins of civiliza-tion who wrought havoc and mischief in their interactions with humanbeings.The diabolical character of Wutong was rooted in the shanxiao lorealready widely diffused throughout southeastern China by the beginningof the Song dynasty. In contrast to other cults established in this age, theWutong cult originated not in veneration of the dead nor in ecclesiastictheology, but rather in fears and anxieties about the dimly perceived yetpalpably sinister worlds of foreign lands, wilderness forests, and noc-turnal commotion. The transformation of Wutong into a Buddhist saintwho delivered the inhabitants of Wuyuan county from epidemic in thetenth century was a crucial episode in the metamorphosis of this mali-cious imp into an honored god. In Wuyuan and elsewhere in Jiangdong,where local communities fought bitterly to lay claim to this benevolentWutong as their own, the god was embraced as a tudideity despite thelack of any personal or historical connection to these constituencies. Im-perial validation of Wuyuan’s Wutong cult no doubt whetted popularfaith in the god’s miraculous powers, and Wuyuan’s emergence as oneof the major pilgrimage destinations of Southern Song China ensured thatits reputation would filter down to distant provinces. Buddhist and Daoistclergy were quick to take measure of the god’s popularity and incorpo-rate worship of Wutong into their own religious practice, at the sametime refashioning the god into avatars of Buddhist grace and Daoistvirtue.Yet despite manifold efforts on the part of the state and the clergy to262Conclusion"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"convert Wutong into a more salubrious deity, the demonic aspects of Wu-tong endured. Indeed, with the emergence of Wutong as the reigning godof wealth in Jiangnan in the late Ming, the demonic qualities of the god,his insatiable lust and greed, became more prominent than ever. In ad-dition to the regal and magnanimous Wuxian enshrined in great templesin Hangzhou, Suzhou, and other cities, the unregenerate Wutong per-sisted in the ubiquitous small shrines scattered throughout the narrowlanes of the towns and across the rural landscape, and indeed in the al-coves of innumerable homes. This Wutong was the province of the wuspirit mediums. Especially prominent among these mediums were womenwho had fallen prey to Wutong in the guise of an irresistible incubus,and thus obtained the privileged access conferred by sexual intimacy. Likethe fashi,these mediums served private clients, not the community as awhole. Yet the wumediums did not presume the superior authority offashiconducting judicial inquests to expunge wayward demons. Insteadthey approached the god as humble supplicants, surrendering to hissuzerainty while seeking to curry his favor.The diabolical character of Wutong illustrates the fear and trepida-tion ordinary people felt before the gods. The notion of divine retribu-tion for mortal sin thoroughly permeated religious culture of the impe-rial era, and religious practice above all was devoted to the expiation ofsin and relief from postmortem punishment, for oneself and for one’sancestors. In addition, the mundane world was populated by countlessevil spirits, and the gods themselves employed legions of demon-soldiersto carry out the punishments they ordained. Popular healers and medi-ums offered a multitude of mantic therapies for exorcising demonicforces, appeasing disgruntled ancestors, and gaining the succor and sup-port of the gods. Yet transactions with the divine realm remained fraughtwith uncertainty. The Wutong cult arose as much from fear of the god’swrath and malice as from the hope of securing its aid.The Wutong cult also demonstrates the primacy of the eudaemonis-tic regime of sacrifice and exorcism in Chinese vernacular religion. Cul-tic lore repeatedly emphasized that obtaining the god’s aid depended noton personal moral behavior, but rather on diligent devotion in the formsof sacrifice and ritual offerings. Despite encouragement by the state, thepatrician Confucian elite, and the higher levels of the ecclesiastic estab-lishment, notions of a cosmic moral equilibrium governed by righteouscelestial gods did not alter the fundamentally eudaemonistic characterof humane relations with the divine realm. By the late Ming, the moralequilibrium orientation had achieved dominance in the urban print cul-Conclusion263"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"ture of Jiangnan. This orientation thoroughly permeated vernacular lit-erature of the late Ming and Qing, most strikingly in literary masterpieceslike the novels Journey to the West and Golden Lotusand Feng Meng-long’s fiction, but also in “morality books,” didactic religious literaturesuch as the “precious scrolls,” and sundry literature produced bycommercial publishers for entertainment as well as edification, of whichJourney to the Southand its tale of Huaguang’s exploits is wholly rep-resentative. Not until the eighteenth century do these ideas of moral equi-librium and retribution become ascendant in the middlebrow religiousculture of the cities, however. In rural religious life, the eudaemonisticorientation continued to prevail down to 1949.Yet the “ideologized” (in Weller’s sense of the word) transfigurationsof Wutong like Wuxian, Marshal Ma, and Huaguang, stamped with theseals of official and ecclesiastic orthodoxy, still exerted significantinfluence on vernacular religion. The ideologized versions of Wutong, likethe god’s demonic images, were propagated and reproduced through thedissemination of temples, icons, ritual texts, and folklore. Indeed, the Wu-tong cult and its many personae ramified into a multiplicity of local cults,each with its own distinct history and culture. Fiendish rogue, powerfuldemonifuge, merciful bodhisattva, trickster god of wealth: the roles per-formed by Wutong fully demonstrate the multivalence of divine powerin Chinese religious culture, and the inadequacy of apprehending this re-ligious culture through any neat taxonomy of the divine beings who ruledit. The meaning of the Wutong cult, and the devotion it elicited, can onlybe grasped by examining the local social and cultural contexts it inhab-ited. Needless to say, the same holds true for other cults, perhaps evenmore so for those, like Guandi and Guanyin, that were carried to everycorner of the empire.China’s religious culture thus did not simply mirror the social orderand its essential values. Yet religious beliefs and practices were integralto the consolidation, reproduction, and transformation of social rela-tionships. Certain structures of Chinese religion exhibit considerable sta-bility over long periods of time. For example, the conception of the di-vine pantheon and its hierarchical order and the repertoire of rituals usedin communicating with the gods that emerged during the Song trans-formation of Chinese religion endured down to the twentieth century.Yet the stability of such structures—what we might conceive as the “in-terpretive arena” (to use Duara’s language) of Chinese religion—maskssignificant change in actual religious practice, and constant mutation ofmeaning as social and economic relations evolved.264Conclusion"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"The conception of the divine realm in Chinese vernacular religion wasvery much a product of active effort by ordinary people to make senseof, and gain control over, their lives.

Art his-torians generally reject any iconographic interpretation of the taotie,preferringto study it strictly in formal terms. See, for example, Bagley 1987, 1993. Kesner1991 tries to reconcile the two positions, rejecting iconographic interpretationwhile emphasizing the religious significance of the taotiemotif. But Kesner’s claimthat the taotieserved as a generic expression of the social and political domi-nance of the Shang ruling class is too vague to do justice to the unique qualitiesof this motif. Moreover, Kesner’s acknowledgment that the meaning of Shangbronzes inhered not in their symbolic value as markers of status (as was the casein the late Zhou) but rather in their actual use in sacrifices would seem to un-dercut his argument about the purely symbolic dimension of Shang iconographyand instead favor a literal (i.e., iconic) interpretation of bronze decoration. Acompelling argument in favor of an iconic interpretation of the taotie has recentlybeen advanced by Elizabeth Childs-Johnson (1998). Childs-Johnson argues thatShang taotieiconography is derived from four principal species of wild animals(tigers, buffalo, deer, and bighorn sheep) that were objects of both royal huntsand sacrificial offerings. Furthermore, she proposes that the taotieserved as asignifier of metamorphosis, symbolizing the power wielded by human priests (theShang king above all) to invoke the ancestral spirits by donning animal masksduring the performance of sacrifice.9.

Thecharter myth of the succeeding dynasty, Zhou, justified the Zhou usurpation ofShang rule precisely on the grounds of the Shang kings’ blasphemous claims ofgodhood.12.

Chinese scholars have tended to see more or less con-tinuity between Liangzhu and Shang iconographic styles. See Li Xueqin 1993;Wu Hung 1995: 28–44. But Kesner (1991: 49–50) observes that the stylistic id-iom of the Liangzhu jades had been lost by the time of the earliest Shang bronzevessels, which in any case display imagery far cruder than that of the Liangzhujades. He argues that even if Shang bronzes reflect stylistic echoes of the olderLiangzhu culture, the religious import of the Liangzhu iconography would haveceased to have any meaning for the Shang. Childs-Johnson (1998: 19–20), incontrast, argues that the animal-mask headdress iconography of Liangzhu andLongshan jade carvings and the taotiemotif in Shang bronzes indicate continu-ity not only in representation but also in religious belief. Keightley (1998: 786–88,796–97) notes that in contrast to Liangzhu mortuary practice jades occupied onlya modest place among Shang grave goods, but this shift may not be too significantgiven the radical change in ritual technologies that accompanied the emergenceof bronze metalworking.16. Chang 1980: 33–34, 192–93.17. Chang 1983: 54. Other nobles also performed the binritual to convenewith their departed ancestors. Chang likens the binceremony to a form ofshamanic transport, in which the king enters a trance and visits the ancestralrealm. Keightley (1998), who denies that the Shang kings engaged in any formof “shamanic” ecstasy or spirit journeys, argues that the binritual did not en-tail a spirit journey on the part of the king; instead, the king “hosted” his an-cestors, who came to him. Whichever interpretation is correct, it is clear that theking (or lineage head) personally performed the ritual, and that his presence wasindispensable to it.18. The exact date of the Zhou conquest of Shang has long been debated.The date of 1045 b.c.e.adduced here follows the painstaking analysis of Shaugh-nessy 1991: 217–35. In any event, most scholars now favor a mid-eleventh-century date over the traditional date of 1127 b.c.e.19. Von Falkenhausen 1993: 152–61; Rawson 1999a: 364–68.20. Of course, the Shang oracle bones and the inscriptions on Shang and Zhoubronzes are the most ancient literary records of Chinese civilization, but the or-acle bones were unknown to later Chinese until the advent of modern archaeol-ogy, and the bronze inscriptions were never accorded recognition as literaryworks. Confucius’s (551–479 b.c.e.) reverence for the Odesand Documentsat-tests to their sacred stature among the Zhou nobility.21. On the role of Tian in the ideological consolidation of the Zhou politi-cal order, see Eno 1990a: 19–27; Creel 1970: 93–100.22. It has long been thought that the moral character of Tian in contrast tothe amorality of Di—best exemplified by the early sections of the foundationaltext of the Zhou, the Shang shu (Documents)—was already manifest at the timeof the Zhou conquest of Shang. Recent research instead suggests that the reli-gious culture of predynastic and early dynastic Zhou differed little from that ofShang, and that the new conception of Tian described here emerged only a cen-tury or so after the establishment of the Zhou dynasty, at a time when royal au-Notes to Pages 25–27273"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"thority was subjected to challenge. See Eno 1990a; Shaughnessy 1991: 185; Poo1998: 30. More recently, Shaughnessy has argued that the idea that the Zhousucceeded to the Mandate of Heaven was already present in debates about theconstitution of royal authority that took place immediately after the foundingof Zhou. See Shaughnessy 1999: 310–17.23. On these themes of world ordering, see Bodde 1961; Birrell 1993; Loewe1982; Lewis 1990: 165.24. Creel (1970: 370–72) expressed doubts about whether the Sheceremonywas integrated into the Western Zhou investiture ceremony. But Kominami (1987)argues that the Soil Altar and the Sheceremony performed a crucial role in link-ing the Zhou vassals to the sovereign heritage of the Zhou royal house. In hisview, the Sheritual of Zhou grew out of the earlier totemic religion of tribal cul-tures in which the altar (in the form of a stone, a tree, or a raised earthen plat-form) represented the union of heaven and earth and by extension the divine sanc-tion accorded to Zhou suzerainty. As the Zhou kingdom expanded beyond theconfines of its original territory, the Soil Altar provided the material link betweenthe reigning king and the homeland of his ancestors. The clod of earth placed atthe Soil Altars of the Zhou vassals thus expressed the subordination of the vas-sal to the Zhou king while reinforcing the ties binding the vassals to Heaven’sMandate.25.ZZ,10.179a (Lord Zhuang, 28th year). See Wheatley 1971: 174.26. Von Falkenhausen 1994: 1–5. For the ritual context of Zhou bronzes,see also von Falkenhausen 1993: 146–52.27. The crisis in royal authority precipitated by military defeats at the handsof foreign invaders is believed to have begun during the reign of King Mu (r.956–918 b.c.e.). In response, King Mu instituted a more centralized and bu-reaucratic form of government in an effort to buttress royal power, but his re-forms apparently did not check the continuing erosion of the Zhou’s commandover even its own vassals. See Shaughnessy 1999: 323–31.28. The archaeological record attests to a dramatic change in ritual regalia,especially bronze ritual vessels, in the early ninth century b.c.e.that marked acomplete rupture from the ritual traditions inherited from the Shang. See Raw-son 1999a; von Falkenhausen 1999. Shaughnessy (1999: 331–32) connects this“Ritual Revolution” to the political reforms of King Mu, though Rawson(1999a: 360, 434) places the Ritual Revolution somewhat later, in the first halfof the ninth century b.c.e.The precise religious significance of the ritual reformshas yet to be spelled out. The changes in ritual regalia attest to greater stan-dardization, an emphasis on formal hierarchy of rank, and codification of ritualpractice. Ironically, then, even as Zhou royal authority suffered serious decline,ritual uniformity and homogenization of elite culture, suggesting a common setof political and religious values, seems to have proliferated within the Zhou ec-umene.

YetSima Qian’s claim that the Qin rulers already in the fifth century b.c.e.wor-shiped Huangdi and the Fiery Thearch, presumably as paired gods of rain andsun, should not be dismissed out of hand. As in the case of the Queen Motherof the West, it is probable that there were regional variations in the myths re-lated to Huangdi.56.

Henri Maspero applied the term euhemerization to Chinese religion inthe opposite sense, denoting the transformation of gods into historical humanfigures. See Maspero 1924: 1–2. Most scholars have followed Maspero’s lead;certainly this “reverse euhemerism,” to use William Boltz’s more accurate phrase,was a pervasive feature of Chinese mythology in Warring States and Han times.As Boltz (1981: 142) puts it, “if the Greeks can be said to have mythologizedtheir history, the Chinese historicized their mythology.” See also Bodde 1961:372–76.67.

Although Wu Hung (1988, 1995: 110–12) emphasizes the functional dis-juncture (as well as the physical distance) between the tomb and the ancestraltemple in Shang and Western Zhou religion, von Falkenhausen (1994: 3–4) ar-gues that there is no appreciable difference in the inventories of bronze ritualvessels found at tombs and temples, suggesting that sacrifices may well have beenoffered at tombs as well as at temples. Kominami (1994: 11–17) believes thatsacrifices at tombs in Shang times were limited to quelling the spirits of power-ful (and thus potentially dangerous) persons of high social rank; these rituals thuswere more in the nature of exorcisms than sacrifices.

Little is known about this Yellow God, or theunderworld under his dominion, but it is assumed that “Yellow God” was sim-ply another name for Huangdi.

Other lexicographers of this era identified the wan-gliangas “mountain spirits” and wangxiangas “water spirits.” See Kiang 1937:72–99. It is likely, as William Boltz observes, that wangliang, wangxiang,andother similar names for demonic spirits (e.g., fangliang,fangxiang,and fenyang)are all cognates of a common word rendered in ancient Chinese as “BLjang-BZ-jang.” See William Boltz 1979: 432–33.5.ZZ,21.368a–b (Lord Xuan, 3rd year).

This organizing principle, expressed most cogently in the Dialogues of theStates(Guoyu,“Zhouyu shang”) and the “Tribute of Yu” (“Yugong”) chapterof the Documents,was also applied in works like the Classic of Spirits and Prodi-gies (Shenyijing), probably dating from the late second century c.e., and theRecords of the Ten Continents (Shizhouji;ca. 300). See Campany 1996b: 43–45,53–54, 102–26.10. Although such human-beast hybrids had a long history in China, datingback to the myths and iconography of Shang-Zhou religion, by Han times theirmeaning had changed. In contrast to the totemic figures of Shang, which enabledhuman rulers to communicate with the gods through divination and oracle, inlater times hybrid creatures were typically seen as malefic beings that menacedhumans.

Kleeman (1994c: 231n35) observes that jingoriginally referred to the en-ergy imparted by food to the body. The compound term jingqi,rendered here as“numinous specters,” refers to formless vitalities that can inhere in concrete ob-jects. The meaning of jingqiin demonology is entirely different than in the home-opathic medical canon that crystallized over the course of the Han dynasty. In amedical context jingqidenoted sublime distillations of particular qualities. Forexample, the sun (pure yang) constituted the jingqiof fire, and the moon (pureyin) constituted the jingqiof water. See Unschuld 1985: 110.19.SSJ,19.148 (no. 445). The prevalence of this belief is attested by the Handynasty skeptical philosopher Wang Chong (27–ca. 100 c.e.): “There are thosewho say that demons are the spirits of aged things and that these spirits can as-sume human form. It is also said that there are creatures who by nature can spon-taneously metamorphose without growing old and assume humanlike form.” SeeLH,22B.450.20.SSJ,6.41 (no. 102).21.SSJ,12.93 (no. 309).22.SSJ,12.91 (no. 303), reprinted in Baize tu,1a.23. See Analects,VII.21: “The topics of which the Master did not speak wereprodigies [guai], feats of strength, disorders, and spirits [shen].”24.Guoyu,“Luyu xia,” 5.68–69. A slightly different taxonomy of anom-alies appears in the second-century b.c.e.Treatises of Huainan,in a passage ridi-culing the popular belief that such unfamiliar creatures are manifestations of de-monic spirits: “Mountains produce xiaoyang;waters produce wangxiang;wellsproduce fenyanga(literally, ‘grave mound sheep’). People who regard them asaberrations have limited experience and shallow knowledge of things.” See HNZ,13.458. The association made between wells and the fenyangain this passage un-doubtedly stems from the anecdote about Confucius in the Dialogues of the States.(On the identification of xiaoyang,see below, pp. 90–91.) The Zhuangziconfirmsat least some of these identifications, in a speech by Guan Zhong to his prince,Lord Huan of Qi: “In the waters dwell wangxiang;in the hills, shena;in the moun-tains, kui;in the wildernesses, panghuang;and in the marshes, weishe.” SeeZhuangzi jiaoquan,19, “Dasheng,” 2.694.25. Most later renditions of this passage, and paraphrases like the passagefrom the Treatises of Huainancited in the previous note, use a different graphfor fenthat means “grave mound” (fenyanga), thus reinforcing the rationality ofConfucius’s explanation for the presence of an entombed sheep. See HNZ,13.458; Bowu zhi,1.3a.26.ZZ,41.706b (Lord Zhao, 1st year).27. Kleeman 1994c: 226–31.28. “Blood-eating ghosts” referred to spirits who must be propitiated with“blood” (i.e., meat) sacrifices. It was believed that “proper deities” partook onlyof vegetarian offerings, and “bloody sacrifice” became a metaphor for deviantspirits and heterodox worship. On the practice of “blood sacrifice” and prohi-bitions against it, see Kleeman 1994b.29.BPZ,4.76.30.BPZ,17.273–82.

For a detailed study of the complex textual history of the Album of theTrue Forms of the Five Marchmounts,see Inoue 1926. Inoue argues persuasivelythat the text entitled Dongxuan lingbao wuyue guben zhenxing tupreserved inthe Daoist Canonis the oldest extant version. Inscriptions and pictorial repre-sentations from Mount Tai dating from the fourteenth century onward bearingthe title Album of the True Forms of the Five Marchmountshave been studiedin Chavannes 1910: 415–26. But as Inoue shows, these depictions, which differmarkedly from those in Dongxuan lingbao wuyue guben zhenxing tu,derive froma later, post-Tang development of the cult. According to the apocryphal prefaceof the Daoist Canontext, attributed to the Han thaumaturge Dongfang Shuo (fl.130), Huangdi personally drew the images of the mountains transmitted to latergenerations as the Album of the True Forms of the Five Marchmounts.See Dong-xuan lingbao wuyue guben zhenxing tu,2a. A virtually identical account of theorigins of the text is contained in Xuanyuan benji,a hagiography of Huangdi.See Yunji qiqian,100.22b.33.BPZ,19.309. In another place Ge Hong referred to “the techniques ofthe Writs of the Three Sovereignsfor summoning celestial deities and telluric spir-its.” See BPZ,4.61. Inoue (1926: 80–81) speculates that the Writs of the ThreeSovereignsand the Album of the True Forms of the Five Marchmountswere orig-inally a single text, the latter consisting simply of illustrations appended to theformer. For the most authoritative study of the Writs of the Three Sovereigns,see Ñfuchi 1964.34.BPZ,17.282.35.BPZ,19.306.36. See Gao Guofan 1989: 361–66. Gao discounts the idea that the Dun-huang manuscript (Baize jingguai tu)might be identical to the Baize tutext inGe Hong’s possession; instead, he thinks that the Dunhuang manuscript was de-rived from older demon lore found in texts like Ge’s The Master Who EmbracesSimplicity.Gao also notes that the passage on the nightmare demon Boqi in theAlbum of the Strange Specters of White Marshis nearly identical to the descrip-tion of Boqi in the third-century b.c.e.“spellbinding” text excavated at Shui-hudi (ibid., 354–61).

In addition, one therapy requires that the con-jurer first chant, “The Thearch possesses the five weapons. You, begone! If youdo not go, I will spew knives to coat you.” Then he spits on the afflicted portionof the body seven times (fourteen times in the case of women) to drive out thedemon. Here, the “five weapons” refer to magical demonifugic weapons like thosewielded by Chiyou. See ibid., 294 (Recipe 234). The Recipes for Fifty-Two Ail-mentsalso advises using menstrual blood in two of five recipes for warding offgusickness; in another recipe for gusickness, a talisman is burned, immersed inwater, and then drunk by the patient. Ibid., 300–302. The use of talismans thatare burned and immersed in water later was central to the ritual healing prac-ticed by the Great Peace religious sect (see below). On spitting as part of heal-ing therapy in later Daoist ritual, see Strickmann 2002: 29–31, 106–7.45. Miyashita 1959: 229.46. The gangmaoamulets were worn in pairs, hung from silk ribbons thatpassed through a hole bored lengthwise in the amulet. Sumptuary laws dictatedthe material from which the gangmaowere made, but virtually all surviving spec-imens are jade. The inscriptions on specimens like those shown in figure 15 cor-respond almost exactly to the ritual formulas preserved in Han records. See Hanshu,99B.4109–10; Hou Han shu,30.3673.

Han legends record that Shenshu and Yulü were powerful spirits whobound evil demons with magic cords and fed them to tigers (hence the associa-tion of tigers with the devouring of demons). See, for example, LH,65, “Ding-gui,” 22.452. On the role of these two spirits as household guardians, see Bodde1974: 127–38; Fong 1989.50.LH,65, “Dinggui,” 22.448.

Ironically, the word fei,which Wang Chong uses here as a generic termfor vermin, also denoted a certain kind of baleful demon. According to the Clas-sic of the Mountains and Seas,the feiwas an oxlike beast with a serpent’s tailthat causes waters to dry up and plants to wither; its appearance augured theimminent arrival of a great plague. See SHJ,4.100.53.LH,72, “Biansui,” 24.488–89.54.LH,66, “Duyan,” 23.457–58.55.LH,75, “Jiechu,” 25.505.56.

Although confession was a fundamentalpractice in both sects, the Celestial Masters did not use spells and consecratedwater in healing as the Great Peace sect did. See Fukui 1952: 88.58. Kaltenmark 1979: 45. The present text of the Canon of Great Peacedatesfrom around the sixth century. There is considerable debate about the relation-ship of this text to works of the same title, now lost, that circulated among theearly Daoist sects (see ibid. and appended discussion). Nonetheless, a recent studyconcludes that “the arguments in favour of a Han date for the (extant text) out-weigh the arguments against it.” Beck 1980: 171. However, we cannot be surethat the extant text was utilized by the Celestial Masters in Han times, thoughthere certainly is much evidence that both drew from a common fund of reli-gious and messianic beliefs.59.BPZ,6.114.60. Ge Hong also describes the Lord of the Hearth (Zaojun; also known asthe Stove God) as a watch-guard spirit who made reports on the conduct ofthe household’s members to Heaven on the final day of each month. But in theesoteric lore of the Han dynasty, the Lord of the Hearth was reviled as a ma-lign entity that brought disease and death down upon the family. See Chard1995: 5–6. This is yet another example of a noxious demon that is bridled bythe forces of moral order and assigned a menial role in the vast edifice of thecelestial bureaucracy.61. In addition to the demon masters, the text also lists plague demons (wen-gui)of individual months, days, and hours, plus a group of nine gu(as in gupoison) demons, who act at the instruction of the demon masters and inflict ill-nesses on those who fail to observe the sect’s commandments.

The earliest temple explicitlydedicated to Wen Qiong was founded in Pingyang county, inland from the pre-fectural capital of Wenzhou, in 1210. A Wen Qiong temple was founded at thecapital of Hangzhou in 1264, but the city of Wenzhou did not have a temple un-til the second decade of the fourteenth century. Nonetheless, the cult seems tohave been well established before it began to be housed in its own independenttemples.94. Katz 1995: 104–6.95. Ibid., 106–14.96. Cf.

Kitada (1996: 114) interprets guixingas de-noting the ghosts of the dead, but I believe the term simply means a macabreimage.95. Kitada 1996: 114–15, 124–27.96. In a series of articles, Kanai Noriyuki (1979, 1980, 1982, 1985) has ad-vanced the argument that the Song period witnessed a dramatic transformationin the character of tudicults. According to Kanai, prior to the Song, rural reli-gion centered on rites of propitiation and thanksgiving addressed to nature deities,collectively represented by the shealtar. In his view, the sherites exclusive toeach village promoted communal solidarity and militated against social differ-entiation. In the Song, however, the sheatrophied with the rise of the new tudi296Notes to Pages 161–165"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"cults whose anthropomorphic gods became identified with local landowning andmerchant elites. Kanai concludes that the tudicults of the Song thus fostered so-cial stratification and elite control of rural society. Yet Kanai’s idyllic portrayalof egalitarian village communities in the pre-Song period and his dour view ofSong tudicults as tools of social subordination suffer from conceptual rigidityand serious misreadings of evidence. Most problematically, he reads tudias auniform category at any given point in time and thus fails to recognize the di-verse range of deities to whom the designation tudiwas applied. For pertinentcritiques of Kanai’s work on both methodological and empirical grounds, seeHamashima 1990b; Matsumoto 1993, 1999.97. Schipper 1985b. See also Akizuki 1978.98. On this point see Kitada 1996, who also categorically rejects the viewthat the nascent tudicults of the Era of Disunion derived from the ancient sherites (ibid., 128).99. Zhou Chu’s career (but not his fantastic exploits) were recorded in a me-morial stele composed by Lu Yun. See Lu Yun, “Jin Pingxi jiangjun xiaohou ZhouChu bei,” Lu Shiheng ji,10.68–70. The earliest documentation of a cult centeredon Zhou Chu is Xu Kai (early tenth century), “Yixing Zhou jiangjun miao ji,”in [Xianchun] Piling zhi(1268), 21.1a–3b.100. Hu Jing, “Yingliewang miaoqian ji” (1149), in Jiangsu jinshi zhi,11.38b–40b; Liu Zai, “Yixing fu Zhou xiaogong yingzhao ji” (1223), in [Xian-chun] Piling zhi,21.14a–16a. Zhou had received the posthumous honorary ti-tle “filial vassal” from the Jin court, but Liu Zai was the first to use the title “filiallord” in relation to his cult.101. “Chongxiu Yingliemiao ji,” in Jiangsu jinshi zhi,13.1a–3b; “Yingliemiaozhitian tanyue timing ji,” in ibid., 15.22a–26a. Additional Song epigraphic ma-terial regarding the Filial Lord Zhou cult, much of it unfortunately illegible, canbe found in Beijing tushuguan 1990, 40: 64; 43: 107; 43: 111; 44: 78.102. The cult of Filial Lord Zhou in Yixing apparently encouraged imitationin adjacent regions. In Changshu county, across Lake Tai from Yixing, a differ-ent Zhou (this one a Changshu native) was also canonized as Filial Lord Zhou.Ming sources claim that Changshu’s Filial Lord Zhou cult originated in the thir-teenth century. Hamashima Atsutoshi (2001: 47–52) expresses skepticism aboutthese claims and asserts that the Changshu cult was invented in the late Yuan. Inmy view, the precise details and dating of miracles ascribed to Changshu’s FilialLord Zhou in Ming records suggest that the cult did indeed originate in the Song.Filial Lord Zhou cults also developed in other parts of Suzhou prefecture in Ming-Qing times.103. “Si Xianying miaoe shangshusheng die” (1209), in Changxing xianzhi(1875), 30A.44a–45b.

Yuan inscriptions emphasize, in addition to protection of seafarers, thegod’s curative powers: incense ashes, candle wax, and even tree leaves from SireLi’s shrine were used to cure fevers, suppurations, ulcers, and dysentery. Yuansources also state that the god, much like a terrestrial magistrate, seized and pros-ecuted criminals. See the inscriptions cited in Chang Zhao hezhi gao(1904),15.24b–25b, 45.10a–b.107. This is one of the major themes of Hansen 1990.108.Changshu xianzhi (1539), 3.69b.

Another example of the restricted range of local cults was Prince Ming(Mingwang), fourteenth son of the Tang emperor Taizong and once prefect ofSuzhou. Prince Ming’s cult was confined to the single Suzhou county of Wujiang,which boasted twelve of his temples in the late Northern Song, but failed to at-tract adherents elsewhere in the prefecture.

The significance of Dongyue temples as the central ritual site in markettowns has been noted by Kanai Noriyuki (1987).

Zhu Yu, in a book published in 1119, reported thatwhen deformed infants (he speaks of “demonic forms”) are put to death, theirspirits will return to the mother and seek to nurse, thus causing the mother’s sick-ness and death. Such spirits were referred to as hanba,an ancient term for adrought demon. See Pingzhou ketan,3.58.4. Nakamura Jihei (1980: 15, 1982: 64) has suggested that the congcirep-resented a new type of shrine founded by pioneer settlers who immigrated tosouth China during the late Tang and Song. In his view, the congciembodied val-ues of local identity and community welfare in these newly settled regions, andas such they were the incubators of the tuditutelary spirit cults of the late im-perial era. Nakamura also notes that the congciwere closely associated with fe-male mediums (wu). Other scholars have accepted Nakamura’s assertion thatthe congcirepresent a new stage in the formation of tudicults (see Kanai 1982:353–54; Davis 2001: 12–13), but I have not seen any evidence that connectscongcito newly settled villages. Indeed, use of the term congciwas largely re-stricted to the Jiangdong region and rarely employed in the areas of substantialnew settlement and high population growth in the Song (Jiangnan, Fujian, andJiangxi). In my view Nakamura’s hypothesis is untenable, and congcimore likelyhad developed since the Era of Disunion in connection with the shanxiaocultsof south China. Extrapolating from Nakamura’s hypothesis, Davis (2001:12–13, 214) argues that village spirit mediums exercised proprietary control overthe congcishrines, which became a bulwark of community solidarity against the300Notes to Pages 178–182"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"outside world.

See Huizhou fuzhi(1502), 5.32a–b. Another source suggests that Wuyuan’sWutong cult had an even more venerable pedigree. According to a Ming gazetteer,in 503 five brothers from Wuyuan, recently deceased, were believed to havewarded off a plague afflicting Huangyan county in Zhejiang. The Liang court302Notes to Pages 186–189"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"subsequently invested the five as the Five Sagely Divine Agents of Manifest Re-sponse (Wusheng yingxian lingguan), a title that prefigures later ones accordedto Wutong. See Huangyan xianzhi(1579), 7.8b–9a. Nonetheless, this text is al-most certainly spurious, since there are numerous discrepancies between theHuangyan cult and that of Wuyuan (e.g., concerning the surname of the broth-ers, temple names, and imperial titles). Moreover, the temple identified in thisgazetteer is not associated with Wutong in an earlier Song gazetteer, even thoughmany Wutong temples existed in this prefecture in Song times ([Jiading] Chichengzhi,31.7b, 15b). The Huangyan legend probably reflects a conflation of an olderlocal cult with the flourishing Wuxian cult of late Song or (more likely) post-Song times.33.Huizhou fuzhi(1502), 5.42b.

Since Hong Mai was a native of Poyangcounty, which like Dexing was part of Raozhou prefecture, he may have beenpartial to the claims of his fellow countrymen.40. The competition between Dexing and Wuyuan is also mentioned by thecompiler of a Wuyuan gazetteer, the Xingyuan zhi(1269), cited in SSGJ,qianji,26a–b. By the end of the Song Wuyuan was universally regarded as the originalhome of the Wuxian cult. See, for examples, Zhu Mu, Fangyu shenglan,16.6b;Wu Zimu, Mengliang lu,14.253. In the early Ming, Wuyuan’s claim was alsoendorsed by no less an authority than Zhang Yuchu (1361–1410), the forty-thirdpatriarch of the Celestial Masters lineage. But Zhang’s partisanship is fully evi-dent in his brusque dismissal of claims by his Buddhist rivals that the Wuxiandeities had first made an appearance before Daorong at the Yunjusi Monastery.See Zhang Yuchu, “Shangqingshi Wutongmiao tiyuan shu,” Xianquan ji,4.60a–b.41.

Images of Wutong manufactured at the god’s “ancestral home” ofWuyuan played a crucial role in demonstrating the legitimate affiliation of branchtemples.

The Huaguang pavilion at the RongguosiMonastery was built in 1270. See [Xianchun] Lin’an zhi(ca. 1274), 73.14a. Oneof Wujiang’s most prestigious Buddhist monasteries added a Huaguang pavilionin 1283, and the magnificent Wuxian temple in the city of Wujiang included aHuaguang pavilion at the time of its reconstruction in 1385. See Wujiang xi-anzhi(1488), 7.23a; Wujiang xianzhi(1747), 11.53b. A Huaguang pavilion ofunspecified date was also attached to the Wuxian shrine in Changzhou by 1268at the latest. See [Xianchun] Piling zhi(1268), 14.5b. When a group of sixty-four notables in Jurong (Jiangning) collected tens of thousands of taels throughpublic subscription to refurbish the city’s Wuxian temple in 1434, a Huaguangpavilion was built in addition to the main hall. See Zhang Ning, Fangzhou ji,18.7b–8a.56.Xianchuang guayi zhi,2. Zhu Yunming also described Wuxian as “theone whom Buddhist scriptures refer to as a transformation of the BodhisattvaFlowery Light.” See Zhushi jilüe,30.3b.57.YJZ,sanzhisi, 10.1378–79.58. Wuxian’s feast day is given as 9/28 in Zhu Mu, Fangyu shenglan,16.6b;Li Yiji, Yueling caike(1619), 3.39b; and Zhushen shengdanri yuxia ji,4b; but(erroneously) as 9/29 in Mengliang lu,19.299; the feast day of Huaguang is givenas 9/28 in Wucheng xianzhi(1638), 4.28b.

See Gu Rubao, “Wanshouci ji,” Wu xian-zhi(1642) 21.19b. Huang Gongshao (1265 jinshi), who gave up public life andbecame a lay Buddhist postulant after the Mongol conquest, observed that “as-semblies to honor the Buddha” (qingfohui)were held at the Wutong temple inhis native Shaowu (Fujian). See Huang Gongshao, “Wutongmiao jieyue bang,”Zaixuan ji,29a–30a. A fairly detailed description of the assembly to honor theBuddha held on 4/8 in the city of Fuzhou (Fujian) from 1082 onwards has beenpreserved in [Chunxi] Sanshan zhi(1182), 40.8080. In the mid-twelfth centurythese assemblies were attended by more than sixteen thousand monks, nuns,Daoist priests, and laity. In 1168, with the city suffering from famine, the provin-cial governor seized the assembly’s assets, some three thousand taels, to providefor public relief. Subsequently the great public festival ceased. Private cult groupscontinued the tradition, though, attracting as many as several hundred worshipersto temples or homes of the faithful for several days of fasting and admonitorysermons.72.Renhe xianzhi(1687), 29.24b–25b.73.Huating xianzhi(1521), 3.3a.

Cedzich (1995: 163) asserts that the Wusheng were known and worshipedin Suzhou in the eleventh century, but I do not find her argument persuasive. Herevidence is the existence of a “Wusheng Tower” at the Yunyansi Monastery atTiger Hill, just outside the city. See Wujun tujing xuji,zhong.35. But there is noevidence to link this building to either Wutong or Wuxian, nor is there any men-tion of “Wusheng Towers” in connection with the cult. The title Wusheng canhave many meanings in Buddhist, Daoist, and Confucian mythology apart fromthis particular cult. Moreover, this monastery is not subsequently associated withthe Wutong or Wuxian cults.78.

This source clearlyconnects Fuzhou’s Wuxian temples with the Wuxian cult of Wuyuan, but it isnot clear whether this connection already existed in Song times.105.Fuzhou fuzhi(1613), 16.9b. The cult, however, was transmitted to Tai-wan by immigrants from Fuzhou. A number of Wuxian temples remain in present-day Taiwan, the largest of which, in Tainan, was founded during Koxinga’s oc-cupation of the island in the seventeenth century. In Taiwan Wuxian assumes theform of a plague god, specifically identified with immigrants from Fuzhou. SeeLiu Zhiwan 1983: 228; Lin Hengdao 1974: 38, 43.106. A local gazetteer of Funing, just to the north of Fuzhou, observed thatWuxian was also known by the names Wusheng and Huaguang, and that the de-ity’s feast day fell on 4/8. See Funing zhouzhi(1616), 4.9b–10a. Worship of Wu-xian (“colloquially known as Huaguang”) also persevered in Youxi, to the westof Fuzhou. See Youxi xianzhi(1636), 2.17a. Xie Zhaozhe (1567–1624), a na-tive of Fuzhou, reported in connection with an epidemic that broke out in theregion in 1590–91 that “whenever epidemic rages in our prefecture, every fam-ily is extremely diligent in their worship of Wusheng.” See Xie Zhaozhe, Wu zazu,15.386.107. Michael Szonyi (1997) argues that Fuzhou’s Five Emperors cult waswholly indigenous to Fujian and perhaps descended from a local Wutong cultindependent of Wuyuan’s Wuxian cult. Yet, given the strong presence of theWuxian/Huaguang cult not only in the Fujian interior but also in areas aroundFuzhou itself, I am inclined to believe that there was a genealogical connectionbetween Wuxian and the Five Emperors cult, as other scholars have argued (seeXu Xiaowang 1994: 81–91). Of course, the more important issue is the distinctivehistory of the Five Emperors cult, and in that respect I agree with Szonyi that theFive Emperors cult needs to be evaluated in terms of its role in local religiousculture, not as an offshoot of the Wuxian cult.108.

A Ming ritual manual recommends that devotees ofHuaguang/Wuxian should prepare a “thaumaturgical altar to the five gods” intheir homes, confess their sins, and invoke blessings through incantatoryprayers.

This cult centered on the figure of Zhou Que, a Hangzhou native whomade a pilgrimage to Wuyuan’s Wuxian shrine on 4/8 in 1211, but died, at agetwenty-four, while in Wuyuan. In 1235, the magistrate of Dexing (Wuyuan’sperennial rival in claiming the Wuxian cult) petitioned the court seeking investi-ture of Zhou in recognition of his aid in protecting the region from the rebellionthat broke out in the Wuyi Mountains in 1231, adding that Zhou’s spirit sub-sequently proved responsive to prayers for relief from plague and drought. Therequest was granted and Zhou was canonized in the same year. Subsequently,shrines were built in his honor both in Dexing and in Hangzhou, and Zhou’simage was also included among Wuxian’s retinue at the Wuyuan temple.

Lu’s antipathy for the Wutong cult is evident throughout hiswork. Later in life, according to an anecdote recorded by Feng Menglong, Luwas stricken by an illness that the diviner hired by his family identified as hav-ing been inflicted by Wutong. Lu scoffed at his family’s pleas that he visit theWutong temple across the street from his house and beseech the god for for-giveness. Instead, Lu invited the deity to strike him dead, vowing that if he stilllived after three days he would destroy the shrine. Lu did recover and carriedout his promise. Feng Menglong added that Lu’s family “to this day no longerworships Wutong,” though the anecdote itself betrays how deeply entrenchedthe Wutong cult was even within the literati.

Lu states that the suppression inChangshu was connected with the efforts of Ma Wensheng to elicit imperial en-dorsement for a campaign of extermination against “profane cults” (yinci). WhileMa did indeed ask for such an endorsement, his censure was directed specificallyagainst imperial patronage of the Zhenwu cult; he made no mention of Wutong.See Ma Wensheng, “Chenyan zhensu fengji biyi zhidao shi,” Duansu zouyi,3.11b–16b. At least some central government officials did take steps to eradi-cate Wutong/Wuxian as a deviant cult. In 1491 the president of the Board ofPunishments in Beijing ordered the removal of a Wuxian temple from theprecincts of the board’s administrative offices.

It is possible that the fournovels were already published together as The Four Journeysin the late Ming,but earliest extant editions of The Four Journeys date from the early nineteenthcentury.

Hansen (1990: 140–43) argues that merchants probably raised Wuxiantemples in the trading cities to which they traveled. The actual founders of Wu-tong and Wuxian temples mentioned in Song sources included monks, officials,prominent local lineages, and ordinary local inhabitants, but merchants are notsingled out as patrons of the cult. There is no direct evidence that merchants fromHuizhou played any role in the spread of branch temples affiliated with the an-cestral shrine at Wuyuan, and in any case belief in Wutong’s powers was wide-spread in south China well before Wutong was canonized as Wuxian.chapter 7. the enchantment of wealth1.She zhi(1609), 5, fengtu, 12a; subsequently quoted in Gu Yanwu, Tianxiajunguo libing shu,9.76a–b.2.

This feature of the cult recalls astory about the Shrine of the God of the Ji River (Jiduci) in Henan related in sev-eral early sixteenth-century records. The God of the Ji River had acquired a rep-utation for making loans to mortals. Those who wished to borrow from the god’shoard first cast divination blocks to determine whether or not the god would grantthe request. If a positive answer was received, the supplicant wrote out a loan con-tract specifying the amount of silver desired and tossed it into the pool before thetemple; the correct amount of silver would then float to the surface. This silver,when used in trade, reputedly brought twice the normal profit. At the expirationof the contract the borrower would return the amount of silver he borrowed, plusinterest, by throwing it back into the pool. The original contract would float upin return. See Zhu Yunming, Yuguai lu,13b–14a; Lu Can, Shuoting,shang.7a–b.An early thirteenth-century account also notes the practice of tossing offerings intothe pool at this temple, though the offerings consisted of spirit money and winerather than silver. But it was also said that silver wine goblets and incense boxesthrown into the pool would float to the surface if the god approved the suppli-cant’s prayer, and that wine drunk from goblets recovered in this fashion wouldforever taste sweet. The silver wine goblets perhaps inspired the later practice ofobtaining silver from the pool. See Yuan Haowen, Xu Yijian zhi,1.22–23.47.Yuanbao(inaugural treasure) refers to the fifty-ounce silver ingot that hadbecome a standard unit for, among other things, forwarding tax receipts fromlocalities to the central government.48.

See Poe shanren (pseud.), Yehangchuan,7.8a.67. Medical experts regarded dreams of sexual congress with spirits as a re-sult of being deprived of a normal sexual life; thus, ladies of the imperial harem,nuns, and widows were seen as particularly susceptible. However, the range ofsymptoms associated with this affliction in medical texts generally coincides withthe symptoms attributed to possession by Wutong, with one addition: ghost (i.e.,false) pregnancies. See Qi Zhongfu, Nüke baiwen,shang, 60b–62a. (I am in-debted to Charlotte Furth for bringing this work to my attention.)

Guandi, of course, enjoyed widespread homage long before the eigh-teenth century, but was seen as a special patron of Shanxi and Shaanxi natives.The earliest guildhalls built by Shanxi-Shaanxi merchants usually took the formof temples to Guandi. Shanxi banks explicitly claimed Guandi as their ancestorand patron, though in Qing times Guandi was also the chief cult figure in guild-halls founded by merchants from Huizhou and elsewhere. See Niida 1951: 19,54, 65, 75, 95. Barend ter Haar suggests that the association of Guandi withShaanxi merchants originated in patronage of the cult by Xiezhou (Shaanxi) saltmerchants in the Song.

See Jiangning xianzhi(1748), 10.5a. Undoubtedly the effort toconnect the Wulu caishen cult to Gu Yewang owed to the fact that Gu’s tomb waslocated at Stone Lake.

Scattered references to the founding of god-of-wealth temples duringthe Ming period appear in Qing gazetteers but cannot be corroborated by con-temporary records. Overall, the eighteenth century stands out as a watershed inthe founding of god-of-wealth temples. For example, residents of Puyuanzhen(Jiaxing) added a god-of-wealth sanctuary to the town’s tuditemple in 1749,while the town’s cloth merchants pooled funds to build another god-of-wealthsanctuary as part of the reconstruction of the town’s main Daoist temple in 1773:Puchuan suowenji(1813), 2.15b, 18a.318Notes to Pages 245–246"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"113.

Wulutang temples are listed, but not explicitly asso-ciated with Wutong, in Shenghu zhi(1716), shang.53a, Pingwang zhi(1840),5.9a–b, Wujun Fuli zhi(1765), 15.5b, Shatou lizhi(1740 ms.), 2.12b, Zhenzezhenzhi(1844), 6.14b, and Nanxiang zhenzhi(1782), 10.12b.117. In addition to Marshal Ma and Zhao Gongming this quartet includedWen Qiong and Guandi. See Qingwei Ma Zhao Wen Guan sishuai dafa,in DFHY(HY1210), 36. Rituals associated with each of the four are recorded in juan222–26, 232–40, 253–54, and 259–60, respectively, of the same work.118.Zhengyi xuantan Zhao yuanshuai bifa,in DFHY,232.1a–2b. For HeHe as intercessors in the acquisition of wealth, see the incantations preserved inibid., 232.14b–15a, 233.8a, 233.12a, 234.18a.119.Sanjiao yuanliu soushen daquan,3.20a.120. Xu Zhonglin, Fengshen yanyi,99.994.121. The earliest reference to worship of Zhao Gongming specifically as agod of wealth dates only from 1830. See Gu Lu, Qingjia lu,3.11b. In this in-stance Zhao was worshiped on his feast day, the fifteenth day of the third month,rather than at New Year’s. Even though Zhao and his assistants later are linkedto Wulu caishen, they clearly derived from independent origins. See Nakamura1983: 374–75.122. On worship of Zhao Gongming as the Martial God of Wealth in twentieth-century Jiangnan, see Zhang Yongyao et al. 1994: 60; Wu Zude 1992: 115–16; Ou Yue 1992: 130–31.123. The “precious scroll” of this title denotes a broad genre of religiousliterature known as “precious scrolls” (baojuan). The earliest baojuanwere prod-ucts of Buddhist religious sects, and in the late Ming period the genre was closelyassociated with messianic and prophetic sectarian religion. From the late seven-teenth century, though, baojuanliterature lost contact with its sectarian rootsand instead became didactic works for the propagation of conventional ethicsand piety compounded from Buddhist, Daoist, and Confucian teachings. The Pre-cious Scroll of the God of Wealth clearly belongs to this later phase of the genre.Notes to Pages 246–249319"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"On the evolution of baojuan,see Overmyer 1985; on the early development ofthe sectarian baojuan,see Overmyer 1999.124. The five sons are born into five different families. Later on, however,they are brought together and recognize themselves as brothers, and the virtu-ous elderly couple as their real parents.125.Caishen baojuan(undated ms., Beijing University Library). This workis identical to the 1824 manuscript, now held in the Waseda University Library,catalogued in Sawada 1975: 143–44. Other nineteenth- and twentieth-centurymanuscript copies of this text are catalogued in Li Shiyu 1961: 4, no. 31.126. On the common trope of dispensing charity to obtain sons in late Mingliterature, see Lauwaert 1990.127. I borrow the term “yangification” from Sangren 1987: 183. Sangren em-ploys the word to describe the process whereby female deities such as Guanyinand Mazu become identified with the established order of society. At the sametime, he emphasizes that such female deities occupy an ambiguous position inthe patriarchal pantheon and can still serve as vehicles for repudiating the prin-ciple of hierarchical subordination. In the case of the modern god of wealth, thedisavowal of such ambiguity is more complete.128. See von Glahn 1996.129. Von Glahn 2003a.130. There is a rapidly growing literature on social welfare institutions in theQing period. See especially Liang Qizi 1997 and Fuma Susumu 1997. Thesignificance of price movements in the Qing is still a subject of much debate,though the stability of secular trends in the eighteenth century in contrast to thesixteenth and seventeenth centuries is generally acknowledged. For a recent re-view, see Kishimoto 1997: 11–73.131. Zhejiang minsu xuehui 1986: 66 (in reference to worship of Wushengin Hangzhou prefecture).132. Jin 1995: 65–78.133.Xiwu canlüe,cited in Huzhou fuzhi(1874), 31.23a. Shimen xianzhi(1879), 10.9a, notes that local sericulturalists were extremely diligent in theirsacrifices to Canhua wusheng, and went as far as sacrificing a chicken to the de-ity at the time of the silkworms’ “big sleep” (damian).134. Day 1940: 161–62, 213. The association of these Wusheng deities withthe Wutong cult is further substantiated by Day’s identification of Huaguang as“Lord of Silkworm Gods.” See ibid., p. 212.135. Jin Tianlin 1990.136. Gu Xijia 1990: 123, table 1. Tanfois the colloquial name given to theserituals in the Wu dialect of Jiangnan. See Jiang Bin, ed., 1992: 111.137. Cai Limin 1992; personal observations during my two visits to theMount Shangfang temple in 1991 and 1998.138. This manipulation of the symbolism of Tang Bin in service to the MountShangfang cult calls into question Jiang Zhushan’s contention (1997: 208–9) thatpopular veneration of Tang Bin in the Qing period should be read as evidenceof acceptance of the Confucian tenet that “deviance will never triumph over cor-rectness” (xie busheng zheng).320Notes to Pages 249–255"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"conclusion1. This proposition originated with Piet van der Loon (1977: 168). Mostscholars of Chinese religion (including myself) abjure shamanism as a useful con-cept in the context of Chinese religion but nonetheless endorse the essential thrustof van der Loon’s argument, which is that the principal function of Chinese re-ligion is to evoke blessings and exorcise demons through ritual action.
