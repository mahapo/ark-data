At the time, I was inclined to demur for fear that the field may have been harvested to the point of diminishing returns. But now that the volume is ready I am glad that I allowed myself to be persuaded. This transformation in my attitude is the result of what the distinguished contributors to this volume have accomplished in these essays. Apparently the field is more fecund than I had taken it to be. In the first essay we are offered a glimpse of how even initially unpromising material of the kind associated with ritual minutiae can reward scholarly perseverance. Stephanie W. Jamison demonstrates how such investigation sheds new light on the status of women. It also allows us to see earlier conclusions in this respect in a new light. With the second essay we enter a magic garden, as it were, inhabited by the Buddhist “fairies.” This paper explores a realm often neglected, the realm which lies between the mundane and the transcendent. Victoria K. Urubshurow dis-closes how vital a role óàkinãs, who inhabit this in-between world, play in the ascent from the mundane to the transcendent in Tibetan Buddhism. The third essay deals with “embodied knowledge,” wherein Kartikeya C. Patel offers a new paradigm of viewing the relationship between women, earth and the Goddess. The fourth essay, by comparison, is more conventional and deals with women and the worship of the Goddess, at the end of which Hillary Rodrigues offers the interesting conclusion that the entire period of festivities brings about “a temporary status elevation” for women. It represents a period during which “woman hood is transformed and purified, elevated in auspiciousness and venerated.” The fifth essay discusses what happens to ordinary women of the family when the families become God-intoxicated. Vidyut Aklujkar illustrates their fate with the help of biographical details from the lives of Nàmdev and Tukàràm."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"ARVIND SHARMA x The final essay examines in textual and hermeneutical detail the position of Øaïkara on the accessibility of salvation to woman and ×Ådras. The issue is important because it is Øaïkara’s position that the Vedas are inaccessible to women and ×Ådras, and further that the Vedas are the primary means of attaining salvific knowledge about Brahman. An important point in Øaïkara’s thought is involved here—thatØaïkara allows for a universal soteriology within allowing for universal accessibility to the Vedas. Katherine K. Young spells out how precisely Øaïkara manages to hold on hermeneutically to these apparently divergent positions. These essays point to a hermeneutics of surprise, both individually as well as collectively. That is to say, they surprise us by belying our academic expectations. To offer just two examples: Menstruation often possesses negative associations in Hinduism and yet it seems to acquire an almost celebratory air in chapter three when the earth is feminized in this way—an outcome one would hardly expect in the light of the earlier association. Similarly, one would expect the family of a devout devotee to be suffused with domestiv felicity as an expression of such piety, and yet the next-of-kin of the saint seem to have a hard time in chapter five. And so on. I hope I have said enough to induce the reader to keep reading further for more surprises."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONE ROLES FOR WOMEN IN VEDICØRAUTA RITUAL1STEPHANIEW.JAMISONOne of the neglected sources for the study of women in ancient Indiais the vast storehouse of materials relating toØrauta ritual, i.e. solemnVedic ritual. The extent of the textual material is immense: Our veryearliest texts, the four Vedas themselves, are ritual-internal texts,consisting of formulae, both poetry and prose, to be pronouncedduring rituals. In addition to these liturgical texts, we have anenormous body of ritual-external texts. The class of texts known asBrÀhmaõas consists of exegesis—explanations for ritual procedurethat turn on mythological, practical, or mystical justifications. Andperhaps most remarkable of all, there are extremely detailed ritualmanuals, theØrauta SÅtras, which specify every step of theprocedure—every hand position, every muttered word, every wipingof every spoon—from the point of view of a variety of ritualparticipants. Each type of text exists in many versions, the products ofdifferent priestly traditions and theological schools. The whole comesto many thousands of pages. This material is relevant to the study of women and gender becauseone of the necessary participants in solemn ritual is a woman, the so-called “Sacrificer’s Wife.”The performance of even the simplestØrauta ritual requires a number of participants, whom I will brieflyintroduce. The setter-in-motion of the sacrifice is the misleadinglynamed “Sacrificer”(yajamÀna). He arranges for the performance,chooses the priests, and pays for the “gifts”that are equivalent topriestly wages. He also receives all the benefit (or malefit) of the   1 A previous version of this paper was presented in the Harvard Divinity SchoolWomen’s Studies in Religion lecture series, in Feb. 1993, and most of the researchwas conducted while I was a Visiting Lecturer and Research Associate at the HarvardDivinity School.

JAMISON 2ritual: there are no rites performed purely for social or public ends.What he does not do issacrifice, in the narrow sense. Most of theaction, both physical and verbal, is the province of the various priestshe has assembled. All but the simplest rituals require several priests,representing the different Vedas, and each may have severalassistants. The more elaborate rites could become very populousindeed. At the prompting of the priests the Sacrificer goes from place toplace and occasionally says something or makes an offering, but hisparticipation consists primarily of being there and, in some rituals,undergoing a preliminary consecration (dÃkùÀ). His companion in theritual process is his wife. One of the main technical requirements forbeing a Sacrificer is that he must be a householder (gçhastha); hemust be married. Not only that but the presence and participation ofhis wife is required in all the solemn rituals. Sacrificer’s Wife (patnÃ)is astructural rolein ritual with particular duties and activities thatcannot ordinarily be performed by anyone else. Though treatments (or rather mentions) of the Sacrificer’s Wife inmodern secondary literature tend to minimize the importance of herrole,2there is much evidence to suggest the opposite. We might beginby noting the term by which she is invariably referred to. Thoughthere are a number of words for ‘wife’ current in Vedic Sanskrit ofthe period (e.g.jÀyÀ, bharyÀ[lit. ‘the one to be supported’]), only oneis used of her in her ritual role:patnÃ, the feminine counterpart ofpati‘master’. If the English word did not have misleadingconnotations, ‘Mistress’ would be a better rendering than‘Sacrificer’s Wife’. Her husband is not mentioned in hernomenclature: she is simply the female ‘Master’ of the rites.3 The exegetical texts specifically mention her importance to ritualperformance—a ritual without a wife is no ritual at all—and the wife ishalf of oneself.4The first major duty of awife is toserve as ritualpartner, and this requirement is so strong that, according to some legalauthorities, a wife may not be repudiated once they have jointly kindled   2See e.g. Lévi, p. 157, n. 1; Hubert and Mauss, n. 263; Hopkins, p. 338.3Interestingly enough the sacrificer is not called apati. 4Cf. e.g.ØB I.3.1.12; BØS XXIX.9 (381: 2); MØS VIII.23.10, 12-13."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"ROLES FOR WOMEN IN VEDIC øRAUTA RITUAL3the fires that establish them as sacrificers.5 There is also a whole machinery to deal with any temporary inabilityof the wife to take part because she is menstruating or in childbirth.6Inthe former case, though she is banished from the ritual area, she may berequired to leave behind a token of her presence7or sit close by on aheap of sand until her menstrual period is over8: her presence is sonecessary that even when she is polluting she must oversee the ritualfrom a safe distance. Meanwhile someone else may be assigned tospeak her lines and perform her acts, or they may be omitted—there ismuch debate on the subject among the theologians.9There is also somedebate about whether a pregnant woman may engage in ritual, but thequestion is resolved in favor of her participation.10 Despite this testimony to her importance, it must be admitted that thewife’s activities are somewhat circumscribed. Her movement aroundthe ritual ground is more restricted than her husband’s, and for longstretches of the ritual she does nothing at all but sit in her assigned spot.However, she acts independently of her husband; she is not merely hisdouble or shadow in ritual performance. Furthermore, though she isinactive for much of most rituals, when she does act it is often at crucialand climactic moments, as we will see. The treatment of the wife’s activities in the ritual manuals seems tome a promising place to begin probing the vexed question of women inancient India.11The treatments are descriptive, not interpretive. Theydispassionately tell where she sits, what she wears, what she does withher hands, what she says, what kind of basket she carries and what it   5Cf.ÂpDS II.5.23-24.6Cf. e.g. TB III.7.1.9 [ KS XXXV.18 (64:17)]; KØS XXV.11.17, BØS XXIX.11(384:3).7Cf.ÂpØS IX.2.1-2.8Cf.

The only systematicexception I know of is a recent (1991) article of F. M. Smith. Smith reaches verydifferent conclusions from mine, but a full discussion is beyond the scope of thisarticle. The promisingly titled “The wife inthe Vedic ritual”of J. B. Chaudhuri isalmost entirely descriptive; what little analysis it contains is directed towardsestablishing the ritual supremacy of the chief wife and, by extension, the monogamousbent of ancient Indian society -- sometimes to the detriment of the evidence. Winternitz1920 devotes relatively little space to the wife’s ritual behavior."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"STEPHANIE W. JAMISON4contains, and so on. Insofar as any text can be considered “objective,”these seem to be. There is no overt ideological shaping, simply aminute-by-minute account of everyone’s activities, from which thewife’s occasional participation can be extracted. But once extracted, thismaterial makes it clear that the tasks of women in ritual were nothaphazardly assigned. By examining the mandated religious activitiesof women as chronicled by the remarkable “ritual scripts”of theØrautaSÅtras, we can begin to grasp the conceptual space women fill inreligious practise. Though the wife does relatively little, her dutiesframe the ritual and ensure her contact with every important portion ofit. Moreover, her tasks fall into functional roles that help define theposition of women in religious ideology and also define the religiousideology as in part a function of the conceptual position of women. What I will do now is give athematic overviewof the wife’s rolesin ritual, trying to avoid as much as possible the technical minutiae thathas made this field so impenetrable to those who might find itsimplications valuable. However, there are occasions when onlytechnical detail can clarify what is going on. Given limitations of space,I forbear to quote the texts, but ample references are given in thenotes.12 A few of the wife’s actions she undertakes jointly with her husband.In particular, in rituals in which her husband is first consecrated, sheundergoes adÃkùÀentirely parallel to that of her husband, involvingthe same privationswith regard to food and physical comfort.13Thisconsecration makes her eligible to participate as the full ritual partnerof her husband.Unlike her husband, she is also bound temporarily with a cord evenduring rituals not requiring his consecration, in a ceremony known asthepatnÃsaünahana‘the girding of the wife.’14The girding occurs atthe beginning of the ritual, and the cord is loosened at the end. Though   12Full textual citations are given in the book mentioned in n. 1.13The actual procedures of the DÃkùÀare well-discussed in the standard secondaryliterature (e.g. Caland-Henry, pp. 11-26; Hillebrandt 1897, pp. 125-6; Kane, pp. 1135-41).14The pattern for this girding is given in the description of the model Iùñi, theDar×apÅrõamÀsa ritual, and it is used for all other Iùñis and as the basis for the moreelaborate consecration ceremonies. A synopsis of the action can be found inHillebrandt’s 1879 treatmentof the Dar×apÅrõamÀsa ritual, pp. 59-61."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"ROLES FOR WOMEN IN VEDIC øRAUTA RITUAL5this girding has been seen15(wrongly in my view) as a symbol of thewife’s dominated state and loss of independence, in fact it is anotherprocedure to bring her to temporary ritual equality with her husband.When he was initiated as a boy, he was tied with a girdle and investedwith a sacred cord (upavÃta), which he always wears. The binding ofthe wife gives her the status of an initiate for the duration of the ritual,as the accompanying mantras and the theological exegesis makes quiteclear. The binding and unbinding of the wife also provide a perceptualframe, within which the principal activity of the ritual performanceoccurs. From our point of view the independent actions of the wife are moreinteresting than those undertaken with her husband. Some of the wife’sroles are fairly predictable from her secular life, activities that connecther with the household and with housekeeping tasks. Actions likethreshing and grinding the grain for the Iùñi16or fashioning a pot tohold the fire in the ritual of the Piling of the Fire Altar (agnicayana)17seemsimplysacralizedequivalentsofreal-lifedomesticduties—though other conceptual associations can also spill over ontothese simple tasks. For example, since pots are often conceived of assurrogate wombs,18her shaping of the fire pot connects her to thefertility functions we will discuss below. Let us also note her usual position on the demarcated place of theritual, the ritual ground, a conceptually complex geography boundedespecially by three functionally distinct sacred fires. The various partsof the ritual ground have rich symbolic associations, and moving fromplace to place in this little cosmos is as significant an action as pouringa libation or reciting a mantra. The “world”or place of the wife(patnÃloka) is south-west of the so-called “Householder’s Fire”(gÀrhapatya), which sits at the western end of the ritual ground. This iswhere she stays throughout the ritual except when she is led elsewhereto perform some specific task. Many of the actions performed withregard to her, or to female divinities, happen here at the Householder’s   15By F. M. Smith, art. cit.

JAMISON6Fire. This again links the wife clearly to the domestic and mundanesphere. Most of the sacral activity occurs elsewhere, around the OfferingFire (ÀhavanÃya) to the east. So, in one sense, the wife is physicallymarginalized in her “wife’s world.”But the “Householder’s Fire”is notonly the “home”of the wife; it is also thehomebaseof the whole ritualprocedure: the male participants begin there, fare forth to the east forthe crucial actions in the middle of the performance, but return to thewest to wind down with a series of actions that in some ways reversethe opening activities. So, though not geographically central, theHouseholder’s Fire and the wife anchor the sacrificer and the priests tothe human world and provide a means of re-entry at the end of theritual. The wife’s function as linkage we will return to below. Perhaps even more important than this linking of the mundane andthe sacred is her role in injecting sexuality into the perfect, orderedworld of the ritual. One of the abiding concerns of all Vedic rituals, nomatter what else they are directed towards, is fertility, the increase ofprosperity through the generation of offspring and cattle and theassurance of good pasturage and crops through abundant rain. This fert-ility, on whatever level, is often conceived of as sexual in nature, asresulting from sexual activity. Indeed, many other desirable events andstates in the natural and social world, like the rising of the sun, are alsoconsidered to be the direct result of sexual activity. Now, for reasons Ido not have space to detail here, I think we must see women as theprimary locus of active sexuality in ancient India, and therefore they actas the conduit to introduce sexual energy into the potentially sterileworld of the orderly ritual. Their very presence traps sexuality and itspower for ritual use. The exegetical texts explicitly state this rather tediously often. It isthe only reason for women in ritual that they consistently recognize.Over and over it is repeated,yad vai patnÃyajñe karóti tan mithunam What the wife does in ritual is sexual pairing.19   19MS III.7.9 (88: 6).

MS III.8.7, IV.1.12; TS VI.2.1.2; TB III.3.4.2, etc., as wellas the equivalent KS comment after describing an action of the wife:"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"ROLES FOR WOMEN IN VEDIC øRAUTA RITUAL7Activities with the most banal and innocuous aspect, like the wife’slooking at a pot of melted butter, can be exegetically tortured intobearing sexual meanings—giving one great respect for the ingenuity ofthe exegetes. How is this injection of the wife’s sexuality manifested ritually?There is a continuum from the most attenuated and subtle suggestionsto the most dramatic displays. Let us begin with the subtle ones.Returning briefly to the wife’s place on the western end of the ritualground, we may note that, because of the east-facing Vedic spatialorientation, this western part of the territory is known as the “hind end”(jaghana) and is explicitly connected both with the female posterior andwith sexuality and generation. The wife is then called the “hind end”ofthe ritual.20 There is also a ritual posture known as “taking hold of from behind”(anvÀrambha[na]). This involves touching someone or something frombehind, either with the hand or with some intermediary material like agrass blade or even a meat-skewer, while the other person is performingsome action like pouring an oblation. The purpose seems to be on theone hand to increase the power and effectiveness of the libation (orwhatever) by making available to it the power of a second performer,who is linked to the first through physical contact. On the other hand, italso spreads the sacrality of the action or object back to those in contactwith it. Though in performance this posture is the special province of thesacrificer, the exegetical texts classify almost every action of thewife—looking at the melted butter, conversing with her husband—asmystically equivalent to “taking holdof the ritualfrom behind.”21Theythen frequently liken her “taking hold of from behind”to sexualintercourse. In these cases, her sexual potential is clearly being bothtapped and enhanced. On the one hand, her sexuality and fertility arebeing spread to the entire ritual by this theoretical contact. On the other,   atho mithunam eva yajñamukhe dadhÀti prajananÀya Then he places sexual pairing in the mouth/front of the worship, for progeneration [KSXIV.8 (202: 7), XXIV.4, XXIV.8, XXV.8, XXXI.9].20Cf. e.g.ØB I.3.1.12, I.9.2.3, II.5.2.29, V.2.1.8.21Cf. e.g. MS I.11.8 (169: 15), IV.1.12 (15: 7)."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"STEPHANIE W. JAMISON8the power unleashed by the ritual because ofitscontact with the divineis spread back to her, to increase her generative capacity. Her variousactions, however minor they may appear and however far from thecenter of ritual activity they may occur, are classified as physicalcontact—and not merely with one participant or object in the ritual, butwith the very ritual itself. She encompasses the ritual in some sensewhenever she performs the smallest sacral action. Thus, though she isphysically marginalized during the ritual performance, her forces can bebrought into contact with it, through this theoretical “touching frombehind.”Such reclassification of action is not made for any otherparticipant. More explicit reference to sexuality is found on the occasions whenshe ceremonially receives from her husband or a priest tokens withsexual symbolism—e.g. a broom, a bow, or a fire-drilling apparatus.Though these particular objects may not seem suggestive to us, they areculturally and religiously laden, and their symbolic burden is announcedin the mantras that accompany the transfer. For example, at the end ofthe twice-monthly New and Full Moon Sacrifice, the broom that hasbeen ritually employed is tossed into the wife’s lap or put between herthighs, and it is said that she will give birth to a son.22The exegeticaltexts explicitly call the contact between wife and broom to a “procre-ative sexual pairing,”since the wife is female, the broom male. In fact,certain aspects of the treatment of the broom show that it functions inthe ritual as a surrogate husband. Such are some of thesymbolicrepresentations of sexuality in Vedicritual. We come now to the actual, the lurid, in fact to a ceremony sostriking that it has become notorious even outside of this field (thoughnot particularly far outside). It occurs in a royal ritual, the HorseSacrifice (a×vamedha), which is performed for an already powerfulking, to extend, consolidate, and display his power. In royal rituals theking is Sacrificer, and his wives act aspatnÃ, particularly his chiefqueen, themahiùÃor ‘Great Female Buffalo.’ At the climax of thislengthy and elaborate ritual (the preliminaries take a year), the chiefqueen copulates with the just slaughtered horse. Though she is coveredby a linen garment, the texts leave no doubt as to what physically she is   22Cf. e.g. MØS I.3.5.15-16;ÂpØS III.10.3; BØS III.30 (104:12);ØØS I.15.14; KBIII.8."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"ROLES FOR WOMEN IN VEDIC øRAUTA RITUAL9supposed to do, and it is not merely symbolic. As she lies there, shemockingly slights the horse’s sexual performance, and she and the les-ser wives of the king engage in obscene banter with the priests, whilehundreds of female attendants of the queens, their hair unbound, circlethe horse and the unfortunate lady, singing, dancing, and slapping theirthighs. The verbal part of the ceremony is so explicit that most transla-tors omit it or take refuge in scholarly Latin.23“Ribald dialogue”also takes place at the New Year’s Ceremony atthe end of a year-long ritual called the Progress of the Cows(gavÀmayana). Here the dialogue is between a prostitute (puü×calÃ) anda chaste student (brahmacÀrin), with some texts specifying ritualcopulation between them as well.24Meanwhile the sacrificer’s wivesplay flutes and lutes, and maid servants sing, dance, and slap theirthighs as above. In both cases it is hard not to see this showcasing of extreme publicsexuality, not only physically enacted but verbally encoded, as anattempt to capture sexual power in order to enhance the ritual effect andto promote fertility. In fact, this aspect of the Horse Sacrifice has beenso exhaustively discussed, by ancient commentators and modern ones,that I will not at present add further to it. However, I hope I have shownthat rather than being the freakish and aberrant spectacle it is sometimespresented as, it is the logical, if extreme, fulfillment of women’s ritualfunction. Somewhat more difficult cases are presented by several examples ofwhat, for want of a better term, I will call “negative sexuality,”but herethe same explanations can also prevail. Let us begin with a curious incident in one of the yearly SeasonalRituals (cÀturmÀsyÀni), the VaruõapraghÀsa (‘Devouring of Varuõa’),which occurs at the beginning of the rainy season. At a point in thecourse of this ritual, the priest asks the wife either (depending on thetext) “Who is your lover?”or “How many lovers do you have?”25Sheis supposed to name him or point to him or to hold up as many grass   23Cf. Eggeling (ØB XIII.5.2.2ff.); Keith (TS VII.4.19 d-k); Griffith (VS XXIII.20-31); Caland (ÂpØS XX.18.4).24Cf. e.g. MØS VII.2.7.13; KØS XIII.3.6, 9; BØS XVI.21 (267:10), 22 (268:10);ÂpØS XXI.17.18, 19, 9.5, 6.25Cf. e.g. MØS I.7.4.11;ÂpØS VIII.6.20 [=HirØS V.2 (Einoo 106), BhÀrØS VIII.9.4,VaikhØS VIII.12]; BØS V.7 (136:15); KØS V.5.5; VÀrØS I.7.2.27."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"STEPHANIE W. JAMISON10blades as she has lovers. After this confession, there is a brief expiationwith a curse laid on the lover, and the ritual continues. Most people26who have discussed this episode see it as representing a need forconfession and purification before embarking on important religiousacts, an impulse that is nearly universal. No doubt there is something tothis, as there is to the theory that it banishes evil from the ritual byscapegoating the lover. But why does this happen only in this ritual? No similar interroga-tion and confession occurs elsewhere in the system. Why in themiddle of the ritual, not the beginning? Would not the spiritual forceof what went before be annulled because impurity had not yet beenbanished? And why is only the wife involved, when other partici-pants should be equally pure to be effective? Moreover, no one seemsto have commented on the presupposition at the heart of the question:the wife is presupposed to have a lover; she has no option toannounce that she has none. But nothing in the legal system or in thenarrative literature suggests that wifely unchastity was the norm. All of this leads me to suppose that to serve ritual purposes sheneedsto have a lover—or at least the fiction of one. It seems to mepossible that eminently respectable, middle-aged brahmin ladies“confessed”to lovers they did not have, for the sake of ritualeffectiveness. Why? Perhaps because illicit sex may bring a bigger joltof sexual energy into the arena than proper marital sexual conduct, andthe wife, as locus of sexuality, was charged to provide this. (The studentand the whore mentioned above function likewise.) A kind of “animalpassion”outside of socially sanctioned norms is what’s wanted, and Ithink it is no accident that the interrogation of the wife takes place atthe ritual that ushers in the rainy season, which begins the cycle of fer-tility. Moreover, this question and answer session is embedded in themiddle of another episode in that ritual, in which a pair of statuettes ofram and ewe, cunningly fashioned of barley meal with their sexualorgans especially prominent, are offered. Animal passion indeed! Boththe barley meal figurines and the wife with her quite possibly fictitiouslover are tidy and controllable simulacra of rampant sexuality, in ayearly repeated ritual where the real thing, in the mode of the Horse   26Beginning with the exegetes themselves.

A mirror-image figure to the lady and her phantom lover is a wifewho plays an important part in several royal rituals. Recall in our dis-cussion of the Horse Sacrifice that, while the chief queen is under thelinen with the horse, several other wives of the king stand by makingdirty jokes. These subsidiary wives have other roles. In the ceremoniesimmediately preceding the sacrifice of the horse, they join the chiefqueen in anointing the horse and adorning it by weaving hundreds ofbeads into its hair. After it is killed and the copulation is over, theyinsert needles into the dead animal, to guide the paths of the knives incutting up the victim. One of these wives is the so-called Rejected or Avoided Wife(parivçktÃ), one no longer favored by the king, perhaps because she hasfailed to bear a son.27The particular part of the horse she has charge ofis the hind end, called by the same word as the wife’s place in the ritualground. This part, of course, contains the generative organs and isexplicitly connected with sexuality. The Rejected Wife also appears inthe ritual of the Consecration of the King (rÀjasÅya): an offering ismade in her house, one of a series performed in the dwellings of a set ofimportant social figures known as the “Bejewelled”(ratnin). TheRejected Wife’s oblation is dedicated to the Goddess of Disorder (Nirçti)and consists of “black rice grains split by the (finger) nails.”28It isperhaps not only to modern sensibilities that this conjures up a pictureof a scarlet-nailed harpy, driven by jealous rage, systematicallyassassinating rice grains, one by one. Why is such a presumably inauspicious person allotted importantroles in rituals that affect not only the king but the security, power, andfertility of his kingdom? A person whose very title names her despisedposition. Is this simply a case of inviting the bad fairy to the feast, so shewill not crash and spoil it? I think it is more than that—that, like the wifewith the supposed lover, the Rejected Wife is a woman who livesoutside of socio-sexual norms and who therefore has access to morecharged sexual energy than others do. In her case, sexual frustra-tion/rejection is felt to build up unreleased passion—to see that this is a   27SoØB V.3.1.13.28Cf. e.g. MØS IX.1.1.36; BØS XII.5 (92: 1); KØS XV.3.14; MS IV.3.8; KS XV.4(211:16); TB I.7.3.4;ØB V.3.1.13."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"STEPHANIE W. JAMISON12widely held view we need look no further than modern models like themovie Fatal Attraction. This passion can be channelled into the ritualand utilized to increase the king’s power. It is not surprising that theRejected Wife is associated with the army in some texts: her sexual furycan be ritually transformed into martial fervor. Let us now leave the sexual realm and turn to an area where the roleof the wife seems to me at least as important, though not as explicitlyrecognized by contemporary exegetes. This is the area of hospitality andexchange relations—a crucial mechanism in ancient India, governingthe relations between people (or rather, to be realistic, men) as well asthose between the human and the divine, the living and the dead. Hospi-tality—its obligations and dangers—and gift exchange, the delicatenegotiations involved in giving and receiving presents, are endlesslyrepeated themes throughout Indian literature and religious practise.Women figure prominently in both areas, as dispensers of hospitality onthe one hand and, more important, as the ultimate exchange token in themost fundamental exchange relation, that of marriage. Needless to say,her importance in these areas is symbolically represented in the ritual,again in a continuum from subtle to dramatic. Many of her activities inthese spheres are especially clearly highlighted in the most elaborate ofthe non-royal rituals, the Soma Sacrifice—a ritual in which theplantsoma, made into the inspiritingdrinksoma, isboth ceremoniallyreceived as king and god and then as ceremonially sacrificed. Thecomplex of exchange relations in this ambivalent treatment of thecentral substance, soma, is reflected in the wife’s several roles. First let us note that when King Soma is ritually received as guest inthe Hospitality Rite (Àtithya), the wife—unusually—participates in theoblation, which is made through the medium of her hand.29(Mostactual offering otherwise is done by a priest.) This rite is conductedexactly as if the dry bundle of sticks from the soma plant were anespecially distinguished human visitor: he is brought in on a cart, solici-tously taken down, offered a seat and comestibles. The wife’s role is, inmany ways, just a ritual enactment of household duty. The exegeticaltexts mention that she “has control of the household goods,”30and soher permission and participation in this guest reception is required.   29Cf. e.g. MØS II.1.5.3;ÂpØS X.30.6; MS III.7.9 (88: 5).30MS III.7.9 (88:5); KS XXIV.8, TS VI.2.1.1."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"ROLES FOR WOMEN IN VEDIC øRAUTA RITUAL13 The wife also has ritual dominion over the “Foot-washing water(pannejanÃ).”In the secular realm a major requirement for the receptionof a guest is to provide him with water to wash his feet. The SomaSacrifice also has foot-washing water, destined for the reception of thevisiting gods or for washing the limbs of the dead animal victimsubsidiarily sacrificed at this elaborate ritual. The foot-washing watermarks not merely the gods but also the victim as a guest, and this wateris in the wife’s sole charge. She carries it wherever it needs to go on theritual ground, and at the end of the pressing day, she places the potbetween her thighs and pours some of the water along her thighs: aninteresting yoking of her sexual and hospitable functions. This samelinkage is played out elsewhere, in a number of narratives we cannotexplore here. Women’s role as exchange token is quite remarkably enacted in theSoma ritual as well, but through such a series of transfers and repre-sentations that I think it has escaped notice before. The situation is this:before Soma the king can be received as a guest, Soma the plant mustbe purchased. The purchase is part of the ritual—even the bargaining isscripted—and the purchase price is a cow. Needless to say, given theelaboration of every other part of the procedure, the cow is not justproduced and handed over. There is a series of actions that prepare her,too, for the exchange. These actions connect her both with the wife andwith the sacrificer in a bizarre sort of switch. On the one hand, the wife and the cow participate in two nearlysimultaneous exchanges. They are made to look at each other, toexchange glances, and the wife is given the sand from the footprint ofthe cow, sand which she will later distribute ritually.31Though there isno physical contact by our standards, both gazes and footprints aresymbolically charged in this culture, as has been amply demonstratedby others. Mutual gazes “count”as physical contact and are frequentlyused in ritual to transfer forces, as we saw above with the melted butter.Footprints are so representative of the person or animal that made themthat they are objects of worship to this day. What is even more interesting is the particular footprint from whichthe sand has been extracted. Just previously the priests have caused the   31Cf. e.g. BØS VI.13 (169:19)."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"STEPHANIE W. JAMISON14cow to take seven steps.32It is the footprint from the seventh step thatprovides the sand that the wife receives. What is the significance of thisseventh step? Let us consider an important ritual belonging to thedomestic sphere, the marriage ceremony. This ritual has a number ofparts, but the climactic moment, the action after which the marriage islegally irrevocable, is the “Seven Steps,”which the bride makes, led oraccompanied by the groom.33So when the soma cow makes the sevensteps, she becomes symbolically a bride; shemarriesthe sacrificer. Theexchange of the glances and of the sand between wife and cow simplycements their interchange of roles. Wife becomes cow, cow wife.Indeed, in at least one text the sacrificer addresses the cow with thesame mantras the groom uses to the bride under the same circumstancesat the wedding: “We have become companions at the seventh step.”34 So the cow now represents the sacrificer’s wife, and as soon as shedoes so, he sets out toexchangeher for the soma plant that is to becomesuccessively Soma the king, honored guest, and Soma the drink, thesacrificial victim. The wife, both directly and in the guise of the cow,mediates between the sacrificer and his guest and the sacrificer and hisvictim. We can also see this mediation in one last ritual task of the wife, thetending and preparation of the animal victim, once it has been sacri-ficed. In animal sacrifices all the principal actors stay strictly away fromthe actual killing of the animal; they physically remove themselves andturn their backs while someone else does the inauspicious deed. Butonce the animal is dead, it must be rearranged, cut up, cooked, andoffered. In the first step of the process, when the fearful forces boundup in the killing have not yet been dissipated, the wife is led near, tobathe the animal and verbally reinvigorate it.35She touches the victimand is said in one text to “perform much that is dirty and ritually impure(amedhya)”36—while her husband, the sacrificer, remains unsullied.Remember also that in the Horse Sacrifice, when the time comes to cutup the animal, the wives (already overworked, as we have seen) prepare   32Cf. e.g. BØS VI.12, 13 (169:15).33Cf. e.g.ØGS I.14.5.34Cf.ÂpØS X.23.1.35Cf. e.g. MØS I.8.4.4;ÂpØS VII.18.6-7; BØS IV.6 (118: 12); KØS VI.6.2; VÀrØSI.6.5.14-15.36MS III.10.1 (128: 8)."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"ROLES FOR WOMEN IN VEDIC øRAUTA RITUAL15the paths of the knives to cut up the victim.In both these instances the sacrificer’s wife, by touching the deadanimal, creates the necessary contact between the human and the divinerealms, between the living and the dead, that is a major aim of thesacrifice. She gains access to powerful and dangerous forces unleashedby the killing and can direct them to her husband and the success of hisritual, without his putting himself at risk. The husband himself nevertouches the animal; even when it was still alive, he made contact only bytouching it from behind with a meat skewer.37The wife’s general role inthe mundane world as mediator, as central token in the system ofexchanges, allows her to perform this same function in the ritual realm. In this brief and rather breathless tour of the most striking of thewife’s ritual activities, I have tried to unify under a few conceptualrubrics the varied and often bizarre-seeming tasks she is called upon toperform. I have not been able to touch on them all, or to explore theoften telling variations from text to text—nor have I done any justice towhat must have been her mainexperienceof ritual, hours and days ofextreme tedium sitting quietly in herpatnÃlokawhile the priestsmuttered, chanted, and poured, with this tedium broken only by herbeing led off to perform some peculiar and often humiliating task at themargins of theaction. Nonetheless, I hope to have demonstrated theideological importance of the wife inØrauta ritual and the value ofthis evidence for a general understanding of the roles of women inancient India.   37Cf. e.g. BØS IV.6 (117:11);ÂpØS VII.15.7."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"STEPHANIE W.

What is their nature? And what might be themeasure of their relationship with us? To obtain a glimmer ofunderstanding on these points it is useful to approach the TibetanBuddhist tradition that devotes a slice of its world view to one type ofthese subtle feminine presences. But before turning from home basein search of such beings, let us hear an account from a well-respectedIrish man. It may suggest that what is still alive among Tibetans maynot be too long-gone in the so-called “west”for those with a littleimagination. William Butler Yeats (1865-1939) yearned to encounter andcomprehend the ways of the Good People, the Forgetful People, theSidhe—that is the fairies. He befriended old Irish peasants andvisionaries to inquire after them. Yeats wrote of an encounter inwhich he made personal contact with a woman he called the “queenof the little people.”What follows is Yeats’account fromThe CelticTwilight(1893) entitled “Regina, Regina Pigmorum, Veni”:2One night a middle-aged man, who had lived all his life far from the noiseof cab-wheels, a young girl, a relation of his, who was reported to be   1 This essay is based upon a presentation made by the author at the SmithsonianInstitution, Washington, DC on April 30, 1994 in a course entitled “The Goddess inMyth and Religion.”2 Yeats adds in 1924 a note indicating that these words were “used as anevocation in Windsor Forest by Lilly, the astrologer.”William Butler Yeats,Mythologies(New York: Macmillan, Collier Books, 1969 (c. 1959)), p. 54.

We talked of the Forgetful People, as the faerypeople are sometimes called, and came in the midst of our talk to anotable haunt of theirs, a shallow cave amidst black rocks, with itsreflection under it in the wet sea sand. I asked the young girl if she couldsee anything, for I had quite a number of things to ask the ForgetfulPeople. She stood still for a few minutes, and I saw that she was passinginto a kind of waking trance, in which the cold sea breeze no longertroubled her, nor the dull boom of the sea distracted her attention. I thencalled aloud the names of the great faeries, and in a moment or two shesaid that she could hear music far inside the rocks, and then a sound ofconfused talking, and of people stamping their feet as if to applaud someunseen performer. Up to this my other friend had been walking to and frosome yards off, but now he passed close to us, and as he did so saidsuddenly that we were going to be interrupted, for he heard the laughterof children somewhere beyond the rocks. We were, however, quite alone.The spirits of the place had begun to cast their influence over him also. Ina moment he was corroborated by the girl, who said that bursts oflaughter had begun to mingle with the music, the confused talking, andthe noise of feet. She next saw a bright light streaming out of the cave,which seemed to have grown much deeper, and a quantity of littlepeople,* in various coloured dresses, red predominating, dancing to atune which she did not recognise. I then bade her call out to the queen of the little people to come andtalk with us. There was, however, no answer to her command. I thereforerepeated the words aloud myself, and in a moment she described a verybeautiful tall woman, who came out of the cave. I too had by this timefallen into a kind of trance,** in which what we call the unreal had begunto take upon itself a masterful reality, and I had an impression, notanything I could call an actual vision, of gold ornaments and dark hair. Ithen bade the girl tell this tall queen to marshal her followers according totheir natural divisions, that we might see them. I found as before that Ihad to repeat the command myself. The beings then came out of the cave,and drew themselves up, if I remember rightly, in four bands. One ofthese bands, according to her description, carried boughs of mountain-ashin their hands, and another had necklaces made apparently of serpents’scales, but their dress I cannot remember. I asked their queen to tell theseeress whether these caves were the greatest faery haunts in theneighborhood. Her lips moved, but the answer was inaudible. I bade theseeress lay her hand upon the breast of the queen, and after that she heardevery word quite distinctly. No, this was not the greatest faery haunt, forthere was a greater one a little farther ahead. I then asked her whether itwas true that she and her people carried away mortals, and if so, whetherthey put another soul in the place of the one they had taken. ‘We change"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"VICTORIA KENNICK URUBSHUROW20the bodies,’was her answer. ‘Are any of you ever born into mortal life?’‘Yes.’‘Do I know any who were among your people before birth?’‘Youdo.’‘Who are they?’‘It would not be lawful for you to know.’Ithenasked whether she and her people were not ‘dramatisations of ourmoods’? ‘She does not understand,’said my friend, ‘but says that herpeople are much like human beings, and do most of the things humanbeings do.’I asked her other questions, as to her nature, and her purposein the universe, but only seemed to puzzle her. At last she appeared tolose patience, for she wrote this message for me upon the sands—thesands of vision—‘Be careful, and do not seek to know too much aboutus.’Seeing that I had offended her, I thanked her for what she had shownand told, and let her depart again into her cave. In a little while the younggirl awoke out of her trance, and felt the cold wind from the sea, andbegan to shiver.3“Be careful, and do not seek to know too much about us,”said theglamourous—a word favored by Yeats—lady from the cave. Now, ifwe take this dictum inscribed on the sands of Yeat’s vision to heartwe find ourselves in an awkward position. With Yeats we wish to askprecisely the kind of questions that seemed to puzzle and offend thequeen of the little people—questions as to the nature of fairies, theirpurpose in the universe, and so on. But we are human, and it is ournature to make such inquiry. So we shall proceed—hopefully in amanner that both respects the integrity of such feminine presences,and fulfills our native sense of wonder and desire to know. Fairy lore in European-based cultures has been relegated largely tolegends and traditions. “[I]n spite of the fact that in English we arelikely to speak of all tales of wonder as fairy tales, the truth is that   3 Ibid., pp. 54-56.

I had learned from MacGregorMathers and his pupils to so suspend the will that the imagination moved ofitself. The girl was, however, fully entranced, and the man so affected by her thatheheard the children’s voices as if with his physical ears. On two occasions, lateron, her trance so affected me that I also heard or saw some part of what she did asif with physical eyes and ears.”(1924)"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"TIBETAN FAIRY GLIMMERINGS21fairies appear rarely in such stories.”4Speaking of the belief inmarvelous creatures, Stith Thompson noted nearly a half century agothat “[o]ne of the most widely accepted of all such beliefs,particularly in the countries of western Europe, concerns fairies.”5Yet, few people of “western”culture take the fairies seriously anymore; and written accounts of them remain meager. The esotericwork of Yeats might inspire a glimmer of curiosity; and perhaps thefairy queen Titania in Shakespeare’sA Midsummer Night’s Dreamfleetingly awakens childlike wonder. Yet, the day when fairies arecounted as vital beings in our culture apparently is nowhere afoot. Onthe other hand, Tibetan Buddhist tantric literature6for centuries haspresented earnest accounts of ethereal female beings. They areconsidered to be enlightened compilers of tantric teachings, and arethought to assist adepts with their spiritual practice. Looking into thelives of Indo-Tibetan Buddhist adepts we encounter an awesome sliceof the universe inhabited by fairies known as “sky dancers”(S:óÀkinÃ;T:mkha’gro ma).7For example,óÀkinÃsfigure prominently in   4 Stith Thompson,The Folktale(Berkeley, CA: University of California Press,1977; copyright 1946), p. 49. Thompson goes on to say, “Occasionally in someliterary reworking of a tale, one hears of a fairy godmother, but most accounts offairies appear as legends or traditions.”[Ibid.]5 Ibid., p. 246.6 Tantra is a subdivision of the Tibetan Mahayana Buddhist tradition. The spiritualbiographies treated in this essay are associated with the class of tantra known as “highestyoga tantra,”(S:anuttarayogatantra;T:bla med kyi rgyud).* This class oftantrainvolves the practice of moving subtle winds into the centralchannel of the subtle bodyin meditation.

This yoga involvesmeditation on a subtle body comprised of three major channels (S:nÀói;T:rtsa) located along the spinal column in a form resemblingthe caduceus of Hermes, and several energy centers (S:cakra;T:‘khor lo) situated at the gut, heart, throat, and brow-point).11Inmeditation tantric adepts gather their wind energy (S:prÀõa;T:rlung) into the central channel. The wind moves up the centralchannel, gradually opening the energy centers along the way. Thepractice involves a reciprocal relationship between mind and body:mind moves wind and wind effects a state of mind. The opening ofeach energy center is correlated with a particular type of experience.For example, when Milarepa opened or untied the knot at his throat   Buddhist materials: (a) “the fairies are usually thought of as living in a land of theirown,”and (b) “[f]airies are normally invisible to the generality of men.”[Ibid., p. 247.]Thompson further notes that “The dealings of fairies with mortals are sometimesadvantageous to people, but they are nearly alwaysfraught with danger.”[Ibid., p. 248.]In the Tibetan Buddhist tantric literature,óÀkinÃscan take on a frightening appearance,but the type with which theyogisandyoginÃssport are not portrayed as harmful tohuman beings. They are considered to be helpful beings—though dealing with themisnot for the fainthearted. 11 Sometimes the crown of the head is mentioned, and the gut is omitted if the centersare enumerated as a customary four. Hindu tantra enumerates seven energy centersincluding two at the base of the spine, at positions roughly corresponding to the anus andgenital organ. On the Tantric use ofthe centers, channels, and winds see Kelsang Gyatso,Clear Light of Bliss: MahÀmudrÀin VajrayÀna Buddhism, trans.

When thewinds enter fully into the heart center, the yogi’s mind of clear lightdirectly cognizes emptiness, which is profound wisdom according toBuddhist theory. The Tibetan tales of liberation show that the appearance ofóÀkinÃsis correlated with purification of the flow of energy through thecentral channel: Yeshe Tsogyel perceived her “psychic nerves andenergy flows as theôÀkinÃ’s maõóala[or microcosm],”12and sawnumerousóÀkinÃsin the conjugalyab yum(male-female)configuration, manifesting in white at her forehead, yellow at herthroat, blue-black at her heart, and red at her gut.13When Milarepahad trouble controlling the movement of his subtle wind,óÀkinÃsdemonstrated remedial yoga postures.

They inspire furtherpractice through pleasant encouragement. Although their form is often beautiful and efflorescent,óÀkinÃsalso assume fierce, ugly forms. In their wrathful aspect theóÀkinÃsare particularly effective in testing an adept’s understanding andproviding inspirational shocks. Once when Milarepa was deep inmeditation, five maidens came “clad in shrouds of light”riding ontheir “horses”—glittering rays of crystal-pure moonlight. Seeing this,the yogi was “undistracted for even a single moment.”He thenrecognized them as the sameóÀkinÃswho, some months before, hadcaused armies of demons to try to “harm [him] in all sorts of ways”with their missiles.27At that time Milarepa generated compassion forthe demons, knowing that harmful acts carry suffering in their wake.Impressed with the yogi’s ability to turn hardship into an occasion forthe practice of virtue, theóÀkinÃscame back to request teachingsrelated to Milarepa’s conquest of anger and impatience.

Sheasked theóÀkinÃswhy they were pursuing such pain; and theyreplied, “Procrastinating [in religious practice], merit is lost—[d]elay,and hindrances and obstacles multiply.”30Moved by the immediacyof this lurid display, Yeshe Tsogyel generated a wish “to practicesomething of that kind of austerity.”Hearing of this, Padmasaübhavaadvised:All that was only symbolic vision....It is not necessary for you now tomake an actual offering of the flesh. Better than that, practice [the eight]austerities [of diet, dress, speech, body, mind, teaching, compassion, andbenevolence].31Yeshe Tsogyel’s encounter in the Land of theôÀkinÃs, and her visionof Vajra Yogini standing at the center of the palacemaõóala “in ablaze of light so intense that is was almost unbearable to gazeupon,”32inspired an intensive practice of the eight austerities.Eventually she developed compassion enough to emulate theóÀkinÃsdirectly by cutting off her knee caps to help a man in need.33 Pandit Naropa encountered the fearsome aspect of theóÀkinÃrightin his office at Nalanda University in north India.

To Naropa,she appeared as a grotesque human lady who was lame and hump-backed with “red and deep-hollowed”eyes, “disheveled”hair, a“large and protruding”forehead, “long and lumpy”ears, a “yellowbeard streaked with white,”and decayed teeth in her sucking,chewing, panting mouth.35The hag demanded an honest evaluation ofhis study; and Naropa realized that his intellect was too dry.

The biography of Naropa lends itself well to apsychoanalytic interpretation after the work of Carl Gustav Jung. AJungian perspective highlights the subjective aspect of theóÀkinÃs’ambivalent nature. From a psychoanalytical point of view, the suddenappearance of a hag over Naropa’s shoulder signals a confrontationwith his anima, a figure from the collective unconscious that appearsto men early in the healthy process of integrating conscious andunconscious psychic contents. As his anima, the decrepit womanshowed the feminine aspect of Naropa’s psyche that was ascending inthe midst of intellectual disappointment. She appeared when the greatscholar became receptive to direct, intuitive awareness of the natureof reality. Once Naropa recognized his lack of intuitive awareness,the hag vanished—as a psychological projection ceases the moment itbecomes conscious. When Naropa was psychologically disposed to experience hisanima projection, the hag appeared to expose a mode of spiritualitythat went beyond his intellectual comprehension. The hag whoinspired Naropa’s quest for direct realization was the first in a seriesof psychic projections experienced by Naropa. In time, he encounterdthree more archetypes of his collective unconscious: the shadow inthe form of numerous ghastly characters; the wise old man in theform of a dark-skinned man; and the cosmic person, in the form of acelestial vision ofguruTilopa.37Accordingly, it might be presumedthat theóÀkinÃis an image derived from the psyche, whose nature isnon-material, and whose function is to enhance non-rational, intuitivepatterns of thought. The biographies of Yeshe Tsogyel, Milarepa, and Naropa showthatóÀkinÃsdo not manifest in the context of subtle, not gross,material experience.

Although theóÀkinÃcorresponds to varioussubjective conditions, a flatly solipsistic interpretation of her nature isdefied.

The multi-valent nature ofóÀkinÃsis indicated here aspsychological, subtle physical, and cosmicdimensions are evidenced.V. ôàkinãand SynchronicityCarl G. Jung’s work on synchronicity provides a framework forunderstanding the function ofóÀkinÃsto promote awareness of (or“arrange”) subtle connections between external events and the   play.In a woman’s psyche, the female figure can be the archetype of the Self, indicatingwholeness and integration. In men’s experience she usually is associated with the animaarchetype. However, the same figure can function in different capacities, and must not bereduced to a single interpretation.For example, with reference to votaries of theEleusinian Mysteries, Jung noted:“[T]he Demeter-Kore myth is far too feminine to have been merely the result of ananima-projection. Although the anima can, as we have said, experience herself inDemeter-Kore, she is yet of a wholly different nature. She [the anima-projection]is inthe highest degreefemme a homme, whereas Demeter-Kore exists on the plane ofmother-daughter experience, which is alien to man and shuts him out. In fact, thepsychology of the Demeter cult bears all the features of a matriarchal order of society,where the man is an indispensablebut on the whole disturbing factor.”[“ThePsychological Aspects of the Kore,”in C. G. Jung and C. Kerenyi,Essays on aScience of Mythology, pp. 156-77, trans. R. F. C. Hull (Princeton: PrincetonUniversity Press, 1973, c. 1949), p. 177.]Supporting the view that feminine figures are notnecessarily anima-projections,Jungian analyst Dora Kalff comments on the significance of the Buddhist Tara and theChristian Black Madonna:When the Black Madonna comes, I usually see this as the first impulse of the goodfeminine. When she appears, then we can guess that the psyche is beginning to growina spiritual direction, spiritual as together with the everyday life, with the body, theearth... Tara and the Black Madonna are the carriers of this development in the psyche.We’re seeing a dawning of the feminine now. Women are beginning to realize that tofollow the man’s way is not working. We must develop our own capacities, notfollow men. The Black Madonna is beginning to break through [in the psyches ofwomen].

The concept ofsynchronicity suits the ambivalent nature ofóÀkinÃswho bridgesubjective and objective dimensions of “reality.”Jung definedsynchronicity as an a-causal connecting principle that integrates aperson with the cosmos.[S]ynchronicity takes the coincidence of events in space and time asmeaning something more than mere chance, namely, a peculiarinterdependence of objective events among themselves as well as with thesubjective (psychic) states of the observer or observers.40[S]ynchronistic phenomena occur, for instance, when an inwardlyperceived event (dream, vision, premonition, etc.) is seen to have acorrespondence in external reality.41Synchronicity refers to a connecting principle that does not pertain tolinear causality. And though the scientific worldview that permeates“western civilization”tends to favor logical empirical explanations,42the Tibetan Buddhist world view incorporates synchronicity into itsunderstanding of events and their meaning.43The life stories oftantric adepts refer to the meaningful confluence of circumstances asrten ‘brel(S:saüyoga), which indicates a combination of interrelatedportentous factors that forms the basis of omens and other meaningfulcoincidences.44In the tantric tradition,óÀkinÃsare readily associated   40See Urubshurow, “Vajrayana Symbols,”p. 70.

Suchopenness was cultivated by Yeshe Tsogyel, Milarepa, and(eventually) Naropa through tantric vizualization practice thatenhanced their imaginations. Vizualization practice heightened theirawareness of color, sound, and other energy patterns, and attunedthem to theóÀkinÃ’spresence.VI. ôàkinãand ImaginationSynchronistic events pertain to non-linear causality. As such, they arerecognized largely by imaginative modes of apprehension. Evidencegleaned from the lives of Yeshe Tsogyel, Milarepa, and Naropasuggests that two complementary modes of imagination are engagedin the encounter withóÀkinÃs. On one hand, the imagination serves asa tool for integrating the mind-body process. On the other hand,   51 Ibid., p. 77.52 Ibid., p. 88. Examples of synchronicity are found also contemporary spiritualbiographies, such as Andrew Harvey’s account of his relationship with the IndianguruMother Meera. Her gestures, appearance, and words readily dovetail into Harvey’sexperience, taking it out of the linear mode. For example, one day Mr. Reddy(uncle anddisciple of Mother Meera) was telling Harvey the story of his first encounter withMother Meera. Just as Mr. Reddy came to the part when Mother Meera entered thestory, Mother Meera actually entered the room. Mr. Reddy then mentioned to MotherMeera the coincidence, whereupon she replied, “That is natural”as a crow from thegarden squeaked louder. Later, Mother Meera’s attendant Adhilakshmi noted, “One dayall the things that seem so wild and strange to you now will seem normal.”AndrewHarvey,Hidden Journey: A Spiritual Awakening(New York: Henry Holt & Co., 1991),p. 75."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"VICTORIA KENNICK URUBSHUROW38imagination promotes synchronistic interaction between person andcosmos.53 In the context of his work on the psychological process ofindividuation, Carl G. Jung used the term “active imagination”todescribe a technique of integrating conscious and unconsciouspsychic contents.54The unconscious and conscious aspects of aperson’s psyche come into dynamic relationship through theappearance of archetypal projections, or images from the collectiveunconscious that show up in imaginative circumstances such asdreams. According to Jung, psychic wholeness is indicated when“active imagination”engenders the archetype of the Self, as a resultof the free-flowing integration of unconscious contents into consciousawareness. For example, the Self archetype was experienced byNaropa as a cosmic person at the climax of his spiritual journey whenTilopa appeared radiant in the sky singing to him of non-duality.55Asthe psyche becomes increasingly integrated, the relationship betweenthe whole psyche and the cosmos becomes increasingly integrated aswell. Once the archetype of the Self manifests, experiences ofsynchronicity tend to arise readily.56The regularity with which tantricadepts participate in synchronous events suggests that their religiouspractice promotes a healthy and balanced management of the psyche. The Jungian paradigm of the psyche with unconscious and   53 To comprehend the complex function of religious imagination, it is useful toconsider three perspectives—the psychological, the (tantric) subtle physical, and themetaphysical. Because of a Buddhist insistence on the interdependence of mind, body,and cosmos some aspects of the non-Buddhist perspectives should be adjusted to suit thetantric adepts’experienceofóÀkinÃs. Yet, the foreign perspectives provide suggestionsthat complement the tantric presentation of religious imagination, and render it morecomprehensible. To enrich the psychological and metaphysical perspectives, some ideasof C. G. Jung and Ibn al-’Arabi are examined here.54 On “active imagination”see, for example, “The Psychic Nature of the AlchemicalWork”(originally published in 1944) in C. G. Jung,Psychology and Alchemy, trans. R.F. C. Hull (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1968), pp. 242-287.55 Guenther,Life and Teachings of Naropa,p.90.56 Describing synchronicity, M-L. von Franz reports that “the older [Dr. Jung]became the more he got the information he needed for whatever he was thinking aboutor was working on; it simply ran after him.”She suggests that Jung’s experience ofsynchronicity was an “experience of expansion, or perhaps itis not even an expansion, ofthe archetype of Self.”Marie-Louise von Franz,Alchemical Active Imagination(Dallas:Spring Publications, 1979), p. 44."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"TIBETAN FAIRY GLIMMERINGS39conscious aspects does not fully accord with the tantric Buddhistpresentation, although the fruits of “active imagination”correspondto some elements of tantric experience. The yogic system does notbifurcate the psyche into known and unknown contents. Rather, itemphasizes the relationship between mental consciousness andactivity of the subtle wind. The appearance ofóÀkinÃsis associatedwith the force of wind entering and dissolving into the centralchannel. The clarity and enduring quality of the appearance ofóÀkinÃsdepends upon the extent to which the adept has gainedproficiency in tantric practice of vizualization and movement ofwinds.57When the subtle wind courses freely through the centers and   57 See the section onôÀkinÃas Subtle Windabove, where the appearance ofóÀkinÃsto tantric adepts is discussed in terms of meditative stabilization that results from subtlewind entering into the central channel. Commenting on the experience of meditativestabilization (S:samÀdhi;T:ting nge ‘dzin), Geshe Gedun Lodro identifies threecircumstances that give rise to “pure appearances.”:“(1) Sometimes, through the force of winds’entering into channels in which theyusually do not course, appearances arise that do not occur otherwise. There arevarious good and bad appearances. Some people have hallucinations orgo crazy, andthere are many cases of pure appearances dawning for such people.(2) There is a dawning to the mind of meditative visions....[S]uch an appearancewould be due to the force of that person’s familiarity with meditative stabilization. Itwould occur not only during the session but outside italso, without the person’s evenseeking to think about [it]....Such appearances are spontaneous. They are innate andlike our usual appearances but are such that they would start to disappear uponanalysis, whereas, without too much attention, they are very clear. Such appearancesoccur without a person’s specific intention, in the course of usual activities. (3) The third type of pure appearance is of a sense consciousness actually perceivingpure appearances. For example, people speak of seeing the face of a deity; this meansthat they see the deity, not just the face. It might be said that a certain person has seenthe face of the goddess Sarasvati. This is a case of his or her directly seeing the deitywith the eye consciousness.”[Geshe Gedun Lodro,Walking Through Walls: APresentation of Tibetan Meditation, trans. and ed. Jeffrey Hopkins (New York: SnowLion Publications, 1992), pp. 252-53.]Geshe GedunLodro does not speak specifically ofóÀkinÃs, nor does he explain themeans by which the third type of appearance (by sense consciousness) is produced. Yet,we can presume that Yeshe Tsogyel, Milarepa, and Naropa experienced pureappearances due to their intensive practice of Highest Yoga Tantra which “causes thewinds to enter and dissolve into the central channel.”[Ibid., pp. 254-55.] Due to theirreputed greatness, we might also presume that they experienced pure appearances byway of the sense consciousness.The distinction between meditative visions and sensory perceptions of pure"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"VICTORIA KENNICK URUBSHUROW40channels of the adept’s body a spontaneous intuitive awareness arisesthat perceives the cosmos as amaõóalain which synchronous eventsare normal. To describe the connection between the workings of the mind-body process and the synchronous events promoted byóÀkinÃsit isuseful to turn to the concept of “creative imagination,”a type ofimagination that links the integrated subject with the cosmos. HenryCorbin, based on his study of the Muslim mystic Ibn al-Arabi (1165-1240), used the term “creative imagination”to describe a function ofperception correlated with a visionary world.58Despite discrepanciesbetween Buddhist and Muslim metaphysics, the treatment ofimagination by Ibn al-Arabi suggests one way in which theóÀkinÃsexperienced by tantric adepts can be understood. Corbin notes thatcreative imagination is distinct from the operation of fantasy oraesthetic creation. It isa faculty of perception and mediation very different from thedemonstrative or historical reasoning which judges the sensible and finitedata relating to rationally defined dogmas or to the irreversible events ofmaterial history.59According to Corbin, this perception exposes an imaginal realm thatis not generally accessed through the senses. It brings to light amystic geography of the body, and beings of an imaginal worldthrough the operation of a special human organ of perception. Ibn al-’Arabi makes a distinction between contiguous imagination(Arabic:al-khayal al-muttasil) and discontiguous imagination(Arabic:al-khayal al-mutlaq) that is helpful in thinking about theappearance ofóÀkinÃs. He speaks of the imagination (Arabic:khayal)   appearances parallels a distinction made by the Muslim mystic Ibn al-Arabi (1165-1240)who speaks of an intermediate world of “discontiguous imagination”that existsindependently of the viewer, and a faculty of “contiguous imagination”connected to theviewing subject. See discussion below.58 On “creative imagination”see Henry Corbin,Creative Imagination in the Sufism ofIbn ‘Arabi, trans Ralph Manheim (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1969); Ibid.,“Mundus Imaginalis,”or the Imaginary and the Imaginal,”trans. Ruth Horine,Spring:An Annual of Archetypal Psychology and Jungian Thought(1972), pp. 1-19.

If you say concerning it that it is existent,you will have spoken the truth, and if you say it is nonexistent, you willhave spoken the truth. If you say that it is neither existent nor nonexistent,you will have spoken the truth. It is imagination, and it has two states: astate of contiguity, which it possesses through man and certain animals,and a state of discontiguity. To the latter outward perception becomesconnected while remaining separate from it in actual fact, as in the case ofGabriel’s appearance in the form of Dihya [Kalbi, a beautiful humancontemporary of the Prophet], or a jinn or an angel which becomesmanifest from the world of curtaining. The difference between contiguous imagination and discontiguousimagination is that the contiguous kind disappears with the disappearanceof the imaginer, while the discontiguous kind is an autonomous presence,constantly receptive toward meanings and spirits. It embodies them inaccordance with its own characteristics, nothing else. Contiguousimagination derives from the discontiguous kind.60The Tibetan tantric worldview recognizes both discontiguous andcontiguous aspects of imagination in relation toóÀkinÃs, who arecentral to the imaginative process of deciphering “twilight language.”A contemporary Buddhist commentator explains:[T]he “twilight language”is an actual cipher which can only beunderstood by those blessed by the wisdomóÀkinÃ. The way the languageis translated is not with a dictionary and a grammar book, but through“another way of knowing”which comes from a space which is far fromthe sunlit rational world dominated by the logos, and at the same time it isnot from the dark abyss of the unconscious but rather a twilight worldwhere another function of the mind is possible. This is not merely theintuitive part of the mind, because even very sensitive people cannotunderstand the language of theóÀkinÃ. It is a realm governed by theóÀkinÃs, and only those who can integrate into the symbolic world of theóÀkinÃcan understand their half-concealed language.61From the perspective of tantric yoga, the mystic geography of thesubtle mind/body process and theóÀkinÃsare viewed as   60Chittick,The Sufi Path of Knowledge, p. 117.61 Tsultrim Allione,Women of Wisdom(London and New York: Arkana, 1984,reprint 1984), p. 44."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"VICTORIA KENNICK URUBSHUROW42interdependent.62In Ibn al-’Arabi’s terms it might be said that tantricadepts encounteróÀkinÃsin the contiguous imagination, while theóÀkinÃsmaintain a kind of autonomous presence—with their owncharacteristics in their own land—in the discontiguous imagination.The adepts cultivate an intuitive spontaneous awareness through thecontiguous imagination, and the cosmos responds withóÀkinÃpresences through the discontiguous imagination. In the Tibetan context, the double-edged creative imagination isevidenced in relation to the generation of so-called “self-arisen”(T:rang jung) deities whose figures appear in rocks. Causes governingthe appearance ofóÀkinÃsmay be a parallel phenomenon. JournalistChina Galland inquired after a peculiar self-arisen figure of Taragrowing from a rock in the Himalayas at Pharping from a height ofsome four inches to a height of ten or twelve inches. In response toher queries, a Tibetan lama replied: “Is it so strange to imagine thatthe mind when concentrated could do this....The power of devotioncalls Tara out of the rock, yes?”63When asked whether or not hebelieved in “this Tara growing out of the rock at Pharping”the DalaiLama elaborated as follows:“Oh yes. These things depend on many factors, many. . . . There’s a greatsort of interrelationship between the appropriateness of the time, theplace, and also a person intimately related to it. All these factors must betaken into account. When suitable people remain there, the image   62The degree of “objectivity”accorded to visionary appearances, and toconventionally existing objects is debated among the MahÀyÀna Buddhist Mind Onlyand Middle Way philosophers, in the climate of whose assumptions the tantric adeptsseek enlightenment. However, the principle of interdependence is commonly accepted,regardless of whether theemphasis is placed upon the perceiving agent or upon theinteraction between the perceiving agent and a world that conventionally exists.The Mind Only/Middle Way debate over the degree of objective existence ofperceived phenomena is left unresolved in the life stories of Yeshe Tsogyel, Milarepa,and Naropa. The status ofóÀkinÃsin thernam thartexts remains ambiguous, as the genreprefers narrative and poetry to philosophical argument. Yet, the authenticity of tantricadepts’experience ofóÀkinÃsis seriously presented, regardless of their ambiguity.63 China Galland,Longing for Darkness: Tara and the Black Madonna, A Ten YearJourney(Penguin Books: New York, 1990), p. 65. Galland is quoting Cho Kyi NyimaRimpoche."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"TIBETAN FAIRY GLIMMERINGS43remains. When there are no more suitable people there, the image alsodisappears.”64The case of the self-arisen images suggests that the devotees of Taraengage their faculty of contiguous imagination, to which the deityappears. Her form “called out of the rock”derives from thediscontiguous imagination. Likewise, theóÀkinÃsare semi-automonous presences of the discontiguous imagination that appearto the contiguous imagination of tantric adepts.ôÀkinÃsand self-arisen images have an esoteric nature because anadept mustinteractwith them through the contiguous imagination.Milarepa said:To him who sees the mind’s natureAnd dispels the mists of ignorance,TheôÀkinÃsshow their faces.65Tantric adepts to whom theóÀkinÃsshow their faces open themselvesto the experience by means of exacting techniques. The tantric method of developing the contiguous imaginationinvolves an intensive practice of visualization. During visualizationan adept mentally constructs in detail the form and color of holybeings on the basis of canonical paintings. The figure is mentallyconstructed in conjunction with verbal recitation of sacred syllablesand the performance of prescribed physical gestures. This exercise ofbody, speech, and mind leads to meditative stabilization with themovement of subtle wind into the adept’s central channel. By theforce of the wind’s so entering, various “pure appearances”dawn.66Andrew Harvey’s Tibetan lama explained the nature of visualizationpractice as follows:At first you will find the process of visualization hard. You have not beentrained to it. You have been trained in a materialist way of imagining andseeing, which has its beauties and precisions, but has not accustomed youto the kind of inner projection that I am asking you to do....You mustwork every day. You must not be discouraged if for many months youcan visualize very little. What you are beginning is a journey into adifferent world, into an awareness of a different reality; you cannot expect   64 Ibid., p. 94.65 Chang,Songs, p. 661.66 See note 57 above."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"VICTORIA KENNICK URUBSHUROW44to make that journey quickly. Nor, in a sense should you want to. Thejourney itself has its joys; the hardness of the journey has its lessons also,of perseverance and trust and humility, which you will need to learn.67VII.ConclusionMore than a break from the everyday imagination or a technicalmastery of subtle winds is needed to participate fully in what AndrewHarvey’s Tibetan teacher called a “different reality”—or theimaginative universe (including contiguous and discontiguousaspects) described by Ibn al-’Arabi. Communion withóÀkinÃsinvolves numerous trials and transformations—details of which arefound not only in Tibetan tales of liberation, but also in accounts ofshamanic and mystic initiation.68An overhaul of the personality, a re-orientation to the world at large, and the growth of sensitivity to thecosmic condition are requisite for spiritual maturity. Initiatory transformation is demanding. So, it is not surprising thatmost people do not seeóÀkinÃs. For instance, Yeshe Tsogyel wasrecognized by tantric adepts as aóÀkinÃin human form.69Yet, in spiteof this glamorous nature, she endured considerable abuse from peopleseeking to take advantage of her as a mere woman. Yeshe Tsogyelencountered thieves, rapists, and other violent men who could notimmediately discern her transcendent aspect. Thus, whileóÀkinÃsareintimates to the adepts, they remain unrecognized by others. Andthough William Butler Yeats and his friends on the Irish countrysideencountered the Little People, most of his compatriots—believing ornot—never saw any fairies. Recall Stith Thompson’s observation that   67 Andrew Harvey,A Journey in Ladakh(First published, Great Britain: WilliamCollins & Sons, 1983); (London: Flamingo/Fontana Paperbacks, 1988), p. 234.68 One might like to call Naropa, Yeshe Tsogyel, and Milarepa “mystics”whodeepen their realization of Buddhist views through meditation. However, with regard toóÀkinÃencounters, their experiences are reminiscent of shamanic initiations, whichinclude periods of great physical debility, celestial journeys, visions of spirits (óÀkinÃs),use of a secret language, and so on. The question of the relationship between mystic andshamanic initiation is an interesting one; but shall not be taken up here. On shamanicpatterns of initiation see Mircea Eliade,Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy,trans. Willard R. Trask (New York: Pantheon Books,1964), pp. 110-144.69 Dowman,Sky Dancer, p. 224. Tantric adepts continue to see Yeshe Tsogyel as amanifestation of Vajra Yogini, who is accessible to the creative imagination throughvisualization practice."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"TIBETAN FAIRY GLIMMERINGS45“[f]airies are normally invisible to the generality of men.”70 While the fairy tales and traditions familiar to Stith Thompson tellhow “particular individuals may secure a magic soap or ointmentwhich permits them to see the little folk”or tell how it is “sometimespossible to have a view of them...by treading on someone else’sfoot,”71the Tibetan tales of liberation tell how theóÀkinÃsareencountered through tantric practice. Now we ask: How is it thatfairies in European literature are known through magic, whereasfairies in Tibetan literature are known through meditation? Whataccounts for the disparity between “magic soap”and “meditativestabilization of calm abiding”? How can one compare the act of“treading on someone else’s foot”with dissolving subtle wind in thecentral channel of a tantric adept’s body? The discrepancy between the naive magic of a fairy tale and theprofound tradition of highest yoga tantra is resolved when onerealizes a fact of culture noted by Rene Guenon: “[M]agic—wemight even say sorcery—is the last thing to be left behind whentraditions disappear.”72The fairy and her symbolism have beendegraded in the west, along with other traditional symbolisms.Speaking of the “language of the birds”or “angelic language”Guenon observes what also applies in the case of the fairy:[H]ow inept it is to make fun of stories that speak of the ‘language of thebirds.’It is all too easy and too simple to disdain as ‘superstitions’everything one cannot understand; but the ancients themselves knew verywell what they meant when they used symbolic language. The truesuperstition in the strictly etymological sense (quod superstat) is whatoutlives itself, that is, the ‘dead letter’; but this survival, however lackingin interest it may seem, is nonetheless not so totally insignificant, for theSpirit that ‘bloweth where it listeth’(and when it listeth) can always cometo breathe fresh life into the symbols and the rites and give them backtheir lost meaning and the fullness of their original virtue.73The Tibetan tales of liberation provide a vital perspective on the   70 See note 9 above.71 Thompson,Folktale, p. 247.72 Rene Guenon, “The Language of the Birds”inThe Sword of Gnosis: Metaphysics,Cosmology, Tradition, Symbolism, pp. 299-303, ed. Jacob Needleman (London: Arkana,1974), p. 303.73 Ibid."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"VICTORIA KENNICK URUBSHUROW46nature and function of fairies—a perspective largely eclipsed in thetales of western culture. Yet, William Butler Yeats and some of hisfriends had not lost access to the fairies. Although they were nottrained as tantric yogis, those Irish explorers of legendary fairy landsmade use of the contiguous imagination accessible to all humanbeings. Twenty-two years after his encounter with the fairy queen(about which we spoke at the outset), Yeats appended a note to hisaccount stating that his use of the word “trance”to describe themental state of the young woman who summoned the fairies wasmisleading. He said:The word ‘trance’gives a wrong impression. I had learned fromMacGregor Mathers and his pupils to so suspend the will that theimagination moved of itself. The girl was, however, fully entranced, andthe man so affected by her that he heard the children’s voices as if withhis physical ears. On two occasions, later on, her trance so affected methat I also heard or saw some part of what she did as if with physical eyesand ears.74Perhaps for those who exercise only a gross material imagination thefairy has disappeared. Perhaps for those who accord hegemony to theintellect and ask too many questions the fairy has disappeared. Is thissacred presence in danger of being lost forever to human awareness?In the west, can fresh life be blown into the symbols and rites toretrieve the lost meaning and fullness of the fairy’s original virtue? Conversing with folklorist Evans Wentz in the early part of thiscentury John Davies, an herb seller of Balsalla steeped in Celtictradition suggested—in his own way—that modern education hascontributed to the breakdown of the contiguous imagination, but notto the breakdown of the discontiguous imagination:Before education came into the island. . . more people could see thefairies; now very few people can see them. But theyare as thick on theIsle of Man as ever theywere.. . . There are as many kinds of fairies aspopulations in our world. I have seen some who were about two and ahalf feet high; and some who were as big as we are.75Although aspects of modern education hinder the contiguous   74 Yeats,Mythologies, p. 55, n. 2.

Oddly enough, from time to time the ethereal feminineappears to break out of the discontiguous imagination. As a fluke sheshows herself in the everyday world. But without cultivation of thecontiguous imagination it is not possible to maintain communionwith her. In closing, let us consider the ancient Greek goddess Demeter,who for nine days was so overcome with grief at the rape of herdaughter that her body wrinkled up. In nine days she turned into anold hag, and the ground withered with her. No plants issued forthuntil the fruit of her womb Persephone was recovered from theunderworld. After recovering her daughter, who was thenceforthobliged to spend certain months of each year in the underworld,Demeter demonstrated a rite that became the basis of the Eleusinianmysteries, inaugurated in the fifteenth century BCE. The rites werecelebrated for nearly two thousand years, until the king of the Goths(Alaric) burned the sanctuary at Eleusis in 396 CE, marking the“official”end of paganism. In Eleusis an uncanonized Saint Demetracontinued to be venerated by peasants who ritually covered her withflowers to insure fertility of their fields. In 1820 the statue wasforcibly removed, and then presented to Cambridge University.76 Did the goddess Demeter perish with the demise of the Eleusinianmysteries? Have the Celtic Little People vanished? Are theóÀkinÃsbound to be forgotten? Mircea Eliade recounts the following episode,reported by the Athenian press in February 1940:At one of the bus stops between Athens and Corinth there came on boardan old woman, “thin and dried up but with very big and keen eyes.”Sinceshe had no money to pay her fare, the driver made her leave the bus at thenext stop—which was, precisely, Eleusis. But the driver could not get themotor started again; finally the passengers decided to chip in and pay theold woman’s fare. She got back on board, and this time the bus set off.Then the old woman said to them: “You ought to have done it sooner, butyou are egoists; and, since I am among you I will tell you something else:you will be punished for the way you live, you will be deprived even ofplants and water!”She had not finished threatening them,”the author of   76 See Mircea Eliade,A History of Religious Ideas, 3 vols., Willard Trask, (trans.)(Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1982), vol. 2. p. 415."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"VICTORIA KENNICK URUBSHUROW48the article published inHestiagoes on, “before she vanished....No onehad seen her get out.

As long as the human imagination does notdie, the ethereal feminine can recover the fullness of her originalvirtue.BIBLIOGRAPHYAllione, Tsultrim.Women of Wisdom.

Even thoughthe first approach may be effective in raising our awareness aboutpast injustices to women, I find that such an orientation onlyreplicates the misogynist attitude of a given tradition by repeating it.However, I find the second approach advantageous in that it helps usreconstruct a given tradition by exploring the various ways in whichwomen’s lives have shaped and defined its very nature.

To this end, I explain the divine as a femalebody of which women, earth, and the Goddess are but differentmanifestations. Further, I explain an embodied religion as that inwhich the presence of this female body of women, earth, and theGoddess is celebrated rather than denied. In what follows, I arguethat it is the female body which provides meaning, form, andcoherence to religious beliefs, acts, and relations that otherwise seemdisparate, like some loosely woven threads of a cord. Since Indiantraditions do not readily make a distinction between “religion”and“philosophy”we will use the phrase “embodied religion”to refer toboth philosophy and religion. In Section I, I discuss issues of interpretation and context, andoffer definitions of some key concepts such as woman’s own nature(strÃsvabhÀva) and woman’s religion (strÃdharma). Here, theconcepts of woman’s own nature and woman’s religion are defined interms of menstruation, and it is argued that menstruation which iswoman’s own nature can also be construed as woman’s religion. Theaim here is to forge a link between the notions of female embodimentand religion. Thus I hope to move away from the prevalentliberationist interpretation which explains the notion of woman’sreligion in terms of social duties - the fulfilment of which leads towomen’s liberation (mokùa). Section II explains the principle of interconnectedness of allexistences as the Goddess principle and argues that it forms the basisof the Goddess culture of India. In this part relying on thetheagraphyof theØÀkta-Hindu places of pilgrimage and worship (×Àkta-pÃñhas),and the fieldwork done by anthropologist Frederique Apffel-Marglinand Purna Chandra Misra, I argue that the interrelatedness which is ahallmark of the Goddess culture is not some abstract philosophicalprinciple but a lived reality which is manifested in interpersonalsocial relations, in humans’relation to their environment, and to thelarger cosmic whole. This part, then, addresses the ecologicalconcern of feminist spirituality. Section III of this essay is concerned about the meaning of thereligious (dhÀrmic) activities. It is argued that according to theØÀkta-Hindu tradition, religious acts and events attain fruition only whenperformed as worship of the female body of the women-earth-Goddess. As one texts put it, “Where women are not worshipped"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"KARTIKEYA C. PATEL52there the activities do not attain fruition. The one who worships(praises) woman, worships (praises) the Goddess and so worships thethree worlds”(Nene 1970, 3.56, and Krishnamacharya 1959, 43.64).1The aim of this part is to articulate the notion of religion as abeneficial direction—a direction which suggests that respect for andworship of the female body leads to the collective happiness ofpeople. Let us begin with certain facts which any satisfactory explanationof the notion of the sacredness of the female in the Hindu traditionmust take into account. First, as Arvind Sharma argues, there aresome obvious problems in defining Hinduism (Sharma 1993, 5).Hinduism is not a tradition, but rather a blanket term invented toaccount for various traditions, e.g.VedÀnta,Øaiva,Vaiùõava,ØÀkta,etc. To a large extent these various traditions presuppose thescriptural authority of the Vedas and to some extent theDharma×Àstras.Yet,eachtraditionembodiesadifferentinterpretation of these texts, reflecting the sociocultural milieu inwhich it thrived, as well as the interpretive interests of the traditionitself. In this essay, I explain the nature of the divine as femininefrom aØÀkta Hindu perspective. For aØÀkta-Hindu, the scripturalinjunctions, rites and rituals attain fruition only when construed asworship of the feminine. Second, there are numerous variables, for example, linguistic,social, rural, urban, and so on, which complicate the task of inter-preting Hindu beliefs, rites, and rituals. These variables play animportant role in determining the meaning of these beliefs, rites, andrituals for a given stratum of society. Thus, people at different levelsof social strata may have a very different understanding of thespecific rites and rituals that explain the nature of reality as feminine.For instance, Richard Shweder’s and Frederique Apffel-Marglin’sinvestigations reveal that the Brahmins of Orissa have an altogetherdifferent understanding of the menstruation rituals than the farmers ofOrissa have (Shweder 1991, 241-265, and Apffel-Marglin 1991a and1991b). For these reasons, if we do not take into account the variable-1The translations in this essay are my own unless otherwise indicated."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"WOMEN, EARTH AND THE GODDESS53bound context, we cannot possibly offer an empirical definition of thenotion of the feminine. Third, as Marla Powers (1980) has argued, the contemporaryanalysis of the rites, rituals, and beliefs of a non-Western societyoften has a Western cultural bias. However, an explanation based onWestern presuppositions does not provide us with a correct analysis.This is so since the conceptual framework, social constructs,necessitating interpersonal relations, and roads for spiritualfulfillment of a non-Western society strikingly differ from those of aWestern society. To avoid the problem of misinterpretation, I propose a frameworkin which our conceptual claims can be measured against the livedreality of the beliefs, rites, and rituals which are presently underconsideration. To accomplish this, I propose to use the fieldworkdone by Frederique Apffel-Marglin in collaboration with PurnaChandra Misra in the Indian state of Orissa as a yardstick againstwhich the conceptual claims made in this essay can be criticallyevaluated (Apffel-Marglin and Misra 1991a, and 1991b). This moveis also useful in delimiting the scope of this essay to a given stratumof society. Finally, I use various Hindu works in this essay whichprovide a common theme but belong to different historical times andtraditions within theØÀkta-Hindu tradition.IOne way to go about the search for definitions of the key concepts isto find out from a contextual point of view what the notions ofwoman, female, and feminine mean in theØÀktauniverse ofdiscourse. To this end, I begin with the concept of woman’s ownnature. Etymologically, the Sanskrit termstrÃsvabhÀvaconsists ofstrÃ(woman), andsvabhÀva(one’s own nature), meaning thereby, awoman’s own nature.2The term, “a woman’s own nature”can bebest explained as some essential quality naturally belonging to anentity or being which is asine qua noncharacteristic of the entity inquestion. It can be contrasted with what is artificially created.2The2 For instance, in the sentence “sa tasya svo bhÀvaþ prakçtiniyatvÀdakçtakaþ”"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"KARTIKEYA C. PATEL54term “a woman’s own nature”has been variously defined in differenttexts and has no single applicable meaning. It has been variouslydefined in terms of mobility (cala), good fortune, and menstruation.For instance, theMahÀbhÀratadefines a woman’s nature in terms ofmobility when it says, “Women are by nature mobile, difficult toprovide unconditional service to, their very qualities difficult tocomprehend; as are the uttered sentences of the wise men so arewomen”(Sukthankar 1933-39, XII, ch. 38, verse 24). This passage isimportant since it recognizes the difficulty of comprehending anddefining woman’s nature. But still it attempts to define it, in part, interms of mobility. This attempt has some validity because accordingto Hinduism, a man (puruùa) by nature is said to be still, immobileand cannot function or perform any activity without a woman(prakçti). Thus in theØiva PurÀõa,PÀrvatÃsays toØiva,“With myblessings you become qualitative and embodied. Without me, you areattributeless and incompetent to perform any activity. Being alwayssubservient toprakçtiyou perform all activities”(Shastri 1970, III,ch. 13, verses 19-20). In a similar vein, the sage NÀrada says toRÀma, “Listen, RÀma, She is always eternal, primeval, andeverlasting. Nothing is able to stir without her aid”(Radhakrishnan1969, 83). The notion of a woman’s own nature has also been defined interms of menstruation. Thus in a sentence such as “Sixteen nights areknown to women, for whom, menstruation is own nature”(çtuþsvÀbhÀvikaþ strÃõÀ§rÀtrayaþ ùoóa×asmçtÀþ, Kale 1982, ch. 3, verse46) a woman’s nature is defined in terms of the essential quality ofbeing a woman, that is, menstruation (çtu). However, menstruationitself is a loaded category in contemporary discourse and requiresfurther explanation. In contemporary discourse, we often define“woman”as a biological entity, “female”as a cultural concept, and“feminine”as a psychological attribute. But if we use this frameworkthen we have to characterize menstruation as anessentialqualitywhich separates the concept of female from that of the woman andfeminine. This is so because we tend to regard menstruation only as a   (UttararÀmacarita6.14) one’s own nature which is constituted as such by nature iscontrasted with what is artificially created."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"WOMEN, EARTH AND THE GODDESS55biological fact. It is in this sense that some contemporary writers, forexample, Julia Leslie, have tried to explain the notion of a woman’sown nature (Leslie 1989, 8). For aØÀkta-Hindu, however, menstruation is not simply abiological fact, and for that reason it cannot be separated from theconcepts of women, female, and the feminine, or for that matter, fromwhat is cultural, psychological, and biological. Nor can it be used toseparate the notions of “female,” “feminine,”and “woman”fromeach other. For aØÀkta-Hindu menstruation (çtu) is a holisticconcept. It is a religion (dharma). The termçtu, which signifiesmenstruation, also signifies the cyclical changes of the seasons aswell as orderliness in the cosmos. Thus, it is believed that themenstrual cycle in the female body corresponds to, and represents,the cyclical change of the seasons and the orderliness in the universe.A woman’sçtudharmais thus said not only to interrelate andintegrate the concepts of woman, female, and feminine but also tointerrelate humans to their environment, and to the socio-culturalreality in which their rites and rituals attain fruition. The concept ofçtudharmaneeds further explanation because as one of thedharmas,it carries the ambiguity and plasticity that the notion ofdharmagenerally carries. The termdharmahas been used in a variety of ways in Hinduliterature. The three primary senses in which the termdharmais usedare: (1) a rule (niyama) thatenforcesa law-like structure; (2) adirection given to the members of a society to sustain continuity inthe cosmos and to fulfill their individual functions so that collectiveactions may attain fruition; and (3) a duty that the individual has inorder to attain liberation. Although the third sense has been used inmost philosophical works, it is in the first two senses that I will beusing the termdharmain this essay. The use of the termdharmain the first two senses is compatiblewith the texts as well as with the contemporary usage of the term. Ifwe combine the first two senses, we can interpret the concept ofdharmain a slightly different way. We can say that it is a beneficialdirection given to the members of a society to maintain a law-likestructure in the cosmos and to attain the fruits of some collective"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"KARTIKEYA C. PATEL56action geared toward maintaining continuity and orderliness in thatsociety.3 Thus defined,dharmaconsists of a set of beneficial directions tothe individuals, or groups which are conducive to the attainment andfulfillment of collective human goals. Adharma-based society issuesdirections to its members so that human endeavors may attainfruition. It is believed that if an individual’sdharmais observed, itleads to the collective fruition of human goals. Conversely, if an individual’sdharmais not respected, chaos andpossible destruction follow. In this sense, respect for, and observanceof, a woman’s own nature would lead to the attainment of humangoals; conversely, if it is not respected, chaos and total annihilationmay follow.4For example, when brought into the assembly hall whilestill menstruating, DraupadÃasks, “If you permit these faults in thepresence of the elders, my father-in-law, will the rain fall? Will theworld survive?”(Hiltebeitel 1988, 265). To conclude, menstruation, which is both woman’sdharmaandwoman’s nature is not simply a biological fact and for that reasondoes not allow us to reify the reality of women’s being intowoman/female/feminine. It is adhÀrmicepisode that provides uswith a choreography in which collective acts and events oftheological/philosophicalandcosmologicalsignificanceattainfruition. This point will be further explained in Section III.IIIn recent feminist work, it has been consistently argued that theinseparabilityofallexistences,theirinterrelatednessandinterconnection is the cornerstone of feminist ways of looking atreality.5InthisSectionIarguethatthisprincipleofinterconnectedness, the inter-relatedness of the elements to oneanother, forms the basis of the Goddess culture of India. In what3 It is in this sense that Jaimini definesdharmaascodanÀlakùaõo’rtho dharmaþ,i.e.dharmaconsists in beneficial directions (NyÀyaratna 1889, 1.1.2).4 Manu seems to express the same idea when he says, “When violated,dharmadestroys, when preserved,dharmapreserves, thereforedharmashould not beviolated, lest violateddharmadestroy us.”(Nene 1970, 8.15).5 For a comprehensive account from a western perspective, see, Keller (1986)."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"WOMEN, EARTH AND THE GODDESS57follows, with the help of fieldwork done by anthropologistFrederique Apffel-Marglin in collaboration with Purna Chandra Mis-ra, I contend that the interrelatedness is not confined to abstractphilosophizing: it is realised in interpersonal social relations and inpeople’s relationship to the environment and the larger cosmic whole. There is a vast array of literature in theØÀkta-Hindu tradition thatexplains the nature of the Goddess as an eternal all-pervading reality,manifesting herself in different and diverse but interrelated aspects ofthe world.6This interrelatedness of all existences is first explained byGÀrgÃ, a woman philosopher of circa 800 BCE, in a dialogue with thefamous Indian philosopher YÀjñavalkya. The dialogue itself is presented in an interesting way. WhereasWestern scholars traditionally present Indian women as silent, orwith a subdued and submissive voice, this dialogue presents GÀrgÃasa flamboyant, outspoken woman whose only concern is theknowledge of truth. GÀrgÃopens the dialogue with two questions.The questions that GÀrgÃasks are about the interconnectedness ofdifferent elements of the universe. Her philosophical thesis orproposition (pratijñÀ) characteristically exhibits her belief in theinterconnectedness of this universe. She says, “Since all that is here iswoven, like warp and woof,”(yad idam sarvam....otam ca protam ca)what is it that weaves everything together?”(Radhakrishnan, 1969,BçhadÀraõyaka Upaniùadch. 3, verse 6). GÀrgÃargues that the air, water, sky, the worlds of theGandharvas, the worlds of the sun, the worlds of the moon, theworlds of the stars, the worlds of the gods, the worlds of Indra, theworlds of PrajÀpati, the worlds of BrahmÀare all interwoven and heldtogether by a single principle. Nothing exists disparately. She asks,“That, O YÀjñavalkya, of which they say, it is above the heaven, it isbeneath the earth, that which the people call the past, the present andthe future, across what is that woven, like warp and woof?”(Radhakrishnan 1969,BçhadÀraõyaka Upaniùad3.6.1; 3.8.1-12).GÀrgÃ’s main concern is to inquire about the nature of reality which6 TheDevÃ-MÀhÀtmya,DevÃ-sÅktaofègveda,ÂnandalaharÃ,LalitÀ-SahasranÀma,LakùmÃTantra, andDevÃ-Rahasyaare some of the main Hindu textsin which the Goddess is explained as a principle that interrelates and interconnectsdifferent elements of life."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"KARTIKEYA C. PATEL58appears to be a unitive whole, according to a principle transcendentbut at the same time immanent. When YÀjñavalkya eventually repliesthat it is by the indestructible that everything manifested in space iswoven like warp and woof, GÀrgÃ’s endeavor to establish the thesis ofinterrelatedness is accomplished. Only at this point does she becomesilent. It could be argued that the principle that interconnects andinterrelates different existences of the world is really the principle ofBrahman rather than the Goddess principle. Thus, when YÀjñavalkyasays that the indestructible binds and weaves all disparate elementshe could be interpreted as talking about Brahman. This would be ofcourse one commonly accepted way of looking at the dialogue. Andindeed it is in this sense that YÀjñavalkya himself explains the natureof the indestructible reality. In some Hindu texts, however, theindestructible reality is construed as the Goddess principle. Such aninterpretation is not entirely off the mark in light of some of the earlyVedic hymns that attempt to construct the pre-Upaniùadic world-viewas the Goddess principle. For instance, theDevÃsÅktaofègvedaconstrues this world-view in terms of goddess VÀc, the daughter ofsage Ambhçõa, as pervading the entire reality as a connected whole.She says:It is I who move in the form of the Rudras, the Vasus, the âdityas and allthe other gods; I support both Mitra and Varuna, Agni and Indra, and thetwo Ashvins. I support the foe-destroying Soma, Tvashtri, Påsàn and Bha-ga; I bestow on the Institutor of the sacrifice, ready with oblations andoffering homage to the gods.I am the sovereign power (over all the worlds),...and the first amongthose to whom sacrificial homage is to be offered; the gods in all placesworship but me, who am diverse in form and permeate everything.Whoever eats food, or sees, or breathes, or hears what is spoken, does itthrough me.I pervade heaven and earth. I give birth to the infinite expanse over-spreading the earth. I transcend the heaven above, I transcend the earthbelow. (Griffith 1920-26, 10.125) Moreover, other Hindu texts argue that Brahman itself is amanifestation of the Goddess, that all attributes predicated of Brahmanare really the predicates of the great Goddess. In theØrÃDevyatharva×Ãrùa,an Upaniùadic text, it is argued that all existencesare the manifestation of the Goddess who is the nature of Brahman."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"WOMEN, EARTH AND THE GODDESS59The text says:Aum, all gods went near the Goddess and asked her, “O great goddess(Mahàdevã) who art thou?”She said: I am the nature of the Brahman.Puruùa and Prakçti are born of me. This (world)- empty and not-empty -isborn of me.I am the veda and also what is outside the veda. I am knowledge and Iam ignorance, that which isajaandanaja,and that which is above andbeneath and on all sides is the manifestation of me. (Kalyàõ 1987, verses 2and 4)In a similar vein, other texts such as theDevÃ-MÀhÀtmyaargue for thevarious ways in which the goddess makes herself known, stating thatthe goddess is manifested as intelligence (buddhi), energy (×akti),peace (×Ànti), compassion (dayÀ), prosperity (lakùmÃ), instinct (vçtti),etc. The great Goddess embraces in her manifestations both theanimate and inanimate, seen and unseen worlds. The thesis thateverything is interrelated and that this interrelation is grounded in theGoddess principle may be termedmetaphysical feminism.7Metaphysical feminism accepts the Goddess principle as the ultimatereality that binds together different and disparate elements of reality. Critics of metaphysical feminism have objected that, from the ideathat there is an ultimate reality and that there is a principle whichinterconnects and interrelates different elements, it does not followthat this ultimate reality is feminine in nature. For example, ThomasCoburn says:[T]he DM [Devã-Màhàtmya] does not argue that ultimate reality is femi-nine...Feminine motifs are, of course, pervasive of the DM. But insofar asthe DM is concerned to `demonstrate’anything, it is that ultimate reality isreally ultimate, not that it is feminine. (Coburn 1990, 3)This line of argument has some validity since in the Western sense ofthe term “feminine”there is nothing substantial inDevÃ-MÀhÀtmyawhich would suggest that the ultimate reality is feminine in nature.However, if one means by “feminine”that which pertains to thecultural, psychological, and physical modes of expression ofwomen’s being, then one can arguably say that theDevÃ-MÀhÀtmya7 In contemporary literature the word has been used in a variety of ways. Onemay refer to Morgan (1982), and Walker (1989)."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"KARTIKEYA C. PATEL60propounds the nature of reality which is feminine in nature. Not onlydoes the text describe and explain the goddess as feminine, thevidhi(that is to say, the ritual) preceding the traditional readingDevÃ-MÀhÀtmyamandates the invocation of the Goddess in the form of tengirls. The text says:Two-year-old girl is known as Kumàrã, three-year-old as Trimårti, four-year-old as Kalyàõã, five-year-old as Rohiõã, six-year-old as Kàlikà, seven-year-old as Caõóãkà, eight-year-old as Sàmbhavã, nine-year-old as Durgà,and ten-year-old as Subhadrà. They should be invoked with the help of thefollowing mantra: The embodiment of this mantra, the embodiment ofLakùmã, the embodiment of mothers, and the embodiment of ninegoddessess, I invoke you in this way.Then one should perform apåjàof these girls reciting the following: OGoddess, you are manifesting yourself in all that is manifested; you are theessence of all things [animate as well as inanimate]; you are the÷aktiof all.O mother of this universe, please you may accept thispåjà(Sastri 1985,21-22)Thus, the Goddess is seen as feminine insofar as she is considered awoman incarnate and construed in terms of the psychophysical andspiritual aspects of women’s beings. Indeed, one can say that it isprecisely on the psychophysical and spiritual aspects of women’sbeing that the Hindu psyche has constructed its goddess imagery. Ofcourse, it is also true that her manifestation is not limited only towomen’s ways of being. Still, this recognition does not change thefact that, according to theDevÃ-MÀhÀtmya, ultimate reality ismanifested as feminine. The existence of a Goddess principle which is in accordance withthe women’s ways of being—a way of being that interconnects andinterrelates different and disparate elements—brings up the questionof whether it can be demonstrated that this principle is not just anabstract interrelatedness. As Catherine Keller remarks, “Abstractinterrelatedness only means anything when it becomes physically andsoulfully almost tangible”(Keller 1986, 161). In other words, doesthe Goddess principle entail some concrete manifestation in theinteraction of people who believe in it? Further, how do womenrelate to this Goddess principle in a particular culture? I believe thesequestions can be addressed with the help of theØÀkta-Hindu conceptof the places of pilgrimage and worship (×Àkta-pÃñhas), and withFrederique Apffel-Marglin’s fieldwork in the Indian state of Orissa."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"WOMEN, EARTH AND THE GODDESS61 I argue that the Goddess principle is not simply an abstraction. Itis realized in the interpersonal relationships between humans and intheir interrelationship with the cosmos. I argue that women not onlyrelate to the Goddess principle, but they also perceive themselves asparts(aü×a) of the Goddess. In this sense they themselves aregoddesses. These themes, that the Goddess principle providesrelationality and continuity, that women relate to the Goddess, areprominent in the voices of Oriya women and men who hail from thecommunity of farmers studied by Frederique Apffel-Marglin. Theirvoices show beyond doubt that for them the Goddess is not an abstr-action but a living reality, providing them with a sense of continuityand relationality in a religious (dhÀrmic) context. In two recent essays (1991a and 1991b), Frederique Apffel-Marglin has critically presented her field work on the menstruationfestival(raja parba)of the Goddess in the Indian state of Orissa. Inbrief, this is a festival of menstruation of the Goddess who isvariously known as HarcaõóÃ, PçthibÃ,òhÀkurÀõÃ, BasudhÀ,DraupadÃ.8Etymologically, the wordraja parbaconsists ofraja(menses) andparba(festival), meaning thereby, the festival of themenses of the goddess. Participants believe that the life movementsin the environment, that is, the cyclical changes of the seasons anddifferent states of the earth, entail and correspond to the joining anddisjoining of humans (that is, wives and husbands). During this period of June 14-18 the earth itself is said to bemenstruating. Hence her separation from the environmental forces,e.g. humans, rain, etc., is observed. It is believed that if humansplough or dig the earth during the menstruation period violates herand makes her unhappy. Conversely, her separation from theenvironmental forces during her menstruation period would ensurehappiness and continuity of the life cycle. This belief entails andcorresponds to the belief that during their menstruation women mustkeep to themselves, and not engage in any kind of work. Doing so8 Notwithstanding their different forms and functions these goddesses aremanifestations of the same reality.

PATEL62ensures the happiness and continuity of the life cycle; disregard leadsto possible chaos and destruction. The main participants in this festival are women and men from theagricultural community, but other members from different strata ofsociety also take part in this festival. The festival takes place for fourdays every June 14-18. Each day has its own significance. Forinstance, on the third day, women try not to walk barefoot on earth soas not to hurt her. During this festival men of some fifty villages goto the temple of HarcaõóÃ, whereas women stay in the villages andcelebrate the festival there. The participants of this festival believe in one Goddess (iùñadevÃ)who is known by four different forms. Each manifestation is thoughtto symbolize different aspects of the great Goddess. For instance, thegoddess HarcaõóÃis mother earth who is said to be menstruating (raj-asthalÀ) during this festival. On the other hand, the goddess DraupadÃis remembered and worshipped as the heroine of the epicMahÀbhÀrata. However, for the participants different manifestationsof the Goddess are not always distinguishable, and HarcaõóÃisfrequently identified as DraupadÃ, leading devotees of both forms ofthe Goddess to speak about them interchangeably. Women and men believe that both DraupadÃthe goddess incarnateas the epic heroine of the MahÀbhÀrata, and HarcaõóÃthe goddessincarnate as earth, have menstruation in common. Moreover, womenthemselves identify with the Goddess, and consider themselves asparts (aü×a) of the Goddess. They believe that they are the rep-resentatives (pratinidhi) of the Goddess and that their menstruation isfrom the Goddess. One of the women participants, Dibulata, says, “Inthis festival the Goddess is at her menses and we follow all theserules [niyama] as we are the same kind as her. She is a woman andwe all are women”(Apffel-Marglin and Misra 1991b, 53). Anotherwoman, Sishulata, says, “We have this [menses] from her”(Apffel-Marglin and Misra 1991b, 44). It is not only women who believe in this women-earth-Goddessmanifestation of an all pervading one reality: men point that out ineven stronger terms. They repeatedly say that women are therepresentatives, the shadows, of the Goddess. Raghaba Sahu, one ofthe male participants says, “MÀis at her menses (mÀsika) and ourwomen are her parts (aü×a)...It is their festival; it is the festival of the"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"WOMEN, EARTH AND THE GODDESS63women folk.”9Another participant, twenty four year old SadasibaJena, says, “According to tradition (paramparÀ) we understand thatwomen are reflections or shadows of MÀand PrithibÃ.MÀandPrithibÃand women are the same thing in different forms”(Apffel-Marglin 1991b, 29). From this fieldwork it is clear that menstruation, thesine qua nonaspect of a woman’s being, is a focal point around which the concep-tion of the Goddess and the relationship of women to the Goddess isformed for both women and men. The experience of the participantsalso furnishes an important insight into the nature of the female body.For the participants in the festival, the concept of the female bodyencompasses more than what is biologically given in a human form.It encompasses a larger reality which is inclusive of the women,earth, and Goddess. This point can be illustrated with reference toconception of the places of pilgrimage and worship (×Àkta-pÃñhas)aspresented in the Hindu literature. As the written and oral traditions explain it, SatÃ, the daughter ofDakùa PrajÀpati, went uninvited to attend a sacrificial fire (yajña) cer-emony at her father’s house. When she was insulted by her father,she abandoned her body in the fire lit from her body through thepower of yoga.10The different body parts of SatÃ’s being fell over theland of India and the places at which these parts fell are known as the×Àkta-pÃñhas. For example, SatÃ’s breasts fell at Jalandhar, her vulva(yoni) fell at Kamakhya in Assam, her tongue (jihvÀ) fell at Jvalamu-khi (Sircar 1948, 42-66). The places of pligrimage and worshipwhere SatÃ’s body parts fell are themselves considered as the parts ofthe Goddess. In this sense the earth is the body of SatÃ. Thus, whenone refers to SatÃ, one is at the same time referring to the being ofSatÃas woman, earth, and Goddess.119 Other participants also repeatedly say that women are the representatives of thegoddess (Apffel-Marglin and Misra 1991b, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26).10 There are two prominent versions of this story. One version is explained hereand finds some support from the various Sanskrit texts, such as, theKumÀrasaübhava(Kane 1981). According to the other version, SatÃ’s body was cutinto pieces by Viùõu so that in the absence of SatÃ’s body,Øiva may overcome hisgrieving. It is in this sense that thePÃñhanirõaya(Sircar 1948, 42-66) explains thestory.11 This idea of oneness of the female body has been variously presented in Hindu"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"KARTIKEYA C. PATEL64 This notion of the oneness or the unity of the female body is offundamental importance in understanding the rites and rituals thatcenter around the concept of one female body. One of the TÀntrictexts, thePÃñhanirõaya(Sircar 1948), describes the goddess as ablood-colored rock (raktapÀùÀõarÅpiõÃ). At Kamakhya where SatÃ’svulva (yoni) fell, specific rites and rituals are performed whichpresuppose this notion of one female body. Here the blood-coloredrock, a part of the earth, represents SatÃ. As Mookerjee writes:Satã’s organ of generation fell at Kamakhya, and a temple was built on thehilltop there to mark the spot. It contains no image of the goddess, but inthe depth of the shrine there is a yoni-shaped cleft in the rock, adored asthe Yoni of øakti. A natural spring within the cave keeps the cleft moist.DuringAmbuvàchi(July-August), after the first burst of the monsoon, agreat ceremony takes place, for the water runs red with iron-oxide, and theritual drink is symbolic of therajasorrituof the Devã, her menstrualblood. (1988, 30)In a similar vein, the rites and rituals for the farming community ofOrissa, revolve around the female body of the goddess HarcaõóÃ,whose menstruation is collectively celebrated as a religious festival.One of the women participants says:Harcaõóã is at her menses; three days are gone and tomorrow is òhàkuràõãGaduà. After taking bath as the girls will do, so also she will do. Red colorwill be thrown on her so it will appear as if she is bleeding. Pouring thisred on her they will treat her as if she were menstruating...yes, that cloth onwhich the red is thrown will be put in a bucket of water so the water willbe red. The priest will show it to the pilgrims and say `this is the blood ofòhàkuràõã.’People out of joy and happiness will take that water. (Apffel-Marglin and Misra 1991b, 44).   literature. For example, KavirÀyar (1977, 86) explains this oneness of the femalebody when he says the following about DraupadÃ:To the five she is the goddess, to others she is the mother. She is the goddess Earth,she is Fire’s self-manifestation. She is a speaker of truth, she isa woman of virtuousqualities. She is the goddess of this lineage."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"WOMEN, EARTH AND THE GODDESS65IIIThe rites and rituals which center around the female body of women,earth, and the Goddess form the very conception of religious(dhÀrmic) life anddharma(religion) for theØÀkta-Hindus. In thissection, I consider the meaning ofdharmaas beneficial directionswhich are considered conducive to the collective happiness andcontinued well-being of the cosmos. I will explain this collectivehappiness and the continued well-being in terms of the worship of thefemale body. According to theLakùmÃTantra, “The one whodespises women, despises LakùmÃ, the one who worships (praises)women, worships (praises) LakùmÃ, and so worships (praises) thethree worlds”(Krishanamacharya 1959, 43.64). Once again, voicesfrom the farming community will provide us with further insightsinto the meaning of religious activities and religion. For the farming people in Frederique Apffel-Marglin‘s study, theconception of religion centers around the female body of women-earth-the Goddess. They describe the goddessHarcaõóÃwho isDraupadÃas a flagpost, a symbol(sanketika)of religion which keepseverything going (Apffel-Marglin and Misra 1991b, 17). Thecontinuity of religion depends on the happiness of women-earth-theGoddess. The participants believe that if the cyclical continuity ofmenstruation, that is,strÃdharmais respected and that if women, theearth, and the Goddess are not disturbed during their menstruationperiod, then the cyclical continuity of life on earth, and happiness,will be ensured. Conversely, if the female body of women-earth-the Goddess isdisturbed during her menstruation, what follows is discontinuity andpossible annihilation. The participants often point to the story ofgoddess DraupadÃwho was disturbed during her menstruation: whatfollowed was a great battle and almost total annihilation of the tribeof the Kurus. Just as the disturbance of DraupadÃ’s menstruationcaused the destruction of the Kuru lineage, the disturbance of motherearth’s menstruation period would cause the destruction of crops andother vegetation. Similarly, if women are disturbed during theirmenstruation by being touched, or forced to attend to regular chores,the family will possibly be destroyed. Thus, one of the participants says:"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"KARTIKEYA C. PATEL66A. Draupadã cursed Harcaõóã [the victor of the wager and foe to herhusbands] and he died. The whole lineage of the Kurus [the Kaurava clanof Harcaõóã] was destroyed because of this sin.Q. What sin?A. She was disturbed during herçtu[term for menses]; she was taken bythe hair and she was angry and the result was very bad. Everything wasdestroyed, blood was shed.Q. Your observances during this festival, does it mean that you give rest tomother earth?A. Yes. If we do not allow her to rest during her menses, the results willnot be good. Our works will not be fruitful. So that’s why our women aregiven lots of rest since they are the representative of mother earth.Q. What would happen if we do the same thing that the Kauravas did anddisturb the earth?A. We will get afflictions (do÷a).Q. What type of afflictions? A. Everything will be spoiled. If you plow, it will not give results. That iswhy we give sufficient rest to women during their menses. If they rest itwill be good for them. They do no work; they are untouchable (achåa)wedo not disturb them. So the mother goddess should take rest at this time.(Apffel-Marglin and Misra 1991a, 34)Hence religious (dhÀrmic) happiness is directly linked to thehappiness and worship of the feminine. Giving happiness to women,the earth, and the Goddess partly depends on not disturbing themduring their menstruation. During the menstruation festival the earthmust not be dug or plowed or one must not walk on the earth barefootas that would hurt or disturb her.12In the same vein women should begiven rest during their menstruation and should not be disturbed. Oneof the male participants says:Watchman [W]: This is just like the menses of women.Frederique Apffel-Marglin [FAM]: What does it mean?12 Sishulata, one of the women participants says, “On the day ofBhuÃDahana(burning earth, the 3rd day) we pee on a banana leaf...On that day BasudhÀ(theearth) will not be dug. We will walk carefully so as not to dig up the earth. It is saidthat onthat day the earth(bhÅmÃ)burns. Rubbing or digging the earth will make theearth go away. That is why we pee on a leaf. This is what we do in this area.”(Apffel-Marglin and Misra 1991b, 48-49)."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"WOMEN, EARTH AND THE GODDESS67W:Rajameans this: for three days, thepahilãraja[the first day],saïkranti[the second day] andbhuã dahana[the third day] she is bleeding (oozing).

Purna Chandra Misra [PCM]: How do we observe this? W: We should stop all work.PCM: Who?W: Both men and women. Men will stop farming. Women will rest athome and won’t walk barefoot. P: You know, I have become old but when my wife is at her menses she isallowed to stay in a corner and rest. Me and my son cook for ourselves.We do not let her work. We consider her untouchable at that time. If she isnot given rest, she will not be in a good condition. (Apffel-Marglin andMisra 1991a, 35)But giving rest to mother earth or to a woman during themenstruation period is only one way to make them happy. Otherways to make them happy, and thereby make religious (dhÀrmic) lifehappy, consists in worshipping the female body with offerings. Themen at HarcaõóÃoffer sacrificial animals to the goddess to make herhappy. According to one of the participants:We have finished ploughing and we are waiting for rain so the right time(pagayoga)for sowing will come. So this is the time we come to Harcaõóãto offer her animal sacrifice(boda)for her pleasure so that she will takecare to give us proper rains so that we will have good crops. We comehere because she is the most powerful goddess of the earth (pruthibã). Sheis the goddess who protects us from the sea; she is here on the sea becauseif she were not we would be under water. So we come here to take shelterunder her feet for four days; we worship her to make her happy and this isthe right time to do that. (Apffel-Marglin and Misra 1991b, 16-17)Similarly, women are kept happy by being given clothes, ornaments,and leisure time. During this festival, women receive therajabasketcontaining clothes, etc. from their parents, and their husbands alsoprovide them with clothes. One of the men explains:Therajabasket comes from our father-in-law’s place for them and itmakes them very happy. They get new clothes from their parents. Some-times seeing our financial situation we also give new clothes to our"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"KARTIKEYA C. PATEL68women. The women do not cook and they eat before sunset; they also playon swings, play cards, sing songs and keep themselves happy. If the fathercannot send anything the husbands take care to purchase everythingcarefully for their wives, so they become happy. So also the goddessbecomes glad at the gifts and presentations of the men who pray to her.She becomes glad at this, so also her representatives as women, theybecome glad, soprakçtiis happy and her representatives are also happy.Like men, women also make the Goddess happy by praying to herand by decorating and keeping themselves happy, since they are god-desses themselves. Dibulata Devi says:She (i.e. the goddess) is a woman and we all are women. We do not work.We play on swings, tying ropes in trees; we play cards; we do not walkbarefoot so as not to give her pain. We decorate ourselves during this fes-tival. We walk with friends and sing together. This reminds us of ourmenarche festival when everyone keeps us happy. Now we make oursel-ves happy during raja. People also love us when we take care of ourbodies. So also our men go to goddess Harcaõóã to worship her, to pleaseher by offering goats and rams. We women also do the things to pleasemother earth, so that she will give us fruitfulness, and by that she becomesactive and ready to bear fruit, by which we all live. Central to these religious festivities is the belief that actionspertaining to religion attain fruition only if the female body is wor-shipped. The continuation of life on earth depends on the properworship of mother earth, and the continuation of human life dependson the proper worship of women in society. To conclude, then, for theØÀkta-Hindus, the notion of religiongains significance only when the divine is worshipped as feminine inthe form of women-earth-the Goddess. The cyclical changes in awoman’s body correspond to and represent the cyclical changes inthe seasons. Their religious belief and awareness does not separatethe environment from humans; they find connections in these events.When mother earth has her menstruation period, women also believethat they have their menstruation periods. For men, the belief thatduring the menstruation festival goddess earth should be kept happyby worship and offerings, is directly related and translatable into thebelief that women are parts of the goddess and they should also beworshipped. Thus, it is the Goddess principle that provides them withthe understanding of both the interrelatedness of humans and theirsurroundings. It also provides them with the understanding of religion"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"WOMEN, EARTH AND THE GODDESS69as a way of life that gives continuity and meaning to humanendeavors.ConclusionIn this essay taking the Goddess tradition of India as a paradigmaticexample, I have argued that the divine envisaged as the female bodyis the all-pervading reality that interconnects and interrelates differentand disparate elements of life. In Section I of this essay, I havediscussed the problems of interpretation and context and offered acontext-sensitive definition of women’s nature in terms ofmenstruation. Here, I have argued that a woman’s own nature(strÃsvabhÀva) can be construed as a woman’s religion (strÃdharma).My main aim here has been to forge a link between the notions offemale embodiment and religion. To this end, I have defined awoman’s religion (strÃdharma) not in terms of the duties that liberatewomen, but in terms of menstruation. In Section II, I have offered a theological framework within whichthe divine may be envisaged as feminine. I have argued that theprinciple that interconnects and interrelates different elements of lifecan be better explained as the Goddess than as Brahman. Further, Ihave argued that the Brahman itself can in turn be understood as amanifestation of the Goddess. In response to the objection that theGoddess, viewed as ultimate reality, need not be regarded asfeminine, I have pointed out that the method of Goddess worshipmandates worshipping the Goddess in the form of ten girls. I have also argued that if one means by “feminine”that whichpertains to the psychological, cultural and biological ways ofwomen’s being, then in Hinduism the Goddess is definitely feminine,since it is precisely on women’s ways of being that aØÀkta-Hinduhas constructed its Goddess imagery. Further, I have argued that theGoddess principle so construed as interrelation and interconnection isnot an empty abstraction, but has concrete meaning for people whobelieve in it. The Goddess principle not only provides meaning to thesocial interaction between men and women, but more important, itconnects them to their environment. Women and men both regardwomen as parts, as manifestations of the Goddess. Further, theinterconnection among the Goddess, the earth, and women in thefamily is linked through menstruation, thesine qua nonaspect of thefeminine. It is menstruation that provides the meaning to the divine"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"KARTIKEYA C. PATEL70as the feminine manifesting herself in form of women, earth, and theGoddess. In Section III, I have argued that from aØÀkta-Hindu perspectivethe notion of religion and religious life are themselves dependent onthe worship of the feminine. As we have noted earlier, the Goddess isa symbol of religion (dharma). Thus the notion of femaleembodiment has a direct bearing on the phenomenon of religion. Infact, the phenomenon of religion cannot be sufficiently explainedwithout understanding the importance of and centrality of the femalebody of women, earth, and the Goddess. As a new discipline,feminist/womanist approach can effectively contribute to the study ofphilosophy of religion by further investigating the role and centralityof the female body in religious experience.BIBLIOGRAPHYAmos, Valerie, and Pratibha Parmar. 1984.

This festival is often called theÂ×vina NavarÀtra todistinguish it from the nine night spring festival to the Goddess, held inthe month of Caitra (March/April). Although popular participation intheÂ×vina NavarÀtra surpasses the Caitra celebrations, particularly inurban centres such as Banaras and Calcutta, these two festivalsconstitute the major periods in the yearly cycle when attention isfocussed primarily on the Goddess. The DevÃreceives a rich assortmentof devotional worship from both men and women during theNavarÀtras. In this chapter I describe salient varieties of worshippractices performed by Hindu women to the Goddess. I then examinethe images and roles of women during such rituals. I inquire into theways in which women’s roles, images, and activities differ from maleworship patterns and proceed to reflect on the differences.1I suggestthat the festivals of worship of the Great Goddess serve to elevate the“feminine”to a highly auspicious status, while simultaneously encour-aging specific states of womanhood.   1This chapter draws on field research conducted primarily in Banaras (VÀrÀõasÃ)during the years 1990 and 1991. I am particularly grateful to the Social Sciences andHumanities Research Council of Canada and the School of Graduate Studies atMcMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, for their generous financial support.Onemay consult Rodrigues (1993) for a more substantial study on goddess worship inBanaras."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"THE WORSHIP OF THE GREAT GODDESS 73Which Goddess?During the NavarÀtras, it is common to see devotees crowding intovirtually every goddess temple fordar×ana, profound perceptualinteraction with the Divine. Besides worship at major goddess temples,devotees also worship at smaller shrines, at sacred water tanks, at rivers,and at goddess effigies established especially at these times of the year.The vast array of differently named goddesses that are worshippedduring these NavarÀtras naturally raises the question whether just onedeity is the object of devotion. To further complicate matters, even in aparticular worship ritual, one may find that devotion is addressed togoddesses in different forms and epithets.2Nevertheless, despite thisseeming profusion of images, names, and places of worship, throughobservation, inquiry, and close attention to the liturgy of rituals itbecomes clear that devotion is offered to the Divine Feminine in hermost supreme aspect, through the medium of any number of chosengoddess images or image clusters. I therefore suggest that theNavarÀtras are times of worship of the Great Goddess rather than anygoddess in particular.3 In Banaras, a city which often mirrors and sometimes shapes thecharacter of Hindu religiosity throughout India, the terms most oftenused by devotees for the object of their devotions during these festivalsare simply DevÃ(Goddess) or MahÀdevÃ(Great Goddess).4The mostfrequently encountered names used to address the DevÃare MÀ(mother), DurgÀ,orMÀDurgÀ.5As these epithets suggest, the mostpervasive conceptual images of the Great Goddess during theNavarÀtras is that of a Cosmic Mother, creatrix, nourisher, and nurturerof the world, or that of the regal warrior goddess DurgÀ, whose many   2 A detailed study of the variety of names and forms of the DevÃduring the DurgÀPÅjÀritual may be found in my forthcoming article, tentatively entitled “Faces of theGoddess.”3 I use the terms Great Goddess, Goddess, DevÃ, and MahÀdevÃ, synonymously torefer to the supreme form of the Divine Feminine. For lesser forms, I use particularepithets, or the general terms,devÃand goddess.4 For more on the Great Goddess of Hinduism see Brown 1990, Kinsley 1986,Kramrisch 1975, and Humes 1991. On the cycle of worship festivals to all deitiesthroughout the year in Banaras see Eck 1982.5 Devotees may refer to the Great Goddess by other names such as MahÀlakùmÃ,or MahÀkÀlÃ. However such epithets are far less frequently encountered."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"HILLARY RODRIGUES 74arms wield a host of weapons.6DurgÀis often portrayed astride hermount, a great lion, or engaged in crushing the Buffalo demon, Mahiùa.In fact, of the many goddess festivals which occur throughout the year,such as the KÀlÃ, LakùmÃor SarasvatÃPÅjÀs, only the ritual worshipfestival of DurgÀcoincides with the autumn NavarÀtras, leading manyworshippers to use the terms DurgÀPÅjÀandÂ×vina NavarÀtrasynonymously.7Types of devotional activitiesA.Home shrine worship (pÅjÀ)Offering a five-part service (pañcopacÀra) to the DevÃimage in a homeshrine is one of the simplest devotional activities performed by wor-shippers during the NavarÀtras. This image may be something as simpleas a framed lithograph print of the DevÃor a more elaborate stone scu-lpture. The five-part devotional service may be used in the worship ofany deity and generally consists of offering fragrant anointing paste(gandha), fragrant fresh flowers (puùpa), fragrant incense (dhÅpa), theflame (dÃpa) from a lamp, and a piece of food (naivedya). Whencombined with other devotional elements such as utterances (mantra)ofpraise and homage, and gestures of obeisance (praõÀma), such acts ofworship are termedpÅjÀ. Although worshippers may performpÅjÀtothe images in their home shrines throughout the year, during theNavarÀtras one discerns an intensification of the devotion. Few, if any,of the five offerings will be omitted, and special or higher quality itemsmay be utilized. Also, although the DevÃimage may be that of LakùmÃ,or KÀlÃ, goddesses who are worshipped under those epithets on theirrespective festival days, during the NavarÀtras these images represent   6 For information on the Goddess as Mother or as DurgÀ, see Bandyopadyay 1987,Bhattacharyya 1971, Brown 1974, Divakaran 1984, and Kinsley 1986.7 My own use of the term DurgÀPÅjÀis restricted to refer to the celebrationswhich take place mainly during the last days of the autumn NavarÀtras. Thesecelebrations involve the worship of DurgÀand attending deities in large, colourfulclay images which are set up intemporarily erected shrines. After thepÅjÀ, theimages are delivered into a venerated body of water, such as the river GaïgÀ. For thecycle of goddess festivals celebrated throughout the year in Banaras, see Rodrigues1993.

Such worship may consist of a daily visit to thesame nearby orfavorite DevÃtemple or to nine different temples duringthe nine days of NavarÀtras. Thus, for instance, a devotee living nearBanaras’sDa×À×vamedha Ghat, might visit the famous temple ofAnnapÅrõÀdevÃon each of the nine days. Alternatively, she may chooseto perform the Nine DurgÀPilgrimage (navadurgÀyÀtrÀ), visiting adifferent DurgÀtemple on each of the nine days. The temple ofAnnapÅrõÀDevÃ, incidentally, is one of these nine DurgÀtemples. The central act of worship at temples isdar×ana, a word whichmeans “view”or “vision”in its broadest sense. Duringdar×ana,paralleling a visit to a monarch, devotees seek to have a successful andintimate audience with the DevÃ. These visits may be gestures ofrespectful homage, but more often they are motivated by hopes andfears. Worshippers often come seeking some favour from the Goddesswho is thought to be particularly accessible during the NavarÀtras. Herpower oozes out of the earth and water and radiates from any shrinewhere her seat/throne (pÃñha) has been established. There, the DevÃ’sgrace may fall upon her devotees granting them their most cherisheddesires, or protecting them from their most dreaded fears. Although theGoddess may be honoured with as little as an empty-handed but sincerevisit, devotees at temples generally perform some variation of the five-part devotional service (pañcopacÀra) performed in homepÅjÀs.Worshippers may also make a pledge (manauti) in which they promisethe DevÃsome loyal devotional activity in return for a favour granted.Regular temple visits, a pilgrimage and service at a temple, or renderinga particular offering such as a blood sacrifice (bali) or a child’s firsttonsure (muõóana) are common promises. In all cases, however,dar×anaembodies the conceptual notion of a profound and intimateperceptual interaction with the DevÃ.8Indar×ana’s ideal expression, the   8For the reciprocation of vision indar×ana, see Eck 1981.

The"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"HILLARY RODRIGUES 76devotees’entire beings, their gross constituent elements, all their senses,including sight, and even their inner mental faculties are engulfed in aunifying “vision”of the DevÃ. While I found that malebrÀhmaõapandits defined the typical five-part service as consisting ofgandha,puùpa,dhÅpa,dÃpa, andnaivedya,worshippers described their offerings differently, mentioning instead thespecific items they would use in DevÃworship. These wererorÃ/cand-ana(a fragrant red powder derived from flowers, and sandalwoodpowder),karpÅra(camphor),agarbattÃ(incense sticks),maulÃ/cunri(athread or cloth scarf),ilÀyacÃdÀnÀ(cardamom sweets),nÀriyala(coconut), andphÅlkÃmÀlÀ(flower garland). One notes that the redpowder (rorÃ), camphor, incense sticks, and cardamom sweets are lessexpensive forms of the fragrant paste derived from sandalwood(candana), the flame from a clarified butter (ghÃ) lamp, lavish incense(cone or powdered), or the food offerings prescribed by orthodoxtradition. However, the choice of offerings is also noticibly adapted tothe feminine nature of the Goddess. The feminine in Hindu thought istraditionally associated with blood, which is seen as the animating juiceof life, the nourishment of life, and the reproductive complement ofmale semen (O’Flaherty 1980:33). Blood, or its symbols, are thussignificant components in offerings to the DevÃ. The feminine is oftenconceived of as identical with the created cosmos and its naturalcomponent elements such as earth, water, fire, and air.9Although natureand blood are symbols of the profane creation and its processes, theDevÃ, who is the Divine Feminine, is associated with sacred qualities ofpurity and chastity. For this reason, in the items used in Goddessworship one finds a merging of the symbols of blood, purity, and nature. The flame, paste, fragrant smoke, flowers, and food of thepÅjÀofferings symbolize the constituent elements of nature, as well as itsnourishing qualities. The red powderedrorÃ, symbol of blood, is animportant complement to sandalwood paste (candana), whose saffronyellow colour symbolizes the purity of renunciation. In goddess   reciprocation of sight and sound are the two most prominent features ofpÅjÀwhichincludes mutual touching, smelling, and tasting of devotee and deity.9In classical SÀükhya philosophy, reality is composed of pure spirit orpuruùa,and pure matter,prakçti(See Larson 1969, Aranya 1983, Eliade 1970).

The coconut, which is smashed when offered inorder to release its contained fluid, also carries the symbolism of asacrificial offering of the head and blood. In further contrast to thetypical five-part offerings made to other deities, offerings to the DevÃinclude themaulÃ/cunri. This offering is drawn from more elaborate tenor sixteen-part devotional services (da×opacÀra, ùoóa×opacÀra) whichtypically include an offering of clothing (vastra) to the deity. Sincetraditional Hindu thought envisions women as fond of clothing andornamentation, the thread or scarf offering, which is made even in verysimple acts of goddess worship, and which symbolizes the gift of afemale garment (sÀrÃ), most likely is an acknowledgement of the DevÃ’sfemininity. The thread or scarf is generally dyed red with traces ofyellow, reiterating the joint symbolism of blood and purity.

In the RakùÀBandhana(Protective Knotting), sisters generally tie decorative strings around their brothers’wrists. The feminine power of sisters provides protectionfor their male siblings. Thetradition originated in a similar gesture of protection, where members of the priestlyclass (brÀhmaõas) would tie a protective knot on the wrist of members of the warriorclass (kùatriya) symbolizing the latter’s dependence on the protection of the former.Althoughthe king and his soldiers are considered to be protectors of the earth and itssubjects, the priesthood symbolically conferred divine protection upon them."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"HILLARY RODRIGUES 78thrust of the priest’s distinction between male and female modes ofworship, I suggest, is less between the ultimate meanings and aims ofdar×anaandpÅjÀ, and more between the general activities suggested bythe terms. According to him, men come primarily to see, women to do. In temples in Banaras, I also noticed that women appeared to be farless restrained in their devotional fervour. Barriers are erected in themain porches of the most popular temples during the NavarÀtras inorder to segregate the sexes as they approach the inner sanctum fordar×ana. This separation allows for clear observation of the differencesbetween male and female activity. The men appeared more reserved andrestrained when they entered the temple. They formed orderly lineswhich only gave way to a crush of bodies just before the doors to theinner sanctum. The women, in contrast, were far more lively, ringingthe temple bells with abandon and enjoying the contact with the crowdsdespite the discomfort caused by the suffocating press of worshippers.The bodies on their side of the barricades often appeared to form asingle mass which rhythmically surged like waves in the ocean. Whilewomen appeared to be far more comfortable with the physical contactwith their own sex, the men appeared to maintain a certain territorialityaround their persons for a much longer period of time and onlysurrendered this out of necessity to the crowd before the sanctum.11C.Pledged devotional activities (manauti)As mentioned above, devotees may pledge (manauti) to performparticular acts in return for a favour (vara) from the goddess. In myexperience, women far exceed men in this type of pledging althoughboth sexes do participate in barter with the Divine. Women oftenrequest from the DevÃfavorable marriages for themselves or theiroffspring, or the well-being of their spouses and children, or for thebirth of children. Men seem to be concerned with success, economicallyor in work and school, the defeat of rivals, and the acquisition ofpersonal power. It is quite common to see first tonsures (muõóana)ofchildren performed at DevÃtemples. This is a highly visible, althoughnot necessarily the most common, fulfilment of amanauti. Mothers (on   11In the case of both males and females, however, the attitude to public physicalcontact with members of the same sex is much more relaxed in India than in westerncultures. For instance, it is quite common for male friends to embrace and walk handin hand in public."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"THE WORSHIP OF THE GREAT GODDESS 79occasion with their spouses and often with other female familymembers) visit the temple of the DevÃ, where they had requested thebirth of a child, in order to perform the child’s first tonsure (muõóana).This ritual shaving of the head, removing the hair which accompaniedthe child at birth, marks a rite of passage (saüskÀra) from mother-dependentchildhoodtowardsindependentpersonhood.Whenperformed at a goddess shrine, the ritual suggests that the child isactually moving away from dependence on its earthly mother to a newstate of empowered dependence on the Cosmic Mother.12D.Vowed devotional observances (vrata)Although resembling the pledged devotional activity (manauti), thevowed devotional observance (vrata) differs in nature. It is much morestrongly associated with female religious practice.13Women performvratas throughout the year, often for the well-being of their maritalrelationships, their spouses, offspring, and other family members.Unlikemanautis, which generally involve a “payback”of a pledge for afavour granted by the DevÃ, thevratais performed before the grantingof any boon. While amanautimay involve the offering of a child’s hair,or a donation of a flag or bell to the temple of the Goddess, or even thesacrificial offering of a goat,vratas always have an element of renunci-ation, personal asceticism, or austerity.14Thusvratas may consist of   12A sacrificial interpretation of the tonsure ritual is found in Erndl 1987.13An excellent study of the practice ofvratas among Hindu women in Banaras isfound in Pearson 1992. For a detailed discussion ofvratas among women in the stateof Maharashtra see McGee 1989, 1991. McGee (1991) points out that although thereis an element of desire (kÀmya) in the motives of women, the main reason for per-formingvratas is a pressing sense of duty (nitya). According to her research,contractual rites (i.e.,manauti,navasin Marathi) are generally motivated by desires(kÀmya) (1991:81).14My own research (based on a qualitative rather than quantitative assessment ofdevotees’motivations) suggests thatvratasmust be performed regularly in order tosustain the structures of the ritually created universe within which Hindus live.Manautismust be performed to restore the imbalance in the processes of the cosmoscaused by divine intervention. People request special favours from deities when thekarmic consequences they face in this round of worldly existence are unfavourable.Themanautiis not merely the request, but the fulfilment of the devotee’s side of thecontract. While the request is desire-born (kÀmya), thefulfilment carries anextremely strong and urgent sense of duty (nitya), since abrogating one’s responsibil-ity could lead to stern divine retribution. In this respect,manautishave a greaterelement of obligation (nitya) thanvratas, which may occasionally be neglectedwithout immediate dire consequences."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"HILLARY RODRIGUES 80placing restrictions on the diet or complete fasting, restricting one’ssleep, regularly visiting a temple, or performing some sort ofpilgrimage. During the NavarÀtras, a large percentage of both male and femalegoddess worshippers engage invrata-like activities. It is quite commonfor devotees to restrict their diet to curd (dadhi) and fruit (phala). Manyattempt to stay awake throughout the night. While an intense applicationof such austerities would be to sustain them for the entire nine days ofthe festival, devotees are much more likely to attempt such fasts or all-night vigils only on the first (pratipadÀ) and ninth (navamÃ) days, or onthe last three days of the NavarÀtras. In Banaras, women engaged inDevÃworship often modify their cooked food preparations throughoutNavarÀtras. For instance, a preparation (khiciçi) made of unprocessedrice (kuñucÀval), green chili, and ginger is a staple cooked food duringthe NavarÀtras. Women also use flour (ÀñÀ) made from a black skinned,leathery, horned water chestnut (×çïgÀra) and flavour their food with areddish rock salt (sendhÀnamak). The uncooked, unprocessed, or less-refined nature of these foods associates them more with renunciationand spiritual potency than with bodily nutrition.E.PilgrimagePilgrimage may be performed either as amanautior as avrata.15Inreturn for such a favour as having her son married successfully (whichoften means his having a child not long after the marriage), a mothermay perform a pilgrimage to the temple of the goddess from whom shehad made such a request. Women who make such requests and performsuch pilgrimages may spend anywhere from a few hours to a few daysat the DevÃtemple. They often set up a domicile in some section of thetemple’s pilgrim shelters (dharma×ÀlÀ) and perform such services asworshipping the deity, cleaning the temple, and feeding the priests.Pilgrimage is often recommended as an ideal devotional activity forpost-menopausal women, since they are free from the periodicpollutions which Hindu orthodoxy deems are caused by menstruation.Post-menopausal women are considered pure enough to prepare cookedfood offerings for deities and forbrÀhmaõapriests. Generally, the food   15Interesting studies of Hindu pilgrimages are found in Gold 1988 and Sax 1991,where the emphases and purposes are different from the type of local pilgrimagebeing discussed here."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"THE WORSHIP OF THE GREAT GODDESS 81eaten on pilgrimages is simple but delicious, such as deep fried wholewheat bread (pÅrÃ), curried vegetables (sabjÃ), and a sweetened paste ofwheat flour (halvÀ). Men may accompany the women on theseexcursions although they are less likely to engage actively in service(sevÀ) to the deity or the priests. They generally wander around thepilgrimage site, takedar×anaof the goddess, perform a little devotionalworship (pÅjÀ), chat with the priests and other pilgrims, and enjoy thefood prepared by the women. After all, on such a visit, they are merelyaccompanying the women who are engaged in fulfilling their ownmanautis. Pilgrimages may also be performed by both men and women duringthe NavarÀtras out of either the ascetic spiritual practice (sÀdhanÀ)orvrataimpulse. Pilgrimages such as the Nine DurgÀYÀtrÀin Banarasrequire pilgrims to visit a different goddess temple on each of the ninenights of NavarÀtra. Since they return home after each temple visit, bothwomen and men may engage in such a pilgrimage without having toleave their domicile for extended periods of time. On the other hand,pilgrimages to the temple of VindhyavÀsinÃDevÃ, some ninetykilometers from Banaras or to the powerful pilgrimage sites locatedthere (e.g., KÀlÃKuam, TÀrÀPÃñha, and Bhairava Kuõóa) may requiremore than a single day. I have met male pilgrims, both lay persons andmembers of ascetic orders (such as Aghoris), who might spend much ofNavarÀtra at a single powerful site (siddha pÃñha) deeply engaged inspiritual practice (sÀdhanÀ). They cook and share their food with othersat this time. While the Nine DurgÀPilgrimage is prescribed for the A×vinaNavarÀtra, it is performed by large numbers of men and women duringboth NavarÀtras in Banaras.By comparison, the Nine GaurÃPilgrimage, made to the pure, fair-skinned (gaurÃ) goddesses of the city,draws a very small number of pilgrims. The recommended time for theNine GaurÃPilgrimage is the Caitra NavarÀtra, but my observationsshowed that most pilgrims persist in performing the Nine DurgÀPilgrimage again during the spring festival.It suggests that bothNavarÀtras are viewed as festivals to the Great Goddess, DurgÀ.Itisnoteworthy that while the Nine DurgÀPilgrimage attracts both male andfemale pilgrims, the Nine GaurÃPilgrimage is performed almostexclusively by women, a point to which I will return later in thischapter."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"HILLARY RODRIGUES 82F.Spiritual practice (sÀdhanÀ)These observations bring us to significant points of difference betweenmale and female religiosity concerning the Goddess during NavarÀtra.Men, more than women, are likely to engage in spiritual practice(sÀdhanÀ) during NavarÀtra. The ascetic mode of spiritual practiceamong women takes the form of thevrata. One of the salientdistinctions betweensÀdhanÀandvratais that while men performsÀdhanÀfor themselves, women performvratas for others. Mentherefore are often the lucky recipients of power, protection, or otherbenefits which derive from their own actions as well as the actions ofwomen. The source of both power and protection is, of course, theGoddess. Throughvratas women intensify their identification with thepurity and auspiciousness of the DevÃ. In this manner they embody invarying degrees that creative, nurturing, and nourishing power (×akti)which is virtually synonymous with the Goddess.16ThroughsÀdhanÀmen seek to tap into that power. What further distinguishes the two activities is that malesÀdhanÀinvolves ritual components which are generally forbidden to women.Men who are capable of reading Sanskrit often recite theDurgÀSapta×atÃ(The Seven Hundred [Verses] to DurgÀ), the most populardevotional text of Goddess worship.17Orthodox tradition forbidswomen from reciting Sanskritic texts such as theDurgÀSapta×atÃ, and Ihave never observed women do so in public. Also, I have neverobserved women practice the recitation of sacred utterances of homageto the goddess (DevÃmantra) while making fire oblations, alone. Theydo participate in such rituals, but in lesser numbers than men. Fireoblations (havan) are a widespread form of worship during NavarÀtra,especially on the final day (navamÃ).Roles and images of women during goddess worshipA.Priestess (pujÀrÃ)Hindu priests who perform the worship rituals for a deity in a public   16On the nature and worship ofØakti as the Goddess, see Bhattacharyya1974, Coburn 1982, and Das 1934.17It is also known as theDevÃ-MÀhÀtmya.

Since women, even from thebrÀhmaõaclasses, arefar less likely to be trained in the recitation of Sanskrit prayers, they arerarely commissioned for such duties. However, there are no orthodoxprohibitions against initiated women performing such functions.Although it is uncommon, I have seen women preside as priestesses atgoddess temples throughout the year and during the NavarÀtras. ShantiDevi, for instance, ministers to the goddess at a small KÀlÃtemple inBanaras. She took over the responsibilities after the death of herhusband. Similarly, the daughters of the chief priest at the temple ofKÀtyÀyanÃDevÃ, the sixth of Banaras’s Nine DurgÀs, minister todevotees during the NavarÀtras. I was also informed that a priestess, ifqualified through specialØÀkta initiation (dÃkùÀ) may perform theextremely elaborate DurgÀPÅjÀritual. Middle aged devotees told methat in their youth they had seen such female priestesses perform theDurgÀPÅjÀ. It is clear that men far outnumber women in the priestly function ofgoddess worship particularly in urban centres. Since goddess worshipflourishes in villages and since it draws a substantial part of its characterfrom non-Brahmanical sources, it is possible that there are largerpercentages of women priestesses in rural worship centres where classconcerns and Sanskrit liturgy are not of paramount importance.B.Spiritual healers (Hindi:ojhÀ)Spiritual healers (ojhÀ) often perform their work at the shrines ofgoddesses. To devoutØÀktas, the DevÃis perceived as the source of allpower, and thus if properly propitiated may protect her devotees fromthe onslaught of afflictions. Afflictions may be both physical and psy-chological. They may include diseases caused by seasonal changes ofclimate, possession by some malicious spirit, or pernicious psychicattacks by one’s enemies through the agency of sorcerers (H: jÀdÅkarnevÀlÀ). The causes of these afflictions are often personified as demons orminor feminine deities such asØÃtalÀ, the goddess ofsmallpox orcholera, the Mothers (mÀtçkÀ), YakùÃs, or YoginÃs. In some measure all these represent aspects or   18On the roles of priests in Goddess temples, see Fuller 1984."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"HILLARY RODRIGUES 84subordinate forms of the Great Goddess, or beings who have derivedtheir power from her. Her power is ultimately the source of destructiveafflictions. To devoutØÀktas, however, the DevÃis a compassionate andprotective Cosmic Mother, who is immediately and intrinsically presentwhenever one is afflicted. The chills and fevers of disease reveal thebattle between her protective and pernicious power. Healers areparticularly adept at channelling the power of the DevÃ, both perniciousand protective. They may absorb a patient’s disease into their ownbodies, or serve as a medium through which the Devi’s advice or powerreaches the patient. Both men and women work as healers. At therenowned DurgÀKuõó temple in BanÀras, SukhadevÃ, widow of theflamboyant healer Mithai Lal, currently ministers to his patients.Healers such as SukhadevÃare very likely to frequent sacred goddesssites reputed for their success at empowerment (siddha pÃñha). TheDevÃ’s power is particularly accessible during NavarÀtras.C. ArtistsIt is because of the enhanced access to the DevÃduring the NavarÀtrasthat all those interested in tapping into her power, or attributes, visit orestablish sites of Goddess worship. The DevÃis highly accessible at herpermanent temples but she may also be established in practically anymaterial effigy.19Her presence virtually sprouts out of the soil andwater, wherever a space is consecrated and an image installed, and itlingers there even after the images are discarded at the end of the festi-val.20Both male and female artists are among those who seek out theDevÃ’s qualities. Artistic inspiration is considered to emanate from the DevÃ’s creativepower. Sound, a grosser manifestation of the unstruck creative vibration(anÀhata nÀda) symbolizes and embodies all creative activity, includinghuman conceptualizations. The DevÃis considered to be the source and   19The DevÃmay be worshipped in a form as simple as a lump (pia) of earth orcowdung. More often the jar form is established, or more elaborate painted clayimages are used for worship.20The DevÃ’s perennial presence in soil and water is mentioned in theDurgÀSapta×atÃ11.4. The text (12.8) also states that the DevÃwill never abandon any placewhere she is established in a sanctuary through the recitation of theDurgÀSapta×atÃ.In thedismissal rituals at the end of the DurgÀPÅjÀ, the priest entreats the DevÃtoremain in the earth, water, and home (See Appendix, Rodrigues 1993)."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"THE WORSHIP OF THE GREAT GODDESS 85embodiment of all such vibrational creation (nÀda brahman).21Poets,singers, musicians, and dancers visit DevÃtemples during the NavarÀtrasand may even perform for the Goddess. These command performancesnaturally demand the highest expression of the artists’talents. While inthe DevÃ’s presence, or while performing for her, artists seek to acquiremore of the DevÃ’s creative power and thus enhance their artistry.Female artists are most often seen dancing or singing for the Goddess. Singers and musicians may typically perform devotional folk songs(bhajana) or classicalrÀgas to the DevÃwith great passion. These maybe short performances at temples or part of lengthy all-night vigils (rÀtrijÀgaraõa) where singing, music, and story-telling are part of the activ-ities. During public DurgÀPÅjÀcelebrations, women in Bengalicommunities sing about the coming (ÀgamanÃ) of the Goddess and hervictory (vijaya) over the forces of chaos and darkness.22While Katthakis the classical dance form favoured in North Indian cities such asBanaras, and Bharata NÀñyam is preferred in South India, I have seenwomen of all ages perform improvised folk dances before the DevÃinboth the north and the south.D.Nurturer and nourisherJust as female artists seek to embody the creative attributes of the DevÃ,and healers embody the DevÃ’s protective and curative powers, womenmay also align themselves with the nurturing and nourishing dimensionthe Goddess’s nature. An important epithet of the Goddess in Banaras isAnnapÅrõÀ(She Who is Replete with Sustenance). The created world,the body cosmos of the DevÃ, is not merely imbued with life but servesas a source of nourishment for the lives it engenders. The food offerings(naivedya) made in the simplest ofpÅjÀs attest to the nutritiousdimension of the creation. The fruit (phala), itself part of the Devi’sbody, is offered back to her. Sanctified through her acceptance of it, it iseaten by the devotee as a blessing (prasÀda). In elaborate celebrations of DurgÀPÅjÀs, particularly among thosestrongly influenced by the Bengali tradition, women play a very import-ant role in the preparation of the food offered to the DevÃ. While some   21See Beck (1993:121-147).22The so-called Maliya cassette contains a well-loved collection of thesegamanisongs interspersed between a dramatic and extremely popular recitation of excerptsof theDurgÀSapta×atÃby Virendra Krishna Bhadra."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"HILLARY RODRIGUES 86people may choose to fast during the NavarÀtras, for others DurgÀPÅjÀis a time of sumptuous feasting. The finest food is prepared and offeredto the DevÃand subsequently eaten by the devotees and guests. Thereare noteworthy restrictions in this extremely important ritual of feeding.Young virgin girls (under the age of twelve), who have not yet beguntheir menstrual cycle, are permitted to participate in the preparation ofthe uncooked food offerings. Once they have begun their menstruation,they are forbidden from preparing (or even touching) any of the food.Married women are generally permitted to touch and prepare theuncooked and cooked food offerings to minor deities. DurgÀand KÀlÃ,however, are major deities. During the DurgÀPÅjÀ, pre-menopausalmarried women are generally restricted from any involvement with thefood. Widows are restricted from all food preparations. Post-menopausal women are the most “pure”and may prepare the food (bothcooked and uncooked) to minor deities. Only women who have taken aspecialØÀkta initiation are permitted to prepare the food for theGoddess. Naturally, the women with the highest status in this hierarchyare post-menopausal initiated women. I suggest that the raw food offerings are symbolic parallels of theyoung virgins in whom menstrual blood has not yet begun to flow. Bothrepresent the pure, inactive, but highly potent fertility of the earth, theincipient creation, the integral Goddess herself. Menstruating butunmarried women represent an inauspicious state of blossoming butuntapped fertility: a fertile field which has not been sown, a tree whichdoes not bear fruit.23Similarly, widows embody the inauspicious natureof failed nurturing for they stand in contrast to the married mother intraditional Hindu thought who is supposed to sustain her spouse and heroffspring through her fecund, nurturing, and nourishing power. Theorthodox ideal would have women die happily married before theirhusbands. Post-menopausal women return to a state of virgin-like puritybecause their menstrual blood flow has ceased. They symbolize andembody the return to spiritual integrity from creative materialdiversification.   23Julia Leslie has discerningly pointed our how the state of ‘womanhood’isconsidered inauspicious in orthodox Hindu thought. Orthodox tradition encourageswomen to move from the auspicious state of a virgin girl (kanyÀ) directly to that of awife (patnÃ), particularly one utterly dedicated to her husband(pativratÀ). See Leslie(1991b:189-190)."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"THE WORSHIP OF THE GREAT GODDESS 87E.GoddessThe most significant role played by women during the NavarÀtras is asthe Goddess herself. This identification is explicit in the ritual worshipof virgins (kumÀrÃpÅjÀ). The KumÀrÃPÅjÀis generally performed onthe ninth day of NavarÀtra, or on the conjunction period (sandhi)between the eighth and ninth lunar day (tithi). Although in certaintraditions, such as the Bengali DurgÀPÅjÀ, a malepujÀrÃperforms theritual, in many other communities the KumÀrÃPÅjÀis performed bymarried women for virgin girls. Typically, between one and nine girlsunder the age of twelve are invited to the home of the family that isconducting the ritual. The girls are treated as living forms of theGoddess. They may each be placed on a large brass platter where theirfeet are washed and decorated with red lacquer (altÀ). Following theritual patterns observed when worshipping the DevÃ, the girls are givena seat (Àsana), their hair rubbed with oil, and they are each given somedecorative ornament.24They are fed with sweets, presented with an itemof clothing, such as a scarf (cunri), and given some money (dakùiõÀ).KumÀrÃs, with whom I have conversed, generally said they found it avery pleasant experience. An important symbolic component of thispÅjÀis revealed in thedietary patterns of the women involved in this ritual. In orthodox NorthIndianbrÀhmaõafamilies, the married women maintain a fast, eating adiet of uncooked or unrefined food for the first eight days of NavarÀtra.“We think DurgÀis also fasting like us,”I was told by one of thewomen. On the ninth day, they feed thekumÀrÃs cooked food such asdeep fried bread (pÅrÃ), curried vegetables (sabjÃ), andhalvÀ, a sweetmade from coarsely ground flour (sÅjÃ), sugar,ghÃ, and dried fruits. Atthis point the married women, too, end their own fast. The raw oruncooked food, symbol of the virginal Goddess andkumÀrÃ, eatenthroughout the NavarÀtra, is replaced at the end of the festival by theripe and cooked food, symbol of the fertile Goddess. The collectivefertile energy of the married females is harnessed through their fast.Furthermore, through the diet of uncooked food, they align themselveswith their own pre-menstrual state and that of the virgin girls of thecommunity. In the KumÀrÃPÅjÀ, through what appears to be an act of   24A simple token ornament may be stick-on decorative forehead dots (Hindi:bindÃ)."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"HILLARY RODRIGUES 88sympathetic magic, the married women transfer their fertile energy tothe girls, encouraging or eliciting a maturation in them. The virginalGoddess has changed into the fertile Goddess, within whom flowsmenstrual blood, the vital substance capable of engendering life andnourishing it.25 Married women, too, are identified with the DevÃduring the DurgÀPÅjÀ, although this is an implicit equation. In popular thought, the DevÃDurgÀis identified with PÀrvatÃ, the wife of the ascetic godØiva. Uponher marriage DurgÀ/PÀrvatÃleft her parents’home to join her husbandØiva who dwells atop Mount KailÀsa in the HimÀlaya mountains.During the NavarÀtras, DurgÀ/PÀrvatÃis thought to return to the home ofher parents, Himavat and MenÀ.26In a human parallel of this myth,married daughters who have left to live with their husbands, return totheir parents’homes during the NavarÀtras. They are likened to theGoddess and treated specially during this time. They are encouraged torelax and not perform the chores of cooking and cleaning which theywould normally do in their own homes (often under the watchful eye oftheir husband’s mother). The animated atmosphere which is generatedby the feminine presence of all the married daughters and their children,happily reunited in their parents’home, is seen as a palpablemanifestation of the Goddess’s presence in the household. Towards theend of the Bengali DurgÀPÅjÀ, in an act which symbolizes their enjo-yment in their parents’home, the women eat and feed each othersweets. These human manifestations of DurgÀ/PÀrvatÃare also beingsymbolically fattened up before their return to lives of austerity andhardship with theirØiva-like husbands. Other explicit identifications of women with the Goddess may takeplace among left-hand Tantrics during their NavarÀtra rituals.27Theserituals are often performed in secret, and may only be participated in bythose who have received special initiations (dÃkùa). I was informed byself-professed male Tantrics that they engaged in a special five-element(pañcatattva) ritual on the confluence of the eighth and ninth solar days   25There are numerous other symbols of fertility in the NavarÀtra ritual. One of themost ubiquitious is an effigy considered to be an embodiment of the Goddess madeof a water-filled earthen jar (kala×a), topped with leaf-bearing twigs, and a coconutfruit. It is set on alow earthen altar which is sown with seeds. 26See, for instance, theØiva-PurÀõa, Rudra-saühitÀfor a version of this myth. 27On Tantrism, consult Gupta, et al 1979, Goudriaan and Gupta 1981, Bharati1965, and Brooks 1990."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"THE WORSHIP OF THE GREAT GODDESS 89of the NavarÀtras. This ritual worship, performed in the dead of night(mahÀni×ÀpÅjÀ), includes partaking in offerings of meat (mÀüsa),liquor (mada), and sexual congress (maithuna). In the sexual act, thefemale partner is identified with the Goddess, envisioned as thedynamic energy (Øakti) which animates the cosmos. She unites with themale Tantric who embodies the static male principle (Øiva). Ifsuccessfully performed, the integrative union with the Absolute, whichtranscends the duality inherent in the bipolar symbolism of male andfemale principles, is achieved. It is particularly significant that often inTantric rituals, women with the lowest status, such as women andprostitutes, are venerated as embodiments of the Goddess. Suchidentifications elevate the auspiciousness of womanhood in all itsaspects.Appraisal of the Activities, Roles, and Images of Women in Worship ofthe Great GoddessIt is clear from the foregoing descriptions that the Great Goddess is theobject of devotion by both men and women in the Hindu tradition. Inmy qualitative judgement, equal numbers of men and women visitmajor DevÃtemples during the NavarÀtras and I would therefore suggestthat the Goddess does not receive a markedly greater devotion fromwomen than from men. However, I have drawn attention to what appearto be differences in the ritual worship patterns of the sexes. The motivesbehind men’s devotional pledges (manauti) were self-centred, althoughI do not mean this in a pejorative way. Men generally seek to enhancetheir personal accomplishments (siddhi) and wealth (artha), throughwhich they may benefit their wives, children, families and friends. Incontrast, women generally seek the well-being of their marital relation-ships, place their husband and children’s well-being first, and in sodoing enjoy personal good fortune (saubhÀgya). The ascetic dimensions of spiritual practice, namely, malesÀdhanÀand femalevratas appear to have the same differences in motivationalpurposes. However, they also differ partly in the types of practicesengaged in by the respective sexes. Men may perform ritualizedrecitations of theDurgÀSapta×atÃand independently offer sacred fireoblations. Women do not. However women may perform pilgrimages toparticular goddesses, such as the Nine GaurÃs, who although theyrepresent the Great Goddess during the NavarÀtras, do not function in"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"HILLARY RODRIGUES 90this role for men. I suggest that this is because the Nine GaurÃs embodycharacteristics which specifically satisfy the desired goals of women,such as beauty, fertility, increasing their purity and auspiciousness, andobtaining successful marriages.28What is particularly noteworthy hereis that not only do ritual practices vary, but that there are choice ofimages of the MahÀdevÃ, too, which may differ between the sexes. The most significant differences between male and female religiosityduring the NavarÀtras is in the role and image of women during thesefestivals. Although men may overwhelmingly serve in the role of ritualspecialists (pujÀrÃ), and although both sexes may function as healers orstrive to procure the DevÃ’s grace and power for artistic or otherreasons, it is exclusively women who are identified with the DevÃandher feminine attributes. This identification of women with the Goddessduring the NavarÀtras is not isolated to select sects or cultural comitiesbut is widespread throughout India. While it may seem natural forwomen to be identified with the Goddess, there are no comparableidentifications of males with supreme gods during festivals. It is truethat spiritually elevated males may be identified with the AbsoluteBrahman, however this principle of supreme reality is generally con-ceived of as transcending gender. Brahman is neither male nor female.At times, while engaged in the performance of certain rituals (e.g.,kuõóalinÃyoga) men may embody the supreme male principle ofgodhead (parama×iva).29Alternatively, they may strive to emulate thequalities of such deities as RÀma, or Kçùõa on a daily basis, but there isno widespread yearly festival or religious ritual during which ordinarymen are unequivocally identified and worshipped as embodiments of asupreme male deity.30 It is worth pursuing the question why such a difference existsbetween the image of women and men in the Hindu tradition. Ibelieve that clues to the answer lie in the institution of marriage   28See Rodrigues 1993 for a detailed speculative examination of the nature of theNine GaurÃs. I have also suggested there that the Nine DurgÀs, in contrast, serve as amore comprehensive set of images of the Great Goddess since they are meaningful toboth men and women.29On KuõóalinÃYoga, see Silburn 1988, Bharati 1965, and Brooks 1990.30Anderson 1993 points out how the king might be identified with the god KÀma,orØiva during the annual Spring festival.

The traditional term for“husband”ispati, which means “lord”or “divine lord,”(i.e., god).31A late medieval text, theStrÃdharmapaddhati(Manual on the Duty ofWomen) reinforces the view that a woman should regard her husbandas a deity, the highest object of her devotion.The good woman always regards her husband as a god...For thehusband is god for women...There is no goal, no deity like thehusband.32Despite such precepts, women’s actual attitudes to men vary from theorthodox position created and upheld by thebrÀhmaõamale tradition.Nevertheless, I often heard women, even from non-brÀhmaõaclasses,or widows who said they had experienced unhappy marriages, refer totheir husbands as “divine lord”(patideva).33Clearly, the notion thatthe husband (alive or deceased) should be regarded by married womenand widows as a god is pervasive in the Hindu tradition. This conceptis passed on to girls and unmarried women through more subtlemodes of cultural transmission than textual prescriptions. There are nofestivals which promote the view since it is a cultural notion which isdeeply embedded in Hindu society and thus taken for granted.But what about women? It is clear that their influential role in thehappiness of the home has always been recognized. The classictreatise on Hindu duty, theManusmçtistates:The house in which female relations, not being honoured, pronounce acurse, perishes completely as if destroyed by magic. Hence men whoseek happiness should always honour women on holidays and festivalswith gifts of jewellery, clothes, and good food. In that family where thehusband is pleased with his wife and the wife with her husbandhappiness will assuredly be lasting (Manusmçti,III, 58f).The husband is enjoined to honour his wife on all festivals andholidays. Furthermermore, theManusmçti(IX, 26) and texts such as   31For studies of Hindu marriage see Altekar 1973, Apte 1978, and Leslie 1991b.For the relationship between marriage and concepts of the Goddess, see Coburn1982, Gatwood 1985, Harman 1989, Jacobson 1978, Leslie 1991a, Fruzetti 1982, andShulman 1980.32 Leslie 1991a:108, quoting fromStrÃdharmapaddhati32r.5-6, 32v.8-9.33 I wish to stress that orthodox tradition does not just expect a woman to worshipher husband as “a god”but as “the god”, the sole or supreme form of the Divine."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"HILLARY RODRIGUES 92theMahÀbhÀrata(13.11.10ff) do state that there is no differencebetween virtuous wives and the goddess of fortune (ØrÃ).34If this is so,should not women be worshipped by their husbands as goddessesthroughout the year, just as men are to be always worshipped as godsby their wives? Or, just as a man may worship a male deity, such asRÀma or Kçùõa whom he emulates, could not a woman worship, asher primary deity, the goddess whom she embodies? Julia Leslie(1991a:113) offers an answer to the second question. She points outhow in Tryambakayajvan’sStrÃdharmapaddhati, an eighteenthcentury orthodox treatise on the duties of women, the goddessØrÃisupheld as a model deity for women to emulate, but not as a deity to beworshipped in lieu of their husbands. Thus orthodox prescriptionswould have women model themselves after domestic goddesses, suchasØrÃ, GaurÃ,orSÃtÀ, provided these goddesses were lovingly andutterly devoted to their male spouses. So women may emulate thegoddessØrÃ. They may worshipØrÃas long as thedevÃdoes notreplace the exalted place of the husband in their lives.35Women mayeven be considered as embodiments of the goddessØrÃ. And yet, if thelatter identification is possible, why are men are not enjoined toworship their wives as embodiments of the divine such as theauspicious spouse goddessØrÃ, at all times? Why is there thisdifference between the images of husbands, who are perpetuallydivine, and wives, who are not? Perhaps the answer to this question lies in a particular dualisminherent in many schools of Hindu thought such as the ancient orthodox(Àstika) system of SÀükhya and numerous philosophies influenced byit. In these schools, the principle of spirit (puruùa) came to be equatedwith the male, and the principle of matter (prakçti) with the female.36   34On the goddessØrÃ, see Leslie 1991, Narayanan 1982, and Kinsley 1986.35My own field research indicates that the qualities of domestic auspiciousnesspresent in the goddessØrÃare fully encompassed by the Great Goddess of theNavarÀtras. However the Great Goddess also transcends spousal affiliations. She isindependent and autonomous and not subject to the authority of any maledeity. Assuch she serves as a deity who may be worshipped by males and by females since hersubsidiary domestic aspects serve as models of fecundity, nurturing, andauspiciousness for female worshippers who align themselves with orthodoxy.36This denotation of gender to the dual principles is present the grammatical formof the terms. Puruùa is a masculine noun, which denotes a male being or man, whilePrakçti is a feminine noun. TheSÀükhya KÀrikÀs and commentaries pick up on thisgender difference. In aparticular simile, He (Puruùa) is likened to a spectator who"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"THE WORSHIP OF THE GREAT GODDESS 93While the male principle (puruùa) is utterly transcendent and inactive,the created cosmos is perceived of as a movement from pure sublimeintegrity (pradhÀna prakçti) to impure diversification. While the maleprinciple is never tainted, the female principle, by virtue of its creativenature spans the spectrum from the very pure to the most polluted. Thetransformations of Prakçti are described through the concept of threequalities (guõa) which are inherent in all of its diverse manifestations.In its most subtle manifestations, Prakçti is filled with the quality ofpurity, thesattva guõa, while its grossest manifestations are thick withthe quality of darkness and pollution, thetamas guõa. Therajas guõa,whose symbol is blood, is the quality of activity or passion whichcharacterizes the vital processes of material creation. Although among devout DevÃworshippers, the Great Goddessencompasses and transcends all dualisms, including notions such asPuruùa and Prakçti, a prevailing attitude is to equate the DevÃwith Prakçti. Similarly, women, the human feminine, are also thought to embodythe nature of Prakçti. However, there is, I suggest, a crucial difference inHindu thought between women and the Goddess, for while the DevÃrepresents a fully pure, sacred, and transcendent Prakçti, women aremanifestations of a worldly Prakçti. Through the ebb and flow of theirmenstrual cycles, which plunge them into periods of pollution, andthrough their association with child-bearing and nurturing, which linkthem with the cycles of rebirth and worldly existence (saüsÀra),women stand in opposition to the highest human goal (puruùÀrtha)ofliberation (mokùa) from the vagaries of change, and the endless roundsof existence, death, and rebirth.37 Therefore, the nature of women in traditional Hindu thought isambivalent. Negatively, women are often portrayed as fickle and unpre-dictable, like the forces of Nature.38Or they are seductively alluring,capable of shaking the resolute detachment of even the most capableworld renouncers, enmeshing all in the cycle of worldly existence (saüsÀra).39However, women are also viewed, by men, as prized   eventually grows tired of Her (Prakçti’s) repeat dance performances.

Through women, human life isengendered, sustained, and empowered, and thus given the opportunityto enjoy worldly pleasures (bhoga) or gain liberation (mokùa). Such apolar conception of womanhood further prohibits them from beingperennially divine objects of constant devotion. It is not possible tovenerate women during their periods of menstruation, a cycle whichregularly plunges them into a state of pollution according to traditionalBrahmanical standards. One cannot be simultaneously devoted tosaüsÀraand yet desire liberation from it. This reasoning alone might serve to answer why women, intraditional Hindu thought, are not capable of being perpetuallyconsidered pure, auspicious, and thus continually divine. In fact, frommany traditional points of view, women are often grouped with thelowest, or even classless members of society.40It is often stated in pre-scriptive texts that for male world renouncers (sannyÀsa), firmlyintentonliberation (mokùa) from worldly existence (saüsÀra), anycontact with women is detrimental. Thus women’s association withperiodic pollutions renders them constantly inauspicious in certainschools of Hindu thought. Were this attitude held by all male membersof Hindu society, and its implications acted upon, there would be littleinteraction between the sexes. Clearly, the notion that women bear apersistent or continual impurity is not the cultural norm. There arecultural beliefs or ritual actions which enable women to discard theirpolluted status. Menstruation, for example, although it is deemed apolluted state, is sometimes viewed as a process through which womenare purified and renewed. More often, women purify themselvesthrough a post-menstruation ritual bath (çtusnÀna). Even so, the regularentries into states of pollution, and the need for subsequent acts ofpurification, do not lend womanhood an elevated status on the scale ofauspiciousness.41 Nevertheless, for the satisfactory functioning of society, to enable itsstructures to be maintained so that men and women may unite, produce   of “woman,”or the inherent nature of women (strÃsvabhÀva) in Sanskrit religious law“is almost invariably negative”(Leslie 1991b:189). This view is nuanced and evenopposed by the vision of the feminine found in someØÀkta and Tantric literature.40See, for instance, theBhagavad GÃtÀ. IX.32.41 Even those malebrÀhmaõapriests who regularly work in polluting activitiessuch as death rituals are considered low on the status scale ofbrÀhmaõas despitetheir purification rituals."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"THE WORSHIP OF THE GREAT GODDESS 95offspring, heirs, and so on, even those men who consider themselves tobe extremelysattvic(i.e., pure), such as the highest castebrÀhmaõas,should view women as adequately pure and auspicious marital partners.Said differently, although women are inauspicious due to their pollutingassociations, they need to be ritually elevated in status on the scale ofauspiciousness to be suitable spouses for men who are thought toembodysÀttvicpurity. Thus the “feminine”in general, and womanhoodand women in particular, must be collectively, regularly, and publiclysanctified through ritual action. This collective elevation inauspiciousness of the feminine does not free women from the need toperiodically purify themselves after their polluting cycles, such as men-struation. Besides these regular rituals of purification, women maythereafter nurture and enhance their purity and auspiciousness (sau-bhÀgya) through spiritual practices such asvratas. In fact, suchpractices are probably deemed almost essential for a woman whowishes to elevate her auspiciousness further, or maintain it at levelsdeemed commensurate with her spouse. The divine precedent of such aprocess has already been articulated. Mythologically, even the supremeasceticØiva, the world-renouncerpar excellence, was induced intofulfilling the demands of socialdharmathrough his marriage to GaurÃ,asupremely pure female spiritual practitioner, leading to the subsequentbirth of their son, Skanda.42 I suggest that the NavarÀtras serve the important function ofproviding an overarching auspiciousness and sanctity to the “feminine”which is otherwise prone to the cadences of purity and pollution,auspiciousness and inauspiciousness. The festivals achieve this endthrough processes of reconstitution and rejuvenation of the body cosmosof the DevÃ, and through the simultaneous identification of women withthe Goddess. The Great Goddess, although identified with Prakçti,transcends its profane, mundane, inauspicious character. Because herimage encompasses the nature of womanhood in all its stages andaspects, even those traditionally considered to be inauspicious orimpure, the DevÃconfers on womanhood a sacred, purifying, and divinestatus. Although it is true that the DevÃwho is worshipped during theDurgÀPÅjÀof theÂ×vina NavarÀtra is generally conceived of byworshippers as a virgin or a mother, both of which are auspicious states,   42See theØiva-purÀõa, Rudra-saühitÀ3-4."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"HILLARY RODRIGUES 96she actually also embodies many states normally considered inaus-picious for a woman. For instance, the DevÃas portrayed in theDurgÀSapta×atÃ, who is worshipped during the NavarÀtras, is an alluringwoman, attractive to the demons Mahiùa,Øumbha, and Ni×umbha as apotential spouse. Yet as an unattached woman, past puberty (attested toby her well-formed breasts), the Goddess is in a social and physicalstate which Brahmanical orthodoxy considers undesirable, and highlyinauspicious for women. In the DurgÀPÅjÀritual itself, women in thatsocio-physical state are prohibited from even touching any of the foodofferings. This means that during the NavarÀtras, through the image ofthe Goddess, both male and female devotees are actually worshippingthe “feminine,”as the most sublime form of the Divine, not merelywhen the “feminine”is in an auspicious state, but in states which aretraditionally perceived to be quite inauspicious.43Similarly, as MÀtaïgÃ,one of the forms and epithets of the Great Goddess worshipped duringthe NavarÀtras, the DevÃ’s image is that of an uncouth, outcastewomen.44As KÀtyÀyanÃand DhÅmÀvatÃ, she is worshipped as a widow,another inauspicious social condition.45It should be stressed thatalthough the forms of the DevÃwhich belong to such inauspicious social   43I even heard from a male Tantric practitioner that the DurgÀPÅjÀtook placeduring the days of the DevÃ’s menstruation. Almost no-one else shared this opinion,although I heard on more than one occasion, from men, that the DevÃ’s colour(golden) corresponded to thecolour of menstrual fluid, puzzling as that may sound.(The termgaura, from which the goddess GaurÃ’s name is derived, may signify thecolour yellow or red).BrÀhmaõapandits told me that the menstruation (rajasvalÀ)of the DevÃ(as the Earth) traditionally takes place during AmbuvÀcÃ, a three and ahalf day period in the month ofÂùÀóha. In the pool of the DevÃcave temple atKÀmarÅpa, Assam, the water turns reddish brown, and is collected by devotees for itsauspicious power. While menstrual blood is normally considered inauspiciousandpolluting, the DevÃ’s menstrual secretions are quite the reverse. Mary Douglas (1970)has discussed at length the dangerous power associated with what cultures deem tobe polluting states and substances, such as menstruating women and menstrual blood.Although these human substances are often treated with great caution, whenrituallymanipulated and thus controlled, even they may become objects of worship due totheir potency. Therefore, the menstruating DevÃand her menstrual blood areembodiments of an awesome, but highly auspicious, dangerous power.44For more on the nature of MÀtaïgÃsee Kinsley 1986:163, 207-208 and 1997:209-222.

As a result, when the “feminine”in all stages oflife, from all segments of society, and in all social conditions isvenerated during the NavarÀtras as the Divine Feminine, the GreatGoddess, it is the human feminine, woman, that is collectively purifiedand rendered auspicious. The NavarÀtras are periods during which the world, the body cosmosof the DevÃ, is literally recreated ritually, and thus rejuvenated andpurified.46Thus the purification of the “feminine”is accomplishedthrough the reconstitution of the Goddess, whose manifest body isessentially thought of as the creation. This ritual construction of thecosmos, which must be repeated at regular intervals, mirrors the cyclicalpatterns observable in nature, but more importantly, exercises anordering influence on what might otherwise be an uncontrolled andchaotic creation. Although the NavarÀtra rituals are intended to shapeand control every level and aspect of the cosmic manifestation, from itsinception to its demise, the strongest influences are expected to beexerted at the plane of human existence, namely, on the world andhuman society. Even the timing and mythological themes of the NavarÀtras aresuggestive of rejuvenation and reestablishing order. TheÂ×vina andCaitra NavarÀtras coincide with the most pleasant times of the year, theautumn and spring, which offer relief from the searing heat of thesummer, the humidity and disruptive floods caused by the monsoons,and the unpleasant cold of the winter season.47The Caitra NavarÀtra is aspring festival and the first to mark what is generally considered theNew Year in Banaras (Eck 1982:258).48It stands as evidence for theritual role played by the NavarÀtras in the rejuvenation of the cycles oftime. Similarly, the month ofÂ×vina marks the end of the rainy season   46It is outside the scope of this chapter to discuss this ritual process of recreatingand rejuvenating the body of the DevÃ. During the DurgÀPÅjÀritual, the DevÃisawakened in a localized, rudimentary form such as a wide-bodied jar (ghaña),composed of earthand water. She is then invoked into progressively more complexor expansive forms. These forms include trees, anthropomorphic clay images, cosmicdiagrams, and living virgin girls. Readers are referred to Rodrigues 1993.47The beginning ofÂ×vina is classically thought to coincide with the autumnalequinox, and the vernal equinox with the beginning of the month of Caitra.Astronomically this has changed (Klostermaier 1989:417).48On the role of spring festivals in Hindu tradition see Anderson 1993."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"HILLARY RODRIGUES 98and the time when kings traditionally waged war to expand theirkingdoms. TheÂ×vina NavarÀtra is associated with kingship andwarfare. Its first celebration by human beings is attributed to the princeRÀma. In the mythic tale of the divine hero RÀma’s righteous war withthe demon RÀvaõa, in order to regain his abducted goddess-queen, SÃtÀ,or in the myth of the goddess DurgÀ’s victory over the buffalo demonMahiùa, and in the traditional territorial expansion of monarchs inaccord with the dictates ofkùatriya dharma(the duty of warriors), onenotices the theme of reconstituting space and society through righteouskingly control, and the reestablishment of good fortune andauspiciousness on the earth.49 In keeping with the intention to rejuvenate and revitalize the creation,the NavarÀtra rituals work to induce vivifying juice to flow within it.The sacrifices of blood (balidÀna) spilled onto the soil in offerings tothe Goddess, the sprouting of grains sowed in an earthen altar, and othersuch practices which are part of the NavarÀtra rituals suggest the themesof encouraging fertility and fecundity in the earth, in seeds, in plants,and in women. Although the NavarÀtras are periods in which thefeminine in general, and womanhood in particular, is venerated in all itsaspects and stages, one notices that three stages of womanhood areactually given primacy over others.50These are the pre-menstrualvirgin, the married woman, and the post-menopausal mother. Iunderstand this structuring of the developmental course of womanhood,through the encouragement of particular states within it, to be anattempt to orchestrate ritually the flow of creative juices (i.e., blood)through which the creative feminine (i.e., woman) develops. The cre-ation (i.e., the feminine) cannot be allowed to unfold chaotically. In the KumÀrÃPÅjÀ, we see the explicit worship of the young,pristine feminine, full of potential. The pre-menstrual virgin is thesymbol of purity and rejuvenation. She is highly auspicious. Creativejuices (i.e., menstrual blood) has not yet begun to flow within her.

It is not merelythe fecundity of the feminine that is sought, but the regulatedmanagement of that fertility. For although the transition fromkumÀrÃtomenstruating woman is sought and ritually encouraged, the unmarriedmenstruating female is thought to enter a liminal state of unpredictableenergy, and ungoverned possibilities. Through marriage, child-bearing,and nurturing her spouse and offspring, the creative juice (rasa)ofwomen is thought to be channeled productively. The pre-menstrual girlis under the social control of her parental family, symbolized by herfather. The married woman is under the social control of her spouse’sfamily, symbolized by her husband. In such a social construction, thewidow is naturally an inauspicious state of womanhood for, like themenstruating unmarried daughter she represents the fertile feminine freefrom traditional social constraints. The post-menopausal mother isunder the social constraints of her offspring’s families, symbolized byher son.51She is beyond reproductive possibilities and thus no longerassociated with the saüsÀric cycles of rebirth. Since the flow ofmenstrual blood within her has ceased, she enters a state of perennialpurity, no longer subject to the periodic pollutions of menstruation. Herspecial status is confirmed through her sanction to prepare cooked foodofferings for deities.ConclusionWhile the patterns of worship of the Goddess during the NavarÀtrasdiffer between men and women in significant ways, as do their roles andimages, both sexes participate in the ritual construction and maintenanceof a universe within which the cycles of nature are rendered meaningful,and social structures and human actions are orderly and harmonious.Since the created cosmos is envisioned as the manifest body of theGoddess, the control of the cosmos involves the control of the DevÃ, theDivine Feminine. This is clearly a tall order, for the Goddess isgenerally conceived of as invincible, her power unsurmountable.Furthermore, she is the source of illusion and ensnares all the cycle ofworldly existence. At best, the DevÃ’s power may be partially   51For such orthodox prescriptions about keeping women under control, seeManusmçti(The Laws of Manu) IX.2-16, or V.147-165."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"HILLARY RODRIGUES 100appropriated through such spiritual practices assÀdhanÀandvratas.Alternatively, she may be appeased (throughyÀtrÀandsevÀ), pleased(throughpÅjÀanddar×ana), and supplicated (throughmanauti) for avariety of boons. Although the Divine Feminine may be beyond the control of all butthe most highly attained adepts (siddha yogi), at the microcosmic levelof individuals and society, her form and nature is thought to be manifestin all women. Thus the ritual manipulation of woman is mandatory inattempts to manipulate the cosmos ritually. This perspective is ofcardinal importance when trying to understand the constraints placed onwomen in traditional Hindu society. These are restrictions whichemanate less from an entrenched misogyny than from a sort of cosmicgynophobia, a fear of an uncontrolled feminine creation. Perhaps thisdesignation is extreme for there is not merely a fear of the power andunpredictability of Nature, the feminine, which may bring droughts,famine, disease, and destruction, but a reverence for and attraction to itsbeauty and bounty. Woman is the living microcosmic image of themacrocosm, the manifest body of the Great Goddess. During theNavarÀtras they are identified with each other. I suggest that the veneration of the feminine at these festivals servesseveral functions. The rituals of the festivals elevate the feminine, in allits dimensions, to a high level of purity and auspiciousness throughprocesses of reconstitution and rejuvenation. Even women in low statusand inauspicious states, such as classless women, widows, andunmarried women are implicitly venerated during the NavarÀtra festi-vals, through the encompassing image of the Great Goddess. In hisseminal study of the ritual process Victor Turner (1969:166-203) hasdiscussed the role that festivals may play in status elevation. However,the NavarÀtras are festivals which neither induce a permanent statuselevation for its participants (as in a rite of passage), nor permit atemporary status reversal (as in the HolÃfestival). Instead these festivals,I suggest, induce a temporary status elevation. Womanhood istransformed and purified, elevated in auspiciousness and venerated.However, certain states of womanhood are still given primacy overothers. Thus the festivals serve to maintain orthodox values and socialstructures by giving particularly high status to virgins (through explicitworship), to married women (through implict veneration), and to post-"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"THE WORSHIP OF THE GREAT GODDESS 101menopausal mothers (through ritual sanction).52Unmarried women andwidows, although superficially acknowledged and ritually elevatedthrough the person of the Goddess, are still ranked low through ritualprohibitions (e.g., they are not permitted to touch food preparations orparticipate in the KumÀrÃPÅjÀ).Therefore, through rituallyreconstructing the DevÃ’s body during the NavarÀtras, throughidentifying women with her, and then orchestrating the feminine’sdevelopment and actions, Hindu worshippers participate in a processdesigned to regenerate and vitalize a harmonious orderly creation inwhich their worst fears are dissolved and their greatest hopes arerealized.BIBLIOGRAPHYAltekar, A.

CE) recordswomen’s contribution on many levels. Some women were Sants in theirown right and even today these are fondly remembered and veneratedfor their steadfastbhaktiand beautiful poetry. Two main females whoare celebrated as Sants are JanÀbÀÃ(circa 13th century) who was anorphan maidservant in Sant NÀmdev’s house, and BahiõÀbÀÃ(1628-1700), who was a brahmin housewife, and the first female to havewritten an account in verse of her entire life. Other females such asMuktÀbÀÃ,orKÀnhopÀtrÀhave someabhaïgasrecorded on their namesand occupy a place in the larger circle of Sants. On the other hand, thereare the other women, i.e. women in a male Sant’s life, his mother, sister,wife or daughter, who are remembered mainly for their nuisance valueto the Sant, or as his stepping stones towards his world-weariness. Inaddition to the portrayals of these women that appear in the Sant’s lives,there are stories and anecdotes of women that appear in the poems ofthe Sants. And finally, there are some types of women which are usedby the Sants as paradigm of a virtue or a vice. To my knowledge there isno attempt anywhere, either in English or Marathi, to take in to accountall side of the female representation in the Sant tradition of Maharashtra.There are studies of a particular female Sant, but not a comprehensive   \r An earlier draft of this paper was read in July 1994 at the Sixth International Conference on Early Literature in New Indo-Aryan Languages, and the University of Washington, Seattle, U.S.A."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"VIDYUT AKLUJKAR106study of the female contingent. In order to get a comprehensive visionof the female collective consciousness, we need to look at all thesepictures and caricatures of women in the Sant literature of Maharashtra.Although an exhaustive account of each and every female is animpossibility given the space limitations of this paper, I propose tosurvey and analyse in the first part of this paper, the portrayals ofwomen on either side of thebhaktifence in the Marathi Sant tradition,with special reference to the lives of women related to or associatedwith NÀmdev (1270-1350 CE) and TukÀrÀm (1598-1649 CE). The latterpart of this paper will survey the literary representations of various typesof females, through stories and anecdotes preserved by the Santtradition. My choice of the above two Sants is influenced by practicalconsiderations. These two are chronologically as well as influentiallycentral figures in the extensive Sant tradition of Maharashtra. NÀmdev’sinfluence was felt all the way up to Punjab, and for centuries,TukÀrÀm’s proverbialabhaïgashave become the most used coinage ineveryday Marathi of both the masses and the elite alike. On the namesof both NÀmdev and TukÀrÀm appear exquisitely preserved records ofwomen in their lives who troubled them in their path ofbhakti. At thesame time, both these male Sants have been associated in populartradition with kindred spirits who were women Sants, i.e. NÀmdev withJanÀbÀÃ, and TukÀrÀm with BahiõÀbÀÃ. In short, they offer us the mostcolourful examples of male Sants associated, on the one hand, withfemale Sants and on the other hand, with other females. In addition,they furnish us with many stories and anecdotes of women that they useas stock examples of virtue or vice. Hence, although I will occasionallydraw upon the other Sants, I propose to concentrate mainly on thecluster of women around NÀmdev and TukÀrÀm for the present study.SourcesMy sources of information for this study are the five volumecompilation of the Sants’verses orabhaïga-gÀthÀs, which is based onthevÀrkarÃsect’s traditional canon. There are no critical editions of theworks of JanÀbÀÃor of BahiõÀbÀÃ. And the information about the otherfemales comes to us mainly through someabhaïgason their namesincorporated in the maleabhaïgacollections, or throughabhaïgasabout these females by the male Sants. Therefore in order to study all"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"WOMEN IN THE MARATHI SANT TRADITION 107these females the only choice is to look at the traditional canonicalcollection of all Sants’poems. For a detailed discussion of the variousmanuscripts, partial editions, and an attempt at a critical edition ofTukÀrÀm’s works, I refer the reader to the 1950 edition published by theGovernment Central Press, in Bombay under the editorship ofPurushottem Mangesh Laad. I have used his edition only to compare itwith the standard canonical edition of the works of all Sants which isthe five volume text of theSakala Santa GÀthÀ, (henceforth SSG, forshort,) edited in 1983 by R.C. Dhere. Apart from the SSG, which isessentially based on the 1908 edition of the canonicalSant-gÀthÀtext ofNÀnÀMahÀrÀjSÀkhare, I use the occasional hagiographical accounts asthey appear in the extensive Sant literature. Often, in theabhaïgasonthe names of minor Sants or the wife, the sons or the daughter of a Sant,we find accounts of the incidents in a major Sant’s life that areessentially hagiographical accounts. I have used these as well as thestandard hagiographical works such as MahÃpati’s (1715-1790)Bhakta-vijaya, written in 1762. For that text of BahiõÀbÀÃ’s verses, which werenot included in the above canonical text, I useBahiõÀbÀÃcÀGÀthÀ(second edition, 1956) published by the ChitrashÀlÀPress, Pune. Alltranslations in this paper are mine.Part oneAs mentioned above, JanÀbÀÃof NÀmdev’s house, and TukÀrÀm’sdisciple BahiõÀbÀÃare the two female Sants whose works we shallexamine in this paper. Who are the women we consider as being on theother side of thebhaktifence? They are mother GoõÀÃand wife RÀjÀÃfrom NÀmdev’s house andÂvalÃ, the second wife from TukÀrÀm’s. Abrief introduction is in order here. Sant NÀmdev was the only son ofGoõÀÃand DÀmÀjÃwho were tailors by caste and profession and lived inPaõóharpur. His mother GoõÀÃand his wife RÀjÀÃ, are the two womenwho figure in the story of NÀmdev’s early conflicts with the mundane.There areabhaïgason the name of these two women, and they getmentioned in theabhaïgasof the other members of NÀmdev’s familyas well as in the verse-stories of the later hagiographer MahÃpatiTaherabadkar. Sant TukÀrÀm, a merchant of Dehu, mentions his mother,first wife and daughter occasionally to talk of the bonds of worry, desireand delusion that he has severed (bÀÃla melÃ, mukta jhÀlÃ/ deve§ mÀyÀ"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"VIDYUT AKLUJKAR108soóavilÃ// pore§ melÃ§, bare§ jhÀle§ / deve§ mÀyÀvirahita kele§ //SSG 4:65), but his second wifeÂvalÃwas his major adversary. Hertrials and tribulations in her marriage to TukÀrÀm have beenimmortalised in many of theabhaïgason TukÀrÀm’s name. The oraltradition in Maharashtra remembers her name asÂvalÃ, or sometimes asJijÀÃ. However, in TukÀrÀm’s verses, she is mentioned only asstrÃor“woman,”unless he is calling her names such aspisÃ,lÀnsÃ,orrÀõóa,i.e., “a madwoman, a slut, or a bitch.”Even in MahÃpati’sBhakta-vijaya, other Sant’s wives or mothers are mentioned by names, butTukÀrÀm’s harassed wife remains a nameless woman, astrÃ.This issurprising in view of the facts that MahÃpati claims to be a disciple ofTukÀrÀm, devotes three and a half chapters of hisBhakta-vijaya(chapter 48, 49, 50, and part of 51) to TukÀrÀm’s life and in chapter 49,he chooses to gloss at length on the eleven verses of TukÀrÀm’sinwhich TukÀrÀm instructs his contrary wife on the significance of hislifestyle steeped inbhakti. In short, although TukÀrÀm’s domestic lifeand its strife remains of central importance to his major hagiographer,the main thrust in MahÃpati’s account is to exalt TukÀrÀm, and true tothat spirit, the Sant’s wife remains nameless. I shall start by examiningthe roles of these lesser known women in the lives of the two Sants intheir chronological order, and later deal with the more famous womenSants associated with them. At the beginning of theAbhaïga GÀthÀof NÀmdev, there is aprologue of his biography in verse, and in it are several sections whereconversations are recorded between GoõÀÃand NÀmdev, GoõÀÃandGod, God and NÀmdev, and all three together. I am not concerned herewith the issue of authorship of theseabhaïgas, since to me, it is enoughthat theseabhaïgasrecord the popular tradition of conflict betweenNÀmdev and his family. There seems to be little doubt that there was aconflict between the Sant’s uncompromising worship and the householdduties he failed to perform. Many of the incidents here find mentionagain in theabhaïgason the name of NÀmdev’s sons, some inJanÀbÀÃ’s, and some are mentioned as well in chapter 4 of MahÃpati’sBhakta-vijaya. My discussion essentially follows the accounts as theyappear in theabhaïgasattributed to NÀmdev. In theseabhaïgasthere isa lot of repetition and many time the same thought is expressed inslightly different words, in a manner consistent with recording multiple"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"WOMEN IN THE MARATHI SANT TRADITION 109versions of an oral tradition. But the human drama emerging from thesestory-poems is fascinating. NÀmdev was the child-Sant, and according to traditional accounts, hehad experienced the grace of God early in his life. God used to eat offhis hands, and NÀmdev would share food in God’s house. Naturally, ashe grew up, NÀmdev became thoroughly immersed in God, and startedto live in the temple singing and dancing in ecstasy instead of mindedhis tailoring shop. His parents had brought home a daughter-in-law,RÀjÀÃ, hoping to cure NÀmdev’s excessive addiction to God, but to noavail. Finally, his mother confronted him and poured out her heart in aneffort to make him see the light. GoõÀÃis a concerned mother, and although she is herself worshipfulof the God, she has her feet firm on the ground, and believes in fulfillingher daily duties to the best of her abilities before she can immerseherself in worship. Her arguments stem from her well-defined sense ofduty and are quite consistent with her place in this world as understoodby herself and her society. At first, she praises her son. She tries toremind NÀmdev of her bond to him ever since she carried him in herwomb, and of her pride in him when he was blessed by the God as achild (upajalÀsÃtai§ jÀlÀsantoùa /Ànanda ullÀsa vÀñejÃvÀ// gaõa gotÀmÀjÃkele bÀre nÀva / paõóharÃcÀdeva prasanna kelÀ//SSG 2:37).“When you were born, I was so happy. My heart was full of joy, full ofdelight. You earned a good name among our family and relations. TheGod and PaõóharÃwas pleased with you.”She is not averse to worship,but she avoided. She praises his intelligence and uses his peers asexamples. She says, “NÀmyÀ, you are no longer a child (are nÀmadevÀnavhesÃlekarÅ/SSG 2:31). Look at the other people’s sons, they maynot be as bright as you are, but they look after their parents (tujahÅnalokaÀhetÃÀjñÀna / na visa§batÃkùaõa mÀyabÀpÀ//SSG 2:30). They dosomething worthwhile with their lives. Look at you on the other hand.Why, you don’t even glance at the house, let alone the shop, you are atthe feet of this God all day long, singing, dancing, and forgettingyourself altogether. We have seen plenty of devotees, but you are totallymindless of your own good. What kind of other-worldly worship is this?NÀmyÀ, it has burnt your family to ashes (kaisÃtujhÃbhaktÃlaukikÀvagaëÃ/ saüsÀrÀcÃhoëÃkelÃnÀmyÀ//SSG 2:29). Cure thisaddiction to God; why are you bent on total destruction (lit. drowning)"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"VIDYUT AKLUJKAR110of home (sÀõóÃdevapise§ karÅnako aise§ / baëe§ ghara kaise§budavÃsÃ//SSG 2:28)?” To this, NÀmdev simply confesses that he is fed up with the worldwhich is nothing but poison and that therefore, his only hope is God. Headvises GoõÀÃto join him, stay there in God’s PaõóharÃ, rather thanleaving for that strange place she calls home. Of course, the battle ofwits is unresolved and she answers by expressing her firm resolve tosucceed in her mission, and take him home instead. Now she turns toaddress God, and demands that He give her back her son. In this appealto God in fourteenabhaïgas, she uses request, accusations,provocations, threats, and finally, out of exasperation, total submission(SSG 2:39, 40, 42, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 51, 52, 55, 57, 58). God triesto tell her in many words why the matter is no longer in His hands (SSG2:41, 43, 50, 53, 54). He describes NÀmdev’s God-centered attitude,acquired as a result of deeds in many births, his utter distaste for theworld, his firm resolve not to leave God, and his true devotion whichmakes him realise all his worldly relations in God. This is no news toGoõÀÃ. That is what she is fighting at the moment, and with a woman’slogic, when her son leaves her side for God, she tries to make God herally. She asks God, “You are the Lord in possession of the wholeuniverse, what do You lack (tuja kÀya uõeü barhmÀõóanÀyakÀ/navhesÃmaja sÀrikhÀekadesÃ//SSG 2:48)? Why must You snatchaway the one and only son that I have? Are You tired of being the Oneand Only? If You are thirsty for company, must You take away the onlyson of a poor tailor? Have You forgotten who called You here inPaõóharÃin the first place, and for ages to come, who made You standsteady on this brick? It was Puõóalik, the devotee who was so good tohis old parents that even when You came to his door, he would not getup from the service of his old father, and threw You a brick to standupon while You were waiting for him (SSG 2:51). God, why don’t Yousmarten up? Why do You hanker after someone else’s wealth (goõÀÃmhaõe devÀhoÃkÀ§×ahÀõÀ/vÀ§yÀ§kÀ§ paradhanÀdharisÃlobha //SSG 2:38)? Why should You lure away other people’s children? Nowremember Your reputation as a merciful God, and unite me with mystray calf (SSG 2:42).”If God does not comply, she threatens to sit atHis door and go on a hunger strike (tujhe dvÀrÃbaisonÃupavÀsa karÃna /nÀmÀgheuna jÀÃna guõa rÀ×Ã//SSG 2:62). God showers her with praiseand congratulations for giving birth to a great devotee (SSG 2:54), but"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"WOMEN IN THE MARATHI SANT TRADITION 111she is not flattered. At last the God asks GoõÀÃ, “How can He abandonthe devotee who has come to Him in good faith? Who will then believein Truth?”(SSF 2:54). When she fails to bring God to her side, GoõÀÃbegs the other Sants to put some sense in NÀmdev, but they too, echoGod and praise her for her fortune instead. Her resolve to go home withNÀmdev or stay there indefinitely and reason with God is undiminished.Finally God cannot take it any more, and He says to NÀmdev, “Yourmother has set her heart on you, go back to her. After all, she has raisedyou on her own milk, you should not abandon her.”NÀmdev answersthat God is not being fair. NÀmdev had turned to God in the first placeout of fear of his mother, so how can God send him back to her (nÀmÀmhaõe×araõaÀlo§ jicyÀbheõe§ / tice hÀtÃdeõe ucita navhe //SSG2:68)? When neither the headstrong mother nor her stubborn son listensto God, He resorts to a miracle. He tells GoõÀÃto take back NÀmdev,and when she gladly does so and starts to walk away, she finds God inher hands instead. God and NÀmdev have become one and the same.This miracle is supposed to have enlightened her; but accordin toanother version, GoõÀÃremains a worldly woman to the core, and resists“enlightenment”based on a miracle with characteristic wit (SSG 2:69).This is how the incident is related: I offer a full translation of theabhaïga:“God became NÀmÀand NÀmÀbecame God in order to test theattitude of GoõÀÃ. (God said,) ‘Here, take back your NÀmÀ, who caresfor him?’She was ecstatic with love. She took him with her by thehand, and as she turned to look, there was God in her hand. She flipped.‘Oh my Father, who wants You? What would I, frail as I am, do withYou? All those sixteen thousand women of Yours, with the eightsuperior ones, all of those would come running to finish me off. By theway, You have given Your work to Puõóalik once, remember, Youcan’t come with me You rascal!’” [She refers here to the traditionalbelief that God promised to remain for ever in Paõóharpur, standing stillon a brick thrown to him by his earlier devotee, Puõóalik.] We do not know whether or not GoõÀÃgave up her mission to try andtame NÀmdev’sbhakti. There are contradictory accounts recorded in thetradition (SSG 2:69, 70; SSG 2: JanÀbÀÃ138). It is more than likely thatshe had to give up and that NÀmdev’s all-encompassingbhaktiwent onwithout regard to his householder’s duties. There is amply evidence to"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"VIDYUT AKLUJKAR112believe that NÀmdev was unaffected by his mother’s arguments. So, onto the next chapter in the war of weltanschaungs. When the mother failsto bring back her son, the wife takes over (SSG 2:84-97; also in SSG 2:NÀmdev’s son Gonda’sabhaïgas9-14). RÀjÀÃhas been a dutiful wife toNÀmdev, and has already given him four sons and two daughters. ButNÀmdev is no longer there. He is lost in hisbhakti. At first, RÀjÀÃtries toreason with her husband, and tells him to listen to his mother. She triesto convey to him her worries, her loneliness, and her sense of havingfailed to older generation, and when he turns a deaf ear to her, sheresorts to something quite logical. Mother GoõÀÃ, as we saw earlier, haddirectly appealed to the God, the cause of her son’s obsession. There isa rationale behind GoõÀÃ’s choice. NÀmdev, as a child-Sant, oftenindulges in calling God ViñhobÀin the feminine gender as his motherViñhÀÃ. In keeping with NÀmdev’s attitude, as a mother to Mother,GoõÀÃtries to reason with the God in broad daylight. RÀjÀÃis NÀmdev’swife, she has no such leverage, as she remains on a lower rung of thehousehold-hierarchical ladder. She is clever though, and more subtlethan her mother-in-law in choosing the time and the person for hermessage. Therefore, in the darkness of midnight, she seeks out the betterhalf of God. Her message to ViñhobÀ, given to Goddess RakhumÀÃtodeliver, is recorded in fiveabhaïgason her name. In what follows, Ioffer a partial translation, enough to set the tone.“O RakhumÀbÀÃ, ask your husband, why has He fooled my husband?He has no clothes, no pot, nothing to eat, but he goes on dancing dayand night like a shameless man. I have got fourteen mouths to feed (thisfact corroborated by JanÀbÀÃin one of herabhaïgasSSG 2: JanÀbÀÃ137) in my house, and I have to go from door to door in order to feedthem. You better realise this and convince Him to find a better way, orelse, this RÀjÀÃof NÀmÀwon’t remain good any more (SSG 2:85).”“How can I describe the ways of these fools? They all becomecrazy at the feet of God. All become charmed and dance like ghosts inbliss. They are all useless in the world, they bow at each other’s feet,and sway in their joy of Brahman.”“Look! My poor naive mother-in-law gave birth to a bright gem.And he has joined hands with the God who reclines over the serpentØeùa. What is poor RÀjÀÃto do?”(SSG 2:86).“Listen RukmÀbÀÃ, you sit in these fine silks, but poverty does notleave me, what am I to do? The fortunate women wear jewellery, I am"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"WOMEN IN THE MARATHI SANT TRADITION 113the unloved one, what can I do? Some get to wear divine robes, andall I have are these worn out rags. It seems that poverty has come torest forever with us, Mother, who will listen to my complaints? Thehut is broken, the wind howls from all side, I have a lot to suffer,Mother, whom shall I tell? Let alone a bed of flowers, let alone amattress, all I have for a bed is a torn quilt. My son and my daughterare ready for marriage, but my husband never comes home. All theneighbours are laughing at us, they say NÀmÀÃis gone crazy (SSG2:88).”“Please ask your husband, why does He make us poor ones sufferso much? What are we to do, Mother, under whose roof shall we sit?He has lured my husband away from me; He does not let him go evenfor a moment. We are poorer by contact with you; how can you notfeel for us? I cannot fathom the entire misery of this world, you betterdo whatever is to be done (SSG 2:89).” The heartfelt agony of a dutiful wife at her wit’s end in theseabhaïgasis hard to miss, but her message falls on deaf ears. NÀmdevdoes not change his ways. Her gentler efforts in vain, RÀjÀÃbecomesdesperate and resorts to the only course available to her. With her sonViñhÀin her hand, and another son NÀrÀon her hips, she goes to theriver BhivarÀat Paõóharpur, and tying her children to herself, shejumps in the river, and gets drowned in a whirlpool. NÀmdev still doesnot heed, but now God takes action. God wakes up from his yogictrance, and uplifts all three of them and brings them to meet NÀmdevwho is still at his temple. NÀrÀcalls out to his father NÀmdev, butNÀmdev tells his son to go back home, and RÀjÀÃ, in total disgust onceagain attempts suicide. This time she finds a dead serpent, cuts it inpieces, cooks it in its own poison, and starts to eat and feed herchildren. But when she lifts the lid, the pot is full of gold. Accordingto one account, this miracle enlightens RÀjÀÃ(SSG 2:90). There are a couple more accounts of RÀjÀÃ’s miseries, her attemptsto resist, or confront the situation, and although the details of herdifficulties may differ, it is noteworthy that the resolution of theconflict always enlists the help of a miracle. Another account (SSG2:92-97) in fiveabhaïgason NÀmdev’s name lists NÀmdev’sinadvertent mistreatment of RÀjÀÃ’s brothers as the cause of RÀjÀÃ’ssorrow. Here is how the story goes. RÀjÀÃ’s brother come to visit theirsister. When NÀmdev appears, they get up to pay respects, but"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"VIDYUT AKLUJKAR114NÀmdev is so engrossed in his God, that he fails to acknowledge theirpresence, and this upsets RÀjÀÃ. Like a good wife, she somehowswallows that and asks NÀmdev to arrange for a feast for the brothers,but NÀmdev reminds her, that it is the tenth of the month, which isdesignated as a half day fast for all Vaiùõavas, and that the day after isthe eleventh, another day-long fast. The brothers had got up early inthe morning and had walked quite a distance to visit their sister. Theyare worried and cannot sleep due to hunger. After reminding her ofher religious duties, NÀmdev retires to the temple. With the prospectof spending that day and the next inharikathÀandbhajanon anempty stomach, and not being able to entertain her brothers at herhouse, RÀjÀÃis very sad at heart. She wonders, “Why did my fathergive me in marriage to such a man? No meals, no snacks, no jewels,no clothes. The only thing I am chosen to enjoy in this life is misery.” Now God sees that the beloved of hisbhaktais worried and comesin disguise to drive away her misery. He comes as a merchant, in theabsence of NÀmdev, and delivers a sack full of gold coins and leaves.NÀmdev comes and learns that a merchant called Ke×avarÀj has comeand delivered this sack full of wealth, and he recognises the deed ofGod for what it is. NÀmdev goes out, brings back some needybrahmins, and distributes the wealth brought home by God.Suspecting NÀmdev’s sweeping generosity, RÀjÀÃhides some coinsfrom him but when she recovers them, she finds them to charcoals.She then confesses her sin to NÀmdev, and as he glances at thecharcoals, they turn back to gold coins, and NÀmdev again gives themaway to the needy brahmins. This triple miracle is the occasion forRÀjÀÃ’s enlightenment and conversion tobhaktiin some accounts. In theabhaïgason the name of one of the four sons of NÀmdev,there is a similar account of the incident with GoõÀÃand RÀjÀÃ.However, there GoõÀÃis convinced of the greatness of the Sant by hischildhood exploits with the God, and the two stories of RÀjÀÃ’s plightare mixed there, so that it is the gold coins in the pot of the serpentshe cooks that NÀmdev takes out and distributes among the needybrahmins at which RÀjÀÃscolds him and curses her fate so as to makeGod appear before her in disguise once again offer her some wealth.This tale also culminates in God’s triple miracle and RÀjÀÃ’senlightenment. In MahÃpati’sBhakta-vijaya, chapter 18, anotheraccount appears of the conflict between RÀjÀÃ’s attempts at fighting"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"WOMEN IN THE MARATHI SANT TRADITION 115poverty and NÀmdev’s resistance. RÀjÀÃborrows a philosopher’sstone, aparisa, from the wife of a neighbour ParisÀBhÀgvat, who hasbeen granted the stone as a boon by RukminÃ, the consort of ViñhobÀ.RÀjÀÃhopes to put an end to her poverty by using the stone, butNÀmdev discovers her plans which he deems unsuitable to abhakta’swife, he takes the stone and throws it into the river. Both RÀjÀÃandParisÀ’s wife, KamaëjÀ, are heartbroken, and start to cry. ParisÀBhÀgvat, when he learns of this incident from his wife, demands thestone back. NÀmdev simply takes a handful of pebbles from the river-bed, and claims that all of them are philosopher’s stones. Thevillagers test this claim, find it to be true, which enlightens ParisÀBhÀgvat to accept NÀmdev’s greatness, and shun the worldly wealth.MahÃpati does not mention whether the wives were convinced or not. Even if we discount the account of these miracles leading to thewomen’s conversion as a standard motif found in any Sant’shagiography, we cannot miss the sincerity in GoõÀÃand RÀjÀÃ’s earlierappeals to NÀmdev and to God. Unlike the women in other Sant’slife-accounts (such as the two wives of GorÀthe potter, inBhakta-vijaya, ch. 17), these two are not just nameless women serving asbonds ofmÀyÀmaking the Sant’s lot difficult. Nor do they resemblethe typical wailing women of renouncer husband in North Indianfolktales such asrÀjÀBhartçhari, or king GopÃchand (Gold, 1992).They have no intention of either making the Sant give up his worshipcompletely, or joining him in his total disregard for the family. Wesee them taking their social roles of a mother and a wife veryseriously and wholeheartedly. Between the two of them, they haveused practically all the arguments to make the Sant assume his shareof the household responsibility. As coming from good, intelligent,god-worshipping, strong women, their own arguments are impeccableand hard to refute by reason alone. Therefore, the dispute between thedivine and the domestic remains unresolved at the rational and sociallevel. I think it significant that nothing short of a miracle convertsthem to the path of total abandonment in NÀmdev’s style ofbhakti.Even then, as we shall see in part two of this paper, they are seen asimpediments to the Sant’s progress in the self-sacrificing path ofbhakti. Both these women pale in comparison to TukÀrÀm’s second wifewho is portrayed by TukÀrÀm as a sharp-tongued nag. She a lot more"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"VIDYUT AKLUJKAR116to complain about. TukÀrÀm himself describes why he chose tobecome a renunciate. He was unhappy with his low caste, and hisprofession as a shop-keeper. His mind was not in his shop. He wastroubled by a pseudo-righteous Brahmin, SÀlomÀlo, who used toplagiarise TukÀrÀm’sabhaïgas, and instigate Brahmins against thelow-born TukÀrÀm. Due to SÀlomÀlo’s malice, in addition to somenatural disasters such as famine, TukÀrÀm suffered many a loss in hislife. The notebooks of hisabhaïgaswere thrown into the river by hisrivals. Moreover, he went bankrupt, lost his shop, and lost his parents,first wife, and his children in a famine. This loss turned himwholeheartedly towards God. He gave away whatever he had to theneedy, and went on singing and dancing in God’s name. Of course,the second wife was at home left to her own resources without thehusband’s support and naturally, she started to complain, curse, andfinally resorted to abuse and violence. TukÀrÀm gives a runningcommentary on her in eightabhaïgashas she talks (SSG 4:3766-3773). He also relates in elevenabhaïgashow he advised her tochange her perspective, put her burden on the God, stop worrying andlive in the total abandonment ofbhakti(SSG 4:3774-3784). We find aclear mention and a gloss to these elevenabhaïgasof TukÀrÀm’sinMahÃpati’sBhakta-vijaya(chapter 49: verses 57-116), written in1762, which indicates that the tradition of a conflict between TukÀrÀmand his wife was well-known as early as in MahÃpati’s times. Theearlier eightabhaïgasin TukÀrÀm’sgÀthÀare full of emotion andreal-life drama. It is as if a candid camera is recording theconfrontation scene as it happens. The wife is presented to us throughher accusations, curses, and her hysterics as related by her husband,who is at once the cause of her misery, the witness of her outburst, thereporter and the record-keeper of the incident. However, theabhaïgasare also like a three-way-mirror reflecting the scene from manyangles. In the speeches attributed by TukÀrÀm to his wife, we get avivid picture of the Sant himself from his wife’s angle, and come toknow of her trials. In the remarks at the end of these verses we hearTukÀrÀm the Sant respondent to his wife, the householder, andaggravating her misery by his calm and quiet demeanour. To myknowledge, theseabhaïgasare unparalleled in the entire Santtradition for their most life-like presentation of the tensions betweenthe domestic and the divine. Everyabhaïgabelow starts with the"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"WOMEN IN THE MARATHI SANT TRADITION 117woman’s speech, and end with a comment of TukÀrÀm. My partialtranslations retain this format.“‘How long can I pull on being a wife? How many more calamitiesmust I endure? Shall I offer my body to these children to tear intomorsels? They would be better off dead. My husband does not let mesave anything in this house, he robs me outright, I don’t even havedung to sweep my floors with.’TukÀsays, ‘the bitch does not think,she carries a burden on her shoulders and whines’” (SSG 4:3766).“‘Who knows? He must have been my mortal enemy of a past life,that is why he has become my husband in this life. How am I toendure this misery all the time? How many people an I to beg? Whatgood has the mother-fucker God ever done for anyone in this world?’TukÀsays, ‘the wife is breaking down with hysteric seizures. Shecries, she laughs, she sobs and rants on and on’” (SSG 4:3767).“‘The sack (of grains) has arrived (at our) home and still he won’tlet my children eat the grains. He has to fill other people’s bellies.Damn the rogue the robber and the sucker.’ ‘The madwoman isoutraged and drags me by my arms like a witch,’TukÀsays, ‘the bitchis bankrupt in her merit from the past’” (SSG 4;3768).“What will you eat now, my son? The husband is mad after thatGod. He claps his head and wears those garlands, and has given up hisbusiness altogether. He does not fill his own belly nor does he worryabout ours.òÀëin hand and mouth opened wide, he sings in thetemple of that God. What are we to do now? Leave home, go to theforest?’TukÀsays, ‘Have patience, nothing has happened yet’” (SSG4:3769).“He can’t work. Why would he? He gets to eat without lifting afinger. As soon as he gets up, he starts to clammer with theòÀë.Hedoesn’t let anyone sleep. From dawn to dusk, it ischini chini chini.Hemakes a racket all the time. He is a living corpse. It is as if he haspercolated all shame, and drunk it. He does not even bother glancing athis family. His widow is in pain here, she is throwing stones at themention of his very name.’TukÀsays, ‘Here, woman, I wrote it alldown’” (SSG 4:3771-3772). We witness here an outburst of a cornered woman whose situation issimilar to the women in NÀmdev’s house, but whose spirit and languageare quite different from theirs. The story of TukÀrÀm’s wife remainsessentially different from the cluster of stories about the women in"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"VIDYUT AKLUJKAR118NÀmdev’s house. Unlikely in the story of NÀmdev, no miracle takesplace here to convinceÂvalÃof her husband’s greatness. Unlike the twoin NÀmdev’s house TukÀrÀm’s wife has no direct dialogue with God.Later on, MahÃpati narrates in chapter 49 of hisBhakta-vijayaanincident in which she runs with a stone in her hand which she intends tohurl at the divine Feet of God at the Temple, where RukmiõÃlistens toher complaint against the Sant and grants her wealth, which, of course,TukÀrÀm does not allow her to enjoy. But other than that, in TukÀrÀm’sabhaïgas, and elsewhere too, she deals directly with her husband, andnot with the God. She comes across as a disenchanted, bitter, andessentially helpless woman, faced with an unsympathetic, unproviding,and adamant husband, who is obsessed by a God that she does notunderstand or care for. All we have is this record of her passionatebreakdown reported candidly by TukÀrÀm. Unlike NÀmdev’s motherand wife, we do not get anyabhaïgason her name of praises to God.Even MahÃpati portrays her as a cantankerous wife who does notunderstand the magnanimity of her Sant husband, and does not flinch incursing, foulmouthing, and once even hitting TukÀrÀm with asugarcane. Up to MahÃpati’s times we do not even get to know hername. He too, following TukÀrÀm, mentions her only asstrÃ,orawoman. All of this coupled with the fact that theseabhaïgasof theconflict between the Sant and his woman are found in all the oldestmanuscripts from Dehu, Paõóharpur, and Talegao traditions, and havebeen preserved in the critical edition of P.M. Lad, provides us withstrong reasons to believe in the authenticity of the incident. TukÀrÀmlater tries to persuade his wife of the futility of her short-sightedexpectations, and ties to instruct her in his path. We do not knowwhether she changed her outlook or not. There is no indication in thegÀthÀof TukÀrÀm that she did. Even if she did, it was probably becauseshe had no other choice, short of giving up the ghost. Her outrage andher desperation at the total lack of sympathy from her husband are whathaunt us in her most life-like description at the hands of her husband. Of course, elsewhere we hear more unkind works about her short-tempered nature from her husband, the Sant. TukÀrÀm thanks God manytimes for giving him all the miseries in life, since like KuntÃ,hebelieves, that the sorrows and miseries of this world constantly remindhim of God, and anchor him firmly in Bhakti (cf.vipadaþ santu naþ×a×vat tatra tatra jagadguro / bhavato dar×anam yatsyÀd apunarbhava-"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"WOMEN IN THE MARATHI SANT TRADITION 119dar×anam //KuntÃ’s speech in theBhÀgavata PurÀõa1:8-25). His wifegets an honourable mention among his miseries. “God, it’s good thatYou made me a peasant. Or else the false pride would have killed me”(SSG 4:63). “God, it’s a good thing that I went bankrupt in this famine.That is what nauseated me towards this world, and reminded me ofYou. I’m glad that my wife is a shrill nag, and that she embarrasses mein public. I’m glad that I’m humiliated in this world. It’s a good thingthat I lost all my wealth, all cattle, and all shame. That is what made mecome to you for help”(SSG 4:3763). We know, that in the eyes ofTukÀrÀm, his wife is useful to him only as a painful reminder of worldlymisery. RÀjÀÃ, GoõÀÃ, andÂvalÃ. Typical examples of disempowered women.These women are seen as trapped in a society which assigns them onlythe role of nurturing their family, but offers no protection against ahusband who refuses to share the load. When they try to assume theirassigned traditional roles, they are accused of being obstacles in the pathof worship by theirbhaktahusbands. A woman’s natural concern forher husband, her children, and her family is criticised and ridiculed byher God-centered husband. She is mostly ignored, and sometimesrebuked and belittled by her Sant husband who preaches equality for allbeings. Is the condition any different when a woman abandons traditionand wants to become andbhaktaherself? Hardly. If she herself wants tofollow the path ofbhakti, but her husband is a worldling, then she isopposed by the husband, scorned by the family as a loose woman, andoften abandoned or abused by society. The predicament of a femaleSant has been mentioned several times so far, so I will not belabour it.Suffice it to look at only two examples of women Sants, JanÀbÀÃandBahiõÀbÀÃ, separated from each other by more than three centuries.They differ in every respect: their families, their status, their attitudetowards God and towards the society in which they live, and theirpoetry. The only thing they have in common is their maltreatment bysociety. MahÃpati devotes a chapter of hisBhakta-vijayato JanÀbÀÃwhereas he devotes five—six full chapters and portions of a fewmore—to NÀmdev’s stories. MahÃpati has no story to tell of BahiõÀbÀÃwho was the closest to him in time, and only mentions BahiõÀbÀÃinpassing in the summary verses of the epilogue of hisBhakta-vijaya. Sant JanÀbÀÃwas an orphan maidservant living in NÀmdev’s house.She was a sensitive and imaginative poet in her own right, and so she"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"VIDYUT AKLUJKAR120managed to surpass the habitual neglect coupled with hard physicallabour that was her lot as an orphan servant in her master’s family. Thefact that JanÀbÀÃoften speaks of herself as “Namadev’s JanÀbÀÃ”andmentions NÀmdev’s family, whereas in NÀmdev’s verses we find not asingle mention of JanÀbÀÃ, may indicate her lowly position in hermaster’s family. Very modestly, she gives credit of her good fortune toher association with her master, Sant NÀmdev. She says, “Along withthe bride, the guests also get to eat delicacies at the wedding. Similarly,since JanÀbÀÃis a servant of NÀmyÀ, she too has been able to join withViñhobÀ”(SSG 2: JanÀbÀÃ31). She does record, however, herharassment at the hands of the priestly establishment of the temple. Thereason for this harassment is precisely JanÀbÀÃ’s choice of the path ofbhakti. As a person immersed in passionate worship of ViñhobÀ, she hasovercome her place and conveyed through her poems her exalted statusas the beloved friend of God. For example, at one place she says,“‘My mother and my father are both dead, now You have to takecare of me, Viññhala! Hari, I have no one, and my head is itching.’Viññhala said to His consort RukmiõÃ, ‘Poor JanÃof mine, she has noone,’and so He grabbed some oil and a comb in hand, and He combedmy hair, and braided it. When He tied a knot at the end of my braid, JanÃsaid to Him, ‘Now how about a back-rub?’JanÃsaid, ‘O GopÀla, Youwill celebrate with a weakling like me’” (SSG 2: JanÀbÀÃ133). At other places, she relates how God, her buddy, alleviates all hertakes by giving her a hand (SSG 2: JanÀbÀÃ83, 84, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90,etc.). When she has a washload to finish on an empty stomach, Godcomes running behind her and uses all four of his hands to finish hertask (SSG 2: JanÀbÀÃ129, 135). When she goes to the woods to collectdung, God goes with her and not only collects dung, but helps her makepatties and ties them in a bundle, and lifts it to his head while JanÃhasonly to walk behind (SSG 2: JanÀbÀÃ130). When she has mountains ofgrains to grind at a grindstone, God sits opposite from her and makeslight work of her formidable task (SSG 2: JanÀbÀÃ125, 126, 128, 135).JanÀbÀÃdoes not limit herself to these descriptions of God as herassociate, her helper, and her buddy. Her devotion to God sums up allher emotions, all her passions, and gets a forceful expression such as inthe following verse: “I eat God, I drink God, I sleep on God, I give God,I take God, I deal with God. Here God, there God, there is no place"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"WOMEN IN THE MARATHI SANT TRADITION 121empty of God.”JanÃsays, “ViññÀbÀÃhas filled everything inside and out,and has remained besides”(SSG 2: JanÀbÀÃ198). All such descriptions of her mystic experiences are interpreted asboasts by the temple priests and they find a way to humiliate her. Theytry to accuse her of stealing the ornaments of the God’s idol, convict herand prepare to impale her at a stake (SSG 2: JanÀbÀÃ154; MahÃpati’sBhakta-vijaya, chapter 21). She wonders whether God is dead, but issaved from her fate by divine intervention as thesÅlor the stake turns towater. Finally she flips, and in defiance of the society which does not allowher to swim against the current, she proudly proclaims her liberatedways as tantamount to those of a prostitute (SSG 2: JanÀbÀÃ232).“Instead of covering my head with modesty, the end of mysÀrÃhasfallen off my shoulders. I am preparing to enter the market as I am.Who can obstruct me now?”JanÃsays, “God, I have become a whore, Ihave opened a shop in this marketplace and PaõóharÃ. You can pour oilon my wrist (and I will howl Your name). I have come to You housenow.” BahiõÀbÀÃ(1628-1700) is another example of a woman who wantedto embrace the path ofbhaktiand suffered for it. We have more detailsavailable to us of her life, thanks to her own feat of recording them inverse. Although JanÀbÀÃis more celebrated in the Sant tradition thanBahiõÀbÀÃ, specific dates cannot be ascribed to JanÀbÀÃ, all we know isthat she is said to be a contemporary of Sant NÀmdev. MahÃpati devotesa chapter of hisBhakta-vijayato JanÀbÀÃwhereas he devotes six fullchapters and portions of a few more to NÀmdev’s stories, and a similarnumber to sing TukÀrÀm’s glories. But MahÃpati has no story to tell ofBahiõÀbÀÃwho was the closest to him in time and only mentionsBahiõÀbÀÃin passing in the summary verses of the epilogue of hisBhakta-vijaya. BahiõÀbÀÃwas perhaps the first woman Sant who hasnarrated her own life in detail in 78abhaïgas, and has given us theexact date of her birth, etc. She was a child bride of 3 years, married offto a thirty year old brahmin widower. She was subjected to demands ofmarried life from the age of eleven years onwards, but her heart was notin it. Sant TukÀrÀm’s appearance in her dream guided her to the path ofbhaktiand to chanting the name of ViñhobÀ. Of course, her husbandtried to argue her out of it, by saying that “we are brahmins who chantthe Vedas all the time, why do you need this lower caste TukÀrÀmto"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"VIDYUT AKLUJKAR122come in your dream and instruct you?”(BahiõÀbÀÃGÀthÀ32).BahiõÀbÀÃtried to reconcile to the demands of her husband and findpleasure in being a dutiful housewife, but succeeded in neither drainingherself of her powerful emotion ofbhaktinor in pleasing her hard-to-please, hot-tempered husband. So she tried to engage in her pursuits ofbhakti, while remaining a dutiful wife to her husband. Soon her gamebegan to spread and the husband began to be upset. At one point inBahiõÀbÀÃ’sabhaïgas, we find that she reads accurately the thoughts ofher husband who was in all likelihood just jealous of the attention andthe fame she was getting. “They will now all some and bow at her feet,and she will treat me as a straw. All these people come to consult withher, and here I am a brahmin tuned a fool. They all quote her name asthe GosÀvÃõ, and no one remembers me while she is around”(BahiõÀbÀÃGÀthÀ33). He is said to have abused, beaten, and confinedher to their cattle-shed. When neither words nor physical abuse won herback, he prepared to leave her, but suffered a sensation of burning limbsfor a whole month, and finally he was convinced of her sincerity in herchosen path. Even after this, until she died at the age of 72, BahiõÀbÀÃlived a splitlife, torn between the cruel demands placed on her woman’s body byher mismatched marriage, and her own urge towards renunciation andbhakti. Her mental torment find a powerful expression as follows: “TheVedas call out, the PurÀõas roar: ‘There is no merit in company of awoman.’I was born with a woman’s body. So how do I arrange for abetter life, forparamÀrtha? Idiocy, possessiveness, temptation, andillusion, all these make a woman’s company disastrous.”BahiõÃsays,“thus is a woman’s body deemed treacherous. How on earth can I aspirefor a better goal?”(BahiõÀbÀÃGÀthÀ63). BahiõÀbÀÃis all the moretormented since she does not want to follow a path ofbhaktiin place ofher social duties. She wants to have her cake and eat it too. She choosesnot to abandon her husband, nor her family as many women Santsbefore her were forced to do. She calls out to God for help in thisenterprise, and says, “Hari, You alone are my friend, my brother. Youare PÀõóhuraïga, the resort of the weak. Arrange it so I can worshipYou and fulfil my duty as a good wife”(BahiõÀbÀÃGÀthÀ68). But evenwith God’s help, it is not easy, and we find her recording her trials as anaspiring soul trapped in a woman’s body. “What sins have I committedin my past lives that I was abandoned by the Best Man, by God? I"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"WOMEN IN THE MARATHI SANT TRADITION 123acquired birth as a human being, but with this female body. My untoldsins must have ripened. I am not entitled to listen to the meaning of theVedas, and the brahmins have hidden thegÀyatrÃmantraas well. I maynot utter the sound ofpraõava. I may not listen to the utterance of abÃjamantra. I may not talk with another man, since my husband is hot-tempered as JamadagnÃincarnate.”BahiõÃsays, “my life is torture, butGod takes no pity over me”(BahiõÀbÀÃGÀthÀ64). Finally shereconciles to her lot as a woman by embracing the doctrine of KarmaandprÀrabdha. She says, “Many miseries have I endured, my friend, Ihave been humiliated to the core. This misery is my lot, I had started itearlier, this is how I tried to console my mind. Even BrahmÀand theothers could not escape suffering their sorrows, so the rest are nobodiescompared to them.”BahiõÃsays, “such is the fate of my body, begun byme, so what can God do about it?”(BahiõÀbÀÃGÀthÀ70). We see in the above examples that a woman in the Marathi Santtradition is at fault no matter which way she turns. Whether she defiesthe tradition or follow it faithfully, a woman is not free of blame. Whyis this so? The answer lies is society’s denial of free-will to a woman. Awoman, married or unmarried, is to follow only the path her mentordictates. If she has no husband, and is an orphan like JanÀbÀÃ, she maytake tobhaktiinspired by her master, but even her choice is not entirelyfree of obstacles. Not only does the society accuse her and abuse her,but she senses partiality even in God’s graces. She feels that God hasaccepted RÀjÀÃand GoõÀÃquite wholeheartedly, but He is not sogenerous with herself. She accuses God, “RÀjÀÃand GoõÀÃget to stayalways at Your feet, but You treat me as a lowly person and thereforekeep me only at the door”(SSG 2: JanÀbÀÃ70). Perhaps it is in responseto this complaint of JanÀbÀÃ’s that MahÃpati’sBhakta-vijaya21 narratesa story in which God comes to her hut in secret and compensates for hislack of consideration that she accuses him of. Nevertheless, an orphanlike JanÀbÀÃsomehow finds solace in God’sbhaktiand gets over herhandicap of being born a woman. We find her advocating, “One shouldnot get despondent of this birth as a woman, the Sants have showed away out. I am a servant branded as one of the house of the Sants, soViñhobÀhas granted me an aspect of His love”(SSG 2: JanÀbÀÃ81). Butif married, a woman has no other choice than that of following herhusband. She is to follow only the path that he chooses for her. If he is aSant, then she is not free to be a traditional housewife, as we saw in the"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"VIDYUT AKLUJKAR124cases of RÀjÀÃandÂvalÃ, and if he is a traditional husband, and shechooses to be a Sant, as BahiõÀbÀÃdid, then heaven help her.Part twoWhen we turn from the portraits of these individual women to thesketches and caricatures of women in the Sants’poems, a similarfragmented pattern emerges. In general, the Sants praise woman in theform of the mother, and revile her in the form of a temptress. NÀmdevoffer a very simplistic bilateral division of all women based on thevirtue or vice of their physical beauty. He says,“The beautiful woman, the pretty woman, the desirable womanshould be recognised as the sinner. When one sees her, the desire to bewith her is strong, and that destroys the merit of chanting of thebhakta.NÀmÀsays, one should not glance at her face, since such a bitch is asinner, and she destroys a man as well.”“The ugly woman, of inferior body, is a woman to be congratulatedas the mother. No one ever can be attracted to her, and thus she is nothreat to one’s worship. Such a matron is in fact kind, and beneficial to aman, as she does not destroy hisbhajan.NÀmÀsays, one should look ather face as a mother, and should bow at her feet”(SSG 2:1943, 1944). Even though we understand that it is his urge to worship withoutdistractions which prompts him to categorise women into such asweeping division, it is difficult to accept his convoluted reasoningwhich transfers the blame for a wavering mind of the weak aspirant tothe beauty of the woman he beholds. In the manner of reasoning, thephysical attributes of ugliness or beauty are somehow transformed intomoral attributes of virtue and vice, or in even stronger terms, merit andsin. This fateful division of women based on the effect of their existenceon men permeates through the psyche of the whole society, which thenfinds it easy to blame a woman for all the evils in the minds of men. The temptress/nurturer dichotomy prevails throughout the Santliterature, with many variations on the theme. Although NÀmdev, thechild-Sant, brands all beautiful women as sinners and therefore deemsthem disastrous to the worship of abhakta, TukÀrÀm shows a matureSant’s response to the tempting beauty of women. Even the temptresscan sometimes be transformed into a mother, and then she ceases to be atemptress. ThegÀthÀof Sant TukÀrÀm records the story of a woman"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"WOMEN IN THE MARATHI SANT TRADITION 125who approaches TukÀrÀm in order to seduce him. TukÀrÀm addressesher as “mother”and thus distances her effectively. This is what he saysto her: “Any other woman is like the Goddess RakhumÀÃto me. This isthe eternal rule I follow. Go away, dear mother, do not exert yourself;we, the servants of Viùõu are not of that type. I cannot bear to see yourfall. Please don’t say the wicked words.”TukÀsays, “If you want amate, is there a lack of other men?”The formula practised by the Santsat all times and prescribed to those who want to follow the path ofbhaktiis: “Treat women belonging to others as your mothers”(SSG2:1941, 4:3784-3786). When is a woman regarded as a temptress? She does not have to be“the other woman”or a prostitute for that; even a dutiful housewife, or aconcerned mother can be seen as a temptress by a Sant, because, as wesay in the life-story of NÀmdev, insofar as she cares for the Sant, andties him with the worldly love, she proceeds to be an impediment in hispath of unconditional worship. Here we notice the duality in the Sants’treatment of women. Although NÀmdev worships the God in the formof the mother, and in general upholds the mother’s love as the ultimateselfless love, he deserts his own mother in favour of God. Any womancan be regarded as a temptress and no woman is as motherly as the God.TukÀrÀm praises the selfless love of a mother (SSG 4:2180), and seesboth the Sants and the God as mothers (SSG 4:1994, 2058, 2180-2181,2183-2185, 2197-2198). In fact, the Sants are sometimes said to bebetter than the mundane mother, since the mother brings you into thisworld, whereas the Sants show you a way to be rid of this world. Whenparents praise a child, they have a vested interest in him. God is alwaysbetter than parents, since God’s love for a devotee has no stringsattached (mÀyÀbÀpe§ sÀ§bhÀëitÃ/ lobhÀkÀraõe§ pÀëitÃ/ taisÀnavhedevarÀva / yÀcÀkçpÀëÅsvabhÀva //SSG 4:3007). Further subdivisions are introduced to the above two-fold division.When the Sants consider woman in the form of a wife, they see her roletypified either as a devoted wife, apativratÀ, or a deceitful wife,sindaëÃ,orvyabicÀriõÃ. It is no surprise to find the Sants sympathetic to thedevoted wife. On the whole, a deceitful woman, avyabicÀriõÃiscensured and cursed to an after-life in hell (SSG 4:2336). She is said todestroy due to her misconduct both her father’s family and the one intowhich she is married (SSG 4:2338). The Sants have further used thesetwo types of women as analogies for themselves and for the"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"VIDYUT AKLUJKAR126householders. At one point, NÀmdev has effectively used thevyabhicÀrÃnÀrÃas a prescriptive model for the householders. He says, if you areengaged in mundane affairs, you still must concentrate on the Lord justas an adulteress behaves in her own household, all the while keeping theother man in her mind (SSG 2:1848). As steadfastbhaktasof God, theSants regard themselves aspativratÀs, or faithful women. When somedeceitful householders dislike TukÀrÀm for his outspokenness, heremarks, “When an adulteress hears praise for a faithful woman, she geta headache. Our comments on the world are spontaneous. We do nottake permission of other to say what we do”(SSG 4:2353). Here one curious point need notice. When the Sants preach thehouseholders general norms of morality, they unequivocally curse awomen who cheats on her husband. However, the prostitute (gaõikÀorkuõñaõÃ) is given a differential treatment in real life as well as in theliterature of the Sants. Within the realm ofbhakti, the Sants weresupportive of all outcastes, and anybody, however low his status in thesociety was welcome in their fold as long as he or she chose to embracethe path of truebhakti. Consistent with this spirit, Sant KÀnhopÀtrÀ,aprostitute who lived near Mangaëveóhe, is included in the list of MarathiSants without hesitation (MahÃpati’sBhakta-vijayaallots her an entirechapter, 39). Perhaps, because the Sants recognise the helplessness of aprostitute in the male-dominated societal order, or perhaps, because theywere using the inherited stock of traditional Vaiùõava stories, they citethe prostitute as an example of the real downtrodden and deservingpersons that are saved by the merciful God (SSG 2:1218, 1220, 1228,1316, 1317, 1323, etc.; SSG 4:306, 1812, 1813, 1826, 1871, etc.). It is no wonder that the Sants praise the devoted wife as the paradigmof virtue, and often use her as an analogy for thebhakta’sconcentrationof mind on the Almighty Lord (SSG 3:415;pativrate jaisÀbhratÀrapramÀõaÀmhÀ§nÀrÀyaõa tai×ÀparÃ//SSG 3:416). However, even awife who does not hanker after another man may prove to bedetrimental to her husband by her excessive demands on him. TukÀrÀmpresents many pictures of such women and warns people against them(SSG 4:2327-2332). A wilful woman who makes her husband dance toher tune is despised by the Sants. She is caricatured as the worst kind oftemptress. Her fault seems to lie in the fact that she not only severs aman from his own family, but she also makes him worship her ratherthan the God, and thus deprives him of a chance to be enlightened."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"WOMEN IN THE MARATHI SANT TRADITION 127Correspondingly, the man who is under the thumb of his woman isridiculed over and over again (SSG 4:2327, 2328). He is like an insipiddog who eats without discretion, like a monkey on the rope of a street-player, he is a jackass while he lives and he goes to hell after he dies.These pictures are all quite consistent with the overall norm of thesociety which denies free-will to women and considers a man as theprime candidate for enlightenment. Compared to NÀmdev, who places the blame of a wavering aspirantsquarely on the shoulders of women, TukÀrÀm is usually fair to bothsexes within the constraints of his society, and hisbhakti. Whether it isa man or a woman, if they worship God, then they are like God to him(ho ka§ nara athavÀnÀrÀ/jyÀñcÀÀvaóatÀharÃ// te maja viñhobÀsamÀna /SSG 4:2129). He ridicules both men and women who aredeluded bymÀyÀ, and are misbehaving (SSG 4:2343, 2344). Somehow,his pictures of such misguided women rather than those of such men aremore vivid and full of humorous details, and hence are quoted andremembered by generations after him. Here is, for instance, a well-known sketch of a woman about to go to Paõóharpur on a pilgrimage.This has become so famous in Maharashtra, that one of its lines, i.e.avÀnighÀlÃpaõóharapurÀ, is used as a proverb in Marathi to describe anyperson who cannot make up his mind about what is good for him. I offera full translation of theabhaïga.“‘Listen, daughter-in-law, don’t waste milk, or curds.’ÂvÀstarted togo to Paõóharpur, but she turned back from the town’s boundary, andcame home again. ‘Daughter, pay attention to what I say. Look after thechipped half of the grinding stone. Thekalavaóu(a drinking pot) that Ialways use; don’t break it in my absence. The curd is set solid, don’tbreak it without me. This mortar, this pestle, this grinding stone, this iswhere my mind hovers. When the beggars come the door, tell them thatI am gone to Paõóharpur. Eat in moderation, don’t waste in excess.’Thedaughter-in-law said, ‘Very well, you proceed to your pilgrimage andbe happy. Mother, you look after your own merit, and leave all suchdesires behind.’As she heard this speech of her daughter-in-law, themother-in-law was doubtful. She thought, ‘The witch is putting on anact. She wants me to vanish. Why should I go on a pilgrimage? Whatwill I see there? Children, grandchildren, the home and the yard: this iswhere lies my Paõóharpur.’TukÀsays, ‘Thus are the people engulfed inMÀyÀ’” (SSG 4:2343)."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"VIDYUT AKLUJKAR128 TukÀrÀm was a great social commentator. He is extremely critical ofanyone who sells his daughters, his cows, or hiskathÀ, which is God’spraise in the form of a story (SSG 4:2316). The nouns he uses for allthese,kanyÀ,go, andkathÀ, are feminine in Marathi. He does notcondone a man with two wives, although the practice was there is hissociety, and many Sants such as TukÀrÀm himself and GorÀKuübhÀrare said to have had two wives (SSG 4:2333). This discrepancy inpreaching and practice may not be an indication of hypocrisy on the partof TukÀrÀm, as it may seem superficially, but more a criticism of a evilin the society to which he himself had fallen victim at the wishes of hiselders. All kinds of mismatched couples are described by TukÀrÀm withequal criticism. Just as he notices the helplessness of a man whose wifeis infertile, he takes about the plight of a woman who is married to animpotent man (SSG 4:2782). He has no sympathy, however, for theinfertile woman who wraps rags around her belly and pretends to bepregnant. That is hypocrisy, pure and simple, according to him.TukÀrÀm depicts the miseries of a man sandwiched between two wives(SSG 4:2333), and he shows awareness of women’s miseries resultingout of cruel marriage practices prevalent in his society. Since the girlswere married off by their elders, sometimes even before they were born,and other times to over-ripe husbands twice their age, women weresubjected to mismatches of all types. Here are two such sorry friends asseen by TukÀrÀm.“Two friends. One has a boyish husband, the other is married to awidower. It is the perpetual take of this world. ‘My husband is so you,he constantly runs away to play with the kids. All evening long hespends in playing, and stays outside the house while I wait for him onthe bed. I don’t have enough merit accumulated in my past lives. Howcan I describe my sorrow?’‘Friend, you want to listen to my misery? The old man coughs all thetime. If I take the initiative and go near him, he won’t let me touch him,he is too tired.’TukÀsays, ‘women, this is how your karma rewardsyou. Why do you blame the God?’” (SSG 4:4405). Of course, since TukÀrÀm concludes that the women havethemselves to blame for their misfortune in this life, he does not feel theneed to challenge the society on their behalf. His answer to all suchmiseries of this life would be to discard the passion which ties one tothis miserable world and immerse the mind inbhaktiof God"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"WOMEN IN THE MARATHI SANT TRADITION 129(prapañcÀcÀchandañÀkÅniyÀ§ govÀ/ dharÀve§ ke×avÀhçdayÀñta //SSG 4:2349). That is what he did when he was troubled with themiseries of this world. But we saw earlier how that choice was notopen to all married women unless their husbands also becomebhaktaswith them and abandoned everything in this world. Therefore, allthese miserable women that we witness in the Sants’poems and intheir lives remain rooted in their respective miseries.ConclusionThe condition of women in the Marathi Sant tradition, can be summedup in the words of BahiõÀbÀÃ. As a disciple of Sant TukÀrÀm, she toobelieved that her lot in this life as a woman was a result of her sins inher past lives, herprÀrabdha, and that she had to endure all her trialspatiently. However, as his true disciple, she also wanted to follow thepath ofbhaktias he did. As we saw above, that was not easy.TukÀrÀm’s advice to his own wife was to follow the path ofbhaktibecame celebrated in the tradition, and was quoted by other lifeMahÃpati as exemplary, whereas BahiõÀbÀÃcould not advise her ownhusband and be accepted wholeheartedly let alone be praised by himor others in her lifetime and, as a result, had to endure her splitpersonality all her life. She has crystallised her hard-earned life-longwisdom in the following two lines: “A woman’s body is a bodycontrolled by someone else. Therefore, the path of renunciation is notopen to her”(striyece×arÃra parÀdhÃna deha / ne cÀleÅpÀva viraktÃcÀ// BahiõÀbÀÃGÀthÀ60). I submit that as we look at the various livesof individual and typified women, married, unmarried, widowed, ororphaned, in the long Sant tradition, the only truth that emerges is that“Awoman’s body was a body controlled by someone else, andtherefore, no path was open to her without the permission of theother.”BIBLIOGRAPHYBahiõÀbÀÃ.BahiõÀbÀÃGÀthÀ.Pune: Chitrashala Prakashan, second edition,1956.BhÀgavata PurÀõa.

YOUNGThe Advaita-vedÀnta view that women and members of the lowest castecalled×Ådras cannot attain liberation (mokùa) is usually attributed to thegreat eighth-century philosopherØaïkara himself.1It is based on theargument that the path of knowledge (jñÀna-yoga) involves bothknowledge of the Vedas and renunciation. Because women and×Ådraswere without knowledge of the Vedas (avaidika) in the sense that theyeither did not have, or were prohibited from having it, and were not ableto take renunciation (sannyÀsa)on account of the injunction to serveand follow their masters, they could not pursue the path of knowledgeand attain liberation. A close reading ofØaïkara’s works suggests,however, that he did not hold this position himself; rather, later thinkersascribed it to him. The task at hand, then, is to examineØaïkara’s writings—specifically,passages in theBhagavad-gÃtÀ(3:20: 9:29-34; 18:44-55and 18:66);BçhadÀraõyaka-upaniùad(3:5:1; 4:5:15; 2:4:1-14;4:2:1-4; 6:4:17);Muõóaka-upaniùad(1:2:12); andVedÀnta-sÅtras(=Brahma-sÅtras) (1:1:2; 1:1:4; 1:3:34-38; 3:4:26-27; 3:4:36-40; and4:4:22)with thefollowing questions in mind.

Are thereexamples of women and×Ådras attaining salvation in the scriptures?

Can women and×Ådrasattain salvation in this life or mustthey await rebirth as brahmin (brÀhmaõa)or twice-born (dvija) men?

The final section of this analysis will suggest who introduced theidea thatØaïkara was against the liberation of women and×Ådras. Itwill also place the discussion in the larger context of historicalvicissitudes: a new brahmanical universalism to compete with theheterodox religions and to come to terms with social change but also areinforcement of brahmanical exclusivity to stem the tide of changeand regroup under the banner of the duties of caste and stages of life(varõa-À×rama-dharma).Øaïkara’s hermeneutical skill can be seen inhis reconciliation of these seemingly contradictory goals.Text, Context, and InterpretationIs salvation promised to everyone? Perhaps the strongest statement ofuniversal salvation is found inGÃtÀ9:29-34.I am the same to all beings; there is no one who is hateful or dear toMe.

God bestows hisgrace on his devotees who are near to him like fire gives warmth tothose nearby.Øaïkara draws a fundamental distinction, therefore,between those who are devotees and those who are not. It is implied thatGod is the same to all, because he is available to all. In this sense he is"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"SALVATION OF WOMEN AND øæDRAS133impartial. But it is up to people to avail themselves of God’s grace byworshipping him. In short, there is the promise of universal salvationbut the initiative belongs to the individual. In the next verse (9:30) we are told that even if one of very evilconduct (sudurÀcÀra) but worships God resorting to none else, such aone is to be deemed righteous (sÀdhu) for such a one indeed is rightlyresolved (samyak-vyavasita).Øaïkara glossessudurÀcÀraetc. as “byabandoning evil ways in his external life and by right resolution.”GÃtÀ9:31 states in no uncertain terms that:Quickly (kùipram) he/she becomes righteous (dharmÀtman) and attainseternal peace (×a×vac-chÀnti).

Thus, “Listen to the supreme meaning ... Proclaim ...that my devotee does not perish.”In the next verse (9:32), we learn thesupreme meaning: that women and×Ådras(along with the third twice-born caste, thevai×yas) are included in this promise of universalsalvation that is to be proclaimed everywhere.Indeed, O PÀrtha, after resorting to Me, even those who [are called]born of evil womb (pÀpa-yonayaþ) - women,vai×yasas well as×Ådras- they attain the supreme goal (yÀnti parÀü gatim).mÀühipÀrtha vyapÀ×ritya ye ‘pi syuþ pÀpayonayaþ |striyo vai×yÀs tathÀ×ÅdrÀste ‘pi yÀnti parÀü gatim || (9:32) Øaïkara’s commentary is worth quoting in full:mÀü hi yasmÀtpÀrtha vyapÀ×ritya mÀmÀ×rayatvena gçhÃtvÀye ‘pisyuþ bhaveyuþ pÀpayonayaþ pÀpÀyoniþ yeùÀütepÀpayonayaþpÀpajanmÀnaþ | ke te itiÀha-striyaþ vai×yÀþ tathÀ×ÅdrÀþte ‘pi yÀntigacchanti parÀü prakçùñÀü gatim ||Øaïkara keeps to the literal meaning of the verse except when hecomments onpÀpa-yonayaþ(those of evil womb).

But there are more troublesome versesthat must be discussed. The next obvious question is whether there are any explicitprohibitions against women and×Ådras takingsannyÀsaand attainingsalvation. There is considerable discussion over the eligibility of×Ådras forsannyÀsa. As noted, both×Ådras and women are consideredmembers of the same category (those who are without knowledge ofthe Vedas) by this time. I will assume that what is said of×Ådrasapplies to women (and vice versa) unless there is specific evidence tothe contrary. This relates to the issue of whether knowledge of theVedas is prerequisite for takingsannyÀsa. A key text on this topic isØaïkara’s commentary onVedÀnta-sÅtra1:3:34-38. He begins by pointing out that this section was written toremove confusion over whether only twice-born men (dvijas) haveexclusive access to liberation or whether×Ådras (and presumablywomen) too can claim knowledge of Brahman (VedÀnta-sÅtra1:3:34).He then offers various arguments made by the opponent (pÅrva-pakùin)as to why×Ådras have knowledge of Brahman (brahma-vidyÀ). Theopponent argues, for instance, that×Ådras are eligible because (1) theydesire that knowledge; (2) they are capable of having it; (3) there areno specific scriptural prohibitions against them having it analogous tothe prohibition that a×Ådrais unfit for sacrificing (TaittirÃya-saühitÀ7: 1.1.6); (4) their dis-qualification from having sacred fires andperforming sacrificial works does not invalidate their qualification forknowledge, because knowledge can be apprehended by other means;(5) there is the example of JÀna×ruti PautrÀyaõa who wished to learmfrom a×Ådra(according toChÀndogya-upaniùad4: 2-3), whichimplies that the×Ådraknows Brahman; and (6)smçtimentions Vidura"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"SALVATION OF WOMEN AND øæDRAS135and others born of×Ådramothers as possessing supreme knowledge.In short, the opponent’s view is that×Ådras have a claim to knowledgeof Brahman (brahma-vidyÀ). I shall not take up all ofØaïkara’s refutations in detail here. The cruxof the matter in his commentary onVedÀnta-sÅtra1:3:34-38 is that×Ådras cannot claim knowledge of Brahman on account of their notstudying the Vedas. Mere desire or mundane capability does not suffice,because spiritual capability is required and this involves eligibility to beinitiated, to study the Vedas, and to perform sacrifices. Moreover, thereference inChÀndogya-upaniùad4:2:3 to the fact that JÀna×ruti hasaccess tosaüvarga-vidyÀ, which is part of the knowledge of Brahman,arguesØaïkara, is not to be taken literally or viewed as indicating that×Ådras have access to other forms of knowledge. It occurs in a passageof mere praise (artha-vÀda). Then, too, the reference to×ÅdrainChÀndogya-upaniùad4:1:3 can be taken in the etymological sense ofgrief (suk)(VedÀnta-sÅtra1:3:34). In his commentary onVedÀnta-sÅtra1:3:35,Øaïkara argues that JÀna×ruti is not a×Ådrabut akùatriya.In1:3:36 he says that Manu and others say that×Ådras are not fit forinitiation into study of the Vedas (upanayana), and in 1:3:37 thatGautama initiated JÀbÀla only when he ascertained that he was not a×Ådra. Finally,sÅtra1:3:38 declares thatsmçtiprohibits×Ådras fromhearing and studying the Vedas and performing Vedic rituals. In theopening line of his commentary on 1:3:38,Øaïkara repeats the literalmeaning of thesÅtra, supplying the missing words. Because knowledge of Brahman is usually understood as leading tosalvation and becauseØaïkara in his commentary onGÃtÀ9:29-34, aswe have seen, has argued that×Ådras attain the supreme goal, then itappears contradictory that he assigns here this position to hisopponent and proceeds to argue vehemently against it. Just what isgoing on? The clue is provided in his commentary onVedÀnta-sÅtra1.3.38.Just asØaïkara completes his rebuttal and seems to demolish anypossibility whatsoever that×Ådras can attain knowledge of Brahman,he adds a modifying addendum in 1.3.38. He makes two points. First,he argues that because in former lives×Ådrassuch as Vidura andDharmavyÀdha have acquired good karma from their deeds, thefruition of these impressions (saüskÀras) will automatically result inknowledge (sometimes in a subsequent life). Second, all the four"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"KATHERINE K.

The final point of the opponent, we recall, was thatsmçtispeaks ofVidura and others such as DharmavyÀdha who were born from×Ådramothers as having knowledge of Brahman. Now, we know thatØaïkara agrees that×Ådras such as Vidura possess eminent knowledgeand have a claim to the knowledge of Brahman but that knowledge isnot attained through knowledge of the Vedas. In short, there must beother ways of obtaining knowledge of Brahman and thereforesalvation than through the Vedas.Øaïkara gives us a clue to thesealternatives by mentioning deeds in former lives andsmçti(non-Vedicscripture). According to Radhakrishnan, this point is also made inØaïkara’s commentary onVedÀnta-sÅtra1:1:3 “(×ÀstrayonitvÀt: ‘fromits being the source of Scripture’or ‘from Scripture being the source(of its knowledge)’. ...ØÀstrafor S [Øaïkara] includes the four Vedas,the epics, thepurÀõasand other branches of learning,vidyÀsthÀna.”6 VidyÀmeans knowledge, science, learning, scholarship, andphilosophy. VariousvidyÀs are enumerated in the texts.

Because the main body of knowledge at the time was the Vedaand its branches(vedÀïga), we can assume that women taught those subjects.6 Radhakrishnan 1960, 240-242. Elsewhere Radhakrishnan notes: “As we will see,S. makes out that Suta, Vidura and others, though born on account of the meritacquired in their previous lives, have obtained Brahma-knowledge. The author ofParimala argues that, though the Sudras may not have a right to Vedic study, bylistening to the Epics and the Puranas, on account of the strength of their meritpreviously acquired, they attain to a knowledge of Brahman. Thus knowledge ofBrahman is open to all. The ways to it may be different for different people. Allhuman beings by virtue of their humanity are entitled to Brahma-knowledge andsalvation”(307)."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"KATHERINE K. YOUNG138the soul. Because of the technical nature of the termvidyÀinvolvingits association with the Vedas and Upaniùads and because of theimportance of the maintenance of Vedic learning forØaïkara, it islikely that he chose the opportunity ofVedÀnta-sÅtra3:3:38 toreaffirm the orthodox position that×Ådras do not have access to Vediclearning.7At the same time, he did not want to close the door on theconcept of universal salvation. This takes us to some more questions.   7 There has been considerable scholarly debate over who is eligible for liberationin this life. Those who hold to×rutias the source for liberation, think that access isrestricted. Those who think experience/intuition (anubhava) is most important,consider access open to all.For another position see Rambachan 1991.50-54. For Rambachan,anubhavaonlysupplements×ruti; it is not an independent means for knowledge of Brahman (114-115). He argues that knowledge of Brahman is through the sentences of×rutiand notexperience (anubhava), including meditation (119-123). This position suggests thatonly those who have access to the Vedas can attain liberation, though he does notexplore the restrictions of eligibility.K.N. Upadhyaya (1991, 123) observes that there is a tension betweenØaïkara’sstatements that Brahman is known only through scripture and his assertion that thisknowledge “culminates in experience (anubhava) and ‘this experience or realization(avagati) of Brahman is the highest end of man’... Relying on one or the other setof these seemingly conflicting statements, scholars are led into a controversy as towhether, ... scriptural authority or intuitive experience is the authentic and the finalway of knowing Brahman orÀtman.”The author then examines Rambachan’scritique of scholars such as S. Radhakrishnan, S.K. Belvalkar, Prabhavananda, N.K.Devaraja, and Ninian Smart who hold to theanubhavaview as “the ultimately validsource of the knowledge of brahman(brahma-jñÀna).”He concludes thatØaïkaraconsiders×rutias the valid means ofknowledge (pramÀõa). “From this it follows thatthe knowledge derived from it is of an entirely different nature from the realization ofBrahman (Brahma-avagati) or the Self-knowledge (ÀtmÀnubhava).Avagatioranubhavais the very end or the culmination of allpramÀõas in which allpramÀõasare transcended. It cannot, therefore, itself be considered as apramÀõanor can theeternalÀtmanbe ever said to become an object ofpramÀõa. Unlike×rutiwhichceases when one attains the highest realization,Àtman, as eternal witness, is everpresent whetherpramÀõas are operative or non-operative. HenceÀtmancan never bereduced to aprameyaand come within the purview of apramÀõa”(Upadhyaya 1991,130).Andrew Fort, when exploring the idea of liberation within life, looks toVedÀntasÅtraIV.1.18 which says that “rites like theagnihotra, performed with orwithout meditations (vidyÀs) in this or a prior life, cause brahman realization if donewith liberation as the aim.

If women and×Ådras can attain salvation in this life, then what is meant by the ideathatbrÀhmaõasand royal sages attain the supreme goal more quickly?TheGÃtÀ, a text of secondary (perhaps we should say complementary)scriptural status (smçti), has a discussion of how deeds are directlyrelated to salvation.Ploughing, cattle-herding, and trade are the duties (karma)ofthevai×yas, born of innate nature. And of the nature of service(paricaryÀtmaka) is the duty of the×Ådra, born of innate nature(18:44). In his commentary on this verse,Øaïkara gives the opponent’s viewthat doing one’s own duties simply leads one to lower heaven(svarga) or to a better birth in another caste. To give an example ofthe opponent’s position, he quotes fromÂpastambha-dharmasÅtra2:2:2-3:Those who belong to various castes (varõa) and stages of life(À×rama), who are devoted to their ownkarma[i.e. duties], havingexperienced the results of their actions after death, they then with theresidual action (×eùa) attain to births in superior countries, castes (jÀti),families (kula), possessing [superior]dharma, span of life (Àyus),learning, behaviour, wealth, happiness, and intelligence. Also in thepurÀõais mentioned [the fact] that various results and worlds areattained by the several castes and orders.Øaïkara takes a dramatic stand against this position by arguing: “Buton account of a different cause, this result will accrue”(kÀraõÀntarÀttu idaü vakùyamÀõam phalam). This introduces the nextGÃtÀverse.Doing one’s own duties, a person obtains perfection (saüsiddhi). Howone attains success devoted to one’s own duty, hear that.   realization of Brahman is blocked - that is, certain dharmic actions can remove otheractions which block knowledge, so these actions indirectly cause liberation (whicharises directly only from knowledge.

Moreover, one who is qualified (adhikçta)attains perfection of the qualities—that is, perfection of the body andthe senses when impurity is destroyed because of the performance ofone’s own duties—which are suitable forjñÀna-niùñhÀ,that is,devotion to knowledge. In short, perfection inkarmayogacreatesperfection of the qualities suitable for devotion to knowledge. Thenew cause is doing one’s duty for its own sake. By contrast, the oldcause was desire (kÀmya). More details are given in the nextGÃtÀverse (18:46):After worshipping (abhyarcya)Him—from whom there is theevolution of beings and by whom all this is pervaded—through[performance of] his/her own duty, a human being attains perfection(siddhim).yataþ pravçttir bhÅtÀnÀü yena sarvam idaü tatam:svakarmaõÀtam abhyarcya siddhiü vindati mÀnavaþ || (18:46) Doing one’s duty for its own sake must be transformed into doingone’s duty as an act of worship. In his commentary on this verse,Øaïkara, says by “worshipping (abhyarcya, i.e.pÅjayitvÀ,i.e.ÀrÀdhya) Him, that is, the Lord by one’s own duty, that is, eachaccording to caste (varõa) as said previously, one attains perfectiononly (kevalam) regarding the qualities suitable for [pursuing]jñÀna-niùñhÀ(devotion to knowledge).”Thus,Øaïkara is not talking aboutultimate perfection here but only perfection of the body and senses. In other words, human beings, which by definition includes womenand×Ådras, can perform their duty to serve as an end in itself and thenperform it as an act of worship thereby becoming qualified for thenext stage ofjñÀna-niùñhÀ. But it may be argued thatØaïkara is nottalking about women in this context; he is speaking about people ofthe fourvarõas—brÀhmaõas, kùatriyas, vai×yas and×Ådras—so whyare these passages relevant to the issue of women obtaining thesupreme goal, that is, salvation? If this is the question, then the replyis as follows. First of all,Øaïkara himself understood women and"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"SALVATION OF WOMEN AND øæDRAS141×Ådrasas belonging to the same category—those who may bepÀpa-yonayaþ—inGÃtÀ9.32. It is well-known in MÃmÀüsÀhermeneuticsthat a member of a class can serve as the example of the entire class.In other words,×Ådracan represent theGÃtÀcategory defined as “whomay bepÀpa-yonayaþ,”which also includes women according to9.32. According toGÃtÀ18.44 and the following verses, because×Ådras can attain perfection (saüsiddhi) by the performance of theirown duty, which is to serve, and thereby are eligible for devotion toknowledge (jñÀna-niùñhÀ), the same can be argued for women. Notonly do women belong to the same category as×Ådras, they also havethe same definition of their own karma (svakarma), that is, to serve.If women serve their husbands as their duty and thereby worship theLord, they attain the perfection of the qualities necessary to pursuejñÀna-niùñhÀ. The normative role of women (strÃ-dharma) being agood wife, therefore, qualifies them to pursuejñÀna-niùñhÀ. The fruit ofjñÀna-niùñhÀisnaiùkarmya-siddhi, that is, perfection inthe form of absolute freedom from action (18:48). Verse 18:49 saysHe whose reason (buddhi) is not attached anywhere, whose self issubdued (jitÀtman), from whom desire has fled (vigata-spçha) attainsby renunciation (sannyÀsa) the supreme perfection (parama)of beingwithout action (naiùkarmya-siddhi).asakta-buddhiþ sarvatra jitÀtmÀvigataspçhaþ |naiùkarmyasiddhiü paramÀü sannyÀsenÀdhigacchati || (18:49) Øaïkara comments onGÃtÀ18:49 as follows:Someone of this type who knows the Self (Àtmajña) attains to thesupreme perfection of freedom from action (naiùkarmya-siddhi)throughsannyÀsa.

YOUNG142Here, as in other passages, the masculine pronouns are used, but inSanskrit (and in English until recent times), the masculine has stoodboth for human beings and men. This gives the modern interpreter thechoice to decide the referent by context. In this context, it is surelyhuman beings—women and men. Several verses laterØaïkaraelaborates on what he means bysannyÀsa:Dwelling in an isolated place, eating little, controlling speech, bodyand mind, constantly engaged in meditation and taking refuge indispassion (vairÀgya). (GÃtÀ18:52) After abandoning (vimucya), egotism, strength, arro-gance, desire,anger, and property, free from possession, and peaceful, one is fit(kalpate) for becoming Brahman. (GÃtÀ18:53) Absorbed in Brahman (brahmabhÅta), one whose self is tranquilneither grieves nor desires. Treating all beings alike, one attainssupreme devotion to Me (madbhaktiü labhate parÀm). (GÃtÀ18: 54)In 18:52Øaïkara glossesvivikta-sevÃ(isolated place) as forest,sandbank of a river, cave, and so forth. He glosses “havingabandoned”(vimucya) in 18:53 as “having become asannyÀsinof thehighest order (parama-haüsa-parivrÀjako bhÅtvÀ).”He comments on18:54 thatbhaktiisjñÀna-niùñhÀ, the supreme kind of devotion. In 18:55, he calls again for the renunciation of all actions and citesvarious scriptural passages such as “saünyÀsais renunciation ofaction”(saünyÀsaþ karmaõÀmnyÀsaþ) to uphold this position.Finally,Øaïkara summarizes the argument by saying that havingattained the perfection (siddhi), which is the result (phala)ofbhaktiyoga, which is the worship (abhyarcana) of the Lord by meansof one’s own duty (svakarman), one has the qualification forjñÀna-niùñhÀ, which leads to renunciation of the highest order (parama-haüsa-parivrÀjako bhÅtvÀ) and has its conclusion in the fruit ofliberation (mokùa).GÃtÀ18:66, says:Completely abandoning alldharmas, seek Me as the only refuge; I willliberate you from all sins: do not grieve. sarvadharmÀn parityajya mÀm ekam×araõaü vraja |ahaü tvÀsarvapÀpebhyo mokùayiùyÀmi mÀsucaþ ||With regard to the discussion at hand,Øaïkara makes several"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"SALVATION OF WOMEN AND øæDRAS143important points in his lengthy commentary on this verse. He notesthat the worddharmahere includes alsoadharmabecause of themeaning of beingnaiùkarmya, that is, without any action. LaterØaïkara says that devotion to knowledge (jñÀna-niùñhÀ) culminates inpure self-knowledge, which is bliss. Because supreme bliss is not aneffect to be accomplished by action, actions such asnitya-,naimittika-, andkÀmya-karmaconcern the individual who is ignorantof the Self. Consequently, liberation is attained, according toØaïkara,throughjñÀna-niùñhÀaccompanied by renunciation of all works. To conclude, scrutiny of these passages has failed to turn up anyspecific statement that women and×Ådras are barred from takingsannyÀsaafter attaining eligibility forjñÀna-niùñhÀ. Indeed the wholediscussion begins with the context of the four castes. Nowhere arebrÀhmaõas then singled out for special consideration regardingeligibility forsannyÀsa. Similarly, nowhere is it said that only twice-born men (dvijas) are eligible. Moreover,×Ådras are not told to dotheir duty in order to be reborn asbrÀhmaõas. IndeedØaïkarachallenges the view ofÂpastamba that one should desire rebirth in ahigher caste and with greater learning. We are reminded here that theGÃtÀandØaïkara tell us in 9:31 that the one of very evil conduct willquicklyattain the supreme goal. We assume that this is also the casefor those mentioned in the next verse (9:32): women,vai×yas and×Ådras. Now, it may be argued that the emphasis on “quickly”suggests that theGÃtÀandØaïkara (who follows it literally with hisgloss of×Ãghram) hold out eternal peace (×a×vat-×Ànti) in this very lifeeven for one of very evil conduct who becomes righteous not tomention women,vai×yas and×Ådras who also are said to attain thesupremegoal(parÀügatim).Becausekùipramcanmeanimmediately, the idea of liberation within this life (jÃvan-mukti)isunderscored. We still have to deal withGÃtÀ9:33, however, whichsays:How much more (kim punar) the purebrÀhmaõas and devoted royalsages, after attaining this impermanent and unhappy world, worshipMe.kiü punar brÀhmaõÀþ puõyÀbhaktÀrÀjarùayas tathÀ|anityam asukhaü lokam imaü prÀpya bhajasva mÀm||"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"KATHERINE K.

Although hecomments on all other words, he does not mentionkim punar.Kimpunarmay be construed, however, withapiin the previous verse andkùipramin the verse previous to that. It may, therefore, be understood asa synthesizing particle that indicates the relation among these verseswhich are not otherwise syntactically connected. Accordingly,Øaïkaracontrasts the purebrÀhmaõas and royal sages with the people of theprevious verses—that is, (1) the one of very evil conduct and (2) thosewho may be of evil womb (women,vai×yas, and×Ådras)—by sayingkim punar(how much more). Thus, if those of very evil conduct,women,vai×yas, and×Ådras all attain liberation in this very life, howmuch more quickly thebrÀhmaõas and royal sages attain it in this verylife. Here is another problem. If women and×Ådras can takesannyÀsa,how are we to interpret passages which suggest that onlybrÀhmaõascan takesannyÀsa? Some may still doubt whether×Ådras and womencan takesannyÀsa. Indeed, it may be claimed thatØaïkara’scommentary onMuõóaka-upaniùad1:2:12 andBçhadÀraõyaka-upaniùad3:5:1 and 4:5:15 present quite a different view, for there onlybrÀhmaõas can takesannyÀsa.InMuõóaka-upaniùad1.2.12, forinstance, it is said:There is mention of thebrÀhmaõabecause with reference tobrahmavidyÀ,thebrÀhmaõaalone (eva) has distinct qualification(vi×eùataþ adhikÀraþ) for [knowledge of] Brahman by means of therenunciation of everything. brÀhmaõaþbrÀhmaõasyaevavi×eùato ‘dhikÀraþsarvatyÀgenabrahmavidyÀyÀm iti brÀhmaõa-grahaõamEva, of course, is a particle of emphasis. Although it can mean “alone,”it can also mean “indeed, truly, really,”and so forth to strengthen theidea. It can also be a mere expletive without any exact meaning andneed not be translated.Vi×eùataþ,also an indeclinable, means accordingto the difference of, in proportion to, especially, particularly, above all."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"SALVATION OF WOMEN AND øæDRAS145Grahaõammeans mentioning with praise. Therefore, alternatively theline may be translated: “There is praise of thebrÀhmaõa especiallybecause regardingbrahma-vidyÀthebrÀhmaõa especiallyhasqualification for [knowledge of] Brahman by means of the renunciationof everything.”This line can be interpreted in two ways. One isexclusive (that is, onlybrÀhmaõas) and the other inclusive (though thebrÀhmaõas are more qualified). It may be argued, moreover, that thereare grammatical problems with the translation “thebrÀhmaõaalone.”Evamust be bound by nature or context to mean “only, solely”as in thephrase “a woman alone gives birth”or the “Absolute (Brahman) aloneis real.”Otherwise,evawould be but a particle of emphasis. This seemsto be the case here, because it is nowhere well established in×rutithatonlybrÀhmaõas can takesannyÀsa. If this is the key proof text for the position thatØaïkara is againstthe salvation of women and×Ådras in this very lifetime, or if there areno other unambiguous proof texts, then it cannot be argued thatonlybrÀhmaõas can know Brahman because of their nature or the context.Moreover, because of the addition of the wordvi×eùataþ, whichmeans especially or particularly,evamust connote emphasis. If thelatter interpretation is whatØaïkara intends, based on the grammarand his understanding, then the issue may not be whether women and×Ådras can attain salvation or takesannyÀsa, but howquicklytheyattain salvation compared to thebrÀhmaõas who are especiallyqualified. This is the conclusion reached in the prior section (whichalso referred to royal sages, who arekùatriyasand therefore twice-born). Thus, examination ofMuõóaka-upaniùad1.2.12 does notpermit us to conclude thatØaïkara confinessannyÀsaand knowledgeof the Absolute tobrÀhmaõas only. We turn now to a key statement inBçhadÀraõyaka-upaniùad4:5:15,which has also been used to prove that onlybrÀhmaõas are eligible forsannyÀsa:Or it may be that the injunctions of the×rutiabout the life-longperformance of rites concern the other two castes except thebrÀhmaõa,for thekùatriyaand thevai×yaare not entitled to monastic life.8   8 Madhavananda 1975, 552."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"KATHERINE K.

There are a number of scriptural statements which prescribe thatrituals are to be performed throughout the lifespan. Because scripturealso advocates renunciation (which is understood as the non-performance of rituals among other things) this apparent contradictionmust be overcome.Øaïkara’s tactic is to suggest that the necessity ofperforming rituals throughout the lifespan applies only tokùatriyasandvai×yas. (This implies that all the statements regardingrenunciation apply only tobrÀhmaõas). Because the statements aredirected to different groups, there is no contradiction. Such is the logic. We know thatØaïkara is a master of cleverargumentation. But does he really think that onlybrÀhmaõas areeligible to take renunciation? If he does, then why does he make thispassage hypothetical? “Or it may be ... In that case ...”Surely, the ideaof restrictingsannyÀsatobrÀhmaõas is such an important one thathadØaïkara wanted to make this case, he would have done so on anumber of occasions (there are several other scriptural statements thatwould have provided opportunity). For that matter, he could havetaken up the issue anywhere. Then, too, ifØaïkara really does thinkthat onlybrÀhmaõamen can takesannyÀsa, why does he make such apoint of refuting the position of the opponent inGÃtÀ18:45? That is,one should not do one’s duty in order to be reborn in a superior castewith superior learning (according toÂpastambha-dharmasÅtra). IfonlybrÀhmaõas can takesannyÀsaand ifsannyÀsais necessary forenlightenment, then obviously women and×Ådrasshould beencouraged to be reborn asbrÀhmaõas with superior learning. But, werecall,Øaïkara counters this position and argues that one should doone’s duty for its own sake, for worship, and to gain eligibility forjñÀna-niùñhÀwhich, in turn, should lead one to takesannyÀsa. If this argument is not yet convincing, then we have only to look atthe conclusion ofØaïkara’s discussion onBçhadÀraõyaka-upaniùad"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"SALVATION OF WOMEN AND øæDRAS1474:5:15. Here he makes the point that there is no contradiction amongthe three options (renunciation, following the four stages of life insuccession, or monasticism) in accordance with a person’s capacity,knowledge, non-attachment, and desire.Øaïkara himself here admitsthat those who are qualified for rites (and we are to understand thedvijas i.e. thebrÀhmaõas, kùatriyas, andvai×yas) are eligible for thethree orders of life (brahmacÀrya, vÀnaprastha, andsannyÀsa)inaddition togçhastha. Surely, then, he cannot hold to his previousposition that onlybrÀhmaõas are eligible forsannyÀsa. On the contrary,brÀhmaõas, kùatriyas, andvai×yas are eligible. This causes us to pauseand take seriously thehypotheticalnature ofØaïkara’s argument in hiscommentary onBçhadÀraõyaka-upaniùad1.2.12 thatkùatriyas andvai×yas must perform rites throughout their lives. Does he not signal tous with his hypothetical language that he is including this examplesimply for the sake of demonstrating that consistency in the scripturescan be achieved in this particular manner? In short, is it not an argumentfor the sake of argument rather than a point central toØaïkara’s view ofwho is eligible forsannyÀsaand salvation? This is not quite the same, of course, as saying that women and×Ådras are eligible forsannyÀsa. But one could argue that the contexthere is ritualism. BecauseØaïkara does not think that women and×Ådras are eligible for Vedic ritualism (seeVedÀnta-sÅtra1:3:34-38discussed earlier), his comments in this context are confined to thosewho are eligible for Vedic rites, that is, the twice-born (dvija). Thereis no reason to bring the salvation andsannyÀsaof women and×Ådrasinto this particular discussion, because according to his commentaryonVedÀnta-sÅtra1:3:38, the source of knowledge is not the Vedasbutsmçti. Once again, because theGÃtÀissmçtiand it advocatessannyÀsafor those who do their own duty and offer it as worship,thereby becoming eligible forjñÀna-niùñhÀandsannyÀsa, it can beconcluded that women and×Ådras, too, are eligible for renunciation. The matter, however, is not yet completely settled. InBçhadÀraõyaka-upaniùad3:5:1, it is said that having acquiredknowledge (about the Self and Brahman),brÀhmaõasrenounce thedesire for sons and wealth (that is, thegçhasthastage of life) andbecome mendicants. Living with this strength, they becomemeditative. Eventually they transcend even the opposition of"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"KATHERINE K. YOUNG148meditativeness and non-meditativeness to become knowers ofBrahman. In his commentary,Øaïkara says that the wordbrÀhmaõarefers tobrÀhmaõasof ancient times who were qualified for renunciationbecause they had renouncedthe desire for sons(that is marriage) as themeans of winning this world. Therefore, those knowers of Brahmanhad nothing to do with rituals. Known asparama-haüsas, they led amendicant’s life, lived by begging, and wore no sign (that is, the sacredthread). The opponent then raises an objection. He argues that there isno injunction for thebrÀhmaõasto renounce because the present tenseis used rather than the imperative, which signifies a command (vidhi).Thus, passages such as “thebrÀhmaõas renounce ... and live amendicant life”is a mere eulogy (artha-vÀda) and abandonment of theholy thread and so forth cannot be urged. The opponent next says thatbecause study of the Vedas is enjoined in the mendicant life, becauseonly one who wears the holy thread may study the Vedas, because onebecomes×Ådraby giving up the study of the Vedas, and because thescriptures condemn giving up the study of the Vedas, only desires are tobe renounced but not all rites and their means.Øaïkara rebuts thisposition by saying that the monk should not only give up the holy threadbut also the study of the Vedas, that the ultimate aim of the Upaniùads isto teach Self-knowledge, and so forth. Then, too, because the ritualsperformed by those who wear the sacred thread are within the range ofignorance and forms of desire (forØaïkara, everything that is notknowledge of Brahman is ignorance), their renunciation is surelyenjoined. The opponent suggests that the conflict can be resolved not byrenouncing desires but by wearing the sacred thread and studying theVedas.Øaïkara, however, will have none of this. He mentions thatbecausebrÀhmaõas in the past renounced the sacred thread and theVedas and became mendicants,brÀhmaõas today should do the same,for renunciation is enjoined. Moreover, this is complete renunciationof the highest order of monks rather thanvÀnaprastha(withdrawal tothe forest along with continued performance of ritual, wearing of thesacred thread, and study of the Vedas). Only then is one abrÀhmaõa,a knower of Brahman; for then his status as a knower of Brahman isliterally true. Therefore, the text says that the knower of Brahman"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"SALVATION OF WOMEN AND øæDRAS149may behave in any (except reckless) manner—in other words, he mayfollow any one of the four stages of life. Now, it is quite obvious that this whole discussion is not about thefact thatonly brÀhmaõas can takesannyÀsaas opposed to other castessuch askùatriyas, vai×yas and×Ådras. Indeed no other groups are evenmentioned. On the contrary, the issue once again is the interpretationof the particleeva,which can mean “only”or “especially.”WhenØaïkara states thatbrÀhmaõas are mentioned because theyevaarequalified for renunciation, it would make more sense to translateevaas “especially”because of the same grammatical problems mentionedabove and because of the context.Øaïkara’s main concern in hiscommentary here is to overcome brahmanical objections to the idea ofrenunciation because of other Vedic statements thatbrÀhmaõas mustwear the sacred thread, perform rituals, and study the Vedasthroughout their lives. The entire discussion is to resolve suchapparent contradictions of×rutiforbrÀhmaõas. This is hardly anargument for the exclusivity of renunciation forbrÀhmaõas. Rather, itis an argument thatbrÀhmaõas are eligible for renunciation (despite×rutistatements that seem to be to the contrary) and that the realbrÀhmaõais one who knows the Absolute, that is, Brahman. AlthoughØaïkara nowhere spells it out, he implies in this discussion thatbrÀhmaõas areespeciallyqualified precisely because of theirknowledge of the Vedas. Finally, we see that people other thanbrÀhmaõas are instructed inthe knowledge of Brahman. InBçhadÀraõyaka-upaniùad4:2:1-4, forinstance, Janaka, emperor of Videha (who is presumably akùatriya),is said to have studied the Vedas and heard the Upaniùads, butbecause he still had not attained self-knowledge, he sought instructionfrom YÀjñavalkya. This passage is important because it shows thatkùatriyas were eligible to study the Vedas and Upaniùads and couldattain self-knowledge in this very life. If someone were to argue thatonlybrÀhmaõas can takesannyÀsabecause only they are eligible onthe basis of knowledge of the Vedas, then we would have to reply onthe basis of this passage thatkùatriyas also are eligible for Vedicstudy and if they are not encouraged to takesannyÀsa, it must be for adifferent reason. But we also find that women are eligible for the knowledge ofBrahman. Because women and×Ådras are associated (as inGÃtÀ9:32),"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"KATHERINE K. YOUNG150further support for the eligibility ofsannyÀsaand salvation for womenis relevant to the argument.Øaïkara’s comments onBçhadÀraõyaka-upaniùad 2:4(which is YÀjñavalkya’s dialogue with his wifeMaitreyÃ) is relevant to this discussion. It is important to note thatwhereas the Upaniùad itself is non-committal on the subject ofMaitreyÃ’s liberation,Øaïkara argues the case on her behalf. Thepassage is not a simple narrative about YÀjñavalkya’s explanation ofwhy he is leaving her and seeking his own salvation. On the contrary,it is an occasion, according toØaïkara, to enlighten her. ThusMaitreyÃ, a woman, is taught knowledge of Brahman.Øaïkaraassumes that she is not eligible for Vedic rituals, but implies that thisdoes not matter, because in any case rites are not the direct means toimmortality.Øaïkara takes the argument even further by stating thatbeing abrÀhmaõaor akùatriya(or, given the context, a woman) isdue to the effects of the consciousness created by ignorance (avidyÀ)and cease when they cease to consider themselves as such a person.Øaïkara then says that the story of MaitreyÃand YÀjñavalkya is toldwith a view to enjoining renunciation of the world as part of theknowledge of the Self. This must mean MaitreyÃ’s renunciation aswell as YÀjñavalkya’s, which is explicitly mentioned. Otherwise, whywould YÀjñavalkya instruct her on the knowledge of the Self, if shewere ineligible for enlightenment? In his commentary onBçhadÀraõyaka-upaniùad2:4:5,Øaïkaraelaborates. He points out that YÀjñavalkya, exceedingly pleased thatMaitreyÃaccepted his argument that rituals are not the means toimmortality, tenderly explains to his dear wife, who is desirous ofliberation, that knowledge of the Self which confers immortality. Heinstructs her to reflect steadfastly, that is, meditate, on the meaning ofhis words. Here, because YÀjñavalkya tells MaitreyÃto meditate onhis words, his instruction can hardly be considered perfunctory butrather intended to achieve the supreme goal of enlightenment. With aview to teaching renunciation as a means to immortality, YÀjñavalkyacreates a distaste for the lifestyle of having a wife, husband, sons, andso forth, so that they be given up. He says that it is not for the sake ornecessity of the husband that he is loved by his wife, but it is for herown sake that he is loved by her and vice versa. Moreover, a wifeloves her husband ultimately for her own sake, that is, her ownliberation because she recognizes the ultimate identity of her true Self"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"SALVATION OF WOMEN AND øæDRAS151and his true Self. In this passage,Øaïkara explicitly links his teachingabout Brahman and renunciation as a means to immortality to theexample of a woman and presents the husband’s and wife’sorientation to liberation as parallel. In the same commentary (onBçhadÀraõyaka-upaniùad2:4:5),Øaïkara provides more detail on how a person achieves realization ofthe Self. He points out that realization of Brahman begins withhearing about the Self from a teacher and the scriptures but that thismust culminate in a combination of hearing, reflection, and meditationfor liberation. He then notes that concepts of caste (such asbrÀhmaõaorkùatriya), stages of life (À×ramas), and so on, upon which ritesdepend, are superimposed falsely on the Self by ignorance. Next heuses the famous analogy of falsely seeing a snake in a rope toillustrate his point.Øaïkara concludes that through hearing, reflection,and meditation, the Self is realized and all this is known. Inotherwords,Øaïkara, using the example of MaitreyÃ, reminds us that differentkinds of status (such as the difference between men and women) andeligibility (for Vedic knowledge or not) are superimpositions (adhyÀsa)on the Self. Therefore, it is suggested that she can be enlightenedthrough hearing, reflection, and meditation (because sexual differencesand Vedic eligibility are not essential to the Self and becauseenlightenment involves the Self, not the categories of the ordinaryrealm). In his commentary onBçhadÀraõyaka-upaniùad2:4:13,Øaïkaraobserves that YÀjñavalkya tells MaitreyÃthat this great, endless, infiniteReality is quite sufficient for knowledge. He does not take this occasionto add qualifications or rebut the position that knowledge of the Vedasor performance of the rituals is necessary as a prerequisite. Nowhere through these discussions doesØaïkara hint that MaitreyÃis ineligible for salvation or that she must await another life.Moreover, we are told in no uncertain terms that caste identities - andhere×Ådras an included in the list suggested byÀdi(which means“and so forth”) - belong to the realm of ignorance. In other words,just as MaitreyÃcan hear, reflect upon, and meditate on Brahman (inother words become eligible forjñÀna-niùñhÀand then takesannyÀsa),so can×Ådras.

YOUNG152 In any case, issannyÀsathe only means for attaining salvationaccording toØaïkara?In his commentary onBçhadÀraõyaka-upaniùad4:5:15,Øaïkara says that even without any explicitinjunction to takesannyÀsathat enlightened sages can becomemonastics simply because they are convinced about the immutableidentity ofÀtman and Brahman (which is beyond factors such asrituals or caste identity) or if they desire illumination. This statementsuggests that it is anoptionto embrace the monastic life. In otherwords, we find scope inØaïkara’s commentary for concluding that hethinks that×Ådras can takesannyÀsa,if they have realized the identityof the Self and Brahman. The same, of course, can be said for women. The fact that womencan attain liberation through hearing, reflection, and meditationwithout having to leave home to become a mendicant is extremelyimportant, because this means that they do not have to abandon theirmarriages to seek salvation. Given the normative nature of women’shouseholder status in Hinduism and the perceived threat that theirabandonment in large numbers would create for family life, theintergenerational cycle, and society, having access to liberationwithout formal monasticism is significant, especially becauseHinduism had no institutionalized ascetic hermitages for women(unlike Buddhism).9 This passage also suggests that there are two kinds of people whomay takesannyÀsa: those who know, i.e. are enlightened andtherefore renounce, and those whoseekto know and thereforerenounce. For the latter, renunciation is recommended because it isefficacious for bringing forth Self-knowledge. This statementdemonstratesthatsannyÀsaasliteralrenunciationofthehouseholder’s way of life is not mandatory. We are reminded hereagain ofØaïkara onGÃtÀ18:49 where he says that this Self-knowledge is attained bysannyÀsaor right knowledge, or better still,by the renunciation of all actions for which one is prepared by rightknowledge. In other words, it is an option whether one pursuesrenunciation through right knowledge alone or by renunciation of   9 See Young 1987, 68-70."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"SALVATION OF WOMEN AND øæDRAS153actions [such as the duties of caste and stage of life]. Even though thelatter is preferred, the former is possible. In his commentary onBçhadÀraõyaka-upaniùad4:5:15,Øaïkara’sstates that the knowledge ofÀtman by thevia negativa(realizing thatthe true Self is not this, not this—neti neti) and by the renunciation ofeverything are the only means of attaining immortality. As in the caseof MaitreyÃ, these are independent of any auxiliary means and thateven without any explicit injunction to takesannyÀsa, the enlightenedsage can embrace the monastic life.Øaïkara notes, moreover, thatunlike the performance of rituals, knowledge of the Self is notdependent on place, time, circumstances, and so forth because theÀtman is an eternal truth. It follows that if Self-knowledge is notdependent on circumstance, it cannot be dependent on renunciation,just as it cannot be dependent on rituals. AlthoughØaïkara does notspell out the logic explicitly, it is implied. The fact that somekùatriyashave attained right knowledge withoutbeing renunciates is indicated inØaïkara’s commentary onGÃtÀ3:20:If they [Janaka and others] were persons who had attained rightknowledge [of the Self], then the meaning is: for the sake ofloka-saïgrahathey abided in perfection accompanied with action, that iswithout renouncing action due toprÀrabdha-karmas.yaditeprÀptasamyagdar×anÀþtataþlokasaïgrahÀrthaüprÀrabdhakarmatvÀtkarmaõÀsahaivaasannyasyaivakarmasaüsiddhimÀsthitÀity arthaþ[To Arjuna] If you think ... that [action] need not necessarily be doneby someone else who has right knowledge and has achieved the goal,even then, being subject toprÀrabdha-karmas, you should performaction having in viewloka-saïgraha....atha manyase...nÀva×yamanyena kartavyaü samyag-dar×anavatÀkçtÀrtheneti, tathÀpi prÀrabdhakarmÀyattaþ tvaü lokasaügraham ...saüpa×yan kartum aharsiIfsannyÀsais necessary for enlightenment, an explanation must begiven as to whykùatriyas such as Janaka are said to have rightknowledge, to abide in perfection (saüsiddhi), and to have attained thegoal (artha, presumably enlightenment) yet are not ascetics. If onlybrÀhmaõas can takesannyÀsaandsannyÀsais necessary forenlightenment, then how cankùatriyas be enlightened?"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"KATHERINE K. YOUNG154 Does this mean that thekùatriyaswere enlightened in a previousbirth when they werebrÀhmaõas who tooksannyÀsa, but were rebornaskùatriyasbecause ofprÀrabdha-karmas (previous karma)? Thisargument cannot be made because even after entering a higher stageof life—presumably,sannyÀsa—one never descends to a lower one inanotherbirth(SeeVedÀnta-sÅtra3:4:40).Moreover,afterenlightenment one is never reborn, though one may live for some timebecause ofprÀrabdha-karmas. Therefore a possible conclusion is thatsomekùatriyas such as Janaka attained enlightenment without takingsannyÀsaand continued to act in the world (in accordance with theircaste) because ofprÀrabdha-karmas. Further substantiation for the idea thatsannyÀsais not necessaryfor salvation is found inØaïkara’s commentary onVedÀnta-sÅtra3:4:36-38.SÅtra3:4:36 states that those who are “between,”that is,not within the standard stages of life, are qualified for supremeknowledge according to scripture.Øaïkara observes that the opponent(pÅrva-pakùin) argues that they are not qualified because they are notwithin the stages of life and therefore cannot do the works (rituals andso forth) that characterize these stages and that cause knowledge.Øaïkara rebuts the opponent’s position by arguing that even if a persondoes not belong to anÀ×rama, such a one is qualified for knowledgebecause there are scriptural examples to this effect as in the case ofRaikva (who as a widower was outside the stages of life and could notperform rituals because he had no wife to accompany him)10and GÀrgÃwho possessed knowledge of Brahman (ChÀndogya-upaniùad4:1;BçhadÀraõyaka-upaniùad3: 6; 8).Øaïkara elaborates on this idea that widowers such as Raikva andwomen such as GÀrgÃmay also be competent for knowledge inVedÀnta-sÅtra3:4:38. He says that for this class of “between”people,prayers, fasts, and performance of duties as worship may substitutefor the mandatory actions of the stages of life (presumably themandatory Vedic rituals of the householder stage were foremost in hismind because they were at the heart of brahmanical orthodoxy andprerequisite for knowledge of Brahman forbrÀhmaõamen) and   10 Vedic rituals were to be performed only by a married couple (although therewere ways to circumvent this prescription)."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"SALVATION OF WOMEN AND øæDRAS155quotes Manu 2:87 to this effect. In addition, he argues that thepurificatory rituals done in previous births may culminate in spiritualperfection in this life, quotingBhagavad-gÃtÀ6:45 to this effect. Heargues that when the lack of ignorance can be seen in these people,there is obviously knowledge and absence of obstacles. For all thesereasons, saysØaïkara, widowers and the like have qualification forthe (supreme) knowledge. This argument reminds us of our earlier discussion based onVedÀnta-sÅtra1:3:34-38, which concluded that×Ådras (and women),though without a right to knowledge through the Vedas, may attainliberation because of knowledge obtained through merit (prÀrabdha-karmas ) in previous lives or through the other category of scripturecalledsmçti.11At the same timeØaïkara admits, followingSÅtra3:4:39, that the state of belonging to anÀ×ramais better on account ofthe indicatory marks. This probably refers to the idea thatperformance of one’s caste duty can be the means of liberation if doneas worship. As inGÃtÀ9:33 “How muchmore[quickly] thebrÀhmaõasand royal sages.”Because this concept supports the castesystem and caste was considered important for an ordered society,Øaïkara thought caste duties offered as worship is preferred to asociety without caste. There is one last argument on this topic. According toØaïkara’scommentary onVedÀnta-sÅtra1:1:2, both scripture and personalexperience (anubhava) are means of knowing Brahman.Øaïkaranotes that scripture is not the only means of enquiry into Brahmanunlike the enquiry into rituals (as in PÅrva- mÃmÀüsÀ). Rather, onemay resort to scriptureorexperience (intuition) according to the   11 According to Marcaurelle, “Having ‘a perceptible result’seems to definefruition of immediate Self-knowledge into annulment of ignorance and into theensuing liberation, as wholly different from fruition of rites into results, which areout of immediate perception such as attainment of heaven after death. Since the resultof rites is quite different from the result of Self-knowledge, lack of qualification forreceiving the result of action does not imply failure to obtain the result of knowledge.Øaïkara then states that anyone who wishes to obtain the result of knowledge isqualified for the discipline of knowledge and its result. Only a scriptural prohibitioncould restrict such a universal qualification. But there is none as noted byØaïkara”(Marcaurelle 2000, 51)."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"KATHERINE K. YOUNG156occasion for two reasons. First, experience (intuition) is the finalresult of the enquiry into Brahman. Second, because the reference toexperience (intuition) makes sense only because the object ofknowledge (Brahman) always exists and is not something to beaccomplished. According to Arvind Sharma, forØaïkara there are twoexceptions to the idea that liberation forØaïkara occurs throughsmçti:“one indirect and the other direct .... The indirect exception is thatmuktiis possible through knowledge or×ruti. The direct exception isthatmuktiis possible through direct intuition oranubhava. After allØaïkara’s basic position is aphoristically stated to be that liberationcan’t be attained withoutjñÀna, not that it can’t be attained without×ruti.”12 This point is illustrated by an annecdote narrated by K.Satchidananda Murty. OnceØaïkara came across an outcaste leper ina pitiable state, but who was spiritually advanced. To liberate himfrom rebirth,Øaïkara composed for him a verse on the model of thedialogue between YÀjñavalkya and Janaka inBçhadÀraõyaka-upaniùad4.3.1 ff.What is your Light?The sun during the day and lamps etc. during the night. Let it be so, but tell me what is the light that beholds (cognises) thesun, moon etc. as shining?That is my eye.And, when it is closed, what beholds them?My mind (reason).What isit that behold (cognises) your mind? I.So, you are the supreme Light? That I Am, my Master.13When he heard this, the leper immediately became a knower of theabsolute (brahma-jñÀnin) and saw Truth. Murty thinks that this was aningenious way to circumvent orthodoxy. “If one wishes to enlightenthose whom orthodoxy does not permit to hear the holy texts, let oneexpress their meaning in other words. A quiet peaceful revolution,   12 Sharma 1988.13 Murty no date 8-9."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"SALVATION OF WOMEN AND øæDRAS157indeed! No other great Vedantic teacher of medieval India whocommented on theBrahmasÅtrashowed such liberalism andhumanism.”14He concludes thatØaïkara was a compassionate knowerof Brahman. In this context yet another question comes to mind. DoesØaïkarause the same language when referring to the goal for women and×Ådrasas he uses when referring to it forbrÀhmaõasordvijas? There arevarious terms and phrases used in the commentaries byØaïkara forliberation: the goal (artha)(GÃtÀ3:20); eternal peace (×À×vat-×Ànti) and“does not perish”(na ... praõaùyati)(GÃtÀ9:31); the supreme goal(parÀgati)(GÃtÀ9:32); knowledge (jñÀna); and knowledge of Brahman(brahma-vidyÀ)(Vedanta-sÅtra1:3:38); supreme perfection of beingwithout action (naiùkarmya-siddhi) and the state of immediateliberation (sadyo-mukti)(GÃtÀ18:49); liberation(mokùa)(GÃtÀ18:55);pure-self-knowledge that is bliss (GÃtÀ18:66); knowledge of the Selfand realization of the Self (BçhadÀraõyaka-upaniùad4:5:15); and thehighest way (VedÀnta-sÅtra3:4:38). The “goal”is mentioned with reference tokùatriyas such as Janakaand is construed with the words perfection (saüsiddhi) and service(loka-saïgraha), which are contrasted with supreme perfection asabsolute freedom from action (naiùkarmya-siddhi); Janaka seeks Self-knowledge and attains “that which is free from fear due to birth,death, and so forth.”The phrases “eternal peace”and “does notperish”refer to the one of very evil conduct who become righteous.The “supreme goal”is used with reference to women,vai×yas, and×Ådras. “JñÀna”is connected with×Ådras among others. “Knowledgeof Brahman”is discussed with reference tobrÀhmaõas,kùatriyas, ordvijas.The “supremeperfection,” “immediate liberation,” “liberation,” and “pure-self-knowledge which is bliss” conclude adiscussion that began with reference to people of the four castes. Andreferences to “knowledge of the Self,” and “realization of the Self” are found in YÀjñavalkya’s dialogue with his wife MaitreyÃ. There are no terms that are exclusively associated with onecategory of person. Women,vai×yas, and×Ådras are associated withthe supreme goal just as Janaka, akùatriya, and MaitreyÃ, a woman,   14 Murty no date, 8-9."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"KATHERINE K. YOUNG158are instructed in knowledge of the Self and realization of the Self. Allfour castes are included in theGÃtÀ’sdiscussion. Only whenØaïkaratalks aboutbrahma-vidyÀdoes he exclude×Ådras when this term isconstrued as knowledge of the Vedas. Otherwise, there does not seemto be any particular association ofbrÀhmaõas and liberation or evendvijas and liberation in the passages discussed here. The idea thatknowledge of Brahman (presumably in the sense ofjñÀna-niùñhÀ)istolead to renunciation is made explicit in the case of MaitreyÃ. We canassume, given the importance ofsannyÀsaforØaïkara, that if womencan takesannyÀsa, so can×Ådras. There is perhaps some reluctance,however, to encourage kings to takesannyÀsa. This may be a politicalstrategy onØaïkara’s part. Kings are needed to rule. Therefore,Øaïkara suggests that they continue to act in the world (loka-saïgraha) because ofprÀrabdha-karmas.In this case, practicalwisdom takes precedence over spiritual wisdom. At the very end of theVedÀnta-sÅtras(4:4:22),Øaïkara says that itis a settled matter that those who through perfect knowledge havedispelled all mental darkness and are devoted to the eternally perfectliberation (nirvÀõa)do not return to this world. The same is true forthose who resort to knowledge of the qualified Brahman. Finally, weare told that repetition of the words “Non-return, according toscripture,”concludes these teachings.The Salvation of Women andØÅdrasin Historical PerspectiveThe termpÀpayonayaþwas used in theGÃtÀto describe women,vai×yas, and×Ådras. It is well known that women and×Ådras were oftenassociated in thesmçtibecause they both wereavaidika(withoutknowledge of the Veda, therefore ignorant) and because they bothserved others (master and husband). Ignorance and service wereassociated with low status, which was thought to be a product ofpÀpaor bad karma. As a result, women and×Ådras were described in someorthodox circles as being those of evil womb or bad birth (pÀpa-yonayaþ). Moreover, because manyvai×yaswere losing status at thetime of theGÃtÀ, they were included in this category as well. AlthoughtheGÃtÀopened the door to the legitimation of the salvation of womenand×Ådras (9:32), it did so ostensibly as a concession—even (api)women,vai×yas and×Ådras. Then, too, it did not eliminate thepejorative adjectival phrase: those born of evil womb (pÀpa-yonayaþ)."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"SALVATION OF WOMEN AND øæDRAS159 Arvind Sharma15has presented evidence for the fact that bothwomen and×Ådras once had access to Vedic learning and rituals, atleast in some circles. The×Ådras, for instance, had a special, positiveconnection with theYajur-veda, TaittirÃya-saühitÀ,VÀjasaneyÃ-saühitÀ,TaittirÃya-brÀhmaõa,Øatapatha-brÀhmaõa,andBçhadÀraõyaka-upaniùad(though these texts might also containnegative passages). The fact that the term×Ådras could refer toanother Indo-European group, thedÀsas,might explain the ambiguityof their status. As speakers of Sanskrit with a common Indo-Europeanreligious heritage, they could be included in some Vedic rituals(perhaps the more archaic, domestic ones), but because they did notbelong to theègveda/SÀmavedatradition, they could be viewed aswithout knowledge of these Vedas (henceavaidika) and thereforewithout the eligibility for Vedic rituals related to these texts. Thedevelopment of other “Vedic”texts (such asYajur-veda, TattirÃya-saühitÀ,VÀjasaneyÃ-saühitÀ) might have served to integrate some ofthedÀsas into the Vedic tradition (causing the non-VedicdÀsastobeconsidered degradedbrÀhmaõas or even×Ådras (and hencepermanentlyavaidika). It is not surprising, therefore, to find that×Ådras with Vediclearning are also alluded to (as the opposing position) in the MÃmÀüsÀliterature, though this school itself did not approve of them. It issignificant, Sharma argues, that their ineligibility is not mentioned inany Vedic verse. In theMÀnava-dharma×Àstra, theVedÀnta-sÅtras,and theMahÀbhÀrata(ØÀntiparvan 181.15),the loss of Vedic ritualsor knowledge for×Ådras is mentioned, though theMahÀbhÀratamentions the×Ådras positively as does theAtharva-veda,the fourth orlast Veda, which was accepted only about this same time. Sharmaargues that according to tradition, VyÀsa (whose other name wasBÀdarÀyaõa) was the author of theMahÀbhÀrataand theVedÀnta-sÅtrasand was the same author who created the fourfold division ofthe Vedas (which suggests that he was instrumental in integratingthose groups associated with theYajurandAtharvaVedas). Just as hewas acknowledging that×Ådras were to be debarred from Vedicrituals according toVedÀnta-sÅtras,he was providing another   15 Sharma 2000."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"KATHERINE K. YOUNG160approach to salvation through theMahÀbhÀrata(which includes theGÃtÀ).I would add that VyÀsa (or a “school”maintaining histradition) was trying to bridge the conceptual opposition betweeninclusion and exclusion by defining exclusivity as sole brahmanicalexpertise in the Vedas and Vedic rituals, which must be protected andhonoured, and inclusivity as universal religion based on religiousexperience,smçtiscriptures, and non-Vedic rituals and mantras(which were available to everyone, including women and×Ådras). Toget the elite to accept, at least nominally, the universalism of the latter(which was important given the popularity of MahÀyÀna Buddhism atthe time), he gave a slight privileging to thebrÀhmaõas and royalsages even in universal passages. In the centuries after the writing or redaction of theGÃtÀ, thereremained two views: that women and×Ådras were eligible forsalvation in this life, and that they were not. The former was promotedin most bhakti circles. ThatbrÀhmaõas were increasingly drawn intothese bhakti groups suggests that there was a liberal brahmanicalposition (the one that had integrated women and×Ådras). OtherbrÀhmaõas, however, were conservative (and exclusive). A case inpoint is BhÀskara, who may have lived about the time ofØaïkara orjust before. In his commentary onGÃtÀ9:32, he first gives theopponent’s view, which upholds salvation for women and×Ådras, andthen refutes this position.Øaïkara no doubt knew of the polarization on this issue inbrahmanical circles. If we assume that his aim was to protect thestatus of the Vedas (and by extension Vedic Religion, which had beenunder attack by the heterodox religions), then it is likely that hisprimary interest was to shore up orthodoxy by insisting thatbrÀhmaõas maintain expertise in and commitment to the Vedas. ManybrÀhmaõaintellectuals of the period, after all, had become Buddhists:NÀgÀrjuna, Asaïga, Vasubandhu, DignÀga, and so forth. Indeed,Øaïkara must have known that the universal religionpromoted byBuddhism could also be countered by a parallel Hindu movement. Infact, there was one already under way and he himself belonged, atleast nominally, to it as a South Indian and a Vaiùõava.16As a result,   16 See “Relations of Early Advaitins to Vaiùõavism”in Hacker 1995, 33-39."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"SALVATION OF WOMEN AND øæDRAS161he would have been aware of the power of sectarian proselytizing (asin the Tamilbhaktihymns) to women and×Ådras. Thus, we conclude thatØaïkara wanted it both ways. He wantedhis philosophical system (dar×ana) to appeal to conservative circles(because he wanted to protect the Vedas) and by extension the Vedictradition. As a result, he had to define a purpose for knowledge of theVedas in order to safeguard them, and so he argued that it helpedbrÀhmaõas and royal sages to gain salvationmore quickly. ButØaïkara certainly did not want to close the door on liberalones. Hence his emphatic endorsement of the salvation of women,vai×yas and×ÅdrasinGÃtÀ9:32; his modifying addendum onVedÀnta-sÅtra1:3:38 where he held outsmçtias an alternative to×ruti(the Vedas); his view thatanubhavaas direct intuition ofBrahman was universally available; his understanding that liberationcould occur for anyone who had accumulated sufficient merit inprevious lives; and his position that doing one’s own duty leads toknowledge of Brahman, and so forth. In the final analysis, though, ifsalvation even for the evil one could be attainedin this very life,“more quickly”forbrÀhmaõas and royal sages was hardly somethingfor women and×Ådras to quibble over! In sum, the texts ostensibly say different things about who iseligible for salvation and renunciation. BecauseØaïkara is respondingto a specific text that comments on a specific context, his specificcomments cannot be generalized. Rather, we have had to search forthe logic that holds them all together, that is, the fact that he wanted tomaintain both exclusivity and inclusivity, and thereby have his cakeand eat it too. As such,Øaïkara was in the tradition of VyÀsa, buteven more subtle about revealing his hermeneutical strategies tobridge the yawning gap between inclusiveness and exclusiveness.Even this deliberate opaqueness could be considered a strategy tofinesse integration and preempt exploitation of a loophole. Butanotherexplanation is that the confusion occurred because ofØaïkara’sdisciples.17In his commentary onØaïkara’s commentary on   17 This position is accepted by Hacker (see Hacker in Halbfass 1995, 27) thoughhe expresses some doubt because an old commentator on one of Sure×vara’s worksnever explicity calls Sure×vara’s teacherØaïkara (inHalbfass 1995, 43) but only by"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"KATHERINE K. YOUNG162BçhadÀraõyaka-upaniùad3:5:1, Sure×vara, reputed to be a directdisciple ofØaïkara, said thatØaïkara held the view that onlybrÀhmaõas could obtain salvation but he himself thought that anydvijawas eligible. First, Sure×vara’s debate withØaïkara was not over whetherwomen and×Ådras can attain salvation, but whether onlybrÀhmaõasor alldvijas (twice-born men) can attain it. Sure×vara attributed theformer position toØaïkara and argued for the latter. Myreconstruction ofØaïkara’s thought shows, however, that he couldnever have been so exclusive (restricting liberation tobrÀhmaõasonly) because he accepted arguments for the salvation of women and×Ådras according tosvakarma,smçti, andanubhavathereby creatingscope for a universal religion, and because he kept to the literalmeaning ofGÃtÀ9:32. It seems, then, that Sure×vara was not intimately familiar withØaïkara’s own thought. It could be that he limited himself to study ofØaïkara’s commentary onBçhadÀraõyaka-upaniùad3:5:1 and 4:5:15(which could be used to support a more conservative position) andignored his commentary on theVedÀnta-sÅtras andGÃtÀ(the moreliberal one). But that would have been very curious if he were indeeda direct disciple. It is more likely that Sure×vara lived well afterØaïkara. By that time the conservative position thatsannyÀsaforbrÀhmaõamen only based onBçhadÀraõyaka-upaniùad3:5:1 and4:5:15 had been reinforced and was now mainstream as brÀhmaõashad become more powerful and caste hierarchy had come to dominateeven the devotional (bhakti) movement. Sure×vara argued against thistradition by now attributed toØaïkara himself to establish thatdvijasare included in those eligible for salvation, a position thatØaïkaraindeed held—along with others. Moreover, no one had made theeffort to read all his works systematically with this issue in mind. There has also been considerable confusion over the figure ofSure×vara, namely, whether the figure of Vi×varÅpa (who upheld theview that onlybrÀhmaõas can takesannyÀsa) was the same person as   certain titles (albeit ones that are found in the colophons ofØaïkara’s “authentic”works). It is also possible, I think, that the colophons were written later than the textand introduced anachronistic material."},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"SALVATION OF WOMEN AND øæDRAS163Sure×vara (who argued that alldvijas could takesannyÀsa). P.V.Kane18accepts that they are the same person despite the obviouscontradiction in their two positions and does not dispute the idea thatthey are direct pupils ofØaïkara. Also Kane does not challenge theidea thatØaïkara established fourmañhas for the propagation of hisviews. But the fact thattenorders ofadvaitin sannyÀsins developed,purportedly in succession fromØaïkara’sfourdisciples is curious.19Moreover, “pedigrees of teachers and pupils appear to have beenfabricated, no two of which agree in toto and in some of themSure×vara is said to have lived for 700 or 800 years.”20Surely in thelight of such confusion, it is best to rely onØaïkara’s own works forhis views regarding who is eligible forsannyÀsaand salvation, ratherthan the works of so-called disciples who may have lived in a latertime and had their own views regarding eligibility.21 In any case, none of the later medieval works support the idea ofsannyÀsafor women and×Ådras (perhaps because of growingconservatism in the society at large on account of the Musliminvasions) except theJÃvan-muktiviveka, which says that women and×Ådras are eligible fortyÀga(renunciation) following the example ofMaitreyÃ(BçhadÀraõyaka-upaniùad4:5:3-4). This text makes adistinction between informal renunciation (tyÀga) and formalrenunciation (sannyÀsa), which was probably associated with theØaïkaramañhas:women and×Ådras may abandon all actions, thoughthey could not adopt the peculiar ascetic mode of life with its outwardsymbols.22(This text also says that the “mother and the wife of asannyÀsinwill not be born again as women, but they may be born asmen.”This does not suggest that womenmustbe reborn as men toseek liberation. On the contrary, it accounts for an anomaly. Becausewives and mothers are told to be devoted to their husbands and sons,   18 Kane 1973, vol. 1, 562-3.19 Hacker notes that there is no epigraphic evidence forØaïkaramañhas before thefourteenth century (in Halbfass 1995, 29).20 Kane 1974, vol.2, 948-949.21 Stanzas 1-2 that mentionØaïkara in Sure×vara’sPañcÃkaraõavÀrttikaare“apparently spurious (cf. P. Tuxen in: Aus Indiens Kultur, Festgabe R. v. Garbedargebracht, Erlangen, 1927, p. 134)”in Halbfass 1995, 55 note 12.22 Kane 1974, vol. 2:946."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"KATHERINE K. YOUNG164but because their husbands and sons can renounce them to seeksalvation—which gives them an anomalous status and perhapssubjects them to hardship as well—these women are automaticallygiven the reward of being reborn as men in the next life. This mighthave had some appeal in conservative circles). One last passage in this context is worthy of mention. According toØrÃkara’sbhÀùyaonVedÀnta-sÅtraI.3.34,sannyÀsaas defined by Vedictexts is only for thedvijas,whereas mere abandonment of worldlypleasures and desires (nyÀsa) is for women,×Ådrasand mixed castes.23In other words, a distinction is also made here between Vedic and non-Vedic types of renunciation. By the Moghul period, however, some of the ten orders acceptedwomen ascetics. This development is related to the activities ofMadhusÅdana SarasvatÃwho introduced a liberalization in the asceticorders by initiatingkùatriyas,vai×yas, and×Ådrasto counter theproselytism of the Muslim fakirs. Because of the close association of×Ådras and women, it does not surprise us to find that women were nowaccepted into some of these orders. (Today, there are female and×ÅdrasannyÀsinsin six and half of the ten orders.) 24And women and×Ådrasare studying the Vedas and performing Vedic rituals in other contexts.BIBLIOGRAPHY1.Primary textsBhagavadgÃtÀBhÀùya by BhÀskarÀcÀrya(Sanskrit text). 1965.
