[{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" Hinduism and the Ethics of Warfare in South Asia From Antiquity to the Present This book challenges the view, common among Western scholars, that precolonial India lacked a tradition of military philosophy. It traces the evolution of theories of warfare in India from the dawn of civili-zation, focusing on the debate between dharmayuddha (just war) and kutayuddha (unjust war) within Hindu philosophy. This debate centers around four questions: What is war? What justii es it? How should it be waged? And what are its potential repercussions? This volume provides evidence of the historical evolution of strategic thought on the Indian subcontinent that has heretofore been neglected by modern historians. Further, it provides a counterpoint to scholarship in political science that engages solely with Western theories in its analysis of independent India’s philosophy of warfare. Ultimately, a better understanding of the legacy of ancient India’s strategic theorizing will enable more accurate analysis of modern India’s military and nuclear policies.

While chatting, he told me that he was interested in the interconnections between religious ethics and the conduct of warfare. Then he asked me if I had ever thought of the interconnections between one of the world’s oldest religions (Hinduism) and the conduct of war. I showed my interest and said that I was willing to research it. And then Reichberg said, well then, you are ‘in’ the project. I am extremely grateful to him not only for intro-ducing the idea of the interrelationship between religion and warfare but also for sustaining me i nancially and morally for about i ve years while I was engaged in writing this monograph. While I was writing the monograph, my friend and mentor at PRIO, Professor Scott Gates, always made me conscious of what Hinduism has to say about uncon-ventional (intra-state) warfare. This volume builds upon the two essays I published in the Journal of Military Ethics (2007) and in a volume published by the United Nations Press (2009), and also on the 30,000-word piece on Hinduism and warfare I wrote for an anthology as part of Reichberg’s project. I am also fortunate to have met Dr. Beatrice Rehl in Cyprus and then in Oslo; she kindly agreed to consider the volume for publication by Cambridge University Press.

There have been some sporadic attempts by Western commentators to l esh out military ethics based on examination of Hindu religious texts. What we lack is a consistent analytical narrative, taking into account the opinions of different Indian acharyas (teachers) who wrote commentaries on vigraha (war) and jus-tice throughout the ancient and medieval eras. To give an example, very few Western scholars know that Kamandaka (sixth century ce ) speaks of the interrelationship between righteous war, people’s support and a stable government, long before Carl Von Clausewitz came up with his famous trinity. And Kautilya (third century bce ) is probably the i rst authority on biological warfare. Again, Kautilya, Manu (Common Era) and Kamandaka wrote about the interconnections between conventional warfare ( vigraha ) and insurgencies ( kopa ). Modern historians dealing with South Asia completely neglect the historical evolution of military-strategic thought on the Indian subcontinent. And political scientists mostly engage with Western theories while trying to analyze the contours of independent India’s philosophy of warfare and nuclear gaming. The objective of this volume is to trace the effect of Hinduism on the evolution of theories of warfare 1 in India from the dawn of civiliza-tion until the present era. The focus is to bring out the complex debate between dharmayuddha and kutayuddha within Hindu philosophy. It must be noted that these two concepts are mere abstract and ideal 1 In this volume the term “theory of warfare” is considered equivalent to the philosophy behind warfare. "},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Hinduism and the Ethics of Warfare in South Asia2types, and in pure form have never existed or operated in history. The terms are to be understood as a heuristic device for clarifying certain trends in history. Somewhat like Carl Von Clausewitz’s concept of abso-lute war/total war, dharmayuddha and kutayuddha are ideal concepts that can never actually be realized due to ‘frictions’ in the real world. In fact, the two above-mentioned Hindu concepts were never frozen in time. Rather, they have evolved through the last two millennia. For instance, the concept of dharmayuddha in the two epics ( Ramayana and Mahabharata around 400 bce ) is quite different from the dharmayud-dha concept that emerged in the Manavadharmasastra ( Laws of Manu ) composed around the Common Era. This book attempts to show how these two key concepts have emerged gradually throughout the last two millennia. The debate revolves around four questions: what is war, what are the justii cations for starting it, how it should be waged, and i nally, what could be the possible repercussions of using organized violence? The tension between the Lokayata (i.e., empiricist/positivist/materialist) and non-materialist/spiritual traditions within darsana (Indian philosophy) needs to be chiseled out. Hence, the comparative analysis of different religious-cultural streams within the heterogeneous Hindu tradition is undertaken. This monograph partly takes into account the religious tra-ditions that emerged within India (i.e., Buddhism and Jainism) as well as the foreign inputs (Islam and Christian militarism) and how they have shaped the traditional Hindu view of the relationship between warfare, politics and good governance. During the late twentieth century, as a reaction to technological deter-minism and Euro-American pragmatism in warfare and strategy, the strategic culture approach has evolved. The strategic culture approach emphasizes cultural factors in order to explain the origins, conduct and results of warfare. 2 Jack Snyder dei nes strategic culture as ‘the sum total of ideas, conditioned emotional responses and patterns of habit-ual behaviour that members of a national strategic community have acquired through instruction or imitation.’ 3 Ken Booth dei nes strategic culture as a nation’s traditions, values, attitudes, patterns of behaviour, habits, customs, achievements and particular ways of adapting to the 2 William H. Mott IV and Jae Chang Kim, The Philosophy of Chinese Military Culture (Houndmills, Basingstoke: Palgrave, 2006), p. x. 3 Quoted from Lawrence Sondhaus, Strategic Culture and Ways of War (London/New York: Routledge, 2006 ), p. 3. "},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Introduction3environment and solving problems with respect to the threat of the use of force. Strategic culture is important, writes Booth, in order to understand the actions of another country on its own terms. Strategic culture helps us to understand the motivations, self-image and behavioral patterns of a particular country. Booth goes on to say that we live in a created world and that strategic realities are in part culturally constructed as well as culturally perpetuated. 4 Several military historians also highlight the interrelationship between culture and warfare. Jeremy Black says that throughout history not all societies have been driven merely by the motivation to come up with the most combat-effective military machines. In fact, the acceptance and adoption of new technologies are shaped by cultural factors. Culture shapes how societies understand loss and suffering, at both the individual and collective levels of the soldier and the society. 5 In fact, the concepts of defeat and victory are partially shaped by culture, and this inl uences the style of military combat. Warfare is a product of culture, and combat is in turn a major factor in shaping culture. 6 Along with culture, the social fabric also shapes organized violence. In the South Asian context, during the pre-British era war offered an avenue of social mobility for men of the lower classes. Successful military leaders effected a permanent, often inheritable elevation of social and material position. This upward mobility of able military men increased the stability of the stratii cation system. Stephen Peter Rosen claims that internal divisions (stratii cations) are carried over into the military orga-nization spawned by the host society. A state may occasionally, writes Rosen, go for a military system that rel ects the dominant structures of the society, and such a military organization is not always the most effective. 7 Social structures may or may not vary across cultural boundaries. By contrast, the culturalists argue that the concept of a culture remains constant within the cultural boundaries. The strategic culture approach focuses on the strategic behaviour of nations. Such behaviour varies 4 Ibid., p. 5. 5 Jeremy Black, ‘Series Preface’, in Everett L. Wheeler (ed.), The Armies of Classical Greece (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2007 ), p. ix. 6 R.

"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Hinduism and the Ethics of Warfare in South Asia4because the subjective ideas of the strategic elites vary. Hence, differ-ent ideas about the same reality result in different behaviours. In other words, strategic culture theory attempts to explain the complex behav-iour of small groups of powerful individuals. 8 Warfare is the product of both social and cultural forces, and Hinduism is a sort of socio-cultural system. Azar Gat assumes that religion fos-ters social cohesion among particular communities and that this in turn enables the community to survive in the big bad world. In fact, reli-gion can be seen as part of the defence mechanism of a community. Gat rightly states that scarcity is partly relative. Competition and violent con-l ict intensify when opportunities and abundance increase. The potential for violent behaviour is innate, but such behavior is also socially learnt. Pugnacity and pacii sm can be habituated by experience. 9 The cultural relativist thesis claims that rationality is the product of Western culture and is not applicable to the non-Western societies. 10 Christopher Coker asserts that the West is unique in secularizing war-fare. Since the West has instrumentalized war, it has turned its back on the ritualized aspects of combat. However, for non-Western societies, vio-lence remains the moral essence of the warrior. Taking the example of the Bhagavad Gita , Coker asserts that for non-Western warriors, violence is existential. War for them is as much achieving one’s humanity as achiev-ing the objective of the state, but this is not the case for modern Western soldiers. 11 Coker’s view is dominant among Western military historians, the majority of whom assert that classical Greek civilization gave rise to the Western Way of Warfare, which was further rei ned in Roman and medieval times. The Western tradition of warfare, characterized by tech-nological innovations, rationality, and the absence of religious and cul-tural ethics as regards the application of violence, gave the West global military superiority during the early modern era. 12 In recent times, the 8 Ibid., pp. 7, 14. 9 Azar Gat, War in Human Civilization (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006), pp. 55, 139. 10 Victoria Tin-Bor Hui, War and State Formation in Ancient China and Early Modern Europe (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2005), p. 18.

Warfare has been both existential and instrumental in China, India and the Islamic polities throughout history. Andrew Scobell asserts that China has a dual-istic strategic culture. One strand is a Confucian one, which is conl ict-averse and defensive-minded, and another strand is realpolitik , one that favours military solutions and is offensively oriented. 14 A similar dualistic tradition, as exemplii ed by dharmayuddha (moder-ate, non-military, defensive-oriented statecraft) and kutayuddha ( realpo-litik in nature and aggressive in orientation) is also present in Hinduism. Manoj Kumar Sinha asserts that in ancient India, the proponents of dharmayuddha generated laws of armed conl ict based on humanitarian considerations in order to limit the suffering caused by war. 15 Unlike the jihad of Islam and the crusade of Christianity, there is no justii cation in the dharmayuddha tradition for war against foreigners of other faiths. Surya P. Subedi notes that the concept of dharmayuddha in Hinduism is directed against the evil, whether they are nationals or aliens. 16 In con-trast, the proponents of kutayuddha focus on overt militarism. 17 A RAND Corporation analyst, George K. Tanham, writes that the fatalism inherent in Hinduism has discouraged sustained long-term stra-tegic planning by Indian rulers throughout history. Tanham implies that Hindu India has no tradition of strategic thought. 18 One modern Indian scholar has challenged Tanham by arguing that, India being a country with an oral culture, strategic lessons have been imparted orally from generation to generation over thousands of years. 19 13 John A.

"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Hinduism and the Ethics of Warfare in South Asia6 By analyzing the treatises of famous Hindu acharya s, we can get some idea of the Hindu theoreticians’ attitude towards just and unjust wars. This volume does not attempt to provide a textual analysis of the var-ious religious and quasi-religious texts generated under the rubric of Hinduism over the last two millennia. The objective of this volume is to elucidate the complex interaction between the evolution of the philoso-phy of warfare and Hindu religious ethics in South Asia during the last two and half millennia. Further, this volume follows the ‘history from the top’ approach and concentrates on texts generated by the elite ‘grand’ tradition rather than on the little tradition of folklore, local cults and regional deities. This is because, as it will become evident in the following chapters, the strategic managers and warlords throughout South Asian history have been inl uenced by the grand tradition. 20 This volume has a broad scope both geographically and temporally. The genesis of military ethics in South Asia is studied in a global context by comparing and contrasting the Indian case with those of other civili-zations. Major trends will become visible when sweeping cross-cultural analysis is undertaken across temporal periods. This is necessary in order to tackle the argument put forth by several historians that a Western Way of Warfare emerged in classical Greece and is still functioning. Also, some Western scholars occasionally group the Chinese and Indian mili-tary cultures as an Eastern Way of Warfare, which is posited as the polar opposite of the Western Way of Warfare. In fact, this volume tries to show that numerous similarities as well as dissimilarities have existed between the Indian and Chinese military cultures, on the one hand, and the Indian and Western military cultures, on the other. Michael I. Handel, in making a comparative analysis of Carl Von Clausewitz’s and Sun Tzu’s views, reaches the conclusion that the basic logic of strategy, like that of polit-ical behaviour, is universal. 21 In this book, Indian theorists and military theories are compared to Chinese and Western political philosophers and military thinkers in order to show that the binary concepts of Western and Eastern traditions of warfare are faulty. Rather than engaging in abstract theorizing, this volume will attempt to historicize each theorist. For instance, Kautilya operated at a time when the pan-Indian Mauyran Empire was at its zenith. Kamandaka, by 20 The grand tradition is the high Sanskrit culture as exemplii ed by texts like Arthasastra , Nitisara , etc. generated by persons close to the seat of state power for an elite audience. 21 Michael I.

"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Introduction7contrast, functioned at a time when the Hindu civilization was facing mil-itary threat from the Central Asian nomads. Hence, Kautilya could afford to be more aggressive than the defensive-minded Kamandaka. Chunks of the writings of the various acharya s are included to give the reader a feel for the theorists’ thinking patterns. Dating and assigning authorship to the various classical Hindu texts is almost impossible. This is because ancient authors put their own views in the third person, presenting them as said by earlier writers. 22 We know something about Herodotus, Thucydides, St. Augustine and so on, but next to nothing about Kautilya, Manu and the author of the epics. In fact, we are not even sure whether Manu, Narayana (the author of Hitopadesa ) and others were real indi-viduals or not. In darsana , unlike in Western philosophy, the individual is unimportant. The individual author is merely recording truth, that is, the word of God. Secondly, most of the ancient Sanskrit works were written after the sixteenth century. 23 This was due to the domination of the oral tradition in South Asia. Before the late medieval era, most works were transferred orally from generation to generation. Hence, scholars con-tinue to debate about the level of interpolation. Further, Sanskrit scholars debate whether these works are the product of a single author or sev-eral authors. The debates regarding date and composition of classical Sanskrit works are of interest to Indologists and linguistic experts. To an extent, Homer’s Iliad is also characterized by this problem. While one group says that the Iliad represents a work of the early classical era, others argue that the Iliad comprises several layers: one going back to the archaic Greek era, another to the heroic era, and so on. China’s strategic culture, say William H. Mott IV and Jae Chang Kim, has emerged over two millennia. The problem as regards ancient Chinese history is the uncertainty regarding dates, numbers and facts, and espe-cially motives, perceptions and feelings. Dates are important because they establish a sequence of what precedes and what follows that allows some inferences not only about cause and effect but also about the evolution of strategic thinking. 24 Many scholars doubt whether Sun Tzu was a histori-cal i gure. 25 Similar doubts are raised about the historicity of the classical 22 P .

Mott IV and Kim assert that the Chinese chroniclers used numbers not as data but as a literary technique to convey impressions. The same could be applied to ancient and medieval India’s chroniclers. Mott IV and Kim claim that the ancient thinkers have deliberately recorded i ction and poetry and that their works are not constrained by historical facts. Unlike Euro-American philosophies, Chinese strategic culture has conceptualized the state not as an abstract or legalistic notion but as an organic link between tao and people. 26 Ancient Hinduism also considered society and rashtra (state) as an extension of the cosmic order. 27 Jitendra Nath Mohanty asserts that all the classical schools of Hindu philosophy accept the idea that knowledge leads to desire, desire to effort, effort to action and action to success or failure. Success occurs if the object has been correctly determined in knowledge. Mohanty goes on to say that to a large extent Indian philosophy is theoretical. At the same time, the Indian mind assumed, a priori, that knowledge of truth must be practically benei cial. In the Vedanta , Samkhya and much of Buddhist literature, it is emphasized that knowledge of reality, by dis-pelling ignorance, shall remove suffering. It is knowledge upon which they focus because only knowledge can remove ignorance; no amount of practice can. 28 Over time ideas emerged through discourse, but ideas also evolved through practice. Andrea M. Gnirs says that the written sources of ancient Egypt are not strictly historical but are characterized by a pro-pagandistic tradition. These texts rel ect an elite ideology and describe the world as it should be rather than as it is. 29 The same applies to the texts generated in ancient India. The practical conceptions of warfare comprise grand strategy (what the Americans call national security policy), military strategy, military doctrine and tactics. Grand strategy includes both military and non-military elements like foreign policy (diplomacy), economic aspects of warfare and military strategy. Military strategy refers to the planning and actions related to the use of military assets for conducting warfare.

Military strategy, Rajagopalan continues, specii es how a particular objective is to be reached and is conditioned by various environmental factors that include the balance of opposing forces, the capabilities of the respective commanders and geography. 31 Rajagopalan’s dei nition of military doctrine appears too broad. And at the same time, Rajagopalan appears to be a realist and does not take into account the cultural ethos shaping doctrine and strat-egy. Military doctrine could be dei ned as a set of views on war and the principles concerning its conduct that are adopted by the military leader-ship and taught in the military academies and that provide the basis for war plans. It is fruitful to dei ne military tactics much more inclusively as military thought and practice regarding combat on the battlei eld. The evolution of the philosophy of warfare has involved a continuous interaction between the material culture and the ideas generated by the intellectual elites of the society. The material culture comprises the tech-nological base, the mode of production of the society and the structure of the polity. Constant dialogue has occurred between the techniques and tools of warfare and the ideas about why and how to conduct warfare. In other words, the evolution of the ethics of warfare in South Asia cannot be understood without understanding the war-making tools and tech-niques available to communities during particular periods. The term “military ethics” refers to the norms of behaviour of armies and polities during wartime and the collective set of ideas that gave birth to such norms. The just war concept in Western philosophy com-prises jus ad bellum (just resort to war) and jus in bello (rules about battlei eld behaviour). Torkel Brekke asserts that, unlike Western theo-reticians, Hindu writers took very little interest in matters of jus ad bel-lum and in particular the principle of right authority. He maintains that this was because the Hindu theoreticians made no distinction between private duels and public violence or between internal and external ene-mies. According to Brekke, this was because pre-modern Indian polities were amorphous structures with fuzzy territorial borders.

Because the acharya s, unlike many Western theoreticians, realized the linkages and close intermeshing of vigraha (conventional warfare) and kopa (unconventional warfare/insurgency), this volume throws light on the theory and praxis of both inter-state and intra-state warfare. Scholars studying the interconnections between religion and violence have to grapple with the problem of whether monotheism has been more prone to violence. Hans Kung claims that long before the advent of mono-theism, the world was full of violence associated with religion and that there is no evidence that violence associated with religion has increased since the advent of the monotheistic religions. 33 Hinduism is not a monotheistic religion. It has neither a single prophet nor a single church nor a single authoritative text. In fact, there are 330 million gods and goddesses in the Hindu pantheon. One Western scholar correctly asserts that there is no single coherent body of beliefs in Hinduism. 34 Even within Hinduism, various branches like Brahmanism, Vedantism, Vaishnavism, Shakti and Tantra co-exist. Many scholars have questioned whether the concept of religion should be applied at all in the case of Hinduism, which is a way of life. According to them, Hinduism as it is understood today evolved in the nineteenth century due to the inter-action between a classii cation and categorization scheme introduced by the British colonial state, Western education and indigenous reform movements. 35 There is much truth in this assertion. However, it cannot be denied that Brahmanism as it has evolved from the dawn of Aryan civilization in South Asia constitutes the core of Hinduism even today. Tanham, like Stephen Peter Rosen, accepts that the core of Hinduism is the caste system, which has continued to operate on the 32 T orkel Brekke, ‘The Ethics of War and the Concept of War in India and Europe’, NUMEN , vol. 52 (2005), pp. 59, 61, 80. 33 Hans Kung, ‘Religion, Violence and “Holy Wars”’, International Review of the Red Cross , vol. 87, no. 858 (2005), p. 255. 34 Coker, Waging War without Warriors? , p. 141. 35 T orkel Brekke, Makers of Modern Indian Religion in the Late Nineteenth Century (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002), pp. 1–52; Romila Thapar, ‘Imagined Religious Communities?

During the vedic and epic periods, Hinduism evolved around the vedas and the Bhagavad Gita . From the Common Era onwards, along with the dharmasastra liter-ature, Manusamhita/Manavadharmasastra played an important role in the evolution of Hinduism. After 900 ce , various commentaries on the above-mentioned texts mainly shaped the growth of Hinduism. From the i fteenth century onwards, the two epics, Ramayana and Mahabharata , acquired reli-gious signii cance. One can argue that Hinduism from 1500 bce onwards is the dominant religion of most of the people living between the Indus River and the Arakan Yomas. Hinduism is an amalgam of various strands of phi-losophy as well as a religion (based on certain rituals, beliefs, etc). Hence, Hinduism is best described as a culture, a way of life, that is, dharma . Throughout history, India has remained a multi-lingual, multi-ethnic and multi-religious society. Along with Hinduism, other religions like Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, Islam and Christianity continue to exist side by side. In the 1990s, about 83 percent of India’s population was Hindu, 11 percent Muslim, 2.6 percent Christian and slightly over 3 per-cent Sikhs, Jains, Parsis and Buddhists combined. 37 As this volume shows, acharya s as well as the rulers and warlords of the ancient and medie-val periods were aware of the pervasive inl uence of the brahmanical order. And in modern India, politicians of different hues (M. K. Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, etc.) as well as generals acknowledge the inl uence of Hinduism in statecraft. This volume, in seven chapters, shows the interconnections between Hinduism and the theory and praxis of warfare in South Asia from the collapse of Indus Valley civilization until today. Whether it involved the use of chariots or nukes, the statesmen and warlords of South Asia have taken into account the Hindu social and cultural ethos. Broadly, the theory of warfare has revolved around two poles: dharmayuddha and kutayuddha . These two concepts, as used in this book, are not strictly equivalent to just/holy war and unjust war. In fact, the meaning of the two concepts has changed with time and place. The i rst chapter deals with the development of military ethics in the veda s and the two epics and the constraints it imposed on the conduct of warfare on the subcontinent. The second chapter shows the inl uence of 36 Tanham, ‘Indian Strategic Thought: An Interpretive Essay’, p. 42. 37 Mark Jurgensmeyer, Religious Nationalism Confronts the Secular State (1993; reprint, New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1996), p. 81.

Chapter 3 deals with Kautilya, the father i gure of the Kutayuddha school of thought. Strands of ideas in Kautilya Arthasastra are compared to the realist and liberal philosophers and political philosophies of the West and ancient China. While Chapter 3 is an example of critical philosophy, the rest of the chapters are examples of critical history. Chapter 4 shows the evolution of the dharmayuddha and kutayuddha concepts between the Common Era and the coming of the Turks in the tenth century. This chapter starts with Manu’s Manavadharmasastra . Manu led the brahmanical reaction against Kautilya’s kutayuddha . Kamandaka’s Nitisara offered a watered-down version of kutayuddha . Kamandaka realized that in the real world, a mix of dharmayuddha and kutayuddha is most desirable. Kamandaka was supported by Bana, who argues in Harsacharita that at times it is nec-essary even for a righteous ruler to wage some form of kutayuddha . This chapter concludes by discussing some regional literature ( Hitopadesa , Panchatantra , Kathasaritsagara , etc.) and by comparing the Tamil kural to the Sanskrit texts generated in north India. Chapter 5 discusses the response of Hinduism to the establishment of Islamic rule on the subcontinent. The Hindu response evolved from confrontation with Islam to gradual adap-tation and coexistence and at times collaboration with the Islamic poli-ties. Chapter 6 shows how British and Indian nationalists used Hinduism for their own purposes. This chapter focuses both on militant Hinduism and on non-violence as enunciated by Gandhi. Interestingly, both groups derived their ideas from the vedic texts. Finally, in the last chapter, the leg-acy of ancient India’s philosophy in post-independence India’s conduct of conventional and unconventional wars is studied. Further, India’s nuclear policy is analyzed through the lens of Hindu strategic thought. Along with the quasi-secular manuals on statecraft written by the acha-ryas , this volume also utilizes the brahmanical literature. The Brahmins were traditional advisors to the Indian rulers and sometimes occupied the highest echelons of the bureaucracy. The main sources for our pro-ject are the religious and niti (legal) literature of the Hindus; fables like Hitopadesa and Kathasaritsagara ; histories written by the Muslim schol-ars of medieval India; the memoirs of the British and Indian political and military elite; Indian Defence Ministry Reports, articles written by Indian military ofi cers in the various service journals; plus military i les available at India Ofi ce Records, the British Library in London, and the National Archives of India at New Delhi.

In this chapter, the objective is to show the interrelationship between war making (an integral part of state formation) and the quasi-religious vedic and epic philosophy. The vedic age extends roughly from 1500 bce to 600 bce . 1 The Rig Veda is the i rst of the four vedas (the other three are the Yajur , Sama and Atharva Vedas , respectively). 2 The Rig Veda was probably composed between 1300 and 1000 bce . 3 There are problems involved in historicizing the society that the two epics, Ramayana and Mahabharata , represent, just as there are problems in historicizing Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey . While some say that Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey represent the Greek Dark Age or the eighth century bce , others argue that Homer is representing multi-layered materials from different eras. 4 Tradition ascribes the authorship of Ramayana to Valmiki, 5 but about his background we know nothing, just as we draw a complete blank as regards the background of Vyasa, the so-called author of the Mahabharata .

The poem is divided into seven kandas (books) that chronologically chart the career of Rama. 7 There are hundreds of manuscripts about the Ramayana ; most of them date from the sixteenth century ce, and the oldest among them goes back to 1020 ce . 8 Brockington identii es i ve stages in the growth of Ramayana . Stage 1 extended from the i fth to the fourth century bce, and during that stage about 37.1 percent of the Ramayana was com-posed. This constitutes the Valmiki Ramayana . Stage 2 extended from the third century bce untill the i rst century ce, a stage during which about 34.05 percent of the text was composed. During both of these stages, the Ramayana was orally transmitted. Stage 3 extended from the i rst to the third century ce; during that stage about 24.57 percent of the Ramayana was written down. Stage 4 extended from the fourth to the twelfth cen-tury ce, and Stage 5 started after 1200 ce . 9 Tulsidas’ Ramayana came into existence during the last stage. It seems that the Mahabharata was composed in Sanskrit between the i fth and the third century bce . 10 B. A. van Nooten says that the Mahabharata represents society as it was around 1400 bce . 11 The Mahabharata is the longest poem in the world, with more than 100,000 verses and seven to eight times the length of the Iliad and Odyssey combined. 12 The core of the Mahabharata is an account of the combat 6 John Brockington, ‘Stereotyped Expressions in the Ramayana ’, in Greg Bailey and Mary Brockington (eds.), Epic Threads: John Brockington on the Sanskrit Epics ( 2000 ; reprint, New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 125. 7 The Ramayana of Valmiki: An Epic of Ancient India , vol. 1, Balakanda , Introduction and tr. by Robert P.

The Kurus were a tribe living along the upper reaches of the Jamuna, and the Pandavas were a com-paratively newly emergent clan based around Indraprastha, about sixty miles southwest of the Kuru capital, Hastinapura. With the passage of time, peripheral stories that provide a social, moral and cosmological background to the climactic battle were added. Both the Ramayana and the Mahabharata portray the actions of the warriors in a heroic and moral context. To an extent, the Mahabharata also represents, writes Nooten, a re-enactment of a moral confrontation at the cosmic level. The Mahabharata is a moral and philosophical as well as an historical tale. Occasionally, the gods interact with the humans, give them weap-ons, inl uence the outcome of battles, make love with the queens, and so on. 13 The great Rig Vedic deities were all anthropomorphic in con-ception (idealized in human and superhuman forms). 14 Similarly, in the Iliad , the gods in human shape interact with humanity and determine the winners and losers in battle. 15 The Bhagavad Gita was composed around 200 bce . 16 Angelika Malinar and Steven J.

The Indus Valley civilization used carts with solid wheels, and in India spoked wheels came into use around 700 bce . 22 Between 1000 BCE and 600 bce , the Aryans moved from north-west India and Punjab to the Ganga-Jamuna doab. 23 The location of the Aryan homeland and the very meaning of the term “Aryan” have generated debate among scholars, and the Aryan question is yet to be resolved. Initially, scholars argued that the Aryans were Sanskrit-speaking people who entered India through the north-western passes around 1500 bce . However, a minority group claims that the Aryans were indigenous to India and identical to the people of the Indus Valley civilization. The Dravidian languages were prevalent in north India prior to Sanskrit, and this tends to support the hypothesis that a Dravidian language was the language of the Indus Valley civilization. The most recent view is that the Aryans did not represent any particular race but was instead a lan-guage group. As this particular language group moved into India and the Aryan-speaking people intermixed with local people, the Aryan language (a variation of the Indo-European language group) absorbed a large num-ber of local Dravidian words. And instead of invasion, scholars are now more comfortable speaking of slow and gradual migration resulting in intermingling of the various communities. 24 Romila Thapar asserts that early vedic society was a lineage society. A lineage meant a corporate group of unilineal kin with a formalized system of authority. It had rights and duties and accepted genealogical relationships as the binding factor. The basic unit in this system was the extended family based on a three- to four-generation lineage controlled by the eldest male, who represented it on both ritual and political occa-sions.

The power of the chiefs during the early vedic age was mostly based on legitimacy through lineage. The later vedic age represented the transi-tion from pastoralism associated with cattle rearing to settled agriculture. Iron technology was essential for clearing the marshlands and monsoon forests of the middle Gangetic Valley. 25 The importance of agriculture is emphasized in the Ramayana as Janaka says: Now one time, as I was plowing a i eld, a girl sprang up behind my plow. I found her as I was clearing the i eld, and she is thus known by the name Sita.... Sprung from the earth, she has been raised as my daughter, and since she was not born from the womb, my daughter has been set apart as one for whom the bride-price is great strength. 26 Sita is the wife of Rama and the tragic heroine of the Ramayana . A number of families constituted a grama , and the gramani was the village headman. A number of gramas constituted a vis (clan). The vispati was the chief of the clan. A number of vis constituted a jana (tribe). The territory that a jana occupied was known as a janapada . The boundar-ies between janapadas were topographical barriers like forests, rivers, streams and hills. 27 The rajan was the leader of the tribe. The rajan’s power was not absolute. 28 Some hymns of the Atharva Veda speak of the election of kings. 29 The terms gopa and gopati (lord of cows) were used for raja , who later came to be called nripati (lord of men). This rel ected the shift from cattle as the principal form of wealth to the rising impor-tance of agricultural labourers required for cultivation. The raja or chief was the successful leader of a raid and, by extension, of a battle. The booty acquired after a successful raid was distributed among the clan, but the distribution was unequal. The priestly families claimed a substantial amount of the booty on the grounds that their rituals ensured success in battle. The heroic ideal was thus comprised of bravery and generosity in gift-giving, which strengthened the raja-purohita alliance, with the two 25 Romila Thapar, From Lineage to State: Social Formations in the Mid-First Millennium BC in the Ganga Valley ( 1984 ; reprint, New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1990), pp. 10, 18, 23, 68. 26 The Ramayana of Valmiki , vol. 1, Balakanda , p. 249. 27 Thapar, From Lineage to State , pp. 30, 34, 47. 28 Majumdar, Military System in Ancient India , pp. 10–11. 29 M.

The Kshatriyas acquired legitimacy from the Brahmins by giving dana (gifts) to the latter. 30 The hymns of Rig Veda expound the evolution of varna (caste) society in vedic India: When they divided the Man, into how many parts did they apportion him? What do they call his mouth, his two arms and thighs and feet? His mouth became the Brahmin; his arms were made into the Warrior, his thighs the People, and from his feet the Servants were born. 31 It is to be noted that the warriors represent the Kshatriyas; the people are the Vaisyas; and the servants refer to the Sudras, the lowest caste, who tilled the land. Nature of Warfare in the Vedic and Epic Ages We do not have any historical chronicle for reconstructing the nature of warfare during the vedic and epic ages. Basically, we have to depend on the epics, which depict awesome battles and gruesome deaths. 32 We must remember that the two epics are not historical texts. They are a mix-ture of ballads, legends and myths along with some elements of historical memory. Brockington says that Valmiki’s Ramayana is not a religious epic. In fact, the Ramayana projects the view that religion is to a great extent a social duty, in keeping with the Kshatriya background. 33 The Ramayana focuses on truth, valour and Kshatriya virtues. Only later did Tulsidas’ Ramayana portray Rama as a religious hero. 34 The sixth kanda of the Ramayana , named Yuddhakanda , describes in detail the combat between Rama’s forces and the raksas (literally meaning ‘demons’, but in the context of the Ramayana ‘non-Aryans’, probably Dravidians). The two epics borrowed from each other. A large proportion of the stereo-typed phrases found in the Yuddhakanda of Ramayana are also found in the Mahabharata . 35 To an extent, the information supplied by the two epics could be supplemented by archaeological i ndings. 30 Thapar, From Lineage to State , pp. 25–6, 63. 31 The Rig Veda: An Anthology, One Hundred and Eight Hymns , selected, tr. and annotated by Wendy Doniger O’ Flaherty (1981; reprint, New Delhi: Penguin, 1994), p. 31. 32 Nooten, ‘Introduction’, pp. xxi–xxii. 33 John Brockington, ‘Religious Attitudes in Valmiki’s Ramayana ’, in Bailey and Brockington (eds.), Epic Threads , pp. 218, 249. 34 John Brockington, ‘ Ramo dharmabhrtam varah ’, in Bailey and Brockington (eds.), Epic Threads , pp. 261, 264. 35 Brockington, ‘Stereotyped Expressions in the Ramayana ’, pp. 99, 121. "},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Vedic and Epic India19 As regards the actual conduct of war during the vedic and epic eras, we have two different interpretations. U. P. Thapliyal is of the view that even in Rig Vedic times, the troops were arrayed in vyuhas (prescribed formations) before being led into war, and that the troops were adept at maneuvers such as attack, encirclement and assault. 36 Thapliyal asserts that the Rig Veda mentions the troops being organized in formations of tens, hundreds and thousands. 37 Thapliyal continues that on the open-ing day of the Mahabharata War, Yudhistira, the eldest brother of the Pandavas, favoured suci-vyuha , which was formed according to the mil-itary thinker Brihaspati’s doctrine. The suci-vyuha was an array suited to a numerically inferior army i ghting a numerically superior enemy. 38 In a somewhat similar vein, Bimal Kanti Majumdar says that a standing army emerged in India around 600 bce . 39 Pradeep P. Barua writes that despite their stage-managed appearance, battles in ancient India were extremely bloody affairs. 40 By contrast, a recent view put forward mostly by Western scholars asserts that ancient Indian warfare was comprised of ‘Flower Wars’. 41 The reality probably lies somewhere between these two extreme viewpoints. Heroic duels abound in the epics. For instance, Parasurama challenges Rama in the following words: ‘If I see that you have strength enough to put an arrow to this bow, then I shall challenge you to single combat, which is praised by men of might.’ 42 Again, Rama kills Ravana, the chief of the raksas and the ruler of Lanka, in single combat. 43 At the same time, the Ramayana speaks of the chaturanga bala (four-limbed army comprising infantry, cavalry, chariots and elephants): ‘He also gave them beautifully adorned and godlike troops, including elephants, horses, chariots, and 36 U.

The advent of the Aryans in India saw the use of iron in warfare, begin-ning around 1000–800 bce . The Aryans’ success against the non-Aryans in the Gangetic basin was primarily due to the use of bows, horse-drawn chariots and iron weapons. 47 The use of iron weapons, asserts Richard A. Gabriel, increased the frequency, scope and intensity of warfare. This is because the tin required to fashion bronze was costly and not easily avail-able. By contrast, large quantities of iron weapons could be produced cheaply, iron deposits being easily accessible. The Assyrian army during the eighth century bce was comprised of about 200,000 men. It was the i rst army in the world to be entirely equipped with iron weapons. 48 Until 1200 bce , Mycenaean war making was undertaken by light-armed skirmishers and missile men who clustered around chariots car-rying men armed with javelins and bows. 49 Between 1200 bce and 750 bce , when the bronze age Mycenaean civilization collapsed – the period of the so-called Dark Age in Greece – warfare consisted of raids against neighbouring lands and coasts conducted by warrior bands under the leadership of local and regional leaders. In Archaic Greece (750–480 bce ), warfare consisted of private and semi-private raids for cattle and booty. Some i ghting also involved contests among the polis (city-states) for control of the fertile borderland. 50 In Archaic Greek warfare, individ-ual bravery mattered a lot; its role declined somewhat during the battles fought in the Hoplite warfare of the Classical Age. 51 Everett L. Wheeler writes that Greek warfare of the Dark Age and Geometric periods was 44 Ibid., vol. 1, Balakanda , p. 263. 45 John Brockington, ‘Fashions in Formulae: Sanskrit Epic Tradition III’, in Bailey and Brockington (eds.), Epic Threads , p. 344. 46 Majumdar, Military System in Ancient India , p. 16. 47 Habib and Thakur, Vedic Age , pp. 43, 88. 48 Richard A.

In the Iliad , we i nd the heroes i ghting by throwing spears at their opponents. 52 The Aryans engaged in warfare in order to acquire captives, land and pasture for their cattle. The accumulation of cattle was known as gov-isthi . Most of the Aryans desired more cows. 53 The Panis were a wealthy non-Aryan tribe who frequently raided the Aryan settlements and carried away their cattle. 54 Among the Aryans, the winner of the cows is known as the gojit , which is an epithet for hero. 55 The Aryans also engaged in inter-tribal warfare. The Dasarajna (Battle of Ten Kings) was an engage-ment fought on the bank of the river Parusni (Ravi). Sudasa, the leader of the Bharata tribe, inl icted a defeat on a confederacy of ten kings. Many of the latter kings came from the north-west region of the subcon-tinent. Sudasa emerged victorious, and the Bharata tribe became predom-inant among the Aryans in India. 56 As regards close-quarter weapons, the Ramayana says of Parasurama: ‘With his battle-axe slung over one shoulder’. 57 Combat in the Battle of Ten Kings (500 bce ?) involved encounters between chariots and foot soldiers equipped with axes, with both parties also trying to alter the course of the river by constructing earthen embankments and cutting channels. 58 Combat in vedic and epic India was not merely a clash between indisci-plined masses that milled around the heroes in rathas . Training of the warriors was carried out in the asramas under the direction of the rishis (warrior sages). 59 The Shiva Dhanurveda (the science of archery) was composed around 600 bce . 60 Both Rama (the Aryan hero of Ramayana ) and Arjuna (the star warrior of the Pandavas in Mahabharata ) wreaked havoc among their enemies with the aid of archery. 61 The mace was the 52 Everett L.

The defenders of Catal Huyuk around 6000 bce used it. 62 Gadas (maces) are mentioned in the Mahabharata . The hymns of the Bhagavad Gita vividly describe the battlei eld of Kurukshetra in all its glory and grandeur just before combat started. The hymns of Rig Veda describe the heroic warrior armed with bow and arrow going to the battlei eld on his ratha (chariot). 63 The bow was made from bamboo, cane or wood. It was composed of a stout staff bent into a curved shape and a bowstring made of a strip of cowhide. During the vedic period, the bowstring was drawn back to the ear, whereas in Homeric Greece the bowstring was drawn to the breast before dischar-ging the arrow. 64 Pachugopal Bhattacharya claims that the Ramayana informs us that Rama used narach (iron arrows) against Ravana, the raksa (non-Aryan, probably Dravidian) ruler of Lanka. 65 In China, during the Western Zhou period (1045–770 BCE), the war-rior elites primarily used bows and arrows. 66 The Assyrians were using composite bows around 2200 bce . The composite bow generated greater power from a shorter draw. Arrows shot from the composite bow were able to penetrate leather armour. The composite bow spread to Palestine around 1800 bce and then into Egypt around 1700 bce . The Egyptian bow had a central wooden core with thin strips of horn and leather lami-nated onto it. Gabriel asserts that the killing power of the composite bow was further enhanced by the Egyptian innovation of placing the archer in a chariot. 67 In the eighteenth century bce , the Mesopotamian states introduced horse-drawn chariots. The Egyptian chariot was constructed of a light wooden frame covered by stretched fabric or hide. The platform that sup-ported the driver and the warrior was made of stretched leather thongs covered with hide. Two horses, held by a central yoke pole, pulled the vehicle. In addition to bows, the warriors also carried axes, spears and quivers i lled with arrows. The Egyptian chariot was mainly a mobile i r-ing platform. 68 By contrast, the Hittite chariot was heavier as it was used 62 Gabriel, Great Armies of Antiquity , p. 51. 63 The Bhagavad Gita , tr. from the Sanskrit with an Introduction by Juan Mascaro (London: Penguin, 1962), p. 3. 64 Pant, Indian Archery , pp. 21, 245. 65 Pachugopal Bhattacharya, Ramayana Yuddhbidhya [in Bengali] (Kolkata: Sanskrit Pustak Bhandar, 1399 ), pp. 34–5, 40–1.

The crew also dismounted and func-tioned as infantry and engaged in close-quarter combat. 70 Around 500 bce , chariots entered China from Mesopotamia through Central Asia. 71 However, Edward L. Shaugnessy asserts that chariots had already entered China from trans-Caucasia around 1200 bce . The horses were fastened to the yoke saddle by leather straps that ran across the neck of the horse and also to its mouth. The harness was joined at the mouth with a bit and cheek pieces, usually made of iron or bone or horn. By the second half of the ninth century bce , China witnessed mass char-iot battles, which also occurred in the Middle and Near East. 72 Chariots were also used in Homeric battles. 73 The Rig Vedic ratha was a two-wheeled vehicle. The body of the ratha was light and consisted of a wooden framework i xed on an axle tree and fastened by cowhide thongs. The pole of the chariot was attached to the middle of the axle, and at the end of the pole was the yoke. The yoke was placed at the neck of the horses. The reins were fastened to the bit in the horse’s mouth. By the fourth century bce , the Aryans on the subcontinent used the bit, but not the curb bit as the suta (chariot driver) directed the horse using a spike outside (i.e., behind the jaw). The suta controlled the horses with the reins and spurred them on with a whip. Initially, solid wheels were used, but gradually wheels with spokes replaced them. The vedic war chariot carried a rathin (warrior) and a suta . 74 Some of the epic war chariots were big, as each of them was pulled by four horses. A l ag-staff was attached to the ratha where the standard of the hero warrior was tied. 75 Unlike the Rig Veda , the Mahabharata describes the use of elephants in warfare. 76 The Yajur Veda (composed between 900 and 800 bce ) describes 69 Doyne Dawson, The First Armies (London: Cassell, 2001 ), p. 122. 70 Gabriel, Great Armies of Antiquity , p. 79. 71 Yates, ‘Early China’, p. 11. 72 Edward L.

And the south Indians were good as swordsmen. 79 The vedic and epic age forces were not all-weather forces. In the Ramayana , autumn and winter are considered the best seasons for cam-paigning. 80 Peter Krentz says that battles conducted by the farmers in Archaic Greece occurred during summer only. 81 The pay of the soldiers was comprised of booty collected from the defeated enemy. 82 We are not sure about the nature of the armour used by the vedic and epic warriors. Ramashankar Tripathi claims that the vedic and epic warriors used coats of mail and metal helmets. 83 By way of comparison, it might be men-tioned that the Celts introduced iron chain mail armour around the third century bce . 84 The Ramayana mentions that Rama’s father, Dasaratha, settled artisans in his kingdom for the purpose of manufacturing weap-ons. And the Mahabharata refers to artisans being supplied with raw materials for manufacturing weapons by the rulers. 85 Communication on the battlei eld was an important aspect of warfare. The dundubhi was used during the vedic period. The Atharva Veda says that it was made of wood and covered with either cowhide or deer skin. The conch came into existence during the later vedic age. 86 The hymns of the Bhagavad Gita note that conch shells and drums were used for signaling purposes on the battlei eld. 87 The battering rams used for overcoming fortii cations came into exis-tence around 2500 bce .

The Assyrians constructed large wooden siege towers, taller than the defen-sive walls, and used archers in the siege towers to provide covering i re for the crews of the battering rams working below. The Assyrians also used scaling ladders to insert assaulting parties across the wall. 88 The Indus Valley civilization’s system of warfare was defensive in nature and relied mostly on fortii cations. 89 Defensive walls were present at various Indus Valley civilization sites (Kot-Diji, Kalibangan, etc.). Sun-dried bricks as well as bricks hardened by i re were used for building the citadel walls. 90 In general, the walls were raised by laying the bricks either in mud or in both mud and gypsum mortar. 91 The Dravidians (the Dasas and Dasyus of the vedic and epic literature) constructed forts consisting of ramparts of hardened earth with palisades and ditches. 92 Some of the forts constructed by non-Aryans inside India were also made of stone and unbaked bricks. 93 The raksas , the enemies of the Aryans (says the Ramayana ) were familiar with urban culture. 94 Canto 58 of Kiskindhakanda of the Ramayana says: ‘On a well known island in the sea, situated at a distance of full one hundred yojanas [eight hun-dred miles] from this shore, lies the lovely city of Lanka, constructed by Viswakarma [the architect of the gods], abounding in wonderful gates of Jambunada [gold found on the banks of the Jammu River] and stately mansions of golden hue with terraces of gold and enclosed by a mas-sive fortii cation wall bright as the sun.’ 95 In contrast to the conduct of land battles, the siege warfare of the Aryans was quite brutal. It involved setting i re to the walls of the enemy forts. The Rig Veda mentions pur charisnu , which means a mobile engine used for assaulting strongholds. It was probably a battering ram. 96 As regards pre-Mauryan warfare in India, Barua claims: ‘These stag-nant battle tactics differed dramatically from the lessons being learned 88 Gabriel, Great Armies of Antiquity , p. 15. 89 Barua, State at War in South Asia , p. 4. 90 Habib, Indus Civilization , pp. 12, 34–5. 91 Tripathi, History of Ancient India , p. 17. 92 Thapliyal, ‘Weapons, Fortii cations and Military Training in Ancient India’, p. 115. 93 Habib and Thakur, Vedic Age , p. 17. 94 Sarkar, Ramayanas , p. 7. 95 Srimad Valmiki-Ramayana (with Sanskrit Text and English Translation ), Part I [ Balakanda, Ayodhaykanda, Aryanyakanda and Kiskindhakanda ] (1969; reprint, Gorakhpur: Gita Press, 2001), verse 19, p. 927. 96 Majumdar, Military System in Ancient India , pp. 17, 19.

Military Ethics in the VEDAS and the epics W. R. Connor writes in the context of early Greek warfare: Military conduct in many cultures is governed by elaborate codes or standards of behaviour; it can also be encoded in another and more interesting sense – as an encapsulation of social roles and values. Such codes may represent rela-tionships within the society and sometimes help resolve conl icts and tensions between social groups or values.... The code was incorporated in a series of unwritten “laws of the Greeks”, widely recognized, although not universally followed. 98 The same assertion, as we will see, could be made in the case of warfare as depicted in the Ramayana and the Mahabharata . In Homer’s Trojan War, ambassadors were traditionally priests, and they were considered to be immune from harm. Battles were followed by the burial of the dead. 99 In Homer, we i nd monomachia (a duel of the champions). The general rule was that heroes would throw spears at each other before closing in for close-quarter combat with swords. 100 Border wars between the polis were also decided by duels among the champions or by duels among a limited number of individuals from both sides. 101 There was continuous tension in Classical Greek warfare as to whether the contest would be an agon (regulated contest) or a polemos (in which each side acted as it saw i t). In response to numer-ous wars and political violence, Isocrates became the chief proponent of Panhellenism, which attempted to limit warfare among the Greeks and to direct aggression against the ‘barbarian’ Persia. Plato in his Republic emphasizes that when i ghting among themselves the Greeks should not 97 Barua, State at War in South Asia , p. 8. 98 W. R.

"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Vedic and Epic India27enslave their defeated opponents and should not hinder the burial of their dead enemies. 102 In Connor’s view, there was a tacit understanding among the polis that ambush and surprise should not be resorted to. Surprise attack ( apate ) was considered deception and thus illegitimate. The hoplite forces of the opposing cities decided where and when to meet and i ght it out. 103 The ethics of war in Judaism emphasize that fruit trees should not be cut during sieges. Norman Solomon rightly says that this norm rel ects not only environmental concern of the besieging army and the besieged but also the prudential motive of not destroying the food resources required by the combatants themselves. 104 In ancient Chinese literature, the concept of yi bing rel ected the notion of just or justii able war. The yi bing concept emerged between the i fth and the second century bce . According to this concept, war is considered necessary and proper as long as it is used by a legitimate ruler to curb violence. And war is resorted to only when a ruler’s policy based on benevolence and justice has failed. 105 Frank A. Kierman Jr. writes that the ancient Chinese military code of con-duct valued restraint and humanity even in the midst of war. 106 By contrast, the political ideology of ancient Egypt represented the inhabitants of the outside world as evil, hostile and cowardly by nature, a constant threat to Egypt and the cosmic order it represented. The supe-riority of the Egyptian polity was emphasized. As a result, warfare was not ritualized. Against outsiders, writes Andrea M. Gnirs, the Egyptians followed the techniques of ‘Total War’, which involved a scorched-earth policy and large-scale deportation of hostile populations. 107 As regards ancient Hindu India, Torkel Brekke asserts that the two epics, Ramayana and Mahabharata , espouse the heroic ideal. He goes on to say that in the Hindu epics there is a lack of clear-cut rules for conducting just war.

On the other hand, the means by which the war is fought (i.e., jus in bello ) is important in the epic worldview because war is the private business of the heroes. The epics do not differentiate between public violence (war proper) and pri-vate duels. In fact, the Mahabharata War is a conglomeration of heroic duels. 109 In the earlier section, we have seen that vedic and epic age warfare was something more complex than heroic duels. And the following discus-sion shows that the ancient Hindu concept of war as regards its causes, courses and consequences is much more complex, involving an amalgam-ation of the public and private spheres, the individual ethos and collec-tive duty simultaneously. Discussions of the ethics of war and peace are found in the Udyogaparva (the i fth book of the Mahabharata ) and the Bhagavad Gita . 110 In the vedic and epic literature, the concept of dharmayuddha (just war or civilized warfare) is elaborated, and some traces of kutayuddha (unjust war) can also be found. The issue of dharmayuddha , writes M. A. Mehendale, depends on both the ends and the means. In general, i ghting against injustice is dharmayuddha . 111 Bhisma, the senior advisor in the court of the Kauravas in the Mahabharata , says that a just cause is based on truth and that this can only lead to victory in war. 112 It could be argued that dharmayuddha is concerned with the just causes for waging war, the just means to be employed while waging war and also with the establishment of a just peace after the war. The Mahabharata classii es warfare into two categories: dharmayuddha and asurayuddha (equivalent to kutayuddha ). The Mahabharata notes the conditions that lead to a dharmayuddha . War is to be resorted to only as a last option, when all the other paths are closed. Initially, the aggrieved party has to go for sama (peaceful conciliation), and then he should try to create bheda (internal dissension) among the enemy camp. Some contingents within 108 T orkel Brekke, ‘Between Prudence and Heroism: Ethics of War in the Hindu Tradition’, in Brekke (ed.), Ethics of War in Asian Civilizations , pp. 113, 115, 119. 109 T orkel Brekke, ‘The Ethics of War and the Concept of War in India and Europe’, NUMEN , vol. 52 (2005), pp. 72–3. 110 Malinar, The Bhagavadgita: Doctrines and Contexts , p. 34. 111 M.

Only then, if the enemy does not turn around, should the option to use danda (force) be considered. 113 Both the Ramayana and the Mahabharata show that war broke out after the aggrieved party failed to negotiate a compromise peace. Rama’s wife, Sita, was abducted by Ravana. Then Rama sent a duta (ambassa-dor) to Ravana requesting that he return Sita. When Ravana refused, Rama decided to invade Lanka. Similarly, Krishna, acting as a duta of the Pandavas, requested that Duryodhana, the chief of the Kauravas, hand over at least i ve villages to the i ve Pandava brothers. Duryodhana refused, and the Pandavas then decided that the only option before them was to i ght it out. 114 To recover the unlawfully usurped kingdom even if it means having recourse to violence and slaying the enemy in battle is an example of dharmayuddha , according to the Mahabharata . 115 Dharmayuddha could also be resorted to for the protection of a kingdom’s subjects. Rama and Bhisma say that the king should take one-sixth of the produce to provide revenue for the purpose of protecting the people under him. 116 Both the Ramayana and the Mahabharata discuss the evils that result if a king fails to protect his subjects properly. 117 The principal duty of the Kshatriyas, in accordance with rajadharma (the duties of the ruler), was to punish the wicked and protect the good, and this policy was controlled, reg-ulated, supported and guided by the Brahmins. It was the duty of the Brahmins to dei ne and interpret dharma (the Hindu code of conduct). And the Kshatriyas had to implement the rules and regulations laid down by the Brahmins in accordance with dharma . 118 Since the Mahabharata was largely composed by Brahmins, the peripheral quasi-historical stories also emphasize the power and glory of the Brahmins. 119 The pursuit of rajadharma (the duties of the king, which involved i ghting) in turn legit-imized the power structure of the Kshatriyas. 120 113 Allen, ‘Just War in the Mahabharata ’, p. 140. 114 Indra, Ideologies of War and Peace in Ancient India (Hoshiarpur: Vishveshvaranand Institute Publications, 1957 ), p. 40. 115 Mehendale, Rel ections on the Mahabharata War , p. 1. 116 C.

Due to the varna system, only the Kshatriyas could bear arms. So Hindu dharma never conceptualized the entire body of people in a Hindu polity as a general levy. 122 By contrast, the armies of the polis could be described as the citizen body under arms. 123 Athenian citizens were liable for military service from the age of eighteen to sixty. 124 Participation in dharmayuddha was coni ned only to the Kshatriyas. In the Ramayana , Rama is considered the best upholder of dharma . 125 For Rama, dharma is truth and one’s duty in life. 126 Dharma is referred to as rita (standing upright) in the vedas . It encompasses all the good actions that are required to support the cosmic order against the evil forces threat-ening that order. 127 The concept of dharma underwent modii cations in the epics. Sita comes up with the doctrine of ahimsa , saying that it is not necessary to attack the raksas . Then Rama explains that his dharma is to protect the Brahmin sages from the depredations of the raksas . 128 Nooten claims that dharma in the Mahabharata is the doctrine of the religious and ethical rights and duties of each individual. At times, dharma might refer to duty as ordained by religion, but it also means simply virtue or right conduct. So one would have caste dharma (in accordance with one’s hereditary occupation), personal dharma (in accordance with one’s age), and so on. 129 Dharma means maintenance of the correct social order (i.e., varna society), and for the Kshatriyas dharma also means maintenance of political stability. 130 Mehendale dei nes dharmayuddha as war fought as a duty ( dharma ) by a Kshatriya. 131 Kshatra means valour. 132 In the vedic age, death on the 121 Thapliyal, ‘Military Organization in the Ancient Period’, p. 89. 122 Majumdar, Military System in Ancient India , pp. 14–15. 123 Matthew F.

The Rig Veda says that a dead war-rior had earned the same merit as the donor of 1,000 cows. 133 Similarly, the Spartans considered it better to die than to retreat in the face of the enemy. 134 Lasting fame and a glorious death in battle, asserts Everett L. Wheeler, represented the epitome of the hoplite ideal in Classical Greece. 135 The Ramayana notes that a king (Kshatriya) has to display the following qualities: i erceness, heroism, gentleness, self-control and purity. 136 However, unnecessary brutality in war was not allowed. It is to be noted that in the Brhadaranyaka Upanishad , the emphasis is on practicing self-restraint and generosity and exhibiting compassion. 137 The Ramayana implies that the heroes, by performing glorious deeds, inl u-enced the chain of events. Lakshmana tells his elder brother Rama that weaklings are ruled by fate, but heroes scorn it and by their heroic actions challenge the inevitability of fate. 138 Let us shift the focus to the Bhagavad Gita in order to expound on the duties of a Kshatriya i ghting a dharmayuddha . The blind king Dhritarashtra (chief of the Kauravas) asks his minister Sanjaya to tell him what is happening on the battlei eld of Kurukshetra. Sanjaya repeats verbatim the dialogue between Krishna (god cum suta of Arjuna) and Arjuna (the most famous warrior on the side of the Pandavas). The dia-logue between Arjuna and Krishna took place on the i rst day of the war, just before combat started. Before the beginning of the battle, Arjuna said to Krishna that he wanted to see all those who had come to i ght. Krishna then drove forward and pulled up the ratha between the two armies. Arjuna then looked forward and saw his kith and kin armed to the teeth, ready to kill and be killed. He was overwhelmed with grief and despair. With tears in his eyes, Arjuna said that fratricide was repugnant to him and that he did not want wealth and kingdom at the cost of killing his kinsmen. Probably, Arjuna was unnerved by the sight. 139 Angelika Malinar states that though the Bhagavad Gita emphasizes disinterested action, the dialogue between Krishna and Arjuna also 133 Thapliyal, ‘Early Indian Heraldry and Ceremonials’, p. 140. 134 W.

In accordance with kulad-harma , Arjuna is not supposed to kill his relatives and clan members who have sided with Duryodhana. But in accordance with kshatriyadharma , Arjuna is supposed to kill the enemies without regard to whether they have any blood relations with him. Duryodhana represents the warriors’ dharma . The Udoygparva of Mahabharata says that he is trying to build himself up as an absolute ruler, high above all the existing family relation-ships. Duryodhana’s loyalty is to his kingdom and kingship and not to kinship. Duryodhana claims for himself the highest possible position, the over-lordship of all human beings on the subcontinent. This is a concept of absolute kingship and resembles the concept of god-king. Malinar and Steven J. Rosen claim that in the context of ancient Indian culture, such absolute kings are not regarded as role models but are depicted as evildo-ers and demonic i gures. Duryodhana is portrayed as the Kali Purusha, the demon Kali in human form. In general, ancient Indian texts push the concept of the king as subordinate to the highest god. Thus, though the king enjoys a special position within the socio-cosmic order, his power is limited. The king becomes the instrument and sign of the god, and ascetic power is also demanded from him. This does not mean that the king renounces the world, but rather that the king must follow the rules of dharma and sastra (Hindu laws) and must see that his subjects also follow these rules. 140 Krishna emphasized Arjuna’s duty as a Kshatriya. A Kshatriya who dies i ghting attains veeraswarga (the Heaven of the Heroes). 141 It should be noted that even if an evil Kshatriya i ghts courageously, he attains heaven. After the war, the Mahabharata tells us, Yudhistira (the eldest of the Pandava brothers) was shocked to learn from God Indra that Duryodhana had attained heaven due to his courageous behaviour on the battlei eld. 142 Further, Krishna emphasized the karma theory (i.e., the laws of action). According to this theory, the soul is immortal. Hence, after the destruc-tion of the body, the soul remains. Thus, nobody dies. While the soul is immortal, the body is transient. Also, one who is born is bound to die one day (i.e., destruction of the body and not the soul) and is bound to 140 Malinar, The Bhagavadgita: Doctrines and Contexts , pp. 226–7, 233; Rosen, Krishnas Song , p. 24. 141 Mohanraj, Warrior and the Charioteer , pp. 63–4. 142 Buck, Mahabharata , p. 367.

The right way of doing karma is to perform one’s duty without thinking about the possible rewards, in order to maintain the social structure. Krishna continues that if Arjuna fought with detachment (i.e., doing his karma ), then he would not be committing any sin. 143 In other words, a Kshatriya i ghts only for a just cause and not for the prospect of any material gain from i ghting or because combat excites his passion. 144 Krishna urges Arjuna to apply buddhi (the faculty of discrimination) as taught in Samkhya philosophy and apply it to yogic practice. Krishna refutes Arjuna’s opinion that non-action, that is, non-violence on the bat-tlei eld, is a sign of insight as a method of ending karmic bondage. A yogin (one who performs yogic practice) achieves self-control, which implies a conquest of cosmological realms and power that culminates in his reach-ing Brahman (cosmic soul). Becoming Brahman means replacement of the individual ego-bound agency with that of Brahman and prakriti (the Samkhya concept of nature). The yogin thus reaches a position where he controls and directs the activities of his cognitive and physical pow-ers without identifying with them and becoming attached. 145 Unlike in the Bhagavad Gita , Plato and Aristotle stipulate that war should always remain instrumental and not an end in itself. 146 Krishna, in the Bhagavad Gita , says: Interwoven in his creation, the Spirit is beyond destruction.... For beyond time he dwells in these bodies, though these bodies have an end in their time; but he remains immeasurable, immortal. Therefore, great warrior, carry on thy i ght. .... As a man leaves an old garment and puts on one that is new, the Spirit leaves his mortal body and then puts on one that is new. 147 .... Think thou also of thy duty and do not waver. There is no greater good for a warrior than to i ght a righteous war. There is a war that opens the doors of heaven, Arjuna!

In this peace there is no sin. 148 However, kutayuddha could be practiced against non-Aryan tribes. Because of ‘racial’ and cultural differences, war between Aryans and non-Aryans was more brutal than conl ict among the Aryans. 149 The Rig Veda tells us that the Aryan war god Indra executed 50,000 members (includ-ing pregnant women) of a non-Aryan tribe. 150 Similarly, the Greeks fol-lowed the rules of warfare while i ghting among themselves but not when they fought the ‘other’, that is, the ‘barbarian’ Persians. The Greek merce-naries under Xenophon resorted to war without rules of conduct against the Persians. 151 Unlike the Mahabharata War, which seemed to be an intra-Aryan war, the Ramayana portrays war against non-Aryans. Even then, com-bat in Ramayana is not totally free of the constraints of military eth-ics. Rama resorted to war against Ravana for a just cause, that is, to regain his wife. 152 The conl ict between Rama and Ravana also contains a moral allegory. It represents the struggle between good and evil. From another angle, the Ramayana represents the spread of Aryan political and cultural domination from north India into peninsular India. The expansion of Aryan culture into peninsular India was the product of cooperation between the Brahmins and the Kshatriyas, who carried the l ag of Aryanization. Amal Sarkar rightly says that the Aryan penetra-tion into south India was the product not of peaceful cultural interaction but of the military exploits of Aryan chieftains. Lanka may be south of Vindhya Mountain (in present-day Madhya Pradesh) or may be Sri Lanka (known as Serandip). The language of the raksas was Andhra (Telegu). 153 148 Bhagavad Gita , tr. by Mascaro, p. 12. 149 Tripathi, History of Ancient India , p. 30. 150 Mohanraj, Warrior and the Charioteer , pp. 45–6. 151 Wheeler, ‘Introduction’, p. xlv. 152 Mehendale, Rel ections on the Mahabharata War , p. 58. 153 Sarkar, Ramayanas , pp. 2, 8–9, 14, 16, 19, 45.

In case of bad omens and at the times of certain festivals, the Spartans aborted expeditions. 159 The Greeks during the Classical Age did not usually pursue the defeated foe. The reason for this was partly ideological and partly tactical. The ideological factor was that it was ungentlemanly to kill l eeing fellow Greeks, and the tactical factor was that if the victorious hoplites broke ranks to pursue the defeated foe, then the former were vulnerable to a counter-attack by the enemy. 160 Even during dharmayuddha among the Aryans, spies were used. Bhisma, in the Mahabharata , asserts that a king should employ spies. The spies should appear as blind and deaf. The spies should be set even against the councilors, princes and subordinate chiefs, both in the capital and in the provinces. 161 The Mahabharata informs us that the news of Arjuna’s vow that he would kill Jayadratha the next day before sunset was brought to the Kauravas by their spies. 162 In several instances during the Mahabharata War, the rules of war were broken by both sides. After the slaying of Jayadratha, the Kaurava gen-eral Drona ordered that the Kaurava army continue to i ght the Pandavas even after sunset.

Those Pandava soldiers who tried to escape from the camp were ambushed by Kripa (Drona’s brother) and Kirtavarman. 163 Krishna’s credo was to win at all cost. Krishna asked Yudhistira (the eldest of the Pandava brothers) to tell Drona that Aswathama had been killed. However, Yudhistira, who was famous for his honesty, refused to tell such an outright lie. An elephant named Aswathama was then killed. Yudhistira then went to Drona and told him that Aswathama the ele-phant had been killed. The exact words used by Yudhistira are as follows: Aswathama hatha, iti nara nahi gaja (Aswathama is dead, but it is an elephant and not a human). However, Krishna managed to have several drums beaten loudly at that moment, and the phrase ‘Aswathama the elephant’ was drowned in the ensuing noise. Drona thought that his son Aswathama had been killed. Totally disheartened, he gave up i ghting. Then Arjuna, on Krishna’s advice, attacked and killed Drona. Krishna also gave unethical advice to Arjuna for killing Karna. During the duel between Arjuna and Karna, the latter’s ratha got stuck. Then Karna left his weapon and struggled to move the wheel of his ratha out of the mud. It was considered unethical to engage an unarmed enemy. However, Krishna advised Arjuna to take advantage of Karna’s vulnerability and kill him. Again, when Duryodhana and Bhima were i ghting with gadas , the former was on the point of winning. Krishna then advised Bhima to attack the former’s thigh. Generally, it was considered unethical to attack an opponent’s thigh. The rules of gadayuddha (combat between two i ghters equipped with maces) noted that an opponent could not be struck below the navel. Bhima followed Krishna’s advice and wounded Duryodhana. 164 Krishna justii ed his actions by arguing that the end justii es the means (an instrumental view of war that is in tune with kutayuddha ). Krishna says that the Pandava’s war against the Kauravas was fought for a just cause. Hence, in order to win such a war, there was no aniti (immoral-ity) involved if a minimum of adharma (unjust techniques) were used. Mehendale says that the Mahabharata shows that, due to the operation of dharma on a cosmic scale, nemesis or retributive justice overtook even Krishna in the end. Krishna was killed accidentally by a hunter. 165 163 Mehendale, Rel ections on the Mahabharata War , pp. 53, 57. 164 Mohanraj, Warrior and the Charioteer , pp. 50–2; Mehendale, Rel ections on the Mahabharata War , p. 40. 165 Mehendale, Rel ections on the Mahabharata War , pp. 45, 57. "},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Vedic and Epic India37 In the Ramayana we also i nd that in order to win a just war, Rama resorted to several unjust measures. In order to defeat the ‘wicked’ Ravana, Rama needed an army. So Rama decided to interfere in the inter-nal affairs of the kingdom of the hanuman s. The literal translation of this term is ‘monkeys’, but in the Ramayana it probably refers to the Dravidians, who were considered by the Aryans to be somewhat lower on the scale of civilization. Even today, in popular usage, an uncultured and rude person is called by the abusive term hanuman . Rama made a pact with Sugriva that while Sugriva was i ghting with his brother, the hanuman king Valin, Rama would ambush the latter. And after the death of Valin, Sugriva would take both Valin’s kingdom and his wife and in return would provide Rama with an army for invading Lanka. 166 Rama, the Aryan chief, used guile and treachery while i ghting Ravana. This is especially evident in the killing of Meghnada (the son of Ravana, also known as Indrajit) by Lakshmana. Rama and Lakshmana occa-sionally waged mantra yuddha (which was characterized by deceit and subterfuge) against the raksas . 167 Simultaneously, Indrajit, Ravana’s son, also used maya (subterfuge), while i ghting Rama and Lakshmana. 168 Mantrayuddha and mayayuddha constitute kutayuddha . Despite the presence of laws, in the heat of battle the Greeks broke them occasionally as well. Mutilation of dead enemy soldiers was com-mon among the Classical Greeks. In the Iliad , we come across the fact that the Greek warriors stabbed Hector’s lifeless body before Achilles dragged it around Troy. Xenophon’s Greeks mutilated the Persians in order to terrify the suviving enemy soldiers. 169 Dharmayuddha also involved construction of a just peace. After the end of the Mahabharata War, Dhritarashtra was deposed and sent to the jungle. He then advised Yudhistira on the establishment of good gover-nance for the maintenance of peace. One of the principles of good gov-ernance, according to Dhritarashtra, was to be mild to the peaceful and harsh towards the wicked. Further, Dhritarashtra advised Yudishtira to send out spies disguised as morons and blind men, 170 in order to get infor-mation about possible rebellious tendencies, which were to be nipped in the bud. And the Ramayana asserts that even after the victory over 166 The Ramayana of Valmiki , vol. 1, Balakanda , p. 10. 167 Sarkar, Ramayanas , pp. 15, 25. 168 Mehendale, Rel ections on the Mahabharata War , p. 63. 169 Lawrence A.

Further, if possible, the victor should put on the throne the descendant of the dead enemy ruler. 172 However, the establishment of a just peace after a just war rel ects the presence of some streaks of impe-rialism. After killing Ravana, Rama put the latter’s brother Bibhisana on the throne of Lanka. The argument is that Lanka is saved from the dep-redations of the tyrant Ravana, and now the people of Lanka will rejoice when placed under the rule of a ‘good’ ruler. However, the underlying imperial logic is also clear. Bibhisana had deserted Ravana early during the war. Bibhisana’s argument was that he was dissatisi ed with the tyr-anny of his brother Ravana. 173 Bibhisana functioned as a client ruler of Rama and accepted the over-lordship of the ruler of Kosala. So Lanka from an independent kingdom was turned into a tributary of a hegemonic Aryan state of north India. At the popular level even today, Bibhisana is regarded as a i fth columnist and as an enemy within the gates. Conclusion The elaborate code of military ethics for limiting the lethality of warfare was present to some degree in most of the civilizations of ancient Eurasia but was probably most developed in ancient Greece and China. Vedic and epic philosophy was not pacii c. Sita’s emphasis on ahimsa is marginal in the overall context of the Ramayana . Interestingly, vedic and epic India did not generate any discussion of the military ethics of siege warfare. Ideas about restraint in warfare develop when i ghting occurs within an ethnic group. The early Aryans were mostly pastoral and not urban dwell-ers. Hence, siege warfare was uncommon during conl icts among the var-ious Aryan tribes. Siege warfare was conducted only against non-Aryans. Hence, there was not adequate motivation for limiting the lethality of siege warfare by establishing elaborate rules and regulations. The varna system, the karma theory and the discussion regarding the establishment of a just peace after a just war are probably the unique contributions of 171 Bhat, ‘Ethical Values in the Ramayana ’, p. 33. 172 Gauri Mahulikar, ‘Ethical Teachings in the Santiparva of the Mahabharata ’, in Archak (ed.), Ethics for Modern Man in Sanskrit Literature , p. 37. 173 Ramayana of Valmiki , vol. 1, Balakanda , Introduction, p. 10.

The varna sys-tem, by emphasizing the carrying of arms as the vocation of a few, limited the scope and intensity of warfare in the vedic and epic ages. And the concept of reincarnation inherent in karma theory not only maintained the varna system but also strengthened the morale of the Kshatriyas on the blood-i lled battlei eld. In contrast to Brekke’s opinion, we have seen that the Ramayana and the Mahabharata consider the just causes for starting a war. In fact, war is to be undertaken only when all attempts to reach a compromise peace fail. Overall, in inter-tribal i ghting, the Aryans conducted symmetrical warfare. The Ramayana and to a greater extent the Mahabharata portray the continuous tension between constructing an elaborate code of conduct for resorting to and waging battle and the breaking of the rules by the principal combatants.

His demilitar-ization policy, it is argued, was far too advanced for his time. Asokan anti- militarism was revived by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi when he practiced ahimsa -oriented satyagraha against the British between 1920s and the 1940s. This chapter attempts to show the historical context that shaped Asoka’s policy of limited violence as propounded in his dhamma . Further, this chapter will try to put Asoka’s dhamma in a cross-cultural comparative perspective. Asoka certainly broke out of the ‘realist’ kut-ayuddha tradition, but he was neither a visionary nor an ideologue but rather a pragmatist who attempted to consolidate his empire using mini-mum force. Neither Buddhism nor Asoka’s ahimsa was the equivalent of Gandhi’s non-violent struggle against the British during the i rst half of the twentieth century. The Rise of Buddhism and Jainism When Buddhism and Jainism emerged on the subcontinent, there were sixteen great mahajanapadas . They were Kasi (Benaras), Kosala (Gonda region), Anga (eastern Bihar), Magadha (central Bihar), Vajji, Malla, Cedi (Bundelkhand), Vatsa (Allahabad), Kuru (Delhi region), Pancala (Rohilkhand), Matsya (Jaipur), Surasena (Mathura), Assaka (Godavari region), Avanti (western Malwa), Gandhara with its capital at Taxila (eastern Afghanistan), and Kamboja (north-west frontier province of "},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Buddhism, Jainism and Asokas Ahimsa41Pakistan). Of these mahajanapadas , Magadha was on the point of becom-ing dominant and the core of a north Indian empire that was to emerge in the fourth century bce . 1 Initially, Buddhism began as a schismatic movement against the ortho-dox brahmanical outlook. To a great extent, Buddhism was a protest against the various malpractices that had crept into Hindu ritual and thought. The latter development, argued the Buddhists, was due to the increasing power of the Brahmins. The artisans and the traders known as setthis constituted a great proportion of the populace of the cities – Kausambi (near Allahabad), Sravasti, and others – and they supported Buddhism. The Buddhist sanghas (assemblies) were supported by the trad-ers and merchants. The commercial class provided support to Buddhism because, in accordance with strict brahmanical orthodoxy, the traders and merchants, despite possessing economic wealth, were regarded as social and cultural inferiors to the Brahmins and the Kshatriyas. Both Mahavira and Buddha challenged the hereditary caste system. And unlike brahman-ism, Buddhism encouraged sea voyages, which the merchants engaged in overseas trade undertook frequently. 2 Loans and debts were taken on interest. At times letters of credit functioned as substitutes for money. The Gautama dharmasutra prescribes a limit on the interest chargeable by the creditor. The lawful limit was 1.25 percent per month or 15 percent per year. The interest could not exceed the principal, however long the debt remained unpaid. Again, in Buddhism, the interests of the creditors and the moneylenders were protected, and the debtors were reminded of their obligations. By contrast, the brahmanical lawgivers despised the money-lenders. The emphasis on truth, justice, honesty, and so on, present in the Buddhist system supported the concept of private individual property. Such ethics suited the activities of the traders and moneylenders. 3 Sacrii ce was an integral part of the brahmanical system. 4 The Buddhist critique of Brahmin-mediated sacrii ces suited the mentality of the proi t- 1 Ramashankar Tripathi, History of Ancient India ( 1942 ; reprint, New Delhi: Motilal Banarasidas, 1999), pp. 82–5. 2 Romila Thapar, Asoka and the Decline of the Mauryas ( 1963 ; reprint, New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1989), pp. 140–1; R.

The latter occupation was considered blameworthy by the ahimsa preachers, and this justii ed the subjugation of the forest dwellers at the hands of the expanding rural peasant society. Thus, the rural gahapatis (householders) found the ahimsa of Buddhism, and to an extent that of Jainism, attract-ive. 6 Again, the brahmanical rituals involved killing as many as 600 bulls at a time for a particular yagna. The vedic religious philosophies, writes R. S. Sharma, did not suit the newly established plough agriculture, which was dependent on animal husbandry. By contrast, the Buddhist emphasis on non-injury to animals was attractive to the practitioners of plough agriculture. The Pali canons stressed non-violence towards animals rather than towards men. The early Buddhist text Sutta-nipata states that cattle should be protected because they provide annada , vannada and sukhada (food, beauty and happiness/peace). 7 At least some streams within the brahmanical tradition also opposed the unnecessary waste of animal lives. For instance, the Chandogya Upanishad points out the importance of not killing any living creature unnecessarily. 8 So Buddhism and Jainism probably derived some ideas from these brahmanical strands. Mahavira was born around 550 bce and died around 480 bce , while Buddha (Gautama/Siddhartha) was born roughly around 480 bce . According to another tradition, Buddha was born about 560 bce and died around 486/484 bce . 9 He left his wife and son and became a wan-dering ascetic. Buddha i rst sought enlightenment in Hindu philosophy and then in ruthless asceticism. Neither brought him liberation. Then he sat for meditation under the Pipal tree (later known as Bodhi tree or tree of wisdom) on the outskirts of the town of Gaya in Magadha and found enlightenment. 10 Buddha preached for over forty years. He spent his last 5 Burton Stein, A History of India ( 1998 ; reprint, New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 2004), pp. 74–5. 6 Krishna Mohan Shrimali, A Peoples History of India, 3A, The Age of Iron and the Religious Revolution, c. 700–c. 350 BC (New Delhi: Tulika, 2007 ), pp. 138–9. 7 Sharma, ‘Material Background of the Origin of Buddhism’, p. 43. 8 Laurie L.

The First Council was held just after the death of Buddha, and between that time and the death of Asoka, two more councils were held. King Ajatasatru of Magadha (accession to kingship 491 bce ) gave patronage to the First Council, which was held at Rajagriha and attended by 500 bhikkus . 13 During the First Council, while some leading brethren expounded the dhamma , other monks repeated their formulations. This was the beginning of the system of bhanakas (reciters), which has been instrumental in the making of the Buddhist (Pali) canon. The Second Council was held at Vaishali about 100 years after the First Council. The Third Council was held at Pataliputra and pre-sided over by a monk named Moggaliputta Tissa. The division between Theravada and Mahayana Buddhism occurred during the early centuries of the Christian era. 14 The term ‘Theravada’ means ‘School of Elders’. Thera means elder; stha means to stand over; and vada refers to theory, doctrine or school. 15 In the Buddhist tradition, dhamma refers to Buddha’s doctrine and teaching. 16 Buddha’s philosophy is the middle way between rigorous asceticism involving mortii cation of the l esh, as propounded by a branch of Jainism, and the extreme sensuality of the Carvakas (a branch of materialist philosophy that gave rise to the realist kutayuddha tradi-tion). Buddhism lays stress on service on behalf of others in order to help them to escape the endless cycles of rebirth. 17 Buddhism placed the incul-cation of ethical values on a high practical pedestal. 18 Buddha advised his disciples to work for the welfare of society. The attempt to work for the welfare of society is embedded in the Buddhist concept of karuna (com-passion). It is the sentiment that inclines one to help those who are in 11 Shrimali, The Age of Iron and the Religious Revolution , p. 125. 12 Mahinda Deegalle, Popularizing Buddhism: Preaching as Performance in Sri Lanka (New York: State University of New York Press, 2006 ), p. 24. 13 Shrimali, The Age of Iron and the Religious Revolution , p. 132; Jain, Lord Mahavira and His Times , p. 75. 14 Shrimali, The Age of Iron and the Religious Revolution , pp. 132–4. 15 Deegalle, Popularizing Buddhism , p. 189. 16 Irfan Habib and Vivekanand Jha, A Peoples History of India , vol. 4, Mauryan India (New Delhi: Tulika Books, 2004 ), p. 63. 17 Ferguson, War and Peace in the World Religions , p. 42. 18 Shrimali, The Age of Iron and the Religious Revolution , p. 130.

According to one story, Buddha intervened when the Sakyas and the Koliyas were i ghting and persuaded them to hold dip-lomatic parleys. The Dhammapada , an early collection of Buddhist verse, notes that enmity can never be appeased by enmity but only by non-enmity. This is the eternal law. Secondly, victory breeds hatred. Calmness and happiness require giving up thoughts of victory and defeat. 21 Rupert Gethin claims that even within the Buddhist framework of dhamma , limited violence is allowed in certain contexts. The advice to rulers is to pass judgement not in haste or anger but appropriately, so that the punishment i ts the crime. If war is necessary, then care should be taken to minimize and contain the acts of violence. Buddhism accepted the idea that the duties of the king involved the implementation of a lim-ited amount of violence for the purpose of deterring external enemies and to maintain law and order in the society. Even when violence on the part of the king becomes necessary, his mind must still be motivated by aversion. 22 The person killing must act out of compassion and charity, so that inner peace is not disturbed. Another argument within Buddhism is that since destiny is pre-determined, it is no sin to put someone to death. 23 One sutta notes that someone who kills another person is not neces-sarily reborn in hell. In fact, at times, a soldier might be reborn in the heavenly realm. This point seems to be taken from the Bhagavad Gita . In the Pali commentaries, the victim’s lack of virtuous qualities dimin-ishes the burden of killing on the part of the person who kills. 24 In one story from the Mahaparinirvana Sutra of Mahayana Buddhism, Buddha is said to have encouraged his followers to take up arms in defence of the Buddhist Order. Having recourse to violence in order to protect the doctrine against aggressors is acceptable in the Buddhist framework. At times, it is necessary to kill one in order to save two or more persons. 25 It seems that Buddhism could justify defensive warfare, which can be cate-gorized as a sort of dharmayuddha . 19 Deegalle, Popularizing Buddhism , p. 24. 20 Ferguson, War and Peace in the World Religions , p. 46. 21 Shrimali, The Age of Iron and the Religious Revolution , pp. 130–1. 22 Rupert Gethin, ‘Buddhist Monks, Buddhist Kings, Buddhist Violence: On the Early Buddhist Attitude to Violence’, in Hinnells and King (eds.), Religion and Violence in South Asia , pp. 71–3. 23 Ferguson, War and Peace in the World Religions , p. 56. 24 Gethin, ‘Buddhist Monks, Buddhist Kings, Buddhist Violence’, p. 77. 25 Ferguson, War and Peace in the World Religions , p. 55. "},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Buddhism, Jainism and Asokas Ahimsa45 According to one view, Mahavira was not the founder of the Jaina religious system. He was the twenty-fourth and last tirthankara of the Jaina faith. The other important tirthankaras were Rishbhanatha and Arishtanemi. Their names appear in the Rig Veda . The twenty-third tirthankara was Parshvanatha/Parsva, who came some 250 years before Mahavira. 26 According to one tradition, under Parasva (877–777 bce ), the kings of Gandhara, Videha, Pancala, Vidharbha and Kalinga accepted Jainism. 27 Mahavira’s childhood name was Vardhamana. He was the son of Siddhartha (not to be confused with Gotama or Gautama Buddha), a chief of the clan associated with the Lichchavis of Vaishali (Bihar). Vardhamana, like Buddha, left home at the age of thirty, leav-ing his wife and daughter behind him. He moved with the ascetic group called nirganthas (free from bonds). He was with them for twelve years. In the thirteenth year, Vardhamana became Jina (the conqueror). For thirty years he taught and journeyed. He starved himself to death at the age of seventy-two in the town of Pava near the Magadhan capital of Rajagriha. 28 Had Mahavira insisted on rigorous asceticism on the part of all his followers, then Jainism would have become the religion of a microscopic minority. Mahavira’s Third Order was comprised of numerous laymen. Sankha Sataka headed this order. These laymen were householders who could not actually renounce the world, but they could at least observe i ve small vows called anuvrata . The similarity of their religious duties, not in kind but in degree, resulted in a close union between the laymen and the monks. Most of the regulations meant to govern the conduct of the lay-men were apparently intended to make them participate, to an extent and for some time, in the merits and benei ts of monastic life without obliging them to renounce the world altogether. 29 Paul Dundas asserts that world renunciation of the sort followed by the Jains and the Buddhists was an institution that entailed not so much as the abandonment of social ties for a career of mendicant quietism as an entry into a heroic way of life that involved raiding and plunder-ing and the purii catory practice of celibacy by the Kshatriyas, at least in north India during the seventh and sixth centuries bce .

This is elucidated clearly in the Uttaradhyayana Sutra , a text composed around the third century bce . The Bhagavati Sutra , composed at the beginning of the Common Era, does not condemn war. This text makes clear that going to war when commanded by one’s leader is obligatory. However, when going to war it is necessary for soldiers to observe Jain values. 32 A Jain Digambara monk founded the Hoysala Dynasty in the twelfth century in Karnataka and recommended a defensive form of violence. The Digambara sect of Jains, which l ourished in early medieval south India, preached that a warrior who died in battle became a true Jain ascetic. Medieval Jain poetry extolled heroic action and compared the heroism of the warrior to that of the ascetic striving monk. 33 Robert J. Zydenbos writes that Jainism accepted the idea that for lay people, who are involved in the working of day-to-day life, some himsa is unavoidable. If the attitude of the person is right, then such himsa is considered accidental and will have a minimal karmic effect on him. So himsa with proper self-control is acceptable, but not any violent act that is premeditated. Somewhat like the Bhagavad Gita , the Jain doctrine assures the lay follower that if violence is associated with his or her occu-pation, and if such acts are carried out dispassionately with a sense of inner detachment, then the person can still be a good Jain. But violence inspired by self-interest leads to evil and darkness. Zydenbos concludes that ahimsa is not a goal in itself. It is a way of manipulating the l ow and working of karma . Ahimsa is a persuasive device in Jainism. The objec-tive is to cultivate restraint, conscious self-control, in order to improve the overall conduct of the people. 34 30 Paul Dundas, ‘The Non-Violence of Violence: Jain Perspectives on Warfare, Asceticism and Worship’, in Hinnells and King (eds.), Religion and Violence in South Asia , pp. 42–3. 31 Robert J.

"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Buddhism, Jainism and Asokas Ahimsa47 A similar strand of thought for the purpose of limiting violence emerged in ancient China. Confucius lived from 551 to 479 bce . The Confucian emphasis on benevolence functioned as a corrective to the self-destructive brutality of the Legalists. The Legalists focussed on inl exible bureaucratic regimentation. Confucius claimed that government should be based on the benevolent sentiments of educated gentlemen, while the Legalists derided benevolence. Confucius accepted the existence of armed forces and the necessity that rulers would occasionally have to use them. The three essentials of a state for him are food, the coni dence of the peo-ple and the soldiers. 35 Confucian thought probably emerged in reaction to the indiscriminate and continuous violence of the Warring States Era (403–221 bce ). Buddhism and Jainism both emphasize ahimsa , each in its own way. Ahimsa is connected to sacrii ce in the Chandogya Upanishad . Ahimsa is equated with tapas (austerity), danam (generosity/gift), daksina (sacrii -cial gifts), truthfulness and integrity. 36 In Buddhism and Jainism, ahimsa retains the other qualities presented in the Chandogya Upanishad but is otherwise completely delinked from sacrii ce. The ahimsa of Jainism and Buddhism should not be confused with passive non-violence, which Gandhi followed between the 1920s and the 1940s. 37 Now, let us see how Buddhism operated in practice under its greatest practitioner, Asoka. Asoka’s DHAMMA As far as governance was concerned, Romila Thapar rightly says that there were two options before Asoka. One option was ruthless control of the subject populace with the aid of the army, self-deii cation of the emperor, and so on, as practiced by Asoka’s near-contemporary Emperor Huang-Ti in China. The other option was that of the king declaring him-self in favour of a new belief, an eclectic collection of views from varying groups; the dominance of other groups could thus be undermined, and the central authority could increase its power and sway. Asoka followed the second policy, and such a policy was also followed by the Mughal Emperor Akbar 1,800 years later, when the latter introduced Din-i-Ilahi . 38 In fact, it could be argued that Asoka, like Plato (427–347 bce ), was no 35 Thomas M.

"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Hinduism and the Ethics of Warfare in South Asia48pacii st, although both believed that politics and philosophy should be pursued for the sake of peace and not war. 39 Asoka assumed that the adoption of a new faith and its propagation through the state apparatus would produce some sort of ideological unity among the various cultural groups that inhabited his empire. A new reli-gion could be used as an emblem or symbol of a new unity, and it could be an effective means of propaganda. Thus, such a measure would aid in the consolidation of the Mauryan Empire. Asoka emphasized good com-munication not only for the purpose of quickly transferring military assets during times of trouble and for encouraging trade and commerce, but also for the propagation and ini ltration of his dhamma . 40 The Uttarapatha (northern road) extended from Bengal to Taxila; another road branched from the juncture of the Ganga and Jamuna rivers and continued to the Narmada basin and from there to the Arabian seaport of Broach in Gujarat in west India. The Dakshinapatha (southern road) branched southward from Ujjain to the provincial capital of Suvarnagiri. 41 Asoka included his message – i.e., his dhamma – in the various rock and pillar edicts that he constructed in different parts of his empire. Some sort of ceremonial, con-gregational reading of the edicts on certain occasions, either in select gath-erings comprised of high-level Mauryan bureaucrats or in larger gatherings in which the state’s ofi cials played an important role, was common during Asoka’s reign. His rock and pillar edicts are somewhat similar to the pillar edicts of Darius. For instance, the polished nature of the Mauryan and Achaemenid pillars and the use of certain common sculptural motifs, such as the lotus, was to an extent a product of cultural interaction between India and Iran. However, there is a difference. While Darius’s pillars prop-agated military victories and the military might of the Achaemenid mon-arch, Asoka’s rock and pillar edicts portray his quasi-benevolent message of a ‘caring’ emperor. In other words, while Darius’s pillars portray a king-ship that was martial in nature, the Asokan pillars portray a kingship that was moral and didactic in nature. Upinder Singh points out the Buddhist inl uence on the Asokan pillars. In her eyes, the lion emblem included in the Asokan pillars is a motif taken from Buddhism. 42 39 Gregory M.

John Ferguson rightly says that there is no evidence of any account of nirvana or the Four Noble Truths or the Eightfold Path in the edicts of Asoka. 44 Krishna Mohan Shrimali points out that though the Third Buddhist Council was held during the reign of Asoka (270–34 bce ), the emperor’s edict does not mention it. 45 Andre Wink notes that as far as the formulation of Asoka’s policies was concerned, the Buddhist sanghas remained passive, and the emperor had no Buddhist religious advisors. 46 Further, Asoka also patronized other religious orders like the Ajivikas. 47 Asoka’s dhamma was an amalgamation of ideas from different religions including Buddhism, Jainism, and others. Dhamma is the Prakrit equivalent of the Sanskrit word dharma . 48 The term dhamma in Asoka’s paradigm refers not to religion but to sacred and i lial duties plus ethical values. 49 D. N. Jha writes that dhamma is an ethical code aimed at fostering an attitude of social responsibility among the people. One of the basic principles of dhamma is toleration. 50 Asoka proclaimed religious toleration. 51 This was necessary to prevent religious strife among the various sects. As a point of comparison, it could be said that to a great extent, the Western Roman Empire was brought to ruin by continuous conl ict between the various sects of Christianity and between Christians and pagans. 52 Asoka exhorts his subjects to avoid anger and killing and injuring human beings and animals. 53 The Second Minor Rock Edict urges compassion towards and avoidance of injury to living beings.

It says that the important virtues on which the gov-ernment should rely are benevolence, righteousness, faith, trust, loyalty and wisdom. 55 The Ssu-ma Fa notes: ‘In general, with regard to the people: rescue them with benevolence; engage them in battle with righ-teousness; make decisions through wisdom ... exercise sole authority through credibility.... Thus the mind must embody benevolence and actions should incorporate righteousness.’ 56 Megasthenes, the Greek ambassador to the Maurya capital at Pataliputra, tells us that the Mauryas practiced a form of limited or just warfare. Even when battles raged between two armies, the peasants in the vicinity of the battlei eld continued to cultivate their land, and the soldiers were strictly instructed not to molest the peasants. 57 However, the Kalinga (Orissa) expedition (262 bce ) 58 was an exception. Kalinga rebelled during the later part of Bindusara’s (the father of Asoka) reign. Asoka conquered Kalinga because this region bred war elephants. Further, he wished to secure the trade route to central and south India, and to reconquer a territory that had rebelled against the imperial gov-ernment. 59 The inability to recover lost territory would have encouraged further rebellions. About 150,000 people were deported from Kalinga after the war. 60 In the Thirteenth Major Rock Edict, Asoka speaks of his remorse at the death of over 100,000 people as a result of the military campaign and bemoans the sufferings caused by war. 61 In the dialogues between Socrates and Alcibiades, which are authored by Plato, Socrates’ message is that warfare cannot be judged in isolation from the issue of justice. And the preservation of virtue stands above the purely physical results of war.

T’ai Kung notes that the ruler, and by implication all the members of the government, should intensively cultivate univer-sally acknowledged virtues like benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, cred-ibility, sincerity, wisdom and so on. 65 Socrates views true courage as pursuing the right course in spite of unwanted consequences. Socrates goes on to say that waging war against those who act justly is unlawful. 66 In the Thirteenth Rock Edict, Asoka says that there should be no more territorial conquests and that his descendants should also abjure conquest by arms. However, being a realist, write Irfan Habib and Vivekanand Jha, he does not make the ban on conquest by arms absolute. If conquest by arms becomes nec-essary, it should be undertaken with mildness and light punishment. 67 Asoka speaks of conquest by means of dhamma as opposed to military violence. Immanuel Kant’s Perpetual Peace (1795) aspires to an ideal and views peace as a moral objective. 68 Asoka, somewhat like Rousseau and Kant, seems to have believed that war is antithetical to the rational order of the polities. 69 Asoka – despite his emphasis on ahimsa , derived from Buddhism and Jainism – did not disband his large army. Asoka may not have engaged in any further military adventures after the conquest of Kalinga, but the army remained the principal instrument for deterring enemies, both inside and outside the frontiers of the Mauryan Empire. Nor did Asoka emphasize general disarmament. Soldiers occupied an important place in the Maurya society. Megasthenes tells us that Indian society was divided into seven classes, of which soldiers constituted one of the most important. 70 Military power remains the last option for pac-ii cation, if persuasion fails. 71 63 Reichberg, Syse and Begby (eds.), The Ethics of War , p. 23. 64 Habib and Jha, Mauryan India , p. 65. 65 The Seven Military Classics of Ancient China , p. 32. 66 Syse, ‘Plato, Thucydides, and the Education of Alcibiades’, pp. 294–5. 67 Habib and Jha, Mauryan India , p. 82. 68 Hew Strachan, Clausewitzs On War: A Biography (New York: Atlantic Monthly Press, 2007 ), p. 90. 69 Julian Reid, ‘Foucault on Clausewitz: Conceptualizing the Relationship between War and Power’, Alternatives , vol. 28, no. 1 (2003), p. 10. 70 Thapar, The Mauryas Revisited , p. 33. 71 Habib and Jha, Mauryan India , p. 82.

If he fails to rule justly, then the wheel (the symbol of royalty) sinks to the ground and disappears. 72 The cakravartin is the moral center of the political world, and the ruler is seen as regulating the wheel of righteousness. 73 The symbols accompa-nying the image of the cakravartin are known as the seven jewels and consist of the wheel – signifying universal power – the goddess of for-tune, the queen, the yuvaraj (crown prince), mantra (minister), imperial hasti (elephants) and asva (horse). The Buddhist and Jain concept of cakravartin was an integral part of Asoka’s dhamma . The cakravartin is regarded as a universal emperor whose dominion included the whole of Jambudipa (the subcontinent). Such a ruler is just, and his reign is prosperous. He is so virtuous that he is regarded as having the power of divinity. 74 Asoka rejected or modii ed certain elements of Buddhism while formulating his dhamma . Early Buddhism preached the theory of Mahasammatta , the Great Elect, a contractual theory based on an agree-ment between the population and the person whom they elect as king. The king was regarded as serving the state, the collection of taxes being his due. In his edicts, Asoka did not regard himself as the Great Elect in his relations with his subjects, but rather portrayed himself as a father-i gure. He stressed the father-child relationship between the king and the populace. The monarch was portrayed as a powerful paternal benefactor and not as the servant of the state. This paternal attitude was a new fea-ture of kingship and replaced the Mahasammatta theory, rel ecting the trend in governance towards centralization. 75 The paternal concept of kingship becomes more rigid and elaborate in Kautilya’s Arthasastra and Kamandaka’s Nitisara . T’ai Kung in China emerges as a strong proponent of the doctrine of the benevolent ruler, with its consequent administrative emphasis on the people’s welfare. Wei Liao-tzu, in a book composed around the fourth century bce , writes that the policies of the king must be directed towards aiding and sustaining the people rather than towards self-aggrandizement and the glorious exercise of power. Confucius (551–479 bce ) in his Analects demands courage and resoluteness in the practice of 72 Thapar, The Mauryas Revisited , pp. 17–18. 73 Stein, A History of India , p. 81. 74 Thapar, Asoka and the Decline of the Mauryas , p. 146. 75 Ibid., p. 147.

Warfare is considered inappropriate for civilized men. 76 According to Confucian thought, which became the state philosophy under the Former Han Dynasty (206 bce –8 ce ), the ruler need only cul-tivate his virtue and implement benevolent policies. 77 Asoka’s dhamma ’s emphasis on the welfare of the subjects was related to the Buddhist idea that serving others secures one’s path to salvation. 78 In addition, there were instrumental reasons for pushing the welfare concept in the dhamma . Asoka realized that his centralized monarchy would be strengthened if the subjects’ welfare at all levels was attended to by the monarch, in particular, and by the state in general. In one of his edicts, Asoka speaks of the welfare of the state’s prisoners. Prison was con-sidered not as a house of torture and terror but as a reformatory (quite a modern concept). Until the prisoner was released, his family was cared for by the state. 79 However, Asoka never banned capital punishment. In the Thirteenth Rock Edict, he exhorts the forest dwellers to behave prop-erly so that they do not have to be killed. The same rock edict says that obedience to persons placed above oneself is a crucial part of dhamma . As regards internal pacii cation, in the Fourth Pillar Edict, Asoka says that if any of his subjects breaks dhamma , that person sins against other persons and needs to be punished. In such a scenario, the rajukas should exercise samata (moderation) when awarding punishment. 80 The Sixteenth Rock Edict notes: ‘An ofi cer fails to act impartially owing to the following dis-positions, viz., jealousy, anger, cruelty, hastiness, want of perseverance, laziness and fatigue.... The root of the complete success of an ofi cer lies in the absence of anger and avoidance of hastiness.’ 81 76 The Seven Military Classics of Ancient China , pp. 31, 232–3, 377–8. 77 The Seven Military Classics of Ancient China , General Introduction and Historical Background, p. 2. 78 Ferguson, War and Peace in the World Religions , p. 45. 79 Thapar, Asoka and the Decline of the Mauryas , p. 156. 80 Habib and Jha, Mauryan India , pp. 64, 77–8. I differ from Irfan Habib and Vivekanand Jha in translating samata as “equity.” There is no equivalent word in English for samata . Samata is somewhat equivalent to Khama in Bengali (which is derived from the Sanskrit Kshama ), which means at least partial pardon for committing an offence. This con-cept is in contrast to the harsh punishment advocated by the Legalist School and the Arthasastra . In my understanding, samata means maintaining benevolence and tolera-tion while punishing the sinner. It is an attempt to establish punishment in proportion to the crime committed under specii c conditions rather than relying on rigid adherence to abstract rules. The objective is to punish the sin and not the sinner. This is the idea that M. K. Gandhi later followed. The underlying idea is: ‘To err is human/normal; partial forgiveness is divine’. 81 D. C.

"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Hinduism and the Ethics of Warfare in South Asia54 These measures are in accordance with the Buddhist ideal of maintain-ing a balance between sin and punishment. Lambert Schmithausen notes that Asoka became a Buddhist lay follower. Not only Asoka, but before him Ajatasatru was also inl uenced by Buddhism. Schmithausen continues that it is possible to an extent to reconcile the Buddhist emphasis on ahimsa with good governance. Buddha did not apply ahimsa to the specii c situ-ation of a king or to the case of an invasion. Defensive military measures are allowed to an extent. One Buddhist text notes that soldiers are asked not to retreat but are warned not to kill indiscriminately. Schmithausen says that according to the Buddhist cakravartin ideal, neighbouring kings should submit to the righteous ruler. Here, Buddhism is probably referring to what modern-day international theorists call deterrence. The implica-tion is that if these kings do not submit, then the righteous ruler is justii ed in attacking and subduing them. If deterrence fails, then military attacks are allowed. Overall, it is left to the ruler to decide whether and to what extent the concept of non-violence is to be applied in the domain of poli-tics (i.e., public violence, like warfare and capital punishment). The war-rior is to observe the Buddhist norms wherever they do not conl ict with his specii c duties as a ruler. In case a warrior has to indulge in limited warfare, he can compensate for his sin through lavish donations to the Buddhist order. In fact, one text notes that it is a sin for a good ruler not to censure, punish or exile those who deserve it. Milindapanha notes that corporal punishment should be applied to thieves because they deserve it owing to their bad karma . The Mahayana and Vajrayana texts view the killing of ‘bad’ persons as compassionate. 82 This trend of justifying the use of minimal violence for good governance is also in line with Confucianism. Mencius (371–289 bce ), the second great Confucian, advocated punitive military expeditions to chastize evil rulers and relieve the people’s sufferings. Hsun-tzu, a Confucian of the late Warring States era, wrote about the inescapable necessity of armies and warfare. 83 The concept of aggressive expansion was inherent in brahmanical ideology, with the central role of sacrii cial rituals like the asvamedha and rajasuya ceremonies eulogizing wars of aggrandizement. Buddhism, by contrast, eulogized the role of dharmaraja , which made such rit-uals irrelevant. 84 In accordance with the principles of dhamma , Asoka 82 Lambert Schmithausen, ‘Aspects of the Buddhist Attitude towards War’, in Houben and Van Kooji (eds.), Violence Denied , pp. 50–9. 83 The Seven Military Classics of Ancient China , pp. 2, 378. 84 Thapar, The Mauryas Revisited , p. 17.

Both the Roman Emperor Constantine and the Mauryan Emperor Asoka used religion for political purposes. Asoka’s dhamma and Constantine’s Christianity forbade sacrii ces at home and festive meetings and gatherings, rel ecting the fear that such reli-gious gatherings might transform themselves into politically subversive groups. 85 In two rock edicts, Asoka says that the inhabitants of his empire are like his children and that he would strive for their welfare just as he would for his own siblings’. Asoka’s public welfare measures involved providing medical assistance and other sorts of relief for the travellers and animals on the roads. 86 He constructed rest houses and veterinary establishments. 87 The Buddhist monks studied medical lore and treated fellow monks and laymen. Buddha himself is called mahabhisaja , that is, the great physician. 88 Asoka ordered the digging of wells and planting of trees along the roads. 89 Asoka appointed a special class of ofi cers known as dhamma maha-mattas . Superi cially, they were supposed to attend to the welfare of the subjects and to bring about an ini ltration of dhamma into all levels of the society. In reality, they were organs of surveillance. They had the power to enter the homes of people of all classes of society, even mem-bers of the royal family and their relatives. With the passage of time, the power of the dhamma mahamattas to interfere in the lives of the people increased. These ofi cials operated not only in the heart of the empire but also in the distant frontier regions and among neighbouring peoples (of the vassal states). The dhamma mahamattas worked among both religious communities and secular groups. Besides the dhamma maha-mattas , Asoka had another class of ofi cers known as pativedikas who bought news of the people to the monarch. 90 The Sixth Rock Edict tells us that Asoka appointed pativedakas (reporters) who would report to him about conditions among the people. The Third Rock Edict and First Rock Edict inform us that ofi cials were ordered to make tours of inspection every three to i ve years. 91 One could surmise that the pativedakas also 85 Thapar, Asoka and the Decline of the Mauryas , pp. 145, 151; Jha, Early India , p. 111. 86 Habib and Jha, Mauryan India , pp. 76, 80. 87 Ferguson, War and Peace in the World Religions , p. 51. 88 Shrimali, The Age of Iron and the Religious Revolution , p. 130. 89 Habib and Jha, Mauryan India , p. 35. 90 Thapar, Asoka and the Decline of the Mauryas , pp. 156–8. 91 Habib and Jha, Mauryan India , p. 35.

Kautilya Arthasastra also put forward the scheme that the vijigishu should made use of monks, religious mendicants and nuns plus professional spies as chara s. Asoka also started the practice of dhamma yatras . He toured the country for the furtherance of dhamma and to gain i rsthand knowl-edge regarding the state of affairs in his empire. Before Asoka, monarchs toured their domain during military expeditions, hunting excursions and pleasure trips. Hunting expeditions were ended by Asoka. 92 In the pre-modern era, an army gained collective training for warfare while conducting hunting expeditions. One can surmise that Asoka’s ban on hunting expeditions reduced the combat effectiveness of the Mauryan Army in the long run. Conclusion Asoka’s policy of dhamma shows that for the i rst time in South Asian history, the state was systematically trying to regulate religion within its dominions. Asoka’s dhamma means rules of conduct. The ahimsa of Buddhism and Jainism suited Asoka, who followed the policy of stra-tegic defence: no more aggressive campaigns for annexation of foreign territories, but continued use of the army for deterring external and internal enemies. Asoka followed a moderate form of militarism. Force was to be used as a last option for maintaining the borders and keep-ing the ‘peace’ among the forest dwellers. This was possible because of certain beliefs within Buddhism and Jainism that tend to relativize the norm of not killing. 93 Asoka, like Plato, accepted that war should not be considered apart from morality and justice. 94 Truly, Asoka breathed a humanitarian spirit into the rigid Mauryan administration. However, Asoka’s welfare policy is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, his welfare mechanism’s objective was to look after the material well-being of the inhabitants of his empire; on the other hand, it functioned as a surveillance mechanism. Asoka’s dhamma had many similarities to Confucianism and certain other political philosophies of ancient China. However, Asoka’s dhamma died an early death.

In Trautmann’s view, Kautilya is at best a compiler and editor of the teachings of previous teachers belonging to the arthasastra tradition. 1 In a somewhat similar vein, D. N. Jha writes that computer analysis shows that there are three distinct styles in the Arthasastra , but that Books 2, 3 and 4 have a distinct Mauryan touch and constitute the kernel of the Arthasastra . 2 Related to the problem of authorship, the author’s background is also shrouded in mystery. According to one tradition, Kautilya (also known as Chanakya and Vishnugupta) was a learned Brahmin of east-ern India who served the Nanda Dynasty of Magadha but left the Nandas due to some personal problems. According to another version, Kautilya hailed from Taxila, an important cultural centre in Pakistan’s Punjab, about twenty miles north-west of Rawalpindi. On his own ini-tiative, he became a councilor of Chandragupta Maurya, the founder of the Maurya Empire. 3 P. V. Kane, following the Buddhist and Jain traditions, suggests that Kautilya probably hailed from Gandhara. 4 The 1 Surendra Nath Mital, Kautilya Arthasastra Revisited (2000; reprint, Centre for Studies in Civilizations, distributed by Munshiram Manoharlal: New Delhi, 2004), pp. 106, 111. 2 D.

In general, historians agree that Kautilya played a very important part in the success of Chandragupta (320–297/6 bce ). P. V. Kane claims that the Arthasastra was com-posed between 320 and 300 bce . Some scholars point out that if the Arthasastra was the product of Kautilya, why does Megasthenes, the Seleucid ambassador to the Maurya court, never mention Kautilya? Kane says that it is because in 302 bce , when Megasthenes came to India, Kautilya had retired from public life. 6 Narasingha P. Sil assumes that towards the end of Chandragupta’s reign, Kautilya fell out with his royal master and left the Maurya capital of Pataliputra (near Bankipur on the river Ganga in Bihar) and retired to private life. The Arthasastra was probably composed during Kautilya’s retirement from the court at Pataliputra. 7 Secondly, only fragments of Megasthenes’ work has sur-vived. So we cannot be sure whether Megasthenes did know of Kautilya Arthasastra . Origin and Scope of ARTHASASTRA Kautilya’s work did not develop in a vacuum. The theory of pol-ity – that is, the genre known as arthasastra – emerged as early as 600 bce . 8 Kautilya quotes several individual predecessors, including Pisuna, Bharadvaja, Kaninka, Vatavyadhi, and Visalaksa, most of whom belonged to the arthasastra tradition. Arthasastra is the name of the work com-posed by Kautilya, but it also refers to a genre of classical Hindu litera-ture. In Kane’s view, arthasastra is narrower in scope than dharmasastra but broader than dandaniti . Overall, arthasastra comprises politics, eco-nomics, law and justice. 9 Arthasastra means labha (the theory of politics for acquisition, i.e., the theory of the acquisition of political power and economic resources) and palana (good governance, i.e., the protection of material goods and the king’s subjects). 10 ‘Economics and the theory 5 Mital, Kautilya Arthasastra Revisited , p. 60. 6 Kane, History of Dharmasastra , vol. 1, Part 1, pp. 172, 184–5, 215. 7 Sil, Kautilyas Arthasastra , pp. 19–20. 8 The Kautilya Arthasastra (hereinafter KA ), Part III, A Study , by R.

The school of the Usanas continues: ‘For with it are bound up undertakings connected with all the knowledge systems.’ 12 Kautilya says: ‘Since with their help one can learn what is spiritual good and material well-being, therefore the knowledge systems ( vidyas ) are so called. Samkhya, Yoga and Lokayata – these constitute philosophy.’ 13 Kautilya attempts to put forward the timeless laws of pol-itics, economy, diplomacy and war. 14 Kautilya’s work contains i fteen adhikaranas (books). The i rst i ve books deal with the internal administration of the polity, and the next eight deal with foreign relations. The last two books are miscellaneous in character. Book 7 deals especially with foreign policy and the use of stratagems and force for gaining objectives. Books 9 and 10 deal with military preparations for the vijigishu (ruler with hegemonic ambitions). Book 12 shows how a weak king should survive against a strong king. Book 13 mainly describes siege warfare. 15 The Arthasastra is written in prose, with verses scattered at the middle or end of chapters. 16 The geographical scope of Kautilya’s theory encom-passes the whole subcontinent. Kautilya praises high-value commodities from different parts of South Asia. He refers to silk from Magadha (Bihar) and Kasmira (Kashmir), cloth from Vanga (West Bengal and Bangladesh), and gems and diamonds from Vidharbha, Kalinga (Orissa), Kosala and Kasi. 17 Kautilya was also aware of the neighbouring countries of India. The Arthasastra speaks of silk from Cinas (China) and blankets from Nepal. 18 Kautilya’s work does not refer to any particular historical event.

In such works, any reference to historical individuals or events is inconceivable, as any such reference would reduce the value of the work. 19 Kautilya may not have mentioned historical events but no theorist could remain unaffected by the surrounding historical context and the contemporary material culture. In addition to the pre-existing political theories in India, Kautilya’s ideas are also shaped by his immedi-ate historical background, which is the focus of the next section. The Economic, Political and Military Background After late in the sixth century bce , Magadha emerged as the most power-ful mahajanapada . Bimbisara, the ruler of Magadha (546–494 bce ), was known as seniya (one with sena ). D. N. Jha asserts that Bimbisara was probably the i rst ruler in India with a regular standing army. Bimbisara annexed Anga. Bimbisara’s son and successor, Ajatasatru, not only forti-i ed Rajagriha (the capital of Magadha) with a forty-kilometer-long wall but also sent one of his ministers (a Brahmin named Vassakara) to sow dissension among the Lichchhavi tribes. 20 Ajatasatru was able to over-throw the Vajjis through the policy of bheda followed by Vassakara. 21 Kautilya’s concept of kutayuddha was probably shaped by such historical events. In 413 bce , Shishunaga, the viceroy/governor of Benaras, became the ruler, and in 321 bce the Shishunaga dynasty was overthrown by Mahapadma Nanda. Mahapadma, a Sudra, not only annexed Kalinga but also increased the strength of the army. 22 The Vishnu Purana and the Brahmanda Purana say that the Nandas ruled for 100 years. 23 Alexander crossed the Hindu Kush mountain range in 327 bce , but he then left after a brief sojourn in north-west India. Hence, no direct confrontation between the Greeks and the Nanda Empire occurred. Chandragupta, like Mahapadma Nanda, was a Sudra. Chandragupta’s mother, Mura, was propably the daughter of a Persian merchant. Rel ecting the historical reality, the Arthasastra , unlike the vedas , never argue that the vijigishu should always come from the Kshatriya rank. Chandragupta seized Magadha around 321 bce . By 312 bce , he had completed the conquest of north and north-west India.

Paurava, who was ruling as a client ruler on behalf of Alexander, was killed before 318 bce . The Mudraraksa tells us that Chandragupta, with the aid of some mercenaries from the north-west frontier tribes, laid siege to Kusumapura, the capital of Magadha. In the Questions of Milinda there is a reference to Bhaddasala, a general belonging to the Nandas, who fought against Chandragupta. Chandragupta defeated Seleucus in 305 bce in a series of encounters along the river Indus. Megasthenes came to the Maurya court as an ambassador around 302 bce and resided in India for four years.

Some factual state-ments point to the fact that the Maurya Empire was a centralized bureau-cratic polity. The Mauryas, like the Romans, were great road builders, and all the roads led to Pataliputra. Megasthenes noted that the thousand-mile-long royal highway connected Pataliputra to Taxila. 28 Pataliputra was connected to Nepal via Vaishali. From there a road passed through Champaran to Kapilavastu, Kalsi (DehraDun District), and Hazara up to Peshawar. Another network of roads connected Pataliputra to Sasaram, Mirzapur and central India. Yet, another road connected Pataliputra to Kalinga, Andhra and Karnataka, the southernmost limit of the empire. 29 These roads, besides facilitating trade and commerce, also functioned as military highways. Jha claims that the Maurya economy was a sort of command economy. The Maurya polity exercised rigid control through a number of super-intendents who presided over all trade and commercial activities.

India produced high-qual-ity steel, and the metal workers of Asia Minor adopted the techniques of Indian steel making. 31 Kautilya tells us about a die-striking (punch-mark-ing) system but is unaware of casting coins in mould. 32 The Magadhan state functioned as a cash economy. 33 Money was used for trade as well as for paying the state’s civilian and military ofi cials. 34 Megasthenes tells us that soldiers were paid and equipped by the state. Hence, it seems that the Mauryas maintained a standing army and not merely a militia. 35 On the other hand, opines P. C.

Not only did the private militias of these armed srenis provide protection to these organi-zations from brigands and highwayman, but during emergencies the ruler also hired them to i ght internal as well as external enemies. These armed guilds occasionally engaged in private warfare and, in a way, consti-tuted semi-autonomous states within a state. 36 It seems that the Mauryan Empire was not uniformly administered and was partially centralized and partially decentralized. Romila Thapar takes a middle position and claims that the level of con-trol exercised by the Maurya central government over different regions varied with distance. The inner core of the Maurya Empire was the met-ropolitan state of Magadha, which was ruled directly by the emperor from Pataliputra. Beyond the metroplitan state was the outer core of the empire, which comprised north and central India. The outer core region was divided into several provinces ruled by viceroys appointed by the emperor at Pataliputra. Most of the viceroys were princes of the royal family. The control of the central government at Pataliputra over the outer core region was substantial, but less than its control over the metropoli-tan state.

The periphery was ruled by several hereditary vassal chiefs and tribal leaders who accepted the political suzerainty of the Mauryan emperor at Pataliputra. It goes without saying that the control exercised by the central government at Pataliputra over the distant periphery was weak-est. The central government did not interfere in the internal affairs of the vassal kingdoms, but it did control the foreign and military policies of the vassal chiefs. 37 This three-tier model of Thapar seems to be the most appropriate one for explaining the structure of the Maurya Empire. It is to be noted that the Arthasastra also speaks of regions ruled directly by the vijigishu ; the janapadas (fertile agricultural land dotted with urban centres), which were ruled by chiefs and ofi cials appointed by the viji-gishu and hereditary vassal chiefs; and the forest regions under indirect control of the vijigishu . As a basis of comparison, the Shang Empire of China seems to have been more centralized than the Mauryan Empire because the former political entity had the capacity to conscript the com-mon people for civil engineering projects and distributed grain through a system of centrally administered state granaries. 38 Buddhism focused mainly on moksa . The arthasastra school, asserts Sil, emerged as a reaction to Buddhism. The arthasastra tradition emphasizes materialism rather than morality. The arthasastra writers divide the goals of human life into chatuvarga (four categories): dharma (morality), artha (wealth), kama (desires) and moksa . And of these four, artha occupies the most prominent place. Kautilya himself says that material well-being is supreme, because spiritual well-being and sensual pleasures depend on material well-being. The arthasastra means the sastra (theory) of artha . The meaning of artha changes with circumstances; broadly, it refers to wealth and territory with human population. Kautilya’s Arthasastra does not really deal with the theory of the generation of wealth but is a trea-tise on statecraft. Kautilya says that the source of the livelihood of men is wealth and that the means for the attainment and protection of artha constitutes the theory of politics. Kautilya aims to educate the prince on the acquisition of material welfare ( labha ) and its maintenance through good governance. 39 The objective of Kautilya’s theory is to lay bare the study of politics, wealth and practical expediency.

Chousalkar, is based on the Lokayata philosophy, which emphasized analysis of concrete facts. The Lokayatas deduced their con-clusions from human behaviour and attempted an inductive investiga-tion of the polity. 41 In the following sections, Kautilya’s philosophical ideas are compared to and contrasted with both Western and Chinese philosophies. Kautilya as a Realist Philosopher and a Theorist of Power Realist theorists of international relations assume that the state is an uni-tary actor with coherent objectives and a centralized capacity to act on its decisions. 42 The Realist School argues that the behaviour of states is shaped by the power at their disposal in the i ercely competitive interna-tional environment. Actions undertaken by a polity for defensive purposes may be seen by others as posing an offensive threat. 43 The measures that one state takes to increase its security in an insecure world often decrease another state’s security, even if that is not intended. One’s strength may be another’s weakness. Each side fears the other, but every step that one side takes to strengthen security scares the other into similar steps, and vice versa, in a continuing escalating spiral. For the polities, there is no escape from the system. This is known as a ‘prisoner’s dilemma’, fuelled by mutual suspicion. As absolute security is difi cult to achieve, constant warfare may be waged, conquests carried afar and power accumulated, all motivated by security concerns – that is, for defence. 44 The actors in the international state system pursue gain-maximizing behaviour and have difi culty effecting cooperation. 45 This is because, in the realist par-adigm, the international state system is a self-help system, and today’s 40 Rashed Uz Zaman, ‘Kautilya: The Indian Strategic Thinker and Indian Strategic Culture’, Comparative Strategy , vol. 25, no. 3 (2006), p. 235. 41 Ashok S.

Victoria Tin-Bor Hui writes that classical Western thinkers like Machiavelli and Hobbes emphasized both passions and interests. My take is that both these thinkers, like Kautilya, focused more on inter-ests than on emotions and passions. Kenneth Waltz somewhat revises the classical insights and suggests that rational states seek to maximize secu-rity rather than power, because security is the highest end, while power is a means to an end. Waltz continues that states at a minimum seek their own preservation and at a maximum drive for universal domin-ion 50 that will give them total security. This is exactly the point that Kautilya pushes. The neo-realist approach assumes that states seek power. The offen-sive realists argue that states pursue power not only for security but also for acquiring hegemony in the inter-state arena, since only a hegemon is truly secure. 51 The defensive realists argue that states attempt to expand when expansion increases their security, and offensive realism argues that a state’s capabilities shape its intentions. It will expand when it can. However, Mearsheimer, an advocate of offensive realism, accepts the idea that the fundamental objective behind state behaviour is survival. 52 Kautilya, like the realists, believes that the world is full of disor-der, anarchy and chaos.

The mandala (circle of states’ with the vijigishu at the centre) system is a l uid one and the relation-ships among the various states are always changing, thus creating dan-ger for some and opportunities for others. 53 The international system, in Kautilya’s eyes, is characterized by matsanya (the law of the pond, where bigger i sh gobble up smaller i sh). In other words, the inter-state system is characterized by chaos, and the only operating principle is ‘might is right’. 54 In contrast to the Upanishads , which pushes a metaphoric attitude towards violence, Kautilya presents an instrumental view of organized violence: state interests and the careful calculation of a cool strategist. 55 The mandala theory is essentially a doctrine of strife and struggle. Usanas notes that a king who refuses to i ght is swallowed up by the earth just as a rat swallows a mouse. 56 Like the Namierites, Kautilya does not believe in any ideology behind human actions. 57 Kautilya says that the foreign policy of a vijigishu should be shaped by the self-interest of the state. Kautilya speaks of karmasandhi , that is, a treaty signed with a ‘natural’ enemy in order to tide over emergencies and to protect the state. 58 The implication is that such treaties are to be torn apart at the i rst possible opportunity. Francis X. Clooney S.J. asserts that Kautilya advocates preemptive strikes in order to protect the king-dom from external enemies. 59 Preventive war is war waged to arrest the growth of a hostile military power through bold and timely action, exploiting one’s advantage while one can. By contrast, a pre-emptive strike is an attack against the enemy for the purpose of self-defence, when a massive enemy attack is almost certain to come and could not be effectively checked.

Success is obtaining happiness. Power is threefold: the power of knowledge is the power of counsel, the power of the treasury and the army is the power of might, the power of valour is the power of energy. In the same way, success is also threefold: that attainable by the power of counsel is success by counsel, that attainable by the power of might is success by might, that attainable by the power of energy is success by energy. 61 Roger Boesche writes that the goal of the science of politics for Kautilya, as for Hobbes, is power. 62 In the Shantiparva of the Mahabharata , Bhisma, somewhat like a neo-realist theorist, advises Kshatriya to acquire power because a powerful person is the master of everything. Further, wealth strengthens power. Bhisma goes on to say that power is superior to dharma because in the i nal analysis, dharma is protected by power. This trend of thinking is further developed in the Arthasastra . Kautilya, like Bhisma, accepts the importance of power in public life. Taking a statist perspective, Kautilya writes that ‘The king, the ministers, the kingdom, the fortii ed cities, the treasury, the army and the ally, are the constituent elements of the state.’ 63 However, Bhisma says that if dharma and power are associated with truth, then this troika becomes invincible. 64 This point is not accepted by Kautilya. He separates political action from religious speculations, urg-ing the vijigishu to depend on the theory of artha rather than on religious precepts. 65 At times, during periods of international anarchy, cooperation among some states becomes possible. A would-be hegemon could be deterred by the formation of an anti-hegemonic coalition, and if deterrence failed, then the hegemon could actually be pushed back by a military defeat inl icted upon him by the coalition. 66 Here lies the importance of diplo-macy for establishing the balance of power in the international arena. And Kautilya’s Arthasastra gives a lot of space to the balancing behaviour of weak states as a means of survival in the anarchic world.

For the use of money is made at all times, only sometimes that of troops. And with money, troops and other objects of desire are obtained.’ 67 T asamantah is the neighbour of the weak king whose overthrow has brought the vijigishu into conti-guity with him. Hence, he now becomes the enemy of the vijigishu when formerly he was his ally, being one state away. 68 Theodore George Tsakiris asserts that the Greek historian Thucydides is the founding father of political realism. He is principally a theorist who utilizes the empirical evidence of the Peloponnesian War to vali-date his own abstract conceptualizations as regards power, human nature and the dynamics of war and peace. 69 Thucydides is a narrative histo-rian rather than a philosophical analyst like Kautilya. Still, this histori-an’s views regarding warfare and strategy need to be assessed in relation to Kautilya’s concepts. Thucydides writes that in making a case study of the Athens-Sparta conl ict, he is dealing with the theme of the ori-gins of war, a theme that is of timeless relevance. In his History of the Peloponnesian War , Thucydides recounts the tragedy of human action in a world of powerful forces beyond human control. For Thucydides, the major motives for going to war are land disputes, past injuries and hegemonic ambitions. 70 The fundamental drives dei ning the behaviour of states are ambition, fear and self-interest fuelling the state’s perennial quest for power. In Thucydides’ framework, states have to achieve their objectives within an antagonistic, peri dious and anarchic international system. Thucydides derives his political realism from the Greek philos-opher Heracleitus (500 bce ), who claims that war is synonymous with the perpetual state of political antagonism determining the relation of states in a condition of political anarchy. Heracleitus contends that war is the father of all things, and that war is unavoidable and necessary for perpetuating the equilibrium of the international system. 71 Thucydides’ history analyzes the political, social and moral-psychological dynam-ics that generate aggression, violence and the desire for domination and revenge. Unlike Kautilya, Thucydides assumes that the long-term security 67 KA , Part II, by Kangle, p. 350. 68 Ibid., p. 353. 69 Theodore George Tsakiris, ‘Thucydides and Strategy: Formations of Grand Strategy in the History of the Second Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC)’, Comparative Strategy , vol. 25, no. 3 (2006), p. 173. 70 Eric Robinson, ‘Thucydides and Democratic Peace’, JME , vol. 5, no. 4 (2006), p. 250. 71 Tsakiris, ‘Thucydides and Strategy’, pp. 174–5.

The classic realist thinker is Machiavelli. Hence, a detailed compari-son of Kautilya and Machiavelli will be fruitful. Machiavelli was born in Florence in 1469 of an old citizen family. In 1498, he was appointed sec-retary and second chancellor to the Florentine Republic. In accordance with the duties of his ofi ce, he led several diplomatic missions to Louis XII, Emperor Maximilian, Julius II and others. In 1507, as chancellor of the newly appointed Nove di Milizia, he organized an infantry force that fought with the army that captured Pisa in 1509. B. N. Mukherjee writes that Machiavelli was the Kautilya of the West. 74 For Machiavelli, power is an end in itself. Machiavelli’s The Prince (1513), like the Arthasastra , investigates ways to acquire, retain and expand power. His prince prefers fear to love from his subjects. Sil claims that Machiavelli’s image of the prince was modelled on the per-sonality of Asiatic conquerors like Genghis Khan and Timur, who were regarded as the very embodiment of force and fear. 75 Machiavelli, in his Discourses , writes that a combination of force and fraud will overwhelm the enemy. 76 In The Prince , Machiavelli writes: ‘The fact is that a man who wants to act virtuously in every way necessarily comes to grief among so many who are not virtuous. Therefore if a prince wants to maintain his rule he must learn how not to be virtuous.’ 77 Machiavelli elaborates: ‘Everyone realizes how praiseworthy it is for a prince to honour his word and to be straightforward rather than crafty in his dealings; nonetheless contempo-rary experience shows that princes who have achieved great things have been those who have given their words lightly, who have known how to 72 David Cohen, ‘War, Moderation, and Revenge in Thucydides’, JME , vol. 5, no. 4 (2006), p. 285. 73 Russett, ‘Thucydides, Ancient Greece, and the Democratic Peace’, p. 258. 74 B.

Because men are wretched creatures who would not keep their word to you, you need not keep your word to them.... Those who have known best how to imitate the fox have come off best. But one must know how to colour one’s actions and to be a great liar and deceiver. Men are so simple, and so much creatures of circumstances, that the deceiver will always i nd somebody ready to be deceived. 79 Machiavelli notes that there are two ways of i ghting: by law or by force. The i rst way is natural to men, and the second to beasts. But as the i rst way often proves inadequate, one must sometimes have recourse to the second. So a prince must understand how to make a nice use of the beast and the man. 80 These two sorts of war are some-what equivalent to Kautilya’s dharmayuddha and kutayuddha . One type of kutayuddha is asurayuddha , which, in terms of its amoral approach and lethality, is equivalent to Machiavelli’s i ghting like a beast. Kautilya says that the vijigishu should make use of both dhar-mayuddha and asurayuddha in accordance with the circumstances. Both Kautilya and Machiavelli believe that the end justii es the means. Both agree on the utilization of wine, women, poison and spies for the attainment of one’s objectives. 81 For Machiavelli, war is a tool of politics. 82 Machiavelli gives prime importance to armies and warfare in his paradigm of power-politics. He asserts: A Prince, therefore, must have no other object or thought, nor acquire skill in anything, except war, its organization, and its discipline. The art of war is all that is expected of a ruler; and it is so useful that besides enabling hereditary princes to maintain their rule it frequently enables ordinary citizens to become rulers. On the other hand, we i nd that princes who have thought more of their pleasures than of arms have lost their states. The i rst way to lose your state is to neglect the art of war; the i rst way to win a state is to be skilled in the art of war. 83 78 Ibid., p. 99. 79 Ibid., pp. 99–100. 80 Ibid., p. 99. 81 Chakravarti, Art of War in Ancient India , p. vii. 82 Beatrice Heuser, Reading Clausewitz (London: Pimlico, 2002 ), p. 44. 83 Machiavelli, The Prince , p. 87.

Kautilya introduces the concept of ekatra , which means an expedition for a single specii c objective. And anekatra refers to more than one objective, which in turn requires i ghting simul-taneously in various places. 85 While undertaking an expedition, Kautilya warns that the vijigishu should leave behind one-third to one-fourth of the troops for the purpose of protecting his base. 86 Rather than pure force, Kautilya advises the vijigishu to use economic welfare in conjunction with force to maintain his power. It is to be noted that for Kautilya, bala (army) is less important than kosa (treasury). Kautilya says that an army can be raised and maintained from a well-i lled treasury for maintaining dharma , but not vice versa. 87 In Kautilya’s paradigm, prabhavasakti (the combined power of the army and treasury) is more important than mantrasakti (diplomacy) and utsahasakti (the personal energy and drive of the ruler). 88 Kautilya not only attempts to conceptualize the nature of war, both within and among the states, but also tries to formulate a strategy of power. He attempts to create a systematic and universal theory of power and warfare that will be applicable in all environmental contexts. The lynchpin of Kautilya’s paradigm is the assumption that human beings crave power, the most vital component for survival in the big bad cos-mos. One could argue that, like the Enlightenment theorists, Kautilya is trying to formulate a theory of power/security based on universal, time-less and ‘scientii c’ principles that will hold true for all ages. 89 Torkel Brekke criticizes Kautilya by saying that the power and inl u-ence of the kings in the international order described by Kautilya over-lap and interpenetrate in ways with internal enemies in ways that make it impossible to distinguish between external and internal affairs. 90 84 Felix Gilbert, ‘Machiavelli: The Renaissance of the Art of War’, in Peter Paret (ed.), Makers of Modern Strategy from Machiavelli to the Nuclear Age (1986; reprint, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1990), p. 24. 85 KA , Part II, by Kangle, p. 333. 86 Chakravarti, Art of War in Ancient India , p. 93. 87 G.

If a ruler betrays his allies and breaks his word in the international realm, he is also likely to subjugate his citizens in the domestic realm. The state becomes some-thing like a predatory mai a. Victoria Tin-Bor Hui writes that a dynamic theory should view politics – both international and domestic – as a process of strategic interaction between domination seekers and targets of domination. 92 Thucydides harps on the change in the international balance of power that creates insecurity for a state, but he also stresses the importance of domestic politics (demagogues, passions, emotions and perceptions, i.e., the role of subjective human agency) in shaping the foreign policy of a polis . 93 Thucydides points out that external war causes internal strife within the polis . 94 Machiavelli also notes the linkages between internal security and external security. He says that there are two things a prince must fear: internal subversion from his subjects, and external aggression by foreign powers. Against the latter, his defence lies in being well armed and having good allies; and if he is well armed, he will always have good allies. In addition, domestic affairs will always remain under control pro-vided that relations with external powers are under control, and if the rebels were not disturbed by a conspiracy sponsored by a foreign power. Machiavelli notes that if the prince imposes excessive taxes on the people, his reputation will decline. This will result in his subjects turning against him, and he will be generally despised. 95 Kautilya links up kopa within the state with intervention by the for-eign powers. In other words, Kautilya is making a linkage between inter-nal rebellion and the shifting power structure in the international arena. Kautilya authorizes the vijigishu to pursue an expansionist design as regards foreign affairs and total suppression of the civil society in order to weed out any possibility of kopa . The Arthasastra discusses kopa from the perspective of state security. The principal danger to the state, writes Kautilya, comes from prakriti kopa . This means the anger or wrath of 91 T orkel Brekke, ‘Wielding the Rod of Punishment – War and Violence in the Political Science of Kautilya’, JME , vol. 3, no. 1 ( 2004 ), p. 46. 92 Hui, War and State Formation in Ancient China and Early Modern Europe , pp. 2, 15. 93 Russett, ‘Thucydides, Ancient Greece, and the Democratic Peace’, pp. 255, 265. 94 Cohen, ‘War, Moderation, and Revenge in Thucydides’, p. 280. 95 Machiavelli, The Prince , pp. 92, 103.

While analyzing the factors behind kopa , says Chousalkar, Kautilya focuses mainly on the individual actors rather than on the social and class factors. The Arthasastra takes a top-down approach. Kautilya asserts that the leaders of the rebellion are not thrown up spontaneously from below; rather, they are disgrun-tled elites of the state like the yuvaraj (crown prince), the mantri (min-ister) and the senapati (general). 96 Ajatasatru (ruled 493–461 bce ) came to power after killing his father, Bimbisara. After Ajatasatru’s death in 461 bce , he was succeeded by i ve kings, all of whom came to power by killing their fathers. Kautilya’s recommendations in the Arthasastra that a king should sow dissension among his enemies and must always guard against fratricide were probably shaped by the above-mentioned histor-ical circumstances. Hui criticizes Western international theories by stating that a theory should be more attentive to agency in order to explain changes in both the international and domestic realms. However, most Western inter-national theories focus on structure rather than agency. The structural-ists claim that individuals are embedded in their social environments and collectively shared systems of meanings. Structural realism claims that states make policy choices subject to the constraints they face. Hui writes that institutions are simultaneously enabling and restricting. She goes on to say that strategic mistakes made by an actor or a cluster of actors can fundamentally alter the trajectory of the whole system. 97 Machiavelli and Kautilya act as a corrective to the structuralism inher-ent in recent international theories. Overwhelming importance is given to the prince’s and vijigishu ’s actions and personalities in The Prince and in the Arthasastra . Of the qualities of a successful ruler, Machiavelli writes: ‘He will be despised if he has a reputation for being i ckle, frivolous, effeminate, cow-ardly, irresolute; a prince should avoid this like the plague and strive to demonstrate in his actions grandeur, courage, sobriety, strength.’ 98 Kautilya rejects astrology (meaning luck) as a way to understand fate. 99 Kautilya’s philosophy calls for paurusha (manliness/courage) plus action and not resignation on the part of the vijigishu . 96 Chousalkar, Theory of Rebellion in Kautilya and Aristotle , pp. 48, 50, 74, 76–7, 80. 97 Hui, War and State Formation in Ancient China and Early Modern Europe , pp. 19–21, 23. 98 Machiavelli, The Prince , p. 102. 99 Chakravarti, Art of War in Ancient India , p. 95.

Plato entered public service in Athens when the city was under the rule of the Thirty Tyrants installed by Sparta. He withdrew to Megara after the execution of his friend cum philosopher Socrates (470–399 bce ). However, Plato returned to Athens in 387 bce and started a garden school on the outskirts of Athens near the shrine of Academus, a local hero. In this academy, selected young men were taught Socratic philosophy and Pythagorean mathematics. On Alexander’s death in 323 bce , Plato was forced to leave Athens by the anti-Macedonian party and died in exile at Chalcis. Plato is sceptical of the common man and his virtues and values. Democracy, in Plato’s eye, is nothing more than a sort of anarchy, because the common man is a bundle of unrestrained appetites, and his behaviour is dependent on the pleasure of the moment. The content of Plato’s politics is autocratic, but it forces the philosopher-king to become a politikos for leading a life not of unmitigated luxury but of discipline and austerity, that is, a sort of military monasticism. 101 Similarly, Kautilya advises the ruler to control his senses in order to direct the administration vigorously and to endear himself to his peo-ple. Kautilya lays down a detailed routine for the vijigishu : overseeing the collection of revenue, inspecting the military forces, listening to the reports of spies during the night and delegating tasks to secret agents and so on. 102 Kautilya warns that too much indulgence in kama (sex) by the vijigishu would result in disruption of governance. 103 Like Plato, Kautilya writes that common people’s minds are not steady and that their behaviour is inconsistent. 104 Hence the vijigishu , implies Kautilya, should depend on danda rather than on the goodwill of the masses. Aristotle was born at Stagira on the Chalcidic Peninsula of Thrace and was the son of the royal physician of Macedon. He entered Plato’s 100 Mukherjee, ‘Foreword’, p. x. 101 Sil, Kautilyas Arthasastra , pp. 26–7, 37, 39, 45. 102 Nirmala Kulkarni, ‘Daily Routine of a King in Kautilya Arthasastra ’, in Michael (ed.), Concept of Rajadharma , pp. 144–5. 103 J .

He left when Plato’s nephew Speusippus was elected as the head of the academy. For the next two years, Aristotle lived with Hermias, a slave turned tyrant in Asia Minor. Hermias’ adopted daughter became Aristotle’s wife. For next three years, Aristotle served as tutor to the young Alexander of Macedon; in 335 bce he set up his Lyceum between Mount Lycabettus and the river Ilissus, north-east of Athens. This academy became a rival of Plato’s academy. 105 For Aristotle, all sciences have a practical orientation. Each techne (art/science) has to perform a certain task in order to achieve a certain telos . 106 Kautilya says: ‘Philosophy is ever thought of as the lamp of all sciences, as the means of all actions and as support of all laws and duties.’ 107 Kautilya is a supporter of the monarchical form of government and accepts, like Aristotle, that in the last instance the ruler is dependent on the suffrage of the ruled. Both the Mahabharata and the Arthasastra express a dislike of tyrants. Kautilya says that while tyrants are interested in self-aggrandizement, monarchs are more focussed on the interests of the polity. For Plato and Aristotle, power is a means to achieving a high end – the happiness of the citizens. Both Kautilya and Aristotle emphasize that moderation in the use of force ensures the stability and longevity of regimes. Kautilya warns the king to use danda with a sense of discrimi-nation and by steering a middle course. The theory of the divine origin of the king in the Kautilyan tradition is slightly different from the Western theory. In the ancient Indian context, the king is divine not because he is a god in human form but because he protects the lives and properties of his subjects along with the varna society. As long as he is pursuing his duties, the king observes dharma and is a righteous king and thus a divine monarch. If he fails to discharge his duties properly, then he ceases to be divine. 108 Kautilya’s kutayuddha has certain commonalities with the Roman his-torian Tacitus’ (56 ce–117 ce ) description of deceptive warfare. Tacitus, in his Annals , speaks of poisoning among the Parthian ruling elite and the presence of treacherous subordinates. 109 The Arthasastra introduces the concept of tusnimdandena , which means getting rid of enemy leaders 105 Ibid., p. 45. 106 Tsakiris, ‘Thucydides and Strategy’, p. 175. 107 KA , Part II, by Kangle, p. 7. 108 Chousalkar, Theory of Rebellion in Kautilya and Aristotle , pp. 50–2, 60, 67–8, 79. 109 Rhiannon Ash, ‘An Exemplary Conl ict: Tacitus’ Parthian Battle Narrative ( Annals 6.34–34)’, Phoenix , vol. 53, no. ½ (1999), p. 114.

In 172 bce , Marcius Philippus bought time for Rome, during a war with Perseus of Macedonia, by sending a deceptive embassy. And Tacitus saw merit in the Roman Emperor Tiberius’ foreign policy vis-à-vis Parthia, which encouraged the various enemy factions to i ght each other rather than directly waging war against them. 111 Kautilya elaborates the various components of kutayuddha . Dvaidhibhava is dual policy. It means that maintaining peace with one party while i ghting another power, and also outwardly maintaining peace with one power while secretly preparing to attack that power. Dvaidhibhutah is making a pact with the usual enemy in order to make war on another king. When a kalaha (life-and-death struggle) occurs between the enemy and a neighbouring king, the vijigishu sits tight, because a decline in the power of the enemy suits the vijigishus interests. Occasionally, the vijigishu also encourages kalaha between two poten-tially hostile states. Yatavya means a neighbouring prince who is afl icted with problems and hence should be attacked by the vijigishu . 112 Now, let us compare Kautilya to the most famous of the ultra-realist theorists of war of the Western world: Carl von Clausewitz. Clausewitz and Kautilya On War , or Vom Kriege , was i rst published in three volumes in Berlin between 1832 and 1834. Its author, Carl Philipp Gottlieb von Clausewitz, was born on 1 June 1780, at Burg, near Magdeburg. His grandfather was a professor of theology, and he was a Lutheran pastor. Clausewitz made little reference to religion in his own writings. He did not cite faith as a motivation for war. Nor did he view Christianity as an impulse for moderation when i ghting fellow Christians. 113 Clausewitz was a soldier from the age of twelve until his death in 1831. He started working on On War after 1815. 114 In a note written around 1818, Clausewitz com-ments: ‘My original intention was to set down my conclusions on the principal elements of this topic in short, precise, compact statements, 110 KA , Part II, by Kangle, p. 23. 111 Ash, ‘An Exemplary Conl ict’, p. 130. 112 KA , Part II, by Kangle, pp. 321, 325, 334, 343. 113 Hew Strachan, Clausewitzs On War: A Biography (New York: Atlantic Monthly Press, 2007 ), pp. ix, 32. 114 Hugh Smith, On Clausewitz: A Study of Military and Political Ideas (Houndmills, Basingstoke: Palgrave, 2005 ), p. 3.

The manner in which Montesquieu dealt with his subject was vaguely in my mind.’ 115 In 1827, Clausewitz started to revise his work, but the task remained uni nished due to his early death. 116 Clausewitz implies that transformation in politics results in transfor-mation of warfare. Clausewitz’s famous statement follows: ‘War is noth-ing but the continuation of policy with other means.’ 117 He clarii es: ‘The political object is the goal, war is the means of reaching it, and means can never be considered in isolation from their purpose.’ 118 On War says that ‘the political aim remains the i rst consideration. Policy, then, will permeate all military operations, and, in so far as their violent nature will admit, it will have a continuous inl uence on them.’ 119 Clausewitz’s trin-ity comprises of people and their passion, the commander and his army and the nature of the government. 120 Clausewitz claims that ‘the political aims are the business of government alone.’ 121 Clausewitz emphasizes the supremacy of politicians over military commanders when formulating grand strategy. 122 In Kautilya’s theory, the vijigishu completely overshad-ows the senapati . Clausewitz, like Kautilya, sees warfare as instrumental. The conduct of war needs to rel ect the fact that its objective is the establishment of peace. 123 Kautilya differs from the position of the Bhagavad Gita , where the purpose of war is existential. Both Clausewitz and Kautilya are realists and assume that inter-state war is necessary and inevitable in the highly competitive and harsh international arena. 124 And along with Clausewitz, Johann Jakob Otto August Ruhle von Lillienstern also argued that war fuli lled a political purpose. By 1804, Clausewitz had read Machiavelli’s Discourses (begun in 1513). Clausewitz admired Machiavelli’s empha-sis on the realities of power and probably learnt from him that war 115 Carl Von Clausewitz, On War , ed. and tr. by Michael Howard and Peter Paret ( 1984 ; reprint, Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1989), p. 63. 116 Heuser, Reading Clausewitz , p. 204. 117 Clausewitz, On War , ed. and tr. by Howard and Paret, p. 69. 118 Ibid., p. 87. 119 Ibid., p. 87. 120 Heuser, Reading Clausewitz , p. 53. 121 Clausewitz, On War , ed. and tr. by Howard and Paret, p. 89. 122 Michael I.

Chakravarti writes that Kautilya, like Clausewitz, believed that war is the continuation of politics by other means. 126 Clausewitz writes: ‘War is thus an act of force to compel our enemy to do our will.’ 127 As regards the means of war, he notes: There is only one: combat . However many forms combat takes, however far it may be removed from the brute discharge of hatred and enmity of a physical encounter, however many forces may intrude which themselves are not part of i ghting, it is inherent in the very concept of war that everything that occurs must originally derive from combat .... Warfare comprises everything related to the i ghting forces – everything to do with their creation, maintenance, and use.... The end for which a soldier is recruited, clothed, armed, and trained, the whole object of his sleeping, eating, drinking, and marching is simply that he should i ght at the right place and the right time . 128 Clausewitz dismissed Adam Heinrich Dietrich von Bulow’s (1757–1807) assertion that it is always possible to avoid battle. 129 Clausewitz intro-duces the concept of the centre of gravity ( schwerpunkt ), which consti-tutes the hub of all power and movement of the enemy. 130 Clausewitz’s concept of centre of gravity is taken from Newton’s law of mechanics. 131 In the case of world conquerors like Alexander, Gustavus Adolphus, Charles XII and Frederick the Great (equivalent to Kautilya’s vijigishu ), the centre of gravity was their army. 132 As regards the object of combat, Clausewitz hammers the point that ‘of all the possible aims in war, the destruction of the enemy’s armed forces always appear as the highest.’ 133 In a note written in 1830, Clausewitz emphasized that ‘victory consists not only in the occupation of the bat-tlei eld, but in the destruction of the enemy’s physical and psychic forces, which is usually not attained until the enemy is pursued after a victori-ous battle.’ 134 Clausewitz writes: ‘The invention of gunpowder and the 125 Strachan, Clausewitzs On War , pp. 83, 88. 126 Chakravarti, Art of War in Ancient India , p. v. 127 Clausewitz, On War , ed. and tr. by Howard and Paret, p. 75. 128 Ibid., p. 95.

Kautilya writes that in such a scenario tactical offensives become useless, using the expression ‘entering the l ame like a moth’. 138 Rather, in such circumstances, Kautilya advocates following a policy of ‘wait and watch’. Both Kautilya and Clausewitz emphasize the role of reserve in the battlei eld. 139 Machiavelli emphasizes the importance of battle in warfare. 140 In Clausewitz’s On War and also for Thucydides, bloodshed constitutes the most important characteristic of warfare. The Arthasastra , inl uenced by ancient India’s military experiences, marginalizes the role of battle in warfare. Around 530 bce , Cyrus, the Achaemenid emperor of Persia, crossed the Hindu Kush and occupied Gandhara. In 518 bce , Darius I, the Acahemenid monarch, annexed Punjab, which became the twentieth satrapy (province) of his empire. 141 The greatest battle fought in ancient India, the Battle of Hydaspes (326 bce ), inl uenced Kautilya’s thought as regards the tactical aspects of warfare and his ideas about military organization. Initially, Paurava dispatched 2,000 cavalry and 120 chariots under his son to oppose Alexander’s crossing of Jhelum. Alexander defeated this contingent, and then Paurava advanced with his main force to check Alexander. 142 In this battle, Paurava deployed 200 elephants and 30,000 infantry, 4,000 cavalry and 300 chariots. 143 Compared to the vedic and epic chariots, 135 Ibid., p. 76. 136 Ibid., p. 80. 137 Heuser, Reading Clausewitz , pp. 91–3.

Ajatasatru introduced scythe chariots into the Magadhan army. 144 The Macedonian heavy infantry made short work of the chariots, as in Gaugemela. Paurava placed 2,000 cavalry at each of the wings. Alexander ordered Coenus with his cavalry to attack the cavalry on Paurava’s right wing. As Coenus moved towards Paurava’s right wing, Alexander was proceeding towards Paurava’s left wing. Meanwhile, Paurava ordered the cavalry on the right wing to come to the support of his outnumbered left wing. Then Alexander ordered his horse archers to attack the Indian left wing. When the Indian cav-alry concentrated on their left wing, Coenus appeared at their rear. As part of the Indian force turned around to meet Coenus, Alexander deliv-ered his attack. As in Gaugemela, the Macedonian cavalry attacked in a wedge formation. Then the elephants advanced towards the Greek cav-alry. After a furious struggle, the elephants were overwhelmed by Greek phalangites and 1,000 mounted archers that Alexander had bought from Central Asia. 145 After 400 bce , chariots were no longer used in China. 146 Despite the uselessness of the chariots in the Battle of Hydaspes, Kautilya writes about the necessity of chariots in the battle order of the vijigishu , and the Maurya army maintained chariots. 147 This was because disciplined infantry and good horses were not available to the Mauryas. The ele-phants impressed the Greeks, and the use of war elephants spread in the Western world. Pyrrhus, the king of Epirus, used elephants at Heraclea (280 bce ). 148 The Nandas maintained 80,000 cavalry, 200,000 infantry, 8,000 chariots and 6,000 elephants. Chandragupta raised the number of infantry to 600,000 and the elephant corps to 9,000, but his cavalry numbered only 30,000. In other words, the Maurya cavalry was numer-ically weaker than the Nanda cavalry establishment. 149 This was despite the fact that at the climactic Battle of Hydaspes, it was Alexander’s cavalry that played the crucial role.

Around 100 bce , the Han Emperor Wu-ti/di (140–87 bce ) directed several campaigns against Ferghana (in Russian Turkestan) to acquire horses. The horses from Ferghana were also used for breeding a better variety of horses that was required for i ghting the nomadic invaders. 151 The Mahabharata mentions the presence of mounted archers with composite bows. Neither Paurava nor Chandragupta possessed mounted archers. In fact, Kautilya never mentions the presence of mounted archers in the vijigishu ’s order of battle. The invading Aryans probably introduced mounted archery on the subcontinent, but this practice died out. 152 D. D. Kosambi claims that due to a shortage of metals, most of the Indian soldiers who opposed Alexander could not afford metallic body armour. The bulk of the soldiers, in his views, were equipped with a shield, a leather cuirass and a metal helmet. 153 Herodotus tells us that the Indian bowmen in Xerxes’ army used bows made of cane and bam-boo. 154 The Indian bowmen at Hydaspes were foot archers and used arrows, each of whose shaft was three yards long. 155 The arrow was discharged with the pressure of the archer’s left foot on the extremity of the bow, which rested on the ground, and the string was drawn far back-wards. Such arrows were able to penetrate shields and breastplates. 156 Due to rainfall on the night before the battle, the ground was slippery, and the Indian archers failed to make effective use of their bows in the decisive conl ict at Hydaspes. 157 Kautilya was for retaining the foot sol-diers and especially the archers, but tried to raise their combat effective-ness through training. A close reading of the Arthasastra challenges the observation of some modern historians that ancient India lacked a disciplined standing army. The Arthasastra tells us that an army is organized in squads of 10 men, companies of 100, and battalions of 1,000 each. 158 Kautilya says that the nayaka (warlord) with trumpets and l ags should coordinate 150 Mital, Kautilya Arthasastra Revisited , p. 25. 151 Olsen, ‘Horse in Ancient China and Its Cultural Inl uence’, pp. 173–4, 185. 152 Murray B.

Various types of vyuhas are described in the Arthasastra , depending on the terrain and the force structure. Each vyuha was comprised of i ve sections: a centre and two l anks that were further protected by two wings. Each section was comprised of combined battle units (infantry, cavalry, elephants and chariots). 160 At Hydaspes, Paurava came to grief for not protecting his l anks. This prob-ably induced Kautilya to come up with wings, which would function as a l ank protection force. Machiavelli writes that mercenaries and aux-iliaries are useless and dangerous. He goes on to say that wise princes, therefore, have always shunned auxiliaries and made use of their own forces. 161 As regards the army, which constitutes an important part of the danda , Kautilya writes: Inherited from the father and the grandfather, constant, obedient, with the sol-diers’ sons and wives contented, not disappointed during marches, unhindered everywhere, able to put up with troubles, that has fought many battles, skilled in the science of all types of war and weapons, not having a separate interest because of prosperity and adversity shared with the king, consisting mostly of the Kshatriyas – these are the excellences of an army. 162 Kautilya is for recruiting troops from all four varnas 163 in order to pre-vent any one community from becoming over-powerful in the state. Machiavelli comments that natural courage is inadequate. Military success depends on order and discipline. For maintaining military dis-cipline, Machiavelli, like the Legalists, focuses on harsh punishment. 164 Machiavelli stresses the importance of training. 165 Kautilya also empha-sizes training of the men and animals in the army. 166 Even with all these improvements, Kautilya was not coni dent that the Mauryan military machine could successfully counter the horse archers and the phalangite s. Hence, instead of following a battle-centric strategy, Kautilya advocated kutayuddha . 159 Chakravarti, Art of War in Ancient India , p. 86. 160 KA , Part III, by Kangle, p. 259. 161 Machiavelli, The Prince , pp. 77, 84. 162 KA , Part II, by Kangle, p. 316. 163 KA , Part III, by Kangle, p. 143. 164 Gilbert, ‘Machiavelli’, in Paret (ed.), Makers of Modern Strategy , p. 25. 165 Machiavelli, The Prince , pp. 88–9. 166 Kautilya, The Arthasastra , ed., rearranged, tr. and introduced by L.

It involves making peace and then attack-ing the enemy when he is least expecting such an attack. 168 Information warfare is a strong point with Kautilya. For waging information war-fare, Kautilya advocates the use of various types of spies to gather knowledge about different aspects of the hostile polities. In 1620, Roger Bacon wrote that ‘knowledge and human power are synony-mous, since the ignorance of the cause frustrates the effect.’ 169 However, Clausewitz disdains the role of intelligence (both battlei eld and stra-tegic) in warfare. 170 Kautilya, Thucydides and Clausewitz all focus on the intangible aspects of warfare: morale and the psychology of the commander and the men under arms. Machiavelli, like Georg Heinrich von Berenhorst (1733–1814) in 1797, anticipated Clausewitz by emphasizing the role of moral and psychological factors in warfare. 171 Like Clausewitz, Berenhorst gives importance to the personality of the ruler and to chance and accidents. 172 Both Kautilya and Clausewitz give importance to the commander. Kautilya’s vijigishu is comparable to Clausewitz’s genius for war who rises above all rules. 173 Clausewitz’s concept of genius for warfare is derived from Immanuel Kant’s writings. The latter wrote that genius is a talent for producing for which no dei nite rule can be given. 174 Clausewitz’s ‘genius for war’ is somewhat equivalent to the utsahasakti of Kautilya’s vijigishu . In his 1804 notes, Clausewitz uses the word Intelligenz to describe the commander’s rational thinking. The personal-ity of the commander is not peripheral but central to Clausewitz’s the-ory of warfare. 175 Clausewitz emphasizes the importance of decisiveness and daring on the part of the commander. 176 On War tells us: ‘Strength of character does not consist solely in having powerful feelings, but in 167 Handel, Masters of War , pp. 33, 122. 168 KA , Part II, by Kangle, p. 333. 169 Quoted in Martin Van Creveld, ‘The Eternal Clausewitz’, JSS , vol. 9, nos. 2–3 (June–Sept. 1986), endnote 12, p. 49. 170 Kahn, ‘Clausewitz and Intelligence’, p. 117. 171 Strachan, Clausewitzs On War , p. 83; Heuser, Reading Clausewitz , p. 80. 172 Heuser, Reading Clausewitz , p. 9. 173 Katherine L.

Irregular warfare involves popular participation. People’s war also involves a wide range of popular involvement in warfare. In Clausewitz’s paradigm, the militia should be used in conjunction with the regular army. Clausewitz identii ed several conditions necessary for generating guerrilla warfare: war on one’s own territory, a large theatre of operations with rough and inaccessible terrain, and a people whose temperament is suited to irregu-lar warfare. For Clausewitz, guerrilla warfare (he has Prussia in mind) is the weapon of last resort, to be used when everything else has failed. 183 Clausewitz writes that there are two types of war: war designed to destroy the enemy politically and militarily, and war designed to occupy some portion of the enemy’s territory. In the case of the i rst type of war, the victor dictates peace, and in the case of the second type of war, peace is negotiated. 184 When absolute war aimed at the complete shattering of the enemy is not possible, then war with a limited aim should be pursued. Limited war is characterized by delaying engagements, since the aim of the weak defender is to avoid decisive battles at all cost. In a limited war, the defender retreats inside his own territory and the strength of the 177 Clausewitz, On War , ed. and tr. by Howard and Paret, p. 107. 178 Ibid., p. 89. 179 Smith, On Clausewitz , p. 10. 180 Handel, Masters of War , p. 45. 181 Heuser, Reading Clausewitz , p. 76. 182 Strachan, Clausewitzs On War , p. 52. 183 Smith, On Clausewitz , pp. 32–3. 184 Strachan, Clausewitzs On War , p. 73.

The defender takes advantage of the local terrain and delays the attacker with small delaying parties until the cul-mination point of the attack has passed and the attacking party exhausts itself. At that critical juncture, the defender should switch to the offensive mode of warfare. 185 Before the First World War, Hans Delbruck, a veteran of the Franco-Prussian War and an academician, argued that if Clausewitz were alive, he would have developed a system that recognized two different forms of waging war. The i rst is described as the strategy of annihilation, and the second is the strategy of exhaustion, which is designed to wear out the enemy so that the latter is forced to negotiate. 186 As we will see in the next section, Sun Tzu, the most famous ancient Chinese theoretician, and Kautilya are indeed followers of what Delbruck categorized as the strat-egy of exhaustion. Kautilya’s ARTHASASTRA and Ancient Chinese Philosophy: A Comparative Analysis The Chinese tradition was characterized to a great extent by Legalism, which is a long-term policy for preserving and conserving the state. Legalist classics note that human beings are naturally self-seeking, so the wise ruler should use liberal rewards and stringent punishments in order to motivate the people to serve the state. 187 The Book of Lord Shang was composed by Shang Yang (390/59–338 bce ), the minister of Chin ruler Duke Hsiao. This political handbook of the Legalist School ( Fa-chia ) rejected the Confucian moral standard of jen , the Taoist natural standard of tao (the way) and the Moist (Mohist) religious standard of tien-ming , and stressed instead the importance of power and law in political life. Lord Shang writes that an intelligent ruler depends on force and not on virtue. 188 Shang Yang, some-what like Machiavelli, states that virtue will not triumph over vice. 189 To achieve shih , Shang Yang and his Legalist successors advocate generous material rewards and harsh punishments to guide individual energies into the people’s collective strength, concentrated in the ruler as shih . 190 185 Heuser, Reading Clausewitz , pp. 96, 103. 186 Strachan, Clausewitzs On War , p. 17. 187 Hui, War and State Formation in Ancient China and Early Modern Europe , pp. 18–19. 188 Sil, Kautilyas Arthasastra , p. 9. 189 Kane, Ancient China on Postmodern War , p. 64. 190 William H.

The Taoists observed nature to discover the way, the tao . People achieve happiness when they follow nature’s way by acting spontane-ously and trusting intuitive knowledge. The Taoist term wu-wei (non-action or non-competing) does not mean doing nothing but implies refraining from activity contrary to tao . The ruler’s tao is ruling, inspiring and indulgent benevolence, and the people’s tao is comprised of follow-ing, loyalty and i lial piety. The dominant pattern within the tao is the cycle: expansion and contraction, victory and defeat. The cyclic rever-sal pattern in the tao ’s eternal motion is rel ected in the eternal pairing and interplay between yin and yang . The yang after reaching its climax retreats in favour of the yin and vice versa. From the eternal pairing of opposites, the Taoists deduce that the best path to anything lies through its opposite – the indirect approach. For the Taoists, the best security for anything lies in preserving its opposite: deception. 191 Sun Tzu’s (541–481/2 bce ) thought absorbed the Taoist canon of the universal harmony of all under heaven. To avoid releasing the chaos, destruction and death that accompany war, leaders have to follow the tao : the universal principles of all things – the one way. Beyond its phil-osophical meanings, tao expressed the idea of path or road, not only in a physical sense but also as a moral/ethical notion of the right or the proper way. Sun Tzu urges the ruler to use economic wealth, social power and politics as alternatives to war. 192 Sun Tzu attempts to win vic-tory through diplomatic coercion, thwarting the enemy’s plan and alli-ances, rather than by armed combat. Even in the last resort when armed combat becomes absolutely necessary, then also the objective should still be minimum risk and exposure, limiting as far as possible the destruc-tion to be inl icted and suffered, i ghting with the aim of preservation. 193 In contrast to the Clausewitzian policy of death and destruction, Sun Tzu claims that it is better to subjugate the enemy without i ghting than to destroy him. 194 Sun Tzu’s emphasis on the use of force as a last resort rel ects a Confucian inl uence. 195 According to Confucian thought, the ruler could attract support and foster stability by implementing 191 Ibid., pp. 8, 16–17. 192 Ibid., pp. 8–9. 193 Sun Tzu, Art of War , tr. with an Historical Introduction by Ralph D.

The art and science of using coercive force (equivalent to the Hindu philosophers’ dandaniti ) to persuade an enemy without i ghting, instead of applying direct force to destroy and defeat the enemy, comprises the shih strategy. 198 William H. Mott IV and Jae Chang Kim write that from positions of weakness, the Chinese generals developed strategies, campaign plans, operational concepts and tactics designed to win wars without the need for decisive victory in every battle. Their motto is to win without i ght-ing. The two opposing concepts in Chinese strategic thought are shih and li . Li means self-interest or material gain. For li strategists every battle is decisive, but for shih strategists some battles are irrelevant. While li strategists attempt to ensure local combat superiority, shih strategists try to confuse the enemy by combining orthodox and unorthodox measures. The li strategy attempts to win by destruction, while the shih strategy tries to win without i ghting. While the li strategy’s objective is destruc-tion of the enemy, the shih strategy’s aim is to subjugate the enemy. For the shih strategists, deception is the essence of military strategy. The shih strategy uses force to bring the people into ultimate harmony and accord with the ruler in tao . Shih strategy prefers to threaten, manipulate and deter the enemy. Shih can cause an enemy to accept compliant terms without i ghting. 199 Several generations of strategists like Tai Kung (1212?–1073 bce ), Sun Tzu, Wu Tzu (541?–482? bce ), Sun Pin/Sun Bin/Sun Tzu II (380–316 bce ), and Wei Lao Tzu (ca. 318 bce ) developed and taught shih as a coherent body of thought. The Legalists assume that the object of every ruler is to become a hegemon – that is, the ruler of all of China – and that the interests of the people are incidental to this process. 200 In Sun Tzu’s The Art of War , the shih is the dynamic power that emerges through a combination of men’s hearts, military weapons and natural conditions. The shih strategy includes three dimensions of warfare: the people, the context and the enemy. It somewhat differs from Clausewitz’s trinity of 196 Art of War , tr. by Sawyer, p. 32. 197 Kane, Ancient China on Postmodern War , p. 124. 198 Mott IV and Kim, Philosophy of Chinese Military Culture , p. 10. 199 Ibid., pp. xi, 11–12, 15, 34, 43–4. 200 Kane, Ancient China on Postmodern War , p. 134.

The enemy’s power lies in the relative skill, competence and will of the opposing force. Since men and their hearts are critical to shih strategy, the commanders and the rulers need to know how to mobilize them. A ruler’s adherence to the tao (the right way) brings the people into accord with the ruler in inter-nal harmony. Without tao , even the best rulers and commanders could not rely on shih . Sun Tzu’s prescription for creating shih is to achieve tao , the state in which all people are in full accord with the ruler; in such a polity the people will die for the ruler. To sum up, shih strategy by defeating the enemy’s intent rather than using force and by building up strength by harmoniously combining the people, the ruler and the army, provides victory. 202 The i ve indicators of relative power in Sun Tzu’s paradigm are the degree of harmony between the ruler and the people, the correctness of the season, the advantages of terrain, the skills of the military commander and the degree of military discipline. 203 In Clausewitz’s theory, the commitment of the people and their mobi-lization in waging war are very important. 204 Hsing means the employ-ment and deployment of troops. Hsing is the tangible, visible and determinate shape of physical strength. Shih is also comprised of intan-gible factors like morale, opportunity, timing and psychology. These two concepts are in a way interlinked. Huai Nan Tzu (140? bce ) comes up with two kinds of military shih : the soldiers’ morale and the generals’ skill. Chi shih bestows intrinsic advantage and creates an army’s endog-enous shih . Exogenous Ti-shih , the advantage in critical terrain, expands endogenous shih . Sun Tzu’s Confucian-Taoist premise that power resides among the people locates a state’s true strength less in strong forts and powerful weaponry than in the peoples’ morale and the soldiers’ moral stamina. 205 Hence, Sun Tzu harps on chi , the spirit or motivation of the troops. 206 In Clausewitz’s paradigm, diplomacy and the conduct of warfare con-stitute two different watertight compartments; for Sun Tzu and Kautilya, however, these two activities fuse to comprise a continuous seamless 201 Isabelle Duyvesteyn, Clausewitz and African War: Politics and Strategy in Liberia and Somalia (Oxon: Routledge, 2005 ).

"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Hinduism and the Ethics of Warfare in South Asia90activity. 207 For Sun Tzu and Kautilya, unlike Clausewitz, warfare is insep-arable from the broader art of statecraft. The arsenal of the vijigishu , in Kautilya’s format, includes six types of gunas (policies) for dealing with external emergencies: sandhi (alliance), war, neutrality, marching, taking shelter and dvaidhibhava . 208 Unlike Clausewitz’s philosophy which is equivalent to the force-based li strategy, shih strategy considers deception a primary ingredient of mili-tary planning. 209 In fact, the roots of Clausewitzian strategy can be traced back to classical Greece. The combat philosophy of ancient Greece and its concomitant concept of valour ( andreia ) were built around the concept of i ghting a vernichtungsschlacht (battle of annihilation). This means the immediate application of force in quest for a decisive battle that will destroy the opponent’s ability to i ght thereby leading to his immediate capitulation. The strike is to be directed at the opponent’s centre of grav-ity; it must be overwhelming and should be delivered in a single blow. 210 As regards the preferred method of winning, while Clausewitz focuses on decisive battles – that is, maximum concentration of force at the decisive point of engagement – Sun Tzu emphasizes extensive use of deception, psychological warfare and non-violent methods. For Clausewitz, the cen-tre of gravity is the enemy’s army, but for Sun Tzu the centre of gravity is the enemy’s will and the alliance system. 211 Sun Tzu and Sun Tzu II are against conducting attritional campaigns even when they are bound to be successful. Sun Tzu’s The Art of War warns against excessive dependence on violence. 212 Sun Tzu warns the rulers and statesmen not to depend solely on sheer military power or on numerical superiority. 213 Sun Tzu II writes: ‘Those who enjoy mili-tarism, however, will perish; and those who are ambitious for victory will be disgraced. War is not something to enjoy, victory is not to be an object of ambition.’ 214 Both Kautilya and Sun Tzu urge subjugation rather than destruction of the enemy. 215 Sun Tzu II speaks of establishing 207 Handel, Masters of War , p. 31. 208 Kane, History of Dharmasastra , vol. 1, Part 1, p. 201. 209 Mott IV and Kim, Philosophy of Chinese Military Culture , p. 41. 210 Tsakiris, ‘Thucydides and Strategy’, p. 177. 211 Handel, Masters of War , p. 19. 212 Kane, Ancient China on Postmodern War , pp. 25, 123. 213 Handel, Masters of War , p. 96. 214 Sun Tzu II, The Lost Art of War , tr. with Commentary by Thomas Cleary (San Francisco: HarperCollins, 1996 ), p. 21. 215 Surya P.

Both Sun Tzu and the ancient Chinese historian Sima Qian advocate underhanded tactics when they can serve as a substitute for bloody battles. 218 Sun Tzu writes: ‘Warfare is the Way (Tao) of deception.... Create disorder in their forces and take them.’ 219 He says that the enemy must be attacked when he is unprepared. 220 Sun Tzu II, inl uenced by Taoism, says that an enemy ten times superior could be defeated by following several stratagems, such as ‘Attack when they are unprepared, act when they least expect it.’ 221 One technique of deception on the battlei eld, for Sun Tzu, is tactical withdrawal. Sun Tzu says that speed is the essence of war. 222 As regards information warfare, Sun Tzu says: ‘Thus it is said that one who knows the enemy and knows himself will not be endangered in a hundred engagements.’ 223 Sun Tzu speaks of expendable spies who spread disinformation in foreign states. He writes that such expend-able spies should be given false information for leaking to enemy agents. 224 He emphasizes the importance of paying the spies well to prevent them from deserting to the enemy. 225 Sun Tzu II says that not using secret agents results in defeat in warfare. 226 T’ai Kung discusses the possibility of undermining an enemy ruler by encouraging corrup-tion within his state. 227 Around 236 bce , the Qin armies followed shih strategy. To prevent desperate resistance, the Qin combined military campaigns with bribes, deception and good governance of the con-quered territories. 228 Kautilya advises that a king should i rst indulge in mantrayuddha (a bat-tle of wits and diplomatic maneuvering backed by force) before resorting 216 The Lost Art of War , tr. by Cleary, pp. 42–3. 217 Art of War , tr. by Sawyer, p. 177. 218 Kane, Ancient China on Postmodern War , pp. 13–14. 219 Art of War , tr. by Sawyer, p. 168. 220 Handel, Masters of War , p. 121. 221 The Lost Art of War , tr. by Cleary, p. 29. 222 Handel, Masters of War , pp. 90, 124. 223 Art of War , tr. by Sawyer, p. 179. 224 Ibid., pp. 136–7. 225 Kane, Ancient China on Postmodern War , p. 147. 226 The Lost Art of War , tr. by Cleary, p. 43. 227 Kane, Ancient China on Postmodern War , p. 139. 228 Mott IV and Kim, Philosophy of Chinese Military Culture , p. 50.

Hence, for both Sun Tzu and Kautilya, unlike Clausewitz, destruction of the enemy force is a secondary objective; attacking the enemy’s plans and objectives is more important. 234 For Kautilya, Bhedopagraham copagantum refers to the capture of the enemy king through dissension in his ranks. 235 The Mudraraksa notes that Kautilya won over one of the ablest Nanda min-isters, a man named Raksasa, to the side of Chandragupta, thus com-pleting the discomi ture of the Nandas. 236 Raksasa became the principal minister of Chandragupta when Kautilya retired from political life. The Raksasa episode also i nds support in the Panchatantra , which was com-posed between the third and the sixth century ce . The point to be noted is that Kautilya’s kutayuddha , which comprises winning over the enemy’s commanders and councilors, was also practiced by the master during his lifetime. Sun Tzu II also speaks of capturing the enemy commanders by using unorthodox techniques. 237 Bhedopagraham copagantum and tusnimdandena are techniques of conducting kutayuddha . Kautilya emphasizes the use of spies to gather knowledge about treasonable elements within the state, and if necessary, 229 Subedi, ‘Concept in Hinduism of “Just War”’, p. 352. 230 Zaman, ‘Kautilya’, p. 238. 231 KA , Part II, by Kangle, p. 4. 232 KA , Part III, by Kangle, pp. 136–7. 233 KA , Part II, by Kangle, p. 342. 234 Handel, Masters of War , pp. 42–3. 235 KA , Part II, by Kangle, p. 337. 236 Kosambi, Culture and Civilization of Ancient India , p. 142. 237 The Lost Art of War , tr. by Cleary, p. 35.

Stationary spies deployed in enemy territory in these houses take advantage of their appearance to communicate information to them. Occasionally, the spies in these houses get orders from the secret service establishment through the above-mentioned roving spies, who claim to be relations of the servants and come to visit the latter in the houses. Another concept in the Arthasastra is samjnalipibhih , which means a code language used by spies for communication with each other as well for sending messages to their master. 241 In Kautilya’s framework, an attempt should be made to win over disaffected subjects through rewards. If this attempt fails, then the leaders among them should be eliminated through unorthodox measures, and dissension should be spread deliber-ately within the rebel camp. 242 T’ai Kung’s Six Secret Teachings emphasize that the ruler should encourage industry, commerce and agriculture in order to proi t the peo-ple, which will strengthen the regime. Shang Yang also says that in order to sustain warfare, a state needs to be strong, and for this, expansion of agriculture is necessary. 243 But Clausewitz is oblivious to the necessary economic muscle behind conducting warfare. The Arthasastra and the Agni Purana , like the Legalists, emphasize regular payment of the troops to prevent any dissatisfaction among the military personnel. 244 War making requires money. Kautilya notes: ‘The treasury is based upon mining, the army upon the treasury; he who has the army and treasury may conquer the whole wide earth.’ 245 Kautilya provides us with a picture of an all-pervading state. The bhaga (royal share) comprises one-sixth of the agricultural produce and one-sixth of the animal husbandry products. The sulka (import and export duties) is another source of royal income. The state derives monopoly charges 238 Mital, Kautilya Arthasastra Revisited , pp. 40–1. 239 KA , Part II, by Kangle, p. 22. 240 Srivastava, Ancient Indian Army , p. 101. 241 KA , Part II, by Kangle, p. 25. 242 J .

Further, the state takes fee income from issuing licenses to the prostitutes and liquor manufacturers. 246 To raise revenue for the state, measures ought to be taken for the expan-sion of agriculture. Hence, Kautilya advocates the settling of new villages with Sudra agriculturists. 247 Kautilya advises that the cultivators should be given seeds, cattle and money for expanding cultivation in the waste-land. 248 Kautilya says: ‘Agriculture, cattle-rearing and trade – these con-stitute economics, which are benei cial, as they yield grains, cattle, money, forest produce and labour. Through them, the king brings under his sway his own party as well as the party of the enemies, by the use of the trea-sury and the army.’ 249 T’ai Kung’s Six Secret Teachings emphasize the importance of mili-tary administration and this includes the administration of supplies. 250 Kautilya refers to the importance of state factories that manufacture arms and equipment for the soldiers. Kautilya emphasizes the role of logistics, especially when defending a fort against a hostile besieging army. 251 The Art of War warns commanders not to attack enemy cities except as a last resort. The Warring States period saw the improvement of the system of walls and towers used for defending the principal cities and sites that dominated the major transportation routes. Mo Tzu and his followers advised the rulers that construction of defence works would discourage predatory rulers from practicing aggression. Mo Tzu discussed engineer-ing and managing the civilian population during a siege. 252 Kautilya emphasizes the importance of puras (fortii ed settlements) and durgas (forts) in warfare. He says: ‘For the acquisition of a fort brings about the protection of his own land and the repulsion of enemies and forest tribes.’ 253 Shitasatru , in the Arthasastra , is an enemy with a fort, and kalamitra is an enemy without a fort. 254 For Kautilya, the former enemy is stronger than the latter. The characteristics of fortii cation were walls with towers. 255 The fortii cations of Patna during the Mauryan 246 Mital, Kautilya Arthasastra Revisited , pp. 32–3. 247 Kane, History of Dharmasastra , vol. 1, Part 1, p. 155. 248 Bhat, ‘Means to Fill the Treasury during a Financial Crisis’, p. 149. 249 KA , Part II, by Kangle, p. 9. 250 Kane, Ancient China on Postmodern War , p. 38. 251 KA , Part III, by Kangle, pp. 53, 128. 252 Kane, Ancient China on Postmodern War , pp. 61, 149. 253 KA , Part II, by Kangle, p. 353. 254 Ibid., p. 353. 255 Srivastava, Ancient Indian Army , p. 60.

Kane points out that there was cultural inter-course by land between Babylon and Punjab from the third millennium bce . Construction of surangas against enemy forts was a technique that the Indians learnt from the Babylonians and the Egyptians before the Greeks came to India under Alexander. 258 Long before Alexander, there was contact between India and Persia. An Indian contingent comprised of infantry, chariots and cavalry accompanied Xerxes’ army when it invaded Greece. 259 During the pre-Mauryan era, Indian mercenary soldiers from Punjab and the north-west frontier region accompanied Xerxes’ forces and took part in the battles of Thermopylae (480 bce ) and Plataea (479 bce ). 260 Hence, it could be argued that while some Greek military tradi-tions reached India by way of these mercenaries, some Indian military customs were also transmitted to Greece through these hired warriors. Kautilya and Post-Modern War One name for post-modern war is Fourth-Generation Warfare (here-inafter 4GW). The theorists of this sort of warfare focus on the stra-tegic interaction between intangible elements like moral and mental dimensions, organizational culture, and so on. The new millennium is witnessing intrastate rather than interstate warfare. Domestic factors generating identity politics are the prime movers in this sort of warfare. The objectives of the insurgents are existential and not instrumental. 4GW is non-conventional and non-military in nature. This sort of war-fare is characterized by very small independent groups and cells acting on mission-type orders, emphasizing maneuverability and a decreasing dependence on logistics. The goals of such warfare are psychological rather than physical. Hence, such wars are waged more on the moral and mental dimensions rather than on the physical plane. Such warfare aims not at the physical destruction of the enemy forces but at their mental and moral dislocation, with the goal of inducing paralysis and piecemeal surrender. The insurgents use all available networks – political, economic, 256 Kosambi, Culture and Civilization of Ancient India , p. 160. 257 KA , Part III, by Kangle, p. 66. 258 Kane, History of Dharmasastra , vol. 1, Part 1, pp. 220–1. 259 KA , Part III, by Kangle, p. 75. 260 Majumdar, Military System in Ancient India , pp. 46–9.

Thus, they aim to paralyze the target state from within. 261 Instead of calling it 4GW, one scholar terms this New War. One of the characteristics of New War is the privatization of warfare. This means that non-state and sub-state agents have seized the initiative and demili-tarized warfare. The latter phrase refers to the loss of the monopoly on violence by the armed forces, the dissolution of the distinction between combatants and non-combatants and the targeting of civilian popula-tions and the non-military infrastructure. While guerrillas have to depend on the moral and material support of the people among whom they oper-ate, the terrorists who are conducting New War do not depend on back-ing from the people but conduct the war by subsisting within the general populace and simultaneously targeting them. 262 A retired British general, Rupert Smith, argues that the globalized world is experiencing a new type of war, which he terms the ‘war amongst the people’. Smith writes: ‘So instead of a world in which peace is understood to be an absence of war and we move from one to the other in a linear process of peace-crisis-war; we are in a world of permanent confron-tations within which nest conl icts, potential and actual, as the various opponents seek to inl uence each other’s intentions.’ 263 Smith continues: ‘In i ghting amongst the people the ultimate objective is to capture the will of the people.’ 264 Michel Foucault accepts the assertion of Sun Tzu, Kautilya and Clausewitz that politics is the continuation of war. 265 Smith quotes Foucault: ‘Power is a relationship not a possession.’ In the war amongst the people, Smith continues, it is very difi cult for governments with their conventional armies to exert power, to use strength and to establish a relationship of advantage. 266 Thomas M. Kane’s assertion that post-modernism includes renewed appreciation for factors that remain forever unquantii able is acceptable. Modernism, for Kane, is the school of thought that is unwilling to accept the idea that nature sets inherent limits on what human beings can know 261 Frans Osinga, ‘On Boyd, Bin Laden, and Fourth Generation Warfare as String Theory’, in John Andreas Olsen (ed.), On New Wars (Oslo: Norwegian Institute for Defence Studies, 2007), pp. 173–5, 179, 183–4, 187. 262 Herfried Munkler, ‘New Wars: Characteristics and Commonalities’, in Olsen (ed.), On New Wars , pp. 69, 82. 263 Rupert Smith, ‘Thinking about the Utility of Force in War amongst the People’, in Olsen (ed.), On New Wars , p. 33. 264 Ibid., p. 34. 265 Heuser, Reading Clausewitz , p. 48. 266 Smith, ‘Thinking about the Utility of Force’, p. 33.

Modernists always emphasize progress and are unwilling to rely on intuition, inchoate personal knowledge or allegedly innate knowledge. The post-modern military thinkers focus more on human judgement, cre-ativity and holistic thought. 267 The distinction between modernist and post-modernist thinking can be traced back to the Enlightenment and the Romantic movement. Enlightenment thought claims that human behaviour, like the natural sci-ences, can yield analytical propositions that are valid like laws. By contrast, proponents of the Romantic movement assert that human endeavours at their core are creative and beyond rational analysis. The Enlightenment saw the application of reason and the scientii c method for understand-ing both the external world (planets, tides, geology, etc.) and the internal world of human thought and action. Enlightenment thought focuses on the scientii c method and empirical study. A principal assumption of the Enlightenment thought is that human behaviour reveals broad continu-ities and regularities. Historical events are not unique in their essentials but rather manifestations of universal rules or tendencies. Thus, system-atic knowledge of human behaviour and interactions could be envisaged. Further, the power of reason allows mankind to control its own destiny. With the Enlightenment, progress in human affairs became possible. 268 By contrast, Counter-Enlightenment (or Romantic) thought argues that actions and motives can be known only through personal experi-ence, since they derive from such imponderables as emotion, genius and fortune. The passions driving human beings are too powerful and human affairs too complex to be analyzed through rational theorizing. After a point, reason gives way to intuition, and empiricism to faith. Great achievements are products of inspiration and genius. War above all is a matter of passion, and its conduct cannot be made the slave of reason. Overall, the Counter-Enlightenment emphasizes an anti-materialist and anti-empiricist approach. 269 Alan Beyerchen asserts that Clausewitz understood war as a non-linear phenomenon, aspects of which are characterized by organized complexity. In a linear system, when the variables are plotted against each other, their relationship generates a straight line. Changes in system output are proportional to changes in input, meaning that the effects are proportional to their causes. System outputs corresponding to the 267 Kane, Ancient China on Postmodern War , pp. 4–5, 8, 103. 268 Smith, On Clausewitz , pp. ix, 53–4. 269 Ibid., pp. 54–5. "},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Hinduism and the Ethics of Warfare in South Asia98sum of two inputs are equal to the sum of the outputs arising from the inputs determined discretely, meaning that the whole is exactly equal to the sum of its parts. Linearity promises prediction, and thus control, in both physical and social systems. Linear systems do not take into account feedback, trigger effects and threshold events (tipping points). By con-trast, non-linear systems are characterized by random activities. In non-linear systems characterized by disorganized complexity, there are a large number of variables, and the behaviour of these variables is erratic and unknown. More important than the number of variables is the fact that a sizeable number of variables are interrelated into an organic whole. Most biological and social systems are characterized by organized complexity. Enlightenment philosophy portrays all systems as linear systems. 270 In an essay of 1805, Clausewitz, who was inl uenced by Romantic thought, claimed that it is misguided and dangerous to reduce war to a formal system based on measurable quantities. 271 For Clausewitz, a the-ory of warfare cannot offer a set of rules and regulations. 272 Further, he states: ‘In war everything is uncertain, and calculations have to be made with variable quantities.’ 273 On 29 September 1806, Clausewitz intro-duced the concept of friction. He wrote that due to the inevitability of friction, a commander cannot adhere to military plans. 274 Clausewitz rejects calculation and probability, because in warfare, for him, chance and moral forces play very important roles. The series of consequences, writes Clausewitz, that follows from any action are endless and therefore not accessible to human reason. 275 Clausewitz writes: ‘No other human activity is so continuously or universally bound up with chance. And through the element of chance, guesswork and luck come to play a great part in war.’ 276 He continues: ‘In short, absolute, so-called mathematical, factors never i nd a i rm basis in military calculations. From the very start there is an interplay of probabilities, good luck and bad that weaves its way throughout the length and breadth of the tapestry. In the whole range of human activities, war most closely resembles a game of cards.’ 277 He further emphasizes: 270 Beyerchen, ‘Clausewitz and the Non-Linear Nature of Warfare’, pp. 47–51. 271 Smith, On Clausewitz , p. 5. 272 Heuser, Reading Clausewitz , p. 11. 273 Clausewitz, On War , ed. and tr. by Howard and Paret, p. 136. 274 Smith, On Clausewitz , pp. 6, 11. 275 Strachan, Clausewitzs On War , pp. 50–1. 276 Clausewitz, On War , ed. and tr. by Howard and Paret, p. 85. 277 Ibid., p. 86.

War is the realm of chance. No other human activity gives it greater scope: no other has such incessant and varied dealings with this intruder. Chance makes everything more uncertain and interferes with the whole course of events. 278 Thomas Kane asserts that Sun Tzu’s The Art of War contains many strands of post-modernist thinking. Sun Tzu implies that a different com-bination of even a small number of factors can generate a large number of outcomes and that this is simultaneously a strategist’s greatest strength and his greatest weakness. Both Lao Tzu and Sun Tzu accept the idea that the interaction between opposing principles can produce so many out-comes that no mortal could appreciate the full range of options inherent in any situation. It seems that the two above-mentioned Chinese theorists are referring to warfare as a non-linear system. 279 Machiavelli acknowledges Fortuna’s power but says that if people and states become powerful, then they to a large extent cease to be helpless toys in Fortuna’s hands. 280 Unlike Clausewitz, but like Antoine de Jomini (1779–1869), Kautilya to a great extent attempts to understand warfare through a set of rigid principles that would guarantee success. By con-trast, Clausewitz views war largely as unmanageable, uncertain, unpre-dictable and messy. 281 Nevertheless, to some extent Kautilya, like Sun Tzu and Clausewitz, pushes post-modernist strands of ideas in his work. Both Sun Tzu and Clausewitz, 282 unlike Kautilya, assume that states are the primary actors in war. In Kautilya’s paradigm, however, intra-state war is more important than inter-state war. The state suffers due to vyasanas (calamities). Vyasanas , says Kautilya, are of two types: those caused by human error and those caused by divine factors. ‘Divine fac-tors’ means not religious factors but those extraneous factors that are beyond the control of the human beings. Divine calamities also occur due to bad luck. Examples of divine calamities include l ood, drought, and so on. Human calamities, on the other hand, occur due to the bad policies of the ruling elite. 283 278 Ibid., p. 101. 279 Kane, Ancient China on Postmodern War , pp. 122–3. 280 Gilbert, ‘Machiavelli’, p. 24. 281 Michael I.

"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Hinduism and the Ethics of Warfare in South Asia100 Kautilya’s prescriptions to a great extent follow what Rupert Smith characterizes as war amongst the people. Kautilya advises that it is best to wage war against an unjust king who has no public support. And it is wise to avoid war with a righteous king whose subjects will i ght vig-orously on his behalf. In other words, a king should march only against an enemy with disaffected subjects. Such a king’s subjects, weary of the unjust ruler, will not help their ruler and might even join in the war against him. 284 In case of divine calamities, Kautilya harps on the initi-ation of relief measures by state ofi cials in order to regain the goodwill of the populace. 285 So Kautilya is implying that, morally and practically, it is easier to conquer an internally divided kingdom that is rocked by kopa . As part of the kutayuddha , Kautilya notes that special cash pay-ments and prizes should be announced encouraging soldiers to kill the opposing side’s commander-in-chief and king. 286 Kautilya is aiming to eliminate the enemy leadership/brains by deploying small cells rather than by a mass deployment of force. Kautilya also hints at ‘biological warfare’ when he writes that the enemy’s food supplies and wells should be poisoned by secret agents. 287 In order to temporarily obscure the vision of the enemy, Kautilya says, ‘The leaves of putikaranja , yellow orpiment [ointment], red arsenic, gunja seeds and stalks of red cotton plant, made into a dough with the sap of asphota , kaca and cow dung, make a blinding smoke.’ 288 Rupert Smith puts a premium on the role of information in successfully i ghting the war amongst the people. He argues that we need information in order to know what the opponent is thinking, and we cannot change his intentions until we understand the mind of the formless, shapeless enemy. 289 Kautilya’s vijigishu sought power in order to control not only the outward behaviour but also the thoughts of one’s allies and ene-mies. 290 Kautilya highlights the role of secret agents, whose duty is to i nd out what the common people are thinking about the monarch. Besides reporting seditious activities among the people to the higher authorities, at times the secret agents are to dissuade the people from entertaining 284 Manoj Kumar Sinha, ‘Hinduism and International Humanitarian Law’, International Review of the Red Cross , vol. 87, no. 858 (2005), p. 289. 285 KA , Part III, by Kangle, p. 234. 286 Srivastava, Ancient Indian Army , p. 108. 287 KA , Part III, by Kangle, p. 263. 288 Ibid., p. 495. 289 Smith, ‘Thinking about the Utility of Force’, p. 40. 290 Boesche, ‘Kautilya’s Arthasastra ’, p. 15.

Ethics in Kautilyan Philosophy Both Machiavelli and Clausewitz consider war to be outside moral cate-gories. Military ethics, writes Hew Strachan, has no important role in their framework for studying warfare. 292 For Clausewitz, war is anything but humane. He is concerned with efi ciency in military affairs and not ethics. 293 D. D. Kosambi claims that not one iota of morality or altruism is present in Kautilya’s Arthasastra . 294 The name Kautilya is derived from the Sanskrit word kutila , meaning wicked, shrewd or astute. 295 Mudraraksa refers to Kautilya as kutilamati , that is, one with a crooked intellect. 296 It means evil genius. As regards the role of ethics in the Arthasastra , B. N. Mukherjee asserts: ‘The main objective of this treatise was to provide the king with the ideas and methods to rule and expand his territory without caring much for moral ethics.’ 297 However, we will see that there are elements of ethics in the thought of these realist thinkers. Machiavelli claims that one of the most powerful safeguards against conspiracies a prince can have is to avoid being hated by the populace. This is because the conspirator always thinks that by killing the prince he will satisfy the people; but if he thinks that he will outrage the people, he will never have the courage to go ahead with his enterprise, because there are countless obstacles in the path of a conspirator. Good governance is an important facet for Machiavelli. He says that a prince must want to have a reputation for compassion rather than for cruelty. Nonetheless, he must be careful that he does not make bad use of compassion. So a prince must not worry if he incurs reproach for his cruelty so long as he keeps his subjects united and loyal. By making an example or two, he will prove more compassionate than those who, being too compassion-ate, allow disorder, which leads to murder and rapine. 298 He writes: ‘The prince must nonetheless make himself feared in such a way, that if he is 291 KA , Part III, by Kangle, p. 116. 292 Strachan, Clausewitzs On War , pp. 88–9. 293 Smith, On Clausewitz , p. 46. 294 Kosambi, Culture and Civilization of Ancient India , p. 142. 295 Sil, Kautilyas Arthasastra , p. 18. 296 Kane, History of Dharmasastra , vol. 1, Part 1, p. 166. 297 Mukherjee, ‘Foreword’, in Sil, Kautilyas Arthasastra , p. x. 298 Machiavelli, The Prince , pp. 95, 103. "},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Hinduism and the Ethics of Warfare in South Asia102not loved, at least he escapes being hated. For fear is quite compatible with an absence of hatred; and the prince can always avoid hatred if he abstains from the property of his subjects and citizens and from their women.’ 299 Machiavelli continues that his behaviour must be tempered by humanity and prudence so that over-coni dence does not make him rash or excessive distrust make him unbearable. 300 Even Clausewitz warns the militarists: ‘Since war is not an act of senseless passion but is controlled by its political object, the value of this object must determine the sacrii ces to be made for it in magnitude and also in duration . Once the expenditure of effort exceeds the value of the political object, the object must be renounced and peace must follow.’ 301 Clausewitz did not allow for murder or torture of prisoners of war. 302 And Clausewitz never thinks of deliberately targeting the enemy civilian population as a legitimate war aim. 303 Traditional Taoism, writes Thomas Cleary, condemns militarism as both immoral and inefi cient. However, defensive, protective, peacekeeping and punitive operations are consid-ered rational and natural. Sun Tzu II also justii es judicious use of arms for pacii cation and the maintenance of law and order. 304 Strands of ethics are present in Kautilyan philosophy, but they are related to the realist stance taken by Kautilya. In the interests of the state, ofi cials and rulers might sometimes set aside religious considerations, but in ordinary times governance should be based on a balanced combination of dharma and artha . 305 Kautilya warns that during emergencies, the state might resort to extra taxation, but these measures should not be used fre-quently. The Arthasastra tells us that excessive taxation in the long run destroys the economic potential of the kingdom, 306 and implies that such a situation might give rise to kopa . Danda , which is the legitimate coercive apparatus of the state, for Kautilya, can be used for harassing, plundering and even killing the enemies of the state 307 but not ordinary peace-loving subjects. Kautilya emphasizes good governance especially with regard to the moderate use of force to prevent kopa .

The king, just with the Rod, is honoured. For the Rod, used after full consideration, endows the subjects with spiritual good, material well-being and pleasures of the senses.’ 308 Kautilya warns the vijigishu that an unjust use of power over his subjects results in kopa . The sastras have nothing against regicide if the ruler is unjust and fails to protect his subjects properly or oppresses them unnecessarily. Too much coercion by the ruler might result in the disaf-fected subjects joining hands with the foreign enemies of the state. Hence, the threat of a revolt by the people functions as a check upon the misuse of power by the ruler. In the i nal analysis, writes Kautilya, internal secu-rity depends on the contentment of the subjects. 309 In Kautilya’s paradigm, the objectives of the vijigishu are labha (eco-nomic improvement) and palana (protection) of his subjects. Kautilya tells that raksha (security) of the subjects is one of the principal duty of the ruler. 310 Though Kautilya was aware of India’s neighbouring coun-tries, he did not advocate that the vijigishu expand his realm beyond the subcontinent. In fact, his mandala doctrine refers to the circle of states within India, which ultimately should be brought under the control of a single ruler – eka vijigishu . P. V. Kane writes that Kautilya had seen at i rst hand the devastation caused by foreign rule. Hence, his ambition was that the subcontinent should be united under the rule of a strong but benev-olent chakravartin . 311 The objective of Kautilya’s vijigishu is to establish an empire encompassing all the regions between the Himalayas and the sea, but not the region outside the Jambudipa (the traditional name of the subcontinent). The expansion of the empire beyond the subcontinent is seen as undesirable, impracticable and unjust. 312 Hence, Kautilya is no mad militarist advocating world conquest. Like Kautilya, Sun Tzu implies that a victorious society should learn to live with the erstwhile enemy in a stable controlled insecurity. 313 Kautilya tells the vijigishu that even in conquered territories, he should maintain the existing social order. 314 In order to co-opt the people of the newly gained territories and to avoid causing any psychological shock, Kautilya 308 KA , Part II, by Kangle, p. 10. 309 KA , Part III, by Kangle, p. 120. 310 Ibid., pp. 2, 117. 311 Kane, History of Dharmasastra , vol. 1, Part 1, p. 223. 312 KA , Part III, by Kangle, pp. 2–3. 313 Mott IV and Kim, Philosophy of Chinese Military Culture , p. 9. 314 KA , Part III, by Kangle, p. 93.

However, Kautilya is not advocating absorp-tion in toto. He warns the vijigishu that unrighteous customs should not be followed but abolished. 315 There are ethical limits in Kautilya’s philosophy regarding the conduct of war that prevent it from progress-ing towards the concept of Total War. Kautilya is against harming non-combatants in enemy territory. Kautilya writes that after conquering the enemy king, the victor should release the prisoners and give help to the helpless and the sick. 316 Conclusion Neither Kautilya nor Thucydides and not even Clausewitz emphasizes the importance of the dialectic between technology and the conduct of war-fare. Thus we i nd Kautilya advocating the use of war chariots long after they have become outdated. Sun Tzu, Kautilya and Clausewitz neglect the role of sea power. Clausewitz was an army ofi cer, and his country, Prussia, was a state facing grave threat along its land borders. Moreover, Prussia had no colonies. 317 Hence, Clausewitz did not concern himself with the issue of maritime power. Both Sun Tzu and Kautilya, operat-ing in the context of continental agrarian-bureaucratic empires, failed to envisage the importance of sea power. Unlike Thucydides and Kautilya, Clausewitz ignores the origins of war and the interrelationship between warfare and economics. The post-modernist trend is most apparent in Clausewitz’s ideas, to a lesser extent in Sun Tzu and in Kautilya’s frame-work. By contrast, the linkage between internal security and external security – that is, between conventional and non-conventional/irregular warfare – is strongest in the Arthasastra , is comparatively weak in The Art of War , and is extremely limited in On War . Kautilya, Sun Tzu and Clausewitz are strategists of power. Power-politics determine everything in Kautilya’s paradigm. For Kautilya, the security of a state ultimately depends on the acquisition of power. Kautilya believes in the rational actor analysis when trying to formulate inter-state behav-iour. Like Sun Tzu, but unlike Clausewitz, Kautilya advocates following a multidimensional grand strategy rather than a purely military strategy for overwhelming an enemy. The Arthasastra opens a new dimension by 315 Negi, ‘Religion and Politics in the Arthasastra of Kautilya’, p. 17. 316 Sinha, ‘Hinduism and International Humanitarian Law’, p. 293. 317 Smith, On Clausewitz , p. 48.

When under-taking invasion of an internally divided kingdom, the conqueror should encourage internal rebellion in the enemy kingdom. At the beginning of new millennium, as the power of states is waning and intra-state violence and peace-keeping missions are becoming more important, Kautilya’s kopa , with its foreign interconnections and peace-war amalgam, holds all the more attraction for theorists of state behaviour.

Being weak entities, these polities were unable to harness resources and develop the administrative tentacles needed for maintaining standing professional armies. Further, the geographic isolation of India resulted in stagnation of the tactics and techniques of warfare. 1 Early medieval India seems to have had no military theory worth studying. By contrast, this chapter, on the basis of a transcontinental cross-cultural comparative analysis, argues that South Asia’s military system underwent innovation and that the acharyas generated sophisticated theories in tune with political and ecological conditions. We will deal with the various theories in a chro-nological manner. The i rst part deals with political conditions after the collapse of the Mauryan Empire. The second part deals with Manu, who operated at the beginning of the Common Era. The third part narrates the steppe nomadic intrusion and the military response (on the planes of both theory and practice) of Hindu India. The fourth part deals with Bana, who describes the political and military scenarios during late antiq-uity. The i fth part focuses on Kamandaka, who charts the political and military landscape towards the end of the early medieval era. All of these theorists were Brahmins of north India, and they composed their works for the monarchs who tried to carve out a pan-Indian empire from their bases in north India.

Christopher C. Rand asserts that the ancient Chinese philosophy of war concerned itself with the relationship between martiality and civility during periods of internal and external violence. There was an ongoing debate about whether violent means ( wu ), ranging from a show of force to peremptory attack, or non-violent means ( wen ) – including peaceful moral example, intentional yielding and ethical suasion – or a combina-tion of both was proper for dealing with chaos ( luan ). Ethical suasion included clever deception, false argumentation, and so on – that is, meth-ods that avoided battle. 2 From 400 CE onwards, in Western Europe, the church was regarded as the arbiter of moral behaviour and developed the Christian just war doctrine. The just war concept emerged in Christianity from the fourth century onwards when the Christians started to assume positions of leadership in the temporal sphere. The just war doctrine evolved to address the issues of defence of the homeland from attack, repression of criminality and protection of the innocent. 3 In India, it was mainly the brahmanical elite who tried to resolve the tension between dharmayuddha and kutayuddha . We will see that the acharyas not only evolved a grand strategy, like the Chinese military commentators, but also came up with thoughts on military tactics, like the ancient and medi-eval Western European theorists. R. Brian Ferguson asserts that the realist conception of the state as a unitary independent actor following a rational policy may not always be adequate. A polity may be seen as a potentially divided con-geries of people dialectically interacting with the larger social system. Ferguson makes a division between territorial conquest and hegemony. In the case of territorial conquest, the defeated rulers were uprooted and imperial garrisons were installed. In the case of hegemony, the local rulers, after being defeated, were left in place. A hegemonic pol-ity fails to stop the local strongmen from waging war. Ferguson warns that such a neat division between territorial and hegemonic political systems did not operate in practice. In polycentric states, the clear divi-sion between hegemonic and territorial states was absent. Even within territorially consolidated states, a weakening of the centre resulted in 2 Christopher C.

The concept of a strong state in late ancient and early medieval Western Europe has probably been overemphasized. 5 Political Conditions on the Indian Subcontinent around the Common Era Shailendra Bhandare, on the basis of numismatic evidence, asserts that there was no Sunga or Kanva empire. What happened in post-Mauryan India was imperial fragmentation and the rise of several feudatories. 6 The Greeks from Bactria, known as Bactrian Greeks, established a short-lived Indo-Bactrian Empire in Punjab that continued until 130 BCE , when it was destroyed by the Sakas. By 80 BCE , the Saka Empire in India had spread across Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and West India. The Sakas in turn were pushed into Saurashtra (Gujarat) by the Parthians, who ruled parts of west and north-west India during the i rst century CE . Around 120 CE , the Parthians were eclipsed by the Kushanas. 7 The Kushana Emperor Kanishka I (78–102 CE ) ruled large parts of west and north India. In 226 CE , the Sassanians of Persia destroyed the Kushanas. 8 In central and west India, the dominant power was the Satavahanas. However, none of these polities were pan-Indian entities like the Maurya Empire. 9 Romila Thapar claims that after the breakup of the Maurya Empire, the monarchical system, which increasingly leaned on religious ortho-doxy, tended to blur the concept of state; instead, loyalty was directed to the social order. The interdependence of caste and politics had gradually led to caste being accorded higher status than political institutions. Social 4 R.

The Bactrian and Parthian rulers were considered mlech-chas by the Brahmin intellectuals because these foreigners patronized Buddhism rather than Hinduism. 10 Mahayana Buddhism spread rapidly during the i rst three centuries CE. 11 Some Greek rulers however accepted Vaishnavism and Saivasim in order to legitimize their rule among the eyes of the common people of the subcontinent. Manu’s DHARMAYUDDHA The sutra literature emerged between 700 BCE and 300 CE . The dhar-masutras are concerned with society and deal with the social usages and customs of everyday life. Though the sutra literature deals mainly with religious matters, it also discusses the duties of the king, civil and crimi-nal law 12 and, in the case of the Manava-Dharmasastra (hereafter MD ) of Manu, even military law. The term Manusmriti was i rst used in 1503 CE . Hence, it is better to refer to Manu’s work as MD . Compared to previous dharmasastra works, Manu gives much more importance and space to rajadharma in his compendium of laws. 13 P. V. Kane asserts that before the fourth century BCE , there was a work on dharmasastra composed by or attributed to Svayambhuva Manu. There was also a work on rajadharma by Pracetasa Manu. The Mahabharata and the Arthasastra refer to these works. The above- mentioned two works constitute the kernel of the MD , which was recast by Bhrgu between the second century BCE and the second century CE . 14 A.

However, Manu is not the real name of that gifted person. His original name is forever lost in the mist of history. For this rea-son, we will continue to call the author Manu. He was probably a learned Brahmin from north India. Olivelle rejects the view that MD was the product of gradual accretions by countless people over several centuries, because the work rel ects a coherent structure and style that could come only from the pen of a particular individual. Olivelle goes on to say that the code was initially written down. 17 While Tripathi, Doniger and Smith accept the idea that Manu’s MD was composed around the beginning of the Christian era, 18 Olivelle asserts that the text was composed and written down between the i rst century BCE and the second century CE . 19 Manu’s text was a product of the brahmanical response to the rise of Buddhism and Jainism. Doniger and Smith claim that Chapters 8 and 9 are later addi-tions. 20 For our part, we will be concerned mainly with Chapter 7 . The brahmanical reaction constitutes the context in which Manu’s MD was generated. One aspect of the brahmanical reaction on the polit-ical plane was that while both the Nanda and Maurya dynasties were established by the Sudras, the Brahmins established the two succeeding Sunga and Kanva dynasties. After the death of Asoka in 232 BCE , the Maurya Empire started to decline. Brihadratha, the last Maurya emperor, was executed by his Brahmin general Pushyamitra Sunga, who subse-quently established the Sunga Dynasty around 187 BCE . The Sungas fought against the Bactrian Greeks in north-west India. A Greek invasion led by the Bactrian King Demetrios around 190 BCE was repulsed by the Sunga prince Vasumitra. In 75 BCE , a Brahmin amatya (bureaucrat) of the last Sunga ruler deposed his master and established the Kanva Dynasty, which continued to function until 28 BCE . 21 16 Michael Witzel, ‘Brahmanical Reactions to Foreign Inl uences and to Social and Religious Change’, in Olivelle (ed.), Between the Empires , p. 482. 17 MD , by Olivelle, pp. 5, 7, 19–20. 18 T ripathi, History of Ancient India , p. 73; The Laws of Manu , with an Introduction and Notes, tr. by Wendy Doniger with Brian K.

However, for the purpose of maintaining internal stability, Manu (like a modern counter-insurgency theorist) focuses not only on the use of force but also on polit-ical legitimacy. Manu’s policy was that the Brahmins should legitimize Kshatriya kingship and in return should receive the lion’s share of mate-rial and non-material rewards from the ruling regime. The rulers were dependent on the Brahmins both for legitimacy and for the practical purpose of running the administration. In Manu’s framework, though kingship is a divine creation, the king holds a sacred position just below the Brahmin. This is a challenge to the Buddhist doctrine of monarchy as a social contract, where the king is merely receiving the highest wages for performing certain duties towards the society. 22 Manu implies that the Brahmins are above the law. The MD advocates that within his realm, the monarch should act in accordance with the rules. Against his enemies, he should impose harsh punishments; towards his friends and loved ones, he should behave without guile; and to the Brahmins, he should show compassion. 23 Manu uses the concept of dharma both in the general sense of righ-teousness and in the particular sense of social conduct and legal rules. Manu accepts the laws of karma . Unlike Kautilya, Manu over-empha-sizes the role of dharma in statecraft. Kautilya advocates the idea that the king should pursue artha , kama and dharma in a balanced manner and that these three are interdependent. However, Manu ordains that if artha and kama go against dharma , then the i rst two ought to be aban-doned. In Manu’s paradigm, the dharma of the Kshatriya is protection of the people, which in turn requires taxation of the prajas (subjects) of the rashtra (state). 24 Manu emphasizes that the highest and ultimate source of all learning, which guides the ruler in governance, remains the vedas . The MD notes that the ruler should learn the timeless science of government and logical reasoning from the vedas . Hence, Manu advises the ruler to take spe-cial care to sustain the Brahmins engaged in vedic studies. The MD says that the monarch should provide the Brahmins with means of subsistence consistent with the sastras and protect them in every way like a father. When the Brahmins practice the sastras every day under the protection 22 Keith, History of Sanskrit Literature , pp. 443–4. 23 MD , by Olivelle, p. 155. 24 D.

The MD further states that even at the point of death, the ruler shall never extract any tax from the Brahmins. 25 Manu dei nes the polity as possessing the following i ve elements: ofi -cials, realm, forts, treasury, and army. Manu advocates the use of a mod-erate amount of force on the part of the ruler for maintaining law and order in the realm and for maintaining the chaturvarna system (fourfold caste system). 26 The chaturvarna system was the ideal, according to the orthodox Brahmin thinkers. In reality, during Manu’s time, there were sixty mixed castes. 27 Manu emphasizes the welfare of the subjects. He tells us that the king should employ trusted ofi cials to collect annual taxes, strictly follow brahmanical laws in his dealings with the popula-tion, and behave like a father towards his people. Manu warns against the dangers of over-taxation of the subjects in order to prevent any griev-ances among the populace and to preserve the economic prosperity of the realm in the long run. Manu points out the danger of bad governance. When a king in his folly oppresses his own realm indiscriminately, he is soon deprived of his kingdom and his life, along with his relatives. When his realm is well managed, the king prospers with ease. Manu says that punishment can be administered in a just manner only by a ruler who is honest and true to his word, who acts in conformity with the sastras and who has good assistants. 28 Manu notes the importance of a hierarchical state bureaucracy for surveillance of the people as part of good governance. Manu, like Asoka, was aware that state ofi cials occasionally oppress their subjects, which in turn alienates the latter and results in rebellion against the monarch. To prevent oppression of his subjects by corrupt bureaucrats, Asoka appointed a special class of ofi cers known as rajukas / dhamma maha-mattas to overlook the activities of the bureaucrats. The MD also speaks about the necessity of having a special class of ofi cers to supervise the day-to-day activities of the ofi cials. 29 As regards raksha of the King’s subjects, Manu notes that it is the duty of the ruler to maintain internal security in his realm.

If he fails to do that, he will lose legitimacy among his subjects. At the same time, Manu also warns the ruler that despite good governance, kopa may be instigated by evil-minded people. And the king should be prepared to strike at the evil-mongers silently. 30 Manu, somewhat like Kautilya, emphasizes the utsahasakti (personal dynamism) of the ruler for maintaining internal and external security. Manu enumerates the following duties of the king during battle: he should organize the troops in battle formation; he should rouse their i ghting spirit and inspect them carefully; and he should monitor their behav-iour even when they were engaged in combat with enemy troops. When considering external security, Manu accepts the mandala doctrine of Kautilya. The ruler, emphasizes Manu, should give attention to maintain-ing a stable mandala . Manu accepts the traditional doctrine of the man-dala as comprised of twelve states. 31 Pusyamitra (150 BCE ) reigned from Vidisa. The Sungas fought with the central Indian kingdom of Vidarbha (Berar, Nagpur) and the ruler of Kalinga. The Satavahanas (Andhra Dynasty) had their capital at Paithan (Pratisthana). The Satavahana King Simuka fought the Sungas as well as the Sakas in Sind. The Bactrian Greeks raided north-west India, and their raids penetrated into Ayodhya, Ujjain and even Pataliputra. Probably, the chaotic post-Mauryan political scenario encouraged the mitra-amitra-mitra scheme in the MD . 32 Manu was certainly no pacii st. Manu accepts that though he may dislike waging war, a monarch cannot totally ignore the issue. In fact, Manu says ‘ yodha dharma sanatanah ’, meaning war is the eternal law of the king. 33 As regards the duties of a just king, he, like Kautilya, offers the following advice. The king should try to expand his inl uence or at best maintain his kingdom. He should keep his military force in constant readiness, constantly display his might, and constantly probe his enemy’s weaknesses. Manu suggests the use of military force as part of coercive diplomacy or as a technique to deter a potential enemy state. The MD accepts the fact that the whole world stands in awe of the man who keeps his military force in constant readiness and that it 30 Ibid., pp. 161–2. 31 Ibid., pp. 162, 164. 32 Witzel, ‘Brahmanical Reactions to Foreign Inl uences and to Social and Religious Change’, pp. 458–9. 33 Quoted from P.

"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"Hinduism and the Ethics of Warfare in South Asia114is ultimately with military force, therefore, that the king should subdue others. 34 However, the use of bala remains the last and the ultimate option. Manu says that initially the policy of sama , dana and bheda should be pursued. When they fail, the last resort is to declare war. 35 Manu, like the ancient Chinese political and military theorists, is aware of the dangers of warfare for the king and the polity. 36 Manu notes that victory and defeat in battle are often uncertain. The king, according to Manu, should go to war only when he is certain of victory. He should declare war and launch the expedition when a calamity has struck the enemy. The MD continues that if the ruler believes that his subjects are exceedingly content and that he himself is overwhelmingly powerful, then he should consider waging war. If he believes that his own army is in high spirits and the opposite is true of his adversary, then he should march into battle. If the military balance shifts unfavorably, then, the MD suggests, the ruler should follow an appeasement policy. 37 At the strategic level, Manu notes the importance of forming coali-tions with allies for a common objective. Unlike Kautilya, who gives more importance to unilateral action by the vijigishu , Manu focuses more on coalition warfare under the leadership of the just ruler. However, the ruler should display l exibility towards coalition politics as the alliance must suit his long-term purposes. 38 Like Sun Tzu, Manu emphasizes overcoming the enemy’s intention and will by disrupting the enemy alliance through coer-cive diplomacy rather than destroying the hostile army in battle. 39 Manu says that diplomatic agents should use bribery and force, with the army standing in the background, to tear apart the enemy alliance. 40 The MD notes the importance of logistics in warfare. The king should i rst make the necessary arrangements to gather provisions for the 34 MD , by Olivelle, p. 159. 35 Ibid., pp. 160, 162. 36 The rulers and the bureaucrats of ancient China, steeped in Confucianism, believed in the myth of the supremacy and attraction of Chinese culture based upon virtue and grandi-ose material achievement. Diplomacy, gifts (somewhat equivalent to sama ) and a divide-and-rule policy (equivalent to the acharyas ’ bheda ), assumed the Chinese philosophers, would overwhelm the enemy. Sun Tzu states that warfare is a matter of life and death for the polity. Sun Tzu, Art of War , tr. with an Historical Introduction by Ralph D.

Then he should secure a base of mil-itary operations, deploy spies, secure the roads, inspect the divisions of his army, and only then march in battle formation. The superintendents of the villages shall collect food, drink, i rewood and so forth from the villagers in order to supply the king’s army. 41 Flavius Vegetius Renatus, the later Roman Empire’s military theorist, warns that a scarcity of pro-visions ruins large armies. So the greatest care should be taken to i ll up the magazines. 42 Vegetius notes: ‘Famine makes greater havoc in an army than the enemy, and is more terrible than the sword.... The main and principal point in war is to secure plenty of provisions and to weaken or destroy the enemy by famine.’ 43 The MD speaks of sastrasalas (magazines i lled with weapons and provisions for use by the army) that are run by the state. 44 When campaigning, the MD , like The Art of War , notes the importance of weather and terrain. 45 The scorching heat of the summer and the rainy season are to be avoided. The king is advised to start a military expedi-tion during November–December, or in the months of February–April, depending on his force structure. He should deploy chariots and horses and infantry equipped with swords and shields when campaigning on level ground, boats and elephants in marshy lands, and archers in areas covered with trees and shrubs. 46 As a point of comparison, the campaign season for the army of the early Roman Republic opened in March and closed in October. 47 Manu for the i rst time talked about amphibious warfare. Two coins belonging to the Satavahana rulers Pulamayi and Yajnasri bear the i gure of a two-masted sailing ship. One can infer that the Satavahanas main-tained a coastal or riverine navy. 48 Kalidasa, a poet of the fourth and i fth century CE, in his Raghuvamsa , notes that the Gauda (Bengal) kings maintained a riverine navy that controlled the river Ganga.

Seleucus, the ex-general of Alexander and ruler of Syria, invaded India around 305/301 BCE in an attempt to reconquer Alexander’s Indian provinces, which were then under the con-trol of the Maurya Empire. However, Seleucus was defeated at a battle fought near the river Indus. While Seleucus had to surrender north-west India and Afghanistan to Chandragupta Maurya, the Maurya monarch gave the former 500 elephants in return. Seleucus took them back to Syria. Some of them survived and were used to great effect in battles against Demetrius and Alexander’s ex-general Ptolemy. In a challenge-response dynamic, the Ptolemids also started using elephants in battle. 50 The Ptolemids of Egypt acquired elephants from the Upper Nile and the Red Sea coast. 51 Antiochus III of Syria invaded north-west India around 206 BCE . He received 150 elephants from an Indian ruler named Subhagsena and went back. 52 In 191 BCE , Antiochus of Asia Minor deployed elephants against the Roman army. 53 At Heraclea, King Pyrrhus of Epirus used elephants to frighten the Roman cavalry and then smash the Roman legions. In 289 BCE , King Pyrrhus deployed elephants against the Carthaginians. The Carthaginians were probably inl uenced by the Ptolemids in the use of war elephants. The Carthaginians i rst used elephants against the Romans in 262 BCE at Agrigentum. 54 Hannibal marched towards Italy from Spain in 218 BCE with eighty elephants. 55 In 197 BCE , at Cynoscephalae, the Roman commander Flamininus used elephants to smash the left wing of the Macedonian army of Philip. 56 Elephants were also used for warfare in South China.

At the tactical level, Manu notes that in the absence of a strong cavalry, a ruler should not undertake aggressive campaigns but rather follow an appeasement pol-icy towards the enemy. The MD notes that at the l anks, special units of reliable soldiers are to be deployed to avoid encirclement by hostile units. 58 Manu offers a strong critique of Kautilya’s kutayuddha on the tactical and strategic planes. The MD notes that the king should always act with-out guile. However, being prudent does not mean being inefi cient. Manu emphasizes constant vigilance on the part of the ruler to guard against fraud by the enemy. The ruler must not let the enemy discover any weak-ness of his, the MD continues, but should instead discover the weakness of the enemy. 59 Unlike Kautilya, who asserts that all alliances and treaties are pieces of paper that are to be torn up if necessary, Manu emphasizes the impor-tance of good faith towards one’s allies. The MD says that when the ruler has become extremely vulnerable to his enemy’s forces, he should quickly seek asylum with a strong and righteous king. Should that king keep both his own subjects and the forces of his enemy in check, he should serve him obediently with all his strength. Even in that case, however, if he notices a liability resulting from his asylum, he should resort to the just war without hesitation. 60 Manu elaborates the normative model for i ghting prakasayuddha , which is a constituent of dharmayuddha : When challenged by rivals – whether they are stronger, weaker, or of equal strength ... a king must never back away from battle, recalling the Law of Kshatriyas. Refusal to turn back in battle, protecting the subjects, and obedient service to Brahmins – for kings, these are the best means of securing happiness. When kings i ght each other in battles with all their strength, seeking to kill each other and refusing to turn back, they go to heaven. When he is engaged in battle, he must never slay his enemies with weapons that are treacherous, barbed, or laced with poison, or whose tips are ablaze with i re.

When a man is killed in battle by the enemy as he turns tail frightened, he takes upon himself all the evil deeds committed by his master. 61 Like the Arthasastra , rather than battle, the MD advocates fortress warfare. In Western Europe, the Franks also pursued a defensive strategy based on a network of forts in order to defeat the principal military threat posed by the Vikings. 62 The MD notes that when a king launches a military expedi-tion against the realm of an enemy, he should advance towards the enemy’s fort. As regards the construction of forts, Manu notes that a fortress can be secured by a desert, or with an earthen rampart, or may be surrounded by water. In addition, forts can be protected by a forest, or located at the top of a hill. In Manu’s paradigm, the giridurga (hill fort) is the best. The best way to defend a fort is by stationing archers in the ramparts, and the fort should be well stocked with weapons, money, grain, artisans, machines, fodder, and water in order to withstand a long siege. 63 In the alluvial zones, the forts were constructed with bricks, and in the rocky places with stones. Jean Deloche opines that the indige-nous tradition emphasized a massive structure – a system of protection based on accumulation and enormity of obstacles to assailants – and thought that such entrenchments guaranteed security. Fortii cations constructed in accordance with indigenous styles have massive and compact earthen walls, with a baked brick or stone facing, surrounded by wide and deep ditches. These ramparts are in some cases rein-forced at regular intervals by solid towers. The gateways are elaborate and the openings strengthened with powerful towers, with an open courtyard. 64 The Greek and Kushana styles were different. The Kushanas intro-duced Central Asian traditions of fortii cations on the subcontinent. The chief features were curtain walls pierced with long loopholes and hollow semicircular towers. In the Greco-Buddhist representations, the curtain walls are pierced by triangular loopholes, and the parapets are made of merlons. The little projecting towers are either rectangular or semicircular 61 Ibid., p. 159. My translation is slightly different from that of Olivelle. 62 Bernard S.

Ahichatra, the ancient capital of the Pancalas in the Bareilly district of Uttar Pradesh, is located in a l at region. Initially built of mud around 100 BCE , the rampart was raised with a brick wall protected by a mud cover. The towers are rectangular in shape. 66 The rampart was constructed by digging out mud from the ditch and heaping it onto the banks. 67 At Rajgir, the rampart was built with massive undressed stones carefully i t-ted and bonded together with a core composed of smaller blocks without mortar. The inside of the wall is provided with stairs or ramps for giving access to the top and is l anked by rectangular towers. This rampart was built before the i fth century BCE . Between the i fth century BCE and the i rst century CE , a new town to the north was surrounded by a thick ram-part in the shape of an irregular pentagon and strengthened by a ditch. This earthen rampart is revetted with bricks. Kausambi is situated on the left bank of the Jamuna River in Uttar Pradesh. It was inhabited between the i rst millennium BCE and the sixth century CE . The rampart is quad-rilateral in shape. 68 Srikap, in Pakistan’s Punjab, was founded by the Indo-Greeks during the second century BCE . The wall is composed of rubble in mud revet-ted with hard limestone. The wall is strengthened at irregular intervals by solid rectangular towers, 7.7 meters wide and projecting 8.3 meters but with towers at the corners, pentagonal in shape, 15 meters wide and projecting 20 meters on the outside. Several types of fortii cations are depicted in bas reliefs – rectangular towers, towers topped with hemi-spherical domes and towers with loopholes above the curtain walls – in Amaravati during the second century CE . A relief at the south gate of Sanchi Stupa shows the siege of the Kusinara fort. The walls have specially built constructions that functioned as shooting posts for the archers. This development in fortii cation style is known as Indrakosa . Mathura, in Uttar Pradesh, is situated on the bank of the Jamuna.

In addition to wet ditches outside the walls, the forts were strengthened by the construction of citadels. 72 Due to the strength inherent in a fort, Manu, instead of a costly frontal assault, points to the various upayas that could be followed by an invad-ing army laying siege to a fort. After laying siege to the enemy fort, the king should plunder the enemy realm and ruin the latter’s supplies of fod-der, food and water by demolishing the reservoirs, ramparts and moats. In addition, surprise assaults should be launched against the enemy, par-ticularly at night. Further, sedition should be fomented in the enemy party to encourage desertion. 73 As regards the distribution of war booty, Manu comes up with several laws. Whatever a soldier wins – chariot, horse, elephant, money, grain, livestock, women or base metal – all that belongs to him. A preemptive share, however, should be given to the king in accordance with the vedic scripture. Ultimately, Manu advocates establishing a ‘just peace’. The MD says that after the victory, the victor should grant exemptions and issue proclamations of amnesty. 74 In Manu’s text, political power is considered inferior to priestly ide-als and rituals. However, Manu never says that the Brahmins should 69 Ibid., pp. 32–3, 37, 41, 43, 80. 70 Billau and Graczyk, ‘Hannibal’, p. 337. 71 Gabriel, Great Armies of Antiquity , p. 227. 72 Bernard S.

Though Manu constructs a norma-tive model for dharmayuddha during a battle, for siege warfare Manu incorporates at least two elements of kutayuddha : pillaging enemy coun-try surrounding the fort, and launching surprise night attacks. Overall, Manu succeeds in propounding a theory for maintaining internal order but fails to address the problem of external invasion as posed by the ‘ mlechchas ’. Manu’s normative model of conducting dharmayuddha reduced the combat effectiveness of the Hindu armies. Archaeological references note the legacy of MD . An inscription of the Valabhi King Dharasena, dated 571 CE , says that the rules made by Manu were obeyed by this king. 75 The Steppe Nomads and the Changing Character of Warfare Despite the uselessness of the chariots in the Battle of Hydaspes, Manu continues to emphasize their importance in warfare. To be fair to Manu, he realized the importance of horses in warfare. Due to the intervention of the Central Asian steppe nomads, the importance of war horses rose in the subcontinent. Between the i fth and seventh centuries BCE , the bit, bridle, headstall and reins, together with the form of the S-shaped cheek bars and saddles, were developed by the steppe nomads. 76 The classical Greeks encountered the Scythian mounted archers, who were equipped with compound bows and dressed in breeches, high shoes and riding caftans with long sleeves. The Sarmatians in the age of Roman Emperor Trajan (98–117 CE ) were equipped with the same compound bow. The horsemen of classical Greece were equipped with swords and shields. 77 Around 150 BCE , the Roman cavalry adopted the Greek lance and shield. The Roman cavalryman was protected by a leather cuirass and carried a short thrusting spear. 78 In the coins of the Greek, Scythian and Parthian invaders of India, the cavaliers were shown clad in chain mail armour. The Scythians introduced into India the heavy cavalry: cavaliers equipped with bows and lances and 75 Kane, History of Dharmasastra , vol. 1, Part I, p. 328. 76 Chauncey S.

The Huns occupied Bactria around 350 CE. The Huns (also known as the White Hunas or Ephthalites) established their base at Herat in Afghanistan and started attacking Persia and India. The defeat of the Persian Emperor Firoz in 480 CE resulted in the breakup of the Sassanian realm. 81 Between 420 and 550 CE , the Huns attacked India. 82 The Huns captured Gandhara in 454 CE and moved into west Punjab. 83 The Gupta Empire lasted from 320 CE until 550 CE . The Gupta Empire was founded by Chandragupta I Samudragupta (ruler from 335 to 375 CE ), who made a raid into south India but did not annex those regions. This was probably due to the huge distance and bad communications with the central part of north India (the core of his empire), which made direct administration of peninsular India difi cult if not impossible. Secondly, in accordance with dharmayuddha , Samudragupta probably invaded south India for the purpose of getting glory and performing asvamedha sac-rii ce. 84 The Gupta Empire’s direct administration extended over north, central and west India. The principal threat faced by the Gupta Empire was nomadic invasion by the Sakas and the Huns. R. K. Mookerji asserts that Chandragupta II Vikramaditya (ruler from 380 to 414 CE ) crossed the Indus and its i ve mouths (the Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Beas and Sutlej rivers) and invaded Vahlika (Balkh/Bactria). 85 This expedition was prob-ably a preemptive attempt by Chandragupta Vikramaditya to protect the north-west frontier passes through which the steppe nomads tradition-ally invaded India. The Huns attacked India during the reign of Gupta Emperor Kumaragupta (ruler from 414 to 455 CE ). 86 Skandagupta (Gupta emperor 79 Majumdar, Military System in Ancient India , pp. 79, 90. 80 Bhandare, ‘Numismatics and History’, p. 74. 81 Ashvini Agrawal, Rise and Fall of the Imperial Guptas (New Delhi: Motilal Banarasidas, 1989 ), pp. 165, 212–13, 240. 82 The Harshacarita of Banabhatta with Exclusive Notes (Uchchhvasas I–VIII) , ed. with an Introduction and Notes by P.

Skanda was also able to defeat the Sakas in Gujarat. 87 The Hun chief Toramana moved into the Salt Range of the Jhelum district. 88 Only in 510 CE , under the Gupta Emperor Bhanugupta, was Toramana able to defeat the Gupta General Goparaja at the Battle of Eran fought at Malwa. 89 How can the Gupta success against the Huns until 510 ce be explained? The Gupta army recruited from the traditional four sources: maula (families who supplied soldiers through several generations), bhrta (mercenaries), mitra (troops of the allies) and sreni (troops maintained by the various guilds). 90 The Mandasore Inscription of Kumaragupta and Bandhuvarman records that members of the silk weaver’s guild were expert in archery. Many Brahmins joined the army. Kumaragupta had a Brahmin general named Prthivisena. 91 Kalidasa’s Raghuvamsa gives a generalized picture of force struc-tures and combat between Raghu and the yavanas of north-west India. Kalidasa’s description of Raghu’s conquest shows that the author was intimately acquainted with the pearl i sheries of Tamraparni, the deo-dars of the Himalayas, the betel nuts and coco palms of Kalinga and the sand of Sind. In his works, Kalidasa accepts the brahmanical sys-tem and the asvamedha yagna by the victorious sovereign. According to Keith, Kalidasa lived in the i fth century CE . 92 Kalidasa writes that the Hindu soldiers generally fought with lances, battle axes, spears, and so on. 93 Kalidasa says that the yavanas mainly depended on mounted archers. The principal advantage of possessing a horse in the battlei eld, he says, is that it confers speed to the cavalier. The mobile cavalry of the yavanas / Turangas created terror among the samantara-jas . Hence, Raghu also deployed many mounted archers. When the mounted archers launched their barrage of arrows, the sky became dark. Though the yavanas were encased in armour, they still fell vic-tim to the barrage of arrows. When the mounted archers dislocated the yavana formation, Raghu’s heavy cavalry, equipped with bhallas (heavy spears), charged the yavanas . Raghu with his victorious cavalry 87 Mookerji, Gupta Empire , pp. 92–3. 88 Agrawal, Rise and Fall of the Imperial Guptas , p. 242. 89 Mookerji, Gupta Empire , p. 120. 90 Ibid., p. 100; Majumdar, Military System in Ancient India , p. 88. 91 Chakravarti, Art of War in Ancient India , pp. 6, 79. 92 Keith, History of Sanskrit Literature , pp. 80, 82. 93 Majumdar, Military System in Ancient India , p. 89.

Raghu acquired many good horses as tribute from the country of Kamboja. 94 Raghu also fought the Persians, who are described as bearded men equipped with bows. The Raghuvamsa continues that the Kalinga army, com-prised of elephants and foot archers, was defeated. Then Raghu went to Kamarup and acquired elephants. 95 Like the epics and the Bhagavad Gita , the Raghuvamsa states that those soldiers who died on the bat-tlei eld ascended to heaven. 96 Ashvini Agrawal asserts that under Chandragupta Vikramaditya, the Gupta army became cavalry-centric. 97 Such a transition probably occurred in the armies of the other great powers of Eurasia as well. During the early days of the Roman Empire, the ratio of cavalry to infantry was 1:12, but in the late fourth century, the ratio became 1:3. 98 The Raghuvamsa por-trays the presence of heavy cavalry (cavaliers armed with bhallas and bows and protected by armour) in the Gupta army. 99 In Kashmir, some brick tiles that can be dated to the third century CE show horsemen in armour riding accoutred horses at full gallop and drawing their bows. The quivers are attached to the saddles. The coins of the Pahlava rulers of north-west India also depict mounted archers. 100 Under the inl uence of the Sakas, Parthians and Kushanas, the Guptas took up mounted horse archery. Several Gupta emperors are depicted on their coins on horseback equipped with the nomadic bows. The horses were richly caparisoned, and these coins were issued from the reign of Chandragupta Vikramaditya onwards. Murray B. Emeneau claims that the Guptas used the Scythian/Sassanian-type curved bows. These bows were introduced onto the subcontinent by the Saka, Parthian and Kushana invaders. 101 The Sanchi sculptures (some of which can be dated to the end of the i rst century BCE ) show composite bows. 102 The 94 Mahakabi Kalidasa Birachitam , Raghuvamsam , Chaturtha Sarga , 62, 64, 67, 70–1, Sastha Sarga , 33, Nabam Sarga , 56, pp. 79–81, 107, 163. 95 Keith, History of Sanskrit Literature , pp. 93–4. 96 U.

He says that the reliefs and sculptures of Barhut and Sanchi show the use of the loop stirrup by the Hindus. The Huns rode without stirrups; hence the rider had an unsteady seat, and the mount could function only as a precarious weapon platform. Due to the use of the loop stirrup, the Gupta cavaliers were able to press a charge and engage in close-quarter combat. By contrast, the Hun cavaliers, without stirrups, could easily be pulled down from their horses in close-quarter combat. For implement-ing a cavalry charge and close-quarter combat, the Guptas introduced heavy cavalry, which meant that the riders wore knee-length chain mail, and the horses were also covered with plate armour. The Gupta heavy cavalry, equipped with lances, was able to deliver a compact close-order charge. In addition, the Guptas also had light cavalry. The riders belong-ing to the light cavalry wore only a padded jacket and were equipped with bows and arrows. 104 According to Robin D. S. Yates, stirrups were introduced on the Eurasian steppes between 200 BCE and 300 CE . 105 In Denis Sinor’s view, the earliest known representations of the stirrup come from Korea and Japan and can be dated to the fourth and i fth century CE . He argues that the Huns (370–450 CE ) did not use stirrups, but their use was known to the Avars (the Juan-Juan of the inner Asian steppes) during the sixth century CE . From the Avars, the Byzantines learnt the use of stirrups. Even in the early seventh century CE , stirrups were not used in Iran. 106 By contrast, John W. Eadie claims that stirrups were known in south Russia during the i rst century CE . 107 Mounted archery vanished from the Hindu armies after the demise of the Guptas. One factor was that the ecology of India was not suitable for breeding good horses. Rudi Paul Lindner forcefully argues that the lack of adequate grassland in central and west Europe prevented the Huns from attacking the Western Roman Empire with large numbers of mounted 103 Thapliyal, ‘Weapons, Fortii cations and Military Training in Ancient India’, p. 106. 104 Sandhu, Military History of Ancient India , p. 372. 105 Robin D.

"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"Hinduism and the Ethics of Warfare in South Asia126archers. West of the Carpathian Mountains, the grassland of Hungary could at best support only 15,000 horsemen. Each mounted archer, for full efi ciency, needed to be accompanied by ten to eighteen horses, and each steppe horse required twenty-i ve acres of pasture annually. Due to the small number of horse archers that Attila could mobilize against the Western Roman Empire, the Hun leader could launch only plundering raids and could not employ the large mobile force needed for complete destruction of the Roman armies. Hence, the ecology of Western Europe limited the effectiveness of the Hunnic cavalry army. 108 This also applies to the case of the subcontinent. South Asia east of Indus lacks grasslands, and the densely populated, paddy-cultivated river valleys were not suit-able for breeding horses. Secondly, mounted archery could only be performed creditably by the steppe nomads. The steppe nomads from their childhood learnt the art of riding and shooting from horseback for the purpose of hunting. Between 520 and 535 CE Toramana’s son Mihirakula was engaged in attacking Kashmir. Interestingly, besides keeping cavalry, Mihirakula also main-tained a large number of elephants in his army. The Huns were becoming partly Indianized. Ecological factors partially explain this transition. In 532 CE , Mihirakula’s Indianized force was defeated in central India by a chief named Yasodharman. 109 The latter was a feudatory who had become independent of the disintegrating Gupta Empire. After the demise of the Guptas, King Harsa of Kanauj tried to resurrect a north Indian empire; our main source for this is Banabhatta. Banabhatta’s HARSACHARITA Harsacharita is an historical romantic i ction in akhyayika form com-posed by Bana in eight uchchhvasas . Bana was patronized by King Harsavardhana (604/6–47/48 CE ) of Thaneswar and Kanauj. Bana was the i rst poet to write the story of his patron in Sanskrit prose. The Harsacharita furnishes us with some historical details. However, Bana did not write as an historian but as an epic bard decorating his tale with fancy, fantasy and bits and pieces of romance and adventure. The akhyay-ika is an historical tale rooted in authentic tradition, and the outlines of the story are more or less factually correct. The Harsacharita is a sort of 108 Rudi Paul Lindner, ‘Nomadism, Horses and Huns’, Past and Present , no. 92 (Aug. 1981), pp. 3–19. 109 Agrawal, Rise and Fall of the Imperial Guptas , pp. 243–4, 246. "},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"From the Common Era to the Advent of the Turks127epic in prose, in the romantic tradition of wandering minstrels and bards. Bana created a new genre of prose romances by writing an historical tale, the biography of his patron king, under the title Harsacharita . At times, Bana becomes dramatic. Bana is a master of the puranic -historical tradi-tion. Overall, Bana utilizes all the rhetorical devices of kavya (poetry) in the writing of prose. Bana is a powerful prose writer. His work is charac-terized by his power of observing men and circumstances. 110 To sum up, despite being more a literary work than a history in the strict sense of the term, the Harsacharita contains a mass of information about ancient Indian society and military organization. In the i rst two chapters of Harsacharita , Bana gives some detail about his personal life and his interview with Harsa. The story of Harsa proper begins in the third chapter. Bana gives his autobiograph-ical account in Kadambari , which is a romantic novel. 111 A Brahmin named Kubera received high honours from a Gupta emperor. One of the four sons of Kubera, named Pashupata, was the great grandfather of Harsa. Pashupata’s son Arhapati had eleven sons, and one of them, named Chitravanu, was the father of Bana. His mother was Rajadevi. 112 Bana grew up in an intellectually rich domestic atmosphere absorbing the knowledge of all sastras . When Bana was fourteen, he lost his father; his mother had died earlier. Bana developed a wanderlust in his heart. So he left his home for a tour of north India. While touring north India, Bana became friendly with Krishna (not to be confused with the Hindu god Lord Krishna), the cousin of Harsa. One day in summer when Bana was sitting in his house after the midday meal, a messenger brought news from Krishna. The message was that Harsa would like to meet Bana. The meeting took place at the town of Manitara on the bank of the river Ajiravati. Harsa himself was also a poet as well as a dramatist and a lover of the arts. 113 Bana died leaving his romance Kadambari uni nished. The work was completed by Bana’s son named Bhusanabana or Pulinda. Bana was a contemporary of the poet Kalidasa. 114 Bana’s writings belong to a genre that marks a complete break with the genre 110 The Harsacharita by Banabhatta , tr. by E. P. Cowell and P. W.

Unlike Kautilya and Manu, Bana refers to historical events and historical persons in his work. Further, Bana, unlike Kautilya and Manu, gives lot of details regarding himself and his family. From Harsacharita , we get some glimpses of Bana’s attitude towards warfare, and he also describes the techniques of warfare. Bana, like Kautilya, writes that the mandala is comprised of friends, neutrals and enemies. The Harsacharita implies that Harsa’s realm, unlike the Maurya Empire, was a weak state. Harsa, unlike the Mauryas, seems to have lacked a standing army administered by a centralized bureaucracy. Bana says that the king must possess a vahini (army). 115 Bana describes Harsa’s camp as i lled with conquered vassal chiefs, and the royal army was accompanied by contingents provided by tributary chieftains. 116 This was not a unique South Asian development. The Roman Empire’s army was a standing professional force whose soldiers normally served for twenty-i ve years. 117 The regular army was supplemented by irregular levies. The standing professional legionary army vanished slowly but steadily during the later Roman Empire. About 25 percent of the army of the later Roman Empire was comprised of ‘barbarian personnel,’ that is men from Germanic and other tribes out-side the borders of the empire. 118 Western Europe during late Roman Empire was becoming feudal. The Franks and the Germans were set-tled within the boundaries of the empire and were granted land in lieu of military service. The inheritance of the land became hereditary, and in return the sons of the original grantees had to serve the empire mili-tarily. Besides these military settlers ( laeti ), many Celt and German tribes served in the Roman army as foderati (mercenary allies) and auxilia . In 405 CE , a Gothic king named Radagasius invaded Italy. After his defeat, about 12,000 of his followers were incorporated into the Roman army. 119 Justinian (527–65 CE ), the Byzantine emperor, used ‘barbarian’ tribal contingents ( foderati ), who served under their own chiefs. 120 In addition, 115 Harshacarita , ed. by Kane, Uchchhvasa IV, p. 9. 116 Harsacharita , tr. by Cowell and Thomas, pp. 55, 62, 298. 117 Brian Campbell, ‘The Roman Empire’, in Raal aub and Rosenstein (eds.), War and Society in the Ancient and Medieval Worlds , p. 219. 118 Wolfgang Liebeschuetz, ‘The End of the Roman Army in the Western Empire’, in John Rich and Graham Shipley (eds.), War and Society in the Roman World (1993; reprint, London/New York: Routledge, 1995), p. 266. 119 Peter Heather, ‘The Huns and the End of the Roman Empire in Western Europe’, English Historical Review , vol. 110, no. 435 (1995), p. 12. 120 Gabriel, Great Armies of Antiquity , pp. 261, 278.

Dharmayuddha demands that the realm of the defeated ruler not be annexed by the victorious ruler; rather, the kingdom should be returned to the defeated ruler after the latter has accepted tributary status and provided booty and tribute to the victor. Also, it was obligatory for the tributary ruler to provide his political suzerain with a loyal contingent during a campaign. 122 Kalidasa, in Raghuvamsa , says that the monarch Raghu, who was following the code of dharmayuddha, defeated and cap-tured Mahendranath, the ruler of Kalinga. When Mahendranath accepted the suzerainty of Raghu, the latter released the former and returned his kingdom without annexing it. 123 By waging dharmayuddha , says Bana, the just ruler should become the sovereign of the earth bound by four oceans. 124 Kalidasa says that dharmayuddha , which involves symmetrical warfare (i.e., cavalry i ghting cavalry, infantry i ghting infantry, etc.), can be waged against the monarchs within India but not against the yavanas . In fact, the Raghuvamsa does not mention the presence of chariots or elephants in Raghu’s force structure as deployed against the yavanas of north-west India. So Kalidasa’s implication in the Raghuvamsa is that against foreign invaders, the model of dharmayuddha is not applicable. Against the non-Aryan yavana s, kutayuddha involving guile and deceit could be waged even by a dharmik (law-abiding) king. The Raghuvamsa says that even a dharmik king like Raghu maintained spies. 125 Bana writes that Harsa’s ancestors ruled from Thaneswar (Haryana), while Hiuen Tsang, who was in India from 629 to 645 CE , states that Harsa’s capital was Kanyakubja. Hiuen Tsang visited Harsa in 643 CE . Probably, after the death of Grahavarman, Harsa absorbed his brother-in-law’s kingdom and made Kanyakubja his capital as it was more centrally located than to Thaneswar. 126 Chapter 4 of Harsacharita begins with the story of Prabhakarvardhana (ruler from 580 to 606 CE ), who is described 121 Bachrach, ‘Early Medieval Europe’, pp. 284, 286. 122 Harshacharita , ed. by Kane, Uchchhvasa IV, p. 8. 123 Mahakabi Kalidas Birachitam , Raghuvamsam , Chaturtha Sarga , 43, p. 76. 124 Harshacarita , ed. by Kane, Uchchhvasa IV, p. 43. 125 Mahakabi Kalidasa Birachitam , Raghuvamsam , Saptam Sarga , 37, Chaturdash Sarga , 31, pp. 126, 245. 126 Harshacarita , ed. by Kane, Introduction, pp. vi, xxx.

Prabhakarvardhana’s queen, Yasomati, gave birth to two sons – Rajyavardhana, the elder one, and Harsa – and a girl named Rajyasri. Rajyasri was married to Grahavarman of the Maukhari family and left for her husband’s place at Kanyakubja. Chapter 5 narrates the death of Prabhakargupta at the time when Rajyavardhana and Harsa were engaged in i ghting the Huns. Rajyavardhana was treacherously murdered by Sasanka, the king of Gauda. After Rajyavardhana defeated the ruler of Malwa (either in central Punjab or in central India), Sasanka invited the former for a peace parley. And when Rajyavardhana went to the camp of Sasanka alone, the latter captured and executed him. 127 This was an instance of kutayuddha by Sasanka. Chapter 7 gives an account of Harsa’s military expedition. Harsa crowned himself king and set out with a huge army. From the account of a Chinese traveller, we know that Harsa moved against the Gauda king with 5,000 elephants, 29,000 cavalry and 50,000 infantry. 128 As Harsa was advancing towards Gauda, Bhandin (his cavalry commander) joined him with loot secured from the defeated ruler of Malwa. Harsa put Bhandin in charge of the invading force and, along with a small contin-gent, went to the Vindhya Mountains to search for his sister Rajyasri. 129 Bana, however, does not give the full story of Harsa’s career. Since Harsa was Bana’s patron, Bana avoids Harsa’s defeat on the banks of the river Narmada or in the Vindhya Mountains at the hands of the Chalukya ruler Pulakesi II of Vatapi (ruler between 610 and 642 CE ). 130 The bat-tle with Pulakesi II was fought sometime between 630 and 633 CE . 131 Pulakesi’s army was comprised of cavalry and elephants. The cavaliers in his army fought with swords. 132 Harsa also met with other defeats in his career. In 618 CE , Harsa moved against Sind, but the expedition was unsuccessful. Around 628–30 CE , Harsa advanced against Dadda II, the Gurjara ruler of Broach. That campaign was unsuccessful, and Harsa also failed against Dhruvasena Baladitya, the ruler of northern Gujarat. 133 The early Christian just war tradition held that the use of armed forces for restoring a situation that had been violated by prior wrongdoing is 127 Harsacharita , tr. by Cowell and Thomas, pp. vi, 226. 128 Sandhu, Military History of Ancient India , p. 350. 129 Harsacharita , tr. by Cowell and Thomas, p. vii. 130 Majumdar, Military System in Ancient India , p. 95. 131 Sandhu, Military History of Ancient India , pp. 352–3. 132 J .

However, it should involve an open challenge to battle. The news of Rajyavardhana’s treacherous murder was brought to Harsa by Kuntala, a cavalry ofi cer who was a favourite of Rajyavardhana. 135 Harsa resolved to avenge the death of his brother. Harsa took a vow to destroy Sasanka and through Avanti (the minister for foreign affairs) send a proclamation to all the tributary chiefs that they should either ally themselves with Harsa or be prepared for war with him. Harsa’s commander-in-chief, Simhananda (who also served as commander-in-chief under Prabhakarvardhana), sup-ported his decision, and the commander-in-chief of the elephant forces, named Skandagupta (not to be confused with the Gupta emperor who had defeated the Huns), warned Harsa to steer clear of treachery and political intrigue. 136 Bana says that great persons even in dreams do not want to employ deceitful tricks. This assertion of Bana is somewhat sim-ilar to Saint Augustine’s (Bishop of Hippo in North Africa during the i fth century CE ) claim ‘the wise man will wage only just wars.’ But Bana, speaking through the commander-in-chief of the elephant forces, warns Harsa to guard against the kutayuddha that might be waged against him by his enemies. 137 Bana offers a critique of various forms of kutayuddha . Bana writes that Pusyamitra, despite being a Brahmin, behaved like a base-born when he executed his royal master, the Maurya Emperor Brihadratha, when the latter was inspecting the army in the parade ground. 138 So, a military coup is considered by Bana as a sort of kutayuddha . It is to be noted that even Kautilya, the greatest advocate of kutayuddha , is against the tradi-tion of mantris and senapatis capturing power by executing their royal masters. Bana is ambiguous about whether a commando strike for a good cause is justii ed. Bana gives the example of the Gupta Emperor Ramgupta’s army, which was surrounded in a pass at the border between Malwa and Gujarat. The Saka ruler proclaimed that he would allow the Gupta 134 Reichberg, ‘Norms of War in Roman Catholic Christianity’, in Popovski, Reichberg and Turner (eds.), World Religions and Norms of War , p. 145. 135 Harshacarita , ed. by Kane, Appendix A, p. 257. 136 Harsacharita , tr. by Cowell and Thomas, pp. 229–30, 240; Harshacarita , ed. by Kane, Appendix A, p. 257. 137 Harshacharita , ed. by Kane, Uchchhvasa IV, verse 1, p. 1.

In desperation, Ramgupta agreed. The Saka ruler was told that Dhruvadevi would visit his camp along with his female retainers. Ramgupta’s younger brother, Chandragupta, and some of his armed retainers were dressed as women and carried in doolies towards the Saka camp. The Saka guards allowed them to enter the Saka ruler’s private apartment. Then Chandragupta, dressed as Dhruvadevi, killed the Saka ruler, and Chandragupta’s retainers attacked the Saka guards. In the ensuing pandemonium, Chandragupta and his retainers were able to escape and return to the Gupta camp. The Sakas were demoralized, and the Gupta army was able to exit the pass safely. After this incident, Ramgupta’s prestige nose-dived and he was assassinated, probably by Chandragupta, who later became the Gupta Emperor Chandragupta Vikramaditya. Interestingly, Dhruvadevi became Chandragupta’s queen. Vishakadatta, the author of the political drama Mudraraksa , describes Ramgupta as kliba (impotent/unmanly) for failing to protect his empire and his wife. 139 Replacement of a kliba king who has failed to display paurusha was not considered kutayud-dha . Even Manu says that a king who fails to protect his subjects is not worthy to remain a ruler. Bana mentions that Harsa’s army marched when the astrologers accompanying the force decided that the hour of marching had arrived. This is in accordance with the tenets of dharmayuddha . Bana writes that occasionally the army marched at night with the aid of torches. 140 It is to be noted that marching and i ghting at night violates the code of dharmayuddha . The Harsacharita portrays the force structure of Harsa. Bana does not mention the presence of war chariots in Harsa’s army. Harsa’s army, like the Gupta army, was comprised of infantry, cavalry and elephants. 141 Bana emphasizes the importance of elephants in the royal army. Harsa obtained elephants as tribute and presents from vassal chieftains. Some elephants were also obtained by the forest rangers from the jungles. Finally, some elephants were taken by force from defeated hostile pow-ers. Bana tells us that the elephants ate trees along with mangoes and sugarcane. 142 Each elephant consumed about 600 pounds of green fodder 139 Ibid., p. 246; Mookerji, Gupta Empire , p. 64. 140 Harsacharita , tr. by Cowell and Thomas, pp. 249, 252. 141 Majumdar, Military System in Ancient India , p. 95. 142 Harsacharita , tr. by Cowell and Thomas, pp. 60, 68–9. "},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"From the Common Era to the Advent of the Turks133per day. 143 We can speculate that the demands of feeding a large number of war elephants gave rise to a nascent bureaucracy in Harsa’s empire. Bana writes that Prabhakarvardhana and Rajyavardhana defeated the ruler of Malwa and captured elephants belonging to the defeated ruler. Malwa, in central India, was a source of elephants. Bana says that the forest-covered Vindhya Mountains in central India were full of elephants. The newly captured elephants were trained for battle; the Harsacharita says that the elephants were used to smash hostile armies. Bana describes the iron-plated howdah on the back of the elephant; through loopholes in the howdah , the archers shot arrows at enemy soldiers. The back of the elephant provided the archers in the howdah the advantages of mobil-ity and height. The howdah was plated with iron for protection of the archers inside it from enemy arrows and spears. Harsa rode a female ele-phant while reviewing his army. 144 So the elephant also served as a royal command vehicle. The elephant was controlled by the mahout with the help of an ankush . 145 When the elephant became uncontrollable during battle, the mahout pierced the elephant’s brain with it. War elephants were used in early medieval China. In December 554 CE , at the Battle of Chiang-ling, armoured elephants carrying towers and guided by Malayan trainers were sent against the army of Western Wei by the Liang defenders. The elephants were turned back by a l ight of arrows. The Southern Han used elephants with towers. Each tower car-ried ten men. The elephant unit was effective during the Han invasion of Ch’u in 948 CE . However, in 971 CE , Sung soldiers equipped with cross-bows decimated the elephant corps of the Southern Han. 146 Bana, to a greater extent than Manu, emphasizes the importance of war horses. This was due to the Hunnic interlude that has been discussed ear-lier. Each elephant consumed a huge amount of green fodder per day. 147 So elephants could not be used for i ghting in the drier regions or in the semi-arid regions. Bana writes that Harsa’s stables were i lled with horses from Kamboja, Sind and Persia. The Harsacharita , like the Raghuvamsa , imply that Kamboja horses were the best. 148 The Raghuvamsa says that Persian horses were also good. 149 Like India, another agrarian bureaucratic polity, 143 Glover, ‘Elephant in Ancient War’, p. 257. 144 Harsacharita , tr. by Cowell and Thomas, pp. 70–1,130, 241, 257, 284–5, 304. 145 Mahakabi Kalidas Birachitam , Raghuvamsam , Chaturtha Sarga , 39, p. 75. 146 Schafer, ‘War Elephants in Ancient and Medieval China’, pp. 290–1. 147 Glover, ‘The Elephant in Ancient War’, p. 257. 148 Harsacharita , tr. by Cowell and Thomas, pp. 65, 257. 149 Mahakabi Kalidasa Birachitam , Raghuvamsam , Pancham Sarga , 73, p. 99.

Between the third cen-tury BCE and the eighth century CE , the agrarian bureaucratic empires of China failed to breed good war horses and attempted to acquire the best quality horses from the Central Asian steppe nomads, either through launching campaigns or through trade. The Chinese offered the nomads silk in return for horses. 150 The horses were fed, Harsacharita informs us, with durva grass. Bana writes that Prabhakarvardhana defeated the ruler of Gandhara. 151 Prabhakarvardhana probably obtained horses from Gandhara as tribute from the defeated ruler. From the Harsacharita it is clear that saddles were used by the cava-liers. 152 The saddle was used by the Roman cavalry from the late i rst century CE onwards. 153 Bana says that the cavalier had footrests as well as a cloth cushion attached with girths on both sides of the horse. The cavaliers were equipped with scimitars for close-quarter combat. 154 Richard Gabriel comments that the horseshoe was invented by the Celts and adopted by the Roman cavalry during the late i rst century CE . The Gothic heavy cavalry, equipped with lance and sword, used the saddle but not the stirrup. 155 Bana says that the leather quiver was made of bearskin. We are not sure whether Bana is saying that mounted archers equipped with compound/composite bows were present in Harsa’s army. Bana describes the cavaliers as dressed in tunics, waistband and trousers. 156 At that time, the Indians knew how to make garments from l ax, linen, cotton and silk. 157 Raiding and counter-raiding by small groups, both within the Merovingian kingdom and between kingdoms, dominated the post-Roman military landscape of Western Europe. The limited and localized nature of military affairs was punctuated occasionally by raids under-taken by enemies living beyond the frontiers of the highly fragmented regnum Francorum . Bernard S. Bachrach asserts that post-Roman Western Europe experienced mainly siege warfare. Owing to the central-ity of sieges, mounted horsemen rather than infantry played the decisive role in warfare. The Carolingian horsemen frequently dismounted from 150 H. G.

Overall, the medieval Western European commanders avoided a battle-centric strategy. 158 Bana writes about a special corps of infantry wearing turbans on their heads and equipped with sharp swords and daggers for close-quarter combat. They were adept at launching commando-style night attacks. Here, Bana is referring to kutayuddha . The Harsacharita tells us that the handle of the sword was made of horn and wrapped in a black ante-lope skin. 159 The Chinese infantry from the fourth century BCE used long swords. 160 Some infantry, Bana tells us, also wore body armour. 161 The foot soldiers of Japan until 500 CE wore iron cuirass with helmets. After 500 CE , the Japanese adopted lamellar armour from the Koreans. 162 Harsa’s army was anything but a lean and agile striking force. The Harsacharita portrays a royal army accompanied by nobles’ wives, grooms, camp followers and other paraphernalia. 163 The later Roman Empire’s military theorist Vegetius emphasizes the importance of sur-prising the enemy whenever and wherever possible. 164 A select corps of Harsa’s army functioned as a rapid strike force for surprising the enemy. When the king of Malwa (probably Devagupta, the ruler of central Punjab or central India) assassinated Grahavarman and imprisoned Rajyasri, Rajyavardhana, accompanied by Bhandin and a force of 10,000 cavalry, went to attack the king of Malwa. The main body of the army, comprised of elephants and contingents of the allied chiefs, followed behind. 165 Each combatant soldier required 3,500 calories every day. Under Marius (90 BCE ), each Roman legionary carried fourteen days’ rations, and each legion (4,800 men) had a standard complement of 400 mules for carrying baggage. 166 Among the Hindu theorists, Bana was the i rst to note the importance of camels for logistical purposes. 167 Camels were required when an army operated in the semi-arid or dry regions like Rajasthan, Sind and Afghanistan. During the seventh and eighth centuries CE , the use 158 Bachrach, ‘Early Medieval Europe’, pp. 280, 289, 292–3, 295. 159 Harsacharita , tr. by Cowell and Thomas, pp. 118–19, 292. 160 Yates, ‘China’, p. 28. 161 Harsacharita , tr. by Cowell and Thomas, pp. 122, 169. 162 W.

The commissariat ofi cials stored food in advance in the villages and the towns through which the royal army passed. Bana says that the villagers had to provide oxen and grain for the royal army. Manu also hints that the superintendents of the vil-lages were in charge of collecting supplies for the royal army. The villag-ers demanded protection of their crops from the soldiers, who spread like locusts over the region through which Harsa’s army passed. Blacksmiths accompanied the army for the purpose mending and preparing weap-ons. 169 Kautilya speaks of a superintendent of armoury who employed full-time artisans. These artisans were paid from the royal treasury; their job was to prepare and mend the weapons of the royal army. 170 Kalidasa, in Raghuvamsa , says that the soldiers were supplied with armour and helmets by the ruler. 171 Until the 1905 Russo-Japanese War, more soldiers had been killed by disease than by enemy weapons. 172 The Harsacharita gives us some scat-tered bits of information about the medical service. Bana writes that the arrow wounds of the Huns were dangerous, and those wounded by the Huns’ arrows had long white bandages on their wounds. 173 The ancient Sumerian and Egyptian medical texts discuss the treatment of broken bones. The Egyptians knew about the technique of applying splints to broken bones, and amputation was practiced by the Romans. Each Roman legion had a corps of medical orderlies, and most of the doctors were Greeks. 174 Harsa’s army also had elephant doctors for tending the huge pachyderms. For distribution of war booty, Harsa appointed impe-rial overseers. 175 Harsa was a Kshatriya. 176 Bana maintains that the duty of a ruler is to take special care of the Brahmins. 177 Here, Bana is following Manu’s line. 168 Majumdar, Military System in Ancient India , p. 88. 169 Harsacharita , tr. by Cowell and Thomas, pp. 241, 253–5, 262–4, 287. 170 B.

Bana, unlike Manu, did not accept the normative model of dharmayuddha because, due to the invasion of the steppe nomads, such a model was no longer operable. After the death of Harsa, the principal source for understanding the norms and tech-niques of warfare in north India is Kamandaka’s Nitisara . Kamandaka’s NITISARA P. V. Kane writes that Kamandaka lived around the third century CE . 178 The Nitisara of Kamandaka, also known as Kamandakiya-Nitisara , is mostly based on Kautilya’s Arthasastra and is believed to be a recen-sion of Sukra-Nitisara . Kamandaka’s Nitisara was composed, in the view of G. P. Singh, around 400 CE , during the reign of the Gupta Emperor Chandragupta II. The Sukra-Nitisara was probably composed around the fourth century BCE . 179 D. Devahuti claims that Kamandaka was a contemporary of Varahamihira, the astronomer and mathematician who lived around 550 CE, and says that the Kamandaka Nitisara was com-posed between 450 and 550 CE . 180 However, P. C. Chakravarti assigns the eighth century CE as the date for Kamandaka’s Nitisara . 181 Keith claims that the Nitisara written in verse was composed around 800 CE . 182 Most recently, Upinder Singh has claimed that Kamandaka’s Nitisara was com-posed between 500 and 700 CE . 183 We can assume that Kamandaka’s Nitisara belongs to the post-Harsa and pre-Islamic Turkish period. Kamandaka states that he considers Vishnugupta/Kautilya as his guru. Like Kautilya, Kamandaka also propounds Lokayata philosophy; ascetic principles and practices are marginalized in his work. 184 The Brihaspati Sutra , a work just anterior to Kamandaka’s Nitisara , also falls within the genre of arthasastra literature. While the Brihaspati Sutra overtly stresses the acquisition of i nancial assets by the king as a way to maintain strong rule, 185 Kamandaka, like Kautilya, includes politics 178 Kane, History of Dharmasastra , vol. 1, Part 1, pp. 164, 170. 179 G.

"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"Hinduism and the Ethics of Warfare in South Asia138and diplomacy along with wealth as ways to maintain strong rule by the vijigishu . Kamandaka believes that a just ruler’s power depends on the following trinity: the people, good governance and the army (for con-ducting dharmayuddha ). Kamandaka, like Kautilya, accepts the saptanga (seven elements) theory of the state. 186 Kamandaka frequently uses animal imagery to explain the various strategic scenarios. Like the Arthasastra , the Nitisara emphasizes the importance of daily exercise and drill for the troops. Both Kautilya and Kamandaka refer to six types of troops: hereditary troops, mercenaries, gild levies, soldiers supplied by the feudatory chiefs and the allies, contingents from the forest tribes and troops captured and won over from the enemy. Both authors refer to the existence of trading and craft guilds with their private soldiery, who were hired by the rulers dur-ing emergencies in order to meet internal as well as external threats. As regards the composition of the army, Kamandaka claims that mercenar-ies are more loyal than the sreni bala because the former are dependent on the king for wages. Kautilya and Kamandaka refer to the existence of predatory forest chieftains. 187 In Western Europe during the i fth and the sixth centuries CE , the military ofi cers became landlords and turned farmers and peasants of the land under their control into their own armed retainers. The retain-ers were bound by personal ties to their leaders. The net result was the growth of semi-private armies that engaged in brigandage. Many ‘barbar-ian’ chieftains also became landlords and pursued the same policy. The landlords’ power increased as they expanded their estates, which in turn brought more dependants into the fold. The estates of the landlords were further fortii ed by the construction of castles. 188 The Carolingian armies were comprised of war bands of nobles who engaged in raiding for pil-lage and plundering. 189 A somewhat similar scenario unfolded in north India after the collapse of Harsa’s empire. Comparing internal and external dangers, the internal threat is considered more dangerous. Hence, before starting an invasion of a foreign kingdom, asserts Kamandaka, the causes of internal disturbance should be properly remedied by the ruler through conciliation, rewards, 186 The Nitisara by Kamandaki , ed. by Rajendra Lala Mitra, revised with English transla-tion by Sisir Kumar Mitra (1849; reprint, Calcutta: The Asiatic Society, 1982), pp. i, iii. 187 Chakravarti, Art of War in Ancient India , pp. 3, 6–8, 9, 86. 188 Dick Whittaker, ‘Landlords and Warlords in the Later Roman Empire’, in Rich and Shipley (eds.), War and Society in the Roman World , pp. 281–3, 292–3. 189 France, ‘Recent Writings on Medieval Warfare’, p. 449. "},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"From the Common Era to the Advent of the Turks139and so on, and by looking after the subjects’ welfare. Kamandaka warns the monarch that a powerful ruler, apparently invincible, may easily be subjugated by his enemies if he lacks self-restraint. But a comparatively weak ruler who practices self-restraint towards his subjects, as prescribed in the sastras , never suffers defeat. 190 Like Manu, Kalidasa says that a just ruler should rule in accordance with the sastras . Kalidasa notes that the real father of the prajas is their just king who nurtures and sustains his subjects. Kalidasa adds that it is the duty of a just ruler to educate his subjects. 191 This sort of thinking further evolved into paternal despotism in Kamandaka’s theory. In verse 20, sarga 4, Kamandaka elaborates the concept of pater-nal despotism. Kautilya also expounds the concept of paternal despo-tism when he says: ‘ sarvatra copahatan pitevanugrhniyat ’. 192 As regards ensuring internal security, Kamandaka writes that an essential duty of the king is to protect the subjects of his dominion, particularly their gainful occupations (agriculture, cattle rearing, trade), which l ourish only under royal protection. Disruption of economic vocations causes the most dis-tress among the people. Kamandaka asserts that a just king should by all means protect his subjects, who in turn contribute to his kosa (royal treasury) by contributions in cash and in kind as part of the bhaga . He continues that a king, who governs justly, conforming to the vedic laws, acquires merits of Trivarga for himself as well as for his subjects. 193 Concerning the various types of insurgency in the kingdom, the Nitisara goes on to say that disaffection among the priests, ministers, princes, members of the royal family, commanders and chiefs of the army contingents stationed within the capital generates internal disturbance. Disaffection among provincial governors, wardens of the marches, mil-itary governors of the frontier regions, and chiefs of forest tribes also leads to large-scale disturbance. By conciliation and other relevant means (reward and punishment), as well as by creating disunion and dissension among the disaffected parties, insurgent leaders should be appeased or subjugated. 194 For maintaining internal order, Kamandaka urges the king to act, if necessary, like Yama, the God of Death. Kamandaka notes that those 190 Nitisara , by Mitra, pp. 33, 332. 191 Mahakabi Kalidas Birachitam , Raghuvamsam , Pratham Sarga , 24, Nabam Sarga , 2, pp. 25, 153. 192 Kane, History of Dharmasastra , vol. 1, Part 1, p. 250. 193 Nitisara , ed. by Mitra, pp. 7–8. 194 Ibid., p. 332. "},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Hinduism and the Ethics of Warfare in South Asia140powerful men who obstruct the growth of prosperity (of the state) should be wiped out using secret methods of assassination ( upangsudanda ). 195 In sarga 16, verse 21, Kamandaka, like Kautilya, points out the linkage between internal disturbance and external danger. Kamandaka elaborates on the origins of war. Economic gain is one of the motives for warfare. The Nitisara says that despite vyaya (economic expenditure) in the short run, an expedition likely to produce decisive gains and benei ts in the long run may be undertaken. But an expedition likely to involve the destruction of ksaya (men and animals) must never be attempted. 196 Plato and Aristotle accept the idea that war is a necessary evil, and they condemn those polis whose only purpose is war. Kamandaka’s view is similar, and he also criticizes the ativigrahis (aggressive warlords) who practice militarism. The Nitisara recommends avoiding the use of the chaturanga bala ; it is better to i ght with the treasury and wise counsel, that is, through the techniques of sama and dana . Hence, it would be wise to conquer (or win over) the enemy by the duly deliberated expedients of sama or by conciliation and dana ( kosa ). 197 Kamandaka regards war as the last option because the result of war is always uncertain. Similarly, Procopius (500–565 CE ?), the Byzantine historian, thought that Fortune plays an important role in the conduct of warfare. 198 Kamandaka’s argu-ment that organized violence should be used to keep the peace and that war is not something that a wise ruler engages in gladly, but only out of necessity, is somewhat akin to Saint Augustine’s (354–430 CE ) view. 199 Kamandaka says that war should be started only after taking into consideration all the possible factors as it is a very serious business. Kamandaka notes that a battle-centric strategy should be pursued when the vijigishu is coni dent of his superior strength. Otherwise, it is better to wage kutayuddha . Kamandaka writes that the intelligent ruler should plan his vyuha of the army considering the suitability of time and place. The composite vyuha , in which the different wings of the army (infantry, cavalry and elephants) charge simultaneously but separately, is called Asamhatavyuha . 200 Maurikos (539–602 CE ), the Cappadocian general who became the Byzantine emperor in 582 CE 195 Ibid., p. 368. 196 Ibid., p. 333. 197 Ibid., p. 365. 198 The Art of War in World History from Antiquity to the Nuclear Age , p. 347. 199 Reichberg, Syse and Begby (eds.), The Ethics of War , p. 71. 200 Nitisara , ed. by Mitra, pp. 405, 429.

To try simply to overpower the enemy in the open, hand to hand and face to face, even though you might appear to win, is an enter-prise which is very risky and can result in serious harm. Apart from extreme emergency, it is ridiculous to try to gain a victory which is so costly and brings only empty glory.’ 201 Kamandaka, citing the just war criteria, criticizes the linkage between military training and hunting, saying that it is unethical to kill innocent animals in a hunting exercise geared to improving military skill. Kamandaka, following Manu’s nor-mative model of dharmayuddha , writes that enemy soldiers who have turned their backs or have despaired of life or have lost their mobility (besieged from all sides) should not be struck down as they have prac-tically surrendered. 202 Kamandaka, like Bana, notes that the vijigishu should take steps to protect himself from kutayuddha being waged by his opponents. The Nitisara reminds one that a portion of the army, ready with weapons and led by a commander, should move around the camp area during the night, lest the enemy attempt a surprise attack. However, Kamandaka, unlike Manu and Bana, later notes that if necessary, the vijigishu must wage kutayuddha also. Kamandaka justii es the necessity of waging kut-ayuddha under certain circumstances. Kamandaka is urging kutayuddha as a means of limiting the impact of warfare. In Kamandaka’s paradigm, the impact of regular warfare (which comprised dharmayuddha ) on soci-ety is much greater than the impact of kutayuddha (comprising irregular warfare) on the social fabric. Kamandaka asserts that ultimately there is nothing unfair in war. 203 Kamandaka, like Kautilya, argues that it is quite ethical for the dutas to function as spies in foreign kingdoms. They are to gain strategic intelligence. Kamandaka, like Kautilya, notes the importance of battle-i eld intelligence for winning a war. 204 As regards the various upayas of kutayuddha , Kamandaka elaborates: ‘Enticing away the subjects of the enemy out of their fortii cations and ... cities and markets, villages and pastures [through secret agents] the cool headed vijigishu should plunder and destroy the dominion of the enemy....

In sarga 19, verse 62, Kamandaka advocates harming even the civilian economy of the enemy kingdom as part of kutayuddha . Instead of a battle-centric strategy, Kamandaka puts forward a strat-egy for subduing the enemy by harassment. Kamandaka advises the viji-gishu that an attritional campaign would dissipate his manpower and i nancial resources. He writes that when the enemy forces are found to be unprepared (or resting in camps) and/or in unfavourable places or situa-tions, the vijigishu should annihilate them by surprise attack. Even if they are in their own country, steps should be taken to plunder their realm. 206 Kamandaka continues: When the vijigishu is able to alienate the ... border tribes ... of the enemy through bribes and harassments, the elements of state ... of the enemy are also harassed, he should charge with his own heroic soldiers and annihilate the enemy. With the demonstration of a frontal attack [as a ruse] and making the enemy i rmly believe that [thus keeping the enemy forces engaged in that direction], the vijigi-shu should employ his heroic band of soldiers to charge swiftly [to surprise] the enemy forces from the rear. In the same way making the enemy concerned about his rear [i.e., making the ruse of a rear attack and keeping the enemy engaged in that direction] the enemy may be assailed by frontal attack with the best of soldiers. Similar methods of kutayuddha may be adopted on either l ank (right or left). 207 Kamandaka’s concept of prakasayuddha , which is originally part of dharmayuddha , also contains certain elements of kutayuddha . If the intention is noble, then elements of kutayuddha can be implemented at the tactical level. Saint Augustine noted that ‘the just war is waged by someone who has the right to do so because not all men have that right. Once an individual has undertaken this kind of war, it does not matter at all, as far as justice is concerned, whether he wins victory in open com-bat or through ruses.’ 208 The Nitisara says that the army deployed for battle should be comprised of the following divisions: centre, l anks with koti (elite) units at the outer l ank, and a reserve. As regards the conduct of prakasayuddha , Kamandaka writes of charging the outer l anks and the rear of the enemy force with special units. The ruler must concen-trate superior forces at the point of attack. 209 Vegetius advocates using a 206 Ibid., pp. 405–6. 207 Ibid., p. 406. 208 Reichberg, Syse and Begby (eds.), The Ethics of War , p. 83. 209 Nitisara , ed. by Mitra, p. 442. "},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"From the Common Era to the Advent of the Turks143tactical reserve. 210 The Nitisara advocates keeping koti units as a tactical reserve for conducting l ank attacks on the enemy. 211 So, according to Kamandaka’s battle-winning tactics, the special units of the wings should i rst encircle and overwhelm the enemy l anks. Meanwhile, the ura should check the enemy centre. Finally, the reserve units should envelop and overwhelm the encircled enemy army. 212 One strand of ancient Chinese military philosophy emphasizes the role of the sage general. The ideal commander is portrayed as possessing supranormal intuitive power. 213 Leadership is important in Kamandaka’s scheme. Kamandaka says that when, as a result of nocturnal encounters, enemy troops feel exhausted because they have been kept awake at night and then fall asleep or feel sleepy during the day, the vijigishu should sud-denly fall upon them and annihilate them. The enemy troops, wounded or exhausted (in serious combat) during the i rst half of the day, should be attacked and annihilated during the second half (i.e., before they can recuperate). Kamandaka continues that to fool the enemy, an expert war-rior may be set up as a dummy of the king; his own forces may thereby be inspired to feel the royal presence, and the enemy’s attention is diverted. War depends upon the integrity of the vijigishu , and without him the army is annihilated. 214 The vijigishu is supposed to take care of the food supply, and the army should not be dispatched into an area where food cannot be obtained by foraging. 215 At the tactical level, Kamandaka over-emphasizes the importance of elephants in battle (his prakasayuddha ), which are to be used as batter-ing rams like modern-day tanks. Kamandaka goes on to say that tusk-ers should be used not only to destroy the hostile infantry but also to defeat the enemy force’s elephants. 216 The premier power of Deccan, the Satavahanas, who fought the Sakas in Maharashtra during the i rst century CE , maintained only 2,000 cavalry. This was because good mounts were not available in Deccan, and the terrain was unsuitable for a large-scale 210 Bachrach, ‘The Practical Use of Vegetius’ De Re Militari during the Early Middle Ages’, p. 247. 211 Nitisara , ed. by Mitra, p. 441. 212 U.

Moreover, the hilly terrain of central India and the Vindhya Mountains, covered with extensive forest, did not favour operations by a large group of cavalry. The victories of the Rashtrakutas over the Palas and the Pratiharas during the eighth and ninth centuries CE strengthened the model of an army based on elephants and infantry. 217 The principal source of elephants was the mountainous, forested region at the southern extrem-ity of the Western Ghats. 218 Thus, Kamandaka, unlike Manu, is willing to consider night attack, deceit and ambush as part of the repertorie of a modii ed form of dhar-mayuddha that includes elements of kutayuddha . To sum up, there is tension in the Nitisara as regards the proper ethical limits when conduct-ing warfare. Kamandaka accepts the necessity of l ank attacks as part of kutayuddha but, like Manu, notes that it is unethical to destroy retreat-ing enemy soldiers. In sarga 12, verse 6, it seems as if Kamandaka is opposed to surprise attack. However, in sarga 19, verse 55, Kamandaka, like Kautilya, advocates surprise attack. Overall, while Kautilya is totally for kutayuddha , Kamandaka is only half-heartedly pushing the concept of kutayuddha . KATHASARITSAGARA , PANCHATANTRA and the HITOPADESA Upinder Singh writes that treatises like Kamandaka’s Nitisara not only rel ected contemporary political reality but also shaped the political dis-course. The ideas of political theorists were absorbed and expressed in poetry, drama, didactic stories, and so on and reached a wider audience. 219 Didactic fables like Panchatantra and Hitopadesa are collections of stor-ies of birds and beasts who appear to possess human feelings and emo-tions. The animals appear in the role of wise politicians and advocates of niti (policy). They aim to educate the sons of Kshatriyas in politics and practical wisdom in a way that allows them to learn with pleasure. 220 By contrast, the Kathasaritsagara is a collection of stories focusing on man-woman relationships, with politics and the state appearing at the back-ground. R. C. Majumdar opines that the Kathasaritsagara was composed 217 Sandhu, Military History of Ancient India , pp. 309, 373, 486. 218 Sundaram, ‘Warfare in South India’, p. 171. 219 Singh, ‘Politics, Violence and War in Kamandaka’s Nitisara ’, p. 33. 220 W.

The literal meaning of Kathasaritsagara is ‘ocean of stories’. The book is a collection of short stories. The stories may be i ctional, but they rel ect certain social practices and morals of the contemporary age. The struc-ture of the Kathasaritsagara is a person telling a story; after hearing it, another person tells another story, and this process continues. The struc-ture is somewhat similar to the thousand and one stories of the Arabian Nights , where the princess tells one story and that leads to another story and so on. Somadeva, like Kautilya and Bana, criticizes coups, even those against inefi cient rulers. One story develops the theme of the principal minis-ter (named Shatkal) of a king planning to execute the reigning monarch and raise a puppet ruler. The king is advised to get rid of the treacherous powerful minister by secret assassination. This is an example of silent war, which is part of kutayuddha . Somadeva elaborates the duties of a loyal minister. When the king is energetic and following an active policy, the minister should be docile and implement the King’s policy. However, when a monarch is interested in the pleasures of the l esh, alcohol and hunting, the minister should take a proactive role in running the affairs of the state. In the case of an inactive monarch, if the minister also remains inactive, then such a state is doomed. One story of Somadeva’s rel ects the idea that during the reign of an inefi cient king, the loyal minister should try to expand the kingdom by using buddhi rather than brute force. Diplomacy should be used for strengthening the position of the state that is surrounded by enemies, both in front and to the rear. The powerful kingdom to the rear should be won over by matrimonial alli-ance and thus neutralized. Then an expansionist policy should be fol-lowed vis- à -vis the polity in the front. However, Somadeva concedes that such a strategy is risky and might destroy the state. Somadeva advises that when an able ruler of a small kingdom is threatened by a powerful neigh-bour, instead of experiencing total destruction, the former ruler should make peace by paying tribute to the powerful neighbour. However, the 221 Somadeva Bhatta, Kathasaritsagara , tr. from Sanskrit into Bengali by Hirendralal Biswas, Introduction by R. C. Majumdar, 5 vols.

Somadeva asserts that kutayuddha in self-defence becomes dharmayud-dha . Somadeva narrates a story: once upon a time, when Punyasena was ruling over Ujjain, it was invaded by a strong ruler. Punyasena realized that the invader could not be defeated in prakasayuddha . So Punyasena, in self-defence, decided to follow kutayuddha . The ministers of Punyasena spread the news that Punyasena had died, and a dead body was pre-sented for public display as proof. The ministers of Punyasena invited the invader to become king of Ujjain. The invader got overconi dent and careless and, without taking proper precautions, moved into Ujjain. Suddenly Punyasena’s soldiers, who had prepared an ambush, fell upon the advance guard of the invader and destroyed it, and a select group of warriors also fell upon the invader and executed him. Punyasena came out from his hiding place and became the ruler again. 224 Somadeva, in another story, argues that a just king should wage dhar-mayuddha . After defeating his opponents, the victorious just ruler should win their affection by showing kindness and respect to his fallen ene-mies. The defeated ruler should be reinstated in his kingdom and should remain a loyal tributary to the victorious just ruler. However, if the defeated ruler turns out to be a treacherous tributary, then it is ethical for the just ruler to execute him and annex his kingdom. In one story, told by one minister Yogendhanarayan, Somadeva writes that a king should get glory and exhibit paurusha by waging dharmayuddha against the kingdoms located in the eastern part of the subcontinent. The eastern part of the subcontinent is considered fertile because of the bumper crops grown in the river valleys. The king is warned not to attack north-west India as that region is dominated by the mlechchas . 225 The mlechchas did not obey the normative model of dharmayuddha as laid down by Manu. Only the members of a single ethno-cultural group, imbued with a partic-ular philosophy, could accept the cultural norms introduced by the pro-ponents of that philosophy. Moreover, the Hindu kings’ elephant-centric armies could not compete with the military effectiveness of the composite 223 Kathasaritsagara , tr. by Biswas, vol. 1, pp. 22, 101–2, 104. 224 Ibid., p. 107. 225 Ibid., pp. 130, 156, 169.

One story discussing the origins of Pataliputra city, recounts that a Brahmin ruler decided to kill his son in order to retain the throne. The father hired guptaghataks (secret assassins) to murder his son. The guptaghataks hid in a temple and planned to kill the intended victim when he came to worship the deity. The intended victim discovered the guptaghataks and bought them off. Next, he killed his father with the help of the ministers. This story rel ects a sort of kutayuddha carried on by the guptaghataks . In the same story, the intended victim who later becomes the hero claims that many Brahmins, like prostitutes, were run-ning after money and could not be relied upon. The same story narrates the Kings’ use of guptachars (secret agents) who functioned as the eyes and ears of the monarch. 226 Bana writes that a ruler named Vatsapati, while on a trip to the elephant forest, was imprisoned by an enemy ruler (Mahasena) and his soldiers, who issued from the belly of an artii cial elephant. Bana says that this sort of commando strike is unfair. 227 This story reminds one of the Trojan horse. A similar story is recounted by Somadeva. Chandamahasena, the ruler of Ujjain, after consulting with his ministers, created a mechan-ical elephant and inside it put some of his crack warriors. Then, with the mechanical elephant, Chandamahasena moved towards the Vindhya Mountain. Vatsaraj, the ruler of Kausambi, was hunting more or less alone on the Vindhya Mountain. Suddenly, he saw the mechanical elephant and advanced towards it. It is to be noted that the Vindhya Mountain was famous for its elephant herds. The warriors of Chandamahasena sud-denly jumped out of the mechanical elephant and surrounded Vatsaraj. When the news of Vatsaraj’s capture reached Kausambi, Rumnat, the person in charge of policy making in that kingdom in the absence of the king, argued that a frontal attack on Ujjain would only harm the secu-rity of Vatsaraj. Rather, Ujjain needed to be attacked by means of kuta, depending on brain power rather than muscle power. The point to be noted is that both Bana and Somadeva repeat the story. Therefore, such a kutayuddha technique (a sort of ‘Trojan horse’ motif) was apparently used by the monarchs of that time. Secondly, the construction of a mov-able elephant shows the existence of a high degree of mechanical skill among the Hindus of north India. Thirdly, the argument put forward 226 Ibid., pp. 12–15. 227 Harsacharita , tr. by Cowell and Thomas, p. 244. "},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"Hinduism and the Ethics of Warfare in South Asia148is that dharmayuddha could not succeed against kutayuddha . Crooked techniques need to be used, even by a just ruler, to check kutayuddha by an opponent. However, Somadeva is ambiguous about whether the use of kutayuddha in response to the unrighteous techniques of an unjust ruler, resulting in an upward spiral of violence, is morally correct or not. 228 A particular story elaborates on the various techniques of kutayud-dha that were used in the event of inter-state war. Before attacking a kingdom, spies were sent by the invader to ascertain the strength of the king and his domain. The spies practiced a sort of biological warfare by spreading poison among the animals and agricultural i elds of the kingdom. The objective was to ruin the economic infrastructure of the kingdom in the long run. In the short run, to blunt the military effec-tiveness of the kingdom’s army, the invader sent vishyakanyas (female assassins) to poison and murder the military leaders and to demoral-ize the army. Thus, we i nd that Somadeva is aware of the techniques of kutayuddha elaborated on by Kautilya. Somadeva asserts that ulti-mately kutayuddha backi res on its practitioners; it is always good, if possible, to wage dharmayuddha . 229 One story tells us that many Brahmins acquired training in weap-ons and developed their physiques through wrestling. Obviously, such Brahmins joined the army. Another story of Somadeva’s tells that a mon-arch should be well versed in dhanurveda (the science of archery) and that with a bow one can get rid of i fty foot soldiers. We see that both Manu and Somadeva give great importance to foot archers. Somadeva like Sun Tzu shows awareness of the linkage between the terrain and the army’s force structure. One of his stories says that elephants should be used for conquering the region south of Vindhya Mountain and cavalry for i ghting in Sind, especially against the mlechchas . Elephants are to be acquired by capturing them from the Vindhya Mountain or taken as tribute from the ruler of Kamrup (Assam). In one story, the protagonist states that good horses are like gods. Somadeva tells us that kings fre-quently fought each other to protect grasslands that were suitable for feeding horses. 230 The original Panchatantra , composed in Sanskrit, is lost. The Pahlavi version of the Panchatantra was composed before 570 CE but is now lost.

Within South Asia, the Panchatantra was also translated into the Newari language of Nepal. Keith claims that the Panchatantra was composed before 450 CE and had been translated into Chinese by the last decade of the i fth cen-tury CE . 231 The Panchatantra is a niti-shastra , or textbook on niti . Niti means ‘the wise conduct of life’. Several stanzas in the Panchatantra emphasize security. The Panchatantra takes a realist attitude, implying that the world is full of evil men who cannot be reformed. In such a scenario, gaining security requires the exercise of intelligence. Readers are warned of deception at various levels of society. The past, for Panchatantra , offers material for gaining wisdom in order to under-stand the present and the future. 232 The Panchatantra describes the internal and external threats that a ruler has to face. It warns the ruler that he should never delegate all power to a single person, even though the latter may be very efi cient. Sole com-mand might encourage the efi cient subordinate to overthrow the mon-arch. 233 The Panchatantra claims that wars are fought for both tangible and intangible objects. Warriors i ght when their honour is insulted. As regards the tangible objectives of war, the Panchatantra says: Land and friends and gold at most Have been won when battle ceases. 234 The Panchatantra stresses winning and retaining loyal allies. Like the MD , it notes that a fort i lled with archers is more effective in stopping an invasion than innumerable elephants and horses. The Panchatantra gives a vivid description of fortii cation comprised of gates i tted with bolts, bars, and yantras . Moats and walls provided additional protec-tion. 235 We are not sure whether ancient and early medieval Indians, like the Greeks and the Romans, possessed artillery machines like catapults for shooting arrows, ballista for throwing stones and scorpio for dischar-ging javelins. Dionysius the Elder, the tyrant of Syracuse around 400 BCE, constructed catapults with the help of engineers brought from all over the Mediterranean world.

Is beloved of kings. 237 The Panchatantra is aware of the importance of careful planning, mil-itary training and intelligence on the part of the military leader for enhancing the military effectiveness of the force at his disposal. It is no use blaming defeat and disaster on fate. Here, the Panchatantra dif-fers from Kamandaka’s Nitisara , which states that the result of war is always uncertain. Rather than having soldiers rush madly to defeat their enemies, pre-battle evaluation of the enemy and training of the sol-diers, comments the Panchatantra , are necessary. And a weaker power, warns the Panchatantra , should never resort to war against a stronger power. 238 One stanza notes: In case of horse or book or sword, Of woman, man or lute or word, The use or uselessness depends On qualities the user lends. 239 Another verse tells us: Intelligence is power. But where Could power and folly make a pair? The rabbit played upon his pride To fool him; and the lion died. 240 The Panchatantra advises that before battle, the army should be deployed in proper vyuha, and the conch should be used for signaling the various detachments of the army in the midst of battle. 241 Bana writes that the 236 Leigh Alexander, ‘The Origin of Greek and Roman Artillery’, Classical Journal , vol. 41, no. 5 (1946), pp. 208–12. 237 The Panchatantra , Book 1, p. 28. 238 Ibid., pp. 71–2. 239 Ibid., p. 36. 240 Ibid., p. 66. 241 Ibid., p. 82.

He was a philosopher and probably composed his work between 800 and 950 CE . The Hitopadesa contains quotations from the Nitisara . Most of the stories aim to teach by example and are satirical. So the structure of Hitopadesa is similar to that of the Panchatantra , which Narayana acknowledges. The Hitopadesa deals with certain aspects of niti , that is, political theory in its various aspects, including politics, diplomacy, and problems of war and peace. 245 The Hitopadesa asserts that during vigraha , proper strategy leads to victory. For proper strategy, the king needs to hear the advice of wise ministers. For giving the right advice, the ministers require information about hostile polities. 246 Before starting a war, it is necessary to send spies in order to ascertain the strength of the enemy force. As the Hitopadesa advises: ‘Sir, let a spy go there i rst. Then we will get to know their orga-nization and their strengths and weaknesses.’ 247 Once war is inevitable, the Hitopadesa agrees with Kautilya and Kamandaka that it is better to defeat the enemy by treacherous diplomacy than by outright combat because of the unpredictability inherent in battle. Here, the Hitopadesa , unlike the Panchatantra , accepts Kamandaka’s advice that the result of war is anitya . 248 As regards vigraha , the Hitopadesa tells us that treacherous conduct by allies leads to defeat. 249 Boldness in combat is regarded as essential.

According to the Hitopadesa , forts defended by battlements and a garrison comprised of archers constitute an effective defence. As regards the construction of different types of forts, the Hitopadesa goes on to say that a fort surrounded by a lake is most defensible. Eastern India in general and Bengal in particular are full of rivers, streams and marshes. So the Hitopadesa emphasizes what Kautilya describes as jala-durga (water forts). The Hitopadesa elaborates on the importance of forts functioning as bases for the defending force. Food and war materi-als can be stored in forts. In addition, forts are essential for housing rein-forcements as well as for providing rest and recuperation for exhausted soldiers. 251 Tamil Military Theory of South India All of the above-mentioned literary pieces composed in Sanskrit describe the political and military culture of north and central India. In order to get a pan-Indian view, it is essential to have an overview of the works on statecraft composed in the Dravidian south. Tamil literature is one of the oldest literatures. According to some scholars, Tamil is one of the oldest living languages of the world, with an unbroken literary his-tory of over two millennia. Originally, Tamil literature belonged to the Dravidian stock of people living in southern part of the subcontinent. Saint Valluvar’s Kural , or Tirukkural , is one of the great classics of Tamil literature. The word Tiru is somewhat similar to Sanskrit Sri and means ‘sacred’. Sri is added to one’s name as mark of respect. Kural means something that is short, concise and abridged. 252 The Kural is a compen-dium of moral rules. The date of Tirukkural is still debated. The work belongs to the post-Sangam era. 253 The latest assessment is that it was 250 Ibid., p. 140. 251 Ibid., pp. 156–7. 252 Tiruvalluvar, The Kural , tr. from the Tamil with an Introduction by P. S. Sundaram (New Delhi: Penguin, 1990), Introduction, p. 7. 253 P . Sensarma, Military Thoughts of Tiru Valluvar (Calcutta: Noya Prakash, 1981 ), pp. 2, 5. "},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"From the Common Era to the Advent of the Turks153composed around the seventh century CE . Kurals are couplets by the saint poet Valluvar. Valluvar deals with aram (virtue), porul (polity) and inpam (love, pleasure and happiness). To an extent, aram is equivalent to Sanskrit dharma , porul to Sanskrit artha and inpam to Sanskrit kama . 254 Of 1,330 kurals of Valluvar, 700 are on porul , 380 deal with aram and 250 with inpam . In the 700 kurals dealing with porul , Valluvar discusses various aspects of statecraft and warfare. 255 P. S. Sundaram rightly says that the Kural is the work not of a mystic but of a down-to-earth man of the world. The author of the Kural , continues Sundaram, is a states-man and not a politician, a realist and not a cynic. 256 Ranganayaki Mohapatra asserts that the Kural represents a fusion of Dravidian and non-Dravidian values. 257 Unlike Manu, Valluvar does not give any importance to the castes or lineages of the rulers and ministers. This is despite the fact that the caste system had percolated into south India by the second century CE . 258 The Kural says: Call them Brahmins who are virtuous And kind to all that live. 259 This is probably because Valluvar belonged to a low caste. Valluvan is the caste name of the drummers in the villages, and the profession of drummer was considered very low in pre-modern India. 260 The term ‘val-luvan’ was also associated with the weavers caste. According to one the-ory, Valluvar was the illegitimate son of a Brahmin father and a harijan mother. His birthplace was probably Mylapore in Madras. According to another version, Valluvar was from Kanyakumari in the extreme south of Tamil Nadu; he was a chieftain ruler named Valluvanadu.

Kautilya also says that dharma can only l ourish only if one has artha and kama . Like Manu, Valluvar says that protection of his subjects is one of the pri-mary duties of the monarch. The Kural elaborates: He who is a just protector Will be deemed the Lord’s deputy. 263 Valluvar warns the ruler: Groupism, internal dissensions and seditious chiefs Are absent in an ideal land. 264 The Kural , like the MD , is against illegal heavy taxation of the sub-jects. 265 In order to avoid internal rebellion, Valluvar emphasizes good governance and criticizes nepotism as evil and unwise. Further, Valluvar is against micromanagement of subordinates’ activities by the ruler. 266 In a way, Valluvar is promoting what the Germans called auftragstaktik . In contrast to Kautilya and Kamandaka’s saptanga theory of the state, Valluvar claims that the state is comprised of six elements: patai (army), kuti (subjects), kul (treasure), amaiccu (ministers), natpu (allies) and aran (forts). Valluvar is against giving undue importance to the ruler by accept-ing him as one of the constituent element of the polity. Unlike Kautilya and Kamandaka, Valluvar asserts that the army is the most important element within the state. 267 According to Nathan Rosenstein, the army played a vital role in fos-tering and strengthening a common civic identity among the Romans. Military service entailed a direct interaction between the citizen and the state. Rosenstein claims that the ideology of republican Rome stressed the possession of virtus (manly excellence) displayed in the pursuit and acqui-sition of gloria and fama (glory and renown) won through service to the res publica (Rome’s public affairs). War constituted by far Rome’s most important public business by far, and war afforded the greatest scope for accumulating gloria and fama . These, along with virtus, demonstrated a man’s i tness for leadership and paved the way to high public ofi ce. 268 In 262 Sensarma, Military Thoughts of Tiru Valluvar , p. 3. 263 Tiruvalluvar, The Kural , tr. by Sundaram, p. 59. 264 Ibid., p. 94. 265 P .

Before using the army, Valluvar, like Sun Tzu, stresses strategic plan-ning. The Kural notes that an ill-planned scheme will be unsuccessful. 271 Valluvar, somewhat like Sun Tzu, points out that knowing the enemy and knowing oneself are essential for victory. 272 The Kural claims that proper assessment of the enemy’s strengths and weaknesses is the path to victory. 273 Like Sun Tzu, Valluvar emphasizes the importance of striking at the right time and seizing the right opportunity. 274 In order to achieve this, notes the Kural , patience is necessary. 275 Conducting warfare requires money and the establishment of an administrative infrastructure. During the Roman Empire, the individual legions and auxiliary regiments remained permanently in commission, with particular names, numerals and titles. Many soldiers served all of their lives. To give an example, Legion II was probably formed in 43 CE . Its emblem was a Capricorn and its title Augusta. Legion III was given the title Cyrenaica by Augustus for service in that province. In 13 CE , Emperor Augustus ordered that terms of military service in the legions be i xed at sixteen years, followed by four years of service in reserve. Upon retirement, the soldiers were rewarded with a grant of gratuity. Augustus established a military treasury for paying gratuities to the soldiers. The revenues for the military treasury came from two taxes imposed on the Roman citizens: a 5 percent tax on inheritance and a 1 percent tax on auction sales. To prevent any divided loyalty, the wages of the soldiers were paid by the imperial treasury. 276 All this generated regimental/legionary cohesion and gave the army a strong formal institutional ethos and infrastructure. The Tamil word kul is equivalent to the Sanskrit word kosa . Valluvar says that the monarch should generate wealth through customs, taxes and tribute from defeated enemies. Valluvar hints at economic warfare 269 Pierre Briant, ‘The Achaemenid Empire’, in Raal aub and Rosenstein (eds.), War and Society in the Ancient and Medieval Worlds , p. 109. 270 Sensarma, Military Thoughts of Tiru Valluvar , p. 13. 271 Tiruvalluvar, The Kural , tr. by Sundaram, p. 67. 272 Art of War , tr. by Sawyer, p. 179. 273 Tiruvalluvar, The Kural , tr. by Sundaram, p. 68. 274 Art of War , tr. by Sawyer, pp. 183–4. 275 Tiruvalluvar, The Kural , tr. by Sundaram, p. 69. 276 Keppie, Making of the Roman Army , pp. 55, 76, 146–8, 205–6.

Valluvar claims that an army must have a grand, imposing look. The enemy should be cowed by exhibiting the grandeur of the army. The army’s imposing look is the product of numerical superiority as well as its smart appear-ance. One could speculate that a large number of well-dressed soldiers not only instills a sense of coni dence among the military personnel but also tends to demoralize the enemy. 277 The Romans also emphasized public display of soldiers along with their polished arms and armour. Not only did these exercises encourage recruitment and maintain unit morale, the public was also intimidated by such sights. On the battle-i eld, the l ashing of metal and colour and the sound of clanking arms created an imposing and intimidating impression that gave one’s own side encouragement and struck fear into the hearts and minds of the enemy. The psychological impact of such public display on the adver-sary was enormous. 278 Valluvar, like Kamandaka, states that numerical superiority means nothing in warfare without an able commander. 279 The Kural emphasizes that even a numerically superior force comprised of trained soldiers will melt away without proper leadership. 280 Valluvar is also an admirer of energy and action (somewhat similar to Kautilya’s utsahasakti ) on the part of the monarch. 281 The Kural notes that a successful king must dis-play courage, liberality, wisdom and energy. 282 Valluvar emphasizes the importance of sound administration for sustaining the army. 283 The Kural points out that to eliminate desertion and disaffection among the sol-diers, a proper administrative fabric that takes care of the soldiers’ crea-ture comforts under a generous ruler is necessary. 284 Let us have a look at the military landscape that provided the back-ground for Valluvar’s theorizing. J. Sundaram asserts that the Chola army was organized in regiments. The name of one such regiment was Rajaraja- terinda-vil . ‘Rajaraja’ refers to the monarch who raised the unit, and the term terinda refers to the high level of training and i tness of the personnel of the unit. It means that this was an elite unit.

While the valavans were in charge of training the troops, the unit was lead into battle by an ofi cer called a nayakan . The senamukham was the headquarters for training the troops. There were bazaar s and merchants for supplying the troops. Chalukyan troops between the sixth and eighth centuries CE were led into battle by the king or his sons or by the favoured princes of collateral branches. 285 Many Brahmins served as generals in the armies of the Cholas and Chalukyas during the tenth and eleventh centuries CE . 286 Besides the army, Valluvar states that forts are necessary for both offensive and defensive warfare. Valluvar writes that a fort should be sur-rounded by a high and massive wall. The fort, according to him, should have large space inside, but the approaches from the outside should be narrow. He, like Manu and Narayana, further emphasizes that foodstuffs and other supplies should be stored within the fort. 287 The Harsacharita says that forts were surrounded by water-i lled moats, which in turn were protected by rock walls. 288 Kautilya recommends that a fort be protected by three parallel ditches: one i lled with water, another with mud; the third ditch should be dry. 289 Valluvar continues that a properly stocked fort with a well-motivated garrison can withstand a long siege. 290 Except in north-west India, fortii cations on the subcontinent during the Common Era were characterized by the presence of massive ram-parts l anked by solid quadrangular towers. 291 Towards the end of the Maurya period, the Andhras in Deccan had towns protected by walls. 292 At Banavasi, situated on the left bank of the Varada River, a tributary of the Tungabhadra, the rampart, oval in shape and covering an area of forty-two hectares, was pierced by two openings. It was a brick struc-ture on a rubble foundation and surrounded by a deep moat constructed during the Satavahana period (i rst century BCE –second century CE ). At Satanikota, situated on the right bank of the Tungabhadra River in Andhra Pradesh, the fortii cations were constructed between the i rst century BCE and the third century CE .

The wall was skirted by a rock-cut ditch about 3.20 meters deep and 4.25 meters wide. The citadel at Nagarjunakonda, on the right bank of Krishna River in Andhra Pradesh, covered an area of i fty hectares and was probably constructed during the third and fourth centuries CE . The rampart, made of mud, was twenty-four meters wide at the base and was later strengthened by a revetment of baked brick built on the bare rock surface. The citadel was surrounded by a ditch. 293 As a point of comparison, during the ninth century CE fortii cations in England were comprised of an eight foot-thick wall, a rampart of about nine feet from the base of the ditch that fronted it to its earth-covered top, and a wooden palisade atop the earth. The stone-and-wood rampart was about six feet in height. 294 Conclusion Rather than technical aspects, which are over-dominant in classical Western military tracts, the ancient Hindu philosophy of warfare focused on the moral objectives and cosmic signii cance of vigraha . As in the case of ancient Chinese military philosophy, which witnessed the continuous tussle of wen-wu , in Hindu philosophy one witnesses a continuous ten-sion between dharmayuddha and kutayuddha . There are both similarities and dissimilarities between the just war tradition of Saint Augustine and the Hindu acharyas ’ concept of dharmayuddha . Both Augustine and the acharyas believed that preventing war through persuasion and regarding war as a last option are more glorious than slaying human beings with swords on the battlei eld. Augustine and the acharya s accepted the idea that the use of coercive force constitutes an essential component of the political authority of the ruler. In Saint Augustine’s framework, in the Christian just war tradition, a just war could be initiated by a legitimate ruler or by the command of God. 295 In the Hindu dharmayuddha corpus of thinking, a just war is initiated for a just reason by a just ruler, but never by God. Occasionally, dharmayuddha was conducted for the pur-pose of maintaining the chaturvarga system. For the traditional Hindu ideologues, the chaturvarga system was an ideal, but in practice the pres-ence of numerous mixed castes and the Brahmins in the army give the lie to the idea of a strictly enforced fourfold social system. 293 Deloche, Studies on Fortii cation in India , pp. 39, 41, 43. 294 Bachrach and Aris, ‘Military Technology and Garrison Organization’, pp. 3–4. 295 Reichberg, Syse and Begby (eds.), The Ethics of War , pp. 73, 80–1.

The Roman political system was not only competitive but also militaristic. For instance, a tribune had to serve at least i ve years in the army as a qualii cation for ofi ce. 296 In India, an amatya didn’t require experience of military service as a qualii cation for reaching the top stratum of the state. The Gupta Empire was to a great extent a territorial empire and to a lesser extent a hegemonic empire. The rest of the big polities like the Sungas, Kanvas, Satavahanas, Harsa’s empire, Rashtrakutas, and so on were mainly hegemonic empires con-taining numerous semi-autonomous tribes and agrarian communities. To a great extent, the concept of dharmayuddha gave rise to hegemonic empires. However, the rules of dharmayuddha were not always accepted on the battlei eld. Despite Manu’s injunctions, incendiary arrows (arrow-heads smeared with oil and set alight before i ring) were used occa-sionally. 297 Manu’s and Kamandaka’s emphasis on the use of troops in close-quarter battle formation gives the lie to the assertion of several his-torians that ancient Indian warfare was merely ritualized combat between undisciplined militias. Both Manu and Kalidasa speak of the riverine navies of the polities in east India, but neither mentions the existence of a seagoing or oceango-ing navy. The Indo-Greeks introduced geometrical plans for constructing forts, but the indigenous system did not absorb these elements completely. Even the Central Asian inl uence, which involved constructing circular and hollow towers, was partially rejected by the Hindu military archi-tects. According to an age-old tradition, the Hindu fort architects con-tinued to emphasize the construction of solid, massive structures. Both Manu and Valluvar, like Kautilya, emphasize a fortress-oriented strategy based on positional warfare. It seems that both the medieval Western European military commanders and the acharyas like Sun Tzu were against a battle-centric strategy. Sreni troops were used both by the Guptas in north India and by the Cholas in south India. 298 The acharyas also advocated the use of defeated enemy troops. The Roman Empire, like the Hindu kings, also used bheda . For instance, in 409 CE , Emperor Honorius used 10,000 Hunnic allies against the Goths. 299 When the structure of the armies became more loose, political treachery often decided the outcome of campaigns in 296 Keppie, Making of the Roman Army , p. 39. 297 Sandhu, Military History of Ancient India , p. 391. 298 Ibid., pp. 376–7. 299 Heather, ‘The Huns and the End of the Roman Empire in Western Europe’, pp. 14–17.

Castinus’ Roman force against the Vandals in Spain was crippled in 422 CE , when the former’s Gothic confederates deserted. 300 Mounted archery was absent in south India because before the thir-teenth century CE the south Indian kingdoms never encountered the mounted archery of the steppe nomads. For the discontinuation of horse archery in post-Gupta north India, Sandhu blames the chairborne sas-tric teachers. The Brahmin teachers hated any sort of change, hence they resisted all innovation and particularly disliked the imposition of the mlechcha system of mounted archery. 301 An additional reason was the ecology of India. Despite the fact that the Central Asian nomadic tribes with their mounted archery ran roughshod over the armies of the Hindus, mounted archery was never a prominent theme either for Manu or for Kamandaka. Since south India had no experience with mounted archers, the Kural does not mention it. After the fall of the Guptas, India forgot all about horse archery, and the Hindu rajas continued to wage internecine warfare with elephants, as advocated by Kamandaka. However, by the tenth century CE , the elephant-centric armies of the Hindus in north-west India were facing disaster against the mounted archery of the Islamic nomads. 300 Liebeschuetz, ‘The End of the Roman Army in the Western Empire’, p. 267. 301 Sandhu, Military History of Ancient India , pp. 391, 529.

After the Arab conquest of Sind, due to the resistance of the Grujara-Pratiharas, Islam failed to expand into the interior of the subcontinent. From the eleventh century onwards, warlords from Afghanistan who had embraced Islam invaded India. At that time, north India was divided into several intermediate-sized principalities. These polities were ruled by the Kshatriya landed elements known as thakur s, who later came to be known as Rajputs. Initially, the Islamic military raids from Afghanistan (like those of Mahmud of Ghazni, who ruled from 999 to 1030 CE ) were geared for pillage and plunder. But by the thirteenth century, the Turko-Afghan war-lords had established the Delhi Sultanate, which lasted from 1206 until 1526. The military personnel of the Delhi Sultanate were mostly Afghan adventurers, especially horse dealers who had moved into Hindustan for loot and better careers in the military and administrative apparatus of the newly established Muslim polities in India. 1 By the early sixteenth century, the Delhi Sultanate was declining, and the Chaghtai Turks under Zahir-ud-din Babur established the Mughal Empire in 1526. In Jos Gommans’s formulation, the Mughal Empire, like the Ottoman and Manchu empires, was a post-nomadic frontier state. The nomadic rulers from central Eurasia, taking advantage of the agrarian expansion of the sedentary societies, 1 Raziuddin Aquil, Sui sm, Culture, and Politics: Afghans and Islam in Medieval North India (New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 2007 ), p. 43. "},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"Hinduism and the Ethics of Warfare in South Asia162created powerful cavalry armies with a longer reach, which enjoyed clout in the agrarian societies along the borders of the central Eurasian steppe zone. 2 However, the nomadic regimes were also dependent on the tal-ents and services of various indigenous communities. The Rajputs, albeit from a subordinate position, played an important role in the functioning of the Mughal Empire. But the Mughals failed to co-opt the Marathas (the resurgent Hindu peasantry in west India). The Marathas challenged the Mughal Empire during late seventeenth century. The Mughal Empire, though in terminal decline from the 1720s, continued to function until the mid eighteenth century, when the East India Company started on its road towards political dominance of the subcontinent. The Hindu response to Islamic Turkish domination occurred at two levels, theoretical and practical, and its objectives were twofold: contes-tation as well as accommodation with the Muslim rulers. Here, we will analyze some of the Hindu texts and try to contextualize them vis- à -vis the political and military backgrounds in order to see how Hinduism met the challenge of Islam from a subordinate position. Aziz Ahmad writes that Muslim rule in India gave rise to two literary genres: a Muslim epic of conquest in Persian language and a Hindu epic of resistance and rejection of Islam in Hindi. The Muslim epic and Hindu counter-epic emerged in challenge-response dynamic: Muslim epic literature emphasizes the glory of Muslim victories, while Hindu counter-epic works emphasize resistance and repudiation of Islam. Aziz continues that these works rel ect historical attitudes rather than history. 3 Azis’s statement is partly true with respect to the literature in Sanskrit and in vernaculars other than Hindi that emerged in reaction to Muslim domination. As we shall see, the Hindu theoretical tracts emerged in interaction with changing political circumstances and Islamic political and military theories propounded by various jurists. The Political and Military Landscape The Turks were excellent horse archers. A skilled archer was able to aim and shoot at least six arrows per minute. 4 The Turkish nomads learnt to 2 Jos Gommans, ‘Warhorse and Post-Nomadic Empire in Asia, c. 1000–1800’, Journal of Global History , vol. 2 ( 2007 ), pp. 1–21. 3 Aziz Ahmad, ‘Epic and Counter-Epic in Medieval India’, Journal of the American Oriental Society , vol. 83, no. 4 (1963), p. 470. 4 Andre Wink, Al-Hind: The Making of the Indo-Islamic World , vol. 2, The Slave Kings and the Islamic Conquest, 11 th –13th Centuries ( 1997 ; reprint, New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 2001), p. 76.

The sword-wielding Armenians, who were capable of close-quarter combat, were destroyed from a distance by the mounted archery of the Seljuq Turks. 6 The Rajput warriors used bows made of cane whose range was shorter than that of the composite bows used by the Turkish mounted archers. 7 The Hindus used simple bows. Each such bow was made of a single piece of wood or bamboo. By con-trast, the composite bows used by the Muslim horse archers were made of wood, horn and sinew. 8 The strings of the composite bows were made of hides. 9 The Turks also used nawak s (crossbows); the bolts from these bows were able to pierce armour. 10 Simon Digby writes that the Rajput archers, unlike the Turks, did not use thumb rings. 11 The Rajputs had stir-rups made of rope or wood. By contrast, the Ghaznavids had metal stir-rups, which enabled them to develop heavy cavalry geared to delivering shock charges on the battlei eld. 12 The medieval Western European horse-men used long stirrups, which enabled riders to stand up while delivering an effective lance thrust. 13 Andre Wink asserts that from the tenth century onwards, Hindu mil-itary theorists started attaching great importance to war horses. But the ecology of India, unlike that of Central Asia, was unsuitable for breeding good horses. The arid zone in Central Asia, with its extensive grassland, gave rise to good horses, while India lacked adequate pastures. 14 The Suleiman Mountains west of the Indus produced good horses.

Yabu horses were the offspring of Turki horses from an inferior breed. In strength and size, they were inferior to Turki horses. Tazi and Jangli horses were Indian breeds and inferior to Yabu horses. 16 Kalhana’s Rajatarangini notes that the Turuska horsemen were a threat to the security of Kashmir. The Rajatarangini notes that the kings of Kashmir made desperate attempts to acquire horses from the region west of the Indus. Foreign horse dealers grew rich from the horse trade. 17 During the twelfth century, the south Indian powers imported Arabian and Turkish horses through Arab merchants. The Hoysala Dynasty’s (west India) attempt to cross Arab mares with local breeds produced horses with thick legs and broad heads, which proved infe-rior to the Central and West Asian war horses. 18 The Palas (750–1175) and the Senas (1096–1225) of Bengal imported horses from north-west India, and when this source of supply was cut, mounts were imported from south China. 19 Moreover, the Hindus did not feed their horses prop-erly. As a result, many horses fell sick and died. 20 Another limitation of the cavalry of the Hindu powers was that their horses were not shoed. Only during the second half of the thirteenth century was horse shoeing introduced in south India. 21 Jos J. L. Gommans notes that when cut off from external sources of supply, the Delhi Sultanate raised war horses in the sub-montane tract of the Siwalik Hills and the comparatively drier regions around the Sutlej River in Punjab. 22 Feudalism in the medieval world was probably a global phenomenon.

The embryonic warrior class of the eighth and ninth centuries became the bushi caste of medieval Japan. The court tried to co-opt the rising private military power by giving the elite provincial warriors (who were leaders of the private military organizations) rank, ofi ce and land in return for performance of assigned tasks. 26 In late medieval Japan, military service was provided in exchange for leases of land. 27 The samanta (Hindu feudal lords/feudatories) system in India was a product of the disintegration of the central government and the emer-gence of the feudal complex. One characteristic feature of this system was the prevalence of land grants to administrators in lieu of a salary. This was due to the decline of urbanism, the paucity of trade and com-merce, the shortage of money, and the resultant emergence of closed local economies. The fragmentation of political authority and the rise of the lord-vassal relationship shaped the political structure. The net result was the rise of several layers of hierarchical landed intermediaries with increasing rights and obligations to the land and the produce of the land.

He argues that due to the spread of agriculture and brahmanism, tribes became peasants, and state formation occurred at the local level. Brahmanism spread by appropriation and integration of the local cults and customs. 29 The samanta s were landed aristocracy with military obligations to their overlords. They represented a focus of quasi-autonomous politi-cal power. During the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, a hierarchy emerged among the samanta s, and we i nd terms like mahasamanta , samanta , ranaka , rauta , and so on. They later were known as rajapu-rusa s or Rajputs. 30 The Rajputs, originally known as rajaputra s (literal meaning ‘sons of the king’), by the twelfth century had come to be known by the former term. They were a mixed caste consisting mostly of small chiefs possessing estates. Gradually, these chieftains bought the tribal terri-tory under their control, and pastoralism was replaced by an agrarian economy. In Rajasthan during the seventh and eighth centuries, due to the use of irrigation, agriculture spread and strengthened the posi-tion of the Rajput lineages. The Rajputs also strengthened themselves in local society by suppressing various tribes like the Bhils, Ahirs, and so on and colonizing the new areas. With the disintegration of central government in polities like Gurjara-Pratiharas in Rajasthan and north India, their samanta s became independent and proclaimed their rajapu-tra status by establishing independent kingdoms. Inter-clan marriage among the rajaputra s further strengthened the Rajput identity. By the end of the thirteenth century, the term ‘Rajput’ conveyed both political status and an element of heredity. 31 In medieval India, writes Stewart Gordon, ‘Rajput’ was a descriptive term for men on horseback who disdained agriculture and pursued honour and social mobility through 29 B.

However, this system was replaced by the pattadari system. Raja Sur Singh (ruled 1596–1619) introduced the patta-dari system at Jodhpur, and Raja Rai Singh introduced it at Bikaner around 1625 CE . The sanad or patta was roughly equivalent to the jagir , which authorized the holder to collect land revenue ( rekh , i.e., assessed revenue) and other taxes. This changed the relationship between the nobles and the ruler. From being sharers in the patrimony of the state, the Rajput chieftains were reduced to a position of subordination. They were forced to accept certain obligations of chakri (service) and in return were granted patta s. 34 The Rajputs were roughly equivalent to the warrior class of medieval Japan, who were known as bushi / Samurai . The bushi were also known as chusei (between the tenth and fourteenth centuries), and the war-rior bands were referred to as bushidan . The term bushi refers to men of military background who specialized in martial arts and combat. The intention of the bakufu was to make archery, swordsmanship and horsemanship – the major martial skills of the warrior class – the exclu-sive attribute of those of bushi status. 35 A mounted bushi was supposed to supply the services of his matamono (personal retainers) to his dai-myo as a military duty in compensation for the i ef that he received from the daimyo . The number of matamono that the bushi was expected to supply was determined by the size of the i ef/stipend he received. 36 The 32 Stewart Gordon, ‘Zones of Military Entrepreneurship in India, 1500–1700’, in Gordon, Marathas, Marauders, and State Formation in Eighteenth-Century India (1994; reprint, New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 184. 33 G.

Ultimately, the bushi evolved from being a class of professional warriors in the service of the central government to become a group of provincial lords. 37 The mounted troops of Western Europe were known as milite s (knights). By 1400, a small proportion of the mounted troops were knighted, and they constituted an elite group. 38 Until the i fteenth cen-tury, in Western Europe, the armies were comprised of lords leading their vassals. The vassals owed military service to their lords. Each lord was the chief of the lineage. A principality of an overlord was comprised of several lineages. Claude Gaier notes that ‘lineage’ refers to a super-family grouping of all the individuals who claimed a common ancestor directly or by alliance. The members showed a solidarity that was strengthened by social equality and a convergence of interests. 39 Hindu Response to Turkish Domination Pope Leo IV (847–55) and Pope John VIII (872–882) stated that those who died defending the church and Christendom would be granted absolution and receive heavenly rewards. Yuri Stoynov asserts that these notions gradually contributed to the development and eventual formalization of the Crusade idea and the sanctii cation of holy war by the Catholic Church. The Byzantine Church delegated the con-ceptualization and practice of warfare to the secular imperial gov-ernment, trying on occasion to check unwarranted imperial demands such as rewarding holy military martyrdom. Wars were declared, led and conducted by the emperor, a secular and public authority entrusted to maintain the defence and unity of the imperial state. The conceptualization of Byzantine warfare was to a great extent a continuation of the Roman just war tradition, which meant defend-ing the state and regaining lost territory. However, the late Roman just war tradition underwent Christianization during the Byzantine period. Constantinople became the New Rome, and the Christianized just war tradition became an integral part of the Byzantine imperial 37 Kleinschmidt, ‘Introduction’, p. xviii. 38 Michael Prestwich, ‘ Miles in Armis Strenuus : The Knight at War’, in France (ed.), Medieval Warfare , p. 185. 39 Claude Gaier, ‘Analysis of Military Forces in the Principality of Liege and the County of Looz from the Twelfth to the Fifteenth Century’, in France (ed.), Medieval Warfare , pp. 105–6, 109.

The notion that the purpose of all war is the establishment of peace was i rst introduced by Aristotle. However, the assumption that man is by nature peace-loving is a Christian idea. This contributed in part to the Byzantine idea that only defensive war is just. Angeliki E. Laiou claims that while Western Christendom developed a more open-ended idea of just war, based on Saint Augustine, that avenges injustice, the Byzantine just war concept of Emperor Leo VI was more defensive in nature, that is, the protection of territory invaded by the enemy. Leo VI did not advocate preventive war or preemptive strikes. Nor, unlike some of the medieval Western European commentators, did the Byzantine just war concept demand total extirpation of the pagans. 41 Again unlike the Western European clergy, the Byzantine clergy did not actually participate in battle. 42 A holy war can be declared by a competent religious authority: the pope or the Caliph . The objective is religious: protection or recovery of sacred shrines or forced conversion. And those who participate in the holy war are promised a spiritual reward such as remission of their sins or assurance of a place in paradise. 43 The medieval Western world clearly differentiated between just war and holy war, but these two concepts were fused within the Hindu concept of dharmayuddha . T. M. Kolbaba asserts that if the combatants understood that the command of god can come through his human servants, then the Crusades could be catego-rized as holy wars. 44 In Wink’s view, the Ghaznavids launched annual jihad s against India and also forced many defeated rulers and their subjects to accept Islam. 45 Amira Sonbol asserts that jihad has the meaning of ‘strive’, while in the Quran, the word qatilu means i ghting, going to war.

The hadith literature referred to jihad as a means of waging war. The hadith s conveyed the message that jihad was to be waged against the unbelievers until they accepted Islam. One of the duties of jihad was to convert dar al Harb into dar al Islam . During the thirteenth century, the sui s and some theologians divided jihad into greater jihad (a spiritual form of jihad of the self) and lesser jihad (holy war against Islam’s enemies). 46 John Kelsay writes that the Prophet Muhammad had a concept of just war. A war is just in his eyes when there is a just cause and the presence of righ-teous intention, and when the war is directed by a legitimate authority. Further, in the paradigm of just war of Al Shaybani (died 804 CE ), a thinker of the early Hanai School, in a just war non-combatants are immune from harm. 47 Rajat Datta warns that despite the many syncretic and inclusionist dimensions of medieval Indian cultures, for the Turkish conquerors and their ideologues Hindustan was a land of kufr (ini dels). 48 During the i rst half of the sixteenth century, when the Mughals and the Afghans fought each other in north and east India, they did not use the term jihad . The term jihad was used only during campaigns against the Rajputs. 49 Before the Battle of Khanwa (1527) against Rana Sangram Singh, Babur gave the call for jihad . 50 The army of an Islamic ruler i ghting the Hindus was known as lashkar-i-Islam (the army of Islam) and any campaign (i.e., offensive or defensive) for suppressing rebellious Rajput chieftains or to capture new Rajput territories was given the sanction of being a jihad . 51 Datta continues that with the exception of Akbar (emperor from 1565 to 1605) in his later years, the Mughals were devout Muslims, 46 Amira Sonbol, ‘Norms of War in Sunni Islam’, in Popovski, Reichberg and Turner (eds.), World Religions and Norms of War , pp. 282–98. 47 John Kelsay, ‘Al-Shaybani and the Islamic Law of War’, Journal of Military Ethics , vol. 2, no. 1 (2003), pp. 69, 72. 48 Rajat Datta, ‘Introduction: Indian History from Eighth to Eighteenth Centuries: Problems, Perspectives, and Possibilities’, in Datta (ed.), Rethinking a Millennium: Perspectives on Indian History from the Eighth to the Eighteenth Centuries, Essays for Harbans Mukhia (New Delhi: Aakar, 2008 ), p. 4. 49 Aquil, Sui sm, Culture, and Politics , p. 65. 50 R.

The Muslim rulers were expected to maintain a delicate balance between the two. Publicly, the Muslim rulers declared respect and adherence to the shariat . The rulers rushed to the Sui s during the succession crises for blessings and prayer. 53 Raziuddin Aquil and Sunil Kumar question the very concept of liberal Sui s functioning as bridge builders between the Hindu and Muslim communities, in contrast to the orthodox ule-ma s. 54 The Sui s were interested in conversion. 55 Aquil concentrates on the fourteenth-century chronicler and political theorist Khwaja Ziya al-Din Barani. Barani praised Sultan Mahmud, whose objective in the former’s eye was to destroy the Hindu religion. Barani noted that it is incumbent upon a good sultan to wage jihad . Barani advocated that 2–300,000 Brahmins be killed and that the rest of the Hindus be given the option of either death or Islam. 56 However, Barani also realized the distinction between what was ideal and what was real. He noted that total annihilation of the opponents and of the shariat was not possi-ble. At best, the Hindus could be oppressed, disgraced and barred from high ofi ces as they, in his eyes, posed a grave threat to Islam. 57 Aquil continues that Barani was no lone fanatic. His contemporaries and near-contemporaries like Sayyid Ali Hamadani and Fakhr-i Mudabbir offered similar formulations. 58 The ulemas functioned as paid servants of the state. They generally interpreted the shariat to suit the policies of the sultan. They were employed in the administration as religious advi-sors and judges in order to project the image among Muslim subjects that the polity was an Islamic state. They also legitimized the ruler’s campaigns against non-Muslim chieftains by characterizing them as jihad . 59 52 Rajat Datta, ‘Harbans Mukhia: A Historian’s Journey through a Millennium’, in Datta (ed.), Rethinking a Millennium , p. 372. 53 Aquil, Sui sm, Culture and Politics , pp. 118, 180. 54 Sunil Kumar, ‘Politics, the Muslim Community and Hindu-Muslim Relations Reconsidered: North India in the Early Thirteenth Century’, in Datta (ed.), Rethinking a Millennium , pp. 139–67. 55 Aquil, Sui sm, Culture, and Politics , p. 166. 56 Raziuddin Aquil, ‘On Islam and Kufr in the Delhi Sultanate: Towards a Reinterpretation of Ziya al-Din Barani’s Fatawa-i Jahandari ’, in Datta (ed.), Rethinking a Millennium , pp. 169–79. 57 Aquil, Sui sm, Culture and Politics , p. 120. 58 Aquil, ‘On Islam and Kufr in the Delhi Sultanate’, p. 180. 59 Aquil, Sui sm, Culture, and Politics , p. 122.

In fact, many ascetic orders of both communities were milita-rized. Medieval society believed in the paranormal power of religious disciples. Several Sui s at various times also wore military uniforms. A large number of Sui saints participated in the lashkar-i-Islam , either as soldiers equipped with swords or by providing moral support and legit-imacy. Further, the barkat of the presence of the Sui s strengthened the motivational spirit of the Muslim soldiers. 60 W. G. Orr asserts that Hindu ascetic orders became militarized in response to the Islamic intrusion. The Islamic armies brought with them a large number of religious adventur-ers like faqir s and dervishe s (Islamic holy men) equipped with spears and battle axes. They roamed throughout Hindustan, murdering and pillaging at will. In response, the yogi s (Hindu ascetics) and the Naths (followers of Goraknath) also took to arms in order to save themselves. 61 It would be wrong to argue that militarist Hindu ascetics emerged only in response to the intrusion of Islam. Even before the advent of the Muslims on the subcontinent, Hindu militant monks were active. Bana’s Harsacharita, composed before the entry of Islam into South Asia, tells us that Hindu monks from Thaneshwar in north India participated in warfare. These ascetics did not renounce the world but indulged in sex, gained political power, amassed wealth and worshipped shakti (violence, destruction). Nevertheless, the advent of Islam in South Asia radicalized the situation and resulted in the emergence of a larger number of more aggressive Hindu monks. The guru s trained their chela s (retainers) at the akhara s. The militarist sadhu s (Hindu saints) were equipped with swords, bows, arrows, charka s (throwing discs with sharp pointed spikes) and, during the late medieval era, even with handguns. 62 The Naga sanyasis , who excelled as wrestlers and swordsmen, made use of bhang , opium and intoxicating liquors before attacking the enemy. 63 At times, temples were used as defensive fortii cations. Kalhana, in Rajatarangini , notes: ‘As the [refugees] stayed in the temple courtyard which was protected by massive wooden ramparts and gates, the assailants could neither capture nor kill them.’ 64 60 Ibid., pp. 105, 196, 218. 61 W.

Lorenzen writes that around 600 CE , a corpus of myths about the gods and goddesses, codii ed in the epics ( Ramayana and Mahabharata ) and in the early Purana s, was completed. All the Hindu movements after this date were based on bhakti and, at least in their initial stages, were led by poet saints who sang songs and recited stories about these gods and goddesses. 65 According to Sheldon Pollock, the Hindu kings of the last thousand years commissioned a large number of dramas and other forms of narrative on the Rama theme in Sanskrit, Prakrit and other regional languages. 66 In Merutunga’s Prabandhachintamani of 1304 CE and in Jayanaka’s Prithvirajavijaya , written between 1178 and 1193 CE , King Jayasima Siddharaja of Gujarat (1094–1143 CE ) and King Prithviraja Chauhan of Ajmer (died 1193 CE ) are identii ed with Rama and their Turkish opponents with Rama’s demon opponents. 67 Aziz Ahmad asserts that Prithvirajavijaya , composed between 1178 and 1200 CE , accuses the Muslims of oppressing the Brahmins and coni scating the charity lands granted to them. 68 Rama is presented in these works as a righteous ruler with a curved bow (the composite bow used effectively by the Turkish cavaliers against the Rajputs?) and Ravana as the arch-villain who makes the world weep and i lls the earth with terror. 69 The Sisodiya Rana Jagat Singh (ruled 1638–52) commissioned an illustrated Ramayana under the direction of the artist Sahib Din. In this work, Ravana and his entourage are depicted in Mughal-style tents. 70 Brajadulal Chattopadhyaya cautions that the popularity of the con-cepts of Rama and Ramrajya were not merely a reaction to Muslim invasions but part of a wider historical process that started during the post-Gupta era. Large Hindu kingdoms tried to legitimize kingship and authority over the non-sedentary tribal people using the ideological con-structs of Rama and Ramrajya . 71 Suvira Jaiswal claims that the Rama cult became popular in north India during the i fth and sixth centu-ries CE .

The Rama cult was designed to suppress the Sudras and to maintain the dominant position of the Brahmins. During the i fteenth and the sixteenth centuries, the Rama cult became popular among different regional language groups due to the spread of the bhakti movement. 72 Protest occurred not only against Islam but also against the spread of brahmanism. For instance, the mas-sive social following of Virasaivism in Deccan was actually a protest against the varna hierarchy and the economic and social dominance of the Brahmins. 73 In a similar vein, Romila Thapar criticizes scholars who have posited two monolithic religions, Hinduism and Islam, coming face to face dur-ing the second millennium CE . Thapar says that the people of India did not perceive the new arrivals as a homogeneous community going by the name ‘Muslim’. The terms used by the Indians to describe the outsid-ers were Turuska s, mlechcha s (unclean) and yavana s. The term yavana s, derived form the word yona (referring to the Ionians/Greeks), was also used after the beginning of the Common Era to refer to the Greeks who invaded India from Bactria. 74 K. M. Shrimali says that in Indian litera-ture, the term mlechcha s is used to designate indigenous tribes, the Sudras as well as foreigners. 75 Thapar continues that India before the invasion of Islam did not comprise one single Hindu religion. Rather, Indian soci-ety was an amalgam of various sects and cults with beliefs and rituals ranging from atheism to animism. 76 Richard M. Eaton writes that it was customary for a victorious Hindu king to desecrate the temple contain-ing the state deity of the defeated enemy ruler. 77 Hence, it was not only the Muslim rulers who desecrated temples. Some of the Hindu kingdoms were indeed multi-religious entities.

For instance, while the Shia Persian ruler Shah Tahmasp I gave refuge to Babur’s son Humayun (who had been driven out by the Afghan warlord-turned-ruler Sher Shah), Sher Shah tried to conclude an alliance with the Sunni Ottoman Empire. 79 During the i rst half of the twelfth century, cat-apults were used in siege warfare in Kashmir. And Muslim military mer-cenaries were utilized by the Hindu kings of Kashmir, when campaigning against the rebels. 80 M. Habib writes that during the twelfth century, the Hindu rulers of north India employed Muslim mechanics skilled in manufacturing and operating manjaniq s (catapults). 81 Among the Muslim scholars who settled in India during the medieval era, the notion of India as a country with a composite culture gradually evolved. M. Athar Ali writes that Isami (who wrote during the mid fourteenth century) used the word Hindian , meaning Hindis , which included both the Hindus and the Muslims settled in India. 82 In the history of the medieval world, there are numerous instances of mercenary soldiers belonging to one religion taking service with monarchs belonging to another religion. For instance, the Latin mercenaries between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries took service with the Muslim monarchs of the Middle East and even with the Mongols. Simultaneously, large-scale warfare (Crusades) also occurred among the Muslim polities and the Latin states of the Middle East. 83 Overall, despite some Muslims serving with the Rajput monarchs, there was serious tension between the Muslims and the Hindus, as portrayed in medieval poems like Prithvirajavijayamahakavya .

They highlight the exploits of the princely patrons of the poets and the patrons’ immediate princely predecessors. A shortcom-ing of such poems is their panegyrical character. Since the poets were dependent on princely patronage, the poems do not recount the limita-tions of the poets’ patrons. While Kalhana’s Rajatarangini offers a con-nected narrative of the various dynasties that ruled Kashmir from the dawn of civilization until Kalhana’s time, Prithvirajavijayamahakavya focuses on one particular king, the poet Jayanaka’s patron. For the ear-lier period, Kalhana depends on legends and myths, and for the later history period of Kashmir, he uses written records. Kalhana was the son of a great Brahmin Kashmiri minister, Lord Canpaka. Canpaka was dvarapati (literal meaning, ‘lord of the gate’), which means com-mandant of the frontier defence. Kalhana completed his work around 1148–9 CE; his patron was King Harsa (ruled 1089–1101 CE ; not to be confused with Harsa Vardhana of Kanauj, the patron of the poet Bana). Both Kalhana and his father were Saivaites (worshippers of Lord Shiva and followers of Saivism). In Kalhana’s paradigm, unfolding separate events are not phenomena to be traced back to respective causes but rather illustrate the religious, moral and legal maxims that together constitute dharma . Kalhana claims that the performance of both a ‘nation’ and an individual is dependent on punya (spiritual merit) gath-ered from previous births. Kalhana also emphasizes the importance of fate in shaping the course of history. 84 Both the Rajatarangini and the Prithvirajavijayamahakavya highlight the heroism and bravery of the Rajputs. Prithvirajavijayamahakavya is comprised of 1,067 sloka s. The poet Jayanaka (a Kashmiri) in this poem highlights the defeat of Muhammad Ghori (the ruler of Ghor in Afghanistan) by Prithviraja III Chauhan (the hero of the poem) in the First Battle of Tarain (1191 CE ). However, Jayanaka does not mention the defeat of Prithviraja at the hands of Muhammad Ghori in the Second Battle of Tarain (1192 CE), 85 just as Bana in Harsacharita does not describe the defeat of his patron, Harsa of Kanauj, at the hands of the other potentates. The defeat of Prithviraja in the Second Battle of Tarain was important as Muslim vic-tory in this battle led to the establishment of Ghorid rule.

The early Chahamana rulers – including Arnoraja, Vigraharaja IV, Baghbhata, Hamira, Sathaldeva, and Kahurdeva – fought the Ghaznavid sultans. Prithviraja continued this tradition by i ghting the Ghorids. In fact, Maharajadhiraj Arnoraja extended the boundary of his kingdom to Sind and the Saraswati River in the west and to Haryana in the north. Jayanaka writes that the blood of the dead Turkish soldiers reddened the soil of Ajmir, and the city cel-ebrated Arnoraja’s victory. 86 Prithviraja ascended to the throne in 1177 CE . His chief secretary was the Rajput Kadambasa, who was also the jagirdar of south-east Punjab. Prithviraja III’s realm extended from Thaneswar in the north to Mewar in the south. 87 During the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the Nagda-Ahar lineages of the Guhilas created the Rajput state of Mewar. 88 Initially, when Prithviraja was young, Kadambasa maintained the king-dom through wisdom. Gradually, Prithviraja became skilled in both sastra (vedic dharma ) and astra-sastra (weapons). Jayanaka writes that in order to maintain the brahmanical social order, Prithviraja send soldiers to dif-ferent corners of his kingdom. The Brahmins chanted vedic sloka s under the protection of Prithviraja. 89 Prithviraja was not merely a skilled war-lord but also a patron of the arts and literature. His court poets, besides Jayanaka, included Vidyapati Gaur, Baghisar Janardhana, and Biswarup. Jayanaka depicts Prithviraja as the incarnation of Vishnu. 90 The Chauhan inscriptions use the word matanga or mlechcha s, while Jayanaka uses the work Turuskas to designate the Turks. At times, Jayanaka uses the term ‘Garjan matanga s’ to designate the Ghaznavid Turks who were defeated by Ajoyraja Chauhan in 1112 CE . 91 In Kashmir, Harsa or (Harsa-deva) plundered many temples and destroyed several idols. According to Kalhana, nemesis overtook him. 92 The various Rajput clans fought against each other.

Harsa was defeated in the struggle and subsequently murdered. A dharmik king, warns Kalhana, should avoid heavy i scal exploitation of his subjects, as it might cause rebellion. And ill-gotten wealth should be distributed, especially among the Brahmins, in order to strengthen dharma in the realm. This assertion is in tune with Manu and Kamandaka’s dictum. The king should maintain peace with the Rajput clans in his kingdom, writes Kalhana, by judiciously distributing administrative posts among the var-ious Rajput clans. 93 Jayanaka also gives instances of dharmayuddha con-ducted by the dharmik Rajput kings. In 1151 CE , Vigraharaja defeated the Tomara Rajputs, occupied Indraprastha (Delhi) and made the Tomaras subordinate feudatories. The inscriptions issued by the Rajputs show that the Rajput rulers considered north India to be part of the Aryavarta . 94 For the Rajputs, internecine warfare was at times more important than i ghting the Turks. The Rajputs indulged in raids for the purpose of steal-ing princesses from neighbouring Rajput polities. 95 A pan-Indian Rajput consciousness was probably not that strong. Prithviraja, on the advice of Kadambasa, remained neutral when Muhammad Ghori attacked the Chalukya ruler of Gujarat, Raja Bhimdeva. This was due to the ongoing Chalukya-Chauhan rivalry. 96 In 1178 CE , the Rai of Gujarat was able to defeat Muhammad Ghori. 97 When Muhammad Ghori occupied Nadol, Prithviraja III declared war against him. 98 The result was the two battles of Tarain. Ethics of Rajput Warfare Fighting was the favourite game of the Rajputs, and they emphasized loyalty, devotion, valour, chivalry and death-defying rashness on the battlei eld. 99 Before starting a battle, the Rajput chiefs consulted the 93 Kalhanas Rajatarangini , vol. 1, Introduction, pp. 15, 36, 38. 94 Prithvirajavijayamahakavya, Tritiya Adhaya, p. 63. 95 Somadeva Bhatta, Kathasaritsagara , tr. by Hirendralal Biswas, Introduction by Sudhansghmohan Bandopadhyay (1981; reprint, Kolkata: Academic Publisher, 1982), vol. 5, Pratham o Ditiya Taranga , pp. 3–29.

The bards fostered the growth of chivalrous lit-erature. The chivalrous ethos emphasized the vanity of personal valour at the cost of neglecting policy and expediency. 101 The Rajputs empha-sized single combat for the display of individual bravery rather than col-lective training to maneuver as a body on the battlei eld. 102 Just before the Second Battle of Tarain, Muhammad Ghori launched a night attack and harried Prithviraja’s army as it was retreating. 103 All these techniques in the Rajput paradigm of warfare comprised kutayuddha . John France claims that the culture of military individualism among the knights encouraged displays of personal courage on the battlei eld rather than planning and strategy. 104 Like the Rajputs, the knights of Western Europe never stooped to employ stratagems but went straight ahead regardless of consequences. Exhibition of individual prowess rather than tactical i nesse characterized the knights’ behaviour in battle. 105 Rather than collective training, the knights, like the Rajputs, emphasized individual strength and stamina. 106 The bushi ’s ethical ideals of warfare were known as budo , which later came to be known as bushido . 107 Kenneth Dean Butler asserts that the-orists like Yamaga Soko gave the i nishing touch to the bushido code during the Tokugawa period in the seventeenth century. 108 However, the origins of the various elements that constituted the bushido code can be traced back much earlier. While Kshatradharma was derived from Hinduism, the ideology of the bushi was inl uenced by the Zen Buddhist tradition of ‘mind-to-mind transmission’ and Neo-Confucianism. Karl F. Friday notes the inl uence of Confucianism’s infatuation with ritual and ritualized action. The Confucian assumption is that through action and practice, man fashions the conceptual frameworks that he uses to order 100 R. K.

Ritual is stylized action, sequentially structured, that leads those who follow it to wisdom. Those who seek knowledge and truth, then, must carefully cultivate the right kind of experience if they are to achieve the right kind of understanding. For the early Confucians, whose main interest was the proper ordering of state and society, this meant habitualizing themselves to the codes of what they saw as the perfect political organization. For bugei (school of traditional arts) students, it meant ritualized duplication of the acts of the past masters. Neo-Confucianism emphasized under-standing the abstract through the concrete and the necessity of unifying knowledge and action. 109 The bushi fought for honour. Each military unit was identii ed by a bannerman selected for his bravery. These men proved to be targets of the enemy soldiers on the battlei eld. The banners fostered a sense of group identity and were invested with emotional value. The warriors would attack rashly to retrieve lost l ags on the battlei eld. The display of individual prowess was the credo of the bushi just as it was for the knights and the Rajputs. Prior to the fourteenth century, the bushi warriors were praised for securing as many heads as possible by decapi-tating enemy soldiers. 110 The core of the Rajput army was comprised of cavalry. Horses were symbols of prestige and position. 111 The troopers wore armour and hel-mets, and the horses were caparisoned with steel plates for the protec-tion of their heads. By the fourteenth century, plate armour was used. 112 The khanda was central to the Rajput martial culture. When a young Rajput male was considered old enough to bear arms, he went through the ceremony of kharg bandai . The Rajputs worshipped swords because they believed that Visvakarma, the Hindu god in charge of making weap-ons, made the swords. 113 As the need for mounted archery diminished, swordsmanship became the primary martial art practiced by the warriors 109 Karl F.

The idea that the sword is the soul of the Samurai became prevalent in medie-val Japan. 114 The knights of medieval Western Europe also preferred to i ght close-quarter combat with straight double-edged swords suitable for hacking and slashing. 115 The knightly army was a loose structure comprised of the household retinues of the monarch and followers of the vassals. 116 Knights were rewarded by the crown with i efs for military service. A military con-tingent under a Rajput chief was comprised of relatives (fathers, sons, uncles, nephews, etc.). 117 The Rajput soldiers were remunerated through land assignments. There were two types of assignments: patrimonial and prebendal. In the patrimonial domain, the kinship group inherits control over the land; in prebendal tenure, the assignment was issued to the sol-dier by the chief in return for military service. 118 The Rajput chiefs employed charan s in their contingents. They moti-vated the soldiers by playing martial music during battles. 119 In the Kannada region, we i nd viragal s (commemorative stones) celebrating the heroism of men who died on the battlei eld. The literature of the Hoysala period was marked by vira-rasa (heroic sentiment) that praises the men who sacrii ced themselves for the king on the i eld of battle. 120 The Rajatarangini emphasizes the loyalty of vassals towards their lords. 121 Kalhana writes: ‘Soldiers of noble race who had left their homes, as if in exultation, were carried away mutilated from the palace courts by their relatives.’ 122 Kalhana continues: ‘The two Rajaputras Sahadeva and Yudhistira there paid back in battle with their lives the debt [they owed] for their lord’s favour.’ 123 Those Rajput chiefs who betrayed their king and fought against him were designated as dasyu s by Kalhana. 124 It was 114 Hurst III, ‘From Heiho to Bugei’, p. 190. 115 Ian Pierce, ‘Arms, Armour and Warfare in the Eleventh Century’, in France (ed.), Medieval Warfare , p. 76. 116 France, ‘Crusading Warfare and Its Adaptation to Eastern Conditions in the Twelfth Century’, p. 458. 117 S.

The bilva fruit is a favourite of Shiva (the god of destruction). Jayanaka writes that while the duty of the Brahmins was to conduct yagna s and study the veda s, the duty of the Kshatriyas was to i ght in order to protect the people. And the duty of the Sudras was to till the land. 127 This assertion was the same as that made by Manu in Manava Dharmasastra . In reality, the Brahmins occasionally took to arms. A Brahmin named Skand Nagar was the Senapati of Prithviraja III. 128 In Western Europe during the eleventh century, political theoreticians started talking about three orders of society: those who prayed (the bishops and the clergy), those who fought (the new knightly nobility), and those who worked (the peasants). The justii cation for the existence of the preroga-tives of the nobility was its skill in the use of arms. 129 Nevertheless, several bishops and archbishops of Germany provided cavalry to the German Emperor Otto II. 130 The Rajputs believed that to escape from the battlei eld or to become a prisoner of war were fates worse than death. Their motto was victory or death on the battlei eld. 131 During the battle with the Muslims, when the Rajputs found the battle going against them, they formed a death squad comprised of men armed with swords. When the Rajput forts were sur-rounded by the Muslims, the Rajput women performed jauhar (burning themselves on a pyre in order to prevent the enemy from dishonoring them), and the Rajput males came out to i ght and die. 132 In 1296 CE , when Alauddin Khalji’s (Delhi sultan from 1296 to 1316) army attacked Jaisalmer, 16,000 women committed jauhar , and Tilak Singh with 700 125 Kalhanas Rajatarangini , vol. 2, p. 39. 126 Srivaras Zaina Rajatarangini , English tr. and annotations by Kashi Nath Dhar (New Delhi: Indian Council of Historical Research and People’s Publishing House, 1994), wave I, canto I, verse 155, p. 77. 127 Prithvirajavijayamahakavya, Sashtha Adhaya , p. 119. 128 Saxena, ‘Mughal and Rajput Armies’, p. 304. 129 Miller, ‘Introduction’, p. 8. 130 Gaier, ‘Analysis of the Military Forces in the Principality of Liege and the County of Looz from the Twelfth to the Fifteenth Century’, p. 113. 131 Prithvirajavijayamahakavya, Ditiya Adhaya , p. 11. 132 Aquil, Sui sm, Culture, and Politics , pp. 152–3.

One of the most important duties of the Rajput king was to lead the army on the battlei eld. 134 The duty of a dharmik king was to pro-tect the kingdom and the subjects from external and internal enemies. Kalhana says that the duty of the king of Kashmir was to subjugate the ‘unruly’ non-Hindu hill tribes. 135 In 1179 ce, Prithviraja III led an army on the battlei eld. Jayanaka writes that when Prithviraja partici-pated in battle, he did not fear death. After gaining victory, Prithviraja returned all the wealth captured during the campaign to his defeated enemy. 136 This practice was in consonance with the code of dharmayud-dha . Vigraharaja’s campaigning against the Tomaras and then returning the kingdom to them is also an example of dharmayuddha . The objective of war in this paradigm becomes the display of heroism to prove one’s manliness without resorting to fraud. The Rajatarangini notes the prev-alence of dharmayuddha in Kashmir during the i rst half of the twelfth century: ‘The king [Jayasimha, ruled 1128–49 CE ], whose character was distinguished by its guileless generosity .... gave his own troops for his assistance [Somapala, who was driven out by his son Bhupala], and after humbling the pride of the enemy restored him to power.’ 137 This was despite the fact that Somapala had previously proved to be disloyal to Jayasimha. The Rajputs were inl uenced by neo-Vaishnavism, which focused on bhakti , that is, total devotion to god and lord. 138 Ramanuja in the elev-enth century emphasized bhakti as the true path of knowledge and karma . During the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, bhakti was emphasized as the only path to salvation and was addressed to the human incarna-tions of Vishnu, that is to Rama and Krishna. The cult of Rama bhakti was popularized by Ramanand in northern India during the fourteenth and i fteenth centuries. 139 From bhakti , the concept of namak halali (loy-alty to the employer) was derived. One of the core values of the Rajputs 133 R. K.

Francisco de Vitoria (1492–1546), the Spanish Dominican, drawing on Thomas Aquinas’s theory of just war, noted that enemy princes should not be deposed after each and every just war. The practice of the removal of the defeated enemy prince was reserved for the most extreme cases. Vitoria says that punishment should be reduced in favour of mercy, which was the rule not only of human law but also of natural law. So harm done by the enemy may be a sufi cient cause for war, but it is not always sufi cient to justify the extermina-tion of the enemy kingdom and the deposition of its legitimate princes, which was considered altogether too savage and inhumane. Gregory M. Reichberg writes in an article that the mainstream just war theory in medieval Western Christendom did not permit the use of offensive force to forestall hostile acts if uncertainty remained as to the time and place of enemy attack. According to the postulates of the just war theory, offensive force is permissible only in reaction to a determinable wrongdoing. 142 Several times during Sher Shah’s (founder of the Suri Sultanate in north and central India) campaigns against the Rajputs in the 1540s, the former refused to take prisoners of war and executed all the Rajput males. Sher Shah gained legitimacy in the eyes of the Muslims by sending all the ‘non-believers to hell’. 143 At least some medieval Western European Catholic Christian theologians conceived of just war as a sort of holy war that allowed forcible baptizing of unbelievers (Jews and Muslims). 144 This trend was completely absent in the medieval Rajput-Hindu discourse. The Muslims might be killed on the battlei eld, but Muslim prisoners 140 Gordon, ‘Zones of Military Entrepreneurship in India’, pp. 186–7. 141 Butler, ‘ Heike Monogatari and Warrior Ethic’, p. 287. 142 Gregory M.

Enslavement of non-Muslims dur-ing a military raid was accepted even in the Sui literature of the thirteenth and the fourteenth centuries but became a matter of controversy during the i fteenth century, 145 due in part to the inl uence of non-Islamic phi-losophies. Vijayasena Suri, a Jain leader of Akbar’s time, argued that Jain philosophy was very similar to the Samkhya philosophy of Hinduism. Vijayasena Suri advised Akbar that it is unjust to capture the personnel of the defeated party as prisoners of war after a battle. 146 The prisoners of war were sold as slaves. During 1562–3, Akbar prohibited the slave trade. 147 Gunpowder and Hindu Military Theories Let us now see how the various nitisastra s of the Hindus tackled the issue of Muslim invasions and the use of gunpowder. The term niti is derived from the Sanskrit root word ni , meaning to lead, carry, bring forward, convey, guide. Niti therefore denotes guidance, right policy. Nitisastra s are the ethics of statecraft. 148 The Sanskrit word for gunpowder is agnichurna . The ingredients of gunpowder were easily available on the subcontinent. Saltpeter is found in Bengal. Especially after the rainy season, it is an efl orescence from the ground. The Sanskrit word for saltpeter is suvarcilavana (shining salt). Sulphur is found in Sind. 149 The Nitiprakasika (expounder of polity) con-tains eight canto s (chapters). 150 The author of the Nitiprakasika (composed around the sixteenth century) is probably Vaisampayana. Vaisampayana notes the importance of gunpowder. He speaks about nalika s (handguns) and the use of hand grenades. The latter were comprised of pots i lled the with resin of the Sal tree, burning husks of corn, stones, iron spikes, and so on. Gustav Oppert opines that these smoke/i re bombs were used during 145 M.

Oppert translates surmi as a hollow tube. Another term used is karnakavati , which means a metallic cylinder with a hole inside, which could produce a blazing i re. The Nitiprakasika says that the raksas were destroyed by lead. Oppert opines that the Nitiprakasika is referring to leaden balls, which were i red from the hollow metallic cylinders with the aid of gunpowder. 152 However, Oppert’s assertion that gunpowder was invented in India, long before its advocacy in Western Europe by Roger Bacon during the thirteenth century, 153 is untenable. The passages in the Nitiprakasika that refer to gunpowder and gunpowder weapons were dei nitely later additions, probably made during the later medieval period. Srivara’s Zaina Rajatarangni , which covers the history of Kashmir between 1459 and 1486 CE , mentions that ammunition balls and car-tridges were manufactured by skilled artisans. Cannons were made of various metals cast together. Cannons were also imported from out-side. 154 Some of the cannons were pulled by mules. 155 According to one author, Vijayanagara manufactured cannons as early as 1388 CE . 156 In 1442–3, the Sisodia clans among the Rajputs probably used cannons at Chitor against an invading army from Malwa. 157 In 1547, Rama Raya, the ruler of Vijayanagara, signed a treaty with the Portuguese for acquir-ing sulphur because gunpowder was required for i ghting the Adil Shahi Sultanate. 158 One can conclude that during the thirteenth century the Mongols introduced gunpowder into north India from China. 159 And in south India, the Portuguese introduced gunpowder.

We do not know any details about the author of Sukranitisara . In accordance with the tradition of Hindu classical writers, the author chose to remain anonymous by giving authorship to an ancient mythical rishi . The dat-ing of the work is also uncertain. No ancient or medieval work refers to Sukranitisara . Nand Kishore Acharya writes that the council of ministers described in Sukranitisara bears a close resemblance to the Maratha King Shivaji’s (died 1680) council of ministers. On the basis of this evidence, Sukranitisara could be placed between seventeenth and eighteenth centu-ries. However, Sukranitisara does not mention the feranghi s (foreigners or Franks or Western Europeans). Hence, it must have been composed before the eighteenth century. The Sukranitisara discusses gunpowder. By the mid i fteenth century, gunpowder was used in India. The Sukranitisara (a practical guidebook for the ruler) was comprised of 2,500 sloka s 161 and, combining elements of the earlier work of Sukracharya, was proba-bly composed between the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries CE . The Sukranitisara categorizes the Muslims as yavana s. It accepts the cardinal importance of the military in statecraft. The Sukranitisara says that 50 percent of the revenue of the state should be allocated to the army. 162 Krishnadevaraya, the ruler of the Vijayanagara Empire, ordered that 50 percent of the state’s revenue be spent on the army. 163 Interestingly, the Nitiprakasika says that the king should take some of the bankers residing in his capital along with the army when campaigning. The Nitiprakasika , like the Arthasastra , emphasizes the importance of paying soldiers regularly in cash in order to motivate them to i ght and die for their employer. 164 Here, one sees the connection between the bank-ers who i nanced warfare and the aggressive designs of a ruler. The Sukranitisara states that a strong, just ruler is the incarnation of Vishnu. 165 It is to be noted that Jayanaka equates Prithviraja, his hero, with Vishnu. The Sukranitisara emphasizes two types of army: a standing army and a militia. The latter was raised during emergencies and func-tioned as a sort of second line of defence. The Sukranitisara introduces an organizational format for the army. In the Sukranitisara , the smallest unit of the army is the patti , which is comprised of i ve or six soldiers under a 161 Acharya, Polity in Sukranitisara , pp. 13, 17, 18–20. 162 Ibid., pp. 18, 161. 163 Elgood, Hindu Arms and Ritual , p. 143. 164 Nitiprakasika , ed. by Oppert, pp. 17, 26. 165 Oppert, On the Weapons, Army Organization, and Political Maxims of the Ancient Hindus, p. 83.

The Sukranitisara ’s patti (equivalent to a modern-day section) is thus different from the Mahabharata ’s patti, which was comprised of i fty-i ve soldiers. Above the pattipal , the Sukranitisara men-tions the gaulmika , the chief of thirty soldiers. A group of 100 soldiers is known as a satanika (equivalent to a company), and a group of over 1,000 soldiers is known as a sahasrika (equivalent to a battalion or reg-iment). The ayutika is the head of an ayata , a group of 10,000 soldiers (equivalent to a modern division). 166 Vaisampayana writes that the efi ciency of weapons depends on time and place. The effectiveness of a particular weapon also depends on the strength and skill of the user. 167 The importance of training and command is emphasized in the Sukranitisara in the following verses: The efi cient is eager for a good i ght... the trained is clever in tactics.... One should increase the physical strength for pugilistic combat by diet and by athletic exercises and wrestling.... A king should always ... encourage bravery by tiger-hunts, by practice with weapons and arms.... He should keep up his military strength by good pay, but the strength of his weapons by ... practice.’ 168 While Thomas Aquinas differentiates between war (violence done by one independent nation against another) and sedition (violent acts com-mitted against the internal order of a single nation), 169 the Sukrantisara , like Kautilya Arthasastra , fuses these two concepts. In the paradigm of Sukranitisara , the use of force for maintenance of the varnasrama society against internal rebellion or external invasion constitutes just war. 170 For both Kautilya and the Sukranitisara , asurayuddha is an extreme form of barbaric warfare. In the Arthasastra , asurayuddha means destruction of the enemy forces and annexation of the enemy kingdom. In such a war, the defeated ruler was executed, and his wives were violated, and his wealth was appropriated by the victor. Kalhana warns that a righ-teous king must follow the law of kings and should not exterminate members of the defeated royal family. 171 The Sukranitisara dei nes asur-ayuddha as a war fought mainly with mechanical devices (gunpowder 166 Acharya, Polity in Sukranitisara , pp. 162, 165. 167 Oppert, On the Weapons, Army Organization, and Political Maxims of the Ancient Hindus, p. 30. 168 Quoted from ibid., pp. 84–5. 169 Reichberg, ‘Norms of War in Roman Catholic Chrisianity’, p. 149. 170 Acharya, Polity in Sukranitisara , pp. 203–4. 171 Kalhanas Rajatarangini , vol. 2, p. 210. "},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"Hindu Militarism under Islamic Rule189weapons?) and manavayuddha as one fought principally with hand-held weapons (swords, spears, etc.). 172 The mechanical devices that the Sukranitisara refers to might also include maghribi s (devices used for throwing stones, used in siege warfare), which were introduced into south India by Alauddin Khalji’s general Malik Kafur. 173 Alauddin Khalji’s forces tried unsuccessfully to mine the wall of Ranthambhor during 1299–1300 CE . 174 And in 1398 CE , Amir Timur used gunpowder for mining the Bhatnir fort. 175 Mining involved digging a hole near the wall of the fort and i lling it with combustible materials. Then it was set on i re, which brought the wall down. The Sukranitisara ’s concept of asurayuddha is thus different from that of Kautilya and Kalhana. In the Sukranitisara ’s paradigm, asurayuddha becomes the most extreme form of warfare fought with ‘barbaric’ devices, that is, gunpowder and mechanical siege weapons. The Sukranitisara discusses various types of expeditions. The sambhuya expedition utilizes the forces of the feud-atories. The prasanga expedition (involving guile and duplicity, hence a form of kutayuddha ) begins against a particular enemy but proceeds against another enemy. 176 In medieval south India, virakkal (commemorative hero stones) por-traying dead warriors were made. A i fteenth-century hero stone, writes Robert Elgood, portrays an infantry soldier holding a sword like a dagger for stabbing the enemy. 177 The latter form of combat – that is, manavayud-dha – is considered as more humane than asurayuddha . Manavayuddha is a sort of just war in Sukranitisara ’s paradigm. The nayaka s (Hindu chief-tains of south India) during the sixteenth century disdained i rearms and guns. They regarded them as weapons of weaklings or cowards, for those who refused to face danger close-up. The nayaka s regarded swords and lances as honourable weapons, and death while i ghting with such weap-ons, they believed, resulted in ascension to heaven. In south India the forest tribes, unlike the high caste nayaka s, adopted gunpowder weap-ons rapidly, and their leaders became powerful chieftains. 178 As regards medieval Japan, Shosaku Takagi writes that despite the effectiveness of 172 Acharya, Polity in Sukranitisara , p. 170. 173 Elgood, Hindu Arms and Rituals , p. 289. 174 Saxena, ‘Medieval Forts, Logistics and Heraldry’, p. 341. 175 Khan, ‘Origin and Development of Gunpowder Technology in India’, p. 21. 176 Acharya, Polity in Sukranitisara , p. 172. 177 Elgood, Hindu Arms and Ritual , p. 13. 178 V .

Kalhana writes: ‘What can man achieve by prowess ... when success depends on the strange ways of fate?’ 180 However, the Sukranitisara , like Kautilya Arthasastra , asserts that fate at times could be overcome by practicing deceit. The Sukranitisara argues that the Rajput concept of dharmayuddha is too rigid for attaining victory against a wily enemy. Hence, the Sukranitisara states: ‘Considering the ... expedients and designs of his enemy and his own, he should surely always kill his enemy by fair and unfair i ghting.’ 181 Instead of a frontal attack resulting in a decisive battle, the Sukranitisara preaches asanayuddha . This means cutting the enemy’s supply line by attacking the non-combatants who provide wood, water and food to the enemy army. 182 The Sukranitisara , like Mao Tse-Tung, says that when the enemy is strong, it is necessary to retreat. One should then fall sud-denly upon the enemy like a robber and plunder his belongings. 183 For the Sukranitisara , asanayuddha is a sort of attritional guerrilla warfare. The Sukranitisara also justii es the techniques of tactical retreat and l ank attack as advocated in the format of kutayuddha : ‘by attacking the enemy in front; by falling on him with the two wings, by retreat-ing, in such a manner so far as the advantage of the ground favours the combat.’ 184 The Sukranitisara is implying that in order to defend the homeland against the ‘demonic’ Muslims, kutayuddha may be practiced. And in such a context, kutayuddha becomes dharmayuddha . During the second half of the seventeenth century, under their warlord Shivaji, the Marathas practiced asanayuddha when the Mughals under Emperor Aurangzeb invaded Maharashtra. 179 Takagi, ‘“Hideyoshi’s Peace” and the Transformation of the Bushi Class’, p.126. 180 Kalhanas Rajatarangini , vol. 2, Book 8, no. 1274, p. 101. 181 Quoted from Oppert, On the Weapons, Army Organization, and Political Maxims of the Ancient Hindus, p. 131. 182 Acharya, Polity in Sukranitisara , p. 172. 183 Jagadish Narayan Sarkar, Some Aspects of Military Thinking and Practice in Medieval India (Calcutta: Ratna Prakashan, 1974 ), p. 33. 184 Quoted from Oppert, On the Weapons, Army Organization, and Political Maxims of the Ancient Hindus, p. 130. "},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"Hindu Militarism under Islamic Rule191 Many Sui s and ulema s accompanied Sher Shah’s army in order to legitimize the use of force against the kai r s. One such religious leader, named Nimatullah Harawi, quoted a hadith and argued that treachery against the enemy ( al-hard khudat ) was legally valid. Hence, treacherous behaviour against non-believers during battle became part and parcel of what could be termed ‘just’ war. 185 The Sukranitisara was probably inl u-enced by such strands of thought. As regards the force structure, the Sukranitisara notes that a king should always maintain four times as many foot soldiers as horses. For logistical purposes, elephants, bulls and camels were also necessary. In addition, big guns should be placed on the chariots. In the Sukranitisara , ‘chariots’ probably refer to wagons on which the heavy i eld guns were placed. The Sukranitisara explains that the wagons were iron carriages with wheels, i lled with weapons and drawn by good horses. 186 The following details about the manufacture of gunpowder and hand-guns are available in the Sukranitisara : After the gunpowder is placed inside, it is i rmly pressed down with a ramrod. This is the small gun which ought to be carried by foot soldiers. .... Five parts of saltpeter, one part of sulphur, one part of charcoal ... and is pre-pared in such a manner that the smoke does not escape. If all this is taken after having been cleansed, is then powdered, and mixed together, one should squeeze it ... and dry it in the sun; having ground this like sugar, it will certainly become gunpowder. ....

By the application of i re they throw the ball coming from the tube at the mark. 187 During the second half of the sixteenth century, the Mughals manufac-tured handgun barrels by twisting a l at iron sheet continuously i red to fold rounds repeatedly in an elongated fashion with its edges overlapping one another, and then joining the twisted heated pieces over an iron rod to create a barrel. Thus, there were no weak joints in the barrel. This method produced a barrel of great strength, which could withstand high 185 Aquil, Sui sm, Culture, and Politics , p. 156. 186 Oppert, On the Weapons, Army Organization, and Political Maxims of the Ancient Hindus, pp. 85, 88. 187 Quoted from ibid., pp. 106–8.

Initially, the Mughals used matchlock guns; for i ring them, a match (known as a fatila ) was required. Later, for i ring, the wheel-lock mechanism was introduced. 188 The artillery pieces in India during the i fteenth century were made of brass or bronze. 189 Like Srivara’s Zaina Rajatarangini , the Sukranitisara emphasizes the importance of guns and animals like mules and bullocks for logistical purposes. The Nitiprakasika also emphasizes the importance of construct-ing roads before ordering the army to march and the necessity of taking artisans along with the campaigning army. 190 Roads were necessary for dragging the carts carrying heavy cannons, and artisans were required for manufacturing and repairing the gunpowder weapons. Compared to Kamandaka’s Nitisara , the Sukranitisara gives less importance to the role of elephants in battle and highlights the impor-tance of war horses and infantry. 191 This development might be due to the uselessness of the war elephants of the Rajputs against the mounted horse archers of Islam in the two battles of Tarain. The Nitiprakasika charts the linkage between terrain and the effectiveness of cavalry in the following words: ‘A country without mire, without stumps, without stones, which can withstand the treading of the hoofs of horses ... is even, is esteemed a good country for horses.’ 192 In South Asian warfare, the role of handgun-equipped infantry increased over time. Between 1526 and 1595, the num-ber of foot musketeers under the direct control of the Mughal emperor rose from 1,200 to 35,000. 193 In 1647, while there were 200,000 cavalry-men under the Mughal imperial banner, there were also 40,000 infantry (matchlock men, gunners, men equipped with ban s, etc.). 194 Rajputs and Marathas under the Mughals Akbar, the ‘real’ founder of the Mughal Empire, modii ed the character of the Mughal state by introducing certain measures.

Such a philosophy was well suited to a multi-religious and multi-ethnic country like India. 196 Akbar, in order to placate the Hindus, abolished the jizya (poll tax) and the pilgrimage tax. He discouraged cow slaughter and for-cible conversion from one faith to another and extended state patronage to non-Muslim institutions and individuals. 197 Whether the inl uence of Hindu ideas was responsible for Akbar’s cosmopolitan outlook is debat-able. However, several Sanskrit works were translated in the Mughal dur-bar . Shaikh Bhawan, a Brahmin who converted to Islam in 1575, took up the task of translating the Atharva Veda . The translation of Mahabharata begun in 1582. 198 William R. Pinch asserts that Kautilya’s Arthasastra was translated during Akbar’s reign, and Kautilya’s technique of using ascetics in the espionage department was eagerly copied by the Mughals. Badauni was ordered by Akbar to translate Valmiki Mahabharata into Persian. 199 Translations of Sanskrit works continued under Akbar’s successors. Dara Shikoh, the eldest son of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan (ruled 1628–58) translated the i fty-two Upanishad s around 1657 CE . 200 Akbar made extensive and effective use of the suzerain-vassal polity, by means of which a large number of non-Muslim chiefs were inducted into the Mughal nobility. The willing vassals were inducted into the nobil-ity through the mansabdari system. 201 In 1595, the Hindus comprised 16.8 percent of the Mughal nobility. 202 Despite Emperor Aurangzeb (ruled 1658–1707) following an orthodox Islamic policy, between 1679 and 1707 one-sixth of all the Mughal nobles of 1,000 zat (personal rank in the imperial hierarchy) and above were Hindus (Rajputs and 195 M.

A military i ef in the Ottoman Empire was known as a timar . In general, the timariot (holder of a timar ) was not transferred as long as he bought troops, and the timariot was generally succeeded by his son. In the Safavid Empire, the equivalent of the military jagir was the tuyul. The holders of the tuyul s were generally given pieces of land along with the associated peasants for a lifetime; and the tuyul s were also inheritable. 204 The mansab system consumed about 80 percent of the Mughal Empire’s land revenue. 205 Like the various grades of mansabdar s, there were different types of Samurai . Some Samurai might have large landholdings with thousands of war-riors under them; others received small stipends and were attended by only a few military retainers. 206 The Mughal Empire under Akbar was comprised of large number of semi-autonomous principalities ruled by hereditary chieftains styled as raja s, rana s, rawat s, rai s, and so on. The Persian chroniclers categorize them as zamindars . Most of these chieftains of north India fell under the generic term ‘Rajput’. Some of their principalities stretched over hun-dreds of kilometers. The number of cavalry commanded by some of them exceeded the strength of cavalry commanded by the highest grandees of the empire. Since these chieftains were not united, they posed only local threats to the empire. Many of them were coerced to join the Mughal Empire as mansabdar s. Many chieftains were also enrolled in the man-sabdari service after being defeated in battles. 207 To an extent, the recruitment of the Rajput chiefs into the Mughal army under Akbar was a reaction to the defeat of Humayun at the hands of the Afghans. 208 S.

The conventional policy was to subjugate a local chief, exact a heavy sum of peshkash (offering or tribute) and then leave him free in his domain. But Akbar bought the Rajput chiefs into the fold of the empire and allowed them to serve as military commanders. Thus, they were treated on a par with the Irani and Turani nobles. For providing military service, the Rajput chiefs not only retained their traditional landholdings (known as watan s) but also were assigned jagir s in various parts of the empire outside their principalities. Besides assigning jagir s, the emperor also con-trolled the Rajput chiefs by interfering during the succession struggles. Though in theory succession of the legal heir to the throne of the prin-cipality was hereditary, it still had to be ratii ed by the emperor. If the emperor was dissatisi ed with a disloyal chief, he could refuse to ratify the succession of the eldest son and instead support the candidacy of a younger brother or another male relative of the dead chieftain. 209 Like the Mughal emperors’ bureaucrats, the daimyo s were able to survey their retainers’ land and assigned a value to their incomes. 210 A Rajput MANSABDAR on DHARMAYUDDHA and KUTAYUDDHA Udairaj Munshi was the secretary of Mirza Raja Jai Singh, a mansabdar of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. Jai Singh fought in Deccan. In 1667, Jai Singh died; Udairaj embraced Islam, and the emperor gave him the title Taleyar Khan. The military dispatches of Jai Singh were collected and edited by Taleyar Khan and published after Taleyar’s death (1675) as Insha-I-Haft Anjuman in 1698–99. 211 Shivaji’s sack of Port Surat in Gujarat resulted in Aurangzeb sending Jai Singh with 15,000 soldiers to attack him. 212 Jai Singh’s campaign against Shivaji resulted in the Treaty of Purandar (June 1665). In accordance with the terms of this treaty, Shivaji surrendered twenty-three of his forts to the Mughals but retained twelve forts. Shivaji’s son Sabhaji became a panchhazari mansabdar (5,000 zat), 209 S. Inayat A.

However, Shivaji was exempted from personal attendance in the durbar of the Mughal Empire, and the Mughals agreed to assign jag-ir s in the Konkan region to him in lieu of military service. However, after the failure of the Bijapur campaign, Jai Singh began to retreat in October 1666. 213 Aurangzeb then recalled him from the Deccan. Jai Singh was a battlei eld commander, so his dispatches give some idea of the attitudes and ethics of warfare of a Hindu commander in the Mughal service. As Jai Singh advanced into Maharashtra, Shivaji send his agents to engage in diplomatic negotiations. Jai Singh wrote to Aurangzeb: ‘After the arrival of the imperial army near Pabal, Shiva’s agents began to visit me, and again up to my arrival at Pune they twice brought letters from him. But I gave no answer, and send them back in disappointment. I know that unless a strong hand was laid on him, his words and sto-ries would not contain a particle of truth.’ 214 Jai Singh was aiming to achieve the subjugation of Shivaji through the implementation of orga-nized violence. Sometime later, Jai Singh agreed to receive Shivaji’s envoy. Jai Singh noted in his dispatches: ‘I listened to what Shiva had written. Its purport was, “I am a useful servant of the imperial ... and many services can be secured from my humble self. If the Mughal Army turns to the invasion of Bijapur, such a course would be better than undergoing the many hard-ships (of campaigning) in this hilly region ... of difi cult paths and stony soil.”’ 215 Shivaji was aware that his leverage depended on utilizing the dif-i cult terrain of Maharashtra. Maharashtra is divided into three regions: the Konkan, the Ghats and the Desh. The steep Ghats rise sharply from the Konkan coast and are separated by peaks and a few passes. The mountains are wooded, and food and fodder were scarce, thus making it difi cult to deploy a large army. The Ghats were also protected by numer-ous mountain forts. In addition, Shivaji commanded 10,000 soldiers and controlled several forts. 216 Shivaji’s objective was to become a junior partner of the Mughal Empire in the Deccan or at least to buy time by making a temporary truce with the Mughals so that he could reorganize his army and realm and continue the struggle later. Jai Singh responded to Shivaji in the following words: ‘The imperial army, countless like the stars ... Do not put your faith in your hills and 213 Haft Anjuman , pp. 8, 37. 214 Ibid., p. 49. 215 Ibid., p. 49. 216 Gordon, The Marathas , pp. 12, 73.

If you desire your own life and safety, place in your ear the ring of servitude to the slaves of the imperial court.’ 217 Jai Singh’s strategic deployment of the army becomes clear in the fol-lowing lines: ‘And I divided my army, sending Daud Khan and Raja Rai Singh to plunder Shivaji’s country, and appointing one party to guard the camp and to go rounds, and another party to forage and patrol – who were to remain constantly in the saddle.’ 218 Jai Singh, in addition to pos-sessing a mobile i eld army, also had a force with siege engines, which engaged in static siege warfare against Shivaji’s forts. Rather than engaging in a frontal battle in the style of Prithviraja III, Jai Singh enunciated a sophisticated from of warfare that included elements of kutayuddha . Jai Singh, in accordance with Kautilya’s kutayuddha , resorted to bribery to win over Shivaji’s supporters in order to weaken him before engaging in a battle. Jai Singh reported to Aurangzeb that while Shivaji’s country was being plundered by the Mughal cavalry, his troops were simultaneously being seduced by the Mughals. The Mughals, by giving safety passes and bribes, encouraged desertions from Shivaji’s army. 219 Politics rather than religion determined the behaviour of both Hindu and Muslim rulers. The sultan of Bijapur was afraid that after subjugating Shivaji, the Mughals would turn their military machine against Bijapur. So the sultan was eager to aid Shivaji against the Mughals. Aurangzeb ordered simultaneous campaigns against both Shivaji and Bijapur. Jai Singh counselled caution in order to prevent the emergence of an anti-Mughal front by the triple powers (Marathas under Shivaji, Bijapur and the Golkunda sultanates) in Deccan. Jai Singh advised the emperor that to render Shivaji hopeless would only drive him into an alliance with Bijapur. When the Mughals attacked Bijapur, in order to prevent the sul-tan of Golkunda from joining Bijapur, Jai Singh followed a policy of moderation towards Golkunda. Jai Singh noted that it would be highly expedient to show excessive imperial favour to Qutb-ul-mulk, the ruler of Golkunda, for the purpose of putting him off guard and inducing him to give up the idea of joining the Bijapuris. 220 217 Haft Anjuman , pp. 49–50. 218 Ibid., p. 50. 219 Ibid., p. 50. 220 Ibid., pp. 51, 84.

Unlike Jayanaka, who emphasized only dharmayuddha , Jai Singh, for practical reasons, was willing to use at least some aspects of kutayuddha at certain times. Blatant kutayuddha would have left the Mughals without any allies for future campaigns. After captur-ing Purandar Fort, Jai Singh wrote that a demonstration of the power of the imperial army might make Shivaji eager to tread the path of submission. 221 Mughal warfare did not consist merely of theatrics, spectacles and coercive diplomacy, as Jos Gommans argues. 222 Mughal warfare also involved bloodletting. About the siege of the Khadkala Fort, Jai Singh describes the use of artillery i re to demolish the gates and bastions. 223 In contradiction to dharmayuddha , Jai Singh was not averse to attack-ing and destroying the retreating enemy. Jai Singh was probably inl u-enced by the thirteenth-century Persian work Adab ul Harb, by Fakhr-i Mudabbir, which, like Arthasastra, emphasizes conducting tactical retreat and attacking a retreating foe. 224 The Mughals used siege artillery in this encounter. In accordance with Sukranitisara ’s paradigm, Jai Singh was waging asurayuddha . At the commencement of the Bijapur campaign, Jai Singh, in his dis-patches to Aurangzeb, stressed the importance of siege artillery. He noted that the fort of Bijapur was defended by many cannons. In order to ren-der them useless, and to accomplish the task (of conquering Bijapur), Jai Singh demanded i fty cannons. Mounted musketeers also played an important role in the Mughal order of battle. Jai Singh pleaded with the emperor to increase their numbers in his army. 225 Thus, we see the force structure of the contingents under the Rajput chiefs was changing with time. From a cavalry-centric army under Prithviraja III during the twelfth century, gunpowder weapons had become an integral part of warfare by the seventeenth century. Though gunpowder weapons initially were regarded as elements of kutayuddha , 221 Ibid., p. 57. 222 Jos Gommans, Mughal Warfare: Indian Frontiers and High Roads to Empire, 1500–1700 (London/New York: Routledge, 2002 ). 223 Haft Anjuman , pp. 57–8. 224 Sarkar, Some Aspects of Military Thinking and Practice in Medieval India , pp. 5, 31, 33–5. 225 Haft Anjuman , pp. 69–70.

Now, let us shift the focus to the Marathas, who could be categorized as the ‘Rajputs of Deccan’. Two Marathi Poems and Anti-Muslim Heroic Resistance by the Hindus The term ‘Maharashtra’, writes Stewart Gordon, refers to the area in western India where Marathi was the dominant language. Though the term ‘Maharashtra’ was mentioned from i rst century CE , due to devel-opments in the Marathi language the emergence of a dei nite linguistic region occurred between 800 to 1300 CE . The term ‘Maratha’ refers to the landholding castes who gained power, prestige and wealth because of service in the army and thus differed from the kunbis , who were culti-vators, iron workers and tailors. Gordon asserts that there were certain similarities between the rise of the Rajput and Maratha warrior groups. By dint of service in the army and translating their service into land grants in local society, a family became Rajput. In order to strengthen their cultural identity, the Rajputs resorted to ending widow remarriage, changed their dress and eating patterns and provided patronage to the local shrines. Similarly, in Maharashtra, successful military service dif-ferentiated many families from the ordinary cultivators. Imam (tax free land grants) and watan (hereditary jagir s) grants further increased the power and status of these families at the local level. Simultaneously, a new ethic developed that emphasized a martial ethos, hunting, changes in dress (e.g., a more complicated turban) and diet patterns, the use of genealogists and restrictions on widow remarriage. Such caste behav-iour, especially such things as seclusion of women and an elaborate tur-ban, could not be emulated by poorer farmers. This in turn differentiated them from the Marathas. These changes were solidii ed into a kinship network. The rise of the Maratha gentry was further i nanced by wealth accumulated through grants of revenue farming. The families that held such service grants established their power in certain territories. Thus, they became a new landed elite and not merely a service elite. The vari-ous Maratha families did not develop territorial possessions with clearly dei ned borders. Families with clusters of nested rights often interpen-etrated other families’ rights. This resulted in tension and occasional i ghting among the various families and also enabled an extra-regional power to manipulate the families against each other. For instance, during "},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"Hinduism and the Ethics of Warfare in South Asia200the i rst half of the seventeenth century, Shivaji’s mother’s family joined the Mughal side. 226 While the Sivabharata deals with the origins of Maratha power under Shivaji, the Maharashtra Purana describes the expansion of the Maratha Empire in eastern India. The Marathas are portrayed as heroes in the former poem but as somewhat villainous in the latter work. The Sivabharata does not mention the fact that many of the great Maratha families emerged because of their military service in the Muslim sultanates of Deccan. 227 The Marathas initially rose to fame under the Abyssinian Ahamdnagar noble Malik Ambar, who maintained 10,000 Maratha light cavalry in 1609. 228 Shivaji, the second son of Shahji Bhonsle and Jijabai, was born in 1627 (or February 1630) in the hill fort of Shivner in the northern part of the Pune district of Maharashtra. 229 During the second half of the seven-teenth century, Shivaji became the greatest threat to the Mughal Empire; Aurangzeb used to refer him as the ‘mountain rat’. Sivabharata (The Epic of Shivaji) was written in Sanskrit and was in part a product of seventeenth-century Marathi culture. Shivaji employed a Marathi court poet named Kavindra Paramananda, who wrote the Sanskrit epic poem to record the history of his patron’s rise to power. 230 James W. Laine notes that the poem Sivabharata is an assertion of Hindu political identity in response to the cultural and political threat posed by Islam. 231 Si vabharata tell us: Here Shivaji i ghts with Turks, Whom he had descended to earth to strike. 232 Laine says that Sivabharata is an example of ‘vulgate epic’. This means that the poem represents the Hindu heroic legend of Shivaji’s life by sup-plying numerous elements of pathos and tragic heroism, describing the death of a great warrior battling evil opponents in order to conserve 226 Gordon, The Marathas , pp. 10, 15–17, 35, 59. 227 Ibid., p. 17. 228 Radhey Shyam, Life and Times of Malik Ambar (New Delhi: Munshirasm Manoharlal, 1968 ), pp. 146–8. 229 The Epic of Shivaji, Kavindra Paramanandas Sivabharata , a translation and study by James W.

Bahulkar’s interpretation, Sivabharata is a historical mahakavya (great poem). The function of the mahakavya is to describe the heroic acts of the kings (who are at times compared to the deities) or of the Kshatriya heroes who achieved kingship. Despite erotic and heroic elements, the story is generally drawn from history. The structure of the mahakavya can be described as sargabandha , which means a composition consisting of several cantos. A canto comprises anywhere from 30 to 200 stanzas. 234 The poem is comprised of one hundred thousand verses. 235 Bahulkar notes that instead of calling the poem Sivacharita (Life of Shivaji), the poem is called Sivabharata , since Paramananda’s model was the Mahabharata . The Mahabharata begins with a dialogue between a bard and a Brahmin rishi ; Sivabharata begins with Paramanda describing Shivaji’s exploits to the Brahmin pundit s at Kasi (Benaras). 236 While Mahabharata tells the story of the King Bharata and his descendants, Sivabharata describes the story of King Shivaji. 237 Paramananda claims that Shivaji decided to i ght the Muslims because Lord Shiva appeared to him in a dream and ordered him to get rid of the Muslims, who were demons in their previous births and had acquired power through tapa s. 238 Paramananda, the panegyrist of Shivaji, portrays the struggle between his patron and the Bijapur Sultanate’s Muslim General Afzal Khan as the war between good and evil. 239 Afzal Khan is portrayed by Paramananda as the embodiment of adharma : He is like a mountain of sin, Completely a man of passion, Determined to obstruct The path of caste- dharma s.... He is the opponent of all dharma s, And supporter of all adharma s. 240 233 Sivabharata , Introduction, p. 23. 234 Sivabharata , ‘The Sivabharata in the Context of Classical Mahakavya Literature’, S.

Afzal Khan desecrated the Hindu places of pilgrimage, especially Pandharpur, while advancing to meet Shivaji. This rel ected the growth of sectarian orthodoxy in the declin-ing Bijapur Sultanate. The above-mentioned act by Azfal Khan alienated the local deshmukh s (high-caste Hindu landlords of Maharashtra), who could have provided local knowledge about the terrain and Shivaji’s hide-outs as well as supplies for the Bijapur army. From May to November, both Afzal Khan’s and Shivaji’s forces maneuvered. Shivaji retreated to the Pratapgad Fort and stationed his forces in the jungles of Javli. Afzal Khan’s army, comprised of heavy cavalry, was suited for a decisive battle in the plains and could not deploy effectively in the narrow mountain-ous passes. Further, Afzal Khan lacked siege equipment. So Afzal Khan surrounded Pratapgad and waited. Both sides faced difi culties. While Shivaji was not getting supplies from outside the fort, Afzal also was unable to procure supplies from the surrounding countryside. Shivaji agreed to meet Afzal at the walls beneath Pratapgad, in a clearing in the dense forest whose trails were known only to Shivaji’s followers. In this locale, Afzal Khan could bring only 1,500 of his followers. The meeting was set up under an agreement that the two leaders would meet alone. A decade earlier, Afzal had used such a truce to imprison a Hindu gen-eral. Both men came armed. Shivaji wore chain mail under his clothes and a metal skull protector under his turban and carried a sword plus sharpened baghnak s (iron claws). The two men fought, and Shivaji dis-emboweled Afzal with his iron claws. Then, at a signal from Shivaji, his followers fell upon Afzal Khan’s unsuspecting guards. The death of Afzal and the surprise attack of the Marathas resulted in the complete defeat of the Bijapuri army. 241 Laine writes that Shivaji’s killing of Azfal Khan represents violent sac-rii ce and demon slaying that had its origins in the vedic literature. When Shivaji clashed with the Mughals, the former is portrayed in the poem as Rama i ghting Ravana (Aurangzeb). 242 Shivaji, like Prithviraja III, is also regarded as the incarnation of Lord Vishnu, deputed to cleanse the earth from the domination of the mlechcha s. 243 The Muslims are depicted as both mlechcha s and yavana s in Sivabharata .

Sivabharata narrates: Dharma is declared to be The very self of the seven membered Kingdom. .... The rise of enemies ... adharma ; 246 Shivaji, in Paramananda’s view, was immersed in classical Hinduism. About his education, Sivabharata tells us: Clever and knowledgeable in many subjects: Mythology and scripture, politics and classics, Mahabharata and Ramayana . 247 As regards both external and internal policies, Shivaji, claims Paramananda, followed policies l avoured with ‘Hinduism’. Shivaji wrote a letter to Jai Singh asking him to desert Aurangzeb in order to pro-tect Hinduism. 248 Before Shivaji crowned himself as king, he made a pil-grimage to the shrines of Prasurama and Bhavani Goddess at Pratapgad. Shivaji believed in the classical Hindu Saptanga theory. Sivabharata tells us the kingdom’s bodily members are seven: First the king, then the prime minister, Then realm and great wealth, Then allies, forts and armies. ....

Shivaji’s cabinet was comprised of eight ministers who were called asta-pradhan s. 250 Gordon claims that due to the demands of reality on the ground, Shivaji was not totally anti-Muslim. He welcomed Muslim recruits into his army (probably due to their technical skill in gunnery and horse riding). The Pathans from Bijapur joined Shivaji’s army. This was probably an act of realpolitik taken by Shivaji in order to weaken the neighbouring Muslim monarchies. During the confrontation with Afzal Khan, Siddi Ibrahim supported Shivaji. Another Muslim commander in Shivaji’s army was Nurkhan Beg. And Muslim qazi s (judges) continued to function in the regions occupied by Shivaji. 251 Paramananda draws several parallels between Shivaji and the Pandavas. Paramananda portrays Shivaji as a warrior saint like Arjuna; though performing violent acts, Shivaji remained in control of his senses like a yogin . 252 Shivaji, the warrior yogi like Arjuna, is both pratapi (brave and heroic) and vijitendriya (having control over the senses) and a mahatapi (ascetic). 253 Paramananda writes that he was born an avatar (incarna-tion), like the second Arjuna. 254 Shivaji’s escape from the Mughal durbar at Agra to Deccan in 1665 in the guise of a mendicant in order to escape Aurangzeb’s guards is compared to the wandering of the Pandavas in the forest in order to escape Duryodhana’s force. Ultimately, writes Laine, a Hindu hero achieves the pinnacles of heroism by sacrii cing his own life, that is, by dying in battle. 255 This is equivalent to achieving viragati for the Rajputs. After the death of Shivaji, the Marathas spilled into north and east India. The Maharashtra Purana is an eighteenth-century Bengali poem of 716 lines that discusses the Maratha invasions of Mughal Bengal. The Maratha incursions into Bengal started in April 1742, when Raghuji Bhonsle, the Maratha sirdar (chieftain) of Nagpur, sent his general Bhaskar 249 Sivabharata , Canto Sixteen, p. 215. 250 Sivabharata , Introduction, p. 25. 251 Gordon, The Marathas , p. 66. 252 Sivabharata , Introduction, p. 13. 253 Sivabharata , p. 45. 254 Sivabharata , Canto One, p. 49. 255 Sivabharata , Introduction, pp. 21, 25.

Alivardi was initially the governor of Bihar. In 1739, he rebelled against his master, Nawab Sarfaraz Khan, and seized power by killing Sarfaraz in battle. Alivardi proceeded to Murshidabad (the capital of Bengal Subah ) with a strong army on the pretext of hav-ing an interview with Sarfaraz. Sarfaraz, unaware of Alivardi’s treach-ery, went out to meet him with a small force and was killed in a battle in 1740. Alivardi ruled from 1740 to 1756. 257 The Maharashtra Purana tells us that Alivardi, after campaigning against some rebels in Orissa, was returning to his capital, Murshidabad, when the Maratha cavalry surrounded him near Burdwan city, some seventy miles from Calcutta. What actually happened was that after the death of Sarfaraz, Murshid Quli Khan (not to be confused with Murshid Quli Khan, the i rst Nawab of Bengal), the son-in-law of Shuja-ud-Daulah and governor of Orissa, declared war against Alivardi. Alivardi defeated Murshid at Balasore, and Murshid Quli escaped to Deccan and took refuge with Asaf Jah, the Nawab of Hyderabad. Mir Habib Ardistani, the Bakshi (paymas-ter) of Murshid Quli, went to Raghuji and encouraged him to attack Bengal under Alivardi. 258 In May 1751, after repeated invasions by the Marathas, Alivardi signed a treaty with Raghuji under which he agreed to give Orissa to the former and also agreed to pay Rs 1,200,000 annu-ally as chauth . The Maharashtra Purana covers the early part of the story until the treacherous murder of Bhaskar by Alivardi. 259 The author of the Maharashtra Purana is a poet named Gangaram, a Bengali Hindu, but we do not have any details about his background. Edward C. Dimock Jr. and Pratul Chandra Gupta assert that the poet not only lived during the time of Maratha depredations but also seems to be familiar with the districts (Burdwan, Bankura and Birbhum) that were ravaged by the Marathas.

"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"Hinduism and the Ethics of Warfare in South Asia206there exists an earlier Sanskrit poem titled Citracampu written in 1744 by Vanesvara Vidyalankara, the court poet of the Maharaja of Burdwan. Compared to Citracampu , which is more concerned with poetic effect, the Maharashtra Purana gives more accurate, rich and thick histor-ical descriptions of the Maratha raids into Bengal. For instance, the Citracampu states that the superior mobility of the Marathas gave them an advantage over the nawab ’s troops and that the Maratha cavalry could travel a hundred yojana s (one yojana is equivalent to eight miles) in a day. So, instead of accurate description of the speed of Maratha cavalry, the Citracampu focuses more on metaphorical effect. However, both the Citracampu and the Maharashtra Purana emphasize the negative effects of the Marathas’ pillage and plundering on Bengal’s civil society. Another poet, Bharatchandra Ray (1712–60), in his Annandamangal , writes that Raghuji sent Bhaskar Pandit with i erce troopers from Maharashtra and Saurashtra for the purpose of ravaging Bengal. Interestingly, Bharatchandra, like Gangaram, came from Burdwan, which was ravaged by the Marathas. 260 Both Bharatchandra and Gangaram accepted the idea that the Maratha raids occurred as punishment for sins committed by the people and the ruler of Bengal. Bharatchandra’s assertion is more communal as he writes that the misconduct of Alivardi’s Muslim army at Bhubaneshwar (a Hindu holy place of pilgrimage in Orissa associated with Lord Shiva and his consort, Goddess Durga) caused the Maratha raids as divine retribu-tion. Gangaram, however, puts the blame on the immoral conduct of the common people of Bengal, which generated sin and brought about the Maratha depredations as divine punishment. 261 Raja Sahu was the grandson of Shivaji. He had been a Mughal pris-oner and was freed after Aurangzeb’s death in 1707. Under Sahu, the peshwa (prime minister) became powerful, and the Maratha Empire con-tinued to expand until Sahu’s death in 1749. The Maharashtra Purana notes that on Lord Brahma’s (creator of the world) advice, Lord Shiva told his agent Nandi to enter the body of Raja Sahu, who would cleanse the earth of the sins. 262 The Maharashtra Purana continues: Raja Sahu ordered Raghuji, To collect the chauth from Bengal.

Raghuji attacked Bengal for several reasons. The gradual weakening of the Mughal government in Delhi encouraged the Marathas to expand into Bengal. Also, Asaf Jah, the Nawab of Hyderabad, encouraged Raghuji to attack Bengal in order to divert Maratha pressure away from the northern frontier of Hyderabad. 264 Raghuji send Bhaskar with 40,000 troopers. 265 The Maharashtra Purana explains: ... the Marathas reached Cuttack. From countryside, the troopers were assembled, At Nagpur. .... Bhaskar enquired from his envoy, about the location of the nawab . ....

The Maharashtra Purana notes that Rajaram’s department was caught at a loss due to the sudden intrusion of Bhaskar’s cavalry. The bargi force suddenly surrounded the nawab ’s camp without any advance warning by his harkara s (spies). 267 Initially, some commanders of the nawab ’s army were eager for a i ght with the Marathas. The Maharashtra Purana depicts their enthusiasms in the following lines: ... the nawab said, The Marathas are asking for chauth . The sirdar s present replied, Instead of giving the money to the Marathas, it should be distributed among the soldiers. We all present, should kill the bargis (Maratha light cavalry). 268 Fighting the bargi s was easier said than done. The bargi s cut off all the supply lines to the nawab ’s camp. Not only his army, but the nawab himself suffered from food shortages. The bargi s, equipped with swords, attacked the rear of the nawab ’s camp and plundered his bag-gage. Bhaskar’s force was conducting asanayuddha as propounded by Sukranitisara . Mir Habib, one commander of the nawab , deserted to the Marathas. The nawab and his depleted army somehow survived relying on supplies send by boats one of his subordinates, Haji Sahib. 269 Though the nawab and his army somehow escaped, there was no escape for the common folks. Gangaram provides a vivid description of the desolation caused among the common people. The farmers with their seeds and bullocks, the shaikh s, the Mughals and the Pathans all suf-fered at the hands of the raiding bargi s. The Maharashtra Purana depicts the large-scale abduction and rape of women by the Marathas. 270 The Maratha depredations gave rise to folk memories that still exist in the countryside of Bengal. Mothers frighten their kids by recounting the fear of the bargi invasion. One folk tales goes: Khoka ghumalo, para juralo , Bargi alo deshe .

Conclusion The concept of just war and holy war in medieval Hinduism should be judged by its own standards and not with reference to Western European Latin Christian traditions. To an extent, Western Christendom’s con-cepts of open-ended just war and Crusade are similar to jihad . And the more limited Byzantine concept of just war, which advocated only defen-sive war, is similar to the Rajput concept of dharmayuddha . There is no clear differentiation among the Hindus between just war and holy war. The Hindus of the medieval era tried to incorporate the new trends in warfare (both conceptual and material) into their bipolar concepts of dharmayuddha and kutayuddha . And these two concepts are also quite open-ended and changed with the context. Interestingly, during the medi-eval period, in the theoretical frame of many Hindus, depending on the context, kutayuddha became dharmayuddha . Due to the impact of the Islamic invasions from the eleventh century onwards, the Rajput con-cept of dharmayuddha was partially replaced by the Sukranitisara ’s more practical approach, which introduced elements of kutayuddha . From the i fteenth century onwards, the Hindu theorists of warfare tried to accom-modate gunpowder weapons within their framework of dharmayuddha against the mlechchas . Marxist historians like Brajadulal Chattopadhyaya, Suvira Jaiswal and Romila Thapar underrate the religious, political and military con-frontations between Hinduism and Islam during the medieval era. Their interpretation is in consonance with their secular political agenda, which is to check the spread of communalism in present-day Indian society. Hinduism in medieval India was obviously an umbrella religion for var-ious cults and sects but at the same time was quite distinct from Islam. The Aligarh School (comprising historians like Irfan Habib, M. Athar Ali, etc.) downplays the Muslim identity of the Mughal rulers and harps on the role played by Hindu-Muslim unity in running the Mughal Empire. To an extent, their assertion holds water. For instance, in Jai Singh’s par-adigm, combat with both Hindu and Muslim polities that opposed the 271 Ibid., p. 28.

Hence, the British period of Indian history is considered to be a break with the past, as pre-colonial India had experienced only non- secular political entities like the Hindu Gupta Empire of classical antiquity and medieval Islamic empires like the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughal Empire. In reality, despite the claim that the British Empire in South Asia ushered in secular modernity, the British used various reli-gions, albeit in a nuanced way, in order to establish their control. The i rst section of this chapter focuses on the British use of religion (here we will be concerned only with the use of Hinduism and not with Sikhism or Islam) in constructing a loyal army from the human resources of the subcontinent. As the anti-colonial struggle intensii ed during the early twentieth century, Indian nationalists also used two forms of Hinduism, aggressive and passive, for attacking the Raj . Now, let us focus on the use of religion, especially Hinduism, in the sepoy army. Hinduism and the Construction of the British-Indian Army Peter Van Der Veer claims that religion had been crucial in the formation of national identities both in India and in supposedly secular Britain. During the i rst half of the nineteenth century, while the Utilitarians tried to dei ne modernity in terms of utility and rationality, the evangelicals attempted to dei ne it in terms of Christian morality. Veer contends that even during the Industrial Revolution, religious expansion occurred "},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"Hinduism and the Ethics of Warfare in South Asia212simultaneously with secularization. Moreover, the impact of scientii c discoveries, especially the evolutionary theories of Darwin, on the decline of religion as a belief system must not be exaggerated. The separation of church and state did not lead, claims Veer, to a decline in the social and political importance of religion. In Veer’s view, the Indians did not look upon the colonial state as a secular entity but as a fundamentally Christian one. 1 During the seventeenth century, the East India Company (hereinaf-ter EIC) was a minor power in South Asia. The EIC’s small forces were repeatedly defeated by the indigenous powers. However, the scenario started changing rapidly beginning in the 1750s. From coastal enclaves, the EIC started projecting power into the interior of the subcontinent. One after other, the indigenous powers were defeated and destroyed. By 1849, the EIC had gained political dominance on the subcontinent. The EIC’s military success was not merely the result of importing the military institutions that had emerged in Western Europe. One of the principal factors behind British military success on the subcontinent was the use of Indian military manpower for imperial purposes. The EIC had to uti-lize indigenous military manpower because the demographic resources of Britain were inadequate for conquering India. Further, Indian manpower was not only cheaper but also more effective in the terrain and climate of South Asia. 2 During the late seventeenth century, the land forces maintained by the EIC were in a sorry state. In 1664, the EIC’s garrison at Bombay num-bered 400 men. 3 In 1699, the EIC’s military force in Bengal numbered 130 men plus some artillerymen. 4 Gradually, the size of the colonial mili-tary establishment rose. This was made possible by effective utilization of South Asian manpower. In 1773, the EIC possessed 9,000 European and 45,000 Indian soldiers. 5 In 1813, there were 21,940 British troops and 1 Peter Van Der Veer, Imperial Encounters: Religion and Modernity in India and Britain (2001; reprint, New Delhi: Permanent Black, 2006), pp. 3, 7, 15, 20, 23. 2 Kaushik Roy, Brown Warriors of the Raj: Recruitment and the Mechanics of Command in the Sepoy Army, 1859–1913 (New Delhi: Manohar, 2008 ), p. 20. 3 Sue Pyatt Peeler, ‘Land Forces of the English East India Company in the Seventeenth Century’, Journal of Indian History , Golden Jubilee Volume (1973), p. 552. 4 Lieutenant F.

Because of South Asia’s huge demographic resources, military service had always been voluntary. Between 1600 and 1800, the population of the subcontinent rose from 150 million to about 200 million. 7 Younger sons of small farmers joined the army in order to supplement their family income, especially after the harvest was over. Moreover – unlike the situation in eighteenth-century Britain, where military service was unpopular 8 – in India there were sev-eral communities who regarded military service, under any power bro-ker, as honourable. National consciousness did not exist among the Indians at that time. 9 The attractions of regular pay and a pension pulled Indians into the EIC’s forces. The British ofi cers won the trust of the sepoys by showing deference to their religious and cultural sensibilities. Language training for communication with the sepoys and sowars was part of British ofi cers’ professional expertise. 10 On 22 August 1806, the commander-in-chief of India ordered the British ofi cers to become thor-oughly acquainted with the ‘native’ languages 11 in order to effectively command the Purbiya s of the Bengal army. The Mughal government recruited musketeers from the high castes (Brahmins and Rajputs) of Awadh and Buxar. They were known as Purbiya s (men from Purab, i.e., east India). 12 The Purbiya s joined the 6 Parliamentary Papers , Reports from the Select Committees on the Affairs of the East India Company with Appendices, Colonies, East India, Sessions 1805–10 (Shannon: Irish University Press, 1971), pp. 112, 131. 7 John F.

The Dal Khalsa of Ranjit Singh also recruited the Purbiya s and the Gurkhas into the infantry. These com-munities were also tapped by the EIC. In the 1820s, most of the sepoys of the Bengal army were Purbiya s. This was partly because the British ofi -cers believed that tall yeomen peasantry made the best infantry recruits and that the higher the caste, the more respectable and well-behaved were the men. 13 The Purbiya s were i ve feet eight inches tall, hence the British ofi cers liked to recruit them. 14 In 1823, the commander-in-chief of India extended the recruiting base of the Bengal army’s infantry to Allahabad, Meerut, Bundelkhand and Rohilkhand. 15 In 1825, the Brahmins and the Rajputs constituted 80 percent of the Bengal army, and Muslims consti-tuted another 10 percent. These three communities came from Awadh, Bihar and Rohilkhand. 16 Most of the Hindu sowars were Rajputs and Marathas. The low castes were not recruited due to the hostility of the high castes who had joined the EIC’s units. 17 The EIC was cautious in introducing Western dress for the sepoys. The introduction of leather cockades along with declining service conditions sparked the Vellore Mutiny among the sepoys in the Madras Army in 1806. According to high-caste Hindu soldiers’ cultural mores, the use of leather resulted in a loss of caste. 18 Feeding a multi-ethnic army made the logistical task complex. The EIC had to take care of the dietary prefer-ences of their indigenous soldiers, which in turn were shaped by culture. Among the South Asian military personnel, the Gurkhas and the Muslims consumed beef. Most of the high-caste Hindu soldiers were vegetarians. The Madras army’s sepoys consumed rice. 19 In the Bengal army’s infantry regiments, dominated by Brahmins, messing was impossible. The caste rule was that a Brahmin could not touch food that had not been prepared by himself or his relatives or by members of his own gotra (sub-division 13 Court of Enquiry into the Barrackpur Mutiny, Minutes of Evidence, 1824, vol. 11, p. 479, National Archives of India (henceforth NAI), New Delhi. 14 Captain A.

So messing was not possible for the Brahmins, and each Brahmin soldier prepared his own food (rice, ghee [clarii ed butter] and vegetables) and ate alone. However, during campaigns, they depended on puris (fried bread made of wheat) and laddus (sweetmeats), which they prepared and carried in haversacks. 20 The British-ofi cered Indian army was used before the 1857 uprising to annex the various independent kingdoms of the subcontinent. After 1859, the British-led Indian army was used for internal policing, that is, for guarding India against the Indians on behalf of the white masters. To an extent, the Indian army was also used to protect the Raj from a Russian invasion of India through Afghanistan. Before World War I, the Indian army was comprised of 128,854 sepoys and about 25,036 sowars. The Imperial Service Troops (British-commanded armies of the Indian princes) numbered about 22,479 men. 21 The British garrison in India numbered 75,000 personnel. 22 During the two world wars, the Indian army was used as an imperial reserve. Between 1914 and 1918, 877,068 combatants were recruited from India. 23 Between 1919 and 1930, the per-centage of recruits supplied by Punjab and North-West Frontier Province rose from 46 percent to 58.5 percent. The percentage of Nepal, Garhwal and Kumaun rose from 14.8 percent to 22 percent for the same period. 24 Through voluntary enlistment, the Indian army between September 1939 and August 1945 expanded from 189,000 to 2,500,000 men. 25 One of the reasons behind the revolt of the Brahmins and Rajputs of the Bengal army in 1857 was the fact that they did not like the British policy of overseas deployment. The British frequently used the Bengal army as an imperial reserve, but the high-caste soldiers believed that crossing the kalapani (sea) resulted in loss of caste. During the pre-1857 era, the British relied on caste categories to recruit selected communities 20 Bingley and Nicholls, Brahmins , pp. 15, 43. 21 S. D.

However, the 1857 mutiny of the Bengal army resulted in the replacement of a policy of categorizing Indian communities by caste with a policy based on race. 26 For the British, there was much similarity between caste and race. Religious, occupational and hereditary factors determined the nature of a caste/race in British eyes. 27 Important scholar-ofi cials of the Raj like W. W. Hunter and Herbert Risley conceived of castes as ethnologically based races. 28 From the late nineteenth century, the Martial Race theory shaped recruitment policy. According to the Martial Race theory, only selected communities on the subcontinent, for biological and cultural reasons, were capable of bearing arms. The father i gure of the Martial Race theory was Lord Roberts (the commander-in-chief of India from 1885 to 1893). In 1882, Roberts, then commander-in-chief of the Madras army, argued that the people inhabiting west and south India lacked courage and possessed inferior physiques. 29 He believed that the i ghting races of the subconti-nent were the Sikhs, Gurkhas, Dogras, Rajputs and Pathans. 30 The Dogras recruited from eastern Punjab and the hills of Jammu and Kashmir were actually Rajputs who inhabited the mountainous regions of the above-mentioned provinces. 31 The imperial belief was that the vedas designated the Rajputs as warriors. 32 T able 6.1 shows that the ‘martial races’ dom-inated the British-led Indian army just prior to World War I. Roberts’s concept inl uenced the British ofi cers even during the Second World War. For instance, in July 1943, Lieutenant-General G. N. Molesworth noted that the virile races were the Sikhs, Punjabi Muslims, Rajputs, Dogras, Pathans and Jats. 33 26 David Omissi, ‘“Martial Races”: Ethnicity and Security in Colonial India, 1858–1939’, War & Society , vol. 9, no. 1 (1991), pp. 6–7. 27 Peers, ‘“Habitual Nobility”’, p. 548. 28 Chandar S.

The objective was to observe and study the world outside Europe in order to understand it. An urge to count and classify the various things the British encountered, writes Thomas R. Metcalf, characterized much of the Victorian intellectual programme. 35 DeWitt Ellinwood says that the British belief in racial distinctions was amalgamated with India’s social distinctions – especially differences of caste, religion, and occupation – and the product was the Martial Race theory. 36 Philip Constable asserts that the Martial Race theory was not Table 6.1.

Brigadier-General C. G. Bruce noted in 1927 that the term ‘Gorkha’/‘Goorkha’ (later ‘Gurkha’) was actually a construction of the British. The term originally referred to a small state in the Kathmandu Valley. The ruler of this state unii ed Nepal during the late eighteenth cen-tury. The subjects of this kingdom, who were an amalgam of Mongolian hill tribes, Newars, Rajputs, Brahmins and other menial clans, were called Gorkhalis after their patron saint, Gorakh Nath. The British used the term ‘Gurkhas’ to refer to the conglomeration of ‘military races’ found mostly in central Nepal and parts of west and east Nepal. 38 During the mid nineteenth century, the British obtained recruits from Kumaun and Garhwalis, and they were also categorized as Gurkhas. 39 Thus, ‘Gurkha’ was never a homogeneous category. Linguistic and cultural boundaries divided the men from Nepal who joined the British-Indian army. 40 The Raj’s policy makers accepted the theory of an Aryan invasion of India. It was believed that the Aryans, the original martial race, after con-quering the land of the Dravidians, had settled in north India. For occu-pational purposes, three groups emerged within the Aryans: Brahmins, Kshatriyas or Rajputs, and Vaisyas. The second group had provided hereditary warriors to the subcontinent from time immemorial. In the 1920s, Professor R. L. Turner argued that during the medieval age, when pressed by the Muslim invasion of India, many Aryan groups like the Rajputs had migrated from north India into Nepal. These Rajputs inter-married with the Mongoloid tribes of Nepal, and their offspring inherited the martial instincts of their Rajput forefathers. 41 They were the Gurkhas of the Sepoy army. 37 Philip Constable, ‘The Marginalization of a Dalit Martial Race in Late Nineteenth- and Early Twentieth-Century Western India’, Journal of Asian Studies , vol. 60, no. 2 (2001), p. 443. 38 W.

"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"Hindu Militarism and Anti-Militarism in British India219 The Martial Race theory, in the view of Heather Streets, was not merely an instrument of colonial control. The Martial Race theory also operated in the case of the British army. For instance, the Scottish Highlanders were regarded as a martial race like the Sikhs and the Gurkhas. Edmund Candler, a military commentator who wrote during the early twentieth century, emphasized that the Gurkhas had the nerve of a Highlander. Heather Streets say that the British military elites used the Martial Race theory to manage global imperial politics. 42 The British media popular-ized the racial and gendered constructs of the savage martiality of cer-tain communities in the guise of the Martial Race theory. In Streets’s view, the Martial Race stereotype represented an idealized version of masculinity. 43 Thus, we have seen that the colonial state used religion in a subtle way. Probably in reaction, the anti-colonial movement also utilized reli-gious ethos and religious symbols. The anti-colonial movement drew on both popular devotional practices and brahmanical ideas for sustaining its struggle against the Raj . Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi’s Anti-Militarism The Indian National Congress (henceforth INC) was set up as a ‘safety valve’ in 1887 by a liberal British named A. O. Hume. 44 In 1907, the INC was divided into moderate and extremist wings. 45 In January 1915, M. K. Gandhi returned to India from South Africa. 46 By 1919, Gandhi was con-trolling the INC. 47 Demonstrations and a massive procession organized by the Home Rule League were held in connection with the Rowlatt Satyagraha in 1919 at Aligarh. The charisma of Gandhi encouraged peo-ple from both the Hindu and Muslim communities to join the movement 42 Heather Streets, Martial Races: The Military, Race and Masculinity in British Imperial Culture, 1857–1914 (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2004 ), p. 1; Edmund Candler, The Sepoy (London: John Murray, 1919 ), p. 18. 43 Streets, Martial Races , pp. 2, 12. 44 John R.

The Khilafat leaders were actually demonstrating grievances against the British following the abolition of the caliphate in Turkey in the aftermath of World War I. In response to India’s contribution of men and materials to the British Empire during World War I, and also to appease the rising nationalist forces, the British Government decided to offer some political concessions to the Indians. In 1917, the Montagu Declaration promised Indians ‘responsible’ gov-ernment. The 1919 Government of India Act (based on the Montagu-Chelmsford reforms) introduced dyarchy (joint rule) in provincial and central government. In 1928, the INC demanded dominion status. In response, to ward off agitation, on 31 October 1929, Viceroy Lord Irwin issued his dominion status declaration. In 1930, Gandhi launched the salt march at Dandi. The stated grievance was that the Indians refused to pay salt tax to an alien government; it was the inviolable right of every Indian to make salt from sea water. 49 Following Gandhi’s civil disobedi-ence campaign, the British government passed the Government of India Act, which allowed the Indian political parties to form ministries at the provinces. In 1942, Gandhi launched his last and greatest mass move-ment, called ‘Quit India’. Ultimately, in 1947, British India was divided into two independent states, India and Pakistan. In 1948, Gandhi was assassinated by a Hindu fundamentalist named Nathuram Godse. 50 The British government accused the INC of being a Hindu body and not rep-resentative of the ‘Indian nation’. There were some elements of truth in the British accusation. There were about eighty million Muslims in South Asia, and Muslims constituted about 25 percent of British India’s population in the early twen-tieth century. 51 Political and social developments within India widened the rift between the Hindu and Muslim communities.

The Arya Samaj was established in Bombay in 1875 and in Lahore in 1877. Similarly, an Islamic seminary was established at Deoband. The net result was consolidation of the religious identities of both Hindus and Muslims on the subcontinent. Millions of people who had lived under tribal and folk traditions and outside the inl uence of the scriptures of the great religious traditions (rigid scriptural Islam, Brahmanism, etc.) were persuaded to make their identities and their commitments clear. As a result, these ‘outsiders’ now began to move towards the different great religious traditions. This, in turn, resulted in a hardening of reli-gious boundaries and identities. Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar (born 1820), an ardent Bengali nationalist and social reformer, proclaimed himself at one level a humanist and an atheist but at another level, for the purpose of reforming the ‘decadent’ Hindu society, he justii ed rationalism on the basis of classical Hindu texts. The shuddhi (purii cation) movement of the Arya Samaj also aggravated Hindu-Muslim tensions. To give an example, during 1923–4, in the Agra-Mathura region, the Arya Samaj persuaded 150,000 Muslims to convert to Hinduism. 52 Towards the end of the nine-teenth century, ganapati festivals and a cow protection movement by Marathi Hindu leaders like B. G. Tilak further inl amed the situation. At the local level in north India, the idiom of discourse was vernacular and religious, and the rhetoric of local politics among the lower classes was Hindu in content. 53 Nationalist leaders like Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Lala Lajpat Rai, Bipin Chandra Pal and Aurobindo Ghosh, who belonged to the extremist wing of the INC, equated the nation with the Hindu com-munity, and Hindu religion became the natural paradigm for describing the national ethos. 54 As a reaction, in 1906, the Muslims demanded sepa-rate electorates from the viceroy. 55 The Morley-Minto reforms of 1908–9 gave Indians some representation in provincial and central government. The British, in order to prevent the emergence of a joint Hindu-Muslim opposition, went ahead with the introduction of separate electorates in the Indian Councils Act of 1909. 56 From then onwards, Hindu and 52 Satish Saberwal, Spirals of Contention: Why India Was Partitioned in 1947 (London/New York/New Delhi: Routledge, 2008 ), pp. xxiii, xxxii–xxxiii, 45. 53 Mclane, ‘The Early Congress, Hindu Populism, and the Wider Society’, p. 56. 54 William Gould, Hindu Nationalism and the Language of Politics in Late Colonial India (New Delhi: Foundation Books, 2005 ), p. 38. 55 M.

William Gould asserts that the widening of communalism in public life was encouraged by the INC leaders’ representation of the national polity using Hindu symbols. 57 The INC’s dependence on Hindu religious symbols and on Hindu organizations like the Mahasabha and the Arya Samaj for mobilizing Hindus further alienated the Muslims, who per-ceived that the INC’s goal was Hindu raj . 58 Throughout the early 1930s, the INC leaders in the United Provinces organized meetings during reli-gious festivals and bathing fairs. The vernacular newspapers associated with the ‘leftist’ and ‘secular’ Congress position also used Hindu religious imagery. 59 In the 1937 election, the INC was able to secure only 5.4 per-cent of the total Muslim seats. In the elections of 1945–6, the Muslim League won 427 of the 507 Muslim seats and formed ministries in the two Muslim-majority provinces, Bengal and Sind. In the provincial elec-tions held in February 1946, the Muslim League won 88.8 percent of the Muslim seats. 60 The failure of the INC to carry the Muslims was due in part to Gandhi’s techniques of mass mobilization, which involved con-cepts like satyagraha , swaraj , sarvodaya , ahimsa , harijan , Ramrajya , and so on. All these idioms were derived from Hinduism, as the following discussion shows. Much of Gandhi’s philosophy could be culled from Hind Swaraj , which was written in November 1909. Gandhi’s objective was to trans-mit the ‘mighty message of ahimsa ’ to the rest of the world through the English language. Anthony J. Parel writes that Hind Swaraj was addressed to the British living in India and Britain and also to expatri-ate Indians who were attracted to terrorism, and also to the extremist wing of the INC. 61 The underground Bengal revolutionaries were sup-ported by the Ramakrishna Mission. The Ramakrishna Mission was organized by Swami Vivekananda during 1897–1902. Its central mes-sage was rejection of Western material superiority and assertion of the spiritual superiority of Hinduism. 62 Interestingly, Gandhi’s philosophy 57 Gould, Hindu Nationalism and the Language of Politics in Late Colonial India , p. 29. 58 Hasan, ‘Congress in Aligarh District, 1930–46’, pp. 337–8. 59 Gould, Hindu Nationalism and the Language of Politics in Late Colonial India , pp. 12, 31–2. 60 S.

In 1921, Gandhi recalled that during his 1909 visit to London, he came in contact with several Indian ‘anarchists’ and felt the need to write a book in response to their ‘immoral’ demand for political violence. 63 In Hind Swaraj , Gandhi linked the moral regeneration of India with its political emancipation from British rule. Gandhi made a distinction between swaraj as self-rule/self-government or the quest for home rule and establishment of a ‘good’ (i.e., righteous) state and swaraj as the quest for self-improvement. Gandhi’s concept is similar to the concepts of inner/greater jihad (self-purii cation of the Muslims) and inferior/lesser exter-nal jihad (expanding Dar al Islam into Dar al Harb ). Gandhi pushed the argument that modern civilization posed a greater threat than colonialism and that the latter was the product of modern civilization. Basically, Hind Swaraj pushed twin interlinked ideas: that worldly pursuits should give way to ethical living, and that there is no room for violence against any human being. Later, in his collected works, Gandhi noted that one cannot build non-violence on factory civilization; ahimsa could be built only on the basis of self-contained villages. Gandhi’s aim was also rapprochement between the Indians and the British. 64 Gandhi critiqued the idea of the extremists and the revolutionaries that expulsion of the British and reten-tion of their political, military and economic institutions would result in swaraj . Gandhi noted that they want the structure of British rule without the British personnel. Then it will not be Hindustan but Englistan, and he is against this sort of swaraj . 65 On 1 November 1921, Gandhi wrote that for him, attaining swaraj is a part of the striving for moksha . 66 In Gandhi’s philosophy there is no religious act without political implications and no political act without religious overtones. 67 Gandhi believed that politics is part of dharma and that political power is a means and not end. 68 On 12 May 1920, Gandhi claimed: I have been experimenting with myself and my friends by introducing religion into politics. Let me explain what I mean by religion. It is not the Hindu religion, which I certainly prize above all other religions, but the religion which transcends 63 Gandhi, Hind Swaraj , Editor’s Introduction, p. xv. 64 Ibid., pp. xiv–xvi. 65 Gandhi, Hind Swaraj , pp. 26–8. 66 The Essential Writings of Mahatma Gandhi , ed. by Raghavan Iyer (1993; reprint, New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 2007) (hereinafter EWMG ), p. 29. 67 The Writings of Gandhi: A Selection, edited and with an Introduction by Ronald Duncan (1971; reprint, Calcutta: Rupa, 1990), Introduction, p. 29. 68 EWMG , Introduction, p. 16.

It was in that religious spirit that I came upon hartal . I wanted to show that it is not a knowledge of letters that would give India consciousness of herself, or that would bind the educated together. 69 On 3 April 1924, Gandhi expounded that his patriotism is a stage in his journey to the land of eternal freedom and peace. In his paradigm, there are no politics devoid of religion. Politics bereft of religion, warned Gandhi, are a death-trap because they kill the soul. 70 Gandhi once stated that there was adequate space in Hinduism for both Islam and Christianity. 71 On 11 August 1920, Gandhi wrote that his life was dedicated to the service of India through the religion of non- violence, which according to him is the root of Hinduism. 72 Gandhi believed that the ancient epics and the vedic literature preached ahimsa . Gandhi explained: Even in 1888–9, when I i rst became acquainted with the Gita , I felt that it was not an historical work, but that under the guise of physical warfare, it described the duel that perpetually went on in the hearts of mankind, and that physical warfare was brought in merely to make the description of the internal duel more alluring.... I do not regard the Mahabharata as an historical work in the accepted sense.... The author of the Mahabharata has not established the necessity of phys-ical warfare; on the contrary he has proved its futility. 73 In an article in Harijan (the newspaper published by Gandhi) dated 3 October 1936, Gandhi wrote that the epic describes the eternal duel between the forces of darkness and of light. 74 On 3 October 1936, in an article published in Harijan , Gandhi clar-ii ed his modii cation of Hinduism as regards ahimsa . Gandhi acknowl-edged that no Hindu ‘prophet’ before him had ever condemned violence in such strong language. Further, Hinduism, in his eyes, is always evolv-ing. The fact that, unlike the Koran and the Bible, there is no single book in Hinduism gives it the scope and l exibility, wrote Gandhi, to adapt to the demands of the time. 75 Gandhi claimed that he derived his concept of dharma from the Bhagavad Gita and the Ramayana .

Gandhi notes in Hind Swaraj that the poet Tulsidas said that pity or love is the root of religion. 77 Gandhi’s concept of anasakti yoga (sell ess, disinterested action) was inl uenced by disinterested action for the greater good as preached by Lord Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita . 78 Gandhi noted that the solution for most, if not all, problems is renunciation of the fruits of action. This is the core around which the Bhagavad Gita is woven. 79 On 21 December 1925, Gandhi had written: When, thousands of years ago, the battle of Kurukshetra was fought, the doubts which occurred to Arjuna were answered by Shri Krishna in the Gita ; but that battle of Kurukshetra is going on, will go on, for ever within us, the Prince of Yogis, Lord Krishna, the universal atman dwelling in the hearts of us all, will always be there to guide Arjuna, the human soul, and our Godward impulses represented by the Pandavas will always triumph over the demoniac impulses represented by the Kauravas. 80 On 16 March 1945, Gandhi wrote that fate is the fruition of karma . Fate may be good or bad. Human effort consists in overcoming adverse fate or reducing its impact. There is a continuous struggle between fate and human effort. Who can say which of them really wins? So we human beings must continue with our work and leave the result to God. 81 Gandhi linked his concept of anasakti yoga to ahimsa in the following manner. He declared that when there is no desire for fruit, there is no temptation for untruth or himsa . 82 To an extent, Buddhism and Christianity also inl uenced Gandhi. On 12 May 1920, Gandhi wrote that Buddha would have died resisting the priesthood if the majesty of his love had not proved equal to the task of bending the priesthood. And Christ died on the Cross with a crown of thorns on his head defying the might of the Roman Empire. Gandhi admitted that he had learnt the message of non-violence, in part, from these great masters. 83 76 Gandhi, Hind Swaraj , Editor’s Introduction, pp. xvi–xvii. 77 Gandhi, Hind Swaraj , pp. 88–9. 78 EWMG , Introduction, p. 21. 79 The Writings of Gandhi , ed. by Duncan, p. 34. 80 EWMG , pp. 33–4. 81 Ibid., p. 184. 82 The Writings of Gandhi , ed. by Duncan, p. 37. 83 EWMG , p. 48.

Gandhi made a distinction between the humanistic Christian civilization and the modern Western civilization based on barbarism. 84 In Hind Swaraj , Gandhi describes the modern barbaric Western civilization as one that, according to the teachings of Prophet Muhammad, could be considered a satanic civilization. And Hinduism calls it the Black Age. 85 Gandhi believed in the use of force in some context. The Hind Swaraj tells us that a petition, without the backing of force, is useless. However, Gandhi made a distinction between soul force and brute force. 86 Gandhi says in the Hind Swaraj : Two kinds of force can back petitions. ‘We will hurt you if you do not give this’ is one kind of force; it is the force of arms, whose evil results we have already examined. The second kind of force can thus be stated: ‘If you do not concede our demand, we will be no longer your petitioners. You can govern us only so long as we remain the governed; we shall no longer have any deal-ings with you.’ The force implied in this may be described as love-force, soul-force or, more popularly but less accurately, passive resistance. This force is indestructible. 87 The Gujarati word for passive resistance is satyagraha , a word derived from sadagraha (i rmness in a good cause). 88 Satyagraha could be dei ned as non-violent resistance. So satyagraha is a sort of ‘just’ technique for waging just war. Satyagraha means truth-force, that is, the power of truth directed towards the promotion of social welfare. Injustice and the attendant hostility could be confronted through an appeal to conscience. However, satyagraha is also a policy of action and non-violent resis-tance. 89 Gandhi’s non-violence requires active resistance to evil. 90 Gandhi advanced an alternate view of heroism for the purpose of conducting non-violent struggle. He believed that heroism is a quality of heart, free from every trace of fear and anger, and geared to exact instant atonement for every breach of honour. Heroism can enable a person to stand alone in times of trial and isolation. 91 84 Gandhi, Hind Swaraj , Editor’s Introduction, p. xxii. 85 Gandhi, Hind Swaraj , pp. 37–8. 86 Ibid., pp. 79, 84. 87 Ibid., p. 85. 88 Ibid., p. 85. 89 EWMG , Introduction, pp. 5–6, 8. 90 Gandhi, Hind Swaraj , p. 86. 91 EWMG , Introduction, p. 6.

Gandhi elaborates in the Hind Swaraj that only fair means can produce fair results. There is harm in the exercise of brute force, never in that of pity. 92 Gandhi in Hind Swaraj quotes the Gospel of St. Matthew: ‘Those that wield the sword shall perish by the sword.’ 93 On 11 August 1920, Gandhi further explained his position. He claimed that he is not a vision-ary but a practical idealist. The religion of non-violence is not meant merely for the rishis and saints. It is meant for the common people as well. Non-violence is the law of our species as violence is the law of the brute. The spirit lies dormant in the brute, who knows no law but that of physical might. The dignity of man requires obedience to a higher law – to the strength of the spirit. On 8 November 1926, in the newspaper titled The Hindu , Gandhi wrote that the trait that distinguishes man from all other animals is his capacity to be non-violent. 94 Gandhi believed that soul force is much superior to brute force. In the Hind Swaraj , Gandhi writes that the force of arms is powerless when matched against the force of love or the soul. 95 On 11 August 1920, in Young India , Gandhi wrote: I do believe that where there is only a choice between cowardice and violence I would advise violence.... I would rather have India resort to arms in order to defend her honour than she should in a cowardly manner become or remain a helpless witness to her dishonour. But I believe that non-violence is ini nitely superior to violence, forgiveness is more manly than punishment. Kshama vira-sya bhushanam . ‘Forgiveness adorns a soldier.’ But abstinence is forgiveness only when there is the power to punish; it is meaningless when it pretends to pro-ceed from a helpless creature.... But I do not believe India to be helpless. I do not believe myself to be a helpless creature. Only I want to use India’s and my strength for a better purpose. Let me not be misunderstood. Strength does not come from physical capacity. It comes from an indomitable will. 96 Gandhi claimed that he would tolerate neither organized violence by the government nor unorganized violence by the people. 97 After the i rst civil disobedience movement (1919–22), Gandhi asserted his inability to 92 Gandhi, Hind Swaraj , pp. 81, 84. 93 Ibid., p. 89. 94 EWMG , pp. 238, 240. 95 Gandhi, Hind Swaraj , p. 85. 96 EWMG , p. 237. 97 S.

He pointed out that the application of violence does not improve the behaviour of the target group or the applicant. However, the exercise of daya (benevolence) results in the moral uplift even of the culprit. For acquiring swaraj , the people should follow satya (truth) and dharma (duties). 100 For Gandhi, sat (truth) is equivalent to God. 101 On 1 October 1931, Gandhi, in Young India , wrote that his daily experience is that every problem would lend itself to a solution if we were determined to make the law of truth and non-violence the law of life. For truth and non-violence are two sides of the same coin. 102 In 1932, Gandhi noted that the pursuit of truth is true bhakti (devotion). It is the path that leads to God, and therefore there is no place in it for cowardice, no place for defeat. It is the talisman by which death itself becomes the portal to life eternal. 103 In February 1946, when the Indian ratings of the Royal Indian Navy rebelled against British authority at Bombay, Madras and Karachi, Gandhi did not approve because the rebellion was wedded to violence. 104 Linked to the concept of satyagraha is the idea of sarvodaya . Gandhi pushed the idea of civil humanism and broadened the concept of dharma to include notions of citizenship, cooperation, equality, liberty and frater-nity. 105 Gandhi believed that human beings could incarnate their latent divinity by deliberately and joyously putting their abilities and assets to practical use for the sake of all (known as sarvodaya ). Sarvodaya means universal welfare. Gandhi, unlike the socialists, did not favour ‘revolution from above’, which involved state violence. Gandhi’s sarvodaya and his attendant concept of ahimsa made class war distasteful and unnecessary. Raghavan Iyer claims that the fundamental presupposition behind sarvo-daya is non-violent socialism, which is as old as the communal sharing preached by Buddha and Christ. 106 Gandhi was opposed to the use of 98 Quoted from ibid., p. 224. 99 EWMG , pp. 38–9. 100 Gandhi, Hind Swaraj , pp. 82, 84. 101 EWMG , Introduction, p. 1. 102 EWMG , p. 243. 103 The Writings of Gandhi , ed. by Duncan, p. 42. 104 Om Nagpal, ‘Naval Revolt – The Last Blow on the British Raj’, Oracle , vol. 1, no. 4 (1979), pp. 22–5; Judd, The Lion and the Tiger , pp. 172–3. 105 Gandhi, Hind Swaraj , Editor’s Introduction, p. xvi. 106 EWMG , Introduction, pp. 1–2, 6, 11–12.

In 1934, when the left wing of the INC, under the leadership of Jawaharlal Nehru, was arguing for rad-ical social change, Gandhi defended the zamindari system and talked of trusteeship. 107 One of the crucial components of satyagraha is self-sacrii ce. Gandhi indulged in daily acts of tapas (spiritual exercise and meditation/volun-tary sacrii ce) while engaged in social and political activities. Gandhi felt that leaders must always share the trials and travails of the human condition; he felt that ubiquitous suffering is the common predicament of humanity, while earthly pleasures and intellectual joys are ephemeral and deceptive. 108 On 11 August 1920, Gandhi noted: ‘For satyagraha and its off-shoots, non-cooperation and civil resistance, are ... new names for the law of suffering. The rishis , who discovered the law of non-vio-lence in the midst of violence ... were themselves greater warriors than Wellington. Having themselves known the use of arms, they realized their uselessness and taught a weary world that its salvation lay ... through non-violence.’ 109 In 1942, Gandhi wrote that non-violence in its dynamic condition means conscious suffering. 110 As D. G. Dalton notes, fasting was the ulti-mate weapon of satyagraha , employed when the other means failed. 111 However, Gandhi at the same time was aware of the limitations of fasting as a political weapon. He once said that you cannot fast against a tyrant. 112 D. A. Low rightly says that the British Empire during the interwar period was not looking forward to giving independence to India, though the British ruling elites assumed that sometime in the distant future, a grant of independence might become necessary. And the British, while devolv-ing power to the Indians at the local and regional levels, simultaneously strengthened their control at the national level. The British were prepared to suppress mass movements but did not aim to eliminate the nationalist leaders. In other words, the British Empire in India was not as oppressive as the Dutch and French colonial empires. If the Conservatives under Winston Churchill had been in power in the 1930s, the British Empire in 107 K. N.

In fact, in Gandhi’s framework, ahimsa is an integral part of yajna (sacrii ce), a practice rooted in the ancient Indian belief in a benev-olent cosmic order maintained by human self-purii cation and self-examination. Ahimsa , for Gandhi, is based on anasakti (sell ess action). Ahimsa in a passive manner means refusal to do harm, and in a posi-tive/active form means the largest amount of love leading to large-scale charity. 114 On 2 May 1935, Gandhi claimed that love has no boundary. My nationalism, noted Gandhi, includes the love of all the nations of the earth, irrespective of creed. 115 However, not every nationalist leader accepted Gandhi’s message of love, peace and non-violence. The great-est challenge emerged from the Bengali politician Subhas Chandra Bose (1897–1945). Subhas Chandra Bose and Hindu Militarism While Gandhi believed that the struggle for independence was a dharm-ayuddha and that in dharmayuddha , physical force can never be applied, Subhas Bose believed that the end justii es the means. Since the object of independence is a dharmik (noble) aim, unfair means (i.e., the use of physical force, alliance with the enemy’s enemy, etc.) were well justii ed in order to achieve the righteous end. In an article printed in the Azad Hind (the ofi cial bi-monthly journal of the Netaji’s Free India Centre in Europe) dated June 1942, Bose bluntly wrote: ‘[N]on-violent civil disobe-dience cannot secure the expulsion of the British from India.... Tell the Indian people that if passive resistance fails to secure the liberation of the country, they should be ready to take up arms in the i nal struggle.’ 116 In another article dated October 1942, which appeared in the Azad Hind , Bose posed a more trenchant criticism of Gandhian philosophy in the following words: 113 Low, ‘The Imprint of Ambiguity’, pp. 467–70. 114 EWMG , Introduction, pp. 6–7. 115 EWMG , p. 245. 116 Azad Hind: Writings and Speeches, 1941–43 , eds.

"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"Hindu Militarism and Anti-Militarism in British India231 But now that the British are engaged in a war with other powers and have been considerably weakened thereby, it has become possible for the Indian people to work up a revolution which will end British rule once for all. But, it is necessary for the Indian people to take up arms in their struggle and to cooperate with those powers that are i ghting Britain today. This task, Gandhi will not accom-plish – hence India now needs a new leadership. 117 Since Bose demanded violent rather than non-violent struggle, he warned his countrymen about the necessary bloodletting. In a broad-cast from Berlin on 7 December 1942, he asserted: ‘Two years and one hundred thousand lives! We must be prepared to voluntarily sacri-i ce one hundred thousand lives in the course of the struggle. If we do so freedom will be ours once and for all.’ 118 In January 1943, Tokyo decided to bring Bose from Germany to Japan to lead the anti-British struggle in India from Southeast Asia. 119 Before Bose departed for Japan in a German U-boat on 8 February 1943, he prepared a speech that was broadcast over Azad Hind Radio in Berlin on 13 April 1943. In this speech, Bose reminded his listeners of the Jallianwala Bagh massa-cre and argued, ‘The blood of the martyr is the price that must be paid for liberty.’ 120 On 6 July 1944, in a broadcast to Gandhi on Rangoon Radio, Bose emphasized: ‘These men and women honestly feel that the British Government will never surrender to persuasion or moral pres-sure or non-violent resistance.’ 121 Bose’s concept of history was coloured by Western secular freedom i ghters and socialism, as well as by Hinduism. Bose was inl uenced by Aurobindo Ghosh (1872–1950), who advocated combating British vio-lence with indigenous violence. Like Balgangadhar Tilak, Aurobindo realized the necessity of setting up secret societies for carrying out violent revolutionary struggle. 122 Aurobindo used Kali (the fearsome Tantric goddess) worship as an instrument to promote revolutionary terrorism in Bengal. Tantra is an esoteric system that heroically sub-verts social norms in order to confront death and suffering and achieve 117 Azad Hind: Writings and Speeches , p. 149. 118 Ibid., p. 179. 119 Lieutenant-General Isoda Saburo, ‘Netaji: The Man’, Oracle , vol. 17, no. 4 (1995), p. 17. 120 Azad Hind: Writings and Speeches, p. 202. 121 ‘Netaji’s Broadcast Address to Mahatma Gandhi over the Rangoon Radio on 6 July 1944’, Oracle , vol. 16, no. 1 (1994), p. 1. 122 Joyce Chapman Lebra, Women against the Raj: The Rani of Jhansi Regiment (Singapore: ISEAS, 2008 ), pp. 10–11.

In 1938, Bose was appointed president of the INC. Bose demanded direct action against the Raj . 124 Due to pressure from Gandhi, Bose resigned from the post of president of All India Congress Committee and in May 1939 formed the Forward Bloc in order to consolidate the left forces under its banner. In March 1941, Bose escaped from Calcutta to Kabul. In March 1941, at Kabul, Bose met Alberto Quaroni, the Italian minister, at the Italian legation in Kabul. 125 On 9 April 1941, in a secret memorandum send to Berlin, Bose noted: The overthrow of British power in India can, in its last stages, be materially assisted by Japanese foreign policy in the Far East. If Japan decides on expansion southwards it will lead to an open clash with Great Britain.... A defeat of the British Navy in the Far East including smashing up of the Singapore base, will automatically weaken British military strength and prestige in India. 126 After arriving in Berlin, Bose organized the Free India Centre and started broadcasting on Azad Hind Radio to India and East Asia in order to undermine British war efforts. 127 From the Indian soldiers captured by the Afrika Korps while i ghting the British forces in North Africa, Bose created the 3,000-strong Indian Legion. However, Germany’s failure to reach India through Egypt or south Russia meant that this body of troops could not be utilized directly for invasion of India. 128 In fact, Nazi Germany’s plan was that, after the successful conclusion of the Russian campaign, German forces would advance into Afghanistan and then into north-west India. 129 On 1 May 1942, Bose, in a broadcast from Berlin, exhorted: ‘On the 10th day of that month in the year 1857, began India’s i rst war of independence.

A. C. N. Nambiar was deputized in the absence of Bose, who at that time was in Southeast Asia organizing the Indian National Army/ Azad Hind Fauj (henceforth INA) for liberating India from the yoke of the British. 131 In July 1943, the INA was resurrected by Bose. Even before the advent of Bose, the Japanese government from 1939 onwards had been collab-orating with another Bengali revolutionary named Rash Behari Bose to organize an anti-British front using Indian prisoners of war (hereafter POWs) and the Indian diaspora in Southeast Asia. After the surrender of the Allied forces at Singapore on 15 February 1942, the Indian POWs were handed over to an Indian military ofi cer named Captain Mohan Singh. With the aid of the Japanese and Rash Behari (head of the Indian Independence League), Mohan Singh formed the INA. 132 Due to differ-ences with the Japanese, Mohan Singh was soon removed from command of the INA. On 25 August 1943, Bose became the supreme commander of the INA. 133 On 5 July 1943, Bose, in his i rst address to the INA at Singapore, emphasized: ‘Throughout my public career I have always felt that though India is otherwise ripe for independence in every way, she has lacked one thing; namely, an army of liberation. George Washington of America could i ght and win freedom, because he had his army. Garibaldi could liberate Italy because he had his armed volunteers behind him.’ 134 Bose’s objective was to raise an army of about 300,000 volunteers from the Indian POWs in Japanese hands as well as from the three million Indian civilians settled in Southeast Asia. 135 When addressing an assembly of Indians at Singapore on 9 July 1943, Bose used the phrase ‘Total Mobilization’. 136 Despite the opposition 130 Azad Hind: Writings and Speeches, p. 98. 131 ‘Celebration of the Foundation of the Provisional Government of Free India, Berlin, 15 November 1943’, Oracle , vol. 15, no. 4 (1993), p. 11. 132 Colonel P.

The philosophy behind setting up this regiment was elaborated in the inaugural address that Bose delivered at the Rani of Jhansi Training Camp at Singapore on 22 October 1943: India could not have produced a heroine like the Rani of Jhansi if she did not have a glorious tradition. The history of the great women in India is as ancient as the Vedic period. The greatness of Indian womanhood had at its roots in those early days when India had its Sanskrit culture. The same India which produced great women in the past also produced the Rani of Jhansi at a grave hour in India’s history. And today while we are facing the gravest hour in our history, I have coni dence that Indian womanhood will not fail to rise to the occasion. If for the war of independence of Jhansi, India had to produce and it did produce a Lakshmi Bai, today for the war of independence of the whole of India, to liberate 38 crores of Indians, India had to produce and shall produce thousands of Rani of Jhansi.... We have the inspiring examples of Ahalyabai of Maharashtra, Rani Bhawani of Bengal, Raziya Begum and Nur Jahan, who were shining administrators in recent historic times prior to British rule in India. 138 Bose’s concept of women actively participating in armed struggle was shaped by the Hindu Mother Goddess (Durga, Kali, etc.) paradigm. The Mother is the most powerful Hindu feminine prototype. The Mother Goddess is backed up by the cosmic power of the universe, shakti , which is also female. According to Joyce C. Lebra, Bose was also inl uenced by Vivekananda, who argued that women should be trained in physical exercise and also with weapons. By contrast, in Gandhi’s framework, Indian women would be like submissive Sita, the epitome of loyalty, chas-tity and courage. Both Gandhi and Bose demanded sacrii ce from women. Sacrii cial ritual was, after all, a central part of vedic religious observance. In fact, the women who joined revolutionary terrorist groups in Bengal during the 1920s and 1930s as well as the personnel of the Rani Jhansi Regiment were imbued with the motivation of sacrii cing themselves for Bharat Mata (Mother India). 139 Carol Hills and Daniel C. Silverman write that Bose’s philosophy – as evident from his setting up of the Rani of Jhansi Regiment, which demanded that women, instead of accepting 137 Sahgal, ‘My INA Odyssey’, p. 5. 138 ‘Inaugural Address at the Rani of Jhansi Training Camp, Singapore, 22 October 1943’, Oracle , vol. 15, no. 4 (1993), p. 7. 139 Lebra, Women against the Raj , pp. 13, 15–16, 22–9.

In February 1944, in a meet-ing with the Japanese military ofi cers of the Fifteenth Army at Maymyo in Burma, Bose urged that if the Japanese were to break through into Manipur, a large-scale uprising of Indians would start in Assam. Further, seeing the INA in action, Bose hoped that the Indian soldiers in the British-Indian army would desert and join the INA in large numbers. 141 On 8 March 1944, the Japanese invasion of Manipur started. 142 In July 1944, Bose elaborated his strategic concept in a speech: So far as I am concerned after twenty years’ experience of public service in India, I came to the conclusion that it was impossible to organize an armed resistance in the country without some help from outside, help from our countrymen abroad, as well as from some foreign power or powers.... In 1940 I read my history once again, and once again, I came to the conclusion that history did not furnish a single instance where freedom had been won without help of some sort from abroad. 143 During November 1944, when Bose visited Tokyo, he tried to meet the Soviet ambassador. Bose’s strategy was to turn to the USSR to conduct the anti-British struggle in case Japan failed in the war. However, the Soviet ambassador refused to meet Bose. 144 On 17 August 1945, Bose left Saigon Airport to go to the USSR via Manchuria. However, he died in an aircraft accident. 145 Conclusion Which communities would be recruited into the British-Indian army, and in what percentages, was to a great extent shaped by imperial poli-cies.

Though India ofi cially claims to be a secular state, Hinduism continues to inl uence statecraft. At the beginning of the new millennium, India is a rising power, if not a mini-superpower. India’s economy is growing at an annual rate of 6 percent, and it is the fourth-largest economy, after the United States, China and the European Union. 1 India’s land frontiers exceed 15,000 km, and it shares land fron-tiers with seven countries. India’s coastline is 7,600 km long, and its exclusive economic zone is over two million square km. The island ter-ritories in the east are 1,300 km away from the mainland. India shares a maritime boundary with i ve countries. 2 And the Indian army, with more than a million men, is the fourth-largest in the world. This chapter shows the inl uence of the Hindu ethos in four areas: grand strategy, conventional warfare, unconventional war-fare and the nuclear issue. Hinduism and India’s Grand Strategy Jawaharlal Nehru (1889–1964, independent India’s i rst prime min-ister 1947–64) believed in the civilizational inheritance of India. He wrote: ‘There seemed to me something unique about the continuity of 1 Bharat Karnad, Nuclear Weapons and Indian Security: The Realist Foundations of Strategy (New Delhi: Macmillan, 2002 ), p. xx. 2 Ministry of Defence Government of India Annual Report (hereinafter MODAR ), 2000–2001 , p. 2. "},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"Hinduism and the Ethics of Warfare in South Asia238a cultural tradition through i ve thousand years of history, of invasion and upheaval, a tradition which was widespread among the masses and powerfully inl uenced them. Only China had such a continuity of tra-dition and cultural life.’ 3 However, he did not overlook differences in India. Rather, he emphasized, ‘cultural unity amidst diversity’. 4 Nehru continues: ‘... a country with a long cultural background and a common outlook on life develops a spirit that is peculiar to it and that it impressed on all its children, however much they differ among themselves.’ 5 Here Nehru is expressing something similar to the approach of the strategic culture theorists. However, Nehru differs from the strategic culture theorists when, unlike the latter, he assumes that the civilizational ethos of Bharat is not coni ned to a mere handful of elites but has imbued even the common masses through the ages. Nehru noted: ‘... for our ancient epics and myths and legends, which they knew so well, had made them familiar with the conception of their country, and there were always some who had traveled far and wide to the great places of pilgrimage situated at the four corners of India.’ 6 Nehru is not alone in identifying a civilizational ethos of India. Jaswant Singh, who served as deputy chairman of the Planning Commission and also as foreign minister in the Bharatiya Janata Party (i.e., the BJP, the Hindu right-wing party of independent India) government (1998–2004), like Nehru and Gandhi accepted the idea that the accommodating capac-ity is one of the principal characteristics of Hinduism. The strength of India’s civilization, in Nehru’s paradigm, lies in its capacity to adapt and assimilate. 7 In Jaswant Singh’s words: ‘ Sanatan is “for all”; it is the ulti-mate of inclusiveness, it is sanatan that subscribes to the noble concept of “ sarvapath sambhav ”.’ 8 Singh asserts that India is accommodative and tolerant because of Hinduism. Unlike the case of countries with Judaic religions, in India other religions have l ourished. In Jaswant Singh’s par-adigm, unlike that of Nehru, the Hindu inl uence is grossly represented. 3 The Essential Writings of Jawaharlal Nehru , ed. by S. Gopal and Uma Iyengar, 2 vols.

"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"Hindu Military Ethos in Post-Colonial India239Jaswant Singh claims that there is only one culture in India. It is Indian/Hindu/ Bharatiya . 9 Jaswant Singh notes the negative effect of Hinduism on India’s grand strategy: The ethos of the Indian state was crippled by another failing. Not just occasional, often an excessive, and at times ersatz pacii sm, both internal and external, has twisted India’s strategic culture into all kinds of absurdities. Many inl uences have contributed to this: an accommodative and forgiving Hindu milieu; succes-sive Jain, Buddhist, and later Vaishnav-Bhakti inl uences resulting in excessive piety and, much later, in the twentieth century ahimsa .... An unintended conse-quence of all these inl uences, spread over many centuries, has been a near total emasculation of the concept of state power, also its proper employment as an instrument of state policy, in service of national interests. 10 The core concept of Nehru’s foreign policy was the Panchsheel (i ve principles), which Nehru explained to the Lok Sabha (the Lower House of the Parliament) on 17 September 1955. The i rst principle is recog-nition by countries of their own and each other’s independence, sover-eignty and territorial integrity. The second is non-aggression; the third is non-interference with each other; the fourth is mutual respect and equal-ity; and the i fth is peaceful coexistence. 11 Jaswant Singh judges Nehru’s Aussenpolitik harshly. He writes that the core of Nehru’s position on China, ‘ Hindi-Chini Bai Bhai ’ and ‘ Panchsheel ’, perished on the bleak heights of the Aksai Chin and the high passes of north-east India in the late autumn of 1962. And these two signii cant foreign policy errors were the direct outcome of Nehru’s idealistic romanticism. 12 One modern Indian analyst notes that even the policy of ahimsa fol-lowed by Gandhi, which to an extent inl uenced Nehru, has elements of realism inherent in it. He justii es Nehru’s ‘peaceful’ policy towards China through the lens of realism. He claims that in the 1950s, the Indian army was going through a process of reorganization. At that time, it was no match for the People’s Liberation Army of China. Hence, Nehru had recourse to Panchsheel . 13 Despite the rhetoric, Nehru also tried to attain 9 Singh, A Call to Honour , pp. 88–9. 10 Jaswant Singh, Defending India (Houndmills, Basingstoke: Macmillan, 1999 ), p. 13. 11 EWJN , vol. 2, p. 163. 12 Singh, Defending India , p. 34. 13 Waheguru Pal Singh Sidhu, ‘Of Oral Judgements and Ethnocentric Judgements’, in Kanti P.

"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"Hinduism and the Ethics of Warfare in South Asia240a hegemonic position for India. As early as 1948, Nehru wrote that India is the natural leader of Southeast Asia, and perhaps of some other parts of Asia as well. This is because there was no other possible leadership in Asia, and any foreign leadership would not be tolerated. 14 Under Nehru’s stewardship, when India tried to follow such a course, it resulted in con-l ict with China. When necessary, Nehru was not averse to utilizing Kautilya’s dictum: ‘my enemy’s enemy is my friend’. Just one year after independence, Nehru observed: ... as a result of Pakistan coming into existence and the growth of an Islamic sentiment, the Middle Eastern countries will tend to become somewhat hostile to India.... Our general policy in regard to them should be one of friendship as well as i rmness.... Afghanistan being anti-Pakistan, automatically is a little more friendly to India. We should take full advantage of this fact. Turkey also is not very much affected by the Islamic sentiment. 15 Tension between Afghanistan and Pakistan over the Durand line, in Nehru’s eyes, was to be used as diplomatic leverage by India. Another streak of Nehru’s realism is evident in the letter of advice he wrote to U. Nu of Burma in 1949. Nehru wrote that any attempt to i ght on all fronts is not likely to succeed and may well end in serious losses. In politics as in warfare, Nehru advised U. Nu, one takes up one’s enemies one by one. 16 C. Raja Mohan, an Indian foreign policy analyst, offers a realist inter-pretation of Nehru’s non-aligned movement. India’s treaty-based rela-tions with Nepal and Bhutan were security alliances whereby New Delhi promised to protect these states against external threats. This constituted India’s inner circle. In the next concentric circle, which comprised India’s extended neighbourhood, New Delhi’s policy was determined more by balance-of-power considerations than by ideological ones. India refused to join the non-aligned bandwagon against the Soviet Union’s interven-tion in Afghanistan in the early 1980s. This is because from the 1970s onwards the USSR had been India’s steadfast ally. At the global level, the third concentric circle, India’s alignment with the Soviet Union was shaped by considerations of national interest. Throughout the Cold War, India determinedly sought to reduce Chinese inl uence in Southeast Asia. There is nothing, then, in the history of India’s non-aligned policy that suggests a fundamental aversion to playing power politics, including 14 EWJN , vol. 2, p. 237. 15 Ibid., pp. 237–8. 16 Ibid., p. 251. "},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"Hindu Military Ethos in Post-Colonial India241alliances. 17 Both Raja Mohan and George K. Tanham (an American ana-lyst) accept the idea that Kautilya’s mandala policy continues to shape India’s grand strategy. 18 In the last decade of the twentieth century, India’s strategic policy rep-resented both change and continuity. The imperatives for change were the disappearance of the USSR and the i scal crisis that led the Narasimha Rao–led INC government in the 1990s to start the process of globaliza-tion. 19 Tanham, taking a leaf from Samuel Huntington’s clash of civiliza-tions scenario, portrays India’s strategic landscape in the following words: India continues to see Islam as a ... threat. Having been invaded by different Muslim peoples for several centuries, then ruled by the Mughals for about 200 years, Indians are understandably sensitive to perceived Islamic threats. Today, they are surrounded on their land borders by seven Muslim countries. Pakistan’s destabilizing efforts in India, supported by other Muslim nations is the clearest and nearest and most important Islamic threat. The recent formation of i ve inde-pendent republics in Central Asia, all with large Muslim populations, is seen as the latest manifestation of the Muslim presence. 20 Even with potentially hostile neighbours, India’s policy is to seek coopera-tion i rst, if possible, with some, if not with all; the last option is war. Swarna Rajagopalan asserts that India’s policy of seeking strategic cooperation with its neighbours is shaped by the ethical security politics derived from the Ramayana . One of the principle themes of the Ramayana is strategic coop-eration for the purpose of tackling the enemy. This is evident in Rama’s stra-tegic alliance with the vanara s for the purpose of tackling Ravana. 21 Hinduism and India’s Conduct of Conventional Warfare On 9 May 1929, M. K. Gandhi declared: This I know that if India comes to her own demonstrably through non-violent means, India will never want to carry a vast army, an equally grand navy and a 17 C.

If her self-consciousness rises to the height necessary to give her a non-violent victory in her i ght for freedom, the world values will have changed and most of the paraphernalia of war would be found to be useless. 22 While Gandhi advocated abolishing the armed forces in free India, Nehru demurred. The latter may not have been interested in matters military but did not completely neglect them. In 1937, Nehru noted: There is no doubt that India can build up an efi cient defence apparatus.... We live in an abnormal world, full of wars and aggression, when international law has ceased to be and treaties and undertakings have no value, and an unabashed gangsterism prevails among nations.... The only thing to be done to protect one-self is to rely on one’s strength as well as to have a policy of peace. 23 Despite the Nehruvian policy of apathy as regards projection of power overseas, India has been very sensitive as far its borders are concerned and has not hesitated to start conventional operations when its borders have been threatened. Tanham offers an explanation: Independent India sees itself as continuing the tradition of non-aggression and non-expansion outside the subcontinent. Nehru’s foreign policy rested on these prin-ciples, and subsequent leaders have followed suit. The tradition of non-aggression, however, has never applied internally. Warfare within the subcontinent has been the norm for centuries. States fought to gain power and wealth, to establish empires, or to destroy them. This seeming paradox with regard to non-aggression arises from the Indian view of the subcontinent as a single strategic area that coincides with Indian national interests. This belief justii ed India’s taking much more aggressive measures – to protect its interest in the subcontinent. 24 Air Marshal R. K. Nehra asserts that post-1947 India’s military response to its hostile neighbours like Pakistan and China has been passive owing to the pervasive inl uence of the Hindu mindset. Too much focus on ahimsa and shanti (peace) is seen by Nehru as the root cause of India’s fragmented approach to matters military. The focus on non-violence in Hinduism, argues Nehra, is due to the pervasive inl uence of Buddhism. In original Hinduism, martial valour was emphasized. Nehra cites the sloka: ‘ Vira bhoga Vasundhara ’, that is, the mighty heroes will enjoy the earth. 25 In a similar vein, Brigadier Kuldip Singh notes, in a monograph 22 The Essential Writings of Mahatma Gandhi , ed. by Raghavan Iyer (1993; reprint, New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 2007) (hereinafter EWMG ), p. 275. 23 EWJN , vol. 1, p. 41. 24 Tanham, ‘Indian Strategic Thought’, p. 77. 25 Air Marshal R. K. Nehra, Hinduism and Its Military Ethos (New Delhi: Lancer, 2010 ), p. 325. "},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"Hindu Military Ethos in Post-Colonial India243published in 2011 , that ancient Hinduism emphasized just militarism. He continues: India’s military mind is as pristine, resplendent and advanced as its longstand-ing civilization. Its inherent philosophy of life and statecraft accorded exalted primacy to warfare, as evident from the veda s, the epic s, Arthasastra and other classics.... Indians were not only men of thought alone, but men of action too. The aggressive combative spirit of ancient Bharata is exemplii ed by its confed-erated military might, which evicted the Greeks, Kushan and Hun invaders from the Indian soil. 26 The retired Indian Lieutenant-General S. C. Sardeshpande writes that India’s passive defence policy throughout its history is a product of the ‘inward looking self-satisi ed attitude’ of the people. This is due in part to the geographical features of India. High mountains in the north and jungle-i lled hills in the east, with sea and ocean along the western and south-ern borders, has resulted in India being an ‘inward-looking geographical entity.’ Hence, the people are satisi ed with their natural geographical frontiers. Throughout history, Indians have not exhibited any extra-territorial ambitions. 27 This geographical inwardness has been further strengthened by cultural passivity. Sardeshpande notes: ‘Preoccupation with spiritualism, theorizing, complacency and plentitude led Indian mil-itarism away from geographical planes to the peculiar planes of glory, honour, sport and kind of ritual.’ 28 The net result throughout history has been a sort of non-lethal warfare. He continues: ‘But perhaps because of cultural identity and stress on spiritualism, wars seldom attained cruel, fanatic or exterminatory proportions. By and large wars remained far less inhuman as compared to those in European and American continents.’ 29 As regards Indian politicians’ attitude towards the armed forces, Nehra comments: ‘... the new rulers of the country suffered from an overdose of ahimsa , which has become a part of their mental make-up; it was lodged in their subconscious. Most of them felt apologetic about militarism. There was a visible lack of enthusiasm about the armed forces in the political class.’ 30 For instance, in 1955, Nehru declared that India’s symbols throughout its long history had never been great military 26 Brigadier K. Kuldip Singh, Indian Military Thought: Kurukshetra to Kargil and Future Perspectives (New Delhi: Lancer, 2011 ), p. 592. 27 Lieutenant-General S. C.

"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"Hinduism and the Ethics of Warfare in South Asia244commanders but men like Buddha and, in our own time, Gandhi, both of whom were messengers of goodwill and peace. 31 Kuldip Singh warns politicians about the importance of military strength for national security in the following words: ‘India’s inherent depth and vitality of dharma , spirituality and wealth of knowledge and natural resources, on their own, could not protect its frontiers. The case of Emperor Asoka bears out how India’s neglected defence system led to national humbling and foreign intrusion, in spite of its otherwise established civilizational grandeur dur-ing his time.’ 32 Because politicians have neglected defence since Independence, claim several military ofi cers, the armed forces have become demoralized. The performance of the Indian army during the 1965 war with Pakistan was below average owing to a defensive mindset and a lack of an aggressive attitude and killer spirit. Nehra gives an instance of the defeatist Hindu mindset prevailing even among the top ofi cers of the armed forces. In 2009, Admiral Suresh Mehta, the chief of the naval staff and chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, publicly stated that India could never catch up with China and that the gap between the two would only widen with time. 33 Kuldip Singh warns: ‘We need to change the attitude and rec-ognize that war undertaken for a noble cause, and as the last resort, it is the highest worship of God.’ 34 Both civilian commentators and military ofi cers suggest that the epics could impart lessons for the modern military. For instance, Waheguru Pal Singh Sidhu claims that the Mahabharata highlights the strategy for breaking into and breaking out of a chakravyu (enemy encirclement). 35 Brigadier G. D. Bakshi writes that principles of war could be gleaned from the Mahabharata . Despite changes in technology, the tactical and strategic principles of warfare remain constant. He comments that the Mahabharata War was a high-intensity war of short duration; it lasted for only eighteen days. All the conventional wars fought by India with Pakistan and China were also of short duration. For instance, the Second India-Pakistan War (1965) lasted for twenty-two days, and the Third India-Pakistan War (1971) lasted for fourteen days. Again, the Mahabharata notes that the campaigning season lasts from November to March. Bakshi notes that independent India’s wars, like the 1962 China-India War, occurred during 31 EWJN , vol. 2, p. 289. 32 Singh, Indian Military Thought , p. 593. 33 Nehra, Hinduism and Its Military Ethos , pp. 331, 337, 351. 34 Singh, Indian Military Thought , p. 599. 35 Sidhu, ‘Of Oral Traditions and Ethnocentric Judgements’, p. 175. "},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"Hindu Military Ethos in Post-Colonial India245November–December. Later, the 1971 India-Pakistan War occurred dur-ing November and December. The Mahabharata emphasizes that wars are to be fought with large numbers of regular soldiers, and the Indian army is comprised of long-service volunteer soldiers from the ‘martial races’. 36 Bakshi notes that in the Mahabharata one i nds two military approaches: the traditional direct approach, enunciated by Bhisma, and the indirect approach as practiced by Lord Krishna and Dronacharya’s son Ashwathama. The latter approach i nds its logical culmination in Kautilya’s kutayuddha . The former approach dominates the Indian mili-tary mind. The direct approach of conducting dharmayuddha – emphasiz-ing restraint, chivalry, a sporting mentality, symmetrical responses, and so on – is responsible for the inefi ciency of Indian tactics. Bakshi continues that in accordance with the dharmayuddha tradition, Indian armour was used during the India-Pakistan conl icts only against enemy armour in a tank-killer role. Indian armour was not used against enemy infantry or for deep penetration of the enemy’s vulnerable l anks due to the ethics of dhar-mayuddha . 37 For instance, during the 1965 India-Pakistan War, an Indian armoured division was ordered to seek out and engage Pakistan’s First Armoured Division in a classic tank-versus-tank battle. It was an attrition-oriented paradigm, and the Indian generalship was further hamstrung by over-cautiousness and rigidity. 38 It is part of our inheritance, Bakshi con-tinues, that chariots must only attack chariots. 39 Here, Bakshi is referring to the Mahabharata and Manusamhita ’s concept of dharmayudha . After analyzing the three India-Pakistan Wars, Bakshi notes in an article: By historical legacy, we are an attrition oriented army. This legacy goes back to the era of the Mahabharata War in 1200 BC. Today, we need to grow beyond tac-tical frontal pushes at the corps level. Our Operational Art must be enhanced in sophistication to include single and double envelopment pincer movements and turning movements.... What we need to recognize is the ... level of Operational Art in the context of limited or unlimited wars in the subcontinent and the dire necessity of outgrowing attrition mindset (which incidentally is a legacy of the Mahabharat War). 40 36 Lieutenant-Colonel G.

He writes: Kutayuddha methods were despised by ‘honourable’ Indian soldiers of the Mahabharata period. The tragedy is that even today our Indian regular soldiers still tend to despise these methods as unethical or unsoldierly. Notice the fact that ofi cers of our intelligence corps have no bright career opportunities vis- à -vis the other arms. It appears intelligence and covert operations are second rate side shows for which only second grade ofi cers can or need be spared. This attitude has been further reinforced by our British heritage. 41 Bakshi’s observation is supported by a fellow ofi cer, Kuldip Singh, in the following words: ‘The poor showing of India’s intelligence system has been an interminable story of unmitigated disaster. The importance of having an effective intelligence organization is highlighted in not only the epic s, but also the Arthashastra constitutes an ageless masterpiece on surveillance and spying, in both peace and war.’ 42 Bakshi claims that the acharya s of the Mahabharata were experts in conducting psychological war. Their main aim at all times was to attack the mind of the enemy commander. 43 If necessary on the basis of historical study, certain aspects of Hinduism, write some ofi cers, need to be revised. Kuldip Singh concludes that the failure of the Hindus during the medieval era was due to passive defence. The medieval Hindu rulers’ failed to pre-empt Islamic invasions and also did not carry the battle to the invaders’ bases. Hence, all the battles were fought deep inside India. Singh is probably referring to Prithviraja Chauhan and the two battles of Tarain with Muhammad Ghori. Aggressive defence and pre-emptive action could have saved the Hindus. And, Kuldip Singh emphasizes, we should learn from such mistakes. 44 C. Coker claims that the principal lesson of Arthasastra is asymmetric warfare. In 1988, the ofi ce of the U.S. secretary of defence concluded that India would seek to deny the U.S. Navy uncontested control over the Indian Ocean and that New Delhi would use asymmetric sufi ciency as a counter. In Indian coastal warfare, subsurface weapons could function as a deterrent. 45 41 Bakshi, Mahabharata: A Military Analysis , p. 74. 42 Singh, Indian Military Thought , p. 593. 43 Bakshi, Mahabharata: A Military Analysis , pp. 74–5. 44 Singh, Indian Military Thought , pp. 593–4. 45 Christopher Coker, Waging War without Warriors?

The latter term refers to intra-state rather than inter-state war. In recent times, the term ‘insurgency’ has connoted an organized movement aimed at the overthrow of a constituted govern-ment through the use of subversion and armed conl ict. 46 Lieutenant-Colonel Vivek Chadha of the Indian army makes a distinction between terrorism and insurgency. In his framework, terrorist movements are based in urban areas, whereas insurgencies establish their bases in rural areas and then graduate to urban regions. 47 Chadha’s dei nition is some-what similar to James D. Fearon and David D. Laitin’s view. They write: ‘Insurgency is a technology of military conl ict characterized by small, lightly armed bands practicing guerrilla warfare from rural base areas.’ 48 Insurgency includes both guerrilla warfare and terrorism. Insurgency and responses to it by the polity concerned (known as counter-insurgency or COIN) together constitute unconventional warfare. A high level of insur-gency and COIN in a country create a civil war. A group of Western scholars argue that civil wars occur more fre-quently in countries with substantial populations belonging to differ-ent ethnic, linguistic and religious groups. 49 India has eighteen ofi cially recognized languages, twelve ethnic groups and seven religious groups that are further subdivided into various sects, castes and sub-castes. 50 Somewhat like Stephen Peter Rosen, Jaswant Singh notes that the cul-ture of divisive politics within India prevents the state from the gener-ating surplus military power needed for power projection outside the country. Jaswant Singh writes that India’s strategic culture has become internalized, i xated upon curbing dissent within the subcontinent rather 46 Emily Spencer and Bernd Horn, ‘Introduction’, in Spencer (ed.), The Difi cult War: Perspectives on Insurgency and Special Operations Forces (Ontario: Dundurn Press, 2009), p. 13. 47 Lieutenant-Colonel Vivek Chadha, Low Intensity Conl icts in India: An Analysis (New Delhi: Sage, 2005 ), p. 25. 48 James D.

This in turn has prevented India from developing its true power, that is, its capa-bility to project power beyond the boundaries of India. 51 In a similar vein, Sardeshpande claims that geographic compartmentalization within South Asia has resulted in political fragmentation despite cultural unity. The net result has been a long tradition of intense internecine warfare within South Asia. 52 Tanham notes that Kautilya long ago warned against the intrigues of foreign kings as a threat to one’s own security, even though the Arthasastra accepted intrigue and the use of internal spies as legitimate self-defence measures. The Indians suffer from a pervasive fear of ‘foreign hands’ at work among India’s unstable neighbours and within India. 53 In Kautilya’s format, the principal threat to the rashtra encompassing the whole sub-continent comes from kopa . This is also the view of various Indian military ofi cers. 54 Like Kautilya, Chadha writes that with external sup-port, an ongoing insurgency can escalate into a regular war between the states. 55 The Pakistani army and especially the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) have been supporting insurgents since the mid-1980s with money, equipment and training. The objective is to exhaust India by giving a ‘thousand cuts’ with the aid of the insurgents. 56 Pakistan’s strategy is to give moral and material assistance to groups like Hizb-ul-Mujahidin, which aim at the secession of Kashmir from India through armed strug-gle and then merger with Pakistan. 57 The transnational connection is also apparent in Kashmir’s case. Al-Qaeda connects sub-national organiza-tions with a trans-national network. 58 Osama Bin Laden declared a jihad 51 Singh, Defending India , p. 13; Stephen Peter Rosen, Societies and Military Power: India and Its Armies (New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1996 ). 52 Sardeshpande, War and Soldiering , p. 126. 53 Tanham, ‘India’s Strategic Thought’, p. 53. 54 Colonel Harjeet Singh, Doda: An Insurgency in the Wilderness (New Delhi: Lancer, 1999 ), p. 141. 55 Chadha, Low Intensity Conl icts in India , pp. 405–6, 419. 56 Amelie Blom, ‘A Patron-Client Perspective on Militia-State Relations: The Case of the Hizb-ul-Mujahidin of Kashmir’, in Laurent Gayer and Christophe Jaffrelot (eds.), Armed Militias of South Asia: Fundamentalists, Maoists and Separatists (New Delhi: Foundation, 2009 ), pp. 136–7. 57 V .

Monica Duffy Toft claims that the proportion of civil wars in which religion has become a central issue has increased over time. Further, religious civil wars are much more destructive than wars fought over other issues. Toft goes on to say that religious civil wars last longer and result in more combatant and especially non-combatant deaths, because while nationalism by nature tends to be a local issue, reli-gion tends to be trans-national. 61 One aspect of the rebellion in Mizoram, the insurgents claim, is protection of the Christian religion against the ‘Hindu’ Indian state despite the post-independence Indian government’s professed secular approach to politics. 62 In north-east India, more than forty insurgent groups are operating. 63 In 1982, more than 200,000 military personnel were deployed in north-east India. 64 Between 1986 and 1996, the Indian army suffered a total of 2,467 dead and 14,359 wounded in its various COIN missions. 65 Kautilya and the Indian military ofi cers following him note that ini-tiating or destroying kopa is a time-consuming affair. Walter C. Ladwig III writes that analysis of India’s COIN policies shows that India has the patience, determination and resources to outlast the insurgents. 66 Both in India and Nepal, the Maoists conceive their armed violence against the state as a sort of dharmayuddha .

Kautilya says that while tyrants are interested in self-aggrandizement, efi cient ‘just’ monarchs are more concerned with the interests of the rashtra . Kautilya warns the king to use danda with a sense of discrimination and by steer-ing a middle course. Kautilya repeatedly emphasizes good governance to prevent kopa . He urges that, if necessary, then righteous customs should be initiated and unrighteous customs abolished. Kautilya notes that the government should be attentive to the cultural sensibilities of people inhabiting troubled regions. The state’s policies should respect the dress, language and cultural behaviour of the people in order to win and retain their loyalty. 68 Proper respect should be shown by the government to the fairs and festivals of people in a disturbed zone, and punishment should be moderate. Kautilya advocates replacement of corporal punishment with monetary i nes and opposes exorbitant monetary i nes that might alienate subjects who have erred slightly. During natural calamities, in order to prevent the anger of the people from crossing the threshold and resulting in kopa , Kautilya warns that state ofi cials must initiate large-scale relief measures to alleviate the sufferings of people in the disturbed zone. 69 The Indian army frequently provides aid to civil operations during natural calamities. Some examples will sufi ce. On 29 March 1999, an earthquake occurred in the Garhwal region. In response, the Indian army distributed food packets, blankets and tents, and the affected civilians were treated by the army’s medical units. During 17–18, October 1999, a cyclone from the Bay of Bengal caused devastation in the coastal areas of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. In response, more than 5,000 army personnel were deployed to the affected areas. They rescued marooned civilians, distributed food packets and provided medical aid. About 22,288 civilians were evacuated; 33,722 civilians were medically treated; 4,259 tons of food items were distributed; and 2,48,000 litres of drinking water was provided. 70 67 Marie Lecomte-Tilouine, ‘Fighting with Ideas: Maoist and Popular Conceptions of the Nepalese People’s War’, in Gayer and Jaffrelot (eds.), Armed Militias of South Asia , pp. 67–8. 68 The Kautilya Arthasastra (hereinafter KA ), Part II, An English Translation with Critical and Explanatory Notes , by R.

Harjeet Singh dei nes dharma as the ethical mode of life that leads to the path of righteousness. Here, Harjeet Singh is obliquely referring to the dharmayuddha concept inherent in Hinduism. And the latter part of the last commandment refers to nishkakarma , that is, doing one’s own duty without looking for any tangible reward. This is a concept lifted from the Bhagavad Gita . The eighth commandment is elaborated so as to use the media as a force multiplier rather than a force degrader. 71 In case of a popular uprising (Kautilya’s kopa ), the personalities of the leaders and public opinion con-stitute, for Kautilya and Clausewitz, the centre of gravity. 72 Public opin-ion is an integral part of democracy, especially in a country like India. In 2005, Chadha asserted that in insurgencies the idea is more important than arms. 73 Lieutenant-General Depinder Singh (who served with the Indian Peace Keeping Force [IPKF] in Sri Lanka in the 1980s) focuses on psychological warfare and public relations as part of COIN operations. 74 Harjeet Singh’s third commandment i nds support in the Arthasastra . The Arthasastra warns that prison ofi cials should not harass or torture pris-oners; especially as regards female prisoners, there should be no sexual harassment, as such a policy is destructive of the legitimacy of the state in the long run. 75 As a point of comparison, the U.S. torture of Iraqi prisoners in 2003 at Abu Ghraib Prison resulted in Iraqi and interna-tional public opinion turning against the American forces stationed in that country. 76 The Indian army, following Kautilya and Kamandaka, believes that no insurgency can be settled by military force alone.

Therefore, a political solution had to be found.... On the military plane we had to mount unrelenting pressure against the insurgents to force them to negotiate at some point in the future.’ 79 In fact, Chadha claims that the only solution to insurgency is a decentralized federal system in the spirit of self-governance. 80 W. Ladwig III claims that India’s l exibility and willingness to redei ne internal borders and political arrangements in order to satisfy the preservationist as well as the reformist goals of the insurgents, is praiseworthy. 81 Nevertheless, COIN cannot be conducted without military coercion. The Arthasastra tells us that military operations should be conducted taking into consideration desa (terrain) and kala (season). Kautilya notes that government troops should be ready to i ght in mountainous or wooded regions and that they should conduct operations with ade-quate l ank guards and a reserve force stationed behind the attacking units. Nocturnal commando attacks, says Kautilya, are to be launched in order to surprise the rebels. 82 The Indian army has recently accepted the doctrine: ‘Fight the guerrilla like a guerrilla’. 83 Rajesh Rajagolan writes that successful COIN requires small, highly mobile offensive patrolling units moving deep inside guerrilla territory. Large-unit cordon and search operations are useless. In fact, moving large numbers of security forces to the sensitive areas alerts the insurgents and allows them to escape the security cordon into the wilderness. 84 In 2004, an American analyst of COIN strategy in Iraq emphasized small-unit operations and careful intelligence work. 85 77 Rajesh Rajagopalan, Fighting like a Guerrilla: The Indian Army and Counterinsurgency (New Delhi: Routledge, 2008 ), p. 107. 78 Singh, Doda , p. 141. 79 Singh, Indian Peacekeeping Force in Sri Lanka , p. 107. 80 Chadha, Low Intensity Conl icts in India , p. 412. 81 Ladwig III, ‘Insights from the Northeast’, pp. 46, 48. 82 KA , Part III, by Kangle, pp. 257–9. 83 MODAR: 1999–2000 , p. 94. 84 Rajagopalan, Fighting like a Guerrilla , pp. 56, 108. 85 Austin Long, On “Other War”: Lessons from Five Decades of RAND Counterinsurgency Research (Santa Monica, California: RAND Corporation, 2006 ), p. 44.

Interestingly, Caleb M. Bartley writes that Sun Tzu also emphasizes the importance of spies and psy-chological operations. 86 In 1970, Brigadier S. K. Sinha noted that sound intelligence is the bedrock for success in COIN operations. 87 Rajagopalan asserts that long-range patrols by small units are necessary in order to gather real-time intelligence about the insurgents. 88 Similarly, Depinder Singh asserts that good and secure intelligence functioning is a force mul-tiplier in COIN campaigns. 89 Integration of the various intelligence agencies is something Indian military ofi cers demand, but the Indian state is yet to construct unii ed, integrated machinery for collating intelligence acquired from the various intelligence agencies. As a result, the Indian COIN strategy suffers. For instance, one reason for the Sri Lankan imbroglio was the fact that the Research and Analysis Wing and the Ministry of External Affairs intelli-gence agencies did not cooperate with the military intelligence agency of the Indian army. The net result was that the IPKF remained in the dark about the strength and intentions of the LTTE and the Sri Lankan armed forces. 90 Al-Qaeda and the other successful terrorist networks around the world heavily utilize spies, and the focus is on human intelligence (HUMINT). 91 Rather than technology, Kautilya focuses on HUMINT and urges that spies be conversant with the culture of the region in which they are deployed. Jaswant Singh emphasizes: India needs to reorganize, reorient and integrate its intelligence sources. It must also update its methodology. The technological revolution underway since the last decade now provides the tools to acquire real-time intelligence of value and give time to plan ahead. Electronic (ELINT) and Signal (SIGINT) intelligence has proved more reliable than simply the routine human intelligence (HUMINT). That, however, does not in any sense dilute the primacy still accorded to HUMINT. 86 Caleb M.

In accordance with Kautilya’s dictum, the Indian state followed bheda against the insurgents. One example: in October 1968, encouraged by the Indian state, the Sema tribal Nagas broke from the Naga Federal Government of Z. A. Phizo and made peace with the cen-tral government. 93 One strategy of the Indian state is to tire out insur-gent militias by provoking internal strife and co-opting some members of the tanzeem s. 94 In 2003, George Fernandez, the defence minister in the BJP’s government, initiated a project within the Defence Ministry aimed at inculcating Kautilya’s kutayuddha as part and parcel of India’s unconventional warfare strategy. Fernandez went on record saying that Kautilya’s principles should be followed much more systematically when i ghting insurgents. 95 To sum up, the Hindu ethic made India’s COIN policy somewhat humane. As a point of comparison, one author argues that the Protestant ethic (emphasizing chivalry, individual sensibilities, etc.) shaped the British COIN policy of using only minimum force against insurgents during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. By contrast, the Calvinist values of the Americans indirectly emphasized brutality in American COIN policy. 96 ‘Hindu’ India and Nuclear Politics On 25 April 1947, Gandhi declared: ‘I hold that he who invented the atom bomb has committed the gravest sin in the world of science. The only weapon that can save the world is non-violence.’ 97 On August 1948, the Atomic Energy Commission of India was set up, with Homi Bhabha, a nuclear physicist, as the i rst chairman.

In response, on 28 and 30 May 1998, at Chagai Hills in Baluchistan, Pakistan conducted a series of nuclear tests. There has always been a pro-bomb lobby and an anti-bomb lobby in India comprised of intellectuals, politicians, bureaucrats and scientists. The anti-bomb lobby pointed to the economic burden of becoming a nuclear power as well as to Nehruvian internationalism and the Gandhian ide-ology of non-violence. The pro-bomb lobby in the 1960s pointed to the threat from China. By the late 1980s, in addition to China, India also faced a nuclear threat from Pakistan. From the 1990s, the pro-bomb lobby has had two wings. The moderate wing inl uenced by Kenneth Waltz (prolifer-ation results in deterrence stability) believes that a small number of nuclear weapons in the hands of India would stabilize the regional scenario. 98 The extreme/radical wing demands a triad (nuclear weapons–equipped air, land and sea-based platforms) in order to achieve great power status. The two immediate factors behind the 1998 tests were Western (especially American) diplomatic pressure for signing NPT and CTBT, and the rise of the BJP to power. At present, the moderate pro-bomb lobby is pressing for a minimum deterrent, while the extreme wing of the pro-bomb lobby advocates developing a credible deterrent and overt weaponization. Kanti P. Bajpai, in one article, analyzes the Hindu roots behind the BJP’s ideology. The ideological father i gure of the BJP is M. S. Golwalker. His view of inter-state relations is similar to the Hobbesian/Darwinian real-ist interpretation. Golwalker, following Kautilya and the Panchatantra , believed that in this world there are no permanent friends but only per-manent enemies. Alliance with strong powers will result in enslavement. Hence, in order to survive, a nation must be strong and self-reliant. With Pakistan in mind, Golwalker said that it is always the Muslim who strikes i rst and it is the Hindu who bears the brunt. 99 In Stephen P. Cohen’s analysis, the BJP’s bomb programme is a product of domestic politics. Cohen writes: One of the major reasons why the BJP and many secular Indians supported a nuclear weapons programme was to destroy the image of India as a “Gandhian” or non-violent country. More practically, the BJP sought to undo Nehru’s legacy, 98 Stephen P.

By supporting the very weapons that the Congress party of Nehru and Gandhi had for so long opposed, the BJP was attempting to redei ne India’s political identity along new lines. 100 Jaswant Singh critiques the INC’s nuclear policy by saying that for thirty years (1969 to 1999) an overtly moralistic but simultaneously ambiguous nuclear policy and self-restraint have paid no measurable dividends. 101 Similarly, Raja Mohan praises the BJP’s 1998 decision to go for nuclear blasts and simultaneously offers a critique of the INC’s (espe-cially the Nehruvian) nuclear policy: Thanks to India’s nuclear vacillations in the 1960s, India found itself outside the NPT, which by the turn of the millennium had near universal membership barring India, Israel and Pakistan. India’s refusal to sign the treaty had little to do with the in-built discrimination in the NPT, an argument that Indians would go hoarse in presenting the world and themselves.... If India had conducted a nuclear test before the treaty was drafted, it would have automatically become a nuclear weapon power like China. Having failed to test in time, India had no option but to stay out if it wanted to preserve its nuclear option.... With the nuclear tests of May 1998, Delhi ended the self-created confusion about its nuclear status. 102 At present, the anti-nuclear lobby in India, inl uenced by Mahatma Gandhi’s ahimsa philosophy, wants India to sign the CTBT and to stop testing and weaponizing nukes. 103 The Noble prize–winning Indian econ-omist Amartya Sen notes: ‘Nuclear restraint strengthens rather than weak-ens India’s voice.... But making nuclear bombs, not to mention deploying them, and spending scarce resource on missiles and what is euphemisti-cally called “delivery” can hardly be seen as sensible policy.’ 104 Bharat Karnad, a hyper-realist, asserts that ahimsa is not integral to Hinduism. Rather, true Hinduism, he says, like the military ofi cer Nehra, is aggressive and ultra-realist. He believes that nuclear weapons ( brah-mastra in Mahabharata ) are weapons for winning a war and not merely symbolic ‘dangerous toys’ for gaining political prestige and deterring potential enemies. 105 He writes: 100 Cohen, India , p. 195. 101 Singh, A Call to Honour , p. 113. 102 Raja Mohan, Impossible Allies , pp. 219–20. 103 Karnad, Nuclear Weapons and Indian Security , p. xxii. 104 Amartya Sen, ‘India and the Bomb’, in M.

These texts also concep-tualize a Hindu Machtpolitik that is at once intolerant of any opposition, driven to realize the goal of supremacy for the nation and State by means fair and foul, and is breathtaking in its amorality. 106 Post-1998 India’s nuclear policy also receives praise from Raja Mohan: ‘As a nuclear power India becomes stronger economically and acquires greater coni dence in pursuing its manifest destiny on the global stage, the moralpolitik that overwhelmed the public discourse for decades has given some space to realpolitik .... India has begun to rediscover the roots of realist statecraft in its own long history.’ 107 Raja Mohan goes on to say that for all the claims that India has always represented the idealist traditions of foreign policy, its own texts – Mahabharata , Panchatantra and Arthasastra – are steeped in an appreciation of power politics. 108 Jaswant Singh believes that a nuclear-equipped China has surrounded India on all sides. In the north, nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles stationed in Tibet target India. In the west, Pakistan is China’s ally. And in the south, in the Indian Ocean, China maintains submarines equipped with ballistic missiles. And Burma (Myanmar) in India’s east is also an ally of China. 109 In his eyes, China, like a vijigishu of Kautilya’s paradigm, is fol-lowing mandala policy in order to contain India. The effective response for India could be to adopt a counter- mandala policy in order to break out of China’s encirclement. Both Karnad and Raja Mohan, like Jaswant Singh, favor using the realist kutayuddha tradition when conducting nuclear diplomacy. Karnad asserts that India needs a strategic nuclear arsenal in order to deter for-eign countries from intervening in its internal affairs. In his framework, the United States poses a latent threat, and China is the more immediate and principal threat. Karnad wants India to follow the Kautilyan dictum: ‘My enemy’s enemy is my friend’. He notes that just as China has armed Pakistan with conventional and nuclear weapons in order to distract and deter India, India should arm Vietnam with strategic nuclear weapons in order to threaten China’s position in Southeast Asia. An Indian presence in Southeast Asia would also neutralize China’s position in Myanmar.

For Bhisma, there is no condition that permanently deserves the name of either friendship or hostility. Both friends and foes arise from considerations of interest and gain. Friendship can turn into enmity in the course of time, and a foe can become a friend. It is the force of circumstances that creates friends and foes. 111 Neo-realist nuclear theorists like Karnad and Raju G. C. Thomas are wary of any intimate relationship with the United States. Somewhat inl u-enced by Panchatantra , they accept that real friendship can occur only among the equals. However, in the changed circumstances, limited coop-eration with the world’s sole superpower is necessary. 112 To an extent, India seems to be following the policy of cooperating with the United States in order to balance China. For example, despite India’s traditional good relations with Iran, in 2005 India voted with the United States at the IAEA Board of Governors meeting to declare Iran to be noncompli-ant with the Non-Proliferation Treaty. 113 In 1999, nuclear weapons–equipped India and Pakistan came very close to war at Kargil. Mohammed Ayoob claims that Pakistan’s test i ring of an intermediate-range Ghauri missile (range 1,500 km) on 6 April 1998 was the immediate trigger that led to India’s second series of nuclear tests at Pokhran. 114 In 1998, Pakistan got the medium-range No Dong missile from North Korea and renamed it the Ghauri. This missile was named after Muhammad Ghori, the ruler of Ghor in Afghanistan, who repeatedly invaded Rajput-dominated India during the late twelfth century. Pakistan’s other missile, the Abdali, was named after an Afghan ruler who invaded Mughal India in the i rst half of the eighteenth century. The nomenclature of the weaponry accumulating in Pakistan thus keeps 110 Karnad, Nuclear Weapons and Indian Security , pp. xiv–xviii. 111 Raja Mohan, Impossible Allies , p. 283. 112 Raju G. C.

This fact heightens the prestige of Pakistan in the anti-Western Muslim world. 116 The crisis at Kargil erupted when Pakistan send 3–4,000 soldiers of the Northern Light Infantry (henceforth NLI) across the line of control (LOC) to the Kargil-Drass region. The military planners at Islamabad thought that due to Pakistan’s possession of nuclear weapons, India would not dare to launch a massive conventional attack along the LOC, unlike the situation, in 1965. They calculated that after consolidating the Kargil heights, Pakistan would be able to internationalize the Kashmir issue and negotiate with India from a position of strength. 117 Initially, Pakistan maintained the i ction that these intruders were mujahideen s i ghting for the liberation of Kashmir from ‘Hindu’ India’s yoke. The war was fought for two months at altitudes ranging from 12,000 to 17,000 feet. 118 In 1999, unlike in 1965, India did not escalate horizontally by launching attacks elsewhere along the LOC but did initiate vertical escalation at Kargil by using artillery and airpower to evict the ‘intruders’. 119 Most of the NLI personnel were armed with ril es, machine-guns and light mor-tars (81-mm). They were not equipped with heavy weapons suitable for major offensive operations. 120 On 7 June 1999, India’s 56th Brigade, sup-ported by Bofors howitzers counter-attacked the heights of Tololing. 121 By July, due to intervention by the United States and Indian military pres-sure, the intruders retreated from Kargil. As regards the future of India’s nuclear programme, Cohen concludes that India went for the bomb for reasons of ‘national prestige’.

Cohen goes on to say that just as India was never entirely ‘Gandhian,’ it has not entirely rejected the Mahatma. Gandhi argued that Indians have a special obligation to resist evil by nonviolent means; the greatest sin for Gandhi was the use of vio-lence. If the development of an Indian nuclear weapon fails to provide security against putative threats from Pakistan, China, and the United States, then enthusiasm for its development and deployment will wane. The nuclear advocates will have to continually jack up the external threat in order to win support for additions to the nuclear arsenal and argue that there is no other way to resist this ‘international evil.’ Furthermore, if non-nuclear threats continue to increase, whether in the form of interna-tional pressure or terrorism, Indians will have to examine the relevance of nuclear weapons to threats that must be ‘resisted,’ in Gandhian terms. 122 Conclusion Nehru’s grand strategy was an amalgam of realism and idealism couched in the mould of moderate Hinduism. Some Indian military ofi cers are aware of a new necessity to reject or modify certain aspects of moderate Hinduism. Both the insurgents and the state’s elites use religion in order to legitimize their actions and policies. The Indian Army’s COIN doctrine has been shaped to a great extent by the Arthasastra . In Kashmir, the Islamic insurgency continues. The Indian army would do better to cull further lessons from the Arthasastra rather than looking at the newfan-gled Western COIN theories of New War. As regards the nuclear question, those Indian experts who consider themselves realists perceive a great threat to the Bharat Mata . To an extent, the rise of the BJP was a reaction to the emergence of Islamic fundamentalism in Pakistan. The BJP high-lights the threat as well as magnifying it; its stated response is aggressive kutayuddha . To conclude, some American state ofi cials overemphasize the danger of nuclear war between India and Pakistan. Despite being por-trayed by the political managers of India and Pakistan as a Hindu bomb and a Muslim bomb for domestic mass consumption, the small nuclear arsenals of these two countries, as Kargil shows, have brought stability in South Asia by deterring a conventional war. 122 Cohen, India , pp. 196–7. "},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"261 Conclusion There are certain limitations inherent in drawing conclusions from a text-based study, especially when such ‘high texts’ could be categorized as ‘construction’ by the Orientalists. It cannot be denied that in pre-modern India, with its low rate of literacy, iconography was more important than the written word as a means of communicating ideas. For instance, one might argue that analysis of Hindu iconography might be more valuable than examining written texts for the purpose of throwing light on Hindu attitudes towards warfare. The most serious problem in the history of ideas is to prove/show a direct connection between certain concepts expressed in different texts and their execution/implementation in reality by strategic/military managers. However, this book puts to rest the banal assertion of modern schol-ars that India has no pre-modern text except Kautilya Arthasastra . 1 It is difi cult to chisel out direct linkages between classical Indian tradition and modern Indian strategic-military thought for several reasons. Most modern Indian intellectuals and generals have been educated in Western-model schools and universities. So most of them try to mould their thought to conform to the liberal/realist paradigms. They are anxious to avoid highlighting the connection between ancient Hindu theories and modern strategic thinking in order to avoid the stigma of being a com-munal right-wing Hindu. Especially among academicians, the intellec-tual milieu has been shaped by Marxism and then post-modernism. Any 1 See, for instance, the assertion of Kanti Bajpai in ‘Indian Strategic Culture and the Problem of Pakistan’, in Swarna Rajagopalan (ed.), Security and South Asia: Ideas, Institutions and Initiatives (London/New York/New Delhi: Routledge, 2006 ), pp. 54–79. "},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"Hinduism and the Ethics of Warfare in South Asia262scholar trying to trace out the legacies of ancient Hinduism in modern-day statecraft will be marginalized by the mainstream academic commu-nity. Because Muslims constitute about 23 percent of India’s population, and because of the inl uence of ‘liberal’ Hindus (especially in the media) among the electorate, politicians (except those belonging to the BJP) are also wary of carrying the baggage of Hinduism in modern India. Hence, Indian intellectuals, generals and most Indian politicians avoid referring overtly to the Hindu inl uence on their thought and practice. At best, we can speculate about indirect connections between modern India’s strate-gic discourse and ancient Hindu thought. One author rightly states that the meaning of culture is not always coni ned to an autonomous text but is also the product of social interac-tion and institutional processes. 2 Hence, this book has attempted to his-toricize the various Hindu traditions. This book does not discuss in detail the nuances of doctrinal debates relating to morality and karma theory. Nor have I discussed the complex ideas propounded in the Upanishad s. This is in part because the focus of this monograph remains mainstream Hinduism. Moreover, neither the rulers/politicians nor the senapati s/generals cared and care much for the intricacies of religious doctrines. They pick and choose from the shelf the ideas/concepts available to them. But what is available on the shelf is also constrained by the evolution of ‘national’ culture. To give an example from Western history, the German generals during their interrogations after World War II admitted that Clausewitz’s On War is foggy, messy and very complex, suited for reading by professors. Nevertheless, the panzer knights knew the broad outlines of Clausewitz’s ideas. Gandhi and the BJP’s proponent Jaswant Singh, as well as Nehru (in a more sophisticated manner), claimed that India is Hindu and that Hinduism is the king of all religions and can accommodate and absorb all other religions. Whether the Mahabharata war is mythical or not is not the issue. The fact is that several Hindu rulers of medieval India and military ofi cers and civilian analysts of independent India have been inl uenced by the concepts in the epics. Similarly, famous Indian political i gures like Gandhi, Aurobindo, and others have been inl uenced by the vedas and the Bhagavad Gita . Both the moderates/pacii sts (like Gandhi and the present anti-nuclear lobby) and the aggressive/extremists (e.g., Subhas Chandra Bose and hyper-realist nuclear theorists like Karnad) 2 T im Hallett, ‘Symbolic Power and Organizational Culture’, Sociological Theory , vol. 21, no. 2 (2003), p. 141. "},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"Conclusion263package their ideas using interpretations of Hinduism. While the former lobby asserts that real Hinduism is pacii c, the latter claims that the true essence of Hinduism is aggressive and martial. An instrumental interpre-tation would be that the spokesmen of both lobbies use religious imagery and metaphors merely to legitimize their opposing claims in the pub-lic sphere. A more nuanced interpretation would be that religious ideas (Hinduism, in our case) have not only legitimized but also shaped the ideas and worldviews of the country’s strategic managers throughout his-tory. After all, we live in a world that is partially ‘constructed’ through our worldviews, which to an extent are shaped by inherited culture. To assume that the ahimsa tradition is purely idealistic and devoid of realism would be simplistic. Alastair Ian Johnston cautions that many miss the dominant hard realpolitik tendencies in Chinese strategic culture when they emphasize the elements of inherent defensiveness and anti- militarism of the Confucian brand of strategic thought. 3 Asoka and Gandhi gave a twist to statecraft by emphasizing ahimsa as a component of the dharmayuddha tradition. It could be argued that the policy of ahimsa , as followed by Asoka and Gandhi, and which inl uenced Nehru, was a sort of ‘weapon of the weak’. Ahimsa justii es non-action by the weaker party against a strong adversary. In addition, it provides the weak state with the high moral ground. We can conclude by saying that the Hindu ethos not only shapes the mental world of Indian policymakers and military ofi cers but also allows them to legitimize their views and opinions. While the dharmayuddha tradition aids the liberals, the kutayuddha tradition comes in handy for the realists/hard-liners. This ongoing dialectic has shaped India’s strategic and military tradition for the last two millennia. Can we speak of a Hindu strategic and military tradition that has unfolded throughout the last two thousand years? Despite political frag-mentation, can we speak of cultural continuity? After all, both Arjuna and Gandhi speak of tapa s for the greater good. Defensive military doc-trine and the Martial Race theory continue to hold sway even in the new millennium. Despite these and other similarities, one cannot speak of a monolithic and homogeneous Indian Way of Warfare. At best, this mono-graph shows that Hinduism in various guises has structured the thought processes of India’s strategic managers and military ofi cers. This volume argues that warfare and the politics associated with it cannot be explained merely by referring to realist/neo-realist theories. 3 Alastair Iain Johnston, ‘Thinking about Strategic Culture’, International Security , vol. 19, no. 4 ( 1995 ), p. 55. "},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"Hinduism and the Ethics of Warfare in South Asia264However, it would be simplistic to claim that a coherent Indian Way of Warfare has operated over two millennia. Examining the very evolu-tion of the dharmayuddha and kutayuddha concepts, the contradictions present within Hinduism, the development of its traditions and its inter-actions with the changing historical scenario, has been the objective of this volume. Military traditions cannot be explained merely by realism, nor do I want to fall into the trap of claiming, like Hanson, that unique national characteristics of warfare can identii ed in the longue duree . 4 Warfare (its origins, conduct and consequences) is certainly shaped by cultural traits, and culture is also partially shaped by organized violence and the material setting. The paradigm of culture varies from region to region. This book has more or less followed the approach that political scientists would brand the First Generation Strategic Culture approach. Proponents of the First Generation approach focus on three levels of input into a polity’s strategic culture: the macro-environmental level (geography, ethno-cultural characteristics, historical experience, etc.), the societal level (society, economy and political structures) and the micro level (military institutions and civil-military relations). As regards the shortcomings of First Generation theorists, Alastair Ian Johnston writes that they have lit-tle appreciation of the instrumentality of strategic culture, its potential for conscious manipulation in order to justify the competence of decision makers, del ect criticism, suppress dissent and limit access to the decision-making process. By contrast, so-called Third Generation Strategic Culture proponents claim that culture is rooted in recent experience and not in ancient historical practice as posited by First Generation theorists. The Third Generation approach focuses more on the autonomy of the culture and places more emphasis on the role of the domestic political context in shaping the country’s politico-military culture. 5 Third Generation scholars claim that the military culture rather than the broader strategic culture has shaped national ways of war. 6 I refuse to accept the idea that the military culture is completely sepa-rate from the wider culture or that contemporary military traditions are merely the product of domestic politics. At least in the Indian case, mil-itary organizations have been subordinated to the wider cultural ethos, which to an extent is shaped by Hinduism.

"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"Conclusion265organizational culture and the broader culture is shown by Tim Hallett. He writes that organizational culture is a negotiated order that emerges through the formal and informal interactions among organizational actors, an order inl uenced by people with symbolic power, that is, the power to dei ne the situation. Embedded in the context, valued practice become the basis of legitimacy that the negotiators deploy as symbolic power to dei ne the situation and inl uence future practices, interactions and the ongoing negotiated order. People bring their culturally inscribed dispositions and tool kits with them into an organization, linking organi-zational culture to the broader social order. 7 Despite Lawrence Sondhaus’s warning that the true utility of strate-gic culture lies in how it can help us to understand observed behaviour in the present rather than to predict future behaviour, 8 one can ask the question: how will the future unfold? One thing is sure. Because both the dharmayuddha and kutayuddha traditions critique the senapati s tak-ing over the reins of power from the monarch and their Brahmin advi-sors (along with many other factors), the possibility of a military coup is extremely remote in India. The classical Hindu tradition accepts the idea that an inefi cient and incompetent ruler can be replaced by a mantri or amatya , but never by a senapati . So frequent Cabinet reshufl ings and increases in the power of the civilian bureaucracy are established features of modern-day Indian statecraft, but the possibility of brass hats replac-ing the frock coats is remote. 9 If India’s current economic growth rate continues and New Delhi is able to manage internal rebellion, at best an anglicized worldview laced with moderate Hinduism will prevail. Then India may have the luxury to speak about the dharmayuddha tradition, which in turn will generate strategic and military restraint on India’s part. If, on the other hand, India’s economy goes into a downswing and inter-nal rebellion gets out of control, an increasingly insecure India will prob-ably take solace in the exclusive fundamentalist brand of Hinduism, that is, kutayuddha . 7 Hallett, ‘Symbolic Power and Organizational Culture’, pp. 129–31, 136. 8 Sondhaus, Strategic Culture and Ways of War , p. 13. 9 Kaushik Roy, ‘Good Governance versus Bad Governance in South Asia: Civil-Military Relations in India and Pakistan, 1947–2000’, Asian Studies , vol. 18, nos. 1–2 ( 2000 ), pp. 82–99.
