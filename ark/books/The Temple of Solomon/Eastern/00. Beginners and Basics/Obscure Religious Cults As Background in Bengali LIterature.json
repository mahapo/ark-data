A considerable portion of it was printed by the year 1942 and then the work of printing was indefi­nitely postponed for scarcity of paper caused by the Second World Weir. This will explain the long interval between the submission of the book to the press and the actual publication of it.The aim of the present work is an expository study of the obscure religious cults that inspired Bengali literature in the old and the mediaeval times. Religion has always been one of the main motives of literature. It has been so in all countries and particularly in India which is pre-eminently a land of religion. As a matter of fact, the history of the modern Indian literatures is so intimately related with the history of some of the most important religious movements flourishing in this country that an intimate acquaintance with those religious movements seems indispensable for a thorough study of the vernacular literature.But it is no use treading (he beaten track. Some of the religious schools have already been discussed by scholars; some again are very simple so far as their theological stand­point is concerned. The mere introduction of a Pantheon in literature cannot be the subject of serious study unless the Pantheon in question admits of fruitful theological specula­tion. Instead of gleaning in the already harvested field or discussing the obvious, the writer has limited his scope by selecting the more obscure cults, which are noteworthy by"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"nature and have inspired a considerable amount of literature, but the true nature of which has not yet been thoroughly discussed and clearly determined.The Buddhist Sahajiya cult has been the main source of inspiration of Bengali literature in the earliest period. By the discovery and publication of the songs and DohSs of the Buddhist Sahajiyas, MM. H. P. Sastri had, no doubt, done a memorable service not only to Bengali literature but to modern Indo-Aryan vernacular literatures as a whole ; but the task of making a thorough study of the songs and Dohas in the light of the cults inspiring them has been left out by him. Dr. M. Shahidullah’s Les Chants Mystiques de Kanha et de Saraha and Dr. N. C. Chaudhuri’s Da\\arnava dwell more upon the linguistic than the literary and philosophical aspects of the Dohas. Dr. P. C. Bagchi, M.A., Dr. es Lettres (Paris), in his occasional papers and articles, no doubt emphasises the doctrinal aspect of the Sahajiyas; but no comprehensive and critical study of the cult offering a consis­tent and connected interpretation of the songs and Dohas has yet been undertaken.Similar is the case with the Vaisnava Sahajiya movement of Bengal. Mr. M. M. Bose, in his work Post-Caitanya Sahajiya Cult, has, indeed, supplied us with valuable infor­mation regarding the literature of the Vaisnava Sahajiyas and some of the doctrines and practices preached therein ; but the raison d'etre of the whole school and the process of evolution of this love religion from the ideology and methodology of the earlier Tantric and Yogic sects remain unexplained.The songs and Dohas of the Buddhist Sahajiyas have important bearing in spirit as well as in form and language on the songs and Dohas of many of the mediaeval saints, who flourished abundantly in many parts of India, and who, for reasons to be discussed later on, were mostly Sahajiyas in a wider sense. In a chapter on the Baul-songs of Bengal the writer has dealt with the question of the relation between theXJC1V OBSCURE RELIGIOUS CULTS"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"PREFACEXXVearlier and the mediaeval Sahajiyas. He hew also tried to show how on the spirit of a section of the Bauls, who have stressed the conception of the ‘Man ,of the heart,’ Sufi-istic Islam acted conjointly with the Upanisadic spirit ingrained in the different Sahajiya movements as also with the Vaisnavite spirit of love. In an appendix he has dealt at some length with the religious tenets of the non-Bengalee mediaeval saints of India in relation to those of the earlier Sahajiyas.The nature and history of the Nath cult, which has inspired a considerable amount of literature in Bengal as also in many other parts of India, is still shrouded in the mist of myths and legends. The stray articles found on the subject seem to be inadequate. Dr. Mohan Singh’s work, Gorakh- nath and Mediaeval Hindu Mysticism, is hardly a sufficient exposition of the mystic religion of the sect. The recent work of Mr. Briggs, Gorakhnath and the Kanphat Yogis, is a commendable accumulation of facts and traditions. But the distinctive feature of Nathism remains hitherto unexplained. Hence there is ample scope for serious study in the practically unexplored field of Nathism.The Dharma cult of Bengal also invites attention. The cult is not theologically complex,—but it is queerly compo­site. . Different conceptions of godhead have been confusedly amalgamated in the evolution of the Supreme Lord of this Dharma cult. The present writer has in this thesis passed over the simple practices, which are mainly aboriginal, but has centred his attention on analysing its composite nature.The theory of cosmogony and cosmology, which is sub­stantially the same in the description of all the vernaculars notwithstanding small deviations of details, also demands serious attention. The tentative suggestions made by different scholars here and there about the nature and significance of this theory seem to be inadequate. The present writer has given a short exposition of the different versions of the theoryD-M1IB"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"OBSCURE RELIGIOUS CULTSas found in different types of vernacular literature, analysed ideas composing the main theory, and tried to trace their, sources, Vedic, Puranic, Tantric or otherwise.The above, it is hoped, will give the reader an idea about the exact scope of the present work. To put it more briefly, the aim of the present work is a thorough study of the Buddhist Sahajiya cult, the Vaisnava Sahajiya cult, the Baul sect of Bengal and other mediaeval sects of India who may be called Sahajiya in a general sense, the Nath cult, the Dharma cult, and the cosmogonical and cosmo­logical theories to be found in the Bengali literature of different periods. The author has thought it convenient not to distract the interest in the main contention by the occasional intro­duction of a mass of details, texts and stories ; but as these informations cannot be altogether neglected without making the work defective, they have been included in the appendices.Though dealing essentially with some religious systems the motive behind the present study is more literary than religious. If obscure religious fields are entered into, it is done with a view to understanding and explaining the literary productions which have cropped up in them. It is, therefore, evident that whatever has been said, has been said mainly in relation to Bengali literature. But it will be observed that the religious cults that have inspired Bengali literature in the old and mediaeval period, have also inspired cognate literature in other vernaculars of India; the present study, therefore, may throw light not only on the comparatively dark period of Bengali literature, but also on the obscure literary spheres of old and mediaeval vernacular literatures of India as a whole.But in the following pages attempt has been made to make the sudy as thorough as possible also from the religious and cultural points of view. This, it is hoped, may add to the importance of the work in so far as it will bring"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"PREFACExxviito the notice of the reading public the obscure side-issues of Indian theological thought and esoteric religious practices. 'Whether congenial to our modern taste or not, the fact remains that these religious sects enjoyed, and some of them have still been enjoying, widespread popul arity among the masses of India; it is for this reason that a critical study of these minor religious sects cannot be neglected in the history of Indian religious thought. It may easily be seen that the religious sects, with whom the present writer is dealing, represent mainly the religious views and practices of the masses of the country as opposed to the intelligentsia belonging to the higher classes. But to understand fully the civilisation and culture of a country as a whole we cannot do without a proper study of the mass-mind.It may be added in this connection that in conducting the study the writer has tried throughout to be guided by the scientific spirit of a truth-seeker, neither defending the theories and practices of the schools, nor passing any personal judgment on them in respect of their merits. His main aim has been the correct exposition of the schools on textual basis, and the criticisms that are added are applied only to review the position from different angles of vision. The question of abuses and aberrations, which are to be found in a greater or lesser degree in the history of almost all the religious systems of the world, has been deliberately neglected by the author; for it is the rationale of a cult or system and not its abuses and aberrations that have academic value.The materials for the work are gathered from both published and unpublished sources. A good number of manuscripts of texts and commentaries has been utilised in the study of the Buddhist Sahajiya cult; some of these texts are preserved in the University Library of Cambridge, some in the Bibliotheque Nationale of Paris, and some in the Central Library of Baroda,—and all these manuscripts were available to the writer in rotograph through the courtesy pf"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"xxviiiOBSCURE RELIGIOUS CULTSProfessor S.

The language of the Dohas being unanimously •accepted to be Western Apabhramsa, the propriety of the use of ‘j’ to the exclusion of *y’. and the use of ‘s’ to the exclusion of ‘s’ or ‘s’ cannot be questioned. But difficulty arises in the choice between ‘b’ and ‘v’. With the advice of Dr. S. K. Chatterji, M.A., D.Lit., the writer has used V all along in the transcription of the Dohas and ‘b’ initially and *v* medially and finally in the transcription of Bengali songs. Another point to be noticed is that the phonology of modern Bengali, as also of many other modern Indo-Aryan vernaculars, seldom allows the retention of final vowels, and the medial vowel also drops when the word is composed of more than two syllables; but the dropping is never indicated in orthography. The writer has dropped the medial and final vowels in orthography, where they are dropped in actual pronunciation. The principle of transcrip­tion has often been adopted in transcribing the proper names, but rigorous consistency could not be maintained in this matter, as many of the Indian names have already been naturalised in English. Corruptions and mistakes in the spelling of old and middle Bengali texts have never been interfered with. For typographical difficulties nasalisation of vowels had to be indicated by the addition of ‘m’ with the vowels. The writer begs to draw the attention of the reader to another important point. He has found many mistakes and corruptions in the reading of the manuscripts, both Sanskrit and Bengali. These also have not been freely handled unless the mistake or the corruption has been apparent.In fine, the writer acknowledges his debt to Professor Rai K. N.

Up till the advent of the nineteenth ' century with a new outlook on life and literature, none of the Indo-Aryan literatures seem to have had the capacity to stand erect without the prop of some religious view, and this again seems to be particularly the case with Bengali. We have no type of literature in Bengali even corresponding to the Rasau literature (literature based on the annals of heroic episodes) of Hindi, and poets like Cand Bardai or Bhusan and Lai are almost unknown in old and mediaeval Bengali. In our old and mediaeval' literature man’s glory is seldom depicted in its own grandeur and eulogised independently of divine glory. The versions of the Ramayana and the Mahabharata that we have in our literature possess a vein more religious than human; the heroes and heroines of the various Mangala-kavyas are depicted more as toys in the hands of the gods and goddesses than as dignified figures glowing with the heroic grandeur of their personality. Lausen of the Dharma-mangalas is a mere agent of the Dharma-thakura, Kalaketu of the Candi-mangalas is originally a god, being the son of Indra, and is dragged down from heaven on earth only to glorify the almighty power of goddess Candi and to establish her worship on earth.

During the long period, beginning with the Carya-padas of the tenth, eleventh or twelfth century, the only type of literature that may be said to be free from the influence of religion, is the ballad literature of Bengal dealing purely and simply with the diversified life of rural Bengal and pastoral love-episodes.1Apart from the general relation of literature with religion and apart from the fact that Bengal is a province of India, which is specially noted as a land of religion and philosophy, there seems to be some historical reason for such predomi­nance of religion in Bengali literature. It is through the social and political vicissitudes of a nation that there comes deep unrest in the life and mind of man and man comes more face to face with the world of stern realities which help the growth and development of the potential Man. It is through the continual struggle for existence, fight against the adverse circumstances, conflict with the external powers lhat a nation becomes conscious of her real worth and learns to hold in high esteem the glories of terrestrial life. The paucity of such noteworthy social or political events happening in the life of Bengal may account for the fact that the history of Bengali literature during its old and mediaeval period is practically the same as the history of the different religious movements1 It should be noted that the authenticity of many of the East Bengal ballads, as compiled by Dr. D. C. Sen, D. Lilt., in collaboration with Candra Kumar De and some other assistants and published by the University of Calcutta, has been questioned. We have no scope here to enter into the details of the controversy; but our considered opinion oh the point is that though the ballads may not belong to a hoary past (as Dr. Sen holdsl, and though there may be some handling of the verses at the time of collection and compilation, at least the skeleton of some of these verges surely belongs to the seventeenth and the eighteenth centuries and some go even earlier,"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONxxxiiithat flourished in the province for about a decade of centuries.1 Even in the nineteenth century the general practice was to borrow stories either from the RamSyana and the MahabhSrata or from the annals of the Rajputs, Sikhs and Marhatt&s to introduce heroic grandeur in the epics, novels and dramas -There is a striking uniformity in the historical develop­ment of the different literatures of the modern Indo-Aryan vernaculars. The reason behind this fact is that the literary history of almost all the vernaculars is moulded essentially by the religious movements in the different parts of India, which, during the old and the mediaeval periods were strikingly similar. .(jBengali, along with other modern Indo-Aryan languages, grew up with the tenets of some minor religious sects, which rose mostly outside the circle of the .high class people and were characterised by a general tendency of protest against «• current orthodox religious systems. These religious move­ments were sponsored by people who had no aristocracy of descent or advantage of culture and education; they rose from among the most common run of people and preached their doctrines among the masses in their own tongueThe modern Indo-Aryan literatures, as we have indicated in the preface, are, therefore, essentially mass- literature and the religions preached through them represent the mass-religions of India. But this religious zeal of the masses has been responsible for the copious growth of the vernacular literature in spite of the derision and opposition of the higher communities, who sometimes threatened these revolutionaries with curses of hell.1 Of course, in the Caitanya-bhagavata of VrndSvan-das we find reference to the songs of YogT-pal, Bhogl-pal and Mahl-pal (cf. yogtpal bhogtpal mahtpal gita I ihai unite sap lok andndita II Some are of opinion that these songs deal with the life and glory of the Pfila Kings,—but we cannot say anything about them as long as the songs are not discovered.E—141 IB"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"xxxivOBSCURE RELIGIOUS CULTSThe history of Bengali language and literature, so far as it has been explored, begins with the religious doctrines and 'practices of the Sahajiya Buddhists. Sahajiya Buddhism is a particular development of a phase of later Buddhism, widely known as Tantric Buddhism. Investigation reveals that during the reign of the Pala dynasty Buddhism in various Tantric forms gained popularity in Bengal and many Tantric texts and commentaries were written in the different Buddhist monasteries that were established in Bengal. The authors of the Sahajiya Buddhistic songs were mostly inhabitants of Bengal or of the vicinities of Bengal.1But though an offshoot of popular Buddhism, the real origin of the Buddhist Sahajiya cult is not to be sought exclusively or even mainly in any of the theories and practices of Buddhism proper either in its Hlnayana or Mahayana aspect. The real origin of the cult lies more outside Buddhism than inside it. The Buddhist Sahajiya cult, notwithstanding the Buddhistic tone and colour which it assumes, is essentially an esoteric yogic cult. /Side by side with the commonly known theological speculations and Religious practices there has been flowing in India an | important religious undercurrent of esoteric yogic practices from a pretty old time; these esoteric practices, when asso­ciated with the theological speculations of the Saivas and the Saktas, have given rise to Saiva and Sakta Tantricism; when associated with the Buddhistic speculations, have given rise to the composite religious system of Buddhist Tantricism; and again, when associated with the speculations of Bengal Vaisnavism the same esoteric practices have been responsible for the growth of the esoteric Vaisnavite cult, known as the the Vaisnava Sahajiya movement.It will not be out of place to give here just an idea of the speculations and practices, round which grew all the esoteric1 Vide infra, Ch, I,"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONXXXVschools either within Hinduism or Buddhism. All kinds of esoteric Sadhana (i.e., religious endeavours) of India have a common background. In all the esoteric schools the absolute reality is conceived of possessing in its nature the potency of two aspects or attributes. These two aspects or attributes are, again, conceived as the negative and the positive, the static and the dynamic, rest (nitirtti) and activity (pravrtti),—the principle of pure consciousness and the principle of activity;—one represents subjectivity and the other objectivity; and, again, the one is conceived as the enjoyer and the other as the enjoyed. In the absolute Being these two aspects lie unified together in a state ofabsolute non-duality; but in the process of becoming orphenomenalisation there comes separation and duality. This process of change or becoming through a state ofduality is bondage and suffering,—and the final escape from it is liberation. The secret of all esoteric Sadhana is to destroy all principles of dualism and to attain the final state of non-duality. This ultimate state of non-duality isvariously called in the different esoteric systems as the state of Advaya, Maithuna, Yttganaddha, Yamala, Sama-rasa, Yugala, or the Sahajasamadhi or Sunya-samadhi, or simply the final state of Samadhi.In Hindu Tantricism these two aspects of the absolute reality have been conceived as the Siva and the Sakti, or the primordial male and the female. Again, one of the funda­mental tenets of all the esoteric schools is to hold that the human body is the epitome of the universe, all ‘truth’ (tattva) is contained within the body. Consistent with this view it has been held that Siva resides in the Sahasrara (the lotus of thousand petals situated in the cerebrum region) as the principle of pure consciousness and Sakti as the principle of world-force resides in the other pole of the Muladhara-cakra in the form of the coiled serpent. Now, the Sadhana consists in raising the coiled force from the one pole"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"XXXVIOBSCURE RELIGIOUS CULTSto the other and to unite her there with Siva,—and this union of the Siva and the Sakti produces the state of the absolute. Thus the principles of Siva-Sakti or the male and the female are contained within the person of every man and woman.Again it has been held that the principles of the male and the female are contained within the body of a man in the right and the left respectively,—the right half being the masculine part and the left half the feminine part. This will explain the conception of Mahadeva or Siva as Ardha- nariivara or the half-female and half-male deity, and in the sculptural or pictorial representation of the Ardha- narisvara the deity is always depicted as having the left half as the female and the right half as the male.1 Thus, there are principles of masculinity and femineity contained in every man and woman,—a man is a man because of the predominance in him of the principle of masculinity, whereas a woman is a woman because of the predominance of the principle of femininity in her. Now as the left and the right represent two aspects of the absolute reality, the two important nerves in the left and the right, viz., Ida and Pingala, and the two courses of the vital wind, Prana and Apana, associated with the two nerves, are also associated with these two aspects of the ultimate reality. From this theory follows the Sadhana of controlling the courses of the vital wind in the two nerves and of making them flow together through the middle nerve Susumna. Thus the union of the right and the left through the union of the two courses of the vital wind within the middle nerve Susumna,1 It rftay be pointed out that in the Sahajiya school of Valtsnavism also Rsdh£ And Krsna are said to reside in the left and the right respectively; Rsdha is often said to reside in the left eye and Krsna in the right.

The male and the female represent in the visible world the division which is present in the nature of the absolute as Siva and Sakti, and the perfect union of the Siva and the Sakti is the highest reality. Within the physical body of man and woman reside the ontological principles of Siva and Sakti1; therefore to realise the absolute truth, or in other words, to obtain the highest spiritual experience, man and woman must first of all realise themselves as manifestation of Siva and Sakti and unite together physically, mentally and spiritually, and the supreme bliss that proceeds from such union is the highest religious gain. Such a view is the raison d'etre of all the esoteric Sadhana which are carried on by the male and the female together.As a school of esoteric yoga the Buddhist Sahajiya school is fundamentally based on the speculations explained above. The Absolute is the Sahaja—it is the ultimate reality behind the self and the not-self. The realisation of this Sahaja in and through the self and the not-self is the ultimate aim of the Sahajiyas. Now, in Sahajiya Buddhism Sunyata (voidness) and Karuna (compassion), transformed as the Prajna and the Upaya, are held to be the two primary attributes of the ultimate reality which is Sahaja. As two aspects of the ultimate reality Prajna and Upaya are conceived in the Buddhist Tantras and in Sahajiya Buddhism just as Sakti and Siva of the Hindu Tantric school. Prajna and Upaya thus represent the principles of dualism and the unification of the two in a supreme non-dual state is the1 Vide infra, Ch, V,"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"xxxviiiOBSCURE RELIGIOUS CULTSfinal aim of the Buddhist Sahajiyas. The practical yogic method for the realisation of the Sahaja is, therefore, fundamentally based on the principle of the union of Prajna and Upaya. The union of Prajna means, in the first place, the union of the female and the male, who are considered to be the manifestations of Prajna and Upaya respectively. Again, we have seen that the two important nerves in the left and the right also represent the principle of Prajna and Upaya in the microcosm of the human body; therefore the union of Prajna implies the perfect control over these two nerves and the vital process associated with them and to make them function unitedly through the middle nerve which represents the principle of non-duality. The yogic practice involving this physical and physiological union of the Prajfia and the Upaya will lead the yogin to the inner union of the Prajna and the Upaya. Upaya as the Lord (called Vajra-sattva, or the principle of immutable adamantine existence) resides in the highest pole of the cerebrum region and Prajna as the world-force1 resides in the lowest pole (which is the plexus in the navel according to the esoteric Buddhists); the inner union consists in the raising of the Goddess from the navel region and in making her unite with the Lord of the cerebrum region.In the Vaisnava Sahajiya school the two aspects of Sahaja or the absolute reality are explained as the eternal enjoyer and the enjoyed, as Krsna and Radha; and it is further held that all men and women are physical manifesta­tions of the ontological principles of Krsna and Radha. When men and women can, therefore, realise themselves as the manifestations of Krsna and Radha through a process1 We may notice here a great anomaly. In Tantric Buddhism the Lord as (Jpfiya always represents the principle of phenomenalism and the consort Prajfifi is generally depicted as the principle of rest or void ; but in the conception of the world-force, we shall see later on, the order was reversed and Prajfia or NairStma herself, as associated with th£ principle of defilement, was conceived as the £akti or the world-force."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONxxxixof attribution (A ropa% the love of any human couple becomes transformed into the divine love that is', eternally flowing on between Krsna and Radha; when the union of a human couple thus becomes the union of Krsna and Radha, the highest spiritual realisation dawns in the state of union or Yugala. The element of love is the innovation of the Vaisnava Sahajiya school; but this element of love is essentially based on the element of yoga in the form of physical and psychological discipline.In the Nath cult, which seems to be synchronous with the Buddhist Sahajiya movement (though the origin of the cult may be much earlier), the two aspects of the absolute reality are represented by the Sun and the Moon, where the Sun represents the principle of destruction (\\alagni) through the process of change and decay,—and the Moon represents the principle of immutability. The final aim of the Nath Siddhas is the attainment of a non-dual state through the attainment of immortality in a perfect or divine body. This non-dual state of immortality can be attained only through the union or rather the commingling of the Sun and the Moon. In its speculations on the attainment of an immutable and divine body through psycho-chemical process of Hatha-yoga involving the theory of the Sun and the Moon, the Nath cult seems to be akin to the Rasayana school of Indian thought, the main difference being that the medical and chemical science of the Rasayana school became transformed into a psycho-chemical yogic science with the Nath Siddhas.It may, however, be noted in this connection that though the culture of the body {kay a-sadhana) through processes of Hatha-yoga for the attainment of physical perfection, was of paramount importance in the Nath cult, it was more or less common to all the $gpteric schools including the school of Vaisnava Sahajiyaf|j|hich laid emphasis on love. The realisation of Sahaja’either of the nature of ‘supreme bliss’"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"xlOBSCURE RELIGIOUS CULTS(Maha-su\\ha) as is conceived by the Buddhist Sahajiyas, or of the nature of * supreme love ’ (as is conceived by the Vaisnava Sahajiyas), presupposes the strength of the physical organism to stand such a supreme realisation. It is for this reason that we shall find that all the esoteric schools spoke of the culture of body through some Hatha-yogic practice.Thus it is clear from the above that all the esoteric schools of India are fundamentally based on the specula­tion on the two aspects in which the ultimate reality functions and manifests itself,—and that the religious creed is based on the final aim of the attainment of a state of non-duality. It is to be noticed that this idea of unity of the esoteric systems implies no process of negation; it, on the other hand, implies a process of supreme position through a regressive process of transformation and transubstantiation. It is for this reason that all the schools of Tantra speak of the final state as a state where enjoyment and liberation have become one and the same. The process of Aropa which makes the ultimate union possible is not peculiar to the Vaisnava Sahajiyas only,—it is a process common to all the Tantric and Sahajiya schools, either Hindu or Buddhist. We shall see later on that this process of Aropa implies no negation; it implies a change of perspective where the physical existence is not denied, but replaced by a permanent spiritual existence, where the gulf between the physical and the ontological is bridged over in an absolute existence. The Tantric Buddhists have also repeatedly emphasised that the final state is not a state of Nirvana as it is not also a state of BhaVa (existence); but neither the Bhava nor the Nirvana is denied of it,—it is a state where BhaVa and Nirvana become united together in the realisation of the absolute.Closely associated with the religious literature of the different Sahajiya movements of Bengal is the literature of the Bauls. The B5uls as a relegious sect are characterised"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONby their peculiarly unconventional manners and customs in social as well as religious life. From this point of view the followers of the Vaisnava Sahajiya school and religious people much akin to such an order bear the general name of Baul. But the Baul songs, which are composed by illiterate masses from both the Hindu and the Muslim communities, and which are familiar 10 us with the theory of the ‘ Man of the heart ’ and man’s love towards him, have a distinctive feature of their own. This ‘Man of the heart ’ is the Divine in man and stands as the eternal Beloved in relation to the human personality, who is the crazy lover. Such songs of the Bauls and similar songs of the mediaeval saints of Northern, Central and Upper India, represent the spirit of Sufi-ism against the background of Indian thoughts.The Dharma cult of Bengal and of some parts of Orissa is, as we have said in the preface, a local cult having no element of esoterism in it; as a religion it consists of extremely popular rites and ceremonies. The literature belonging to the cult embodies the infiltration and transforma­tion of various religious ideas in the untrained mind of the masses. The \"cosmogonical and cosmological theories also represent popular jumbling of various older ideas received hrough various sources.As all the above-mentioned obscure religious cults will come directly within the purview of our present study, we need not enter into any further details here. It will not be out of place, we think, to add here a brief outline of the other religious movements which have been strong factors in the evolution of Bengali literature as a whole and which will not directly come within the province of our present study because of the reasons adduced in the preface.The devotional movement in Bengal, as is the case in other provinces also, has given great impetus to our literature, and the beautiful literary fragments, which are F-1411B"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"OBSCURE RELIGIOUS CULTSextant* can be found abundantly in the love-lyrics of the Vaisnava poets. Candl-das, Govinda-das, Jnana-das, among the host of Vaisnava poets, undoubtedly deserve world-wide recognition as first-rate poets. Though we have a fair amount of Ramayanic literature in Bengali and though a deep religious vein runs through many of them, the Rama cult could not gain sufficient ground as a religious faith in Bengal, it being pushed to the corner by the Krsna culL The Vaisnava movement of Bengal, in the line of the Krsna cult, grew along with the traditions of the Puranas like the Bhagavata-purana, Visnu-purana, Brahma-t)aivarta-purana, etc., and there was perhaps, through the life of Caitanya and some renowned Gosvamls, some influence also of the devotional movement of the South. 1 The first literary record of Bengal Vaisnavism is to be found in the famous lyrical poem the Gita-govinda of Jaya-deva. After him Candi-das and Vidyapati (who, though a Maithili poet, was more popular in Bengal than in his native province) sang the immortal songs of the eternal love of Radha-Krsna, and were precursors, as some scholars are disposed to think, of Srl- ' Caitanya, who flourished about a century later and brought with him a devotional movement, which for a long time overflooded Bengal and some of the neighbouring Provinces. Vaisnavite apostles like Madhavendra-purl, Advaitacarya, Srlvasa and others, of course, flourished just before the . advent of Caitanya,—but the advent of Caitanya was some­thing like a fruition of all their devotional penances, and it was an event which was really epoch-making in the religion and literature of Bengal. Caitanya, as he is interpreted by his followers, embodies in him the quintessence of both Radha and Krsna, is the realiser and the realised in the same personality.1 See an article, Bhakit-dharmer Vivartan, by the present writer in the Bharata-varfa, Caitra, B S., 1343. See also an article, Prem-dharma, by K. N, Mitra, U day an, B.S., 1341, Agrahlya$J,"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONThrough his life and teachings Caitanya preached a doctrine of divine love, which was philosophically systematiaed and theologically codified by the six Gosvamls of Vrndivana, Viz., Rupa, Sanatana, Raghunath Das, Raghu­nath Bhatta, Gopala Bhatta and Jiva Gosvami. The philosophical and theological system known as Gaudiya Vaisnavism (i.e., the Vaisnavism of Bengal) is really the contribution of these six Gosvamls, who were all religious apostles inspired by the iife and teachings of Caitanya. Pre-Caitanya Vaisnavism of Bengal generally flourished with the legends of Krsna and his dalliances with the cowherd girls of Vrndavana and particularly with Radha ; but in Post- Caitanya Vaisnavism the divinity of Caitanya as the synthesis of the two aspects of the same reality as the lover and the beloved was recognised and emphasised, and as a result thereof Post-Caitanya Vaisnava literature laid the same stress, if not more, on the life and teachings of Caitanya as on the legends of Radha and Krsna.The other two important cults that have influenced Bengali literature almost from the beginning are the Saiva and the Sakta cults. So far as the religious history of Bengal is concerned, of the two, Saivism seems to be the older and the Sakta cults, which are more often indigenous than Puranic, sprang up later in strong opposition to the former. In our literary records we find the Sakta cults often at daggers drawn with the cults that \"centred round the male deities. In this conflict with the other systems, particularly with the Sakta systems, Saivism, the religion centring round the most indifferent and inactive god, had to give way and the Sakta cults gradually gained ground. This conflict seems to have resolved itself in another way in a synthetic transformation in the Radha-Krsna cult of Bengal.If we take a bird’s eye view of the religious history of Bengal as a whole it will appear that among the Hindu deities Siva enjoyed wide popularity in the early and"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"xlivOBSCURE RELIGIOUS CULTSmediaeval period. In the preliminary chapter of some of the Dharma-mangalas, which belong to the seventeenth and ''the eighteenth century, we find salutation to all the male and female deities of Bengal and also an enumeration of the localities where they were popular. 1 A general consideration of these lists of the gods and goddesses of Bengal will reveal the extent of the popularity that Lord Siva enjoyed in Bengal even up to the eighteenth century. It is also to be noticed that though in the Dharma-mangala literature we find Dharma-thakura identified more with Krsna and Rama, yet in religious practice the Dharmacult has got itself amalgamated more with Saivism. It will also appear from a perusal of the different kinds of Bengali Mangala-kavyas (which are practically propaganda literature belonging to the different religious schools) that the different Sakta cults of Bengal presuppose a Saivite background,against which they thrived, though their origin might have been earlier.Siva of Bengal, at least as found depicted in Bengaliliterature, is not exactly the same Siva with whom we areacquainted in the Brahminical literature, particularly in the Puranas. The indigenous elements of Bengalee life and culture have supplied flesh and blood to his Brahminic skeleton and made him a Bengalee through and through.

In almost all the literatures belonging to this religious school, huftian interest of the family-life of Siva far outweighs the interest of his divine nature, and in this indigenous character of Siva the Puranic elements have been set here and there with the avowed purpose of giving it a Puranic colouring. The literature of the Saivite cult consists chiefly of the SiVayanas, which deal with the peculiar life and activities of lord Siva, particularly in relation to his family. Like the Saivite devotional lyrics of the South or even like the few songs on Hara-Gaurl (i.e., Siva and his wife) composed by Vidya- pati of Mithila, we have no Saivite devotional lyric in' Bengali. A large portion of fragmentary literature concern­ing Siva is, however, to be culled from the Mangala-kavyas belonging to the Dharma cult and particularly to the Candi and the Manasa cults.The Sakta cults of Bengal represent a particularly distinctive feature of the religious life of Bengal and the extent of literature which flourished under the direct influence of those cults is also fairly large. We do not know of any such Sakta influence in the religion and literature of any other province of India excepting Malabar. The Sakta literature of Bengal generally belongs to the type of Mangala literature, which, as we have said, is the literature of religious propa- ' ganda. Among the Sakta cults, the more important are the cults of Candi (or Kali or Kalika), the consort of Lord Siva, and the cult of Manasa, the serpent goddess. We have also Mangala-kavyas belonging to the cult of goddess Sitala (the goddess of the direful disease of pox), Kamala or LaksmI (the goddess of wealth), Sasthi (the goddess believed to be in charge of the welfare of children) and others, but the literature belonging to such cults is compara­tively negligible both in quality and in quantity.The Mangala literature of Bengal is a continuation in vernacular of the religious literature in Sanskrit, generally"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"OBSCURE RfeLlGlOUS CULTSknown as the Puranic literature. The Sanskrit Pflranas are sometimes infused with a spirit of propaganda on behalf of spme half-indigenous and half-traditional religious cult and there is the spirit of glorifying some of the gods and goddesses with the help of a huge network of stories which bear testimony to their irresistible divine power and thus make them acceptable to the Brahminical people. The same spirit is found in the Mangala-kavyas of Bengal, which launched vigorous and continual propaganda on behalf of some god or goddess in question with reference to various episodes where he or she had the supreme power to save the devotee from all sorts of dangers and difficulties and to bring destruction to all who opposed his or her supremacy. These gods and goddesses of the Mangala-kavyas, in spite of their Puranic garb, are often indigenous in nature. Naturally, therefore, when the worship of these gods and goddesses began to be introduced in the society at large their divinity was questioned and the move for the introduction of their worship was strongly resisted by different sections of people. The followers of these gods and goddesses had, therefore, to justify, in keen competition with their rivals, the divinity of the deity in question and the legitimacy of his or her claim for worship on earth; and this will explain the origin of our 'Mangala literature. But it is to be observed that, after once this literary form could gain sufficient currency and popula­rity, it became ere long more or less a literary convention. It cannot be said with a sufficient degree of certainty that Mukunda-ram, the greatest among the poets of the Candl- mangalas, was a devotee of Candi or that Bharata-candra, practically the last and most secular of the poets of the Mangala literature, was a sincere devotee of Annada religious garb was rather a device in mediaeval literature to make literature acceptable to the masses, who were prompted to listen to these literary works more with a religious fervour than with a literary taste."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONxlviiMangala literature may be said to have its origin in the fourteenth century, but it developed in the sixteenth and the seventeenth century, after which the old literary convention fell into disuse and literature began to flourish with a new spirit and form. Up till the last quarter of the eighteenth century, Sakta literature consisted exclusively of the different Mangala-kavyas; but by the last quarter of the eighteenth century a new type of Sakta literature flourished in the form of fine devotional lyrics mainly on Syama or Kali (popularly known as Syamasahgit or songs on Syama, the universal Mother of dark-blue colour) and sometimes also on Uma, or Gaurl, the daughter of the mountain Himalaya, and the young wife of the old, wild and indifferent husband Siva. Ramprasad Sen of the eighteenth century, the greatest devotee of the Mother, a devotee of the most unassuming and non-sectarian type, may be taken to be the represen­tative poet of this school. About a century later Ram- krsna Parama-hamsa of Daksinesvara, through his most devoted life and his sweet and simple teachings, gave a new impetus to this cult, and the literature of the Ram-krsna cult should never go unnoticed in the history of our literature. Sri Aurabindo of Pondicherry is at present giving a new orientation to the Mother cult and is also inspiring occasional lyrics on the line.In surveying the general trends of the religious history of Bengal in particular relation to the history of Bengali literature, we cannot neglect the influence which the great religion of Islam exerted on the religion and literature of Bengal. The Mahomedans first came to the land as a conquering nation; but after they had settled here and became natives of the land and succeeded in making a large number of converts, their religious thoughts and ideas began to influence those of their neighbours ; and at the same time the thoughts and ideas of their neighbours also began to affect and modify theirs in their"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"OBSCURE RELIGIOUS CULTSturn. Some sort of a compromise between the religious ideas and practices of popular Islam and popular Hinduism continued in the rank and file of the two communities through a slow and gradual process of cultural reciproca­tion. Islam of Bengal is rather Sufl-istic Islam and the influence of this Sufi-ism on the Indian religious movements is best exhibited in the songs of the Bauls. Besides these, the divinities like Satya-plr, Manik-pir, Gaji and others of popular Islam represent the continuity of the process of a happy admixture of elements both from Islam and Hinduism. About the influence of Islam on the Dharma cult we shall have detailed discussion in our study of the Dharma cult.The popular religious ceremonies of women-folk, particularly of the maidens, have also supplied us with nice pieces of folk literature. The ceremonies, of which there are a good number of varieties, are generally known as the Vratas (vows) and are accompanied by the recitation of rhymed or unrhymed rhythmic verses (generally known as the Vrata-katha) which contain fine touches of rural poetry. In the performance of these ceremonies there is always an element of art,—either the art of poetry or the art of painting. These Vratas are still adding a subconscious aesthetic pleasure to the conscious religious sentiment of the women-folk of Bengal.The nineteenth century dawned with a new ideal of life, religion and literature. The spirit, form and technique of the old and mediaeval literature, flourishing up to the end of the eighteenth century, grew hopelessly monotonous and roused a subconscious feeling of dissatisfaction in the mind of the people and also an inward demand for a change ; and a change was inevitable in the course of nature. The most important factor, that intensified this demand for a change and accelerated its speed, was the influence of Western thoughts and ideals on our political, cultural and religious life.

This began to bring about a slow and gradual change in our general outlook. This was m'ucK more accelerated by the consolida­tion of British' power in Bengal, and the political conquest soon brought with’ it a cultural conquest. Through the propaganda of the European clergies, whose principal business was tg point out the illogicality, absurdity and immorality of the mythological Hindu faith, and through the easy accessibility of the theological and philosophical works embodying the spirit of the Western religion and culture, there actually dawned a great change in the mental horizon of the Bengalees. Western education and culture roused a spirit of revolution in the mind of youths and the revolution found expression first through the life and activities of Raja Ram Mohan Roy, who by the first quarter of the nineteenth century had, at the very prime of his youth’, the courage of standing against the prevalent religious beliefs of the Hindus, which he called superstitious and mythological. His call for revolution was responded to instantaneously by a section of the educated Bengalees and he did succeed in establishing a new religious school which' was fundamentally based on , Upanisadic monism, supplemented by cognate thoughts of Islam and Christianity. This newly reformed religion soon developed into the religious school known as Brahmoism, which broke asunder the barriers of the caste-system and the orthodox canons of the Hindu Smrtis (canonical texts) and stood'agaiifst all formalities in life and religion. Through the life and activities of Maharsi Devendranath Tagore, Brahmananda Kelav Chandra Sen, Vijay-krsna GosvamI and a host of other staunch followers of this new faith this religion soon gained a strong footing among an educated and cultured section of the Bengalees and it cannot be gainsaid that this new faith' of rationalism has been exerting G—HUB"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"a reformative influence on orthodox Hinduism for more than a century, and that it exerted an appreciable influence also on the literature of the nineteenth century.Among the important literary figures of the last half of the nineteenth' century Bankim Chandra Chatterjee had a religious conception of his own, and the importance of this conception in the history of our literature lies in the fact that many of his novels and essays distinctly presuppose this religious background. Bankim Chandra was essentially a Hindu,—-but he was a staunch rationalist at the same time,' and this rationalism of Bankim was to a great extent roused in him through' his intimate contact with the thoughts and ideas of the European scientists and philosophers of the eighteenth and the nineteenth century. Though Bankim Chandra had a fair acquaintance with the leading philosophical views of Europe, the two systems that exerted the greatest influence on the formation of his new religious faith are the Positivism of Comte and the Utilitarianism of Mill. Bankim Chandra’s religion is fundamentally based on Positivism and Utilitarianism; but he thought that Hinduism, as represented by the most popular scripture, the Git& (the Divine Song), ascribed to the authorship of Lord Sri-Krsna, can very well be reconciled with the principles of Positivism and Utilitarianism. He, therefore, interpreted the ideals of the Gita in the light of Positivism and Utilitarianism and tried to construct a new system of thought by a mixture of the ideas from the East and the West. How far Bankim Chandra succeeded in amalgamating the religious views of the East and the West and how far his new system was placed on a sound basis is a matter of controversy; but what concerns us here is that not only his essays but many of his novels also were infused with this new ideal of religion,—characterised by a distinct humanitarian tone, much too in keeping with the general tone o! the time.1 OBSCURE RELIGIOUS CULTS"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONliIt Kas sometimes teen said tKat the religious attitude and the aesthetic attitude coincide together in their ultimate nature. There is no antagonism or even a relation of contrariety between truth* and beauty; on the other hand truth, beauty and goodness are sometimes viewed as the three attributes of the ultimate reality. This relation of truth with beauty, or of religion with’ art, has best been illustrated in the art-creation of Rabindranath Tagore. There are many songs among the poetical works of Tagore, which keep us in a fix as to whether we should eulogise them as master­pieces of art or as the best expressions of religious ex­periences. Tagore made no distinction between his aesthetic vision and his spiritual realisation, and he has repeatedly declared that as essentially a poet he could never make any distinction between the poet in him and the spiritual aspirer. As a matter of fact, rarely have we seen another poet sink so deep in the unfathomable mysteries of nature, life and mind and come out with the priceless gems of his intuitional realisation, and at the same time give them the best autistic expression.Tagore sings of an infinite supreme Being underlying the whole cosmic process of finite creation. The world- process is an eternal process of self-realisation through self-manifestation of that supreme Being. The Infinite is becoming self-conscious through the eternal art-creation of all finitude,—and the truth of the Finite lies in the ideal of unity which it finds in the deeper relatedness with the Infinite. The Finite and the Infinite have embraced each other in the personality of man and the religion of man, which consists of his realisation of the ultimate truth in him, lies in the perfect evolution of his personality or the exten­sion of it into infinity through the increase of knowledge, love and disinterested activities.

In speaking of a vision of his childhood Tagore says in his work, Religion of Man, “ The rhythmic picture of the tremulous leaves beaten by the rain opened before my mind the world which does not merely carry information, but a harmony with my being. The unmeaning fragments lost their individual isolation and my mind revelled in the unity of a vision. In a similar manner, on that morning in the village the facts of my life suddenly appeared to me in a luminous unity of truth. All things that had seemed like vagrant waves were revealed to my mind in relation to a boundless sea. I felt sure that some Being who comprehended me and my world was seeking his best expression in all my experiences, uniting them to an ever-widening individuality which is a spiritual work of art.” When this ever-widening individuality or personality approximates infinity, we realise the divinity in man and that is the ideal realisation of truth.This conception of religion propagated by Tagore, both through speculative essays and through his art-creations, much akin though it may be to the Hegelian and the neo-Hegelian thoughts in striking points, is, however, fundamentally based on the teachings of the Upanisads, which were ingrained in the heart of poet Tagore from the early days of his childhood. On the Upanisadic canvas the Vaisnava love-poets and the mystic Bauls of Bengal and other mystic poets of upper and northern India, viz Kabit, Dadu, Raj jab and others, have supplied lines and colours of different shades.

Another big temple of Tara was built in Somapura to ‘ dispel entirely the eight great dreads of the people.’ This monastery of Somapura and also the Vikramasila monastery were probably brought to perfection by Devapala, son of Dharmapala. The Bstan-hgyur refers to another Vihara of Vikramapuri, which was most probably situated in Vikramapura of East Bengal. Kumara Candra, called Acarya Avadhuta, wrote a Tantric commentary in this monastery of Vikramapuri.

The Pag- Som-Jon-Zang mentions the Pandita Vihara of Chittagong, which was a great centre of Tantric learning and culture, and with this Vihara Tilipa as Tilopa or Tailapada is said to have been associated. I ailapada had a disciple of the name of Nada-pada, who again is said to have been the preceptor of the renowned Bengali Buddhist missionary who went to Tibet and preached Buddhism there for full fourteen years. Nadapa was the author of the commentary on the Vajrapada-sara-samgraha, which is said to have been com­posed by Sakyabhiksu Yasobhadra of Kasmira at the demand of Vinaya-sri~mitra and others belonging to the grand Vihara of Kanakastupa in the city of Pattikeraka.

Bibhuticandra and Danasila were the two most reputed scholars of Jagaddala. Besides, Moksakaragupta of the same Vihara was a good logician and composed in three chapters the Tarka-bhasa. Subhakaragupta, who lived there for some time, wrote a commentary on the Tantric text Siddhaikavira-tantra. Dharmakara of the same monastery translated the Samvara- vyakhya of Krsna. Buddhists from Tibet flocked here to have Sanskrit texts translated into Tibetan.1In the brief survey made above it must have been noticed that a good number of Fantric scholars of Buddhism flourished during the period of the Palas, and many of the authors of the Dohas and Caryas probably flourished during this time. The art and iconography of the same period will bear testimony to the fact that by this time Mahayana began to be eclipsed by Vajrayana Buddhism. The icons of various Buddhist gods and goddesses of the period and also the representation of some of the gods (including the Lord Supreme as Hevajra or Heruka or Vajresvara or Vajra-sattva, as he was variously called in esoteric Buddhism) with their respective female consorts in a state of union (yuganaddha) will indicate the introduction of the Sakti element in the Buddhist religion of the time.With this brief survey of the history of Buddhism in Bengal before and at the time of the advent of the Buddhist Siddhacaryas of the Sahajiya sect, let us now turn our attention directly to the religious background of the Bengali Carya-padas, which embody the religious doctrines and practices of the Sahajiya Buddhists.

Mahayana or the ‘ Great Vehicle/ as contrasted with the ethico-religious rigorism of Hinayana, or the * Little Vehicle,’ was a religion of progress and liberalism. In the Mahayana-sutra-lankara of AsarigaHmayana has been characterised as a veryiraladwhhaHmVana' narrow system of religion—narrow inits aim of self-liberation, narrow teach­ings to realise that aim, narrow method applied for this realisation, insufficiency of equipment and the shortness of time within which final liberation is guaranteed.1 On the other hand, the Mahayana school represents the religion of the dissenters and the protestants and was always characterised by a broadness of outlook and deep sympathy for the suffering beings of the whole universe.Tradition says that after the death of Buddha there arose a great controversy among his followers as to the correct interpretation of the sayings of the master as well as about the rules of discipline indispensable for a monk. To settle these controversies great councils were held. It is said that' in the second council held in Vesali the controversy finally ended in a split among the Buddhists, and the dissentersMahay ana-sutra Ln\\ara, Ch.

This controversy between the elders and the radicalists finally resulted in the growth of the two separate schools within the province of Buddhism itself, the canonical tenets of the elders being styled as Hinayana and the tenets of the radicalists as Mahayana.'Among the radical changes in thought and outlook that we find in Mahayana, as contrasted with Hinayana, the ,, , r A i , most important is the change in the concep-Ideal of Arhathood ^replaced by that of tion of the final goal.

The conception of Bodhisattvahood, very important as it is in Mahayana Buddhism as well as in all forms of Tantric Buddhism, requires some elaboration. The belief of the followers of Mahayana is that every man, nay, every being of the world, is a potential Buddha; he has within him all the potency of becoming the perfectly enlightened one ( Sam yak-sam buddha), which latent possi­bility can be made patent only through the attainment of perfect knowledge, associated with universal compassion, which prompts one to utilise that knowledge in m issio n a ry activities for the uplift of all beings.

Bodhisattva- Karu,?5 hood means the attainment of theBodhi-mind (Bodhicitta), which is defined as -a unified state of vacuity (sunyata) and universal compassion (karuna),1 The other noteworthy departure in Mahayana was the development of the docetic conception of the three Kayas (bodies) of the Buddha. The Hinayanists conceived the Buddha only as a Historical personage in the life and activities of Sakyamuni; but with the Mahayanists the Buddha is no particular historical personage, he isbut the ultimate principle as the totalitythree^sywTor bodies! of things and beings in an unquali­fied state of all-existence. This ultimate principle has three aspects, known as the three Kayas of the Buddha, viz., the Dharma-kaya (i.e., primordial element, or the ‘ thatness ’ underlying all that exists), the Sambhoga- kaya (the body of bliss, or the effulgent body in the form of the Bodhisattvas) and the Nirmana-kaya (i.e., the body of transformation, or the historical personage of Buddha).2 With these fundamental changes in outlook and a predominance Predominance of of philosophical thought and the cultureand° culture oTThe °f the supreme virtues (paramita) Mahayana Psramitss Buddhism flowed on side by side withHinayana for centuries.

It should be observed that the pledge of Mahayana was the redemption of suffering humanity as a whole, nay, the liberation of all beings. With this end in view the apostles of Mahayana had to make their religion catholic enough to make it acceptable even to the most ordinary people of the society. In other words, Mahayana, as a religion for all people, had to make provision within its fold for people of widely different tastes and intellectual calibre. It is for this reason that hetero­geneous elements of faith and religious practices began first to creep in and then to rush into the province of Buddhism.\\For ordinary people religion consists in theDegeneration by100 much popuiarisa- belief in innumerable gods and goddesses,in time-honoured customs, muttering of mystic formulas, and in the paraphernalia of rites, ceremonies and practices; when through the zeal of liberat­ing all the beings from the bondage of existence Mahayana began to be too much popularised, all these popular religious elements of heterogeneous nature began to be incorporated into Buddhism. Though the general custom is to style this composite religious system of heterogeneous faiths and practices as Tantric Buddhism, the raison d'etre of Tantric Buddhism is not to be sought in this popular phase of the religion. It seems that with the purpose of attaining the final state of Buddhahood a new school deve­loped within the province of Buddhism itself with a more forward ^policy?

In the Laghu-\\ala~cakra'tanira- raja-tikja, entitled Vimala-prabha “ we find that the doctrines of the Paramita-naya are written wholely in Sanskrit, while those ot the Mantra-naya are explained in Sanskrit, Prakrit, Apabhramsa and even in non-Sanskritic languages like those of the Savaras and others.Tradition holds Asanga, the great exponent of the Tradition about Yogacara school, to be responsible for the introduction of Tantricism in Buddhism; dImm he again, in his turn, is believed to havebeen initiated into this mystic cult by Maitreya in the Tusita-heaven. Others, on the other hand, hold that Napfariuna. the ^ renowned exponent of the Madhyamika school, was the real founder of the esoteric school, and that he, in his turn, received the doctrines from the Celestial Buddha Vairocana through the divine Bodhisattva Vajra-sattva in the “ iron tower ” in South India.Apart from these traditions, some scholars are disposed to think that in the Mahayana-sutra4ah\\ara of Asanga there are clear references to the sexo-yogic practice of the Tantric Buddhists. In the Sutra-lah^ara the word “ paravrtti ” occurs several times in connection with acts which constitute the supreme greatness of the Buddha.

India in Buddha’s time was so steeped in superstitions that any religion which dared forbid all kinds of magic, sorcery and necromancy could hardly hope to withstand popular opposition. A cleve1 organiser as Buddha was, he did not fail to notice the importance of incorporating magical practices in his religion to make it popular from all points of view and attract more adherents thereby.” 1 As a conclusive evidence of this inference Dr. Bhattacarya refers to Buddha's belief in the four “ iddhis ” (;rddhi) or miraculous power obtained by the advanced disciples and also to a verse in the Tativa-samgraha of Santaraksita and its commentary by Kamalaslla, where Buddha himself is said to have prescribed Mantra, Mudra,\\ Mandala, etc., for his lay disciples. But this view of Dr. Bhattacarya cannot be credited historically because of the fact that he has not demonstrated his view with sufficient evidence. The mere belief in the “ rddhi\" is no convincing proof of Buddha s sanction of Tantricism, and the evidence of Santaraksita and Kamalasila (which too is extremely insufficient by itself) cannot be credited much on the ground that they flourished about fourteen hundred years after the advent of Buddha. Of course, we find occasional references to Tantric practices including the sex-element even in the time of Buddha,2 but we find no conclusive evidence in any early record of Buddha’s sanction to Tantricism as the mere policy of a clever organiser.

We have pointed out in the Intro­duction the truth, which we shall have many other occasions to repeat, that Tantricism with its heterogeneous nature is neither exclusively Hindu, nor exclusively Buddhist in origin. It is an ancient religious cult of India manifesting itself some­times as Hindu being associated with Hindu theology, thoughts and ideas and somstimes as Buddhist in association with later Buddhist theology, thoughts and ideas. In view of this fact it will not be sound to say, as has actually been said by some scholars, that the Hindu Tantras are later in origin and are derived from the Buddhist Tantras. We have seen that Asanga has traditionally been held to be the introducer of Tantricism in Buddhism ; but the tradition of the existence of a vast array of Agamas during the days of Asanga or even in earlier times cannot altogether be neglected. These ancient Agamic texts seem to be the source of all Tantric texts. That an extensive Tantric literature existed in the days of Somananda and Utpala is well-known. Internal evidences show that most of these works, even as they were then known, were very old. Abhinava Gupta’s (10 A.C.) compilation of Tantra-loka is based on many ancient Agamas, which were accessible to him personally. A study of these will show that between the so-called Buddhist Tantras and Hindu Tantras there are numerous points of contact implying thereby that they had a c o m m o n cultural background in the past."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"GROW IH OF THE SAHAJIYA CULT AND LITERATURE 21It will be very interesting to note that, apart from the theological speculations, which differ in details from one another in different religious spheres, the fundamentals of the Hindu Tantras and the Buddhist Tantras are the same. It is only the colour and tone that are sometimes different. As we shall have more occasions to refer to these points of similarity later on we do not propose to illustrate them here.The Mantra-element seems to have been introduced in , Mahayana Buddhism first in the form of theI fie ivlantia element JDharani, which literally means that by which something is sustained or kept up (dharyale anaya iti), i.e., the mystic syllables that have got the capacity of keeping up the religious life of a man. In the Bodhisattva-bhumi of Vasubandhu we find a discourse on the nature of the Dharanis and a philosophical explanation for the adoption of these unmeaning Mantras for the realisation of the ultimate truth.According to the Bodhisattva-bhumi the Dharanis of the Bodhisattva are of four kinds, viz., Dharma-dharanf, Artha- dharani, Mantra-dharani and the Dharani for the attainment of the transcendental merit of forbearance of the Bodhisattva (Bodhisattva-\\santi-labhdya ca dharani). The Dharma-dharani is composed of that kind of Mantras through the hearing of which (even though they are not explained in any Sastra or by any preacher) the follower attains memory (smrti), perfect knowledge (prajna) and spiritual strength (bala). Artha- dharani is that type of Mantras through the mystic power of which the correct significance (artha) of the Dharmas (which significance is never explained in any Sastra or by any preacher) is revealed to the follower in an intuitive way. The Mantra-dharani enables a man to attain .perfection. The Dharani for the attainment of forbearance (Isanti) is the Mantra through which the ultimate nature of the Dharmas is revealed to the reciter and through this realisation of the ultimate immutable nature of the Dharmas the follower"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"22OBSCURE RELIGIOUS CULTSattains generosity of heart which produces in him the merit of forbearance.1In this connection, however, Vasubandhu gives a philo­sophical explanation of how the ultimate immutable nature of the Dharmas can be realised through the Mantras of unmeaning syllables, such as “ iti miti kiti bhiksornti padani svaha.\" He says that these syllables, viz., “ iti miti fyti, etc.,” have got no meaning whatsoever,—and the follower through concentration should realise the truth that these Mantras can have no meaning at all,—-this unmeaningness is their real meaning. Through this absolute negation of all possible meanings to the Mantra, the real meaning of the Mantra as pure void is intuitively revealed to a man. Thus this realisation of the meaning of the Mantras (as pure negation) helps the man to realise in pure intuition the nature of the Dharmas as essenceless. But through this negation of all meanings to the Mantras a unique transcen­dental, immutable meaning is revealed to the heart of the Sadhaka; this immutable nature is the real nature of all things.2 Closely associated with this Mantra-element is the Mudra-element, which in Buddhism in general is but the different signs made by the particular position of the, .. , , hands and the fingers.This Mudra-ele-Mudra, Mandala.ment, however, with the Mantra-elementand some other esoteric practices has a deeper significance1 Bodhisattva-bhumi.

With Manlra and Mudra the element of Mandala or describing of mystic circles was also introduced.But once the portals of Buddhism were flung open to let in elements of esoterism, all the traditional beliefs in gods, demi-gods, demons and ghosts, magic, charms and sorcery with all their details rushed in and quickly changed the whole ethico-religious outlook of Buddhism. With these ^ again were joined the elements of Yoga,—Hatha-yoga, Laya-yoga, Mantra-yoga and Raja-yoga. All these elements made for the growth of the elaborate system of Tantric Buddhism.It is to be noticed that in the earlier phase of Tantric Buddhism emphasis was laid generally on the elements of Mantra, Mudra, Mandala, Abhiseka (initiation and the ceremonies associated with it), etc.; but gradually the sexo^yogic practice also began to be referred to. In course of evolution, however, the sexo-yogic practice began to be held as the most important esoteric practice for the attainment of the final state of supreme bliss, all the other practices andbe selected in the secret practice; in Hatha-yoga it refers to practices including control of limbs, muscles, nerves and the vital breath-process. We have again different descriptions of four types of Mudras associated with both processes of Yoga and meditation which are again associated with four types of realisation of bliss (vide Catur-mudra of the Advaya-vajrasamgraha, G. O. S., XL). In the University Library of Cambridge there is a manuscript with the colophon \" Srl-mac-chakyaraja- sarva-durgati-pari&odhana-mukha-khyana-prathama-diyoga-nama samadhi ” (MS.

The general custom, however, is to divide Vajra-yana into four classes, Viz., Kriya-tantra, Carya-tantra, Yoga-tantra, and Anuttara-tantra. The first two classes are called ‘ lower Tantras ’ inasmuch as they are concerned with the rites, ceremonies, worship of gods and goddesses and other practices; and the latter schools are known as ‘ higher Tantras * inasmuch as they describe yogic processes for the realisation of the ultimate truth and also contain discussions on the nature of the ultimate reality.There is still another customary way of dividing Tantric Buddhism into three schools, viz., Vajra-yana, Kala-cakra-1 We do not, however, find any direct mention of the “ Pahca~ma-k.aras ” in the Buddhist Tantras; but we find spoiadic mention of wine, fish, meaf, etc., and much of Mudra and sexual intercourse.

About its nature Waddell says in his Lamaism,—V In the tenth century A.D., the Tantric phase developed in Northern India, Kasmir and Nepal into monstrous and polydemonist doctrine, the Kala-cakra, with its demonical Buddhas, which in­corporated the Manlrayana practices, and called itself the Vajrayana, or the ‘ Thunderbolt-vehicle,’ and its followers were named Vajra-carya, or, ‘ followers of the Thunder­bolt. ’ 1 In another place he says—“ The extreme develop­ment of the Tantric phase was reached with the Kala-cakra, which, although unworthy of being considered as a philosophy, must be referred to here as a doctrinal basis. It is merely a course of Tantric development of the Adi-Buddha theory combined with puerile mysticism of Mantrayana, and it attempts to explain creation and the secret powers of nature by the union of the Kali, not only with the Dhyani Buddhas, but even withAdi-Buddha himself.” The account and interpretation given by Mr. Waddell seem to us to be based on confused ideas about Tibetan Buddhism.

Sastri, however, says on this point,—“ What is Kala-cakra-yana? The word Kala means time,—death and destruction. Kala-cakra is the wheel of destruction, and Kala-cakra-yana means the vehicle for protection against the wheel of destruction.” 1 But this explanation of MM. Sastri is not confirmed by any textual evidence.The traditional view concerning the origin of Srhkala- cakra-mula-tantra, which is recorded ih the Abhinisramana Sutra 2 is that it was delivered by the Buddha at Sri Dhanya Kataka. Regarding this system Csoma de Koros says that it was introduced in India from Sambhala at about 965 A.C.We have at our disposal a text of the $rj-\\ala-ca\\ra- tantra ? a study of which does not substantiate the statement that Kala-cakra-yana is that school of Tantric Buddhism, which introduced demonic Buddhas in it,—at least, it is not the main characteristic by which the school should be recognised. In the text at our disposal the Lord has explained how the universe with all its objects and localities are situated in the body and how time in all its divisions and sub-divisions (viz., day, night, fortnight, month, year, etc.) is within the body in the processes of the vital wind (prana-Vayu).

The sixth chapter of the Tantra-lo\\a (which is a fairly big chapter) is devoted to the exposition of the doctrine of Kala (time) and the process of keeping oneself above the influence of the whirl of time. Time (Kala) in all its phases (day and night, fortnight, month, year, etc.) has been explained here mainly with reference to the functions of the vital wind (mainly Prana and Apana) spread through the whole nervous system, and the process of controlling time is to control the vital wind in the nerves through yogic practices.(iv) M ode oj Transformation oj the Main Ideas oj M ahayana to those oj Tantric BuddhismBefore we pass on to the fundamental characteristics of Sahaja-yana, on which the Carya-padas are based, we deem it necessary here to make a very short survey of the mode of transformation of some of the philosophical ideas of Maha- yana Buddhism into those of Tantric Buddhism. Tantricism is neither Buddhist nor Hindu in origin : it seems to be a religious under-current, originally independent of any abstruse metaphysical speculation, flowing on from an obscure point of time in the religious history of India. With these practices and yogic processes, which characterise Tantri­cism as a whole, different philosophical, or rather theological, systems got closely associated in different times, and the association of the practices with the fundamental ideas of Mahayana Buddhism will explain the origin and development of Tantric Buddhism. Being associated with the Tantric system the fundamental ideas of Buddhism underwent a"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"28OBSCURE RELIGIOUS CULTSgreat change; or it may also be that the transformation of the fundamental ideas by lay people, who were indis­criminately admitted into the school of Mahayana, facilitated the association of Buddhism with Tantricism. There seems to have been a mutual interaction between the cause and the effect in either case.In this mode of transformation the most important point is Transformation of the transformation of the idea of Sunyata!!uoih“ of°VaKaiya,S (vacuity) into the idea of Vajra, or thethunderbolt. The Sunyata-nature of theworld is its ultimate immutable nature,—as immutable as the thunderbolt, and so it is called the Vajra. It has been said in the Advaya-vajra-samgraha,—“ Sonyata, which is firm, substantial, indivisible, impenetrable, incapable of being burnt and imperishable, is called the Vajra.” J This trans­formation of Sunyata to Vajra will explain the title Vajra- yana and in Vajra-yana all the gods, goddesses, articles for worship, yogic practices and elaborate rituals have been marked with Vajra to specialise them from their originally accepted nature. The supreme deity of Vajra-yana is the Vajra-sattva (vajra = iunyatd = vacuity ; sattva — quintessence), who is of the nature of pure consciousness (vijnapti-matrala ... of the Vijnana-vadin Buddhists) as associa-Vajra-sattva.ted with Sunyata in the form of theabsence of subjectivity and objectivity.2 All the other gods of Vajra-yana are generally marked by a miniature figure of the Vajra-sattva in the crest.

It is the Self in man,—it is the ultimate substance behind the world of phenomena. It is often spoken of as the ultimate reality in the form of the Bodhi-citta. The Mahayanic idea of Bodhi-citta also underwent a change beyond recognition in esoteric Buddhism. Originally it was conceived as the D . mental state in which there is nothing butBodhi-citta. ^ °a strong resolution for the attainment of perfect wisdom (bodhi) combined with a strong emotion of universal compassion. Thus Bodhi-citta presupposes two elements in the Citta, viz., Sunyata (i.e., the knowledge of the nature of things as pure void) and Karuna (universal compassion). This Bodhi-citta, with the elements of Sunyata and Karuna in it, marches, after it is produced,upwards through ten stages and in the final stage ofDharmamegha it attains perfection. In the practice ofVajra-yana particularly in Sahaja-yana (where Sunyala and Karuna, the two elements to be united together for the production of the Bodhi-citta, were identified with the female and the male or Prajna and Upaya)Bodhi-citta is conceived as the extremely blissful state of mind {produced through the sexo-yogic practice.

In Mahayana texts we find as^Prajfig and Upsy** that Sunyata is Prajfia, r.e., perfect know­ledge of the void-nature of the self and the Dharmas. Karuna or universal compassion is called the Upaya, i.e., the means or the expedience for the attainment of the Bodhi-citta. These two terms, Prajna and Upaya, are found already used by the Tathatavadin Asvaghosa as well as by Nagarjuna, the exponent of the Madhyamika school.1 Upaya is generally explained in the Mahayanic texts like the Saddharma-puniarika 1 and the Bodhisattva-bhumi ! as missionary works which are prompted by universal compassion for the suffering beings. This Prajna as perfect wisdom was conceived as absolutely passive, the negative aspect of the reality and the primordial source of all entities ; whereas Upaya, because of its dynamic nature, began to be conceived as the positive and the active aspect of the reality. Upaya brings into existence in the phenomenal world all the entities, the possibility of which lie in the Prajna or the void. Unlike the Samkhya system and the popular Vedantic: thoughts, the negative or passive or the unqualified aspect of the reality as perfect knowledge was conceived as the female in the Buddhist school,—and the positive or active principle was conceived as the male. When thus the idea of the male and the female could once creep into Buddhism the whole outlook began to change, and the production of Bodhi-citta through the unification of void- knowledge and universal compassion was transformed into the production of great bliss through the yogic union of the female and the male.1 See Agvaghosa’s Maha-yana-Sraddho tpada-sulra translated as the Awakcti ing oj Faith in Mahayana by Suzuki, pp 66, 99.

In the Sadhana-mala it has been said that the one body of the ultimate nature which is the unity of both Sunyata and Karuna is called the neuter (napumsaka) or as Yuganaddha.1This principle of Yuganaddha is the same as the principle of non-duality {advaya). The principle of conjugal union (maithuna or kama-kala as it is called in the Kama-kala- vrfasa) of the Saiva and Sakta Tantras originally refers to the same principle.2 There also the designations of the male and the female or of the seed and the ovum were used originally to explain the two aspects of the absolute reality, static and dynamic, negative and positive; and their union refers to the unity in the ultimate truth. But though this analogy of the male and the female or of the seed and the ovum has often been declared to be merely a mode of expression,} yet in practice it has, more often than not, been taken as real in both the Hindu and the Buddhist Tantras, and many things, that are grossly real, followed as aberrations.

In the HeVajra- tantra it has been said that in the Sahaja or the ultimate state there is the cognition of neither Prajna nor ofUpaya,—there is no sense of duality or difference anywhere ; in such a state everything,—whether the lowest, or the middle or the best—should be realised as the same.'The self should be realised as neither something static, nor something dynamic; through the transcendental medita­tion on the underlying oneness of the cosmic principleeverything should be viewed as of the same character and function.2 All the entities come out of transcendental knowledge of the form of Sama-rasa,—they are all equal and non-dual in nature.\"' f When through the yogic process one enters into the state of supreme bliss (Maha-sulpha), the whole world becomes of the form of unique emotion in the nature of Maha-sukha, and through this unique emotion of bliss the whole world as static and dynamic becomes one.4 This Sama-rasa has been extensively used in many of the Buddhist as well as Hindu Tantric texts to signify the union of Prajna and Upaya, or of the Sakti and the Siva, or rather to signify the intense bliss that is derived from the sexo-yogic practice, which, in its highest intensity, has got the capacity of producing an absolute homogeneity in the psychi­cal states and processes.1 hlna-madhyo-tkfftany cva anyani yani tani ca Isarvc tani samanl'ti drastavyam tattva-bhavatah IIHevajra-tantra, MS., p. 22 tB).2 sthira-calam yani tanVti sarve tanVti naiva ham I samani tulya-cesfani sama-rasais tattva-bhavanaih IIIbid., MS., P. 22/B)-23(A).See also Ibid., p. 23 (B), 24(A), 27(A).

Etymolo- gically the word Nirvana may mean either the' final stoppage to a flow,—i.e., complete cessation of the cycle of birth and death;—or it may mean ‘ blow­ing out ’ as in the case of a lamp ;—or the eternal tranquil­lity resulting from the cessation of all the Vasana (root- instincts) and Samskaras (deep impressions). In either case, from the idea of complete cessation and perfect tranquil­lity developed the idea of perfect peace in Nirvana. There is, of course, a lot of controversy over the question whether Nirvana is any positive state at all; without entering into the philosophical subtleties involved in the question, we may say that in popular belief as re­presented through the popular Pali literature Nirvana was conceived as something positive.1 Though in Pali literature Nirvana is often described as something unspeak­able, yet in course of poetic description we find it described as supreme (param), tranquil (santa), pure (visuddha). excellent (partita), calm (santi), immutable (a^hara), eternal (dhruva), true (sacca), infinite (ananta), unborn (ajata), uncreated (asam- khata, a^ata), all alone (^eoa/a), and all good (siva).

As Mahayana Buddhism often speaks of Nirvana as the ultimate reality—as the Dharma-kaya, which is neither existence nor extinction,—so also the Maha sukha is variously described in the Buddhist Tantras as the ultimate reality transcending, or rather absorbing within it, both existence (bhava) and extinction (nirvana). It is des­cribed as something which has neither beginning ndf middle nor end; it is neither existence nor annihilation, neither the self nor the not-self.1 The Maha-sukha is the Lord Vajra- -sattva of the nature of the unity of Prajna and Upaya; it is the non-dual quintessence of all the entities.2 It is the Bodhi-citta or perfect enlightenment combined with com­passion.3 In the Hevajra-tantra it has been said that Sukha or bliss is the ultimate reality, it is the Dharma-kaya, it is the Lord Buddha Himself. Sukha is black, it is yellow, it is red, it is white, it is green, it is blue, it is the whole universe; it is Prajna, it is Upaya, it itself is the union; it is existence, it is non-existence, it is the Lord Vajra-satlva.4When Nirvana was thus identified with a state of supreme bliss, the attainment of an absolute state of supreme bliss was accepted to be the summum bonum of life by all the Tantric Buddhists.0 For the realisation of such a state of supreme bliss they adopted a course of sexo-yogic practice. This conception of Maha-sukha is the central point round which all the esoteric practices of the Tantric Buddhists grew and developed.1 ai na ania na majhu na nau bhava nau nibbana I chu so paramo maha-sukha nau para nau appana IIQuoted in the Hevajra-tantra, MS., p. 61(A).2 Maha-sukha-prakasa of the Advaya-vajra-samgraha (G. 0.

By pure knowledge the mind must first be tranquillised and when it becomes perfectly controlled all the forces of the illusory world are subdued.2 In that ultimate stage external objects of smell, touch, etc., remain as they were, but the perceptual knowledge of the whole world appears to be just like the perception of objects in a waking dream, i.e., the whole universal process seems to be a great dream, though we remain with our outward eyes open.'1 In one song of Bhusuka-pada-, the mind (citta) has been compared to a fickle rat and it is said to be closely associated with the vital wind. It is said,—“ Dark is the night and the play of the rat begins.” 1 The dark night is the darkness of ignorance in which the function of construc­tive imagination goes on. It is further said,—“ Kill, O Yogin, this rat of the vital wind, whereby you will escape coming and going. The rat causes existence and makes holes; this fickle rat remains inactive only when skilful devices are employed. This rat is Time or death itself (i.e., the fickle mind constructs all temporal existence),—but in it there is no colour. When it rises to the void it moves there and drinks nectar. The rat remains restless (as long as it is not pacified by the instructions of the preceptor); pacify it through the instructions of the wise preceptor.

The song goes thus :—“ Near whom and with whom are you living and in what way !—a clamour is rising around from all the four quarters. The deer has become the enemy of all because of his own flesh. I see, the hunters do not leave Bhusuka (who is like unto the fickle deer) even for a moment. The deer does not touch the grass nor does it drink water ; the abode of the doe is not known to the deer. The doe says to the deer, hearest me, thou deer, leave this forest and become mad. While running in haste the hoofs of the deer are not seen,—Bhusuka says,—it does not enter into the heart of the ignorant.”1Here the deer represents the mind ; due to the principles of defilement it is always surrounded by the hunters who are the miseries of life. As the deer is the enemy of all because of its own flesh, so also the citta itself is the cause of all its miseries; for, it itself constructs the world of miseries through its own activities. But when the deer citta is tronbled thus amidst the miseries of life, then comes the doe,2 or the goddess Nairatma (essencelessness or perfect vacuity) to his help and she takes him away from this world beset on all sides with the hunters.It has been said in another song,—“ Going on cons­tructing for himself (the notions of) existence and extinc­tion, for nothing does man bring him under bondage.

It should be noted in this connection that the story of the deer and the doe is very popular in old and mediaeval folk-songs of the vernacular literatures. The saying that the deer is enemy to the world because of his own flesh is to be frequently met with in old and mediaeval vernacular literatures. The Siddhacfirya has here made use of the popular imagery to explain the religious theory.2 The word ' harinl * has been explained in the commentary in this way, —visapana-bhava-grahan harati khandayati I harinVti sandha-bhasaya saiva jnana-mudra nairatma !Ibid., p. 13, Com., (Ssstri’s edition)."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Death is exactly the same as birth,—there is no distinc­tion between being and dying.

Between the first and the second part of the rite is performed the preparation of the holy water. One of the priest’s assistants raises a mirror so that it reflects one of the statues of the divinities ; another takes the vessel (feuje, Mongolian) filled with water and pours it upon the mirror. The water which flows off and is believed to have caught the image of the divinity is collected in a special dish (k’ris-gc‘os—Tibetan) held by a third acolyte, while a fourth wipes the mirror with a silken napkin (Qadaq Mong.). Fifteen libations are made in this way and at the end of the ceremony the lustial water is poured off into a bum-pa and set on the sacrificial altar.

It is called the Upaya and is of the nature of constructive imagination (parikalpila). It is also called the right (da^rina), the solar circle (suiya- mandala) and the thunderbolt (vajra). Forty mental functions of defilement, such as passion, contentment, joy, pleasure, wonder, patience, valour, pride, energy, greed, etc., are associated with this state.

An exposition of the theory of seven Sunyas is found in the old Tantric text Svacchanda, a theory which found its echo in many of the subsequent texts of the Saiva and Sakta literature. The Svacchanda contends that there are seven kinds of Sunya, of which the first six are impure and contain the seeds of phenomenalism,2 whereas the seventh is the Supreme Reality itself, which is Pure Being and Con­sciousness and is free from all the Vifyalpas. The doctrine of sixteen or eighteen Sunyas as ennumerated by Asanga or Dinnaga (in the Madhyanta-bibhaga or the Asta-sahasrika- pindartha) and also by the Natha writers is also of a similar character.The theory of the four Sunyas was accepted both in the Dohas and the Carya-padas.

Truth is something which can never be found through mere austere practices of discipline ; neither can it be realised through much reading, philosophising, fasting, bathing, constructing images and painting the gods and goddesses; it is only to be intuited within in the most unconventional way through initiation in the Taliva and the practice of yoga. This process of yoga is themost natural process for a m an; for in the nature of manhunger and sex are recognised by all to be the most primitive and fundamental propensities ; and all religions would pres­cribe strict rules for their suppression; but that is a way, say these Yogins, which is absolutely unnatural. The continual suppression of natural propensities only makes a man morbid and neurotic, but never helps him in realising the truth. The Sahajiyas would never prescribe any unnatural strain on human nature, but would take human nature itself as the best help for realising the truth. It is for this reason that this path has always been described as the easiest andmost natural.

The question of annihilation is regarded by the Sahajiyas as unnatural and impossible, and therefore, the wisest way is the way of transformation and sublimation.1Thus the name Sahaja-yana is doubly significant; it is Sahaja-yana because its aim is to realise nahjral^ath1 he m°Sl the ultimate innate nature (Sahaja) of theself as well as of the Dharmas, and it is Sahaja-yana also because of the fact that instead of suppress­ing and thereby inflicting undue strain on the human nature it makes man realise the truth in the most natural way, i.e., by following the path along which the human nature itself leads him. In the Samputika it has been said that this supreme process of yoga is eternal,—it originates from our sex-passions; our sex-passions are part and parcel of our nature and our nature is never transgressible,—it is, therefore, wise to transform these sex-passions in the yogic process for realising the truth.2 What is natural is the easiest; and thusSahaja, from its primary meaningA n d at the sa m e tim e r 1 • .1 ♦ .1 * 1the easiest p a th . ° * being natural, acquires this secondarymeaning of being easy, straight or plain.

Others again rush into the Mahayana fold,—but none of them get at the ultimate truth. The Lord (Buddha) has prescribed ways according to the capacities of his disciples, but can one attain liberation only by meditation? * What will one do with lamps, offerings, Mantras and services,—what is the good of going to holy places or to the hermitage?—can liberation be attained only by bathing in holy waters?

In its practical aspect the religion of the Samhitas and the Brahmanas was pre-eminently sacrificial with innumerable accessories of chants, ceremonies and rituals. Though the sacrifices were generally made to some particular god or gods they were nothing of the kind of an attempt at establishing any sort of personal contact between the god or gods in question and the sacrificer. The desired effect of the sacrifice does not depend on the will of the god to whom the sacrifice is offered,—it depends absolutely on the rigorous correctitude of the sacrificial method in all the minutest details. But when we pass on from the Samhitas and the Brahmanas to the Aranyakas and the . Upanisads we find a remarkable changeThe spirit cf the t >A ran yak as a n d the in the fundamental religious spirit. Inthe hymns and ritualistic and sacrificial net-work of the Samhitas we do not find any unified idea of the Brahman or the Supreme Being, though, however, we often find a tendency towards monotheism.

It has been said that those who know the self or the Brahman and seekfor truth reach the region of the BiahmanKarma kanda made i l lsubservient to Brahma- whererrom they never turn back; butknowledge or self- . . . , k ^ i ,knowledge. those who acquire better legions throughsacrifice or gift or penances roam aboutfrom this region to that and constantly suffer under thewhirl of coming and going.3 It is neither by the making of sacrifices, nor by hearing and memorisingthe Vedas that one can realise the Brahman or the supreme truth, it is only through the absolute purification of heart,— through the removal of the veil of ignorance that one canrealise the self or the ultimate truth.

There it is said that dawn is the head of the horse, the sun is his eye,wind his breath, heaven the back and the intermediate space between heaven and earth the belly; the quarters are the sides, the seasons the limbs, the stars the bones and the sky his flesh. To mediate 0 11 such a horse and to realise the truth cf this horse is the real meaning of the Horse-sacrifice.2 Ibid., \\2.4).3 Bfhad-aranyaka,"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"RELIGIOUS OUTLOOK OF THE SAHAJIYAS73In the post-Upanisadic period a free spirit of religion,Po8t-Upanisadic spirit leaning mainly to the subjective side,lw w X C8Mafibh«’ characterises the early epic literature ofrata* India, particularly the Mahabharata.

In the Anusasanika-parvaof the M a h a b h a ra tawhere Bhisma is explaining toYudhisthira the really sacred places of pilgrimage, wefind that the mind with the transparent water of purityand truth, when associated with the lake of patience,is the best of all places of pilgrimage.

The Sankarite and the post-Sankarite Vedantic schools cherished nothing but uncompro­mising antagonism towards the school of Purva-mlmamsa, the staunchest advocate of the sacrificial religion of the Vedas. Even Ramanuja, the great exponent of Vaisnavism, tried to make a compromise between dharma-jijnasa and brahma-jijnasa and held that the former leads to the latter; but Sankara stoutly denied this relation of succession between the two; for, he held that the nature and the ulti­mate end of the two are diametrically opposite to each other. While the aim of dharma-jijnasa is the attainment of10-141 IBi Ch. 108."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"74OBSCURE RELIGIOUS CULTSprosperity (abhyudaya) in life and the attainment of heaven after death, the aim of brahma-jijnasa is liberation (mujj/i) ; ind while the function of the former is to induce one to perform various sacrificial and ritualistic duties, the function of the latter is only to induce one to know the Brahman, and to know the Brahman is to be the Brahman. A hankering after the knowledge of the Brahman presupposes no performance of scriptural duties,— it follows rather from a discriminative knowledge of what is permanent and what is transitory (nitya-nitya-vastu-viveka), from absolute indifference to the pleasures of life here and hereafter, the capacity for internal and external control and a true desire for being liberated from the fetters of life.As the Mlmamsakas go to the one extreme of saying that religion always involves some kind of activity,—the Vedantins go to the other extreme of saying that true religion involves no kind of activity whatsoever. The aim of all activities is to produce some sort of effect,—but Brahma- knowledge cannot be the effect of any activity ; it is already there, and it is there for all time; it is, however, veiled by our ignorance—by the world-illusion;—the function of the true knowledge of the scriptures is to remove this veil of ignorance from our mind,—and when this veil of the world-illusion is removed Brahma-knowledge will dawn upon us instantaneously and spontaneously. Brahma- knowledge is not something attainable through human effort,—it is rather self-revealed. Brahma-knowledge is not even a mental function,—for, a mental function pre­supposes the fact that the agent has (he power to do or undo it according to his own will,—but we have no such power in the case of Brahma-knowledge. Moreover, as we have noticed before, to know -the Brahman is nothing but to be the Brahman, and knowing and being being identical here, no action is implied even in the knowing."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"RELIGIOUS OUTLOOK OF THE SAHAJIYAS7 5The Vaisnavas, however, represent the spirit of hetero­doxy in another way. While the whole i.mhe *pmt pf emphasis of the Vedantins is on pureknowledge, the emphasis of the Vaisnavas is on devotion or love. The Vaisnavas always speak very indifferently of heaven and the enjoyment of happiness there,—they discourage even the idea of liberation,— what they want is the blissful realisation of the eternal love of God. It is necessary to remark here that this cult of devotion or love was not and is not limited strictly to the sphere of Vaisnavism,—we have already referred to the Saivite devotional cult of South India, and even in the Sakta cult of later days (we may mention here the exquisite songs of Rama-prasada Sen and others of his time) we find traces of pure devotion and love. But in Northern India and in Eastern India this devotional cult flourished mostly along the line of Vaisnavism and they are commonly taken to be identical.The innovation made by the Vaisnavas (and all devo- _ \" , tional cults in general) is the introduction ofQ u e stio n o f d ivin emercy—a break in the the element of divine mercy within the law of Karma. . .... r 1 i rdeterministic view or the law ot Karma. Germs of the law of Karma can be traced to the ritualistic and sacrificial religious thought of the Vedas, and it is a particularly noticeable fact that practically all the systems of Indian thought accept this theory in some foim or other. We have seen that the Samhitas and the Brahmans leave no scope for the interference of the gods in the matter of the fruition of the rites, rituals and sacrifices. But already in the Upanisadic period we come across a statement like this,— “ This self or soul (atma) can never be realised through great sayings,—neither by memorising\" (the scriptures) nor by listening to the scriptures; it is only by him, to whom it reveals itself of its own accord, that it can be realised, and to him this soul or self reveals its real"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"76OBSCURE RELlClOUS CULTSform.” 1 Herein we find germs of the predominance of the divine will, which reigns supreme over all human efforts, and herein comes the question of divine mercy. Along this line developed the theory of divine mercy of all the devotional cults, and the only religious duty leit, therefore, to the followers of these schools, was unconditional self-resignation to the divine will.Up to the eighth and ninth centuries A.D. the domina­ting feature of Vaisnavism was this spirit rerignCaiioii!,0ni11 ^ self-resignation and seeking the haven ofthe infinite mercy of God. This veryspirit indicates that the elaborate system of religious duties, customs, rituals and ceremonies—strict rules for food and dress could find no prominence in the Vaisnava school; when­ever they were adopted they were adopted with the purpose of preparing a mental atmosphere favourable to the growth and development of the spirit of devotion and self-surrender. Already in the Bhagavata Purana we find elements ofpure love spoken of as the best and highest method through which the direct communion with God becomes possible. There the uncultured rustic cowherd girls ofBrndavana are regarded as the best of all religious people for their most sincere and passionate love for Srikrsna, the perfect incarnation of God. Devotion (bhakti) in later times was classified under two heads, V iz., vaidhi bhakti> i.e., devotion that arises through the performance of religious duties, observance of vows and rites, and strict obedience to the rules and regulations laid down in Vaisnava theology ;and the other kind of devotion is called passionate love! °f raganuga bhakti, i.e., passionate devo­tion,—or love for God that depends on no extraneous causa,—it is love absolutely for love’s sake. The former kind of devotion has always been spoken of as1 Kafha (1.2 .2 2"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"RELIGIOUS OUTLOOK OF THE SAHAJIYAS77being much inferior to the latter and as such the former is never recognised as devotion proper. This exclusive stress on love has naturally minimised to a considerable extent all the formalities, conventionalism and ceremonialism in religion. Even a man of the lowest origin, such, for example, as a Candala, in spite of being a riteless untouchable, has been acclaimed as being much superior to the twice-born (Brahmin), by being merely a sincere lover of God; on the other hand, a caste Brahmin, inspite of his loyalty to the rites, customs and duties of Brahminic life minus his sincerity of love, has been emphatically declared to be inferior to a Candala,— and this really represents the true spirit of Vaisnavism.Again, the Yoga-school of Indian thought has a religious.. .. , perspective of its own, and its emphasisIdealism or Yoga ^ mand the stress on the is exclusively on the subjective side ofsubjective side. . . . . i n r i .religion. 1 hough ail sorts or occultism and necromancy prevailed and still now prevail within the school of Hatha-yoga, and though with a large number of Indian Yogins Hatha-yoga has become a science of physical feats, serenity prevails within the school of Yoga proper. As a philosophical system Yoga represents a purely idealistic view and it is the mind in all its states and processes that has been held responsible for the whirl of birth and death and consequent sufferings. Religion, according to Yoga, consists in the final arrest of the states and processes of the mind, and the final arrest of the mind means the final arrest of the flux of coming and going and that is the state of final liberation. Yogic Sadhana, therefore, consists essentially in a process of psychological discipline against a moral background. It is evident from the verynature of Yoga proper that it leaves no scope for idolatry, ritualism and ceremonialism.

In the critical spirit of the old and mediaeval vernacular poets we shall find this spirit of Yoga acting strongly in unison with the spirit of the other heterodox systems.Inspite of their heterogeneous practices, ritualism and ceremonialism the Tantric schools (bothTi!ntral0<*0Xy ,hr Hindu and Buddhistic) breathe throughouta spirit of revolt against the orthodoxschools,—the Hindu Tantras having the same apathy towards the caste-religion or Varnasrama-dharma - of the Brahminic people as the Buddhist Tantras have against monasticism. We have already seen that the main emphasis of the Tantrikas is on the practical side of religion, and naturally they discouraged much reading and erudite scholarship, either philosophical or scriptural. The stress of Tantra proper was on Yoga, where discursive knowledge is of little avail. As for the other practices of Tantra, good or bad, their un­conventional nature is palpable, and to have these uncon­ventional practices recognised as purely religious practices the Tantras had to decry strongly the conventional practices of both Brahminism and Buddhism. Because of the extremely unconventional nature of the practices, the Tantrikas had to launch the bitterest attack on the commonly accepted practices and religious views of the orthodox systems. The importance of this critical and revolutionary spirit of the Tantras lies in the fact that the earliest literature of our language (we mean the songs of the Sahajiya Buddhists) inherited much of its spirit of revolt and criticism directly from the Buddhist Tantras.It will be noticed that the above critics of orthodoxHeterodoxy of the Brahminism were all theists ; but the severest early atheistic »chool«. attack came from the atheists of whom theCarv&kas, the Jainas and the Buddhists deserve mention here.."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"RELIGIOUS OUTLOOK OF THE SAHAJIYAS79Already in the Upanisads we find mention of schools of naturalism which recognised no ultimate conscious Being as the author of the universe, but thought of the world-process as a product of the course of nature. The materialists are generally spoken of in early texts as the Lokayata school or the school which admits the truth only of the visible world. In early Pali texts we find mention of many pre-Buddhistic heretical ascetics, of whom mention may be made of Sanjaya, the sceptic, Ajita Kesakambalin, the materialist, Purana-kasyapa, the ir>differentist, Maskarin Gosala, the wandering ascetic, and Kakuda Katyayana.1 The Carvaka school of thought deserves special mention here. The Carvakas were not believers in any kind of divinity,—the whole world-process including the psychosis, has been explained by them as the creation of matter. Let a man be happy so long as he lives;—life is short and none can escape the jaws of death ; and if once this body is burnt to ashes there is no returning back ;2 let one, therefore, eat, drink and be merry. The Carvakas strongly defied the authority of the scriptures. It has been said that religion is nothing but a device of the cunning priests for earning livelihood as they have no other resources. It is said,—-“There is no heaven, no emancipation, no soul,— nothing belonging to the after-world,—never are the duties, prescribed according to the castes and the different stages of life, capable of producing any effect. All fire-sacrifices, the three Vedas, the ascetic practice of holding three sticks (bound together), the practice of rubbing the body with ashes—are inventions of stupid and cowardish people for the earning of their livelihood.” 8 It has been further said,— “ If it be true that an animal, when killed in (he Jyotistoma-sacrifice goes to heaven,—why then should not' See A Hittory of Prc Buddhistic Indian Philosophy by Dr. B.

The controls are generally the vows of non-injury, truthfulness, abstinence from steal­ing, sex-control, non-acceptance of the objects of desire, gentle and holy talk, full control over body, speech and mind, habits of forgiveness, humility, penance, meditation on the real nature of the world and man, and principles of right conduct (caritra).

Thus the sacrificial religion of the Vedas was replaced by the Buddhists by the principles of moral virtues and good conduct (silacara).' Leaving aside the innovations of later Mahayana Buddhism or Tantric Buddhism where Buddhism developed innumerable gods and goddesses and the paraphernalia of worship, partly as a reaction against the negativistic regorism, partly through the influence of Hindu idolatry, and mainly through the influence of indigenous religious cults or such other cults of the neighbouring localities, Buddhism denied godhood unreservedly and even the existence of any supreme creator of the universe (cf. the Brahminic conception of Brahma, the creator of the universe) as no positive evidence of any such being can ever be demonstrated. The spirit of monastic Buddhism on this point is best illustrated in the Tevijja Sutta of the Digha-nikdya where the belief in the existence of Brahma and the belief in the Brahminical religious systems have been compared to the funny belief of a foolish man in the existence of some beautiful girl somewhere and his wish to enjoy her without knowing absolutely anything about her and her whereabouts.The Buddhists were strongly opposed to the caste-system and the Varnasrama religion of the caste Hindus. A great campaign against the caste-system is found in the Vajra-suci of Asvaghosa where the author tried to prove on the basis of the evidences found in the Vedic literature and the standard Brahminical texts like the Manu-samhita, the Mahabharata, etc., that the Brahmins as a class can neverCf. nindasi yajha-vidher ahaha iruti-jatam sadaya-hrdaya-dar&ita-pa&u-ghatam ! ke&ava dhrta-buddha-sarira jay a jagadUa hare II Gita-govinda of Jayadeva (1, \\3)."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"8 4OBSCURE RELIGIOUS CULTSbe superior to the other castes and that the superiority or the inferiority of man can never be determined by the accidental fact of birth.

He who does harm to living beings and who is the doer of all evil deeds, is never purified by (the water of) these rivers.”J Another instance of the criticism of the same nature can be cited from the dialogue between the nun Purmika and a Brahmin in the Theri-gatha. Punnika asks the Brahmin, who was bathing early in the morning in an extremely cold weather,—“ 1 indeed used to plunge into water in cold weather with a view to bring water,—but that was only out of fear of punishment or rebuke from the ladies I serve; but of whom are you so much afraid, O Brahmana, that you plunge into water and bear extreme cold with a shivering body?” “The reason is known to you”,—replied the Brahmin,—“ why then this question ? 1 acquire virtue and destroy the effect of my evil deeds (by bathing). .Whoever performs evil deeds, whether an old man or young, will escape the fruition of such evil acts by taking bath in holy water.” “ Who is the fool of fools ” asked Punnika “that has instructed you that the effects of evil-deeds can be washed away by bathing in the water ?

If we analyse and examine the ideas of the Buddhist Sahajiyas we shall find that, as an off-shoot of Tantric Buddhism, it embodies the heterodoxy of Buddhism in general mixed up with the spirit of Tantricism. In its aversion towards discursive reason and scholastic erudition and in its stress on the practical side of religion we may find the spirit of Tantra and Yoga work­ing together on it. Again the influence of the Tantra as well as of the Vedanta is palpable in the view that truth can never be found outside—it is to be intuited within. In the highest stress laid by the Sahajiyas on Sahaja-realisation or self-realisation as the summum bonum of the religious life we may trace the old Upanisadic spirit under the Buddhistic garb. Ideas, derived from different lines of thought, have merged together in a popular way in the songs and Dohas of these later Buddhist poets. In the Jaina Dohas we have almost a similar admixture against a popular Jaina back­ground. The devotional line of thought or the spirit of love is, however, conspicuous by its absence from the Buddhist and Jaina songs and Dohas; but it predominates in the songs and Dohas of the mediaeval period. The fact will be demonstrated when we shall deal with the salient features of the Vaisnava Sahajiyas and the Bauls of Bengal in a succeeding chapter, and with those of the innumerable Sahajiya and Sufi poets of Upper and Northern India in the appendix.

In the positive side, however, the conception of the Sahaja or the ultimate innate nature of all the objects and beings will give us a definite idea about the fundamental tenets of the school.The word ‘ Sahaja ’ literally means that which is born or which originates with the birth or origination of any entity (saha jayate iti sahajah). It is, therefore, what all the Dharmas possess by virtue of their very existence, and is thus the quintessence of all the Dharmas. As Maha-sukha is the quintessence of all the Dharmas, this Maha-sukha-nature is the Sahaja-nature of all the Dharmas. In the HeVajra- tantra we find,—“ The whole world is - of the nature of Sahaja—for Sahaja is the quintessence (sVarupa) of all; this quintessence is Nirvana to those who possess the perfectly pure Citta.” 1 But though this Sahaja in the form of Maha-sukha is realised in and through a physiological process, it should never be conceived as something belonging to the body; though it is within the body, it is not something physical.' As the quintessence of all, it is the absolute reality, both immanent and transcendent.We find in the Upanisads that the Brahman as the ultimate nature of our self and of the external world transcends all intellectual comprehension and verbal expression. Similar is the position of the Sahajiyas, who hold that the Sahaja1 tasmat sahajam jagat sarvam sahajam svarupam ucyate Isvarupam cVa nitVanam vi$uddh'a-hara-cetasa{ah ?) IIHevajra-tantra, MS.

As the Brahman nlture of Sahajakable to be realised within, so also this Sahaja-nature is to be intuited within (sva^ samvedya). We find in the Upanisads that when onerealises the self as the Brahman, there is neither the knower (jnata) nor the knowable (jneya) nor the knowledge (jnana); for, in such a transcendental state, “ where everything becomes the self, who will see whom and by what means, and who will know whom and by what means?” 1 This Upa­nisadic principle has also been adopted by the Sahajiyas in speaking of the Sahaja nature. It is said in the Hevajra- tantra,—“ Sahaja can neither be explained by any man nor can be expressed by any speech; it is realised by the self through the merit of serving at the feet of the Guru.” 2 In the Guhya- siddhi also it is said that this truth is to be attained through personal intuition,—the tongue can never speak anything of it.a That is an all-pervading supreme state where there is neither body nor speech nor any work.1 It has very nicely been said in a song of Kanha-pada—“ Whatever is related to the mind and to all the Agamas (scriptures) and religious texts and the beads (for counting the time of taking the name of God)—all are confusing and anomalous. Say, how Sahaja can be explained,—(for) neither body nor speech nor mind can enter into it. In vain does the Guru preach to the disciple, for, how can he explain that which transcends the capacity of all verbal means?

The Sahajiya cult, as an off­shoot of Tantric Buddhism, lays the highest stress on the practical method for realising the Sahaja-nature of the self and of all the Dharmas. From the point of view of literature, however, we are not much interested in the details of the yogic practice of the Sahajiyas, and we, therefore, do not propose to go into all the details. We shall give here a very brief account of the main practices and also of the state of supreme bliss produced through this process of Sadhana.(i) The Guru-VadaThe most important thing in connection with the practical aspect of the Sahajiya religion is the selection of a proper preceptor. The whole field of Indian philosophy and reli­gion is characterised by a unanimous emphasis on the Guru- vada or the doctrine of the preceptor. It will be seen that in a sense all the systems of Indian philosophy and religion are mystic,—for according to all the systems truth always transcends intellectual apprehension or discursive specu­lation,—it is to be intuited within through the help of the"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"preceptor, who has already realised it. Truth is transmitted r , from the preceptor to the disciple justLiuiu-vada— a salientfeature of Indian philo as light from one lamp to the other. Thesophy and religion. . , . 1 • 1only way of knowing the truth is, there­fore, to seek the grace of the Guru, who, and who alone, can make a man realise the Supreme Reality. It is believed that the true preceptor in his non-dual state identifies himself with the disciple and performs from within the disciple all that is necessary for the latter's spiritual uplift. The true disciple becomes an instrument in the hands of the true preceptor. It is for this reason that in Indian religions the Guru is held in the highest esteem. In many of the Indian religious systems the Guru is a substitute even for God, or at least God is to be realised through the medium of the person of the Guru, who stands as the living proof for the existence of God. To ordinary people God is a mere time- honoured belief; but the preceptor opens the eyes of the disciple and makes him realise the existence of God. Tantricism, which lays the greatest emphasis on the practical aspect of religion, naturally, lays equal stress on the function of the Guru. Moreover, many of the Tantric practices are secret practices involving complex processes of esoteric yoga. Because of this stringent nature of the Tantric prac­tice the help of the Guru is enjoined to be sought at every step. These intricate esoteric practices, when properly and systematically carried out, may lead a man to the highest spiritual elevation,—on the other hand there is the chance of physical and mental aberration at every step, and if they are not pursued very cautiously and methodically with theguidance and directions of the experienced Stringency of the Guru they may lead, and are very likelyesoteric Sadhana res­ponsible for so much to lead, a man into the darkest abyssstress on Guru vada rill n f lin Tantricism. ot h e ll.

In almost all the Tanlras the Guru is always praised in the superlative terms and is declared to be the highest reality itself.1 Almost all the Carya-songs speak highly of the Guru, who is the only help in the path of Sadhana, and in almost all the songs the yogins are warned of the pitfalls of the path and are enjoined repeatedly to seek the help of the Guru, wherever there is an iota of doubt in mind and wherever there is the slightest difficulty. So copious, so clear and so emphatic are the references to the preceptor in the Carya-songs that we need not illustrate our statement by quotations. We shall see later on that the theory of Guru-vada, as we find in the Dohas and the Carya-songs, may be recognised as one of the main characteristics of all the religious sects represented by our old and mediaeval literature.2[ii) The Importance of the Body in the SadhanaIn connection with the practical aspect of the Buddhist Sahajiya cult we should also notice thatBody—the micro* i • 1 • • • • rcosmof the universe, /along with the uncompromising spirit otrevolt against all formalities and orthodoxy in religion, great emphasis is laid in the Sahajiya literature on the human body, which is conceived as a microcosm of the universe. This feature, we have hinted, predominates in all the Tantras in general, wherever the yogic element pre­vails; but as the Sahajiyas laid their whole stress on the yogic element this theory of the body being the epitome of the whole universe was most emphasised. In the HeVajra-tantra we find^that the Lord (Bhagavan) was asked by a Bodhisatlva1 See the first part of the Subhdsitaaamgraha, edited by Cecil Bendali, where various quotations are to be found from various Buddhist Tgntric texts in praise of the Guru and also defining the nature of a true preceptor.2 Vide Infra, Ch. V, Ch. VII, Appendix 'At."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"1 0 4OBSCURE RELIGIOUS CULTSwhether there was any necessity at all of this physical world and the physical body, everything being in reality nothing but pure void. To this the reply of the Lord was that without the body there was no possibility of the realisation of the great bliss and here lies the importance of the body.1 But though the truth is within the body and arises out of it, it should never be confused to be something physical.2 In the Sn-kala-cakra we find that without the body there cannot be any perfection, neither can the supreme bliss be realised in this life without the body,—it is for this reason that the body with the nervous system is so important for yoga; if perfec­tion (siddhi) of the body be attained, all kinds of perfection in the three worlds are very easily obtained. * In discourage ing going on pilgrimage and bathing in the sacred rivers, Saraha says,—“ Here (within this body) is the Gangesand the Jumna, here the ‘ Gariga-sagara ’All truth within. J ,(the mouth of the Ganges), here are Prayaga and Benares,—here the sun and the moon. Here are the sacred places, here the Plthas and the Upa-plthas—I have not seen a place of pilgrimage and an abode of bliss like my body.” 4 The TattVa is within the house of our body; yet, curious indeed it is, that we generally roam about in the whole world in search of it. It is nicely said by Saraha,— “ He is within the house,—but you are enquiring about him outside.

Thus Kanha-pada says in a song,— The yogin Kanha has become a Kapall,4 and has entered into the practices of yoga, and he is sporting in the city of his body in a non-dual form.” ' Again he says,—“ Makethe five Tathagatas the five oars and, O Kanha, steer the body on and tear off the snare of illusion.” The image of the body being the boat and a pure mind the oar for proceeding on to the way of realising the truth is very popular with the poets of the Carya-songs.gharcm acchai vahire pucchai I pai dekkhai padivcsl pucchai II saraha bhanai vadha janau appa I nau so dhea na dharana jappa II 2 pandia saala sattha bahhhanai I dehahim buddha vasanta na janai II * asarira (fcoi) sariahi lukko I jo tahi janai so tahi mukko II4 Kapall is the general name given to the Tantric Yogins, bul here, in the commentary of the Caryas (and also in the commentary of the Hevajra-tanlra, MS.

Buddhists conceived of three plexuses orlotuses, with which they identified the three Kayas. Thus the lowest Cakra in the region of the navel represents the lowest Kaya, i.e., the Nirmana-kaya (body of transformation); the Cakra in the heart is identified with the Dharma-kaya, (i.e., the body of ultimate reality as the cosmic unity); and the Cakra just below the neck is said to be the Sambhoga-kaya (the body of bliss).2 The Vajra-kaya or the Sahaja-kaya, which is the fourth Kaya with the Tantric Buddhists, is located in the Usmsa-kamala, or the Sahasrara of the Hindus. It is also called the Maha-sukha-cakra or the Maha-sukha-kamala, being the seat of supreme realisation.We have seen that the Bodhicitta is constituted of two factors, Viz., Sunyata and Karuna, or Prajna and Upaya. Among the nerves of the body, which are innumerable, thirty- two are more important,' of which again three are the most1 These are (1) MuladhSracakra, or the sacri-coccygeal plexus, situated between the penis and the anus and facing down with four petals of red colour; (2) Svfidhisthana-cakra, or sacral plexus, near the root of the penis with six petals of the colour of vermilion; (3) Manipura-cakra, or the lumber plexus in the region of the navel with ten petals of the colour of the cloud; (4) Anahata-cakra in the heart with twelve petals of the colour of Bandhuka-flower (red) ; (5) Vi&iddha-cakra or the laryngeal and pharyngeal plexus at the junction of the spinal choid and the medulla oblangata with sixteen petals of smoky colour; and (6) Ajfia-cakra between the eye-brows with two petals of white colours. Above ail, there is the Sahasrara-cakra or lotus (padma) in the highest cerebral region.2 In the natural order, however, the Cakra in the heart, being next to the Cakra of Nirmana-kaya, ought to have been the Sambhoga-kSya and the Cakra below the neck ought to have been the D.iarma-kaya; this would have been consistent with the general order oi the Kayas.3 See Srtsamputika, MS. p. 3(B)."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"PRACTICES AND SUPREME BLISS107important, two by the two sides of the spinal cord and one in the middle; with these two side-nerves are identified the cardinal principles of Prajna and Upaya, and the middle nerve, which is the meeting-place of the other two nerves, is spoken of as the path for the Sahaja, or rather Avadhuti-marga or simply Avadhutika.

This principle and practice of Kaya- sadhana is, we shall see, common to all schools of esoteric yoga and the exclusive emphasis of the Natha-siddhas was on this Kaya-sadhana.1 Yoga in general involves psycho- physiological processes ; it is therefore that higher kinds of yoga should never be entered upon without a mature or perfect body. For this purpose of making the body mature or perfect the practices of Hatha-yoga are to be adopted. It is for this reason that the Buddhist Siddha- caryas were, in the practical field, great Hatha-yogins. In the Carya-songs we find frequent reference to the strengthen­ing of the ‘ Skandhas’ or the elements whose aggregate constitutes the body. Until and unless the ‘Skandhas’ are strengthened, or, in other words, the body is made ripe2 through practice of Hatha-yoga, the supreme realisation, known in the Buddhist fold as Maha-sukha becomes a lulling sleep of the senses or something like a swoon. It will be a blunder to confuse this state of swoon with the state of Maha-sukha. It has been said in the Rati-Vajra that if the body and the mind fall into a swoon in the practice of yoga, how can there be perfection in yoga ? 8 The yogin has, therefore, been repeatedly advised to acquire a strong body before entering on the yogic process for the attainment of Maha-sukha.1 Vide Infra.*L For ripe (pakva) and unripe (apakva) body, see Infra.3 murcchiie skandha-vijnane kutah siddhir anindita IIQuoted in the commentary of the CaiyS-song No. 1."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"PRACTICES AND SUPREME BLISS109It has been explained before how the principles of Prajna and Upaya were identified with the female and the male (or even with the female organ and the male organ which are known also as the lotus and the thunder), and Bodhiciita was identified with the bliss produced through the union ofthe female and the male.

It is held that the Bodhicitta has two aspects ; in the ordinary restless aspect (i.e., in the ~ rr, form of gross sexual pleasure which1 wo aspects of Bodhi-citta Samvria and accompanies the discharge) it is calledVivrtaSamvrta, and in the motionless aspect of intense bliss it is called the Vivrta or the Paramarthika. This Samvrta and Paramarthika aspects of the Bodhicitta represent the Samvrti-safya, i.e., the phenomenal or the provisional aspect of reality and the Paramarthika, i.e., the ultimate reality of Mahayana philosophy. The yogic Sadhana of the Sahajiyas is employed first for the production of Bodhicitta through the union of the Prajna and the Upaya and then for transforming the Samvrta Bodhicitta into Paramarthika. The contention of the Sahajiyas is that so long as the intense bliss produced through the union of the Prajna and the Upaya remains in the region of Mani­pura-cakra or in the region of the navel which is the Nirmana- cakra or the gross physical plane of bondage and suffering, it keeps the yogin in the world of grossness.

In the process of upward march the bliss first produced goes on acquiring a higher nature and when it reaches the Usnisa-kamala or the Vajra-kaya or Sahaja-kaya it becomes Maha-sukha, where all kinds of duality vanish in a unique realisation of supreme bliss.(id) The Middle Path in the Esoteric SadhanaA dominant feature of Mahayana is its stress on the.... . . . , middle path avoiding the opposite extremes1 he philosophicalvi?w of the middle of views. Thus the philosophical systemof Nagarjuna is known as the ‘ Madhya- mika ' system, or the philosophical school of the middle course, and it is held that Nagarjuna’s school is a school of the middle course in the sense that he steered clear a trans­cendental path which denies the views of the positivists as well as the negativists. The philosophy of the Abhuta- pari^alpa of Vasubandhu as expounded in his well-known treatise Madhyanta-vibhaga is again a challenge to both the extreme realists (like the Sarvasti-vadins) and the extreme negativists (like the Madhyamikas),1 and the Vijnana-vadins always professed to be the followers of the middle path. Apart from these philosophical speculations we find in the religious sphere on the whole that the Mahayanists were opposed to the Idea of Nirvana as much as to that of existence in the world of suffering (bhava or samsara); and according to them the final state is neither the Bhava, nor the Nirvana,—it is rather a state of non-duality where BhaVa and Nirvana become one and the same. In connection1 The Madhyamika school was always criticised by the Vijnana-vadins (as also by the Vedantins) as a pure negativistic school."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"PRACTICES AND SUPREME BLISS111with the idea of Advaya or Yuganaddha we have seen that the final state is that where all kinds of duality areabsorbed in a principle of non-duality.Middle path*n nri • • 1 j . i i i iy0ga. 1 nis p rin cip le w a s ad op ted a lso by theSahajiyas in their process of yoga. We have seen that the nerves in the right and the left in the microcosm of the body represent the principles of duality; their separate function which binds one to the world of sufferings must, therefore, be checked by the Yogin and they must unite with the middle nerve and function there con­jointly. The middle nerve is, therefore, the middle pathwhich leads to the non-dual state of Sahaja.The flow of Bodhicitta must be regulated along themiddle nerve, and this is the most important and at the same time the most difficult part of the Sadhana, and it is for this reason that in the Carya-padas and the Dohafcosas as well as in many of the Buddhist Tantric texts we find repeated warnings to the novice to take practical suggestions from the preceptor at this stage. If the flow of Bodhicitta moves either left or right, the whole thing is spoiled. In the Carya-padas, therefore, we find repeated warnings not , to go either right or left, but toMiddle path vari­ously described in the steer clear through the middle path.

I have sat where the couple of the nerves Dhamana (the nerve in the left) and Cam ana (the nerve in the right) are united together.” 1 Gundari-pada says,—“ Destroy the mother-in-law (vital breath) in the house (i.e., the body) and control the Manimula,—and split up the sides of the1 bhanai lui dmhe sane diiha I (jhane dif/ia—Bagchi) dhamana camana beni pandi baifha II Song No. I."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"112OBSCURE RELIGIOUS CULTSsun and the moon.’*1 Again Catilla-pada says,—“ Thedeep river of existence is flowing on in a tremendous flow; there is mud on either side of the river, but the middle is unfathom­able.

The two sides, i.e., the two nerves on the left and the right are muddy, i.e., they are the paths which lead to the principles of defilement,{—and the middle nerve leads to the depth of the truth and so it is unfathomable. The bridge however, signifies the establishment of the unity between the two aspects of the Bodhicitta, viz., Samvrti and Para- marthika,4 in other words, it is the way to realise as well as demonstrate how the physical Bodhicitta can be transformed into the ultimate Bodhicitta through processes of yoga.

In the Carya-songs we find frequent references to this female force variously called as the Candali, Dombl, Savarl, YoginI, Nairamani, /Sahaja-sundari, etc. and we also find frequent mention of the union of the yogin with this personified female deity.This Yogini or the Sahaja-damsel should not be confused with the woman of flesh and blood, associated with the actual yogic practices; she is but an internal force of the nature of vacuity (Sunyata) or essencelessness (nairatma) and great bliss residing in the different plexuses in different stages of yogic practice.In the Hindu Tantras we find that in the Muladhara- cakra (which is the lowest of the Cakras) remains coiled an electric force known as the Serpent-power (coiled like a serpent) or the Kula-kundalini Sakti, and the Sadhana consists in rousing this Sakti, lying dormant in the Muladhara, and in making her unite with the Siva in the Sahasrara ; and we have seen that the union of the Sakti with the Siva is what is meant by perfection in Tantric Yoga. Corresponding to this Kula-kundalini Sakti of the Hindu Tantras we find the conception of a fire-force of the Buddhists in the. . Nirmana-kaya, and she is generally des-Sakti as Candali _ i ?cribed as the Candali. Thus it is said by Kanha-pada in one of his songs,—“ One is that lotus, sixty- four are the petals,—the Dombi climbs upon it and dances.” 1 In the Hevajra-tantra we find, “ The Candali burns in the navel and she burns the five Tathagatas and the goddesses like Locana and others, and when all is burnt, the moon pours down the syllable hum.\"'2 This Candali is the goddess Nairatma or Avadhutika or Prajna,1 ek<i so paduma cauiatthi pakhtidt Iiahlm cadi nacaa domhi bapudt II Song No. 10.2 candall jvalita nabhau dahati panca-tathagatan I dahati ca locanadlni dagdhe hum sravatc sasl IIH eva jr a-1 antra., MS., p. 4 (R).116 OBSCURE RELIGIOUS CULTS"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"PRACTICES AND SUPREME BLISS117and when she is roused through the yogic practice in the navel, all the five Skandhas or the material elements represented by the five Tathagatas and ail the goddesses like Locana and others associated with these Tathagatas are burnt away, and when all is burnt the moon, which represents the Bodhi-citta, pours down hum, which again represents the ultimate knowledge {vajra-jmnn).{ / \\ n a song of Gunjarl- pada we find,—“ The lotus and the thunder meet together in the middle and through their union Candali is ablaze / that blazing file is in contact with the house of the Dombi,—1 take the moon and pour water.

This concep­tion of Sakti of the Buddhist Sahajiyas is an adoption of the general Tantric conception of the Sakti mixed up with the principle of the destructive fire, or the fire-force situated in the navel as postulated and emphasised by the Natha-yogins.1 When through the yogic-pro:ess this Sakti is made to move upwards and is gradually dissociated from the principles of grossness and defilement, she gradually reveals to the yogin her pure nature of bliss and in the region of the lotus in the head, i.e., in the highest state completely dissociated from the principle of grossness and defilement, she becomes pure Maha-sukha.In the upward march the Candali is often described as ... f the Dombl and when in the Maha-sukha-Various transforma­tions o f t h e C a n d a l i in t o kamala, she is the Sahaja-damsel (Sahaja-Dombl, Nairamani, l \\ • 1 1 7 r *Savaii, SaKaja-sundari, sundari) with whom the perfect yogin is etc always united.

O Dombi, I shall keep company with thee and it is for this purpose that I have become a naked Kapali without aversions.

Thou art the Dombi and I am the Kapali, for thee have I put on a garland of bones.

In the metaphor of selling the loom and the basket of bamboo there seems to be a pun on some of the words ; tanti in the vernacular means a loom, but it may also be associated with the Sanskrit word tantrx or tantra to signify the thread of mental constructions; the word camgeda means a basket (made of bamboo), but the commentary explains it as irisayabhasam, i.e., the defiling principle of objectivity. The lake mentioned above is the body and the lotus-stalk is the Bodhi-citta ; and the Dombi, unless she is perfectly purified, spoils both of them. It is for this reason that the Dombi should be purified and made steady in order to attain the Bodhi-citta. This latter Dombi, however, seems to be the vital wind, impure and uncontioiled, and in the HeVajra-tantra we find that the element of air is represented by the goddess Dombi.2 In a song Vina-pada, who has made a lyre with the sun, the moon and the Avadhuti, says that when the lyre produces sound, the Vajradhara (the yogin himself) dances and the goddess (Nairatma) sings and thus the drama of the Buddha is played. ’ Kanha-pada says in another song,—“ Of what nature is, O Dombl, thy cleverness ?—the aristocrats are outside thee and the Kapalis are within (i.e., the arrogant pundits and the orthodox priests can never have any access to the Sahaja-Nairatma, but only the Kapall yogins can realise her). Thou hast spoiled everything, through the law of cause and effect thou hast destroyed the moon. (The s gnificance is that the Nairatma, when covered with the veils of ignorance, deceives the whole world through illusory knowledge, in that respect she spoils the moon, i.e.,1 asparsa bhaVati yasmdt tasmat dom bl prakathyatc I H evajra-tantra, MS., p. 2 (B).55 Cf.

Some speak ill of thee, but the learned never cast thee off from the neck (i.e. the Sambhoga- cakra). Thou art the Kama-candah, —there is no woman more cunning and unfaithful than the Dombi.,M In another song of Kanha-pada we find a beautiful analogy of marriage with the Dombi. First follows a wedding procession in which existence and extinction are made the musical instruments pataha and madala and the mind and the vital wind are similarly made two other musical instru­ments,—the drum is proclaiming a victorious sound and Kanha is on his march for marrying the Dombi. By marrying the Dombi the gain is the escape frcm birth, and the transcendental region (anatu-dhoma. = anutiara-dhoma) of Maha-sukha is obtained as the dowiy. After marriage day and night pass away in sex-discourse and the night is passed in the bright company of the YoginI (i.e., the dark night of ignorance vanishes away at the appearance of the effulgent Sahaja-knowledge). The yogin who is in love with the Dombi never leaves her even for a moment and always remains mad in the Sahaja-bliss “ In a song of Kukkuri-pada we find it put into the mouth of the Nairaima,— “ I am free from all hopes and desires and the void-mind is my husband,—the nature of the realisation of bliss that proceeds from me cannot be expressed. ” 5 In another song, Savara-pada says, “ High is the mountain (i.e., the spinal column) and there on it (i.e., in the Maha-sukha*cakra which is above the spinal column) sits the Sabarl girl; she is decked with the coloured feathers of the peacock and with a garland of jequirity on her neck.

When the Sakti reaches the Vajra-kaya or the Sahaja-kaya she becomes Sunyata herself,—and our perfected Citta becomes the lord Vajra-sattva; real Maha-sukha follows only when this Sunyata is united in the Sahaja-kaya with the Vajra-sattva.There are, however, some signs which are observed by the yogin when the ultimate slate is produced. In the Sri -guhya-samaja we find mention of five such signs: the first is of the form of a mirage, the second of the form of smoke, the third in the form of a firefly, the fourth is like a burning lamp and the fifth is like the stainless sky.1 These signs are rather significant. In the com­mentary on the Marma-kalitia-tanira it has been explained that the sign of mirage signifies the knowledge about thebut in Dombl there is only uncompromising non-duality. In Bengal, continues MM. Slstrl, there was a predominance of monistic thought and therefore the author Bbusuka says that he has become a Bengalee or a pure non-dualist. We, however, do not know on the authority of what text or texts MM. Sastrl has made these observa­tions. We have never come across any text explaining or even mentioning these three ways of Sahaji>a Sadhana and it s-eems a puzzle to us why Avadhfiti should represent dualism. His a«sertion that Bengal has always stood paiticularly for non­dual knowledge does not also seem to be historical.1 prathamam mar'icikdkdram dhumrakdram dvitiyakam 1 trtiyam kbadyotakdram caturtham dlpavaj jvalam It paftcaman tu sa4d-lo\\am nirabhram gagana-sannibham ISrbguhya-samdja-tantra, Ch.

The Vaisnava Sahajiya cult has a considerable literature to its credit. As many as two hundred and fifty manuscripts of small texts containing the various doctrines and practices of the cult are preserved in the Manuscript Library of the Calcutta University and about an equal number of texts (many of them being common with those preserved in the Manuscript Library of the Calcutta University) belong to the Manuscript Library of the Vanglya Sahitya- parisad. These texts, however, do not possess much intrinsic literary value and as such their contribution to Bengali literature would not have been of much importance but for the fact that they help us in the study of a large number of lyrical songs belonging both to the Sahajiya Vaisnava and the standard Vaisnava cults, both of which accepted the ideal of Paraklya love as contrasted with the ideal of Svalyya love in their doctrines.1These love-lyrici, belonging to the province of Vaisnavism,. combine in them a genuine poetic veinGeneral nature of ^ ,the cult and relation of an absorbing human interest with anwith standard Vais- . . , ,nava religion and avowedly religious sentiment and as such1 era ure’ they offer a good specimen of how far itmay be possible for aesthetic sentiment and religious senti-1 For the ideals of Svaklya and Paraklya see infra♦ p. 144."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"13ZOBSCURE RELIGIOUS CULTSment to combine in popular poetry. In the history of the Vaisnava literature of Bengal the most important factor is the ideal of Parakiya love; but whereas the ideal of Parakiya love was merely recognised as a theological speculation in standard Vaisnavism, it was accepted even in its practical bearing by the Sahajiyas. In the history of Bengal Vaisnav­ism there seems to have been a process of interaction between the two sects—the practice of the Sahajiyas influencing to a great extent the ideal of the Vaisnava poets, and the ideal of the Vaisnavas in its turn influencing the practices of the Sahajiyas. Though the story of the love- episodes of Candidasa, the greatest love-poet of Bengal, with the washer-woman, Rami, is still now shrouded in mystery and as such cannot be credited historically as sapplying proof of Candidasa himself being an exponent of the Sahajiya practice, yet we should remember that tradition always indicates possibility. Judging from the heaps of tradition centering round the figure of poet Candidasa and also from the number of Sahajiya poems ascribed to him, it will not b^ far out of the mark to hold that there might have been some truth in the tradition of Candidasa himself being a Sahajiya Sadhaka and that his practical culture of the divinisation of human love had supplied him with the deep inspiration that made him the immortal poet of the Radha- rCrsaa songs. The indebtedness of Sri-Caitanya to the love- lyrics of Jayadeva, Vidyapati and Candidasa is well-known through the Caitanya-caritamrta (a standard biography of Caitanya) and the songs of some other poets; the inspiration derived from these songs was not negligible in moulding Caitanya’s ideal of divine love. Apart from the controversy over the religious view-point of Candidasa and its influence on Caitanya’s ideal of love, it may be held that the gensral history of the Vaisnava Sahajiya movement with its stress on Parakiya love was closely related to the general love* movement of Bengal; it is because of this close relation"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"THE VAISNAVA SAHAJIYA CULT1 3 3between the two that the rich field of Bengali lyrics cannot be fully and properly studied without a proper study of the Sahajiya religion and literature.The lyrics belonging to the Vaisnava Sahajiya school are generally ascribed to the well-known poet Candidasa and to some other poets like Vidyapati, Rupa, Sanatana, Vrndavana-dasa, Krsna-dasa Kaviraja, Narahari, Narottama, Locana, Caitanya-dasa and others, and the innumerable Sahajiya texts are also ascribed to their authorship.Such assignment, which was evidently made with a view to securing authoritative support from the great Vaisnava poets and thinkers for the unconventional practice of the Sahajiyas, need not be credited historically. In their zeal for propaganda these Sahajiyas have held all the great poets like Jayadeva, Vidyapati, Candidasa and others, and the great Vaisnava apostles like Ropa, Sanatana, Svarupa Damodara, Jiva Gosvami and others to be the exponents of Sahajiya practice. Even Sri-Caitanya himself has been held by some of the Sahajiyas as having practised Sahaja Sadhana with female companions and attained perlection through it,1 as lord Buddha was held by the Buddhist Sahajiyas as having practised Sahaja Sadhana in company of his consort Gopa.

This yogic practice with its accessories, being associated with the philosophy of Siva and Sakti, stands at the centre of the net-work of the Hindu Tantric systems, and when associated with the speculations on Prajna and Upaya of later Buddhism, has given rise to the Tantric Buddhist cults including the Buddhist Sahajiya system; and again, when associated with the speculations on Krsna and Radha conceived as Rasa and Rati in Bengal Vaisnavism, the same yogic practice and discipline has been responsible for the growth and development of the Vaisnava Sahajiya movement of Bengal. It will, therefore, be incorrect to say, as has really been said by some scholars, that the Vaisnava Sahajiya movement of Bengal is a purely post- Caitanya movement having no relation whatsoever with the earlier Buddhist Sahajiyas and that the two cults are distinct fundamentally.

But we have seen that the angle of vision from which the different schools of Indian religious thought criticised one another was different. Consequently, whereas the criticism of the Buddhist Sahajiyas represents an admixture of the spirit of Buddhism, Vedanta, Tantra and Yoga, the criticism of the Vaisnava Sahajiyas is marked by a dominating spirit of love, which is the watchword of their Sadhana, although, however, the lurking influence of Yoga and Tantra is not altogether missing. The Buddhist Sahajiyas, we have seen, inherited from the Yogic and Tantric schools in general the spirit that all truth underlying the universe as a whole is contained in the microcosm of the human body; this belief, we shall presently see, was brought1 See A gam a-grantha and A n a n d a-bhairava edited by Mr. M.

Many of the songs ascribed to Candidasa are good specimens of such an enigmatic style. Thus it is clear that in spirit as well as in literary representation the relation between the Buddhist Sahajiyas and the Vaisnava Sahajiyas clearly shows an easy gliding from the one to the other.Historically it seems that the fail of the Pala dynasty of Bengal marked also the fall of Buddhismcauseof’fhe transition' in the province and that there was somethinglike a Hindu revival during the reign of the Senas, who succeeded the Palas.

Candidasa of the fourteenth century popularised the legends and ideals of the love of Radha and Krsna through his exquisite lyrical poems. Similar lyrics were composed also by poet Vidyapati of Mithila, who was contemporaneous with Candidasa and enjoyed enormous popularity in Bengal; this wide-spread popularity of the Radha-Krsna songs began to influence the mind of the people belonging to all substrata of the society. It was through the influence of this love-ideal of the Radha-Krsna songs that the ideology of the Buddhist Sahajiyas gradually began to change, and the change of methodology was consequent on the change of ideology.With the popularity of the Radha-Krsna songs the ideal of Parakiya Rati, or the unconventional love between man and woman not bound by the conjugal tie, became em­phasised . In almost all the theological discussions of the Vaisnavas of the post-Caitanya period the superiority of this ideal of Paraklya love to that of Svakiya was variously demonstrated. In his Typical Selections from O ld Bengali Literaiurd (Vol. II, pp. 1638-1643) Dr. D.C. Sen has quoted twoold documents, belonging tothe first half of the eighteenth century, where we find that regular debates were arranged between the Vaisnava exponents of the Parakiya and the Svakiya ideals of love, and in the debates the upholders of the Svakiya view were sadly defeated and had to sign documents admitting the supremacy of the Parakiya ideal of love. This will help us in guessing how much influence this Parakiya ideal did exert on the people of the time belonging to the Vaisnava fold. This ideal of Parakiya love has been the strongest factor in moulding the doctrines of the Sahajiya Vaisnavism of Bengal.It is customary to sneer at the Vaisnava Sahajiya cult as an order of debauchery under the cloak of religion.

Of course, sometimes this state of supreme bliss has been criticised as a state of mere thought-construction,— and Nirvana has been defined as a pure state of negation bereft of all sorts of thoughticonstructions j1 but in general Maha-sukha itself, bereft ofmibjectivity and objectivity, has been held to be the final state—the state of vacuity and perfect enlightenment. The final state of Maha-sukha as the state of Sahaja of the Buddhists is also the final state of Sahaja with the Vaisnava Sahajiyas; but the Vaisnavas conceived this Sahaja state as the state of supreme love, and this supreme love has been conceived as the primordial substance which underlies the world-proceSs as a whole. But how can this Sahaja be the ultimate reality? It is the ultimate reality inasmuch as it is the non-dual state of the unity of Siva and Sakti, which are but the two aspects of the absolute reality as conceived in the Hindu Tantras.2 Again in the Buddhist school it is the non-dual state of unity of Prajna and Upaya which are also the two aspects of the absolute reality.3 The principles of Siva and Sakti or Upaya and Prajna are re­presented by man and woman, and it is, therefore, that when through the process of Sadhana man and woman can realise their pure nature as Siva and Sakti, or Upaya and Prajna, the supreme bliss arising out of the union of the two becomes the highest state whereby one can realise the ultimate nature of the absolute reality.

This ideal of the final positive state of love could very well be utilised by the Sahajiyas in a slightly modified way and thus the Sahajiyas could gradually associate their practices with the whole net­work of Bengal Vaisnava theology.

In fact, the importance of the Vaisnava Sahajiyas consists in the high pitch which they reached in their enquiry and practical culture of love-psychology and in the new interpretation of our whole being offered in the light of love. It was a religious process of the divinisation of human love and the consequent discovery of the divine in man.

The ultimate Being, it is held, may be conceived in three of its states, either as the unqualified Brahman, or as the Paramatman, the indwelling principle of all beings, or as the Bhagavan, the active and qualified God. Krsna as Bhagavan possesses three powers, Viz., Svarupa-sakti, i.e., the power which He possesses by virtue of His ultimate nature, Jiva-sakti or the power through which all the beings are produced (also known as the Tatastha sakti, the accidental power), and th e May a-sakti* through which evolves the material world. This Svarupa- sakti of the Lord has again three attributes, viz., the attribute of existence (sat), the attribute pf pure consciousness (cit) and the attribute of bliss (artanda). The potency of the three attributes acts like three powers, in the nature of God, which are known as Sandhinl (the power of existence), Samvit (the power of consciousness) and Hladim (the power of bliss which is of the nature of infinite love). The transfiguration of this power of bliss or love is Radha, and as such the very being of Radha is already involved in the very nature of Krsna and the two are one and the same in the ultimate principle. Why then the apparent separation of Radha from Krsna ? It is for the self-realisation of Krsna. God has within His nature two aspects, the enjoyer and the enjoyed, and without the reality of the enjoyed He cannot even realise His own nature.as the enjoyer. Radha repre­sents the eternal enjoyed while Krsna is the eternal enjoyer,— and the enjoyed and the enjoyer being co-relative, the reality of the one involves the reality of the other; or, in other words Radha as the eternal enjoyed is as much real as Krsna the eternal enjoyer. This inseparable relation between the two is the eternal love-dalliance of Krsna with Radha,—and as Radha is eternally realising the value of her whole being with reference to her relation to the eternal enjoyer Krsna, Krsna too is eternally enjoying Radha to ^realise the infinite potency of love and bliss that is in him.THE VAISNAVA SAHAJIYA CULT 1 4 3"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"1 4 4OBSCURE RELIGIOUS CULTSThis mutual relation of love is the secret of the whole drama enacted in the eternal land of Vrndavana.

So, to understand the nature of this divine love, human love has been analysed psychologically into all its varieties and niceties to the minutest details, and it has been found on analysis that divine love can be expressed only through the analogy of the most intense and the most romantic and unconventional love that exists between a man and a woman who become bound together by the idealof love for love’s sake.

This is theideal of Paraklya love,1 which is the best human analogy for divine love. It is because of this theological ideal that in none of the legends of Radha-Krsna is Radha depicted as the wife of Krsna, she is generally depicted as the wife of another cowherd, or as a maid just attaining the prime of youth.1 Paraklyfi love literally means the love of a man with a woman, who legally belongs to a man other than the lover."},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"£rl-Caitanya, as he has been docetically conceived by his followers, combined in him the jenjoyer and the enjoyed,— and it has been said that he was of the ultimate nature of Krsna hallowed with the lustre of the supreme emotionof Radha (radha-bhava-dyuti-suvalita).Rsdhs and fCrsns • i r i l* * • l /*combined in Caifanya, 1 his speaks or the religious attitude or—Caitanya s religious • nri J 1 i • lr iattitude—Radha-bhava.

The attitude of the Vaisnava poets was Safyhi-bhava rather than Radha-bhava. Sri-Caitanya placed himself in the position of Radha and longed with all the tormenting pangs of heart for union with his beloved Krsna; but the Vaisnava poets, headed by Jayadeva, Candidas and Vidyapati, placed themselves rather in the position of the Sakhis, or the female companions of Radha and Krsna, who did never long for their union with Krsna,— but ever longed for the opportunity of witnessing from a distance the eternal love-making of Radha and Krsna in the supra-natural land of Vrndavana (<apralqrta-vrndavana).

In the Hindu Tantras, we have seen, all men and women have been held to be nothing but the incarnations of Siva and Sakti manifested in the physical form,—and in the Buddhist philosophy they have been spoken of as the embodiment of Upaya and Prajna respectively, and this philosophy has most probably influenced the VaisnavaSahajiyas in their belief of men and women beingKrsna and Radha in their Svarupa. We have pointed out before that many of the Vaisnava Sahajiya texts are introduced in the form of the earlier Agamas and Nigamas, and in these texts Krsna and Radha have always been explained as nothing but the different forms of Siva and Sakti, and we have also pointed out that Sivahas sometimes been described as practising the Sahaja Sadhana with Sakti as Krsna with Radha.Even in a popular Vaisnava text like the Brahma-samhita, which was brought by Sri-Caitanya himself from South India, the Tantric influence on Vaisnavism is palpable. In the fifth chapter (which only is available now-a-days) of the Brahma-samhita we find that the lotus of thousand petals in the cerebrum-region is described as Gokula, the abode of Krsna. Within the lotus we find description also of the Tantric yanira (the physiological machinery through which truth is to be realised) as also of the la\\a (the wedge, the support). Siva of the nature of the linga (the symbol of the male productive energy) is described as ~ the Lord Narayana and Sakti of the nature of the yoni (the symbol of the female productive energy) is described as Rama Dev!

Sahaja is the emotion of the purest love flowing between Rasa and Rati or Kama and Madana. For the realisation of this Sahaja-nature, therefore, a particular pair of man and woman should first of all realise their true self as Rasa and Rati or Krsna and Radha,—and it is only when such a realisation is perfect that they become entitled to realise the Sahaja through their intense mutual love. This realisation of the true nature of man as Krsna and that of woman as Radha is technically known as the principle of aropa or the attribution of divinity to man. Through continual psychological discipline man and woman must first of all completely forget their lower animal-selves and attribute Krsnahood to man and Radhahood to woman. Through this process of attribution there will gradually dawn the realisation of the true nature of the two as Krsna and Radha. When man and woman can thus realise themselves as Krsna and Radha in their true nature, the love that exists between them transcends the category of gross sensuality,—it becomes love divine, and the realisation of such an emotion of love is realisation of the Sahaja.1 Cf. paraapar nayak nayikfi anariga rati Isatasiddha bhave hay brajete basati (IRati-vilasa-paddhati, MS.

The Sahajiyas are deadly against the principle of denying the value of life on earth andundervaluing our human love. The gross physical formwith all its charm and beauty is as real as our spiritualexistence, for it is this chaim of physical beauty,—themaddening passion, which we call human love, that leads us gradually to a new region where we can find a glimpse1 Cf. chaji jap tap sadhaha dropekata k^riyU mane IRsggtmika songs, ascribed to Candidas, Mr. Eose’s edition.

The spiritual existence of man in divine love does not mean the negation of human love,—:it is this human love, beginning in the form of carnal desires and progressing gradually through a process of continual physical and psychological discipline towards an emotion of supreme No categorical dis- bliss, boundless and unfathomable in extent“ d depth, that itself becomes the love lov<5, divine—the highest spiritual gain. Thereis no categorical distinction in kind between human love and divine love ;—it is human love, transformed by strict physical and psychological discipline, that becomes divine. Divine love is rather an emergence from the carnal desires of man as the full-blown lotus, with, all its beauty and grandeur above the surface of water, is an emergence from the mud lying much below. Here there is a difference of outlook among the Sahajiyas and the standard Vaisnavas of Bengal. Krsnadas Kaviraj has unambiguously declared in the Caitanya- Caritamrta that kama (love in its grosser aspect) and prema (divine love) are characteristically distinct in their nature like iron and gold, and while the keynote of tyima is the fulfilment of selfish desires, the keynote of prema is self­elimination and the fulfilment of the divine desires in and through our whole being. But the Sahajiyas, while agreeing to the latter part of the statement, do not agree to the former part of it. The same flow of emotion, they hold, that becomes kama in association with the selfish desires, trans­forms itself into prema when dissociated from such desires through physical and psychological discipline. Prema is but the purified form of \\ama, and as such the former has its origin in the latter.1 There cannot be prema without1 s e it a u jja l r a h e r a s e d h a k fl a h g a I fefim h a i t e j a r m m e p r e m n a h e kG m a- s a n g a II la u h a k fi kja ra ye s o n a l a u h a p a r a s iy S I t a i c h e k a m h a i t e p r e m d e k h a bicS ria II p a r a s e t g u n irista ( i r e t f a , s i c ) t a h e la u h a h e m ! hfirrxer k a fh in g u n p a r a n t e p r e m II f a m a - b a s t u c a n d r a -k a n tt p a r a s p S th a r I p r e m a - b a a i u s u k h a m a yTHE VAISNAVA SAHAJIYA CULT , 157• •"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"158'OBSCURE RELIGIOUS CULTSk.Gma, &nd hence, pretna cannot be .Attained through the absolute negation of I^ama ; it is to be attained rather through the transformation of kama. The prema of the Sahajiyas is not the emotion of the most intense devotion of man towards God,—it is the most intense emotion of love existing between Krsna and Radha residing as the Svarupa in the Rupa of every man and woman. It is from this point of view that Candidas exclaimed,—“ Harken men, my brothers, man is the truth above all truths,—there is nothing above that.” In another song of the Sahajiyas we find,—Humanity is the essence of divinity,—and man becomes God in the strength of his love; man is the highest in the world, for it is only he who revels in supreme love.1 The religion of the Vaisnava Sahajiyas was thus a religion of humanity. The Sahajiyas have no gods or God other than man. Even Radha and Krsna are never regarded as deities to be worshipped,—they represent principles to be realised in humanity. Humanity itself is thus viewed from a sublime perspective.What is then the real significance of the Aropa ofthe Sahajiyas ?

The Sadharani Rati or the most ordinary Rati is the woman who is inspired in love-union only with the desire of self-satisfaction,—and Kubja represents a Rati of this class. The Sahajiyas accepted this classification of Ratis and according to them the SamarthQ Rati is the only Rati suited for the culture of love.The Sahajiyas lay stringent conditions regarding thepractice of love. It has frequently been said that for theattainment of true love a man must become dead first of all,—dead in the sense that the animal in him must be eradicated,giving scope for full play to the divine in him; in plainerwords, his body and mind must be placed above even thepossibility of susceptibility to the lower animal instincts andmust be imbued through and through with the radiant glowof his Svarupa. This strictness has also been frequentlyemphasised by the condition that a man must do completelyaway with his nature as a man and transform his nature tothat of a woman before he takes the vow of love. Herealso the emphasis is really on the total transformation of theordinary attitude of man towards a woman. *The stringency of Sahaja-sadhana and the great danger sure to result from the slightest deviation have been repeatedly sung by the Sahajiya poets in enigmatic state­ments.

It is for this reason that three stages have been marked in the course of Sadhana, Viz., Pravarta, or the stage of the beginner; Sadhaka, i.e., an advanced stage,—and Siddha or the perfect stage. Closely associated with these three stages of Sadhana are the five Asrayas (Refuges), viz., Nama (divine name), Mantra, Bhava (divine emotion), Prema (love) and Rasa (bliss). Nama and Mantra are associated with the stage of -Pravarta, Bhava with the second stage of Sadhana and Prema and Rasa are associated with the third stage of Siddha. 2 It has been repeatedly enjoined that the Sadhana in company of a woman can be entered upon only in the Sadhaka stage and real love can be realised only in the perfect stage and never before. In the question of perfection equal stress is laid on the per­fection of body as on the perfection of mind; for, the Sahaja can never be realised without a perfect body.8 Herein comesA g a i n ,sa m u d re paU va n ire na titivanahi du h kh a su kh a f c / e $ IIS o n g a s c r i b e d t o C a n d i d a s .1 sS per m u k h e te h h ek ere nacavita v e ta raaik-raj II y e ja n catu r su m eru Sikharsutay g a th ite pare I m akasara jale m at ah g a ba n d h ilee ras m ila ye tare IIS o n g a s c r i b e d t o C a n d i d S s .* V id e A ira ya -n irn a y a, M S .

Any attempt at the culture of love without being conversant with the secrets of Yogic practices will lead not only to failure, but to extremely direful results. The ideal love of the Vaisnava Sahajiyas can be realised only in a perfectly purified body and mind, whence all the principles of defile-_ iment are absolutely eradicated. This state has been said to be the state of Visuddha-sattva. By the purification of body and mind there is first the subsidence of the elements of Tamas (inertia) and Rajas (energy) and there is the predomi­nance of the element of Sattva (intelligence-stuff); but even above the state of Sattva is the state of saddha-sattva (or pure intelligence-stuff); and by further purification Suddha- sattva is transformed into Visuddha-sattva. This state of Visuddha-sattva is a transcendental state where there is neither the natural nor the supra-natural,—and pure love is possible only in such a state.1For the realisation of the ultimate nature as pure love the lover and the beloved must be identical physically, mentally and spiritually; they must be of one body, one mind and one soul.

The realisation of the Sahaja-nature of the not-self, they contend, follows from the realisation of the Sahaja-nature of the self.1 The Sahaja (of the nature of supreme love) that underlies the self as its ultimate reality, underlies also the not-self,—and both the self and the not-self are mere transformations of the same Sahaja, the plurality of objects with all their differences owes its origin only to the illusory nature of our sense-percep- tions.2 The duality of self and external objects is said to be due to a mere confusion of the senses, and it exists only as long as there is no attainment of self-knowledge. The senses are playing with the objects; but in reality the objects and the self are one and the same in their ultimate nature. When knowledge of the self dawns on man any differentia­tion like this and that becomes impossible,—and at that time, there is not the least cognition of duality and the whole universe is realised as of the nature of the self.a Thus it is contended that the realisation of the Sahaja-nature of the self as pure love automatically leads one also to the realisation of the ultimate nature of the external world.In the Tantras we find that the world proceeds from the bliss which is the cessation of all duality and which is the nature of the ultimate reality, it has been said in the Upanisad,—“ Bliss (ananda) is to be known as Brahman, and from bliss proceeds all the objects, and through bliss they live and in bliss do they return and merge.” 4 tWe find1 apart janaye jei jagat janay I jagater jan tar anta nahi pay IIRatna-sara, M S .

The Vaisnava Sahajiyas have always mixed up this psychological principle with the theo­logical speculations of Bengal Vaisnavism, and the ideal of Paraklya love in the human sphere has generally been sought to be associated with an ontological significance. But apart from the ontological significance attached to the ideal of Paraklya love let us see if some religious significance can pertain to such a kind of love even from the purely psycho­logical point of view. From this psychological point of view it may be said that human love, when dissociated completely from selfish carnal desires, not by a process of violent suppression, but by a slow and gradual process of strict physical and psychological discipline, has the capacity, in its boundless extent and deep intensity, of producing a trans­cendental state of mind, which is of the same kind as theMost intense love state m*ncl produced through the highest produces a state of state of divine love, or communion witharrest.God. We have said before that the arrest of the states and processes of the mind plays the most impor­tant part in almost all the religious systems of India.

This is the state of Samarasa after which all the esoteric schools of yoga aspired. The Tantrics of Hindu as well as of Buddhist schools would often recommend the attainment of such a state of mind through the attainment of intense bliss by a strictly yogic regulation of the sex-act, while the Vaisnava Sahajiyas added the psycho­logical element of love to it. The final aim, however, in all such cases was the attainment of an infinitely blissful state of arrest either purely through a psyco-physiological process of yoga or through the intense emotion of love.The fundamental principle of the esoteric schools, men­tioned above, is that man can never get rid of his sex-Repression of sex propensities even by a life-long struggle of replaced by the Saha- rigorous suppression,—nay, as we havejiyfis by sublimation.' seen, it is in the form of Samarasa orMahasukha or Mahabhava the ultimate nature of our whole being—the ultimate reality from which the world evolves. In the grossest sexual pleasure we have the lowest kind of realisation of the same kind of bliss which follows the reali­sation of the ultimate reality. It is, therefore, foolish to try to do absolutely away with this fundamental nature of man; the best thing, on the other hand, will be to eliminate the element of grossness from it through physical and psychologi­cal discipline.This theory of the esoteric schools involving the element of sex in religion, may be made subject to severe criticism from the Freudian point of view of modern psycho-analysis,— and there is much scope for such criticism particularly in the field of Vaisnava Sahajiya cult with all its theory of love,human and divine.

(Spanda- Karima) says that for the realisation of the self as the Siva one has to make his mind absolutely motionless,— the absolutely motionless state of mind is liberation.8 When the self passes on from its- active state of the doer and the knower to its absolutely motionless inactive state, it is no more disturbed by the pernicious memory (ku-smrti) of its past active states; but by passing into the inactive motionless state the self does not lose its nature as the ultimate subject. It is said that two states of the self can be distinguished, viz., the state of pure agency (kartrtoa) and the state of being the effect (fyaryatva). Of the two states the state of being the effect is capable of being destroyed, but the agent is indestructible.

This flow of pure emotion, which is not determined by any quality whatsoever, is the pure nature of the self.In the Vijfiana-bhairava we find corroboration of what is stated in the Spanda-pradipika. There it is said that to attain the state of Bhairava, or rather to realise the ultimate nature of the self, one has to realise the ultimate nature of the self and of objects as pure consciousness bereft of all waves of mentation. But how to attain such a state of Bhairava ? The Vijnana-bhairava enjoins that such a state may be attained through a state of arrest produced by any intense emotion or even sensation. Just as after the ringing of a bell the main sound dies out leaving behind a continuous unquali­fied lingering vibration, so also after the mind is deeply disturbed by a strong emotion (like the sex-emotion), there follows a flow of unqualified lingering emotion, and that oneness of emotion becomes to the Sadhaka as of the same nature as the unqualified bliss resulting from the realisation of the self.2 Through kissing and embracing of woman there follows an over-flood of joy which proceeds from within and amounts to the bliss of self-realisation.

But as this view is closely associated with the question of a state of arrest, which is so much emphasised in the Patanjala system of yoga, it will not be unfair to make some comment on it from the yoga point of view.The exponents of yoga have admitted the fact that it may be possible to attain a state of arrest even through some strong sensation or emotion; but that kind of arrest of mind is very transitory and as such falls far short of the final state of Samadhi. Samadhi of yoga proper does not mean a temporary arrest of mind,—it means a permanent state of arrest which removes all our afflictions and which eradicates all mental complexes and root-instincts that serve as the seed of the future recurrence of life and suffering.In the yoga scheme of psychology there have been recognised five planes of mind, which are technically known as the five citta-bhumis. These are, (1) ksipta, (2) mudha, (3) Viksipta, (4) ekflgra and (5) niruddha.

The second state is the state in which mind, under the sway of some strong sensation or emotion, lies infatuated, as it were. In this state there is the excess of the tamas (i.e., the gross material stuff) and under the sway of the tamas mind falls asleep, or, swooning, as it were. The third state is the state of Viksipta, which is distinguished from the k?ipta state by the possibility therein of temporary arrest of the mental states. It is the momentary steadiness that the mind may have amidst its unsteady changes. The other two states are e\\agra (one-pointed) and niruddha (perfectly arrested). Of these two the e\\agra state has been explained by Vacaspati in his commentary as eka-tana, which literally means ‘one-tuned,’ i.e., the state where all the mental states attain an oneness in deep concentration on some particular object of meditation. This e\\agra state leads to the next state which is the state of final arrest (niruddha).Now of the five planes (bhumt) of the mind only the last two are recognised as the planes of yoga proper. Temporary arrest may be possible in the mudha and viksipta planes also,—but they cannot be recognised as states of yoga as there is the possibility of their relapse to ordinary active states at any moment. The important thing in yoga proper is not therefore somehow to attain a state of arrest, but to well- prepare the planes of mind for Samadhi. If the plane be well-prepared even active states cannot disturb the mind.If we examine the states of Samadhi described particularly by the Kasmira-school of Saivism, we shall be tempted to say that many of these states can be classed as the mudha state of mind and only a few of them fall within the state of ekagra.

Instates of great hunger, anger, jealousy, fear, curiosity, sex-passions, etc., there may be a temporary sleep of the ordinary mental states and processes,—but they being outside the plane of yoga may at any time relapse into acti­vity, and for this reason such states should never be confused with the final state of Samadhi.To judge the state of Samarasa of the Tantriks or of Maha-sukha of the Buddhist Sahajiyas, or the state of supreme love of the Vaisnava Sahajiyas, we should first of all examine the citta-bhumi in which such a realisation is possible. If the realisation be in any of the first three planes of the citta, i.e., if it be a mere state of sleep of the senses, or just like a state of swoon of a temporary nature then it cannot be recognised as a state of yoga proper. Everything, therefore, depends on the plane of citta. The Tantriks and the Sahajiyas were conscious of this truth and they laid sufficient stress on it. All the stringent conditions laid by the Tantriks and the Sahajiyas for the esoteric practice may be viewed from the yoga point of view as conditions for a proper plane of citta where the absorption of the psychical processes may amount to a state of Samadhi. Whenever the esoteric prac­tice is resorted to in a lower plane the result produced must be dangerous; it is for this reason that the Sahajiyas repeated­ly declared that a real Sahajiya Sadhaka is rarely found even among crores (kptike Sotik hay)."},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"CHAPTER VIITh e^Jauls o f Bengal (f) General Nature of the Baul SectFar from the empty noise and busy bustle of urban life, flourished in the villages of Bengal an order of singers, still extant,—an institution of immense literary and religious interest; for, the songs of these bards are as much noted for their naivete and spontaneity of expression as for the spiritual intensity of their content.

Finally, the earlier Sahajiyas conceived of the ultimate reality as the Sahaja and this conception of the Sahaja is also found in the songs of the Bauls; and like the earlier Sahajiyas the Bauls also advocate the most natural path for the realisationof this Sahaja-nature.But the earlier Sahajiya cult underwent a notable trans­formation in the hands of the Bauls; for, the Bauls, by deviation and innovation, effected a great change both in the ideology and practice of the Sahajiyas. The difference in ideology is palpable in the conception of Sahaja. The Buddhist Sahajiyas conceived Sahaja as Maha-sukha which is the unity of the duality represented by man and woman as Upaya and Prajna. The method for the realisation of this Sahaja consisted, therefore, essentially in a sexo-yogic practice. To this, however, the Vaisnavas supplied the element of love. But here, in the Vaisnava school also, Sahaja was conceived as supreme love which can be realised by the union of Krsna and Radha who reside in the corporeal form of man and woman. The process of Sadhana is also, therefore, a process of the Divinisation of the human love. But we have seen that this love is not the love of the iiature of the most intense yearning of human soul toward^ God, it is the yearning of man for woman, or of woman im man.

The Bauls also speak of love and union, but this love means the love between the human personality and the Divine Beloved within and in this love man realises"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"190OBSCURE RELIGIOUS CULTS| his union with the Divine, or in other words he merges his personal existence in the Beloved that resides within this temple of the body. Great has been the influence of Sufi- ism on the Bauls in the evolution of this new conception of Sahaja and in the difference in their religious approach. But a little penetration into the nature of Sahaja, variously described in the songs and Dohas of the Buddhist Sahajiyas, will show that the germ of such evolution was already there in the ideas of the Buddhist Sahajiyas.

You are beholding your husband (within), and asking for his whereabouts to your neighbours !” 2 These and such other verses will supply us with a clue to the tendency of the Buddhist Sahajiyas of conceiving the Sahaja as a Being, who became gradually transformed into a Personal God with whom it may be possible to have personal relations. This tendency of the earlier Sahajiyas paved i\\c? way for the evolution of the conception of the 4 Man of the heart ’ under the strong sway of Sufi-ism.It may be observed that the literature of the Santa poets of upper, central and northern India also represent, as will be demonstrated later,3 the spirit of Sufi-ism against the background of the earlier Sahajiyas. In this respect the Baul songs of Bengal have the closest affinity with the songs of the mediaeval saints of the other parts of India.

Our present study will also help us in the future study of the cognate literature of the mediaeval saints of other parts of India.1{iii) The Bauls and the Sufis(A) A Brief History of Sufi-ism in India and particularlyin BengalIn all probability Sufi-ism began to make its way in India in the eleventh century A.D. and apostles like Shah Sultan Rumi (who came to Bengal in 1053 A.D.), Sayad Nathar Shah (who carried Sufi-ism to the Deccan for the first time and died there in 1039 A.D.), Makhdum Sayad Ali ’Uluvvi ’al Huzurri (who settled in Lahore) are the preachers of this first period.2 But Sufi-ism as a religious school began to influence the mind of the Indian people on a large scale from the end of the twelfth century and the two orders of Sufi-ism that gained sufficient ground on the soil of India by this time are the Chishti and the Suhrawardi orders. The renowned apostle Khwajah Mu'inu-d-din Chishti, who settled in Delhi in 1193 was the founder of the Chishti Order in India. The Suhrawardi Order was also almost synchro­nously founded by Shyak Baha'u-d-din Dhakriya'r.^ultani (born in Multan in 1169 and died in 1266). These two Sufi-istic orders soon succeeded in attracting a considerable number of Indian people to accept their tenets. Another Sufi-istic Order, viz., the Quadiri Ord^r was introduced and popularised in India during the fifteenth century A.D. by Sayad Muhammad Ghauth Gilani,< who came to India1 Vide Appendix A .2 V ide Vange Suji-prabh&va by Dr. M.

Another Sufi-istic Order was introduced in India by the end of the fifteenth century by Khwajah Muhammad Bakvi Billah, it is the Naqshbandi .Order. Badi’u-d-din Shah-i-Madar founded another important Sufl-istic Order in the fourteenth century A.D., which is known as the Madari Order.The Pantheistic or rather the Panentheistic mysticism of the Upanisads, the devotional mysticism mainly in the Vaisnavite line and the Sahajiya movements offered Sufi-ism a ready field and this will account for the speedy growth and spread of Sufi-istic faith in India. Moreover, from the twelfth century A.D. the history of India represents a history of contact, conflict and compromise-—political, cultural and religious. In this period of contact Sufi-ism, as transformed in India, could very well serve as a medium of compromise and it is this additional possibility that may be held responsible for the wide-spread popularity of the Sufi-istic thoughts.Sufi-ism entered Bengal rather as an overflow from Northern India. There are as many as seven Sufi-istic orders in Bengal, of which the Suhrawardi Order, introduced by Makhdum Shaykh Jalalu’-d-din Tabriyi (death 1125 A D ), seems to be the earliest. The Chishti Order was introduced probably by the North Indian saint Shaykh Faridu’-d-din Shakraganj (death 1269 A.D.). Shah Safiu’- d-dirj>$&ahi (1290? 1295?) of Pandua (in Hughli) was in all probability the first apostle of the Qadadari Order. The Madari Order was perhaps introduced in Bengal by Shah Madar himself as an itinerant mendicant. Another popular Sufi-istic Order of Bengal is the Adhami Order, more popularly known as, the Khidwari branch. The Naqshbandi Order was perhaps ^ introduced first by Shaykh Hamid Danishmand in the seventeenth century. The other Order of Sufi-ism in Bengal is the Qadiri Order, which was intro­duced probably by Abdul Kadir Gilani in the sixteenth192 OBSCURE RELICIOUS CULTS*"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"tH E BAULS OP BENGALCentury.1 We need not enter here into the detailed history of how the Sufi-movement spread with all its branches and sub-branches in Bengal; it will be sufficient for us to know that different orders of Sufi-ism did penetrate into Bengal, and did very easily and promptly recruit large number of converts. The Sufi-istic ideas' that were thus introduced were soon assimilated with the prevalent Sahajiya ideas and the result of this amalgam has been the Bauls of Bengal.(B) Influence of Sufi-ism on the General Nature of Baul Sect(a) The Influence of SamaIn gauging the nature and extent of the influence of Sofl-ism on the Bauls we may observe in the first place that the out-pouring of the heart through songs was an important religious mode with the Bauls; in this we may find on the one hand the influence of Bengal Vaisnavism, which attachedmuch importance to music as a medium of holy comiiu\"'nion, and on the other hand the influence of the Sufl~stlccustom of ‘ Sama * fr.e*, song and dance).2 The effec0^music, the Sufis hold, helps one much in passing into fana, i.e., in passing away of consciousness in mystic ui°n with God.(b) Importance of the MurshidSecondly, we may consider the importance tha£ is laici by the Sufis on Guru-vada.

C. ; the postulation of Sufi influence on this point, therefore, does not seem warrantable. Prediction to such religious practice of Klrtana is also found in the Bhagavata-purana, e .g.,—kftna- varnam tvisa~krW<*™ sahgo-panga-stra-parsadam / yajnaih aamkirtana-prayair yajanti hi aumedhaaah// (11.5 .32, VangavSsi edition).25—141 IB"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"mOBSCURE RELIGIOUS CULTSis ingrained in the religious thoughts of India in general, and how in the spiritual life God has sometimes been re­placed by the Guru. The Sufis laid the same stress on the Murshid or the Shaykh, i.e., the preceptor or spiritual guide. The view of Sufi-ism on this point will be best illustrated if we quote here the view contained in the Awarifu-l-Ma arif. It is said,—“ When he (i.e., the Murid or the disciple) is possessed of manners, he taketh in love a place in the Shaikh’s heart; and is agreeable to God’s sight. Because, with mercy, favour and care, God ever looketh at the hearts of His own friends (the darvishes).“ Thus, by dwelling in the Shaikh’s heart, the constant blessings of God’s mercy and of his endless bounty, com­prehend his existence; and the Shaik’s acceptance becometh his mark of the acceptance of God, Muhammad, and of all Shaikhs.”1In the ‘ Murshida-songs ’ of the Bauls we find a mixture of ^he Indian spirit with the spirit of Sufi-ism. The excellence of the * Murshida-songs ’ of the Bauls consists in their pathos, in their expression of the groaning and the beating heart of the restless aspirers; additional charm hasbeen imparted to the songs by the unconditional self-/*reduction of the Murid or the disciple, who has accepted Jridu-crshid as a sure mast in the boundless heaving sea j-dirAister.'ce,—like a lamp in the abyss of darkness. “ To pnnd fro is tossing my boat with a jingling sound in the 'rough wind,” proceeds the cry from a heart,—\"O my Murshid, yet tat me live in my hope in thee.

In this, as we have said, the background of Sahajiya thought cannot be overlooked; but the influence of Sufi-ism is also not less noteworthy. As essentially a cult of love-mysticism Sufi-ism, inspite of the rites and customs that gradually developed around it, breathes a spirit of heterodoxy in general.

Thus is confirmed the trite saying that “ extreme ^meet.” “ The perfection of a man's state,” says Jami, “ and the utmost degree to which saints may attain, is to be without an attribute, and without a mark.” The most fervent zeal sinks into the coldest indifference about religion.” 1The mystics in all countries are as much opposed to the paraphernalia of practices, rites and customs as to scriptures and speculative literature. The Mystics do not believe in the powers of our discursive reason, which, it is held, is limited by its very nature. It is, therefore, that all attempts to comprehend the ultimate truth through intellectual pursuits are bound by nature to be sadly baffled.2 But though truth cannot be known, it can be intuited or realised within,—it can be realised in the Sahaja (natural) path through the secret coidVaunion of love.

The human body has always been described as the temple of the Dear One.2 In vain, they say, are people mad after going on pilgrimage,— in vain are they searching the Beloved in temples and mosques and in other places. Thus it is said, “The Man of the house is dwelling in the house,—in vain have you become mad by searching Him outside. It is for your own fault that you are v aming about for ever.

Poetically this * Man of the Heart ’ has variously been depicted as the Supreme Beloved, the poet himself being the passionate Iovei. The songs embody throughout the pangs of separation for the ‘ Man of the Heart’ and a maddening desire to be united with Him. This Baul doctrine of divine love naturally brings in the question of its similarity or dissimilarity with the Vaisnava conception of love with which we are familiar in Bengal.

But when we analyse the conception of love, as enunciated in t^e school of Bengal Vaisnavism, it appears that this theory of love is based on a principle of duality, ! theological, if not metaphysical. Theologically the Vaisnavas have conceived some kind of duality between God and the individual (jtva) and this principle of duality brings in the question of devotion, which gradually culminates in the conception of passionate love.

In their theology, however, the conception of dualism prevails, and all poetical and metaphorical descrip­tions of love seem to be based on this theological speculation. But the Baul conception of love is ultimately based on a pantheistic or rather a panentheistic belief, and the dualism is either illusory or metaphorical.The difference between the Baul conception of love and the Vaisnava Sahajiya conception of love is however palpable. The love of the Vaisnava Sahajiyas exists between individual beings as Radha and Krsna, but not between the individual and the Absolute; it is the love between Radha and Krsna that ultimately leads to the realisation of the Absolute. The love of the Bauls is, on the contrary, the love directly between the Sahaja as the ultimate reality on the one hand and the individual on the other. To conform to the emo­tional approach of the Bauls the Sahaja has gradually trans­formed itself into a Personal God, or the Supreme Being with whom it may be possible to have personal relations. The mode of transformation of the conception of Sahaja into"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"THE BAULS OF BENGAL201-a Personal God has already been indicated at the very outset. This Sahaja as the Personal God is the ‘Man of the Heart.’, From this point of view the love-union of the Bauls with the * Man of the Heart ’ really means the realisation of the Sahaja or the ultimate nature of Self. The love, of which we hear so much in the songs of the Bauls, is the love between our human personality and the Divine Personality residing in the human as the true self. The Beloved as the Divine Personality residing in us is our Sahaja-nature, and the lover is the human personality, falsely viewed as separate from this Divine Personality. Love here really implies self-love, the gradual passing away of the human into the Divine.The creed of the Bauls is thus fundamentally based on the question of self-realisation. From the days of Upanisadic mysticism this question of se.f-realisation has been the pivot round which the religious thoughts of India have mainly revolved. The minor religious sects like the different branches of the Sahajiyas are saturated through and through with this Upanisadic spirit of self-realisation. In this spirit, however, Sufi-ism is intimately related to Upanisadic mysti­cism, although the element of love which is conspicuous in Sufi-ism is not stressed in the Upanisads. It is because of this striking similarity in spirit that scholars have often postu­lated influence of Indian thought on the evolution of Sflfl-ism itself. Without entering into the controversy involved in such postulations it may ba said, that the religious contents of Sufi-ism were in no way foreign to the mass-mind of India; it is for this reason that Sufi-ism was very easily acceptable to the masses. But whenever we should discuss the influence of Sufi-ism on the evolution of the minor religious sects like the Bauls of Bengal and the Santa poets of Upper and Northern India we should never lose sight of the Indian back­ground prepared by Upanisadic mysticism and the devotional movements mainly in the Vaisnavite line. The fact seems to2 6 - 1 4 1 I B"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"202OBSCURE RELIGIOUS CULTSBe that the popular composite religious consciousness which was formed by an unconscious admixture of Upanisadic mysticism and the devotional fervour of the Vaisnavas was further modified by the kindred thoughts of Sufi-ism where the spirit of the Upanisads and that of later Vaisnavism are found combined together.Let us now turn our attention to the Sofl-istic conception TL , of the divinity and the ideal of love asI he conception otthe Divinity in Sufi- conceived by the Sufis. The whole ideo- *8m*logy of the Sofl mystics is also shaped and coloured on a Pantheistic or rather a Panentheistic canvas. The creation proceeds from God, the Absolute, as His self- manifested attribute, mode or modification. The sum-total of the manifested attributes of God is the universe. Hallaj, the well-known Sufi poet, who was done to death because of his novel belief of Anal’haqq (i.e., I am the truth), says that “the essence of God’s essence is love. Before the creation God loved Himself in absolute unity and through love revealed Himself to Himself alone. Then, desiring to behold that love-in-aloneness, that love without otherness and duality, as an external object. He brought forth from non-existence an image of Himself, endowed with all His attributes and names. This Divine image is Adam, in and by whom God „ . is made manifest—divinity objectified inCreation proceeds * 'from love. humanity.” 1 We find a very beautifulecho of this Sufi-istic principle in the JfiBna-aagar of Ali- raja.2 There it is said that the Absolute was alone in the beginning; but it could not realise the infinite potency of love that was in it without a dual; in love therefore it created a dual out of its ownself,—and the dual was Muhammad.

Because of this fact that God in His absolute aloneness could not realise His love and a second was required as the beloved, love cannot be realised in the world without there being a pair.1 The - whole universe thus proceeds from the Love of God. Love is the underlying principle of the cosmic process as a whole. The fact has very nicely been put in the JUdna-sagar, mentioned above. It is said there that the universe has its origin in love, and the chaos is systematised into the cosmos through the bond of love. There is love between fire and air, between earth and water; without this love neither heaven, nor earth, nor the nether world would have originated at all. There is love between heaven and the skies, between heaven and earth, between hell and the nether world in which it lies, and thus are the three worlds supported in love.

To put it in another way, the Absolute, having completely realised itself in human nature, returns into itself through the medium of human nature; or more intimately God and man become one in the Perfect Man—the enrap­tured prophet or saint—whose religious function as a media­tor between man and God corresponds to his metaphysical function as a unifying principle by means of which the opposed terms of reality and appearance are harmonised.” 3 It has been said in the Ibnu l-Arabi that “ When God willed in respect of His beautiful names (attributes), which are beyond enumeration, that their essence (a'yan) or if you wish, you may say “His essence *(aynuhu)’—should be seen, He caused them to be seen in a microccsmic being {^awn jami') which, inasmuch as it is endowed with existence, contains the whole object of vision, and through which the inmost1 Jfiana-sagar, p. 2 6 , pp. 33-35.

They are like two birds living in friendly terms on the same tree,—one of them (i.e., Jioalman) tastes the sweet fruit of world-experience, but the other never touches it, but gazes on and on.2 This Divine in us is dearer to us than our son, than wealth—than everything else.8 Immortal becomes the beloved of the mein who adores this inner self as the dearest one.4 That Divine personality is the ear of our ears, eye of our eyes, word of our words, mind of our minds and life of our lives.5 He resides in the heart of man and is to be known in the heart of man.0But while the Upanisads speak of the love between the Divine personality and the human personality more or less metaphorically, the whole emphasis of the Sufis and the Bauls is on love.1 Quoled by Nicholson, loc. c it2 Mun(fakopani$at (3.1.1) ; Sveta0 (4.6).

The element of love is generally associated with elements of yoga in the Baul sect as it is in Sufi-ism. The modus operandi of the Bauls who take to the Sadhana of the ‘four moons’ is essentially yogic. But elements of yoga are resorted to also by the devout Bauls as a process of purification and concentration.(io) Poet Tagore and the Baul songsThe Baul songs, with the ingrained spirit of freedom, the mystic conception of divinity and love and also with the charm of their tune, leading the mind to supreme renunciation and indifference, had strong influence in the evolution of the poetico-religious mind of poet Tagore. Tagore says in The Religion of Man that in his youth he could not harmonise his inner spiritual demands with his relationship with the monotheistic church with which he was closely associated. After a long struggle with the feeling that he was ‘using a mask to hide the living face of truth,’ he severed his connection with the church. “About this time,” says the poet, “one day 1 chanced to hear a songfrom a beggar belonging to the Baul sect of Bengal Whatstruck me in this simple song was a religious expression that was neither grossly concrete, full of crude details, nor meta­physical in its rarefied transcendentalism. At the same time it was alive with an emotional sincerity. It spoke of an intense yearning of the heart for the divine which is in Man and not in the temple, or scriptures, in images and symbols.

One is often surprised to find in many of these verses a striking originality of sentiment and diction; for, at their best, they are spon­taneously individual in their expressions.”1In another place the poet says,—“Those, who have gone through my writings, know that 1 have expressed my love towards the Baul songs in many of my writings. When I was in Silaidaha 1 would frequently meet these Bauls and I had occasion to have discourses with them. I have fitted the tune of the Bauls to many of my songs, and in many other songs the tune of the Bauls has consciously or unconsciously been mixed up with other musical modes and modifications. It will be easily understood from the above that the tune as well as the message of the Bauls had at one time absorbed my mind as if they were its very element.”3The conception of the ‘Man of the heart’, as confessed by Tagore himself, deeply stirred his poetic mind even in his youth. Tagore, with the Upanisadic background of his mind prepared in his early days by his father as well as by the whole environment of his life, naturally tried to assimilate the message of the Bauls with the Upanisadic doctrines.We have indicated in the introduction that through all his songs and poems Tagore sings of an Infinite Being, Who is seeking His self-expression through the whole creative process for self-realisation,—and the best expression of the Divine personality is through the human personality, and throughout the life-process of man there is going on this continual process of love-making between the human and the Divine.

As an All-India reli­gious movement Nathism enjoyed and is still enjoying immense popularity and it influenced the growth of many other modern Indian literatures in the early and the middle periods. The religious and literary history of Nathism in Bengal is, therefore, intimately connected with that of many other provinces of India as also of the Hima­layan regions like Nepal and Tibet. There are many yogic texts in Sanskrit either directly ascribed to the Nath-gurus (mainly to Gorakh-nath), or somehow associated with the cult. The Nath literature in the vernaculars consists mainly of longer narrative poems of the nature of ballads and also stray songs. A general survey of the nature and extent of Nath literature with particular reference to Bengali will be found in the Appendix (B).(i) Origin of the Nath CultThe problem of the origin and development of the Nath cult in India, including the Nath movement of Bengal, is as yet shrouded in the mist of legends and myths. From the heaps of traditional accounts it is possible for us only to form an idea of the extent of popularity which the cult enjoyed and is still enjoying in the soil of India; but no definite history of its origin and development can be constructed with the data that we have at our disposal. We have, however, made it clear on, several occasions that the historical study is not our"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"220OBSCURE RELIGIOUS CULTSprimary concern,—we are rather interested in the religious contents relating to our literature; but as the mythical and semi-historic accounts will help us to a great extent to under­stand the religious nature of the cult, we propose to make here a brief study of them.The Nath cult is essentially a yogic cult; but among the innumerable yogic sects of India the cult is characterised as the Nath cult due mainly to the fact that its stalwarts gene­rally bear the title of ‘Nath’, and the word Nath has been dealt with in some of the standard Sanskrit texts as a philo­sophic concept for a state of supreme existence. Various theories are current among scholars as to the nature and origin of this cult. Some take it to be essentially a crypto- Buddhist or an esoteric Buddhist cult, which later seceded from the Buddhist fold and transformed itself into a Saivite cult. Others, on the other hand, are of opinion that the Nath cult is essentially a Saivite cult, which, in course of its revolution, was assimilated within esoteric Buddhism and it is for this reason that we find in it a hotchpotch of esoteric Buddhism and yogic Saivism. But before indulging in such speculations we should first of all be sure of what the Nath cult stands for. The Nath cult seems to represent a particular phase of the Siddha cult of India. This Siddha cult is a very old religious cult of India with its main emphasis on a psycho­chemical process of yoga, known as the Kaya-sadhana or the culture of body with a view to making it perfect and immuta­ble and thereby attaining an immortal spiritual life.To escape death, as we shall see, was the central point round which grew the details of the Siddha India*Siddfla cuIt of cult, and the Siddhas in general hold“that death may either be put off ad libitum by a special course of restrengthening and revitalising the body so as to put it permanently en rapport with the World of sense, or be ended definitively by dematerialising and spiritualising the body, according to prescription, so that it"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"LEGEND AND HISTORY221disappears in time in a celestial form from the world of sense, and finds its permanent abode in the transcendental glory of God.”1 This Siddha school seems to be closely associated with the Indian school of Rasayana and it is some­times held that the Siddha school was originally based on the theories and practices of the Rasayana school.2 This Rasa­yana school has been accepted as a school of Indian philo­sophy in the Sarva-darsana-samgraha of Sayana-Madhava. The school is styled there as the Rasesoara-darsana and the doctrines of the school are explained with reference to well- known texts on Rasayana. The school is, however, recog­nised here as a Saivite school. Rasayana or alchemy is an ancient science of the pre-Christian origin having immense popularity in different parts of the world. In India, however, instead of being-purely a chemical science, it developed theo­logical speculations and already in fairly old medical texts we find references to the view that siddhi or perfection can be attained by making the body immutable with the help of Rasa (i.e., some chemical substance). There is a popular tradition that the Siddhas were ‘ ‘a band of death-defying theriacal and therapeutic alchemists indebted in all respects to Bhoga, a pre-Christian Taoist immigrant from China, who, in his methods of keying up the body of impure matter through ‘reverberation’ and ‘projection’ to the pitch of practically cancelling demise, merely sought to promulgate the lesser athanasic precepts of Lao-tse, since the vital objec­tive of the Tao-Teh-King is the transfiguration of the immor­talised ethereal body into a permanent garment of celestial virtue, in order to fit it to associate to eternity with the Tao.”81 Videt Tl\\e Doctrinal Culture and Tradition of the Siddhas by Dr. V.

CULTSPatanjali, the great exponent of yoga, who flourished most probably some time b etween the second and the sixth century A.D.,1 says in the Kaivalya-pada of his yoga- aphorism that siddhi can be attained even by the application of herb or medicine (ausadhi).2 In the commentary on this aphorism Vyasa and Vacaspati say that this siddhi by ausadhi refers to the schools of yogins who attained perfection with the help of Rasayana.8 We shall presently see that the Rasa of the Rasayana school was replaced, in the cult of the Nath Siddhas, by the nectar oozing from the moon situated in the Sahasrara and the whole chemical process was changed into a psycho-chemical process of'Hatha-yoga. From the above it seems plausible to hold that the siddha marga evolved gradually from the ancient school of Rasayana. The theory of the Sun and the Moon as expounded by the Nath Siddhas4 and the principle of being immortal by drinking the nectar oozing from the Moon are found explained in the second Brahmana of the Brhad-jabalopanisat:’ Of course the Brhad-jabalopanisat is not one of those Upanisads that are recognised by scholars to be authentic and fairly early in origin, and therefore the occurrence of the principles of the Nath cult in this text may not help us much in ascertaining the exact time when these doctrines were prevalent; but the fact will at least hint at an antiquity of the tradition. What we can be sure of on this point is that the science of Rasayana was accepted much prior to the advent of Patanjali by a section of yogins for the attainment of the immutability of the body and for the attainment of many other supernatural1 See History of Indian Philosophy by Dr. S.

As this is essentially the position held also by the Nath Siddhas, the history of the Nath yogins may be traced back to a period prior to Patanjali.From the above discussions it will be clear that any hypothesis about the possibility of the Nath cult being originally an esoteric Buddhist cult and seceding from Buddhism in course of time to assume a Saivite air is based purely on a misconception of the fundamental nature of the cult. Such a misconception arises also from the reliance on some popular traditions current in Eastern India. In Eastern India, particularly in the Himalayan regions (in Nepal and Tibet), many of the traditions of the Nath Siddhas got mixed up with those of the Buddhist Siddhacaryas. The reason for such a mixture and confusion is not very far to seek. If we analyse and examine the different schools of esoterism, which go by the name of Tantric Buddhism, or Saktaism, or Saivism, Rearms for the mis- we shall find that in their composite practi-crypto-Buddhistic £ cal nature they contain mainly two elements :gin of the Nsth cult. one js paraphernalia of rites andrituals of a heterogeneous nature, which are neither Hjndu nor Buddhistic in origin, but represent a common stock ofheritage to all the popular religious systems of India; the other element is the element of yoga in its various forms, which also is a common heritage. We have hinted before1 that at different periods in the history of Indian religion these paraphernalia of practices together with the various yogic elements got themselves associated with the different schools of Hindu and Buddhist philosophy, giving rise to the different esoteric schools. This fact has been responsible for so much mixture and confusion among the views and practices of these esoteric schools.LEGEND AND HISTORY 2 2 31 Supra, introduction*"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"224OBSCURE REUGIOUS CULTSIf we are to recognise any fundamental philosophy in the Hindu Tantric systems, we should say that it is the philo­sophy of Siva and Sakti with all ontological and cosmological speculations on them ; and we have seen before that all the yogic practices of the Tantric Buddhists have also grown with the fundamental ideology of Prajna and Upaya, which is essentially the same as that of Siva and Sakti.

Vajra-sattva (or rlevajra, or Heruka), whois conceived just as Siva, is the original instructor of all secret yoga. The traditional belief of the Naths is that Adi-nath is the first in the list of the chronology of the Naths,—and all secrets of yoga proceed from him. This Adi-nath is none but Siva of the Hindus', and Buddha, in the form of the Vajra-sattva, of the Buddhists; and as a matter of fact we frequently come across the epithets of ‘Adi- natha’ and ‘Bhuta-natha’ applied to the Vajra-sattva or Hevajra in the Buddhist Tantras as they are frequently applied to Siva in the Hindu Tantras. We have also pointed out that some of the important Buddhist Tantras are introduced as a dialogue between the lord and the compassionate lady just as in many Hindu Tantras, and according to the literary traditions of the Naths also, we find that Matsyendra-nath (the first among the human Gurus) received the secret of yoga in the form of a fish when it was being disclosed to the Goddess in a castle on the KsJroda-sea. The theory of the Sun and the Moon of the Buddhists has correspondences in the Nath cult. It is because of the general similarities of this nature that Tantric Buddhism seems allied to the other yogic sects. The final state of yoga is called the Sahaja state or Sahaja-samadhi1 Cj. sal^alcr pradhain siddha bandiva bhola-nath.

In the two versions of the A kula-oira-tantra1 (authorship attri­buted to Matsyendra-nath) we find a detailed description of the state of Sahaja; there it is defined as a state of perfect equili­brium, which transcends all our perceptual knowledge with positive and negative attributes. In that state of perfect quietude the yogin becomes one with the whole universe and realises a non-dual existence. In such a state “He himself is the goddess, himself the God, himself the disciple, himself the preceptor; he is at once the meditation, the meditator and the divinity (meditated upon).”2 It is very easy to see that this Sahaja is the same as the Sahaja described in the Buddhist Tantras and the Buddhist Dohas and songs. In the vernacular lite­rature of the Nath cult we frequently meet with this concep­tion of Sahaja, particularly in the old Hindi text Gorafyh-bodh and in similar literature of Carpati and other Siddhas.3 In the Hathayoga-pradipika (which is a standard text on Hatha- yoga) we find that the Buddhist theory of the four kinds of Sunya, oiz.,&Qnya, Ati-sunya, Maha-sunya and Sahaja-sflnya (or Sarva-sQnya)4 is associated with the four stages of sound produced through yogic practices.1’ Again, the Nath litera-1 See Kaula-jfiana nirnaya, edited by Dr. P C.

It is found further that in the texts ascribed to the Naths holy places of pilgrimage located within the human organism are described under several categories, viz., Pitha, Upapilha, Ksetra, Upak.setra, Sandoha, etc., and this is the custom also with the Buddhist and the Hindu Tantras.1 As for the technical yoga terminology, it can be said that they have been common to all the esoteric yogic schools.The most important thing common to all schools of eso- terism is the culture of the body or Kaya-sadhana through the processes of Hatha-yoga. We have seen before that though Kaya-sadhana was not the final aim of the Buddhist and the Vaisnava Sahajiyas, the process of Kaya-sadhana was regarded in both the sects as an indispensable accessory for the realisa­tion of the Sahaja-nature as supreme bliss or supreme love.The fact of such a similarity and mixture has been responsible for the frequent association of• J o f t h T N s l h c u l lite the Nath cult with the cult of the TantricBuddhists in myths and legends. But judging from the literary records and the legends and tradi­tions still prevalent among the yogins of the Nath order it appears that the Nath cult has grown with a general air of Saivism. It is noticeable that not only is there the tradition of Mahadeva or Siva being the original instructor of the cult, but that Gorakh-nath, the most renowned and most impor­tant yogin of the sect, has frequently been identified with Siva or deified as such. The deity of the cult, where tradi­tional or iconographic record of the deity is available, is found to be Siva; the places of pilgrimage of the yogins of this order2 are generally of Saivite importance and the temples there often contain an image of Siva or the phallic symbol of the1 Vide, Kaala-jnana-nirnaya, introduction, p. 57.* For detailed descriptions of such plac *««ee Briggs, Chs.

It is also noticeable that in the Vallala-carita the priests of the Yogi caste of Bengal have been spoken of as rudraja brahmana (i.e., Brahmins deriving their origin from Rudra or Siva),—and as a matter of fact the Yogis of Bengal even in the present day speak of themselves as belonging to the iSiva-gotra (i.e., the Siva-lineage).2But inspite of all these, the general similarity in tone and practice has been responsible for the confused identifica­tion of the later Buddhist apostles with the Nath yogins, and it may be probably for this reason that Matsyendra-nath, who is taken to be the first of the human exponents of the Nath cult, has been deified in Nepal as Avalokitesvara, and even at the present day the Buddhists of that land hold annual procession in honour of the deified Matsyendra-nath.It is also perhaps for this reason thatConfusion about the . , . 1 • • 1 -r i t - iNsth Siddhas and M atsyen dra-nath is id en tih ed in lib e t a nthe Buddhist Siddha- . • •,i j • _ / i • icsryas. traditions w ith L ui-pa (or L u y i-p a ), w h ois generally taken to be the first among the Buddhist Siddhacaryas.1 In the Sanskrit commentary on the Carya-song No. 21 we find a quotation of a few lines1 As a typical instance we may cite the following description of Hidipha or JilandharipS in the version of the Gopi-candrer Sannyas by Sukur Mahammad :— takhane aniya dila siddker jhuti II sooa hucla siddha haste kart nila I S006 man dhutrar phal tathe mi&aila II sooa man fcacId. siddha ekfltra kariy& I m u kh e tale dila nath iiva nam liya II(C.

Sastri, flourished some time before the Buddhist Siddhacaryas) also composed Bengali songs exactly in the manner of the songs of the Buddhist Siddhacaryas. The hazardous leap involved in the inference of MM. Sastrl seems to be too long to justify his inference. Of course, we have already seen that many Sanskrit texts and Hindi texts are ascribed to Gorakh-nath, who has even been recognised as the first prose-writer in Hindi (or Panjabi),2 but we cannot be sure that the heap of literature (either in Sanskrit or vernacular) ascribed to Gorakh are not spurious texts, somehow belonging to the Gorakh sect and bearing traditional traces of some of the doctrines of the cult.The general similarity among the esoteric yogic sects of the later Buddhists and the Saivites seems to be responsible also for the tradition that many of the Siddhas of the Nath cult, including the most renowned Gorakh-nath, hailed from the Buddhist fold as seceders. According to the evidence of Taranath the name of Gorakh-nath, when he belonged to the Buddhist fold, was Ananga-vajra. MM. Sastrl says that the Buddhist name of Gorakh-nath was Ramana- vajra.3 It is said that the Nepalese Buddhists are much displeased with Gorakh-nath and hate him as a seceder.4 In the index of the Pag Sam Jon Zang Mr. S.

We may note here also the queer suggestion about the identification of Gorakh with Arya Asariga, or even with Nagarjuna, the well known Buddhist scholar. 2 Whatever might have been the history of the origin and development of the Nath cult and the cult of the Buddhist Siddhacaryas, the fact is that Mina-nath, Matsyendra-nath,a Goraksa-nath, Jalandhar! and Caurarigi- nath, who are the most prominent among the Naths, were all included in the list of the Buddhist Siddhacaryas and were sometimes credited with some works on esoteric Buddhism, which were translated into Tibetan.Dr. B.

The Ajlvikas v^ere indeed wandering saints, who would often have recourse to some of the important Hatha-yogic practices; but these Hatha-yogic practices were no monopoly of any particular religious sect; they were and still are important factors in the practical aspect of many of the Indian religious systems. It is a particular theological system growing round these important Hatha-yogic practices that have given a distinctiveness to Nathism as a religious sect. The tenets of the Ajivikas are not yet clearly known ; but as far as they are known, they do not seem to represent any close resemblance with the speculations of the Nath Siddhas.The similarity in the tradition of three supreme personali­ties, of which Dr. Barua speaks, is indeed noticeable, and the tradition of the Tri-nathas is still current in many parts"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"LEGEND AND HISTORY2 3 1of East-Bengal and North-Bengal and there are still extant religious functions which are generally accompanied by popular songs in honour of the Tri-nathas. In these functions, however, the Tri-nathas have frankly become the trinity.1 About the second point we beg to say that though we find that Goraksa-nath transformed himself through his yogic power into a dancing girl and rescued his preceptor from the country of Kadali by dancing and singing,—that seems to have been a mere trick to enter into the country of women, and as such need not be recognised to be any important religious mode of the Naths. Of course the episode of the captivity of Mina-nath in the land of Kadali and his rescue by Goraksa may allegorically be interpreted as the bondage of the human soul 2 through worldly pleasure and its redemption through practices of yoga, and in that case the dancing and singing of Goraksa in the form of the dancing girl may be held important as a religious function ; but from a study of the fundamental tenets or the yogic practices of the Naths it does not seem to be the fact that dancing and singing were any important function of religious expression with the Nath yogins. Many Kanphat yogins Eire, however, found begging from door to door singing songs,—but this singing seems to be simply the profession of a beggar—and nothing more. About the third point we may note that the number eighty-four, as we shall presently see, was held to be a mystic number not only by the Naths, but by various other schools and we find enough of it in1 The present writer may speak of one function in honour of the Tri-natha in some parts of East-Bengal. The function is known as Tennather Mela (the congregation of the three Naths) and is generally held with the purpose of preventing some family calamity and of gaining prosperity for the family or for an individual. In the function, however, the three Naths are confusedly identified with the trinity, viz., Brahma, Vifnu and Siva and three pipes of Gaiija are offered to them, which are then smoked.

The fourth and fifth points are noteworthy inasmuch as the Ajivikas like the Nathas were wandering yogins who emphasised processes of Hatha-yoga and were also great ascetics. The sixth point is not, however, clear to us.(it) Traditions of the eighty-four Siddhas and the nine NathasAll yogins, who have attained perfection in the practice of yoga, ware honoured with the general epithet of Siddha, or Siddha (as in the vernacular). The Buddhist Sahajiya yogins of much renown are commonly known as the Siddhacaryas and the apostles among the Natha yogins are also called Siddhas; it is for this reason that there has been a popular confusion of the Buddhist Siddha­caryas and the Natha yogins in the chronology of the Siddhas. Through such a confused amalgamation has arisen the tradition of the eighty-four Siddhas. In the lists available we shall find that some of the Buddhist Siddha­caryas and Natha yogins have been included indiscriminately. This tradition of the eighty-four Siddhas is very important inasmuch as the tradition is found frequently mentioned in the vernacular literature of different periods.

The mystic nature of the number eighty-four will also appear from the fact that the commonly accepted number of the yogic postures (asana) is said to be eighty-four in the Yogic and Tantric texts; and it has some­times been held that the number of the yogic postures are eighty-four million because of the fact that the number of the different stages in the evolution of a creature is eighty-four million,1—and of these eighty-four million only eighty-four are prominent, and so they are described in detail. As a matter of fact, we do not find even these eighty-four Asanas described anywhere, only a few of them being described in the Yogic and Tantric literature. We may also note that sometimes the number of the beads in the rosary of a Kanphat yogin is also eighty-four. In the Skanda-purana wehave detailed description of the eighty-four Siva-lingas (i.e. phallic symbols of lord Siva) in eighty-four consecutive chapters.2 All these taken together will convince one of the mystic nature of the number eighty-four, and this will justify the doubt about the historical nature of the tradition of the eighty-four Siddhas.Side by side with the tradition of the eighty-four Siddhas we find the tradition of the nine Nathas.8 In the ceremoniesThe tradition of the on the occasion of the initiation into the nine Nitha*. order of Kanphat yogins there is the1 Gorak$a-paddhati (verse 8) ; Gorakfa-aaiflhita (verse 7); Gheranda-aamhita (2. 1-2) etc.; Sundara-dasa (Sundara-granthaVaft, Vol, I, p. 41).2 Skanda-purana, Avantya-khanda, Caturaiiti-lihga-mahatmya.3 *The sixty-four yoginis, the fifty-two heroes, the six ascetics, the eighty-fou, Siddhas, the nine Naths, paid homage (to Nanak)’—Janam-aakhi of Bsbs Nanak— Trumpp, prefatory remarks, p. vii.Cf. also :—‘By having heard (his name) the Siddhas, Pirs, Gods and Naths(have been made),*—Japat 9, Trumpp.'Remembering that name the nine Naths of spotless emancipation, Sanak and the others were saved.To which being attached the eighty-four Siddhas and Buddhas (and) Ambarikcrossed the water of existence;*—Panegyric of Amardaat Trumpp, p. 700."},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"LEGEND AND HISTORY2 3 7ctlstom of worshipping the nine Nathas and the eighty-four Siddhas.1 But even in this tradition of the nine Nathas, there is no agreement among the lists, and all sorts of mythical accounts are found concerning them. In the Sodasa-nitya- tantra quoted in the Gora\\sa-siddhanta-samgraha we find mention of the nine Nathas who are said to have preached the Tantras in the different ages. In the Tantra- maharnaOa (quoted in the same text) eight Nathas are said to be residing in the eight directions and one in the centre. These Nathas are Goraksa-natha in the east (resid­ing in the forest of Jagannatha ?), Jalandhara in the northern region (Uttara-patha, in a forest near Jvala-mukhl ?), Nagar- juna (in a forest near Godavari in the south ?), Dattatreya in the west (to the west of the river Sarasvatl ?), Devadatta in the South-West, Jada Bharata in the North-West, Adi- natha in the land of Kuruksetra in the Midland and Matsyendra-natha in the South-East in a land near the sea- coast.3 We notice further that the Kapalika-school was introduced by the Nathas and there are twelve personalities, to whom was revealed the truth of this school. They are, Adi-natha, Anadi, Kala, Vaikalika, KaraJa, Vikarala, Maha- kala, Kala-bhairava-natha, Vatuka, Bhuta-natha, Vira-natha and SrI-kantha.

Here, however, popular imagination seems to have run riot. It is said that towards the end of the Dvapara- yuga the earth was heavy with sin, and the attention of Mahsdeva, the Lord Sovereign* was drawn to the fact. Moved to pity the Lord at once sent sage Nfirada to BadarikSlrama, where the nine NSrnyanas (who were the sons of Rsabha-rfija) of the name of Kavi-nfirSyapa, Kara-bhijana Na°, Antarlkfa Ns°, Prabuddha Na*, Avirhotri Na°, PippaUyana Na°, Camasa Na°, Hari N«° and Drumila Nfi° were holding discussions on self-knowledge. Nfirada intimated to the NfirCyanas the will of the lord, who would have the NSrayanas come down to the world to preach the secrets of yoga to people so that they may be liberated. The Narayapas went to Vaikuntha to take counsel from Visnu as to how to carry out the will of lord Siva. Visnu, accompanied by the Nsrfiyagas, went to Kailisa to receive instructions from the Lord, and with His instructions the nine NarSyanas incarnated themselves in the form of the nine Nathas, viz., Matsyendra, Goraksa, Gahini, Jvalendra, K5ripa-p5, Carpata, Revana, Bhartr and Gopl-candra.

Patanjali, the great pro­pounder of yoga, who dealt primarily with the psychological aspect of yoga, also devoted a full chapter of the yoga-sutra to the different kinds of supernatural powers (oibhutis) attainable through concetration of mind on different objects or on different centres of the body. The eight supernatural faculties, viz., Anima (the power of becoming as small as an atom), Mahima (the power of becoming big), Laghima (the power of assuming excessive lightness at will), Garima (the power of becoming as heavy as one likes), Prapti (the power of obtaining everything at will), Pra^amya (the power of obtaining all objects of pleasure at will), Uitoa (the power of obtaining supremacy over everything) and Vasitoa (the power of subduing, fascinating or bewitching) are well known in the school of yoga.1 It is held that through the practices of Hatha-yoga “ the gross body begins to acquire something of the nature of the subtle body and to possess something of its relations with the life-energy; that becomes a greater force more powerfully felt and yet capable of a lighter and freer and more resolvable physical actions, powers which culminate in the Hathayogic siddhis or extraordinary powers of garima, mahima anima and laghima.\"1 These powets are generally known as the eight powers of lord Siva himself, who is the lord of yoga.The Natha Siddhas (including MayanSmati, who too was versed in the mystic knowledge of yoga) displayed throughout these eight supernatural powers.

Again, when Gorakh resolved to enter into the country of ICadak in disguise of a Brahmin in order to rescue his Guru, he sent Langa and Maha-langa (two attendants on Gorakh) to Visva-karma asking the latter to supply him at once with a golden sacred thread, a pair of golden ear-rings, golden frontal marks, golden umbrella, stick, etc., and everything was readily and most obediently supplied by Visva-karma.

We may for instance refer to the Gora\\sa-siddhdnta-aatngtaha,1 where we find many orthodox schools severely criticised from the point of view of yoga and there the supremacy of the yoga-school has been established with reference to the texts belonging to various yogic schools.2 In the sixth chapter of the Siddha-siddhanta-paddhati we find description of the real yogin, and in the fifth chapter of the Gora\\sd- samhita we find an elaborate description of the final state of yoga. From these descriptions it will appear that the state of non-duality, bereft of all disturbance of mentation, is the final state of yoga. On this point these yogins will appear homogeneous in spirit with the Buddhist Sahajiya yogins. In the small texts, entitled Amanaska-oioarana and Yoga-btja 3 belonging to the yogic cult of the Siddhas, we find the same spirit of criticism.4 A very faint echo of this voice of yoga literature in general is sometimes found also in Bengali Nltha literature, where the path of yoga is eulogised to king Gopi-cand either by his mother Mayana- mat! or by his Guru Hadi-siddha.61 The text is a compendium of news and views on the yogic cult of Goraksa collected from the Sanskrit texts that are traditionally associated with the cult as embodying the doctrines of the cult.2 Vide, pp. 1-9; 12 et seq; 23-24; 49, 54, etc.Gopl-nfith KavirSja’s edition.Cf. also Kaula jnana nirnaya ascribed to Matsyendra, particuilrly Akula-vlra- tantra included in it.3 The two texts are published in the Vasumatl series of Bengal in a collection of many small yogic texts published under the general caption of Ssstra-iataka.4 Cf.

It is the wild, though sweet, imagination of the uninitiated village poets that is responsible for the growth of so much occultism in the Natha cult at the cost of the truth in the cult which is certainly worth considering. Behind the legends and traditions found in popular poetry we occasionally find glimpses of light, with the help of which we shall try in the following pages to catch at the inner truth of the cult.(if) The final End of the Nstha SiddhasWhat was the final aim of the Natha Siddhas and what was the means (Ssdhand) through which this end was to be attained ? If we are to give the answer in a nutshell, we should say that the final aim of the Natha Siddhas was the attainment of Sivahood in and through the attainment of immortality, and the means of attaining it was primarily Hatha-yoga. The question of escaping death may be taken to be the most salient feature of Hatha-yoga in general as contrasted to the other forms of yoga, viz., Mantra-yoga, Laya-yoga and Raja-yoga. The latter three schools are idealistic in their philosophical outlook and, therefore, lay the greatest emphasis on the final arrest of the mind and the attainment of liberation thereby (liberation from the whirl of coming and going); the emphasis of Hatha-yoga seems to be primarily on the physical or physiological practices which remove disease, decay and death.

In this final state of liberation the Purusa or the * seer ’ remains in his sheer essential nature. This final aim of yoga as the fined arrest of mind has often been admitted also by Hatha-yoga, and in some of the standard texts Hatha-yoga has been made subservient to Raja-yoga (i.e., the yoga par excellence, which is the yoga of meditation);1 but considering the general tone of Hatha-yoga it seems that the very approach of Hatha-yoga was somewhat different from the approach of the other schools of yoga. There is indeed the question of liberation in Hatha-yoga,—but here the conception of libera­tion itself is different from that of the other schools of thought. Liberation here means immortality first in a perfect body (siddha-deha) and then in a divine body (divya-deha), and this is the Siddhi or the perfection after which the Siddhas aspired.The final aim of the Natha Siddhas is Jwan-mtdtfi or, , liberation while living, and this state ofJivan-muliti or 1. immortality in a per- liberation is what is meant by immortality.aim of y \\h eh Natha' While the other schools of thought regardthe final dissolution of the body or its finaldissociation from the spirit indispensable for liberation, theSiddhas seek liberation in a transformed or transmaterialisedbody, which is the perfect body.

The yogins in their perfect body are prompted by the principles of visuddha-maya to benevolent activities rendering spiritual guidance to innumerable religious aspirers,—and this state is the fittest state for becoming a Guru or spiritual preceptor. It is for this reason that the Siddhas are the true preceptors in the world. Further, due to the absolute dissociation of the asuddha-maya these benevolent activities of the Siddhas cannot any more bind them down to the world of suffering. This active state of the Siddha, which helps the religious aspirers of the world on the one hand and evolves its own final state of para-mutyti on the other, may vary well be compared to the Bodhisattvahood of the Buddhists, where there is the principle of activity in the form of universal compassion, which uplifts the suffering beings on the one hand, and, on the other hand, makes the Bodhisattva march forward through the ten stages of Bodhisattva-bhiimi towards the final goal of Buddhahood.In the Yoga-V'ija, a small yogic text, we find that the body is of two kinds, v iz., unripe (apafyva) and ripe (pakva). The unripe body is the body not disciplined by yoga, and the ripe body is the body disciplined by yoga.

Where an ordinary man Jives (in his physical form) the yogin is dead,—and where there is the death for all (in the physical form) there is no death for the yogin. He has no duty of his own,—but at the same time is not defiled by any activity,—he is liberated while living —and is always living in his true body, which is bereft of all defilement.2 A deathless ripe body of this type is the first requisite for a Siddha; for such a ripe body helps the Siddhas in attaining the first slate of Dioya-deha or P a r a - m u ^ t i .It seems that as pre-eminently a Saivite school the aim of the Natha cult was the attainment of Sivahood or the state of Mahesvara.

It is for this reason that in common belief we find great Natha Siddhas like Matsyendra and Gorakh often identified with Siva or Mahesvara. It will not be correct to think therefore that the Natha cult is essentially an atheistic school of alchemy. The real significance of the attainment of immor­tality is the attainment of the state of the Great Lord.The legendary accounts, given in the Natha literature of the life and activities of the Natha Siddhas, including king Gopl-cand s mother Mayanamal! and king Gopl-cand him* self, will corroborate our statement on the final aim of the Natha yogins and their general religious attitude.

In the Gorak§a-vijaya or the Mma-cetana we find that when Gorakh heard from Kanu-pa of the captivity of his Guru Mina-nath in the land of Kadali in the hands of wicked women, he took Up his mystic bag of cloth (siddha-jhuli), put on his loose garment and the pair of wooden sandals, held his staff in hand and at once entered the city of Yama. Yama was seated on his throne in the open assembly and at the sight pf Gorakh he rose from his seat in reverence and humbly"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"THE RELIGION OF THE NATHA SIDDHAS2 5 5enquired about the cause of his (Gorakh’s) sudden visit to the city of the dead. Gorakh took Yama severly to task for summoning his Guru Mina-nath and thus poking his (Yama’s) nose in the affairs of the immortal Siddhas. Gorakh further remarked that if Yama would have the audacity of meddling with the affairs of the Siddhas he (Gorakh) would drag him (Yama) to Brahma himself and let him (Yama) learn from Brahma the exact limitations of his capacity. Gorakh rebuked Yama strongly in a high spirit, threatened him with an immediate order of dismissal and the ruin of his capital; and as a matter of fact when Gorakh stood up angrily with his hanging bag and loose garment of patched cloth and began to utter the Humkara, Yama began to tremble with his whole kingdom. Yama got afraid, felt helpless and immediately lay before Gorakh all the files of official records; Gorakh examined them one by one, picked up the file containing the decree on his Guru,— effaced the name of his Guru from the list of the dead, upset the decree of Yama and then left the city with a strict warning.1The story of the fall of Mina-nSth among the women of Kadali signifies that worldly enjoyment in the form of the satisfaction of carnal desires leads a man to disease and decay; and death in that case becomes the inevitable catas­trophe of the drama of life. The self-oblivion of Mina-nath symbolises man’s oblivion of his true immortal nature;— and the charms of Kadali represents the snares of life. What was repeatedly emphasised by Gorakh in his enigmatic songs in the guise of the dancing girl to recall his self-forgotten Guru to his true judgment\", is that the life of pleasure in company of beautiful women leads to the inevitable end of death, while the only way of escaping death and being immortal even in this very life and body is to have recourse1 Goraksa-vijaya, p p . 45-48."},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"2 5 6OBSCURE RELIGIOUS CULTSto the path of yoga.3 This is the cardinal truth which Mlna-nath, inspite of all his former Sadhana, lost sight of through the curse of goddess Durga, the curse symbolising the eternal curse of Nescience on humanity : and this is the cardinal truth which wa3 variously explained through various imageries by the worthy disciple Gorakh to his Guru. In his songs as the dancing girl Gorakh repeatedly pointed out that the Guru was going to die a most ordinary death in the company of women; he (Gorakh) therefore urged him to have recourse to the yogic processes of making the body perfect, which has been spoken as Kaya-sadhana2 or the cultivation of the body through the processes of yoga.

There we find that when Mayanamati came to know that due to the spells employed by the subjects of the king through the practice of some malevolent Tantric rites king Manik- candra was about to fall a prey to Death, she hastened to the kingdom and asked the king to learn Mahajfiana (i.e., the secrets of yoga) from her, which, she repeatedly assured, would enable him to defy the decree of Death; but the king declined and as a result he met with the ordinary mortal end. It has been said that the disregard of Mahajfiana was the plea for Yama for extending his hands on to the king.2 However, after the death of the king Yama sent one of his officers with summons to bring the life (jiu = jioa) of the king; Mayana in her meditation saw the messenger of Yama near the king and offered him a pony in exchange of the life of the king. The next day two officers came, and Mayana bribed them with the life of a maid-servant; on the fourth day came four, who were bribed with the life of Mayana’s brother; on the fifth day again came five officers, and Mayana offered them an amount of five hundred rupees in cash for buying sweet-meats and eating to their heart’s1 tumht feene tara gosafii amhi kenc mari [hena tattva hflha d ev joge joge tari II Goraksa-Vijaya, p. 12.2 Cf. tirir gharer jnan dekhi raja jfian £ai/e hela I ai dinc bhaduya yam pati gyala khySla (I Gopi-candrer Gan (C.U., Part I), p. 12.33—1411B"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"content. But this time Goda-yama, the messenger, would not be satisfied without the life of the king. At this MayanS flew into rage and began to tremble,—she at once muttered within the Maha-mantra, transformed herself through her yogic power into Candi and into Kali with her large sword (kh&&a *= Skt. khadga) and attacked the whole host of the Yamas, caught hold of some of them and belaboured them severely and the Yamas flew away somehow with their lives. Goda- yama (who seems to have been the leader of the party) was in a fix; helpless as he was, he, with his elder brother Avala-yama, went to Siva. With the advice of Siva the Yamas extracted from the king his life in the absence of Mayana who was sent for water and they flew away in the form of golden black-bees. Mayana could know of this from the river and at once pursued Goda-yama and entered the palace of Death. Through her spell all the inhabitants of the palace at once got attacked with severe headache, and some flew away in fear. By her Huvn\\ara Mayana caught hold of Goda-yama, bound him down and began to beat him severely with an iron rod. Goda, however, begged most humbly Mayana's mercy and agreed to give her back the life of her husband, which, Goda said, was kept in the market place. Mayana followed Goda, who somehow managed to slip from her hands and escaped. Goda went straight to the queen of Yama and sought her protection; she took pity on Goda and hid him in a corner covering him with straw; but Mayana could know everything in her meditation and chased him there in the form of a serpent. Goda transformed himself into a mouse, Mayana chased it in the form of lacs of cats; Goda became a pigeon,—Mayana pursued it in the form of innumerable hawks. In this way Goda-yama tried to escape by transforming himself into innumerable beings in land, water and air,—but he did not succeed.

At the instance of his queens, Gopi-cand put Mayana to cruel and direful tests. She was thrown into fire, but even her garment was not stained with smoke; she was drowned in water bound within a bag, but mother Ganga herself came forward to wel­come her in her (Ganga’s) lap; she walked on a bridge made of hair; she walked on the edge of a razor; she was shut up for full seven days and nights within a boiler containing boiling oil, which was being heated from below constantly;1 The story of Mayanamatl's initiation by Gorakh-nSth in her childhood shows that Gorakh was moved at the idea that even a chaste and beautiful girl like MayanS should meet with the same fate as other ordinary mortals, and he then initiated her into the cult of yoga to make her immortal. After her initiation Gorakh declared,—* \"Death himself has now given a written bond (not to extend his hands over Mayana)He further declared that Mayana would never be burnt in fire, drowned in water, pierced through by any weapon; if she should die in the day-time he (Gorakh) would not let the sun go, but would bind him down,—if she should die at home, he would not let Yama go, but bind him down,—if she should die of a cut from a flat sword (khada = a large sacrificial knife), he would bind goddess Candi (who generally bears such a weapon) down,—MayanS would survive even the sun and the moon. taVe jfian hjahe gorakh anadir tattVa I apane jam rSj&e lekhi dila khata II taue jfian kahi dila brahma-jfian buli I jamer sahite raja karila kolakuli I mainamatir name lekha p k e lila p h a riy a I adai ak$ar jfian kahe karna-tale niyS.

In describing the extraordinary yogic power of Hadipa Mayana says to Gopi-cand that whenever Hadipa chances to catch hold of Yama or any of his officers he beats them severely for full eight hours, and there is no escape for Yama from the hands of the Hadi.3 When Gopl- cand accepted Hadipa as his Guru, renounced the world and left the palace with his Guru, the king was unable to keep pace with the Guru in the path through the dense forest, created by the Humkara of the Hadi and he was lagging behind.

After sometimes Hadipa looked back and found the king dead. The yogin flew into fierce rage, ordered all the tigers of the forest to guard the corpse of the king and himself went straight to the'city of the dead, inflicted severe punishment on all, beginning with the king to the lowest of the officer. The king of Death begged his' (Hadipa’s) pardon and promptly ordered his officers to return the life of king Gopl-cand.1 These popular legends are significant. Of course the imagination of the poets has often exaggerated the yogic powers of the Siddhas and put the yogic truths in extremely popular legendary form,—but the truth behind is the truth of immortality attainable through Hatha-yoga.A very important fact to notice in this connection is that the keynote of the story of Gopi-cand’s great renunciation also is the quest of immortality. It was his own mother Mayanamatl, who compelled the king by hook or by crook to leave his loving wives, his boundless wealth and immense power and to take the vow of a Natha-yogin in his budding youth at the age of eighteen. Mayana lamented that she had none else to call her a mother excepting Gopi-cand,—yet she did .insist on (his Gopi-cand’s) becoming the disciple of Hadipa and taking the vow of a yogin, inspite of the stubborn unwillingness of the king and his conspiracy with the queens. What was there in Mayana that dominated over her ordinary motherly affection ? It was the hope of immortality for her only son, who otherwise, in the course of his ordinary life of worldly enjoyment, would have died a premature death at the age of eighteen. She was not by nature a heartless witch,—it was for a higher1 See Gopi-candrer Gan, (C. U. Part J), pp. 202-207.

Though the general conception of the final state as described by the exponents of this school was mainly in the line of the Bhagavad-gita, the ideal of immortality in the Siddha-deha was there.2 We find there instructions on yoga for making the body immutable. 8 The yogic system involving the control over the sun and themoon1 was advised to be adopted for the perfection ofthe body.6Here we may note that though there was a generalsimilarity in the methods adopted by the Natha-yogins, theBuddhist Sahajiyas, the Vaisnava Sahajiyas and the followers of the Nirguna-school of Hindi poetry mainly in the practicesof Kaya-sadhana, yet there were funda-The difference in ' \\ 1 iaim between the mental ditterences in their aims andN a th a sid d h a s a n d the . i ,tl 1_ *1 r 1 lSahajiyas. attitude. 1 hus, while the rormer schoolsheld the realisation of the ultimate natureof the self as well as of the not-self, either in the form of perfect enlightenment, which is great bliss (as in the case of the Buddhists) or in the form of perfect love (as in the case of the Vaisnavas) or as the ‘ Incomprehensible Beloved ’ (as in the Nirguna school of Northern and Western India), to1 Gopi-candrer Pamcall, (C.

The process has frequently been styled in the vernaculars as the Ulta-sadhana, or the regres­sive process 1 and the epithet is doubly significant. The yoga-practices of the Natha Siddhas is Vita or regres­sive, firstly in the sense that it involves yogic processes which give a regressive or upward motion to the whole biological as well as psychological systems which in their ordinary nature possess a downward tendency; and1 ae guru ulatiya yog dhara kflyci tomhar sthir fearanija manira koraha svoran I ulatiya Spana tripini dea je sthana.

We have had several occasions to dwell on the two aspects of the reality under­lying the universal process as a whole; viz., Siva as the noumenal aspect, or pure consciousness and perfect rest and the Sakti as the phenomenal aspect of world-activity—the aspect of change and evolution. As most of the schools of yoga take the body to be the epitome of the universe, and the life-process, including its physical, biological and psychological aspects, to be a microcosm of the world- process, the life-process in the physical body is also believed to possess these two aspects, viz., the Siva aspect of perfect rest in the divine or the perfect body, and the Sakti aspect of activity in the physical body of continual change. Sakti in her ordinary course of phenomenal manifestation leads to change, death and decay—to the whirl of coming and going. The aim of the yogin is to stop this ordinary downward course of Sakti, downward in the sense of a phenomenal manifesta­tion, and to give her, through physical and psychological, or rather physico psychical efforts, an upward motion so that by a regressive process she may once more proceed backward to be united with Siva and be absorbed in the nature of Siva who is the Motionless Immortal Being. According to Tantric and Hatha-yogic belief, we have already seen, the region of the body below the navel is the region of Sakti, while the region above the navel is the region of Siva; the former is called the domain of Pravrtti or activity and change, while the latter is the domain of Nivrtti or rest. It is generally believed that Sakti, or the principle of change, resides coiled as a serpent in the nature of the world-force in the lowest nervous plexus situated just on the lowest extre­mity of the spinal chord, while Sivat the principle of rest, is situated in the Sahasrara or the lotus of thousand petals in2 6 4 OBSCURE RELIGIOUS CULTS*"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"THE RELIGION OF THE NATHA SIDDHASthe head. The Sahasrara and the Muladhara (the highest and the lowest plexuses) are the two poles within which evolves the whole creative process. Yoga consists in the raising of the Sakti from the lowest region of change and activity to the highest region of rest so as to be united with and absorbed in Siva. This union of Siva and Sakti symbolises in the wider sense the stoppage of the ordinary process of becoming and the retrogression of the whole world- process for the attainment of the changeless state of the Immortal Being. How is this retrogression to be effected? By a perfect control over the physical, biological and psychologi­cal processes and by setting a regressive motion in them through slow and gradual processes of yoga;—this is what is meant by the Ulta sadhana. Because of this Ulta nature of the Sadhana, the language of the songs in which the secret of the Sadhana is couched is also generally of a Ulta nature, or extremely paradoxical and enigmatic.1 The process has also been explained under the imagery of proceeding against the current (ujarxa-sadhana)?All spiritual or religious endeavours are processes of Ulta- sadhana in a general sense inasmuch as they give a higher or upward tendency to our lower being. It has been said in a popular Buddhist verse that when an intense thirst is felt within for something higher, the mind becomes no more perturbed by desires, and at that state one is said to be in an upward current.9 We have referred before to the word paravrtii found in Mahayanic texts.

The reason why the path towards pefection is thus concealed by the Lord from the eyes of ordinary creatures is that the possibility of easy access would have made it cheap; the Lord has enhanced the value and the glory of the path by keeping it secret and extremely difficult of access.1 All these seem to be an echo of the well-known Upanisadic saying that by giving the senses an outward tendency and turning them away from the inward truth the Self-created One gave proof of His jealousy, as it were; it is because of this fact that man generally sees what is external, and not that which is within; but wise people there are, who, in quest of life eternal, have inverted their visual power and realised the self in and through a reverse process.2The process of arrest or control of various sorts, which is the most important, function of yoga, is personified in the Bengali texts as ‘Khemai’ (from Skt.

In the Siddha-siddhanta-paddhati (ascribed to Gorakh) we find that the physical body emerges from the collocation of five factors, Viz., Karma (activity), Kama (desire), Candra (the moon), Surya (the sun) and Agni (fire).2 Of these the first two are rather the conditions of the visible body (pinda), while the other three are the primary elements of which the body is made. Of these three again the sun and fire are generally held to be the same. Then the primary elements out of which the visible body is made are reduced to two, viz., the sun and the moon. The moon represents the elements of Rasa or Soma, (i.e., the quintessence in the form of the juice) and the sun is the element of fire, and, therefore, the body is called the product of Agni and Soma. :| Rasa as Soma is the food (upabhogya) while fire as the consumer is the eater (bhokta),4 and through the well-proportioned combination of the consumer and the consumed the whole creation is sustained.

The sun, we have seen, is called Kalagrti or the fire of destruction, and it is also called Rudra (i.e. the Dire One) as opposed to Siva (the All-good One). In the Kaula-jnana-nirnaya this Kalagrti as Rudra is associated with Sakti and is said to be seated in the lower region (Muladhara) within the mouth of the Vadava. It is held that there are seven lower regions called patala and seven upper regions called heaven. Creation lasts as long as the Kalagni remains in the lower region, but when it burns upwards, dissolution starts.1 In the Buddhist Tantras and the Buddhist Sahajiya songs these principles of the sun and the moon have been conceived as the fire-force in the Nirmana-kaya (i.e. the plexus of ‘the body of trans­formation') and as the Bodhi-citta in the Usnisa-kamala respec­tively. The fire-force in the Nirmana-kaya (situated, according to the Buddhists, in the navel region) is described as the goddess Candali. This point has been stated before in details.2The Sadhana of the Hatha-yogins consists, on the whole, in the act of combining the sun with the moon after getting complete mastery over them. Jn describing the yogic power of Hadi-siddha Mayanamati frequently refers to the fact that Hadi-siddha has made the sun and the moon his ear-rings.5 Though the statement is found in our literature only to describe the mythical power of Hadi-siddha, with whom everything impossible became possible, there is a deeper yogic significance behind it.

The idea of the disappearance of the digits of the moon one by one and* the reappearance of the digits in order has given rise to the theory of the Tithis (i.e. the lunar day, or the thirtieth part of a whole lunation^, including the Purnima (full-moon) and the AmaVasya (i.e., the night of the new moon),—the processes of disappearance and reappearance of the digits being represented as the black and the white fortnight.81 mukh-khani chal guru jihva-khani pkal I amar patane jena ycte fcare hal IIucca nlc bhumi-hhani tate bay Ijadi hayc grha-Vasi se bhumi casay II Gorah^o-vijaya, p, 138.Cf. gomamsam bhaksayen nityam pibed amara-Varunim I kulinam tam aham manye itare hula-ghatakph II go-$abdeno'dita jihva tat-praveio hi laluni 1 go-mam&a-bhakscinam tat tu maha-patak.a-riaianam II jihoa-praVeia sambhuta-vahrtino 'ipaditah hholu I candrat sraVati yah sarah sa syad amata-varunl IIGorak$a-paddhati, pp. 38-39 (Bombay edition).2 Rahu is the mythical demon that devouis the moon, which fact is held responsible for the eclipse.3 Cf.

Of course, there is a remarkable difference in the religious attitude, but inspite of all differences in views and the religious approach, the yogic process seems to have been substantially the same. In his religious approach Kabir, with other poets of his school, is known to us more as representing a devotional school of mysticism, characterised by a spirit of heterodoxy, than as a school professing faith in yogic practice; but the fact remainsthat the poems of Kabir and the works ofThe Natha cult and i , r , l * 11 1 rt h e Kabir-panth, many other poets ot this school speak ora system of yogic practice behind their devotional fervour.3 In his work Nirguna school of H ind! poetry Dr. P. D. Barthwal has given an exposition of the yogic practices referred to in the works of this school of poets, and a perusal of the book will convince one of the inherent similarity in yogic practice of this school with that of its predecessors, 0/z., the Natha Siddhas. The theory of the sun and the moon and the question of the secretion of nectar referred to above play the most important part inthese mediaeval schools. It is perhaps because of thissimilarity in yogic Sadhana and the similarity of the general tone of extreme repulsion against women as a class, that the Kabir-panth has traditionally been affiliated with the Gorakhnath and Kabir has been believed to have had met Gorakhpanth and have had religious discourses with him.An important point to note is the difference in thereligious approach as well as in method among the Natha Siddhas on the one hand and the Buddhist Sahajiyas on the other. We have said before that though both the sects were cognate Hatha-yogic sects there is a sharp difference in theprofessed final aim as well as in practices of yoga. The final aim of the Nathas, we have seen, is the attainment of1 S # o In fra, A p p e n d i x ( A ) *"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"THE RELIGION OF THE NATHA SIDDHAS285immortality; while the final goal of the Buddhist Sahajiyas is the attainment of Maha-sukha.

The emphasis of the Nathas is on the yogic process of transubstantiating this corporal body of death and decay,— and the emphasis of the Buddhist Sahajiyas is on the sexo- yogic practice, which transforms the ordinary sex-pleasure to a higher and deeper emotion of bliss. Of course, the Kaya-sadhana of the Nathists is also there in the practices of the Buddhists,1 and we also find occasional references in the Dohas and the Carya songs to the flow of nectar and the process of drinking it by the yogin with the purpose of making the S^andha (the elements, the aggregate of which constitutes the physical body) firm and stable and becoming ajara and amara (diseaseless and deathless); we find occasional references to the drinking of the nectar or the honey of the lotus in the head by the black-bee of the mind, and also to the pouring down of water from the moon of Bodhicitta, full in its sixteen digits, into the fire below. Though in some cases these expressions and imageries may be explained figuratively, yet it appears that the practice of the Buddhists for the realisation of the Maha-sukha was intimately connected with the Kaya-sadhana of the Nathas. The conception of the Varum or the ambrosial liquor is1 Supra, p. 108."},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"286OBSCURE RELIGIOUS CULTSalso found in the Carya-padas,1 and this Varu pimay more satisfactorily be explained in the sense of the ambrosial liquor of the Natha-yogins than figuratively as the flow of Maha-sukha or grossly as the flow of the Bodhicitta as semen virile. What we want to emphasise is that while one school had recourse to the Sadhana from a particular outlook the other approached the yogic practices from a different point of view and while the emphasis of the one is on some particular aspect of the Sadhana, the emphasis of the other was on another.It is because of these differences that while the Natha Siddhas were vehemently opposed to the association of women in any way with their Sadhana and described them as the greatest impediment in their march towards immortality, the Buddhist Sahajiyas eulogised women in all possible glowing terms as the incarnation of Prajna, or Sunyata herself; and her company was regarded as indispensable for the attainment of perfection in spiritual life. Of course we have seen before 2 that the Prajna or the Yogin! or the Mudra spoken of by the Buddhist Sahajiyas is not always the corporeal woman; she is the Nairatma or Sunyata or the Sahaja-damsel. But it will be equally a great mistake to try to interpret the Mudra always in this idealised sense and thus to explain away the necessity of the company ofwomen in the Sahaja-sadhana.We have noted before that the Maha-sukha of the Buddhist Sahajiyas was not a purely physiological sensa­tion,—there was a psychological element involved in1 e^a se tundini dui ghare sandhaa Iclana bakftlaa barunt bandhoa >1 sahaje thira /jari barunt sandhv ijem ajaramara hoi didha kondhe il Carya Song, No. 3.C/. eka strt bhujyate dvabhyam agaia candta-mandalat Itrtlyo yah punas tabhyarp sa bhaved ajaramarah ilGoraksa-paddhaii, p. 74 (Verse 31) (Bombay Edition).3 Supra, pp. 116 et seq."},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"THE RELIGION OF THE NATHA SIDDHAS 2 8 7it.1 This psychological aspect in the Sadhana (associated with the sex-emotion and sex-pleasure) is conspicuous by its absence in the'Natha school. The Vaisnava Sahajiya cult, we have seen, was based primarily on the divinisation of the sex-emotion by both physiological and psychological discipline. The Maha-sukha as the Sahaja-nature of the self and the not-self was transformed into the emotion of supreme love in the Vaisnava school. Neither Maha-sukha nor supreme love of the purest and the most intense nature is attainable without the help of the chosen woman and it is for this reason that the Buddhists always spoke of her as the incarnation of Prajna and the Vaisnavas of Mshabhava (i.e., the supreme emotion of love as personified by Radha),—and this attitude of the Sahajiyas, both Buddhist and Vaisnava, will present a sharp cantrast to that of the Natha Siddhas in general. The important point, however, to be noted in this connection is that inspite of this general attitude of aversion towards women, the Natha Siddhas also practised some well-known processes of yoga like Vajrauli, Amarauh, Sahajauli.2 etc. in the company of women. But these practices are yogic practices, pure and simple, in which women are neither philosophised upon, nor idealised.(iv) The Vedic Soma-sacrifice and the Drinking of Nectarin ihe Yogic SchoolsThe most important part of the Sadhana of the Natha Siddhas, viz., the drinking of the nectar called Som a, oozing from the moon, can very well be associated with the Vedic rite of Soma-sacrifice, in which the Soma-juice was drunk and also offered to the gods and it was believed that the Soma-juice rejuvenates and envigorates the body and gives the drinker, whether god or man, eternal life in heaven or1 Supra, Ch.

This Som a-juice was prepared from a particular climbing plant (well known as the Soma-plant, Sacrostema Viminalis or Asclepias Acida), which was said to grow luxuriantly on the mountains of India and Persia, and it is very frequently referred to in connection with sacrifice in the Vedic literature as well as in the A vesta. The relation between the Soma-plant and the moon was held very mysterious. The plant itself was often called 4 the moon* plant ’ and it was believed that the plant received its exhilarating and envigorating juice directly from the moon. As a matter of fact the moon is generally believed to be mysteriously related to all the medicinal herbs and it is held that the juice of the herbs, that possesses capacity of curing diseases and conferring longevity, comes from the moon. In the Visnu-purana (1*22) Brahma is said to have appointedSoma or the moon to be the monarch of SomaC m°°n and planets, of plants, of sacrifices, andpenances, and one of the names of the moon is Osadhi-pati or Osadhisa, i.e., 4 the lord of herbs.’ 1 So intimate is the relation between the plant Soma and the moon that in Vedic as well as post-Vedic literature the moon herself is called Soma. The Soma-plant was believed to possess sixteen leaves corresponding to the sixteen digits of the moon, 2 the leaves disappear one by one with the digits of the moon in the black fortnight and again reappear with the reappearance of the digits of the moon in the white fortnight. The mythical legend goes in the Puranas that 44 at the churning of the ocean after all sorts of medicinal plants and healing herbs are thrown in, three of the precious things said to be produced are Soma ‘ the moon,’ Amrta 4 nectarand Sura * spirituous liquor/ and in the other1 Dictionary of Monier Williams, p. 1137.2 We may note here that in the yogic texts Amrta is often thought of trickling down from the lotus of sixteen petais (soda&a-patra-padma-galiiam, Gora^a- paddhati, p. 76, verse 57), vyhich corresponds to the moon with the sixteen digits."},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"THE RELIGION OF THE NATHA SIDDHAS289legends this nectar is said to be preserved in the body of the moon. 1 It will be easy from the above to detect the striking similarity of the conception of the moon and Amrta or Soma of the yogins with those of the Vedic and ppst-Vedic traditions,—and it will also be easy to see howthe Vedic religious function of sacrifice was transformed into a yogic practice, in both the cases there being thequestion of drinking Soma to gain eternal life.(u) The Rasayana School and the Natha CultWe have said before in connection with the history of the Natha cult that in ideology as well as in methodology the yoga-system of the Natha Siddhas is strikingly similar to that of the Rasayana school. The Sadhana of the Natha Siddhas is essentially a Sadhana of transubstantiation and transfiguration. We have already referred to the popular traditions prevalent among the people of the Natha sect even to-day that the Siddhas like Matsyendra-nath, Gorakh- nath and others are still living in their subtle super-material body in the hilly regions of the Himalayas. These popular beliefs of a mythological nature have their root in the theo­logical speculations of the sect. It has been said in the Yoga-Vija that the perfect body of the yogin is subtler than the subtlest, yet grosser than the grossest; the yogin can transform his body according to his will—and his form is above all disease and death. He plays in the three worlds sportively wherever he likes, and can assume any and every form through his incomprehensible power.2 The same1 Monier Williams, p. 1137.2 suksmat sutymalaro dehah sthulat athulo jadaj jadah I iccha-rupo hi yogindrah sVotantras tv ajara-marah || krtdati trisu lokesu tilaya yatra \\utracit Iacintya-iaktiman yogi nana-rupani dharayan II (Verses 51-52),37-M l |B"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"2 9 0OBSCURE RELIGIOUS CULTSbelief is to be found also in the Rasayana school.1 The Rasayana school is fundamentally based on the ideal of Jloan-mukti and the method advocated is that of transubs­tantiation with the help of Rasa or chemical element (generally mercury) and thus making the body immutable.2 This Rasayana, though primarily a school of chemical science, was associated with theological speculations, and renowned personalities like Nagarjuna (the alchemist), Vyacli, Vyajapyayana and others are recognised to have been the stalwarts of the school. It is believed that many are the gods, demons, sages and men, who have attained the immutable divine body with the help of Rasa and have thus become JiVan-mufyta.6 The theological aim of the school can be postulated from the first chapter of the Rasamava where Bhairava (lord Siva) explains the principles of Rasayana to the goddess, and these principles, he says, are the best and the surest way to attaining perfection. The question of the goddess is, how to attain Jivan-mutyi. The Lord replies that the secret of J\\van-mu\\ti is rarely known even to the gods.

In Tantric phraseo­logy the two bodies are known respectively as Baindava and Sakta.

This minor religious cult is aptly styled as the Dharma cult; for, the main deity, around whom the parapher­nalia of worship, ceremonies and practices have gathered, and whose boundless grace and unquestionable supremacy have been sought to be demonstrated by a large number of poets in their semi-epical poems, is the Lord Dharma, or, as popularly known, the Dharma-thakura.

Critical analysis of the constituent elements will reveal that, as a popular religious cult, Dharma cult owes many of its elements to that form of later Buddhism, which is known as Mantra-yana and laterly, and most commonly, as Vajra-yana. The liturgi­cal texts, viz., the Sunya-purana and particularly the compen­dium entitled the Dharma-puja-Oidhana1, will at once remind one of the liturgical texts of Mantra-yana or Vajra-yana. Of course, in these vernacular works we find but a very faint trace of the earlier practices, we mean those of Tantric Buddhism, they being replaced by innumerable local and indigenous practices. In the process of assimilating the local indigenous practices the liturgical works of the Dharma cult show the same tendency as is found in the liturgical works of Tantric Buddhism. With the Sunya-purana and the Dharma-puja- Vidhana of the Dharma cult (excluding the portions on cosmogonical speculations) we may compare more particularly one well-known compendium of the religious practices of Vajra-yana Buddhism, viz., the Kriya-samgraha. * This1 Edited by Mr. Nani gopal Banerjee, Sahitya-parisad-granthlvali, No, 56,3 We have not been able to discover tkis text; we have at our disposal in rotograph a commentary on the text by Kuladatta, entitled Kriya-Bamgraha-paftjikfi (manuscript preserved in the Bibiioth&que Nationale, Paris, Sanscrit 31).

The Kriy^^am^raha, however, assumes a pseudo- Buddhistic form by professing occasionally that the final aim of all these rituals and ceremonies is the realisation of Bodhicitta with a view to attaining liberation not merely of the self but of the whole universe. But along with this avowedly Buddhistic * purpose even the per­formance of fire-sacrifice and the sacrifice of animals to the goddesses are also prescribed in this text in complete oblivion of the fact that Lord Buddha began his religious career as a living protest against the sacrificial religion of the Vedas and the cruelty to animals involved therein. The chapters on fire-sacrifice (Homa or Yajfia) found in the liturgical texts of the Dharma cult may be a faint echo of this prototype. In the Kriya-samgraha we find that the offering to the goddess Hariti consists of fish, blood of animals, meat along with all other articles; in the Surtya-purana also we find that the goddess associated with Dharma is very fond of animal- sacrifice.2of the manuscript of this commentary is also preserved in the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal (MS.

Some Nepalese Buddhistic practices are, indeed, found in the practices of the Dharma cult; 1 but it is plain to see that these are local practices which are neither Hindu nor Buddhistic either in nature or in origin.

This tortoise is so well-known a mythological figure in the HinduBuddhist temples. In the Dharma cult also Lord Dharma is often found associated with goddess Sitala, who is supposed by scholars to be the transformed form of the Buddhist goddess Hariti (both being goddesses of irruption).1 As for instance, we may note the use of lime in the worship of Dharma, the worship of goddess Sltala (\"generally associated with Dharma) who ia taken to be goddess Hariti of rantric Buddhism.2 See an article by MM.

The idea of the Lord Supreme, as conceived in all . forms of Tantric Buddhism, is, as we have already hinted, almost the same as conceived in many systems of Hindu theology. The followers of the Dharma cult have proceeded a step farther than the Tantric Buddhists and Dharma here represents the formless Brahman of the Upanisads, the Lord Siva of the Jsaivites and the Tantrics, Visnu of the general Vaisnavites, Krsna of the Krsnite Vaisnavas and Rama of the Ramite Vaisnavas The followers of the Dharma cult seem to have altogether forgotten that this Supreme deity may have some­thing to do with the Buddha of the Buddhists ,' and excepting two remarks that the original place of Dharma is the land of Ceylon and the Deity Dharma is much revered in the land of Ceylon,1 there is no direct evidence in the liturgical works or in the Mangala literature of the knowledge of the Dharmites that their religion and their deity have anything to do with Buddhism and the Buddha.

We have seen in an earlier chapter that various forms of Tantric Buddhism were prevalent in Bengal up to the twelfth century A.D. The revival of Hinduism with the rise of the Senas of Bengal and the Muslim invasion of Bengal dealt a death blow to all schools of professed Buddhism in Bengal. It is a well-known fact that many of the Viharas, which were important centres of Buddhism, were mistaken by the Mahomedan invaders to be the forts of the enemy and were ruined. But, as it has rightly been pointed out by MM. H. P. Sastrl, no religious movement of long-standing cultural influence can be eradicated all at once from a land by any other religious movement or political and religious causes. Buddhism, even in its Tantric foim, was pushed aside and was gradually assimilated into the cognate religious systems among the Hindus and the Muslims, and the Dharma cult is the outcome of suoh a popular assimilation. It is to be noted that the yogic element, which forms the most im­portant factor of Sahajiya Buddhism, had no influence on the Dharma cult and save some yogic imageries and phrases found occasionally used in the liturgical works,1 no reference1 Cf. mana haila nauka pavana keraala | surtara nauka je rupdra kfiraala IIS iin y a -p u r a n a, p. 105.“ The mind becomes the boat and the vital wind the oar; golden is the boat and of silver is the oar.”m a n a k ara n a u k a p a v a n a kara a la 1a p u n i to n irafijan a h o ila k fl^ ia ra II I b i dp. 209.(r Make your mind ths boat and the vital wind the oar ; Nirafijana him&elf has become the helmsman.’* Cf. also—\"Make your mind the boat and the vital wind the oar,—and make your mind concentrated, and then only can you expect to go to the"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"3 0 4OBSCURE RELIGIOUS CULTSto yoga of any sort is to be found in the Dharma cult.Before passing on to the next topic we think it necessary _ , to say here a few words about the pro-Possible Muslim ^ tinfluence on the bability of some Muslim iufluence on theDharma cult. After the Mahomedan invasion of Bengal in the thirteenth century, the Muslims began gradually to settle in the land and to exert political, religious and cultural influence on the people. It seems that the followers of the Dharma cult with their monotheistic belief in the formless God could easily have friendly terms with the Muslims who had the same mono­theistic belief in the formless God and who were particularly antagonistic to the politheistic belief of popular Hinduism, There seems to be palpable influence of the Muslims in the description of Dharma of later days.1 The Muslims of Bengal were in their turn variously influenced by these minor cults of Bengal, and as a matter of fact we find that in the popular Muslim literature of Bengal the Muslims used all the terminology of the Dharma cult and the Natha cult in their description of GodIt seems that the followers of Dharma suffered much fortheir religious beliefs and practices from the Caste Hindus*and when the Mahomedans entered Bengal as a conquering power the Dharmites took shelter under them, and when the caste Hindus were being persecuted in the hands of the Mahomedans for their beliefs and practices ‘the ancient grudge’ which the Dharmites had against the Hindusother shore. When the Dana-pati (i.e., the man who met all the expenses for Dharm-worship) heard this oracle, his mind became the boat and his vital wind was stopped.

Ramai came forward and inscribed some mark on the forehead of the ghost (so as to initiate him to the Dharma cult), but the latter chained Ramai hand and foot and took him to Dharma-raja Yama, who ordered Ramai to be cut into two with the help of a saw. But Ramai began to meditate on the Karatar (the Lord) and the saw could not pierce him; he was then successively cast into fire with hands and legs tied up and into the ocean with a slab of stone on his chest; but in each case Ramai was saved by the Karatar. The historical fact behind the legend is the perseV cution of the Dharmites by the Caste Hindus.1 ,We find that some of the poets of the Dharma-mangalas at first refused to comply with the request of Dharma to compose any poem in his honour for the fear of social persecution and it was after repeated assurance that the Lord could persuade them to compose poems.2 The story of the wrath of Lord Nirafijana (Niranjaner Ruima) found in the Surtya-purana as well as in the Dharma-puja-vidhana points out the simple fact that the Muslim conquest of Bengal and the persecution of the Hindus by the Muslims were regarded by the Dharmites to be the gracious device of the Lord himself to save the Dharmites from the hands of the persecuting Hindus.8 In the Dharma-1 See introduction to the Sflnya-purana by Dr. Shahidullah, p. 35.2 Vide Dhm. of Mfinik-gfinguli, p. 9.3 There we find that when the Brahminic people of Maldah began to tax t h e Saddharmis (i.e., the Dharmites who professed to be the Saddharmis), to persecute them and to kill them, Lord Niranjana got much angry in Vaikuntha and revealedhimself as the Khoda (God) of the Muslims in the village of Jajpura; he was seated on a horse with a black hat on and with a bow and arrow in hands, and all thegods and goddesses of the Hindu pantheon gladly put on the dress of Muslim soldiers to accompany the lord. The lord, however, with his army broke all t h e temples of the Hindus, plundered the Hindus, ravaged them and persecuted t h e m ,and the Dharmites were saved.

Here Ramai eulogises the religion of the Muslims and condemns that of the Hindus and prefers the practices of the former. As a matter of fact there are some customs in the Dharma cult which are essentially Muslim. As for instance, we find in the liturgical texts the custom of sacri­ficing goats or duck or pigeon before Dharma by cutting their throat in a particular manner (javai—Arabic YaVah), which is peculiarly a Muslim custom. Again, the animals or the birds are to be sacrificed with their face westward. In other places we find much importance given to the western direction in connection with the' worship of Dharma or the accessory ceremonies. The description of the gates invariably begins with the description of the western gate. Much importance is also attached to the moon, who is depicted as the Kotala (gate-keeper) of the western direction. This importance given to the western direction and the moon undoubtedly bears testimony to the Muslim influence.1 It is also to be noted in this connection that one of the most important incidents of the Dharma-mangalas is the incident of making the sun rise in the west by Dharma in response to the prayers of Lausen. The incident is described in detail in all the Dharma-mangalas. Instead of taking this incident simply as an instance of the display of supernatural power by the devotee of Dharma, will it be far wide of the mark to infer that the whole incident was construed only to explain from the stand-point of the Dharmites why the west was regarded so important by them ?

Here, as we have hinted before, we have the n n r.onsr.ious mixture of the conception of the Upanisadic Brahman with the Purusa of the Samkhya, Siva of theTantra, Visnu, Krsna and Rama of the Vaisnavas, Yama, the lord of justice and death, and also with Dharma, the popularly conceived godhead in general. These ideas of the Supreme Being have again coalesced with the idea of the supreme deity variously conceived in later Buddhism.The idea of Dharma as the godhead has a fairly old history in the Hindu texts. The word dharma ordinarily means that which is to be held fast or kept, or that which holds fast or keeps, or law, statute, religion, piety, right, justice, equity, virtue, merit, nature or character of entities, an essential or characteristic quality, mark, peculiarity of an entity, or the entity itself. In its Vedic form (dharman) it meant the maintainer, the supporter, the arranger. When popularly personified, Dharma means the lord of all laws and ordinances, the lord of justice, the central figure of all religion, and in this last aspect ‘Dharma is popularly conceived as God, the Lord Supreme, who is maintaining the whole world by administering order, discipline andSpeculations on th e Conception o f Dharma"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"SPECULATIONS ON THE CONCEPTION OF DHARMA 3 0 9justice. Even in the present day the custom among the common run of people is to swear by the name of Dharma, to appeal to Dharma for redress from distress, to invoke the blessings of Dharma in time of calamities.—and in all these cases Dharma is none but the supreme deity or God Himself. From as early a time as the time of the Vedas, the word Dharma is found used in its variously personified forms. In the $ataj)atha-brahmana (13. 4. 3) we find in connection with the enumeration of the kings and the subjects of all quarters and localities that Dharma Indra was the king of the gods. Here Dharma is identified with Indra, the lord supreme of the later Vedic literature. 1 In the Puranic literature we find men­tion of another Dharma, who is Righteousness, Justice, Law or Virtue personified; he was born from the right chest of Brahma and had three offsprings, £ama, Kama and Harsa. Dharma or Dharma-raja is well-known in the Puranic and v'epic literature of Sanskrit as the epithet of Yama who is the God of justice and the king of death. Even in popular Buddhistic literature Yama is widely known as the Dharma- raja. 2 Dharma is, again, one of the attendants of the Sun-god; he is Justice or Virtue, identified with Visnu; he is Prajapati, and is said to be the son-in-law of Daksa. We find mention of many other personalities in the Puranic literature of the name of Dharma who were notable for various virtues and activities.Of all these, however, Yama, the king of death and justice, is the most widely known by the name of Dharma or Dharma-raja. In the Mahabharata Yudhisthira is tradi­tionally described as the son of Yama, and he himself was known as Dharma-putra (i.e., the son of Dharma) and the epithet Dharma-raja is also found frequently used for him.1 Vide B.

When Yudhisthira was bewildered at the superhuman form and glow of the disguised Yaksa, the latter declared,—“ I am Dharma, your father of supreme power—and am come here only to see you. My body is constituted of fame, truth, self-control, purity, simplicity (arjava), modesty, steadiness (acapalya), bounty, penance and physical and mental discipline (brahmacarya); non-violence, equity, peace, moral virtue, purity and non-exhilaration are my senses.” 1 This Dharma once more came to test the righteousness of Yudhisthira in the guise of a dog when the latter was about to enter heaven (Maha-prasthanika-parva, Ch, 3). In the S\\anda-purana, Yama, the son of Surya, is depicted as a great sage (rsi) of the name of Dharma or Dharma-raja. He was practising austere penances to propitiate Mahadeva (i.e., Siva). The gods (including Indra) got frightened at the penances of Dharma and sent down a celestial damsel, Varddhini by name, to disturb the penance of Dharma. In course of a dialogue with her Dharma said,—“ I am Yama to all beings who are evil-doers,—and I am Dharma to all self-controlled people.” 2 Lord Siva was propitiated by the penances of Dharma and as desired by the latter the forest Dharma-ranya became a sacred place for pilgrimage through the boon of Siva.

As a matter of fact Yama himself, seated on his Vahana (mount) of buffalo, is often identified with the Dharma-raja of the Dharmites in many places ofWest-Bengal and the festivities in connection with thegajana of Dharma are known as the festivities of Dharma- raja Yama. Often it has been found that in worshipping Dharma-raja the priests utter the Mantra, — ‘Salute to Dharma-raja, who is Yama and who is of various forms’ (namaste bahurupaya yamaya dharma-rajaya).2 In theritualistic texts also we find corroboration of the fact. In the chapters on the river Vaitarani of the Sunya-purana we find that Dharma himself is acting as the helmsman and carrying all the devotees of Dharma to heaven, which is situated on the other side of the direful river Vaitaratfi. Ramai Pandita himself is here helping all lay people on board. The name of the river Vaitarani is so closely associated with the name of Yama in Hindu mythology that it takes no time to recognise that this Dharma-raja is none but Dharma-raja1 We do not think that this Guna-raja-khan is the same as Maladhara Vasu, the well-known translator of the BhagaVata in the pre*Caitanya period.2 Vide an article Radha-bhramana by PaficSnan Banerjee, B.

But before we deal in detail with this question it will be helpful to us to investigate into and examine the Buddhistic substratum of lord Dharma.(if) Buddhistic Substratum of DharmaIn the Sanskrit dictionary Amarakosa Dharma-raja has been mentioned as a synonym for Buddha ;8 in the Jataka stories also the epithet Dharma-raja refers to Buddha. It may be noted that the Dharmites still now observe the days of Buddha-pumima (i.e., Baisatyii pumima, the birthday of1 Of course, in some other chapters (viz., the chapters on Yama-purana% Yama-duta-samVada, Yama-raja-samVada) we find that the PurSnic Dharma-rSja Yama and Dharma-rgja Nirafijana are differentiated. It is demonstrated with legends that Dharma-raja Yama has no sovereignty over people who are devotees of Dharma-rgja Niranjana or the Karatar and that, being sadly harassed on several occasions, Dharma-raja Yama with the help of Rimai Pandit made an exhaustive list of the priests and devotees of Dharma-thakura of the five ages (including the void- age) so that he might instruct his officers not to meddle with them. About this disagreement of traditions we have nothing more to say than that here in the Dharma cult, which offers the best spe-imen of the religious psychology of untrained masses, nothing but anomaly and confusion can be expected.2 pp. 249 et seq. In one line of this chapter, however, Dharma and Yama are spoken of as two (Yama dharma duijan bosya achen-deva-sabhay) ; but in fact they are treated as one throughout the whole chapter.3 SarVajHah sugato baddho dharma- tathagatah I"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"SPECULATIONS ON THE CONCEPTION OF DHARMA 3 1 3Buddha) and Asadhi purnima (the day on which Dharma- ca\\ra was first preached by Buddha) as highly auspicious festive days.1 But it will not be fair to surmise from such identifications that Dharma or the Dharma-raja, or rather the Dharma-thakura of the Dharma cult directly represents Buddha. In discussing the Buddhistic substratum of the idea of Dharma we should remember that the Buddhism we are referring to here is not the Buddhism with which we are acquainted in any of the standard Buddhistic schools; it is that phase of later Buddhism which is so-called mainly historically as maintaining in a transformed, modified and corrupted form the continuity of the older thought. ,We may illustrate the exact nature of the relation of the Dharma cult with standard Buddhism with reference to an episode of the popular Pali text Milinda-pahha. The question of king Milinda is whether the man who is reborn is the same as the man who is dead or is an absolutely new man. It is indeed very difficult to answer the question directly in consistence with the theory of momentariness of the Buddhists. The answer of the Elder Nagasena is, therefore, v. indirect; he says that the man who is newly born is neither the same as the former, nor is he absolutely a new man; but inspite of the absence of personal identity the latter is to be associated with the former only because of the fact that the former is mysteriously responsible for the existence of the latter. The argument of Bhadanta Nagasena may very aptly be repeated here in connection with the exact relation between the Dharma cult and Buddhism, or the conception of the Dharma thakur and the conception of the ultimate reality propounded in Buddhism proper. It may be repeated here that it will be wrong to suppose that any particular Buddhistic conception of the reality has, through processes of1 The author is indebted to Prof. Prabodh Chandra Sen, M.A., for giving him detailed information on this point.40—141 IB"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"3 1 4OBSCURE RELIGIOUS CULTSlong transformation, coalesced with the Hindu conceptions of the supreme deity and has thus given rise to the com­posite conception of the Dharma thakura. Dharma-thakura represents as much infiltration of ideas from popular Hin­duism as from popular Buddhism, and this explains his extremely heterogeneous nature. In investigating into the Buddhistic substratum of the conception of Dharma, there­fore, we shall only indicate the different lines in which Buddhistic ideas might h^ve infiltrated in the mind of ordi­nary masses to give rise to the conception of a deity of such heterogeneous nature.We have seen before that the philosophic ideas of Mahayana Buddhism, with the spirit of catholicity and adapt­ation, had an innate tendency towards approximating the Upanisadic spirit. Whatever may be the position of Nagar- juna and his followers, who have been the centre of great controversy, the conception of the ultimate reality of the Vijnanavadins as pure consciousness or the absolute uncreate cannot but be held to be positive in nature. The Tathata- vada of ASvaghosa admits the Tathata-nature (i.e., the nature of the Dharmas as thatness) to be something substantial, per­manent and unchanging and as such it is something positive, though formless and unqualified. The conception of the Vijnapti-mcitrata or the Abhuta-parilialpa, which is of the nature of consciousness, bereft of the duality of the knower and the knowable, seems to be just the previous step of the conception of the Brahman which in its absolute and un­qualified nature transcends all knowledge, knower and knowability. It has always been vehemently argued by the Vijnanavadins that Sunyata was never spoken of by the Lord as pure ‘nothing’; while it is the negation of all duality, it implies at the same time the reality of pure consciousness or the absolute uncreate, which is unchanging, unthinkable, all­good, eternal, all bliss, the ultimate element of the nature of liberation."},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"SPECULATIONS ON THE CONCEPTION OF DHARMA 3 1 5Again in the docetic conception of the Tri-kaya in the Mahayana system the Dharma-kaya or the body of the cosmic unity, or the organised totality of things, though not as a purely philosophical concept, but as an .object of reli­gious consciousness, approximates the idea of the Brahman. The word Dharma-kaya is often explained as the body of law; and it may also be remembered that Buddha is said to have told his disciples that his teachings should be recog­nised as his own immortal body. But the word dharma is generally used in the Mahayana texts in the sense of ‘entity’; and the Dharma-kaya means the ‘thatness’ (tathata-rupa) of all the entities; it is in other words the dharma-dhatu or the primordial ele nent underlying all that exists. It has been also termed as the Svabhava-kaya, i.e., the body of the ulti­mate nature. It is described a3 devoid of all characters, but possessing eternal and innumerable qualities. It is neither the mind, nor matter, nor something different from them both. The nature of the Dharma-kaya is described in the Aoatamsaka-sutra1 in the following manner,—‘The Dharma- kaya though manifesting itself in the triple world, is free from impurities and desires. It unfolds itself here, there, and everywhere responding to the call of Karma. It is not an individual reality, it is not a false existence, but is univer­sal and pure. It comes from nowhere, it goes to nowhere; it does not assert itself, nor is it subject to annihilation. It is for ever serene and eternal. It is the One, devoid of all determinations. This body of Dharma has no boundary, no quarters, but is embodied in all bodies. Its freedom or spontaneity is incomprehensible, its spiritual presence in things corporeal is incomprehensible. All forms of corporeality are involved therein, it is able to create all things. Assuming any concrete material body as required by the nature and condition of Karma, it illuminates all creations.1 Quoted in Suzuki • Outlines of MahSyana Buddhism, pp. 223-224."},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"$16OfeSCURE RELIGIOUS CULTSThough it is the treasure of intelligence, it is void of parti­cularity. There is no place in the universe where this body does not prevail. The universe becomes, but this body for ever remains. It is free from all opposites and contrarieties, yet it is working in all things to lead them to Nirvana.”This docetic conception of Buddhahood as implied in the theory of Tri-kaya gradually transformed itself in the monotheistic conception of a Being and latterly in the clear conception of a personal God. The Dharma-kaya Buddha became the Lord Supreme, the Sambhoga-kaya Buddha became the Dhyani-Buddhas (viz., Vairocana, Aksobhya and others) and the Nirmana-kaya Buddha gave the idea of the human Buddhas (Manusi Buddha).All these various philosophical concepts about the ultimate reality in the different schools of Buddhism, including theAil docsfic and docetic conception of Buddha as con- momstic conceptions ceived in the theory of the Tri-kaya, lostot the reality in b u d ­dhism com bined in their special significance in a popular idealater times in the con- . \" i /-» 1 •ception of a Supreme of a Supreme Being—a personal God mlater schools of Tantric Buddhism, and the most common name by which He was known among the Tantric Buddhists was the Lord Vajra-sattva.1 Though it became customary with the Buddhist Tantrikas to describe this Vajra-sattva with all sorts of negative attributes (of course, in addition to the positive ones), it is very easy to see that the conception of the Vajra-sattva behind all these positive and negative attributes is definitely positive and is that of a personal God.

Dharma of the three ‘jewels’ of Buddhism SafighEu'Dhaim aand (viz., Buddha, Dharma and Sangha) natu­rally attracts our notice. MM. H. P. Sastri and others have propounded the theory that in later times Buddha, the first of the three jewels, was naturally eliminated by the lay Buddhists with the growing influence of revived Hinduism, and the third jewel Sangha became the Sangha (conch-shell), which is very important in connection with Hindu worship; and the second jewel, Viz., Dharma became identified with the Buddhist Stupa, which was worshipped as something like the symbol of Dharma,—and this Stupa became the Dharma-thakura of the Dharma cult in the form of a tortoise. In propounding such a theory, however, we should proceed a bit cautiously. As for the transformation \\ of Sangha into Sangha we may say that the frequent mention of Sankha with various other necessaries of worship in the Sunya-putana cannot convince one of its Buddhistic origin; for Sankha is no less important as one of the necessaries of worship in the proper Hindu liturgy than in the cult of Dharma. The story of Visnu’s killing Sankhasura and giving the Sankha to Padmalaya’s son, as narrated in the Odiya text Siddhanta-Dombara, seems to us to have nothing in it to warrant the origin of this Sankha in the Sangha of the Buddhists.1 Of course in the Dharma-puja-vidhana we find a few confused lines on Sankha; what we can at most infer1 “ We scarcely think it would be very wide of the mark to infer from this that the word Sankha here means nothing but a Buddhistic Sangha. In this inter­pretation of Sankha as Sangha, we are supported by the Sunya-Pur5na, in which Sankha is very frequently used for Sangha. The common people in their ignorance of the teachings of Buddhism and its terminology, either misspelt Sangha\"as Sankha or mistook Sankha for Sangha which really means a congregation of Buddhistic monks.” Modern Buddhism A n d Its Followers, etc., by N.

Gradually the three jewels of Buddha, Dharma and Sangha came to be interpreted in terms of Prajna, Upaya and the world produced by them; Upaya as the male principle was identified with Buddha, and necessarily Dharma became Prajna or the female principle and Sangha came to be interpreted as phenomenal world which is produced through the union of Prajna and Upaya/ These transformed forms of the three jewels are still1 It should however ba remembered in this connection that in the Dharma- mangalas we frequently come across the detail-; of Dhnrma-worship ; but there we do not find any special attention paid to this Sari/^cr.2 Cf. tola &ankha bandiva asamkhya lak$a muni Ie cari pandit banda e can amani IIMS. entitled Dharmer Bandana, C.

There the two male figures, with a female figure in the middle, widely known in their Hinduised nomenclature as jagannatha and Balarama with the image of Subhadra in the middle, are in all probability the representations of the three jewels of Buddha, Dharma and Sangha transformed as Upaya, Prajna and their son, i.e., the phenomenal world. In the esoteric Buddhist literature the epithet Jagannatha (i.e., the lord of the world) is widely used before Buddha or rather the Lord Supreme, and it is also a well-known adjective used before the Lord Supreme of the Hindus,—and thus through the medium of the epithet Jagannatha, the first of the three jewels could very easily be Hinduised and the Hinduisation of the other two was but a D . , matter of course. This theory of theBuddha as JagannStha. . .transformation of Buddha, the first jewel of the Buddhists, into Jagannatha (and later on frankly conceived as Krsna) has its corroboration in the tradition of the literature of the Dharma cult. Jayadeva, the famous Vaisnava lyric poet, described Buddha as the ninth incarnation of Visnu ; and in the literature of the Dharma cult we find in connection with the description of the incarnations of God that in the ninth incarnation God was born as Jagannatha, who is none but lord Buddha, and he settled his residence on the sea-coast, where he has relieved the whole world by distributing to all (irrespective of caste and creed) his Prasada (i.e., the food offered to God and supposed to be accepted by him).1 In another place we find that in this incarnation of Jagannatha the lord revealed himself to the Hindus and Muslims, who were all united together in his (i.e., Jagannatha’s) place, and in the country of Gaucla1 Dharma-puja-vidhana, pp. 206-207 ; also p* 208. See also Govinda-v'tjaya of Syima-dffs, Vangavisl-edition, p. 3.It may be pointed out here that in the ten incarnations of Visnu, inscribed on the gateway of the temple of JagannStha in Puri, Buddha, the ninth incarnation, has been replaced by JagannStha."},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"3 2 0OBSCURE RELIGIOUS CULTS(i.e., in Bengal) he has revealed himself as the Dharma-raja.1But though Buddha was the first of the jewels andhad his prominence also in the temple of Jagannatha,he could not enjoy universal sovereignty for several reasons. In the first place, from the metaphysical standpoint Dharma represents Prajna or Sunyata, which being the ultimate source of all origination and being often interpreted as the noumenal aspect of the reality, was infused with more cosmological , and ontological value than Buddha, whoDharma, the second i i _ .,jewel and Dharma- represents Upaya or Karuna, metaphysical­ly explained 'as the aspect of pheno­menalism.-^ This metaphysical valuation might have been there in the mind of common people in the form of a time- honoured tradition, and this may be why Dharma could supersede the claim of Buddha in being recognised as the supreme divinity among the Dharmitesv In the secondplace, in later times lay people had no idea about what thesethree jewels might be; they could recognise only Dharma, who was, in common faith and tradition, known to them as the Supreme Lord, the Sovereign Deity over the universe, —some Invisible power administering law and justice; consequently Dharma became gradually recognised as the Lord Supreme. Moreover, with the growing influence of Hinduism it was not possible for ordinary people of lower social order to accept any one but Dharma out of the three jewels as their Lord.The Dharma-thakura of the Dharma cult is not generally associated with any Sakti or female counterpart.

Even a cursory glance on the verses that are sung with dancing and beating of double drums will show how confusedly Siva and Dharma have been mixed together in these ceremonies and the verses themselves are really fragments found in the liturgical works of the Dharma cult and .the Sivsyanas of Bengal. It is very interesting to note that this ceremony of Gajana is also found in some districts of East Bengal in the form of Nila-puja, (i.e., the worship of the deity Nila), and this elaborate religious ceremony, which takes place in the last week of the Bengali year and takes about a week’s time to be completed, is never suspected by the people in these districts to be anything but a Hindu religious function primarily concerned with the Hindu deity Lord Siva.2 The fragmentary verses that are generally recited in connection with the various ceremonies of this function have striking affinity with the verses found in the liturgical works of the Dharma cult and also in the Gajana of Dharma of West Bengal not only in matter and spirit, but sometimes in language also with slight deviations.81 Published under the auspices of the Msladaha National Educational Institute, Bg S. 1319,2 A very brief account of this Gajana of East Bengal will be found in the VaAga-Sahitua-paricaya, Part I, of Dr. D.

He is Dharma-raja because he is the lord of all the entities (dharmanam raja), or because he shines in the world in his justice (dharmad rajate samsare rajate), or because all the entities, or all justice shine from him (dharma rajate ydsmat).5 He is also called Dharmesa, because he is the lord of all the divine virtues like the ten ^usa/as (i.e., ten Buddhistic acts of righteousness) and is also the lord of all people who possess1 cf. namna ca dharma-rajo'yam patnibhyah saha samyutam IIIbid., p. 149.

He is also called the lord of all beings—the Prajapati.4 It will be clear from the above that Adi-Buddha, the Lord Supreme of Nepalese Buddhism, who was of the nature of» Upaya, as contrasted with Prajna, was widely known also as Dharma-raja, and that will make it very clear how the Lord Supreme of the later Buddhhists can also be associated with the Dharma-thakura of Western Bengal and some parts of Orissa.The above will confirm our previous statement that Dharma-thakura does not represent the conception of any particular deity,—he rather represents the general idea of Godhead or of the sovereign deity over the universe, and as such he has been associated consciously with all the concep­tions of Godhead or of the sovereign deity popularly current in Bengal and Orissa from the tenth century A.D.

In the Dharma-man­galas we have almost nothing Buddhistic in the conception of Dharma, he being completely Hinduised ; the composite nature of Dharma is better illustrated in the descriptions of the Lord found in the liturgical works. In these descriptions of Dharma we should notice the importance that has been attached to the idea of Sunyata in various forms as the quint­essence of Dharma or as an attribute of Dharma. Vacuity is the support of Dharma—it itself is the essential nature of Dharma.

In the Dharma cult of Bengal and similar religious beliefs and practices of Orissa, and also in the Vaisnavism of Orissa the lingering effect of the tradition is best exhibited.

By combining all the positive and negative attri­butes applied to him nothing can be said of him but that he is the Supreme Lord.

Again we find, Lord Dharma rises from his sleep early in the morning and Ulluka offers to him his prayer; eight horses of white colour carry the golden chariot of the Lord and the Lord rises as the luminous sun.8 In the east is situated the golden temple of the Lord. The devotees invoke the Lord to rise up from his sleep and to relieve the whole world from darkness. Then the Lord awakes and asks for his chariot and horses, which are prepared for him instantly. The Lord then climbs on his chariot and the crown on his head touches the sky, and Indra begins to shiver in fear in heaven and the serpent Vasuki in the Netherland. When the Lord of the world thus rises on his chariot with a sacred thread of nine folds round his neck4 and shining with his radiant lustre like a wonder to all beneath, some think of him to be very near, and some to be far off.

The transformation of Dharma into some form of Visnu was almost complete in the Dharma-mangala literature. The Dharma-mangala literature, which is now available to us, is of very late origin and flourished under the sway of Vaisnavism both of the Rgma cult and the Krsna cult; it is for this reason that Dharma of the Dharma-mangalas is mostly identified with Visnu in general and Krsna and Rama in particular. It is only sporadically Tiere and there in the cosmogonical discussions and in some other places that we hear in the Dharma-mangalas of the Sunya-murtti of Dharma or of his * ‘ formless form V with all his negative and positive attributes.2 The older tradition of the identification of Dharma with Siva seems to have dwindled away by this time. Though Dharma is sometimes spoken of as the lord of Candi, and is worshipped with Vilva-patras which is particularly dear to Lord Siva, and though his abode is located in Kailasa, yet it seems that with the rise of the various Sakta and Vaisnava cults Saivism was rapidly losing ground. This was why the tradition of Dharma as Siva was gradually passing into1 S e e A th a Dharma-sajana, $8 nya-purana, p p . 1 5 9 et seq.2 S e e , D hm . o f G h a n a - r S m a ( V a n g a v f i s i e d i t i o n ) .

The general descriptions of Dharma that are found in the various Dharma-mangalas are the popular descriptions sometimes of the unqualified Brahman of the Upanisads and sometimes of the Purusa of the Samkhya and sometimes of a mixture of them in the most confused manner with the legendary accounts of the various incarnations of Visnu and his activities in various ages as are found in the Puranic literature.1 Again sometimes we find Dharma in the assembly of the gods, including Indra, Brahma, Visnu, Siva, Varuna and others, seeking advice from them as to the right measure to be taken to keep up his prestige, which was very frequently at stake in the hands of the devotees of Sakti. In the attempt to introduce his worship on earth by establishing his almighty power Dharma-thakura had no plain sailing; his devotee Lausen was at every step challenged by the devotees of Sakti either in the form of beasts or in the form of men, and whenever his devotee was thus challanged our Lord felt a sudden jerk in his royal seat either in Kailasa or in Vaikuntha and he would enquire from Ulluka, and more generally from Hanuman, as to what might have been the cause of that trouble; they would in reply describe the miserable plight in which his devotees might have been. In almost all cases our Dharma-thakura was very helpless and we find him always seeking advice and practical help from his companion and instructor Ulluka and mainly from his chief agent or executor, Hanuman. But in cases of more serious and emergent nature Dharma-thakura would call for an assembly attended by all the prominent gods (goddesses being1 See t h e d e s c r i p t i o n s o f D h a r m a i n t h e D / t m . o f R l m a - n S r S y a n a (MS.

Whenever we find the Lord appearing before the devotee, the devotee would never believe him to be Dharma unless and until he would appear before him in his form of Visnu with four hands. A typical case is the trouble that was created by a dog in the way when Dharma was proceeding to Hakanda to rise in the west at the request of his devotee Lausen. The dog obstinately obs­tructed the path of the Lord and would not allow him to pass on without disclosing his identity. The Lord told him that he was Dharma himself; but the dog intentionally refused to believe him to be Dharma unless and until he was in his form with four hands and in blue colour; at last the Lord had to comply with the request of the devout dog and assume the form of Visnu,1 and when the Lord asked the dog to pray for any boon it liked, the dog asked the boon of being a Tu/asi-leaf so that he might have the rare fortune of sticking to the lotus feet of the Lord constantly.2 In the Dharma-puja-cidhana and some of the Dharma-mangalas the ten incarnations of Visnu have been described as the ten incar­nations of Dharma. The Dharma-thakura of Mayana-pur is known as Yatra-siddhi and the people of the locality believe Yatra-siddhi to be identical with Visnu.8 In the work entitled Ystra-siddhi-rsyer Paddhati there is a Sanskrit hymn addressed to Dharma; the poet of the work (which seems to1 S e e t h e c h a p t e r o n Paicima-udaya, f o u n d i n a l m o s t a l l t h e Dharma-maAgalas*3 Dhm. o f G h a n a - r & m a , p p . 2 6 0 - 2 6 1 .» V ide , B .

It is mentioned that Dharma protected Prahlada from the hands of Hiranya-kaSipu, gave shelter to Dhruva_ and placed him in the fixed heavenly region, saved Sudhanva and Ajamila, protected the Pandavas in all their calamities, saved the honour and chastity of Draupadl „ when she was being molested by the evil sons of Dhrtarastra; he was all through the charioteer of Arjuna, killed the demon Ravana and saved Slta, deceived Brahma* the creator, and taught him a very good lesson in the land of Vrandavana as a cowherd boy and had all sorts of love- dalliances with the^owherd girls of Vrndavana. These and many such other descriptions of Dharma-thakura abound in almost all the Dharma-mangalas, where we find nothing but a list of some of the more important incidents associated with the different incarnations of Visnu jotted down pell-mell.(B) Dharma as RamaThe identification of Dharma-thakura with Rama in the Dharma-mangalas has been brought about mainly through the mediacy of Hanuman. In the liturgical works Hanuman is only one of the four Kotalas (gate-keepers) of Dharma, but in the Dharma-mangalas he is sometimes the mount of Dharma, sometimes the counsellor and the conscience* keeper of the Lord. In the Rg-Veda Uluka (the owl) has been described as the mount of Dharma-raja Yama, and342 OBSCURE RELIGIOUS CULTSprahhinna-fijana-balluka^ala'keli^aloiBukjarri yodhayantarji vik&rantarp cakxarp kvacid gopan 11 etc*Vide, H.S.P.P., B.S. 1313.

However strong in their supernatural power and in their tenacity \"of purpose in quarrels and intrigues, the gods and goddesses of our1 Much speculations are made by scholars as to the exact nature and significance of this Mount Ulluka or Uluka associated with Dharma, and it is also a matter of controversy whethei Uluka here is actually the bird owl, or is any other personality. A s a matter of fact in the $ unya-purana and also in the Dharma- puja-vidhana Uluka is more a personality than a mere bird. He is often called a sage or the great sage [Muni or M a h -m u n i) . From the very beginning Dharma* thikura did nothing without the advice of Uluka and in fact the latter seems to be much wiser than the lord himself. But in the Dharma-mangalas Uluka is generally depicted as the bird owl and in the legend of HariScandra of the Dharma-mangalas he plays an important part. The owl, which was the Mount of Dharma, was once sitting on the branch of a tree, when he was pierced through by an arrow aimed at by Luhicandra, son of Harilcandra ; the bird cursed the family of Haril- candra and said that Harigcandra would leave no posterity; it is generally with this curse of the bird Uluka that the HariScandra legend begins. Saving a few places where Uluka is admitted to be the sage Uluka and the counsellor of Dharma, Uluka is depicted in the Dharma-mangalas as a mere bird, the place of sage Uluka being practically usurped by HanumSn, The name Uluka, however, is well-known in Puranic literature as the name of different notable personalities. In the PurSnas Uluka is a name of Indra himself; another Uluka was the son of sage Vi^vlmitra,— another the son of Sakuni. In the Mahabharata we find mention of a king of the name of Uluka; another Uluka was an ambassador in the Mahabharata. Again the Vaiiesika system of Indian Philosophy is also known as the philosophy of Uluka; in the VaiSesika system Dharma has variously been explained (of course, in a sense entirely different from that of the Dharma of the Dharma cult). Mr. B. JC. Chatterjee in his introduction to the Dharma-mahgala of Mayura-bhafta is disposed to think that the Dharma cult of Bengal may be a continuation of the religious cult propounded and preached by Uluka in a very early period, and hence is the importance of Uluka in the Dharma-mangalas. But such a surmise does not seem to us plausible at all for various reasons. There is nothing in the Dharma cult which can even very remotely be associated with anything of the Vailesika system; moreover, it is doubtful whether the Vailesika system of thought represents any religious sect. If the religious doctrines of Uluka were something different, that being entirely unknown to us, the question of the possibility of its relation with the Dharma cult cannot be decided. It should also be remembered in this connection that far from representing any philosophical school, the Dharma cult of Bengal, as we have repeatedly pointed out, cannot be said to represent even any particular religious school."},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":".344OBSCURE RELIGIOUS CULTSliterature seem to have been all through very weak physically, and whenever any gigantic work had to be performed, Hanflman was invariably approached by all the gods and goddesses. We find him also a good assistant to Vi^vakarma, the great mechanic of the universe. Hanuman, therefore, served not only Rama-candra of the Bengali Ramayanas,—he has served Candi in the Candi-mangalas, Manasa, the serpent goddess, in the Manasa-mangalas, and every one took advantage of his gigantic physical strength and his obedient nature. Dharma-thakura, therefore, was wise enough to have Hanuman constantly at his disposal to have all the difficult tasks dorje by him. But by being thus constantly accompanied and obeyed by Hanuman, Dharma-thakura could no longer retain his Dharma-nature and gradually became transformed into Rama-candra himself. We find in the Dharma-mangalas that whenever Dharma- thakura asks Hanuman to do some arduous and hazardous work, Hanuman refers to all his (Hantiman’s) heroic deeds of the Ramayanic period and says that if it were possible for him to do all those great things for the lord at that time, there is no reason why it should not be possible for him to do the same once for the lord. The lord also occasionally refers to the valour and obedience of Hanuman that he had shown formerly in various occasions.1As a matter of fact we find Hanuman often performing the same kind of wonderful feats for the lord in the Dharma- mangalas as he did in the Ramayanas.1 We have sufficient21 A s a typical instance compare the dialogue between_Dharma and HanOmSn when the former was requesting the latter to protect Lsusen in his (i.e., LSusen's) childhood from the hands of the thieves.5 A s an instance we may point out that when LSusen was crossing the river A jay to attack Ichsi-ghoa he was captured and brought a victim to the Netherland (P&iala) by the river herself; to this Dharma became perturbed and sent HanumSn to do the needful. HaniimSn went to the place of action and put all the water of the river A jay into the cavities of his ears; the river begged pardon, released LSusen and then and then only was her water released.

In this, however, there seems to have been something like a popular confusion. In our religious history LaksmI and Sarasvatl have sometimes been confused one for the other, and this will explain the worship of Saiasvatl on the white PaHcamt (i.e., the fifth day of new moon) of the month of M dgha, which was most probably originally the date for the worship of LaksmI as the very name $ri-paficatrii will indicate (see Sarasvati by Mr. Amulya Caran Vidyff- bhfisana, Vol. I). May we infer that as we have the worship of Sarasvatl in the Srl-paficarrii of the month of M dgha in the place of the worship of Laksmi, so we have the worship of LaksmT on the full-moon night of autumn in the place of the worhsip of Sarasvatl and hence perhaps is the importance of all white articles in the KojUgara-LaksmVs worship?8 In literature, however, white colour also represents fame and smile (Cf, ya ia ii d h a va la ti varqyate hnqakirtyofi—S sh itya -d a rp a n a ),"},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"348OBSCURE RELIGIOUS CULTS(inertia) being represented by LaksmI and Mahakali respec­tively.1 In the the Samkhya philosophy pure intelligence- stuff (Sattva) has been spoken of as of pure white colour, Rajas or energy of red colour, Tatnas or inertia of black colour. It is for this reason that the colour of Sarasvatl is pure white and everything associated with her and her worship is also white.Coming to Buddhism we find that when Buddha began to be docetically conceived, he was conceived as the embodi­ment of perfect purity and perfect enlightenment. He was pure-consciousness {vijnapti-matrata or vijnana-dhatu) as the ultimate reality,—he is perfect knowledge or wisdom. He has often been described as effulgent by nature (pra\\rti-prabhasVara) and as radiating light of Buddhism.ne8S in knowledge {prajhalo\\a). Round the physi­cal form of historical Buddha as Siddhartha or Sakya-simha there has always been a glow of perfect purity and enlightenment. Before giving birth to Buddha, Maya,-his mother, dreamt that a white elephant entered her womb and this predicted the birth of Buddha who would attain perfect enlightenment. This notion of perfect purity and enlightenment as the ultimate nature .of Buddha or rather of the supreme deity (Bhagavan) was to a great extent traditionally carried down even to the latter periods of Tantricism. It is, therefore, not very unlikely that in the popular description of Dharma-thakura as all white and having everything white associated with him we have an unconscious mixture of the notions of Siva and Buddha.1 Vide, SaraaVati by A.

Setai is white in colour, Nilai is blue, Kamsai yellow, Ramai red and Gomsai green. The five Panditas are really the five priests of Dharma in the five ages including the age to come.1 But at the time of the worship of Dharma all the five ages meet together with all the five Panditas, whom we find placed in the five quarters, and these five quarters are again represent­ed by the five gates of the temple of Dharma facing the five quarters. This theory of the gates in the different directions with respective presiding deities over them is also found in the Gajana songs of Siva still now current in West Bengal as well as in East Bengal. In the versions of West Bengal the presiding deities over the southern, western, northern and eastern gates are Jagannatha, Ekadasa Bhima, the Sun (Bhanu-bhas\\ara-raya) and Kamakhya of Kama-rupa respectively.2 In the versions of East Bengal the deities in the west, south, east and north are Jagannatha, Vaidya- natha, Sri-munda-cakra-vahini and Sri-sabha-linga-vahini respectively.8 Sometimes Jagannatha, Ksira-nadi-sagara, Surya-divakara (the sun) and the Himalayas are also saluted in the four directions.41 The tradition of Papdita Goqasfii is not found in ail the descriptions.* Vide, A dyer Gambhtra by H.

The KotSlas, as they are depicted in the Sunya- purana, seem to be so many attendants on the priests and gate-keepers in the five directions of the Dharma temple [; they open doors to the visitors and again shut them up. The association of the sun and the moon with the east and the west is well-known, and the association of .Hanuman with the south is also well-known through the stories of the Rama- yana (Ceylon, which was the field of activity of Hanuman being situated to the south of India). So the appointment of these three Kotalas in the three quarters is easily explicable. Guruda and Uluka are well-known as the mounts of Visnu and Dharma-thakura respectively. As Hanuman, associated with the south, happens to be something like the mount of Rama-candra, it is perhaps by the law of association that the two other well-known mounts are placed in the other two quarters. In the Dharma-puja-vidhana, however, the Kotalas or the guards are differentiated from the gate-keepers (Dvati or Dvara-pala), who are again attended by four Patras (attendants).

In later Buddhistic esoteric literature these deities are described with their Bodhisattvas, human Buddhas (Manusi Buddha), Sakti (female counter­part), mounts (vahana), postures (mudra), crest, family (kula), bija-mantra etc. They are again associated with the five gross elements (panca-bhuta), five kinds of sense- perception and the five sense organs. They are again located in the five places within the human body. We are giving below a chart of the whole thing, wherein the contro­versies over the details are ignored.21 See an axticle by P. K.

With the five Tathagatas and the five- Panditas we may compare also the popular Islamic tradition of the five Pirs (or saints). It may also be cursorily noticed that the Kabir Panthis have the belief that the Sat Purusa (i.e. the Supreme Being) has four different messengers in the four ages, viz., Sat Sul^rii in the Satya-yuga, Munin- darji in the Treta, Karunamaya Rsi in the Dvapara and Kabir Saheb in the Kali.Already in the Hevajra-tantra we find that there are four corners and four gates or doors of the Mandala or Cakra (mystic diagram) of goddess Prajna and four are the Saktis in charge of the four gates ; they are Gaurl in the east, Caurl in the south, Vetall in the west and Ghasmari in the north; there are other two goddesses, viz., Bhucarl and Khecarl in the downward (adhas) and upward (urddhva) directions.1 These goddesses in the different directions are again said to be the presiding Saktis over the five sense-1 cakram purvarjri yatha kathitam hara-rddhahara4obhitam tcatu$-k.onam catur-dvaram Vajra-sutrair alamkftam II* * * *nihsfta indra-dig-gaurl purva-dvare tu sarpsthita I mantha-manthana-yogena caurika nih»fta punah II nihsrtya dak^inc dvare court saddvala ( ?) —Valike I bola-kflkkola-yogena vetall nihsftS punah II nihsftya pa&cime dvare nisanna mara-bhahjani I maha dvandva-samapattau nihsfta ghasmari punah II nihsftya uttara-dvarc nisanna ghora-rupinl I etc*Hevajra-tantra, MS. pp. 55 (B)—56 (B).Cf. also indre gauri yame caurt vetall Varune diii Ikaiibere ghasmari caiva adho bhUcharl smrta li urddhve khecarl prokta utpatti-krama-pakiatah I etc.Ibid, MS, P. 25 (B)See also Sadhana-mala, (G.

In the exoteric form of northern Buddhism we find the theory of the five Buddhas represented in the Buddhist Stupas or Caityas of latter time, where one of the five Buddhas was given prominence to be the Lord Supreme and was placed in the centre and the other four were placed on the four gates or doors on the four sides. Such a scheme is to be found also in the sculptural represen­tation of the later Buddhist Stupas or Caityas. Esoterically, however, these Tathagatas and also their Saktis are placed in the central, eastern, southern, western and northern directions of the mystic diagram (Mandala) of secret practices. In later times all these esoteric and exoteric traditions transformed themselves into the scheme of the five gates (including the void-gate) of the temple of Dharma, where the five Tathagatas or the five Buddhas have become the five worshippers of lord Dharma in the five ages in the form of the five Panditas., The tradition that there are different deities presiding over the different quarters is, however, as old as the Vedas. Thus in the Atharva-veda we find that, of the Eastern quarter Agni is the overlord, black serpent is the defender,1 rupe gaurt samakhyata iabde cauri prakirtita IVetatt gandha-bhage ca rase ghasmari kjrtita II sparSe ca bh&cart khyata khccari dharma-dhaiutah IHevajra-tantra, MS.

We have seen that the five Tathagatas, though originally said to be five deities over the five Skandhas, are associated with the five gross elements. These five elements have been represented in the Hindu Tantras by the five (out of the six) lotuses or plexuses, viz., Muladhara representing earth, Svadhisthana representing water, Manipura representing fire, Anahata air and Visuddha ether. There are five presiding gods and five goddesses associated with these lotuses. The gods are, Brahma, Visnu, Rudra, Isana, and Mahadeva respectively; and the goddesses associated with the lotuses are Dakini, RakinI, Lakini, KakinI and SakinI respectively. The bija-mantras of the lotuses are lam, bam, ram, yam, and ham; the bija- mantras of the five Dhyarii Buddhas are also almost exactly the same (i.e., I, b, r, y, and om).

The five elements in the five plexuses, Viz., earth, water, fire, air and sound are described in some of the texts as of yellow, white, red, smoky and blue colour respectively. Again we find in the Puranic literature that there was the tradition of God’s having four different colours in the four different ages. God was of white colour in the Satya-yuga, red colour in the Treta-yuga, yellow in the Dvapara-yuga and black in the Kali-yuga.1 Rupa-gosvaml speaks of the colour scheme as white, red, dark-green and black.2 It may also be noted that in the A nagata-Vamsa (a Pali text describing the tradition of the advent of Maitreya, the future Buddha) there is the description of four gates in the capital city Ketumati and in the four gates there will be four Kalpa-trees of the blue, yellow, red and white colour.8 In the Chandogyo-panisat we find that of the four Vedas, the first, i.e., the Rg-vzda is spoken of as of the colour of the white portion of the eye, and the second, i.e., the Sama- Veda is spoken of as of the colour of the deep blue portion of the eye.4 Again, of the five material elements Tejas is described as red, water as white and earth as black/ Again, the nerves of the body have been described as secreting four kinds of liquids, which are of white, blue, yellow and red colour.61 asan Varnas trayo hyatya gjhnato' nuyugam tanah I iukJo rakto* tath a pita idariim krsnatam gatah IIBhagacata-purana, (10. 8. 13).2 kathyate varna-namabhydrp iuklah satya-yuge harih I rakta'iydma-kxamat krwas tretayarji dvapare kalau IfL agh u -bh agavata-m fta of Rupa-gosvimi.3 Vide verse* (10-20).4 C h an dogya, ( 1 . 7 . 4 ) .6 Ib id.

Again, as for the metal of the articles it may be noticed that the articles associated with the western gate, which is again connected with the Satya-yuga or the golden age, are all made up of gold ; those of the southern gate, associated with the silver age, are all of silver; those of the eastern gate, associated with the copper age, are all of copper, those of the northern gate, associated with the iron age, are spoken of as made up of some read metal, or, bell- metal, stone and brass; and those of the fifth gate, associated with the void age or the age to come, are all of diamond.

Inspite of the differences in details, there is a general similarity in the description. When we shall analyse the ideas found in these theories we shall find that here also, as in other cases, there is a great jumbling of ideas received from various sources of Indian philosophy, theology and mythology. Of all the descriptions found in the vernaculars, the descriptions contained in the literature of the Dharma cult of Bengal seem to be the most detailed and important, and we shall presently see that all the other' descriptions found in other types of literature present a striking similarity with the descriptions found in the literature of the Dharma cult. Though the accounts given in the vernaculars are often extremely con- fusedNin nature, we must first of all attempt a very brief exposition of these cognate theories and our next and more im portant task will be to analyse them and to affiliate the constituent elements to the older thoughts and beliefs.1In the Sunya-purana we find that in the beginning there was nothing,—neither any linear mark,Account given . ,in the nor any form, nor any colour, nor anySanya-purana.

The universe was not,—neither was anything mobile or immobile, nor were the temples, nor the gods in them,—there were only all-pervading darkness and haze (dhundhukara)—and in the infinite vacuum the Lord alone was moving in the great void having nothing but void as His support. And in his absolute loneliness the Lord was thinking of creating some­thing, and out of the great vacuum there came out the vital air of the Lord, from which came inhalation and exhalation; from these again proceeded great compassion and from that all the principles of illusion. Then there came out a bubble of water on which the Lord n\\ade his seat, but the bubble could not withstand the pressure of the Lord and burst into pieces leaving the Lord once more in the vacuum. Then the Lord sat fixed in the vacuum and in and through his com­passion another personality of the name of Niranjana came out of him. The latter, however, had no hands and legs,— neither had he any father and mother, nor was he born of the seed and the ovum, nor had he any other companion in the great void. This Niranjana or Dharma then sat on the seat of compassion and passed full fourteen ages in the meditation on the Great (bambha-jana). After fourteen ages of medita­tion Niranjana yawned and from his high breath came out the bird Ulluka. The bird began to flee away from the Lord who was calling it from behind; but Ulluka got tired in the infinite void and came back to the Lord. The Lord then took compassion on Ulluka and made his seat on the back of the bird and once more passed fourteen years in meditation. In the mean time Ulluka became much fatigued with hunger and thirst and asked for some drink from the Lord. The Lord gave a little quantity of fluid from his mouth to the bird to drink. Ulluka drank the fluid, but some portion of it fell outside in the void and water came out of it, and both the Lord and his mount were floating on water. But in the heaving water both of them were being tossed roughly and a"},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"COSMOGONICAL AND COSMOLOGICAL THEORIES 3 6 1feather dropped from the body of the bird and the feather became a swan. The Lord then proposed to have some rest on the back of the swan, and the latter agreed, and the Lord once more passed several ages on the back of the swan. But the swan also got tired and flew away in the void leaving the Lord in water. The Lord then touched water with his lotus-like hand, whereby a tortoise came to being, and the Lord passed several ages in meditation on its back. The tortoise also got tired and flew away leaving the Lord and Ulluka on water. Ulluka then advised the Lord to create the world in water. With the instructions of Ulluka the Lord cast off on water his golden sacred-thread, which instantane­ously became the serpent Vasuki ofjhousand fangs. Then the Lord accumulated a little quantity of dusty substance from his nail and placed it in the form of the world on the head of the serpent Vasuki. The Lord then went out with Ulluka to visit the world and the world was increasing with the speed of the Lord. By roaming about in the world the Lord became tired and began to perspire and from the sweat of his body was produced the Adya-Sakti (the primordial energy). The Lord built a house for her and placed her there and after creating the river BaJluka engaged himself in meditation once more for fourteen ages. In the mean time Adya-Sakti grew young and from her youthful desires proceeded forth Kama (Cupid) who was sent by Adya to the Lord. Kama went to the Lord, aimed his arrow at him and the Lord was disturbed. The Lord came to know everything from Ulluka and put Kama in an earthen pot and Kama became trans­formed into poison. Adya, after some time, became unable to bear the burden of her youth and attempted to commit suicide by swallowing the contents of the earthen pot ; but to her astonishment she became pregnant thereby.

Brahma could not recognise the Lord in disguise, Visnu also could not recognise him ; it was only Siva, who could recognise the Lord. The Lord became pleased with Siva, and granted him three eyes (for all the three brothers were born blind). Subsequently at the request of Siva the other two brothers, viz., Brahma and Visnu also received eye-sight with the sprinkling of the fluid from the mouth of the Lord. All the three brothers then went back to Adya, where they were entrusted by the Lord with the task of creation. Adya-sakti was asked to be the wife of Siva and to help him in the work of creation. Thus after entrusting the whole task of creation, preservation and destruction to the triad the Lord once more went to the void and remained for ever seated on his mount Ulluka.1The fragmentary accounts -of cosmogony found in the .

Mahamaya or Adya-sakti attained her youth. Dharma proposed to Ulluka that as Adya was produced from the left part of his body, she should be the wife of the Lord. The proposal appeared obnoxiously repulsive to Adya, who tried to flee away in all the directions ; but at last she had to give way and the marriage took pl&ce in the void through the medi­tation of Ulluka. Then follows the birth of the triad and the story of Dharma’s disguise to test them. Here also it was Siva, who could recognise the Lord, and the propitiated Lord entrusted Siva with the charge of creation. But Siva, with the preponderance of tamas in him, created the Yaksas, Raksas, ghosts, genii, demons and many such other horrible beings. The Lord then put a check to Siva and asked Brahma to take the charge of creation. The Lord Himself assumed the form of a bear and brought for him (Brahma) the earth, which lay hidden in the nether land. Then follows the theory of the self-originated Brahma and the Manus, the. Ditis and the Aditis, etc., as it is found in the Puranic litera­ture.3 In Ghana-rama we find that in the primordial void and darkness the formless supreme Lord first revealed himself in a form which contained the potency of all creation. The Lord desired to create and from his desire for creation was born Prakrti in the form of the most beautiful and charm­ing woman,—and the mind of the Lord was disturbed at the sight of her beauty, and through the disturbance in his mind Prakrti was infused with the three gunas from which againwere born the three gods, Brahma, Visnu and Siva.

From Prajapati Brahma was first produced Ahankara (egohood), from A han\\ara proceeded the five elements and then the four sons of Brahma {viz., Sanaka, Sananda, Sanat-kumara and Sanatana) and so on as in the popular Puranic accounts.1 According to the account given by Manik Ganguli the triad with the essence of the gunas was produced from the union of the Lord and Sakti and for the triad Sakti again divided her­self into three goddesses, Viz., Brahmani, Vaisnavl and Saivl. Then follows the test of the triad. Here we find that all the three gods could recognise the Lord and did welcome him warmly and humbly and the Lord, pleased with the triad, entrusted them with the charge of creation, preservation and destruction. The three Saktis, Viz., Brahmani, Vaisnavl and Saivi were then united with Brahma, Visnu and Siva and the triad with their Saktis created the manifold universe.2 The account given by Narasimha Vasu in his Dharmayana comes closer to the Samkhya view of cosmology. From the desire of the Lord for creation in the primordial void Prakrti was born in the form of a beautiful woman, and from the union of Prakrti and the Lord was born a son of the name of Mahartta (i.e., mahat) and from Mahartta came three Ahamkaras of the nature of three gunas, and from them were born the triad.3 Then follows1 See Dhm. of Ghana-rama, Sthapanapala, pp. 5-7.2 Dhm. of Manik Ganguli, pp. 9-11,3 mahartta haite haila ahankar tin I sartta raja tamasa trigun bhirnna bhin II sartta rupe birana rupa fearz/a diray I rajagune sthiti-kflfta brahmdr tanay II sit) tama-gune haila jaha haite naa I tamasa gunete jammila aksa ilDharmayana of Naraeiipha Vasu, Vol. I..

Again one Lord became three (the Triad) according to the gunas. Of the Triad Brahma hpd four sons born of his desire (manasa-putra), but all the four went away for penance leaving behind the phenomenal world. Brahma, however, got angry and from his anger was born Rudra, who was given six female companions (Viz Dhrti, Vrddhi, Hi, Vasi, Siva and Anima) and was ordered to create the creatures. Siva began to create horrible creatures and was at once stopped by Brahma. For the purpose of creation Brahma then divided his body into two parts, one as the female and the other as the male (the letter being named as Svayam- bhuva Manu). This latter was then requested by Brahma to create progeny, but Svayambhuva Manu wanted land where the created beings might have their abode.

In accordance with the decree of the Lord, Hara and Gauri came down on earth and they were accompanied by the Siddhas.

There is a marked tendency among some scholars to hold that the cosmogonical and the cosmological views discussed above are Buddhistic in origin.If we proceed on in a critical way we shall see that there is no distinctive nature of the views found in the vernaculars. As we have said, here there is but a popular and confused mixture of the cosmogonical and cosmological ideas found in the Vedic literature, in the Upanisads, the Samkhya system, in the Puranic literature, in the Hindu Tantras and in the later phase of Mahayana Buddhism mainly expressed through the various Buddhist Tantras.

The whole universe was then created by him from nothing. Or we shall find that there was the primordial darkness and water and the Lord was there in his formless existence. This idea is, however, to be met with first in the There we find,—“ At that time there was neither the aught, nor the naught, neither the earth nor heaven above. What was there to cover all ?

Again we find that in the beginning was the A sat alone, and from the A sat arose the Sat and the Sat was one and without a second in the beginning. The Sat desired that it would be many and energy {tejas) arose from it; from tejas was water (dp) and from dp was produced gross matter (anna). 2 The Brhad- dranyaka says that the Brahman was alone in the beginning and from Him arose all gods and the universe in all its varieties. 3 Again it is sometimes said that water alone was in the beginning,—from water arose Satya, from Satya arose the Brahman, from the Brahman Prajapati (the lord or the creator of the beings) and from the Prajapati were the gods. 4 Again we find that water was in the beginning and therein was born Prajapati in the lotus-Ieaf. He desired to create the universe and the universe gradually proceeded from his desire. 5 The conception of the primordial water is as old as the Vedas6 and is very popular so far as the Puranic literature^ of India is concerned.

The creator of the universe is, however, Prajapati, or Brahma or the Vi£va-karma as he has' variously been conceived in the Vedic and Upanisadic literature. This Prajapati or Brahma* though often described as the most supreme of all the gods, the god of the gods, is never the same as the Absolute Brahman, In the Vedic• (5.5 6.4), (5.5. 7.5).3 (7 7. 1.5)."},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"literature we find that the vast universal process could not be explained with reference to the well-known gods; there was, therefore, naturally the tendency to conceive of a greater god, who represents no particular aspect or force of nature, but an unified conception representing- something like the totality of the forces acting behind the universal process. He is the Hiranya-garbha—the first radiant manifestation of the Supreme Un manifest,—as tjie per­sonification of the creative impulse and the creative force of the Unmanifest. It is said in the Rg-Veda (10.121) that the Hiranya-garbha arose in the beginning; he was the lord of all the existent; he was the lord of the earth and the sky and he vested all creatures with life and breath; the gods do not dare disobey him, he is the god of„ the gods. In the Brahmanas, Aranyakas and the Upanisads we find ample references to this Prajapati Brahma, also spoken of as the Hiranya-garbha, who was the first created,—the first being,— the first born of all the gods. In the Brahmanas and the Upanisads we always find Prajapati Brahma performing penance for the purpose of creation. Sometimes it is said that Brahma was born in the primordial water. The epithet Hiranya-garbha, applied to Brahma, points to the fact that he was born of a golden egg supposed to have been formed out of the seed deposited in the water when they were produced as the first creation of the Supreme Lord. In the Satapatha-brahmana (XI. 1, 6. 1-11) we find that Prajapati was born of a golden egg, which was produced by primordial water through penance. Thus it is said,—“ In the beginning there existed here nothing but water, a sea of water. These water desired to propagate their kind. They tortured themselves, they mortified themselves. And when they had mortified themselves a golden egg originated in them. The year did not yet exist at that time; but as long as the duration of a year, this golden egg swam about. After a year a man arose out of it ; that4 8 — M l I BCOSMOGONICAL AND COSMOLOGICAL THEORIES 377"},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"3 7 8OBSCURE RELIGIOUS CULTSwas Prajapati.” 1 In the Chandogya-upanisat it is said that in the beginning was the A sat ; from the A sat there was the Sat and from the Sat originated an egg. After one year the egg split up into two and from the golden portion was created the region above and from the silver portion the earth below.2 We find somewhat detailed description of this Hiranya-garbha Brahma also in the Manu-samhtta. There it is said that once this universe was shrouded in darkness and everything was imperceptible, indistinct—beyond all under­standing and all kinds of intellectual comprehension—as if in deep sleep. Then the Self-existent Unmanifest Lord, with an impulse towards creation, manifested Himself in His radiant form, and that Incomprehensible All-pervading One created Himself in,a form. With a view to create various kinds of beings from His own body He first created water and deposited His seed in it. The seed in the water trans­formed itself into a resplendent egg, from which was born' Brahma, the grand-father of all the worlds (saroa-loka- pitamaha). The first person, created by the unmanifest cause-potency, which is eternal and is of the nature of both Ens and non-Ens, is called Brahma.9 Brahma lived in that egg for full one year and after that broke it into two parts through the force of meditation; with the upper part of the egg he made heaven and with the lower part he made the earth, and in between the two regions was created the sky and the eight quarters, et£. Then follows the creation from Brahma, which of course, was in the line of the Samkhya cosmology.4 In the vernaculars we find occasional references to this egg; and from what is discussed above about the nature and function of Prajapati Brahma, it will be very clear1 A History of Indian Literature, by Winternitz, p 223.2 Chandogya—(3.19)3 yat tat karanam avyaktam nityam sad-asad-atmakam I tad-visntah aa puruso /ofee brahm'eti feTrtyafe IManu-samhitat (1.11).* Vide Manu*aamhitap Chapter I."},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"COSMOGONICAL AND COSMOLOGICAL THEORIES 3 7 9to see that the conception of Nirafijana, as we find variously described in the vernacular literatures, is nothing but a very popular representation of the older conception of Prajapati Brahma.We think, it will not be far wide of the mark to recall in this connection the Vedantic conception of the two aspects of the ultimate reality or the Brahman, the unqualified inactive absolute aspect, which can only be negatively described; the other aspect is the qualified active aspect which has been described as the Hoar a. The Absolute is in no way related to this illusory world; it is the Hvara, as associated with Maya (nescience), that is responsible for the creation of this illusory world.(C) The Primordial Goddess #The next point to notice is that lord Niranjana, who personified the creative impulse of the Absolute, desired to create the universe and from the desire emanated the primor­dial goddess, who is called Adya or Adya-Sakti or Prakrti or simply the Devi. This also is a very well-known theory absorbing in it many traditions derived from various sources. Already in the Brhad-aranyakppanisat we find that in the beginning was the Atman and it became self-conscious and from its self-consciousness proceeded ‘Egohood’—(aham- namabhavat). It never enjoyed, and as it was not possible to enjoy all alone it longed for a companion ; it then divided its own self into two as the male and the female, or as the husband and the wife, and from their union proceeded the creation. In another place of the same text we find that theAtman was alone in the beginning. Desir- !^thuna.m°r<Jial ous of issues the Atman wished to have • a wife.2 These two aspects of the Brahman as the male and the female have been variously* Bfhad-Sranyako ( 1 . 4 . 1 — 3 > .« Ib id ( 1.4 .17 ) ."},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"3 8 0OBSCURE RELIGIOUS CULTSconceived in the Upanisads. Here (in the Brhad-aranyaka), for instance, the mind is said to be the self (atma), speech the wife {vag jay a) and life (prana) is the issue. In the Prasno- panisat we find that Prajapati, desirous of progeny, had recourse to penance and produced the couple (mithuna) and the couple consisted of Rayi (matter) and Prana (the vital force),—the Sun is the Prana and the moon is the Rayi\\ In the Bahtircopanisat (which, however, is undoubtedly a text of much later time) it is said that in the beginning was the Goddess (Devi); she created the egg of the world,—and from her were born the gods like Brahma, Visnu and Siva.Though, however, the theory of the female counterpart of the original Lord in connection with cosmogony may be traced back even to the days of the Upanisads, this idea, as found in the Paranic literature as also in the vernacular litera­ture, seems to have been influenced more by popular Samkhya ideas. Notwithstanding the controversies of the . philosophers as to the exact nature of Purusa and Prakrti and the exact relation between them, the general view is that the _ , , „ ,, whole creation proceeds from Prakrti (orPrakjti ol Ssmkhya. . . *the primordial cosmic substance) in contact with Purusa, who is the unchanging principle of pure consciousness. Though some schools of Samkhya hold that creation proceeds from the spontaneous disturbance in the equilibrium of the three qualities in Prakrti, the more general view is that the creative impulse is supplied to Prakrti by Purusa through his contact just as active power is supplied to inactive iron by magnet through its contact (sannidhya). Through the association or the contact of Purusa with Prakrti the character of the one is infused in the other and the creative process follows as a result of the process of infusion. From this philosophical idea of the association of Purusa and Prakrti and the infusion of the1 Prainopanifat, (I. 4-5),"},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"COSMOGONICAL AND COSMOLOGICAL THEORIES 3 8 1character of the one into the other in the process of creation has followed the popular tendency to conceive of Purusa as the male and of Prakrti as the female and of their contact as their union, through which proceeds the visible world.. It may be remarked that philosophers also have sometimes taken the analogy of the male and the female in explaining the nature of and the relation between Purusa and Prakrti.The cosmic process, however, proceeds from Prakrti. Prakrti is constituted by nature of three qualities (guna), viz., sattVa or the intelligence-stuff, rajas or energy and tamas or inertia. So long as there is the equilibrium of the three gunas in Prakrti there is no cosmic process;—the cosmic process follows from the disturbance in the nature of Prakrti. From the disturbance in Prakrti first follows the principle of Mahat or Buddhi, which is “the last limit up to which the subjective and the objective can be assimilated as one indistinguishable point which is neither the one nor the other, but which is the sources of them.”1 From Mahat follows the principle of ‘egohood’ (ahankara), which in its turn generates the eleven senses oh the one hand and the five TanmatrQs (i.e., the five potentials of the five gross elements) on the other. From these five Tanmatras again follow the five gross elements of earth, water, fire, air and ether. These principles of Purusa, Prakrti, Mahat, Ahankara, the eleven senses, the five TanmStras and the five gross elements taken together constitute the twenty-five TattVas or principles of Samkhya metaphysics.The Gita, the most popular religio-philosophical literature of India, echoes the Samkhya view of cosmology in a rather popular and synthetic way. There we find the idea of the Absolute (which is known as the Purusottama), which approximates the unqualified Brahman of the Vedanta;2 but in the active and .qualified aspect (i.e., as the BhagaVan) He1 The Study of Patafijali, by Dr. S.

The primordial goddess, originating from the sweat, or the smile of lord Dharma (or Nirafijana, or the Adi-deva) has frequently been styled as Prakrti,2 and the idea of Prakrti brought with it the ideas of the gunas, which were transformed and personified as the triad.

This, however, represents the general and popular Samkhya view of the contact of Purusa with Prakrti and the creation of the world through the activities of the three qualities of Prakrti. We have seen that according to the version given in the Dharmayana of Narasimha Vasu the son born to Prakrti by Niranjana was Mahat, and from Mahat originated Ahatpkara and the three gunas. In the version, found in the Candt-mangala of j Mukunda-rama also we find that through the infusion of the energy of the Lord in Prakrti a son of the name of Mahat was born to them, the son of Mahat was Ahamkara, who again had five sons who represent the five gross elements.1 For specimens of discussions on cosmogony and cosmology in the PurSnic and such other popular literatures see B hagavata-purana, (3.5. 23-38) ; G aruda- purana (PurVa-khanda, Ch.

The Lord and the goddess have then been conceived in the vernaculars as the Adi-deva and the Adi-devl. Sometimes they have been conceived as the Adi and the Anadi; the Lord is the beginningless eternal One *, while the Goddess, emanating from the body of the Lord, is the produced one. The creation, however, proceeds from the Adi-devl, and the Adi-deva returns to his meditation after the goddess has been created. In this theory of the Adi-deva and the Adi-devl the vernaculars seem to have been more influenced by the Saiva and Sakta ideas (as they are found in the Saiva and Sakta texts and in the Tantras in general) than by the Samkhya theory of Purusa and Prakrti.We have already pointed out that thoughThe conceptions of i r-% 1 n i »• £the Adi-deva and the in a popular way rurusa and rrakrti ot thefut™eandftW n « p ‘ Samkhya system have somehow been in°the°fTantrard S5kti related together in the process of cosmicevolution, metaphysically they are two distinct and self-sufficient realities and it is because of the distinct nature of Purusa and Prakrti that various contro­versies have arisen as to the exact nature of the relation.

The absolute truth is a union of Siva and Sakti. Siva represents pure consciousness which is inactive— the static aspect of the ultimate reality;—while Sakti represents the world-force—the dynamic aspect of the ultimate reality; Siva is ,Nivrtti (state of rest) and Sakti is Praortti (the state of activity) and in the ultimate state they remain in a union of oneness.

Siva, however, realises himself through Sakti, and, therefore, it is said that Sakti is the clear looking-glass in which the form and beauty of Siva is reflected. The philosophical im­plication is that pure abstract thought cannot realise its own nature unless it comes back to itself through its own activity, and when thus it returns to itself through dimarsa, it becomes ‘egohood ’ or aham\\dra, which is called the mass produced through the union of Siva and Sakti ’ ’ (siva-sakti-mithuna- pinda).2 In the gross sense this Siva is the white-matter (sita-bindu) or seed or semen, while Sakti is the red-matter (sona-bindu), and I-ness or egohood is the son born to them. This conception of Siva and Sakti has also been interpreted as matter and energy, which are the two essential component parts of all entity. In everything that exists there must be two things,—that which exists and the power or energy by virtue of which it exists or acts; this matter that exists is the Siva and the energy of existence is Sakti 8 and there is an inseparable relation between them, the one cannot be without the other.

Though in many places we find that the one absolute truth divides itself into two aspects asSiva and Sakti and manifests itself in the world-process and realises itself through it, yet in other places we find that Siva manifests his power in the form of Sakti only for the purpose of self-realisation,—for, the universal abstract thought-principle cannot realise its ownself without the conscious activities in the form of the world-process.2 But . whether Sakti be contained in the nature of Siva, or, Siva and Sakti be the two aspects of the absolute reality, Sakti is directly responsible for the creation of the visible world— either as the energy (i.e., the world-force), or as the principle of illusion (maya) as she is known in the popular Vedantic line of thought. It is because of this that we find in the verna­culars that before the actual cosmological process begins the original goddess comes out of the body of the Lord and herself creates the whole universe. The emanation of the Sakti in the form of a woman from the body of the Lord is to be frequently met with in the Puranic and Tantric texts, and there is no doubt that this idea was received by all the vernacular poets through^the Puranas and the Tantras.

At that time there was only Prakrti as the supreme reality. When there was the desire for creation in her, she, though formless, assumed the form of a goddess and at once created a personality with the three gunas she had within her; but the person (Purusa) was without consciousness. She then infused her own creative inpulse in that Purusa and the Purusa thus endowed with power created three personalities of the name of Brahma, Visnu and Siva, who were of the nature of the three gunas.6 The idea of thei (10.61. 5-7).

This absolute ultimate substance have two elements in it, Sunyata and Karuna, or Prajna and Upaya. Cosmologically Prajna is pure consciousness and perfect enlightenment, and is the principle of pure passivity; Upaya is the world-force,—it is the dynamic principle, through the activities of which the phenomenal world comes into existence. The metaphysical implication is that Sunyata as perfect enlightenment or pure consciousness is purely inactive; it is the principle of universal compassion that disturbs her and causes waves of mentation in that pure consciousness and these waves of mentation are fundamentally responsible for the existence of the phenomenal world.

It is clear to see, that this cos-UpSya.mological and ontological significance of Prajna and Upaya are exactly the same as that of Siva and Sakti, and, as we have already noticed, the only difference is that pure consciousness, which is absolutely’passive by nature and represents the negative aspect of the reality, is conceived as the Lord in the Hindu schools, and it is conceived as the goddess in Buddhism; and whereas the active or the positive element is the goddess according to the Hindu view, it is the Lord according to the Buddhist view. But notwithstanding this difference in notion, Prajna and Upaya have throughout been drawn in the image of Siva and Sakti. As in the Hindu Tantras Siva and Sakti are conceived of sometimes as constituting the two aspects of one absolute reality,—but sometimes again Siva is in many places depicted as the absolute reality, Sakti being included in his nature;—so also is the case with Prajna and Upaya,—sometimes they are explained as two aspects of the one reality, and sometimes, Prajna being the absolute reality, Upaya is said to be included in her nature. But in either case the relation between the two is inseparable as is in the case of Siva and Sakti.These conceptions of Prajna and Upaya have important ontological and cosmological bearing on the four schools of Nepalese Buddhism.1 The Svabhavika school holds that there is no immaterial ultimate truth in the form of the soul substance; matter is the primordial substance, from which the world proceeds. This matter as the ultimate substance1 T h e f o u r s c h o o l s a r e : — ( i ) S v S b h f i v i k a , ( i f ) A i S v a r i k a , {iii) K a r m i k a a n d ( i t ? ) Y s t n i k a ."},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"COSMOGONICAL AND COSMOLOGICAL THEORIES 393has two modes which are called Pravrtti and Nivrtti, actionand rest, dynamic and static, concrete Nepaf^^uddhHm!\" and abstract. Matter is eternal as a crudemass (however infinitely attenuated in Nivrtti) and so are the powers of matter-. The proper state of existence of these powers is the state of Nivrtti or rest as the abstraction from all phenomena. When these powers pass from the state of rest into their causal and transitory state of activity the phenomenal world comes into existence, and it again ceases to exist when the powers repass from Pravrtti to Nivrtti. This Nivrtti is the Prajna1 and Pravrtti is the Upaya. We have seen that Prajna and Upaya are deified as the Adi-prajna and the Adi-buddha, and the visible world is said to be created through their union. Buddha as the principle of active power first proceeds from Nivrtti or Adi-prajna and then associates with her and from their union proceeds the actual visible world. The principle is symbolised as Prajna being first the mother and then the wife of the Buddha. The well-known triad—Buddha, Dharma and Sangha—has often been explained, as we have seen, as Upaya (Buddha), Prajna (Dharma) and the world (Sangha) produced through the union. In some of the Nepalese schools of Buddhism Prajna as Dharma is given the highest prominence in the scheme of the triad and Buddha emanates from Prajna. In some of the Hindu Tantras also we find that the godde83 has been given more prominence than the Lord, the former being conceived as the first principle. In some places, it has been pointed out, the primordial Lord is seen floating in water. What is this water?

Again the Lord symbolises the generative power while the lady symbolises the productive power. The Lord is the seed (bindu) and the lady is the ovum (rajas),— and from their union proceeds the Bodhicitta, from which everything is born. The Adi-prajna or the Adi-sakti is also spoken of as of the triangular form (tri-\\ona}^ara, which is the symbol of the productive power) as she is described in the Hindu Tantras also.From the above it will be clear that, in the conception of the Adi-deva and the Adi-devl of the vernaculars (or of the Adi and the Anadi as we find in the Nath literature), we find a popular mixture of Purusa and Prakrti of the Samkhya system, of Siva and Sakti as we find in Tantricism in general, and the Adi-buddha and the Adi-prajna of the different schools of later Buddhism.

We have also hinted that in the religious tenets as well as in the literary representation of the mediaeval saints the form and spirit of Safi-istic literature acted strongly against the Sahajiya background. We have seen how in the case of the Bauls the spirit of Sufi-ism acted on the spirit of the Sahajiyas and other devotional schools. In point of time some of the Saint-poets of upper, central and northern India flourished earlier than the Bauls of Bengal, and many of them were contemporary with, if not earlier than the Vaisnava Sahajiyas of Bengal. When, therefore, we speak of the Sahajiya background of these non-Bengali mediaeval poets, we mean the Buddhist Sahajiyi movement in particular. A study of the poems of these mediaeval poets, particularly of the poems of Kablr, decidedly the most prominent figure of the middle age, will reveal that there is a clear line of continuity from the Buddhist Sahajiya poets to the mediaeval poets. But the difference between the earlier school and the mediaeval schools lies in the element of love and devotion, which is conspicuous by its absence in the Buddhist Sahajiyi school. This element of love and devotion was supplied profusely to the mediaeval schools by the different devotional movements as well as by Sufi-ism.

But inspite of this difference the general similarity in spirit, in literary form and sometimes even in language, is indeed striking. Let us now demonstrate our contention point by point. As, however, we are not attempting here any comprehensive study of the religion §nd literature of these mediaeval Saint-poets, but dealing with them in relation to the Bengali literature, only those points will be touched that directly concern our early and mediaeval literature.(i) The Spirit of Revolt and CriticismWe have seen how heterodoxy—a spirit of revolt and criticism—characterises the religion and literature of the Buddhist Sahajiyas. We have seen that the same spirit of heterodoxy characterises the religion and literature also of the Sufis. This spirit may be recognised as a salient feature of the mediaeval Saint-poets as a whole. In connection with the analysis of the different lines of heterodoxy in the religious history of India we pointed out that elements of love and devotion have often inspired heterodoxy in the religious schools and that these elements of love and devotion influenced the revolutionary spirit of the mediaeval saints to a great extent.1 To begin with, we may consider the religious views of Kabir as expressed in his poems, songs and couplets- At least one-third of the literature of Kabir (which is fairly large) is devoted* to criticism against the orthodox Hindus and Muslims. As a religious apostle Kabir was neither a Hindu nor a Muslim and criticised both the com­munities unreservedly. He says,—“ The Hindus have died by worshipping the gods and the Turks have died by going on pilgrimage ; the yogins have died by matting hair,—none of them have got at the truth.” 2 Against caste system1 Vide supra, Ch.

If birth from Brahmin mother makes you Brahmin, why did you not come by another way? If birth from a Turk mother makes you Turk, why were you not circumcised in the womb ? If you milk black and yellow cows together, will you be able to distinguish their milk ? ” 1 Against metaphysi­cal erudition and the recital of the sacred scriptures the criticism of Kablr whs equally strong. He says that people read the four Vedas, but none makes any enquiry about the Lord ; the truth has teen discovered by Kablr, and the Pundits are searching the field in vain.2 The world is dying of reading books,—yet none have beconjp the real Pundit,— if a single letter of the Dear One be learnt, a man becomes a really learned one.!!

The resemblance is not only in spirit, but often also in language and imagery. Like Saraha-pada2 Kabir also says,—“ What are the naked,—whfat are the mendicants with skins, if they do not know the true nature of the self ? If one becomes a yogin by roaming about naked, why should not the deer of the forest be liberated ? If perfection can be attained by shaving head, why should not the sheep „enter heaven ? . . . . Says Kabir, hear O brother,—none have attained salvation without the name of Rama.8 The Pundits know the Agamas, all sciences and grammars,—Tantra, Mantra and Medicine they know,—yet they die at the end. The yogins, the ascetics, the observers of penances and the Sannyasins wander about in many a sacred place; those, who are with their hair plucked out, with shaven heads, the silent ones and those with plaited hair—all these die at the end.

If by immersion in the water salvation be obtained, the frogs bathe continually. As the frogs, so are these men, again and again they fall into the womb.” 2The revolutionary lead that was thus given by Kabir in the early middle period of the vernacular literature was vigorously carried out by a host of poets that followed, and the current still flows on. Dadu of the sixteenth century may be said to have been the worthiest successor of Kablr. He says,—“ The Pundits have bound the world by the net-work of illusion and Karma (various activities); a good preceptor is rarely found, who can show the real path. They speak of the sinful path,, believe in illusion and Karma,—none points to the perfectly pure One (Niranjana) who is very near to us.” 3 Worship by love is the real worship,—that is the best kind of prayer; such love involves no activities whatso­ever, neither should there be any fixed time and place for it; throughout the whole life—in all moments we may worship the Lord through our incessant flow of love. Dadu says,— “ For decency’s sake people (the Muslims) fast, invite others for prayer and offer prayer ; the business of Dadu is with the Lord (Sahib), in what path should he walk ? Why this grief, O Dadu,—stand before the Lord every day and every moment, and let your invocation (azan) be there where the Lord is in His true naturfe.” ' The Muslims cut the throat of others and compel them to profess their religion; five times daily do they offer their prayer, but there is no sincere faith1 Kabir-granthavali PadaVdh N o . 248. 4* K abir a n d the K abir P a n th, b y R e v .

He, who destroys the body and mind and unites with the Lord, and controls himself through the divine realisation, is the teal Awliya Pir (i.e., preceptor of the Muslim Awliya sect).1 Like Kabir Dadu also repudiated communalism and sectarianism in the strongest possible words. He says,—“ The Hindus say,— ‘ mine is the real path.’ The Turks say—‘ mine.’ Say, where the path for the Alekha (Skt. ala^sya = invisible) may at all be,—He has been realised without a path.

It has been held there that truth is a flash of light, which is infused from the preceptor into the disciple just as one candle is lighted from another burning candle.

We have further seen that it is a salient feature also of Sufi-ism. We have seen how in the Buddhist Tantras all the metaphysical principles with all their corol­laries were discovered within the body and how all the sacred mountains, rivers and places of pilgrimage have been located within the physical organism. It has been observed that in the case of the Buddhist Sahajiyas this spirit of regarding the body as the abode of all truth is not a pure and simple case of inheritance from Tantricism; in many placed the influence of Upanisadic mysticism is also palpable. In this aspect also the spirit of the mediaeval Hindi and Bengali literature is strikingly similar to that of the Buddhist Sahajiya school.

A study of the poems of Kabir will reveal that Kabir had a yogic system of his own involving the theory of the lotus or plexus, the nervous system and the control of the vital wind.1 We find here the two* important nerves in the left and the right, most commonly known as the Ida and Pingala, as the moon and the sun, or the Ganga and the Jamuna.2 The meeting place of the three nerves Ida, Pingala and Susumna is, as usual, described here as the tri-veni (i.e., the meeting of the three courses). 8 The middle nerve susumna has always been spoken of (like the Buddhist Sahajiyas) as the path to Sahaja or vacuity (sahaja sunya),4 and the yoga has always been described as Sahaja yoga and the final state as Sahaja- samadhi or Sahaja-sunya.

Like the Buddhist poet Saraha-pada Kabir also says—Within the form resides the formless, his whereabouts are known to none. Musk is there in the navel cavity, yet the dear is roaming about in the forest (in search of it); exactly in the same way, Rama is residing within every body, but the world does not perceive. The Lord is residing within the body, through illusion none knows Him,—just as the musk-deer smells the grass of the forest and roams about.2 Again he says,—“In the lake of the body there is a lotus without parallel, and on it resides the Supreme Being of supreme lustre—of Him there is neither any sign or form.’1 3 We have seen that the Buddhist Sahajiyas have declared that all the sacred rivers, sacred mountains, places of pilgrimage are within this body, and they localised them within the body.4 Kabir also says,—“Within the heart are the Ganges and the Jumna and there is the ghat (bathing step) of Sahaja sunya and Kabir has erected his temple there.” 5 Again Kabir says that the mind is Muttra, heart Dvaraka and the body is the temple of ten gates and lustre shines within.61 See Ch.

As in the case of the Bauls of Bengal, the conception of the ultimate reality of these mediaeval Hindi poets represents a synthesis between the conception of the reality held by the earlier Sahajiya school and that of the Supreme Beloved held in Sufl-ism and the then prevalent other devotional schools of India. The ultimate reality being thus conceived as the Supreme Beloved, Sahaja has often been identified with Rama, where Rama stands for the Divine Personality as the indwelling principle, with whom it is possible to have relations of love. The Santa-poets flourished mostly before the Bauls of Bengal; historically, therefore, it seertls that the synthesis between the Sahajiya movement and the Sufi-movement was brought about first by the poets of Northern and Upper India. The same contingency that was responsible for bringing about such a synthesis in Northern and Upper India was responsible for effecting a similar synthesis also in Bengal.Speaking about Sahaja Kabir says,—“All speak of the Sahaja,—but none knows what Sahaja actually is. That is really Sahaja, through which a man leaves off all his objects of desire,—that is called Sahaja, which keeps the five (senses) well-controlled,—that is really Sahaja, in which the son, the wife, all wealth and desire remain merged together, and in which Kabir becomes the maid of Rama; that is really Sahaja, through which the Lord is realised in a natural way.M1 Like their predecessors the mediaeval poets also emphasised the unspeakable nature of Sahaja, which is the Lord (Sami) or Rama with them. Though Kabir, Dadu, Nanak and other Hindi poets of the Nirguna-school often speak of the Lord or of R?ma and Krsna and frequently conceive themselves as the maid of the Lord (and as a matter of fact1 Kabir.gran thuvali, pp. 41-42.53—141 IB(io) The conception of Sahaja"},{"pageNumber":473,"pageContent":"4 1 8OBSCURE RELIGIOUS CULTSthere is a considerable number of such poems in Kabir, Dado and even in the Sikh poet Nanak who preached the religion of the Alefyh), it will be a mistake to think that these poets believed in any particular incarnation of God; it has been repeatedly declared by these poets that the Lord or Rama or Krsna is no historical being,—neither is he the incarnation of God; He is the Divine Being, the ultimate formless reality— the non-dual all pervading reality, conceived more as imma­nent than as transcendent,—and that is the Sahaja of these poets. The ultimate state of bliss is frequently described by Kabir as the Sahaja-samadhi just like the Buddhist Sahajiyas.1 This state of Sahaja is to be attained through the final arrest of the functions of the mind,2—and this Sahaja is the state of vacuity and hence it is often called the sum sahaja.8 This Sahaja is a non-dual state of supreme bliss (sulpha or mahasukha).4The same description of Sahaja is to be found in the poems of Dadu.

Thanks are due to the scholarly enthusiasnf and literary taste of Dr. Grierson, who, when a civilian in the district of Rangpur in North-Bengal, collected for the first time some versions of the songs concern­ing Manik-candra and his son Gopl-candra or Govinda-candra. In course of the narration of the eventful stories of the royal family the poets described the supernatural power attained by some of the Naths, who are generally spoken of as the Siddhas or yogins who have attained perfection. The first publication of these narrative poems in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1878 under the caption of Manik-candra Rajar Gan (song of king Manik-candra) readily attracted the notice of the Bengali scholars to such narrative poems, generally sung by the illiterate villagers in the interiors of Bengal and different versions of the song were soon discovered in different parts of North-Bengal as well as of East-Bengal.11 Mr. 3ivnath Sil discovered a manuscript of one version of the song ascribed to the authorship of Durllabh Mailik and it was published in 1902 under the caption of Govinda-candra Git and in the sub-heading the text was described by the editor as embodying the doctrine of the Tantric Buddhists. Mr. ViSveSvar Bhattacarya soon collected a rather complete version of the song of Msnik-candra and Gopl-candra from the district of Rangpur.

There we find that the consort of Siva once became desirous of knowing the truth behind the world and entreated the lord to explain all secrets to her. Siva agreed and went with her to the bank of the sacred river Vallakfi, where he instructed her in all the secrets of the physical and spiritual life.

The Yogi-castes of Bengal1 somehow associate themselves with the Nath sect that spread almost throughout the whole length and breadth of India sometime during the tenth to twelfth century A.C.; and in fact, though the Yogis of Bengal are now being gradually assimilated within the composite fold of Hinduism, they retain some old social customs as the characteristic features of their caste. The Yogis (or rather the Jugis) generally sing these songs in accompaniment with a musical instrument known as the Gopi-yantra, which is a simple instrument made with the bottle-gourd, a bamboo stick and a string attached to them. 2 These songs, particularly the songs of Mina-nath and Gorakh- nath, are very popular also among the Muslims of East-Bengal and some of the versions of the story of Mina-nath and Gorakh-nath have been collected from them.8 The currency and popularity of such versified stories among the Muslims of Bengal has historical reasons behind it. The Muslims of1 The Yogis of Bengal are about four and a half lac in number and they reside mostly in East-Bengal and North-Bengal. As a caste they bear the title Nath with their name, and are mostly weavers, and sometimes dealers in betel-leaves and lime and sometimes cultivators. The Yogis generally bury the dead (though now-a-days they are adopting the purely Hindu process of cremating the dead with the Hindu ceremonials) and are in some places untouchables to the Caste Hindus.2 This is, however, a very popular musical instrument of Bengal. At tha suggestion of Sister Nivedita Dr. D. C. Sen was convinced of the fact that this Gopi-yantra owes its name to king Gopi-candra of the ballads; but we are not quite sure of the fact. Even at the present time the BSuls and other Vaisnava beggars of Bengal sing songs from door to door in accompaniment with this instrument.3 In the United Provinces the yogi singers are generally called Bhartharls or Bhartriharis. They sing the song of GopI-cSnd and Maigan-nath and the teachings of Bhartrhari. No Hindu domestic festival is complete unless these Bhartharls come and sing their songs. They use ochre coloured clothes of the Sannyasins. But they are by religion Mahomedans.

The stories of Gorakh-nath and Gopi-cand, at least the skeleton of such stories, had been, in all probability, current in Bengal (and not only in Bengal, but in many other parts of India) before the time of the conquest of Bengal by the Muslims in the thirteenth century. Such stories were, therefore, common heritage of the Muslims and the non-Muslims of Bengal. The gradual revival of Hinduism in, Bengal, however, introduced Sanskritic and Puranic stories among the public, and the mind of the Caste ■ Hindus readily responded to this Sanskritic and Puranic influence. As a result the popular vernacular stories were naturally pushed in the corner, and were preserved only by the Muslims and the low-class Hindus, who did not come directly under the pale of the Sanskritic and Puranic influence of revived Hinduism. Moreover, the Caitanya-movement.of Bengal over-flooded the soil of the province with innumerable Radha-Krsna songs and soon it became proverbial in Bengal that there is no song without Kanu (i.e., Krsna). So strong was this Vaisnava movement in Bengal and so immense was the lyrical appeal of the Radha-Krsna songs that its influence was felt even by the low-class illiterate section of the Hindus. It is for all these reasons that the indigenous vernacular songs of Bengal, such as the songs of the Nath literature, practically became obsolete among the Hindus and they are preserved as an ancient heritage largely by the Bengali Muslims and sometimes by the people of the lower substrata of the Hindu community. It may also be noted in this connection that the Nath cult and the Nath literature of Bengal with its salient features have inspired the Muslims more than the Hindus in composing a large number of yOga-literature in Bengali.

In the course of its evolution Indian Sufl-ism was variously influenced by the different yoga systems of India,2 and it was for this reason that Sufi-istic Islam of India could easily compromise, or rather harmonise itself with the minor religious sects of India which have largely influenced the growth of moderji Indian literatures. The Muslim yogic literature of Bengal is but the out-come of such a compromise.Besides the stories of Gorakh-nath and Gopl-cand, stray songs of the Natha-gurus, emphasising the vanity of life and the pernicious effect of worldly enjoyment and stressing side by side the importance of yoga as the only path for escaping death and decay and for attaining liberation, are found among, the Yogis and the Muslims of North-Bengal and East-Bengal. Munshi Abdul Karim quotes a poem as a specimen in his introduction to the Goraksa-vijaya. The present writer had occasions to listen to such songs in the interior of the district of Baker- gunge, and such songs are invariably couched in an unintelligible enigmatic style, which generally characterises yogic songs in all the vernaculars of India. The enigmatic song in the Dharma-mangala of Sahadev Cakravarti 8 is a typical song of this class. The Naths became gods or demi-gods in later times in Bengal as well as in other parts of India, and such is specially the case with Gorakh-nath. There are many popular beliefs in the divinity of Gorakt- nath. A typical tale of this nature is associated with a custom of East-Bengal, which is known as the “paying off the debt of Gorakh.” Gorakh is here depicted as1 Vide introduction to Gorafea-vijaya by Munshi Abdul Karim.2 See Vafige SvTtphi-prabhaVa by Dr. Enamul Haq.3 Vide, B.S.PP, B.S. 1304."},{"pageNumber":485,"pageContent":"4 3 0OBsCURE RELIGIOUS CULTSthe cattle-god and Manik-plr is his disciple. The ceremony consists in offering milk-made sweetmeats to Gorakh and Manik. A song is sung in this connection, in which we find that Manik-plr, the Fakir (or the mendicant), comes to the house of Kalu-ghos with his usual cry of Vam, Vam (which is the general custom' with the yogi-mendicants); at the sound of Vam, Vam Kalu-ghos’s mother understands that the Fakir has come to beg for something,—and in consul* tation with the daughter of Beku Banu she offers the Fakir five pice .(in the name of the five Fakirs, or rather the five Plrs of the Muslims). Manik refuses to accept cash-payment and asks for milk curd ; but out of her foolishness Kalu’s mother deceives the Fakir and disappoints him. As a result thereof all the cows, calves and even the milk-maid of Kalu-ghos die within a very short time. Kalu’s mother realises her folly, solicits the mercy of the Fakir,—and the Fakir takes pity on her? strikes his stick against the ground with the usual sound of Vam, Vam and everything becomes all right instantaneously.1 In some places of North- Bengal Goraksa-nath is taken to be the god of the cow and songs are sung of him in an annual festival.2 In this transformation of Goraksa-nath to a cow-god the word goraksa was popularly confused to mean what the word go-raksaka (i.e. the protector of the cows) means and hence was probably the deification of Goraksa-nath to a god associated with the cow, as Mina-nath was with fish. The confused etymological meaning of the word goraksa seems to be responsible also for the tradition that Goraksa-nath was the son of Siva by a cow.8 There are the Punjabi and Nepalese traditions of Gorakh-nath’s being born in cow-1 Bamlar Sakti* vol. iii., No. 3.Cf. also:—Rajsahlr Sona-pirer Gan by Mr. S.

He went as a yogin to Radha’s house exclaiming the name of Gorakh and blow­ing the horn (as is the general custom with such yogins).2 We also find occasional references to Radha’s expressing the desire to assume the form of a yogirii with shaven head and rings in the ears (just like the yogiriis of the Kanaphat order) and to wander from place to place in quest of her lover Krsna.8It will not be out of place to say a few words about the time and authorship of the long narrative poems that cons­titute the main portion of Bengali Nath literature. As for the time of composition of'these poems what we can at most say is that the skeleton of the stories may be <§s old as the eleventh or the twelfth century; but surely the versions of the songs, which are available to us either in manuscript, or in the oral reproduction of the singers, are not very old. There is sometimes a tendency, however, to take account of the linguistic evidence in this connection ;1 Ibid, pp. 182-183.gorakh jag&ijafila bhikha ani dei 1 etc. Srt-sri-pada-kalpa-taru, edited by S.

It is difficult to determine at this late period of the history of our literature who the original composers of the songs of Gorakh-nath and Gopl-cand wpre ; but it seems that these songs were handed down from singer to singer from sometimes near about the twelfth century A.D. In course of such transmission the skeleton of the story was supplied with new flesh and blood by different singers and poets in different times and localities. Munehi Abdul Karim in his introduction to the Goraksa-Vijaya argues from the frequency and the prominence' of the name of Sekh Fayjulla in the colophons, and also from the evidence of some £ufl- istic Islamic influence in the version of the Goraksa-Vijaya, that Sekh Fayjulla is the original poet of the Goraksa-Vijaya. But it seems that all the poets, including Sekh Fayjulla himself, received some versions' of the poem from earlier sources and to the version they fteceived they made sufficient additions and alterations.The Nath literature of Bengal, far from being an isolated phenomenon, is closely connected with the history of the Nath literature of most of the Indo-Aiyan vernaculars, viz., Panjabi, Marathi, Midland Hindi and Eastern Hindi and also Odiya.

Songs of Gopi- cand, similar to those that are found in Bengal, are current as popular folk-lore also in Magahi and in the Bhoj-puri dialect.2The historical reason for this wide-spread popularity of the Nath literature throughout India is that the Nath move­ment was, and still is, an all-Indian movement. The followers of this sect, who are now best known as the Kanphat yogins (because of the peculiar custom of having the ears pierced through before being initiated into the order and also of wearing ear-rings) are found widely scattered all over India. They are occasionally met with separately as wandering mendicants in towns and villages and also in groups in their headquarters. Such Yogins are found abundantly in the Northern Deccan, in the Central Provinces, in Gujrat and Maratha, in U. P., Bihar and Bengal, and also in some Himalayan regions, particularly in Nepal.

It is for this reason that literary accounts of Gorakh-nath *s life and activities are found in almost all parts of India. Another point to note is that, though the Kanphat Yogins have their quarters and headquarters, where they generally reside in groups, the custom of going on long pilgrimage to the sacred places scattered all over the country is very popular among them, and it is natural that with thehr long wanderings they have spread the legends and traditions of their sect to all parts of the country, and this may be recognised as a plausi­ble exaplanation for the inter-mingling of the stories and and traditions.

The story of Gorakh-nath runs as follows :—At the time of the creation of the universe Siva came out of the mouth of the primordial Lord in the form of a Yogin with matted hair and ear-rings; Mina-nith was born as a Siddha and from the bone (hada) of the Lord was bom Hadiphfi (i.e., Jalandharipa); from the ear (Jjarna) of the Lord was born KanphiS, and Gorakh-nath with his long hanging bag of mystic importance (siddha-jhuli) and his outer garment of patched cloth {pantha) came from the matted hair of the Lord. A beautiful girl of the name of Gauri was the mother ©f the world. The Lord then asked some one of the Yogins (including Siva, who here represents none but Adi-nath, traditionally said to be the original Nath of the Nith cult) to accept Gauri as his wife, to which all bent their heads in disapproval. At the sugges­tion of the Lord then Siva or. Hara accepted Gauri and came down on earth with her, and all the Siddhas followed them. Mina-nath and Hadipha became attendants of (i.e., disci­ples of) Hara-Gauri, Gorakh became the attendant of Mina-nath and Kanphi of Hadipha, and all of these began to practise austere yoga. Then Gauri wanted to know from her Lord the supreme truth (tattoa). For this purpose both the Lord and his consort repaired to the Ksiroda sea where there was a small beautiful castle xaised on the surface of water (tangi). There the Lord began to explain to his consort all the secret truths, but the goddess fell asleep. Mina-nath, however, in the form of a fish (mina) lay beneath the castle and heard all truth from the mouth of the ’Lord. The Lord came to know of it and cursed Mina-nith saying that there would be a time when he would forget all Tattva.Thereafter once in Kailasa the goddess proposed to Siva that the Siddhas should marry and lead a domestic life; but the 1 .ord replied that the Siddhas were perfect yogins"},{"pageNumber":492,"pageContent":"APPENDIX (b)4 3 7and above all worldly emotions. The goddess then proposed to put the Siddhas to a test in the form of a beautiful damsel. All the Siddhas, excepting Gorakh, fell victims to the amorous charm of the goddess and every one except Gorakh felt within a desire to enjoy her,—and the desire of the Siddhas was all approved of by her.1 Mina-nath, as he desired, was destined for the land of Kadall, where he would keep company to the amorous girls of the land; Hadipha was destined for the country of MayanamafI, where he would serve as a sweeper and enjoy the company of Mayanamati, the queenrand Kanpha was destined for the city of Dihuka. Consequently Mina-nath, the great yogin, went to the country of Kadall, where he got enamoured with six hundred women and was passing his days with them in erotic dalliances.2 Gorakh-nath,\"however, came to know of the sad and shameful plight of his Guru and entered the city of Kadali as a dancing girl. In course of his dancing and singing Gorakh rebuked the preceptor in enigmatic words (so that the women of the country could make no sense out of them) and also explained to him the importance and1 Here we find that the goddess adopted all the vilest means to seduce Gorakh hut was sadly defeated in all her attempts. Similar legends are also found in the Dharma-mangalas, where the goddess tries to captivate the mind of the hero Lfiusen by her charm of body in the form of a beautiful woman; but Llusen, like Gorakh, could put the goddess to shame by the strength of his character.2 In the Dharma-mangalas also we find mention of such a country inhabited mainly by women full of carnal desire and it was only through the grace o Lord Dharma that the hero LSusen could get the upper hand over all the allurements. The country is called in the Nath literature the Kadatir DeSa. Various attempts have been made to identify this land of Kadall, the general tendency being to identify itr with Kama-rupa, which is noted as one of the original centres of Tantricism, and the yoni-p!tha of the Goddess But we should also consider another fact in this connection. In the Sanskrit dramas we find occasional reference to the Kadalbgfha (i.e., a house in the plantain garden) of the kings for love-making with women other than the married ones. The tradition is also continued in the Bengali Madgala-kSvyas, where ordinary women, ‘assemble<3 on the occasion of any marriage ceremony get enamoured with the beauty of the bridegroom and wishes to hav? him allured in the Kofttokm (plantain garden).

He had many wives, including Mayanamaii, the daughter of Tilak-candra. To avoid family quarrels Mayana was decreed to live separately in the city of Pherusa away from the royal family. In the reign of the pious king the happiness and prosperity of the people knew no bounds; but unfortunately a tyrant with a long beard hailed from East-Bengal and occupied the post of Minister for Revenue. His oppression soon led the subjects to join together in worshipping Dharma with mystic religious rites with a view to putting the king to death. The attempt of the people became fruitful and the , future longevity of the king was reduced from eighteen years to six months. Citra Govinda (i.e., Citra-gupta, the record- keeper of the king of death and also something like a personal assistant) opened his record-book and issued summons to the king and Goda-yama was sent to bring the life (pmna) of the king.

Mayana felt that if Gopi-cand was thus allowed to plunge into worldly enjoyment he would soon die at the age of eighteen. She proposed the king’s renunciation of all wealth and beauty, and the acceptance of Hadipa as his Guru after taking the vow of a yogin. The king first refused the proposal stoutly and indignantly, and he even went so far as to suspect the character of his mother in connection with Hadipa. The mother was shocked and Gorakh, her Guru, cursed Gopi-cand for uttering such calumny against his mother and decreed afflictions during the period of his Sannydsa. The queen-mother, however, made fresh attempts to convince her son of the vanity of the world and-the excellence of the immortal life, which can be attained only through renunciation and yoga.

According to some of the versions the king, at the instance of the queens, dug a hole under the floor-of the stabje where Hadipa was buried alive; the Siddha resorted to his yogic power and remained absorbed in yogic meditation for a long time and wa3 later on rescued by his disciple Kanupa.1 Mayana also asked the Hadi-siddha to demon­strate his supernatural power of yoga before her son and the Siddha performed urfbelievable miracles and thereby commanded respect and obeisance from the king. The king ultimately accepted Hadipa as his preceptor, renounced the world at the age of eighteen, 2 got his head shaved and ears split, bore the beggar’s Jhuli and the patched outer garment (k&ntha) and took to the vow of the yogin. The Guru, however, put the disciple under various trials and tribulations through his magical power, and the worst of all was that the new yogin was sold to a prostitute of the name of Hlra, who compelled him (the king) to serve her as the humblest menial as a punishment for his refusal to yield to her amorous desires. However, the king bore all these trials with infinite patience and implicit obedience towards the Guru.

Various accounts, mostly, legendary in nature, are found about these important personalities; let us give a brief sketch of them in the following pages.c(i) Mina-nathIn all the traditions about the Naths, Mina-nath or Matsyendra-nath figures as the first of the human Gurus. In many of the standard texts on yoga Matysendra-nath has been saluted as the Adi-guru. In the yogic texts the names of Matsyendra, Goraksa, Jalandhara, Cauranghi and others are commonly found as the stalwarts of Hatha-yoga, and some yogic practices are specially associated with the names of some of these yogins.1 References to Mina-nath and Goraksa-nath and some other Nathas are also found in some of the Tantric texts.2 Mina-nath and Matsyendra-nath (with all the other variants of the. name)3 seem to have been identical, and they came to be two perhaps in course of time.

Abhinava-gupta in his Tantraloka speaks of Macchanda-vibhu and explains it as one who tears the fetters of bondage.1 Prof. Tucci cites one instance from Durjaya-candra’s commentary on Catus- pitha-tantra, where prajna is spoken of as makara-mina.2 In the Hindi text Gorakh-sar (which is a loose Hindi transla­tion of the Goraksa-sataka)8 Machamdara has been explained as one who has controlled his mind, who has known the truth of the six Cakras (nerve-plexus), and who shines in the unflickering lustre of his soul.4 Traditionally, however, Mina-nath has variously been associated with fish, and that perhaps because of his name (as Gorakh-nath is with the cow, Kukkun-pada with the dog, and so on).

In Bengali Nath literature we find occasional reference to another disciple of Matsyendra of the name of Gabhur-siddha.1 We have discussed before the Bengali legend of the down-fall of the great yogin Mina-nath being seduced by the women of the country of Kadali. The'mstory has its variant in the story of Matsyendra-nath being captivated by the two queens of Ceylon (Sangal). The yogin was leading a domestic life in the company of the queens and was ultimately dispovcred by his disciple Gorakh, who entered the palace as a fly.2 Matsyendra then left Ceylon, but took with him the two sons, viz., Paros-nath and Nim-nath, who were born to them, and the two sons became the founders of the Jain religion. 3 According to the Nepalese and Tibetan traditions, as we have noted before, Matsyendra-nath is identified with Lui-pa, who is regarded as the Adi-guru among the Buddhist Siddhacaryas. As S. Levi describes in his Le Nepal, Matsyendra is identified with Avalokitesvara Padma-pani. There is the legend that Goraksa once came to Nepal in search of his Guru Matsyendra; but as the mountain was difficult of access he had recourse to the stratagem of binding the nine nagas # under a turtle and sat on them. Consequently, the sky becoming cloudless, there was drought in the valley for long twelve years. Then Bandhu-datta, the Guru of Narendra-deva, the then King of Nepal, went to mount Kapotala with the king to bring Avalokitesvara or Matsyendra. They propitiated Matsyendra with worship. Avalokitesvara was then cleverly brought to Nepal, imprisoned in the form of a black bee and installed1 Cf. ek sisya yache mor jati gorakhat 1ara sisya ache mor gabhur siddhai II Gorak&a-vijaya, p0 130.Agnin, *mithu kale na dekhilam gabhur sidhar mukh II Ibid, p. 116.2 In the Bengali legend he entered the city of Kadah as a dancing girl.3 Vide Dr. Bagchi’s Introduction io Kaula-jnana~nirnayat p. 15; Briggs, p. 233.

There then followed rain in abundance and thus the country was saved. The Brahminical version, however, narrates the story somewhat differently. Once Goraksa-nath went to Nepal, but he got offended with the people of the country as he was not warmly received. He imprisoned the clouds and put them under his seat for twelve years ; consequently there was drought and famine. Fortunately Matsyendra chanced to come to Nepal at the time and, while the Guru was passing by, Goraksa stood up to show him respect and thus the clouds were let loose and there was rain in abundance, which saved the whole country. Matsyendra thus in the form of Avalokitesvara Padma-pani commands universal respect in Nepal still to the present time and is still worshipped in the land with much reverence.1 There is the celebrated annual procession oj Ratha yatra (a procession with Matsyendra as Avalokitesvara on a decorated chariot) in honour of this popular god. 2 Matsyendra has, however, been deified in later times in many other places and the images of Matsyendra andlhis favourite disciple Goraksa are found in some shrines of the Nathists,—and the foot-print of these two demi-gods are also worshipped in some places by the Kanphat yogins. The* peculiar custom of having the ears split is also sometimes traditionally believed to have been introduced by Matsyendra-nath and many are the legends that are associated with such a tradition. There is another tradition which makes Matsyendra-nath the founder of Kama- rupa-mahapltha of tfie so-called Arddha-trayambaka-matha, which represents the fourth or Kaula order of Tantric worship. Again there is a legend recorded in the Goraksa-\\imaya-sara, which makes Matsyendra-nath identical with Maha Visnu1 According to the Nepalese tradition Mina-nath is the younger brother of Matsyendra and is worshipped almost with equal pomp.2 For a detailed description of this procession and other religious functions in Nepal in honour of Matsyendra see Briggs, pp. 144-145, pp. 23!* et seq."},{"pageNumber":502,"pageContent":"APPENDIX (c)4 4 7Sanga, whom some scholars are inclined to identify (though on insufficient ground) with the old Visnu-svamLAttempts have been made to fix up the approximate time of Matsyendra. The time of his advent has been held in the Nepalese tradition synchronous with the reign of Narendra- deva, who flourished in the seventh century A.D., but as the alleged synchronism cannot be historically relied upon because of the extremely mythical nature of the whole tradi­tion, the time of Matsyendra cannot be fixed up with reference to it. Dr. P. C. Bagchi, however, has attempted to fix the date sometime in the tenth century with reference to the date of the manuscript of the Kaula-jnana-nirnaya. The mention of Matsyendra (as Macchanda) by Abhinava-gupta, who lived towards the beginning of the eleventh century approximately confirms this date. Again the tradition of the identity of Matsyendra with Lui-pa (who flourished in the terith century)1 will also put Matsyendra to the same century. The time of Gopi-cand will also ascribe some such time to Matsyendra. 2 Many of the traditions taken together will strengthen the belief that Matsyendra, the first Nath Guru flourished at the latest in the tenth century A.C., perhaps earlier.(if) Gorakh-nathiThough Mina-nath or Matsyendra-nath was the first of the Nath Gurus, the most celebrated Nath Guru was Goraksa-nath. All Indian traditions of later days make him the incarnation of Siva, who is the 'divine source of all yoga. It is believed, and there seems to be a considerable amount of truth in the belief, that it was Gorakh, who popularised, if not introduced, the principles and practice of yoga throughout the4ength and breadth of India.

Thus in the hymn of Goraksa-nath by Srikrsna in the Raja-guhya it has been said,—“ By the letter ‘ga* is implied the qualified nature, ‘ra’ indicates the form and beauty, by ‘ksa’ is implied his nature as imperishable Brahman,—salute be to that Sri-goraksa.” 1 He is the supreme Brahman of the Brahmans, the gem on the crown of Rudra and others,— and the three worlds are made by him. He is the totality of all the qualities,—he is at the same time the absence of all the qualities,—he resides in qualities in his unqualified nature,—he is both formless and with form. He is worshipped by the gods (in heaven), by men on earth, and by the Nagas in the nether land. He is all alone, eternal and free from the fetters of existence, he is the supreme Brahman and the imperishable divine lustre. The sky is his temple decked with various gems, and the all-good lord is there with boons of safety and security. He is saluted by Brahma, Visnu and other gods,—by the sages and other ordinary people and also by all the Siddhas, who are of the essence of knowledge.” 2 Such docetic descrip­tions of Goraksa-nath are also found in the $ri-gora\\sa- sahasra-nama-stotra (hymns of the thousand names of Sri- goraksa) of the Kalpa-druma-tantra and also in the Brahmanda-purana. ’ Bengali literary traditions make him the purest and strongest of all the yogins. The erotic charm even of goddess Durga herself was repeatedly put to shame by the purity and strength of his character. Most of the renowned mediaeval saints, who composed songs in vernaculars, paid homage to . this great Yogin along with Matsyendra, Carpata, Bhartr, Gopi-cand and others.

A similar tradition is found in the Janam S&khi of Babs-Nanak, where it is said that Nsnak met Gorakh-nath and Matsyendra-nath and held religious discourse with them. It is further said that when, in course of his long wanderings as a Yogin, Nanak went to Ceylon he was mistaken for Gorakh-nath.1 Dadu refers to Gorakh and the doctrine of the innumerable Siddhas. Gahinl-nSth of the twelfth or thirteenth century acknowledges Gorakh to be the great teacher of Plpa; Guzrati poets also mention Gorakh with reverence. Krsna-das, a Guzrati poet, sings of Mucchandra and Goraksa as two Jaina saints.8 Rajjabjl, a Rajputana saint of the nineteenth century, mentions Gorakh with reverence. If we take account of the literature of Nathism in all parts of India, we shall find that every­where traditions hold Gorakh to have been the supreme of all the Gurus.So widely popular has been the great saint Gorakh-nath among many of the Yogi-sects of India, for a long time comprising a decade of centuries, that countless traditions have grown round the figure of the great yogin, and Mr. Briggs has taken the trouble of collecting many of these traditions in his work on Gorakh-nath and The Kanphat Yogis of India* From these heaps of wild legends, which are often contradictory to one another, and which have grown more with a belief in the divinity of Gorakh, it is now impossible to construct any historical account of the life and teachings of the saint.

Traditionally Gorakh is regarded by the orthodox K&nphat yogins to be unborn and death­less ; he is the immortal saint, believed to be living still now in some hilly region of the Himalayas. Gorakh has sometimes been held to be the Guru even of the triad, viz., Brahma, Visnu and Siva, and there is the story of Visnu’s creating the world in the primordial water from a handful of ashes from the eternal fire (dhuni) of Gorakh in the netherworld (Patala). There are also storiejs of Gorakh’s fighting with many goddesses in different &akta centres and the goddesses in every case had to bend their heads before the mighty Yogin.1 Various are the legends even about his birth in the human form. jWe have seen that in the Bengali work Goral&a-vijaya he is said to have come of the matted hair of Mahadeva.8 There is also the story of his being born on a dung-hill from a quantity of ashes, which was given by Mahadeva to a barren lady to swallow in order to have a child, and which was thrown away in disregard on a dung-hill. Yet another legend would make him born of a cow by Mahadeva. Apart from these legendary accounts traditions would show that he was born in some low caste family.There are controversial legends about the birth place of Gorakh. The mythical account says that he lived in the Punjab at Peshwar (?) in the Satya (kfta) yuga, at Gorakhpur in the Treta yuga, at Hurmy beyond Dwarak& in the DvSpara yuga and at Gorakhmari (Gorakhmandi) in Kathiawar in the Kali yuga. It is also said that Gorakh appeared in the Kali yuga in the form of the 6e§a Naga. According to the Nepalese tradition Gorakh lived at Gorakh in 'Western Nepal in.a cave. The cave and the town are said to have1 For many such stories see Y ogi-sam pradaydviskrti.2 Cj. jafa bh edi n ihalila ja ti gorakh-nSiha I$id4ha jh uli siddh a katha tahSr galatq IJ"},{"pageNumber":506,"pageContent":"APPENDIX (c)451obtained their name from Gorakh-nath, and even the national name Gurkha is sometimes explained with reference to Gorakh. Others would again make Gorakh-nath the ori­ginal inhabitant of Gorakhpur in U. P., and the name of the city is also explained with reference to the name of the saint. As a matter of fact Gorakhpur is one of the most important centres of the Kanphat Yogis even to the present day. Some Nepalese tradition would again hold that Gorakh came to Kathmundu from the Punjab. He is again claimed as a saint of Oudh. The monks of Gorakhpur hold that he came to the United Provinces from the Punjab, and that his chief seat was at Tilla, in Jhelum. Traditions in Kacch (Sindh) would have him in the Punjab. Yogis at Nasik hold that Gorakh went from Nepal to the Punjab and thence to other parts of India. Dr. Mohan Singh holds that Gorakh was an original inhabitant of some place round the area of Peshwar. But from the preponderance of traditions and from the importance which all the Kanphat Yogis attach to Tilla in Jhelum of the Punjab, it will appear that Gorakh was an original inhabitant of the Punjab, at least a considerable portion of his life-time was spent in the province. But at the same time it seems that Gorakh travelled throughout the whole of India and legends associate his life and activities with Afganistan, Beluchistan, the Punjab, North-Western Provinces, Sind, Guzrat and Maratha in the west, north and south, and with Ceylon in the extreme south, with U. P. in the middle, and with Nepal, Assam and Bengal in the east.In the Nath literature of Bengal Gorakh-nath figures prominently as the disciple of Mina-nath and the preceptor of queen Mayanamatl, mother of king Gopi-cand. But in the literature of the other vernaculars “ Gorakh is said to have been the teacher of Pur an, son of Salbahan of Sialkot; of Bharthrihari, Step brother of Vikramaditya of Ujjain; of Raja Gopi Chand of Ujjain, Rangpur, Dharanagri, or Kanchanpur; of queen Lunan Chamari and queen Sundran"},{"pageNumber":507,"pageContent":"4 5 2OBSCURE RELIGIOUS CULTSof Assam (or Orissa?); of Ranjha of Jhang; of Gugga Pir of Rajputna; of Baba Ratan of Peshwar; of Dharmanath, who migrated to Western India; of king Ajaipal and Venapal; of Kapila muni and Balnath; of the holy Prophet Muhammad; of Madar; of Luharipa; of Ismail, a Siddha; of Ratan Sain, the hero of Padumavati by Jayasi.” 1 The tradition of Gorakh’s holding religious discourse with Kablr and Nanak, the most important poets of the Santas and the Sikhs respectively, have already been mentioned. All these tradi­tions convince one only of the extent of popularity which Gorakh has been enjoying in the religious history of a vast country like India.(Hi) Jalandhari-paSo far as the Gopi-^and legend is concerned, Jalandhari-pa figures as the most important as he was the Guru of Gopi-cand himself. Jalandhar! and Matsyendra were direct disciples of Adi-nath and ds Matsyendra was destined by goddess Durga to be snared by the women of Kadali, Jalandharl-pa was destined, as desired by him, to lead the life of a sweeper (which was the work of a Hadi) and enjoy the company of queen Mayanamati. In the Nath literature of Bengal Jalandharl-pa is better known as Hadi-pa.2 It may be noticed in this connection that while Mina or Matsyendra and Goraksa generally bore the title of Nath with their name, Jalandhar! (or Hadi-pa) as also his disciple Kanu-pa bore the title of * pa ’ 8 (and seldom Nath) with their1 Dr. Mohan Singh, op. cif., p. 7,2 In the Gorakid’ Vijaya we find that this Siddha originated from the bone [hada) of Mahsdeva and hence the name Hfidi-pS. But the more plausible reason for the name seems to be his desire to take up the meanest profession of a Hff# (a very low class people with the general occupation of the sweeper), if, however, that would allow him a chance to enjoy a woman like goddess Durga*3 This pa is, however, nothing but the colloquial form of the Sanskrit word p&da commonly used as a mark of reverence with the names of the Si&dhScaryas.

The form pha a6 in H5^i*ph5, Ksnu-pha, etc., seems to be nothing but the East Bengal dialectal aspirated form of pS ."},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":"#APPENDIX (C)4 5 3names. It is perhaps because of this fact that Jalandhari-pa has been traditionally held to be the introducer of the ‘ Pa ’ sect among the Kanphat Yogins. He has also been held responsible for the practice of splitting the ears. It is said that when king Bhartr was initiated by Jalandhar! into the Yogi-cult, the former asked for some distinctive mark,—and the splitting of ears and wearing long ear-rings were the distinctive marks, which he was allowed to have.1 The Augharl sect of yogins also trace their origin to Jalandhar!.According to the Tibetan tradition Jalandhar! is identical with the Buddhist Siddha Bala-pada, who was born in Sind in a rich Sudra family. He courted Buddhism and was practising yoga in the province-of Udayana. Thence he went to Jalandhar of the Punjab and was henceforth known as Jalandhar!.2 He travelled from Jllandhar to Nepal and thence to Avanti, where he made many disciples including' Krsna-carya. He then came, to Bengal in the guise of a Hadi, performed miracles, and was recognised by queen Mayanamati, who made her son king Gopi-cand his disciple. Gopi-cand, however, took the Siddha to be a cheat and the Siddha was buried alive and was rescued later on by his disciple Krsnacarya after twelve years.8 This legend of Jalandhar! being buried alive by king Gopi-cand (at the instance of his queens and minister) and his rescue by Krsnacarya is found in all the traditions,—Bengali, Hindi, Marathi and Tibetan. In the Gorak$a-vijaya we find that KanU'pa was informed of the sad plight of the Guru by Goraksa-nath. In the thirty-sixth song of the Caryapadas we find Kanhu-pada (or Krsnacarya-pada) mentioning1 Briggs, p. 9,2 We find mention of some Jalandhar-gad in the Dharma-mangala literature (c/.

On the other hand we find that Kanu-pa once met Gorakh in his way, informed him of the fall of his Guru Mina-nath in the country of Kadali and was in his turn informed by Gorakh of the sad plight of his own Guru Hadi-pa, who was buried under the floor of the stable by king Gopi-cand. Kanu-pa at once hastened to the city of Gopi-cand (in Meherkul or the city of Pstika)8 and rescued his Guru by devising various means. All the poets are, however, silent as to what happened to Kanu-pa after the rescue of the Guru. In the Gopl-cander Sannyas by Sukur Mahammad there1 KanU-pa is variously named as Kan up ha, Kanpba, Kahnal, Kanai, Kilupha, Kalapha, etc., all of which are! dialectal variants of the Sanskrit name Krsna»p5da.2 The city is also called Dfihura, Vahadi, Dsrfiv, etc. * •5 For these cities and the controversies over their identification in differentparts of East Bengal and North Bengal see the introduction to the Gopucandrer Gsn(C, U .) by Mr VUvefivar BhaftScSrya*"},{"pageNumber":510,"pageContent":"APPENDIX (c)4 5 5is, however, further indication of Kanu-p&’s trials in the city of D§huka with the curse from his own Guru Jalandhari, with whom he (Kanu-pa) played false in order to save Gopi-cand from the wrath of Jalandhar!. It was further decreed by the Guru at the supplications of Mayanamati that Kanu-pa would be rescued from his trials in the city of Dahuks by his disciple Bail Bhadai. But nothing whatsoever is heard of Kanu-pa in the literature. Those stories of the rescue of Jalandhar! by his disciple Kanu-pa are also found in the legends of Western and Northern India.—but there Kanu-pa seems to be more commonly known as Kanari-nath.The question as to whether the Kanu-pa of the Nath literature is identical with the Kanhu-pida, or Kjsnacarya- pada of the Carya-songs has rightly .attracted the notice of scholars.1 We have already noticed the important fact that Kanu-pa of the Carya-songs has, at least in one place, spoken of Jalandhari-pa as hfs Guru. But inspite of this coincidence, the identity‘of the two is still now a matter of speculation. Again, even in the esoteric Buddhist field we find that many Tantric works including the important commentary on the Hetiajra-tantra (known as the Hevajra- panjika or Yoga-ratnamala) are ascribed to Krsnacarya, and we have nothing to be sure that the authors of all these works are the same ; on the other hand there is reason to believe that there were more than one person of the same name belonging to the Buddhist fold. Rai S. C. Das, Bahadur in his edition of the Pag Sam Jon Zang has given short accounts of at least three Krsnacaryas; of these one of the Krsnacaryas had his disciple inBhade, who has been included in the lists of the eighty-four Siddhas. This Bhade has un­doubtedly given rise to Bail Bhadai of the Bengali Nath literature..1 See Hajar Bacharvr Ptirfifl Bangalay Siddha Kanup&r Git O Dorrtha by Dr. M Shahidullah, Dacca Sihitya Parisat Granthsvall, No. 10."},{"pageNumber":511,"pageContent":"4 5 6OBSCURE RELIGIOUS CULTS(v) Gopi-candra or Govinda-candraAlmost all the legends about Gopi-candra or Gopl-cand describe him as a powerful king of Bengal. But literary records of Bengal do not agree on the point of localising the kingdom of Gopl-cand. On the whole two conflicting claims are found; according to some versions of the songs the locality of the whole story of Gopi-cand is North Bengal in or near about the district of Rangpur, while in many other versions the locality is said to be in the district of Tippera. As a matter of fact the topographical references found in'some of the versions lead us to North Bengal and there are traditions in thQse parts of North Bengal of Gopl-cand’s being a king of the vicinity; but the topo­graphical references in some other versions will again lead one to think that the locality must be somewhere in the district of Tippera in East Bengal.1 The fact may be that the empire of Gopi-cand extended over parts of East Bengal as well as of North Bengal and hence are the traditions in both the places. The legend of Gopl-cand has already been described. We shall deal here very briefly with some of the questions pertaining to the probable time of his reign. He was perhaps a Gandha-banik (literally a seller of perfumes) by caste, and the tradition of his family relation with Cand Bene, the important merchant that figures in our early and mediaeval literature, will also corroborate this tradition. According to the version of Bhavanl-das Gopi- cand left no posterity; while local traditions both in Rangpur and Tippera show that he left a son Bhava-candra or Udaya- candra by name. According to the Hindi and Marathi tradition Gopi-cand had a sister of the name of Campavatl, who, after Gopl-cand had taken his vow of Sannyasa, tried to dissuade him,—but was at last herself convinced of the1 For the discussion on the Topography see Mr. V .

Some hold that Msnik-candra, who was the father of Gopl-candra, was the brother of Dharma-pala, and after the death of Manik-candra there followed war between Dharma-pala and Mayanamatl, mother of Gopi-cand, and Gopi-cand inherited the throne after Dharma-pala had been defeated and killed; some again hold that Dharma-pida was the brother-in-4aw of Mayanamatl. Grierson, however, held that Manik-candra was not the brother, but some rival of, or native prince under the sway of king Dharma-pala. This theory of the relation of Gopi-cand or his father with Dharma-psla has been discarded by scholars, as no credible evidence on the point is available. Of the few important historical documents available on Gopi-cand we may consider first of all the rock-inscription of Tirumalai placed by Rajendra-cola of the Deccan. According to this inscription Rajendra-cola defeated Dharma-pala of Dandabhukti, Ranasura of Southern Radha, Govinda-candra of Vanga and Mahlpala of Northern Rada. We have seen that Gopl- candra is also wellknown as Govinda-candra, and Vanga would originally mean East Bengal, and there is also the tradition, as we have seen, of Gopi-cand being a king of East Bengal; associating these facts together it may be presumed that king Gobinda-candra, referred to in the Tirumalai inscription, is the Gopi-cand of the Nath literature. Rajendra-cola flourished in the first quarter of the eleventh century; if the identity of the Govinda-candra of the inscrip­tion and that of Nath literature be accepted then Gopi-cand or Govinda-candra may be taken to have flourished in the first half of the eleventh century; and this fixing of time1 C f.

The genealogy of the Candra-dynasty, found in these inscriptions, runs as follows : —Purna-candraSuvafna-candra. ITrailokya-candra* ISri-candraAccording to Durlabh Mallik the (father and grand-father of Manik-candra were Suvarna-candra and Dhadi-candra respectively. Dr. N. K. Bhattasali has tried to explain Dhadi-candra as referring to Purna-candra. According to the Marathi and Hindi tradition Tilak-candra or Trailokya- candra was the father of Gopi-candra. Again Mayanamati herself has sometimes been spoken of as the daughter of Tilak-candra. On the whole the names of Suvarna-candra and Trailokya-candra are found common in the inscriptions and in the Nath literature and this has led scholars to suppose that Gopi-candra came out of the Candra dynasty of East Bengal. Experts have given their opinion that these copper inscriptions belong to the tenth or eleventh century A. C., and therefore Gopi-cand might have flourished some time near about this time. Another fact to be considered in this connection is that Deva-gana, grand-father of Bhadrelvara, who again was the father of Suresvara, well-known author of the Sabda-pradipa, was the court physician of king Govinda-candra; Suresvara flourished probably in the latter"},{"pageNumber":514,"pageContent":"APPENDIX (c)4 5 9half of the eleventh century,—his great grand-father Deva- gana then flourished perhaps sometime in the second half of the tenth century or in the first half of the eleventh century. But the difficulty is that there is nothing to be sure that the Govinda-candra referred to by Suresvara in the introduction of his work is identical with the Govinda- candra or Gopi-cand in question.(oi) MayanamatiBefore we conclude the chapter we should say a fewwords about Mayanamati, who is important not only as themother%of king Gopi-cand, but also as a woman well versedin yoga and having miraculous power thereby. In someof the versions she is said to be the*daughter of some king,Tilak-cand by name, and her name in her childhood wasSisumati (and Suvadani according to another version).According to the. Tibetan tradition she was the sister ofBhartr, the king of Malvar, mentioned above. A modernauthor Candra-nath yogin speaks of her as the Dharma-bahin of king Bhartr of Ujjain. 1 In the Hindi version ofthe story of Gopi-cand she is said to be the daughterof Gandarva-sena of Dhara-nagar. From her very childhoodshe showed signs of possessing wonderful yogic capacitiesand this attracted the notice of the great yogin Gorakh-nath,who initiated her into the Nath cult. Gopi-cand, we haveseen, once cast serious aspersions against the mother andthe legend of the curse of goddess Durga towards Hadi-pato be enthralled in the city of Mehera-kula in the company ofqueen Mayanamati, lends some support to such a suspicion;but the suspicion of the son was stoutly denied by themother and the poets have also very cleverly handled the£situation.

As the Dakini is deified in the Tantras as the goddess of mystic wisdom, or some sort of a demi-goddess having mystic wisdom as well as supernatural powers, so Mayanamatl has also been deified in later times as some one midway between a witch and a goddess and she has also sometimes been identified with Cand! or Kali, and she is still no\\y worshipped in some parts of North Bengal with animal sacrifice by priests belonging to the Raja-vamsa caste.

These liturgical texts represent popular literature of a composite nature in a very loosely versified diction, which embody topics on cosmogony, liturgy, legends about Dharma- worship, building of temples, rituals, ceremonies and indigenous practices, all centering round the godhead of Dharma. There is a great deal of controversy over the authenticity of these texts and the time of their composition and their authorship. As our present study is not primarily historical, we do not propose to enter into the details of these controversies ; for our purpose it is necessary to state briefly the conclusions, which we have arrived at by a minute study of the data available on tlje points at issue.1 Edited by Mr. N. N. Vasu for the first time and published from the Sihitya Parisat and then by Mr. Charu Chandra Banerjee from the Vasumat!

However, as the book became widely known by the name of S&nya-purUna the name was retained in the second edition by Mr. Banerjee."},{"pageNumber":517,"pageContent":"4 6 2OBSCURE RELIGIOUS CULTSAs for the Sunya-purana, which is ascribed to Ramai Pandit, there are sufficient reasons to believe that the text in its published form does not represent the contents of a single book composed at any particular point of time by any particular author. On the other hand the text seems to be a collection of versified accounts of the Dharma cult which grew during the thirteenth and the fifteenth centuries among' the adherents of this cult. It will be observed that the same topics under the same heading have been intro­duced thrice or even four times within the text with slightly different readings. There is no order in the arrangement,— cosmogonical, liturgical, ceremonial and legendary accounts have been introduced here and there pell-mell. Linguisticdifferences are also noticeable in different chapters. All«these go to prove that the text is more of the nature of a compilation than the authentic version from a single hand. With the pseudo-archaic forms introduced late in the composition of the verses the language of the Sunya-purana in general presents no archaic character which might justify its claim to have been composed sometime during the fourteenth or the fifteenth century. From the heaps of traditional accounts that have gathered round the figure of Ramai Pandit we are loathe to explain away the personality of Ramai as purely fictitious. We may not, and we should not, accept all the mythical and semi-mythical accounts given in the Sri-dharma-purana ascribed to Mayura- bhatta,1 or in the Yatra-siddha-rayer Paddhati2; but never­theless Ramai seems to have been a historical personage.Ramai was held in all Dharma-mangala literature to have been the founder of the Dharma cult. The fact may historically be explained in the following manner.

This curiously composite whole, which\" could neither be recognised as any form of Buddhism, nor any form of Hinduism, was perhaps modified and loosely codified into a popular religious system by Ramai Pandit and henceforth Rsmsi Pandit has been enjoying the credit of being the founder of the cult. Attempts have been made by scholars to determine the time of Ramai Pandit, but it appears to us that no such convincing data are available as may warrant the fixing up of the date historically. One way of forming some idea about the time of Ramai is to trace the history of later Buddhism in Bengal, from which evolved this mixed religion among the ordinary people, and from a considera­tion of the course of evolution* of later Buddhism it appears that Ramai Pandit might have appeared in or about the twelfth century A.D. As we have said, detailed accounts of Ramai Pandit and his heirs are given in the Sri-dharma- mangala of Mayura-bhatta, edited by Mr. B. K. Chatterjee as well as in the Paddhati of Yatrasiddha Raya;1 but for various reasons we are not prepared to believe in the histori­city of these accounts. The accounts given there are all of an extremely legendary nature. 2 It may cursorily be1 Vide B. S. P. P ., B. S. 1313, No. 2.2 Thus, for instance, it has been said that at the end of the Dvfipara age VilvanStha, a Brahmin of the city of Dvfirikfi, with his wife Kamalfi, worshipped Vi?nu desirous of a ch ild ; long time passed without any issue and then the couple went out on pilgrimage and observed austere penances in sacred places with the purpose of having a son born to them,—but all was in vain; being thus sadly disappointed they were one day about to commit suicide, but were saved by sage Markandeya who taught them the right method of worshipping Visnu who is here plainly ‘identified* with Dharma-r5ja. They followed Kia advice, -propitiated V i^ u or Dharma and had a son born to them,—and as the son was born in the Rfima Tlrtha, the son was called Ramai, It has been said in this connection that the child was born in the white PancamI of the month of VaiS&kha on Sunday and"},{"pageNumber":519,"pageContent":"4 6 4OBSCURE RELIGIOUS CULTSmentioned here that in the ritualistic texts as well as in ' the Dharma-mangalas we find occasional references to Msrkagdeya Muni in connection with the worship of Dharma, and sometimes he is depicted as the instructor of Ramai in the matter of Dharma-worship. This seems to be nothing but an attempt somehow to connect the Dharma cult with the Puranic Hindu legends. Attempts have also been made by scholars to connect the legends of the Dharma cult with those of the Nath literature and to determine the time of Ramai Pandit with the help of the personages of the Nath literature. 1 In the $Qnya-purana we find that king Haricandra' erected a temple of Dharma and with his chief queen Madana worshipped Dharma with pomp and pageantry avowedly with the purpose of having a son born to them. This Haricandra has been identified with king Haricandra of Sabhar in the district of Dacca. Two daughters of Hariscandra, viz., Aduna and Paduna were given in marriage to the renowned king Gopi-candra or Govinda-candra, who flourished in the eleventh century. 2 The Tibetan historian Lama Taranath has also mentioned the name of Haricandra, who was. a king in Bengal in the eleventh century. But the story of Haricandra (or rather Hariicandra), found in the Dharma-mangala literature, seems to-be purely mythical, and like the story of the sage Markandeya and the fragments of many other Puranic stories, this well-known story of Haricandra or Hariicandrathe Star was Bharani (vaiSakht sit a-pane ami nakfatra bharani I rabivar Subha yoge prasave brahmani II p. 13). The same account is found in the P addhati of Yatiasiddha-raya (See introduction to the &unya-purana, edited by Mr. N. N. Vasu).

In the Vedic literature the story of Harilcandra begins with the question of having a son by propitiating God Varuna; it is therefore, very likely that the same story was told in connection with Ranjavati’s having a son born to her 'by propitiating Lord Dharma.

It is needless to repeat here that no historical importance should be attached to these chronologies which are purely legendary and mythical in natuie. It is also to be noted that the number of wor­shippers of Dharma-fhfikura in the Kaliyug is twelve only beceuse of the fact that twelve is the mystic number of the Dharma cult, and the worship of Dharma ie called B&rmati. The ceremonies of the worship take place in twelve consecutive days beginning from the third Tithi of the light half of the month of Vai&kha. In the Dhaima-puji twelve flowers, twelve items of all ritualistic articles are required; the male devotees required are twelve and the number of the female devotees is also twelve; even the chapters in the Dharma-mangalas are twelve.

This Rafijavatf is said to have been the sister-in-law of the emperor of Gauda. In no one of the Dharma-mangalas do we find mention of the name of this emperor of Gauda; but it is said that he was, the son of Dharma-pala.2 Dharma-pala i s a famous king of the Pala dynasty of Bengal, who ascended the throne \\n 815 A.D.

But in a copper-plate inscription of Devapgla, discovered in Munghyr it is found that some Rannadevi was the wife of Dharma-pala and Rannadevi was the daughter of Govinda III.

The association of Ramai Pandit with the Dharma-worship by Ranj&vatf and by Lausen in later time seems to be merely traditional. Whenever there was the worship of Dharma the help of a Pandit (i.e., a priest versed in Dhaima-worship) was required, and Ramai being the most famous of the Panqlits, i.t is very likely that his name should be associated with the Dharma-worship of different times. On all occa­sions of Dharma-worship th6 priest or the Pandit, who is generally said to be Ramai Pandit himself, gave instruction consulting a scritptural text which is called Dharma-purana or Hakanda-purana or simply the Purana1. Hanuman, who has in many occasions given instruction of Dharma-worship, is described as well-versed in the' Hakanda-purana (which, we have seen, is another name for the- text of Sunya-purSna). This fact leads to the conclusion that among the poets of the later times there was the tradition of some liturgical text con­taining all the details of Dharma-worship and the text of the Sunya-purana in its modern form may represent some confusedly collected portions of the aforesaid text.As for the other ritualistic text, viz., the Dharma-puja- Vidhana, we are definitely of opinion that it is a compilation of much later times.

Beginning with the worship of Ganesa (as the custom in popular Hindu worship is) we find here injunctions and Mantras for the jvorship of the Sun, Brahma, Visnu, Siva, Durga, Laksml, Visahari, Bhairava, Vasuli, Sarasvati, Kuvera, Sasthi, Bhagavali, Vasumati, Visalaksi, Batukanatha, Ksetrapala, BrahmanI, Mahesvari, Vaisnavi, Barahl, Narasimhl, Indrani, Camunda, Garuda, Visvakarma, Nandi, Kamadeva, Vanesvara, Pandasura, the ten Dik-palas, the gate-keepers (Dvara-pala), and a host of others. In the colophon of the vernacular verses we find the* name of Ramai Pandit as the author, whereas the text as a whole is ascribed to Raghu- nandana. It is very easy to detect that many of the Bengali verses of the Dharma-puja-vidhana are nothing but different version of the verses found in the Sunya-purana; and the Sanskrit Mantras regarding the meditation and the salutation of the Hindu gods and goddesses are nothing but the corrupted forms of them found in the Hindu texts on worship; the portions composed by our Raghu-nandana, are the peculiarly funny pseudo-Sanskritic portions introduced here and there in the text. Whoever the author of these pseudo- Sanskritic portions might have been, it is apparent that the text as a whole has been ascribed to Raghu-nandana only to bestow on it the dignity and importance of being composed by Raghu-nandana, the great authority on Smrti.Besides these liturgical texts there are the Dharma- mangalas wHich represent in many places a type of really good literature in the art of plot-construction as well as in characterisation.

MayOra-bhatta has been unanimously credited by other poets of the cult to have been the first poet of the Dharma-mangala literature and all poets have saluted him (Mayura-bhatta) as the pioneer in the field. But the work of Mayura-bhatta has not yet been discovered and the Srl-dhdrma-purana of Mayura-bhatta discovered and edited by Mr. B. K. Chatterjee (and published by the Sahitya Parisat) seems to us to be spurious for various reasons, and this had rightly been the opinion also of many other scholars after it was first published.1 -Moreover, even in its spurious form the text published is incomplete, the Lausen-story being missing. After Mayura-bhatta the poetical works of about twenty poets have been discovered, many in the complete form and some in parts. As we have already pointed out, almost all of these pbets flourished during the period of a century from the last half of the seventeenth century to the last half of the eighteenth century.21 Vide B. S. P. P., B. S. 1338, No. 2.The reasons, why this text seems to us to be purely spurious may briefly be noted below. In the first place the manuscript of the text, as the editor himseU admits, is almost brand new (written in 1310 B. S., i.e., 36 years old), and secondly the language is hopelessly modern. Thirdly, MayGra-bhatta being the pioneer in the field, the later poets should have followed him in their works; but that has not been the case. Again, the later poets do not attach so much importance to the stone-image of Dharma (i.e., Dharma-filfi) as the neo-Mayura-bhatta does. Moreover, we find here innumerable legends of purely Purinic character very cleverly interwoven in the text to explain all the peculiar customs and factors found in connection with Dharma- worship. Again it is very curious to note that though Mayura-bhat(a is the earliest poet of the Dharma-mangala literature, flourishing in or about the fourteenth century A.D., the Dharma-thskura depicted in this work bears not even the faintest trace of any Buddhistic character whatsoever and has flatly identified himself with Lord Visiju !2 Dr. D. C. Sen in his Typical Selections from Bengali Literature, Part I, says that the manuscript of the Dharma-mangala of GovindarSm Bandyopadhygy is dated 1071 B. S. (i.e., 1665 A.D.), and from this he assumed that GovindarSm flourished in the fifteenth century. But Mr. B. K. Chatterjee holds that*the date of the MS. is not of B.S., but of the Malla Era, (1071 Malla Era,—1766 A.D.) and thinks that the poet flourished in the first half of the eighteenth centuly.

Excepting the work of Sahadev CakravartI, in whom we find a mixture of the legends of the Dharma literature and of the Nath literature, all the other works are almost the same so far as the theme is concerned. The main theme of all the Dharma-mangalas is the story of Lausen, and there is a striking unanimity among the poets not only in the description of the main story, but also in the minute descrip­tion of the incidents.The Dharma-mangala literature as a whole, like all other Mangala literatures of Bengal, represents, as we have already explained in the introduction,1 the “continuation of the spirit of the Puranic literature in the vernacular. It is some sort of a propaganda literature to glorify the god or the goddess in question with reference to innumerable incidents on which occasions he or she had the opportunity of displaying his or her sovereign power. The stories are introduced to popularise the worship of the deity pointing out the celestial benefit which the previous worshippers did obtain. The Dharma-mangalas relate the eventful life-sketch of the hero Lausen, who owed his birth to the grace of Dharma and in all the adventures throughout his eventful life was saved from all sorts of calamities through the gracious intervention of Lord Dharma. We have already pointed out that in the delineation of the plot there is a general agreement among all the poets; let us therefore take the version of Ghana-ram CakravartI to be the representative version of the story and give a summary of the whole story in the following pages.After creating the universe Lord Dharma was in a fix as to how to. introduce his worship in the world.

Mahamad Patra (called by Ghana- ram generally as Patra or Mahapatra), who was the brother- in-law of the emperor, eventually became the minister. Once the emperor went a-hunting and chanced to meet Soma-ghos who had been arrested, on the order of the minister for non-payment of tax. The emperor took pity on him, ordered his release and placed him as a superintendent over Karna-sen, the chief of the fort of Trisasti, situated on the bank of the river Ajaya. But ere long Ichai-ghos became very powerful, drove Karna-sen away, established a new fort of the name of Dhekur and defied the supremacy even of the emperor himself. The emperor went to subdue the rebellion with nine lacs of soldiers, but was sadly defeated. The six sons of Karna-sen were killed in the battle and his wife was shocked to death. The emperor then took pity on Karna-sen and gave his sister-in-law, RfSjavatl, in marriage to him. This, however, was strongly resented by Mahapatra for various reasons. Unfortunately J^anji proved barren and all rituals, ceremonies and worship of gods and goddesses came to be of no avail. Once, by coftnce, she came across a religious procession on the occasion*!

With the instructions from Rsmii Raiijavatl laid hsrself on pikes before Dharma; and the lord was propitiated and granted her a son, whose name was L&usen. When Mahamad Patra came to know of the birth of a son to RaHjl by Karna-sen he engaged a rogue, Indamete by name, to steal away the child, but the child was saved through the grace of Dharma. Dharma vouch­safed L&usen a brother, KarpQra by name, as a playmate to him. When the two brothers grew in age Dharma sent HanQman from Vaikuntha to teach them duel-fighting and archery. When his education was finished Lausen, accompanied by his brother, started for Gauda to meet the emperor. They had thrilling encounters on the way,— Lausen had to kill the pet tiger .of Parvatl, kill another crocodile, pass through the land of wicked women,—and Lausen always came out victorious through the grace of Dharma, which was bestowed mainly through the agency of Hanfimin. After Laiisen reached Gauda his maternal uncle Mahamad Patra left no stone unturned to harass and insult Lausen; bbt Lausen got the upper hand through the grace of Dharma and returned home safe. Mahamad Patra then made another device against Lausen; he instructed the emperor to send Lausen to Kamarupa with some sturdy followers. This time also Lausen had to encounter many difficulties; but the grace of Dharma through the agency of HanOman made him victorious throughout. He captured Kamarflpa very easily and married Kalinga, the princess. When he was returning home in glory, he married on his way Amala, the daughter of Gajapati of Mangala-kota, and also Vimala, daughter of the king of Burdwan.After returning home Lausen was passing his happy time in the company of his wives; but Dharma realised that if Lausen were thus allowed to pass his time in peace the worship of Dharma would not be introduced in the world.6 0 -HUB"},{"pageNumber":529,"pageContent":"A1AOBSCURE RELIGIOUS CULTSHe then held conference with HanQm&n and made another device. Through his magical power the emperor of Gauda became mad after K&nads, the young beautiful daughter of Haripala, king of Simuls. The emperor made proposal of marriage and it was sternly refused by Kfinads. Theemperor got excited and attacked Simula with ninelacs of soldiers. Kanads then made a promise that,whoever would be able to break a particular iron rod,\\ _would be selected as her husband. The emperor failed ludicrously and the man who succeeded was LSusen. After several other developments in the story, in which gods and goddesses played important parts, Kanada was married by Liusen.Mahsmad Pfitra was not the man to be cowed down, LSusen must be crushed by hook or by crook. A fresh intrigue came to his mind and he proposed to the emperor that Liusen should be sent to Dhekur to collect tax from Ichai-ghos. In spite of all remonstrance from his parents, who could not forget the death of their six sons at the hands of Ichai-ghos, LSusen started for Dhekur and after a great fight killed Ichai-ghos, of course, through the grace and device of Dharma. Mahamad Patra was then convinced that Lausen had the blessings of Dharma upon him,—and that to get the victory over Lausen he should propitiate Dharma and obtain a boon from Him. Accordingly he advised the emperor of Gauda to worship Dharma, and his advice was followed. Dharma came to know of the evil intention of Mah&mad Patra and through the agency of HanGman sent storm and rain below. The emperor got frightened and on the advice of the minister sent for Lausen, who alone could save them from the direful wrath of the Lord.

Mahamad Patra was, however, punished with leprosy for his wickedness and afterwards relieved at the request of Lausen; and Lausen had heaven as his reward. Thus was the worship of Dharma introduced and popularised by Lausen all over the world.The struggle of Lausen is virtually the struggle of Dharma himself to be introduced to the people of the world and to be recognised and worshipped by them as the Lord Supreme. It appears from the incidents of the Dharma- mangalas that Dharma-thakura had to establish his supremacy against the Supremacy of the sakti (i.e., the female deity) in the form of Durga or Vasuli orlfCall. The opponents of Lausen were all worshippers of Sakti and were protected by her. Goddess Durga even stooped so low as to assume the form of a charming damsel to allure Lausen and to convert him to the Sakti cult; but all her attempts were frustrated by the strength of character of Lausen and also by his sincere devotion towards Lord Dharma. The severest fight, virtually between Dharma and Sakti, in the person of Lausen and lchai-ghos respectively, took place in the battle of Dhekur. Ichai was protected by the goddess herself and Lausen with his backing in Lord Dharma could do no harm to him. As many times as Lausen cut the head of Ich&i>gho;, the head of Ichai, separated from the body, muttered the name of Durga and the separated head was joined with the body by the grace of the goddess. Lord Dharma found himself in a fix and Hanuman was helpless there. Immediately, however, an assembly of the gods was invited and advice from them solicited. It was then finally decided that the sage Narada must be sent forth to devise some means whereby the attention of the goddess might be diverted from Ichai.

Hearing these words from Narada Durga at once left Dhekur for Kailasa and found all the informations, supplied by Narada, to be totally false; but taking advantage of her ab­sence from Dhekur Dharma „ through the agency of Hanuman, instructed Lausen to attack and kill lchai-ghos which Lausen easily succeeded in executing. By the time Durga hurried up to Dhekur, Hanuman carried the head of Ichai to the netherland and she found, it was too late to give her devotee any help.

This enigmatic language of the old and mediaeval poetry is popularly styled as Sandhya-bhSsa, which, according to its conventional spelling, literally means ‘the evening language',—and the word ‘evening’ here may be explained as pointing to the mystical nature of the language. In the Hindu as well as Buddhist Tantras, and in the Buddhist Dohas and songs, we find much use of this SandKya-bhasS and MM. H. P. Sastri has explained it as the ‘twilight language’, i. e., half expressed and half-concealed (alo-amdhari). But MM. Vidhufekhara §£strl in an enlightening article in the Indian Historical Quarterly 1 has demonstrated with sufficient evidences from authoritative texts that the language is not Sandhya-bhasa, but is Sandha-bhasa (sam f \\/dha) or the ‘intentional language’, i.e., the language literally and apparently meaning one thing, but aiming at a deeper meaning hidden behind. Reference to this word Sandha-bha§& is found in many texts of Pali Buddhism as well as in Sanskrit Mahayina texts. Warning has often been given not to interpret the sayings of Buddha literally, but one should sink deep into them to catch at the right meaning aimed at by the Lord, and vfe find that the Buddhist preachers, particularly of the esoteric schools, would often use this intentional language to'i 1928, Vol. IV, No. 2"},{"pageNumber":533,"pageContent":"4 7 8OBSCURE RELIGIOUS CULTSwhich the faithful adepts only had access. The same device was adopted by all the esoteric schools within the province of Hinduism.1With regard to the spelling of the word SandhS-bhBsS or Sandhn-vacana as Sandhya-bhasS or Sandhya-vacana MM. V. Sastrl is of opinion that it is a mistake of ignorant scribes. But it may be noticed in this connection that the word has consistently been spelt as SandhyS and not as Sandhd in all the manuscripts of the Buddhist Tantras. May it therefore be postulated that it is not a mistake pure and simple of the scribes; but through tfie enigmatic and technical nature of the language and because of the mystical nature of its contents, it acquired in time a secondary meaning of ‘twilight language’ from its original meaning of ‘intentional language’ and hence it is that it is spelt as Sandhya by the scribes ?The tradition of the use of enigmas to conceal the real meaning from the ordinary people is as old as the Vedas. We often meet with riddles in the Rg-Veda and the AtharVa- Veda, 2 which, when interpreted literally yield a meaning, which, as it is evident from the context, is not the real mean- ing. There are again statements in the ritualistic works known as the Brahmanas, which give us no meaning literally; but the Purva-mlmamsakas discover important truth behind them with the help of metaphorical interpretation. But the use of technical Sandha-bhasa became popular with the rise and development of the various Tantric literature. The Sadhana of the Tantras, be it Hindu or Buddhist, was generally a secret Sadhana, and the best way to maintain the secrecy of the S&dhanfi was to express the ideas and1 it may be incidentally noted here that Jesus Christ did also breach in a parabolic language (which also ie nothing but a form of Sandhti bhaia) to .conceal the truth from the unbelievers|ike the scribes and the pharisees.2 See Rg»vedat (1.164), Yl* 152.3), (10,55.5).

The Tantras have, therefore, a language of their own which is accessible only to the initiated.The nature of the SandhS-bhBsS of the old Bengali Buddhist songs is not however exactly the same as that of the SandhB~bhB$a of the Tfintric literature. While the Tantras are full of technicalities, the songs are full of enigmas in addition to the technicalities. 1 Sandhs-bhisi of the Tantras generally means the infusion into some words of some technical meaning which is known only to the adept and to.none else. It was the greatest sin on the part of a Tantric to let the uninitiate into the secret of their cult, and this extreme technicality of the language, we have already pointed out, was taken as a device to prevent the public from making out anything of the secret of their cult. In the Heoajra-tantra there is a chapter on the Sandh&-bhSfS where the Lord Vajra-sattva explains to Vajra-garbha the technical meaning of many such terms. In the eighteenth chapter of the Sri-guhya-samSja also many such technical terms have been explained. 2The CaryS-songs of the Buddhist Siddhacaryas abound in technical terms; but more interesting are the enigmas.

The tree (ruk.ha=Vfk?a) refers to the body, and the tamarind fruit is the semen in the form of Bodhicitta, and the crocodile (fcumbhira) is the yogic process of suspending the vital wind within (kumbha^a).

If cut down, the tree grows on, if no't down it dies out; one fruit of the two trees is conceived by the mother.” 2 In the same text we find old Siva worshipping a boat with a ulta mantra or an enigmatic verse of a funny nature.8 Peculiar songs of this nature, often rousing the sense of the ludicrous, in the form of an address of Gorakh-nath to his Guru Mina-nath,1 Goraksa-vijaya, PP> (137-138).Cf. also;— iravan masate nadi maiddhete ujae 1 aul hatera nauka baht chali berae IIudur paile Sua bilai dhari khae Igagana mandate basa korila suyae II etc.Ibid., p. 144.2 Gopbcandrer Gan, Vol. I, p. 78.8 m a d h u g a h g a -ja l d ila n a u k a e c h ifiy a In a u k a p u j e b u d a i i o u l(a m a n tr a k a iy a ft Sg u n Jktjam an n a te b r a m m a ktJSman n a le I b ra m m a b e fa m a ila ja r e p a n i m a ila t iy a s e II d h e k i a n la m d h a n b a n ite s e o p a la ila a s e Iku la a n la m d h S n j h s d i t e p a j i y a kjday tU se IIe/uyS-ha^i b e tu y a -b a J i k a s iy a -b s d i d i g h a fa Iiiy a la k d e k h t ja n a o y S r p a la y hSsiyfi m a ila pafh fi II a g e u v a jtla c h o f a bh a t p a c h e u v a jila dado.

The writer himself has heard many such stray songs in his native district of Bakergunj. The writer cannot check the tempta­tion of presenting such a song collected by Maulavi Abdul Karim in the introduction to the Gorak.&a-Vijaya edited by him.“O my preceptor, all the laws do I find topsy-turvy ; rice is dried in the bottom of the pond and is served beneath the granary. O my preceptor, on the mango-tree lie the young ones of the Saula fish and they catch hold of the crane and devour it Up, and at the sight of it small ants are marching forward with a machine of bamboo (to catch fish). O my preceptor, with five annas have 1 brought the boat, nine pice is the price of the nail; in the arum forest did 1 keep it,— but a frog has swallowed up*the seat of the helmsman. O my preceptor, one thing have I heard in the ghat of Tripini —a dead man is cooking food in the womb of a living man. O my preceptor, in the forest of Erali live the young ones of the Karaii and the tigress went for them ; and a flat frog is waiting to prey upon the tigress.” 'It is indeed very difficult to attempt a thorough inter­pretation of these lines ; but the most important point is the assemblage of all sorts of absurd epigrams, which are all put together to emphasise the absurdity that even a great self-controlled yogin like Mina-nath should fall a prey in the hands of the women of Kadali. Again there are lines in these enigmas, which, though shrouded in obscurity, point to a deeper significance behind. Thus there is the line in the above poem that a dead man is cooking food in the womb of a living man in the ghat of Tripini. Tripini here stands for Tri-benj or the place where the three important rivers Ganga, Yamuna and Sarasvati, and in Tantricism the three nerves, viz., IQa, Pingala and Supumna, meet together.1 Guru mina~n3th re ulfa ulta dhara, clc."},{"pageNumber":542,"pageContent":"tWhen a yogin can control his nerves and can make the two side-nerves Ida and Pingala (unction conjointly with the middle nerve, he becomes dead so far as the world of physical existence is concerned and that dead man within the physically living man matures from within all the virtues of the spiritual life.Almost a similar song is found in the Dharma-mangala of Sahadev CakravartI and here also the song is addressed by Gorakh-nSth to his Guru Mina-nath. We are giving here rather a fjee translation of the verse:—O my Guru, 1 beg to submit to your lotus-feet this* (strange) fact, the sea has overflown with the milk of worms and the mountains are floating away. O my Guru, try to understand it on your own^ merit,—dry was the tree, but it has shot forth foliages and stone has been pierced through by the worm. See here, the tigress is coming,— through the lids of his ej'es man covers the tigress with (different) skin and then tames her in every house. Quarrel has broken out between the Sila and the Noda,1 and the mustard seed is intervening as the mediator,—the pumpkin 'gourd on the thatched roof is rolling down, and the herb Putni dies of laughing. An absurd tale it is,—the completely barren one has given birth, and the child wants milk of the dove. With much care have 1 tied the boat and the crab held the rope; by the kick of the mosquito the mountain is broken and the ant goes on laughing. First the boat flies above, and then it burns and dust is raised every now and then; there is not a drop of water to wet the mustard seed, but the peaks of the temples are drowned. 1 have yoked the tiger and the bullock together and the monkey has become the plough-man; the crocodile of water has removed the weeds and the mouse has sown paddy-seed.

The lamp is extinguished when there is oil in it,—and the city becomes dark; Sahadev meditates on Kalu Rsy and sings this clever description of the body.” 1Songs of this type, which are still now ‘to be heard in the rural areas, particularly of East Bengal, are generally known as the songs of the Vita. Baul. Mr. Asutosh Chaudhuri of Chittagong has collected some of these songs from the district of Tipppra and published them in the journal Psfica-janya. 2 We are giving below the translation of two of these songs as specimen :—“Under the depth of sixty cubits of water is burning the straw of Aman rice, and the bird Pheccuya is picking it up with its beak and eating fried paddy; the tiger and the wild buffalo are yoked together to the plough and the ant has pressed the ladder.

In the northern marshes grass the hawks and the cows are flying in the air; the father was born on the day of the mother’s marriage and the son was bom two days after. The frog is dancing on the head of the serpent and the mongoose is laughing on; the buffalo is smoking the tobacco pipe, but small leeches are coughing. At the sight of the spade the black-smith flees away, the pond cuts the workman; the yoke has been placed on the shoulder of the ploughman and t^e cow is walking behind. Stone floats on the sea but the lightest of woods sinks down; water of the ebb-tide goes against the current,—and boats are steering men; etc.” 2The enigmatic style' was a popular technique also with the Vaisnava Sahajiyas and the Bauls of Bengal. The ragStmik.0 padas (the poems where the doctrines of the love- religion are preached) of Candl-das are full of technicalities and riddles. Thus it is said,—“The flower is placed on the fruit and smell remains on it, and on smell are placed these three letters, a riddle it is to understand. The fruit lives above the flower, and on that remains the wave; and on the wave remains the wave,—does any one know this secret >” 8 Again,—“Keep your secret love always secret and have your desire satisfied.

The enigtrias of the Carya songs, of Kabir and Sundar-das are substantially of the same nature as are found in the rural areas of Bengal even at the present day. The Sandhya- bhasa or the Sandha-bhasa thus becomes an all-Indian literary technique for giving expression to esoteric doctrines, and, as we have said, it has an unbroken history for centuries.490 OBSCURE RELIGIOUS CULTSi Ibid., Song.
