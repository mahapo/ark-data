Afte r asking numerous authorities, bot h Western an dIndian, I have found nothing bu t a wild diversity o f idiosyncratic systems, nor hav eI eve r come across a work that wa s entirely consistent within itself. O n on e side,authors who wish t o emphasize th e Sanskritic origins o f Bengali us e th e sametransliteration system a s fo r devanagari: they distinguish between v' s an d b ' s and be -tween different sibilants ('s, s, s) an d render al l fina l ope n vowels. Thi s purely San-skritic system i s perhaps th e onl y truly \"consistent\" one, though i t results i n somerather bizarre constructions tha t hav e n o rea l place i n either th e Sanskrit o r Ben-gali languages (e.g., rendering th e final vowel o f a Bengali genitive inflection, suc has bhavera, which does no t exist i n Sanskrit an d i s no t pronounced i n Bengali). O nthe other side , thos e wh o wish t o capture th e actual sound o f th e Bengali languageadopt a basically phonetic system: hence, al l v' s tur n int o Bengali b's , al l sibilantsbecome the Bengali aspirated sh's, all fina l vowels dro p off , an d s o on . This, too ,produces some weird constructions—for example, boishnab fo r th e Sanskriticvaisnava—which are unrecognizable t o most non-Bengali specialists. I n sum, apurely Sanskritic system ultimately does violence t o th e uniquely Bengali charac-ter o f th e language, while a purely Bengali system i s basically unintelligible t oscholars of most non-Bengali traditions.For my part, I have chosen t o adopt a compromise system similar t o tha t use dby Jeffrey Kripal. As Kripal points out, Bengali writers, i n their ow n self-represen-tations, typically us e a mixed system o f transliteration, slipping easily back an dforth between a Sanskritic an d a vernacular.Because the culture itself rocks bac k an d forth between venacular an d Sanskritictransliterations, I too wil l alternate between th e tw o options, trying a s bes t I can t oapproximate the self-representation o f th e culture. . . . Suc h a system will n odoubt strike th e linguistically sensitive reader a s a confused melange o f broken rulesand inconsistencies.

Instead, the tradition frequently Sanskritizes it -self, though usually onl y partially, and often quite incorrectly. Moreover, thi s eclec-tic compromise method i s itself a reflection o f th e complex an d syncretic historyof th e Bengali people—a people wh o wish t o identify themselves wit h th e ric htraditions of Sanskrit literature while asserting th e uniquely \"Bengali\" quality o ftheir own ver y ric h history an d literary creations. Thi s ma y strike most specialistsas inconsistent an d contradictory; bu t on e could argue equally tha t a purely \"con-sistent\" and rigidly governed system would d o a n injustice t o thi s tradition, whichis itself highly diverse, pluralistic, an d often (lik e every language) quit e inconsistent.However, I adopt a few basic ground rules:1. The basic system i s fundamentally Sanskritic, though tailored t o th e peculiaritiesof th e Bengali language. Thi s i s intended, first , t o make thi s book reasonably ac -cessible to scholars o f Sanskrit an d other Indian languages, and , second, t o pre-serve as much o f th e fee l o f th e Bengali language a s possible.2. Therefore I follow th e Sanskrit distinction between v' s an d b' s an d between differ-ent sibilants, an d I render vowels i n their Sanskrit for m ( a an d a instead o f th eBengali o and uh).3. Final a' s o n genitive o r locative constructions ar e no t rendered, because thi s pro-duces a form that makes n o sense i n either Bengali o r Sanskrit. Thus, I use Bhaver,not Bhavera.4. Words o f clearly Perso-Arabic origin ar e no t Sanskritized: thu s Pi r does no t be -come Pira, an d terms lik e gorib (\"poor\") ar e no t rendered a s goriva.5.

Even Antoine Faivre's extensive wor k o n Western esotericism takes virtually n oaccount of th e ver y rea l social an d political contexts i n which esoteric traditionsemerge and wit h which the y ar e inextricably intertwined.3The field o f South Asian studies i s n o exception t o thi s broader trend, whichhas generated a growing interest i n th e rol e o f secrecy i n Indian traditions, specifi-cally in th e texts an d rituals o f Tantrism.

Throughout th e Bengali world, moreover, the y hav e a long an dcontroversial reputation because o f their supposed engagement i n secret, scan-dalous, and immoral activities. A s th e orthodox Muslim leader MuhammadRiazuddin Ahmad wrote i n 1903, \"Th e class o f Fakirs called th e Kartabhajas . . .is a group o f necrophagous goblins [pisaca] wh o have spread their terrible poisonthroughout our community. . . .

Bu t th e very fact that somethingis \"forbidden\" also means there is always an urge to transgress that prohibition. For every veil,there i s a desire to unveil. The more secrecy there is, th e more one's curiosity grows.9What I shall argue fo r i n m y discussion o f th e Kartabhajas i s a profoundly contex-tual or embodied approach t o Tantra, on e deeply embedded i n th e concrete social,historical, and political circumstances i n which these traditions emerge an d wit hwhich they interact. Her e I wish t o follow th e lea d o f Jeffrey Kripal an d hi s workon th e Calcutta mystic, Sr i Ramakrsna. A s Kripal suggests, w e need t o acknowl-edge not onl y th e \"pure\" for m o f Tantra a s presented i n Sanskrit text s o r i n highlycerebral philosophical speculation bu t als o it s deeper ambiguities i n concretehuman experience—\"not it s ideal stat e bu t i n it s live d compromises an d contra-dictions.\"10 In th e cas e o f th e Kartabhajas, I hope t o demonstrate th e profoundimpact of th e changing social, political—and, above all , th e economic—context o fcolonial Bengal o n a highly esoteric Tantric tradition.

No t onl y di d the y emerge i n th e samearea—Bengal, specifically around Calcutta—in which many o f th e foremost Ori -entalist scholars an d Christian missionaries were working,14 an d i n th e same his -torical period—from the lat e eighteenth t o early twentieth centuries—duringwhich they first began t o identify a certain body o f texts an d traditions a s\"Tantrism,\" but, b y th e en d o f th e nineteenth century, th e Kartabhajas wer e oftensingled out a s th e quintessence an d most extreme example o f th e degenerateTantric cult.

But , a t th e same time, ironically, th e Kartabhajaswere also praised b y some o f th e most progressive reformers o f th e nineteenthcentury, such a s Nablncandra Sen, who admired their seemingly modern humanis-tic ideals.

Rather, th e historianof religions must als o examine myths an d symbols a s th e work o f real , concretelysituated, interested human beings, a s products o f homo faber, which ar e deeply en -meshed in rea l social, political, an d historical contexts.42 A s Bruce Lincoln pointsout, the discipline o f th e \"history o f religions\" therefore bears a deep tension a t it svery heart. To practice th e history o f religions i s t o examine th e temporal, human,and material aspects o f phenomena which claim t o b e transcendent, suprahumanand eternal:Religion ... i s tha t discourse whose defining characteristic i s it s desire t o speak o fthings eternal an d transcendent wit h a n authority equally transcendent an d eternal.History, in th e sharpest possible contrast, i s tha t discourse which speaks o f thingstemporal and terrestrial i n a human an d fallible voice, whil e staking it s clai m t o au -thority on rigorous critical practice.History of religions i s thus a discourse tha t resists an d reverses th e orientation o fthat discourse wit h which i t concerns itself.

Bourdieu the n distinguishes between several varietiesof capital.

First, th e strictguarding of information transforms knowledge int o a scarce resource, a good tha tis \"rare an d worthy o f being sought after.\" T o us e Bourdieu's terms, secrecy in -volves an extreme for m o f th e \"censorship\" imposed o n al l statements within th e\"market of symbolic goods\"; fo r every individual modifies an d censors hi s o r he rexpressions in anticipation of their reception by the other members of the socialfield.84 Secrecy, however, i s a deliberate and self-imposed censorship, whose function i sto maximize th e scarcity, valu e an d desirability o f a given piece o f knowledge.Secrecy is about control. I t i s about th e individual possession o f knowledge tha t oth -ers d o no t have. . . . Secrecy elevates th e value o f th e thing concealed. That whichis hidden grows desirable an d seems powerful.All knowledge i s a form o f property i n tha t i t ca n b e possessed. Knowledge ca nbe given, acquired, sold . . . Secret knowledge evokes th e sense o f possession mostclearly.85As Lindstrom suggests i n hi s work o n th e Tanna peoples o f th e South Pacific, se -crecy is thu s a central par t o f th e \"conversational economy\" which constitutesevery social order. Secrecy converts information int o something that ca n b eowned, exchanged, accumulated—\"a commodity, something tha t ca n b e boughtand sold.\" Thus, wha t i s most important about secrets i s no t th e hidden meaningsthey profess t o contain but, rather, th e \"economy o f exchanges\" o r resale valuewhich secrets hav e as a commodity in a given information market: \"Secrets tur nknowledge into property tha t ca n b e exchanged.

Most significantly, as manycritics have argued, Bourdieu consistently tends t o belittle an d deemphasize th erole of agency, awareness, an d intentionality i n social practice. A s Michel d eCerteau,Jean Comaroff, Richard Jenkins, an d others hav e argued, Bourdieu tendsto reduce social actors t o unconscious \"dupes\" within a rather static structural sys-tem, and hence t o reduce social practice t o a kind o f \"celebration o f mindless con-formity,\" which merely reproduces th e existing social order:\"the rol e o f conscious-22 INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"ness is almost totally eclipsed; hi s actors see m doomed t o reproduce their worldmindlessly without it s contradictions leaving an y mark o n their awareness.\"90Hence, Bourdieu gives littl e attention t o th e possibilities fo r resistance, struggle,and subversion o f th e dominant social order. With hi s ke y emphasis o n th e impor-tance of strategy—the agent's capacity fo r creative manipulation o f th e structures o fthe social order—Bourdieu's model should, at leas t implicitly, leav e some room fo rthe possibility o f resistance.91 Unfortunately, Bourdieu's ow n remarks o n th e po -tential for resistance ar e oddly brief an d undeveloped.92 Therefore, I suggest tha twe follow th e lea d o f d e Certeau, Comaroff, an d others, b y building o n Bourdieu'snotion of strategy and more full y developing the possibilities for struggle and sub-version of th e dominant social order. We nee d t o ask , in short, Ho w d o lower-class,marginalized, and oppressed members o f society struggle t o achieve \"capital,\" sta -tus, o r prestige. Ho w d o th e poor \"make do \" within a social fiel d that i s clearlydominated, within a market where all the prices are inflated and all the scalesrigged? As d e Certeau suggests (modifying Bourdieu's model), ther e ar e no t onl y avariety of strategies a t pla y i n th e social fiel d (i.e., techniques b y which elite an ddominant classes struggle t o accumulate power an d capital) bu t als o a wide array o ftactics (i.e., th e more \"everyday\" struggles an d maneuvers o n th e par t o f th e domi-nated classes, b y which the y appropriate, manipulate, an d tur n t o their ow n advan-tage the structures o f th e dominant social order).93 These ar e what d e Certeau call sthe more subtle tactics of consumption among dominated classes, \"the ingenious waysin which th e weak make us e o f th e strong,\" o r th e manifold ways i n which socialconsumers \"poach o n th e property o f others.\"94In fact, fa r fro m a simple reductionist economic argument, which would ex -plain religious ideas b y reference t o underlying material forces, wha t I am really ar -guing for her e i s a profoundly antireductionist approach t o th e Kartabhajas, an deven a kind o f economism turned o n it s head.

Thi sis a strategy much lik e what Harold Bloom ha s called, i n th e cas e o f Kabbalistichermeneutics, a strong misreading, or, t o borrow a phrase o f Daniel O'Keefe, i t i s atactic of \"stealing th e lightning\" o f th e orthodox tradition an d using i t t o legiti-mate a new esoteric tradition.8At th e same time, i t i s als o rather appropriate tha t th e Kartabhajas hav e seizedon the specific metaphor o f th e marketplace—an image use d i n a variety o f ear -lier Vaisnava texts, which i s itself th e root metaphor used throughout th eKartabhaja songs.

(B G 243; 11..80)29Yet rather strikingly, unlike th e songs o f either th e earlier Sahajiyas o r th e laterBauls, the Kartabhaja songs regularly describe thi s ma n o f th e heart, o r SahajaMan, using language borrowed fro m th e world o f business, commerce, an d eco-nomics. And the y d o s o i n a rather paradoxical, seemingly contradictory way. TheManer Manusa is sometimes depicted as a wealthy merchant or king, and some-times as a wretched beggar o r a poor man. I n some songs, fo r example, h e i s de -scribed as th e \"Karta\" o r owner o f a merchant ship,30 o r a s th e \"rich man\" (dhanilok) who ha s se t u p hi s office an d no w engages i n merchant trade:The Sahaja Ma n ha s gon e an d built hi s Office [kuthi] i n thi s Land,. . .

In fact, thi s image o fthe Karta a s a Boss o r proprietor, complete wit h a business office an d a n accountbook for recording sins, recurs throughout th e Kartabhaja songs an d prayers.

(Aksaykumar Datta, Tattvabodhini, no . 81 , 1 2Baisakh, 1772 Saka [1850])More than a few authors hav e noticed tha t th e doctrine o f th e Karta a s \"Go d in -carnate\" bears some rather suspicious resemblance t o Christian theology. A sSukumar Sen points out , th e ideal o f th e Karta ma y wel l reflect th e influence o fChristian missionary teachings, which were rapidly circulating throughout colo-nial Bengal.32 Since th e lat e eighteenth century, th e Baptist Missionary Societyhad begun t o work industriously i n th e Bengal area, spreading th e message o f th eSavior, the So n o f God, a t about th e same tim e tha t Ramsaran Pa l began t o declarehimself God incarnate. The famous Scottish missionary, Alexander Duff, eve n es -tablished a Christian school a t th e ver y entrance t o Ghoshpara village, which musthave had more tha n a little impact upo n th e evolution o f th e Kartabhaja tradition.One of th e primary reasons fo r th e mass conversions o f Kartabhaja devotees t oChristianity in th e early nineteenth century, a s Geoffrey Oddie argues, wa s pre -cisely because o f th e many obvious similarities between th e tw o religions.33 W eknow, moreover, tha t Dulalcarid ha d conversations an d eve n debates wit h th e Bap-tist Missionaries, whom h e regarded a s thei r competitors i n th e \"marketplace o fsouls.\" According t o th e Calcutta Review, Marshman an d Carey visited Dulal i n1802 and debated various theological issues wit h him, arguing th e finer points o fpantheism.34It seems equally likely, moreover, tha t th e Kartabhajas quickly absorbed an dadapted certain other Christian ideas.

Thus, th e Chris-tian preachers could vie w th e newly founded Kartabhaja religion with th e eye s o ffaith.\"36In addition t o their te n commandments, th e Kartabhajas als o developed a curi-ous practice of repentance and confession of sin—known as the Dayika Majlis(from day, debt o r mortgage)—which als o bears a suspicious resemblance t o th eChristian practice. Rather significantly, however, a key par t o f th e atonement fo rone's sins i s th e payment o f a \"fine\" o r \"mortgage fee \" i n order t o attain ful l for -giveness: \"The Kartabhajas hav e a practice called th e Dayika Majlis, which i s lik ethe Christians\"Confession' . . .

As Ramakrsna's biographer, Ramacandra Datta described them,the Kartabhaja women le d a \"repulsive lifestyle, worse tha n tha t o f prostitutes.\"82In th e eye s o f many observers, th e fre e interaction between th e sexes an d th e ne windependence given t o women wa s precisely what le d t o th e eventual corruptionand decadence o f th e Kartabhajas: \"Th e number o f women i s three times tha t o fmen; this i s because th e current o f immorality ha s become ver y strong. . . . No wmany men an d women come her e t o commingle, which ha s bee n th e cause o f th edownfall of thi s religion.\"83Like the Kartabhajas' social ideals, then, th e rol e o f women i n thi s traditionmust be understood i n relation t o th e changing rol e o f women i n colonial Cal -cutta, particularly under th e impact o f th e Bengal Renaissance an d th e reformmovements such a s th e Brahmo Samaj.

Not onl y ar e there ar e a wide variety o f radically divergent interpreta-tions among contemporary scholars, but eve n among later Kartabhaja commenta-tors and gurus, there i s rather enormous difference o f opinion a s t o th e meaning o fthese cryptic sayings. A s on e famous nineteenth-century observer, th e poetNabincandra Sen, described them, th e Kartabhajas keep their teachings secretlyencoded, much lik e th e European Freemasons: \"On e Kartabhaja san g some o f thei rreligious songs fo r me . .. .

No t onl y i s i t extremely difficult, a s w e wil l se e i nthe next section, t o gai n access t o an d speak t o Kartabhaja practitioners today, bu teven among th e known historical texts, an d even among those gurus wh o willspeak openly, w e encounter a tremendous variety o f different, ofte n contradictoryinterpretations of th e same \"Secret truths.\" Take, fo r example, th e ke y Mint Say -ing—which is on e o f th e most often quoted—that \"th e woman must become ahijra and th e ma n a eunuch.\" Now, firs t w e should not e ho w very peculiar th e firs thalf of thi s statement is : for, typically, a hijra refers t o a particular kin d o f mal e wh ohas had hi s penis an d testicles removed; th e hijr a the n becomes par t o f a semireli-gious community o f me n wh o dress a s women an d often engage i n homosexualprostitution.18 In th e course o f m y ow n textual research an d fieldwork, I have en -countered (at least ) th e following eight different interpretations:1. According t o th e more conservative o r \"orthodox\" interpretation, lik e tha t o f th erecently deceased Karta, Satyasiva Pal, thi s phrase simply means that th e98 THE POWER O F SECRECY"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Kartabhaja must b e extremely chaste an d pure, a s austere an d sexless a s aeunuch.192. I n complete contrast, according t o th e more \"esoteric\" interpretation, thi s phrasemeans that th e Kartabhaja disciple must b e capable o f th e most difficult Tantricritual of sexual intercourse, bu t d o s o without giving i n t o mere sensual lust . Thi sparadoxical and dangerous fea t i s sai d t o b e lik e \"making a frog dance i n a snake'smouth,\" \"bathing i n th e ocean without getting your hai r wet,\" o r lik e a womanbecoming a hijra.203. For others, thi s statement ha s a more spiritual an d mystical meaning: i t refers t othe ultimate state o f divine union an d bliss—a kin d o f \"spiritual androgyny\"—inwhich the Kartabhaja experiences both male an d female principles within hi sown body.214. For some, i t means tha t bot h male an d female must b e symbolically \"feminine,\"passive and receptive i n relation t o God, wh o i s th e only true \"Male\" i n th euniverse.225. And fo r stil l others, i t simply means tha t th e Kartabhaja must g o beyond al l duali-ties altogether—to th e \"formless state,\" beyond male an d female, beyond body an dspirit, beyond good an d evil.236. Rather strikingly, at leas t a few have interpreted thi s sentence quite literally, takingit t o mean that th e Kartabhaja must really b e a hijra—that is, par t o f a specialcommunity of castrated males, wh o dress a s women an d ar e involved in homosex-ual prostitution (a s Ramakrsnas biographer, Ramacandra Datta described them,their \"repulsive lifestyle i s worse eve n tha n tha t o f prostitutes\"24).7. Some suggest tha t th e \"meaning\" o f thi s statement i s no t fixed o r singular, bu trather varies depending o n th e disciples capacity an d level o f initiation.258. Finally, I should not e that, i n th e course o f m y interviews wit h several gurus, I raninto the rather frustrating problem o f self-contradictory an d changeable interpre-tations, receiving on e answer o n on e occasion, an d a completely different answeron another occasion, o r i n a different setting).Figure 3.1 illustrates ho w these different interpretations might b e outlined.In sum, what w e encounter i n th e problem o f secrecy i s a n especially acute ex -ample of what Ricoeur call s th e \"conflict o f interpretations\" an d \"indeterminacy o fmeaning,\" which i s inherent i n every discourse.

It i s i n thi s sense perhaps mor e lik e what Roland Barthes call s th e \"degreezero signifier\"—\"the pure sig n tha t means everything\" th e \"sign t o which al l mean-ings can b e attributed.\"29So th e question remains, i f w e hav e no t undergone initiation a t th e hands o f aguru—and in fac t eve n i f w e have undergone initiation—how can w e make an ysense of these deliberately confusing an d obfuscating statements? Now, i t ma y wel lbe true tha t I can never kno w th e ultimate referent o f these statements (an d i t ma yeven be tru e tha t there i s n o single, ultimate referent), bu t I ca n examine th emetaphoric forms an d discursive strategies through which the y ar e transmitted—the tactics o f disguise an d dissimulation, o f simultaneous revelation an d obfusca-tion. Most important, I would identify th e following four strategies:1. \"Advertising\" th e secret: The dialectic o f lure and withdrawal. The first an d mostbasic strategy i s th e \"advertisement\" o f th e secret—the claim t o possess ver y pre-cious, rare, an d valuable knowledge while partially revealing an d largely concealingit. Fo r a secret i s onl y worth anything i f someone knows tha t a n individual ha sa secret. As Bellman suggests, thi s i s th e ver y paradox o f secrecy: Secrecy i s basedon a \"do-not-talk prescription,\" which i s contradicted b y th e fac t tha t \"secrecyis a sociological for m constituted b y th e ver y procedures whereby secrets ar e com-municated.\"30In th e cas e o f th e Kartabhajas, w e have th e rather ironic phenomenon thatteachings which ar e supposed t o b e dangerous an d powerful hav e als o been pub-lished, distributed publicly, an d made fairly readily available i n th e printed for m o fBhaver Gita o r Misra's collection o f \"Mint Sayings.\" A s Misra himself openly de -clares: \"Out o f compassion fo r th e poor, lower clas s people . . . Dulalcand re -vealed these most secret teachings. .. . I n thi s precious treasury (o f Mint Say -ings), many valuable meanings ar e contained within each word.\" Ye t th e deepermeaning or significance o f these truths i s always hel d i n reserve, kep t onl y fo r initi-ates, and ultimately th e highest-level initiates. As Misra continues,\"But H e revealed. . . thes e most secret practices i n a very cryptic form. No t everyone ca n under-stand the meaning o f these secret teachings.\"31 Th e Supreme reality o f Sahaja, th eBhaver Gita repeatedly tell s us , cannot b e communicated through ordinary lan-guage and must no t b e revealed t o th e uninitiated exoteric o r \"bestial man\" (pasu):\"Never speak o f thi s openly t o anyone!\" th e reader i s regularly warned (B G 153;II.85). Yet, rather ironically, th e Kartabhajas constantly, eve n obsessively, refe r t otheir possession o f secret knowledge—albeit i n roundabout o r sidelong ways, ges -turing indirectly b y means o f \"hints, symbols o r enigmas\" (praheli, abhasa): \"On emust understand through shadows\" th e Bhaver Gita sings, \"Know, i n a n hint, whatits nature is—public exposure i s impossible, bu t a trace o f i t i s possible\" (B G 48 ;THE LANGUAGE O F TH E MINT 101"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"11.68). In sum, th e advertisement involves a skillful dialectic o f lure and withdrawal—the interplay between th e promise o f awesome secret knowledge an d th e continu-ous (perhaps infinite) deferral o f revelation. Th e \"true\" meaning o r \"real secret\" i salways reserved fo r th e next meeting, th e next stag e o f spiritual attainment. As on eself-proclaimed Kartabhaja guru enthusiastically announced t o me,\"/ know manysecret things I can tell yow!\"322. Hierarchalization of truth and controlled access to information. The second o f thesestrategies is t o construct a graded hierarchy o f levels o f \"truth\" an d the n t o restrictaccess to thes e truths by means of initiation. As Barth observes, \"If you see k tocreate highly valued information . . . yo u must arrange worship s o tha t fe w per-sons gain access t o these truths.\"33 Although th e Mint Sayings themselves ca n b eobtained in printed form b y more o r les s anyone, whether initiated o r not , th emeaning and value o f these od d statements i s strictly guarded an d accessible onl ythrough the teachings o f a n authoritative guru. Thus, lik e most esoteric organiza-tions, the Kartabhajas have constructed a complex hierarchical system o f initia-tions. The sect a s a whole i s organized according t o a basic tripartite hierarchy,consisting of th e Karta (th e \"Master,\" identified a s Lor d Krsna incarnate), th eMahasays (the regional gurus wit h authority over a given village o r locale), and th ecommon baratis (ordinary disciples). The baratis, in turn, ar e further divided int othe common o r \"gross\" (sthula) exoteric devotees, a t th e lower levels o f basi c devo-tional teachings, an d th e truly \"Poor\" (kdngal) esoteric disciples, wh o ar e initiatedinto the most profound an d powerful secret practices. An d finally, within th e clas sof th e \"Poor,\" there i s ye t another hierarchy o f degrees, according t o one's leve l o fspiritual attainment an d knowledge: these consist o f th e fou r progressive stages o f(a) th e pravarta or beginner; (b ) th e sadhaka o r \"practitioner\"; (c ) th e siddha, the ac -complished or perfected disciple; an d finally (d ) th e siddher siddha, the perfect o fthe perfect, who ha s attained th e highest stat e o f cessation (nivrtti) o r \"living death\"(jyante mara) i n which th e individual sel f i s annihilated i n th e intoxicating madnessand ecstasy o f Sahaja.34 Th e hierarchy thu s looks something lik e this :I. Karta (God Incarnate)II. Mahasay (regional Guru)III. Barati (disciple)A. The \"Poor\" (kahgal) o r esoteric disciples1. Nivrtti (\"extinction\") o r Siddher siddha (th e most perfect o f th eperfect), attainment o f divinity an d supreme blis s2. Siddha (\"perfect\"), th e stage o f lesser god s3. Sadhaka (practitioner)4. Pravarta (novice, beginner)B. The \"coarse\" o r exoteric (sthula) disciplesAt each o f these stages, a s h e advances i n devotion an d skil l i n esoteric practice, th edisciple is entrusted with more an d more o f thi s secret knowledge. A s on e anony-mous reporter described thi s system i n hi s study o f th e Kartabhajas i n 1881, \"Thepractices of th e Kartabhajas ar e conducted i n secret.

Gradually, a s h e rises t o higher an dhigher grades, the disciple gains authority t o learn th e most profound secrets.\"35For example, an ordinary Kartabhaja novice is first entrusted onl y with simpleteachings, such a s th e initiatory mantra given o n firs t entr y int o th e cult:\"O sinlessLord! At th y pleasure I go an d return! No t a moment a m I without thee. Sav e me ,great Lord.\"36 Th e most profound pieces o f secret information ca n b e entrustedonly to th e most advanced disciples, who have attained th e final stages o f liberationand \"extinction\" (nivrtti) i n th e divine abyss o f Sahaja. These include, fo r example,the references t o th e supreme condition o f \"living death\" (jiyante mara)—\"If onedies alive on e never dies\"—or th e realization tha t everything tha t exists, includingthe human body, ar e pervaded b y an d united wit h God—for example, \" I a m not,you are not ; H e is. \" Above all , th e most precious an d guarded o f th e Mint Sayingsare those dealing wit h erotic metaphors (e.g., \"Everyone i s th e wife o f th e Hus-band. . . . Bu t i f on e doe s no t enjoy hi m sexually, th e lov e i s mer e hearsay\"), par -ticularly those tha t contain references t o esoteric Tantric rituals o r th e us e o f inter-course as a sacramental ac t .To make matters al l th e more complicated, th e same statements ma y often b egiven different, eve n contradictory interpretations a t different stages o f initiation.Take, for example, th e Mint Saying, \"the woman must become a Hijra an d th e ma na eunuch; the n the y wil l b e Kartabhajas.\" A s on e o f th e tw o living Kartas explainedto me, thi s statement ha s a n ordinary, exoteric meaning fo r novices an d lower-levelinitiates: It means simply tha t th e Kartabhaja must hav e restraint ove r hi s o r he rsenses and desires, he o r sh e must b e lik e a \"eunuch,\" chaste an d pure. Fo r th e moreadvanced and developed initiates, however, thi s statement ha s a far mor e profoundesoteric meaning: I t refers t o th e ultimate stat e o f divine union an d bliss—a kin dof \"spiritual androgyny\"—in which ma n an d woman ar e united a s one , bot h ex -periencing the supreme nondual unity o f mal e an d female within themselves.37 I nshort, ascending th e esoteric hierarchy i s much lik e peeling a n onion, eac h layer o fwhich is deconstructed an d negated a s on e proceeds beyond it . An d i t i s jus t thi sprogressive unveiling, thi s constant peeling o f th e layers o f secrecy, which ensuresthat the power an d value o f th e secret a s a form o f \"capital\" always remains intact.As a self-reproducing form o f wealth, this capital onl y continues t o increase an d grow,becoming ever mor e awesome an d valuable a s on e ascends i n ran k an d status.3. Th e skillful us e o f obscurity: Mumbo jumbo with exchange value. The third o fthese strategies w e might cal l th e intentional an d systematic us e o f ambiguous lan -guage. Secrecy i s thu s a key par t o f what Bourdieu call s th e process o f \"misrecog-nition\" or mystification, th e \"modalities o f obliqueness an d opacity, which endowcertain persons wit h th e mysterious aur a o f power, prestige, o r legtimate au -thority.\"38 As Robert Thurman suggests, Tantric discourse ver y often involves akind of \"skillful us e o f obscurity\" o r \"deliberate us e o f ambiguity i n th e control o freligious ideology.\"39 For example, sayings suc h a s \"Al l jackals make th e samesound\" or \"there ar e crocodiles i n th e Ganges; bu t a cat i s onl y a fat tige r i n a for-est o f Tulsi trees\" see m t o carry littl e clear significance bu t appear t o b e intention-ally confusing an d deliberately opaque. And others—such a s \"when on e pulls th eTHE LANGUAGE OF THE MINT 103"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"hair, the hea d comes along,\" o r \"I f on e live s i n th e kitchen . . . he'l l hav e t o wal karound carrying th e stench o f th e place\"—seem t o b e littl e more tha n relativelyinnocuous and rather banal pith y aphorisms.However, if many o f these statements appear nonsensical, pointless, o r eve ncompletely absurd, this i s surely onl y another par t o f tha t mechanism which trans-forms ordinary words int o rare, precious, esoteric knowledge. A s Lindstrom sug-gests, \"nonsense\" plays a powerful rol e i n th e \"information market\" precisely be -cause it points t o something mysterious, unknowable, an d awesome; a s a kind o f\"mumbo jumbo with exchange value,\" it allows the speaker to circulate a highlyvalued utterance without really revealing anything: \"This opaque nonsense i s a nimportant discursive procedure that permits people t o seem t o b e revealingknowledge while maintaining it s secrecy an d it s continuing exchange value. . . .People suspect tha t nonsense, wer e i t t o b e plumbed successfully, might reveal itsel fto b e powerful information. . . . Discursive nonsense permits a spokesman t ocirculate knowledge an d a t th e same tim e maintain th e secret.\"404. Semantic shock an d extreme metaphorization. The fourth o f these strategies w emight call (borrowing Paul Ricoeur's phrase) th e power o f \"semantic shock\"—namely, the effect tha t deliberately jarring, unusual, weird, o r eve n offensive juxta-positions of words hav e o n their audience. A s Ricoeur suggests, thi s \"shock effect\"is see n above al l i n th e cas e o f a good metaphor, i n which tw o different semanticfields are suddenly brought together i n a new an d unexpected way: The result i s atemporary suspension o r eve n \"destruction\" o f th e ordinary semantic function o fordinary language, with a flash o f ne w insight which forces u s t o think o f things i na ne w an d unexpected way. \"It i s th e 'semantic shock' engendered b y th e comingtogether of tw o different meanings which produces a new meaning. Imagination... is th e power o f metaphorically . . . forging a n unprecedented semanticpertinence.\"41 Indeed, b y temporarily shattering th e usual system o f reference, b ysuspending the common function o f language, a powerful metaphor ha s th e po -tential to reshape ou r vision o f th e world itself, t o open u p a new world o f mean-ing and insight—in Ricoeur's words, t o \"remake reality.\" I t i s jus t thi s kin d o f se -mantic shock, I think, which occurs i n th e Kartabhajas' excessive us e o f strangemetaphors and bizarre symbolism—maggots born i n excrement, scum-coveredponds, eunuchs an d androgynes, stinking fruits, cakes o f co w dung, an d s o on. Theyseem to delight in particular in contradictions or disquieting paradoxes (e.g., \"th ewoman must become a hijra\"—a male wh o ha s ha d hi s genitalia removed). A s i nthe case o f a good metaphor, th e purpose o f these od d images i s no t s o much t ocommunicate information a s t o ja r o r shock their listener. As Ricoeur put s it , \"Th estrategy of metaphorical discourse i s aimed no t a t facilitating communication o rimproving the efficacy o f argumentation, bu t rather a t challenging an d eve n shat-tering our sense of reality through reflective redescription.\"42The Kartabhajas' us e o f esoteric discourse, however, goes fa r beyond evenRicoeur's concept o f semantic shock an d th e \"destruction an d remaking o f lan -guage.\" For th e Kartabhajas ai m a t actually shattering their experience o f reality, ofannihilating dualistic conceptual thought an d immersing th e sel f int o th e infinite104 THE POWER O F SECRECY"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"bliss of Sahaja.The deeper function behind these bizarre statements an d paradoxi-cal language i s no t simply a literary exercise o r a code language t o b e decipheredon a n intellectual plane: I t i s a soteriological technique, whose ai m i s precisely t oshatter and deconstruct ordinary ways o f thinking an d viewing th e world, t o thrustthe initiate int o a n ecstatic mystical experience. This nondual, suprarational stat e o fSahaja can onl y b e described b y paradox an d absurdity—like being \"dead whilealive,\" like \"bathing i n th e se a o f nectar without getting your hai r wet.\" B y reflec-tion on these seemingly irrational phrases, together wit h techniques o f meditationand yogic discipline, th e initiate i s le d int o th e \"paradoxical situation,\" a s Eliadecalls it: th e state i n which th e ordinary conceptual structures an d categories b ywhich we carve u p reality ar e suddenly shattered an d transgressed: \" Sandhabhasa. . . seek s t o project th e yogin int o th e paradoxical situation. . . .

I t aims t o give birth no t jus t t o a hidden social identity bu t t o a wholenew secret corpus o r spiritual flesh, which incarnates an d embodies thi s supremelyliberated paramarthik self .In sum, regardless o f their precise \"content,\" both esoteric discourse an d esotericpractice involve a set o f similar, though clearly distinct, strategies o r tactics, whichhave a similar rol e a s a source o f symbolic power an d capital.1. Like esoteric discourse, secret practice rests o n a strategy o f hiemrchalization an drestricted access t o ritual practices. Th e secrecy surrounding certain rituals o ryogic techniques onl y intensifies thei r mystery, awe, an d power an d onl y enhancesthe prestige o f th e initiate a s h e o r sh e rise s i n th e esoteric hierarchy.2. This practice involves a strategy o f appropriation an d alchemical transformation:Kartabhaja practice adopts many o f th e basic forms, symbols, an d ritual structuresof mainstream society—(the symbolism o f th e Bengali samskaras or life-cycle rite sof birth, marriage, procreation, etc.). Kartabhaja sadhana, however, adapts an dtransforms the lif e cycle rite s i n th e service o f a n alternative social hierarchy.3. Specifically, thi s sadhana involves a deliberate inversion o r reversal o f th e normalbodily processes o f procreation an d birth: Th e usual flo w o f bod y fluids must b eturned around an d redirected, i n order t o create no t a n ordinary \"socializedbody,\" part o f th e conventional social order, but , rather, a n inner secret body,freed from th e mainstream social body. Thus, b y reversing an d \"rechanneling\" theflow of body fluids, the sddhaka also rechannels the \"flow of power\" within the social or-ganism.4. A t th e same time, lik e most Tantric sadhana, this involves a deliberate strategy o ftransgression and th e skillful us e o f impurity—the intentional manipulation o f sub -stances which ar e normally considered impure o r defiling (i n thi s case, semen an dmenstrual blood). As Mar y Douglas aptl y observes,\"The danger risked b y bound-ary transgression i s power. Th e vulnerable margins . . . which threaten t o de -stroy order represent th e powers inhering i n th e cosmos. Ritual which ca n har -ness these .. . i s harnessing power indeed.\"455. Finally, thi s practice involves th e skillful us e o f metaphor t o disguise an d transmitthese practices.

Since th e mid-nineteenth century until th epresent day, ther e have always been a wid e range o f scholars wh o regard th eKartabhajas as a basically Tantric sect, which ha s sinc e it s origins bee n sho t throughwith sexual practices.

Thusthere has always bee n intense ambivalence regarding Tantric elements within th etradition itself; indeed, w e might regard th e songs o f th e \"Stinking fruit i n th e gar -den of Love\" a s a kind o f agonizing process o f self-reflection an d internal debateover the history o f th e tradition itself—a kin d o f metanarrative o r commentary o nthe troubling presence o f Tantric elements within theVaisnava tradition itself.This is, however, als o a n unusual sor t o f commentary o r metanarrative, on ewhich makes a striking us e o f th e metaphor o f th e \"company\" itself.

No t acci-dentally, the Mela coincides wit h th e traditional Holi festival, which itself i s typi-cally described a s a \"carnivalesque\" event—as McKim Marriott put s it , a ritual oc -casion of seemingly \"Dionysian values,\" during which th e normal law s o f societyare temporarily suspended, traditional hierarchies ar e overturned, wealthy Brah-mans are beaten b y poor untouchables, an d \"insubordinate libido inundates al l es -tablished hierarchies o f age , sex , caste, wealth an d power.\"61On the other side, however, ther e ar e a number o f mor e suspicious authors wh oargue that th e \"carnival\" o r ritual inversion i s really no t a force o f social subversionor rebellion; o n th e contrary, i t i s more often a key mechanism o f social control. AsMax Gluckman an d others hav e argued, th e carnival onl y temporarily vents socialtensions and frustrations, thereby allowing th e social order t o b e reinforced i n a neven stronger form: \"norms an d hierarchies temporarily dissolve i n symbolic inver-sions, moral license an d generalized anti-structure, onl y t o b e reestablished whencarnival is over.\"62 Likewise, a s Ranajit Guha ha s argued i n th e specific cas e o f th eHoli festival i n India, thi s should b y n o means b e regarded a s a threat t o o r subver-sion of th e dominant social order.

With it s unusual fusion o f a semifeudal Zamindari-style economichierarchy and mercantile terminology drawn fro m th e bazaars o f colonial Calcuttaand the business o f th e Eas t Indi a Company, th e Kartabhaja organization i s a com -posite, yet apparently rather lucrative, amalgam o f pre-colonial an d colonial struc-tures, with a rich \"admixture o f capitalist an d precapitalist forms.\"1Still more strikingly, wit h their simultaneous subversive appropriation o f mer-cantile discourse an d their imposition o f new, i n some ways equally burdensome,hierarchies of taxation, th e Kartabhajas als o demonstrate th e highly ambivalent sta -tus o f th e colonized an d subaltern classes.

Quite th e contrary, I have arguedthat social agents no t onl y employ \"religious\" symbols, myths, an d rituals i n th eservice of political o r economic ends (a s th e members o f th e Subaltern StudiesCollective have shown us ) 3; stil l further, I have argued tha t they can creatively appro-priate, adapt, and deform seemingly \"economic\" and \"political\" symbols, transforming theminto profound bearers of religious meaning and spiritual ideals.At th e same time, however, I have als o tried t o avoid th e overemphasis o n th ecreative \"agency\" of colonized peoples an d th e romanticization o f native resistanceagainst foreign domination, which characterizes much recent post-colonial litera-ture.

The most significant o f thes e maneuvers include th efollowing:a. advertising the secret, o r partial revelation an d partial concealmentb. th e dialectic o f lure and withdrawalc. hierarchical access to informationd. th e skillful us e o f obscurity, o r th e us e o f deliberate an d systematic ambiguitye. semantic shock, or extreme metaphorization an d th e us e o f deliberately jar -ring, disconcerting, eve n offensive imagery5.

The possession o f thi s scarce resource i n tur n bestows a unique typ e o f symboliccapital—in the for m o f status, prestige, or valued knowledge—upon it s owner.7. Unlike most forms of capital Bourdieu has described, the capital brought wit hsecrecy is o f a narrowly circumscribed nature, which ca n b e accumulated an dexchanged only behind closed doors, within th e restricted confines o f th e secretsociety.

Whereas most earl y historians o f re -ligions such a s Eliade sought t o compare esoteric traditions o n th e basis o f th esubstance, building u p phenomenological typologies o f common symbolic forms, Iwould suggest tha t a more fruitful comparison would focus instead o n th e com-mon discursive strategies employed i n various secret organizations.The Kartabhajas offe r u s a particularly acute example o f th e inherent ambiva-lence and duplicity o f secrecy—namely, it s potential rol e a s either (an d often both)a strategy o f elitism o r a n \"ar t o f resistance,\" a tactic which ma y b e deployed, lik eall discourse, both t o support an d reinforce, o r t o subvert an d undermine, a givensocial or political arrangement. O n on e side, th e example o f th e largely poor,lower-class, and socially disempowered Kartabhaja sec t gives u s some valuablecomparative insights int o th e use s o f secrecy among marginalized, disgruntled, de -viant, or subversive groups.

As i n th e cas e o f th e Kartabhajahierarchy of Kartas an d Mahasays, the tactics o f \"deliberate mystification, system-atic ambiguity, an d misrecognition\" ar e commonly deployed b y senior adult malesin order t o preserve an d reproduce their superior status ove r women an d youngermales. Even more striking examples o f th e inherently \"elitist\" rol e o f secrecy ca nbe found i n some o f th e more conservative an d aristocratic esoteric traditions o fEurope, such a s Renaissance Hermeticism, Kabbalah, and Freemasonry. As a num-ber o f recent scholars hav e shown, th e secrecy an d esoteric ritual o f th e Masoniclodge worked i n most cases no t t o mask subversive an d revolutionary agendas.Rather, not unlike th e esoteric hierarchies o f th e Kartas an d Mahasays o f th e late rKartabhaja tradition, the y often served t o reproduce an d reinforce th e traditionalstatus of th e wealthy an d powerful classes during precisely those periods i n whichthey were most threatened b y th e changing forces o f society an d politics.18Indeed, as Chesneaux acutely points out , eve n th e most seemingly deviant an drevolutionary of secret societies—such a s th e Triad, White Lotus, an d other rebel-lious groups o f China—very often reintroduce their ow n ne w hierarchies an dasymmetries of power. Much lik e th e Kartabhajas, the y often re-create hierarchiesof power within th e secret society which mirror, mimic, and reproduce the hierarchiesof th e dominant social order itself.19Finally, I would hope tha t w e might als o apply some o f these insights morespecifically to cases o f secret societies under th e unique conditions o f colonial rule.As Andrew Apter an d others hav e shown i n th e cas e o f African societies suc h a s th eYoruba, the rol e o f th e secret cul t often becomes even more critical an d highlyvolatized during periods o f colonial occupation an d native resistance. No t onl ydoes secrecy allow discontented native factions t o remain concealed fro m theircolonial masters an d t o organize collective resistance, i t als o invests the m with tha taura of danger, fear , an d \"savage mystery\" tha t s o often looms within th e colonialimagination, with th e seeming potential t o subvert an d unravel th e ver y fabric o fcolonial rule itself. 2 0But as i n virtually al l esoteric traditions, th e power o f secrecy i n traditionsunder colonial rul e i s als o a highly changeable an d unpredictable one.

Thus, privacy refers t o informationor behaviors tha t ar e morally an d legally neutral (e.g., marital sex), whereas secrecy refers t othose considered immoral o r illegal b y mainstream society. Then, within th e realm o f se -crecy, Warren an d Laslett further distinguish between (1 ) \"private lif e secrecy\"—or th e con-cealment of behaviors tha t outsiders consider undesirable, immoral, o r illegal (e.g., homo-224 NOTES T O PAGES 12-15"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"sexuality or chil d abuse); an d (2 ) \"public lif e secrecy\"—which concerns primarily politicalsecrecy by governmental agents (e.g., th e CI A o r FBI) directed against political opponents(\"Privacy and Secrecy: A Conceptual Comparison,\" i n Secrecy: A Cross-Cultural Perspective,ed.
