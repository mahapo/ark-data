While many scholars here would wish to place that categoryunder scrutiny, there are nevertheless continuities of tradition and common fea-tures that have persisted over very long periods in South Asia. The intention ofthe book is to cover the major historical trajectories of the traditions that haveled to Hinduism and to present accounts of recent developments of Hinduismalong with some of the contemporary traditions that comprise it. There are, ofcourse, problems in applying the term “religion” to the history of South Asia,implying as it does in the West a distinction between religion and governance orbetween religion and science, which have not been universal distinctions. Forthis reason the book includes an account of historical developments in Indianscience along with discussions of philosophy, religion, and politics.The book contains essays both about the past – stretching back to the time of the composition of the Veda – and about the contemporary situation. Text-historical, anthropological, philosophical, theological, and cultural-criticalapproaches are therefore represented. This is in line with the broad belief thattextual study can contribute to anthropology in South Asia and anthropologycan illumine texts. And tools derived from more recent cultural criticism – espe-cially feminism and postcolonial discourse – reveal dimensions to history andthe study of texts that would not otherwise be seen. In these pages we also findtheological and philosophical engagement with Hindu traditions. There aremany ways of studying past cultures and civilizations, but arguably the bestmeans of gaining access to the thoughts and feelings of people in the past andthe institutions they inhabited is through the texts they produced. There hasbeen discussion in recent years about the rematerialization of culture and theneed to examine material culture in history. While archaeology, epigraphy, andthe history of art are undoubtedly important, the emphasis of most scholars in"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"this volume is on text and different readings of text, although some relate textto material history where this is possible and to contemporary practice. Con-versely, the essays focusing on anthropological fieldwork often draw on the textsof tradition.Inevitably, although unfortunately, there are gaps in what could be coveredin the present volume. This is due partly to restrictions of space but also due toother contingencies beyond the editor’s control. We do not have, for example,specific essays on the Indus Valley civilization, yoga, ritual, the Hindu diaspora,the Goddess and the temple, nor on some major regional traditions. But even so,these essays present systematic accounts of the history of traditions and theirtexts, examples of important regional traditions, and accounts of the rise ofmodern Hinduism and its contemporary connections with nationalism and thepolitics of identity.The book uses the standard, scholarly transliteration of Indian alphabets,although this is not consistently applied to all place names and some propernames. There is considerable variation in practice, as many names have commonanglicized forms.I would like to thank all the scholars who have participated in the project, par-ticularly Rich Freeman, Patrick Olivelle, and Frits Staal for their encouragementand support, along with the team at Blackwell, particularly Alison Dunnett, Laura Barry, Rebecca Harkin, and Cameron Laux.

In South Asia religion is at thecenter of controversy and ideological battles and questions about what it is to bea Hindu in the twenty-first century are vibrant. Questions concerning the rela-tion of Hinduism to state and global politics, to the individual, and to the poli-tics of identity are of great relevance to Hindus everywhere. On the one handwe have seen the world shrink through globalization along with the late modernerosion of tradition, while on the other we have seen the reinvigoration of sometraditions and the reanimation of traditional forms of knowledge (such asAyurveda). Secularists in India would wish to see the complete erosion of reli-gion in the public sphere of governance and its relegation to the private realm,while many religious nationalists would wish to see even more growth in theinfluence of religion in the political and public arena.It is in the context of such vital issues that scholars in this book examineHinduism in its widest sense, looking not only at questions of contemporary iden-tity politics but also at historical questions and presenting historical accounts ofparticular texts and traditions. We certainly understand the present through thepast but we also wish to understand the past for the sake of increasing humanknowledge. There is therefore great diversity in the following pages that seek both to account for the contemporary situation and to explain the historical tra-jectories that have led to the modern, global religion we call “Hinduism.” Fromancient Tamil texts to contemporary politics, all the essays gathered here bear arelation to that nebulous abstraction and raise many questions. Are we dealingwith a single religion, an essence manifested in different forms? Or is Hinduisma diversity of distinct traditions sharing certain common features with no singlefeature being shared by them all? Or are we dealing with a fragmented, culturalreality of widely diverse beliefs and practices, inappropriately classified as a single religion? All of these positions have been adopted in understanding"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Hinduism. The answers to these questions will depend upon the historical periodin question and the methods employed in their study. Closely connected to thescope of the field are questions about how to study Hinduism, whether anthro-pology, philology, history of religions, theology, literary studies, archaeology, orart history are appropriate methods, and questions about the different theoreti-cal assumptions and implications of their use. The purpose of this introductionis therefore both to problematize “Hinduism” and to provide a context for theessays that follow.What is Hinduism?A simple, if perhaps deceptively simple, response to this question is to say thatHinduism is a term denoting the religion of the majority of people in India andNepal and of some communities in other continents who refer to themselves as“Hindu.” There are approximately 700 million people classed as Hindu by thecensus in India, which is 83 percent of the population, the remainder being clas-sified as Muslim, Sikh, Christian, Jain, Buddhist, Jew, Parsee, and tibal people(a ̄diva ̄sı ̄). This is in a vast continent with 18 official languages and many dialects.But if we begin to dig deeper, we see that the question is not so straightforward.Because the term denotes such a striking variety of beliefs, practices, and his-torical trajectories, some would wish to claim that the abstraction “Hinduism”is fairly meaningless and without referent. But others, and this is particularlyimportant in the contemporary politics of Hindu identity, would claim that Hinduism is indeed a unified field of belief, practice, and history, intimately linkedto nationhood and the historical struggle of a people against its colonizers. Onthis view, Hinduism has an essence manifested in multiple forms. Others arguethat while Hinduism does not denote a religion with clearly defined boundariesin a way that we might be able to define Christianity or Islam, it neverthelessdenotes a group of traditions united by certain common features, such as sharedritual patterns, a shared revelation, a belief in reincarnation (sam.sa ̄ra), libera-tion (moks.a), and a particular form of endogamous social organization or caste.This family resemblance approach nevertheless still requires judgments aboutwhich forms are prototypical and which are not, judgments which are them-selves based on some pre-understanding of the tradition. Many would wish toclaim, for example, that caste is not a necessary part of Hinduism whereas someother features are. “What is Hinduism?” is therefore a complex question theresponse to which ranges from claiming that Hinduism in a unified, coherentfield of doctrine and practice to claiming that it is a fiction, a colonial construc-tion based on the miscategorization of indigenous cultural forms.Defining the parameters of the term is not simply an exercise for scholars butis closely related to the questions, as Brian Smith observes, of “who speaks forHinduism?” and “who defines Hinduism?” (Smith 2000: 741–2). This debate2gavin flood"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"goes way beyond academic formulations and arguments in the academy into thepolitics of cultural identity and questions about power. But before we inquire intothese questions of value, what of the term itself ?“Hindu” comes from a Persian word hind, or in Arabic al-hind, for the area ofthe Indus valley. This word is in turn derived from the Indo-Aryan sindhumeaning “ocean” or “river,” and from the eighth century, when Muslims settledin the Indus valley, Persian authors distinguished between Muslims and the non-Muslim “Hindus,” although it is not strictly true that the term was not used by those non-Muslims themselves. Sanskrit sources, however, are muchlater. In fifteenth-century Kashmir the term Hindu is employed by the S ́aivahistorian S ́rı ̄vara to distinguish Muslims from non-Muslims (see Sandersonforthcoming) and the term was used in Sanskrit and Bengali Vais.n.ava sourcesin the sixteenth century to denote those who were not “Yavanas” or Muslims(O’Connell 1973: 340–4). In these sources it seems to refer to groups united bycertain common cultural practices, such as cremation of the dead and venera-tion of the cow, not practiced by the Muslims (Sanderson: 1). Towards the endof the eighteenth century “Hindu” or “Hindoo” was adopted by the British torefer to the people of “Hindustan,” the area of northwest South Asia, who werenot Muslim, Sikh, Christian, or Jain, and the “ism” was added to “Hindu” in theearly nineteenth century. Indeed, Rammohun Roy was probably the first Hinduto use the term in 1816 (Killingley in this volume: 513). The term became widelyadopted during the nineteenth century in the context of establishing a nationalidentity that would become opposed to colonialism and in the creation of a religion that could match Christianity and meet it on a basis of equality (seeKillingley and Viswanathan in this volume).Many scholars have argued that the ascription of “Hinduism” to the multi-plicity of South Asian traditions was an exercise in power and that the repre-sentation of India in western scholarship in terms of mysticism, caste, andkingship is an expression of the West’s desire for domination. On this view Indiaas the West’s exotic other became identified with despotism, imagination, super-stition, and irrationality in contrast to the democracy, reason, and science of theWest arising out of the Enlightenment (Balagangadhara 1994; Inden 1990;King 1999). This postcolonial reading of Western scholarship’s engagementwith India reveals a complex history, traced by Gauri Viswanathan in the presentvolume, which shows both positive and negative evaluations are neverthelessbased on foundational assumptions about the nature of the West’s other. Othershave argued not from the perspective of postcolonialism, but on the foundationof Western, philological scholarship itself, that the term “Hinduism” is a mis-nomer, an attempt to unify into a single religion what in fact is a number of dis-tinct religions (for example, von Stietencron 1997: 32–53). Yet others argue thatpart of this “error” lies in the inappropriate use of the category “religion” in rela-tion to the diversity of South Asian cultural forms, for that term has particular,Christian theological connotations (Fitzgerald 2000: 134–55; Staal 1989:388–406). On this view, religion is a category that entails assumptions thatbelief has primacy over practice, that a person can only belong to one religion,introduction: establishing the boundaries3"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"that tradition stems from textual, written revelation, and that a religion is nec-essarily coherent.But in spite of these criticisms there are nevertheless Hindu analogues to cat-egories of revelation, tradition, theology, and practice, although these arguablydo not point to a unitary referent. We might say, then, that Hinduism containsboth uniting and dispersing tendencies that we might, borrowing from Bakhtin,call centripetal and centrifugal forces. On the one hand, there is the Sanskritictradition of brahmanical orthodoxy, flowing from the ancient revelation ofthe Veda, concerned with correct ritual procedures, the maintenance of casteboundaries, and the interpretation of scripture. This is a decisive constraint onthe traditions that comprise Hinduism. On the other hand, there is a greatproliferation of decentered traditions, often founded by a charismatic teacher or guru, and communities expressed in vernacular languages that cannot bedefined by a central, brahmanical tradition and which are often set against thattradition. The teyyamtradition of Kerala or the Sant devotional tradition ofnorthern India would be examples here (see the essays by Freeman and Martin).We can trace the history of the fairly recent term “Hindu” and “Hinduism”from its initial coinage by those outside of the Hindu fold to its appropriation asa term of self-description by “Hindus” themselves. Much before the nineteenthcentury, people of South Asia did not consider themselves to belong to a wider,united religious identity, but would rather be members of a tradition and com-munity whose focus was a particular deity or practice. One would be a Vais.n.avawhose focus is the deity Vis.n.u, a S ́aiva whose focus is S ́iva, a follower of partic-ular Tantras (ta ̄ntrika) and so on (Oberhammer 1997: 19). But there were by themedieval period if not earlier uniting features that cut across these diachronicprocesses, such as pilgrimage to sacred centers, particularly great regionaltemples, ritual offerings to deities in concrete form (mu ̄rti), devotion (bhakti), andthe practice of textual exegesis by scholars in centers of learning.South Asian cultures are highly textualized in the widest sense of the termwith many oral traditions, some of which stretch back thousands of years. Thereare traditions of vedic recitation in several regions of India that function, asMichael Witzel says in this volume, as “three thousand year old tape recordings.”This revelation of the Veda, verses believed to have been revealed to and heardby (s ́ruti) the ancient sages (r.s.i), as symbol and legitimizing reference if notactual text, is central as a constraining influence on later traditions, providingthe authority for tradition (Oberhammer 1997: 21–31). Some would argue thatthis is a defining feature of Hinduism (Smith 1988: 40). As constraining forcethe Veda has been used to legitimize different philosophical positions, as the basisof Hindu law and power structures, and has provided a reference point againstwhich some traditions and charismatic teachers have reacted. Whether acceptedor rejected, whether traditions are indifferent to its injunctions, it is seldomignored as symbol. As Heesterman observes, the hold of “Vedism” on Indianthought and imagination has persisted not withstanding the cult of the temple,popular devotion, and tantric texts and practices (Heesterman 1993: 43). Giventhis reference point, we might say that both centripetal and centrifugal tenden-4gavin flood"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"cies operate in three interrelated realms, namely discourse (va ̄da), ritual (yajña,pu ̄ja ̄), and narrative (itiha ̄sa).DiscourseDiscourse or reflection and philosophical commentary developed from an earlydate in the history of Hinduism. The ancient texts of the Veda reflect a symbolicworld in which ritual, notably sacrifice performed by a priest for a patron, wascentral to the thriving of the community. Speculation about the meaning of thesacrifice developed in texts still regarded as revelation, in the theological andritual commentary of the Bra ̄hman.as and Upanis.ads (see Witzel in this volume),and various traditions of textual exegesis and philosophy developed from aroundthe fifth century bce. These were expressed in the sacred language of Sanskrit incommentaries on sacred scripture and on aphorisms (su ̄tra) formulated withinparticular schools. The grammatical analysis of the language of revelation,along with the etymological and semantic exploration of language, came to bea prime concern (Kahrs 1998; Staal in this volume). Other sciences also developed such as astronomy and medicine (see Wujastyk and Yano in thisvolume). The famous six systems of Indian philosophy or “critical worldviews”(dars ́an.a, namely the three pairs Sa ̄mkhya-Yoga, Mı ̄ma ̄m.sa ̄-Veda ̄nta, and Nya ̄ya-Va i s ́es.ika), considered to be “orthodox” because of their acceptance of the revelation of the Veda, follow the pattern of their tenets being articulated inaphorisms and commentaries explaining their meaning. There are other systemsoutside of this list, with the S ́aiva, Buddhist and Jain traditions participating ina shared discourse, along with the extremely important discourse about law(dharmas ́a ̄stra) that strongly influenced British rule in India (see Rocher in thisvolume).By the early centuries cethe textual traditions had defined their boundariesin relation to each other and had developed a shared language, with shared cat-egories, and thinkers in the various traditions were well versed in their oppo-nents’ texts and arguments. The authors of these texts were often, although notnecessarily, world renouncers who had chosen the fourth estate or stage of life(a ̄s ́rama) (see Olivelle and Madan in this volume). We can note here the highlyorthodox Mı ̄ma ̄m.saka exegetes, whose focus was the interpretation of vedicinjunction, the Sa ̄mkhya dualists, and the Veda ̄nta, which developed a numberof metaphysical positions in its history from S ́am.kara’s nondualism to Madhva’sdualist theology. The S ́aiva traditions were also important in this picture, regard-ing their own scriptures, the Tantras, as transcending the lower revelation of theother schools, with the Buddhists and Jains rejecting the very idea of sacred rev-elation. The tenth-century S ́aiva theologian Bhat.t.a Ra ̄makan.t.ha, for example,knew the texts of other traditions and placed these at lower levels of under-standing and attainment to his own in the hierarchical, S ́aiva cosmos (Goodall1998: 177), a feature common in the tantric traditions. This is a long way fromintroduction: establishing the boundaries5"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"the idea of tolerance that develops with modern Hinduism or the idea of modern,inclusivist interpreters of Hinduism that all paths lead to a common goal. At thisperiod we have rigor of debate and the aggressive defense of the truth of one’stradition against rival philosophical and theological claims.One response to the question “who speaks for Hinduism?” would therefore bethat we should listen to the theologians and religious experts who have discussedquestions of the text, of practice, and of metaphysics in a sustained way overcenturies. The foremost object of the historian of religion, as some scholars haveargued, is its theological articulation, particularly focusing on a tradition’scanon and its exegesis (Smith 2000: 744–5; Smith 1982: 43; Olivelle 1993:7–8). In studying Hinduism we are studying textual traditions with high degreesof reflexivity, traditions, as Alexander Piatigorsky has observed, which havealready studied themselves (Piatigorsky 1985). But while there may have beena shared language and terminology, because of the diversity of these philo-sophical accounts of the world, it is clearly not doctrine that could define Hinduism. The unity provided by textual exegesis in commentary is not a unityof content but a unity of genre, a common reference point in the Veda, and aunity of shared metaphysical concerns.RitualAlongside this shared discourse practiced over the centuries by the high-caste,literate minority, we have popular ritual that has served to provide some coher-ence to the diversity. Traditionally, ritual has constrained a Hindu’s life from birththrough marriage to death in the life-cycle rites (sam.ska ̄ra) and ritual orderssocial relationships and relationships with divine, embodied beings, the gods oftemple and shrine. Ritual is passed through the generations from teacher tostudent and from mother to child, and while ritual changes, it does so at a muchslower rate than other social forms. The relationship between ritual and socialhistory is difficult to assess. All ritual forms have originated at a particular his-torical period, some have died out, but others have persisted with great tenacityand resistance to change over time. Vedic ritual, such as the elaborate S ́rautatransformations of the sacrifice, still persists (Staal 1983). While there has beenerosion of tradition with modernity, especially in an urban context, this detra-ditionalization has also been accompanied by a retradtionalization and tradi-tions reinventing themselves and reconstituting ritual forms. We can see this, forexample, with tantric traditions in Kerala and Tamilnadu where a temple priestmight perform an old ritual enjoined in the tantric texts in a temple with no pre-vious history of the rite.The English word “ritual” covers a wide range of human behaviors from elab-orate offerings to simple gestures, whereas Sanskrit analogues have more spe-cific reference. In a Hindu context, the central structure of the rite known as pu ̄ja ̄is modeled on the gift; the gesture of making an offering to a deity or esteemed6gavin flood"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"person and in return receiving a blessing. There are many social implications ofgift giving in Hindu society and gods who receive gifts, as Brahmans who receivegifts from a donor, might also be seen to be absorbing the impurity of the donor(Raheja 1988; Parry 1994; see Quigley in this volume). The god, then, is anhonored guest akin to a king who has the power to absolve the person makingthe offering (Fuller 1992: 107). There are principally two realms where pu ̄ja ̄hasbeen enacted, in the public space of the temple and in the domestic sphere of thehome. The temple as a home for a god developed around 700 ceand temple ritualbecame all-pervasive and a marker of social boundaries. Large regional templesdeveloped which housed great deities such as the dancing S ́iva at Cidambaramor the form of Vis.n.u, Lord Jaganna ̄th at Puri, and local temples and shrineshoused local deities. Different deities and kinds of substance offered, have beenclosely related to social differentiation, with higher castes being focused on thegreat deities of the Hindu pantheon and lower castes being focused on local,often ferocious, deities, particularly goddesses (Babb 1975). While high-castedeities and temples generally accept only vegetarian offerings, lower-caste deitiesat local shrines and temples in order to be appeased often demand offerings ofblood and alcohol as well (see Freeman’s essay on the teyyams of Kerala). Ritualserves to highlight social difference not only through inclusion, but moreimportantly, through exclusion and high caste pu ̄ja ̄in temples has excluded thelower castes who might, in the eyes of the Brahmans, pollute the sacredness ofthe deity’s home.Along with the shared pattern of making an offering and receiving a bless-ing, usually in the form of food offered to the deity and received back as blessedfood (prasa ̄da), there is a common notion that sacred power is embodied in par-ticular, concrete forms (mu ̄rti,vigraha). Furthermore, this sacred power is manip-ulable by specialists, temple or shrine priests, with the authority to do so. A ritualof consecration in which the consciousness or power of the deity is brought intothe image awakens the icon in a temple. This consciousness or sacred power canbe transferred; thus it can be temporarily placed in the festival icon (utsavavigraha) for the purpose of parading the deity for the community to receive thegod’s vision (dars ́an.a, see Eck 1981). Or sacred power can also enter or be placedin human beings, who become vessels for the god’s presence in the community,perhaps during an annual festival (see, for example, Hiltebeitel 1991; Freemanonteyyams in this volume).NarrativeClosely related but not co-extensive with ritual are the regional narratives inlocal languages and transregional narratives of the Sanskritic tradition. Theclose connection between ritual and myth is attested in the Veda, which recordssome myths and alludes to others, and many of those stories are developed at alater date. There are two important groups of narrative traditions: the epicsintroduction: establishing the boundaries7"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"comprising the Maha ̄bha ̄rataand the Ra ̄ma ̄yan.a(see Brockington in this volume) and the vast collections of “ancient stories,” the Pura ̄n.as (see Matchettin this volume). The epics reflect the rise of the theistic traditions and devotion(bhakti) and are concerned with the restoration of righteousness (dharma);a theme expressed in the idea of the incarnations (avata ̄ra) of the supreme deity Vis.n.u, so richly elaborated in the Pura ̄n.as. These Sanskrit narrativetraditions develop themes present in the Veda, particularly the symbolism of thesacrifice (yajña), and have penetrated all levels of society and different regionallanguages. Thus there are local versions and interpretations of the epic stories,recited in the villages and enacted in rituals (the cult of Draupadı ̄ in Tamilnadu,for example; see Hiltebeitel 1988, 1991). The stories also reflect social tensionsbetween Brahman and King. The King cannot be so without the authenticationof the Brahmans who are in turn entirely dependent upon the King (Biardeau1997: 78). The King and the Brahman have been understood as representing a conflict in tradition between the King’s order of war and justice, embroiled as he is in the impurity of death, and the Brahman’s and world renouncer’srealm of transcendence. The King desires to participate in the sacred level ofthe Brahman, but through performing rituals for the King the Brahmanbecomes entangled in the world and moves away from the ideal of tran-scendence (Heesterman 1976: 7–9). The marvelous myths of the Pura ̄n.ascan be seen as reflecting attempts by a group of Brahmans called Sma ̄rtas, thefollowers of secondary revelation (smr.ti), to bring diversity under a single, overarching and controlling system during the Gupta and post-Gupta period(300–700ce).But the dominance of the Sanskrit narrative traditions should not occlude theimportance of regional narratives in local languages and the great narrative traditions of the South, particularly in Tamil. Here we have Tamil versions of theSanskrit material along with other accounts of myth and history particular toTamil culture. Long before the influence of Sanskrit or brahmanical culture,Tamil culture was already rich in narrative traditions and all northern influ-ences were adapted to Tamil sensibilities and ways. Of particular importance arethe genres of Tamil poetry of love and war and devotional literature expressingan intense devotion to different forms of S ́iva and Vis.n.u (see Cutler in thisvolume).Political EssentialismBecause of this narrative and ritual diversity, some scholars have expressed skep-ticism about the category “Hinduism” and even “Hindu.” But nevertheless bothterms are here to stay and indeed can be meaningfully used. A last point needsto be made, namely that the term “Hindu” has become charged with culturaland political meaning and arouses strong feelings when its integrity is appar-ently threatened, as, for example, by the controversial claim that Hindus have8gavin flood"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"been beef eaters at times in their history (Jha 2002). Hinduism is part of the cul-tural politics of India and the term “Hindu” is now highly politicized as a signaround which to gather the hopes and aspirations of major sections of Indiansociety (see Ram Prasad in this volume) as are particular religious symbols suchas the personification of the Tamil language (see Ramaswamy in this volume).V. D. Savarkar, a president of the Hindu Mahasabha (1937–42), a party that setitself against Congress and the Muslim League in the days before independence,in his highly influential book Hindutva: Who is a Hindu? (1923) distinguishesbetween “Hindu Dharma,” the various traditions subsumed under the term“Hinduism,” and “Hindutva” or “Hinduness,” a sociopolitical force to unite allHindus against “threatening Others” (Jaffrelot 1996: 25–33). It is hindutvathatmust take precedence as the force to form an exclusivist, national unity. Savarkardefined a Hindu as a person who sees India “as his Fatherland as well as his Holyland, that is, the cradle land of his religion” (quoted in Pandey 1993: 247),and Hinduism as an ideal that rests on the three pillars of geographical unity,common race, and a common culture. In this formulation, Hindus are united bybonds of love for the motherland and bonds of common blood, tracing theirdescent from the original inhabitants of the land, the vedic Aryans (Pandey1993: 238; Jaffrelot 1996: 28).We might call this view “political essentialism” insofar as it sees Hinduism aspart of the nation’s ideology which is no construct of Western scholarship, buta vibrant, living entity with roots stretching back into an ancient past. On thisview, at various times in their long history Hindus have been oppressed by“threatening Others” but can now take a legitimate place in the field of culturalpolitics and stand for a Hindu nationhood against the secular ideology of Con-gress. Such sentiments are symbolized, for example, in the martial figure of thegod Ra ̄ma who comes to express Hindu nationalist aspirations (Kapur 1993:74–107) and we have seen how forcefully these aspirations were focused in thedestruction of the Babri mosque and the further ensuing communal violence in1992 (Larson 1995). Any ideology to be effective must addresses people’s realconcerns (Eagleton 1991: 45) and clearly the hindutvaideal, looking back to a glorious Hindu past, articulates a Hindu identity that has emerged partlybecause of its previous occlusion from the political realm (Jaffrelot 1996: 82–3;Larson 1995). The political party, the BJP, expressed nationalist Hindu senti-ments and came to power with a complex of alliances in 1996 (see Ram Prasadin this volume). The claim to ideological unity among Hindus is, of course, prob-lematic and dissonant voices such as the Dalit movement and some sections ofthe women’s movement do not recognize themselves in Sanskritic Hinduism letalone in hindutvarhetoric (Omvedt 1995; Narayanan in this volume). The ide-ology ofhindutvatends to be exclusive, with homogenizing tendencies that moveagainst pluralism and diversity within the Hindu sphere. Some scholars, such asJulius Lipner, would wish to claim back “hinduness” as hinduta ̄for a pluralistvision (Lipner 1996: 109–26). On Lipner’s account it is perfectly feasible to beboth Hindu and Christian, but this kind of hybridity would tend to be excludedby hindutva claims.introduction: establishing the boundaries9"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Philological and Other Methodological IssuesThis book does not wish to make assertions about a unified Hinduism stretchinginto the ancient past; the general thrust of scholarship goes against this. But itdoes, in its structure, make implicit claims about the centrality and importanceof textual traditions and their exegesis that have led to the modern religion,along with the importance of fieldwork. Although some theologians mightargue that texts are self-generating and contain their own developmental logic– and it is true that we can trace a meaningful history through texts – they arenevertheless social documents and indices of the communities who producedthem. The historian of South Asian religion or Indologist is sometimes able torelate religious texts to other historical documents such as epigraphs, but sooften in the Indian context all we have are the texts themselves of uncertain date,although we can often establish a chronology of texts. The study of textual tra-ditions, however, is not straightforward and is inevitably embroiled in a politicsof translation.Comparative philology and its offshoot Indology, the philological study ofSouth Asian languages, notably Sanskrit, developed in the nineteenth centuryand was strongly advocated as a science akin to the natural sciences by MaxMüller. It claims that the philological method discovers an objective order thatis not constructed (Inden 1990: 14). In recent years this proclaimed objectivityof philology has come under scrutiny and postcolonial critiques have arguedthat it is strongly implicated in colonization, as a European colonization ofIndia’s languages. Linguistic typologies identified languages with different stagesof cultural development and so were able “to inferiorize the languages (and by implication the cultures) of the Other” (Inden 1990: 60). But if we takephilology to be the “study of civilization based on its texts” (Witzel 1997: v) thenclearly philology is indispensable in any intellectual inquiry into the past. Whilephilology has no doubt been put to different uses, sometimes morally dubioususes, the enterprise itself subject to constant correction, forms the basis ofinquiry. In some sense philology is a temporary suspension of subjectivity inhighlighting grammar, or perhaps a better way of putting this is to say that sub-jective (or indeed collective) understandings are constrained by the system ofgrammar.There are deeply interesting problems here that go beyond the scope of thisintroduction, but let us briefly look at a cluster of issues as they relate to theenterprise of this book, as so many of these essays assume the philologicalmethod which is used to establish historical sequence (for example, Colas, Olivelle, Witzel) and as the basis of theological inquiry (Clooney). One of thecentral activities of philology is the establishing of the critical edition throughcritical emendation and establishing the stemma as the foundation upon whichother kinds of investigation can take place. But the establishing of the textinevitably raises questions about authenticity – is the oldest version necessarily10gavin flood"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"the more “authentic”? Is the correction of grammatical forms legitimate, assum-ing as it does a fixed grammar? And so on.A text in South Asia does not, of course, necessarily mean a written text. Itmight well mean an oral one, although an oral text, particularly the Veda, is notnecessarily less stable through time than a written text. This compounds the dif-ficulty for the philologist, and the kind of work needed on oral traditions hashardly started, although important work has been done (for example, Blackburn1988 on Tamil sources; Smith 1991 on the epic of Pabuji; Staal 1961 on vedicrecitation). The principle assumed by philology is that we need to establish thetext, as Witzel says, to find out what a thinker such as S ́am.kara actually taught(Witzel 1997: vi). If an apparent theological contradiction within a text is reallya contradiction, for example, we need to first establish the text and whether con-tradictory elements are later additions or perhaps have entered from other textsin the intertextuality of oral tradition. Let us look more closely at this problem,taking our examples from the large group of medieval texts called Tantras.The vast body of tantric material presents us with difficult questions. What isthe function of these texts? Who composed them and for whom? What are theprocedural difficulties of the outsider in approaching these texts? Is it possible toestablish an original text? And so on. Certainly the Tantras were regarded as revelation and treated as words of authority, and certainly they developed in asocial context that fostered their dissemination (see Colas’s and Flood’s essays).But the difficulties of establishing critical editions, along with reading andmaking informed comment on this material, are considerable. The texts them-selves often use forms of Sanskrit at variance with “correct” usage; a form oflanguage known as “divine” or “belonging to S ́iva” (ais ́a), which, Goodall notes,seems to cause commentators some embarrassment (Goodall 1998: lxvi).Reading tantric texts we need to be aware that the context of their receptionwould have involved oral comment by a teacher, practice, especially supereroga-tory forms of ritual beyond those required by vedic orthopraxy, as well intellec-tual speculation about their meaning by commentators and their audiences. Theaim of the commentaries is to establish a text within a particular field of inter-pretation and, presumably, to explicate meanings to an educated, brahmanicalaudience for whom the text was alive and important. These commentaries areaware of themselves as establishing a particular interpretation over and againstother possible readings. Thus Ks.emara ̄ja (ca. 1000–1050 ce) composed his com-mentary on the Svacchanda Tantrato defeat adherence to the dualist interpreta-tion of the rival tradition, the S ́aiva Siddha ̄nta (Kahrs 1998: 60). That these textsrequire commentary is itself an indication of their openness and their non-transparent nature. The “contextualizing practice” (Lemke 1995) of Ks.emara ̄jacertainly relates these texts to the practices of his culture and the texts of histradition. Indeed, the commentators highlight the texts’ intertextuality throughquoting other scriptural authorities, sometimes of rival traditions.Almost from their inception, then, it was not possible to establish originarytexts. Even by the time of the commentator on the text, the dualist theologianintroduction: establishing the boundaries11"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Ra ̄makan.t.ha (ca. 950–1000 ce), sections of the Kiran.a Tantrawere probably“corrupt” and he had a number of readings to choose from (Goodall 1998: cxix).That Ra ̄makan.t.ha could choose from a number of variant readings of the textsupon which he commented, and Goodall quotes his commentary on the Mat.an.gaTantrasaying this (Goodall 1998: cxviii–cxix), shows that even at this early datethere are a number of textual transmissions. But for Ra ̄makan.t.ha variant read-ings (pa ̄t.habhedah.) are not original (na mu ̄latah.) but due to the error of students.For Ra ̄makan.t.ha there is an original or root text that is the divine revelation ofwhich the concrete texts transmitted through a line of scribes is an imperfectreflection. Indeed, the Tantras themselves maintain that they are imperfectreflections of an original, greater, text conveyed from the mouth of the deity (forexample, the Ma ̄linı ̄vijayottara Tantra1.1–4; 14). Ra ̄makan.t.ha’s is an almost idealist understanding of text: an inaccessible, pure originary source, in contrastto its imperfect manifestations or repetitions in human history and its gradualdegeneration (a theory perhaps not far removed from the nineteenth-centuryidea of establishing the oldest, and therefore most authentic, text). OnRa ̄makan.t.ha’s view, the purity of the authorial intention (that is, S ́iva’s inten-tion) is lost through the generations of the text’s transmission; a degenerationdue not only to scribal error, but to human ignorance.This distinction between the authorial (and by implication pure and original)and the scribal (by implication corrupted) text that Ra ̄makan.t.ha refers to, is echoed in traditional philological practice and theory. But in contrast toRa ̄makan.t.ha’s position, the general direction of modern philological thinkingprivileges “the socialized, received, concrete text” (Greetham 1999: 47) over andagainst some abstract ideal. This position tends towards the view that any editionof a text simply reflects the time and place of its occurrence: as Greetham says,texts “are real enough for our purposes” (p. 35). The concrete, received text iswhat is presented to us, a repetition of a repetition, and it is this that must bethe focus of inquiry rather than a notional, abstract “work.”All textual practice is empowered by theories of the text, even implicit ones,and decisions about a text arrived at – say a critical edition – are not situatedbeyond cultural consensus. But having said this, any textual interpretationassumes philology and a dialogical reading of texts assumes the work of thephilologist in establishing or stabilizing a text within a particular time-frame. If texts are more than systems of grammar then they are constantly in transmission and change, being received through history in different contexts.Ra ̄makan.t.ha’s Kiran.a Tantra, at one level, is the text we read today, but it is alsoa wholly different text, hedged around with different assumptions by the differ-ent communities who read it (a scholarly community or a S ́aiva community). Itis also questionable whether Ra ̄makan.t.ha’s root text existed as a concrete objectand it is quite possible that the text was “corrupted” from its inception; that therewas never an “uncorrupted” text in history. While certainly the versions or rep-etitions of a text are of a text, there are theoretical problems in establishing thesametext. The Tantras’ entextualization and contextualization, terms used bySilverstein and Urban for the ways in which texts are recontextualized through-12gavin flood"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"out their history, will affect the understanding conveyed in them (Silverstein andUrban 1996: 1–3).These methodological considerations about the notion of the text are centralto our inquiry into South Asian history and are concerns shared by many con-tributors to this volume. Both philology and its critique are centered on text andmany of the essays here are surveys of South Asian “literatures.” While archae-ology and art history are important for our understanding of the past and the“materialization” of tradition is important, text remains the primary source of cultural meaning. Along with the emphasis on text there are accounts fromcontemporary fieldwork (Freeman, Pintchman, Quigley) and readings oftradition through the lens of gender studies (Narayanan), postcolonial studies(Ramaswamy, Viswanathan), and political studies (Ram Prasad). Indeed,implicit in the essays of Viswanathan, Ramaswamy, and Narayanan is the needfor a corrective reading of tradition, a corrective reading that can come from thedevelopment of critiques in other contexts, such as feminism and Foucaultianstudies of power. It is the general contention of the volume that anthropologi-cal study and critical reading of tradition in South Asia needs to understand thetextual tradition established, however tentatively, through philology, and con-versely that the living traditions accessed through anthropology can throw light upon textual history. The meanings of the Kerala tantric manual, theTantrasamuccayafor example, can be made clear with reference to contemporaryNambudri practice, which in turn is based on textual injunction.An Overview of ContentsThe volume is divided into four main parts, theoretical issues, text and tradition,systematic thought, and society, politics, and nation. Each of these eithersurveys a general area within the wider field, provides a discussion of specifictradition or region, or approaches material from a fresh perspective.1. Theoretical issuesThe first part, “Theoretical Issues,” contains two very different essays. GauriViswanathan opens the inquiry by examining the relation of British colonialismto Hinduism and how the inability to perceive Hinduism in its own terms led toa distortion within comparative religion. She also unravels the limitations withinthe theory of the construction of Hinduism itself. David Smith, by contrast, in a somewhat controversial essay argues against recent postcolonial critique and defends the study of Indian languages and systems of thought by Westernscholars in the last two centuries, critically examining the arguments of Indenand Said. Through these two essays we form a picture of some of the major issues that have dominated discussions about the nature of Hinduism and itsstudy and very different understandings of them.introduction: establishing the boundaries13"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"2. Text and traditionThe largest part of the book, “Text and Tradition,” systematically provides anoverview of the major textual traditions in Sanskrit and provides three examples of traditions in Indian vernacular languages. On the assumption thata textual source cannot be separated from the tradition of which it is a part, thissection gives an account of both major texts themselves and the histories of thetraditions that revere and preserve them.Beginning with the foundations of the textual traditions in the Vedas andUpanis.ads, Michael Witzel presents a comprehensive account of the texts andtheir categorization, the ritual traditions of which they are a part, and thehistorical developments to the period of the formation of the su ̄ tra literature. Weknow much more now about this period, about vedic dialects for example, andWitzel brings this recent scholarship to bear. Ludo Rocher takes up some of thesedevelopments in his essay on Dharmas ́a ̄stras, the treatises on law, giving anaccount of the texts themselves, problems of dating this material, and theimportance and impact of the Dharmas ́a ̄stras on the later system of law, espe-cially during the colonial period. The great Indian epics are next accounted forin John Brockington’s essay. We see how major themes in the traditions aredeveloped at a narrative level in the texts and their impact on the later traditions. Many themes, deities, and stories from the epics are elaborated and developed in the vast body of “ancient” texts, the Pura ̄n.as. Here Freda Matchett guides usthrough a complex world of multiple narratives, quasi-history, and sectariandivides and gives us an account of the history of their study. Some of the themesand narratives of the Epics and Pura ̄n.as are also found in the literatures of ver-nacular languages. The examples provided here are by Norman Cutler, whoproblematizes the phrase “Tamil Hindu Literature” and goes on to develop a fas-cinating account of devotion, poetry, ritual, and narrative in court, temple, andvillage. Rich Freeman charts the development of Kerala’s Hindu literature,showing how the Kerala cultural context transforms Tamil themes, and how thetexts reflect socioreligious practice. Moving into a very different world, NancyMartin provides an account of devotional literature in Hindi and the particularform of devotionalism that developed in the north, focused on a transcendentbeing without qualities or form. The famous poet Kabir is here placed in thecontext of this devotional movement.From particular genres, we turn to Gavin Flood’s chapter, which presents ahistorical trajectory of S ́aivism. Flood shows how S ́aivas considered their reli-gious practices and beliefs to be authorized by the Tantras, a revelation distinctfrom the Veda, and discusses the relation between the S ́aiva and Vaidika tradi-tions. In a similar vein, Gérard Colas gives a detailed account of the history ofVa i s.n.ava traditions based on Sanskrit and Tamil sources. He shows how devo-tion to Vis.n.u articulates with the aristocracy, the yogic and ascetic traditions,and discusses the forms of Vais.n.avism in the Pañcra ̄tra and Vaikha ̄nasa tradi-tions, going on to discuss important later developments as well. Vais.n.avism (as14gavin flood"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"did S ́aivism) expanded beyond the borders of India into southeast Asia where ithas left an important legacy. Cutting across historical trajectories, being institu-tions common to the S ́aiva, Vais.n.ava, and Vaidika traditions, we have the lifestyleoptions of the householder and the renouncer. T. N. Madan has done veryimportant work on this often neglected aspect of Hinduism. In his essay he looksat what it is to be a householder and examines the idea in the textual sources asboth institution and ideal, indicating values set against the value of renuncia-tion and turning one’s back on family and society. Closely allied to Madan’s essayin that both are examining central institutions and realms of value withinHinduism, Patrick Olivelle discusses the renouncer tradition. Here Olivelle givesan account of the origins and institution of renunciation, showing how thesources reveal a tension between the ascetic values of renunciation and thevalues of the male householder, discussed by Madan, to marry, father children,and perform ritual enjoined on him by scripture.Lastly in this part we look at the particularity of contemporary, regionaltraditions, with two examples taken from different regions and contexts. RichFreeman describes the fascinating phenomenon of the teyyam, the ritualizeddance-possession rituals of Kerala performed annually by low-caste specialists.Tracy Pintchman gives an account based on previously unpublished fieldwork,of women’s ritual devotions to Krishna in a Benares community, during themonth of Ka ̄rtik.3. Systematic thoughtMoving away from religious traditions and texts as such, part III is concernedwith systematic aspects of Indian thought. The part itself is divided into “TheIndian Sciences” and “Philosophy and Theology.” The section on the Indian sci-ences is a unique feature of this collection of essays, as these areas are so oftenneglected in introductory texts and surveys such as this. Rationality is not, ofcourse, the sole possession of the West, and India (as did China) developed veryearly an empirical investigation of the world, especially an inquiry into lan-guage, along with more speculative, philosophical inquiry. The purpose of thissection is an examination of some of these developments by scholars who haveworked closely together on this project, and to emphasize the importance of sys-tematic, rational thinking that, at some levels, feeds directly into the philosoph-ical discourse of the traditions. Frits Staal, whose work has done so much tohighlight the scientific and systematic nature of early Indian thought, beginswith a brief account of science in India followed by an essay on the science oflanguage, a precursor to modern linguistics. Takao Hayashi then discussesIndian mathematics and shows how mathematical knowledge developed frompractical concerns of calculation, not only in relation to state income, but inrelation to the need to make measurements for vedic ritual, particularly the fire altar. More abstract considerations developed and Hayashi discusses, forexample, an Indian proof of Pythagorean theorem. While astrology is oftenintroduction: establishing the boundaries15"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"acknowledged as an important feature of Indian traditions, the way in whichthe zodiacal signs relate to mathematics and temporal measurement is not oftenexplicated outside of specialist discussions. In his essay, Michio Yano explains theway in which the science of heavenly bodies (jyotih.s ́a ̄stra) developed, how theIndians adopted the Greek zodiac, and how this science relates to the measure-ment of time. Shifting from language, mathematics, and the cosmos to the body,Dominik Wujastyk takes up the inquiry, showing how an early science ofmedicine developed in India, a science that is still practiced today.Related to the discussion of the Indian sciences we have the development oflogic and rational thought which is often directed to a soteriological end in the Indian context. Jonardon Ganeri’s essay takes us through an account of thepractice of reason and its application to the goals of life. The various systems ofIndian philosophy and theology developed assuming these formal structures ofargument. In his essay on “Hindu theology” Francis Clooney critically examinesthis category and discusses some of the fundamental theological problems asthey are dealt with in the Indian sources. These include important questions asto whether there is a transcendent source of being and questions about theproblem of evil and suffering, concerns shared by Western theology as well.Clooney discusses responses to these questions through the practice of learningfrom scripture, meditation, and reasoned reflection. This very rich essay also dis-cusses theological language, the community in which theology takes place, andthe style of theological commentary. Related to both Indian linguistics andtheology, the essay by André Padoux gives an excellent account of the centralityof mantra in the history of Hindu traditions. He discusses the origin andmeaning of the word, of notable importance being Abhinavagupta’s definitionof mantra as forms of thought leading to liberation. Mantras occur early in theVeda but take on great importance in the Tantras, where mantra is related to thestructure of the hierarchical cosmos and to consciousness.4. Society, politics, and nationThe final part of the volume on “Society, Politics, and Nation” examines sociopo-litical themes of particular relevance to the contemporary world. Havingprovided great historical sweeps of the traditions we can now examine the devel-opment of Hinduism as an entity in the last two centuries in more detail, thecentral organizing principle of society, namely caste, the issue of nationhood,and the issue of gender. Declan Quigley’s essay on the caste system raises import-ant questions about the nature of social organization in India and asks thecentral question whether Hinduism can be separated from caste. Quigley thinksit can, but for interesting reasons that take us into problems of ritual and thegift. The forces of modernity linked to European ideas of progress and rational-ity have set themselves against caste. In his essay on modernity and the rise ofthe Hindu reform movement, Dermot Killingley traces the nineteenth-centuryhistory of Hindu reform with Rammohun Roy, the rise of the Brahmo Sama ̄j and16gavin flood"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"A ̄rya Sama ̄j, and the relation of social reform to the British rule of law interfac-ing with Hindu law. Developing the history into the twentieth century, C. RamPrasad shows the importance of the idea of Hinduism in contemporary Indiaand the wider Hindu world, discussing the ideology ofhindutva, the rise ofHindu nationalism, and political developments in the last years of the twentiethcentury. In parallel to this theme, Sumathi Ramaswamy shows how nationalismfunctions in relation to the Tamil language and its personification in the GoddessTamil ̄tta ̄y, a deity who performs a similar function to Mother India (Bha ̄ratMa ̄ta ̄). Vasudha Narayanan’s essay on gender takes the idea of the social con-struction of gender and examines this with particular reference to the S ́rı ̄Va i s.n.ava tradition (previously contextualized in Colas’s essay). The issues raisedby Narayanan of the relation of gender to sex, of role play to devotional sen-sibilities, are centrally important in understanding contemporary gender rolesin Hindu society.All of the essays in the volume are by recognized experts in their field. Thereader will appreciate in the range of material covered not only the richness andcomplexity of Hinduism, but also that Hinduism is a highly contested area ofdiscourse. Yet along with a sense of diversity and the fragmentation of differenttraditions, historical periods, and problems, it is also hoped that the reader willappreciate some of the links, common threads, and issues that persistentlyreoccur in the history of this vast and complex entity that “Hinduism” refers to.ReferencesBabb, L. 1975.

M. Forster describes his visit to a Hindu temple as a tourist’s pil-grimage driven by a mixture of curiosity, disinterestedness, loathing, and evenfear. Like the Hindu festival scene he paints in A Passage to India, the GokulAshtami festival he witnesses is characterized as an excess of color, noise, ritual,and devotional fervor. Forcing himself to refrain from passing judgment, Forsterfinds it impossible to retain his objectivity the closer he approaches the shrine,the cavern encasing the Hindu stone images (“a mess of little objects”) whichare the object of such frenzied devotion. Encircled by the press of ardent devo-tees, Forster is increasingly discomfited by their almost unbearable delirium.Surveying the rapt faces around him, he places the raucous scene against themore reassuring memory of the sober, stately, and measured tones of Anglicanworship. His revulsion and disgust reach a peak as he advances toward the altarand finds there only mute, gaudy, and grotesque stone where others see tran-scendent power (Forster 1953: 64).And then, just as Forster is about to move along in the ritual pilgrims’ for-mation, he turns back and sees the faces of the worshippers, desperate in theirfaith, hopelessly trusting in a power great enough to raise them from illness,poverty, trouble, and oppression. Transfixed by the scene, Forster sees reflectedin their eyes the altered image of the deity before them. As he wends his waythrough the crowd, he is overwhelmed by the confusion of multiple images ofthe Hinduism he has just witnessed: of garlanded, ash-smeared, bejeweled stoneon one hand, and of the inexpressible power of deepest personal yearnings,desires, and needs on the other. If he is disgusted by the noisy displays of Hinduworship, he is moved beyond words by the eloquent silence of the pain and tribu-lation from which believers seek deliverance. In their taut, compressed faces he"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"finds a Hinduism to which he can relate, as surely as he is alienated by the other face of Hinduism blazoned by conch shells, camphor, and cymbals. He canconclude that, though “there is no dignity, no taste, no form....I don’t thinkone ought to be irritated with Idolatry because one can see from the faces ofthe people that it touches something very deep in their hearts” (Forster 1953:64).Forster’s personal odyssey frames an experience of Hinduism that, in itsexquisite detail and ultimate compassion, is far more nuanced than is its por-trayal in some of his other better-known works. In A Passage to IndiaHinduismis depicted as a belief system with a “boum” effect, a metaphysically infuriatingreligion blurring the manichean divisions between good and evil that informwestern theology as much as western law, and comprise the dualities that helpto define the nature, cause, and agent of crime as well as its punishment. But asGodbole, the novel’s comically inscrutable Brahmin character, avers porten-tously, how can crime be known so categorically when all participate equally inits commission? If everyone is complicit in acts of evil, would not all have to bepunished equally too? It is this jumble of incoherent metaphysical murmurings,apparently sanctioned by Hindu belief, that exasperates Fielding, the Englishcharacter most sympathetic to India. Unlike the colonial officers ruling thecountry, Fielding develops an emotional affinity with Indians, particularly theeffervescent Muslim doctor Aziz. But even the resilient Fielding is overwhelmedby the bewildering course of events culminating in Aziz’s trial for rape of anEnglish woman and then his subsequent acquittal. The trial turns Aziz into afiery nationalist, willing to sacrifice even his friendship with Fielding to act uponhis newfound political consciousness. An ecstatic scene of Hindu devotionmarks the climax of the novel. As the birth of the god Krishna is celebrated, vir-tually turning princes and paupers alike into frolicking adolescents, the veryimagery of Hinduism as an infantilizing religion fuses into the central image ofthe infant Krishna. It is no wonder that after the explosive confrontation betweencolonizer and colonized unleashed by Aziz’s wrongful arrest, no one can tell, asthe English accuser Adele Quested discovers, whether evil lies in dark, hollowmountain caves or in the cavernous courtrooms of the colonial state. Theraucous Hindu festival confirms the indeterminacy of events and their causes.And as the disillusioned Fielding sets sail from India soon after these events, it isonly natural that he should feel the return of reassuring order and balance inhis life as he passes the stately, proportionate architecture of Venice, describedwith barely disguised relief as “the civilization that has escaped muddle” (Forster1970: 275). For Fielding, the decorum and harmony of the Venetian facadesrestore the principles of perspective and truth that had been entirely lost in thechaos of India, a chaos that is best represented by the metaphysical and aestheticinsufficiency of its religions: “The buildings of Venice, like the mountains ofCrete and the fields of Egypt, stood in the right place, whereas in India every-thing was placed wrong. He had forgotten the beauty of form among idoltemples and lumpy hills; indeed, without form, how can there be beauty?”(Forster 1970: 275).24gauri viswanathan"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"The Modernity of HinduismThat so sympathetic a figure as Fielding should resort to western aesthetic stan-dards to evaluate Hinduism is a measure of how corrosive was the colonial expe-rience even for those more favorably disposed to India. The western frameworkwas never far from being a point of reference, even when the object was to cri-tique the doctrinaire aspects of Christianity and uphold the east as a spiritualmodel for the materialistic west. An inability to view Hinduism on its own termshas shaped the study of comparative religion, whether to prove the superiorityof Christianity or to show that Hinduism is part of the Christian teleology; todemonstrate, as Antony Copley calls it, a universalist theology that includesHinduism as much as it does Christianity (Copley 1997: 58). The phase ofwestern scholarly engagement with eastern religions, commonly referred to asthe period of Orientalism, is often described as less hostile to Indian culture thanthe Anglicism that superseded it. Yet colonial perceptions of Hinduism shouldnot be divided along the lines of those who were positively inclined and thosewho were opposed, since this assumes hostile reactions are produced by theintrusion of a western framework of reference and benevolent ones by its sus-pension, whereas it is clear the same frame persists regardless of whether theattitude is positive or negative.1The comparative perspective reveals that westernobservers of Hinduism were just as keenly assessing Christianity’s place inEuropean world domination as they were looking toward other belief systems tolocate the roots of a proto-religion.The interest in other religions was inevitably sparked by the need to chart theprogress of civilization on scientific principles, which included tracing the evo-lution of religious consciousness. The search for earlier prototypes of the moreevolved religions, of which Christianity was the prime example, led scholars toseek out comparable features, such as monotheism, a salvational scheme, andnotions of the afterlife, in other religions. While the earliest travelers recordedtheir accounts of idolatrous worship by the peoples of India (Embree 1971), laterscholars found in Vedic, Sanskrit hymns some indication that the object of Hinduworship was not mere stone but an abstract entity bearing some resemblance tothe object of monotheistic worship. For such scholars, “Hinduism” was locatedin this combination of oral and written texts, and this textualized Hinduism wassoon privileged as the religion on which subsequent attention was focused.Though Sanskritic Hinduism was far from representative of the worship ofdiverse peoples, it was made to define a whole range of heterogeneous practicesthat were then lumped together to constitute a single religious tradition termed“Hinduism” (Hardy 1995).2The new textual discoveries of the eighteenth century led British Orientalistslike William Jones, Nathaniel Halhed, and Henry Colebrooke to conclude thatthe religion practiced by Hindus was highly evolved, confounding the colonialassumption that all cultures outside the Christian pale were primitive, tribalis-tic, and animistic. As a result, in acknowledgement of the religious authoritycolonialism and the construction of hinduism25"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"wielded by Hindu pandits (learned, religious men) who also doubled as nativeinformants and commentators of Sanskrit texts, British authorities scrupulouslysought to co-opt them in the colonial enterprise. Rather than alienate them byopposing their practices, administrators found it more strategic to use theirknowledge as the basis for codification of Hindu law. Such accommodation ofnative knowledge and practices was in stark contrast to colonialism’s systematiceffacement of indigenous practices of religious worship in certain African soci-eties (Hefner 1993).Whether as rank superstition or sublime philosophy, Hinduism challenged theunimpeded exercise of British rule, especially when it was perceived to be closelyassociated with the spread of Christianity. Because they feared that the colonialcontrol of India would be regarded entirely as a Christianizing mission, Britishadministrators remained at a distance from Christian missionaries and kept aclose eye on their activities to ensure that they did not jeopardize their strategicrelations with the comprador classes by provoking conflict with Hindus. To besure, current scholarship gives much less attention to the colonial engagementwith Indian Islam than with Hinduism (although there are notable exceptions:Lelyveld 1978; Metcalf 1982; Gilmartin 1988). The standard rationale is thatIslam, like Christianity, was monotheistic, and since Christian missionaries weresingularly focused on an anti-idolatry campaign, which Islam also shared, Chris-tianity and Islam would seem to share similar goals, at least with regard to Hin-duism. Yet interestingly Christian missionaries never saw themselves in alliancewith Muslims in their campaign against Hinduism. In fact, there was a three-way contestation between Hindu pandits, Christian missionaries, and Muslimand Sufipirswhose impact lies in the development of a field of apologetics assert-ing the claims of the respective religions. In his study of anti-Christian apolo-getics, Richard Fox Young suggests that “at about the time that Hindu panditswere recovering from their reluctance to counteract the threat posed by an alienand increasingly powerful religion in their midst, scholarly Christian evangelistswere engaged in developing specialized terminology in Sanskrit for propagatingtheir message more effectively than had theretofore been possible” (Young 1981:15; Young’s focus is on Hinduism’s refutation of Christianity rather than ofIslam). In this context Young deems it more appropriate to term the develop-ments in India post-1850 not as renascent but as resistantHinduism.One of the most striking advances in modern scholarship is the view thatthere is no such thing as an unbroken tradition of Hinduism, only a set of dis-crete traditions and practices reorganized into a larger entity called “Hinduism”(Frykenberg 1989; von Stietencron 1989). If there is any disagreement at all inthis scholarship, it centers on whether Hinduism is exclusively a construct ofwestern scholars studying India or of anticolonial Hindus looking toward thesystematization of disparate practices as a means of recovering a precolonial,national identity. Many will argue that there is in fact a dialectical relationbetween the two. In this view, as summarized by Richard King in Orientalism andReligion, nationalist Hindus appropriated a construct developed by Orientalistscholars and used it for their own purposes, producing the notion of a cultur-26gauri viswanathan"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"ally superior Hinduism. In turn, nationalist adaptations of Orientalist scholar-ship formed the basis for contemporary (New Age?) representations of India asthe eternal land of spirituality. The important point is that Orientalism remainsthe point of reference for Hinduism’s current identification with mysticism andspirituality. Indeed, the work of King among others suggests that it is oftenimpossible to distinguish western understandings of Hinduism from those ofIndian nationalists, since “through the colonially established apparatus of thepolitical, economic, and educational institutions of India, contemporary Indianself-awareness remains deeply influenced by Western presuppositions about the nature of Indian culture” (King 1999: 117). In this view, all notions ofHinduism deployed by Indian nationalists to create an overarching culturalunity have little reference to the lived religious experience of the people but,rather, derive from Western readings of a textualized Hinduism reconfigured tocorrespond to the compulsions of the Judeo-Christian tradition.To be sure, British colonialism’s relation with Hinduism has long been afraught one, ranging from antagonism to admiration, with a good measure ofsheer indifference thrown in between. Some scholars argue there was no suchthing as Hinduism in precolonial India, only a set of traditions and practicesreorganized by western scholars to constitute a system then arbitrarily named“Hinduism” (Frykenberg 1989). The most radical position states that Hinduismis not a single religion but rather a group of amorphous Indian religions. Hein-rich von Stietencron writes that “Hinduism. . . does not meet the fundamentalrequirements of a historical religion of being a coherent system; but its distinctreligious entities do. They are indeed religions, while Hinduism is not” (vonStietencron 1989: 20). In denying Hinduism the status of a religion because itdoes not constitute a coherent system, this view considers modern Hinduism tobe the product of a sociohistorical process distinct from the evolution of a doc-trinal system based on successive accretions of philosophical thought. The for-mation of modern Hinduism involves Christian missionaries and Hindurevivalist organizations alike, which both contribute to the systematization ofdisparate traditions for their own purposes.However, the “construction of Hinduism” theory has several limitations. Inan effort to recover a more heterogeneous and diachronically diverse religion,some scholars present modern Hinduism as more unified than it actually is.Richard G. Fox’s critique of Ronald Inden’s anti-Orientalist approach is relevantin this context. Fox’s argument that anti-Orientalism preserves the stereotypesit seeks to demolish can be extended to the field of Hinduism studies (Fox 1993:144–5). The tendency to interpret modern Hinduism as the unification of a looseconglomeration of different belief systems remains trapped within a monothe-istic conception of religion, which constitutes the final reference point forjudging whether religions are coherent or not. Nineteenth-century Hindureformers, seeking to rid religion of the features most attacked by Christian mis-sionaries, are believed to have been driven by a similar will to monotheism intheir attempts to make the Hindu religion correspond more rigorously to theJudeo-Christian conceptions of a single, all-powerful deity. Only to the extentcolonialism and the construction of hinduism27"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"that the western attribution of unity to Hinduism strategically helped anticolo-nial Indians create a national identity in religion can it be said that western dis-courses customized indigenous religions for native consumption. The notionthat modern Hinduism represents a false unity imposed on diverse traditionsreplays a western fascination with – and repulsion from – Indian polytheism. Inthis enduring perception, the existence of many gods must surely indicate theywere the basis of many smaller religions and therefore to describe them underthe rubric of “Hinduism” as if they constituted a single religious system must befalse, a distortion of heterogeneous religious practices. The reluctance of manyscholars to call Hinduism a religion because it incorporates many disparate prac-tices suggests that the Judeo-Christian system remains the main reference pointfor defining religions. Pointing out that “there is no single, privileged narrativeof the modern world,” Talal Asad warns against the dangers of writing thehistory of world religions from the narrow perspective of Judeo-Christian history(Asad 1993: 9).Moreover, while conceding the need to examine the Orientalist and colonialcontributions to Hinduism’s modern-day form, one would need to be wary ofascribing total hegemony to western discourses, which are given such power incontemporary scholarship – even in work which purports to be anti-Orientalist– that they appear to rob Indians of any agency in redefining Hinduism for theirown purposes. The view that Indians’ understanding of Hinduism is primarilydrawn from western sources minimizes the significance of local, vernaculartraditions for conveying a variety of precepts that are no less “Hindu” than those derived from the neo-Veda ̄nta canon popularized in the west. These oftenwent unnoticed by western commentators, who continued to insist that their“discovery” of Hinduism in such texts as The Bhagavad Gı ̄ta ̄facilitated Indians’attempt to find a cohesive unity in disparate branches of indigenous worship.Yet The Bhagavad Gı ̄ta ̄, which exerted a powerful influence on Mohandas K.Gandhi’s concept of social action and is said to have reached him primarilythrough Edwin Arnold’s English translation, first affected him through hismother’s daily recitation of it in Gujarati (Gandhi 1957: 4–5). Gandhi attributeshis self-consciousness as a believing Hindu to his mother’s influence, to the oraltraditions she made available to him lying outside the formal instruction hereceived in school and elsewhere. Yet he also contrasts instinctive religious devo-tionalism, as derived from his mother, with rational critical reflection, whichwestern commentaries on Hinduism helped him to develop.3The presence of vernacular traditions of Hinduism reminds one how difficultit is to locate the precise point at which classical Sanskrit texts became synony-mous with Hinduism. It is clearly not sufficient to resort to a “colonial inventionof tradition” explanation, with its suggestion that Sanskrit had no prior hege-mony in Indian societies before the period of British colonialism. No doubtSanskrit was a dominant discourse in the precolonial period and acknowledgedas such by the Orientalists who undertook its study since the eighteenth century.At the same time, Sanskrit literature contains a heterodox tradition that nevergets represented in Western discourse.4When its dissenting strains are incorpo-28gauri viswanathan"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"rated into Hinduism, they contribute to that religion’s internal tensions. ThusSanskrit’s identification with Hinduism is itself a fraught one. One of the primedifficulties in determining the origins of Hinduism’s interchangeability with theSanskrit literary tradition is how effortlessly that tradition has been naturalized,so much so that it is no longer possible to distinguish between its precolonialauthoritative status and its construction by British Orientalism.At the same time, the new scholarship reveals as much as about the chargedpolitical climate of the 1980s and 1990s in which it was produced as it doesabout the modern history of Hinduism. After all, the absorption of smaller, localcults into a larger entity is not an unfamiliar one, and anthropological theoryhas long described the process of Hinduization as involving precisely such amal-gamations. To scholars like Heinrich von Stietencron, the earlier anthropologi-cal approach is unsatisfactory because it is too rigidly structuralist in itsorientation and presumes that Hinduism “naturally” evolves from its absorptionof smaller cults (von Stietencron 1989: 71). Yet von Stietencron himself showsthat Hinduization occurred in pre-Muslim India, when a competitive religiousspirit among various sects – S ́aivas, Vais.n.avas, Jainas, Bauddhas, Sma ̄rtasamong others – created a tendency to make one religious view prevail over theothers.5Even without the pressure of a foreign religion, which might havebrought competing cults closer together if only to present a concerted frontagainst external threat, the rituals and texts of these various sects prescribedways of inducting believers into a dominant cult and making it prevail.Somas ́ambhu’s manual, the Somas ́ambhupaddhati, written approximately in thesecond half of the eleventh century, is the best known example of a text thatprepared initiates to enter S ́aivism. Its procedural rituals laid the foundation foran enhancement of S ́aivism’s power through mass conversions, one of the key elements in the expansion of religion and as vital to Hinduization as toChristianization or Islamization for the growth of these religions.What then distinguishes Hinduization in earlier periods of history from thenineteenth-century construction of Hinduism as a national religion? After all,there is no reason why the pre-Muslim integration of other religious groupswithin a Hindu framework should not be regarded as a “construction,” despitesupporting evidence that during this time frame there was a superimposition ofritual structures on already existing rituals (von Stietencron 1989: 71). Von Sti-etencron’s analysis offers a clue, for it suggests that ideological, structural, andinstitutional differences between the Hinduism of pre-sixteenth-century Indiaand that of the nineteenth century make it impossible to describe the latter for-mation in terms of Hinduization. One crucial difference is the concept of thenation-state that becomes available to Hindus through the impact of Britishcolonialism. Not only was the Hinduism of the earlier period different, becausespiritual leadership was centered in the charismatic authority of individualfigures (gurus) rather than in all-India, institutional bodies. More importantly,Hinduism was also driven by a missionary zeal to strengthen the claims to sal-vation of one path rather than many paths. This reflects a pattern consistentwith the way conversion works to augment the power of one belief system andcolonialism and the construction of hinduism29"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"gain new adherents by absorbing multiple groups into its fold. After all, earlyChristianity’s growth was precisely through such accretions of smaller cults intoa larger institution by means of conversion, and Hinduization in the precolonialperiod follows a similar pattern of augmentation (Hefner 1993). By contrast, thenewly invigorated Hinduism of the nineteenth century is constituted as anexclusive defense against the assault of “foreign” religions, Christianity as muchas Islam. This new Hinduism borrows features from European modernity andrational religion; most importantly, it relies on the concept of the nation-state inorder to claim a national, all-India character.6The Problem of HistoriographyThis differential history notwithstanding, the more interesting question to askconcerns the production of knowledge. What developments in history andmethod have enabled recent scholars to study Hinduism as a relatively modernconstruction? And to what extent, if at all, are these developments related tostudies of the invention of tradition in other disciplines and regions? Since thepublication of Eric Hobsbawm and Terence Ranger’s influential collection ofessays The Invention of Traditionin 1983, there has been a proliferation of studiesdrawing upon the insights of Foucault and Gramsci in order to examine the representation of governmental stratagems as eternal verities. The structure of rituals and ceremonials, diverse schools of thought, academic disciplines, andkey canonical texts have all come under the steady gaze of historians, anthro-pologists, and literary critics, who have turned to examining the conditionsreorganizing class interests into unbroken, universal traditions. “Invention oftradition” studies are popular in western scholarship because they have alloweda productive application of both Marxist and poststructuralist theories. Theyhave also opened up a new historiography that claims a skepticism towards allforms of positivism and empiricism, just as it also casts suspicion on concepts oforigins as privileged sites of authority.Yet for all the parallels between the new historiography and contemporaryscholarship on the colonial construction of Hinduism, poststructuralism is notthe immediate context for studies of Hinduism as a modern construction,though its insights have certainly been important in developing new approachesto the study of Hinduism. Rather, recognition of Hinduism’s modernity is possi-ble because of (1) the recent rise of political parties claiming Hindu nationalismas their main election platform (Jaffrelot 1996; Hansen 1999); (2) the import-ant contributions of feminist scholarship to a reexamination of Hinduism andpatriarchy (Sangari and Vaid 1998; Mani 1998; Viswanathan 1998); and (3)the growing power of formerly “untouchable” groups in both changing thepolitical equations and challenging the cultural history of India as a historywritten by the upper castes. These developments in Indian politics, feminism,and caste structures resist any attempts to write off the new scholarship as30gauri viswanathan"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"merely derivative of western academic trends. Indeed, just as much as the sub-altern studies collective may be said to have inspired a wave of studies “frombelow,” so too the urgency of the challenges before the Indian electorate hasgiven a new political edge to the study of the “invention of tradition.” The pointof reference for much of this scholarship is the present struggle for powerbetween so-called secular and religious forces in India. Critical work is motivatedby the perception that contemporary electoral politics is caught up in a web of(mis)perceptions of Hinduism that stretch as far back as the first missions toIndia and the period of British colonialism. One of the key concepts introducedby democracy and the nation-state is numerical representativeness. “Majority”and “minority” are equally legitimate categories organizing the electorate. Theneed to prove the claims of belonging to a majority group is a powerful one, sopowerful that it contributes to a mythology of a coherent religious traditionsanctioned by scripture, confirmed by ritual, and perpetuated by daily practice.“This, indeed, is a case where nationalist politics in a democratic setting suc-ceeded in propagating Hindu religious unity in order to obtain an impressivestatistical majority when compared with other religious communities” (vonStietencron 1989: 52).Likewise, feminist scholarship has had a powerful effect on the deconstruc-tion of Hinduism as a patriarchal religion. Some of the most powerful insightsinto the colonial construction of Hinduism have come from the perspective ofgender studies. Studies ofsatı ̄(Mani 1998), female conversions (Viswanathan1998), and prepubertal marriages and the age of consent (Chakravarty 1998;Sinha 1995; Chandra 1998) show the extent to which Hindu law was reorga-nized in British courts to affirm the values and goals of the Hindu elite, theuppercaste Brahmans. Far from applying legal insights based on local practices,as urged by a few exceptional British voices such as James Nelson, British judgesrelied on the textual interpretations offered by Hindu pandits. Nelson, register-ing his vehement disapproval of such excessive reliance on elite Hindu inter-preters, urged that colonial administrators attend to the nuances of local customand practice to decide points of law, rather than force Sanskrit-based law uponnon-Hindu peoples.7And finally, the political rise ofdalits, or noncaste groups known also as“untouchables,” put a dent into Hinduism as an expression of brahmanism. Thewritings of dalit leader Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar punctured the logic of castehegemony and retold the history of India as a struggle between a power-hungrybut stagnant Hinduism and a flourishing Buddhism. In Ambedkar’s retelling ofHinduism’s conquest of Buddhism, those Buddhists who refused to convert toHinduism or adopt its non-meat-eating practices were turned into chattel labor.Thus, according to Ambedkar, untouchability was a result of the refusalof Bud-dhists to reconvert to Hinduism, not of their social inferiority. In historicizinguntouchability, Ambedkar restored a sense of agency to dalits.As some scholars have noted, one of the pitfalls in challenging the national-ist, exclusivist evocation of an ancient religion, existing uninterruptedly for fivethousand years, is that its opposite is asserted more as a matter of counter-colonialism and the construction of hinduism31"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"argument than historicity. In the attempt to disparage the contemporary Hinduideologues, Hinduism is also being rewritten as a religion that “originally” hadmultiple differentiations that have now been lost under the umbrella term “Hin-duism.” To some extent, this has involved rewriting the very category of religion.If we can assume that most religions have sects, would the presence of S ́aivas,Va i s.n.avas, Jainas, and other groups, though many in number, necessarily inval-idate the existence of a loose confederation of religions called Hinduism? Afterall, the early history of Christianity is no less divided along sectarian lines (somewith hairsplitting differences), yet few would deny calling it by the name ofChristianity. In the case of Hinduism’s history, is the motivation to debunk theclaims of Hindu ideologues driving the writing of another history, whichinvolves the separation of “religion” from “sect” and a view of each sect as con-stituting a separate religion? Indeed, S ́aivism is now considered as different fromVa i s.n.avism as it is from, say, Buddhism, yet S ́aivism and Vais.n.avism have tradi-tionally been described as two competing sects of Hinduism. The important con-tribution of the new scholarship is that, by questioning whether even rival sectscan be regarded as part of one religion, it disaggregates religion from territori-ality. After all, if S ́aivism and Vais.n.avism have different forms of worship, dif-ferent scriptures, and different concepts of the godhead, one must confront thequestion whether they are regarded as part of Hinduism solely because they areconfined to the specific geography of the subcontinent. Such questions force acritical distance from conventional notions of religion and nationality, and pro-hibit a discourse of origins based on geography and territory from taking root.History as contested ground is equally evident in what Partha Chatterjeedescribes as Hindu nationalism’s “consciousness of a solidarity that is supposedto act itself out in history,” as much as in the secularist attempt to deconstructthat unity as a contrived one (Chatterjee 1993: 110).Secondly, in seeking to critique Hindu nationalism without rejectingHinduismin toto, some scholars have felt the need to assert a preexistingHindu–Muslim harmony that had subsequently been disrupted by the policies ofa divisive colonial government. Ashis Nandy, for instance, distinguishes Hin-duism as a way of life from religious ideology, and argues that as a daily prac-tice Hinduism has traditionally observed religious tolerance, but that subsequentmanipulations by state and local political forces disrupted the amity betweenMuslims and Hindus (Nandy 1993). Drawing upon such data as the 1911Census, he points out that in some parts of Gujarat individuals identified them-selves as “Mohammedan Hindus,” and he concludes that these overlappingidentities serve to question the arbitrary categories imposed by the Britishadministration for its own bureaucratic purposes. No doubt observations of thiskind are occasioned by a strategic necessity to recuperate some aspect of indige-nous life not wholly overtaken by colonial power. If Hinduism as a way of life isasked to serve this role, it is offered as an acknowledgement that the social prac-tices of people, as well as their ways of relating and cohabiting with members ofother communities, are organized around religion. Religion as social organiza-tion and relationality need not necessarily be equivalent to religious ideology, as32gauri viswanathan"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Nandy argues, and such distinctions would have to be made to do justice to reli-gion’s instrumental value in allowing communities to develop. It is certainly truethat on the many occasions when communal violence has broken out in India,activist groups (like Sahmat, for instance) are prone to evoking an earlier spiritof precolonial Hindu–Muslim harmony, tragically marred by the destructive anddivisive legacies of the colonial state which persist into the structures of post-colonial India. In fiction Amitav Ghosh evokes memories of a similar fraternalspirit as a counterpoint to the unbearable horror of religious violence betweenHindus and Muslims in the aftermath of partition (Ghosh 1992; Viswanathan1995: 19–34).The Impetus for Reform in HinduismThe colonial policy of “divide and rule” has had some of its deepest conse-quences for Hinduism, its relation to Indian Islam not being the least of them.British colonialism’s attitude to Hinduism has long been a fraught one, rangingfrom antagonism to admiration, but never complete indifference. The existenceof a highly evolved religious system practiced by the Hindus confounded thecolonial assumption that all cultures outside the Christian pale were primitive,tribalistic, and animistic. Confronting the religious authority wielded by Hindupandits, British authorities scrupulously sought to win their allegiance ratherthan alienate them by opposing their practices. This led to strategies of co-optation, which was in stark contrast to colonialism’s systematic effacement ofindigenous practices of religious worship in other colonized societies, particu-larly in Africa and the Caribbean. Because of the colonial state’s complex nego-tiation of Hinduism, conversion, as well as colonial governance and educationalpolicy, followed a different course in India than in other colonized societies. Theprominence of education in the preoccupations of administrators and mission-aries alike can be attributed to the recognition that the exercise of militarystrength – in the case of administrators – or the practice of itinerating – in thecase of missionaries – was not sufficient to securing the consent of the colonized.Subjects had to be persuaded about the intrinsic merits of English culture andChristianity if they were to cooperate willingly in the colonial project(Viswanathan 1989; Copley 1997). The Gramscian theory of hegemony byconsent has one of its strongest proofs in the Indian case, as colonial adminis-trators sought to win the consent of Indians. Modifying Indian attitudes to Hin-duism was central to the project. One result was the creation of a whole class ofIndians alienated from their own culture and religion, even as they were sys-tematically excluded from full participation in the structures of self-governance.It was this class that was later to initiate a series of reforms of Hinduism andestablish its modern identity. While some prominent Hindus converted to Chris-tianity, their conversions did not necessarily signify a pro-colonial stance, con-trary to what many of their countrymen believed. In fact, many converts werecolonialism and the construction of hinduism33"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"also part of the momentum to reform Hinduism. Pandita Ramabai, CorneliaSorabjee, Krupabai Satthianadhan, and Narayan Viman Tilak, who all convertedto Christianity, were also central figures in the major social reform movementsof the nineteenth century. Keshab Chander Sen was one of the founders of theBrahmo Samaj, a reform movement intended to make Hinduism less caste-basedand less focused on idol worship and rituals. Tilak turned to vernacular sourcesto find a meeting point between Hinduism and Christianity, which he wanted to make a national rather than foreign religion. Ramabai, Sorabjee, and Satthianadhan were all involved with women’s reform: Ramabai established ahome for widows in Pune; Sorabjee was trained as an advocate in England andwas keenly involved with issues of property reform, as well as the professionaleducation of women; and Satthianadhan, trained as a medical doctor, took upthe cause of education for women (Kosambi 1999; Satthianadhan 1998).One reason why Indian converts to Christianity were able to maintain a dis-tance from the colonial state was that the history of Christian missions in Indiawas never identical with British colonialism, though this is not to say the mis-sions opposed the colonization of India. Until the passing of the Charter Act of1813 there were numerous curbs on missionary activity in India because of theapprehension that it jeopardized the Company’s relations with a primarily Hindupopulation. An insurrection at Vellore, near Madras, in 1806 was blamed onmissionary proselytization, and the Company feared that Hindu resentmentwould soon spread and threaten the delicate relationship it had established withIndian merchants. In the name of protecting the Company’s commercial inter-ests, a policy of religious neutrality was encouraged, whereby the Companyrefrained from interfering in indigenous religions. This did not imply that theCompany approved of Hinduism, but merely that they considered their ownmercantile interests more important. So scrupulous were Company officials ingiving no offense that they were even willing to provide funds for religiousschools and employ panditsandshastrisas local informants, a practice thatappalled Macaulay and James Mill who denounced such funding as a violationof religious neutrality.8Missionaries too used this as an opportunity to exposethe inconsistencies of the Company, which put restrictions on the work of Chris-tian missionaries but gave grants to Hindu and Muslim schools. Missionariesraised a fierce uproar, organizing the Anti-Idolatry Connexion League inresponse, and were so vociferous in their protests that in 1833 the governmentwas forced to withdraw its funding and leave the religious endowments in thehands of Hindu religious bodies. Though it was not until 1863 that a law waspassed that officially mandated noninterference, Robert Frykenberg argues that by this time a new Hindu public had begun to emerge, which drew uponthe “structure of legal precedents for the rise of an entirely new religion”(Frykenberg 1989: 37).Whether it was perceived negatively or positively, Hinduism posed an effectivechallenge to the unalloyed exertion of British rule, especially considered inter-changeably with the spread of Christianity. The colonial engagement withIndian Islam was never as intense as it was with Hinduism. The conventional34gauri viswanathan"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"explanation is that Islam, like Christianity, was monotheistic, and Christian mis-sionaries were far more focused on an anti-idolatry campaign that Islam, tosome extent, also shared. Yet Christian missionaries never saw themselves inalliance with Muslim pirs, and there was indeed a three-way contestationbetween Christianity, Hinduism, and Islam revealing that the tensions betweenreligions have as much to do with historical rivalries between them as withwhether they are monotheistic or polytheistic. James Mill regarded Islam morefavorably than Hinduism, yet attributed the decline of the Indian polity in theeighteenth century to effete Islamic rule (Mill 1858). The relationship of reli-gion to effective governance, rather than the merits of doctrine, emerges in suchaccounts as the yardstick for evaluating the quality of religion. A civilizationaltheory of religion, akin to Hegel’s schematization of phases of religious devel-opment, gained ground as the post-Enlightenment rationale for religion inculture. Under these conditions, both Hinduism and Islam came under sharpattack for their role in the decline and stagnation of material growth. Chris-tianity’s identification with the ascendancy of western civilization was the sinequa nonof such attacks.James Mill marked a disruptive moment in the European perception of Hin-duism. After a long period of opprobrium, when Hinduism was considered akinto Catholicism in its “paganism” and rank superstition, Hinduism came to be discovered as a highly sophisticated philosophical system. The discovery went intandem with a progressive, cosmopolitan Enlightenment project that sought outnatural reason in religion as the feature that distinguished it from supernatu-ralism. In India, one consequence of the progressive, cosmopolitan Enlighten-ment project is to argue that only those elements of native culture that accordwith natural reason are authentically Indian and hence that all other nativeSouth Asian cultural practices are monstrous and inappropriate for a moderncivil society. A Veda ̄ntic concept of Hinduism was already in the making, as anabstract, theistic philosophical system came to represent Hinduism, while allother popular practices were denounced as idolatrous. The splitting of Hinduisminto popular and intellectual systems contributed to a parallel splitting of anti-colonial responses into those for whom popular beliefs and “superstitions” werean essential part of Hindu identity and those for whom Hinduism was purged ofsome of its casteist, polytheistic, and ritualistic features. Dipesh Chakrabarty hasshown how popular beliefs confounded both colonizers and Indian intellectualsalike and came to be identified with a sinister, subversive underside of subalternopposition (Chakrabarty 2000: 72–113). Increasingly, there is more interest inthese subaltern expressions of Hinduism as the site of an anticolonial, anticas-teist resistance that rewrites the very categories of “natural reason” and “super-naturalism.” Looking at peasant “superstitions” and animistic beliefs also offersalternative views of Hinduism obscured by the elitist monopoly of theisticreligion.But for Indian intellectuals intent on purifying Hinduism of its popular, idol-atrous associations, a newly defined religion could give them an identity com-patible with the modernity they craved, while retaining their roots in indigenouscolonialism and the construction of hinduism35"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"traditions. The Hinduism of Veda ̄nta perfectly fit their needs. A rational religionconsisting of intellectual systems and critical epistemologies, modern Hinduismmade Christianity appear nonrational, intuitive, and idiosyncratic, a religionriddled with inconsistencies and confusing dogmas. To Hindus seeking rationalbases in religion, the concept of the Trinity was one of Christianity’s most vexingpuzzles. The Christian convert Pandita Ramabai’s main quarrel with Trinitari-anism was that its concepts of God, the Son, and the Holy Spirit dispersed deityin three different figures, and confounded the promise of monotheism that ledher to leave Hinduism in the first place. By contrast, Veda ̄ntic Hinduism pos-sessed almost a cold logic that the Hindu elite could proudly display as a sign oftheir own cultural superiority. Moreover, its severe intellectualism was com-patible with the scientific temperament, unlike in the west where religion andscience were virtually opposed terms. This was a religion Hindus could be proudof: instead of gaudily decorated stone, theirs was a Hinduism of the mind, thatfaculty praised by the colonizers as the index of civilization.On the other hand, the push toward a monotheistic version of Hinduism wasintended to contest Christianity on its own ground and win back converts to theHindu fold by offering the same egalitarian promises as Christianity. The A ̄ryaSama ̄j, to name one of the most successful of these movements, eliminated manyof the cumbersome rituals of Hinduism and loosened caste strictures. It wasespecially attractive to those who were neither keen on converting to Christian-ity nor content to remain in a past-oriented Hinduism, out of touch with thecompulsions of modernity. Although Hinduism traditionally claimed that,unlike Christianity and Islam, it was not a proselytizing religion and that Hinduswere born not made, the A ̄rya Sama ̄j introduced practices that unsettled thoseclaims. A practice akin to the baptismal rites of conversion, the ritual purifica-tory act ofs ́uddhiinitiated non-Hindus to the religion (Seunarine 1977). Thoughclaiming earlier scriptural antecedents, s ́uddhiwas intended to help Hindusreclaim converts to Christianity. The ritual is an example of how Hinduismadapted to the new challenges set by colonialism by borrowing some of the veryfeatures – such as conversion – that it had earlier repudiated, claiming Hin-duism’s privileged status on the basis of birth. Reconversion rituals have been afundamental part of modern Hinduism’s attempt to reclaim and sustain itsmajoritarian status.Orientalism and reformism thus often went together in the nineteenth-century construction of Hinduism. If the Hinduism approved by Orientalismreflected a European view of natural religion, reform movements were a doublereflection of that view. Orientalism and reform enter a dialectic that kept Hin-duism bolted within the vise of European perceptions – as if in an interlockingset of infinite mirrors – regardless of whether the intent of Hindu reformers wasto break free of them or not. The texts that reformers consulted were often basedon translations authorized by western scholars, such as William Jones, CharlesWilkins, Nathaniel Halhed, Henry Colebrooke, and Henry Prinsep. Rarely didreformers turn to oral traditions or local practices for alternative understand-ings of Hinduism. Rosane Rocher’s argument that the privileging of Veda ̄nta by36gauri viswanathan"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"the British and by reform movements within Hinduism was an “accident of intel-lectual history” fails to account for why reformism was so restricted in its rangeof textual sources (Rocher 1993). Jadunath Sarkar, a Bengali reformer, revealshow narrow was this range:In the nineteenth century we recovered our long lost ancient literatures, Vedic andBuddhistic, as well as the buried architectural monuments of Hindu days. TheVedas and their commentaries had almost totally disappeared from the plains ofAryavarta where none could interpret them; none had even a complete manuscriptof the texts. The English printed these ancient scriptures of the Indo-Aryans andbrought them to our doors. (Sarkar 1979: 84 in Chakravarty 1998)The core of Hindu tradition was located in the Vedas and the Upanis.ads, the timeof whose composition marked the golden age of India’s civilization. The won-drous past unearthed by Orientalist scholars became all the more valuable to theindigenous literati as they faced a present denounced by missionaries and utili-tarian reformers alike for its benightedness and social inequalities.However, drawing upon Orientalist scholarship does not mean that Hindureformers were passive recipients of knowledge about their glorious past. AsUma Chakravarty points out, the indigenous elite were “active agents in con-structing the past and were consciously engaged in choosing particular elementsfrom the embryonic body of knowledge flowing from their own current socialand political concerns” (Chakravarty 1998: 32). These concerns interacted withthe texts made available by Orientalist scholars through translations and newcritical editions, which enabled a reinterpretation of the past as a vital period ofIndian history from which a more positive Hinduism could be reconstructedfrom its now fallen state.Of particular interest in the return to the golden past was a search for a timewhen women held a more exalted position than at present or under Muslim rule.Instead of denouncing Hinduism for perpetuating degrading practices like satı ̄and infant marriage, as Christian missionaries did, Hindu reformers resolved theproblem of seeming to approve a religion they themselves felt some distancefrom, by claiming that the earlier history of Hinduism showed a much more pos-itive attitude to women. This move consisted of evoking heroic women figures inHindu narratives, like Savitrı ̄, Gargı ̄, and Maitreyı ̄, whose devotion to their hus-bands not only earned them the exalted title ofpativrata, but whose learning,resilience, courage, and assertiveness also made them particularly worthy ofgeneral emulation, particularly in a colonial setting where the emasculation of men threatened to rob people of strong role models. Such an exalted view ofwomen in Indian history was in stark contrast to the general portrayal of womenas victims, which missionaries were fond of depicting when they alluded to thepractices of widow burning, female infanticide, and child marriage. Early Hin-duism’s capacity to give women a place in society beyond their subordination tomen was an underlying refrain in the writings of reformers, who remaineddependent on Orientalist presentations of their own texts to them. That thesecolonialism and the construction of hinduism37"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"presentations drew upon some of the west’s own romantic longings for someessential spiritual unity was not lost on the Hindu elite, whose spiritualizationof women, as Partha Chatterjee points out, compensated for their emasculationby colonial control (Chatterjee 1993).Significantly, the impetus to look for alternative traditions often came fromChristian converts who, imbued with a desire to address Hinduism’s shortcom-ings, turned to folk traditions to locate other ways of finding a synthesis of Hin-duism and Christianity that could truly be called indigenous. For instance, theMarathi poet Narayan Viman Tilak, who converted to Christianity, was a majorIndian nationalist figure who used his conversion as a standpoint from which tooffer proposals for a revitalized India. He believed Christianity could help ridHinduism of its casteist features, yet at the same time he wanted to indigenizeChristianity to make it more adaptable to the needs and emotions of the people,as well as to critique the alienating effects of British colonialism. Dissatisfied with Sanskrit texts because they excluded the mass of people, he turned to the older Marathi devotional poetry of Jña ̄nes ́var, Na ̄mdev, and Tuka ̄ra ̄m (through whom he claimed he reached Jesus Christ), and sought to adapt thebhajanform to Christian hymns (Viswanathan 1998: 40). The result was aunique synthesis of Hindu and Christian cultural forms, largely made possibleby mining the folk traditions ignored by Hindu reformers.Hinduism and Colonial LawIt was in the arena of law that Hinduism received its most definitive colonialreworking. This is one of the most complicated and dense aspects of Britain’sinvolvement with Indian traditions, yet it is also the most far-reaching, as thetexts that constituted the basis of legal decisions achieved a canonical power as religious rather than legal texts. This had a great deal to do with the consol-idation of patriarchal power over practices involving women, such as sati,prepubertal marriage, and conversion to other religions. Each of these had a sig-nificant role in the construction of Hinduism. If modern Hinduism’s practice istheoretically based on law, it is to that law that one must turn to examine howit was yoked to the interests of both colonizers and the indigenous elite, even asit showed the wide gap between them.Instead of rehearsing a linear chronology of the laws of India, we would dowell to begin with a pivotal act that reveals as much about what preceded it ashow it affected (or did not affect) the course of subsequent Indian legal history.The Caste Disabilities Removal Act was passed in 1850, and it was intended toprotect converts from disenfranchisement of their rights, including rights toproperty, maintenance, and guardianship. But its immediate precursor was theLex Loci Act, which was drafted in 1845 (as the name suggests) to constitute thelaw of the land, irrespective of individual differences between the various per-sonal, customary, and statutory laws of Hindus and Muslims. The preservation38gauri viswanathan"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"of these laws goes back to Warren Hastings’ Judicial Plan of 1772, which pro-vided for the application of different traditional laws for Hindus and Muslims –a decision that, Dieter Conrad argues, was instrumental in introducing a two-nation theory in India: “One has to date from that decision the establishment ofpersonal laws on the plane of state legality in India: laws administered by ordi-nary courts, yet applying not as the common law of the land on a territorial basis (lex loci) but on account of personal status by membership in a social groupdefined by its religion.” Conrad is careful to point out that this was not neces-sarily a “divide and rule” strategy, but that it was “largely a ratification of exist-ing practices” (Conrad 1995: 306). Even this last statement is only partiallycorrect, as these practices did not have a history that stretched back indefinitely.Indeed, many of them were no more basic to Indian society than the amalga-mation of Indian and English law that superseded them. The laws had been carefully developed through translations undertaken by prominent British Orientalist scholars, including William Jones, Nathaniel Halhed, Henry Cole-brooke, and William Grady. The application of laws derived from Sanskrit clas-sical texts leveled the community of Hindus to include all those who were notMuslims or Christians, and it absorbed under the category of “Hindu” both out-castes and members of religions as diverse as Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism,Judaism, and Zorastrianism. Only Islam was considered separate from Hinduism.Christianity suffered a more ambivalent fate. Though there were separate lawsfor Christians, these depended on what category of Christian one was. Britishresidents, of course, had their own laws; East Indians (Anglo-Indians) too weregoverned by English law; native Christians claimed English law, but court rulingswere inconsistent in this regard, at times deciding that they came under theadministration of Hindu law.9And finally, from a legal viewpoint, Christian con-verts were in the most liminal position. One of the paradoxical effects of Chris-tian conversions was a tendency in colonial courts to regard the conversions asnot having occurred at all, with the result that Christian converts were stillplaced as Hindus for purposes of law (Viswanathan 1998: 75–117).So much has been written about satı ̄in recent scholarship that it has come tostand for a pivotal moment in nineteenth-century reform legislation, as well asthe culmination of a crisis involving women’s subjectivity. Partly because of itssensationalism, and partly because of its romantic representation in both Indianand European texts, satı ̄has overshadowed (not always justifiably) other crucialissues involving women, such as education, early marriages, and the effects ofconversion. This is not the place to go into the vast literature on satı ̄, but severalobservations are in order for understanding why satı ̄has engaged scholarlyattention to the extent that it has, and how that attention is now focused on theemergence of Hinduism in its present form. Colonial discourse studies have illu-minated the connections between satı ̄and the colonial construction of Hin-duism in powerful ways. The work of Lata Mani emerges from this approach,though it has been taken to task for attributing too much power to colonialknowledge and not enough to other indigenous sources comprising both textualand oral traditions. Nonetheless, Mani’s work is a useful starting point for colonialism and the construction of hinduism39"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"analyzing the relations of Hinduism and colonial law. Mani’s principal argumentis that “tradition” is reconstituted under colonial rule and that woman and brah-manic scripture become “interlocking grounds for this rearticulation” (Mani1998: 90). Drawing from the colonial archive, she shows how women were theground for defining what constituted authentic cultural tradition. If there wasa privileging of brahmanic scripture, and tradition was equated with scripture,Mani suggests that this was the effect of the power of colonial discourse on India,which rewrote woman astradition. Less convincing is Mani’s explanation thatsuch representations were forged out of a colonial need for systematic gover-nance. It is more likely that colonial administrators were attempting to find acoherent point in Hindu law on which they could peg certain existing assump-tions in British culture about women, tradition, and the domestic sphere, thusachieving a manufactured version of Hinduism suitable for their own purposes.Considered the bane of Hindu society, child or prepubertal marriages werevehemently opposed by Christian missionaries, who objected on the grounds ofboth health and morality. Child brides were perceived to be so ill trained inhygiene and well-being that the children they gave birth to were believed to sufferfrom congenital disorders and not destined to live long. The later a womanmarried, the longer her children were expected to live. Even Hindu men couldnot find much to dispute in this argument. However, the issue of morality putthem fiercely on the defensive. The right to repudiate an early marriage, espe-cially when there was neither consummation nor formal cohabitation, threat-ened to destroy the idea of marriage as a sacrament, which none of the maleHindu reformers were willing to do. Nor were they keen to raise the age ofconsent for females. The infamous Rakhmabai case, involving a woman’s rightto repudiate a forced marriage, resulted in the woman being returned to herhusband. At stake was the sanctity of Hindu marriages: if the verdict had gonein the woman’s favor, marriage would been turned from a sacrament to a con-tract issue, which the Hindu elite resisted fiercely (Chandra 1998).Finally, colonial conversions reveal the reach of colonial law to fix religiousidentity, especially in the face of challenges by converts to subvert assigned iden-tities. That the British administration was involved at all was solely due to thefact that missionaries helped in bringing to court the cases of converts deniedcertain rights upon conversion. Subject to forfeiting their rights to property, con-jugality, guardianship and maintenance, converts from Hinduism suffered “civildeath,” a state of excommunication. Realizing that they could turn their failuresin the mission field to good account by becoming legal advocates, Christian mis-sionaries urged the colonial courts to protect the rights of converts on principlesdear to English political thought, the right to property being a key one. Of course,the missionaries were primarily interested in removing the obstacles against con-version, since the dreaded prospect of civil death made Hindus more reluctantto convert. But the British judicial decisions reveal a curious feature: while theyremained true to form by asserting the right to property by individuals, they didso by denying the subjectivity of converts. That is, the solution to protecting con-verts’ rights was by regarding them as still Hindu under the law. The rationale40gauri viswanathan"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"for this move was the belief that customs and usages (often deferred to in civilsuits as a last resort) were slower to change than beliefs. British judges resolvedthe dilemma of applying English liberal principle that might be offensive toHindu patriarchy by declaring that converts to Christianity could remain Hindusfor purposes of law, especially if their habits and manners remained essentiallyundifferentiated from so-called Hindu customs. The rationale for this solutionwas simple: If Christian converts were really Hindus, they could not be treatedas civilly dead and their civil rights could not justifiably be revoked under Hindulaw. The net result of such judicial rulings was the creation of a homogeneousHindu community, impervious to the discrepant articulations of individualmembers claiming fealty to other faiths.Notes1Richard G. Fox’s proposal that we distinguish Orientalism between two forms – affirmative and negative – fails to acknowledge that even affirmative Orientalism wasdeeply embedded in structures of domination. See Fox 1993: 152.2Many of the contributors, as well as the editors, ofRepresentating Hinduismempha-size Hinduism as a nineteenth-century construct, forged largely as a nationalistresponse to British colonialism. Of particular interest for this argument are the essaysby Friedhelm Hardy and Heinrich von Stietencron.3For instance, Gandhi maintained that though he had read The Bhagavad Gı ̄ta ̄in hisnative Gujarati, it was only when he read it in an English translation that he was ableto make the philosophical connections between such key concepts as dharma,satya ̄-graha, and ahim.sa ̄from which he was then able to develop an activist program of civilresistance (Gandhi 1957: 67–8).4It is equally important to note, as Amartya Sen does, that Sanskrit literature has along history of heterodoxy, yet this tradition of writing does not get as much atten-tion in Western discourses as does a representative “Hindu” text like The BhagavadGı ̄ta ̄. Sen observes that “Sanskrit and Pali have a larger atheistic and agnostic litera-ture than exists in any other classical tradition.. . . Through selective emphases thatpoint up differences with the West, other civilizations can, in this way, be redefinedin alien terms, which can be exotic and charming, or else bizarre and terrifying, orsimply strange and engaging. When identity is thus defined by contrast, divergencewith the West becomes central” (Sen 2000: 36).5I use the phrase “pre-Muslim India” with some reservations, even though it is partof von Stietencron’s description. As Romila Thapar among other scholars has arguedin numerous writings, dividing India into “Hindu India,” “Muslim India,” “BritishIndia” is too neat a formula, since it reintroduces James Mill’s language (as presentin his History of British India) of considering Indian history within this tripartite divi-sion. Such a historiography, Thapar argues, has been instrumental in fueling the pas-sions of Hindu nationalists to recover a Hinduism compromised or threatened byIslamic conversions and the destruction of Hindu temples.6Von Stietencron observes that Hinduism in pre-Muslim India did not have all-Indiareligious bodies invested with the power to authorize official religious interpretations,and hence heterodox readings could not be banned entirely (von Stietencron 1989:71).colonialism and the construction of hinduism41"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"7James Nelson, A View of the Hindu Law as Administered by the High Court of Judicatureat Madras(1877). Nelson noted that the usages and customs of inhabitants of hisdistrict in Madurai were altogether different from the practices associated withHindus and that were “judicially recognized” by the High Court of Judicature atMadras. He concluded from this observation that, far from being Hindu in faith andthought, Tamil people “believe, think, and act in modes entirely opposed to andincompatible with real, modern Hinduism” (p. ii). Lashing out at the “grotesqueabsurdity” of applying the strictest Sanskrit law to tribals, Nelson argued that nosuch thing as Hindu law ever existed. The artifact of Sanskritists, Hindu law cameinto being as a result of the ignorance of the actual history and circumstances of thevast majority of social groups in India, maintained Nelson, one of the few voices inthe British judicial administration who dared to take this position.8Macaulay’s infamous “Minute on Indian Education” is partly inspired by his outrageat the British government’s subsidies to indigenous schools, which taught what hedescribed as wildly extravagant fairy tales masquerading as religious truth. His pleafor the study of English literature was the culmination of a long argument that orig-inated in an Orientalist policy encouraging indigenous learning. See “Minute onIndian Education,” in G. M. Young, ed., Macaulay: Prose and Poetry(Cambridge, MA:Harvard University Press, 1957).9Abraham v. Abraham was one of the most prominent cases involving East Indians. Inthis case a widow of a native Indian Christian contested her brother-in-law’s claimthat, as native Christians who were formerly Hindus, even several generations ago,Hindu law was applicable in cases of joint property and coparcenerships. The widowprotested that as Christians they were governed by English law. The ruling went inthe brother-in-law’s favor.ReferencesAsad, Talal. 1993.

Amid the ruins, the boat rounds a bend in the river todiscover a motley array of native soldiers, accompanied by a profusion ofhanging corpses. The lost colonel Kurtz – like Conrad’s Kurtz – has gone madand is killing wildly deep in the jungle. He, then, is horrifying to those who aresearching for him. But Kurtz has a little shelf of books in his womb-like centerof the temple complex, where a statue of the Buddha sits beside him, a shelf thatbears the Golden Boughand Jessie Weston’s The Quest for the Holy Grail. The madcolonel, once an “outstanding officer,” is not only waging a private war, but isalso a solitary student of Religious Studies.

Perhaps the most startling contrastbetween the film and Conrad’s novel is between the massive fire power of theAmericans and the impotence of the French gunboat blindly shelling the jungleshoreline – but the Americans were no less impotent in the end.

Once the study of “oriental”or near eastern and Asian languages and literatures, orientalism is now takento mean the western domination and exploitation of the east, the west viewingthe east as alien, as “the other.” All study of Hinduism in the west is taken to bean instance of Orientalism in the new sense. It was the literary critic Said, aPalestinian Christian, who brought about this revolution. His first book a studyof Joseph Conrad, in OrientalismSaid introduced and popularized the ideas ofFoucault. Although partly inspired by Raymond Schwab’s La RenaissanceOrientale(1950), which makes India the centerpiece of an expected culturalrebirth of Europe through the study of the Orient, Sanskrit performing the roleof Greek in the first Renaissance, Said is principally concerned with the Arabworld and its treatment by the west. European novels remain his primary areaof expertise, and not for a moment does he take on-board Schwab’s thesis that the East has influenced the West. Said makes use of Foucault’s notion ofdiscourse, of a manner of thinking that is adopted willy-nilly by a generation ormore of writers, while at the same time having as his preferred procedure the literary analysis of individual works of literature. The two methods sit ill together: “Said denounces with Foucaultian vitriol what he loves withAuerbachian passion” (Ahmad 1992: 168). Nevertheless, following Foucault,Said suggests that the effect of Orientalist discourse is “to formulate the Orient,to give it shape, identity, definition with full recognition of its place in memory,its importance to imperial strategy, and its ‘natural’ role as an appendage toEurope” (Said 1978: 86).A significant and malign maneuver on Said’s part is to extend the termOrientalist from students of Oriental languages to all those who deal with theOrient, whether or not they use texts in the original languages. His final optionfor the meaning of Orientalism of course turns it on its head; as taken up by thesociologist Bryan Turner, Orientalism means ignorance of the Orient: “From theseventeenth century onwards, orientalism had constituted a profound sense ofotherness with respect to alien cultures”(Turner 1994: 183). This perversesleight-of-hand magics away into thin air the editions, translations, anddictionaries of the true and original Orientalists who devoted their lives tounderstanding the meaning of instances of Oriental culture and civilization. In the words of Gyan Prakash, “The towering...images ofmen like William(‘Oriental’) Jones have cracked and come tumbling down” (Prakash 1995: 200).So well established is Said that Joan-Pau Rubies, a young scholar, recentlywrote that “ ‘Orientalism’ has traditionally been defined as a western imperial-ist attitude in which the colonized subjects are perceived according to purelywestern ideological concerns” (Rubies 2002: 287). Said’s brilliant success hasswept away all that preceded it, and his redefinition of Orientalism has become“traditional”! The choice of the term Orientalism is unfortunate on severalcounts. In the first place, why limit it to the west? As Rubies remarks, “If wedefine orientalism as a manipulative historical gaze based on a crude separationbetween us and other, and which denies the representation of this otheranyintrinsic voice, then there was very little in the Muslim discourse about Hindu46david smith"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"India which was less orientalist than what contemporary Europeans perceivedand wrote” (Rubies 2002: 286). Then again, within Hinduism, Brahmans mightbe said to have an Orientalist attitude to the lower castes. Original Orientalismwas precisely the attempt to understand the Oriental Other. This attempt was not completely successful, but it was all the attempt at understanding there was.Orientalism can be faulted for undue concentration on classical texts, but thiswas only mirroring the crucial role of study of ancient Greek and Latin, theAncients, in the intellectual life of the west.First and foremost a literary critic, turning again and again in his Orientalismto the modern European novel as his favorite medium and source, Said sweep-ingly dismisses Orientalists in the strict sense in exactly the same way as he saysthat the west dismisses the east, as inferior others. Said has not altogetherunfairly been dismissed as “a literary critic rummaging through history to findscraps of evidence to support his personal and political purposes” (Kopf 1991:21) by Kopf, author of a pioneering historical study of British Orientalism inIndia (Kopf 1969).Said’s work is continued with reference to India by the anthropologist turnedhistorian-Sanskritist, Ronald Inden, in his Imagining India (1992), a book whosesuccess has been scarcely less than that of Said’s. Indeed, its intellectual basis isperhaps stronger than that ofOrientalism; Inden’s thesis is that Orientalists havedeprived Indians of “agency” “by imagining an India kept eternally ancient byvarious Essences attributed to it, most notably that of caste.” Inden contendsthat Indologists present the texts they study as “distorted portrayals of reality,”as “manifestations of an ‘alien’ mentality” (1992: 1, 39).Early in the book he gives as an example of some remarks on Vedic ritual byLouis Renou (1896–1966), the great French Sanskritist. These remarks aretaken from Renou’s masterly survey of the main problems in the study of Indianreligion, as he saw them in 1950. Renou says in the quoted passage that Vedicritual is overburdened with system, that there was “an advancing scholasticism”(1992: 39). Two paragraphs later in Renou’s text, the following sentences arequoted by Inden: “Ritual has a strong attraction for the Indian mind, whichtends to see everything in terms of the formulae and methods of procedure, evenwhen such adjuncts no longer seem really necessary for its religious experience”(1992: 39). Inden believes that this is to transform “the thoughts and actions ofancient Indians into a distortion of reality.” Renou might have shown that theVedic priests “were part of a coherent and rational whole” based on different pre-suppositions than his own; but Renou, like many Indologists, holds that there isa single external reality to which Western science has privileged access. Implicitin the text of Renou and other Indologists, is the “metaphor of the Other as adreamer, as a. . . mad man.” Like Freud on dreams, Indologists attribute con-densation and displacement to the Indian mind. For Renou, says Inden, “thepriestly mind takes up rituals which are not meant to be enacted while thepriestly hand performs rituals that have no religious rationale.” “Renou, we haveseen [!], attributed the same dreaming irrationality to the Indian mind that Hegeldid” (1992: 42).orientalism and hinduism47"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Inden’s polemic leads him to distort Renou’s statements. When Renou speaksof the Indian mind, he means the Indian mind as expressed in Vedic texts, a con-tinuous and highly specific tradition to which certain general characteristicsmight fairly be attributed. Renou goes on to say that there is a tendency in theritual texts to build up complex structures from simpler elements, that they aresometimes intellectual exercises – “we must not regard them as consistingentirely of accounts of actual religious practice” (Renou 1968: 30). Renou’saccount of Vedism to my mind is sympathetic and luminous. As Renou says, “Ofreligious feeling and community life in the Vedic period we can know virtuallynothing” (Renou 1968: 44). But he gives us a description of a present-day per-formance of a Vedic sacrifice, ending with the following comment on ancienttimes: “In those distant days India had a feeling for liturgy comparable to thatof the Roman Church” (Renou 1968: 35). We might also note Renou’s remarkthat “the prose-style of the S ́atapatha [the largest of the sacrificial texts] is amodel of skilful articulation, and in its severe purity reminds us of Plato” (Renou1968: 45). In another essay on Vedic studies Renou notes that “Indian scholarshave come relatively late to these studies. It may be that an excess of attachment(very respectable in itself) to the tradition has prevented them from consideringthe Veda with eyes sufficiently objective, with the same ‘indifference’ with whicha naturalist studies a plant” (Renou 1950: 46).1Not only did Renou devote his life to the objective study of Sanskrit and theVeda, more than most Sanskritists he took the large view, giving an accurateaccount of the whole scope of classical Indian civilization in the two volumes ofL’Inde Classiquewhich he edited with Jean Filliozat, writing much of it himself.To say that Renou attributed “dreaming irrationality” to the Indian mind is false.As his pupil Malamoud wrote in the preface to a posthumous collection ofRenou’s essays, L’Inde Fondamentale, Renou described an India that was rigorousand cheerful, animated by a powerful ardor for speculation, directed to the intre-pid analysis of language rather than to rumination on the ineffable (Malamoud1978: 1).Renou had no conceivable imperial designs on India. Nor did Georg Bühler(1837–98), the Sanskritist’s Sanskritist of the second half of the nineteenthcentury, who worked for the Raj’s Bombay Presidency. This Austrian scholar hadthe reputation of having read everything extant in Sanskrit; and conceived andedited the Encyclopedia of Indo-Aryan Research, contributed to by Indologists fromall over the world. Renou and Bühler are prime examples of the mastery soughtby all scholars, the lordship of understanding that is as complete as possible.British Orientalists had the same ambitions, of understanding through firsthandknowledge. Mill and Hegel, on the other hand, claimed universal dominion fortheir ideas without any firsthand knowledge of India or Indian languages – thisis the difference between scholars and philosophers.On the other hand, it is certainly true that the understanding of manySanskritists was limited to their particular texts, and that some had little or nosympathy for modern India. Thus for Garbe, who visited India in 1885/6, theworship of the common Hindu was a worthless fetishism, and he confessed to48david smith"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"the anger of a Hebrew prophet, wanting to whip the Hindus, especially thepriests, from the stinking lairs that were their temples (Garbe 1925: 56). But itbehooves us to remember how far away India was from the west before airplanes– both Garbe and Deussen give a careful account of the ships in which theyvoyage to India. Very little was known about how Hindus lived and thought.There is nothing to be gained by reduplicating Garbe’s moral indignation andheaping it back on him, for he lived on a different planet; and he had a very goodunderstanding of Samkhyan and other texts.Said’s reversal of the meaning of the word Orientalism has been so success-ful because there was a need for a word for western misunderstanding and mis-treatment of the East, but his choice was unfortunate. No one has offered anyevidence that Indological Orientalist learning, in the strict old sense of linguis-tic and textual study, served imperial ends. Those concerned with conquest andexploitation, with practical affairs, had no time and little sympathy for suchstudies.2Warren Hastings was the exception here, but he had a great love of allthings Indian. It was he who set Orientalism – in its old and original meaning –in train in India. He found Hinduism scarcely less attractive than Christianity.3He spoke of himself as well as others when he told the man he was sending toexplore Tibet, “there were ‘thousands of men in England’ who would listen tothe story of an expedition ‘in search of knowledge’, with ‘ten times’ the interestthey would take in ‘victories that slaughtered thousands of the nationalenemies’ ” (Feiling 1996: 105). Nor does colonial discourse theory makeallowance for the kind of love of learning that led Anquetil-Duperron to enlistas a soldier so that he could get to India and study Old Persian and Sanskrit(Anquetil-Duperron [1771] 1997: 75–7). Indeed, Said speaks of “the madnessof Anquetil-Duperron’s life” (Said 1984: 252).Not only does Inden without a shred of justification accuse Renou of attribut-ing “the same dreaming irrationality to the Indian mind that Hegel did,” hemakes the astonishing claim that the writings of James Mill (The History ofBritish India) and Hegel were hegemonic texts for Indology (Inden 1992: 4). As Trautman says, “neither Mill nor Hegel learned an Indian language or set footin India” and “they used their secondhand knowledge to fashion argumentsagainstthe authority of the Orientalists and the enthusiasm for India with whichit was associated” (Trautman 1997: 23). Numerous writers today claim thatMill was studied at Haileybury, the East India Company’s college in England, buta rare published account of life there makes no mention of the History of BritishIndia. John Beames, an Indian civil servant whose love of learning led him towrite a Comparative Grammar of Indo-Aryan languages, describes his time atHaileybury learning languages, but nothing whatever about life in India, noteven what Mill has to say.[I]t was considered “bad form” to talk about India or to allude to the fact that wewere all going there soon. Even the study of Oriental languages, which was thechief feature of the place, and in fact the reason for its existence, was carried onas though we had no personal interest in the countries in which those languagesorientalism and hinduism49"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"were spoken, and no attempt was made to practise talking them or to acquire anypractical familiarity with them. If at any time one wanted to know what sort ofplace India was, or what one’s future life or work there was to be like, it was impos-sible to find anyone who could give the requisite information. (Beames 1996: 64)The indifference to India on the part of Beames and his fellow students seems tobe innocent of any knowledge of the Historyof James Mill.Oriental DespotismCoppola transposes the Horror from the African jungle with its cannibals andfences topped with skulls to the jungle of Cambodia, where the giant heads ofthe divine kings of Angkor loom out of the vegetation. Angkor, “The City,” fromthe Sanskrit nagara (“city”), was on the eastern edge of the huge spread ofSanskritic culture. Sanskrit was “the paramount linguistic medium by whichruling elites expressed their power from Purusapura (Peshawar) in Gandhara inthe northwest of the subcontinent to as far east as Panduranga in Annam (southVietnam) and Prambanam in central Java” (Pollock 1996: 198). In describingthe formation of what he calls the Sanskrit Cosmopolis, Pollock refers to the“efforts of small groups of traders, adventurers, religious professionals. There isno evidence that large-scale state initiatives were ever at issue, or that anythingremotely resembling ‘colonization’ took place” (Pollock 1996: 241).Yet, however Sanskritic religious culture spread to southeast Asia, the hugetemple-palaces in Cambodia are patent manifestation of royalty’s will to power.An important early instance of Said’s version of Orientalism is the Europeannotion of Oriental Despotism, a category that allows the west to dismiss easternpolitical concerns as inherently inferior. The notion goes back to Aristotle:“Asians are more servile by nature. . . hence they endure despotic rule withoutprotest” (Aristotle, PoliticsIII, ix, 3 cited in Anderson 1974: 463). FrancoisBernier (1620–88), philosopheand traveler, is here a key figure, for his accountof the despotism of the Mughals was taken up by Montesquieu and Marx, toname only two. In fact, as Murr suggests, Bernier’s account of India underAurangzib and his predecessors reflects his fear that the absolutism of Louis XIVmight degenerate into tyranny. He studiously resists using the term despot, andpresents Aurangzib as by no means a barbarian, but as a great king worthy ofcomparison with European kings (Murr 1991). The Mughal emperors differedfrom European kings in that the most powerful son rather than the first-bornbecame the successor; and in parallel with this lack of regularly rewardedprimogeniture there was no landed aristocracy as independent counterweightto the sovereign, since nobles were salaried and liable to dismissal if theirperformance was not satisfactory. Oriental Despotism becomes a key concept inpro-imperialist interpretations of ancient Indian politics and society. Anquetil-Duperron was the first European to argue against the notion that there was no50david smith"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"ownership of land in India, though his motive was primarily antipathy to theBritish. It is interesting to note a lack of such anti-British animus in the mostimportant Enlightenment work on colonialism, Raynal’s Philosophical andPolitical History of the Two Indies (first published 1760), no less a contributoryfactor to the French Revolution than Rousseau, now scarcely known. For RaynalEngland is one among four powers in contemporary south India, no more out ofplace than the Marathas, Tipu Sultan, and the Nizam of Hyderbad (Raynal1820, vol 3: 187). All four powers were conquering outside their own territo-ries. But the notion of Oriental Despotism is an instance where Said’s critique isfully justified. So too the notion of the unchanging Indian village, dealt with byInden. But in these, and many other cases, the mistaken interpretation arisesfrom ignorance, from lack of sources of information.Orientalism and EmpireToday the British Empire is widely seen as a blot on the history of the world.Assessment of British rule in India is difficult. Postcolonialism has produced avast amount of literary criticism predicated on the cruelty and injustice of theRaj; Vinay Lal declares that getting to grips with the products of this industryleaves no time for old-fashioned history – even “the quest for objectivity” inassessing the British Empire is “morally dubious.” A balanced judgment relevantin the present context is that of Nirad C. Chaudhuri, even if Lal dismisses him as “an indefatigable Anglophile” (Lal 1997: 100). Describing the 1920s,Chaudhuri’s empathy with Englishness – though he disliked the few Englishmenhe met while under the Raj – does come out in his not unfavorable summary of early British imperialism as “a mixture of humanitarianism, Evangelism,Utilitarianism, and Liberalism.” But Chaudhuri continues:That old imperialism had been replaced by the end of the nineteenth century by awholly shoddy theory, which was nothing better than boastful verbiage. By 1920,even that had been discredited, and the Empire in India survived only as a practical reality supported by vested interests. (Chaudhuri 1988: 775)Tapan Raychaudhuri in his important assessment of British rule in Indiaremarks that “In post-independence India, serious thinkers and historians whosee anything good in the imperial record can probably be counted on the fingersof one hand” (Raychaudhuri 1996: 358); nor is he one of their number.There can be no doubt that the British, with a few exceptions, had nosympathy for Indian culture or religion, least of all sympathy for Hindus andHinduism. But that is all the more reason to give due allowance to the excep-tions. Kejariwal shows commendable boldness in blaming Indian nationalismfor not giving credit to the early British Orientalists: “Indian historians were more than eager to accept the glory of India’s past as revealed by Britishorientalism and hinduism51"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"historians, but the historians themselves were rejected as biased and motivated”(Kejariwal 1988: 233).The British Empire should not be considered in isolation from other empires.Not only is the British Raj to be set beside the Turkish, Persian, Roman, and otherEmpires, we must also note Chaudhuri’s assertion of Hindu imperialism:I had better confess that all Hindus are traditionally imperialists, and they con-demned imperialism only in so far as British imperialism made them subjects to anempire instead of its masters. This is due to the fact that the strongest politicalpassion of the ancient Hindus was directed towards conquest and domination. AllSanskrit literature and all the historical inscriptions are full of glorification of both.This aspiration to conquer and dominate was suppressed during Muslim andBritish rule, but today, even if not given practical expression, it conditions theattitude of the present Hindu ruling class towards the neighbours of India.(Chaudhuri 1988: 774)Har Bilas Sarda’s Hindu Superiority(1906) invents an account of Hindu colo-nization of the world (Jaffrelot 1997: 331). R. C. Majumdar’s history of India,widely used in schools and colleges in India, sees the spread of Hinduism andBuddhism in southeast Asia as the result of colonization by the Indian masterrace. Pollock claims that the source of such thinking is European (Pollock 1996:233). True, but the goal of the traditional Hindu king was universal empire.Pollock concedes that domination did not enter India with European colonialismand that “gross asymmetries of power...appear to have characterized India inparticular times and places over the last three millennia and have formed thebackground against which ideological power, intellectual and spiritual resis-tance, and many forms of physical and psychological violence crystallized”(Pollock 1993: 115) “Sanskrit was the principal discursive instrument of domi-nation in premodern India and. . . it has been continuously reappropriated inmodern India by many of the most reactionary and communalist sectors of thepopulation” (Pollock 1993: 116). Inden’s Imagining Indiaseeks to refute the“Orientalist” account (in Said’s sense) of India which Inden says deprives Hindusof agency by defining Hinduism in terms of essence, caste, and spirituality. Yethis refutation of the supposed colonialism and imperialism of his predecessors inthe field of Indology proceeds by setting against them the medieval imperialismof Hinduism – universal empire was always the theoretical goal of Hindu kings.Orientalism and Racial TheoriesVarious views on the origin and types of mankind were current in seventeenth-century Europe, including the theory of Pre-adamite man, but “racial theoryhas as its official birthdate 24 April 1664” (Toth 1988: 23), when Bernierpublished in the Journal des Scavansa new division of the earth according to thedifferent races that occupy it. He did not sign his paper because of intense52david smith"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"theological opposition to the theory of Pre-adamite man published by his friendLa Peyrère nine years earlier. Bernier’s conception was biological and based onheredity. Bernier distinguishes four or five “species”; we need only note that heconsidered Europeans and a good part of Asia (including the States of the GreatMogol, the Kingdom of Golconda, and that of Bijapur) to be of the same race.He made no other mention of India. Amongst the peoples with whom he is wellacquainted, Bernier makes no hierarchical distinction.The worst and most dangerous aspect of the British empire was its racism. AsVeer notes, “Racial difference between the British and the colonized and amongthe colonized themselves became the explanation and legitimation of colonialrule” (Veer 2001: 49). The British thought that they proved their superiority toIndians by conquering and holding India with a remarkably small number ofmen. They achieved this by convincing themselves of their invincibility and per-suading many Indians that they were inferior to the British in respect of abilityto rule and wage war; though bribery was often more useful than bravery. Thematchless self-confidence of the British produced the inverse effect on those whobeheld it. The British rulers kidded themselves and kidded the Indians, but itmight well be argued that the confidence trick took its inspiration from India,from the caste system. It was Brahmans who did the trick first, claiming to bethe mouth of God, Gods among men, the twice born. The British civil servantstook over for themselves the very term “twice born.” Brahmans did not eat withnon-Brahmans; the British rulers would not eat, drink, or mix with Indians. TheBrahmans were essentially different from the other castes, for all castes wereessentially different from each other. Well and good, the British rulers would beessentially different from the Indians, just as they were from their own lowerclasses back in England.The British caste maintained its mindset all the better by having nothing todo with Hinduism. Their rejigging of the Hindu legal system and their censusessharpened up notions of caste, but they hid from themselves the caste nature ofthe imagined essential inner power that enabled them to rule successfully, andthey hid this from themselves by having as little as possible to do with Hinduism.In some sense it was their ignorance of Hinduism that enabled the British to rulefor so long. When Nietzsche’s friend, Paul Deussen, the German Vedanta scholar,traveling by train in India in 1893 rejoiced in friendly relations with Hindus, thecold and unfriendly Englishman in the same compartment remarked, “We haveto rule these people” (Deussen [1904] 1995).Many of the statistics of British imperial presence in India are striking, as forinstance that “In one district of Lower Bengal, 20 Britons lived among 2.5million natives. As late as 1939, about 28 million Punjabis – people notrenowned for their docility – were governed by 60 British civil servants.”However, the size of the army – “65,000 white soldiers in an area populated by300 million people that now includes not only India but Pakistan, Bangladesh,and Burma” (Gilmour 1997: 35) – was not puny, given modern weapons andtransport. For the civil and military officer cadres English public schools pro-duced “a courage caste with its ambitions turned from gain or learning towardsorientalism and hinduism53"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"an ideal of rule” (Geddes 1962: 95). The British civil servant, incredible as itseems now, believed that he was infallible and invulnerable in dealing withIndians. The army was there in the background, but many Indians had neverseen British soldiers. As Walter Lawrence put it in the 1920s, British power inIndia was based on “mutual make-believe”: “They, the millions, made us believewe had a divine mission. We made them believe that they were right” (Lawrence1928: 42–3). It rested on mutual collusion, on illusion.But this dominance came to be explained by race. Risley (1851–1911),Commissioner for the 1901 Census of India, tried to show that caste had itsorigins in the interactions of the Aryan and Dravidian races: the caste systemhad its basis in community of race rather than community of function. He takesas starting point in his People of India(1915) a carved panel from the Buddhiststupa at Sanchi (100 bcto 100ad) which shows a monkey offering honey to theBuddha.4Tutelary spirits, yaks.as, look on. The Buddha was not shown in personin this early phase of Buddhist art – his presence is signified by the empty daisbeneath a sala tree. Risley bizarrely misreads this compassionate representationof spiritual community as an “expression of the race sentiment of the Aryanstowards the Dravidians,” showing us “the higher race on friendly terms with thelower, but keenly conscious of the essential difference of type and taking noactive part in the ceremony at which they appear as sympathetic but patroniz-ing spectators” (Risley 1915: 5). Through ignorance of the basic conventions ofBuddhist art, Risley sees only a primitive ritual devoid of point carried out by asubhuman no better than a monkey. He sees the demi-god yaks.as as Aryans, andthe monkey as a Dravidian!In trying to understand caste as race, imperial officials were not setting Indiaaside as a separate ethnographic park, as the Other that is the unavoidable tropeof colonial discourse analysis. Such racial analysis was to be applied everywhere.As Susan Bayly has pointed out, their work for them was pathbreaking science(S. Bayly 1997: 167). It was neither oldstyle Orientalism nor new Orientalism.It was for them an application and instance of universal reason, even thoughtoday it seems false and absurd.Cannadine argues that the British Empire was not really concerned with thecreation of “otherness”: society on the imperial periphery was the same or evensuperior to society in the imperial metropolis; “for the British, their overseasrealms were at least as much about sameness as they were about difference”(Cannadine 2001: 4). British colonialism exacerbated caste, made it a system,but British interest in caste was by no means merely knowledge as power overits object, for it arose from a sense of similarity, of fellow feeling. For manyBritons, says Cannadine, “the social arrangements in South Asia seemed easilyrecognizable and comfortingly familiar” (2001: 16). The rigid hierarchy of theBritish in British India has often been remarked on. “British India was as muchinfected by caste as Indian India” (Mason 1978: 80).Cannadine’s revisionism, salutary as it is, must not prevent us from examin-ing the role of racial theory in understanding western and eastern confron-tation. The supposition of racial characteristics and stereotypes, beyond the54david smith"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"natural tendency of all peoples to believe themselves and their ways the best, hasone supremely bad quality. This is ranking, forming a hierarchy, asserting supe-riority and inferiority. Without going into the question of what is race and whatis caste, the clearest model of such ranking of peoples is the caste system, wherebirth determines value and status. It is striking how the notion of caste comesto permeate English discourse in the nineteenth century, to the point that Marx,for example, worries about his daughters losing caste through not being able toreturn hospitality (letter to Engels 1867 in Wheen 2000: 298). Doubtless thenotion of caste resonated with aspects of the class system in Britain, but theimplacable and powerful presence of caste in India, it may be argued, had a pro-found effect on the British. This effect was much greater once Muslim power wascrushed, and the British had ever more consequential dealings with Hindus,whose quite different patterns of hospitality became increasingly significant. Itis surely likely that British exclusivity mirrored the pre-existing caste exclusivityof the Brahmans. Cannadine finds similarity between British and Indian society,but the radical change from Georgian to Victorian society marches in parallelwith the British discovery of caste. The separation of human levels in theVictorian country house, for instance, where “it was considered undesirable forchildren, servants and parents to see, smell or hear each other except at certain recognized times and places” (Girouard 1979: 28) parallels the newlydiscovered social distinctions of the caste system in India.A term used tirelessly from the appearance ofOrientalismis “the Other.” Itsorigins go back to Hegel, and Jacques Lacan made much of it. In the context ofthe Orient, it has been grossly overworked. MacKenzie makes the importantpoint that in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries Britain’s principal“other” was France; and in the century and a half that followed, France, Russia,Germany and the Soviet Union (MacKenzie 1994: 16). Risley’s misinterpreta-tion of the monkey in the Sanchi sculpture referred to above is perhaps lessobnoxious when we remember the story that during the Napoleonic warsHartlepool fishermen hanged a shipwrecked monkey because they took it for aFrenchman. The rudimentary logic of self and other has today led to an exag-gerated idea of the importance of the East for nineteenth-century Europe. Baylypoints out that “Indological debates were almost always occidental debates aswell; Orientalism was as much a representation of the Contested Self as it wasof the Other.” Many of the offensive characterizations of Hindus made byEnglishmen “are indistinguishable from what contemporaries were saying aboutthose addicted to the Demon Drink, the working class, the Irish, RomanCatholics in general, or indeed about women” (C. A. Bayly 1990: 1313).Orientalism and the FemaleIt is fascinating to note how the contemporary decline of philology, of the studyof foreign literatures in their original languages, has been accompanied by theorientalism and hinduism55"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"use of philological terms such as grammar, syntax, and poetics in sociologicaldiscourse. Vinay Lal declares that “the trope of effeminacy, the first element ofan Orientalist grammar of India, had a particular place in colonial discourse.”Lal refers to Robert Orme’s essay on “The Effeminacy of the Inhabitants ofHindustan” (1782), summed up in the confident assertion that “very few of theinhabitants” of India were “endowed with the nervous strength, or athletic size,of the robustest nations of Europe” (Lal 1996).Most frequently cited on this subject are Macaulay’s words:The physical organisation of the Bengalee is feeble even to effeminacy. He lives ina constant vapour bath. His pursuits are sedentary, his limbs delicate, his move-ments languid. During many ages he has been trampled upon by men of bolderand more hardy breeds. Courage, independence, veracity, are qualities to which hisconstitution and his situation are equally unfavourable. (Macaulay [1841] 1895:611)Few bother with the context, his characterization of Warren Hastings’ implac-able foe, the Maharajah Nand Kumar, whose composure and serenity in deathMacaulay honors. Nand Kumar “prepared himself to die with that quiet forti-tude with which the Bengalee, so effeminately timid in personal conflict, oftenencounters calamities for which there is no remedy.” Of the Bengali in generalMacaulay adds,Nor does he lack a certain kind of courage which is often wanting to his masters.To inevitable evils he is sometimes found to oppose a passive fortitude, such as theStoics attributed to their ideal sage.This is not slight praise from a devoted classicist. But otherwise Macaulay was merely expressing with his incomparable trenchancy the general view ofEuropean travelers. For instance, Bernier’s compatriot, the jewel merchantTavernier, noting that for one Muslim there are five or six Hindus, finds it aston-ishing “to see how this enormous multitude of men has allowed itself to besubjected by so small a number, and has readily submitted to the yoke of theMusalman Princes,” but “the Idolators were effeminate people unable to makemuch resistance.” Tavernier finds further explanation for their defeat in theirsuperstition which “has introduced so strange a diversity of opinions andcustoms that they never agree with one another.” He also notes that the secondcaste is that of warriors and soliders: “These are the only idolators who arebrave, and distinguish themselves in the profession of arms” (Tavernier [1676]1925, vol. 2: 141, 137).Insofar as there was caste specialization, it is perhaps only reasonable thatthere should be specialization in bravery. McClintock claims that “imperialismcannot be understood without a theory of gender power...gender dynamicswere, from the outset, fundamental to the securing and maintenance of theimperial enterprise” (McClintock 1995: 6–7).

Kanhayalal Gauba’s 1930 study of native princes refers to Bismarck’sdistinction of male and female European nations. For Bismarck, the Germansand various other peoples including the English and the Turks were essentiallymale; all Slavonic and Celtic peoples were “female races”. Female races werecharming but inefficient. Bismarck’s view is relevant here in that it shows thatthe sweeping attribution of femininity to males is not necessarily tied in withprejudices of conquest and colonization. Gauba, not resenting the Raj, creditedBritish India with the “virility of youth,” and saw in the India ruled by princes“all the attractiveness of fine clothes, fine living, love and the extravagance asso-ciated with the elegant and sensuous female” (Gauba 1930: 13). If one acceptedGauba’s analysis, one could well argue that the India of the Princes as hedescribes it represents a higher level of civilization. Of course, all such talk isreally about style and presentation rather than substance.The British after the Mutiny/War of Independence revised their view of whatthey saw as the regional differentions between Indians, and General Roberts pro-mulgated a doctrine of martial races. In this doctrine the general problem of thepossible unmanning of conquered peoples took on for many Indians, especiallyBengalis, a particularly insulting tone. The hypermasculine colonialist claimedto find Indians relatively effeminate. There are many complex issues here, includ-ing a degree of homoeroticism in the English public school and in the relation-ship between British officers and Indian troops, but my concern is to show thatthis attribution of effeminacy to Hinduism was absent from the work of Orien-talists. By and large the British had remarkably little understanding of Hindusand Hinduism. What is at issue is the attitude of those Britons and Europeanswho were deeply interested in India and Hinduism, Orientalists in the pre-Saidian sense.In his chapter on Hinduism in Imagining India, Inden tries to show that thewest’s understanding of Hinduism opposed its own claimed masculine reason tothe imputed feminine imagination of India. Inden begins by quoting Spear’slikening of Hinduism to a sponge because it absorbs all that enters it. Implicithere, says Inden, is the idea that Hinduism is “a female presence who is able,through her very amorphousness and absorptive powers, to baffle and perhapseven threaten Western rationality.” He then quotes Sir Charles Eliot – “Hinduismhas often and justly been compared to a jungle” (Inden 1992: 86). Inden quotesseveral other sentences from Eliot expanding on this, ending, “The averageHindu who cannot live permanently in the altitudes of pantheistic thought,regards his gods as great natural forces akin to mighty rivers which he also wor-ships, irresistible and often beneficent but also capricious and destructive.” Indenimmediately comments, “There is thus little doubt here that this jungle with itssoul, is, like Spear’s sponge, also a female, one that can be managed by its malemasters and known so long as they don’t become entwined in its embraces”(1992: 87). Neither Spear nor Eliot said a word about femininity, nor about man-aging the forest, though Eliot spoke of Brahmans as “not gardeners but forestofficers”. Inden unfairly finds a colonial implication in the Brahmans being seenas this way, but Eliot’s point is that Hinduism cannot be controlled like a garden.orientalism and hinduism57"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Far from the jungle of Hinduism being seen as feminine, Eliot in the passage citedby Inden explicitly says that “men and women of all classes. . . and all stages ofcivilization have contributed to it.”A page later Inden again says that for Western writers, “If Hinduism has apositive essence, it consists of its feminine imaginativeness, its ability to absorband include, to move from one extreme to the other, and to tolerate inconsis-tencies” (1992: 88). Again, the femininity is entirely his own addition. It is alsointeresting that in the final part of his book, an account of what he calls “theimperial formation” in medieval India, Inden happily refers to the traditionalidiom wherein the conquered peoples of the universal emperor, the king ofkings, are referred to as his wives (1992: 234).In Inden’s next section on Hinduism, “Psychic Origins,” we get a long dis-cussion of Mill’s History of British India(1858), followed by Hegel’s India as thesleeper dreaming before he awakes. “What were more or less disconnected exam-ples of Hindu irrationality and superstition for Mill, the empiricist, were, for theGerman idealists, including Hegel, instances of the core metaphysics of thatreligion, of its double displacement of the ideal and material, the subjective andobjective and of the predominance in it of creative imagination or fantasy overtrue thought or reason. That becomes the positive inner essence of the femaleIndia that a masculine Europe with its inner essence of reason was coming to dominate.”...“We would not have those later British depictions of India as a feminine sponge or jungle animated by a feminine imagination had theRomantics and Hegel not done their work” (1992: 96).“When we turn to the historical narratives of this religion, we behold a degen-erative psychohistory masterminded by Hegel,” says Inden. “Instead of witness-ing the triumph of man, reason, and spirit, however, we see the triumph of theeffeminate, the sensuous and the parochial . . .” (1992: 129). But no one saysthis; certainly no one whom Inden cites. Hinduism is indeed a sponge, is a forest,precisely because like Topsy it just growed. There was no overall authority, noInquisition, no Synod to rule and regulate what men thought; practice wasregulated, behavior was governed by caste councils. Social life was, relativelyspeaking, orderly and stable; intellectual life was a free for all. Inden refers,without any further reference, to the “schizophrenic religion of Shiva andVishnu” (1992: 129), implying that that attribution of schizophrenia was theview of some or all Indologists. It need hardly be added that a résumé of thehistory of religion in Europe, careful to note all schisms and sects, would be noless confused and probably more schizophrenic than that of India.Inden proceeds to expose the Orientalist as claiming a “shift of essences, from a masculine Aryan mentality that had been tropicalized, to a feminineDravidian or aboriginal mind that had been Aryanized,. . . The change fromdepicting an Indian mind that was the same in its racial origin as that of the Selfto one that was fundamentally different was significant.. . . the imperial jungleofficers that took charge after the Mutiny...came to imagine themselves aspresiding over an India comprised of Dravidian plants that could only bemanaged” (1992: 120).58david smith"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Then come the tribals. Inden says it is on to the tribals that the Jungians –Inden’s term for scholars interested in Indian mythology and art in themselves,rather than as instrumental in social scientific understanding – “offload thesavagery, animal sacrifice, and general fetishism and animism formerly attrib-uted to the Dravidian.”Campbell conjures up this essence: “For the calmly ruthless power of thejungle. . . has supplied the drone base of whatever song has ever been sung inIndia of man, his destiny and escape from destiny” (122).Inden performs his customary trick of equating jungle with woman:This defining essence consists of nothing more than the female side of the mind,that which threatens to overcome man’s consciousness and reason. There has tobe sure, been a beneficent side to this femininity: [Inden quotes Campbell again:]“New civilizations, races, philosophies, and great mythologies have poured intoIndia and have been not only assimilated but greatly developed, enriched, and[made?] sophisticated.”[Inden:] But the goddess, Kali, condensation of this jungle essence, is alwaysthere:[Campbell:] “Yet, in the end (and in fact, even secretly throughout), the endur-ing power in that land has always been the same old dark goddess of the long reddark tongue who turns everything into her own everlasting, awesome, yet finallysomewhat tedious, self.” (1992: 123).Inden comments, “Thus have the Jungians pushed the romantic idea ofHinduism as an ambivalent feminine entity to its extreme.”The reader gets from Inden no indication that India contains a great varietyof cultures, that there is a real difference in many ways between North India andthe Dravidian language speakers of the South, and that the great forests ofCentral India still contain millions of tribal peoples, who only in the last hundredyears or so have given up widescale human sacrifice. These are not figments ofthe Orientalist imagination but facts. As Felix Padel remarks in his sensitivestudy of the Konds of Orissa, “tribal India is as different from mainstream India,as that is from Britain, or more so” (1995: 11). The jungle dwelling primitive hasbeen an important factor in Hinduism; S ́iva and Pa ̄rvatı ̄ often dress as tribals.Hinduism, Hindu authors, delight throughout history in running the gamutfrom the grandeur of metropolitan monarchs to warriors to forest dwellingascetics to forest dwelling tribals. All part of life’s natural hierarchy, just like the caste system.Inden accuses Campbell of conjuring up an essence, but Inden himself is per-forming a conjuring trick, conjuring up an ascription of femininity where it doesnot exist – the Orientalist is the Other over which he seeks hegemony. But theGoddess does play a vital, indeed an essential role, in Hinduism. In his zeal to putwords into the mouths of Orientalists, Inden overlooks the realities of Indiantexts. The flesh-eating goddess deep in the jungle was a standard theme ofSanskrit and Tamil heroic texts. Inden several times refers to the Emperor Hars.a.Ba ̄n.a, the great prose poet of Hars.a’s reign, in his unfinished prose poemorientalism and hinduism59"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Ka ̄dambarı ̄, gives a well known portrayal of a Durga ̄ shrine in the depths of theVindhya forest, manned by a Dravidian priest. The poem begins with a tribalprincess bringing a parrot as present from her father to the King. Her feet marked with leaf patterns in lac resemble Durga ̄’s feet reddened by the buffalo’sblood. The leader of the tribal hunters who captured the parrot had his shoul-ders scarred with making blood offerings to Durga ̄, his body like Durga ̄’s markedwith blood of buffaloes, all this foreshadows the final remaining part of the orig-inal, when the prince, having met and fallen in love with the beautifulKa ̄dambarı ̄, is ordered home by his father, and deep in the jungle comes acrossa shrine of Durga ̄, described by Ba ̄n.a in great detail; no less detailed is theaccount of the Dravidian priest who attends this goddess. Quarrelsome, irrit-able, ill-educated, he is a figure of fun. He is an exponent of all the New Age fadsof the day. One eye was destroyed by a fake ointment to make him all-seeing; tothe other eye he applied collyrium three times a day; his singing sounded like thebuzzing of flies. On and on goes the scornful account of impossible goals –alchemy, levitation, invisibility, and more. The prince laughs aloud when he seesthis strange figure, but is then polite to him, restrains his followers fromtormenting him, and gives him money when he leaves. The elegant prince,tormented by love in separation, here views an almost complete panorama ofsouthern Hinduism exemplified in the priest, with a distant reserve reminiscentof a colonial administrator.In fact Ba ̄n.a was playfully referring to what was certainly later a well estab-lished theme in Indian literature, namely that of kings visiting a goddess ofdestruction in the jungle prior to going to battle (as in the Gaud.avaho and theKalin.kattupparan.i). Goddesses were indeed to be found in jungles, not just in theOrientalist imagination. Bayly remarks on Inden’s swingeing critique, “Fewauthorities escape his blade. If at times he appears in the guise of the manyarmed goddess Kali strutting through the scholarly carnage sporting a necklaceof academic skulls, his goal is still Regeneration” (C. Bayly 1990: 1313). This jeud’espritby the most authoritative of British historians of India credits Inden witha power he does not in fact achieve; as well as likening him to a Goddess hechooses to ignore. Furthermore the analogy of Inden to Ka ̄lı ̄ shows a power ofimagination that Inden would not approve of, for imagination is the secondobject of Inden’s witch hunt. Imagination unquestionably played a major partin Hinduism, just as it does in every culture.Britain exploited India and exerted power over India in many ways, butOrientalist Indologists, inevitably contaminated to some extent by the prejudicesof their age – how could they not be? – were not “making a career of the East.”They sought mastery of a body of knowledge in a way somewhat parallel to aSanskrit pandit’s quest for mastery of a body of knowledge. The procedures weredifferent, but the goal of both was purely intellectual: Orientalists and traditionalIndian scholars sought the power and glory of the intellect. The analysis offeredby Said and Inden at first had a seductive thrill, an overturning of idols, thelaying bare of the dialectic of self and other, seemed to throw a powerful search-light on the underside of the study of the East. But what this attempted and60david smith"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"apparently successful deconstruction overlooks is what is in fact blindinglyobvious. In Orientalism in its original meaning was not oppression of the East,but the colonization of the western mind by the East. It is the strength of Indianideas and Indian texts that overpowers the western scholar, that forces him tospend his life in willing servitude to them.Notes1Salutary is Jamison’s acknowledgment of the Vedic scholarship of A. B. Keith,“undervalued, presumably because of the superficial contempt he affects for thetexts. (But could he have spent so much care and intelligence without some respectfor the texts? And can those who evince more respect for the texts claim as large acontribution to our understanding of them? I cannot.)” ( Jamison 1991: xiv).2Kejariwal’s work establishes that “the world of scholarship and the world of admin-istration...were worlds apart” during the period he studies, 1784–1838 (Kejariwal1988: 226). Trautman notes, “So far from there being a thick institutionalized con-nection between Orientalism and empire, as readers of Said might be led to imagine,one could say, roughly, that the study of Sanskrit varied inverselywith imperialism. . . It is as if the British had been persuaded by James Mill’s preposterous argumentthat ignorance of Indian languages was a positive aid to the formation of uncloudedviews on imperial policy” (Trautman 1997: 189).3Hastings quoted the Bhagavadgı ̄ta ̄in his letters to his wife, finding it a source of inspi-ration. In his private notebook he asked himself “Is the incarnation of Christ moreintelligible than. . . those of Vishnu?” The current European superiority owednothing to Christianity, but was due to “a free government, cold climate and print-ing and navigation” (quoted by Trautman 1997: 72).4Inner second panel of west pillar of north gate, the Great Stupa, Sanchi.

Greek (w)oida, English wit,witness,Germanwissen). The Four Vedas are the oldest extant texts of India and containreligious and ritual poetry, ritual formulas and the explanatory prose thatinterprets these very texts, and additionally, in the late Vedic Upanis.ads, someearly philosophy.According to post-Vedic, medieval Indian tradition, the Four Vedas are calledS ́ruti, that is “something (revealed to and) heard” by the “primordial” sages (R.s.i).By contrast, the concept ofSmr.ti“something learnt by heart” is restricted to thepost-Upanis.adic texts, such as the Su ̄ tras (see below) or Manu’s law book, all ofwhich are believed to have been composed by human beings. However, it isknown from internal evidence that the Vedic texts were orally composed innorthern India, at first in the Greater Punjab and later on also in more easternareas, including northern Bihar, between ca. 1500 bceand ca. 500–400 bce.The oldest text, the R.gveda, must have been more or less contemporary withthe Mitanni texts of northern Syria/Iraq (1450–1350 bce); these mentioncertain Vedic gods (Varun.a, Mitra, Indra, Na ̄satya) and some forms of earlySanskrit that slightly predate the R.gveda (mazda ̄for Ved. medha ̄,vasˇanafor Ved.va ̄hana, etc.). However, there still is no absolute dating of any Ved. text. Pertinentparameters include the first use of iron (in a post-R.gvedic text, the Atharvaveda,at ca. 1200/1000 bce) and the lifetime of the Buddha (at 500 or perhaps rather400bce) who postdatesalmost all Vedic texts. However, all Vedic texts predatethegrammatical commentary of Patañjali (ca. 150 bce) and his predecessor Pa ̄n.ini,who quote most of them.The Vedic texts were orally composed and transmitted, without the use ofscript, in an unbroken line of transmission from teacher to student that was for-malized early on. This ensured an impeccable textual transmission superior tothe classical texts of other cultures; it is, in fact, something like a tape-recordingof ca. 1500–500 bce.

However, almost all printed editions depend on the late manuscripts that arehardly older than 500 years, not on the still extant and superior oral tradition.Correct recitation of many texts indeed continues in certain traditional areas,such as Kerala, southern Tamil Nadu, coastal Andhra, Orissa, Kathiawar, atPoona or Benares. In the past few decades there have been attempts by local andforeign scholars to preserve, or at least to record, the oral tradition. However, nocomplete recording on tape or video of all Vedic recensions (s ́a ̄kha ̄) exists so far,and some texts have been lost even during the past few decades.According to Indian tradition, the Vedas are divided into four parts (R.g-,Sa ̄ma-, Yajur-, and Atharva-Veda). This division corresponds to that of the mate-rial as used in the post-R.gvedic ritual (see below); each Veda again is subdividedinto four levels: the Sam.hita ̄ “(Mantra) collections,” Bra ̄hman.a “(theological/ritual) commentary,” A ̄ran.yaka “wilderness texts,” and Upanis.ad “(secret philo-sophical) texts (of correlations and equivalences learned) sitting at the feet (ofthe teacher).” One has to add the ritual Su ̄tra, which are regarded as belongingto the Smr.tibut are late Vedic in content and language.These traditional divisions into four kinds of texts, however, actually repre-sent five historical layers (see the Appendix at the end of this chapter, also forabbreviations of texts), as indicated by the development of the Vedic languageused: that of R.gvedic, of the Mantras, of Yajurveda expository prose, of theBra ̄hman.as (incl. A ̄ran.yakas, Upanis.ads) and of the Su ̄tras. These five layers onlypartially overlap with the traditional divisions.The R.gvedaThe oldest Vedic text, the R.gveda (RV), is composed in archaic, highly stylizedpoetical Sanskrit. It contains verses of praise addressed to the Vedic gods and tosome early contemporary chieftains; it also includes some speculative hymns andsome (probably) nonritual poetry. Most of the hymns, however, were intended tobe recited at the yearly Soma ritual, celebrated at the time of New Year.The RV contains 1,028 hymns arranged in ten books, actually ten “circles”(man.d.ala). Book 9 is a separate, fairly late collection containing the texts ofSa ̄man hymns to be sung during the Soma ritual. Book 10 and part of book 1are even later additions. The RV has been transmitted in one recension (the s ́a ̄kha ̄of S ́a ̄kalya) while others (such as the Ba ̄s.kala text) have been lost or are onlyrumored about so far.vedas and upanis.ads69"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"The RV text was composed before the introduction and massive use of iron,that is before ca. 1200–1000 bce. Internal evidence indicates that most hymnswere composed over a span of just five generations, under the Pu ̄ ru and Bharatachieftains, notably the great Bharata king Suda ̄s; they represent the middleR.gveda period, with such prominent poets as Vis ́va ̄mitra and the East Iranian(?)immigrant Vasis.t.ha. A few older hymns apparently come from other tribes, suchas the Anu-Druhyu and Yadu-Turvas ́a.They were composed by members of various clans of poets (among which 7major ones, RV 2–8). The hymns that belonged to them were transmitted as“private property” which often was “copyrighted” by including the names of theindividual poets or clans or by typical refrains. Most of the poets belonged to, orwere later attributed to, the An.girasa clans and also the Ka ̄n.va. The namesattributed to the authors of R.gvedic hymns seem to be partially correct, whencorroborated by self-reference or indirectly by certain poetic devices; however,many of the names recorded in the clearly post-R.gvedic Anukraman.ı ̄ (“list” ofpoets, deities, meters) are artificially derived from some key words in the hymns;these names often do not correspond to those given by the Sa ̄mavedic,Yajurvedic, and Atharvavedic traditions.Poetic SpeechThe most characteristic feature of all R.gvedic poetry is the power and prestigeof speech (va ̄c) and verbal behaviorin general, without which the RV itself wouldnot exist. The gods (but also the human listeners, especially the sponsors of theritual) were most pleased by “the newest hymn,” composed with poetic crafts-manship and virtuosity – to which they were entitled as ritual guests; the betterthe hymn, the greater the reward – to the poet from the patron, to the patronfrom the god.Most prized, however, is the putting into words of the much celebrated R.ta(=Avestanasˇ.a)“active realization of truth” or Wahrheitsverwirklichung (cf.Lüders 1944, 1951, 1959 “Truth”), is commonly still translated “cosmic order”or “cosmic harmony.” The vital force of R.ta indeed has the power to keep thecosmos and human society functioning correctly. This untranslatable conceptthus is similar to the later Hindu dharma. The opposite concept ofdruh- (Avest.druj) “deceiving, cheating action, (Be)-Trug” (cf. Engl. be-tray) signifies activeuntruth. Another contrast to R.taseems to be nir-r.ti, the absolute disappearance(nir-) of “active, creative truth, law, order,” that is absolute destruction, a sort ofhell of absolute darkness, with no food, drink, possibility of children, etc. (RV7.104).Capturing R.ta in words is effected by bráhman, the “formulation” or captur-ing in words of a significant and non-self-evident truth (Thieme 1952, cf. Renouand Silburn 1949, Gonda 1950, Schmidt 1968a). The formulator (brahmán-) ofsuch truths has special powers, effecting this world and the cosmos. The samepower of correctly stated truth is found in the (later) *satyakriya ̄or “act of truth”70michael witzel"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"(Brown 1940, 1968, Lüders 1917, 1944) which has counterparts in other Indo-European (Watkins 1979) and Eurasian cultures (Witzel forthc.). Such formu-lated speech must be recited correctly, otherwise there is danger of losing one’shead (as in the indras ́atrulegend TS 2.4.12.1, S ́B 1.6.3.8). The original author,always a Vedic R.s.i, is a brahmán- “possessor ofbráhman-” whose name is remem-bered and must be uttered to this day.Contents of the R.gvedaApart from the predominantly ritual contents of the R.gveda there are a fewhymns of highly poetical value and of early philosophical speculation. Some ofthese hymns, such as the famous love story of Puru ̄ ravas and Urvas ́ı ̄ (RV 10.95),have been used by the later Epic and classical poets. All of R.gvedic poetry is verycomplicated and enigmatic: it is based on the poetical norms of the precedingIndo-Iranian and Indo-European periods, it refers to many fragmentarily knownmyths, uses many archaic formulas and set phrases, and a vocabulary that wasalready archaic then, and its expression in general is very elliptical.There also are stanzas that praise the local chieftains, who where sponsors ofR.gvedic ritual. The area of the Greater Panjab was inhabited by some 30 to 50tribes and clans in whose service the transient RV poets composed ever “newhymns” in praise of the gods and chieftains.A number of hymns are in dialogue form; these have hardly been used in laterritual; however, they belong to the most beautiful and poetical pieces of the RV.The hymns dealing with early philosophical speculation have usually beenunderstood as presenting contemporary developments, but many of the topics,such as that of the primordial giant (Purus.a), go back to Indo-European (i.e. theOld Norse Ymir) and even to a preceding Eurasian period (i.e. the Chinese/MiaoPangu). After the end of the R.gveda, this kind of speculative poetry was contin-ued in the AV (S ́aunaka AV books 8–12) which still were composed by thebrahmán, now turned priests, and later, in the Yajurvedic Ga ̄tha ̄s and S ́lokas,down to the Upanis.ad period.R.gvedic MythologyUnderlying the praise of the gods is a complicated system of mythology that isnot stated as such by the text, but must be extracted laboriously, just like all otherinformation about this period. Much of it goes back to the common Indo-Iranianand Indo-European periods.Many of the deities are transparently “natural” though they have acquired acertain amount of “personality,” while others, developed during the Indo-Iranian period, are deified abstractions that belong to the ethical (Varun.a, Mitra,Aryaman, Bhaga, etc.) and conceptual sphere (R.ta) as well as to ritual practicevedas and upanis.ads71"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"(Soma). However, as Kuiper (1962: 43) has pointed out, “understanding a singlemythological figure isolated from the context of the mythological system” is dif-ficult, and a more structuredarrangement of (semi-)divine beings and their func-tions in their relevant spheres should be undertaken. They include the heavenlysphere with the deities and their ancestors, other heavenly beings such as theGandharvas, the R.s.is, human ancestors (pitr.); further the mundane sphere withhuman beings and certain spirits, and the nether world with beings such as theNa ̄ga, and finally, various demonic beings such as raks.as,kimı ̄din, and the forceof destruction, Nirr.ti, all of whom are governed by the universal force of “activetruth” (R.ta) and its counterpart “deceit, cheating” (Druh). These beings and enti-ties are set in juxtaposition or opposition on the various levels of the universe.For example, the promiscuous, extra-societal group of Veda students “on leave,”the Vra ̄tyas here on earth, have their counterparts in heaven (daivya vra ̄tya,Gandharva, Vasilkov 1991), as well as in the netherworld (Na ̄gas).The most important (R.g)Vedic gods include the following. Agni is deified(ritual) “Fire,” one of the few gods that are actually present andvisible on theoffering ground. He receives and transports offerings to the gods.Indra, originally called Vr.trahan “beating the resistance” (Avest. VRreJragna,Benveniste and Renou 1934) is the leader of the present generation of the godsand a major actor in the early stages of creation: he pushes up the sky, and pre-pares the oikumeneby opening the Vala cave of the Dawns (Schmidt 1968a), bykilling the Dragon Vr.tra, and by stealing the Soma (Brown 1968; Lüders 1951:183ff.; Kuiper 1983; also: Sieg 1926, Schneider 1971, Dandekar 1979). Indraalso is the archetypal tricky, voracious, and oversexed leader of the A ̄rya in thefrequent battles among themselves and with the non-A ̄rya population of theGreater Panjab (E. W. Hopkins 1908, Rau 1957, Dandekar 1997). Many of hischaracteristics go back to IE (Watkins 1995) and even to the preceding Eurasianmythology. The Maruts, a sort ofMännerbund, are often associated with Indra.Soma “the one pressed out,” is the deified drink, as well as the plant from whichit is derived (also called by the Central Asian substrate name am ̆.s ́u). Withoutdrinking Soma, Indra could not kill Vr.tra (Oberlies 1989, 1991, 1998).The A ̄dityas, “the sons of Aditi” are a group of 7/8 (later 12) divinities thatwere at first interpreted as nature gods (Bergaigne 1878–83, III: 110ff., Keith1925, 96–104, Hillebrandt (1927–9: 2ff., 41ff.). However, they are personifi-cations of the most important social functions (Meillet 1907, Thieme 1938,1957a, Dumézil 1934, 1958b, Gonda 1972): Varun.a is a stern but just king-figure, of unclear etymology (Lüders 1951/1959, Thieme 1957a, Kuiper 1983);Mitra, Varun.a’s constant partner, is a personification of tribal agreements (mitra,ntr. “agreement”) (Meillet 1907, Brereton 1981); and Aryaman “Arya-hood,hospitality” that of clan relationship and marriage. Further, the popular Bhaga“Luck” (bhaga“share”), is god of good luck, and similarly Am.s ́a “lot” (am.s ́a“lot”). The As ́vins (Na ̄satya) are divine twins who perform miraculous cures andrescues.Us.as, “Dawn,” is the most prominent goddess, and the often-praised friend ofpoets. Other deified natural phenomena, who can be traced back to the Indo-72michael witzel"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"European and even to earlier Eurasian periods, include Su ̄rya “the male belong-ing to the sun”; Dyaus “Heaven, Sky” (or Dyaus Pitar “Father Sky”) and his consort, Pr.thivı ̄ (Ma ̄ta ̄) (Mother) “Earth,” the A ̄pas “(flowing) Waters,” oftencalled “divine ladies” (Narten 1971); Va ̄yu or Va ̄ta “Wind,” and Parjanya“Thunder.” As elsewhere, fire is regarded as masculine and water as a femininedeity, while the “elements” fire and water exist separately as archaic neuters(athar-/*peh2ur-,udr-/udn-) – a very old, Indo-European and perhaps pan-Eurasian notion (Witzel 1992). Many rites and customs (offering meat balls tothe three closest male ancestors, marriage, fire ritual, horse sacrifice, etc.) are ofIndo-European age as well.Similarly, the notion of an opposition between groups of gods (Deva andAsura), which is later expressed by “The Devas and the Asuras were in con-tention” (Br. style texts), goes back to the Indo-Iranian and even the IE periods.In the RV, however, asurais often used as epithet of the most respected Devas,e.g. Varun.a and Agni, and in early Iranian religion ahurasignifies the mostprominent god, Ahura Mazda ̄“Lord Wisdom.” This difference is one of “thecentral problems of Vedic religion” (Kuiper 1975: 112, W. E. Hale 1986). Itseems (with Kuiper) that the Asuras were the primordial gods, challenged anddefeated by the upstart Devas, similar to that of the Titans by the Olympian gods.The constant contest between the Devas and the Asuras has its mundanecounterpart in the R.gvedic opposition between the immigrating A ̄ryaand theiracculturated affiliates on the one hand, and the previous local inhabitants, theDasyuorDa ̄saon the other; this opposition is replaced in post-RV texts by that of the A ̄ryaandS ́u ̄dra. It is expressed most notably in the New Year ritual(Maha ̄vrata rite), when the old order breaks down temporarily and carnival-likechaos reigns among the gods and in society. Vedic ritual enforces the social roleofdeva/asuraanda ̄rya/s ́u ̄draprecisely at such occasions.Praja ̄pati (“Lord of creatures”) is a very marginal figure in the late RV, butbecomes in the Post-RV prose texts the central creator god embodying the powerof the ritual (Gonda 1984, 1986, 1989).The great Hindu gods Vis.n.u and S ́iva are not yet prominent in Vedic. Vis.n.uappears almost only in his role as taking three steps towards heaven and S ́iva asa frightening god under his names “Rudra,” ghora“terrible,” or simply as asaudevam“that god.” The name S ́iva“the kindly/auspicious one” occurs only in thelate Ved. Kat.ha A ̄ran.yaka. The process leading to their later prominence is rathercontroversial. Kuiper (1962) sees Vis.n.u as a central mediating figure betweenthe older Asuras and the younger Devas.R.gvedic RitualThe important relation between myth and ritual is very evident in the Vedic tra-dition: Agni and Soma are ritual objects anddivinities with a developed personalmythology; mythic episodes are recited in liturgical context. Later on, in thevedas and upanis.ads73"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Bra ̄hman.a style texts, mythology explains (details of) and refers to ritual activ-ity in mythological narratives. A deep connection was felt by the composers ofthe texts (K. Hoffmann 1975/6: 516–22, 422–38, Sieg 1902, Schmidt 1968a,Falk 1984, Heesterman 1985, Jamison 1991, Witzel 1986b, 1992, 1998).Indeed, most of the R.gvedic hymns relate to early Vedic ritual. Though the RVdoes not contain any direct description, various allusions and mentioning of itsfeatures in this highly poetical text can be used to establish a fairly consistentdescription (for its interpretation, see below). However, relatively little system-atic work had been done on assembling the details of R.gvedic praxis (but, nowProferes 1999, Schmidt 1973, Witzel 1981/2). Except for a brief discussion ofthe RV Soma ritual (Geldner 1951), scholars had taken the clear descriptions ofthe S ́rauta ritual as their starting points (van Buitenen 1968: Pravargya; Gonda1980b: Sautra ̄man.ı ̄; Hillebrandt 1897: 11–17, Keith 1925: 252–6). However,Schmidt (1973) shows that the sacrificial animal was tied to the offering poleand decapitated, while in the “classical” ritual the animal was still tied to thepole but then suffocated outside the sacrificial ground. Similar developments,also in the assembly of the texts to be recited, are shown by Proferes (1999).The most important RV ritual is that of the preparation, offering, and con-sumption of the sacred drink, Soma, dealt with at length in RV 9. It was pre-pared from an unknown plant (probably Ephedra) growing in the highmountains of the Pamirs (Mt. Muzh, Mu ̄javant), eastern Iran, and the westernHimalayas. This plant was soon substituted as the R.gvedic civilization expandedeastwards into the Indus and Gangetic plains. Soma seems to be a substitute forthe earlier Indo-European sacred drink, made from fermented honey (mead). Itmost probably was taken over, by both the Indo-Aryans and the Iranians, fromthe local population of the Bactria/Margiana area who seem to have called it bythe non-Indo-Iranian word am ̆.ss ́u. Its antiquity is indeed underlined by theZoroastrian tradition, where it appears as the important haomaritual.Other important rituals include the kindling and worship of fire which mustbe present in all rituals. It is identified with the fire in the sun, as can be seenmost clearly in the post-R.gvedic Agnihotra ritual and also in the oldest Zoroas-trian ritual (Yasna HaptaNha ̄iti). Many such features, including some of thenames of various (usually seven) priests, such as that of the Hotar (ZaraJusˇtrahimself was a Zaotar), go back to the Indo-Iranian period. Other rituals, such asthe Indo-European horse sacrifice (Puhvel 1987) or some equally old domesticrites of passage (death and marriage), are only sparsely attested in the RV.Several of the R.gvedic rituals, just as some of its S ́rauta successors, are con-cerned with the liminal periods in the yearly progression of time (daily, fort-nightly, seasonal, and yearly); they are the “rites of passage” of the year. Kuiperstresses that “the oldest nucleus of the R.gveda was a textbook for the new yearritual” (1960: 222); Schmidt (1968a) connects the morning pressing of theSoma ritual with the Vala myth and with the New Year/spring season and sug-gests a connection of the midday pressing with the Vr.tra myth and the rainyreason; H. Falk additionally underlines the spring time “coming of the waters”in an Arachosian context (1997).74michael witzel"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"R.gvedic ritual evolved further during the middle and late R.gvedic period (Pro-feres 1999), especially under the influence of the Vis ́va ̄mitra clan, and wasrather artificially elaborated, systematized, and codified; it emerged, by the timeof the early post-R.gvedic/early Mantra period collections (Witzel 1997a,b), asthe famous “classical S ́rauta ritual” that is prominent in all post-RV texts andstill is performed in some traditional areas of India and Nepal.Collecting and Ordering the Early Vedic TextsAccordingly, the firstcollection of (most) available RV hymns dealing with ritualwas made under the Bharata dynasty of the early Kuru kings, such as thefamous Pariks.it; he is first attested in the early post-RV Khila collection (5.22)and later on is a prominent figure in the Maha ̄bha ̄rata. His time, one of greatpolitical, societal, religious, and linguistic change (Witzel 1989a, 1997a) ispraised as a golden age, among other with the telling refrain (RVKh 5.22): “thepeople thrive in the realm of King Pariks.it.” The break-up of the old tribal societyof the R.gveda and the rise of the intertribal Kuru realm (Witzel 1997a,b) thussaw strikingly new developments in ritual and in the development of Brahman-ical pre-scientific science of correlations (see below).The other Vedic Sam.hita ̄s dealing with the new S ́rauta ritual (SV, YV, and AV)were collected during the early Kuru period, too. These are linguistically youngerthan the RV, younger even than its late appendix book 10. At this time, the tra-ditional jobs of the various Vedic priests were divided into four classes, attributedto the four main S ́rauta priests who were to represent and use the Four Vedas.They include (each with three helpers) the Hotar who now only recites Mantrasfrom the RV, the Uga ̄tar who sings the Sa ̄man melodies, the Adhvaryu who is themain offering priest carrying out the actions of the S ́rauta ritual while mum-bling Yajurveda Mantras, and the Brahmán priest who supervises the whole ofthe ritual, mostly in silence (Renou 1949, Brereton 1988) and remedies it, incase of mistakes, by reciting a few Mantras from the Atharvaveda (Bodewitz1983).When the Sam.hita ̄ texts were collected, they were each ordered in particularbut individual ways: The RV is arranged according to strict, mostly numeri-cal principles (Oldenberg 1888): Its first level of order is that of author(family/clan), followed by that of deity and meter, that is, inside each family col-lection the hymns are arranged according to deities: Agni and Indra come first,then other deities, depending on the number of hymns addressed to them (indecreasingorder); inside each deity collection the longer hymns come first andthe shortest last; in case of equal length, a hymn with a longer meter comes first.This organization is well reflected in the core (“family”) books of the RV. Allhymns that do not follow this order were added after the initial collection, as isclear by their many late grammatical and other features. The family books of theRV are arranged in increasingorder, from short books (RV 2) to longer ones (RVvedas and upanis.ads75"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"7); this is visible, however, only when the additional hymns are excised. Thus, ifone knows – as is still prescribed today before reciting a hymn – its author, deity,and meter, one can pinpoint its location in the RV family books accurately. This“numerical” arrangement was perfect for society without script.The Other Vedic Sam.hita ̄sWhile the RV contains original compositions, the Sa ̄maveda was extracted,except for 75 verses, from RV 9 and 8. These stanzas are sung, mostly during theSoma ritual, in a very elaborate fashion, including much coloraturaand the oftennonsensicalstobhas(such as the string ha ̄ o ha ̄ o ha ̄ ha ̄yiorbha ̄,dada,hup). Theyare the earliest preserved music of India. The SV is divided into two main sec-tions, the Arcika containing the actual text used, and the Ga ̄na which contain-ing the melodies themselves. These are designated by the textof well knownmelodies, somewhat in the following fashion: one should sing a certain textaccording to the melody “God save the Queen,” which is also applied to theAmerican song “America it is thee,” to the imperial hymn of Germany, and tothe royal one of Norway.In stark contrast to the other Veda texts, the Atharvaveda contains, in itsoldest sections, magical poems used for healing and for all sorts of magic, includ-ing destructive sorcery (AV 1–7). To these sometimes very old texts (reminiscentof Germanic and Hittite sorcery stanzas), a large number of speculative hymns(AV 8–12), other hymns dealing with the most important life cycle rituals (AV13–18) as well as two appendixes (AV 19–20) have been added.The AV is ordered, most clearly in its Paippala ̄da version, in clear oppositionto the arrangement of the R.gveda: it starts with a book that is composed entirelyof short hymns of just 4 stanzas and increases to one that has 19. To this nucleusof sorcery stanzas (PS 1–15), the speculative (PS 16–17) and Gr.hya type hymns(PS 18) as well as the appendixes (PS 19–20) were added.The Yajurveda, however, mainly contains prose Mantras (yajus.) that are usedas offering formulas; they must accompany each individual action in ritual(yajña) carried out by the Adhvaryu priest who mumbles them as he proceeds,for example “you are heaven, you are earth,” “move through the interspace!”These prose Mantras have not been recorded in the R.gveda, though the yajus.genre is mentioned, and the extant YV Mantras are younger in form andgrammar than the RV. Originally, they consisted only of simple, though rhyth-mical prose; but already in the first collections (MS, KS, TS), verses from the RVhave been added in a linguistically later form that is often slightly degraded byperseveration. Once the YV Sam.hita ̄s were collected according to diverse s ́a ̄kha ̄traditions, however, the form of the Mantras did no longer change and they weretransmitted faithfully to this very day.To these Mantras, large sections ofbra ̄hman.astyle expository prose have beenadded during the YV prose period (see below). Both of them combined consti-76michael witzel"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"tute the texts of the Black Yajurveda, while the explanatory prose (S ́B) is sepa-rated from the Mantras (VS) in the White YV whose Sam.hita ̄ (VS) was only sec-ondarily extracted from the late Vedic S ́B.The YV Mantras have not been arranged numerically as in the RV, SV, and AVbut in the order they are used in S ́rauta ritual: they form small, individualMantra collections meant for each ritual. However, the order of these individualMantra collections inside the two dozen extent YV Sam.hita ̄s followed a fixedorder already by the time of the first YV Sam.hita ̄ collection; this order is main-tained, with minor variations, down to the Su ̄tras.The YV starts with two small collections, that of the vegetarian New and FullMoon offerings (haviryajña) and of that of the all important Soma ritual, both ofwhich form the paradigm (prakr.ti) of (most) other S ́rauta rituals; even theanimal sacrifices (pas ́ubandha) are technically considered as haviryajñas.The Post-R.gvedic Reform of the S ́rauta RitualWhile the S ́rauta ritual (yajña) has been central to most post-R.gvedic texts,detailed descriptions are only found in the late Vedic period, in the S ́rauta Su ̄tras.Earlier texts, such as the MantraSam.hita ̄s and the discussion of selected detailsin the Bra ̄hman.a texts allow only to infer the general course of the ritual, whileits exact order is not strictly followed. We need a new, detailed survey of S ́rautarituals and their contents (Hillebrandt 1897, Keith 1925, Renou & Filliozat1947; Gonda 1960, Mylius 1973: 475–98, cf. Renou 1953 with a lexicon ofritual terminology, Dandekar and Kashikar 1958–, with the extensive but stillonly half-complete S ́rautakos ́a compendium).A thorough interpretation of the S ́rauta ritual that uses the wealth of Vedicdescriptions and contemporaneous native interpretation is a desideratum.Though begun a hundred years ago (S. Lévi 1898, Hubert & Mauss 1923–4,Mus 1935: 79–121, cf. Sahlins 1972, Witzel 1992, 1998, Lopez 1997), a com-prehensive interpretation still is outstanding – disregarding for the momentrecent monolateral theories (agonistic origins: Heesterman 1985, 1993; mean-inglessness: Staal 1979a,b; 1990). In addition, the structure(s) of the ritual, theinterrelations of particular rituals, and their internal development (Staal 1982,1990, cf. Witzel 1981/2, 1997a,b, Falk 1986, 1988) still deserve more study. The S ́rauta ritual is built up of multiple frames or “boxes” (Heesterman1957, 1993, Witzel 1984b, 1986b: 172, 1987a, 1992, Minkowski 1992). Forexample, ava ̄ntaradı ̄ks.a ̄means “the lower, inner consecration,” i.e. the one whichhas been inserted into the normal consecration rite of the Soma ritual. Smallerand larger sets put together form new (sub)units, and there is a tendency, justas in Pan.inean grammar, to substitute one set by another (Hillebrandt 1897,Heesterman 1957, Witzel 1986b).For now, the meaningof Vedic ritual (yajña) may be summarized as follows(Witzel 1992, 1998, Jamison and Witzel, 2002): its most important feature,vedas and upanis.ads77"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"mostly neglected until recently, is the principle of reciprocal exchange (Witzel1979, 1998, Weber-Brosamer 1988, Malamoud 1989, Wilden 1992, Lopez1997; denied by Heesterman, 1985: 83): the classical “do ̄ ut de ̄s” is expressed as“give me, I give you” (dehi me dada ̄mi te, TS 1.8.4.1, VS 3.50, Mylius 1973: 476).The ritual oblations and the hymns of praise are just oneact in an endless cycleof exchanges ofanna“food” between the humans and the gods. The term annain fact stands for a variety of substances, so that a whole Upanis.ad chapter (TU3) surprisingly can deal with “food” (Lopez 1997). The concept survives to thisday as “code substance” in actualexchange, especially in village society (Marriot1976). In Vedic ritual and in modern society it is the code substance “food” thatis given, altered, consumed and partiallyreturned, keeping the path open forfuture transactions (Sahlins 1972).In some detail: the fire god (Agni) carries the offerings to the gods. Fire alsotransubstantiatesthe offerings, not simply (Malamoud 1972) by a conversionfrom a raw, uncooked state into a palatable, cooked one but also by one from amundanesubstance into one with divine characteristics; during this process itsvarious consistent parts are split up and take new shapes (Va ̄dh. Br. 4.19a =Caland 1990: 416ff).As such, “food” travels towards the gods in the form of smoke and aroma(medha) and is consumed by them. The remains here on earth are a return giftof the gods who have tasted the food while sitting at the sacred fire, soiled it bytheir spittle and rendered it consumable only by their socially inferior relations,the human beings: this is the remnant (ucchis.t.a), greatly extolled (AV 11.6) ashaving enormous potential (Malamoud 1975, Wezler 1978, Lopez 1997). Thegods also give other return gifts to men, e.g. rain, sons, food, long life – thestandard wishes of a Vedic Indian.Apart from the gods, the ancestors and the ancient sages and poets, the R.s.is,are part of the system of exchange as well. Offering to all of them is regarded asdelivering oneself from the innate r.n.a“debt, obligation” (cf. Malamoud 1989:115–36) that is inherent to all men. It is based on the simple fact that humanbeings are the somatic descendants of the gods (via the A ̄ditya Vivasvant/Ma ̄rta ̄n.d.a and his son Manu, the ancestor of mankind). As such, they have totake care of their direct and ultimate ancestors, just as the present gods (deva)do of their own ancestors (Aditi myth, MS 1.6.12) by offering food (s ́ra ̄ddha,pin.d.a) and water to their three direct ancestors and to a vague group of lessimmediatepitr.s.For the brahmins the R.s.is represent both direct somatic and spiritual ances-tors; these, the poets of the RV, are a dead poets’ society who have actually gainedaccess to heaven. While both Pitr.s and R.s.is are fed with actual food offerings,the seers additionally receive their own sort of “code substance” (anna), that isspeech (va ̄c), through the daily recitation by humans of their R.gvedic poetry.Even today, Vedic recitation is preceded by the actual mentioning of the poet’sname as to supply him with “spiritual food.” The circle is closed by the releaseof “divine” inspiration (dhı ̄) to latter-day poets who want to compose “a newsong” (bráhman), such as a speculative hymn in the AV, a ritual ga ̄tha ̄, or a sorceryspell (bráhman) all of which make truth work (satyakriya ̄).78michael witzel"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"The ritual system, however, does not work without s ́raddha ̄(lit. “place theheart,” Latincre ̄do ̄), the “confidence” in the efficacy of the ritual, i.e. its abilityto motivate counter-gifts and to lead to heaven (Köhler 1948/1973, Lüders1924, Hara 1964, Hacker 1963.)The ritual procedure thus represents an eternal cycle which functions withinthe bounds ofR.ta. Various more or less abstract notions take part as well, e.g.va ̄c,bráhman,s ́raddha ̄/manas,karman (action),anna,ucchis.t.a, many of which aredealt with in the speculative hymns of the RV and AV and are in need of detailedstudy.Reciprocity is not confined to sentient beings but also found in the phenom-enal world as a system of constant recycling: phenomena originating in heaven(such as rain) come to earth and nourish and are even transformed into other entities (such as plants and other living beings, semen, milk) that ulti-mately make their way to heaven again (as offering). In this cycle nothing iswasted or lost (Frauwallner 1953: 49, Schneider 1961, Bodewitz 1973: 243ff.),a concept that contributed largely to the middle Vedic system of homologies andcorrelations.This mutual exchange is also seen in the social relations between men – e.g.between a sponsor (yajama ̄na) and his priest or his poet. The poet bestows praiseon the patron, aids him in praising the gods, and expects material rewards inreturn, as is clearly and detailedly expressed in the so-called da ̄nastutior “Praiseof the gift” of the RV. Similarly, the priests expect their daks.in.a ̄“priestly gift,”whose extent and nature is mandated by the reciprocal system and by the natureof the ritual in question. The daks.in.a ̄seems to be a “diversion” to the priest ofthe original gift given to the departing guest (i.e. the gods!). For, the ritual systemof exchange is based on the formalized rules of (human) hospitality (Thieme1957b) and of marriage, where reciprocity is seen in the function of Aryamanas god of marriage who supervises guest friendship and the inherent exchangeof brides.Other major features of the S ́rauta ritual include: there is no fixed place ofperformance, no temple or permanent structure: the S ́rauta ritual is “portable,”with a new sacrificial ground and with new, simple (archaic) wooden and clayimplements in each ritual. The ground is prepared by careful measurement anddemarcation (see S ́ulba Su ̄ tra, Michaels 1978) and the building of fire altars.The central act of almost all Vedic rituals is the offering of various edible ordrinkable substances into these 3–5 (and in some rites even more) fires.The ritual is sponsored by the yajama ̄naor “sacrificer” (lit. “one sacrificing onhis own behalf ”), who first has to become an a ̄hita ̄gni(one “having establishedfires”), after studentship and marriage, and belonging to the three “Twice Born”A ̄ryaclasses, (Bra ̄hman.a,Ks.atriya,Vais ́ya); only these thus could gain directaccess to heaven through S ́rauta ritual; the S ́u ̄drawere then and still areexcluded.Ritual performance involves a number of priests (up to 16 or 17, divided intofour groups). These, and the four Vedas they represent, cooperate closely in theperformance of a particular S ́rauta sacrifice (“as in a violin quartet,” Caland1990).vedas and upanis.ads79"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Themainparticipants, however, are the (except for Soma and Agni) invisibledeities who are invited to attend as guests in a formal, ceremonial act of hospi-tality; they are fed and entertained by praise and song (Thieme 1957a,b).Medieval and modern pu ̄ja ̄still retain this pattern (Witzel 1980, Bühnemann1988).The rituals range from the simplest one, the Agnihotra or “Fire Offering,” tothe most elaborate of the S ́rautarituals, such as the Agnicayana (“piling of thefire [altar]”) and the horse sacrifice (As ́vamedha). Their complexity is derivedfrom incorporation of many less complex S ́rauta rites (Hillebrandt 1897, 1987;Heesterman 1957, 1985; Staal 1982, 1990; Witzel 1987a, 1992, Minkowski1992).The most important rituals include the following. The initial establishment ofthe fire, the Agnya ̄dheya (Moody 1989, Krick 1982); then, the Haviryajñas,most of which are determined by the rhythm of the year, and of the sun and themoon. The early morning and evening offering of milk (and similar products)into the fires (Agnihotra) ensures the survival of the sun during the night(Dumont 1939, Bodewitz 1976, Witzel 1986a, 1992). Brief as it is (some 15minutes), it comprises about 100 actions; a number of extraneous rites havebeen added, such as an offering of milk to the As ́vins, the setting in motion ofthe heavenly waters of the Milky Way and of semen for men and milk for women(Witzel 1992); in addition we find the usual Vedic wishes: sons, rain, cattle, supe-riority within clan and tribe, living for the proverbial hundred years, and findinga way to Heaven. S ́rauta ritual clearly is multivocal; the original meaning of anyS ́rauta ritual cannot easily be found; all its actions and the Mantras used andtheir history have to be traced first (Witzel 1981/2).Other liminal rituals include the “New (and) Full Moon” sacrifice(Da ̄rs ́apu ̄rn.ama ̄sa), offered twice per lunar month (Hillebrandt 1879, Rustagi1981), and the seasonal rituals, the “four-monthly” Ca ̄turma ̄sya, in spring,rainy season, and autumn, and additionally, around New Year (Bhide 1979,Einoo 1985, 1988).The Pas ́ubandha or “Animal Sacrifice” (Schwab 1886) is also integrated into the Soma ritual, and involves the killing of an animal. The inauspiciouseffect of killing is undone by involving substitution for the Adhvaryu priests and“bloodless” suffocation outside the actual offering ground; both are major fea-tures of the S ́rauta mind set, as exemplified by the foundational (charter) mythof the As ́vins as the Adhvaryu priests of the gods (Witzel 1987a,b, 1997b, seebelow.)The Soma Sacrifices are based on the Agnis.t.oma, a one day ritual (Caland-Henry 1906–7) that involves a special consecration (dı ̄ks.a ̄) of the Yajama ̄na andthe pressing and offering of Soma in the early morning, at midday, and in thelate afternoon. An important preliminary (and charter type) rite is the Pravar-gya, a hot milk drink for the As ́vins (van Buitenen 1968, Kashikar 1972). Vari-ants of the Soma ritual last up to a year or even more; in the important 12 (ormore) day Sattra(“Sitting”) variety, the priests themselves undertake the ritualfor their joint benefit (Falk 1985).80michael witzel"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Other important S ́rauta rituals include the Ra ̄jasu ̄ya(“Consecration of theKing,” Weber 1893, Heesterman 1957), the As ́vamedha(“Horse Sacrifice,”Dumont 1927, S. Bhawe 1939) which can only be performed by a great king, and also the atypical Agnicayana(“Piling of the Fire Altar,” Staal 1983,Kolhatkar 1986), a Soma ritual in which an additional raised fire altar of bricksis used. (A film and video tapes of the 1975 performance in Kerala have beenused by Staal 1983.)The Bra ̄ hman.a TextsAll aspects of the S ́rauta ritual have been discussed at length in the so-calledbra ̄hman.atexts. The oldest texts, in a stark expository style, are contained in theYV Sam.hita ̄s of the Black Yajurveda. The linguistically younger ones are inde-pendent texts, the Bra ̄hman.as proper, which are attached to each of the fourVedas-Sam.hita ̄s (see the Appendix at the end of this chapter). The most import-ant texts are the JB of southern and the S ́B of eastern North India, the early ABof the eastern Panjab (its later sections, AB 6–8, come from the East), and thestill largely unused Va ̄dhB, which is situated between the JB and S ́B.Differently from the power entailed in poetic composition (bráhman) and itscorrect recitation, the Bra ̄hman.a style text stress correct knowledge (“he whoknows thus,” ya evam.veda) of the hidden meanings of the ritual and the corre-lations (homologies) on which it is based (Witzel 1979, Wezler 1996). This so-called “identification” technique correlatescertain items in the three spheres ofmicrocosm (humans, society), mesocosm (yajña, i.e. ritual), and macrocosm(gods, universe, cf. Klaus 1986). This procedure led to a complex, amorphous(and still not completely described) web of “hidden” cosmic and mundane interrelations that was known only to the ritual specialists who used it to obtaincertain desired effects.The universe thus is a rich and esoteric system of homologies. This “ritualscience” (Oldenberg 1919, Schayer 1925, Witzel 1979, B. K. Smith 1989,Wezler 1996) is based on the strictly logicalapplication of the rule of cause andeffect, even though its initialpropositions (e.g. “the sun is gold”) are somethingthat we would not accept. The power of such esoteric Brahmanical knowledgehas led – a fact that is not always recognized – directly to the speculations foundin the Upanis.ads. The system was increasingly systematized by whole sets of par-allel and interlinking correlations, so that by the time of the Upanis.ads, certaintruths about the world and the humans could be expressed by a simple summa-tion such as “tat tvam asi” (Brereton 1986).The Bra ̄hman.a style prose texts thus are the oldest explanations, in fact nativecommentaries, of the literal meaning of the Mantras, of their ritual applications,and of their often hidden secret import; futher, these texts discuss many ofthe individual actions of the ritual. In addition, they deal with a large variety oftopics, from etymology to customs and beliefs; they also include many vedas and upanis.ads81"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"mythological tales that are meant to bolster the status of individual rites, as wellas much incidental ritual speculation.An all-important point of discussion in this period is how to avoid evil (agha,enas,pa ̄pa) and pollution. This wish – and not the avoidance of violence as such(Heesterman 1985), which always remains involved in the classical ritual – isone of the important driving forces behind the Kuru time S ́rauta reform. Thelittle studied and less understood myth of Indra cutting off the head of Dadhyañcis the “charter myth” of the main priests acting in ritual, the Adhvaryus, whowant to avoid directinvolvement in the evil and pollution caused by killing nec-essary in ritual. They delegate these actions to helpers, working outside the sac-rificial ground, and killing is not even referred to overtly: the animal is “pacified”(s ́am) (Witzel 1987a: n. 103); similarly, evil and illnesses are sent off in alldirections (Witzel 1980).Theactual reformof the ritual, and its origins in the early Kuru realm,however, can clearly be attributed to a combination of late/post-RV political,social and religious changes (Witzel 1989b, 1995/1997a,b). The relationshipbetween the development of Vedic ritual and changing social and political struc-tures still is a promising field for further inquiry (Zimmer, 1879: 425–8; W. Rau1957, Falk 1986, Witzel 1989b, 1997a,b).The A ̄ran.yaka TextsA ̄ran.yaka (A ̄r.) should have been translated, for nearly a century (Oldenberg1915), as “wilderness (texts),” notas frequently still met with, as “forest texts.”For, these texts are nottexts meant for ascetics but as regular bra ̄hman.astyletexts which discuss the more secret and dangerous rituals. Therefore, they havebeen prescribed to be learned and recited outside, “from where one cannot seethe roofs of the settlement.” The main focus are the Maha ̄vrata (RV A ̄r.) and thePravargya (YV A ̄r.) rituals. The treatment of the Pravargya in S ́atapatha Br. isnot only part of the Br. itself (S ́B 14) but even is referred to in S ́B 4 (Witzel,1987a).Because of their special position as additional texts the A ̄r. have become anopen category where one could add all sorts of later Vedic texts, such as manyUpanis.ads and even one early Su ̄tra (in S ́A ̄). Many extraneous items have addedto the nucleus of dangerous S ́rauta rituals, including even post-Vedic Upanis.ads(MNU).The often maintained connection of the A ̄r. texts with the post-Vedic life stageof the va ̄naprasthais only a medieval fiction. Also, the idea that these texts arespiritually more complex and evolved than the Bra ̄hman.as is modern myth. Ineffect, it is only the Upanis.ads (often part of the A ̄ran.yakas) that are of philo-sophical content. In sum, the view that both the A ̄r. and the Upanis.ads shouldbe aligned with the latter two of the (classical, medieval) four life stages(va ̄naprastha,sannya ̄sin) is to be rejected as later, post-Vedic interpretation.82michael witzel"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"The Upanis.adsThe Upanis.ads (Up.) contain the secret teaching, by a variety of late Vedic teach-ers, of early philosophical speculation about the nature of the world and ofhumans and their fate after death, as well as the earliest discussion of the work-ings of rebirth and karma. Various small heterogeneous sections have subse-quently been added, such as last admonitions of the teacher to his “graduating,”departing students (Witzel 1980, Thieme 1989). The texts were often calledRahasya“secret,” as they were supposed to be learned only by specially selectedstudents, which explains their often less well preserved state of transmission.Tradition, indeed, sees the Up.s as the end of the Veda (veda ̄nta), that is of thefour “historical” levels of the Sam.hita ̄s, Br.s, A ̄r.s, and Up.s, while in fact, the lateVedic Su ̄tras (see below) still are an integral part of the Vedic canon.It is from the background of the Bra ̄hman.a style texts that the thinking of theUpanis.ads emerges. If not radically new, it still involves a thorough rethinkingof the existing correlative premises, in part influenced by late Vedic social con-ditions of the eastern territories of North India (Kosala, Videha). Here, a thor-ough reorganization of the bra ̄hman.astyle texts (in S ́B) took place, including arethinking of many of the earlier “theological” positions. Further, the increas-ing Sanskritization of the area along western (Kuru) models brought about theformation of canonical texts, a general ordering of S ́rauta procedure, and newdeliberations of its inherent meaning (Witzel 1997a,b).Thus, the Upanis.ads do not break with tradition but rather continue it, influ-enced by the current and local religious background (Renou 1953). While theyare often treated as the beginning of philosophical tradition in India (or as a pre-cursor to early Buddhist and Jain thought) they are in fact the almost inevitableoutcome of the intellectual development of the Bra ̄hman.a period, when suchquestioning was prominent both inside and between the Vedic schools (s ́a ̄kha ̄).However, it was expressed differently, not in Upanis.adic dialogue form, but bystatements such as “some say . . .” or by the frequent quotations of divergentviews in the bra ̄hman.atype texts, especially in S ́B where various “solutions” to aproblem are habitually discussed and still presented as authoritative, positivestatements of truths. The Up.s, however, contain discussions in the form of realdialogues, involving severe questioning and reluctant admission of innocence orboastful claims of knowledge.The Up.s deal with the eternal problems of humankind, that is: where do wecome from, why we are here, where go? In other words, with the nature of bodyand soul, their fate after a death, and their position in the Universe. Additionally,following the trend towards larger scale correlations, the ritual itself increasinglybecomes the subject of cosmic identifications (e.g. the horse of the As ́vamedhain BA ̄UK 1.1). But, ritual also is interiorized and can be performed entirely men-tally (Bodewitz 1973). Both positions are signs of the intense contemporaneousintellectual activity that apparently included also some Ks.atriyas and women(Oldenberg 1915, Renou 1953, Horsch 1966, Witzel 1989a).vedas and upanis.ads83"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Certain new doctrines emerge: The late Bra ̄hman.a opinion on the fate ofhumans after death (punarmr.tyu), and most importantly, karmawhich is nowjoined to the older concept of automatic rebirth (Kane 1962, Horsch 1971,O’Flaherty 1981, Tull 1989, Göhler 1990). Most studies, however, fail to inves-tigate these concepts in their proper setting, that is by asking: what happens, inthe view of Vedic people, at conception, at birth and at death to a human being(Witzel 1984a, 1998, Ikari 1989)?The older Vedic (and probably Indo-European) idea involved an automatic,continuous cycle of human beings: after death, a stay in the blissful world of theancestors, limited only by the “amount” of one’s ritual actions (is.t.a ̄pu ̄rta,sukr.ta),and a subsequent automatic rebirth (MS 1.8.6), preferably within one’s ownclan and usually after the third of fourth generation. Nobody wanted to escapefrom this cycle of eternal return, except for the wealthy sponsors of S ́rauta ritualwho hoped to attain, eternally, the Heaven of the gods. The opposite, getting outof the cycle by becoming a renouncer (sannya ̄sin), developed only during the Up.period. The only other “escapees” are precisely those who have committed someserious actions that undermine the closed Vedic system of exchanges: murder-ers of embryos, of the brahmins’ cow, etc.: that is, destroyers of the all-important “line of progeny” (praja ̄tantuTU 1.11, 11, Witzel 2000) and of poeticinspiration (dhı ̄,dhena ̄), the “cow” (dhenu) of the Brahmins (Witzel 1991); allthese drop forever into “deepest darkness,” into the lap of Nirr.ti “destruction.”The earlier system of automatic recycling was now replaced by one condi-tioned by the moralvalue of the actions undertaken during one’s lifetime. Thenew concept has its predecessors, on the one hand, in the fear of a second death(punarmr.tyu) occurring after a limited stay in the ancestor’s world, and on theother, by the fear of a retribution in the other world, as exemplified by the visionof Bhr.gu (S ́B 11.6.1, JB 1.42): humans are cut up by trees felled by them andthey are devoured by animals slaughtered in this world.The old concept of cause and effect thus was linked with some new anxieties.One was no longer sure of the beneficial effects of ritual that allowed to neu-tralize all violent, “evil” actions carried out in ritual, to “beat away the seconddeath,” and to attain the desired permanent stay in heaven (Schmidt 1997).Now, allhuman actions (karma), not just the ritual ones, have their automaticconsequence, as expressed by the new and secret karmaidea. The juncture of theold concept of automatic rebirth with that of the younger one of automatickarmaset the stage (Schmidt 1968b) for the development of a consistent theoryof retribution in one’s next life according to the actions (karma) undertaken inthis one. This is the basis of nearly all of later Indian philosophy and should bestudied as such.Once, ChU 5.3.7 clearly says that the karmaconcept was known only to theKs.atriyas, and in BA ̄U 3.2.6 Ya ̄jñavalkya takes his fellow brahmin A ̄rtabha ̄gaapart to talk with him privately about karma. Apparently, the idea was not very“popular” at first. It originated with some brahmins in Ya ̄jñavalkya’s time innorthern Bihar (Witzel 1989a), and spread at an uneven pace: even in the lastpart of ChU, at 8.15, it was still felt necessary to speak about killing in ritual as84michael witzel"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"notbeing evil, in fact, as guiltless (Witzel 1987a,b), and the beginning of theBhagavadgı ̄ta ̄ still defends the dharmaof a Ks.atriya as the norm – that is the dutyto fight and kill.However, the cycle of automatic rebirths has now been broken for the firsttime. The Upanis.adic ascetics (such as Ya ̄jñavalkya, when he “went forth intohomelessness,” BA ̄U 4.5.15) and the contemporaries of the Buddha strive foremancipation that frees them from the sam.sa ̄raof rebirth. Formerly, this wasonly the undesired lot destined for felons who had committed severe offenses.Now, one leaves home forever to strive for the knowledge ofbrahman. Traditionalsociety quite consequently regarded such persons, once they had left, as socially“dead,” and it did not allow for their return. Some middle level Upanis.ad texts(Kat.ha-S ́ruti Up., Ma ̄nava S ́rautasu ̄tra 8.25, Sprockhoff 1987) have preserved aritual of taking leave from home and all one’s possessions while declaring non-violence (ahim.sa ̄) to all beings.Several factors thus come together and lead to a qualitative breakthrough,which results in the new karmic rebirth idea and, based on increasing use ofhigher levels of correlations, in the assertion of the identity of the human soul(a ̄tman) with that ofbrahman(neuter) in such famous sentences as tat tvam asi(ChU 6.10.3, Brereton 1986).Many facets of the newly introduced concepts still are in need of detailedstudy, e.g. that of a scale on which one’s deeds are weighed and otherIranian/Zoroastrian/(S ́aka?) concepts. However, the often repeated convictionthat it was the Ks.atriyas who introduced the karmaconcept is far-fetched(Horsch 1966, Olivelle 1996: xxxiv). The mentioning of the topic by a king, agod (Varun.a), or Ya ̄jñavalkya’s secretive conference rather are literarydevices(Witzel 1997a) which merely underline the importanceof the theme. Using awoman, Ga ̄rgı ̄, in BA ̄U 3 has similar effect as women usually do not appear inpublic assemblies of learned disputation and when they do so, they stand out.The other prominent woman in BA ̄U, Maitreyı ̄, quite untypically hadlearntBrahmanical lore. It is only to her that Ya ̄jñavalkya speaks about eschatology(BA ̄U 4.5.15). Similarly, the idea that it was the Jainas, the local aboriginalpeople, etc. who “invented” these ideas is, of course nothing more than anadmission of ignorance (O’Flaherty 1981), as there simply are no early recordsof the Jainas and even less of the aboriginal inhabitants. Rather, later Vedicthought quite naturally led to this stage, and to a whole range of more or lesscontemporary and quite diverse points of view, as discussed in the Pali canon(Dı ̄ghanika ̄ya 2).Why did these developments take place precisely at this moment, and in thisarea of Northern India (Kosala, E. Uttar Pradesh, and Videha, N. Bihar)? Thebreakthrough is similar to the more or less contemporary ones elsewhere – evenif Jaspers’ idea of an “axial age” suffers from some severe incongruencies in theactual time frame. Indeed, external influence is not likely in Bihar, unless oneposits some Iranian influence (see above): after all, Zoroastrianism first stressedindividual decision making: one had to chose between “good” and “evil” and hadto face a last judgment after death.vedas and upanis.ads85"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"The Kosala–Videha area was one of great mixture of peoples due to variousmovements of tribes and individuals, and consequently also of ideas (Witzel1989a: 236, 1997a). It also was a part of the spread-zone of the western, Kurutype Vedic orthopraxy. Some late- or post-Vedic immigrants such as the Malla,Vr.ji (Vajji), or especially the S ́a ̄kya, may be Iranian tribes (Witzel 1989a: 239)who may have transmitted (para-)Zoroastrian influence. Further, there wasadmixture of local Mun.d.a peoples (AB 7.18), of older, eastern Indo-Aryan set-tlers, and of contemporaneous immigrants including many western Brahmins.A comparison of the late Vedic and early Buddhist texts indicates admixture ofthe older, para-Vedic Indo-Aryan religion of the East with the orthodoxy andorthopraxy of the “missionary” Kuru-Pañca ̄la Brahmins of the West, who wereinvited by such kings as Maha ̄kosala and (Maha ̄)-Janaka (Witzel 1989a, 1997a)of the emerging large kingdoms of Kosala and Magadha. Finally, there was thesocial ferment created by the contemporaneously emerging cities (of the so-called second urbanization, after the Indus civilization). The Vedic texts hardly,if ever, speak about towns (Mylius 1969); however, Brahmins never liked theirpolluting social atmosphere and rather preferred to live in the countryside wherethey could regulate their life properly. Yet, by the time of the Pali texts, cities arefully established, with rich merchants carrying out a long distance overlandtrade (of the luxury article, Northern Black Polished Ware), and brahmins livingin the formerly off-limits lands of Magadha and An.ga.All of these admixtures supplied the ideal breeding ground for the meeting ofideas and the development of new concepts. Just as the break-up of the oldR.gvedic tribal society caused enormous social and religious change (see above),the new stratified and partly aristocratic, partly oligarchic (not a “republican”one, Rhys-Davies 1911), and partly urban society of the East witnessed theemergence of many of the typically Upanis.adic ideas described above.The so-called Middle Up.s (I ̄s ́a, Kat.ha, Kena, Pras ́na, Mun.d.a, Ma ̄n.d.u ̄kya,S ́veta ̄s ́vatara, Maha ̄na ̄rayan.a, etc.) are no longer composed in prose but in verseand are heavily influenced by the post-Vedic (Epic) language. Many of them showa tendency towards the sectarian worship of a particular deity. The Sam.nya ̄saUp.s (Sprockhoff 1976, Olivelle 1992), composed around 300 bce, discuss the newly introduced life stage of the renouncer. The Bhagavadgı ̄ta ̄of theMaha ̄bha ̄ratais sometimes regarded as an Up. as well. Sectarian Up.s (in Epic/Classical Sanskrit) have been composed well into the Middle Ages. In the inter-pretation of the Upanis.ads the eighth century monistic philosopher S ́an.kara hasplayed an important but generally overrated role. We still are in need of a detailedphilological edition and discussion of the important older Upanis.ads.The S ́rautasu ̄trasThe Vedic canon concludes with the late Vedic Su ̄tras (“thread, guideline,” orKalpasu ̄tra“ritual guidelines”) which form the trueend of the Vedic period and86michael witzel"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"its texts, though the classical/medieval tradition assigns them to a separate cat-egory, the Smr.ti texts. Indeed, the older ones among them (BS ́S, Va ̄dhS ́S, etc.) arestill composed in late Br. language. The Su ̄tras are descriptive and prescriptivetexts that deal systematically, in the proper order of ritual procedure, with thesolemn ritual (S ́rauta Su ̄tra), with the domestic rituals (Gr.hya Su ̄tra), and withthe rules of proper behavior as a Veda student or as householder (Dharma Su ̄tra).(There also are various later additions to all Vedic texts, Paris ́is.t.a.)The older Su ̄tras such as BS ́S, Va ̄dhS ́S explain the complicated ritual step-by-step and at great length, in clear prose and by quoting the Mantras in extenso.Even if a ritual that is described later in the text is built out of ritual blocksdescribed earlier, these older Su ̄tras still describe such complex rituals in extenso.Later Su ̄tras make increasing use of the referring technique which points backto earlier parts of the text by quotation (“as said earlier”) and of using just theinitial words of a Mantra (pratı ̄ka). The later texts use shorter and shorter(nominal) clauses, a technique seen in its apogee in Pa ̄n.ini’s grammatical Su ̄ tras,the As.t.a ̄dhya ̄yı ̄.The most important Su ̄tras include the early BaudhS ́S and Va ̄dhS ́S, the some-what later A ̄pS ́S (with many quotations from other texts), all of the YV; the earlyKS ́S of the RV, the LS ́S and JS ́S of the SV, and the rather late VaitS of the AV. TheS ́S of the White YV, the late KS ́S is the one most developed one along the linesdescribed above.The contents of the S ́rautasu ̄tras follow, by and large, the scheme first set outin the Mantra collection of the Yajurveda Sam.hita ̄s, and the individual rulesfollow those of the Bra ̄hman.a style texts (Tsuji 1952).The Gr.hyasu ̄trasThe Gr.hya Su ̄ tras (GS) often form part of, or actually are, an appendix to theS ́rauta Su ̄ tras, and some of them refer back to ritual details described earlier inthe same text or even in the S ́rauta Su ̄ tra. Their contents, however, often are veryold. Some of the rites of passage (sam.ska ̄ra, Pandey 1957, P. V. Kane 1930–62,Gonda 1980a), such as burial and marriage, have been described already in theRV and AV, and some of the details may in fact go back even to the Indo-European period, for example the offering of three meat balls (later, made of rice)in the anniversary rituals (s ́ra ̄ddha) for one’s three immediate ancestors(Schrader 1919), or the cult of the fire, or the marriage ceremony; other items,such as the initiation of the student by a girdle, are of Indo-Iranian age (Avest.aißiia ̄.hana, Ved. mekhala ̄).By and large, the GS deal with the rites of passage form birth to death (Stenzler1864, Hillebrandt 1897, Apte 1939, transl. Oldenberg 1886/1892), or rather,from one’s conception to one’s dissolution in the vague group of ancestors (pitr.).The GS thus are a cyclical set of rituals variously arranged as starting with mar-riage, with initiation to Veda study (upanayana), or even with pregnancy.Nvedas and upanis.ads87"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"The “original” contents of the Gr.hya texts (Oldenberg 1892), however, havebeen influenced by the much more predominant ritual form, that of the S ́rautaritual (Gonda 1977, B. K. Smith 1986). Thus, even in the supposedly “simple”domestic ritual, the activity of the yajama ̄nawas superseded by the actions of theBrahmin house priest (purohita). However, there is only a single fire as comparedto the 3–5 of the S ́rauta ritual, and many of the simple Gr.hya rituals have coun-terparts in the solemn S ́rauta ones, including the morning and evening offer-ings (homa), the New and Full Moon offerings, etc. Their exact (pre)history isdifficult to establish.This is different, as indicated, for marriage and death as even the RV containshymns devoted to marriage (10.85, expanded in AV 14, PS 18.1–14) and tofunerals (10.14–18, AV 18, PS 18.57–82); in addition, PS 20 even containssome of the actual dialogue of the upanayanarituals (cf. S ́B 11, TA ̄2, TU 1.11,Kat.hS ́iU), similar to the verbal exchanges at the marriage ceremony (Kajihara2002). The rather composite RV marriage hymn is a recounting of the mythicalorigin and prototype of human marriage, that of the goddess Su ̄rya ̄ with Soma.Some marriage features of the GS (Apte 1978, Winternitz 1892, Zachariae1977, 1989, Tsuji 1960) are clearly present in the RV, others are not yet men-tioned (the circumambulation of the fire, the mounting of the stone, the gazingat the pole-star) but already appear in the AV. The funeral hymns clearly describecremation, though the RV also refers to burial, exposure on trees and “throwingaway” of the dead body. Satı ̄was not practiced (Witzel 1996); in fact, there isevidence for levirate marriage (Schmidt 1987). Much space is given in the GS toancestor worship (Caland 1893, 1896, 1914, Winternitz 1892).The yearly return of the Veda student to his teacher (Heesterman 1985)follows a period of about half a year away from “school” when the young men(marya) were members in a Vra ̄tya Männerbund, as reflected already in someearlier Vedic texts (cf. AV 15, PS 18; Falk 1986, Bollée 1981, Heesterman, 1981:251–71). The vra ̄tyas, frequently still misunderstood as semi- or non-A ̄rya, livea roaming, independent and promiscuous life while trying to collect a “startingcapital” of cattle, by threatening, from the settled section of society. They arereflected, in the divine sphere by the daivya vra ̄tya, the Gandharvas (Vasilkov1991).Women are not prominently discussed in these and other Vedic texts (Jamison1996), though their role in the sam.ska ̄ras of marriage and child birth is of courseprominent. However, the role of women in the Upanis.ads is usually overstated.The only(!) two famous ones, Ga ̄rgı ̄ and Maitreyı ̄, are inserted – just likeKs.atriyas and kings, or the son of a god, Bhr.gu – at critical, innovative or strik-ing junctures of a dialogue. Yet, there also is clear, though sparse evidence offemale learned activity, such as at BA ̄U 6.4.17 which has a prescription of howto obtain a female R.s.i in one’s family, as is indeed mentioned for the Atri clan (JB 2.219).Just as the AV Sam.hita ̄s, the “Gr.hya Su ̄tra” of the AV (Kaus ́S, Bloomfield1889, Caland 1900) contains many facets of early Indian life that would oth-erwise escape us. The text uses the same, magical system of homologies that cor-88michael witzel"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"relate and control macrocosmic forces by microcosmic manipulation (Henry1904, Stutley 1980). Earlier, comparable texts are the official S ́rauta rituals, theKa ̄mya ̄ Is.t.i“wish offerings” of the YV (Caland 1908). The Kaus ́S provides manyusages for the AV Sam.hita ̄ spells; other sorcery practices are found in the (late)Sa ̄mavidha ̄na Bra ̄hman.a. Many obscure magical terms have been preserved inmore recent sorcery (Türstig 1980). The only partially translated Kaus ́.S. is avirtual handbook of customs and beliefs, of common white and black sorcery,of healing procedures (Filliozat 1975, Zysk 1985), of omina and portenta(Weber 1859). Many such details can be followed up later on in the AV Paris ́is.t.aand in the medieval books on dreams (Stuhrmann 1982, v. Negelein 1912), orin the Jyotis.a literature (Pingree 1981).The Dharmasu ̄trasThese Su ̄ tras deal with dharma“proper behavior,” beginning with that of a Vedastudent, and moving to that of a married man (gr.hastha), his daily and seasonalritual duties, family life, to the death rituals and ancestor worship and inheri-tance; some also include the duties of a king and his jurisprudence, the fourstages in life, and long sections on atonements for wrong behavior. These ruleshave provided the basis for medieval and modern Anglo-Indian Hindu law.Many of these rules overlap with those of the Gr.hya Su ̄tras, and some may bequite old, such as the incidental rule, found also in Pindar’s Erga, not to urinatetowards the sun. The Up.s, too, contain a Dharma Su ̄tra in nuce, the final admonition about good behavior in adult life by a Veda teacher to his departingstudent (TU 1, Kat.hS ́iU, Witzel 1980).Finally, there are a number of appendixes to the Vedic texts, of variousperiods, such as the R.gvedakhila, or the AV-Paris ́is.t.a, some of which are alreadycomposed in the style of the Epic and Pura ̄n.as.Personal and Popular ReligionPersonal, popular and non-Brahmanical religion are much less visible in theVedic texts, which therefore must be compared with the slightly later Pali canon,and the evidence of the (still little defined) older strata of the Maha ̄bha ̄rata.Religious feelings and experiences are mentioned by very few poets in the RV,such as Vasis.t.ha in RV 7.86–9 (Goto 2000), who speaks, not unlike Zoroaster,of a very personal relationship with Varun.a, or Bharadva ̄ja Ba ̄rhaspatya whodescribes (RV 6.9.6–7) not, as usual, a vision but also an acoustic experience ofGod Agni. Other items include the old Indo-Iranian (and Eurasian) topic of flyingthrough the night time sky on a boat, (both in RV and in Avesta, Oettinger1988). There also is a shaman-like experience of the “(long) haired one” (Kes ́in,vedas and upanis.ads89"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"RV 10.136), cf. also that of the bird Laba (RV 10.119) who touches heaven andearth with his wings. The AV contains much popular sorcery and magic, but ina form that has been influenced by the priests. Later on, we have the infernalvisions of Bhr.gu (S ́B, JB) or those of Ya ̄jñavalkya of the dream state (BA ̄U 4.3),or about the way of the emancipated to the “heavenly” palace of Brahman (KU,Thieme 1951/2).Popular festivals at New Year include horse chariot races and bow shooting,public riddles, sexual banter and public intercourse of two “outcasts” (a prosti-tute, maha ̄nagnika ̄, and a Ma ̄gadhaman); further, singing and dancing at summersolstice. Such materials have been collected by Zimmer 1879 for the Sam.hita ̄s,and by W. Rau 1957, 1977, Mylius 1971–4, Basu 1969, Gopal 1959 for thelater texts.Some late sections in the GS deal with the worship of particular gods, such as Rudra/Maha ̄deva/I ̄s ́a ̄na, Vis.n.u/Na ̄ra ̄yan.a, S ́rı ̄, Durga ̄(Baudha ̄yanaGr.hyas ́es.asu ̄tra, Atharveda Paris ́is.t.a etc., Einoo 1992, 1996). They contain pu ̄ja ̄-like rites that cannot be pinpointed in time. Pu ̄ja ̄is, however, a clear continua-tion (Witzel 1980) of the R.gvedic guest worship offered to the gods. Otherworship, such as that of snake deities (Na ̄ga), trees, etc. is even more opaque. Theworship of images is first visible in texts in Patañjali’s Maha ̄bha ̄s.ya (5.3.99:429.3), at ca. 150 bce.True heterodoxy is attested by ca. 400 bcewhen several such systems haddeveloped, including those of wandering teachers such as the Buddha andMaha ̄vı ̄ra (Dı ̄ghanika ̄ya 2). Nearly all them stem from eastern North India,where the constantly changing cultural ferment favored dialogue and competi-tion. Ya ̄jñavalkya’s departure into homelessness (BA ̄U 4.5.15) takes up the tra-dition of (long distance) wandering by Veda students and Vra ̄tyas; indeed, theBuddhist san.ghahas, unobserved so far, some vra ̄tyafeatures as well: a singleleader of a larger group of equals who wander about in the countryside and liveon extortion (or by begging), stay away from settlements, have special dress andspeech, etc.The east was indeed quite different from the western parts of Northern India,as seen in language (Witzel 1989a), social structure including the oligarchicstates, and in burial practices: while the Kurus built small square grave mounds,the “easterners and others(!)” have “demonic” round graves (S ́B 12.8.1.5).We get only glimpses of what may have been other aberrant (ritual?) sexualbehavior at AB 7.13, or in the Gosava ritual, or already in the RV notion ofs ́is ́nadeva,mu ̄radeva.Even less can be said about the pre-Vedic religion of the Indus Civilization andof the contemporaneous aboriginal tribes. They were assimilated by Sanskriti-zation, e.g., a leader (sthapati, MS 2.2.4) of the Nis.a ̄das, or at AB 7.18, wherethe R.gvedic(!) R.s.i Vis ́va ̄mitra assists the eastern Iks.va ̄ku king Haris ́candra bysymbolically adopting local “barbarian” tribes (dasyu), such as the Andhra,Pun.d.ra, S ́abara “who live in large numbers beyond the borders.”Though some ideas, customs and beliefs of the Harappan civilization seem tohave been incorporated into the subsequent Vedic world view (tree worship,90michael witzel"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"etc.), a Vedic connection of the so-called S ́iva Pas ́upati found on some Harappaseals (D. Srinivasan 1984) cannot be established; this mythological concept isdue, rather, to common Eurasian ideas of the “Lord of the Animals” who isalready worshipped by many Neolithic hunting societies. Similarly, the remnantsof the so-called fire rituals at Kalibangan (B. B. Lal 1997) involve clearly non-Vedic offerings of animal bones; they (and the so-called “lin.ga steles,” actuallysupports for cooking pots) may represent nothing but a community kitchen ofthe Indus Civilization (R. S. Sharma 1995: 47).BibliographyApte, V. M. Social and religious life in the Gr.hyasu ̄ tras. Ahmedabad, 1939.——.The sacrament of marriage in Hindu society from Vedic period to Dharmas ́a ̄stras.

Along with arthaandka ̄ma,dharma is one of thethree goals (trivarga) in the life of a Hindu.There is no equivalent term for dharma in Western languages. The noundharma is derived from the verbal root dhr., which means “uphold, maintain,sustain, keep in balance.” Hence dharma is the way, the right way, to maintainorder and balance in the universe generally. As long as every element in thecosmos – the sun, water (the monsoon), animals, plants, and humans in par-ticular – acts according to its dharma, the overall balance is maintained. As soonas any element in the cosmos in some way deviates from its dharma, i.e. commitsadharma, the overall balance is disturbed. At the human level, dharma gover nsevery aspect of and every activity in the life of a Hindu. Dharma is not synony-mous with “law” which has become an often used translation for dharma– thedharmas ́a ̄stras became known in the West as “law books” (see below) – nor with“religion” which is the meaning dharma acquired in modern Indian languages.In addition to legal rules (legal procedure, substantive law) and religious rules(birth rituals, marriage rituals, rituals for the dead, etc.), there are in thedharmas ́a ̄strasa number of injunctions which, in Western terms, would belabeled “dietary” (allowed and forbidden foods), “hygienic” (bathing, brushingthe teeth), “moral,” etc. These rules, which every Hindu is supposed to live by,are supplemented by other rules, which concern members of certain sections of"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Hindus only. An individual’s specific dharma (hissva-dhartna) is primarily deter-mined by two criteria: his social class and his stage of life.The members of the four social classes (varn.a, often translated with the moremodern term “caste”), Brahman/Brahmin (Bra ̄hman.a),Ks.atriya,Vais ́ya, andS ́u ̄dra, have different dharmas. The three higher classes, the dvijas “twice-born,”have three kinds ofdharma in common: study the sacred texts (adhyayana),patronize sacrifices for their own benefit (yajana), and generosity toward others(da ̄na). The Brahman’s specific dharma includes teaching the Vedic texts(adhya ̄pana, the causative form ofadhyayana), performing sacrifices for thebenefit of others (ya ̄jana, the causative form ofyajana), and receiving special giftsto which only Brahmans are entitled (pratigraha). The Ks.atriya maintains lawand order inside the territory and defends the country against outsiders; the kingwho, theoretically though not always in practice, is the principal Ks.atriya, hashis own ra ̄jadharma. The Vais ́ya earns a living with trade, crafts, and agriculture.The members of the sole class that is not twice-born, the S ́u ̄ dras, have only onedharma: be of service (s ́us ́ru ̄s.a) to the members of the three higher classes.There are also four life stages (a ̄s ́rama), during each of which the dharma ofthe Hindu is different. At an early age (5 or later, depending on his social class)the boy born in one of the three higher classes undergoes a rite of passage(sam.ska ̄ra, often translated as “sacrament”) called upanayana. This ritual is con-ceived as a second birth, as a result of which the boy is invested with the sacredthread (yqjñopavı ̄ta), and becomes a brahmaca ̄rin. The main dharma of the brah-maca ̄rin is to move in with and study the sacred texts under the guidance of ateacher (guru), to serve his guru, and to observe strict celibacy (brahmacarya).Unless he decides to spend his entire life as a permanent (nais.t.hika)brahmaca ̄rin,at the end of the first life stage, the length of which depends on his varn.a, anotherrite of passage, consisting in a ritual bath (sama ̄vartana), makes the young manasna ̄taka. This prepares him for marriage and the second stage of life, that of agr.hastha“householder.” The gr.hasthaestablishes and sustains a family, includingthe primary duty of fathering a son who will perform the necessary funeral rites(s ́ra ̄ddha) after his father’s death. After the second life stage the Hindu may enter the third a ̄s ́rama, retire from active life, and become a vanaprastha “forestdweller,” eventually to enter the fourth stage, that of a sam.nya ̄sin“renouncer.”Note that, for women, there is only one single rite of passage, their wedding.The treatises on dharma recognize but do not elaborate in detail on otherdharmas that are not applicable to all, but to specific groups of Hindus only. They provide some examples ofdharmas followed by “the Northerners” or “theSoutherners.” They also refer to regional dharmas (des ́adharma), “caste” dharmas(ja ̄tidharma), even to family/clan dharmas (kuladharma), as well as to dharmasrestricted to members of guilds (s ́ren.idharma) and dharmas that are observed inthe army. In other words, forms of behavior (a ̄ca ̄ra) that are recognized as properfor the members of these groups are dharma, even if they are not described in oreven if they are incompatible with the rules codified in the dharmas ́a ̄stras.Another important aspect of the texts on dharma is that they recognize specialcircumstances, emergencies (a ̄pad), in which the strict rules they lay down in thethe dharmas ́a ̄stras103"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"texts are suspended. In such cases a ̄paddharma applies: the Brahman is allowedto pursue a military career, the Ks.atriya may practice the life style normallyreserved for the Vais ́ya, etc.It cannot be stressed enough that, except for the rules that apply to one andall, in Hinduism dharma is different for different individuals and under differentcircumstances. What is dharma for one individual may constitute a breach ofdharma (adharma) for others; what is adharma under certain circumstances maybedharma in other situations.TheDharmasu ̄trasThe term dharmas ́a ̄stra is used with two different meanings. It either encom-passes both the dharmas ́a ̄stras and the dharmasu ̄tras, i.e. the entire smr.ti, or it isrestricted to the dharmas ́a ̄stras in a narrower sense (see below). Although occa-sionally mixed with verse, the dharmasu ̄tras are in prose. By definition, a su ̄tra isa brief, aphoristic statement, in which not a single word or syllable is meaning-less.Su ̄tras are meant to be learned by heart first, only later to be explained bymeans of an oral or written commentary. Typical examples of works written insu ̄tra style are Pa ̄n.ini’s grammatical treatise (the As.t.a ̄dhya ̄yı ̄), Va ̄tsya ̄yana’sKa ̄masu ̄tra, the basic texts of the six systems of Hindu philosophy (dars ́anas), etc.Note that the meaning of the Sanskrit term su ̄tra in this context is different fromthat of the Pa ̄li term suttain the Buddhist texts.Thedharmasu ̄tras are only a part of a much vaster literature. They are sub-sumed under the broader category ofkalpasu ̄tras, together with three other kindsofsu ̄tras. First, the s ́rautasu ̄tras, which describe major rituals requiring an elab-orate “altar” (vedi), three sacrificial fires, and the participation of several classesof priests; the dharmasu ̄tras are often appendages of the s ́rautasu ̄tras. Second, thegr.hyasu ̄tras, which deal with minor domestic rituals performed on the perpetualhouse fire, requiring the service of only a single priest, and the contents of whichpartly overlap with those of the dharmasu ̄tras. Third, the s ́ulbasu ̄tras which teachhow properly to construct vedic altars by means of bricks of different geometri-cal forms, and which contain the earliest Indian statements on mathematics.One important feature of the kalpasu ̄tras, and hence of the dharmasu ̄tras,isthat they are an integral, though relatively late, part of the Veda. The kalpasu ̄trasare one of the six veda ̄n.gas“(subsidiary) members of the Vedas.” Each of the fourVedas, R.gveda,Yajurveda,Sa ̄maveda, and Atharvaveda, more correctly, each of theseveral “branches” (s ́a ̄kha ̄) of the four Vedas, is supposed to have had a kalpasu ̄traincluding a dharmasu ̄tra, but not all of these texts have been preserved (Renou1947). In reality, the connection of some dharmasu ̄tras with the vedic schools isat best a loose one. Yet, the fact that the dharmasu ̄tras are at least theoretically apart of vedic literature entails that they are considered to be revealed texts trans-mitted to humans by ancient sages (r.s.i). The authority of these texts is onlyslightly lower than that of the older sam.hita ̄sandbra ̄hman.as: the latter are s ́ruti104ludo rocher"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"“hearing,” the dharmasu ̄tras aresmr.ti“recollection.” Some of the dharmasu ̄trasstart with the phrase: “the source ofdharma is the Veda.” The fact that not allrules on dharma can be found in the Vedas was accounted for by means of avariety of fictions, resulting in the belief either that the r.s.iswho were privilegedto “see” the Veda did notsee it in its entirety, or that parts of the Veda are lost tous. And, even though the dharmas ́a ̄stras make it clear that in case of conflictbetween the s ́ruti and the smr.ti, the former prevails, the smr.ti, occasionallysupplemented by the behavior (a ̄ca ̄ra) agreed on by those who know the Veda, isconsidered to be a source ofdharma which is “eternal” (sana ̄tana):thesana ̄tana-dharma has been revealed once, perfectly, for all time to come.Few dharmasu ̄tras have been preserved. Four of them were translated withextensive introductions and notes, more than a century ago, by Georg Bühler,in volumes II (A ̄pastamba and Gautama) and XIV (Vasis.t.ha and Baudha ̄yana)of F. Max Müller’s Sacred Books of the East series. Recently, Oxford UniversityPress published a new translation of the four su ̄tra texts (Olivelle 1999; the trans-lation of each dharmasu ̄tra is preceded by a detailed survey of its contents).Even though the r.s.iGautama is traditionally connected with the Sa ̄maveda,theGautamadharmasu ̄tra is not part of any known kalpasu ̄tra. It may not have been the first dharmasu ̄tra since it refers to earlier a ̄ca ̄ryas“teachers,” but there seems to be general, though not absolute, agreement that the Gautamadharmasu ̄tra is older than any of the other preserved dharmasu ̄tras tonone of which it alludes. Differently from the other dharmasu ̄tras, it is entirely inprose, without inserting any verses either as part of the text or in the form ofquotations from earlier sources. It is divided into 28 adhya ̄yas(“chapters”), eithernumbered throughout from 1 to 28, or numbered separately within threepras ́nas(“questions”) containing 9, 9, and 10 adhya ̄yasrespectively. Hence a ref-erence to a particular Gautama su ̄tra may consist of either two or three digits:10.1=2.1.1; 19.1 =3.1.1.Some scholars consider not the Gautamadharmasu ̄tra but the A ̄pastambadhar-masu ̄tra to be the oldest preserved dharmasu ̄tra. In this case the dharmasu ̄tra is anintegral part (chapters 28–9; chapter 27 contains the gr.hyasu ̄tra, chapter 30 thes ́ulbasu ̄tra) of the s ́rautasu ̄tra of the A ̄pastamba school of the Taittirı ̄yabranch ofthe Black (kr.s.n.a)Yajurveda. The text is subdivided into two pras ́nas, each of whichcontains 11 pat.alas(“baskets”); concurrently with the pat.alasthe first pras ́nacomprises 32, and the second pras ́na29khan.das(“sections”). A reference to anA ̄pastambasu ̄tra contains four digits, e.g. 1 (pras ́na), 11 (pat.ala), 32 (khan.d.a), 1(su ̄tra); some omit the reference to the pat.ala,sothat 1.11.32.1 may appear as1.32.1. As far as the subject matter is concerned, the A ̄pastambadharmasu ̄tra isfar better organized than the other dharmasu ̄tras. After a brief introduction onthe sources ofdharma and on the four social classes, the first pras ́nadeals withthe duties of a brahmaca ̄rin, up to the ritual bath at the conclusion of his stu-dentship. The second pras ́na is primarily devoted to the gr.hastha, and, as such,includes passages on marriage, on sons (and inheritance), and on ritual for thedead (s ́ra ̄ddha). It ends with a description of the king as the protector of hissubjects, the collector of taxes, and the head of the judicial system.the dharmas ́a ̄stras105"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"In connection with the A ̄pastambadharmasu ̄tra reference must be made to theHiran.yakes ́idharmasu ̄tra, which can hardly be considered a dharmasu ̄tra in its ownright. It does belong to the preserved Hiran.yakes ́ikalpasu ̄tra of the Taittı ̄ryyabranch of the Black Yajurveda, but it nearly literally corresponds to, i.e. borrows from, the A ̄pastambadharmasu ̄tra. Bühler has listed a number of variantreadings in an appendix to his edition of the A ̄pastambadharmasu ̄tra (3rd ed.,1932: 197–212); for a more general comparison of both texts see Kane (1968:91–4).Even as, but far less clearly defined than, the A ̄pastamba-dharmasu ̄tra, theBaudha ̄yanadharmasu ̄tra too, forms the final part of a kalpasu ̄tra belonging to theBlackYajurveda, which, however, has been the object of additions throughout.In the preserved text of the Baudha ̄yanakalpasu ̄tra thedharmasu ̄tra occupiespras ́nas35 to 38, preceded by the s ́rautasu ̄tra and other ritual texts (pras ́nasI to29), the s ́ulbasu ̄tra (pras ́na30), and the gr.hyasu ̄tra (pras ́nas31 to 34). There isgeneral agreement that only the first two pras ́nas(35–6), out of four, belong tothe original dharmasu ̄tra. The first two pras ́nasare divided into concurrentadhya ̄yasandkan.d.ika ̄s(“sections”): 11 and 22 in the first, 10 and 18 (17 and18, on renunciation, seem to have been added from an extraneous source) in thesecond. The last two pras ́nasare divided into adhya ̄yasonly, 10 in the third, 8 inthe fourth. References to the Baudha ̄yanadharmasu ̄tra may, therefore, appear con-fusing: four digits (of which the second is often omitted) for the first two pras ́nas,three only for the third and the fourth.Even though the name of the Sage Vasis.t.ha (also Vas ́is.t.ha) is traditionallyassociated with the R.gveda, the Vasis.t.ha-(orVa ̄sis.t.hadharmasu ̄tra, like the Gautamadharmasu ̄tra, does not belong to any vedic school. Also like Gautama, it is divided only into adhya ̄yas, here numbered throughout from one to thirty.Paucity of manuscripts (cf. Alois Anton Führer’s editions 1883, 1914, and1930) and absence of written commentary (except for a mid-nineteenth-century one by K ̈r.s.n.apan.d.ita; an earlier one, by Yajñasva ̄min, is lost) have leftthe text of the Vasis.t.hadharmasu ̄tra highly corrupt.In addition to the four (or five, including Hiran.yakes ́i) major dharmasu ̄tras,atext variously called Vaikha ̄nasadharmapras ́naorVaikha ̄nasasma ̄rtasu ̄tra (editedand translated by Willem Caland in the Bibliotheca Indica series, works 242 and 251, 1927, 1929) qualifies both as a gr.hyasu ̄tra (pras ́nasI to 7) and as adharmasu ̄tra (pras ́nas8 to 10). Even though the name vaikha ̄nasaappears in thedharmasu ̄tras of Gautama, Baudha ̄yana, and Vasis.t.ha, and even though theManusmr.ti(6.21) seems to allude to a Vaikha ̄nasa treatise, the text in its presentform is more recent, with a strong leaning toward Vais.n.avism (see Colas in thisvolume).Among the many lost dharmasu ̄tras from which extracts have been preservedin later texts, the Ha ̄rı ̄tadharmasu ̄tra (Jolly 1928: 505–24, on law only) is one ofthe more prominent ones. The topics ofdharma dealt with in these fragments,in prose and in verse, are so varied that Kane (1968: 133) suggested that theHa ̄rı ̄tadharmasu ̄tra may have been one of the most extensive dharmasu ̄tras.

Fragments of a Pa i t.hı ̄nasidharmasu ̄tra were collected and edited by T. R.Cintamani (1939). Fragments of several other lost dharmasu ̄tras are discussed byKane (1968: 261–9).TheDharmas ́a ̄strasDifferently from the dharmasu ̄tras, the dharmas ́a ̄stras (in the narrow sense of theword, see above) are entirely in verse. They are composed nearly exclusively inthe same anus.t.ubhors ́lokameter (4 times 8 syllables to the stanza) that is famil-iar from the epics (Maha ̄bha ̄rata andRa ̄ma ̄yana), from the Pura ̄n.as, and fromother types ofs ́a ̄straliterature. The dharmas ́a ̄stras deal with the same subjectmatter as the dharmasu ̄tras, and, even though they are held to be more recentand no longer attached to specific vedic schools, they too are part of the revealedand eternally valid smr.ti. Even as the dharmasu ̄tras, the dharmas ́a ̄stras are attrib-uted to ancient Sages.Few versified dharmas ́a ̄stras have been preserved in their entirety; they areattributed to Manu, Ya ̄jñavalkya, Na ̄rada, and Para ̄s ́ara.Traditionally the Manusmr.tiorMa ̄navadharmas ́a ̄stra is recognized as theoldest and most important of all versified dharmasu ̄tras. The theory that it wasbased on an older and lost Ma ̄navadharmasu ̄tra – even Gautama refers to Manu– has no longer any followers. It was the first dharmas ́a ̄stra to become known inEurope, in William Jones’s English translation (London 1794). It has been trans-lated several times since then, most authoritatively, with an elaborate introduc-tion and abundant references to the commentaries, by Bühler, in volume XXVof the Sacred Books of the East (1886), and most recently by Wendy Doniger andBrian K. Smith, in the Penguin Books series (1991). The Manusmr.tiis dividedinto 12 chapters (adhya ̄yas), ranging from 97 (chapter 6) to 420 (chapter 8)verses. One of the most enduring features of the Manusmr.ti, throughout thelater dharmas ́a ̄stras, the commentarial literature, into modern times, has beenits subdivision of substantive law into 18 – an important number in Hinduism,Buddhism, and Jainism – viva ̄dapadas “heads/titles of litigation.”TheYa j n.avalkyasmr.tilargely deals with the same subject matter as theManusmr.ti, but in a more systematic way. The text is divided into three chapters,ona ̄ca ̄ra (proper behavior; 367/368 verses), vyavaha ̄ra (law; 307 verses), andpra ̄yas ́citta(penance; 334/335 verses). There is no complete translation of theYa j n.avalkyasmr.tiinto English, even though Adolf Friedrich Stenzler edited andtranslated the text into German as early as 1849. There is general agreementthat the Ya j n.avalkyasmr.tiis more recent than the Manusmr.ti.

A shorter text was trans-lated by Jolly from an unpublished Sanskrit source (London, 1876). A longer onewas edited, with Asaha ̄ya’s partly preserved commentary, in the BibliothecaIndicaseries (work 102) in 1885, and translated in volume XXXIII of the SacredBooks of the East in 1889, both by Jolly. A third text was published (1929) underthe title Na ̄radiyamanusam.hita ̄, the readings of which are largely corroborated bythose attested in manuscripts written in Newa ̄rı ̄ script found in Nepal. Jolly’slonger recension has received most scholarly attention and has most often beenreferred to as the Na ̄radasmr.ti. Yet, in a new edition and translation (Philadelphia1989) Richard Lariviere has shown that many verses included in Jolly’s editionand translation are not part of the Na ̄radasmr.ti, but of Asaha ̄ya’s commentary,and that the Na ̄radı ̄yamanusam.hita ̄Newa ̄rı ̄ recension may well represent theoriginal text. Na ̄rada is the only dharmas ́a ̄stra that is totally and exclusivelydevoted to one single aspect ofdharma, “law.” After an introductory section(ma ̄tr.ka ̄) on legal procedure, the text proceeds systematically through the 18heads of litigation, more or less in the order in which Manu established them.TheNa ̄radasmr.tibecame known for its detailed treatment of ordeals (divya) to beused as one of the types of admissible evidence in courts of law. The fact thatManu knows two forms of ordeal, Ya ̄jñavalkya five, and Na ̄rada nine, has oftenbeen used as an argument to consider the Na ̄radasmr.timore recent than theManusmr.tiand the Ya ̄jñavalkyasmr.ti. In view of Lariviere’s conclusions someforms of ordeal may, however, have been added by the commentator Asaha ̄ya.In that case, Na ̄rada may antedate Ya ̄jñavalkya. The Na ̄radasmr.tiimpressedcomparative legal historians, to the point of unnecessarily assuming contactwith or influence from Roman law.Less well known and less widely read than the dharmas ́a ̄stras attributed toManu, Ya ̄jñavalkya, and Na ̄rada, the Pa ra ̄s ́arasmr.ti, edited, with the extensivegloss (vya ̄khya ̄)by Ma ̄dhava ̄ca ̄rya, in the Bombay Sanskrit Series (1893–1911)and in the Bibliotheca Indica series (work 94, 1890–9), deals with a ̄ca ̄ra andpra ̄yas ́cittaonly. The commentator Ma ̄dhava does introduce an importantsection on vyavaha ̄ra, but only on the occasion of Para ̄s ́ara’s brief reference tothedharma of the ks.atriyas. Even though Ya ̄jñavalkya (1.4–5) includes Para ̄s ́arain a long list of composers ofdharmas ́a ̄stras, the preserved Pa ra ̄s ́arasmr.timust befar more recent. The text specifically claims to be a dharmas ́a ̄stra for the kaliyuga,the last and worst of the four world ages within the current cycle, in which welive at the present moment. Among the practices for which it is known to deviatefrom those prescribed in other dharmas ́a ̄stras is a brief eulogy ofsatı ̄, “widowburning.”Subsequent to the four preserved dharmas ́a ̄stras reference must be made to atext on dharma that has created more problems of categorization and interpre-tation than most. It is variously called Vis.n.udharmasu ̄tra,Vis.n.udharmas ́a ̄stra,or,with the neutral term, Vis.n.usmr.ti. The text was edited and translated by Jolly intheBibliotheca Indica series (work 91) in 1881, and in volume VII of the Sacred108ludo rocher"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Books of the East (1880), respectively. The Vis.n.usmr.tiiis divided into 100 chap-ters (adhya ̄ya) of very uneven length: 5 (chapters 34, 39, 40, 42, 76) with justonesu ̄tra and one verse, one with 101 su ̄tras followed by one verse (chapter 98).The body of the text is in prose, but, with one exception (chapter 74), all chap-ters end in verses, from a single s ́lokato 32 (chapter 20, after 21 su ̄tras). The firstand the last two chapters are entirely in verse. The conclusion is that there mayhave been an early Vis.n.udharmasu ̄tra, entirely in prose, which to some degreebelonged to the Ka ̄t.hakabranch of the Black Yajurveda. At a later time verses wereadded to the core, many of them equivalent to and probably borrowed fromManu (160 verses are identical), Ya ̄jñavalkya, Na ̄rada, the Bhagavadgita ̄, andother sources. Finally, the initial and the last two chapters made the text into aVa i s.n.ava work, thereby creating the single dharmas ́a ̄stra text in which it is Vis.n.uwho, in his boar (vara ̄ha) incarnation, proclaimed dharma to the goddess Earthat the time when the world was recreated after one of the recurring cosmicdestructions (pralaya).Even as some of the dharmasu ̄trasare preserved only in fragments, severaldharmas ́a ̄stras too, are known only from more or less abundant quotations inlater works. From the collections of these fragments edited by modern scholarsit is obvious that some of these lost dharmas ́a ̄stras were extensive and important.This is especially true of the Br.haspatismr.ti, from which Jolly translated a col-lection of verses on legal procedure and substantive law (vyavaha ̄ra) in volumeXXXIII of the Sacred Books of the East (1889). K. V. Rangaswarni Aiyangar(Baroda, 1941) not only edited a far larger collection of fragments on legalissues; he also added extracts dealing with sam.ska ̄ra (648 verses and two prosepassages), a ̄ca ̄ra (101 verses), s ́ra ̄ddha (155 verses), as ́auca(ritual impurity, 78verses), a ̄paddharma (53 verses), and pra ̄yas ́citta(90 verses).Of the equally important Ka ̄tya ̄uanasmr.tiwe so far have only 973 verses onlegal procedure and substantive law that were collected and translated by Kane(Poona, 1933), to which 121 more were added by K. V. Rangaswami Aiyangar(Festschrift Kane, Poona, 1941: 7–17).Further, 268 verses on law and legal procedure, attributed to the Sage Vya ̄sa,have been collected by B. K. Ghosh (Indian Culture 9, 1942, 65–98). Recently, M. L. Wadekar edited 2,475 verses on a ̄ca ̄ra,vyavaha ̄ra, and pra ̄yas ́citta(plus81verses on jyotis.a) from the lost Devalasmr.ti(Delhi, 1996–7, 2 vols.).A collection of 19 dharmas ́a ̄stras, many of them attributed to Sages mentionedearlier (often preceded by adjectives such as B ̈r.had-“major,” Laghu- “minor,”Vr.ddha- “senior”) but probably of more recent origin, were published under the title Dharmas ́a ̄strasam.grahah.by Jivananda Vidyasagara (Calcutta, 1876).Twenty-seven similar texts, titled Smr.tina ̄m.samuccayah., were printed in volume48 of the A ̄nanda ̄s ́rama Sanskrit Series (Poona, 1905), and 20 were edited andtranslated under the title The Dharmas ́a ̄stra by M. N. Dutt (Calcutta, 1906–8).Gustav Herberich (Würzburg, 1893) edited and translated 103 verses ascribed,not always consistently, to Vr.ddhamanu or Br.hanmanu.At this stage it is necessary also to refer to extensive passages dealing withvarious topics ofdharma that are found in numerous passages of the two Indianthe dharmas ́a ̄stras109"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"epics, the Ra ̄ma ̄yanaand, even more so, the Maha ̄bha ̄rata (Kane 1968: 349–408),as well as in several Pura ̄n.as(Kane 1968: 408–21 and Rocher 1986: 37–8 andpassim). In fact, verses from the Maha ̄bha ̄rata and entire sections from a numberofPura ̄n.ascorrespond nearly literally with passages from the dharmas ́a ̄stras. Inaddition, even though Kautilya’s Arthas ́a ̄stra is primarily devoted to the study ofpolicy and statecraft (artha), it too comprises sections dealing with topics relatedtodharma (Kane 1968: 149–256).DatingDating most classical Indian texts remains a difficult task, and the dharmasu ̄trasanddharmas ́a ̄stras are no exception. Dating in absolute terms is possible only tothe extent to which there is agreement on the relative dates of the several texts.If the Manusmr.tiis indeed the oldest versified dharmas ́a ̄stra and if we accept, withthe majority of scholars, that it was composed between 200 bceand 200 ce(thetime when the Maha ̄bha ̄rata was about to reach its final form), then all dhar-masu ̄tras are older than 200 bce, and all dharmas ́a ̄stras other than Manu’s aremore recent than 200 ce. Even repeated and detailed comparison, based oninternal criteria, did not always lead to identical conclusions. Yet, it is more orless established that, of the preserved dharmasu ̄tras, Gautama or, according tosome, A ̄pastamba is the oldest, followed by Baudha ̄yana and Vasis.t.ha. How farback these texts go prior to the time of Manu is less certain, at most as far as 500bce, and possibly less. Among the dharmas ́a ̄stras Manu was probably followed byYa ̄jñavalkya, Na ̄rada (unless the original Na ̄rada is earlier than Ya ̄jñavalkya),Br.haspati, and Ka ̄tya ̄yana. The Vis.n.udharmasu ̄tra may be very old, but the textas it has been preserved, both in prose and in verse, may be dated between 400and 600 ce. The period of the principal dharmasu ̄tras anddhamas ́a ̄stras may,therefore, be tentatively fixed between the limits of 500 bceand 500 ce.TheDharmas ́a ̄strasin the Commentarial LiteratureThedharmasu ̄tras anddharmas ́a ̄stras constitute a vast and, even more so, acomplex body of literature. First, not only are the su ̄tras brief and aphoristic asmentioned earlier; they are often cryptic and they easily lend themselves to verydifferent interpretations. Even the verses of the more verbose dharmas ́a ̄stras arenot always as clear as one would wish normative texts to be; some of the mostcrucial s ́lokascan be interpreted in very different ways. Second, it is not surpris-ing that texts composed over a period of about one millennium, in distant partsof the subcontinent, exhibit injunctions that are not only different, but evenincompatible.110ludo rocher"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Such, however, is not the traditional view. For the Hindu the dharma asrevealed by the Sages is perfect. There are neither uncertainties nor contradic-tions in the dharmasu ̄tras and the dharmas ́a ̄stras. If texts appear unclear or con-tradictory, it is because humans fail properly to understand their meanings.Hence arose, probably from around 700 ce, if not earlier, a vast commentarialliterature, which continued well into the eighteenth century. For reasons whichwill become clear later in this essay, a number of the more recent commentarieswere composed at the instance of the British rulers, most prominent amongthem the Viva ̄da ̄rn.avasetu “Bridge across the ocean of litigation” (Bombay, 1888),a text composed by a group of 11 pandits in Calcutta, better known, in NathanielBrassey Halhed’s English rendition of a Persian translation, as A Code of GentooLaws (London, 1776), and Jagannla ̄tha Tarkapañca ̄nana’s as yet unpublishedViva ̄dabhan.ga ̄rnava “Ocean of solutions of litigation,” which, in Henry ThomasColebrooke’s translation, became known as A Digest of Hindu Law (Calcutta,1797).The commentaries on the dharmasu ̄tras anddharmas ́a ̄stras are of two kinds.Some are commentaries stricto sensu (calledt.ı ̄ka,bha ̄s.ya,vr.tti, etc.). Theycomment on one particular dharmasu ̄tra ordharmas ́a ̄stra text from beginning toend,su ̄tra aftersu ̄tra, or verse after verse. So far we have two commentaries onGautama, one on A ̄pastamba, one on Baudha ̄yana, eight on Manu (the recentlydiscovered commentary by Bha ̄ruci may be one of the earliest texts of thisgenre), five on Ya ̄jñavalkya (one of them, Vijn.a ̄nes ́vara’s Mita ̄ks.ara ̄was to play aprominent role under British rule; it has its own two super commentaries), oneon each version of Na ̄rada, and one on Vis.n.u.Few commentators, even on one particular dharmasu ̄tra ordharmas ́a ̄stra, limitthemselves to a mere word by word interpretation of the text. To prove their pointthe more learned among them also introduce into their discussions quotationsfrom other dharmasu ̄tras anddharmas ́a ̄stras, and their works come close to thesecond type of commentaries, the nibandhas.Nibandhas“compendia, digests” donot comment on any particular dharmasu ̄tra ordharmas ́a ̄stra. The authors of these texts rather bring together extracts from various dharmasu ̄tras anddharmas ́a ̄stras on one particular aspect ofdharma, and harmonize the apparentcontradictions into one coherent system of their own, most often with very dif-ferent results. It is from these learned commentaries and nibandhasthat schol-ars have been able to gather fragments ofdharmasu ̄tras anddharmas ́a ̄stra thatare otherwise lost.Some of the nibandhasare voluminous; they are veritable encyclopedias ofHindudharma. Under one general title they comprise several book-length texts,each of them with their own sub-titles, on every imaginable branch ofdharma.Laks.mı ̄dhara’s Kr.tyakalpataru (twelfth century), for example, consists of 14ka ̄n.d.as, Mitramis ́ra’s Vı ̄ramitrodaya (seventeenth century) contains 10 praka ̄s ́as,and Raghunandana’s Smr.titattva (sixteenth century) is divided into 28 tattvas.Most important in this essay on the dharmasu ̄tras anddharmas ́a ̄stra is the factthat the commentators do not hesitate to impose interpretations of their own onthe ancient texts, in order to make all of them fit harmoniously within coherentthe dharmas ́a ̄stras111"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"systems. To achieve that goal the authors have recourse to a vast array of tra-ditionally recognized exegetical principles, which can only be briefly illustratedhere. When two smr.titexts are contradictory, it is possible to invoke for one ofthem the concept ofkalivarjya “a practice to be avoided in the kaliyuga.” Thus,when Manu first recognizes levirate as a valid form of marriage (9.59) and,immediately thereafter, rejects it as being dharma fit for cattle (9.65–6), the com-mentators avoid the contradiction by arguing that levirate marriage was allowedin earlier world eras, but that it should not be practiced in the wretched kaliyuga.The texts often compare dharma with a cow, which in the kr.ta-orsatyayugastands on four feet, on three feet in the treta ̄yuga, on two in the dva ̄parayuga, andon one foot in the kaliyuga. Or, when a smr.titext includes a number of items ina list, the commentator is at liberty to interpret the list either as comprehensiveor as merely illustrative. Thus, when Gautama (10.39 =2.1.39) enumerates fiveways of acquiring property (inheritance, purchase, partition, seizure, and dis-covery), commentators who, for reasons of their own, wish to recognize the factof being born as a means of acquiring a right of ownership in the joint familyproperty, argue that Gautama’s list is illustrative. Others, who claim that thehead of the family is the sole owner of the entire joint family property, in theirturn argue that Gautama’s list ought to be taken literally. The often intricatearguments which the commentators proffer in defense of their interpretation ofthesmr.titexts – not unlike other branches of Sanskrit commentarial literature,the commentaries and nibandhason the dharmas ́a ̄stras often take the form of dia-logues between named or unnamed opponents and the authors – are groundedin their vast knowledge of other scholarly disciplines, including the differentsystems of Sanskrit grammar, the principles of textual exegesis elaborated in theMı ̄ma ̄m.sa ̄su ̄trasand their commentaries, the rules of logic (nya ̄ya), etc. (For adetailed analysis of the various devices used by the commentators to interpretthedharmas ́a ̄stras, see Lingat 1973: 143–75.)TheDharmas ́a ̄strasin Modern TimesIn 1772, in an effort to prevent Indians being subjected to English law, whichwas totally foreign to them, the Governor (later Governor-General) of Bengal,Warren Hastings, encouraged a decree to the effect that “in matters of inheri-tance, marriage and other religious matters, the Gentoos shall be governed bythe laws of the Shaster, the Muhammadans by the law of the Koran.” In otherwords, from 1772 onward “the Shaster,” i.e. the ancient dharmas ́a ̄stras– rather,the entire, undefined body of Sanskrit dharmas ́a ̄stra literature – were elevated enbloc to the rank of law books to be used by the Anglo-Indian courts of law todecide civil and religious disputes among Hindus.Many British servants of the East India Company were familiar with Persianor even Arabic, and applying the law of the Koran to Indian Muslims was notexpected to present major problems. Sanskrit, on the other hand, was totally112ludo rocher"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"unknown. As a result, administering the “law” of the dharmas ́a ̄stras to Hindusled to interesting developments in the understanding and interpretation of theancient, revealed Sanskrit texts. This essay cannot go into detail on the earlyexperiments that were resorted to to obviate the problem: attaching to the courtsof law one or more pandits, who were able to consult the Sanskrit texts andadvise the judges; trying to gain access to the Sanskrit texts in English via theintermediary of translations into Persian (e.g., the Code of Gentoo Laws men-tioned earlier), etc. These experiments may have made legal proceedings cum-bersome and not always reliable, but they had little impact on the dharmas ́a ̄strasthemselves. It must be mentioned, though, that it was the need to understandthe legal sections of the dharmas ́a ̄stras in the original, that became the first and primary incentive for British judges in India to embark on the study of theSanskrit language. Some of the letters by Sir William Jones, a judge in theCalcutta Supreme Court, make it abundantly clear that his Institutes of HinduLaw; or the Ordinances of Menu. . . Comprising the Indian System of Duties Religiousand Civil (Calcutta, 1794), was a natural and pragmatic reaction to his distrustin court pandits and second-hand translations.Other developments did have an impact on the understanding and practicalapplication of the ancient dharmas ́a ̄stras. First, “law” and “religion,” which wereinextricably linked in the smr.titexts, were artificially separated. Thus, in thesmr.titexts one of the requirements for an adoption to be valid is a ritual calleddattahoma. With the “religious” aspect of adoption, as with any other aspect ofthe Hindu religion, the Courts explicitly refused to interfere: if the dattahomawasperformed as a part of an adoption, the parties were free to do so. But, the taskof the Courts was to administer “law,” and they declared adoptions valid withoutthe performance ofdattahomas. Or, the dharmas ́a ̄stras prohibit the adoption of anonly son, because such an act was bound to deprive the son’s natural father ofthe ideal person to perform the required s ́ra ̄ddha rituals after his death. TheAnglo-Indian courts of law overlooked this “religious” aspect of adoption, anddeclared the adoption of an only son valid. Second, as mentioned earlier, one ofthe characteristic traits of the commentaries and nibandhaswas that they inter-preted the apparently contradictory statements in the ancient texts so as to inte-grate them into coherent systems. These coherent systems of the commentariesandnibandhaswere more appealing to the courts than the often unclear and con-tradictory texts of the su ̄tras ands ́a ̄stras. As a result, the courts decided it wasnot their duty to investigate the correct meaning of the ancient texts themselves,but to apply them only as they had been interpreted by the commentators. Inother words, the meaning of the ancient, revealed texts was made subordinateto the interpretations they received at the hands of human commentators. Thus,the distinction between those who did not recognize birth as a means to acquirea right of ownership in the joint family property and those who did (see above),led to the creation of the two major “Schools of Hindu law,” the Da ̄yabha ̄gaschool for Bengal and the Mita ̄ks.ara ̄school for the rest of India. And the Courtswent one step further. While still claiming to base their judgments on theSanskrit texts, be it the human commentaries rather than the revealed s ́a ̄stras,the dharmas ́a ̄stras113"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"in reality the courts made even the Sanskrit commentaries subordinate to theBritish Common Law concept of legal precedent. The Manusmr.tiand otherdharmas ́a ̄stras were referred to in every judgment, but via the commentaries, andthe commentaries were quoted indirectly via earlier decisions. Even when amember of the Court or the attorney for a party convincingly demonstrated thata text from a dharmas ́a ̄stra or commentary had been wrongly interpreted inearlier cases, the Court invoked Latin maxims such as stare decisis orcommuniserror facit ius to overrule the proper meaning of the Sanskrit text. Finally, therewere aspects of the dharmas ́a ̄stras, such as their inferior treatment of women andmembers of lower castes, which the British rulers considered objectionable.Their decisions, based on the principles of justice, equity, and good conscience,as well as a number of Acts, starting with the Caste Disabilities Removal Act(1850) and the Women’s Right to Property Act (1856), slowly but graduallyrestricted the range of the issues on which Hindus continued to be governed bythe law of the “shaster.”The legal system as elaborated in the colonial period was applied unchangedin the courts of law of Independent India. That is, until 1955–6, when theIndian Parliament passed four modern Acts (on marriage, inheritance, minor-ity and guardianship, and adoptions and maintenance), and thereby, in Derrett’swords, wrote “the epitaph for the Rishis” (subtitle ofThe Death of a Marriage Law,Delhi, 1978). Yet, even today, in all matters that are not covered by the four Acts,thedharmas ́a ̄stras and the commentaries and nibandhascontinue to be quotedand debated in the courts of law throughout India.EpilogueI have saved ’till the end a question that has been raised primarily for the dhar-masu ̄tras anddharmas ́a ̄stra as law books, but that equally applies to any otheraspect ofdharma dealt with in these texts. The question is whether the composersof the dharmasu ̄tras anddharmas ́a ̄stras actually laid down rules that were andthat they expected to be applied in daily life, or whether the texts merely presenta picture of how their Brahman composers envisaged dharma in an ideal world.Answers to this question by modern scholars, both Indian and non-Indian, varywidely, from absolute trust in to total denial of the applicability of the texts inreal life. Hastings and the early British translators of the dharmas ́a ̄stras were con-fident enough to build an entire modern legal system on the ancient texts. In F.Max Müller’s opinion, even for those not involved in Indian administration “theyare of great importance for forming a correct view of the old state of society in India” (1859: 134). P. V. Kane’s multi-volume work on the History ofDharmas ́a ̄stra, Jolly’s, Lingat’s, and Derrett’s general surveys ofdharmas ́a ̄straliterature, and numerous volumes and articles on specific aspects ofsmr.ti, areall based on the tacit assumption that the texts provide a true picture of life in ancient India. Yet, others were less convinced, to the point of calling the114ludo rocher"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"dharmas ́a ̄stras nothing more than “a pious wish of its metaphysically-minded,ceremonial ridden priestly promulgators, and but seldom a stern reality” (Das1914: 8). It is possible, though, to find a middle ground between the two extremepositions. Most, if not all, the injunctions or prohibitions contained in the severalsu ̄tras ands ́lokasmay reflect real situations, real customs and practices. Evenwhen texts appear contradictory, they represent the different kinds ofdharmathat were observed within certain groups of individuals, regional, social, pro-fessional, etc. Some of the injunctions and prohibitions contained in the textswere dharma for the members of specific groups only, but all these rules neededto be incorporated in the overarching, authoritative, and prescriptive texts onthe subject ofdharma. None of the groups concerned may have known thedharmas ́a ̄stras as they were eventually written down and transmitted in manu-script form. They may have been ignorant of the dharma of other groups, but theyperfectly knew the specific rules, transmitted orally from father to son, or fromteacher to disciple, which they themselves were supposed to live by (Rocher1993).ReferencesDas, Govinda. 1914: The Real Character of Hindu Law.

The two epics are indeed among the largestliterary works in the world: the Maha ̄bha ̄rata, “the great <story/war> ofBharata’s descendants,” traditionally contains 100,000 verses and even the textestablished in the Critical Edition has nearly 75,000, while the other epic, theRa ̄ma ̄yan.a, “the journey/career of Ra ̄ma,” though less than a third as long, still contains almost 20,000 verses. However, these originally orally trans-mitted bardic poems have grown to this immense size over an extended periodof time, from around the fifth century bceto the fourth century ceby the usual reckoning, and in the process have gained substantial additions to theirnarratives and also – particularly in the case of the Maha ̄bha ̄rata– didacticelements, while their basically heroic ethos has been transformed into a reli-gious outlook as a major figure in each came to be identified as an avata ̄ra,“descent,” of Vis.n.u.Originating in the period following that of the Vedic literature and reflectingthe interests and concerns of the ks.atriyaaristocracy, the epics reveal muchabout the process by which the more theistic emphases of classical Hinduismemerged from late Vedic ritualism. Their origins may perhaps be traced to someof the ballads about gods and heroes recited within the overall context of Vedicrituals, but their real growth was owed to the bardic tradition which emerged at the courts ofks.atriyarulers, where stories about the exploits of heroes werenaturally welcomed. The framework stories of both epics present them as oralcompositions and show the importance not only of the bard or reciter, but"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"also of the audience in their transmission, while also setting them within thelargest possible context. For the Maha ̄bha ̄rata, this means that the first 50 or sosections of its first book are concerned with the origins of the world and thenthe ancestry of the epic’s heroes. However, at some point around the middle oftheir main period of growth (possibly the first century ce), each epic was com-mitted to writing and their transmission passed into the hands of the bra ̄hmans,the main custodians by then of traditional values. These two developments maywell be linked and have occurred simultaneously.The basic plot of the Maha ̄bha ̄rata, which is traditionally ascribed to the sageVya ̄sa, “the arranger,” concerns the struggle for control of the Kuru kingdombetween two sets of cousins: the hundred sons of Dhr.tara ̄s.t.ra, usually called theKauravas, and the five sons of Pa ̄n.d.u, the Pa ̄n.d.avas. Both fathers have ruled inturn, so the line of succession to the throne is by no means clear and the rightsof the situation are debatable. This leads eventually to open warfare between thecousins, although this is preceded by various events of which the most signifi-cant is the dicing match in which the oldest Pa ̄n.d.ava, Yudhis.t.hira, first loseseverything to the Kaurava champion and then the five brothers, along with theirwife Draupadı ̄, are exiled to the forest for 12 years, plus a further year to be spentundetected within society. After their return and the continued refusal by the Kauravas to reach an agreement, war becomes inevitable and, as the actual battle is about to begin, the third Pa ̄n.d.ava brother, Arjuna, confides to hisfriend Kr.s.n.a, chief of the Ya ̄davas, his qualms about fighting the opposing sidebecause they are his relatives. This is the setting for Kr.s.n.a’s sermon to him, theBhagavadgı ̄ta ̄, which has become the best known part of the whole epic. Thebattle itself, over 18 days, occupies the middle part of the epic (itself comprising18 books) and is followed by the lamentations of the women, two lengthy booksof advice to Yudhis.t.hira by the dying Bhı ̄s.ma (the senior member of the family),and several shorter books narrating various events up to the end of thePa ̄n.d.avas’ lives.Whereas the Maha ̄bha ̄rata has been regarded by several modern scholars asan exploration of the problems involved in establishing the nature ofdharma andin applying it in particular situations, the Ra ̄ma ̄yan.ais an affirmation of the cen-trality ofdharma to all right endeavour. The Ra ̄ma ̄yan.aascribed to Va ̄lmı ̄ki con-tains the story of prince Ra ̄ma and his adventures when exiled to the forest bythe machinations of his step-mother; when Kaikeyı ̄ abruptly demands his ban-ishment, Ra ̄ma accepts his father Das ́aratha’s reluctant decree with absolutesubmission and with the calm self-control which regularly characterizes him.The narrative thus ranges from accounts of intrigue at Das ́aratha’s court inAyodhya ̄ to wanderings among hermits in the forest, and culminates in the greatbattle for Lan.ka ̄, when Ra ̄vana, the king of the Ra ̄ks.asas, is punished for hisabduction of Ra ̄ma’s wife, Sı ̄ta ̄. In his search for Sı ̄ta ̄, Ra ̄ma is helped by themonkey counselor, Hanuma ̄n, who becomes a much-loved figure as the storydevelops, because of his devotion to Ra ̄ma. The Ra ̄ma ̄yan.athus deals with someof the most basic themes of human existence and constitutes a powerful explo-ration of the concept ofdharma.the sanskrit epics117"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Deity and RitualWithin the narratives of both epics the older pattern of deities and of ritualsbased on sacrifice, leading to heaven (svarga), is more prominent, but the newerpatterns of worship, usually seen as leading to liberation (moks.a), do also occurfrom time to time – and are then more predominant in the didactic parts. Thedeities alluded to or playing any part in the narrative are largely those of the Vedicpantheon. Indra is particularly prominent, both as the leader of the gods and asthe performer of various heroic deeds (in particular the slaying of Vr.tra), amongthe gods mentioned in the Maha ̄bha ̄rata. In the story about the five Pa ̄n.d.avas beingactually fathered by the gods, Indra fathers Arjuna, the finest warrior amongthem. In the Ra ̄ma ̄yan.aRa ̄ma is compared most often with Indra and at theclimax of the whole story, in his duel with Ra ̄vana, he receives the help of Indra’scharioteer, Ma ̄tali. Yama appears quite often in similes and in various boastingsby the warriors of the Maha ̄bha ̄rata, where his role in the older pantheon as theking of the dead makes this natural (a role that is at odds with the later con-cept ofsam.sa ̄ra), and similarly in the Ra ̄ma ̄yan.aa common formulaic expressionrefers to leading or sending warriors to Yama’s abode. The fire-god, Agni, alsoplays quite an appreciable role in the narrative of the Maha ̄bha ̄rata and, in a devel-opment of the basic narrative of the Ra ̄ma ̄yan.a, he returns Sı ̄ta ̄ to Ra ̄ma with herpurity vindicated by her passing through the fire. Even Varun.a still appears as a lingering survival, mainly as the lord of the ocean but also in the notion thatheroes are equal to Indra and Varun.a. In general, the opposition between Devasand Asuras, their contests for supremacy and the myth of the churning of theocean all show a Vedic or immediately post-Vedic pattern. Even in the allusionsor episodes relating to Vis.n.u or S ́iva there are still traces of the older pattern, withVis.n.u, for example, still in some passages subordinate to Indra.The religious activities mentioned within the main narratives also reveal apattern which still reflects the Vedic situation to a large extent, while the actualnarrative of the Maha ̄bha ̄rata is built around the ra ̄jasu ̄ya (in the dicing game andthe other events of the second book) and around other rituals at various points;there are even occasional direct references to Vedic ritual officiants or the ritualitself in the narrative books. On the other hand, some late parts of the narrativeprovide the earliest instances of the practice of pilgrimage to tı ̄rthas, whichbecomes such a feature of later Hinduism, while on occasion more popularbeliefs, such as in omens and portents, are included. In the Ra ̄ma ̄yan.a, the com-monest rituals mentioned are the morning and evening worship, but sacrifice ingeneral, various individual sacrifices and the sacrificial altar are all mentionedoccasionally in the core narrative, although little detail is given. Significantlysam.nya ̄saand related terms for renunciation do not occur within the Ra ̄ma ̄yan.a,whereas it is found occasionally in the Maha ̄bha ̄rata; indeed, the various forestsages who feature in the Ra ̄ma ̄yan.anarrative are clearly hermits (va ̄naprastha),not ascetics (sam.nya ̄sin). Another aspect in which the Ra ̄ma ̄yan.aappears morearchaic is that its earliest parts largely ignore the concept ofsam.sa ̄ra, mention-118john brockington"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"ing instead svarga, “heaven,” while both sam.sa ̄ra andkarma do feature in partsof the Maha ̄bha ̄rata narrative.By the middle of the period of growth of the epics, not only are Vis.n.u and S ́ivabecoming more significant but also the figure of Brahma ̄ becomes important fora time, in the last century or two bceand the first century or so ce. BasicallyBrahma ̄ represents a fusion of the Upanis.adic absolute, Brahman, with theconcept of a creator deity, and so he is credited with some of the cosmogonicmyths told in the later vedic period about Praja ̄pati. He is often called Pita ̄maha,“grandfather,” or Svayam.bhu ̄ , “self-born,” and he is especially linked withBra ̄hmans and ascetics (e.g. Mbh. 1.203). His main attribute is to distributefavours and particularly weapons to those who have pleased him by their asceticpenance, as he does in the Ra ̄ma ̄yan.ato both Ra ̄vana and his son, Indrajit,although he does also on occasion utter curses. However, it is Brahma ̄ who leadsthe gods when they assemble at the end of the main Ra ̄ma ̄yan.anarrative to revealto Ra ̄ma his divinity (Ram. 6.105). There are possible hints of the classicaltrimu ̄rti concept – which links Brahma ̄, Vis.n.u, and S ́iva together ratherarbitrarily – a couple of times in the Maha ̄bha ̄rata (12.328.17 and 13.14.183),but already in the later parts of the epics Vis.n.u and S ́iva have totally eclipsedBrahma ̄, just as the importance of Indra has significantly declined.The complementarity of Vis.n.u and S ́iva in the Maha ̄bha ̄rata is a feature whichhas been highlighted from a structuralist perspective by several scholars(Biardeau, Hiltebeitel, and others). Since both epics eventually become Vais.n.avaworks, the Vais.n.ava aspects come to dominate, but this should not obscure thefact that S ́iva plays an appreciable role in the Maha ̄bha ̄rata narrative: for example,he ordains that Draupadı ̄ shall have five husbands (1.157 and 1.189), Arjunastruggles with the Kira ̄t.a who is S ́iva in disguise (3.38–41), S ́iva goes before Arjuna in the battle killing those whom Arjuna will strike (7.173), andAs ́vattha ̄man invokes S ́iva before the night attack in which he murders theremaining Pa ̄n.d.ava forces (10.7). Not all of these fit the pattern of S ́iva as thedestroyer and Kr.s.n.a as the preserver so often posited (and in broad terms cor-rectly so). Indeed, there are occasional references which link him with birth andfertility: in particular, Ga ̄ndha ̄rı ̄ gained the boon of a hundred sons from him(1.103.9) and Sagara that of many sons (3.104). S ́iva is less often mentioned intheRa ̄ma ̄yan.athan in the Maha ̄bha ̄rata, although he becomes more prominentin the first and last books, which extend the main narrative backwards (to thebirth of Ra ̄ma and his brothers) and forwards (to Ra ̄ma’s righteous rule,ra ̄mara ̄jya, after the victory over Ra ̄vana – whose previous exploits fill the firstpart of the last book – up to his final departure from this world).TheMaha ̄bha ̄rataWithin the narrative of the Maha ̄bha ̄rata,Kr.s.n.a plays a prominent but scarcelycentral role, one which nonetheless is enhanced as he comes to be seen as divine.the sanskrit epics119"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"To be exact, he appears in a dual role, as the Ya ̄dava chief who sides with thePa ̄n.d.avas and gives them frequently devious and unscrupulous advice, and asthe supreme personal deity who only occasionally reveals his true identity (mostnotably, of course, to Arjuna in the Bhagavadgı ̄ta ̄). This less than central positionis to some extent modified in the 16th book, the Mausalaparvan or “Book ofthe Clubs,” which tells the story of the deaths of Kr.s.n.a and his half-brotherBalara ̄ma (also called Baladeva and Sam.kars.an.a) and is then more fully reme-died in the Harivam.s ́a, “the dynasty of Hari” (i.e. Vis.n.u=Kr.s.n.a), composedduring the second half of the period of growth of the Maha ̄bha ̄rata itself as asupplement to it; Kr.s.n.a’s centrality in the Harivam.s ́ais in marked contrast to theMaha ̄bha ̄rata, where he stands aside from the central action. In the Maha ̄bha ̄ratanarrative, Kr.s.n.a is most prominent in the preparations for war, when he acts asa negotiator on the Pa ̄n.d.avas’ behalf with the Kauravas (e.g. 5.30 and 5.71) butappears as one of the strongest protagonists of the conflict, urging Yudhis.t.hiraon. So too, in the Bhagavadgı ̄ta ̄(6.23–40), Kr.s.n.a encourages his friend Arjuna,for whom he has agreed to act as charioteer, to abandon his misgivings and toengage in the battle.The inclusion of the Bhagavadgı ̄ta ̄at this crucial point of the Maha ̄bha ̄rata nar-rative sets it firmly in the battle context and it is precisely the ethics of Arjuna’sposition which is the starting point for Kr.s.n.a’s discourse, although as a whole itdevelops a philosophically and theologically significant message which rangesfar beyond its immediate setting; that setting was, however, undoubtedly usefulin securing it a much wider popular audience than was enjoyed by the Vedicliterature and it seems clear that it was subsequently inserted within theMaha ̄bha ̄rata for just that reason. The contrast between Kr.s.n.a’s revelation ofhimself as the supreme deity and Arjuna’s casual familiarity with him in the restof the epic is indeed striking. Kr.s.n.a begins his answer to Arjuna’s doubts bystressing the need to fulfil one’s role in society and asserting that, since the self(a ̄tman) is eternal and indestructible, it does not die with the body and so, sincedeath is not final, there is no need to grieve over the imminent deaths in battle.He then goes on to affirm that all activity is a sacrifice if undertaken correctly, in a spirit of detachment, thus incorporating both sacrifice and renunciationwithin the context of life in the world; actions as such have no particular effect,provided one acts without interest in the result, and indeed actions are in realityperformed by the gun.as, the constituents of nature, which are completelyseparate from the a ̄tman. Other themes which Kr.s.n.a explores are Brahman, theself-discipline of yoga, the nature of the supreme deity and his attributes, andloyal service (bhakti) to the deity; the Bhagavadgı ̄ta ̄thus synthesizes into anoverall theistic framework various strands of thought then current, whiledrawing most heavily on the Upanis.ads.The climax of the Bhagavadgı ̄ta ̄comes in the theophany in the eleventhchapter, where Kr.s.n.a reveals to Arjuna his universal, terrifying form, which pro-duces in Arjuna the response of humble adoration and penitence for his formercasual attitude (soon to be resumed). In the remaining chapters, which containa variety of topics, there is a gradual return to the theme of devotion or bhakti,120john brockington"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"which reaches its climax in Kr.s.n.a’s declaration of his attachment (bhakti)toArjuna and the promise that by his grace he can be reached and entered into.This way of devotion is available to all, unlike the way of knowledge, which fewcan achieve, or the way of action without attachment, and so is superior toeither. It is worth noting that Kr.s.n.a presents himself in the Bhagavadgı ̄ta ̄as thesupreme, identical to or more often superior to Brahmanand that there is no realtrace of his identification with Vis.n.u, either directly or as avata ̄ra.The substantial transformation in the view of Kr.s.n.a which we find in theHarivam.s ́a(which revolves around the figure of Kr.s.n.a) is undoubtedly one of themost pivotal innovations in the history of Hinduism. Here for the first time is pre-sented Kr.s.n.a the child hero of the forests in Vr.nda ̄vana and protector of cows,the figure who over the centuries is to become the adorable infant, the cowherdand the lover of the cowgirls (gopı ̄s). Although there may be occasional hints ofthis facet of his nature in the Maha ̄bha ̄rata (but this is debatable), the Harivam.s ́aprovides the first connected account of this and other aspects of his life, such asthe taming of the water snake Ka ̄liya (55–6), his lifting of Mount Govardhanain defiance of Indra, whose continuing decline is still more marked in otherepisodes (60–1), the killing of his evil uncle Kam.sa (72–76), the attack onMathura ̄by Jara ̄sam.dha (80–2) and the move from Mathura ̄ to the new city ofDva ̄raka ̄ (84 and 93). Equally, his older brother Balara ̄ma, who appears in onlya minor role in the Maha ̄bha ̄rata, is now a much more important figure and thereis much about the youthful exploits of the two brothers. The other members oftheir clan are still presented in the Harivam.s ́aas being generally ignorant ofKr.s.n.a’s divine nature, in which it contrasts with later narrations in, for example,theVis.n.uandBha ̄gavata Pura ̄n.as.TheRa ̄ma ̄yan.aIn the Ra ̄ma ̄yan.aRa ̄ma is, of course, central and its portrayal of him as theks.atriyaideal or prince and warrior prompts the understanding of Ra ̄ma as anavata ̄ra of Vis.n.u and eventually as supreme deity himself precisely throughdharma; an alternative view stresses the theme of the divine king in Indianthought as the key to Ra ̄ma’s divinity (on this view, present from the earliestphases of the epic). In the core narrative, the second to sixth books, Ra ̄ma is pre-sented as the outstanding martial figure (often compared to Indra, the divinewarrior) whose adherence to ethical values is equally outstanding (he is fre-quently called “the best of upholders ofdharma”), a basically human butexemplary figure. As his moral elevation is emphasized, various episodes ofthe original story receive a moralistic gloss, in order to eliminate the possibilityof moral lapses on his part; so, for example, his killing of the va ̄nara chief Va ̄linwhile the latter is fighting his brother Sugrı ̄va, with whom Ra ̄ma has made apact, is given an elaborate justification, as are his martial activities to protect thehermits while they go about their religious activities (basically in terms of histhe sanskrit epics121"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"duty as a prince to uphold law and order). Similarly, the comparison with Indragives way to an identification with Vis.n.u, first seen at the conclusion of the sixthbook – a later expansion – where various gods, led by Brahma ̄, gather to revealhis divinity to Ra ̄ma (6.105). This recognition is, however, expressed in terms ofidentity and not yet as incarnation.The increasing veneration shown to Ra ̄ma is then reflected in the first andseventh books, which include not only material presenting Ra ̄ma as divine butalso narratives enhancing the status of his opponent Ra ̄vana and so indirectlyof Ra ̄ma, the only person able to defeat him. The purpose of the first book is tonarrate Ra ̄ma’s birth, youthful exploits, and marriage, and generally to providea framework for the narrative; at the gods’ request, Vis.n.u agrees to become incar-nate as Das ́aratha’s four sons as the only means of destroying Ra ̄vana, the evilking of Lan.ka ̄. The last book is set in Ayodhya ̄ after Ra ̄ma’s victorious return torule in Ayodhya ̄ but the first half details Ra ̄vana’s genealogy and his misdeedsbefore his encounter with Ra ̄ma (making him into an adversary of the gods),while the rest of the book deals with events after Ra ̄ma’s installation; theseinclude Ra ̄ma reluctantly ordering Sı ̄ta ̄’s exile to Va ̄lmı ̄ki’s hermitage (placingpublic opinion above his own feelings for his wife) and the birth of the twins,Kus ́a and Lava, at Va ̄lmı ̄ki’s hermitage. Eventually, after a long and prosperousreign, described in ideal terms, Ra ̄ma settles the kingdom on his sons and pub-licly immolates himself in the river Sarayu (thus returning to his form as Vis.n.u).Whereas the Maha ̄bha ̄rata narrative of Kr.s.n.a was next developed in a supple-ment to it, the Harivam.s ́a, the account of Ra ̄ma in the Ra ̄ma ̄yan.ais developed inthe Pura ̄n.as and in the later Sanskrit Ra ̄ma ̄yan.as. Thus, for example, the Ku ̄rmaPura ̄n.aaccount contains the important theological development of the illusorySı ̄ta ̄ created by Agni before she is seized by Ra ̄van.a, thus safeguarding the realSı ̄ta ̄’s purity; this motif then occurs also in the Adhya ̄tma Ra ̄ma ̄yan.a,Tulsı ̄da ̄s’sRa ̄mcaritma ̄nasand elsewhere. The later Sanskrit Ra ̄ma ̄yan.asgive a Veda ̄ntinslant to the emerging bhaktiemphasis; the Yoga ̄vasis.t.ha, though claiming to beby Va ̄lmı ̄ki, also asserts that it is the twelfth telling of the story and lays consid-erable stress on Ra ̄ma as a liberated being (jı ̄vanmukta) in a unique blend ofabstract philosophy and vivid narrative, while the Adhya ̄tma Ra ̄ma ̄yan.ateachesa form of Advaita Veda ̄nta combined with belief in Ra ̄ma’s saving grace and alsoincorporates the Ra ̄magı ̄ta ̄, perhaps the first significant attempt to give Ra ̄ma ateaching role analogous to Kr.s.n.a’s. Already in the Adhya ̄tma Ra ̄ma ̄yan.awe see amotif which is common in many later retellings, that those killed by Ra ̄ma arethereby blessed. The first version of the Ra ̄ma ̄yan.ain a regional language isKampan ̄’s Tamil Ira ̄ma ̄vata ̄ram, appearing in the wake of the impassioned bhaktipoetry of the A ̄l ̄va ̄rs; already in this there is something of the emphasis on thename of Ra ̄ma which becomes so significant later. In North India, the first majoradaptation is that into Bengali by Kr.ttiba ̄s but the Hindi Ra ̄mcaritma ̄nasofTulsı ̄da ̄s has become much the best known, notable for its vision of Ra ̄ma’srighteous rule and the saving power of his name, as well as for its use as the base text for the Ra ̄mlı ̄la ̄, a dramatic enactment of the story staged annually bylocal communities across much of North India.122john brockington"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Doctrinal DevelopmentsKr.s.n.a and Ra ̄ma are the most widely worshipped of the avata ̄ras of Vis.n.u but theavata ̄ra concept as such only begins to emerge in the later stages of developmentof the epics, even though the Bhagavadgı ̄ta ̄ is commonly regarded as proclaim-ing the basic rationale for Vis.n.u’s “descents,” when Kr.s.n.a declares that he incarnates himself in age after age to destroy the wicked and to protect the righ-teous (4.5–8). Indeed, didactic parts of the Maha ̄bha ̄rata list just four or six ofVis.n.u’s “manifestations” (pra ̄durbha ̄va, the term it uses rather than the later termavata ̄ra), while the Ra ̄ma ̄yan.ashows no awareness of the concept. The fish,matsya, which saved Manu from a great deluge is identified with Brahma ̄ in theMaha ̄bha ̄rata (3.195), just as in the Ra ̄ma ̄yan.a(6.105) the boar which raisesthe earth from the waters is Brahma ̄; their identification with Vis.n.u comes later. The exploits of Ra ̄ma Ja ̄madagnya (later known more commonly asParas ́ura ̄ma) are given some prominence in the Maha ̄bha ̄rata and he also occursin an episode in the first book of the Ra ̄ma ̄yan.awhere he is worsted by the youngRa ̄ma Da ̄s ́arathi. The Maha ̄bha ̄rata also lists Va ̄mana, the dwarf, and Narasim.ha(12.326 and 337) and predicts the future avata ̄ra, Kalkin (3.188–9). In theversion of the Va ̄mana myth found in the Ra ̄ma ̄yan.a(1.28.2–11), Vis.n.u presentsthe three worlds that he has regained to Indra, who by implication is still supe-rior to him.The lists of Vis.n.u’s manifestations occur within the didactic portions(primarily books 12–13) which also contain a significant amount of materialrelating to the emergence of Vais.n.avism as such, as well as a certain amount of broadly philosophic material. The process of fusion of Na ̄ra ̄yan.a with Vis.n.uis under way by now; whereas the story of Ma ̄rkan.d.eya entering the mouth ofNa ̄ra ̄yan.a and seeing the whole universe inside his body (3.186) uses only thename Na ̄ra ̄yan.a and there is no hint of his identity with Vis.n.u or Kr.s.n.aVa ̄sudeva, in the Na ̄ra ̄yan.ı ̄ya(12.321–39) from chapter 328 onwards the nameVis.n.u is often used instead of Na ̄ra ̄yan.a, while elsewhere it is often stated thatArjuna and Kr.s.n.a are Nara and Na ̄ra ̄yan.a, who are ancient r.s.is, sages, and alsodivine beings noted for the eternality and perfection of their friendship. TheNa ̄ra ̄yan.ı ̄yais the main but relatively late passage (probably no earlier than the third century ce) on worship of Na ̄ra ̄yan.a and is clearly a composite text: thefirst six chapters form a complex sequence of emboxed narratives, while theremaining chapters contain a series of subsequent expansions. With its doctrineof the fourfold nature of the supreme being, it presents the formative stages ofthe Pa ̄ñcara ̄tra system, which appears to have stood somewhat outside themainstream of orthodoxy.The text declares that the supreme deity Na ̄ra ̄yan.a is gracious to those whoare single-mindedly devoted to him and that they attain the highest goal, whichis Va ̄sudeva, thus bringing into relationship with Na ̄ra ̄yan.a the name Va ̄sudevawhich is elsewhere regarded as a patronymic of Kr.s.n.a. Na ̄ra ̄yan.a explains to hisdevotee, the ancient seer Na ̄rada, that Va ̄sudeva is the supreme purus.a, the innerthe sanskrit epics123"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"ruler of everyone, Na ̄ra ̄yan.a himself being the ordainer of the universe and thecreator. Much of the first six chapters of the text presents the doctrine of theinaccessibility of the supreme deity through the story of Na ̄rada’s journey to amysterious white continent, s ́vetadvı ̄pa, inhabited by white beings who worshipNa ̄ra ̄yan.a, who is invisible to all except his exclusive devotees. The worshippersare called by various names, Bha ̄gavata, Sa ̄tvata, Eka ̄ntin, and Pa ̄ñcara ̄tra (thevariety no doubt indicating the existence of differing groups, the Bha ̄gavatas no doubt being the worshippers of Kr.s.n.a as bhagavat, the lord), and overall the impression is of several originally separate trends that are in the process of merging.Doctrinally too the Na ̄ra ̄yan.ı ̄yashows a blend of Upanis.adic monism, dualisticelements similar to Sa ̄m.khya and Yoga, and Bra ̄hmanical ritualism, with thedevotional worship of a personal deity – through a synthesis of several separatepassages – and assigning a higher value to ritual and asceticism than in the com-parable synthesis presented in the slightly earlier Bhagavadgı ̄ta ̄. Virtually everymention of the term Pa ̄ñcara ̄tra occurs within the Na ̄ra ̄yan.ı ̄ya, which is also theonly part of the Maha ̄bha ̄rata where the theory of the vyu ̄has, the divine expan-sions, is presented in detail. This represents an adaptation of the story of Kr.s.n.aand his relatives to a cosmogonic perspective. Beneath Vis.n.u-Na ̄ra ̄yan.a, theimmutable ultimate deity, are the four vyu ̄has, who take charge of creation:Va ̄sudeva, presented as superior to the other three, gives rise to Sam.kars.an.a,from whom emanates Pradyumna (who, however, in the Ya ̄dava lineage isKr.s.n.a’s son), who in turn fathers Aniruddha. After this the gross creation com-mences through the agency of Brahma ̄, but all activity belongs to the four divineforms, who are also assimilated to the tattvas, constituent principles of Sa ̄m.khya.This theory seems to have evolved around the first to second century cecon-currently with the avata ̄ra theory, which in the long run becomes more popular.Although the developed Pa ̄ñcara ̄tra system is mainly concerned with ritualpractice, there is surprisingly little about this aspect in the Maha ̄bha ̄rata.Sa ̄m.khya and YogaThese two long books of the Maha ̄bha ̄rata in which Bhı ̄s.ma propounds his adviceto Yudhis.t.hira contain a substantial amount of teaching which can broadly be called philosophical, of which the largest part is related to the later Sa ̄m.khyaand Yoga systems, but there are also passages relating to a number of otherapproaches; these are mostly to be found in the third section of the S ́a ̄ntiparvan,called the Moks.adharmaparvan (12.168–353). In addition, there are similar passages elsewhere in the Maha ̄bha ̄rata, most obviously the Bhagavadgı ̄ta ̄, butalso the recapitulation of it which Kr.s.n.a delivers to Arjuna after the battle (theAnugı ̄ta ̄, 14.16–50), an early such passage attributed to the mythical sageSanatsuja ̄ta (the Sanatsuja ̄tı ̄ya, 5.43–5) and a few others. In contrast, neitherSa ̄m.khya nor Yoga occur in the Ra ̄ma ̄yan.a. While in the Maha ̄bha ̄rata the concept124john brockington"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"ofkarma as the determinant of human destiny is on the whole the dominantone, the prevalence of other views about this, not uncommonly in the narrativeand even occasionally in the didactic parts, is worth noting. In various passagesfate (daiva, etc.), time, death, nature and one’s own nature are each regarded asthe supreme principle; ideas were still evidently in flux and indeed we see herethe more popular equivalent of the ferment of ideas recorded in the Upanis.ads.More traditional practices are still advocated and even deliberately contrastedwith the philosophical approaches labeled Sa ̄m.khya and Yoga (which in any caseare emerging trends rather than definite systems – the terms may at times meanno more than theory and practice respectively) or with developing Vais.n.avatheism. For example, in one passage (12.189–93), Bhı ̄s.ma declares that japa, themurmuring of Vedic verses, constitutes a way of life belonging to the Vedic tra-dition and distinct from Sa ̄m.khya and Yoga – which he has treated successivelyin the two preceding chapters – and he emphasizes that someone practicing japaselflessly is equal to a Yogin in achievements; the passage is clearly intended todefend this traditional practice from the challenge of the newer ideas. Again,immediately after the Na ̄ra ̄yan.ı ̄ya – and so in implicit contrast to it – comes anepisode designed to extol the merits of living on the grain gleaned after harvest(12.340–53, cf. 3.245–7). Other passages tackle the emerging ethical andreligious issues of nonviolence (ahim.sa ̄), vegetarianism, and veneration of thecow (e.g. 12.253–6, 257, 260–2 and 264, and 13.115–17).Several teachers are cited in the Moks.adharmaparvan as teaching some formof Sa ̄m.khya, but the doctrines attributed to them vary and are not necessarilyspecific to Sa ̄m.khya; three of these teachers are often referred to later asimportant precursors of the developed system (Kapila, A ̄suri, and Pañcas ́ikha).However, most epic descriptions of Sa ̄m.khya are not by Sa ̄m.khya teachers butreport their views. Although consequently these passages are not primarysources for knowledge about the system, they do include ideas then current andmay well have been composed during the period when Sa ̄m.khya schools wereemerging. Indeed, Sa ̄m.khya had not assumed its later distinctive shape even bythe end of the epic period; the nearest approach to the classical system is foundin the very late Anugı ̄ta ̄, which also incorporates significant Yoga elements. Oneearly passage (12.187 ª12.239–40) contains a synthesis of ancient cosmolog-ical speculations and yogic theories of evolution. Other passages mention threetypes of Sa ̄m.khya thinkers – those who accept just 24 categories, those whoaccept 25, and those who accept 26, the last being the supreme deity – butmostly the versions of Sa ̄m.khya found in the Maha ̄bha ̄rata are nontheistic, unlikeYoga. The clearest theistic version is found in the Bhagavadgı ̄ta ̄.Yoga and yogins occur quite widely in the Maha ̄bha ̄rata in contexts whichsuggest a wider and to some extent a different understanding of the terms thanthat found in classical Yoga. Also, the older practice oftapas and that of Yoga areoften linked (but are often seen just as effective means to gain worldly ends).However, by the time of the Na ̄ra ̄yan.ı ̄ya,tapas and Yoga are both being subor-dinated to bhakti, with Na ̄ra ̄yan.a identifying himself as the goal of Yoga pro-claimed in Yoga texts (12.326.65), while the juxtaposition of Sa ̄m.khya and Yogathe sanskrit epics125"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"has become a commonplace in the Na ̄ra ̄yan.ı ̄ya, whereas they are more distinctand even contrasted in earlier passages. In all the Yoga passages there is a strongemphasis on discipline and control of the senses; the supernatural powers towhich they lead should be avoided by the true Yogin, for the proper goal is theattainment of the state of Brahman or union with the one. Yoga practice, as pre-sented in the Maha ̄bha ̄rata, comprises four main aspects of general preparationsthrough moral conduct; diet, posture and surroundings; breath-control; andwithdrawal of the senses, concentration and meditation. Although I ̄s ́vara, thesupreme deity, is recognized, he is not active and tends to be equated with theself in its enlightened state. Two striking aspects of Yoga in the Maha ̄bha ̄rata arethe concern with techniques of dying and the use of the imagery of light. Theseare sometimes combined as in the death of Drona, where he resorts to Yoga,becomes a light, and ascends to heaven, so that it seems to those below that thereare two suns in the sky (7.165.35–40).In addition to this more obviously philosophical material in its third section,theS ́a ̄ntiparvan also contains in its first two sections much material that, in thecontext of its broadly practical purpose, also has religious implications. Thesetwo sections focus on and take their names from the duties of kings, ra ̄jadharma,and what is allowable in hard times, a ̄paddharma, both incorporating the termdharma with its meanings of morality and tradition. The second in particularhas had considerable influence on later Hinduism through its accommoda-tion of theory – for example, that Bra ̄hmans should only teach – with actualpractice – that in reality they follow a wider range of occupations in order toearn a living.Later InfluenceThe influence of the epics on later Hinduism, and more generally on Indianculture as a whole, is shown not only by the summaries of the stories of Ra ̄maand Kr.s.n.a in the Pura ̄n.as and by the later Sanskrit Ra ̄ma ̄yan.asthat have alreadybeen briefly mentioned but also in pure literature, art and theatre right up to thepresent day. Indeed, the impact extends more widely still, since the Jain univer-sal history makes the Kr.s.n.a story a model for much of its structure, while ver-sions of the Ra ̄ma story are found in both Buddhist and Jain texts in India andspread throughout Southeast Asia and as far as China and Japan, with the storyon occasion being localized in the individual cultures (this is seen most obviouslyin Thailand, where the Thai kings were frequently called Ra ̄ma and the Thaicapital was named Ayutthiya after Ra ̄ma’s Ayodhya ̄), and many plays on theRa ̄ma and Pa ̄n.d.ava stories are performed in the Wayang Kulit puppet theatre ofJava. The plots of much of classical Sanskrit literature are drawn from one orother of the epics (and even now modern Indian writers not infrequently drawon them). Sculptural representations are found on temples in North India fromperhaps as early as the fifth century ceand one of the most famous examples of126john brockington"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"South Indian art is the carving, covering a massive granite outcrop, of Arjuna’sPenance or the Descent of the Gan.ga ̄ from the Maha ̄bha ̄rata carved at Ma ̄malla-puram in the middle of the seventh century. Scenes drawn specifically from theMaha ̄bha ̄rata andRa ̄ma ̄yan.a(not simply of the Ra ̄ma and Kr.s.n.a stories) arecarved on the outer walls of temples in many regions and at many periods.Miniature painters in the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries frequently illustratedepisodes from the epics, under both Mughal and Ra ̄jput patronage, with severalcomplete illustrated manuscripts being produced, some on a very lavish scale.Adaptations of both epics into modern Indian languages were commonlyamong the first significant works to be produced in each language; in all of theseadaptations the religious aspects are given greater prominence and the originalheroic emphasis is correspondingly reduced. The earliest examples come fromthe Dravidian languages of South India but in due course, from about thefifteenth century, adaptations in the languages of North India followed. Theirimportance to the culture as a whole is clearly demonstrated by the fact that thegreat Mughal emperor Akbar commissioned translations of both into Persian inthe 1580s as part of his strategy for understanding his subjects, just as the guruof the Mara ̄t.hı ̄ nationalist leader, S ́iva ̄jı ̄, used the Ra ̄ma ̄yan.astory in the serviceof Mara ̄t.ha ̄ nationalism against Muslim rule in the seventeenth century. Thepopularity of the serializations shown on Indian television (the Ra ̄ma ̄yan.ain1987–8, the Maha ̄bha ̄rata in 1989–90) and subsequently made available onvideo (and so accessible to Hindus abroad as well) has been enormous, but oneof the most striking features about them was the extent to which their formatwas dictated by traditional religious values and thus the viewing of them wastreated as a form of worship; much of the style and presentation of the Ra ̄ma ̄yan.aserial was based on that of the Ra ̄mlı ̄la ̄, that traditional community-based dra-matic presentation of the story which is performed annually in so many loca-tions across North India and which has clearly played so major a part in thepopularity of the Ra ̄ma story and in particular in its broad appeal beyond sec-tarian boundaries. It is no surprise, therefore, that various political parties haveappropriated the Ra ̄ma story and in particular the concept ofra ̄mra ̄j(ra ̄mara ̄jya,Ra ̄ma’s righteous rule) for their own purposes, from the Ram Rajya Parishadthrough to the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Ramjanmabhumi agitation.As the vital link between the Vedas, commonly regarded as the source ofauthority within Hinduism, and the popular forms of Hinduism first found inthe Pura ̄n.as and still current today, the two Sanskrit epics have played a signifi-cant role in shaping that family of religions. The designation of the Maha ̄bha ̄rataas the “fifth Veda” makes a claim both to continuity and to the authoritativenessof the Vedas – an authority which also includes a claim to comprehensiveness(as in the assertion quoted at the beginning of this chapter). This continuity isalso implicit in the belief that the Maha ̄bha ̄rata was first recited by Vya ̄sa(“arranger”), the sage whom tradition regards as the compiler of the Vedas andoften the composer of the Pura ̄n.as. The equivalent for the Ra ̄ma ̄yan.ais the tra-dition, recorded late in its development at the beginning of the first book, thatits author Va ̄lmı ̄ki is granted a vision of Brahma ̄, the creator deity, who the sanskrit epics127"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"commissions him to compose the story of the ideal person, Ra ̄ma, just identifiedas such by the sage Na ̄rada.This continuity lies not only in the extended period over which both epics weregrowing to their present dimensions but also in the way that both were taken upby all succeeding periods both culturally and religiously, so that they havebecome part of the very fabric of the culture. Indeed, they have been used notonly in support of traditional orthodoxy, as one might expect, but also by manymarginalized groups who have found a special affinity with one of their char-acters; for example, Sı ̄ta ̄’s trials have enabled women to air the problem of ahusband’s neglect, Ra ̄vana’s defiance of the establishment has been glorified bysome South Indians and some outcaste groups, and Va ̄lmı ̄ki has become centralto the beliefs of one untouchable group. Such selective appropriation of the epic narratives serves to underline both their richness and their flexibility. Yet the position of the epics within Hindu culture is even more basic than that:A. K. Ramanujan’s assertion that no Indian ever hears the Ra ̄ma ̄yan.astory forthe first time conveys the very real truth, applicable to both epics, that theirstories and their characters are integral to every Hindu’s consciousness.BibliographyBiardeau, Madeleine. 1976/1978. “Études de mythologie hindoue: Bhakti et avata ̄ra,”Bulletin de l’École Française d’Extrême Orient63 (1976): 111–263 and 65 (1978):87–238.Brockington, John. 1984.

There is a hint of danger in the metaphor, and asuggestion that selection is necessary here if one is to find the path through thejungle. Even without such a metaphor, however, there are several features of thePura ̄n.as which would instill caution into anyone proposing to study them. It isnot only that they are vast in extent and miscellaneous in content. They offerinformation about themselves which is strangely at odds with their perceivedactuality. First of all, their best-known examples announce that the Pura ̄n.asare 18 in number, but in reality there are far more: Ludo Rocher’s standard work on them lists 82 by name without making any claim that this number isexhaustive. Moreover, the Pura ̄n.as are not the homogeneous group of textswhich a number as small as 18 might lead one to expect. They are not simply aHindu genre: there are Jaina Pura ̄n.as also. They are not simply a Sanskrit phe-nomenon either: there are Pura ̄n.as in many Indian vernaculars, some of themtranslated from Sanskrit originals and others composed from the start in thevernacular.Secondly, the Pura ̄n.as define themselves as pañcalaks.an.a, having five charac-teristic topics, yet an eminent Indian scholar has estimated that these topics“occupy less than three percent of the extant Maha ̄pura ̄n.as” (Kane 1977: 841).Thirdly, there is a discrepancy between the way in which the Pura ̄n.as classifythemselves and their actual contents. A fourth problem arises, not from thePura ̄n.as’ statements about themselves, but from their present existence inprinted and bound editions. In this form they give the impression of being books,intended for reading, commentary, and annotation, but originally they wouldhave been more accurately described as performances, intended to be seen,heard, and enjoyed. Unless some appreciation of this is present, today’s readerof the Pura ̄n.as fails to understand them."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"A closer examination of these four issues will now be made, beginning withthe last one, then dealing with the other three in the order in which they havejust been mentioned. In some cases this may uncover more problems rather thanoffering solutions, but it should convey to the reader that the study of thePura ̄n.as is a challenging and rewarding field.Books or Performances?The difference between the Pura ̄n.as’ oral origins and their current existence asbooks is one which continues to create misunderstandings as to their nature andpurpose. It is hard to remember that the text which the reader sees is not a fixedentity deliberately intended by a writer or group of writers (although it is pos-sible that the Bha ̄gavatais an exception here; cf. Hardy 1990: 76; Doniger 1993:127), but something fluid, a snapshot of a river of tradition, made up of manytributaries, which might look very different if the shot had been taken furtherup or downstream.Like the Maha ̄bha ̄rata, the Pura ̄n.as are generally thought by scholars to havebeen first recited by su ̄tas, bards who attended ks.atriyaleaders and provided themwith inspiration and entertainment in the form of stories of their ancestors.According to Va ̄yu1.31–2:svadharma es.a su ̄tasya sadbhir dr.s.t.ah.pura ̄tanaih./ deva ̄ta ̄na ̄m r.s.ı ̄na ̄m.ca ra ̄jña ̄m.ca ̄mit-atejasa ̄m // vam.s ́a ̄na ̄m.dha ̄ran.am.ka ̄ryam.s ́ruta ̄na ̄m.ca maha ̄tmana ̄m / itiha ̄sapura ̄n.es.udis.t.a ̄ ye brahmava ̄dibhih.//(Thesu ̄ta’s special duty as perceived by good men of oldwas to preserve the genealogies of gods, rishis and most glorious kings, the tradi-tions of great men, which are displayed by those who declare sacred lore in theItiha ̄sas and Pura ̄n.as. (Pargiter’s translation, Pargiter 1972: 15; cf. Padma5.1.27–8)A good deal of the material which is known today as making up the Pura ̄n.asmust have circulated orally for centuries in the repertoires of such men as these,no doubt in the form of short pieces which they would combine together inlonger sequences, adapting their material to suit their audiences.Almost all the Pura ̄n.as are said to have the Su ̄ ta (either Lomahars.an.a or hisson Ugras ́ravas) as their overall narrator, even though his chief task is some-times – as in, for example, the Bha ̄gavata– to introduce a previous narrator fromwhom he has heard the story. But the Su ̄ ta is not seen as the composer of thePura ̄n.a, which has a more exalted origin. According to Matsya53.3–4, it wasBrahma ̄ who first proclaimed the one Pura ̄n.a of a billion s ́lokas. This was medi-ated to the human world by Vis.n.u in the form of Vya ̄sa, who condensed thedivine text into a shorter version and divided it into 18.This theory of divine origin shows that the Pura ̄n.as regard themselves as reli-gious texts with an importance equal to that of the Vedas; they are vedasammita(Va ̄yu1.11, 4.12). At some point in their transmission they became carriers of130freda matchett"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"Vedic values, used by brahmans for three main purposes: to make the bra ̄hman.icideology accessible to a wider public, to draw popular myths, rituals and prac-tices into the framework of this ideology, and to create a synthesis between thevarn.a ̄s ́ramadharmawhich gave society its norms and the s ́raman.a-derived valuesof the renouncer. Although they were still performed to entertain their audi-ences, there was now a stronger didactic purpose behind their recitation. Likethe week-end newspapers of the West at the end of the twentieth century, theywere telling their hearers not only how to live but also how to see the world.In spite of this strong didactic character, the Pura ̄n.as are not the monologuesone might expect. They have a dialogic structure which conveys something of the interaction between narrator and audience which took place in the dayswhen they were performances rather than books. All the Pura ̄n.as have a respon-dent as well as a narrator – or perhaps he should be given the more active titleof questioner, since he requests information, changes the direction of the nar-rative, determines the amount of detail which the narrator provides, and gen-erally helps to shape the course of the Pura ̄n.a (cf. Bailey 1995: 75–7). Moreover,there are hierarchies of interlocutors, and other pairs besides the chief narratorand respondent are employed to introduce the stories and other types of ma-terial which are embedded in the main narratives or major didactic passages.The Pura ̄n.ic narratives are of various kinds. Some are creation myths foundalso in the Maha ̄bha ̄rata, such as the churning of the Ocean of Milk (Mbh.1.15.4–17.30;Vis.n.u1.9) or the raising of the earth from beneath the cosmicwaters (Mbh.3.100.19;Ma ̄rkan.d.eya47.2–14;Padma1.3.25b–52a; 5.3.20b–52a;Va r a ̄ha2.21–6;Vis.n.u4.1–52). Others are stories of kings and princes whichaugment the Pura ̄n.ic genealogies. Others again are stories of gods or goddesses:Kr.s.n.a has a full-scale biography in Bha ̄gavata10–11,Brahmavaivarta4(S ́ríkr.s.n.ajanmakhan.d.a),Padma(Pa ̄ta ̄lakhan.d.a69–99), and Vis.n.u5, while much“biographical” information about S ́iva and his family is given in various parts oftheS ́ivaand the Skanda. There are also stories celebrating the power ofbhakti,e.g. Vis.n.u’s deliverance of Ambaris.a from the wrath of Durva ̄sas (Bha ̄gavata9.4.15–5.27), as well as others which present violations ofdharmawhich arenot to be followed, e.g. Vis.n.u3.18.52–94, which tells of King S ́atadhanu, whohas to suffer a number of animal rebirths as a consequence of talking with aheretic (pa ̄s.an.d.a), and is only reborn eventually as a man through the loyalty ofhis virtuous wife.In spite of their awareness of their own religious significance, there is no indi-cation that the Pura ̄n.as were ever like the Vedas in being memorized as exactlyas possible for word-perfect transmission from one generation to the next. On thecontrary, their nature as performances and the audience participation which issymbolized by the respondent/questioner meant that they preserved the core oftheir message by continually changing, perhaps incorporating the praises of anewly-built temple (e.g. the celebration of the Su ̄ rya temple at Kon.a ̄rka inBrahma28), referring to some important event in the life of the society aroundthem (as Vis.n.u3.17 may refer to the expulsion of Buddhists from the region ofthe Narmada ̄), or showing changes in the religious affiliation of the group whichthe pura ̄n.as131"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"was transmitting the text (e.g. the Ku ̄rmaappears to be a Pa ̄s ́upata reworking of what was originally a Pa ̄ñcara ̄tra text). To quote Giorgio Bonazzoli, “thepura ̄n.a-s grow like trees: old branches are pruned, things are transformed or removed, new blossoms appear, things are added and the result is a continu-ously changing living reality, always equal to itself although always different”(Bonazzoli 1983: 101).Yet however much one may stress their oral origins or the fluidity of theirtransmission, the Pura ̄n.as in their present form undoubtedly exist as books.Some of them contain passages (e.g. Matsya53) which praise such activities asmaking copies of them in whole or in part, or giving away such copies to others,so it is obvious that this transition from oral to written transmission met withno suspicion or disapproval. There is no information as to when it took place.Indeed the whole question of dating the Pura ̄n.as in their earliest oral or writtenforms, is attended by daunting uncertainties. It is not a question which intereststhe Pura ̄n.as themselves: as far as they are concerned, they all come into beingat the same time as a result of Vya ̄sa’s work in each dva ̄parayugaas it rolls round(Vis.n.u3.3.5–21). If one looks to texts other than the Pura ̄n.as, the earliest knownappearance of the word pura ̄n.a, as a name for a literary genre, is in Atharvaveda11.7.24, and it occurs several times, both in the singular and the plural, in theMaha ̄bha ̄rata, but there is little to indicate the nature of these pura ̄n.asor to linkthem with those which exist today.Rocher’s examples of attempts to date the Pura ̄n.as show how twentieth-century scholars have tried to put specific dates upon texts in spite of appreciat-ing the difficulties involved. He himself concludes: “I submit that it is not possibleto set a specific date for any pura ̄n.a as a whole” (Rocher 1986: 103). Maybe oneneed not be totally agnostic. It would be hard to disagree, for instance, withHardy’s view that “the most reasonable date” for the Bha ̄gavatais “the ninth orearly tenth century” (Hardy 1983: 488). Yet Hardy shares Rocher’s general viewin that he declares “On the whole it is meaningless to speak of ‘the date’ of aSanskritpura ̄n.a, because many generations of bards, etc., have been involved inthe accumulation of material which at some stage has been given a name . . .”(1983: 486).The Great EighteenSeveral of the essays in Pura ̄n.a Perennisspell out the diversity of pura ̄n.ic litera-ture. John Cort gives “An Overview of the Jaina Pura ̄n.as” (Doniger 1993:185–206), saying that “a list of all the known Jaina Pura ̄n.as would total aboutseveral hundred” (1993: 185). A. K. Ramanujan discusses what he calls the“folk Pura ̄n.as,” of which he says the best known are the Tamil sthalapura ̄n.asstudied by David Shulman (Doniger 1993: 101). Shulman himself drawsattention to vernacular Pura ̄n.as by comparing an episode from the SanskritBha ̄gavatapura ̄n.awith the same episode as told in the fifteenth-century Telugu132freda matchett"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Maha ̄bha ̄gavatamu(Doniger 1993: 121–57). Friedhelm Hardy also draws uponsthalapura ̄n.as(“local Pura ̄n.as,” as he calls them elsewhere, Hardy 1990: 77),both Sanskrit and vernacular, in order to illustrate “the Pura ̄n.ic process” (1990:159–82). The only type of Pura ̄n.a which is not discussed at some point in Pura ̄n.aPerennisis the caste-pura ̄n.a(e.g. the Mallaand the Ka ̄lika ̄which are the subjectof Das 1968).The point that I wish to make by referring to these studies of pura ̄n.ic diver-sity is that concentration on the 18 texts which have a special place in thebra ̄hman.ical Sanskrit tradition involves a considerable limitation of one’s hori-zons as far as the whole pura ̄n.ic field is concerned. Because I am writing just oneshort chapter, rather than a whole book, most of what I say will be concernedwith this more limited field. Yet it is important to remember the wider horizon –not least because it demonstrates the audacity of the claim made by thebra ̄hman.icalpaura ̄n.ikasto have produced the “great,” i.e. normative and authori-tative, examples of pura ̄n.ic literature.Before discussing the nature of this claim it would be as well to look at thenames of the Eighteen. The following list is given in Vis.n.u3.6.20–4:BrahmaBrahmavaivartaPadmaLin.gaVis.n.uVara ̄haS ́ivaSkandaBha ̄gavataVa ̄manaNa ̄radaKu ̄rmaMa ̄rkan.d.eyaMatsyaAgniGarud.aBhavis.yaBrahma ̄n.d.aThis list coincides exactly with that which the Muslim scholar al-Bı ̄ru ̄nı ̄(973–1048ce) says was read to him from the Vis.n.u.It is almost identical withthat given in Matsya53.13–53, the only difference being that Va ̄yuappears inthe latter instead ofS ́iva. There are other lists also, with slight variations, andeven a completely different list which al-Bı ̄ru ̄nı ̄ claims to have heard in additionto the one from the Vis.n.u(Rocher 1986: 32–3), but on the whole the list is gen-erally agreed. The discrepancy between S ́ivaandVa ̄yuis explained in Skanda5.3.1.33–4 by saying that these are two names for the same Pura ̄n.a (Rocher1986: 33). Another possible explanation is that there was some confusionbetween the two because one of the sections of the S ́ivais called theVa ̄yavı ̄yasam.hita ̄.Besides these 19 Pura ̄n.as, there is another text which is some-times ranked with them. This is the Harivam.s ́a, a supplement (khila) of theMaha ̄bha ̄ratawhich is pura ̄n.ic rather than epic in its content and tone, and con-tains much material which has close parallels in some Pura ̄n.as. Nevertheless, Ishall continue to refer to this group of Pura ̄n.as as 18 in number, because theysee themselves as 18.Occasionally these 18 Pura ̄n.as are styled maha ̄pura ̄n.as(Bha ̄gavata12.7.10,22;Vis.n.u3.6.24), as though singling them out from a general corpus and the pura ̄n.as133"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"conferring a special status upon them. Sometimes the 18 “major Pura ̄n.as” arecontrasted with 18 “minor Pura ̄n.as” (upapura ̄n.as; cf. Brahmavaivarta4.132.10,22), but there is far less agreement as to the names of the latter than thereis for the maha ̄pura ̄n.as.Rocher discusses the two categories, and concludes thatthe distinction between them is purely artificial, because “there is no basic dif-ference between the maha ̄pura ̄n.as on the one hand and the upapura ̄n.as on theother” (Rocher 1986: 69).However, it may be that the number 18 was not intended originally to singleout a particularly weighty group of Pura ̄n.as from the rest. Originally it may havebeen a statement about the Pura ̄n.as generally. There were 18 Pura ̄n.as, just asthere were 18 parvansin the Maha ̄bha ̄rata, 18 chapters in the Bhagavadgı ̄ta ̄, 18days of the Maha ̄bha ̄ratabattle, and 18 armies fighting in it. In other words, the“18-ness” of the Pura ̄n.as may be a symbol of their close connection with theMaha ̄bha ̄rata.There are other signs of such a connection: almost all thebra ̄hman.ical Sanskrit Pura ̄n.as begin, as the Maha ̄bha ̄ratadoes, with a conversa-tion between the Bard (Su ̄ ta) and the r.s.isof the Naimis.a forest. Without excep-tion, their standard meter is that of the Maha ̄bha ̄rata, the s ́loka.This, of course,is not peculiar to the Maha ̄bha ̄rata– indeed the Ra ̄ma ̄yan.aclaims that its com-poser Va ̄lmı ̄ki invented the s ́loka(Ra ̄m1.2). But while the Ra ̄ma ̄yan.aintroducesits speeches with metrical formulas which are part of its essential structure, thePura ̄n.as follow the Maha ̄bha ̄a ̄ratain using “prose formulae...ofthe type arjunauva ̄caandr.s.aya u ̄cuh.. . . and so on” (Goldman 1984: 17). Their reputed author,Vya ̄sa, is held to be the composer of the Maha ̄bha ̄rataalso. They almost all employtheMaha ̄bha ̄rata’s introductory verse, applying to themselves the title Javathatit uses for the Maha ̄bha ̄rata.The exact meaning of this claim is not certain. Do the Pura ̄n.as regard them-selves as some kind of extension to the Maha ̄bha ̄rata? Perhaps: they extend andsystematize its mythic chronology, and retell many of its myths. But the humanbeings who appear in pura ̄n.ic stories do not struggle to understand and followdharmain the manner of the Maha ̄bha ̄rata’s protagonists. They are for the mostpart exemplars or opponents ofbhaktiwho play stereotyped roles in relation tothe Supreme God whom they adore or defy. Perhaps what the Pura ̄n.as are claim-ing is that they complement the Maha ̄bha ̄ratain some way, making up togethertheitiha ̄sapura ̄n.awhich is necessary to augment the Veda (Mbh1.1.204;1.2.235/Va ̄yu1.200–1).The “Five Characteristic Topics”In the preface to his Vis.n.upura ̄n.a(the first translation of a Pura ̄n.a into English,originally published in 1840), H. H. Wilson said that “that which has five char-acteristic topics” (his translation ofpañcalaks.an.a) meant that the contents of aPura ̄n.a were:134freda matchett"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"1. Primary creation, or cosmogony; 2. Secondary creation, or the destruction andrenovation of worlds, including chronology; 3. Genealogy of gods and patriarchs;4. Reigns of the Manus, or periods called Manvantaras; and 5. History, or such par-ticulars as have been preserved of the princes of the solar and lunar races, and oftheir descendants to modern times. (Wilson 1961: iv)This translation puts an explanatory gloss on the lines which are found in severalPura ̄n.as:sargas ́ ca pratisargas ́ ca vam.s ́o manvantara ̄n.i ca / vam.s ́a ̄nucaritam.ceti pura ̄n.am.pañcalaks.an.am // (Va ̄yu4.10b–11a; cf.Matsya53.65bc;Vis.n.u3.6.25,27).Most scholars since Wilson’s time have more or less followed his translation.Yet there are difficulties in it. Sargais undoubtedly “creation” and manvantara ̄n.i“periods called Manvantaras,” but the other three items are more problematic.One might expect pratisargato mean “counter-creation,” i.e. “destruction,”rather than “secondary creation.” Indeed, Willibald Kirfel, whose attempt toconstitute a text which represented the earliest form of the pañcalaks.an.amaterialwas as influential in 1927 as Wilson’s work had been almost a century earlier,stated that this was the most obvious meaning of the word (Kirfel 1979: xxxvii;he draws upon the Prapañcahr.dayaand Va ̄caspatimis ́ra’s Sa ̄m.khyatattvakaumudı ̄).But he found it difficult to accept this meaning, because it did not occur in anyof the texts which made up his reconstituted pura ̄n.am.pañcalaks.an.am.Instead, herelied upon two verses found in the Matsyaand its parallels in the Padma(Matsya8.1,Padma1.7.68, 5.7.68; Matsya9.6,Padma1.7.85, 5.7.85) and deduced fromthese that, in this context, pratisargameant “further creation” (Weiterschöpfung),in line with the translation offered by Wilson.Nevertheless, pratisargais found in at least four Pura ̄n.ic passages with themeaning “destruction.” In Vis.n.u6.1.1–2, the respondent/questioner Maitreyasays that the narrator Para ̄s ́ara has told him about sarga,vam.s ́a, the duration ofthemanvantaras(manvantarasthiti), and vam.s ́a ̄nucarita, and that now he wants tohear about the dissolution of the universe. Only when Para ̄s ́ara has given himthis information does Maitreya declare that he has been told about sarga,pratis-arga,vam.s ́a,manvantara ̄n.i, and vam.s ́a ̄nucarita.InBrahma ̄n.d.a4.1.239–40,Va ̄yu100.133, and 102.132,5, pratisargaalso occurs with the meaning “destruction.”One reason for Kirfel’s preferring the meaning “further creation” was that hethought ofpañcalaks.an.aas indicating five successive blocks of material, so thatit functioned as a kind of table of contents, in which pratisargaought to standfor something that could come between sargaandvam.s ́a.This seems to have beenthe thinking behind Wilson’s translation of the pañcalaks.an.acomponents also(and presumably the thinking of the pandits who had assisted Colebrooke withthe translation which Wilson adopted), since he regarded vam.s ́aas “genealogyof gods and patriarchs,” which would fit in well with its position between “sec-ondary creation” and “reigns of the Manus,” while vam.s ́a ̄nucaritawas referredthe pura ̄n.as135"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"to “the princes of the solar and lunar races” whom one would expect to comelater. Yet the plain meaning ofvam.s ́ais “genealogy” in general rather than ofany particular group, and vam.s ́a ̄nucaritais equally general in its reference:“stories about those included in the genealogies.” Moreover, some of the pas-sages in Kirfel’s vam.s ́asection include stories (e.g. Va ̄yu65.144–59), while hisvam.s ́a ̄nucaritasection has passages in it which are purely genealogical (e.g. Va ̄yu88.62–77). From the way in which these vam.s ́aandvam.s ́a ̄nucarita laks.an.asaremixed together, it would appear that they were never intended to be taken as“sections” which could be neatly carved out and distinguished from each other,but rather they were seen as “strands,” interwoven with each other into patternswhich could vary from one Pura ̄n.a to another.Today more flexible interpretations ofpañcalaks.an.aare available alongsidethose of Kirfel and Wilson. Greg Bailey sees the pañcalaks.an.ascheme as markingthe Pura ̄n.ic genre as a whole, and controlling the contents of individual Pura ̄n.asonly “in varying degrees of completeness or fragmentation according to theempirical and ideological conditions determining their composition and recita-tion” (Bailey 1995: 13 n. 7). Velcheru Narayana Rao sees pañcalaks.an.aas “theideological frame that transforms whatever content is incorporated into thatframe” (Doniger 1993: 87). It does not refer to contents of the Pura ̄n.as but tothe world-view which is imposed upon whatever contents any given Pura ̄n.a mayhave, Seen thus, it is of no importance that it occupies so little space in thePura ̄n.as overall:Since the ideas ofpañcalaks.an.aare tacitly assumed in the Brahminic worldview,they do not even appear in every Pura ̄n.a and do not constitute a sizeable length ofthe text even when they appear. (Doniger 1993: 87–8)Before leaving the subject oflaks.an.asit is necessary to mention briefly theclaim of the Bha ̄gavatato be das ́alaks.an.a(Bha ̄gavata2.10.1, 12.7.9). Thisexpanded list is more likely to represent a conscious self-aggrandizement on thepart of the Bha ̄gavatathan a new stage in the development of the Pura ̄n.asgenerally. Again, its components may be taken to indicate an overall perspective,rather than to function as a table of contents. In the introduction to his trans-lation of the Bha ̄gavata, Tagare lists the commentators who have assigned oneof the das ́alaks.an.ato each ofskandhas3–12, but says that this “traditional appli-cation” is no more than “broadly justifiable,” since “there is so much overlap-ping and repetition of these topics beyond the Skandhas which are supposed torepresent them” (Tagare 1976: xxiii–xxxiii).Classification Versus ContentsWilson was so convinced that all Pura ̄n.as ought to contain five blocks ofpañcalaks.an.amaterial that he produced a theory to account for their failure 136freda matchett"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"to include the “five topics” in sufficient abundance. They were, he decided, “thepartial and adulterated representatives of an earlier class of Pura ̄n.as” (Wilson1961: vi), embellished and altered in the interests of sectarianism so that theypromoted the worship of one particular god, usually Vis.n.u or S ́iva.The idea of sectarianism is one which has been imposed upon the Hindu tra-dition by Western scholars. They saw Vedic religion as the equivalent of theWestern Catholic church, from which various “sects” had broken away, becom-ing “cut off ” (the literal meaning of the Latin “sectum”) from the central coreof their ancient tradition. But this model of an ancient rock from which seg-ments can be separated, is not an appropriate one for Hinduism. Julius Lipner’smetaphor of “an ancient banyan. . . an interconnected collection of trees andbranches in which the same life-sap flows” is much more appropriate (Lipner1994: 5), opening up a perspective in which different branches of the Hindu tra-dition can be linked together without declaring one to be a later development orbreakaway from another. In other words, the bhaktielement found in thePura ̄n.as is as ancient a rooting of this banyan as the Vedic one, even though itmay have taken longer to bear fruit in terms of texts and historically discerniblemovements.Whether or not sectarianism is an appropriate word to use in this context, thePura ̄n.as classify themselves as belonging to three groups, each connected withone of the gun.asof Sa ̄m.khya psychocosmology and thus with one of the divini-ties of the trimu ̄rti.Vis.n.u,Na ̄rada,Bha ̄gavata,Garud.a,Padma, and Va r a ̄haaresa ̄ttvic and therefore associated with Vis.n.u;Matsya,Ku ̄rma,Lin.ga,S ́iva,Skanda,andAgniare ta ̄masic (S ́iva); Brahma ̄n.d.a,Brahmavaivarta,Ma ̄rkan.d.eya,Bhavis.ya,Va ̄mana, and Brahma ̄are ra ̄jasic (Brahma ̄). This division is found in Padma5.263.81–4, and the connection with the trimu ̄rtiis given by Matsya53.68–9(although these verses say that Agni, as well as S ́iva, is praised in the ta ̄masicPura ̄n.as, and acknowledges the existence of mixed Pura ̄n.as also, linked withSarasvatı ̄). It might appear to strengthen Wilson’s theory that the earlierpañcalaks.an.amaterial had been displaced by later sectarian texts, but in fact thisneat threefold grouping, assigning exactly one-third of the Eighteen to eachgun.a, is entirely artificial.To begin with, this is not the only self-classification given by the Pura ̄n.as,although it is by far the best-known: Rocher quotes “an alternative, fivefold sub-division, with pura ̄n.as dedicated to five different gods” (Brahma ̄, Su ̄ rya, Agni,S ́iva, and Vis.n.u), found in the Skanda(Rocher 1986: 21). Furthermore, there areno Pura ̄n.as which proclaim Brahma ̄ as the Supreme God, since Brahma ̄ does notappear to have been regarded in this light on any significant scale (cf. Biardeau1981: 175–8). Even Wilson was not convinced that the Pura ̄n.as listed in thera ̄jasic division ought to be connected with Brahma ̄, and pointed out that thereis a S ́a ̄kta tendency in some of those included in this list (e.g. Ma ̄rkan.d.eya,Brahmavaivarta; Wilson 1961: xii). But even if this traditional division of thePura ̄n.as is seen as Vais.n.ava, S ́aiva, and S ́a ̄kta, it is still misleading, since thereare comparatively few Pura ̄n.as which are devoted exclusively to the worship ofone deity. There are some which can be described unambiguously as Vais.n.avathe pura ̄n.as137"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"(e.g. Vis.n.u,Bha ̄gavata) or S ́aiva (e.g. S ́iva), but these are in the minority. TheMatsyahas passages of Vais.n.ava and S ́aiva tendency in roughly equal propor-tions; the Va ̄manahas different portions centered upon Vis.n.u, S ́iva, and Devı ̄; theKu ̄rma, as has already been noted, shows traces of both Pa ̄ñcara ̄tra and Pa ̄s ́upatashaping; the Brahmamay be centered upon the worship of Kr.s.n.a in Orissa asJaganna ̄tha, but there are also passages which praise Su ̄ rya and his temple atKon.arka, and S ́iva, worshipped at Eka ̄mra; the inclusion of the Devı ̄ma ̄ha ̄tmyaintheMa ̄rkan.d.eyasuggests a S ́a ̄kta tendency, but apart from this there is little toconnect this Pura ̄n.a with any divinity.It may be that the classification of the Pura ̄n.as under the heading of the threegun.aswas never meant to affiliate them with the Great Gods ofbhakti.Just as thenumber 18 may have been intended to connect them with the Maha ̄bha ̄rata, sothe division into three may have been a way of suggesting that the Pura ̄n.as arepart of the basic fabric of the cosmos, just as the gun.asare, and just as muchlinked as the gun.asare with its basic processes (rajas: creation; sattva: mainte-nance;tamas: destruction). Each one embodies its own version of the bra ̄hman.icworld-view to which they all subscribe.The Religious World-view of the Pura ̄n.asWhen used as an adjective, the word pura ̄n.ameans “old.” As a noun it can meana past event, or a story of past events. Therefore the Pura ̄n.as have sometimesbeen regarded as traditional Indian history, compiled and transmitted in orderto preserve a record of the past. Nevertheless, the general consensus of schol-arly opinion has always been that the motives behind the Pura ̄n.as’ compositionwere religious and ideological rather than antiquarian or historical. They areinterested in the past, not for its own sake but as a repository of values for thepresent and future. They are purveyors of a comprehensive religious world-viewrather than of historical information, a world-view which reflects both thebra ̄hman.ic ideology which shaped their development and the popular elementswhich they incorporated (cf. Brockington 1987). The features of this world-vieware not identical in all the Pura ̄n.as, even if “all” is restricted only to the Eighteen. But there is enough consistency of viewpoint among them to allowone to sketch out a coherent picture, provided that one remembers that this is asimplified outline.The Pura ̄n.ic cosmos has been aptly described by Madeleine Biardeau as “theuniverse ofbhakti” (l’univers de labhakti, Biardeau 1981: 149, 172). By this shemeans a cosmos in which the elements of the Vedic world-view have beenrearranged so as to be transformed into a universe where one supreme God isthe overarching Reality, the ultimate object of all worship. This God’s name maybe Vis.n.u, S ́iva, or Devı ̄, but the role and status are the same whatever the name:this is the God who is both the all-containing, all-pervading Reality in which138freda matchett"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"time and space exist, and the accessible and gracious Lord whom worshippersmay encounter in a loving relationship.It would thus be possible to speak of Pura ̄n.ic religion as monotheistic. Yet thePura ̄n.as bring together a great many mythical themes, and in doing so provideseveral frameworks into which various divine figures can be fitted at differentlevels. There is the “triple form” (trimu ̄rti) in which the cosmic functions of cre-ation, maintenance, and destruction are personified by the forms of Brahma ̄,Vis.n.u, and S ́iva respectively. There are the avata ̄ras, the “descents” which theSupreme God makes into the human context. These were originally associatedwith Vis.n.u alone, and perhaps started from a nucleus of four found in theNa ̄ra ̄yan.ı ̄yaparvan, a late section of the Maha ̄bha ̄rata(boar, man-lion, dwarf,human being, Mbh.12.337.35). Within the Pura ̄n.as lists of different length arefound (e.g. Matsya47.237–48/Va ̄yu98.71–104/Brahma ̄n.d.a2.3.73.72–105a: 3divine and 7 human forms; Bha ̄gavata1.3.6–26: 22 forms: Garud.a1.202: 19),only occasionally (e.g. Agni2.1–16.27) coinciding with the eventual standardlist of 10: fish, tortoise, boar, man-lion, dwarf, Paras ́ura ̄ma, Ra ̄ma Da ̄s ́arathi,Kr.s.n.a (or Balara ̄ma), Buddha, and Kalki. These figures open up different seamsof Vais.n.ava mythology, making room within it for another supreme figure besidesVis.n.u himself. This is Kr.s.n.a, already the Supreme God of the Bhagavadgı ̄ta ̄, andsupplied by the Pura ̄n.as (e.g. Vis.n.u5;Bha ̄gavata10) with a biography which gavehim a universal appeal in human terms as well as divine. Although the Pura ̄n.asalso present S ́iva as having avata ̄ras(e.g. S ́iva:S ́atarudrasam.hita ̄), these appear tobe modeled on their Vais.n.ava counterparts. The network of divinities whichseems to be more authentically S ́aiva appears to be that provided by S ́iva’s family:his wife Uma ̄/Pa ̄rvatı ̄ (herself a form of the Supreme Godhead seen as feminine)and their sons Gan.es ́a and Skanda/Ka ̄rttikeya.In whatever form the Supreme God may be envisaged, the Pura ̄n.as are ingeneral agreement as to the temporal and spatial dimensions of the cosmos overwhich he/she is supreme. Time is projected on two scales, human and divine. Aday and night of the gods is the equivalent of a human year, so that a divine yearis 360 human years. As in the Maha ̄bha ̄rata, human “history” is divided into four ages (yugas), the kr.ta,treta ̄,dva ̄para, and kali, joined together by “twilight”periods. Each yugalasts for thousands of divine years, but their durationbecomes progressively shorter and their religious and moral characteristics dete-riorate from one age to the next, until they are renewed as the next kr.tayugacomes round. A thousand of these caturyugaperiods constitute a day of Brahma ̄,which is called a kalpa. (Although Brahma ̄ is never regarded as supreme in thePura ̄n.as his status, as creator of the trailokya, the triple world of gods, mortals,and demons, is much higher than that of the other devas, and he therefore hasmuch longer days than theirs.)A significant feature of the yugascheme, in both the Maha ̄bha ̄rataand thePura ̄n.as, is that the time of narration is somewhere in the kaliyuga, usuallyregarded as having begun with the death of Kr.s.n.a (cf. Bh1.18.6;Vis.n.u5.38.8/Brahma212.8). This cannot really be said to be a pessimistic view of life.the pura ̄n.as139"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"Not only is the kr.tayugasomewhere in the future, but there are pura ̄n.ic passageswhich say that moks.ais easier to attain in the kaliyugathan in any other age (e.g.Vis.n.u6.2.15–18). Yet it does suggest that perfection belongs to the past –perhaps one reason why the Pura ̄n.as want to associate themselves with it.Another timescale used in the Pura ̄n.as is that ofmanvantaras, periods ruledover by a primal king and his descendants. There are 14 of these in all, 6 in thepast, the present one (that of Vaivasvata Manu), and 7 more to come. These areregarded as making up a kalpa, and thus being equal to a thousand caturyugaperiods (although the division of 1,000 by 14 produces so many decimal piontsthat it is hard to believe that manvantaras, caturyugas, and kalpaswere originallypart of the same system). Again, the present time is seen as coming near thecenter of the kalpasystem, since the present kalpa, the vara ̄ha(the era of theBoar), is the beginning of the second half of Brahma ̄’s lifetime. At the end ofeachkalpathe dissolution (pralaya) of the trailokyatakes place, to be followed byits recreation by Brahma ̄ at the beginning of the next. At the end of Brahma ̄’slifetime a more radical pralayaoccurs, however, when all being is destroyed,except that of the Supreme Being itself.The Pura ̄n.ic world-view is anthropocentric in that it gives human beings thecentral place in its systems ofmanvantarasandkalpas. But it also places themwithin a vast time-span, so that they could easily be dwarfed into insignificanceby it. In a similar way, it places human beings at the center of a vast expanse ofspace. Bha ̄ratavars.a, the territory which they inhabit, is one of 9 regions (in anearlier scheme it may have been 4) in an island-continent (dvı ̄pa) namedJa ̄mbu ̄dvı ̄pa. Around this island-continent spreads the Ocean of Milk, andaround this spreads another dvı ̄pa.In all there are 7 dvı ̄pas, with 7 oceans sur-rounding them, extending to the Loka ̄loka mountains, the boundary betweenthe world (loka) and what is not the world (aloka).This is the horizontally extended cosmos, but the Pura ̄n.as also have a viewof the cosmos as extended vertically, through different upper lokasinhabited bygods, divine seers, and other celestial beings, and through lower levels (talas)inhabited by serpents (na ̄gas) and demons (asuras). It is these upper and lowerregions which make up the trailokya, together with the earth, the home ofhuman beings and other animals. The lower levels are not hells, although hells(narakas) also exist. Through all these regions beings may transmigrate insam.sa ̄ra, the cycle of rebirths which is regulated by karma, and from which moks.abrings release. In all this expanse, only Bha ̄rata is the home of human beings aswe know them. It is the only place where the caturyugasystem operates, wherethe religious exercises of sacrifice, asceticism, and giving are practiced, the onlyplace from which moks.acan be attained (Vis.n.u2.3.19–26).However, in this universe ofbhaktineither sacrifice, asceticism, nor giving isabsolutely central. The chief quality required in each human life is devotion tothe Supreme God, either in his/her own transcendent form or in some manifesta-tion. Whether expressed in terms of reflective, thoughtful piety (e.g. by BharatainVis.n.u2.13.9–11), or in displays of extreme emotion (e.g. by Prahla ̄da inBha ̄gavata7.4.38–41) the important factor in bhaktiis its power to bind together140freda matchett"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"the human and the divine, not in bonds of duty or domination, but in a rela-tionship of loving protection on the divine side and loving service on the human.Thus the religion ofbhakticonsists of honoring all aspects in which theSupreme God makes his/her presence manifest in the trailokya. Holy cities arelovingly described in the Pura ̄n.as (e.g. Skanda; Ka ̄s ́ı ̄khan.d.a;Na ̄rada; Uttarabha ̄ga48–61); holy rivers are enumerated (e.g. S ́iva:Vid yes ́varasam.hita ̄12;Garud.a1.81); instructions are given for the construction and worship of images (e.g.Vis.n.udharmottara3.44–85), for making pilgrimages (e.g. Va ̄yu110–11);Na ̄rada:Uttarabha ̄ga62–3;Skanda3.51), and for the carrying out of special pu ̄ja ̄s(Na ̄rada:Uttarabha ̄ga43;S ́iva:Kot.irudrasam.hita ̄38–9) and vratas(Na ̄rada4.110–24;Matsya54–82;Garud.a1.116–37).Bhaktigives rise to a highly sacramental formof worship which nourishes itself upon all the traces of the divine encounterwith humanity. Even sinners who do not worship are saved by the God ofbhakti,for instance, the dying Aja ̄mila who cries “Na ̄ra ̄yan.a” because it is the name ofhis youngest son (Bha ̄gavata6.1–2), or Devara ̄ja who is saved by accidentallyhearing the S ́iva recited (S ́iva1.2.15–40). It may appear the karmais set asideand any idea ofdharmaoverthrown. Yet this is not the case. The Pura ̄n.as containmany passages in which the rules ofvarn.a ̄s ́ramadharmaare set out firmly andclearly, sometimes introduced by the idea that this is what God wants (cf. Vis.n.u3.8.1–19).Dharmaand the four purus.a ̄rthas(dharma, artha, ka ̄ma,andmoks.a)are still in place, but they are now transformed and transcended by bhakti.The Pura ̄n.as TodayAlthough present-day Hindus may refer to the Vedas as the foundation of theirtradition, it is the Pura ̄n.as which give the myths and rituals by which their reli-gious life is sustained. Even among the diaspora in Britain there are somePura ̄n.as which have been recited in their entirety from time to time. (Lipner1994: 153, 339–40). The Bha ̄gavatahas not only become the foundation text ofseveral Kr.s.n.aitesamprada ̄yasin India, but in the second half of the twentiethcentury has become familiar to Kr.s.n.a-worshippers throughout the world,thanks to the activities of the International Society for Krishna Conscious-ness, an American organization derived directly, through its founder A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, from the Kr.s.n.aite tradition started byCaitanya in sixteenth-century Bengal.At the level of scholarly study, the Pura ̄n.as have received plentiful attentionin the last quarter of the twentieth century. Rocher’s comprehensive survey, pub-lished by Harrassowitz in 1986 as part of their History of Indian Literature, hasalready been mentioned, and is a work to which all subsequent Pura ̄n.a scholarsare deeply indebted (cf. Doniger 1993: viii). Anthologies of Pura ̄n.ic myths, trans-lated into English, compiled and introduced by Wendy O’Flaherty (1975) and byCornelia Dimmitt and J. A. B. van Buitenen (1978), have enabled a wider rangeof readers to discover the Pura ̄n.as for themselves, while in The Origins of Evil inthe pura ̄n.as141"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"Hindu Mythology(1976), O’Flaherty has shown how the analysis of Pura ̄n.icmyths can yield profounder and more sophisticated answers to some religiousquestions than any philosophical approach.In 1982 the University of Tübingen’s Pura ̄n.a Research Project started, whichhas produced valuable tools for pura ̄n.ic study: the work done by Peter Schreinerand Renate Söhnen, (1987, 1989) on the Brahma ̄pura ̄n.a, the two-volume Epicand Pura ̄n.ic Bibliography(Stietencron et al. 1992) which includes a wide range ofeditions of the Pura ̄n.as, as well as all works written about them up to 1985. Itslatest publication, Greg Bailey’s introduction to and translation of the first partof the Gan.es ́apura ̄n.a(1995) is much more comprehensive than its title suggests.It is an introduction to the whole pura ̄n.ic genre, which it approaches in a newway. Instead of adopting the methods of the text-historical school, which breakup pura ̄n.ic contents into smaller pieces and arrange them in chronological orderso as to show historical development, Bailey takes the Pura ̄n.as as single literaryunits, and exposes within them the semantic structures which shape their con-tents, both the surface structure provided by the pañcalaks.an.aformula and thedeeper structure of “a bhaktiideology and its attendant praxis” (Bailey 1995: 15).There have been some influential conferences on the Pura ̄n.as during the1980s and 1990s. The University of Wisconsin’s Madison Conference on thePura ̄n.as in 1985 brought together an international group of scholars whosepapers led to the publication ofPura ̄n.a Perennisin 1993, while the DubrovnikInternational Conference on the Pura ̄n.as and Epics held in 1997 was the first ofa continuing series of gatherings. Its proceedings have already been publishedunder the title Composing a Tradition: Concepts, Techniques and Relationships(Brockington and Schreiner 1999).As the twenty-first century begins, the study of the Pura ̄n.as appears to be ingood health. No doubt as the century unfolds scholars will receive more andmore help from the compilation of electronic texts and other technological devel-opments. Cooperation between text-historical and structuralist approaches mayresult in a clearer understanding of those features of the Pura ̄n.as which todayare puzzling. But in the last analysis the Pura ̄n.as do not belong to the scholarlycommunity, and they will continue to be important even if the latter shouldneglect them completely. Their rich and variegated mythology creates a totalcosmos in which the bhaktivalues of all forms of theistic Hinduism are preservedand flourish. So long as even some of them continue to be recited and heard, solong as the stories which they contain are retold and remembered, they willembody and proclaim these values in the emerging global context in which theplanet’s religious traditions will share their insights with each other.ReferencesBailey, Greg. 1995.

What exactly do we mean by Tamil – therelatively formal language associated primarily with writing and public oratory,or the full gamut of regionally and socially based spoken dialects? And even ifwe were concerned only with the former, we would still have to confront the evo-lution of the literary language during its 2,000-year history. The slipperiness of the terms “Hindu” and “Hinduism” are well documented in recent scholar-ship on South Asian religion and culture; and the notion that these terms, ascommonly construed, are relatively recent constructions, heavily influenced byIndia’s colonial history, is now widely accepted (Frykenberg 1989). And finally,the term “literature” can be interpreted in various restricted and embracivesenses. Within the well established tradition of Tamil grammar and poetics,ilakkiyam, commonly translated as “literature,” implies a special kind of lan-guage usage that is governed by precisely defined rules of grammar and literaryconvention as well as a particular milieu in which texts were composed and cir-culated. But the corpus of texts delineated by this term is certainly too narrowfor the agenda of this volume.In this essay the phrase “Tamil Hindu literature” will be interpreted liberally,if not especially rigorously, to include texts conforming to a wide range of lin-guistic registers and styles, composed at various points in time, and associatedwith various religious milieux which in modern terms would usually be labelled“Hindu.” Further, all of the specific textual types treated here would be viewedas appropriate subjects of study in the curriculum of a Tamil Department in amodern university in Tamilnadu, though they were engendered and originallycirculated in a number of different cultural milieux."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"Hindu Gods in Classical Tamil PoetryOne of the great achievements of Tamil culture in the field of literature is thecorpus of over 2,300 poems collected in the eight so-called can.kam anthologies.According to legend, the authors of these poems were members of a literaryacademy (can.kam) that flourished in the city of Maturai under the patronage ofthe Pa ̄n.t.iya kings. The legend of the Maturai Tamil can.kam may or may not bebased upon historical fact, but no one who knows these poems can doubt thattheir authors shared a poetic grammar and vocabulary. The poems presupposetheir audience’s familiarity with a shared repertoire of dramatic situations, geographical settings, characters, and poetic figures, and these are defined in the earliest extant Tamil treatise on the principles of grammar and poetics,Tolka ̄ppiyam.The earliest poems in this corpus were probably composed duringthe first few centuries ce.The poems included in five of the eight anthologies are classified as poems ofthe “interior world” (akam). The “interior world” is populated by a cast of char-acters who are identified only by the roles they play in the dramatized situationsrepresented in the poems. Each poem depicts a moment in the story of two loversthrough the words of one of the two or one of several other characters, such asthe girl’s close friend, the girl’s mother, the man’s other lover, and a few others.An especially striking feature of many of these poems is their setting. In akampoetry landscape serves as a mirror of mood. Classical Tamil poetics recognizesfive landscapes – mountains, forest, seashore, the riverine tract, and arid land –each of which carries a particular emotive association. In the poems mood is signalled by specific features or “germinal elements” (karupporul.) of these landscapes, which include not only obvious elements such as mountain pools,rivers, coastal backwaters, flora, and fauna, but also human inhabitants of theseregions – for instance, fisherfolk and mountain tribes – and their customarybeliefs and practices, including the gods they worship.Complementing the “interior world” is the public “exterior world” (pur ̄am),a world where warriors are acclaimed for their valor, kings are praised for theirgenerosity, and poets instruct their patrons in right action and the nature of life.Pur ̄am poems, by and large, offer their audience scenes painted in bold, clearstrokes, and here the poets generally do not subtly orchestrate features of settingto suggest nuances of mood as in akam poems.According to Tolka ̄ppiyamthe gods who preside over the mountains, forest,seashore, riverine tract, and arid land are, respectively, Ce ̄yo ̄n ̄, “the Red One,”Ma ̄yo ̄n ̄, “the Dark One,” Varun.an ̄, the god of the sea and wind, Ve ̄ntan ̄, “theKing,” and Kor ̄r ̄avai, goddess of war. Ce ̄yo ̄n ̄is an alternate name for Murukan ̄,“the Beautiful One,” a very popular deity in Tamilnadu, who in the course oftime coalesced with the Sanskritic god Skanda, son of S ́iva, though the icono-graphy and mythology of Murukan ̄maintains features not generally associatedwith Sanskritic images of Skanda. Ma ̄yo ̄n ̄, also known as Ma ̄l, “the Great One”or “the Dark One,” became identified with Vis.n.u. Finally, Ve ̄ntan ̄, “the king,”refers to Indra, King of the gods.146norman cutler"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"It is important to stress that while some poems included in the can.kamanthologies contain references to these gods or to rites performed in their honor,these are not religious poems in the sense one would ordinarily understand theterm. In virtually all cases these poems aesthetically and rhetorically focus onthe actions and emotions of human beings in relation to one another and totheir natural environment. References to gods and religious practices are sub-sidiary to these concerns, and when they do occur, they may be tinged withirony. For example, in certain akam poems the heroine or her friend mockMurukan ̄’s priest for attempting to cure the ailing heroine through rites ofexorcism, when the actual cause for her illness is separation from her lover.There are however, two significant exceptions to this generalization. The rel-atively late can.kam anthology, Paripa ̄t.al(ca. fifth century ce), contains a numberof poems that celebrate the gods Cevve ̄l.(another name for Ce ̄yo ̄n ̄/Murukan ̄) andTiruma ̄l. (The honorific prefix “tiru” is equivalent to Sanskrit “s ́rı ̄”.) And addi-tionally, the can.kam corpus contains a long “guide poem” (a ̄r ̄r ̄uppat.ai) in praiseof Murukan ̄calledTirumuruka ̄r ̄r ̄uppat.ai(ca. fifth century). The latter is modeledon guide poems found in Pur ̄ana ̄nu ̄r ̄u,the principal can.kam anthology devotedto pur ̄am poetry. In these poems a poet praises his patron’s realm, his wealth andhis generosity in conversation with another poet whom he has met on the road.InTirumuruka ̄r ̄r ̄uppat.ai, standard elements of the guide poem genre – poet,patron, patron’s realm, patron’s gifts – are transposed to a devotional register,becoming, in turn, Murukan ̄’s devotee, the god, the six hills which are said to be Murukan ̄’s favorite dwelling places in Tamilnadu, and the grace Murukan ̄bestows upon his devotees.The Canonized Poems of the Tamil Vais.n.ava and S ́aiva SaintsTirumuruka ̄r ̄r ̄uppat.ai, uniquely among the compositions included in the can.kampoetic corpus, also was canonized in Tamil S ́aiva sectarian tradition. (No poemsfrom the can.kam corpus are included in the equivalent canon of TamilVa i s.n.avism.) Tirumuruka ̄r ̄r ̄uppat.ai’s dual status is a reminder that early Tamil lit-erary practices, which probably flourished in a courtly context, and the some-what later poetic expressions of devotion for S ́iva and Vis.n.u are not unrelated.This is apparent in the large number of canonized bhakti poems that adapt and incorporate literary conventions associated with the can.kam poems. Mostfamously, in many Vais.n.ava bhakti poems the poet assumes a female voice andexpresses love for Vis.n.u in an idiom modeled closely on can.kam akam poems.1Nevertheless, the two poetic corpera significantly differ from one another inform, content, or function.The period extending from the seventh through the ninth centuries was thegolden age of bhakti in the Tamil country. During this period temples of S ́iva and Vis.n.u became a prominent feature of the Tamil landscape, and communitiesof bhaktas who hailed from a wide spectrum of social backgrounds and weretamil hindu literature147"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"united by their devotion, became a part of the Tamil social landscape. Alsoduring this period the Tamil Vais.n.ava and S ́aiva saints gave voice to their reli-gious fervor in poetry. The saints and their poems subsequently became definingelements in Tamil Vais.n.ava and S ́aiva sectarian traditions: many of the poemswere incorporated in the liturgy of temple worship, and images of the saintswere enshrined in the temples along with the images of the gods themselves.Tamil Vais.n.avism recognizes 12 saint-poets, the a ̄l ̄va ̄rs (“they who areimmersed [in their devotion for Vis.n.u]”); and the poems they composed, knowncollectively as the “four thousand sacred compositions” (Na ̄la ̄yirat-tiviya-pirapantam) are frequently referred to in the tradition as “the Tamil Veda.” Beginning around the twelfth century, these poems came to be recited rituallyas part of the routine of worship in Tamil Vais.n.ava temples, and, in keeping with their status as sacred scripture, they also became the object of erudite theologically-oriented commentaries.In Tamil S ́aiva tradition the match between the categories of saint and sacredscripture also overlap, but not quite so precisely. Tamil S ́aivism recognizes 63saints or na ̄yan ̄ma ̄r (“leaders”) whose legendary life stories are told in thetwelfth-century hagiography, Periya Pura ̄n.am. Periya Pura ̄n.amis included as thetwelfth and last of the Tirumur ̄ai, or “sacred compendia” of poems, which carrycanonical status in Tamil S ́aiva tradition. Like the Vais.n.ava a ̄l ̄va ̄r poems, theyare considered to be the equal of the Vedas in sacredness. Some, but not all ofthe na ̄yan ̄ma ̄r composed poems that are included in the Tirumur ̄ai, and some,but not all of the poems included in the Tirumur ̄ai, were composed by na ̄yan ̄ma ̄r.Also, like the poems of the a ̄l ̄va ̄rs, poems from the Tirumur ̄ai, were incorporatedinto the routines of temple worship, but unlike the former, prior to modern times,one does not find written theological commentaries on these poems. Neverthe-less, traditional S ́aiva scholars often include citations from this corpus in oraldiscourses on theological topics.The Tamil bhakti poets utilized many literary models – Tamil can.kam poems,folksongs, Sanskrit hymns of praise (stotras), and even Vedic hymns – thus pro-ducing a corpus of great variety with roots in both earlier Tamil and Sanskritsources. Nonetheless, in broad terms, Tamil bhakti poems can be distinguishedas a poetic genre in a number of ways: they employ a relatively simple dictionand phraseology modeled after the rhythms of speech; they are filled with allusions to Hindu myths and provide “word pictures” of the Hindu gods in fulliconographic detail; they celebrate the sacredness of particular places wherelocal Tamil forms of S ́iva and Vis.n.u are enshrined; they are frequently set tomusic. But perhaps the most distinctive feature of these poems is their emphasison the poet’s own experience and the relationship between poet and God.Tamil devotees of S ́iva and Vis.n.u perceive the saints’ poems as spiritual auto-biographies in which the saints reveal their innermost experience and set anexample for others, or, to make the point somewhat differently, as “verbal embodi-ments of their authors’ experience of divinity” (Cutler 1987: 112). Tamil bhaktipoems blur the boundary between devotee and saint by providing a paradigmupon which devotees model their own experience of divinity. From another, but148norman cutler"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"not unrelated, perspective, these poems can be viewed as a poetic corollary of atheology of embodiment. That is to say, just as the presence of divinity is under-stood to be literally embodied in a properly consecrated stone or metal image ofgod, the saint’s communion with divinity is understood to be embodied in theritual recitation of his or her poetry. All who participate in the ritual perfor-mance of the saint’s poem reenact the saint’s experience of communion with the deity. And this further highlights the close relationship in Tamil traditionbetween bhakti poetry and temple worship, in contrast to some later bhaktitraditions that express contempt for temples as a relic of a stale religiousestablishment.2This contrast can, in part, be explained historically. Whereas in Tamilnadu the emergence of bhakti coincided with the origins of templeworship (ca. sixth century ce), proponents of some of the later bhakti traditionsviewed temples as an established religious institution which had lost its vitality.Learned Literature of the Court and the TempleWhile the poems of the Tamil Vais.n.ava and S ́aiva saints nowadays are appreci-ated for their aesthetic as well as for their religious value, prior to modern timesthe saints’ poems were not included in the curriculum of institutionalized liter-ary study and performance where literati found patronage in courtly and templecontexts. The period immediately following the age of the can.kam poems wit-nessed the composition of a number of collections of didactic verses, on the onehand, and long narrative poems, on the other.3The authors of some of these texts were Buddhists, but an even larger number were Jains. By the twelfth century,however, the influence of Buddhism and Jainism in the Tamil cultural sphere hadwaned considerably, and Vais.n.avism, to some extent, and S ́aivism, to an evengreater extent, had become powerful forces in Tamil literary culture. Beginningaround the ninth century a number of genres came to dominate formal literarycomposition and education, and these are commonly grouped in two broad cat-egories: pirapantam(Sanskrit:prabandha) and ka ̄ppiyam(=ka ̄vyam)/pura ̄n.am(Sanskrit:ka ̄vya/pura ̄n.a). The latter are long narratives in verse. Many are basedon the story-lines of the Sanskrit epics and pura ̄n.as, but they are often more poet-ically sophisticated and elaborate than their Sanskrit counterparts. The formeris a very heterogenous collection of genres, some, but not all of which clearlybuild on the conventions of can.kam poetry. One common feature of pirapantampoems is that their constituent verses are sequentially related, and this is onefeature that distinguishes these works from the can.kam anthologies. Anotherfeature that distinguishes many (but not all) of these poems from the can.kampoetry is their focus on Hindu deities and sacred places.Traditionally the poems of the Tamil bhakti saints and medieval learned literature, even when devoted to religious subjects, inhabited different culturalterrains; but there is one work that belongs to both domains (much as Tirumuruka ̄r ̄r ̄uppat.aiis included both in the can.kam corpus and in the S ́aivatamil hindu literature149"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Tirumur ̄ai). This is Tirukko ̄vaiya ̄r, a learned poem attributed to the S ́aiva saint-poet Ma ̄n.ikkava ̄cakar. Though, by historical accident, he is not numberedamong the 63 na ̄yan ̄ma ̄r,4Ma ̄n.ikkava ̄cakar is nevertheless one of the mosthighly revered of the Tamil S ́aiva poet-saints. The eighth Tirumur ̄aiis composedof his two works: Tiruva ̄cakam, a collection of 51 poems of various genres, all ofwhich conform fairly closely to the model of bhakti poetry described above, anda pirapantam poem, Tirukko ̄vaiya ̄r, a much more difficult, learned poem whichexemplifies a genre called ko ̄vai. The ko ̄vai, perhaps more than any other post-can.kam genre, evolved from the conventional apparatus of can.kam poetry: thepersonae and situations represented in verses of a ko ̄vai are lifted directly fromthe akam poetic tradition.One feature that sets apart the verses of a ko ̄vaipoem from those of thecan.kam era anthologies of akam poems is the sequential arrangement of itsverses: the storyline which is merely implicit in the akam anthologies becomesthe dominant principle of textual structure in Tirukko ̄vaiya ̄r. But there is alsoanother feature that distinguishes the verses of a ko ̄vaipoem from earlier akamverses: a ko ̄vai celebrates either a human or a divine hero by folding referencesto this hero into each verse of the poem, for instance, through a simile orthrough a description of the setting for an incident depicted in the verse. InMa ̄n.ikkava ̄cakar’s ko ̄vai the hero is S ́iva, and thus each ofTirukko ̄vaiya ̄r’s 400verses contains a S ́aiva element. In a certain sense the author of every ko ̄vaipoem engages in a balancing act. From one perspective the poetics of akampoetry dominates this genre. The narrative framework of a ko ̄vai poem is a legacyof akam poetry, as are the personae who populate the narrative and the specificsituations represented in each verse. But from another perspective the foremostpurpose of the author of a ko ̄vai poem is to praise a heroic figure, usually eithera king or a deity, and the akam narrative framework serves a means to this end.Theko ̄vaiis not the only pirapantamgenre that facilitates the celebration ofeither a human or a divine hero(ine). Another genre, popular beginning fromthe early fifteenth century is called pil.l.aittamil ̄, “a Tamil [poem][in praise of] a child.” In a pil.l.aittamil ̄poem “a poet assumes a maternal voice to praise anextraordinary being (deity, prophet, saint, or hero), envisioning him or her in theform of a baby” (Richman 1997: 3). Not all pil.l.aittamil ̄poems are devoted toHindu subjects, though Hindu gods, goddesses, and saints are well representedin the corpus ofpil.l.aittamil ̄literature.5In keeping with its status as a learned lit-erary genre, the form and content ofpil.l.aittamil ̄poems are closely governed byconvention, though this genre does not, like the ko ̄vai, closely model itself oncan.kam poetry. All pil.l.aittamil ̄poems are structured in terms of ten sections,calledparuvam, each of which “takes as its subject matter a specific childhoodactivity: for example, a child giving the mother a kiss, a little girl bathing in theriver, or a little boy beating a toy drum” (Richman 1997: 10).While one of the Vais.n.ava bhakti poets, Periya ̄l ̄va ̄r (ninth century), adopteda maternal voice in his poems of devotion to the baby Kr.s.n.a, the first pil.l.aittamil ̄poem that fully articulates the paruvam structure is the Tiruccentu ̄r Pil.l.aittamil ̄composed by Pakal ̄ikku ̄ ttar (late fourteenth to early fifteenth centuries) in praise150norman cutler"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"of the god Murukan ̄, especially in his association with the seaside town ofTiruccentu ̄ r. Paula Richman has summarized the legend that accounts for thecomposition of this poem:According to tradition, Pakal ̄ikku ̄ ttar, originally a Vais.n.ava devotee, suffered ter-rible stomach pains for a long time. One day an ancestor who had been a devoteeof Murukan ̄(son ofS ́iva) appeared to him in a dream and asked him to sing a pil-laitamil. The poet then saw that sacred ash and a leaf had been bestowed uponhim. He awoke to find a palm leaf beside him upon which to compose poetry. Afterprayer to Lord Murukan ̄cured his illness, he composed his pillaittamil to the deityas manifested at the Tiruccentur shrine. (Richman 1997: 53–4)One finds here echoes of the legendary life story of Appar (seventh century)which tells how a stomach ailment played a critical role in securing the saint’sconversion from Jainism to S ́aivism. Since Appar’s story was firmly establishedin the Tamil S ́aiva hagiographic tradition prior to Pakal ̄ikku ̄ ttar’s lifetime, morelikely than not, the similarities in the biographies are not coincidental. But whilethe echoes of Appar’s biography in the later legend establish a linkage betweenthe pirapantam poem and Tamil S ́aiva bhakti tradition, the fact that Vais.n.avismhas replaced Jainism as the non-S ́aiva Other, indicates a significant shift in thesocio-religious environment in Tamilnadu between the seventh and the four-teenth centuries.Many Tamil poets, including Hindus, Muslims, and Christians, have composedpil.l.aittamil ̄poems. Besides Tiruccentu ̄r Pil.l.aittamil ̄, two of the best known pil.l.aittamil ̄poems devoted to Hindu subjects are Maturai Mı ̄n ̄a ̄t.ciyammai Pil.l.ait-tamil ̄by Kumarakuruparar (seventeenth century), which praises the goddessMı ̄n ̄a ̄t.ci, S ́iva’s consort in the great temple located in Maturai, and Ce ̄kkil ̄a ̄rPil.l.aittamil ̄by T. M ı ̄n ̄a ̄t.cicuntaram Pil.l.ai (nineteenth century) on Ce ̄kkil ̄a ̄r, theauthor of the canonical hagiography of the 63 Tamil S ́aiva saints, PeriyaPura ̄n.am(twelfth century). While the subjects ofpil.l.aittamil ̄poems, as well astheir sectarian and historical contexts, are quite varied, the exemplars of thisgenre do display certain common features. Most obvious is the paruvam struc-ture and the maternal voice that are central to the definition of the genre.Another feature common to many pil.l.aittamil ̄poems is the way poets intersperseimages of a god or hero imagined as a child with references to the subject’s heroicor gracious acts as an adult. These juxtapositions engender in a poem’s audiencea simultaneous sense of intimate affection and awe-filled wonder for its subject.6The Tamil literary category of pirapantam is traditionally counterposed to the category of pura ̄n.am or ka ̄vyam (or ka ̄ppiyam7). In Sanskrit, the categorypura ̄n.a, which denotes the primary textual repository of Hindu mythology, isoften linked with the category ofitiha ̄sa, which refers specifically to theMaha ̄bha ̄rataand the Ra ̄ma ̄yan.a.While a few of the Sanskrit texts included inthe realm ofitiha ̄sa-pura ̄n.aare noted for their poetic language, by and large thesetexts are noteworthy more for the stories they tell than for the manner oftheir telling. In contrast, in the world of Sanskrit arts and letters, the term ka ̄vyadenotes aesthetically refined poetry, and the “great ka ̄vyas” (maha ̄ka ̄vya) are tamil hindu literature151"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"long poems whose verses are embedded in a story line, and in many instancesthe latter is borrowed from the itiha ̄sa-pura ̄n.acorpus.Some of the Tamil texts which bear the appellation pura ̄n.am are baseddirectly on Sanskrit prototypes, but as David Shulman has observed, “they differgreatly from the Sanskrit originals both in style and in their perspective on themythological materials; unlike the Sanskrit pura ̄n.as, the Tamil adaptations are polished and compressed, and thus belong, in effect to the ka ̄vyagenre”(Shulman 1980: 30). The most celebrated of all Tamil ka ̄vya narratives isKampan ̄’s twelfth century rendering of the Ra ̄ma ̄yan.a. While Kampan ̄was famil-iar with Valmı ̄ki’s Sanskrit Ra ̄ma ̄yan.a, and his telling of the story correspondsto Valmı ̄ki’s fairly closely, some episodes are substantially different in the twoversions. But more importantly, Kampan ̄distingished himself as a consummatemaster of the poetic resources of the Tamil language, and in his hands theRa ̄ma ̄yan.astory became a vehicle for a literary tour de force. ConsequentlyKampan ̄’s Tamil Ra ̄ma ̄yan.ahas, for centuries, been honored as much, if notmore, for its literary merits as for its choice of subject. This accounts for theattention the text has long received from Tamil literary scholars irrespective oftheir sectarian affiliations.Another group of Tamil narratives categorized as pura ̄n.am are closely asso-ciated with particular geographical locations, specifically the sites of temples.These texts, known generically as sthalapura ̄n.a(“place pura ̄n.a”), relate legendsassociated with these sites and the local embodiments of S ́iva, Vis.n.u, and otherdeities enshrined there. The Tamil “place pura ̄n.as” constitute a very large corpus,and the literary quality of these texts is uneven. Many temple sites in Tamilnaduare the subjects of both a Tamil “place pura ̄n.a” and a Sanskrit counterpart,usually assigned to the genre of maha ̄tmya (“greatness”). Traditionally the Sanskrit maha ̄tmya is usually considered to be the source of the Tamil “placepura ̄n.a,” but in fact, in many instances the Tamil version may in fact predate the Sanskrit. While the influence of Brahmanic Hinduism is clearly apparent inboth Tamil and Sanskrit versions, these texts also include much material that is regionally distinctive. In his landmark study of Tamil S ́aiva “place pura ̄n.as”David Shulman describes the myths related in these texts as being “part of thewider world of Hindu mytholgy,” while he also points out that the authors ofthese texts took many of the classical myths “and adapted them to their own pur-poses, often transforming them considerably in the process” (Shulman 1980: 4).The Literature of Village Temple FestivalsFor the most part, the genres and texts discussed above were originally associ-ated with the culture of the courts of kings and local rulers or with Brahmanictemples. But this is by no means the only literature associated with Tamil Hinduism, broadly defined. The cults of Tamilnadu’s village deities are rich instories, many of which are regularly performed as dramas or as oral discourses,152norman cutler"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"and frequently these are set to music. Often the occasion for these performancesis an annual festival observed in a local deity’s honor, and in these instances the performance has ritual significance. Two recent studies focus on the cult ofDraupadı ̄, which is well represented in the villages of northeastern Tamilnaduand recitation/enactment of the Maha ̄bha ̄ratastory during the annual festivalperformed by Draupadı ̄’s devotees (Frasca 1988; Hiltebeitel 1988). A thirdfocuses on a genre known as “bow song” (vil pa ̄t.t.u), which is traditionally performed during festivals celebrated at the temples of local deities in the farsouthern region of Tamilnadu. (Blackburn 1988).Alf Hiltebeitel describes a process, instantiated in the Tamil Draupadı ̄ cult,“whereby the Maha ̄bha ̄ratais transposed into local, and for the most part village,South Indian traditions” (Hiltebeitel 1988: 131).8At the Draupadı ̄ festivals cel-ebrated in northeastern Tamilnadu, this transposed Maha ̄bha ̄ratais performedin three modes. The first of these, called piracan.kam, the most “textual” of thethree, consists of a recitation of episodes from the epic in Tamil by a professionalMaha ̄bha ̄ratareciter, known as a piracan.kiorpa ̄ratiya ̄r. Richard Frasca hasdescribedpiracan.kamas a musical narrative amalgamation of song (pa ̄t.t.u),musical chant, and exegetical prose” (quoted in Hiltebeitel 1988: 137). Moreoften than not the textual basis for piracan.kam is the Tamil version of theMaha ̄bha ̄ratacomposed in the fourteenth century by Villipputtu ̄r A ̄l ̄va ̄r, thoughreciters may also drawn upon other Tamil versions of the Maha ̄bha ̄rata. Thesecond mode is dramatic enactment, with song and dance, of episodes from theMaha ̄bha ̄ratain a style known as “street drama” (terukku ̄ttu). According toHiltebeitel, the Villi Pa ̄ratam“provides the skein that both genres [piracan.kamand terukku ̄ ttu] follow, but while the dramatists may know of Villi, ‘it is doubtfulthat they ever consult, and unlikely that many of them could consult hisPa ̄ratam’ ” (Hiltebeitel 1988: 138). Thus, unlike piracan.kam, the dramatic enact-ment of episodes from the Maha ̄bha ̄rataat Draupadı ̄ festivals is only loosely tiedto the classical textual tradition. The third level of performance takes the formof temple ritual, and Hiltebeitel has noted that whereas the piracan.kam “has as its main task to present the Pa ̄ratamas a ‘whole,’ ” the street drama “has asits main task to enact those aspects of the Pa ̄ratamthat have the greatest signifi-cance in relation to the festival’s period of highest ritual intensity” (Hiltebeitel1988: 140). During such periods it is not uncommon for some festival partici-pants to enter a state of possession and speak with the voices of protagonists intheMaha ̄bha ̄ratanarrative.The bow song tradition is found in the far southern region of Tamilnadu. Likethe two performance genres associated with the festivals celebrated at Draupadı ̄temples in the northeastern portion of the state, annual village temple festivalsprovide the occasion for bow song performances. And like the village enactmentsof the Maha ̄bha ̄rata, bow song performances are closely intertwined with templeritual; and further, at critical junctures in the narrative audience members may become possessed. But there are also salient differences between the two tra-ditions, and these pertain to both the performers and to the narrative theyperform. Like piracan.kam, bow song performances combine both spoken andtamil hindu literature153"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"sung delivery styles, but unlike the pa ̄ratiya ̄r of the Draupadı ̄ cult, whose recita-tion is accompanied only by a harmonium player, a bow song ensemble generallyincludes five members, each of whom both sings and plays an instrument whichinclude a drum, a clay pot, cymbals, and wooden blocks. Additionally, bow songperformances do not include dramatic enactment of its narrative repertoire in themanner of the street drama performances associated with the Draupadı ̄ cult.Stuart Blackburn, following local terminology, has designated the two cate-gories that structure the repertoire of stories performed by bow song ensemblesas “birth stories” and “death stories.” “Birth stories narrate the history or godsand goddesses grouped under the term teyva pir ̄avi(‘divine birth’) or teyvavamcam(‘divine descent’); death stories tell the histories ofir ̄antuppat.t.a va ̄tai(‘spirits who were killed’) or vet.t.uppat.t.a va ̄tai(‘spirits who were cut up’). . . deathstories are local histories, stories about people who lived and died (and thenbecame gods); birth stories, on the other hand, are mythic histories of gods andgoddesses of divine origin who are not less real than the death story heroes, butwho are not men and women either.” In his study of the bow song traditionBlackburn describes points of convergence and divergence in the narrative pat-terns that inform birth stories and death stories in the bow song repertoire.While both conclude with the establishment of a cult, this conclusion is reachedvia very different paths. In the course of a birth story, a divine being is born in heaven, “completes a series of tasks, wins boons from S ́iva, and descends toearth; there the god uses his boons to display his power, usually to wreak havocamong humans and win worship from them.” The protagonists of death storiesare born on earth, and the birth is a painful one. The story’s “protagonist iscaught in a conflict over land rights or sexual rights, or both, that leads to hisviolent death.” Whereas the protagonists of birth stories attack people whorefuse them worship, the protagonists of death stories attack those responsiblefor their death. Both types of story end with the deities’ victims building a templeand celebrating a festival in their honor, and with this episode the narrativemirrors the occasion for the stories’ performance (Blackburn 1988: 31–6).The performance traditions associated with the Tamil Draupadı ̄ cult and thebow song tradition bear comparison by virtue of their roles in village religiouslife. Both are performed on the occasion of annual temple festivals celebrated tohonor deities that are understood to be intimately involved with the well-beingof the village. The ritual contexts that frame these performances are similar, and both include incidents of spirit possession at critical moments. However,while many elements of the Draupadı ̄ cult may be aptly described (followingHiltebeitel) as transpositions of the epic Maha ̄bha ̄ratainto a local idiom, the cultic context of the bow song tradition is exclusively local.Summing UpWhile the above overview of genres and texts is far from exhaustive, it should beclear that Tamil Hindu literature is enormously diverse. One might even claim154norman cutler"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"that, like Hinduism itself, it is easier to define this corpus (if indeed this amalgamof texts and performance practices can legitimately be called a corpus) in termsof what it excludes – i.e., Tamil texts that are explicitly affiliated with non-Hindureligious traditions such as Jainism, Buddhism, Islam, and Christianity or non-religious texts – than on the basis of a central doctrine or a uniform world view.Nevertheless, one can identify clusters of shared mythic motifs, ritual affilia-tions, and attitudes that weave in and out of this corpus, providing it with a kindof informal cohesiveness. Some of the pairings that can be identified throughthis approach are fairly obvious, others less so. Anyone who is familiar with the poems of the Tamil bhakti saints and with the myths included in the Tamilpura ̄n.ic corpus cannot fail to notice their affinities: the saints’ poems are filledwith allusions to the myths, and the rhetoric of many of the myths promotes a devotional attitude toward their divine protagonists. Perhaps more tenuous,but nevertheless intriguing, would be the connection one might make betweendescriptions of certain ritual practices, including spirit possession, found in somecan.kam poems and seemingly similar ritual practices that inform the Tamil cults of Draupadı ̄ and the bow song deities. The analytic concept of “familyresemblance” has been invoked to account for the nature of the relationshipamong the various beliefs and practices that commonly are identified as “Hindu”(Ferro-Luzzi 1989), and one might do the same when speaking of “Tamil Hinduliterature.”Let us then conclude by attempting to profile this wide-ranging corpus bytracing connections with other dimensions of religious life and by reviewing thevarious textual modalities it encompasses. To begin, some, but not all of thesetexts are closely intertwined with ritual, especially as performed in the Hindutemples of Tamilnadu. On the one hand, the canonized poems of the Tamilbhakti saints have been incorporated into the liturgy of Brahmanic temples ofVis.n.u and S ́iva, where recitation of the saints’ poems can be interpreted as areenactment of the saints’ exemplary devotion to these gods. On the other, fes-tival ritual, that in a sense defines the cults of Draupadı ̄ and the bow song deities,frames the bow song performances as well as recitation and enactments ofepisodes from the Maha ̄bha ̄ratathat are central to these festivals. While thesaints’ poems may be viewed as verbal embodiments of their authors’ devotion,bow song and street drama performances provide occasions for physical em-bodiments of divine agencies through spirit possession. Other textual genresmentioned in this essay are less directly linked to the ritual domain. We find occasional references to ritual practices in can.kam poems, but there is no evi-dence that these poems were themselves performed in a ritual context. Tamilsthalapura ̄n.as are very much a literature of and about Hindu temples, and whilethey document the mythological history of specific temple sites and sometimesprovide a mythological charter for certain temple rituals, these texts are notthemselves deployed as a component of temple ritual. It would take us beyondthe scope of this essay to attempt to explicate in any detail the spectrum of spe-cific religious attitudes that are inscribed in these texts. In this regard, however,we should note that sectarian Vais.n.avism and S ́aivism in Tamilnadu find in thesepoems the foundation for sophisticated theological systems.tamil hindu literature155"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"The word “text” has been used as an umbrella term for all of the verbal cre-ations discussed in this essay, but the uniformity of this signifier masks a varietyof textual forms. The genres we have considered cover a wide range on the scalesof orality and writing, on the one hand, and textual fluidity and fixity, on theother. Until relatively recently, inscribed palm leaves were the predominantmedium for recording, preserving, and disseminating texts in South India. Butmore often than not, even if texts were recorded on palm leaves, they generallywere taught, performed and “consumed” in an oral context, with manuscriptsserving primarily as an aid to memory. The only evidence we have regarding theoriginal context for the composition and performance of can.kam poems is foundin the legend of an ancient literary academy patronized by early Tamil kings,and in the representation of poets and patrons in some of the poems themselves.This enables us to generalize that this body of poetry originally flourished in a courtly context, but otherwise we know little about the poems’ authors andaudience and the specific contexts for their performance. The hagiographies of the Tamil bhakti saints would have us believe that the saints composed theirpoems as acts of service to Vis.n.u and S ́iva often in the course of visiting localesassociated with specific forms of these gods. The hagiographical literature alsoaccounts for the miraculous events that resulted in the redaction of the saints’poems. Both palm leaf manuscripts and oral transmission – the latter sometimesbeing of a miraculous nature – are factors in these stories.The court and the temple continued to serve as the primary loci for learnedTamil literary culture until modern times, and from about the sixteenth centurymonastic institutions were also an important component of this mix. We are for-tunate to have in the autobiography of the great textual scholar and editor U. V.Ca ̄mina ̄taiyar a vivid description of the literary culture that flourished in themonasteries and small towns of nineteenth-century Tamilnadu, and it is likelythat the practices he describes were well established for many generations priorto his lifetime. For Ca ̄mina ̄taiyar and many of this contemporaries, pirapantamand pura ̄n.ic texts on S ́aiva themes were the staple diet of a literary education,and Ca ̄mina ̄taiyar’s teacher, Mı ̄n ̄a ̄t.cicuntaram Pil.l.ai was also renowned forcomposing texts in these genres. Pil.l.ai received many commissions from temples,monasteries, and wealthy individuals to compose pirapantam and pura ̄n.amworks, and Ca ̄mina ̄taiyar describes how Pil.l.ai would orally compose verse afterverse while one of his pupils inscribed them on palm leaves. The formal debut ofa text, once completed, was always an oral recitation before an audience, thoughthe palm leaf manuscript on which it had been inscribed was also given a placeof honor on these occasions.Though orality is a prominent feature of all of these pre-modern textual vari-eties, at the same time, there was a strong sense of a fixed text which must berespected in performance. Turning our attention to the texts associated withvillage temple festivals, the situation is rather different. Within this realm therecitation of the pa ̄ratiya ̄r, who often follows the Tamil Maha ̄bha ̄ratatext ofVillipputtu ̄r A ̄l ̄va ̄r fairly closely, is based on a textual model not very differentfrom the one mentioned above. But in street drama and bow song performances156norman cutler"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"the “text” is a more fluid entity. Manuscripts of plays and bow song texts circu-late among performers, but these serve more as training tools for performersthan as authoritative cultural objects in there own right. While performancesare based more on what Stuart Blackburn has called “prior preparation” ratherthan spontaneous composition in performance, still the conventions of thesegenres leave much room for improvisation, and the “texts” of given narrativemay change and have changed over time. We thus find that the material formsof Tamil Hindu literary works are as diverse as their contents.Notes1For a discussion of pur ̄am elements in Tamil Vais.n.ava bhakti poetry see Ramanujanand Cutler 1983.2This distinction roughly parallels the traditional distinction which is made betweensagun.a and nirgun.a bhakti traditions, that is, traditions which conceptualize god asbeing “with qualities” and those which conceptualize god as being “without quali-ties.” The Tamil bhakti tradition predominantly conforms to the former model, whilethe Vı ̄ras ́aiva tradition found in the neighboring Kannada-speaking region conformsto the latter.3The most famous text in the first group is Tirukkur ̄al.(ca. fifth century ce), which issometimes referred to as “the Tamil Bible.” Though in modern scholarly circles it isthought to be likely that the text’s legendary author, Tiruval.l.uvar, was a Jain, thiscompendium of poetically terse aphorisms on public and domestic life is largely freeof specifically sectarian elements. Most famous of the early long narrative poems in Tamil is Cilappatika ̄ram, “The Story of the Anklet” (ca. fifth century ce). This text,attributed to the Jain renouncer Ilan.ko ̄, combines themes of earlier akam and pur ̄ampoetry, goddess worship, and a political vision of a Tamil imperium. In modern timesboth of these texts have been adopted as emblems of Tamil cultural identity.4The paradigm of 63 nayan ̄ma ̄r begins with a list of saints included in a poem ofCuntaramu ̄ rtti (eighth century ce), who predates Ma ̄n.ikkava ̄ cakar (ninth century).5Richman includes examples of Muslim and Christian pil.l.aittamil ̄poems in her studyof this genre (Richman 1997).6Kenneth Bryant has explicated a very similar dynamic in the Kr.s.n.aite poetry ofthe north Indian bhakti poet Su ̄rda ̄ s (Bryant 1978). Richman points out that, con-trary to expectations, there are few Tamil pil.l.aittamil ̄devoted to the subject of babyKr.s.n.a.7Historically, the term ka ̄ ppiyam is usually applied to a corpus of long narrative poems composed by Buddhist and Jain authors between the fifth and tenth centuries,whereas the preeminent ka ̄ vyam poem is Kampan ̄’s twelfth-century Tamil version of the Ra ̄ma ̄yan.a.Many Tamil scholars consider the two terms to be etymologicallycognate, though some scholars dispute the etymologically link between Sanskrit“ka ̄ vya” and Tamil “ka ̄ ppiyam.”8This relationship may be thought of as a mirror image of the relationship betweenthe Sanskrit epic and the many Sanskrit maha ̄ka ̄ vyas which aim to transform theepic text into refined poetry.

For most of the major regional cultures in India, such literary projects weresimultaneously caught up with religious ones, for literature and learning werecast in languages and institutions that claimed an ultimately sacerdotal andeven divine authority. Sanskrit, Pali, and Prakrit, though developing in Indo-Aryan speech communities of northern India, rapidly lost their moorings in anylocal tongue and spread to establish transregional literary cultures primarily inassociation with Brahmanical Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. These purelylearned languages had reached every corner of the subcontinent before theChristian era, prior to the rise of any regional language into written form. Forat least the next millennium, until the coming of Islamic polities to many partsof medieval India these religiously sanctioned literary cultures set the frame-work within which regional literatures had to contend in establishing and main-taining their identities. With the notable exception of Tamil, at the extremesouth of India, every major regional literature thus crafted the preponderanceof its founding texts as religious works.1Even Tamil, the earliest of the regionalliterary languages, which began through bardic literature of a principallysecular nature, was thoroughly transformed through popular Hindu devotion-alism, before any other regional literatures of the subcontinent had evenappeared (Cutler 1987, Narayanan 1994, Peterson 1991).The Malayalam literature from the region of Kerala, along India’s southwestcoast, affords an especially revealing perspective on the intersection of regionalidentity, local social relations, and the religious institutions of Hinduism in southIndia. This is because the Kerala tradition emerged out of an earlier Tamil cul-tural matrix, to develop its own transformations of Sanskrit and indigenousgenres, in a complex renegotiation of literary, religious and cultural identity"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"through time. Tamil was itself unique in being the earliest Dravidian languageto emerge into literacy, and the only regional speech to develop a “classical” lit-erature (in terms of a formalized grammar, poetics, distinctive genres, and sup-porting cultural institutions) largely independent of Sanskritic models (Zvelebil1973).2Early Kerala co-authored this Tamil tradition, but then began divergingfrom it around the twelfth century, to embrace both Sanskrit literary registers,and to develop its own Dravidian poetic and linguistic heritage in different direc-tions. Most of this, however, was prosecuted through textual projects eitherdirectly reworking the Sanskrit Epics, Pura ̄n.as, and philosophical treatises ofpan-Indic Hinduism, or through local romances that were themselves com-pletely immersed in the temple-culture of Kerala’s Hindu social formation(Freeman forthcoming).In the present chapter, I will attempt to chart the major developments ofKerala’s Hindu literature in the local language of Tamil-Malayalam, as a reflec-tion of the particular regional and socio-cultural context of its literary culture.3While the particulars of these developments are unique to Kerala, the generaltask of relating language and literature to those socio-religious cultures we clubtogether under the modern rubric “Hindu” should hold comparative interest fora wider South Asian scholarship.The Cultural Legacy of the Tamil Tradition in KeralaThe linguistic, cultural and political formation calling itself Tamil, today associ-ated with the modern linguistic state of Tamil Nadu, first emerged in the far south of India in the early centuries, ce, as a triumvirate of territorially basedkingdoms. Two of these lines, the Pa ̄n.d.yas and the Co ̄l ̄as, divided up what is today Tamil Nadu. The third, the Ce ̄ras, ruled the narrow strip of territory todaycalled Kerala along India’s southwest coast, comprising the steep, verdant decliv-ities of the Western Ghats, and reaching down from their peaks to the rich lit-toral rice and coconut tracts along the Arabian Sea. Though comparativelyisolated geographically by its formidable mountain borders, this land of theCe ̄ras, (whence, modern Ke ̄ral.am), was a vital partner in the wider cultural ter-ritory of the Tamils (Tamilakam). It is around the courts of these Tamil and Ce ̄rakings that India’s earliest regionally vernacular literature emerged, the bardiccorpus known as Can.kam literature, after the conclaves (<Skt.san.gha) of royalpoets (Hart 1975, Marr 1985, Zvelebil 1973). In keeping with the division of language families between Dravidian southern India and the Indo-Aryannorth, the thematic and poetic conventions of this earliest and most southerlyDravidian speech community were markedly different from the productions ofclassical Sanskrit literature. Representing what is essentially the rapid promotionand codification of an oral tradition into a written corpus, this poetry was the-matically bifurcated into domestic themes of romantic love, the “interior” (akam)of social life, versus the “exterior” (pur ̄am) of heroism, conquest and warfare.160rich freeman"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Both of these thematic divisions of social life were emotionally explored throughimaging moods and feelings in a semiotic coding keyed to the flora and fauna ofa conventional set of landscapes (tin.ai) distinctive to Tamil ̄akam (Ramanujan1967; see pp. 146–7 above).Most interestingly, in the larger Indian context, this Can.kam literature seemsessentially secular and worldly in terms of its subjective concerns and artisticpurpose. Objectively, however, there is considerable reportage of the indigenousforms of religious life in Kerala and the greater Tamil country before the majorimpact of Sanskritic Puranic culture. While this is not the place for an extendedtreatment of Can.kam religion, I will hazard to sketch some of its prominentfeatures, as the substratum of later religious-literary developments in Kerala.4First, religion was not centered on a sacerdotal, priestly class, like the Brahmans, but rather gave prominence to the ritual functions of kings and chiefs on the one hand, and to relatively lower status spirit-possessed oracles andmediums, on the other. The sacred, rather than tending towards the transcen-dence of Brahmanical Hindu schemes, was thus experienced in the form ofimmanent powers: immanent to the life of society in the persons of its politicalleaders, and immanent in the natural powers of life and death, through theoracles. The two formed a related circuit in that kings, as heads of warrior soci-eties, presided over an economy of death that was viewed positively as the fertilebasis for social prosperity, while the oracles trafficked in the powers of the result-ing heroic dead who were promoted to the status of gods, and whose shrinesformed the sites of spirit-possessed worship by the kings. Battle was a form ofsacrificial religion, striving to appropriate the life-force (uyir) of others, whilesacrificial religion was a substitute battle, a celebration of past blood-letting, andthe promise and foretaste to ancestral deities of battles to come. This assimila-tion was lexicalized in the word kal.am, which meant at once the threshing floorfor gathering one’s agricultural yield, the field of battle, and the sacred space forsacrifice. In the rites of worship, political authorities orchestrated the death-ritesof blood sacrifice, while the bodies of mediums became the vehicles for divinizedspirits of the ancestral dead who danced, offered oracular pronouncements, andexpressed their desires and pleasures.While this complex of spirit-possessed dancing and blood-sacrifice is viewed inmodern times as “folk” religion, for many centuries this was the “classical” reli-gion of high civilization in south India. It has persisted among the rural domi-nants at a level of formalized worship in this region that is reminiscent of the royallegacy, harboring an alternate sacred order that persists under the later edifice ofSanskritic Hinduism. It is important to keep this in mind because despite theprominence given to Brahmanically Sanskritic models in south India, Brahmansremained a thinly distributed elite atop indigenously organized warrior societiesthroughout this region, until the latter were dismantled under European colo-nialism. This was especially so in Kerala, where even the kinship system of thedominant warrior castes was shaped by the exigencies of perpetual warfare.While the organization of Can.kam literature around the thematic bifurcationinto love and war genres was primarily secular, the powerful emotional the literature of hinduism in malayalam161"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"complexes of lush eroticism and graphic violence that motivated these carriedforward into the Sanskritization of Tamil literature. Known as the “TamilBhakti” movement that commenced in the sixth century ce, this literature rep-resented the mapping of mythological themes from the Sanskrit Pura ̄n.as intothe indigenous literary forms. As a socioreligious movement, this was coincidentwith the revival of Tamil kingdoms in new state forms, institutionally centeredon the emergence of structural temples, as cultural centers built on and linkingtogether the village structure of these kingdoms’ agrarian economies. The orig-inally local deities of these temples were Sanskritized into either the Vais.n.ava orS ́aiva Puranic pantheons, and celebrated in new liturgical song-literatures bypoet-saints who revealed the gods’ presence through divine visions and inspira-tion, and who became the subject of their own hagiographies as the saints ofTamil Vais.n.avism, the A ̄l ̄va ̄rs, and those of S ́aivism, the Na ̄yan ̄ma ̄rs (Narayanan1994, Peterson 1991). While the earlier genre distinctions between love and war poetry merged in the new bhakti works, the earlier aesthetic and emotionalenergies of the Tamil ethos adapted readily to the new religious themes (Cutler1987). The martial impetus was transferred to the battles of gods with theirdemonic adversaries (or sometimes with each other), as well as to violence of thegod against the devotee, of devotees against sectarian rivals, and of devoteesagainst themselves or their loved ones in acts of self-mutilation and sacrifice(Hudson 1989). Similarly, erotic longings were displaced from human relationsto those of longing and devotion between devotee and deity. In many of thesesaints’ poetic utterances, we find clear resonance with the earlier ecstaticmediums, where the longing for bodily and psychic union suggests possession(Yocum 1982). The link between Tamil sovereigns and the deities who repre-sented them likewise remained powerful, though it now accommodated a Brahmanical complement that was specialized in religious pursuits whichemerged as a distinctive institutional domain: on the one hand, there waspatronage of an essentially Indo-Aryan Vedic ritual cult, and on the other, anincreasing Brahmanization of the hybrid temple culture whose roots were inDravidian ancestral shrines (Hart and Heifetz 1999).Kerala participated in this new bhakti paradigm to a certain extent, but unlikethe earlier Can.kam tradition, we have only a smattering of Tamil literary sourcesattributed to Kerala chiefs or kings, and only a dozen or so temple sites in theregion that seemed to participate in what became a predominantly eastern Tamilcomplex. Linguistically, Tamil had shifted from the language of Can.kam com-position into Middle Tamil, and around this time, from the early ninth century,the first Kerala inscriptions attest the divergence of local language into a dis-tinctively regional dialect that anticipates the later emergence of Malayalam(Sekhar, 1953; Ayyar, 1983 [1936]). While there was certainly no “HundredYears’ War” between the Co ̄l ̄as and Ce ̄ras that an earlier generation of historiansinvented to account for the political-cultural break between the regions, therecan be no doubt that Kerala’s cultural divergence from Tamil developments wasmarked by repeated warring across the Ghats, and that the tenth-century rise of162rich freeman"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"Co ̄l ̄a imperium helped condition and maintain the internal fragmentation ofmedieval Kerala into a pastiche of feuding sub-kingdoms.5This remained thepolitical situation of Kerala down to the advent of the European powers, andformed the social matrix in which Kerala’s version of Hinduism and its literaryexpression arose and developed.The Early Devotional Mode: Literary Songs of Ritual and WarThe first literary writing ofKerala in a recognizably distinctive West coast dialect of the “Tamil” that was to become Malayalam is a commentary on Kaut.ilya’s Arthas ́a ̄stra(Sambasiva Sastri, 1972 [1930]). The original work is a Sanskrit treatise on the Indic science of polity, and the commentary is avirtual paraphrase that adds little to the original. What it does show, however,is that Brahmanical Sanskritic treatises were imposing themselves on Keralasociety as technical (if improbable) models of political organization and conduct.As with the largely secular focus of Can.kam literature, there is scarcely anythingwe might consider of religious import in this text. Unfortunately, the commen-tary on the various rites of sorcery and magic that are supposed to secure politi-cal successes in the final chapter of the work is no longer extant.Shortly thereafter, in perhaps the thirteenth century, we encounter anothervery different work, the first religious work in the Malayalam language, the only recently discovered Tirunil ̄alma ̄la, the “Garland of the Sacred Shade (orGrace).” Until the discovery and publication of this work in 1980 (Purus.o ̄ttamanNa ̄yar 1981), the advent of Kerala’s literary history was dominated by theRa ̄macaritam, a roughly contemporaneous and far lengthier retelling of the Sanskrit epic, the Ra ̄ma ̄yan.a(George 1956). While in a very similar linguisticidiom of early Malayalam, however, the Tirunil ̄alma ̄lacould not be more different,thematically. It is essentially a ritual text, centered on a series of festival ritesaround the still active temple of Kr.s.n.a at A ̄r ̄an.mul.a, in south central Kerala.There are a number of interesting aspects to this text that warrant attention.A ̄r ̄an.mul.a is first of all one of a small number ofdivyade ̄s ́as, sacred temple sitesknown to the Vais.n.ava bhakti poems of the earlier mentioned Tamil A ̄l ̄va ̄rs, tobe found in the Kerala country. Furthermore, this text reveals that five of the totalthirteen divyade ̄s ́atemples were included within A ̄r ̄an.mul.a’s jurisdiction, sug-gesting that Tamil Vais.n.avas formed a rather constricted set of colonies in theKerala country.More remarkable is the nature of the rites highlighted in this work. Whilemuch about the text is clearly embedded in the celebration of Sanskrit gods andtheir mythology, the focus of the work is not on the Brahmanical rites of worshipwe would associate with the Sanskritic A ̄gamic tradition of Tamil templeworship, but rather on the blood rites (pali<Skt.bali) performed by what aretoday lower-caste exorcists, known as Malayans.the literature of hinduism in malayalam163"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"In modern times, Malayans are found only in far northern Kerala, where bothcopies of the Tirunil ̄alma ̄lawere discovered. Malayans, however, intergrade witha caste to their south known as Pa ̄n.ar, (from pan., “melody”), which was the samedesignation used of bards in the Can.kam Tamil tradition. Both castes today specialize in sorcery (mantrava ̄dam) and exorcism rites, for which they performpoetic musical liturgies, and Malayans are perhaps the most accomplished andprominent performers ofteyya ̄t.t.am(see the accompanying article). Since, as apolluting caste (avarn.n.ar), Malayans were banned from Brahmanical temples inlater medieval Kerala, it is surprising to find their important role in the greattemple center of A ̄r ̄an.mul.a, and to find them in this role so far south. This sug-gests that Malayans were once more prominent and widespread, and that thebhakti Vais.n.avism of early Kerala temples was more socially inclusive than later,more Brahmanically A ̄gamic temple culture.While most of the deities and some of the vocabulary of the Tirunil ̄alma ̄laareSanskrit-derived, the phonological form, patterns of alliteration and metricalstructure of the poem are all modeled after classical Tamil. Despite being cen-tered on Vis.n.u, however, a large variety of gods are invoked and worshipped,showing that the sectarianism so characteristic of Tamil bhakti,particularlyrivalry between Vais.n.avas and S ́aivas, was already being deliberately elided inKerala at this early date. In fact a Malayan performer gives a lengthy recital ofthe sacred deeds of S ́iva (as known to the Tamil tradition) to Vis.n.u before thelatter’s own shrine, saying, “since there is no difference between the two of you,we have made here an offering (pali) to S ́iva” (Ln. 302). Later there is a specialdance to Kur ̄atti, a goddess especially associated with the tribals and mountainranges of Kerala who survives today in the teyyamworship of northern Keralaand other folk festivals.Though the introduction to the work gives a good idea of the socio-politicalsituation of the temple and its authorities, the bulk of the Tirunil ̄alma ̄ladescribes the various rites, offerings, and dances of the Malayans. What is quiteinteresting in this is how the religious function of this worship is perceived, forit is quite clear that the sequence of rituals and offerings over a number of daysare essentially a giant exorcism in which the performers remove any noxiousspiritual effects that may have accrued to their deity through faulty rituals,enmity, or pollution in worship. Some of these rites must have been quite spectacular, and the following example should give a clear idea that we are notin a normatively “Hindu” ritual milieu here, but one heavily inflected by its Dravidian cultural legacy.Among the bali-rites to deities over successive days and oriented in differentdirections, that done to the north, the traditional direction for blood sacrifices in battle, is reserved for Ks.e ̄trapa ̄lan. For this the Malayans planted a series ofgibbets (kal ̄uku) around the offering ground (pali-kal.am) such as malefactorswere traditionally impaled alive on in medieval Kerala. The performers thenmounted these contraptions, splayed themselves out, and writhing, had artifi-cial blood (kuruti) poured over their chests, and mock entrails pulled from theirbodies and draped over the cross-pieces as would be done in disembowelments.164rich freeman"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"The poem tells us that birds of prey and crows gathered on the gibbets, mistak-ing this for the real thing. Then amidst a roar of drums like the ocean’s waves,Ks.e ̄trapa ̄lan was ritually invoked and installed in the site. Summoning the godto witness the sight, they cried, “O Lord, we your slaves, wanting any valuables,have offered the Sacrifice to the North, rending our chests with our hands andtaking this to offer on the gibbet” (Lns. 429–30). Even today Malayans recountan exorcism for the gods as their myth of origin that they use in contemporaryrites of exorcism for human patrons. Some of these rites still entail the mock self-sacrifice of the performer, and for one of these the Malayans pierce their veinsand spew out their own blood as an offering in the awesome ucca-bali. Of coursetoday these rites have been demoted to the level of “the folk,” but they still liveon in the rather robust underground world of Kerala’s “sorcery” (mantrava ̄dam).The next great work of Hindu affiliation extant in Kerala was the aforenamedRa ̄macaritam, of the fourteenth century (George 1956). Like the Tirunil ̄alma ̄la,the phonology, orthography, and metrical structure are largely in conformitywith Tamil conventions, but given its modeling on the Sanskrit epic, a somewhatgreater portion of the lexicon is Sanskrit-derived. In narrative structure,however, this work effects a unique departure from its original model. TheRa ̄macaritamis narratively framed entirely within the Ra ̄ma ̄yan.a’sbook of war(theYuddha-ka ̄n.d.a), and reconstructs the earlier parts of the epic through flash-backs and other retellings.It has long been surmised that the recasting of the Ra ̄ma ̄yan.aentirely aroundthe war may have been related to the militarism of Kerala, suggesting this wasa devotional work essentially for the edification of the soldiery. While there is nodirect evidence for this, the ethos and tone of the work seem to support this idea.Its occasional reveling in the gore of battle draws images in common with Tamilwar poetry, like the dance of the headless corpses. Consider the following descrip-tion of the effects of Lord Ra ̄ma’s arrows on the demon hordes that attack him(77.3–5):6Many shining arrows went swift and continuousTo plunge in the bodies of those foes who surrounded him to fight.They were terrorized, as on every side of the battlefield,The gore and corpses mounted through their great destruction.The earth was thickly adorned with corpses and gore,And as the great warriors advanced, striving to search him out and do battlewith him,They could not even glimpse him, without being struck by this King of king’sarrows...Numbers of corpses, severed of their heads, entwined among themselves in afine, frenzied dance . . .As their lives were spent on the field of battle,And the bodies of those forces were rent in destruction, one on top of another,Wherever one turned, the river of blood sent its courses in numbers beyondreckoning.the literature of hinduism in malayalam165"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"In another passage, corpses severed of their heads, wander around as iflooking for something they’ve lost (i.e., their heads!), then tiring of the search,sportively join in a ta ̄n.d.avadance around the field of battle (20.10). Still anotherstanza weaves a fantastic trope: as the blood from the rent bodies of demons, theVa ̄nara monkey allies of Ra ̄ma, and their various fallen mounts gushes out onthe battlefield, it comingles into a river; the rows of faces floating in that riverare its lotus flowers; the combatants’ crushed teeth (or pearls) are the river’ssands; the soldiers’ floating trunks are alligators; their viscera are the water-plants; their swishing banners are crocodiles; their parasols are lotus leaves; andthe maddened elephants are the river’s boulders (23.4). While the bulk of the separate events and characters in the Ra ̄macaritamclosely correspond to the Sanskrit Ra ̄ma ̄yan.a,its narrative restructuring, poeticform, and much of the imagery clearly suggest a different ethos and aesthetic thathas recast the work in a classically Dravidian mold of martial devotion. When wepair this with the Tirunil ̄alma ̄lawe get a clear sense that the bhakti of early Keralahad a rather different tenor from what the Christian missionaries and modernapologists have rather selectively emphasized in presenting south Indian devo-tionalism for cosmopolitan consumption.7In many ways the myths and ethos ofcontemporary, and especially lower-caste, folk-forms fit very comfortably withthese earlier images of immanent, violent powers, and this suggests a continuityof religious perspective that sits athwart the divide of caste and class-status.The Early Sanskrit Genre ofMan.iprava ̄l.amLinguistically and poetically, such relative continuities are evident in Kerala lit-erature in those genres that, like the two texts we have just reviewed, conformedto canons recognizably affiliated with Tamil literary models. The first and only premodern linguistic text treating Kerala’s language, the fourteenth-century Lı ̄la ̄tilakam,8labels this first style of literary production Pa ̄t.t.u. Meaningliterally just “song,” this suggests its close association with those local per-formative modes we might later style “folk.” At this time, however, Pa ̄t.t.ustood as a literary genre contrasted with its highly Sanskritized counterpart,Man.iprava ̄l.am. The name of this latter literary medium literally meant “pearlsand coral” after the image of this language as stringing together the differentgems of local language forms with those of Sanskrit. Lexically, metrically, andphonologically (through adaptation of the Sanskrit syllabary from the granthascript), this Man.iprava ̄l.am style sought to reshape the local “Tamil” of Keralaon the model of high Sanskrit literature. In fact, the Lı ̄la ̄tilakamopens by declar-ing that anything that can be done in the highest Sanskrit literature (ka ̄vya), canbe literarily accomplished in Man.iprava ̄l.am. But what these accomplishmentsactually are, in the thematics of the poetry, testifies to the social life of Kerala’sliterati in a way that becomes an embarrassment to future generations.It seems relatively clear that the principal authors in the early phase ofMan.iprava ̄l.am were those most intimately acquainted with Sanskrit, namely,166rich freeman"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"Kerala’s Brahmans. It is therefore their literary culture and life-style that weremost closely reflected in this literature. The earliest poetic works, in ornatelyaccomplished and highly Sanskritized genres, are poems dealing primarily witherotic themes addressed to their non-Brahman (S ́u ̄dracaste-grade) mistresses.The earliest of these texts, from perhaps the thirteenth century, is the collectionof verses styled the Vai ́sika Tantra(“The Treatise of the Courtesan”), in the formof a courtesan mother’s advice to her daughter (Ra ̄macandran Na ̄yar 1969).This is followed in the next century by three major poetic compositions, each inpraise of a different named courtesan, and by other collections of short poemson the same topic. Given the prominence of these themes and the voluptuarylife-style they portray, the major thrust of later scholarship has been to decry thedecadence of Man.iprava ̄l.am in comparison with the religious themes of thePa ̄t.t.u literature. Matters, however, are not actually so simple.A work written in this same milieu, and somewhat before the Lı ̄la ̄tilakam(which indeed cites it), is the Anantapuravarn.n.anam(Ratnamma 1986). This along descriptive poem on the Vis.n.u temple of Trivandrum and its surroundings.Though similarly in high Man.iprava ̄l.am, and in Sanskrit anus.t.hubhmeter, it isclearly religious in its intent. It recounts what a worshipper encounters in visit-ing all the temples and sacred groves in a circuit around Trivandrum and its sub-settlements, culminating in the religious encounter with Vis.n.u as Anantas ́ayanain the main temple at the heart of the city (vs. 147). Though clearly a work ofVa i s.n.ava devotion, such as in weaving an account of the ten incarnations(das ́a ̄vata ̄ra) of Vis.n.u into the final religious vision, it gives considerable space todescriptions of S ́aivite shrines and temples, as well, continuing the earlier non-sectarian impetus oftheTirunil ̄alma ̄la. Ethnographically, the work is rich indetail, celebrating the ritual procession of Trivandrum’s king into the temple (vs.115–21) and devoting many stanzas to describing the extensive markets (vs.41–104). It even eavesdrops on the dialogues between merchants and customersas they haggle over merchandise.Religiously, the work catches that phase of Kerala’s temple culture, in which,in keeping with the Sanskrit idiom, Brahmanically A ̄gamic ritual had taken overat such royal centers. This is clear from the description of temple rituals, theBrahman “college,” and the Brahman mess attached to the temple (vs. 133 ff.;148–9). It is interesting to note, in the context of sectarian affiliation, that theonly other extensive use of the term Man.iprava ̄l.amoutside of Kerala was in label-ing the contemporary Tamil S ́rı ̄Vais.n.ava literature which used a very similarlexical idiom in terms of combining Tamil and Sanskrit (though only in prose)for commenting on Vais.n.ava scripture. Putting this together with such evidenceas the Lı ̄la ̄tilakam’scelebrating the Tamil Vais.n.ava Divyaprabandhamas the“Tamil Veda,” and recalling that the Trivandrum temple was one of the sacredcenters of Vais.n.avism known to the Tamil bhakti corpus, suggests the consider-able influence of S ́rı ̄vais.n.avism at this time. At any rate, the survival of at leastseveral other works in this Kerala-based Man.iprava ̄l.am, which were exclusivelydedicated to religious themes of praising gods or their temples, should cautionus against the stereotypic thematic equation of Man.iprava ̄l.am with Brahmani-cal eroticism, as against all those works which modern scholars club into thethe literature of hinduism in malayalam167"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"dustbin genre of Pa ̄t.t.u, lending the latter a patina that is at once more indige-nous and more piously devotional.This notion that the erotic was somehow counter to religious perspectives (anotion that one might argue is a back-reading of colonial and postcolonial epis-temes) might similarly be eroded even by a closer scrutiny of those works explic-itly focused on the courtesan culture. The main works of high Man.iprava ̄l.amprovide descriptive overviews of courtesan manors and their cultural life, whichare indeed completely imbricated with the social and religious life of Kerala’smedieval temples. Institutionally, the strict primogeniture of Brahmanical inher-itance patterns in Kerala worked to regularize recurrent sexual liaisons betweenjunior Brahman males and women of the martial and temple-servant castes.This overlapped with the institution ofTe ̄vat.icci,theDevada ̄sı ̄known elsewherein India, where women were dedicated to the gods of particular shrines, servingas ritual dancers and entertainers for the gods, and courtesans for higher clientele among the worshippers. In Kerala, I believe these logics fused aroundBrahmans as simultaneously the chief patrons of the temple arts and of cour-tesans, as regular genitors among the higher families of royalty and temple-servants, and, as “gods on earth,” the intellectual and spiritual heads of the religious culture of temples. Temples and manors of the high-born were thusthoroughly intertwined, with circuits of travel through the landscape of cour-tesan manors that the Man.iprava ̄l.am works describe being largely congruentwith pilgrimage circuits through the sacred geography of Kerala.Religiously speaking, these various courtesan works thus contain not justdescriptions of many temple-sites and sacred groves, but also dedication verses,descriptions and praises (stutis) of many deities, in the context of relations withcourtesans. I believe a sustained study of this literature that takes its religiousideologies seriously might demonstrate more pervasive connections betweenthese and the social structuring and sexual politics of caste Hinduism in Kerala.The frequent mapping of religious devotion (bhakti) between devotee and deityin gender relationships, the recurrent mythologies of high male deities linked toviolently dangerous and militant consort goddesses, and the S ́a ̄ kta or tantricdoctrines of liberation through harnessing the libidinal energies of the bodycannot, I would argue, be accidental in this historical context. Indeed, I wouldsuspect they were synthesized in the temple cult itself, which was avowedlytantric in its ideology of worship and frequently focused on goddesses who wereSanskritically upgraded versions of local warrior deities. The earliest of thesecourtesan travelogues, the thirteenth-century Un.n.iyaccicaritam, for instance,ends with a prose description, and then this final stanza of prayer to the goddessof Pal ̄añce ̄ri (vs. 26):Worshipped in fine purity, with her tongue a licking mass of flame, drinking theblood that flows by her shining trident from the bodies of powerful demons, alongwith the copious nectar that trickles from the crescent moon afflicted by her vig-orous battle, may this daughter of Ka ̄ ma’s slayer (S ́iva), this Mother who dwells inPal ̄añce ̄ri, ever grant us protection.168rich freeman"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"There is a rich interplay of images here of warfare, blood sacrifice, and con-sumption, along with the confluence of fiery metabolic energy, female potenciesof blood and the seminal emissions of the moon whose tantric overtones areunmistakable. Though research on the development of the tantric tradition inKerala has been negligible, its doctrines and practices clearly formed a primarynexus in which an official Brahman ideology of worship came to terms with thedominant religious culture of sexual fertility, violent militarism, and spirit pos-session through the institutionalized rites and festivals of the Hindu temple. Insummary, it seems evident that the early phase of Man.iprava ̄l.am literature con-tains much of this religious synthesis that has been overlooked in modern schol-ars’ dismissal of and embarrassment at its erotic component, in comparisonwith that other stream of the so-called Pa ̄t.t.u literature.Poets of Non-Brahman BhaktiWhile the Tirunil ̄alma ̄laandRa ̄macaritamare linguistically distinct from thenearly contemporaneous Man.iprava ̄l.am works in terms of eschewing Sanskritphonology, grammatical terminations, and massive amounts of vocabulary, thesubsequent works classed by modern scholars as Pa ̄t.t.u readily assimilate manyof these Sanskritic features of high Man.iprava ̄l.am. It is on the basis of their nar-rative dependence on Sanskrit Epics and Pura ̄n.as, and in their Dravidian meters,that they are most readily distinguished from their Man.iprava ̄l.am counterparts.The next great stage or stratum of production in this tradition comes from themembers of a family known as the Niran.am poets, during the fourteenth andfifteenth centuries.These poets specialized in condensing the Sanskrit Epics into shorter com-pendia of stanzas constructed of local Dravidian meters. These meters werebased on the same principles as those of Tamil (as opposed to the Sanskrit metersof Man.iprava ̄l.am), but took simpler and more fluid forms in accordance withtheir largely performative nature. Linguistically, the adoption of a Sanskriticallyphonological script brought in the wholesale adoption of Sanskrit vocabulary.This has been the single greatest contributor to the divergence of Malayalamfrom Tamil down to the present. This script also enabled the Man.iprava ̄l.am traitof using Sanskrit grammatical terminations, as well, but this was done sparingly,and I am certain this was related to the different social authorship and presumedaudience of the Niran.am poets.What is most remarkable about the Niran.am poets is that we know from theirrecurring title, “Pan.ikkar” that they were non-Brahman, most likely of martialcaste, and reckoned as mere S ́u ̄ dras from the Brahmanical perspective. Inkeeping with their own dedicatory and concluding verses, we can surmise thattheir linguistic medium, which they craved their audiences “not to despise asmixed language,” was intended to bring the salvific powers of Sanskrit religioustexts “in some paltry fashion” to their own communities of lower-caste wor-shippers.9On the one hand, this stanza from the introduction to theirthe literature of hinduism in malayalam169"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"Ra ̄ma ̄yan.am shows the certain hegemony of Brahmanical models over this lin-guistic and religious community:Discarding egotism and such through ascetic meditation, and compassionatelygiven over to peacefulness, restraint, and joy in their dedication to the Veda, considering such incomparable Lords on Earth (i.e. Brahmans) to be my very divin-ity, by the grace of these Vedic Brahmans will all that I contemplate here by accom-plished. (Man.n.ummu ̄t.u 1993: 18)On the other hand, such lofty praise also implies the establishment of highstandards by which to judge Brahmanical conduct, standards which were con-spicuously absent in the courtesan literature of Man.iprava ̄l.am. Furthermore,despite the self-deprecation of this “mixed language” (bha ̄s.a ̄mis ́ram) and itsworks as not attaining the elevation of the Sanskrit originals, the Niran.am tra-dition authorizes itself in terms of its own “faultlessly pre-eminent great guru,a mighty soul who was a lordly master of both [Sanskrit and vernacular] poet-ries.”10If such gurus and their disciples thus chose (or were forced by social con-vention) to compose in the lower-status local language, the claims to equalspiritual status are nevertheless overt. Their god himself declares to the world intheir works, “Be they gods or untouchables, my devotees (bhaktas) are alike inmy esteem – such is the message of the Lord (I ̄s ́varan),”11Lastly, it is interestingthat while Vais.n.ava works take a certain precedence among the Niran.am poets(including one of the earliest vernacular renderings of the Bhagavad-Gı ̄ta ̄inIndia), they also composed a S ́ivara ̄trima ̄ha ̄tmyamon the greatness of S ́iva andvows (vrata) kept to him, and their family gods paired the Vis.n.u/Kr.s.n.a of theMalayinkı ̄l ̄temple, and the S ́iva (as Kapa ̄lı ̄s ́varan) at Niran.am itself, to both ofwhom their poems are repeatedly dedicated.The Performative Context of Religious ProductionWhile the Pa ̄t.t.u and Man.iprava ̄l.am streams that later merge to form Malaya ̄l.amliterature bring Sanskrit myths and deities into written prominence, it is impor-tant to realize that the grounds for this mediation into local language were likelylaid earlier within the performative features of the Sanskrit tradition itself inKerala. Traditions of staging Sanskrit dramas were, from the outset, religiousevents, performed within temple-precincts over many days, as parts of ritual cal-endars and sponsored in fulfillment of vows. From perhaps the ninth century orearlier, temple-servant castes were occupationally specialized as to their variousacting, dancing and musician roles in staging these plays, which were alwaysadapted from the Sanskrit Epics and Pura ̄n.as.12To simplify this picture greatly, what developed within the Sanskrit dramatictradition were various mediating roles for performers, retelling, glossing, orexpanding on the events and characters depicted, first in simpler Sanskrit, theneventually in hybrid language forms that bridged between Sanskrit and the local language. Slots within the performance format were set aside for direct170rich freeman"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"address to the audience, and these developed their own genres ranging from proseretellings (gadyam) in a lexically Sanskritic but grammatically local form of Keralalanguage, to special compositions (prabandhams) that mixed Man.iprava ̄l.am-styleverses with prose (a form known as campu). The prose, gadyamcompositions, wereapparently recited by the Nambya ̄r caste of temple drummers, while the campuworks were performed by the somewhat higher-caste actors of the Ca ̄kya ̄r caste.While this interspersing of verse and prose in the campu ̄(to use the Sanskritspelling) emerged at a pan-Indic level in Sanskrit with Bhoja, in the eleventhcentury, its popularity in south India, and its special adaptation in Kerala, seemsclosely related to the context of performance and its social moorings there. Inthe first place, much of the so-called “prose” of the campuswas in fact in localDravidian meters. Since these did not qualify as “verse” (padyam) under Sanskritpoetic typologies, they had to be smuggled in, as it were, under the label of“prose” (gadyam) between the metrically Sanskrit verses of Man.iprava ̄l.am, toform the matrix of the Malayalam campu. These Dravidian “prose” sections seemto be functionally adapted not only to the main description and story line of thePuranic myths, but also to weave in commentary, and especially, social obser-vations and satire, often with the force of recontextualizing the myths in thesocial setting of contemporary Kerala culture.This points up several crucial features of the performance traditions of Keralain relation to Malayalam literature. First, it was such traditions that we think ofas the “performing arts” which mediated much of the Sanskrit religious traditioninto Kerala culture. It was actors in the temple-theater who seem first to havedeveloped special elaborating sub-genres, as ancillaries to the main performance.With time, these appear to have become more popular, increasingly independent,and eventually to have left the interior of the temple-theater to circulate in thewider society. In this context, we should also keep in mind that while “theater”tends to suggest the primary function of secular entertainment in the modernWest, both the Sanskrit theatrical performances and their subsequent transfor-mations were fundamentally religious rituals in Kerala (Jones 1984).Relatedly, we have to realize that much of what our print-culture thinks of, and therefore receives, interprets, and reconstructs after our book-form ascomprising “Malayalam literature,” often comprises only the text-artifacts, themnemonic props of performative genres. Though the campuemerges in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries as the dominant genre of “literature,” the degreeof borrowing and transposing of whole chunks of composition between worksand authors, coupled with frequent direct address to and descriptions ofaudiences, leaves little doubt that these works were performed in some partly-improvisational, public forum. This public was almost certainly gathered on cal-endrically ritual occasions, in the context of temple festivals. The Dravidian formof the poetic “prose,” coupled with the satiric elements, often with Brahmans and their institutions themselves as the target, suggests that the audience constituency was wider and less exclusive than that of the Sanskritic theater.This indicates the final, socially significant trajectories of performative contextthat become more pronounced, finding their way increasingly into literaryinscription with time. I refer here to contestatory social forces, both outside Brah-the literature of hinduism in malayalam171"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"manism and within it, that tend to fragment adherence to any monolithic set ofsocial-literary norms. They derive their strength both from a wider and lower-caste patronage base and literary constituency, conjoined with competitivecleavages among Brahmanical authors who are aligned with different socialgroups. As an example, during approximately the same period in the fifteenthcentury when Punam Nampu ̄tiri was composing and performing his greatRa ̄ma ̄yan.a Campu, an artfully woven pastiche of lively Dravidian “prose,” highMan.iprava ̄l.am, and Sanskrit passages from Bhoja’s own campu ̄form of the epic,Cerrs ́s ́e ̄ri, another Nampu ̄tiri Brahman, had composed his famous Kr.s.n.a Ga ̄tha.This latter work is entirely in a simple Dravidian meter of song (ga ̄tha), explic-itly commissioned by a local king of northern Kerala. Its composition in thismeter, suggests that it was intended to be sung. While Kerala scholars put it inthe Pa ̄t.t.u genre, based on its linguistic and metrical form and its subject-matteron the life of Lord Kr.s.n.a taken from the Sanskrit Bha ̄gavata Pura ̄n.a, other fea-tures mark it out as diverging significantly from works like those of the non-Brahman Niran.am poets. What is firstly always noted as most remarkable inCerus ́s ́e ̄ri’s work, is that despite its composition in Dravidian meter and vocabu-lary at the level of content, he has managed to formally work this material intothe poetic figures of sound and sense (alam.ka ̄ra) that were the hallmark of highSanskrit literature. The second feature, far more troubling to modern sensibili-ties, is the amount of erotic sentiment (s ́r.n.ga ̄ra) that he seems to develop andsavor in this ostensibly devotional project. In this regard the feeling-tone ofcertain sections is sometimes more like the classically erotic Man.iprava ̄l.am.While modern scholars tend to either disparage these erotic themes as marringan otherwise fine devotional piece with Brahmanically decadent values, or denythe erotic intention altogether through interpretively subsuming it in a higherform of devotion, I would not rule out the pervasive influence of the tantricmilieu (and erotic modes of bhakti, as well) in which sexuality was given anexplicitly positive valuation within a religious framework.A larger point to be noted here is that after the early courtesan romances, theimportant works of Malayalam, whether in the Pa ̄t.t.u or Man.iprava ̄l.am styles,are nearly all based on adaptations of Sanskrit Epic and Puranic myths. Beingrooted as they are in performative traditions, however, they simultaneouslyadapt the religious themes of those myths to the particular social context ofKerala, while they offer the mythic models as an interpretive frame for that socialcontext. Moreover, since Kerala society was stratified by partly congruent dis-tinctions of caste, class, and ethnolinguistic affiliation, these performative andliterary adaptations bear the internal structural strains of social contestation.Bakhtinian notions of multivocality are clearly in evidence. The initial asides ofgloss, commentary, or satire within Sanskrit drama, widen into the wedge ofDravidian “prose,” by which all kinds of local myths and context are insertedinto Puranic frames. On the Brahmanical side, Cerus ́s ́e ̄ri seizes on the form andlanguage of his lower-caste predecessors; on the non-Brahman front, from theNiran.am poets onward, authors lend their local bhakti a Brahmanical veneerwith the full lexical embrace of Sanskrit.172rich freeman"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"The locally Dravidian impulses of the theater finally break out, in the seven-teenth century, colonizing the Sanskrit frames themselves with local motifs andlanguage, in the birth of the Malayalam temple-theater form, Kathakal.i (Zarrilli2000). Actors need no longer be part of the interior temple-servant castes, butare prominently drawn from the martial castes and bring their themes and narratives in with them. Formerly “demonic” roles may come to overshadowthose of the gods (as in the Ra ̄van.avijayam); the goddess Ka ̄l.i, arrayed as a spirit-possessed hellion from village festivals, leaps from the stage to cavort throughthe audience; and Narasim.ha enacts the disembowelment of his demonic adver-sary with simulated bloody entrails, recalling the stunts of the Malayans fromtheir gibbets in the Tirunil ̄alma ̄la. While still Sanskritic by the standard of villagereligious festivals, Kathakal.i was the genius of locally competing courts, andtheir martial retainers, yet it brought to the Malayalam language the performa-tive patina of a classical temple-art, still partly sequestered as a high ritual formfrom the bulk of the “polluting” castes.The Ferment of Popular ReligiosityIn the world outside the temple, in the sixteenth- to seventeenth-century interimbetween Cerus ́s ́e ̄ri and the birth of Kathakal.i, the tradition ofS ́u ̄dradevotional-ism found in the Niran.am poets is taken up by Tuñcattu El ̄uttacchan, often con-sidered the father of Malayalam, proper (Achyuta Menon 1940). While usingan array of local Dravidian meters, always in simple couplets, his language effec-tively effaces any lexical distinction between Man.iprava ̄l.am and Pa ̄t.t.u styles,wedding them in a medium that seems distinctively modern. His principal work,theAdhya ̄tma-Ra ̄ma ̄yan.am, is taken not from the classical archetype of Va ̄lmı ̄ki,but from the fourteenth-century work of popular devotion of the same name.Like its namesake, El ̄uttacchan’s work follows the later bhakti interpretation of Ra ̄ma as fully empowered godhead incarnate in this world, and teaches thesimplistic path of repeating his sacred name as fulfilling all earthly desires andleading to liberation.While we have no firm historical evidence for the individual, TuñcattuEl ̄uttacchan (his personal name itself being in dispute), we can surmise some-thing of the social import of his work and the new movement he typifies. He waseither the founder or star pupil of a religious institution that housed bothBrahman and S ́u ̄ dra literary-religious notables under the patronage of a localchieftain in north-central Kerala. The historical details remain shadowy, butstories report that he was the offspring of a Brahman–S ́u ̄ dra union. El ̄uttacchanitself is a title (literally “father of letters”), used in recent centuries for school-masters, generally of higher S ́u ̄ dra caste, who imparted basic literacy to the“clean” castes in village settings.That such literacy became widespread is testified to by the enormous numberof manuscripts of the Adhya ̄tma Ra ̄ma ̄yan.am, the largest by far for any premod-the literature of hinduism in malayalam173"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"ern work, throughout the region of Kerala. The text itself declares that it wascomposed by a S ́u ̄ dra, that “reading and reciting it” frees one from the greatestsins, and that “those who desire learning” will become greatly illumined thereby“with the consent of the Aryan folk” (i.e. the Brahmans).13Though groundedin a different milieu than the temple theater and festivals, this text was alsoclearly performative, by design. The manuscript distributions and the functionalimplications of the text’s structure and content clearly suggest that the contextof use was domestic recitation, either privately or on ceremonial occasions. Atnumerous places the text breaks into metrical lists of epithets and phrases ofpraise, like it were a kind of breviary for Ra ̄ma devotionalism.The narrative style, using a pastiche of metrical couplets that El ̄uttacchandeveloped, was called Kil.i-pa ̄t.t.u, the “parrot’s song” after the convention headapted from old Tamil of having a parrot narrate the story to the author. WhileEl ̄uttacchan wrote a condensation of the Maha ̄bha ̄rata in the same style, a workgenerally considered of greater literary merit, but less popular than theAdhya ̄tma Ra ̄ma ̄yan.am, most of the other works attributed to him are in dispute.It is clear, however, that he and his followers sparked a whole literary movement,and there are scores of adaptations of Sanskrit works in this genre reaching intomodern times.Some scholars have seen in this marked increase of bhakti literature, with itsshift in style and content that supplants and nearly eclipses the earlier Sanskri-tized, eroticized poetry, a popular upswell, or a “movement.” Some attribute it torevolt against a decadent Brahmanism, while others find in it an indigenousresponse to the incipient colonialism inaugurated by Portuguese involvement inKerala’s mercantile life and ports. Different scholars, however, find and date dif-ferent bhakti movements (as with the earlier Niran.am poets or the still earlierRa ̄macaritam), and in this absence of consensus, I find little convincing histori-cal evidence for anchoring specific texts to specific historical contexts or eventsat this stage of research, let alone finding clear historical phases or breaks inthese developments. I think the movements were too dialogically complex, interms of caste-strata, linguistic media, and shifting political and religious con-texts to demarcate any simple lines of development with the rather patchy evidence we have.An interesting problem, for instance, is how and why even the highly Brah-manical register of the campu(the mixed prose and poetry genre mentionedearlier) shifts from the fifteenth century or so out of a concern with courtesanculture, and into almost exclusively religious literary themes. Many of theseworks come out of the temple theatre and its various spin-off genres of re-citation, and there is some debate as to what the communities or forums ofperformance actually were for this class of works.The greatest exemplar of the campuproper (other shorter works, calledprabandhams,having the same mixed prose-poetry form), is the Ra ̄ma ̄yan.aCampuof Punam Nampu ̄ tiri, alluded to earlier. This creatively restructures theRa ̄ma ̄yan.a,weaving together Sanskrit verse, Man.iprava ̄l.am verse, Dravidianverse (labeled “prose”), and various kinds of quasi-versified prose (dan.d.akams,etc.). The composite nature of this “work,” the free borrowing of whole passages174rich freeman"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"from other works (and of them from this), as well as repeated references to an audience and to the context of a Ra ̄ma festival (Ra ̄ma ̄vata ̄ra-utsavam)(Ven.kit.t.ara ̄ma S ́armma ̄ 1967: 104–5), all point to the performance of this andother such works being staged in temple festivals of the higher castes. Anotherthematically different set ofcampuscomes from the sixteenth-century author,Nı ̄lakan.t.ha, who composed three of them, each on the mythology and greatnessof a different temple under the patronage of a different king.14Being specificallytemple-based, these works give an unusual glimpse into the social circles, rites,and patronage base characterizing Kerala’s late medieval temples.A similar shift, though not so marked, comes out of the sande ̄s ́a,or “messen-ger poem” genre, in imitation of Ka ̄l.ida ̄sa’s great Sanskrit work, the Meghadu ̄ta.While the bulk of these works in Kerala were in Sanskrit, two well-known onesin Man.iprava ̄l.am verse seem to chart a similar thematic shift towards religiousthemes. The late fourteenth-century Un.n.unı ̄lisande ̄s ́amsends its narrating messenger over the length of southern Kerala in search of the beautiful damselUn.n.unı ̄li, describing a number of courtesans, their physical charms and theirassociated residential and temple locales (I. Kuññan Pil.l.a, 1985 [1954]). TheKo ̄kasande ̄s ́amof the next century, however, fails to even name the heroine of itsquest, and is given over far more to the description of temples and praise stanzasof their associated gods (Go ̄pikkut.t.an 1996). In contrast to these two messen-ger poems in Man.iprava ̄l.am, there were scores of them also written in Sanskritproper, down to the modern era. Their thematics are usually built around liter-ary romances, as with Ka ̄l.ida ̄sa’s original, but transposed to the courts, templesand residential palaces of Kerala.This calls our attention to the fact that throughout the shifts fromMan.iprava ̄l.am and the various early Pa ̄t.t.u works into Malayalam proper (gen-erally reckoned from the era of El ̄uttacchan), and indeed into modernity, San-skrit literary production continued a parallel life among the Brahmans and royalcourts of Kerala. This influence fed into Malayalam in the form of commentariesand digests, particularly on ritual and its ancillary disciplines like astrology,iconology, and architecture, as well as in guides to the complex social rituals ofKerala’s Nampu ̄tiri Brahmans. Digests on the tantric rituals of temple worship,for instance, span the fifteenth-century Put.ayu ̄r Bha ̄s.a, down to the eighteenth-century Kul ̄ikka ̄t.t.u Paccathat was eventually printed and is in common use today.This technical ritual literature found its didactic, nonritual counterpart in thepopular stream of Dravidian song-literature inaugurated by El ̄uttacchan. Thusin addition to the recasting of Sanskrit Epic and Puranic literature discussedearlier, there were a number of highly popular homiletic works that come downfrom the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, into modern print editions. Oftenthese were cast in the simple folk-meters like the pa ̄nathat was named after andused in lower-caste festivals of non-Brahmanical worship. One of the mostpopular of these, the Jña ̄na Pa ̄na, by one Pu ̄nta ̄nam Nampu ̄ tiri, fuses simplifiedVedantic philosophy with the bhakti approach into a kind of synthetic Hin-duism-for-the-masses, imparting basic notions of karma, gnosis, and liberation(Go ̄pikkut.t.an 1989). Legend claims that Pu ̄nta ̄nam himself was not learned inSanskrit, and that he came from a lower division of Brahmans not entitled tothe literature of hinduism in malayalam175"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"Vedic learning. Importantly, this suggests that not all Brahmans shared in theelite structures of socio-religious and political privilege, and it seems likely thatmany of the déclassé sections among them may have fueled and provided theirintellectual capital to the various movements of S ́u ̄ dra-based, popular religios-ity. In keeping with such a reading, there are barbed verses in the Jña ̄na Pinaonthe social degradation of Brahmans in their competition for courtly honors,their wayward life in the temple, their hunger for women, and the greed thatdrove their Vedic cultic expertise (Go ̄pikkut.t.an 1989: 77–8).Such works sometimes explicitly aimed to reach the lower castes and women.Pu ̄nta ̄nam is also supposed to have rendered the Kr.s.n.akarn.n.a ̄mr.taminto Malay-alam for his friend of the Va ̄riyar caste, and another popular and more interest-ing digest of Veda ̄nta, the Cinta ̄ratnam(Jewel of Reflection) is explicitly cast asthe teaching of a guru to his female disciple (Na ̄ra ̄yan.apil.l.a 1967: 7–10). Thislatter work has also a fascinating Vedantic deconstruction of temple worship,the backbone of Brahmanical and high-caste socioreligious claims to power inKerala. More antinomian aspects of worship surface more readily in the oral lit-eratures and rich culture of non-Brahmanic folk religion throughout Kerala,with its festivals of spirit possession by local deities, and its rites of liquor offer-ings and blood sacrifice. In a number of cases from the worship ofteyyams, forinstance, certain Vedantic claims to powers of the mind or tantric notions ofbodily powers may be drawn upon and wedded to the empowerment of lowercastes in worship. It is further clear, in a number of cases, that higher-caste devotees sometimes helped author such texts, in partnership with the lower-caste performers who transmitted them orally.From Religion towards Critique and Social ConsciousnessNotions of satire and critique in the literate traditions of Kerala Hindu literature,however, reached their highwater mark just at the brink of modernity with thetul.l.algenre of Kuñcan Nambya ̄r in the eighteenth century (S ́armma ̄ 1982). Thisalso represents the culmination of that trajectory we have noted to popularizethe temple arts. The legend behind this genre is that Nambya ̄r was a temple musi-cian who was once publicly criticized by his superiors for laxness in his accom-paniment of a performance. To avenge his hurt pride, he invented the newperformative mode oftul.l.al, and took it out of the temple theater into more pubicspaces where he stole away audiences. Modeled explicitly on the various forms of“dance” in popular low-caste festivals (tul.l.alis literally “jumping,” often in thecontext of spirit-possession cults), Nambya ̄r’s performance mode consisted of asingle performer dancing and singing, in a colorful costume, head-dress, andmake-up, to drummed accompaniment. His sung compositions, however, arecleverly crafted and artful literature. All of them are taken from the Sanskrit nar-rative materials of Epics and Pura ̄n.as found in the temple theater, but Nambya ̄r’sgenius was to cast into these roles all the characters found in his contemporary176rich freeman"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"society and hold them up for critique against the projected religious values.15Theroles of Epic kings, soldiery, and Brahmans, for instance, are filled out by Keralachieftains, Na ̄yar-caste militia, and Nampu ̄ tiris, with all of their contemporarycircumstances and foibles archly displayed. Nambya ̄r wrote at the time whenearly modern states (most notably Travancore) were developing and crushing theold local orders, and historians can clearly read in his satire the problematic shiftsin the agrarian and mercantile order of medieval Kerala that would eventuate incolonialism and modernity. This mode of critique was played out in the languageitself, both in overt criticisms of high Sanskritic style, which he states held nocharm for the common populace, and in deliberate sporting with different lin-guistic registers, including hyper-Sanskritic stretches that were clearly playful(Gan.e ̄s ́ 1996). While modern Kerala literature is most noted for its focus on socialproblems and reform, it is interesting to consider Nambya ̄r as the harbinger ofthis trend, sitting on the cusp of the late medieval and early modern periods. InNambya ̄r’s case, though, this observation and criticism of his surroundingsociety was wrought entirely in the mode of “traditional” Hindu mythology, inframes derived from, but equally subversive of, the high pretensions of Sanskrit.I conclude my overview in this way with Nambya ̄r, since he is usually con-sidered the last stellar Kerala writer of the premodern period. With the penetra-tion of colonial powers (to which Nambya ̄r already alludes in several places), theentire context of Kerala literature undergoes a series of progressive shifts intomodernity. Perhaps the most massively reorienting is the epistemic shift from aframe which assumes that the context of literature is continuous with the insti-tutions of Kerala’s Hinduism, to one in which the possibilities of a secular, mate-rially transformative, and revolutionary social vision were opened up, withliterature as its sounding board. Yet from another perspective, one could, I think,read the earlier articulation of literature, even in its pervasively Hindu mode, asregistering within it all of the tensions of its social and regional context, as thesewere reconfigured through the forces of history.In summation, we have seen how the “Hinduism” of Kerala can be tracedthrough a series of literary reworkings in linguistic, poetic, and semantic formand content. From its early origins as part of an autonomously Dravidian reli-gion of the immanent powers of nature and human society, worshipped throughthe charismatic force of local chiefs, the ancestral dead, and spirit possessedoracles, it developed a bhakti idiom of devotion that accommodated the northIndian gods of Sanskritic Brahmanism and its priestly class of literati to themartial and productive forces of the land. The sociocultural differences were pri-marily mediated through the temple and its various performative arts, and thearticulation of these with popular shrines through religious festivals and the folk-forms. These parallel religious worlds, coinciding with the schism incaste blocs and ritual norms of purity, were equally registered by the split in early Malayalam between two distinctive genres of poetic and thematic form –Man.iprava ̄l.am and Pa ̄t.t.u. I have suggested, however, that the religious environ-ment of tantrism, entangled with the sexual politics of intercaste relations andthe material concerns of sorcery, worked towards synthesis from above, whilethe literature of hinduism in malayalam177"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"the impetus of bhakti,exerted a persistent vernacular pressure from below. Wehave seen how with time, the distance between the strata closed, as newer mediating forms of performance, and new forums of literature, emerged underchanged historical circumstances. These were still explicitly religious in theirmotivation, however, and it is not until the modern transformation that thesefundamentally Hindu ideologies and institutions – as internally conflictual asthey were – came to be finally eclipsed by the conscious emergence of social relations in their own right as the fount of literary production.Notes1While I take Pollock’s point (1998) that we must be cautious in the facile assump-tion that vernacular literacy was fundamentally driven by a concern with propa-gating religion in popular milieus – recognizing that literary cultures were just asoften imbricated with the political aspirations of regional elites – it seems nonethe-less clear that the epistemes that framed these efforts were, almost inevitably, reli-giously valorized. The challenge is to understand how the political and religiousarticulated in terms of local social bases, transregional cultural forms, and their histories of interaction.2The Dravidian language family comprises the four literary languages of peninsularsouthern India (Tamil, Malayalam, Kannada, and Telugu), and a score of unwrit-ten tribal languages scattered mostly across southern and central India. These lan-guages are historically unrelated to, and clearly predate the arrival of, Sanskrit andits related Indo-Aryan languages in north India. The distribution of these major lan-guages in the south further coincides with uniquely related institutions of kinship,political and religious culture that were indigenously recognized under the termDra ̄vid.amany centuries before the modern Tamils co-opted the linguistic label, Dravidian, for their contemporary political movements. On the antiquity of thesecultural interrelationships, see Trautmann (1981), Freeman (1988), and myaccompanying chapter, this volume, on the teyyamtradition of Kerala.3The standard, and most readily available, histories of Malayalam literature inEnglish are Nair (1967), George (1968), and Chaitanya (1971). Relevant work inMalayalam is extensive, but will be cited here only where I owe a direct debt to anauthor, and for text-citations. My own attempts to rethink this field in light of mysocial scientific and historical interests, with fuller Malayalam citations can befound in Freeman (1998, and forthcoming).4A thorough and scholarly study of religion in the Can.kam period is wanting. Anumber of relevant sections in Hart (1975) and Hardy (1983) are helpful.

A member of a very low caste of weavers and leather-workers himself, the singer regularly performs this song together with the songsof many other Hindu devotional saints at all-night devotional sessions calledjagarans– the primary form of religious gathering in rural North India. And suchsongs, attributed to great devotees of the past, are the central form of devotionalliterature in North India in the vernacular languages associated with Hindi.The devotional movements that begin in the Tamil-speaking region of SouthIndia in the sixth to the ninth centuries of the Common Era sweep through theKannada-speaking region in the tenth to the twelfth centuries and up intoMarathi-speaking region in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries and thenacross the north of India by the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries to generate avast body of literature of both story and song. Regional dialects were takingshape during this linguistically formative period in the north within a body ofvernacular language – the spoken language of everyday interaction in contrastto Sanskrit. Called Hindui or Hindi by Muslims settling in the Delhi region, scholars refer to these emerging regional languages as new Indo-Aryan (McGregor 1992: 3–9). Fluid in their boundaries, they overlapped sufficiently sothat songs and stories could travel from devotee to devotee and through the performances of itinerant singers from region to region.The vernacular traditions of narrative and song in North India belong firstand foremost to the devotional or bhaktistrand of Hinduism, and the sainthoodof the songs’ composers is conferred not by some religious authority or after rigorous official inquiry but rather through the embrace of subsequent genera-tions of devotees, who have recorded, performed and expanded the traditions thatsurround them. The saints’ exemplary lives and their songs (as well as manymore subsequently composed in their names and styles) guide others on thebhaktipath and ideally cultivate and elicit the expressed all-encompassing lovefor God in those who hear and perform them. The most famous are the weaverKabı ̄r with his biting critique, the royal renouncer Mı ̄ra ̄baı ̄, the lover of Kr.s.n.aSu ̄rda ̄s, the founder of the Sikhs Na ̄nak, Na ̄mdev of the Va ̄rkarı ̄ tradition, theleather worker Raida ̄s, the Rajasthani devotee of the Lord Beyond Form Da ̄du ̄,and Tulsı ̄da ̄s, the poet of Ra ̄ma. But there are literally hundreds more. North Indian devotional literature is situated within a stream of religiousreform. Broadly referred to as the bhaktimovement, it is in fact a series of move-ments though bhaktior devotion is the defining feature of them all. Bhaj– theroot of the word bhakti– carries multiple meanings, including to apportion, toshare, to bestow, to enjoy, to possess, to experience, to practice, to cultivate, tochoose, to serve, to honor, to adore, and to love (Ramanujan 1993: 103–4 n. 2).Though translated as “devotion,” bhaktiimplies a complex and multi-dimensional relationship between human and divine, including adoration butalso partaking of every form of love possible between human beings, fromparental love to that of lovers. This love is mediated through the body, experi-enced through the senses, with devotees employing metaphors of sight, sound,taste, smell, and touch. They even speak sometimes as if they were God, losingnorth indian hindi devotional literature183"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"all awareness of themselves as separate, in an experience akin to possession bythe divine beloved. This passionate and intoxicating love may be spontaneous,seeming to take the devotee by storm, but it is also cultivated through ritual andsong (Ramanujan 1993: 103–69; Martin 1999a).The religious movements that were marked by such love left behind ritual action carried out by priests to focus on personal relationships betweenindividuals and God, with more mature devotees, saints of the past, and evenGod understood to serve as gurus to those who would deepen this relation. Somemovements were radically iconoclastic while others were closely connected tolocal temples and manifestations of the divine, mapping out mythic events onthe regional landscape. In all of them religious expression shifted away from theelite language of Sanskrit to the intimacy of local vernacular languages. Leadership within the community was based on religious experience ratherthan heredity (at least in the early stages of the movements), and these leaderscomposed songs of love, complaint, and praise to their chosen forms of God.Among their number were untouchables and women as well as brahmans. Allpeople were recognized as equal in the eyes of God and across rebirths, and communities worshipped and ate together, defying caste rules of purity,although actual social experiments of egalitarian living on a larger scale wereadmittedly few. The most significant attempt occurred among the Vı ̄ras ́aivas inthe twelfth century in the Kannada-speaking region (present day Karnataka)where a community more than one hundred and ninety thousand strong soughtto live without caste distinction, though the wider society did not tolerate thisfor long (Ramanujan 1973: 62–4). Low-caste saints sometimes had to defendtheir right to worship and prove their worthiness before God in trials engineeredby brahmanpriests outside the movements who felt their own religious author-ity was being threatened, and women saints faced similar trials before male reli-gious leaders even within the bhaktifold, according to the hagiographicaccounts.Institutional structures took shape with time, and hierarchies re-entered.Sects that initially refuted caste became like castes themselves, as their membersmarried only other members and passed religion down as a family heritagerather than an individual choice. Formal liturgies including the songs of par-ticular saints solidified, and elaborate rituals of devotion developed. Lineages ofleadership also took hold, sometimes hereditary, sometimes based on a guru’schoosing of a successor.Vis.n.u and S ́iva emerged as the primary focus of such devotion, with this sametype of organized devotion to the supreme Goddess or Devı ̄ developing some-what later. After the Tamil A ̄l.va ̄rs, Vis.n.u himself was largely supplanted in directworship by his avata ̄rs– the amorous Kr.s.n.a (who takes birth in Vr.nda ̄van amongthe cowherding people of Braj as detailed in Sanskrit in the Bha ̄gavata Pura ̄n.aand who is also the charioteer of Arjuna in the famous dialogue of the BhagavadGı ̄ta ̄) and Ra ̄ma (the upholder of the social and religious order and the hero ofthe epic Ra ̄ma ̄yan.awho must rescue his wife Sı ̄ta ̄ from the demon king Ra ̄van.a).Still others speak of God as beyond form of any kind under the name of Ra ̄m,the Formless One, the Imperceptible, and reject images, myths, and the rituals184nancy m. martin"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"of temple devotion. In many cases the saints sing of both God with form (sagun.)and without or beyond form (nirgun.) and juxtapose the two in a single song thatmay consider how the Lord who is the reality behind all that is could come toplay among his devotees as the child Kr.s.n.a does or could be encounteredthrough a temple image. Nevertheless, movements and saints are often charac-terized as either practicing nirgun.orsagun.devotion in an oppositional way(Hawley 1995a). Those who worship the nirgun.Lord have been called sants, aterm which means “one who knows the truth. . . [or] who has experienced Ultimate Reality” (Schomer and McLeod 1987: 2–3). The meaning of the term,however, has been generalized to mean “a good person” or a saint, and thus santis often also used to refer to any member of the larger devotional community,whether his or her orientation is sagun.ornirgun..These movements did not develop in a vacuum but built on previous tradi-tions and were in competition with other existing ones. The Na ̄th tradition wasa strong formative influence and continues to be a part of the religious milieu ofIndia (Briggs 1938; Gold 1992: 35–53). Na ̄th jogislooked back to S ́iva as thequintessentialjogiascetic and practiced hatha yogawith the aim of controllingthe physical body in an integration of physical and spiritual attainment. Icono-clasm, a radically nirgun.conception of Ultimate Reality, and a defiance of casteare hallmarks of this tradition, and Na ̄th jogisare known for their miraculouspowers as well, with Gorakna ̄th being the greatest guru of the sect and an arrayof songs and stories attached to him and subsequent gurus.Tantric streams from Hindu and Buddhist sources flowed into the formationofbhaktithrough the Na ̄ths and other sources. The fundamental practices oftantra involve working through the body to unify opposites and overcome allduality; elaborate rituals, diagrams, mantras, and visualizations are among thetechniques employed (Hess and Shukdev Singh 1983: 139–40). Other strains ofBuddhism also had their impact, and particularly in the south, bhaktisaints sawboth Buddhists and Jains as their competitors, and their stories and songs reflecttheir confrontations.Muslim traditions were strong in the medieval milieu in which bhaktigrew aswell, Sufis in a very open way and Isma’ilis in more disguised forms (Vaudeville1974; Khan 1997). The lines between the traditions were fluid with manyMuslims devoted to Hindu saints and many Sufipı ̄rshaving Hindu followers as well. Low castes converted en masseto Islam in order to move out of the hierarchy of caste but often without leaving behind all of their previous Hindupractices and traditions, even as Kabı ̄r’s caste may have. Both the Sufis and thebhaktisaints taught a path of overwhelming love for God, and many of theirpractices were similar.Bhaktiphilosophy and theology developed in opposition to Hindu advaitaphilosophers who argued that Ultimate Reality was an impersonal Oneness tobe realized rather than a supreme God to be loved. The bhaktasarticulated adesire to experience God rather than to become God, whether their orientationwas nirgun.orsagun.. Into this fecund mix of religious influences must be addedlocal traditions of worship and manifestations of the divine that played key rolesin the development of various regional sects.north indian hindi devotional literature185"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"Particular movements emerged in different regions at different times, eachwith its own set of saints, although later movements often included the saints ofearlier ones within their clan and all continue to this day. In the Tamil-speakingregion the sixth to the ninth centuries were the heyday of the A ̄l ̄va ̄rs (those“immersed in God”) who were dedicated to Vis.n.u and of the Na ̄yan ̄a ̄s whoseloving service was directed to S ́iva (Ramanujan 1993; Peterson 1989). Thesongs of both the A ̄l ̄va ̄rs and the Na ̄yan ̄a ̄s are deeply connected to the Tamilcountryside, addressing individually the particular manifestations of Vis.n.uand S ́iva in each of its many temples. In the Kannada speaking region in thetenth to twelfth century the Vı ̄ras ́aiva saints thrived. Theirs was a radically egali-tarian tradition, rejecting all manner of outward religious display which mightbe facilitated by wealth. The body was seen as the most important temple, andS ́iva was enshrined within. Devotees wandered as mendicants teaching this wayto God. Gender and caste were directly addressed in their songs as only thepassing accidents of birth and irrelevant to spiritual attainment (Ramanujan1973).North Indian devotional traditions may be said to begin in the Marathi-speaking region (modern day Maharashtra) in the thirteenth century withJña ̄nes ́var and his saintly brothers Nivr.ttina ̄th and Sopan and sister Muktaba ̄ı ̄,outcast from society because their father had been a renouncer returned to thehouseholder life. Jña ̄nes ́var’s Jña ̄nes ́variis recognized as a masterpiece of devo-tional literature, and together they are seen as the originators of a devotionalmovement that would be called the Va ̄rkarı ̄s (Ranade 1933). The saint Na ̄mdev’slife overlapped theirs and extended into the mid-fourteenth century, and he sangof the efficacy of reciting the name of God, of singing songs of praise, and ofspending one’s time in the company of other devotees, all practices affirmedacross the spectrum ofbhaktimovements (Callewaert and Lath 1989). Hestressed the attitude of the heart over outward acts of worship and addressedhis songs sometimes to the incarnate Lord Kr.s.n.a, other times to the One who isbeyond human imaginings. Both Na ̄th traditions and the Mahanubhava sectinfluenced the development of this sect, and earlier layers of S ́aiva tradition werecombined with Vais.n.ava devotion (Vaudeville 1987). Worship focuses on theregional deity Vit.t.hal, recognized as a form of Kr.s.n.a, who first became manifestat Pandharpur (now an essential pilgrimage destination for members of the sect)and whose longing for his devotees is likened to that of a cow separated from hercalf. The brahmanEkna ̄th added much to the literature of the Va ̄rkarı ̄s in the six-teenth century, including a Marathi translation and commentary on the storiesof Kr.s.n.a’s life, and the seventeenth-century s ́u ̄drasaint Tuka ̄ra ̄m sang in coarseand beautiful language of the nature of human existence, the mysteries of God,and the struggles of the devotional path (Chitre 1991). Poet saints emerged across north India from the fourteenth century onward.Ra ̄ma ̄nand is said to be a disciple of the famous bhaktiphilosopher theologian of South India, Ra ̄ma ̄nuja, and the guru of a number of renowned low-castesaints, though conflicting accounts are given of his life and religious practices(Burghart 1978).

He spares no one – both Hindu andMuslim religious leaders and the rulers of the land receive no mercy, and hepreaches a path of realization of the One who is beyond all distinctions andlimited human categories – the nirgun.Lord. He cries out:Brother, were did your two gods come from?Tell me, who made you mad?Ra ̄m, Allah, Keshav, Karim, Hari, Hazrat –So many names.So many ornaments, all one gold,It has no double nature. (Hess and Shukdev Singh 1983, 50–1)Again and again he hammers home the point that we must face death and ourown mortality if we are going to truly live:Make your own decision.See for yourself while you live.Find your own place.Dead, what house will you have? (Hess and Shukdev Singh 1983: 68)Instead of doing so, we are tied to our senses like an ox to an oil press going roundand round on the wheel of life, and we live under delusion, like a dog seeing itsown reflection and barking itself to death. And to those who think themselvesmore pure than others, he reminds us that all bodies are of the same clay andthe water we drink, whatever its source, has been the bathing place of humansand animals and passed through corpses and filth on its way to us. And milk?Trickling through bones, melting through flesh –Where does milk come from?That’s what you drink after lunch, pandit.And you call clay untouchable?(Hess and Shukdev Singh 1983: 57–8)Who then can claim to be more pure? Kabı ̄r’s message is strident and his language often coarse, and he is above alla preacher, denouncing all outward forms of religious practice as salvific inthemselves and calling his hearers into relationship with the One God (Hess andShukdev Singh 1983: 7–37). Yet the truth is not easily grasped – we must cometo hear the unstruck sound and to know its untellable story. Kabı ̄r had bothMuslim and Hindu followers, and it is said that at his death they fought over howto carry out his funeral rites. But when they pulled the cover away, they foundonly flowers where his body had been. These they then divided, the Muslimsburying their half and the Hindus burning theirs.north indian hindi devotional literature187"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"Early records of Kabı ̄r’s songs are found in three distinct sources (Hess 1987).TheBijakcontains only his works (Hess and Shukdev Singh 1983), but his songsare also found in the A ̄di Granthof the Sikhs and the manuscript collections of theDa ̄du ̄ panth, another nirgun.“path” or sect founded by Da ̄du ̄ , a cotton-carder (pos-sibly Muslim) living in Rajasthan in the latter half of the sixteenth century whofollowed in the footsteps of Kabı ̄r (Orr 1947; Callewaert 1988). Among the mostimportant of the latter are the thematic collections of the Sarva ̄n.gisof Rajab andof Gopalda ̄s and the Pañc-Va ̄nicollections recording songs of five saints: Da ̄du ̄,Kabı ̄r, Na ̄mdev, Raida ̄s, and Harda ̄s (Callewaert 1988; Callewaert and Beeck,1991; Callewaert 2000a). Both the A ̄di Granthand these seventeenth-centuryRajasthani Da ̄du ̄ panthi manuscripts provide a gold mine of early songs, especiallyfornirgun.saints. A sect, the Kabı ̄rpanth, has also been established in Kabı ̄r’s nameby those who share his low-caste status and for whose adherents Kabı ̄r hasreached almost divine status (Lorenzen 1987). A vast oral tradition of song existsas well, performed across North India today, which includes songs of Kabı ̄rtogether with the songs of many, many other saints (Martin 2000).Raida ̄s, another of the supposed disciples of Ra ̄ma ̄nanda from Banaras, isalternately said to be a pure nirgun.devotee or to blend nirgun.devotion with asagun.love of Ra ̄m (Callewaert and Friedlander 1992). A camar(an untouchableleatherworker whose caste-fellows dispose of the bodies of dead animals), hespeaks against the hierarchies of purity, approaching God with humility andutter dependence on divine grace and love, relying on the recitation of the nameof God to keep his mind and heart focused on his Lord in a world that paradesan endless stream of distractions (Hawley and Juergensmeyer 1988: 24–32). Hissongs too are included in the Sikh and Da ̄du ̄ panthi collections, and a low-castereligious movement devoted to him and known as the Raida ̄sis can be found inBanaras (Schaller 1995). There are epic oral song traditions recounting episodesfrom his life as well, sung among leatherworker communities from Banaras toRajasthan, which combine social protest with religious devotion, exposing thegreed and corruption of rulers and brahmanpriests alike and affirming thedignity and legitimacy of Raida ̄s and thus of other low-caste devotees.In the lineage ofnirgun.Hindu devotion, we also find the founder of the Sikhtradition, Na ̄nak, who lived in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth century inthe Punjab region (McLeod 1968). Stories abound of his debates with Na ̄th jogisand his encounters with Hindu and Muslim spiritual teachers. He advocated anirgun.devotion that focused on the importance of the Lord as guru and on thepractice of the repetition of the Name of God. Respected by both Hindus andMuslims, he laid out a path which transcends the particulars of both traditions,preaching adamantly against outward forms of worship including temples andmosques, religious scriptures, pilgrimage, and ritual. Even so the collection ofhis songs and those of other Sikh gurus was initiated by the fifth guru Arjan ina text that came to be known as the A ̄di Granthand also included the songs of anumber of other earlier saints referred to as bhagats(including Kabı ̄r, Raida ̄s,and Na ̄mdev).

InAndhra Pradesh, Vallabha ̄ was born to a Telegu brahmanfamily in the late fifteenth century (Barz 1992). Considered an avata ̄rof the mouth of Kr.s.n.a, hewas to found the Pustimarg, the way of grace, also called the Vallabha ̄samprada ̄yor “tradition.” Known as a great scholar, he traveled widely and bested advaitaphilosophers in debates from a young age, winning the title ofacarya. His argu-ment was straightforward – a true nondualist philosophy should not divide theworld into an illusory phenomenal world and the One reality behind it; ratherpureadvaita(s ́uddha ̄dvaita) would have to acknowledge that all is God – bothmanifest reality and the Oneness underlying it. The followers of Vallabha ̄worship Kr.s.n.a, particularly through an image that emerged from Govardhan hillin Vr.nda ̄van of his mountain-bearing form. The songs of eight poets, called theas.t.achap, constitute the formal liturgy of the samprada ̄y.The most well-known of the as.t.achappoet-saints is Su ̄rda ̄s, whose songs ofKr.s.n.a’s childhood and adolescence among the cowherding community of Brajdraw both singers and listeners inside of the emotional world of that divinedrama with its multiple forms of love for the incarnate Lord (Bryant 1978;Hawley 1984). His collected works, the Sur Sagar(Sur’s Ocean), number over5,000 songs, and as is the case with all these great medieval poet saints, clearlynot all these were composed by a single individual. Indeed the best we can do isto identify an early core of tradition attributed to him, as J. S. Hawley andKenneth Bryant have done, based on reliable manuscripts. For the most part themanuscripts we have of the saints’ songs appear initially to record the reper-toires of singers, with all the variation that this might imply. And successivesingers have expanded the traditions, the saints’ names conferring authority andindicating a particular style of devotion and poetic expression more than actualauthorship (Hawley 1988).Su ̄rda ̄s is said to have been blind but describes the emotional landscape of Kr.s.n.a’s childhood and adolescence in intricate detail. Some of the songsattributed to him speak of the child Kr.s.n.a, articulating the love of parents forchildren (vatsalya) and juxtaposing the Lord of All and the small boy of his incar-nation. Having seen him eating dirt as boys are want to do, his mother Yas ́odagrows irritated and says:“Mohan, won’t you spit out the mud?”. . . But he wouldn’t obey;he played a clever trick:He opened his mouth,and he showed her,and the Play unfolded . . .(Bryant 1978, 174)Seeing the divine drama of the cosmos unfold before her as she looks into whatis not only the mouth of her son but also of God, she is completely overwhelmed,north indian hindi devotional literature189"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"as the poet takes the hearer also from the ordinary world into sudden recogni-tion of the divine. Other songs recount with wonder how the one who is the Lordof the three worlds is yet unable, in his child’s body, to step across the thresholdof the house without tripping, and others describe his delightful childish appear-ance and his mischievous behavior, his miraculous defeat of murderous demonsand his propensity for stealing butter (Bryant 1978; Hawley 1983). Still others speak of his adolescent love play with the young cowherding gopı ̄women and particularly with his lover Ra ̄dha ̄ – married to another yet unableto resist her Lord; of his irresistible flute playing and his amorous appearanceand of the vicissitudes of love. Indeed, transforming the language and emotionsof erotic love (madhurya) into devotion to God as other devotional saints beforehim had done, Su ̄rda ̄s speaks as one of the gopı ̄s, describing Kr.s.n.a’s (Hari’s)appearance to a companion:Look, my friend, look at Hari’s nimble eyes.How could the shimmer of lotuses and fishes,Even the darting wagtails,Compare in charm with this? . . .Look at that beauty: slender, mind-entrancing curls,How they ramble uncontrolledOver eyebrows just below . . .Hari is a mirroring, the image of all desire.(Hawley and Juergensmeyer 1988: 106)Desire and the love of union inevitably yield the pain of separation (viraha)which serves as another theme within Su ̄rda ̄s’s songs, some addressing thelonging in temporary separation and some set in the time after Kr.s.n.a has leftVr.nda ̄van and the land of Braj for Mathura, never to return. His companionUddha ̄v comes to the gopı ̄sto try to persuade them to take up yogic austeritiesin Kr.s.n.a’s absence, but they show him clearly that they have already masteredfasting, sleepless and one-pointed meditation, and more through their undyinglove. Within the corpus of Su ̄rda ̄s’s songs are also songs of supplication and complaint (vinaya) apart from the narrative world of Kr.s.n.a’s incarnation(Hawley 1984) in which the poet speaks directly in his own voice, lamenting:Life has stumbled, stumbled and unraveled,Roped to politics and salary and sons.Without my even noticing, my life has ambled offAnd gotten tangled in a snare of illusion so foolproofthat now I cannot break it or loosen its grip . . .(Hawley and Juergensmeyer 1988: 115)Much of the imagery of these songs and also of the practices of Kr.s.n.a devo-tion focus on the remembrance and reenactment of the stories of Kr.s.n.a’s incar-nation and on cultivating the emotions experienced by all the characters wholove Kr.s.n.a in various ways within this divine drama – those who serve him, hisparents, his companions, and his gopı ̄lovers. The Sanskrit Bha ̄gavata Pura ̄n.a,190nancy m. martin"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"composed in the ninth or tenth century in South India, casts this narrative in adevotional light, particularly in book X which becomes the inspiration for muchVa i s.n.ava literature in North India (Entwistle 1987: 22–42). More than a story,this drama becomes map and mirror for divine-human love, an eternal dramain which each devotee has a role. A tradition of religious dramatic performancealso develops, with the texts of these plays forming another genre of devotionalliterature, spiced with humor, social critique, and romance and fully enacted in Vr.nda ̄van and elsewhere on a regular basis (Hawley 1981; Wulff 1984;Haberman 1988). In his songs Su ̄rda ̄s invites the hearer inside this world andinto the emotions of its characters, taking on multiple personas, as do otherVa i s.n.ava poets.Even as Vallabha ̄ca ̄rya’s disciples formed the Pustimarg in Vr.nda ̄van, inBengal another Kr.s.n.a devotee, Caitanya, took birth. An ecstatic saint who oftenfell into trance and states of divine madness, he is said to have been an incar-nation of both Ra ̄dha ̄ and Kr.s.n.a. All the possible range of emotions associatedwith love wracked his body and heart, from the deepest despair at his divinebeloved’s absence to the supreme bliss of union. He popularized a form ofworship involving singing and dancing, and the six Goswamis who were his disciples also went to Vr.nda ̄van in the early sixteenth century and founded the Gaudiya Vais.n.ava sect: Ru ̄ p, Sana ̄tan, Jiv, Gopal Bhatt, Raghunathdas, andRaghunath Bhatt. The saint Nimbarka had arrived there earlier and foundedanothersamprada ̄ydevoted to Kr.s.n.a and named after him, and Hit Harivams, acontemporary of Ru ̄ p and Sana ̄tan, was the founding figure of a fourth, theRa ̄dha ̄vallabh samprada ̄y, which glorified and deified Ra ̄dha ̄, as the songs of itsfounder clearly articulate (McGregor 1992: 88–9). The convergence of thesegroups on the site of Kr.s.n.a’s legendary incarnation made this a major center ofVa i s.n.ava literary production in the sixteenth century, and the language of thisregion, Braj Bha ̄s.a, predominated (Entwistle 1987: 136–73).Sects continued to multiply as the followers of other extraordinary devoteesformed new communities to continue their founder’s particular teachings,among others the Ramsnehi samprada ̄ysin eighteenth-century Rajasthan, advo-cating a blending ofnirgun.andsagun.devotion in their praise of Ra ̄m. A tradi-tion of S ́aiva devotion had developed in Kashmir, and devotion to the Devı ̄especially in her forms as Durga and Ka ̄lı ̄ grew, particularly in Bengal. Ramprasad Sen is perhaps the most well-known Bengali poet addressing Ka ̄lı ̄(Nathan and Seely 1982), and Lalla the most famous Kashmiri S ́aiva poet saint(Odin 1999). Yet there were other saints also in North India who seem to havebeen appreciated by many but to have stood outside of formal sectarian affilia-tion, their songs not a part of any official liturgy. Tulsı ̄da ̄s and Mı ̄ra ̄baı ̄ are twosuch saints.Tulsı ̄da ̄s was an educated brahmanfrom eastern India who settled in Banaras.Though he composed a large number of songs in praise to Ra ̄m and a small set also for Kr.s.n.a, he is most well-known for his telling of the story of Ra ̄m andSı ̄ta ̄ entitled the Ramcaritmanasor “The Holy Lake of the Acts of Ra ̄m,” com-posed in the vernacular language of Avadhi in the latter half of the sixteenthnorth indian hindi devotional literature191"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"century. More than ten thousand lines in length, this devotional epic poemrecounts the adventures of Ra ̄m, with an elaborate set of frame stories that allow the incorporation of additional mythic material and further theologicalreflection as S ́iva tells the story to Pa ̄rvatı ̄, the crow Bhusundi to Vis.n.u’s vehicleGarud.a, the Upanis.adic sage Yajñavalkya to Bharadvaj, and Tulsı ̄da ̄s to his audience. Within his telling of the tale, Tulsı ̄da ̄s seeks to cultivate deep devotionto Ra ̄ma but also to reconcile and integrate Vais.n.ava and S ́aiva devotion, nirgun.andsagun.perspectives, and advaita andbhaktireligiosity. Situated within a vaststream of both Sanskrit and vernacular literature surrounding Ra ̄ma, Tulsı ̄da ̄sis clearly influenced not only by Va ̄lmikı ̄’s Ra ̄ma ̄yan.a(though his Ra ̄ma isthoroughly divine unlike Va ̄lmikı ̄’s great but very human hero) and the SouthIndian telling of the Adhya ̄tma Ra ̄ma ̄yan.aor “Spiritual Ra ̄ma ̄yan.a” (incorporat-ingadvaitaideals with Ra ̄m seen as both an incarnation of Vis.n.u and the per-sonification of Ultimate Reality or Brahman and portraying only a shadow ofSı ̄ta ̄ rather than Sı ̄ta ̄ herself being abducted by the demon Ra ̄van.a) but also by the Kr.s.n.a tradition in his portrayal of Ra ̄m’s childhood (Lutgendorf 1991;Richmond 1991).Tulsı ̄da ̄s’s Ramcaritmanasis extremely popular and the subject of regularrecitation, both personal and public, and full-scale enactment as well as anexpository tradition ofkatha. The Ra ̄mlı ̄la ̄ carried out every year by theMahara ̄ja of Banaras is the most elaborate, lasting a month with various spe-cific locales on the eastern shore of the Ganges in Ramnagar identified with par-ticular episodes, and all the characters played by carefully selected and preparedyoung brahmanboys (Hess and Schechner 1977; Lutgendorf 1991). With thisvernacular telling, Tulsı ̄da ̄s made the story of Ra ̄ma accessible to all, apparentlyupsetting some within the brahmancommunity of his day in his seeming dese-cration of a sacred text. Stories attest to the Ramcaritmanas’ full acceptance assacred literature of the highest level, however, after the volume rose miracu-lously to the top of a stack of Sanskrit scriptures under which it had been placedand locked in a temple overnight (Lutgendorf 1991: 8–10). Though brahmanic opposition may have occurred, Tulsı ̄da ̄s’s telling also contains passages that affirm the existing social hierarchy at numerous points,some seemingly aimed at keeping women and S ́u ̄drasalike “in their place,” and also recount some actions on the part of Ra ̄m, problematic for one who is said to be God, which generate a literature addressing the resulting doubts that arise(Lutgendorf 1991: 392–409). Tulsı ̄da ̄s is praised and the Ramcaritmanasembraced by people of multiple religious orientations, offering a point of meetingbetween members of divergent samprada ̄ys, in line with the synthetic and inclusivist nature of the text.A second saint who falls outside of the institutional structure ofpanthsandsamprada ̄ysis Mı ̄ra ̄baı ̄, said to have lived in the first half of the sixteenthcentury.1A daughter of a ra ̄jput royal family in Marwar (western Rajasthan),she was forced to marry into the family of the rulers of Mewar (southernRajasthan) to cement a political alliance. But her love was only for Kr.s.n.a, andher marital family tried to kill her when she did not behave as a woman of her192nancy m. martin"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"station should, singing and dancing in public temples and conversing with holymen and people from all castes. In her deeply personal songs she pours out herdefiant love and intense longing for her Lord. Not a preacher in the style of Kabı ̄r,she rejects caste and gender restrictions through her actions more than herwords, and she need undergo no imaginative change of gender to identify withthegopı ̄sas Su ̄rda ̄s did, giving her words an unmatched emotional directness.Songs attributed to her share some of the imagery of Vr.nda ̄van but also speakher love in the first person. She draws, as do other poets, on the tropes of classi-cal and folk love lyrics as well as the forms and themes of other folk and womensongs, as she declares her love and renounces her royal life and marriage to takeup the life of a wandering mendicant. When she is said to have a guru at all, it is almost always Raida ̄s the leather-worker, but more often she has none, and her behavior as a woman leads to anunderlying ambivalence toward her just below the surface of an almost univer-sal admiration. Clearly loved by people of many devotional sects, based on thenumber who tell her story and record and sing her songs, she is still not formallyincorporated into any, perhaps because her challenge to gender norms is tooradical, because she is too sagun.in her devotion for the nirgun.samprada ̄ys, orbecause she acknowledges no authority before Kr.s.n.a, even a guru. We have noearly manuscripts of her works, as we do of Kabı ̄r, Raida ̄s, and Su ̄rda ̄s, and thetraditions which surround her are unquestionably composite and stubbornlymultiple.In one song she speaks audaciously of having purchased her Lord whom shecalls Govind, the Cowherd, in the market –Mother, I bought Govind!You say in secret;I took him openly,playing a drum.Some say she paid a high price, but she says no, having weighed him in thebalance and given so little in exchange, though she paid with her life. She begsher Lord, the Dark One Sya ̄m, to come and dwell in her eyes – they have betrayedher by letting him into her heart, and now she cannot bear to be away from him.She claims to have married him in a dream, bound now irrevocably to him, andshe laments his seeming absence, charging him with being a renouncer, a jogi,who having seduced her with sweet words now callously walks away. She vowsto become a renouncer as well and to go in search of him. In one such famoussong, she speaks of the annihilation of self in a union of merger, singing:I will build a funeral pyre of sandalwood and aloe;light it by your own handWhen I am burned away to cinders;smear this ash upon your limbs.. . . let flame be lost in flame.north indian hindi devotional literature193"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"And in still other songs she addresses the ruler of Mewar, the rana(usuallyidentified as her earthly husband though sometimes said to be either her father-in-law or her brother-in-law in order to soften the degree of her rebel-liousness). She rejects all that he has to offer her and voluntarily takes on the lifeof the poor. In successive verses and songs she rejects living in palaces, riding onelephants, eating sweet confections, wearing fine clothes and jewelry, to live ina hut, walk on foot, eat dry scraps of bread, and wear a rough shawl and thewhite of a widow or the saffron of a renouncer, ornamented only with a stringof prayer beads. In a common refrain she sings:What can Mewar’s ruler do to me?If God is angry, all is lost,But what can the Rana do?And what can he do if she does not want anything he has to offer? When suchsongs are sung within low-caste communities, they provide a clear language ofresistance against the values and privileges of the ruling class and upper castesas Mı ̄ra ̄baı ̄ stands in solidarity with the underprivileged (Martin 2000; Mukta1994). Her compelling life story adds a deeper layer of meaning to this and manyother songs attributed to her, and the story of her devotion, suffering andtriumph is extremely popular, told in almost every conceivable narrative genrefrom films, comic books, and novels to folk dramas, epic songs, and more standard compendiums of the lives of saints.Indeed we find the stories of the saints retold in a wide range of vernacularliterary genres, with the stories of over 200 appearing first in the Bhaktamalor“Garland of Devotees” composed by Na ̄bhada ̄s (a member of the Ra ̄ma ̄nandi sectliving in Galta, Rajasthan) around 1600 ce(Callewaert and Snell 1994).Na ̄bhada ̄s catches the essence of each saint’s life and character in a few shortlines of verse and sets the standard for subsequent bhaktamalsby Dhruvda ̄s (earlyseventeenth century), Raghavda ̄s (ca. 1713), and others. Commentaries attend each bhaktamal, offering fuller narratives, beginning with Priyada ̄s’sBhaktirasabodhini Tika(1712) commentary on Na ̄bhada ̄s. The recitation of thesetexts remains an active part of devotional life, and though each of the composersbelonged to a different branch of devotional Hinduism – Na ̄bhada ̄s was aRa ̄ma ̄nandi, Raghavda ̄s a member of the Vais.n.ava Ra ̄dha ̄vallabha ̄samprada ̄y,Dhruvda ̄s a nirgun.Da ̄du ̄ panthi, and Priyada ̄s a follower of Caitanya as well as ofNa ̄bhada ̄s – they all honored a broad family of saints devoted to God both withand beyond form. Standard episodes structure the tales – tests the saints mustendure imposed by secular and religious authorities, experiences of conversionfor male saints, the overcoming of marriage for women saints, and more(Ramanujan 1982; Lorenzen 1995b).The saints’ lives are narrated in the Punjabi Pothipremabodh (1693) and theMarathi Bhaktivijaya(1762) of Mahipati, and their songs are threaded togetherwith narrative, each composition contextualized in life events, in Nagridas’Padaprasangmala(early eighteeth century) (Callewaert 1994: 28–9; Abbott andGodbole 1988). Further, saints’ lives are individually the subject ofparcaisbyAnantada ̄s, Jangopal, Sukhsaran and others which provide both introductions194nancy m. martin"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"(paricay) and recount the miracles (paraca) that surround their lives (Callewaert1994, 2000b; Lorenzen 1991, 1996). Sikh collections known janma-sa ̄khı ̄sorbirth stories report anecdotes from the life of Na ̄nak (McLeod 1968: 3–15), andaccounts such as the Caurasi Vais.n.avan ki Varta, the Accounts of the Eighty-fourVais.n.avas(1620ce) by Gokulnath, record episodes from the lives of saints of thePustimarg, thereby illustrating the practical implications of the teachings ofVallabha ̄ca ̄rya (Barz 1994). Further, episodes from the saints’ lives appear in the songs of other saints andin some seemingly biographical songs, sometimes attributed to the saints them-selves and other times clearly composed by later devotees. There is a sense inwhich the saints all belong to one devotional community, the satsangor “gath-ering of the true,” that transcends time, and so we find stories of their meetings(however historically improbable) and records of extended debates or gostibetween them (Lorenzen 1996: 153–203). Further, their lives provide the characters and plot for religious dramas called lı ̄la ̄sperformed along with thelife of Kr.s.n.a and Ra ̄ma with increasing regularity and also for regional folk dramatic forms as well as staged dance performances and films beginning in thesilent era. Among low-caste singers we sometimes also find epic songs telling moreextended tales of their lives on a par with the textual traditions but usually witha more humanly realistic and less refined portrayal, as in the Janma PatriofMı ̄ra ̄baı ̄. In this epic song sung by low-caste leatherworkers and weavers, thesaint beats her servants as a woman of her high caste might when they bringthe wedding garments for the marriage in which she wants no part, and she iscast out by her royal husband specifically because of her association with thecamarRaida ̄s though she begs him to let her live in a hut within the palace wallsand weave his garments, taking on the identity of those who sing this song(Martin 1999b). Stories associated with Raida ̄s and Kabı ̄r also come to life inlow-caste communities through the medium of song.All these narrative genres and the particular songs sung in the saints’ namesvary dramatically depending on the social, regional, and religious location ofboth performer and audience, but the saints are well-loved and familiar charac-ters within the world of North Indian devotees and provide the warp and woofwith which to weave a wide array of tales and to speak multiple and sometimesdivergent truths, emerging out of very different life experiences. The narrativessurrounding their lives as well as the tales of Kr.s.n.a, Ra ̄ma and other deities,coupled with the full range of emotions and experiences that come with devo-tion to God, are the primary subjects of the devotional literature of North India,performed and sung as well as written, marked by overwhelming abundance andongoing creative participation.Note1A comprehensive discussion of the traditions of story and song related to Mı ̄ra ̄baı ̄can be found in my book Mı ̄ra ̄baı ̄, forthcoming with Oxford University Press.north indian hindi devotional literature195"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"ReferencesAbbott, Justin E. and Godbole, N.

These teachings are thought tohave been revealed in sacred scriptures and propagated through the generationsin traditions of ritual observance and theology. Many S ́aivas have also wor-shipped the Goddess, S ́iva’s consort and power (s ́akti), as the esoteric heart oftheir religion, and it is often impossible to meaningfully distinguish betweenS ́aiva and S ́a ̄kta traditions. Every culture creates its own forms (Castoriadis1997: 84) and in the following pages I shall discuss the forms that S ́aiva tradi-tions produced and hope to convey something of the S ́aiva religious imaginaire.Thisimaginaireis distinctive within the Indic traditions and relates to widercultural and political history, both insofar as it has corroborated and upheld thevalues and goals of mainstream orthodox society and in the ways it has chal-lenged those norms. On the one hand the S ́aiva imagination has been in linewith the instituting power of particular regions, on the other it has brought tolife a world that undermines that power through its promotion of a vision of theself that transcends social institutions and political stability. It is this ambiguitythat shares many of the wider goals of collective life while eroding those goalsthrough promoting a subjectivity external to them that is a characteristic ofS ́aiva traditions. It is in this truly creative dynamic in which S ́aiva values areembedded in social institutions, such as caste and kingship, while simultane-ously undermining those values, that the genius of the tradition resides. It isperhaps not a coincidence that this ambiguity is reflected in the ultimate imag-inary signification of the tradition, S ́iva himself, as the erotic ascetic (O’Flaherty1981), as family man and vagabond, as form and formless, and as transcendenceand immanence.In this chapter I will focus on early S ́aiva traditions, and although I will brieflydiscuss the fifteenth-century Kerala tradition, I will not venture much past theeleventh century. In effect, largely due to limitations of space I will not deal with"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"developments of S ́aivism during most of the last millennium, which includes the Na ̄th tradition, the traditions of later north India, the Siddha or Cittartradition in Tamilnadu, nor the S ́aiva Veda ̄nta of the S ́an.kara ̄ca ̄ryas and theirmonastic institution (mat.has). I can only justify this exclusion on the groundsthat the important doctrinal foundations and practices are established duringthe earlier period and the later traditions are rooted in these earlier forms. Butit is to the indigenous understanding of what a S ́aiva tradition is that we mustturn first.The Idea of a S ́aiva TraditionRecent scholarship has problematized the idea of “tradition,” particularly in theWest, arguing that traditions are not unchanging, historical trajectories, but arerather re-formed and adapted to changing political and social circumstances(Heelas 1996; Hobsbawn and Ranger 1983). The past is constructed to suit theidentity needs of each generation. While of course it is true that in a south Asiancontext traditions change and are particularly challenged by modernity (Smith2002), perhaps more stable social continuity has meant that until recentlytraditions have changed at a slower rate. There are certainly traditions of vedicpractice that have survived historical contingency, such as the Nambudri vedicrecitation, which go back possibly thousands of years (Staal 1963). S ́aiva ritualpracticed today was certainly extant in early medieval sources and worship ofS ́iva in some form occurs very early in the history of Hindu traditions. While thisis too large a topic to enter into here, involving as it does the question of the rela-tion of ritual to wider social and political history, there are clearly continuitiesof S ́aiva practice that reach back into the past. Rather than looking at S ́aivatraditions in terms of the western or western-derived categories of “Hinduism”and “religion,” to understand the idea of a S ́aiva tradition it is more illuminat-ing to look at indigenous S ́aiva classifications.There is a tension between an externalist understanding that would analyzetradition in terms of history and the way a tradition is constructed in a particu-lar historical circumstance and the indigenous, essentialist understanding of tradition as stemming from a timeless source. This is a large issue and theproblem of externalist and internalist discourse is as relevant to Hindu traditionsas to Christianity or Islam. While the indigenous view of tradition is clearlylegitimate from the insider’s perspective and important more generally, it is often challenged by historical, philological scholarship. Certainly living tradi-tions can accept and absorb the findings of philological scholarship (asChristianity has done) and externalist accounts can function as corrective read-ings of tradition: text-historical accounts are not necessarily incompatible withreligious accounts of revelation. This chapter is written from the perspective ofexternalist, historical-philological scholarship, but which nevertheless regardsindigenous claims about tradition to be important and legitimate. At the verythe s ́aiva traditions201"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"least the indigenous account of tradition shows how the transmission of know-ledge was perceived in a particular social context. It is also not precisely clearwhat the relation is between S ́aiva accounts of tradition, that is, the S ́aiva self-descriptions, and the historical reality of which they are an index. It is thereforeimportant and necessary – particularly in view of the lack of other sources – tobegin with the S ́aiva concept of tradition. It is largely, but not only, these indige-nous self-descriptions that inform my account of the historical trajectory of thetraditions, but this account is nevertheless from an external perspective, usingthe indigenous account to construct a coherent historical narrative.The S ́aiva understanding of tradition has been to see it in terms of a “stream”(srotas) or line of transmission of texts and practices, flowing through thegenerations from teacher to disciple. Another term used is S ́aivaa ̄mna ̄ya, a S ́aivaclassification associating traditions of scripture with the four directions or a clas-sification of five emanating from the five mouths of S ́iva (Padoux 1994: 35–40;Brunner et al. 2000: 200; Dyczkowski 1988: 66–85). Such a tradition is trans-mitted through textual commentary and exegesis and through the lineage ofteachers, the guru santa ̄naorsantati. Another term used in S ́a ̄kta or Kula textsisovalli, initiatory lineages (six in number) which are “currents of conscious-ness” (jña ̄naprava ̄ha) flowing from a transcendent source through the founder ofthe particular lineage (Brunner et al. 2000: 258). The source of such a streamor torrent of transmission in the case of the a ̄mnaya is believed to be S ́iva. From him the teachings are generally transmitted to the Goddess and from herthrough a series of divine and semi-divine intermediaries to the human world,for the kind of knowledge revealed through revelation is adapted to the abilitiesof beings to receive it (MVT 1.24). For example, the ninth- or tenth-century roottext of the Kashmiri S ́aiva tradition, the Ma ̄linı ̄vijayottara Tantradeclares itself tobe derived from the “mouth of the supreme Lord” (parames ́amukha) (MVT 1.7),from where it is transmitted through a series of intermediaries, namely the LordPares ́a to the Goddess (Devı ̄), thence to her son Kuma ̄ra, who in turn transmitsthe teachings to Brahma ̄’s four sons who transmit it to the human world (MVT1.2–4, 14). The tenth-century Kashmiri theologian Abhinavagupta, likewisetraces the guru lineage of the esoteric “family” (kula) tradition to the four my-thical figures, the Lords Khagendra, Ku ̄rma, Mes.a, and Macchanda, and thenceto S ́iva (TA 29.29–32; Dyczkowski 1988: 62, 68–9; Goudriaan and Gupta 1981:5). Similarly, the sage Vasugupta, having received a system of teachings fromnumerous perfected male and female beings (siddhasandyoginı ̄s) who made hisheart pure, received teachings from S ́iva who revealed in a dream that they wereinscribed upon a stone on the Maha ̄deva mountain (namely the S ́iva Su ̄tras) (SSV:p. 1). During this transmission process the teachings are believed to become con-densed and accessible to the limited understanding of the receivers.Other examples could be cited, but the point is that tradition in S ́aivism isderived from a divine source and is understood in cosmological terms. Indeed,S ́aivism could be said to be a cosmological religion in which tradition is not ahuman construction but is given through a process of transformation throughlevels of a hierarchical cosmos to the human world. It is the guru who is the202gavin flood"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"embodiment of this tradition and who is the channel of divine grace (anugraha)to the community of disciples. The guru lineage or santa ̄nais therefore an expres-sion of S ́iva’s power (s ́akti) (SSV: p. 60) and the guru, at least in monistic S ́aivism,is identified with S ́iva as one who liberates beings through bestowing initia-tion (dı ̄ks.a ̄) and giving power to mantra (mantravı ̄rya) (SN: pp. 52–3). Even indualistic S ́aivism, S ́iva enters the guru for the purposes of initiation. The gurubecomes the embodiment of tradition, reveals the supreme, liberating truth(tattva) to the disciple (SSV: p. 59) and reveals the structure of the hierarchicalcosmos. The Ma ̄linı ̄vijayottara Tantradefines the guru in these terms:He who knows the meaning of the all the levels of the cosmos (sarva-tattva ̄ni), isthe guru equal to me (matsamah.) [i.e. S ́iva] who has taught the illumination of thepower of mantra (mantravı ̄ryapraka ̄s ́ah.). Men who are touched, spoken to and seenby him with a delighted mind (prı ̄tacetasa ̄) are released from sin (pa ̄pa) even in sevenlifetimes. (MVT 3.10–11)Because of this emphasis on tradition as a stream flowing through thegenerations from a divine source into the guru, the distinctions between S ́aivaand S ́a ̄kta traditions become blurred. Some texts such as the Yoginı ̄hr.daya, whichforms part of the root text of the S ́rı ̄ Vidya ̄ cult, are clearly S ́a ̄kta in orientation.What has becomes known as “Kashmir” S ́aivism, a nondualistic traditiondeveloping from at least the ninth century, identifies S ́iva with undifferentiatedconsciousness and also identifies this condition with a form of the Goddess Ka ̄lı ̄called Ka ̄lasam.kars.inı ̄ (see below). The more esoteric the S ́aiva traditions are, themore there is a tendency to focus upon the Goddess.The implications of this for understanding not only S ́aiva traditions but thewider field of Hinduism are great. Firstly, this understanding of tradition and theemphasis on the guru indicates strong decentralizing processes. While the textsof revelation are important, it is above all the revelation as the living traditionof the guru lineage that animates the tradition and through which the grace ofS ́iva is believed to flow. Here text becomes performance and the texts’ teachingsembodied in the human guru. Secondly this structure which places such greatemphasis on the teacher–disciple relationship, allows for a kind of particularismor individualism which is yet impersonal, insofar as tradition is designed totranscend personality or limited sense of ego (aham.ka ̄ra). It is in this relationshipthat the transmission of tradition (and the grace of S ́iva) occurs. The boundariesof the S ́aiva and S ́a ̄kta traditions are therefore sufficient to ensure transmissionthrough the generations yet are also porous in allowing the influence of other,related traditions. This can be seen by S ́aiva theologians quoting from a range ofsources and borrowing from different traditions. Abhinavagupta, for example,was initiated into a number of S ́aiva systems and the Kashmiri theologianUtpala ̄ca ̄rya quotes with approval a text of the Vais.n.ava Pa ̄ñcara ̄tra tradition, theJaya ̄khyasam.hita ̄(Span dı ̄p: pp. 6–7). This is not to say, of course, that the S ́aivatheologians regarded all revelation as equal; they did not. Rather each newrevelation incorporated the earlier within it at a lower level and so, while a textthe s ́aiva traditions203"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"of a different tradition might be quoted with approval, it is generally onlyregarded as a truth emanating from the level of the cosmos from which it derives.Later, esoteric teachings transcend the previous revelation.While these traditions maintain a hierarchical structure in the classifica-tion of revelation, as we will see, we nevertheless have in the S ́aiva understand-ing of tradition an example of the decentralizing strategies of what we call“Hinduism,” which should make us skeptical of the usefulness of the categoryin a historical context. While S ́aiva authors were keen to make totalizing claimsabout the universal truth of their teachings, the model of tradition shared by allS ́aiva schools is inherently pluralistic in the idea of the guru lineage, while simul-taneously being hierarchical in its assumption of a graded cosmos or ontologyand a graded teaching. These initiatory lineages have been extremely importantin the history of S ́aivism and have mostly been associated with groups of textscalled Tantra. But there has also been a more general temple S ́aivism associatedwith Sma ̄rta brahmanism. As Sanderson has shown, the term S ́aiva is techni-cally restricted to an initiate into one of the S ́aiva systems, while the termMahes ́vara has been used for a brahmin worshipper of S ́iva within the Sma ̄rtadomain (Sanderson 1988b: 660–4). It is Sanderson’s general mapping of thesesystems in the early medieval period that I follow here (Sanderson 1985; 1988;1988) although a more complete mapping of the traditions by him, which willrevolutionize our understanding of S ́aivism and the history of Indian religionsmore generally, will have to wait (Sanderson, forthcoming). But before we tracethis history a few remarks on the earliest indications of reverence for S ́iva andthe development of S ́aiva traditions are necessary.Early and Pura ̄nic S ́aivismSome scholars maintain that the worship of S ́iva goes back many thousands ofyears in the subcontinent to the Indus valley civilization, where steatite sealshave been found suggestive of a deity akin to S ́iva. The famous “Pas ́upati” sealshows a seated, perhaps ithyphallic, horned figure surrounded by animals. SirJohn Marshall has claimed that this is a prototype of S ́iva as the yogin andPas ́upati, the Lord of animals (Marshall 1931: 52). But is not clear from the sealsthat this is a proto-S ́iva figure and Asko Parpola has convincingly suggested thatthe seal is in fact a seated bull, almost identical to figures of seated bulls foundon early Elamite seals of ca. 3000–2750 bc(Parpola 1994: 248–50). It may be,of course, that elements of S ́iva’s later iconography – such as the crescent moonin his hair – can be traced to this period but unless the Indus Valley script is deci-phered, these seals can only be suggestive. There are early textual references toRudra, arguably a forerunner of S ́iva, one of whose epithets is “auspicioius”(s ́iva), in the R.g Veda. Here three hymns are addressed to Rudra, the “roarer’. Heis clothed in an animal skin, brown, with a black belly and a red back. Even at this time he is an ambiguous deity who is like a ferocious beast destroying204gavin flood"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"families and livestock, but yet who is also a benevolent healer of disease (R.g Veda2.33, 1.43; 1.114). A famous hymn in the R.g Veda, the hundred names of Rudra(s ́atarudriya), speaks further of this ambiguous nature, a hymn which is referredto in the S ́iva Pura ̄n.aand is still recited in S ́iva temples today (Gonda 1979:75–91).But it is only with the S ́veta ̄s ́vatara Upanis.ad, composed some time prior to theBhagavad Gı ̄ta ̄, that a theism focused upon Rudra-S ́iva begins to emerge in theliterature. This text is important in marking a link between the earlier monisticUpanis.ads and the later theistic traditions. Here Rudra is elevated from the feraldeity on the edges of society to the status of the supreme being as the cause ofthe cosmos, the magician (ma ̄yin) who produces the world through his power(s ́akti), yet who transcends his creation. He is the Lord who, by his grace(prasa ̄da), liberates the soul from its journey from body to body due to its actions.The seeds of S ́aiva theology are here and indeed the terms “guru” and “bhakti”occur for the first time in the text (S ́veta ̄s ́vatara6.23), although more than likelythis passage is a later interpolation. But certainly the seeds of devotion areimplicit in the text’s theism.The formation of S ́aiva traditions as we understand them begins to occurduring the period from 200 bcto 100 ad. Apart from the S ́veta ̄s ́vatara, we havereferences to a S ́aiva devotee, a S ́iva-bha ̄gavata, in the grammarian Patañjali’scommentary on the Pa ̄n.ini grammar (Pa ̄n., 5.2.76). He describes him as a figureclad in animal skins and carrying an iron lance as a symbol of his god, and thereare references to early S ́aiva ascetics in the Maha ̄bha ̄rata(Bhandarkar 1983:165). There are also suggestions of S ́iva worship on the coins of Greek, S ́aka,and Parthian kings who ruled north India during this period, bearing a bull, a later symbol of S ́iva. While little can be inferred from this, it is probable that adoption of S ́aiva traditions of some form accompanied the general“Indianization” of the foreign, barbarian (mleccha) rulers (Vallee-Poussin 1936:239–41).During the Gupta dynasty (ca. 320–50 ad) the Pura ̄n.as developed along withSma ̄rta brahmin forms of worship (on this see Bühnemann 1988). The S ́aivaPura ̄n.as, most notably the Lin.gaandS ́iva Pura ̄n.a, contain standard material ongenealogy, caste responsibilities, and cosmology, along with specifically S ́aivatopics of installing the symbol (lin.ga) of S ́iva in temples, descriptions of the formsof S ́iva and material on early S ́aiva sects. The follower of the puranic religion,the Mahes ́vara referred to by S ́an.kara (Brahmasu ̄trabha ̄s.a2.2.37), would atdeath, having led a life of devotion and responsible enactment of social duties,be transported to S ́iva’s heaven (s ́iva-loka) at the top of the world egg (brahma ̄n.d.a)and so be liberated. This is the S ́aiva equivalent of the Vais.n.ava heaven vaikun.t.hawhere the puranic Vais.n.ava would go at death. Fully orthoprax, the Mahes ́varaadhered to the Sma ̄rta observance of social duties, the varn.a ̄s ́rama-dharma, per-formed vedic domestic rites and puranic pu ̄ja ̄, making vegetarian offerings toorthodox forms of S ́iva and using vedic mantras. He followed the brahmanicalpath in an ordered universe in which his place in the cosmos at death wasassured, as had been his social position in life (Sanderson forthcoming).the s ́aiva traditions205"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"In contrast to the brahmin householder who followed the puranic, Sma ̄rtainjunctions, a number of other S ́aiva groups are listed in the Pura ̄n.as which areon the edges of orthopraxy and are even condemned by some texts. These S ́aivasects are classified in quite complex ways in the Pura ̄n.as and other medievalsources – there are references in S ́an.kara’s and Ra ̄ma ̄nuja’s commentaries on theBrahma Su ̄traand in Ya ̄muna among others – but four groups in particularemerge as important. These are the Pa ̄s ́upata, La ̄kulis ́a, S ́aiva, and Ka ̄palikasects. There are variant names for some of these and they are also subdivided(Lorenzen 1991: 1–12; Dyczkowski 1988: 16–19). While the Pura ̄n.as mentionthese sects and the later Pura ̄n.as contain material which is derived from thenonvedic revelation of the Tantras, they are often hostile to the nonpuranic S ́aivatraditions, partly in reaction to the tantric tradition’s hostility towards the vedic;theKu ̄rma Pura ̄n.afor instance condemns the Pa ̄s ́upata system as heretical(Ku ̄rma Pura ̄n.a1.14.30; 1.20.69; see Dyczkowski 1988: 10–11). A picturetherefore emerges of a puranic S ́aiva tradition, revering the Vedas, with ortho-prax social attitudes, being confronted by renunicate S ́aiva traditions, at first thePa ̄s ́upata sect who threatened puranic tradition, but later by more extremegroups. These alternative S ́aiva sects ranged from ascetics who regarded them-selves as being within the vedic fold, namely the Pa ̄s ́upatas and Saiddha ̄ntikas,to groups who consciously placed themselves outside of that sphere such as theKa ̄pa ̄likas. It is to these nonpuranic groups that I wish to pay some attention, asit is these groups who have formed the majority S ́aiva traditions and who arestill extant in the subcontinent.Non-Puranic S ́aivismSanderson has shown that we can make a broad distinction between the Vedic,Puranic devotee of S ́iva on the one hand and the nonpuranic S ́aiva initiate onthe other. These latter had undergone an initiation (dı ̄ks.a ̄) into the cults of theiraffiliation for the purpose of liberation in this life (mukti) and/or obtainingmagical power to experience pleasure in higher worlds (bhukti). Within thisgroup a distinction can be made between those S ́aivas who follow the outer orhigher path (atima ̄rga) and those who follow the path of mantras (mantrama ̄rga).The followers of the atima ̄rgasought only liberation, while the followers of themantrama ̄rgasought not only liberation but power and pleasure in higher worlds(Sanderson 1988b: 664–90). Among the groups of the atima ̄rgatwo are par-ticularly important, the Pa ̄s ́upatas and a sub-branch, the La ̄kula, from whomanother important sect, the Ka ̄la ̄mukhas, developed.The Pa ̄s ́upatas are the oldest named S ́aiva group, dating probably fromaround the second century ad. They are referred to in the Maha ̄bha ̄rata(s ́antipar-van349.64), but the earliest surviving text of the group is the Pa ̄s ́upata Su ̄tra,pre-tenth century, with a commentary by Kaun.d.inya. This text was regarded asrevelation by the Pa ̄s ́upatas. The myth behind it is that S ́iva entered the corpse206gavin flood"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"of a young brahmin that had been cast into a cremation ground and reanimatedit as Lakulı ̄s ́a, the “Lord of the staff,” who then gave out the teachings containedin the text to his four disciples.These teachings present the Pa ̄s ́upata as an ascetic somewhat on the edges oforthoprax society, even though such an ascetic had to be a brahmin male whoshould not speak with low castes nor with women (Pa ̄s ́ Su ̄1.13). But whereasan ordinary, vedic brahmin would pursue the social norms of adherence toduties regarding caste and stage of life (varn.a ̄s ́ramadharma), the Pa ̄s ́upata hadtranscended these responsibilities to a higher or perfected (siddha) fifth stagebeyond the vedic fourth stage of renunciation. To achieve this perfection theascetic undertook a vow or observance (vrata)in three developmental stages.Firstly the Pa ̄s ́upata should live within the environs of a S ́aiva temple, bear themark (lin.ga) of a Pa ̄s ́upata ascetic, namely the ashes in which he bathes thricedaily, and worship S ́iva with song, dance, laughter and mantra repetition. Livingon alms, the aspirant (sa ̄dhaka) undertakes the development of virtues such asnot stealing, celibacy, and not harming creatures by straining water, and so on(Pa ̄s ́ Su ̄1.2–11 and commentary). He thereby gradually purifies himself andenters the second stage of his practice in which he discards external signs of hisobservance, leaves the temple, and undertakes various forms of antisocialbehavior. These include pretending to be asleep in public places, making hislimbs tremble as though he were paralyzed, limping, acting as if mad, andmaking lewd gestures to young women (Pa ̄s ́ Su ̄3.12–17). Such practices, thetext claims, are doors to the acquisition of merit, for in behaving in this way theascetic will attract verbal and physical abuse whereby his sin (pa ̄pa) will be passedover to his abusers and their merit (sukr.ta) passed over to him (Pa ̄s ́ Su ̄3.8–9). Inthe third stage of the practice the sa ̄dhaka withdraws from the public eye to adeserted house or cave, lives off alms, and devotes himself to meditation uponthe five sacred mantras of S ́iva along with the syllable om.(Pa ̄s ́ Su ̄5.21–4).Through this he unites his soul with S ́iva and gains uninterrupted union for aperiod of six months (Pa ̄s ́ Su ̄5.9–12). Finally the ascetic withdraws to becomea resident in a cremation ground (s ́mas ́a ̄na-va ̄sı ̄), where he lives on whatever isavailable (Pa ̄s ́ Su ̄5.30–2), and dies reaching union with S ́iva (rudrasa ̄yujya) andthe end of sorrow through his grace (Pa ̄s ́ Su ̄5.33, 40).There were more extreme forms of Pa ̄s ́upata religion. The La ̄kula asceticimitated the terrible form of his god Rudra, carrying a cranium begging bowl, askull-topped staff, a garland of human bones, ash covered, with matted hair orshaved head (Sanderson 1988b: 665–6). This kind of S ́aiva had taken the “greatvow” (maha ̄vrata) or penance for killing a Brahmin in the Dharma S ́a ̄stras,namely living beyond the pale of vedic society and carrying the skull of hisvictim for 12 years (Manu11.73). This practice is reinforced by a myth in whichS ́iva as the terrible Bhairava decapitates Brahma ̄’s fifth head with his left-handthumb, because Brahma ̄ had attempted incest with his daughter. The skull sticksto Bhairava’s hand and he wanders as the beggar Bhiks.a ̄t.ana until he reachesBanaras where the skull falls at Kapa ̄lamocana, a site of pilgrimage (tı ̄rtha) (Eck1984: 119). The La ̄kula sect gave rise to a further subsect, the Ka ̄la ̄mukhas, whothe s ́aiva traditions207"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"were especially dominant in Karnataka during the eleventh to thirteenthcenturies. Indeed they were an important group here, attracting donations andpolitical patronage for Ka ̄la ̄mukha temples and monastic centers (mat.has)(Lorenzen 1991: 97–140). The Ka ̄la ̄mukhas’ in turn probably gave rise to theimportant Lin.gayat or Vı ̄ras ́aiva tradition, still extant in Karn.a ̄t.aka, famous fordevotional poetry (Ramanujan 1973).With these groups of the higher path we have the beginnings of a tendencyaway from orthodox forms of religion and adherence to the vedic social order.Although brahmins within the vedic order, the Pa ̄s ́upatas believed their teach-ings to transcend that order. They went beyond the four stages on life’s way(a ̄s ́rama) into a fifth stage beyond the fourth vedic order, they also saw themselvesas being within that order. Similarly, the Ka ̄la ̄mukhas in seemingly rejecting thevedic world, vividly symbolized by their great vow as a consequence of brah-minicide, were yet at the center of the social order in Karn.a ̄t.aka, supported by kings, with well-funded centers of practice and learning. The relationshipbetween these groups and the established hierarchy is therefore complex andcannot be seen in terms of a simple rejection of vedic values by a heterodox orexcluded community. The issue of the relation of these groups to the widersociety and to vedic orthopraxy becomes even more sharply delineated with thetraditions of the mantrama ̄rga, all of which revered a body of scripture distinctfrom the Veda, known as the Tantras.The TantrasThe Tantras are a vast body of literature in Sanskrit, composed mostly betweenthe eighth and eleventh centuries ad, claiming to have the status of revelationand claiming to supercede the Vedas. Some Tantras acknowledged the Vedaswhile others rejected them. The Tantras were composed in a number of tradi-tions where they are sometimes known by the name of A ̄gama in the S ́aivaSiddha ̄nta and Sam.hita ̄ in the Vais.n.ava tantric tradition or Pa ̄ñcara ̄tra. There arealso a very few Jain Tantras, a vast body of Buddhist Tantras, mostly preservedin Tibetan and Chinese translations, and Tantras to the Sun, none of which havesurvived (Sanderson 1988b: 660–1). As the Buddhist Tantras were translatedinto Tibetan, so some of the S ́aiva Tantras were translated into Tamil and areused as the basis for temple rituals in south India to this day. All of the S ́aivatraditions of the mantrama ̄rgaaccept the Tantras, or rather different groups ofTantras, as their textual basis, although some S ́aiva traditions have been moreclosely aligned to orthoprax, brahminical practice than others.While there are specific traditions and the language of the Tantras is oftenobscure, partly because these texts would have been accompanied by a living,oral tradition, and partly because they regarded themselves as secret and heavilysymbolic, they nevertheless share common features. They are concerned withpractice (sa ̄dhana) involving ritual and yoga undertaken after initiation (dı ̄ks.a ̄) by208gavin flood"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"a guru, but also contain sections on temple building, architecture, and occa-sional rites such as funerals. Indeed, each Tantra of the S ́aiva Siddha ̄nta theo-retically rests on the four “feet” (pa ̄da) of doctrine (the vidya ̄orjña ̄na pa ̄das), yoga,ritual (kriya ̄-pa ̄da), and behavior (ca ̄rya-pa ̄da), although most texts do not followthis rather artificial scheme. The majority of the tantric corpus is concerned withritual of some kind and the texts follow a common ritual structure, as we shallsee, for the purposes of attaining liberation and above all, magical power andpleasure in higher worlds. These rituals involve the enacting of elaboratehierarchical cosmologies, are concerned with the divinization of the body, withdivine energy or power (s ́akti), and with possession (a ̄ves ́a) and exorcism.We do not yet have a full picture of the groups of ascetics and the socialcontext in which the Tantras originated, although Sanderson’s work on manu-script sources will clarify the picture (Sanderson 1985, 1988, forthcoming).Any statements are therefore preliminary and must remain conjectural and pro-visional until the publication of Sanderson’s more recent work. The Tantrasprobably originated with groups of ascetics similar to the La ̄kula Pa ̄s ́upatas, onthe edges of brahminical society who were supported by low castes, althoughthe low-caste origins of Tantra is contentious as the Tantras are linked to courtlycircles and royal power (Sanderson, forthcoming). Cremation ground asceticismis a very old tradition in the subcontinent and meditation on death is an import-ant feature in the meditation practice of early Buddhist monks (e.g. Norman1973: 123). The Tantras became more popular and tantric images and ideasbecame pervasive in later Hindu traditions. Although generally distancing them-selves from the Tantras, the Pura ̄n.as nevertheless absorb tantric elements (Hazra1983; Dyczkowski 1988: 8) and tantric ideas and practices become absorbed bythe eleventh century into mainstream, brahminical society and courtly circles.The divine power (s ́akti) of the Goddess becomes identified with the power of theKing in different regions such as Vijayanagara. But it is in Kashmir, above all,where we see this process of the brahmanization of tantric ideology and prac-tice. This history has been traced by Sanderson through the sequences of textsand the divisions of the S ́aiva tantric canon. It is to this canon and the traditionsit expresses that we now turn.The path of Mantras can be divided into the texts and teachings of the S ́aivaSiddha ̄nta on the one hand and the teachings of Bhairava of non-Siddha ̄ntagroups on the other. While the former, although accepting 28 “dualist” Tantras,adhered to vedic social practice and made generally vegetarian offerings to amilder form of S ́iva known as Sada ̄s ́iva, the latter accepted a large body of textswhich were often hostile to vedic orthopraxy. This distinction between orthopraxand heteroprax S ́aivism is identified in the sources, as Sanderson has shown, asa distinction between traditions of the right (daks.ina), namely the S ́aivaSiddha ̄nta, and traditions of the left (va ̄ma), namely the non-Saiddha ̄ntika tra-ditions (Sanderson 1995: p.18). While the S ́aiva Siddha ̄nta is a dualistictradition, maintaining a distinction between the soul and the Lord, the non-Saiddha ̄ntika groups, especially the tradition known as the Trika, are nondual-istic, claiming that the self and S ́iva are identical.

Here kings modeled themselves onsouth Asian kings, Sanskrit became the sacred language, and Brahmin priestsofficiated at rites of royal consecration. In Java, for example, there are early S ́aivainscriptions (732 ce) and eighth-century S ́aiva temples seemed to have followedritual patterns found in the subcontinent of bathing the S ́iva lin.ga (Dumarçay1986). In Bali S ́aiva temple priests still perform daily rites in which the priestsymbolically becomes S ́iva through uttering the five-syllabled mantra “homageto S ́iva” (namah.s ́iva ̄ya) (Goudriaan and Hookyas 1971). There are importanttantric Buddhist texts of Indonesia, such as the Kuñjarakarn.adharmakathana,depicting S ́aiva elements but in a Buddhist context (Nihom 1994: 119–41).The S ́aiva Siddha ̄ntaThe S ́aiva Siddha ̄nta forms the fundamental S ́aiva system, providing the tem-plate for ritual and theology of all other S ́aiva groups within the Path ofMantras. The tradition may have originated in Kashmir where it developed asophisticated theology propagated by theologians such as Sadyojoti, Bhat.t.aNa ̄ra ̄yanakan.t.ha and his son Bhat.t.a Ra ̄makan.t.ha (ca. 950–1000 ad). It spreadto the South where the Sanskrit scriptures are complemented with Tamil texts.Here the gnostic, ritual system becomes infused with an emotional devotional-ism (bhakti) characteristic of southern S ́aiva Siddha ̄nta, through the Tamilpoetry of the S ́aiva saints or Na ̄yan ̄a ̄rs. Ritual and devotion are accompaniedhere by theology in works by Bhojadeva (eleventh century) and Aghoras ́iva(twelfth century) (Gengnagel 1996).The S ́aiva Siddha ̄nta is dualistic (dvaita), maintaining a distinction betweenthe self and S ́iva and claiming that there are three distinct ontological categories,the Lord (Pati), the self (pas ́u), and the bond (pa ̄s ́a). The Lord or S ́iva in his formas five-faced Sada ̄s ́iva, performs the five acts (pañcakr.tya) of the creation, main-tenance, and destruction of the universe, concealing himself and revealinghimself to devotees (Tat Prak 1.7). The self or “beast” (pas ́u) is eternally distinctfrom S ́iva and bound within the cosmos or “bond” (pa ̄s ́a), in the cycle of birthand death by impurity (mala), action (karma), and the material substratum ofthe cosmos (ma ̄ya ̄). S ́iva performs the five acts for his play (krı ̄d.a ̄) and for theliberation of beings (Tat Prak 6.1). This liberation is attained with the grace(anugraha) of S ́iva through initiation (dı ̄ks.a ̄) by a teacher in whose body S ́iva has become established (a ̄ca ̄ryamu ̄rtistha) (Tat Prak 1.15; Hulin 1980: 115–17).Through initiation and the subsequent actions of daily an occasional rituals per-210gavin flood"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"formed throughout his life, the impurity, which is a substance (dravya) coveringthe soul, is gradually removed and the aspirant finally achieves liberation a deaththrough the descent of S ́iva’s grace (s ́aktipa ̄ta). Once liberated, the soul does notmerge with S ́iva, because of their ontological distinction, but rather becomesequal to S ́iva (s ́ivatulya), possessing all of S ́iva’s powers of omniscience andomnipotence, but remaining eternally distinct (Sanderson 1995: 39–40; Davis1991: 83–111).There were two initiations which the S ́aiva Siddha ̄ntin would undergo, thelesser initiation into the cult ritual and scriptures (samaya-dı ̄ks.a ̄) and the liberat-ing initiation (nirva ̄n.a-dı ̄ks.a ̄) ensuring the soul’s final release (Brunner 1975:411–43). While initiation was open to all classes, it was not open to women whocould only participate in S ́aiva worship vicariously through the actions of theirhusbands and so at death rise up to S ́iva’s abode (Sanderson 1995: 35–6). Thedaily ritual acts of the S ́aiddha ̄ntika were performed at the junctures of the day(dawn, midday, sunset) and involved the standard tantric ritual structure of thepurification of the body through its symbolic destruction (bhu ̄tas ́uddhi), thecreation of a divine body through imposing mantras upon it (nya ̄sa), mental orinner worship (antaraya ̄ga) in which offerings are made mentally to the deity, inthis case Sada ̄s ́iva, and external worship in which external pu ̄ja ̄is performed. Inthe S ́aiva Siddha ̄nta, the form of Sada ̄s ́iva worshipped is consortless, possessing5 faces with 3 eyes, 10 arms, holding a trident, and covered in a tiger skin (Ne T 9. 19c–25), and in the I ̄s ́a ̄nas ́ivagurudeva-paddhatiis represented as a beautifulsixteen year old youth (ISG 3. 14. 5d), although there is some variation in theobjects held in his ten hands (ISG 3. 1–11). This ritual structure is standard, foundin both primary scriptures and in ritual manuals such as I ̄s ́a ̄nas ́ivagurudeva’s and Somas ́ambhu’s paddhatis(twelfth century) (SSP 1963, 1968, 1977, 1998;ISG 1988). The ritual structure in these texts is also found outside the Siddha ̄nta,showing that some degree of ritual invariance occurs across the tantric traditionsin spite of divergent theologies and deities (Sanderson 1988b: 660–704; Padoux1990: 330–8; Brunner 1975: xxi–xxii; Flood 2002).But while the ritual of the S ́aiva Siddha ̄ntin is very closely aligned with thenormative, vedic rites of the Sma ̄rta brahmins (Sanderson 1995: 27–38) andthe Saiddha ̄ntika followed a straightforward path of fulfilling dharmaalong withperforming ritual enjoined by his initiation, there was another path that couldbe followed. This was the path of power and the enjoyment of pleasure in higherworlds that required a distinct consecration (sa ̄dhaka ̄bhis.eka) after the nirva ̄n.a-dı ̄ks.a ̄(Brunner 1975). In contrast to one who simply desired liberation at death(mumuks.u), one desiring powers (bubhuks.u), technically referred to as a sa ̄dhaka,could take on supererogatory rituals. While this distinction between themumuks.uand the bubhuks.udoes not directly map on to the distinction betweenthe S ́aiva Siddha ̄nta followers of the right and the non-Saiddha ̄ntika groups ofthe left, because the sa ̄dhakapath was an option also within the Siddha ̄nta, it isnevertheless the case that the non-Saiddha ̄ntika traditions are more concernedwith attaining power in this sense. Indeed, the obtaining of various forms ofmagical power through the practice of yoga and the performance of rituals forthe s ́aiva traditions211"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"a desired end (ka ̄mya) are integral to the Tantras. The Svacchanda Tantra, forexample, describes rituals for the Sa ̄dhaka to attain the goals of causing thedeath of enemies (maran.a), ruining his enemies (ucca ̄t.ana), the subjugation ofwomen (vas ́ikaran.a), the power of attraction (a ̄kas.an.a), and the tranquilising of supernatural forces (s ́a ̄nti) (Sva TUd 9. 46. On these powers see Goudriaan1978: 251–412) through the worship of a particular ferocious form of the godSvacchanda called Kot.ara ̄ks.a or Aghorahr.daya (Sva TUd 9. 2). For example, thedestruction of enemies and subjugation of a desired woman are achievedthrough establishing their names in a magical diagram (yantra), visualizing theenemy or desired person, and repeating certain mantras (Sva T 9. 65c-70). Thesekind of rites are an important part of the Tantras of the left often associated withthe cremation ground traditions.Non-Saiddha ̄ntika S ́aivismIn contrast to the orthoprax S ́aiva Siddha ̄nta, the second major division of thepath of Mantras comprises the Bhairava Tantras and their various subdivisions.These texts are concerned with the S ́aivas who worshipped a ferocious form of S ́iva called Bhairava and which originated in ascetics groups living in crema-tion grounds. These groups are generally known as Ka ̄pa ̄likas, the “skull-men,”so called because, like the La ̄kula Pa ̄s ́upata, they carried a skull-topped staff(khat.va ̄n.ga) and cranium begging bowl. Unlike the respectable brahmin house-holder of the S ́aiva Siddha ̄nta or Sma ̄rta tradition, the Ka ̄pa ̄lika ascetic imitatedhis ferocious deity, covered himself in the ashes from the cremation ground, andpropitiated his gods with the impure substances of blood, meat, alcohol, andsexual fluids from intercourse unconstrained by caste restrictions (Sanderson1985: 200–2). He thereby flaunted impurity rules and went against vedicinjunctions. His aim was power through evoking deities in the rites associatedwith his particular system, especially ferocious goddesses. In Hindu drama theKa ̄pa ̄lika was often lampooned, but his continued existence, although in smallnumbers, into the present in the form of the Aghorı ̄ ascetics of Banaras, bearswitness to the power of this tradition (Parry 1994: 251–710).Within this broad purview of Ka ̄pa ̄lika S ́aivism or the S ́aivism of the left, anumber of distinct traditions developed during the early medieval period, espe-cially the Kaula, Krama, and Trika traditions, which form part of the Kulaensemble. These originated in cremation ground asceticism but became incor-porated into householder life. As Sanderson has clearly demonstrated, while forthe Krama and Kaula there was no conformity to vedic ritual purity, for the Trikathere was some conformity for the householder, although transcendence ofvedic orthopraxy remained at the tradition’s esoteric heart where transcendenceis achieved through transgression (Sanderson 1995: 21–3). But in order tounderstand the distance of these S ́aiva groups from the Siddha ̄nta let us look atthe Krama tradition first.212gavin flood"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"The Krama or “gradation” tradition existed in Kashmir where it is knownabout through the works of the author Abhinavgupta (ca. 975–1025 ad) andthe anonymous Maha ̄nayapraka ̄s ́a(The Illumination of the Great Way) which canbe dated between the late tenth and thirteenth centuries. In contrast to the S ́aivaSiddha ̄nta in which Sada ̄s ́iva is worshipped without a consort, in the Kramasystem the Goddess is worshipped without a male consort as a form of Ka ̄lı ̄(Ka ̄lasam.kars.in.ı ̄), surrounded by a retinue of 12 identical forms (Sanderson1988: 197–8). Within the Krama system these forms are identified with ema-nations of pure consciousness and Abhinavagupta describes the process ofthe projection of pure consciousness into apparent manifestation as objects of knowledge and its contraction back into itself. The expansion (vika ̄sa) of thecosmos in manifestation is the contraction (sam.koca) of consciousness, whileconversely the contraction of manifestation becomes the expansion of con-sciousness (TS 29–30; see also Silburn 1975: 134–90, 193–4). The explanationof existence is to be found in these goddesses who are the impulse (udyoga) forexperience, its manifestation (avabha ̄sana), the tasting of it (carvan.a), and finallyits destruction (vila ̄pana) (Sp Nir p. 6). In consonance with this idealism, theKrama denied the vedic distinction between purity and impurity in its rituals.Closely associated with the Krama are the Trika and Kaula traditions whichmerge at the higher levels of their initiatory hierarchy. The Trika is a particu-larly important form of S ́aivism which came to dominate Kashmir, and is gen-erally understood as “Kashmir” S ́aivism. This form of S ́aivism was absorbed intothe householder life in Kashmir and developed a sophisticated theology thatbecame known as the recognition school (pratyabhijña ̄). It was strongly influen-tial on the S ́aivism of the south and on the Goddess tradition of the S ́rı ̄ Vidya ̄.The root text of the tradition is the Ma ̄linı ̄vijayottara Tantra, around which textAbhinavagupta centered his monumental exposition, the Tantra ̄loka(“Lighton Tantra”), and two other works, the Tantrasa ̄ra(“Essence of Tantra”) and hiscommentary on the text (Mal Vart, Hanneder 1998). Abhinavagupta claimedthat the text is the essence of the nondualist Tantras, although Sanderson hasargued that the text itself is in fact dualistic in its orientation (Sanderson 1993:291–306). Sanderson observes that Abhinavagupta’s basing his teaching onthis text shows his desire to ground his idealism in a text that had wide circula-tion and appeal (Sanderson 1995: 22). This idealism comprised the central claimthat all manifestation, including the self, is identical with the pure conscious-ness (sam.vit, caitanya) of S ́iva and to therefore qualify the Saiddha ̄ntika distinc-tion between Lord, self and bond. Liberation is not becoming equal to S ́iva, asthe Siddha ̄nta believed, but rather the realization of the nondistinction betweenself and S ́iva or Ka ̄lı ̄ as absolute consciousness.To show that this realization is the overall goal of practice (sa ̄dhana), Abhi-navagupta adopted the Trika pantheon of three goddesses, Para ̄, Para ̄para ̄, andApara ̄, from where the tradition derives its name, showing that they are all mani-festations of consciousness. Consciousness is at the esoteric heart of the Trikawhich Abhinavagupta identified with the Krama Goddess Ka ̄lasam.kars.inı ̄, andthis rejection of dualism at a theological level is reflected in the rejection of thethe s ́aiva traditions213"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"dualism of purity and impurity at a ritual level. Abhinavagupta distinguishedbetween two ritual systems, the normative rite of the Trika householder (thetantra-prakriya ̄) and the optional esoteric rites which flaunted vedic purity rules(thekula-prakriya ̄). The former was enjoined on the Trika initiate and involvedthe worship and internalization of a ritual diagram in the form of a trident(tris ́u ̄la ̄bja-man.d.ala) whose prongs were identified with the three goddesses stem-ming from pure consciousness of the fourth goddess Ka ̄lasam.kars.inı ̄ (Sanderson1988). This normative Trika rite followed the pattern of Saiddha ̄ntika dailyworship. But for the suitable person (adhika ̄rin) the supererogatory rite of thekula-prakriya ̄was possible in order to achieve gradual perfection (siddhikrama)which would otherwise take thousands of years with floods of mantras (TA29.1–3). This rite involved making offerings of meat, wine and sex (TA29.97–8), ritually anathema to the orthoprax brahmin, with a partner or “mes-senger” (du ̄tı ̄) who was regarded as the sa ̄dhaka’s “door” (dva ̄ra) to realizing thewonder (camatka ̄ra) of pure consciousness (TA 29.115b–117; Silburn 1988:219; Flood 2002: 281–301). The sa ̄dhaka and his ritual partner thereby reca-pitulated the union (ya ̄mala) of S ́iva and his female power or S ́akti and the plea-sure of their union reflected the universal joy (jagada ̄nanda) of liberation. Thedeities in these esoteric levels of the Trika and Krama demanded to be appeasedby impure substances, such as offerings which included drops of the five sub-stances, urine, semen, menstrual blood, faeces, and phlegm, along with othersubstances polluting to the brahmin such as garlic and onions (Sanderson 1995:82). The Trika goddesses were so powerful that they must be placated with offer-ings of blood and alcohol, only after which could ordinary offerings of flowersand incense be made (TA 26.51c–53b from Sanderson 1995: 81). The secretKula rites were available only to the Trika initiate who would also maintainoutward, vedic responsibilities. Thus Abhinavagupta could say that the Trika ini-tiate should be internally a Kaula (i.e. a practitioner of the secret rite), externallya S ́aiva and vedic in his social practice (TAV 3: 27, 277–8 from Sanderson 1985:205).The Trika was very successful in Kashmir and its theologians succeeded inmaking their interpretation of the scriptures predominant. With Moslem inva-sion in the eleventh century the tradition became greatly eroded, but there is stilla S ́aiva householder tradition in Kashmir (Madan 1987) and until recently aliving representative of the Recognition school in Swami Lakshman Joo. Butwhile the Trika and Krama schools were important within ascetic and intellec-tual circles, the majority of S ́aivas followed less demanding forms of religion inthe popular cults of S ́iva.Popular S ́aivismAlongside the Trika was the popular worship of S ́iva in the Kashmir valley asSvacchandabhairava. His cult, expressed in the Svacchandabhairava Tantra, has214gavin flood"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"continued to the present, and is closely connected with the cult of the Lord ofthe eye (Netrana ̄tha) found in the Netra Tantra. Both of these texts show con-cerns with special rites of protection, exorcism and rites for a desired goal(ka ̄mya) such as the destruction of enemies or seduction of a desired person.While both the Netra and Svacchanda cults conformed to the ritual purity of theS ́aiva Siddha ̄nta, the latter contained the worship of impure forms of the deity.The majority of all S ́aivas were probably followers of these cults rather than the more esoteric and demanding Trika and Krama (Sanderson 1995: 22–3).Although popular, these texts present quite complex systems of visualization(Brunner 1974) and their deities as emanations of Netrana ̄tha tend to be fero-cious, a characteristic of the Ka ̄pa ̄lika cults. The Netra Tantra, although the textitself has connections with royalty, also bears witness to popular possession andexorcism rites which were probably pervasive among lower social levels. Indeed,one of the main tasks of the orthoprax brahmin was to prevent possession. These“demons” (bhu ̄ta) and powerful female deities or “mothers” (ma ̄tr.) enter throughthe “hole” (chidra) of the shadow of impure men and women whose behaviouris bad (dura ̄ca ̄ra), and who have neglected their ritual obligations, so causing theevil eye (dr.s.t.ipa ̄ta) to fall upon them (NT 19. 34, 45–6).The classification of possessing beings in the sources is a fascinating ex-ample of the way in which cosmological taxonomies link in to S ́aiva cosmolog-ical structures. The Netra Tantraand the Kashmiri S ́aiva theologian Ks.emara ̄ja’scommentary list several classes of being who possess and who must be ap-peased through different ritual offerings. These beings include a class of femaledeities called “mothers” (ma ̄tr.), the “removers” (vina ̄yakas), “demon-grabbers”(bhu ̄tagraha), and others (NT 19. 55–80 and commentary), who are classified ina broader scheme depending upon their motives for possession. Thus there arethose desirous of meat offerings (balika ̄ma), those desirous of sexual pleasure(bhoktuka ̄ma) and those desiring to harm and kill (hantuka ̄ma) (N TUd 168).These malevolent powers are within the cosmic hierarchy assumed by the S ́aivasystems. They exist within a family (kula) of powers with a deity at the head andare indeed, particles or fragments (am.s ́a) of that higher being. Through appeas-ing the Lord of the family of the possessor, the possessor leaves the possessedperson (NT 19.80b–81a). For example, if possessed by the Vina ̄yakas, one wor-ships their Lord Vighnes ́a (i.e. Gan.es ́a), offering him sweetmeat, meat, and plentyof alcohol (NT 19. 63–5). Or if possessed by the innumerable mothers (ma ̄tr.)who desire to do harm, then one should perform worship (prapu ̄jayet) for thegreat mothers (maha ̄ma ̄tr.), namely the famous seven or eight goddesses Brahmı ̄,Mahes ́varı ̄ and so on, from whose wombs they have originated (NT 19. 55–6).The lower beings in the hierarchy are emanations or particles of the higher. Oncethe higher being is appeased with offerings of flowers, rice, and the four kinds of meat from domestic and wild, aquatic and flying animals (N TUd 9. 59–61a,p. 166), then also are the lower manifestations.While the Netra Tantrais from the north, similar concerns are shown in the S ́aiva Siddha ̄nta ritual treatise, probably composed in Kerala, theI ̄ss ́a ̄nas ́ivagurudeva-paddhati. This is the only Saiddha ̄ntika text that I am aware ofthe s ́aiva traditions215"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"that deals with possession and exorcism and contains a typology of supernat-ural beings, although the Kerala medical text the Tantrasa ̄rasam.grahaknows thesame typology (TSS 12. 9–11). The text has eighteen types (ISG 2. 42.1) ofpowers who can possess, although the typology is different from that of thenorthern text. I ̄s ́a ̄nas ́ivagurudeva does classify them broadly into those desiringsexual pleasure (ratika ̄ma) and those wanting to kill (hantuka ̄ma). These beingsare everywhere, in rivers, gardens, mountains, lakes, empty places, cremationgrounds and in temples (ISG 2. 42. 3b–4). The text goes on the describe the kindsof people these beings attack, usually people on the social margins or in vul-nerable situations; for example, children, those alone in the night, those whosewealth has been lost, those wishing to die, and those separated from their lovedones. But especially vulnerable are women when naked, who have bathed aftermenstruation, who are filled with passion, intoxicated, pregnant, or prostitutes(ISG 2. 42. 5b–8). That is, possession happens to those who are or are poten-tially outside of social control, as women’s sexuality was perceived to be by themale oriented S ́aiva Brahmanism. Indeed, women’s sexuality was a threat tobrahmanical order because, according to the Pa ̄s ́upata Su ̄tra, it is beyond thecontrol of the scriptures (Pa ̄s ́ Su ̄ 9, comm. p. 66). The I ̄ss ́a ̄nas ́ivagurudeva-paddhatialso makes clear that possession is caste-related. Thus there are demons whospecifically possess Brahmins (brahmara ̄ks.asa), warriors (ks.atriyagraha), and soon (ISG 2. 42.26–9), and one of the symptoms of possession is somebody fromone caste taking on the roles or pretending to perform the duties of another.There are specific cures or rituals to enact a cure, prescribed in the text. Forexample, the exorcist should nail the tuft of the possessed person to a tree andthebhu ̄tawill then go (ISG 2. 43. 3) or he should make an ersatz body of the pos-sessor and pierce it with sharp sticks (ISG 2. 43. 11–12), and so on. All of theserites involve the use of mantras, ritual diagrams, and offerings, such as thesubstitute blood (raktatoya) so common in Kerala rites (ISG. 2. 43. 28–30). Theconstruction and use of mantras is a striking feature of this tradition and forexorcising especially powerful beings, the text gives distorted or garbled mantras(ISG 2. 43. 83). In dealing with local, possessing deities, the text also therebyexpress the concerns of those in lower social strata. Not only do the textsarticulate the dominant ideology, they also express divergent voices which canbe heard in the places dealing with possession and which can be read in termsof social protest (Lewis 1971).The S ́aiva cults of possession and exorcism are an important aspect of thetradition which show links between religion, healing and social comment. Pos-session is linked to the diagnosis of disease and the prescription of mantras; themantrava ̄dain Kerala, for example, is related to the Ayurveda. Indeed, it is theseaspects of tradition which, while being local in origin, have traveled to otherareas. The S ́aiva exorcist deity Khad.gara ̄van.a, for example, in the text of theKuma ̄ra Tantra, while originating in the north, became popular in Tibet andsoutheast Asia (Filliozat 1937). Where these topics are dealt with we move awayfrom the ordered world of temple and domestic ritual, into a world of the lowerlevels of the supernatural order and so of lower levels of the social order. But216gavin flood"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"although the I ̄ss ́a ̄nas ́ivagurudeva-paddhatiis concerned with possession andexorcism, most of the text is devoted to the more usual concerns of the S ́aivaSiddha ̄nta, its temple ritual and deities.The Southern S ́aiva Siddha ̄ntaBy the eleventh century S ́aiva Siddha ̄nta had faded in Kashmir but developed inTamilnadu, where it exists to the present time. Here in the south the dualist tra-dition merged with the Tamil devotionalism of the 63 S ́aiva saints, the Na ̄yan ̄ars.S ́aivism took on a distinctive flavor and the Sanskritic ritualism and theology of the northern tradition combined with Tamil poetry and devotion to produce a distinctively southern S ́aiva religious imaginaire. This devotional poetry is still sung in temples throughout South India. It was in the south that S ́aivismhad royal patronage in the Co ̄l ̄a dynasty (ca. 870–1280 ad), with the great S ́aiva temples at Cidamabaram, Tanjvur, Darasuram, and Gangaikondacolapu-ram thriving, and the famous Co ̄l ̄a bronzes developed. At Cidamabram, forexample, wealthy donors’ inscriptions made in the temple walls show how thetemple supported and legitimized royal power in the region (Younger 1995:125–58). This power was not centralized as in a modern state, but pervadedthrough a segmented hierarchy, whose basic unit was the locality or na ̄t.u(Stein1980). But even here where S ́aivism became aligned with an ideology of royalpower and the king was thought to embody the power (s ́akti) of the Lord, S ́aivismnot only upheld vedic norms, but simultaneously undermined them in a devo-tionalism where the devotee transcends his birth to fall in love with his Lord. It is these two aspects of S ́aiva Siddha ̄nta in the south that I wish to brieflyexamine.Tamilnadu developed an extensive temple culture in which large, regionaltemples became not only places of worship, but centers of political power andalso great centers of learning. In Tamilnadu a distinctive sense of the sacrednessof place and temple buildings develops (Shulman 1980). Perhaps this is nowhereseen more vividly than in the temple city of Cidambaram, the “sky of con-sciousness,” where S ́iva is installed, not as in all other S ́iva temples in the ani-conic form of the lin.ga, but as the dancing S ́iva (Nat.ara ̄ja). Here he is installedalong with a bronze icon of his consort S ́ivaka ̄masundarı ̄, and in contrast tofixed icons, is paraded on festival occasions (Smith 1996: 10). Like other S ́aivatemples, Cidambaram had a group of texts associated with it, extolling its virtuesand narrating its mythology, namely the twelfth-century Cidambara Maha ̄tmyaalong with four sthalapura ̄n.as, a Tamil translation of the former text and Uma ̄patiS ́iva ̄ca ̄rya’s hymn of praise to Nat.ara ̄ja (Smith 1996: 8–9). Through these textsand the popular imagination, Cidambaram became incorporated into the sacredgeography of Tamilnadu.Although the S ́aiva Siddha ̄nta has been the predominant form of theologyand ritual in southern S ́aivism, and Cidambaram was an important center the s ́aiva traditions217"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"for this theology, the temple and its rites are not sectarian in a strict sense.Indeed, the community of Brahmins who perform six daily rituals to Nat.ara ̄jaclaim that they follow vedic practice rather than tantric or a ̄gamic. They therebydifferentiate themselves from the hereditary priests at other S ́aiva Siddha ̄ntatemples, the arccakan.s, who follow the tantric or a ̄gamaic rites of the texts wehave discussed. The Dı ̄ks.itas (Tamil Dı ̄t.citars), as they are called, are an endog-amous community, who perform rites accompanied by Sma ̄rta Brahmins orAiyars who are qualified to perform recitation of the Vedas (Younger 1995:133–24). These rites are quite elaborate and involve the performance ofpu ̄ja ̄toa crystal lin.gatransported out from the inner sanctum of the bronze Nat.ara ̄ja toan outer porch where ablutions are made over it (abhis.eka). It is then returnedto the inner shrine and pu ̄ja ̄to the icon of Nat.ara ̄ja himself is performed, involv-ing the offering of lights (dı ̄pa), sound, and, at certain times of the day, food(naivedya). During one of the evening pu ̄ja ̄slow caste singers, the O ̄tuva ̄rs, sing Tamil devotional hymns before the icon, as they do elsewhere throughoutTamilnadu.While Tamil S ́aivism is strongly associated with royal power and the uphold-ing of orthoprax values, as we can see at Cidambaram, it simultaneously under-mines those values through its emphasis on popular devotion. We can see thisin the context when a caste of singers, the O ̄tuva ̄rs, sing hymns to the icon ofS ́iva and during the great festival when the icons of Na ̄t.ara ̄ja and his consort areparaded through the streets by Ve ̄l.a ̄l.as, outside of brahmanical control (Younger1995: 60–3). In one sense festival transgression of formal boundaries can serveto reinforce those boundaries but in another sense the carnival disrupts hierar-chy and in it we can hear voices otherwise occluded. Indeed, it is these othervoices that are articulated in much of the devotional poetry of the Na ̄yan ̄ars,which partly developed against the oppression of the lower castes in the feudal-ism of the southern kingdoms.The Na ̄yan ̄ars were often low caste themselves, composing love songs to S ́ivain his icons at different temples. In the love or bhaktipresented in these Tamilsources what is important is the direct, unmediated relationship between thedevotee and the Lord in which the devotee can become mad (piccu, un ̄matta) withdevotion. The texts of the Na ̄yan ̄ars are incorporated into the canon of thesouthern S ́aiva Siddha ̄nta, the Tirumurai, which also contains S ́aiva Siddha ̄ntaS ́a ̄stras in Tamil (Zvelebil 1975; Peterson 1991: 52–9). Among the Na ̄yan ̄arsrepresented, the most famous is Ma ̄n.ikkava ̄cakar dated by tradition to the fifthcentury, who composed the “sacred verses” (Tiruva ̄cakam) and whose 20-versehymn, the Tiruvempa ̄vai, is still recited in temples today. Ma ̄n.ikkava ̄cakar is themost revered saint of Tamil S ́aivism. He was a court official in Madurai butretired to a life of meditation at Cidamabaram where, tradition maintains, heentered the inner sanctum never to return and merged with his god (Younger1995: 194–201). Other texts are also recited by the O ̄tuva ̄rs, particularly thelater Te ̄va ̄ram(Peterson 1991). The following is an example from the Na ̄yan ̄arAppar, who expresses a devotional sentiment specific to place, to the particulartemple in which S ́iva dwells:218gavin flood"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"When I think of the skullbearerwho wears a wreath of flowers in his hair,the Lord with the white moon who likes to livein Ven.n.is ancient city,a flood of ambrosiawells up in my tongue.(Peterson 1991: 210)This kind of devotionalism, so typical of the bhaktimovement, spread fromTamilnadu to neighbouring Karnataka where the Lin.gayat or Vı ̄ras ́aiva sectwere founded by Basava (ca. 1106–67 ad), although there was some continu-ity with the Ka ̄la ̄mukha sect (see above). As in Tamilnadu this form of S ́aivismis highly devotional and the bhaktimovement instigated by Basava was againstasceticism (as would have been practiced by the Ka ̄la ̄mukhas), against caste, andagainst formal, temple worship, preferring instead an immediate relationshipbetween devotee and Lord symbolised by a small lin.gaworn around the neck. Asin Tamilnadu, beautiful devotional poetry was composed in Kanada to S ́iva andhis forms (Ramanujan 1973). The fusion ofbhaktiwith tantric ritual as occurredin the Tamil S ́aiva Siddha ̄nta and Lin.gayats of Karnataka has provided a richmix that gave expression to both a popular religiosity and to formal, brahmani-cal, tantric ritual. There is a fusion of the two in that the personal religion ofbhaktibecomes formalized and incorporated into temple ritual structure.S ́aiva Siddha ̄nta temple ritual found its way into Kerala where the NambudriBrahmins, akin to the Tamil accakan.s, developed a distinctive form of templeTantrism based on a fifteenth century Tantrasumuccaya(“Compendium ofTantra”) by Cenasnambudri, although some families use the I ̄s ́a ̄nas ́ivagurudeva-paddhati(Freeman 1997). This tradition is not strictly S ́aiva, but rather a syn-thesis of traditions focusing on the temple worship of S ́iva, Vis.n.u, Gan.es ́a, Devı ̄,and low-caste regional goddesses.In the S ́aiva Siddha ̄nta of the south and in the related Kerala Tantrism, wesee traditions which formally align themselves with adherence to vedic worshipand social mores (varn.a ̄s ́rama-dharma) but which in practice perform worshipaccording to the Tantras. The southern tradition absorbed lower-caste devotionand succeeded in all but eradicating the ascetical traditions of Buddhism andJainism from the region and successfully aligned the tantric tradition with thevedic. This alignment is achieved in ritual where the S ́aiva Siddha ̄nta and Keralatraditions absorb vedic elements into the tantric ritual structure that then formsa common pattern in both temple and private cults. Having taken this survey ofS ́aiva history so far, it is to the patterns of S ́aiva practice that we must now turn.S ́aiva Temple RitualWhile personal yoga and private ritual for both liberation and power must notbe forgotten in S ́aiva traditions, it is the ritual life of the temple that provides itsthe s ́aiva traditions219"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"wider social coherence. The S ́aiva Siddha ̄nta is the basic ritual and theologicalstructure to which the other tantric traditions respond and build. Many of theS ́aiva Siddha ̄nta Tantras and manuals are concerned with temple ritual, such as the Rauravottara ̄gama, while others, such as the Mr.gendra, are not concernedwith temples but rather with personal practice under the direction of a teacher.TheRauravottaradescribes various styles of temple, the rites for the installationof the temple, and for the installation of deities within it (pratis.t.ha ̄). The deitiesof the directions (din.mu ̄rti) are first established and then others may be installedin the vicinity of the central shrine, namely the gods Gan.es ́a, Daks.in.a ̄mu ̄rti,Vis.n.u, Brahma ̄, and Durga ̄. Finally the lin.gais installed as the central icon of S ́iva.Thelin.gais regarded as the highest, undifferentiated (nis.kala) form of S ́iva incontrast to the anthropomorphic form which is differentiated (sakala). The lin.gawith a face or faces is a mixture of both (sakalanis.kala) (Davis 1991: 121–2).There are different kinds oflin.gafor different kinds of temple, and an elaboratetypology is offered in the Rauravottara(Rau A ch. 15). Abhinavagupta offers anesoteric interpretation of the lin.gaas being unmanifest where it is equated withabsolute consciousness or the “supreme heart of tranquility” (vis ́ra ̄ntihr.dayamparam), manifest-unmanifest (vyakta ̄vyakta) when identified with the body, andmanifest (vyakta) as an outer symbol (TA 5 117a). It is with the outer symboland its worship that the S ́aiva Siddha ̄na is mainly concerned. Having made theicon of wood, metal or stone, the eyes are opened and the icon is purified by beingimmersed in water, the altar (vedika ̄) constructed, firepits (kun.d.a) placed aroundit, the deity invoked in the icon, the icon bathed (abhis ́eka), priests honored and brahmins fed (Bhatt 1982: cxii). Daily rites are thereafter performed involv-ing bathing the icon (abhis.eka), its decoration, the offering of vegetarian food(naivedya) to the accompaniment of ringing bells, the vision (dars ́ana) of the deityfor devotees, and the offering of light (dı ̄pa).Daily domestic rites of the S ́aiva Siddha ̄nta initiate involve a similar patternof making offering to a lin.ga. This will involve the tantric pattern of the devoteebathing, purifying the body through its symbolic destruction (bhu ̄tas ́uddhi),re-creating a divine body through the imposition of mantras (nya ̄sa), mentalworship (antara/ma ̄nasa-ya ̄ga), followed by external worship (bahya-ya ̄ga) withofferings into the fire pit (Davis 1991: 51–60; 148–62. For a complete accountof daily ritual see SSP vol. 1, 1963 and Brunner-Lachaux’s introduction). As wehave seen, the initiate into the tantric systems of the “left,” while conforming toorthodox society, after his initiation undertook worship of the trident man.d.alain his imagination (Sanderson 1985) and made offerings of impure substancesin the Kaula system (kula prakriya ̄). But even within the S ́aiva Siddha ̄nta thereare varying levels of commitment and expectation. The texts speak of four kindsof devotee: the samyinwho has simply undergone the basic initiation or sama ̄yadı ̄ks.a ̄discussed above; the putraka,who has also undergone the nirva ̄n.a-dı ̄ks.a ̄;thea ̄ca ̄ryawho can perform initiations and has undergone a special consecra-tion called the a ̄ca ̄rya ̄bhis.eka; and the sa ̄dhakawho desires to follow the path of power and has undergone the sa ̄dhaka ̄bhis.eka(see Brunner 1975). TheMatan.gapa ̄rames ́vara ̄gamasays that the samayin should serve his teacher in 220gavin flood"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"order to eventually be granted liberation, the putraka should be detached with eveness of behavior, and serve his teacher, his god, and the sacred fire, whilethe sa ̄dhaka is an ascetic (tapasvin) whose consciousness is one-pointed in hisrepetition of mantra to attain his goal. The a ̄ca ̄rya must teach and so cannotspend too much time on his practice of repetition and meditation (Mat.Carya ̄pa ̄da 4. 2–17). Although this is a schematic structure, it does have somebearing on the social world, although the sa ̄dhaka, as Brunner has observed, isa “personnage oubliée” in modern India. Private practice is nevertheless stillimportant on the S ́aiva path and not only ritual, but yoga and meditation are apart of this.Private YogaWhile it is often not meaningful to draw a hard distinction between private ritualand yoga, there are nevertheless practices beyond the basic daily ritual structurethat can be undertaken. Many dualistic Tantras have sections on yoga (theyogapa ̄da), often virtually identical to the yoga of Patañjali, and some S ́aivaSiddha ̄nta texts are devoted to yoga, such as Jña ̄napraka ̄s ́a’s S ́ivayogaratna(Michaël l 1975). But in nondualistic S ́aivism there is a particular emphasis onvarious kinds of yoga practice beyond the ritual obligations of the initiate. Thesepractices are categorized into four methods or ways (upa ̄ya): the “non-means” orthe pathless path (anupa ̄ya), the divine means (s ́am.bha ̄vopa ̄ya), the way of energy(s ́a ̄ktopa ̄ya), and the individual means (a ̄n.avopa ̄ya) (see Dyczkowski 1987:163–218). This structure, the oldest description of which is in the Ma ̄linı ̄vijay-ottara Tantrawhere they are called “immersions” or “possessions” (sama ̄ves ́a)(MVT 2.21–3), was used by the monistic S ́aivas Abhinavagupta and Ks.emara ̄jaas a lens through which to view the earlier tradition. Thus Ks.emara ̄ja uses thescheme as a way of organizing the S ́iva Su ̄tras. The classification of the threeupa ̄yasrelates to the three perceived human and divine faculties of desire or will(iccha ̄), cognition (jña ̄na), and action (krı ̄ya ̄). Thus the s ́am.bha ̄vopa ̄yais linked to desire or will as the sudden upsurge of emotion and instinct that shattersthought construction, thereby enabling the adept to perceive the nonduality ofconsciousness. This can be achieved through extreme situations of fear orthrough inducing pain by scratching the arm with a sharp instrument (VB 93),through the arising of sexual desire (VB 41, 73) and so on. Abhinavagupta evensays that thought-shattering energy (vı ̄rya) can arise in the heart upon seeing aloved one unexpectedly (PTV p. 16). In fact any emotional situation is potentiallytransformative.Thes ́a ̄ktopa ̄ya,in contrast to the s ́a ̄mbhava, which is without thought con-struction (nirvikalpa), is achieved by using the faculty of cognition. By focusingon a pure thought construction (s ́uddhavikalpa) that corresponds to a true stateof affairs, such as “I am S ́iva” or “I am omnipresent” (VB 104), the mind isgradually purified until the truth of the claim is existentially realized.the s ́aiva traditions221"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"In contrast to the s ́a ̄ktopa ̄yawhich develops a pure thought unsupported byany practices external to it, the a ̄n.avopa ̄yadevelops thought supported by exter-nal phenomena, namely mantra, meditation on the body, and external objects.Thea ̄n.avopa ̄yaalso includes yoga practices. Ma ̄linı ̄vijayottara Tantradefines theindividual means as being supported by the breath, postures, visualization, therotation of syllables (varn.a) in the breath, and focusing on an external place.Abhinavagupta says this external place refers to the body, breath, and externalritual objects such as the ritual area, the ritual diagram (man.d.ala), the chalicefor offerings (pa ̄tra), the rosary, and flowers (MVT 2.21; TS p. 45). All externalritual, mantra practice and meditation on the breath are supports of con-sciousness and means of purifying it to realize the nondistinction between theself and S ́iva for the monistic S ́aiva. Within the a ̄n.avopa ̄yais also the practice ofKun.d.alinı ̄ yoga. The Goddess Kun.d.alinı ̄ is the power (s ́akti) dwelling within thebody at the base of a central channel thought to pervade it, who, once awak-ened, rises up through this vertical axis of power to the crown of the head,whereupon the yogi awakens to the truth of his identity with S ́iva (Silburn1988). As she rises, she pierces various centers of power (cakra) located alongthe body’s axis. These centers became codified as six or seven (including thethousand-petaled lotus at the crown) and pervade later Hinduism althoughthere is a fluidity in the earlier texts; the system of six being probably originallypeculiar to a tradition focused on the goddess Kubjika ̄ (Sanderson 1985: 164).Thea ̄n.avopa ̄yatherefore develops the faculty of action (kriya ̄) rather than cog-nition or will.While the Ma ̄linı ̄vijayottarasays that the ways are identical as to goal but differas to method (MVT 2.25a), Abhinavagupta and his commentator Jayarathaclaim that the upa ̄yasform a graded hierarchy (TA 13. 157, upa ̄yayogakramata ̄),with the individual means at the bottom and the nonmeans at the top. But Abhi-navagupta also observes elsewhere that because of his extreme monism, therecannot really be any hierarchical gradation; any hierarchy (uttaratva) containsthe delusion of dualism (PTV p. 8). This idea is reflected in the last method, whichis no method. The anupa ̄yais the realization of the nonduality of self and S ́ivathat is a sudden realization, because the path and the goal are the same. Thisrealization without any method (other than the guru who is not a method) isunderstood as an intense descent of power (s ́aktipa ̄ta) and realization that con-sciousness was never bound. From this nondual perspective, the very idea of apath, which implies a journey from one place to another, is erroneous. Even theidea of a descent of power is problematic in this context. Abhinavagupta writesin an eloquent passage:The supreme Lord is the essence of his own light and our own self. By what meansthen is he to be achieved? Due to his own light he cannot be known. Due to hiseternity his essence cannot be attained. Due to the non-existence of a covering,there cannot be the cessation of a covering (of consciousness). What then is the means? If it is distinct then it cannot be accomplished. Therefore the totality is a single reality of consciousness only, undivided by time, unlimited by space,unclouded by constraints, unobstructed by forms, unsignified by word, andunmanifested by means of knowledge. (TS pp. 8–9)222gavin flood"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"Because there is only the reality of pure consciousness in this tradition, apractice cannot lead to a goal that implies a distinction between self and objectof attainment. The web of paths (upa ̄yaja ̄la) cannot illumine S ́iva (TS p. 9). Themonistic S ́aivism of Kashmir regarded this as its highest truth. If there is onereality only, there can be no distinction between knower (vedaka) and object ofknowledge (vedya) and nothing which is impure (SSV p. 8). Abhinavagupta iscertainly aware of this problematic. If the lord is equidistant from all points doesit make sense to also claim that he crowns a hierarchy? But while the traditionclaimed this nondual awareness to be the supreme realization, the traditionnevertheless cultivated an elaborate ritual structure and sought to defeat itsopponents, the dualist Saiddha ̄ntikas and the Buddhists, in theology.S ́aiva TheologyS ́aivism developed a sophisticated theology articulated in commentaries on its sacred texts. The S ́aiva Siddha ̄nta’s most important theologians in its earlyyears were Sadyojoti (eighth century), Bhat.t.a Ra ̄makan.t.ha (ca. 950–1000 ad),and Bhojadeva (eleventh century). These theologians through their textualhermeneutics argued for a dualism regarding the self and Lord which the non-dualist theologians of the Pratyabhijña ̄ attempted to refute. There was rigorousdebate between these two theologies, although the monists succeeded in sup-planting the Siddha ̄nta in Kashmir. Debate focused particularly on two issues:the first was the nature of the self, the second was the nature of matter, both ofwhich had consequences for practice.For the Saiddha ̄ntikas the self is quite distinct from the Lord and from matter.The self is in fact trapped or bound by matter from which it must break freethrough its own efforts, but ultimately through the grace of S ́iva, whereupon itwill achieve equality with him and not be reborn again. In his Nares ́varaparı ̄ks.aSadyojoti argues against his theological rivals to establish this position regardingthe self. The self is the knower and actor who experiences the fruits of his action(Nar 1.2) and is constituted by cognition itself. The self knows sense objects (heuses the typical Sanskrit expression “such as blue and so on”) as distinct, anddoes not perceive an undifferentiated field (Nar 1.13). He thereby argues againstthe monists from a pragmatic perspective of common experience as well asagainst the Buddhist view that there is no self but only a series of momentaryperceptions. Sadyojoti also goes on the argue, against the Mı ̄m.a ̄msa ̄, for theauthorship of the Veda by the Lord, arguing that the Veda is a sound which is aproduct and so must be produced from one whose knowledge transcends thehuman for it takes effort for us to understand it (Nar 3.76). This view of the selfas distinct is constantly refuted by the nondualists of the Pratyabhijña ̄ who sys-tematically present a nondual interpretation of sacred scripture and argue theirposition in independent treatises. Perhaps the best introduction to this theologyis Ks.emara ̄ja’s Pratyabhijn.a ̄hr.daya(“the Essence” or “Heart of Recognition”), acommentary on his own verses arguing against other theological positions.the s ́aiva traditions223"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"Apart from the nature of the self and its relation to the divine, the secondmajor area of disagreement between the S ́aiva Siddha ̄nta and the Pratyabhijn.a ̄was over the status of matter or rather the substrate of matter, ma ̄ya ̄. Both regardma ̄ya ̄as that which constitutes the cosmos. In the higher levels or pure creationof the cosmic hierarchy, comprising a number of levels or tattvas, it is called, bythe Saiddha ̄ntikas,maha ̄ma ̄ya ̄or the “drop” (bindu), while in the lower or impurecreation it is called ma ̄ya ̄. For the Siddha ̄ntama ̄ya ̄is an eternal substance (dravya)as real as the self and the Lord, upon whom the Lord acts through his regentAnanta and other higher beings (the Vidyes ́varas) to create the cosmos. Ma ̄ya ̄isthus the material cause of the universe (upada ̄naka ̄ran.a) whereas S ́iva is only theefficient cause (nimittaka ̄ran.a). For the Pratyabhijn.a ̄, by contrast, ma ̄ya ̄is not asubstance, but is a manifestation of pure consciousness or is, indeed, identicalwith pure consciousness. The consequences of these doctrines were the theo-logical justification of their practices. For the Siddha ̄nta liberation is the removalof impure substance from the self which, because it is a substance, can only bedone through action (i.e. ritual action). For the Pratyabhijn.a ̄ liberation is not theremoval of substance but the recognition of the self ’s identity with the absolute,and so is the highest knowledge and not action (see Sanderson 1992: 282–7).The methods whereby these doctrines were established were generally throughcommentary on sacred texts. The doctrinal neutrality of some texts was such thatthey lent themselves to both dualistic and monistic interpretations. Much ofthe language of these texts is in bad Sanskrit and the commentators, such asKs.emara ̄ja on the Svacchanda Tantraand Bhat.t.a Ra ̄makan.t.ha on the Kiran.a Tantra,excused this “language of the Lord” (ais ́a) as a kind of disruption of language due its sacredness (Goodall 1998: lxv–lxxi). Through their commentaries theS ́aiva theologians clarified the doctines of their own schools by drawing upon afull apparatus of techniques open to Indian philosophical analysis. For example,as Sanderson and Kahrs have shown, Abhinavagupta and Ks.emara ̄ja use amethod called nirvacana, an interpretive device whereby the name of a thing isanalysed into its component parts to reveal its true nature (Sanderson 1995:59–65). Through this method Ks.emara ̄ja inteprets the names of deities and theirmantras in an esoteric sense, thereby linking language and metaphysics. Forexample, Kahrs cites Ks.emara ̄ja’s analysis of the term “Bhairava” in his com-mentary on the Svacchanda Tantrato embrace a variety of meanings, such as hewho is the inner nature of yogins, who destroys transmigratory existence and soon. In this way monistic doctrines could be injected into the text if they were notthere already.ConclusionThis survey of S ́aiva history, practice and doctrine, shows the diversity of thetraditions. Yet it also shows a distinctive religious imaginairethat sets S ́aivismapart from other Indic traditions.

For example, there is a fascinating history of groups ofyogis known as Na ̄ths or Siddhas which has been strongly influenced by S ́aivismand a rich history of S ́aiva tradition in Southeast Asia (see White 1996). Untilthe last thirty years or so S ́aivism was often only given cursory treatment in thehistory of Indic religions. This was partly due to scholarly ignorance of thesetraditions and partly due to not taking seriously their major sources, namely theTantras. The situation has changed with groups of scholars working on thismaterial, particularly in Pondichery, Oxford, Paris, and Rome. In Pondichery the Centre d’Indologie has continued to edit and publish Tantras of the S ́aivaSiddha ̄nta and scholarly interest in S ́aivism exists at many major centers oflearning. The study of S ́aivism has contributed to our wider understanding ofHindu traditions in showing the importance of nonvedic, tantric tradition andthe incoherence of the term “Hinduism” in a historical context.As regards S ́aivism itself, the S ́aiva Siddha ̄nta still provides the ritual templateof temple worship in the South and is a form of S ́aivism that has come toAmerica in a new form as the Church of the S ́aiva Siddha ̄nta. The nondualisticS ́aiva traditions have been eroded over time, although the Pratyabhijña ̄ still has some followers and has become a tradition in the west, where it has influ-enced a number of contemporary groups, particularly Siddha Yoga and theNityananda Institute of Swami Cetanananda. The image of S ́iva is now deeplyembedded as a cross-cultural icon. It remains to be seen the extent to whichtraditional forms of S ́aivism will be eroded in India and to what extent it will be transformed in the global, new religious context.Abbreviations and Primary TextsISGI ̄s ́a ̄nas ́ivagurudevapaddhati, ed.

We will use the term “Vais.n.ava” in the ratheranachronistic way in which it is often used today among scholars, namely asdenoting those who worship Vis.n.u and his different aspects as well as the tradi-tions which they follow. While “Vais.n.ava” meant only “related with the godVis.n.u” in the early period, it also assumed another denotation, namely an affil-iation with the religion of which Vis.n.u is the god from around the fifth centuryad, for instance, in the title paramavais.n.avafound on the coins of Traiku ̄t.akakings Dahrasena and Vya ̄ghrasena. Kings of the eighth century continued to usethe title paramavais.n.ava. The Paus.karasam.hita ̄, one of the ancient Pa ̄ñcara ̄trasam.hita ̄s, also refers to paramavais.n.avas(Jaiswal 1967: 204; Matsubara 1994:19–20; von Stietencron 1978: 11). The term Vais.n.ava evokes a conception of an overarching and syncretic religion for it includes the worshippers of allaspects considered as those of Vis.n.u, like Kr.s.n.a, Narasim.ha, etc. although adevotee of Kr.s.n.a, who is classified as a Vais.n.ava, probably feels more a Kr.s.n.aitethan a Vais.n.ava.Indian literature employs many terms (like samprada ̄ya,pantha,mata,siddha ̄nta,parampara ̄, etc.) which could be translated more or less precisely as“tradition” and which are sometimes translated as “sect,” “system,” “school.”But a historical study of these Indian terms which often take particular shadesof meaning according to the context is beyond the scope of this chapter. We willavoid using the term “sect,” not only because this term, which has been used byscholars to signify socioreligious realities of great diversity, in an Indian contextwould need a lengthy discussion, but also because the very status of Indian"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"religious traditions and the definition of their members are often obscure and inany case evolved over the course of time. The use of “school” in this essay willbe reserved for Vais.n.ava doctrinal systems of the Veda ̄nta which were oftenaccompanied by socioreligious counterparts.We will neither follow nor examine ancient Indian doxographical views onVa i s.n.avism. Nor shall we study the relations of Vais.n.ava with non-Vais.n.ava tra-ditions and with non-exclusivist milieux which, like Sma ̄rtas, worshipped severalgods including Vis.n.u. This chapter is not a history of Vais.n.avism, which shoulddiscuss all facts and literatures related to the god Vis.n.u and the divine aspectsretrospectively considered as his manifestations. Therefore we will not considericonographical data, whose links with a specific Vais.n.ava tradition are often dif-ficult to demonstrate, nor fluid oral traditions associated with Vais.n.avism. Aspecial emphasis is laid on the rather neglected Vaikha ̄nasa tradition. The socialand political background, for which we have a scanty and uneven documenta-tion, is not examined.This chapter does not claim to be exhaustive. It only discusses traditionswhich exercised some influence and it is limited by the state of research on thesubject. Many Vais.n.ava traditions still need a critical examination and study oftheir history and their literary sources. The views of scholars remain bound bythe image which each tradition wished to project of itself and of other Vais.n.avatraditions under specific historical circumstances. Research also focused on theaspects which these traditions themselves brought forward – rites with pre-dominantly ritualistic traditions, doctrine with theologizing ones, devotion withdevotional currents – though most of these traditions were not without specificviews on each of these aspects. The chronology of several Vais.n.ava traditionscovers such a long period of time and shows such contrasted phases that we found it convenient to periodize their history according to the successivetendencies to which they gave shape.Early Bha ̄gavatismBha ̄gavata aristocratic patrons (second century BCto eighthcentury AD)Bha ̄gavatism is the first “Vais.n.ava” tradition to appear distinctly in history. Theearliest known use of the term bha ̄gavata(literally “relating to Bhagavant,” thatis, the Lord) is clearly associated with aristocratic patrons. Several inscriptionsfrom the second to first century bc, all of them found in a limited area of thepresent Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan states, except one from Maharashtra,record the existence of a Bha ̄gavata cult promoted by local rulers and men ofpolitical importance. This cult, associated with Na ̄ra ̄yan.a, Va ̄sudeva (=Kr.s.n.a)and sometimes Sam.kars.an.a (=Balara ̄ma, Kr.s.n.a’s elder brother), all “Vais.n.ava”divine aspects, is often marked by the erection of a Garud.a-pillar (in front of a230gérard colas"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"temple according to an inscription from Besnagar). In these early inscriptions,the Bha ̄gavata faith is not in contradiction with the patronage of Vedic ritualsbut they do not show with certainty a ritual admixture between these two ten-dencies, contrary to what has been sometimes interpreted (Meth Srinivasan1997: 196, about Ghosundi inscription).The most famous of these epigraphs is the Garud.a pillar inscription ofBesnagar (near Sanchi, Madhya Pradesh) usually dated second or first centurybc(Sircar 1942: 90). Its Prakrit text relates the setting up of a Garud.a pillar inhonor of Va ̄sudeva by a Greek ambassador Heliodora (=He ̄liodo ̄ros) ofTa[khkha]sila ̄ (=Taxila), the Bha ̄gavata. It mentions that three steps to immor-tality, when well practiced, lead to heaven: self-control, generosity, and vigilance(dama,tya ̄ga, and aprama ̄da), three virtues also extolled in the Maha ̄bha ̄rata(Brockington 1998: 266). Another inscription from Besnagar, in probably thesame period, records the setting up of the Garud.a pillar of an “excellent temple”(pra ̄sa ̄dottama) of the Lord (Bhagavat) in the twelfth regnal year of a king namedBha ̄gavata (here a proper name, not the name of a religious tradition), usuallyidentified with a S ́un.ga king (Jaiswal 1967: 153).An inscription of Pratapgarh (not far from Besnagar and today in theChitorgarh District of Rajasthan) dated probably second century bcrecords, ina sanskritized Prakrit, the erection of a pillar by Utararakhita who is said to bea saca ̄bha ̄gavata, “true[?] bha ̄gavata” (Salomon 1998: 240). The Ghosundistone inscription in Sanskrit dated first century bc(on the basis of its script) wasfound near Nagari (Chitorgarh District). This inscription, usually read with thehelp of the Hathibada inscription which bears a similar text, records the build-ing of a “stone-enclosure for the place of worship” (pu ̄ja ̄s ́ila ̄pra ̄ka ̄ra) called “theenclosure of Na ̄ra ̄yan.a” for the gods Sam.kars.an.a and Va ̄sudeva by a Bha ̄gavataking Sarvata ̄ta, performer of an as ́vamedhasacrifice (Sircar 1942: 91–2).The Nanaghat cave (Maharashtra) inscription of the Sa ̄tava ̄hana queenNa ̄yanika ̄, usually dated second half of the first century bc, though not explic-itly using the term bha ̄gavata, begins with an invocation to various gods includ-ing Sam.kars.an.a and Va ̄sudeva and records the sacrificial fees given to priests forthe queen’s husband’s sacrifices (including an installation of Vedic fires, twoas ́vamedhasand a ra ̄jasu ̄ya) (Sircar 1942: 186–90).By contrast with that early period, the extant epigraphic documents of thefirst three centuries of the Christian era do not seem to specifically mentionBha ̄gavatas nor any other particular “Vais.n.ava” tradition. In this regard, textualsources are the only possible evidence for this period. The Bhagavad-gı ̄ta ̄ (prob-ably first century ad) (Brockington 1998: 147) has been assumed to correspondto a Bha ̄gavata tendency or even affiliation (Esnoul 1956: 155; Matsubara1994: 2). However it does not contain the word bha ̄gavata. The Harivam.s ́a, a“supplement” (khila) to the Maha ̄bha ̄rata (usually dated third to fourth, some-times first to third centuries ad), mentions a ks.atriyadevotee, Akru ̄ra, payinghommage to Ananta (the lord of the serpents) who is qualified as Bha ̄gavata,with “Bha ̄gavata mantras,” an expression which could refer to sacred formulasof a Bha ̄gavata religious community (Couture 1986: 224–5; Couture 1991: 77;history of vais.n.ava traditions231"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"Brockington 1998: 326). The Na ̄ra ̄yan.ı ̄yaparvan of the Maha ̄bha ̄rata, datedthird to fourth/fifth century ad(Brockington 1998: 152; Schreiner 1997a: 1;Oberlies 1997: 86), does not associate any particular meaning with the termbha ̄gavata: the reference to bha ̄gavatapriyah.in verses 327.2 and 331.43 is toogeneral, the Poona edition accepts bha ̄gavataih.in 332.16 but as an uncertainreading and rejects the term bha ̄gavataas a variant reading in 322.22 and 324.1.The term bha ̄gavatareappears in epigraphy with the Gupta period mainly in the compounds paramabha ̄gavata(“supreme bha ̄gavata”) and maha ̄bha ̄gavata(“great bha ̄gavata”), current epithets of monarchs and rulers. The Gupta emper-ors from Candragupta II (fourth century) onwards styled themselves as Param-abha ̄gavatas. The same epithet was applied to Dhruvasena I (fifth century) inSaurashtra, Sam.ks.obha (early sixth century) in Central India, Can.d.avarmanand Nandaprabhañjanavarman, Kalin.ga monarchs of Orissa in the late fifth and early sixth centuries (Jaiswal 1967: 201 sqq.), several kings of the so-calledS ́arabhapurı ̄ya dynasty (seventh to eighth centuries) (von Stietencron 1978:11), and king S ́rı ̄vijaya Nandivarman of the S ́a ̄lan.ka ̄yana dynasty who ruledover the regions of Godavari and Kr.s.n.a in Andhra in the second half ofthe fifth century ad(Jaiswal 1967: 205). A Badami (Southern Deccan) sixth-century cave inscription records the patronage of the founding of a cave templeand the consecration of an image of Vis.n.u in it by king Man.gales ́a, aMaha ̄bha ̄gavata born in the family of the Calkya-s (=Ca ̄lukyas) who performedsacrifices like agnis.t.oma,agnicayana,va ̄japeya,paun.d.arı ̄ka,bahusuvarn.a, andas ́vamedha(Sivaramamurti 1966: 204–6). It appears from this sixth-centuryinscription that as in the earlier period, the aristocratic followers of Bha ̄gavatismdid not see any contradiction between their performance of Vedic sacrifices andthe worship of the image of Vis.n.u. It may be noted that the Tamil text Paripa ̄t.al(fifth or sixth century) which depicts Kr.s.n.a with Balara ̄ma, also mentionsGarud.a’s banner and Tiruma ̄l (=Vis.n.u or Kr.s.n.a) as manifesting himself in theVedic sacrificial post and fire (Gros 1968: xlix). But this text does not contain anyexplicit reference to Bha ̄gavatism.It however remains difficult to evaluate from the above evidence to whatextent the aristocratic patrons of Bha ̄gavatism from the second century bcto theeighth century adwere personally engaged in this tradition or religion. We donot know whether Bha ̄gavata gods were merely their tutelary deity or whetherthese patrons underwent an initiation, nor do we have any precise informa-tion on the type of rite they performed. No documentation enables us to knowwhether Bha ̄gavatism had a popular basis and whether it was an independenttradition with organized institutions.Bha ̄gavata priests in fifth- to sixth-century sourcesThe term bha ̄gavatawas also applied to a group of priests in charge of ritualinstallation of images of Vis.n.u in epigraphical and textual sources from the fifthto sixth century ad. But this does not imply that all Bha ̄gavatas were priests. A232gérard colas"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"fifth-century Sanskrit inscription of southeast Asia found in the ruins of themonument of Prasat Pram Loven of the Fu-nan (a kingdom which comprisedthe Mekong delta), mentions Bha ̄gavatas among those who should enjoy the giftwhich Gun.avarman donated to a newly installed footprint of Vis.n.u namedCakratı ̄rthasva ̄min. These Bha ̄gavatas are probably the priests of that image(Cœdès 1931; Bhattacharya 1961). The Br.hatsam.hita ̄ of Vara ̄hamihira (sixthcentury) prescribes that the ritual installation of an image should be performedby those devoted to that god – Bha ̄gavatas in the case of Vis.n.u – according totheir own rule (svavidhi) (chap. 60, verse 19, in Kern’s edition). An earlier verse(12) in the same chapter stipulates that during this installation, the “twice-born” (dvija) priest should sacrifice into the fire with the mantras which corre-spond to the god to be installed. We may infer from this that in the case of Vis.n.u,a twice-born Bha ̄gavata sacrifices with Vais.n.ava mantras.Yogic and Ascetic Traditions (third to ca. fifth century AD)Besides the Bha ̄gavata worship evidenced mainly through epigraphy, Sanskritliterature from around the third century ad, attests a tendency which stressesasceticism and yoga in association with devotion for Na ̄ra ̄yan.a. The existence oforganized Vais.n.ava ascetic communities in this period cannot be excluded,though documentation to sustain this hypothesis is scanty. The early Pa ̄ñcara ̄traand Vaikha ̄nasa traditions promoted this yogico-ascetic-cum-devotional ten-dency. A main trait of the early Pa ̄ñcara ̄tra view of ritual is non-injury, perhapsin answer to the Buddhist criticism of Vedic rites. The Vaikha ̄nasa tradition,especially as represented in its Sma ̄rtasu ̄tra, transformed Vedic types of rite andincluded image worship. This probably answered the questions which aroseabout the nature of ritual itself, on what the relations between Vedic rite and pu ̄ja ̄could be, and, perhaps, how far they could be combined in a devotional context.Early Pa ̄ñcara ̄tra and the Na ̄ra ̄yan.ı ̄yaparvan of the Maha ̄bha ̄rataScholars are not unanimous about the origin of the term pa ̄ñcara ̄tra as appliedto a Vais.n.ava tradition. Some trace it to the S ́atapathabra ̄hman.a (13.6.1)(usually dated between tenth and seventh centuries bc), which contains theoldest available occurrence of the term “pañcara ̄tra”: this passage describes thegod Na ̄ra ̄yan.a performing a pañcara ̄tra(“five nights”) purus.amedhasacrifice, afterwhich he is said to have surpassed all beings and become the entire universe.Modern scholars have proposed various explanations of the name (van Buitenen1971: 6 sqq.; Neevel 1977: 8–10; Brockington 1998: 299–301). Pa ̄ñcara ̄tra hasalso been said to be connected with the Eka ̄yana, a lost Vedic s ́a ̄kha ̄(“school”).Old Pa ̄ñcara ̄tra texts mention Eka ̄yana mantras and Eka ̄yana adherents(Matsubara 1994: 54; Bhattacharya 1967: 206). But the Na ̄ra ̄yan.ı ̄yaparvanhistory of vais.n.ava traditions233"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"(NP) of the Maha ̄bha ̄rata (12, 321–39) does not seem to mention the wordeka ̄yana, although it refers to Pañcara ̄tra (Schreiner 1997 (ed.), Lemma-Index).Some scholars consider the link of the Pa ̄ñcara ̄tra tradition with thisEka ̄yanas ́a ̄kha ̄ as a late fiction (Renou 1985a: 205).The NP is the oldest known source to record several theological and ritualcharacteristics of an ancient Pañcara ̄tra tradition, though it does not explicitelyoriginate from the Pa ̄ñcara ̄tra milieu. Devotion (bhakti), omnipresent in the NP, is addressed to the god Na ̄ra ̄yan.a, who also bears other names like Hari,Va ̄sudeva, and Vis.n.u. Without being anti-Vedic or Tantric in character, it tendsto subordinate Vedic rituals to its own renunciative ideology which upholds non-injury (ahim.sa ̄) and rites without animal sacrifice. The NP does not refute theway of ritual action (pravr.tti), but harmonizes it with suspending ritual activity(nivr.tti) and replacing it by yogic devotional practices. All sacrifices, whether exe-cuted with the expectation of fruits or not, are said to ultimately go to Na ̄ra ̄yan.ain whom the “exclusive worshippers [of Na ̄ra ̄yan.a]” (eka ̄ntins) finally enter. It hasbeen suggested that the NP perhaps evokes a concept equivalent to that ofrelease while living (Schreiner 1997b: 178).The term bha ̄gavatawhich seems to refer to devotees of Na ̄ra ̄yan.a in generalin the NP does not appear to be synonymous with the term pañcara ̄train thistext. Sa ̄tvata (which originally referred to the clan of Kr.s.n.a and later to his wor-shippers) appears more or less as an equivalent ofpañcara ̄train chapter 336,which belongs to the later part of the text (chapters 327–39, probably completedby the fourth to fifth centuries according to Schreiner 1997a: 1). This is notcertain in chapter 322, which belongs to the earlier part (chaps. 321–6, prob-ably written in ca. 200–300 ad, ibid., and Oberlies 1997a: 86). Verses 17–25 ofchapter 322 depict the domestic rites and conduct of King Uparicara Vasu whopracticed non-injury towards all beings, and being a devotee of Na ̄ra ̄yan.a, con-sidered himself, his kingdom and his possessions as belonging to Na ̄ra ̄yan.a. Heworshipped the Lord of the gods following the Sa ̄tvata method (vidhi) of worshippromulgated by the Sun god, he then worshipped the ancestors with the rest ofthe previous worship. He distributed the rest of the ancestor worship to vipras(Bra ̄hman.as or priests?) and others and consumed that which remained. Inverses 23–4, the king is said to have performed “the best rites” (paramakriya ̄h.),optional (ka ̄mya), periodical (naimittika), and daily (yajñı ̄ya), following theSa ̄tvata method. He used to feed in his house the knowers of the Pañcara ̄tra(pañcara ̄travit), a group which may or may not be different from the Sa ̄tvatas. Butin another passage of the older part of the NP (324, 28), King Uparicara Vasuis described as offering the five ka ̄lasto Hari, an expression which could be under-stood as referring to the Pa ̄ñcara ̄tra way of worship. This could either mean thatthe king practiced two ritual systems or that Sa ̄tvata is the same as Pañcara ̄traor, as it has been suggested, that Sa ̄tvata could be a branch of Pañcara ̄tra(Schreiner 1997a: 10).According to the NP, the Pañcara ̄tra-knowers who have attained the state ofeka ̄ntaenter Hari (337, 67). The Pañcara ̄tra is said to be a “great upanis.ad”which subsumes the four Vedas, Sa ̄m.khya, and Yoga into itself (326, 100). The234gérard colas"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"NP refers to two concepts which became essential in later Pa ̄ñcara ̄tra: the four-emanation theogony and the five-ka ̄laworship. The four emanations bear thenames of divine aspects known in mythology and iconography long before theNP: Kr.s.n.a-Va ̄sudeva, Sam.kars.an.a (Kr.s.n.a’s elder brother), Pradyumna (Kr.s.n.a’sson by Rukmin.ı ̄), and Aniruddha (Pradyumna’s son). The specificity of thePa ̄ñcara ̄tra teaching is its reinterpretation of these divine aspects in a cosmo-logical perspective. While, at a later time, Pa ̄ñcara ̄tra sam.hita ̄s name theseemanations as vyu ̄has, the NP employs the terms mu ̄rti(326, 66–70) andmu ̄rticatus.t.aya(326, 43) to refer to them, though it uses the name vyu ̄hain verse336, 53, where Hari is said to consist of one, two, three, or four vyu ̄has. Chapter326 (31–41) describes the unborn, unperishable Va ̄sudeva, supreme soul,purus.abeyond qualities (gun.a), entering the five elements which together are saidto be his body. Thus Va ̄sudeva is said to be born and is named jı ̄va(soul), the“knower of the field” (ks.etrajña) and is called Sam.kars.an.a. From this soul pro-ceeds Pradyumna who is the mind (manas) of all beings and into which all beingsdisappear at the time of dissolution. From this arises Aniruddha who is the ego (aham.ka ̄ra) as well as agent, effect and cause (kartr.,ka ̄rya,ka ̄ran.a) and fromwhom sentient and insentient beings come into existence. Sam.kars.an.a,Pradyumna, and Aniruddha as well as the entire universe arise from and dis-solve into Va ̄sudeva. Verses 68–9 mention the four emanations and the creationwhich ensues from them, Brahma ̄ the creator of the world being born ofAniruddha. Chapter 332 describes the four mu ̄rtisin the path of release: havingbecome minute, the “best of the vipras” enter the divine being (deva) from whichthey reach and stay in Aniruddha’s body. Having become mind, they enterPradyumna. Leaving Pradyumna they enter Sam.kars.an.a who is the jı ̄va. Then,freed from the three gun.asand pure, they enter ks.etrajñawho transcends thegun.as. Practicing penance and having attained eka ̄nta, they finally enterVa ̄sudeva who is the abode of all beings (14–19).The NP refers to the practice ofpañcaka ̄la. This characteristic Pa ̄ñcara ̄tranotion, current in the Pa ̄ñcara ̄tra Sam.hita ̄s, refers to five observances of the day:abhigamana(“approaching [of the god],” that is, morning prayer, ablutions, etc.),upa ̄da ̄na(collection of material of worship), ijya ̄(“sacrifice,” that is, worship),sva ̄dhya ̄ya(textual study), and yoga(meditation) (Gonda 1977: 72). The NPqualifies the eka ̄ntinworshippers of Hari as “knowers of the five ka ̄las”(pañcaka ̄lajña) (323, 42). King Uparicara Vasu is described as offering the fiveka ̄lasto Hari after he fell into a ravine because of non-observance ofahim.sa ̄(324,28). Pañcaka ̄lakartr.gati, that is, “the one who is the resort of the performer ofthepañcaka ̄la,” is one of the 171 epithets of Na ̄ra ̄yan.a, who is also designated aspañcara ̄trika(325, 4).Early Vaikha ̄nasa traditionAlthough an often discussed passage of the Cha ̄ndogya-upanis.ad (3.17.6)(which mentions a Kr.s.n.a) and comparatively late Vedic texts are associated tohistory of vais.n.ava traditions235"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"some degree with Vais.n.avism, no Vedic s ́a ̄kha ̄is so closely and exclusively con-nected with Vais.n.avism as the Vaikha ̄nasas ́a ̄kha ̄is. Two medieval Vaikha ̄nasatexts, the A ̄nandasam.hita ̄ and A ̄disam.hita ̄, ascribe the Vaikha ̄nasas ́a ̄kha ̄tothe Yajurveda. The first identifies Vaikha ̄nasa with Aukhya s ́a ̄kha ̄, whereas thesecond considers them as distinct. Dharmas ́a ̄stras often consider Vaikha ̄nasas,like Phenapas and Va ̄lakhilyas, as hermits (va ̄naprasthas), those who enter thethird stage of life in the varn.a ̄s ́ramasystem. In the NP, the Vaikha ̄nasa seers arethe second group after the Phenapas to receive the Eka ̄ntadharma (336, 14),Soma is the third to receive it, and Va ̄lakhilya seers are the fourth. However theVaikha ̄nasasma ̄rtasu ̄tra itself does not mention a category of hermits namedVaikha ̄nasas unless the Vairiñca category mentioned in that text should beidentified with Vaikha ̄nasa hermits.Both Vaikha ̄nasa Vedic su ̄trasnamely, s ́rautaandsma ̄rta(probably later thanthe fourth century and earlier than the eighth century) are attributed to a sageVikhanas by the Vaikha ̄nasa tradition. The oneness of their authorship is upheldby Caland in his posthumous edition of the Vaikha ̄nasas ́rautasu ̄tra (1941: xxv). Their South Indian origin is sometimes questioned but with no seriousarguments.Several passages of the Vaikha ̄nasas ́rautasu ̄tra reveal a strong tendencytowards devotion to Vis.n.u or Na ̄ra ̄yan.a. Meditation on these two divine aspectsaccompanies the performance of several ritual acts. The u ̄rdhvapun.d.ra, a mainemblem in later Vais.n.avism, which the patron of the sacrifice should draw onseveral parts of his own body, is eulogized. Some of the mantras which the textprescribes do not belong to known Vedic collections, but their full text seems tobe lost. The Vaikha ̄nasasma ̄rtasu ̄tra which consists of both Gr.hya and Dharmaparts, frequently mentions devotion to and meditation on Vis.n.u or Na ̄ra ̄yan.a. Itprescribes the installation and daily worship of Vis.n.u’s image at home, in atemple (perhaps private), or in a sacrificial pavilion which contains ritual fires.These rites involve the recitation of two mantras: the 8-syllable (om.namona ̄ra ̄yan.a ̄ya) and 12-syllable (om.namo bhagavate va ̄sudeva ̄ya) mantras whichbecame very important in the later Vais.n.avism. They also include elementswhich figure prominently in later medieval Vaikha ̄nasa rituals, like the invoca-tion of the four aspects of Vis.n.u, that is, Purus.a, Satya, Acyuta, and Aniruddhaand the introduction of divine power (s ́akti) into the image before worship.The Vaikha ̄nasasma ̄rtasu ̄tra is the only known text of its kind to prescribe aceremony of entry into the hermit stage of life. It describes hermits devoted toVis.n.u and practicing a yogawhich involves 10 external observances (niyama)(bathing, cleanliness, study, ascesis, generosity etc.) and 10 internal observances(yama) (truthfulness, kindness, sincerity, etc.). The practice ofyogais still moreimportant in the fourth stage of life, that of the renouncer who aims at unitinghis self with the Supreme Self. Besides the practice of the varn.a ̄s ́rama dutieswhich culminates in renunciation, the Vaikha ̄nasasma ̄rtasu ̄tra also describesyogic paths leading to the Brahman without qualities. It contrasts action “withdesire” (saka ̄ma) that is, seeking fruits in this world and the other, with “desire-less” (nis.ka ̄ma) action that is, the disinterested performance of what is prescribed.Desireless action is of two kinds: “activity” (pravr.tti) and “disengagement”236gérard colas"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"(nivr.tti). “Activity” signifies yogic practices and procures yogic powers, but doesnot procure release from further births. “Disengagement” characterizes thoseyoginsfor whom the only reality is the Supreme Self and who, having abandonedhouseholder life, realize the “union [yoga] of the individual self with theSupreme Self.” The Vaikha ̄nasasma ̄rtasu ̄tra distinguishes three classes of theseyogins, Sa ̄ran.ga, Eka ̄rs.ya, and Visaraga (or Visaraka), the first two classes com-prising respectively four (anirodhaka,nirodhaka,ma ̄rgaga,vima ̄rgaga) and five(du ̄raga,adu ̄raga,bhru ̄madhyaga,asam.bhakta,sam.bhakta) categories. The anirod-hakasonly practice meditation on Vis.n.u, while the rest of the Sa ̄ran.gas employmethods known from the classical Yogas ́a ̄stra. Among the Eka ̄rs.yas, the du ̄ragasmeditate on the occult body with its subtle veins (na ̄d.ika ̄), whereas the adu ̄ragasmeditate on the Supreme Self (parama ̄tman). The asam.bhaktaconceives the deityas the unique object of his sensorial perceptions: he contemplates the deity in itsform, enjoys its perfume, and salutes it, a devotional attitude reminiscent of theA ̄l ̄va ̄rs, the Tamil Vais.n.ava saints.Several groups ofyoginsare disapproved or even rejected. The vima ̄rgagasare“those who go the wrong way,” probably because they distort the (right) objectof the meditation (which is the Supreme Self, paramapurus.a, according to a latecommentary), although they practice “eight-limbed” (as.t.a ̄n.ga)yoga, consistingofyama,niyama,a ̄sana, etc. which the Yogasu ̄tras describe. The bhru ̄madhyagasare said to be “without authority” (nis.prama ̄n.a). The visaragaclass ofyoginswhich groups adherents of various currents and doctrines, is condemned.Qualified as “beasts” (pas ́u) and said to follow the “wrong path” (kupatha), theyreject the possibility of release in their current lifetime. This suggests that theauthor of the Vaikha ̄nasasma ̄rtasu ̄tra believes in what is generally known asrelease while living. This viewpoint as well as the primacy of Brahman withoutquality (nirgun.a) over Brahman with quality (sagun.a) differs from the position ofthe later Vais.n.ava Veda ̄ntic school of Vis ́is.t.a ̄dvaita (Colas 1996: 17–44).Ritualistic and Devotional Traditions (Sixth to Thirteenth Centuries)From the sixth century onwards, several Vais.n.ava currents gradually built up atextual corpus which helped them to fix and define their own tradition.A ̄l ̄va ̄rsThe 12 A ̄l ̄va ̄rs, Tamil poet-saints, composed devotional poems (collected underthe title Na ̄la ̄yira-divyaprabandham in the tenth century) from about the sixthor the early seventh to about the ninth century. Although they did not form ahomogenous tradition, their influence on other Vais.n.ava currents gives them animportant place in the history of South Indian Vais.n.avism. We know nothing oftheir affiliation to any specific Vais.n.ava tradition, if they had any.

Like other devo-tees of their time, the A ̄l ̄va ̄rs were probably often engaged in pilgrimage, sincetheir poems praise the presiding deities of 97 south Indian Vais.n.ava temples.These poems exhibit a high degree of learning and literary skill and can hardlybe termed as “popular literature.”Yogic practices like meditation play an important role in the Divyapraband-ham. The earlier A ̄l ̄va ̄rs, Poykai, Pu ̄tattu, Pe ̄y and Tirumal ̄icai sing of the mysticunion with Ma ̄yo ̄n ̄(Kr.s.n.a) attained through meditation and temple worship.Namma ̄l ̄va ̄r (Cat.ako ̄pan ̄), a later A ̄l ̄va ̄r (seventh or early eighth century), is pre-sumably the first to express devotion to Ma ̄yo ̄n ̄in terms of the passionate love ofa girl for her beloved (Hardy 1983: 307). Several poems of the Divyapraband-ham seem to show a kind of nondualism between the individual soul and Godand even the notion of release obtained while alive (Hardy 1983: 440–1).Though they cannot be said to illustrate a particular theological system, theycould be considered as poetical formulations of attitudes comparable to thosefound in the NP and in the Vaikha ̄nasasma ̄rtasu ̄tra.Soon after the last A ̄l ̄va ̄r, South Indian Vais.n.ava traditions encouraged the dif-fusion of the Divyaprabandham. Hagiography credits (S ́rı ̄ran.ga-)Na ̄thamuni(probably tenth century) with the rediscovery of these poems. From his timeonwards, the 4,000 stanzas of the Divyaprabandham were canonized andrecited in the Shrirangam temple, a practice which spread to other Vais.n.avatemples in South India. The Ko ̄yil Ol ̄uku, chronicle of the Shrirangam temple,describes the duties of the Araiyars or Vin.n.appañ-ceyva ̄r, literally “supplicants”who were and still are, in charge of chanting and illustrating (by stylized ges-tures) the Divyaprabandham and enacting simple religious dramas. The oldestknown inscription mentioning the Araiyars goes back to the end of the eleventhcentury. Today, male descendants of hereditary lineages of Araiyars perform inthree temples of Tamil Nadu (Shrivilliputtur, Shrirangam, and Alvar-tirunagari)and in the temple of Melkote in Karnataka (Hari Rao 1961: 78–9, 90;Ve ̄n.kat.ara ̄man ̄1985).Sa ̄ttvatas and Bha ̄gavatasSa ̄ttvatas and Bha ̄gavatas formed groups which are difficult to identify since themeaning of these terms changed according to the historical context. ThoughSa ̄ttvata (sometimes in the orthography Sa ̄tvata) sometimes appears to besynonymous with Pa ̄ñcara ̄tra (Matsubara 1994: 60–2), it may not always have been the case as we saw in a passage of the NP. A ninth-century Cambodianinscription (stele of Prasat Komnap) which records the foundation byYa s ́ovarman I of a Vais.n.ava monastery (vais.n.ava ̄s ́rama) designed to feedVa i s.n.avas, mentions three denominations among them: pañcara ̄tra,bha ̄gavata,andsa ̄ttvatas, but it does not yield any precise definition of sa ̄ttvata (Cœdès 1932:88–112).238gérard colas"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"Several scholars consider that the term bha ̄gavatarefers to a group of Vais.n.avaSma ̄rtas which was already in existence in the sixth century adand was stillwidespread in south India at the beginning of the twentieth century. TheseBha ̄gavatas are said to adhere to nondualism and worship the five gods Vis.n.u,S ́iva, Durga ̄, Su ̄rya, and Gan.es ́a, consider Vis.n.u equal to S ́iva, by contrast withother Sma ̄rtas who prefer Siva to Vis.n.u. Their main scripture is said to be theBha ̄gavatapura ̄n.a and their mantra om.namo bhagavate va ̄sudeva ̄ya(Farquhar1967: 142–3; 181; 233; 297–8). A “Bha ̄gavatasamprada ̄ya” group ofVa i s.n.avas having the above characteristics was known until recently in theKannad.a country. Its priests officiate in temples, several of them in Udipi. Curi-ously, they follow the S ́aiva ̄gama (not the Pa ̄ñcara ̄tra ̄gama) ritual, though theyseem to have integrated Pa ̄ñcara ̄tra ritual elements (Siauve 1968: 11–12).Bha ̄gavata is also the name of Brahmin actors ofku ̄cipu ̄d.iwho enact plays onVa i s.n.ava themes in the Telugu country (Sastry 1991: 64).The significance of the term bha ̄gavata vis-à-visthe term pa ̄ñcara ̄trafluctuatedfrom the seventh century onwards. It signified devotee of the Lord in generalincluding Pa ̄ñcara ̄trins or referred to the follower of a specific Bha ̄gavata tradi-tion or was taken as synonymous with Pa ̄ñcara ̄trin. Ba ̄n.a’s Hars.acarita (seventhcentury) clearly mentions Bha ̄gavata and Pa ̄ñcara ̄trika as distinct groups.Vaikha ̄nasa texts of around the tenth century set the Bha ̄gavatas andPa ̄ñcara ̄trikas apart. They describe Bha ̄gavatas as “tonsured,” their doctrinebeing “secondary” and their scriptures being “mixed” (Colas 1996: 173). But by the eleventh century Vis ́is.t.a ̄dvaitins like Ya ̄muna and Ra ̄ma ̄nuja identifyBha ̄gavatas with Pa ̄ñcara ̄trins.Evidence from Cambodian epigraphy shows that a Bha ̄gavata could be onewho performs temple rites and perhaps also a Pa ̄ñcara ̄tra expert or one whoresides in a Vais.n.ava monastery. The mid-seventh-century deteriorated inscrip-tion of the stele of Baset found at Battamban records that the a ̄ca ̄ryaDharmapa ̄lawho was born in a Bha ̄gavata family installed an image of Acyuta and mentionshis (?) expertise in Pa ̄ñcara ̄tra (Cœdès 1942: 193–5). A ninth-century inscrip-tion of Prasat Kok Po relates the ritual installation of an image of Hari in 857adby a “Bha ̄gavata kavi” named S ́rı ̄niva ̄sakavi who was the preceptor of Jayavarman III. It also mentions a member of S ́rı ̄niva ̄sakavi’s family,Amr.tagarbha, who bore the title Bha ̄gavata (Cœdès and Dupont 1937: 389–90).The above-mentioned ninth-century inscription of Prasat Komnap lists thequalifications of those Bha ̄gavatas who are eligible to reside in the Vais.n.avamonastery: they practice the three sandhya ̄rites, observe good conduct andtextual study, are not householders, restrain their senses, have nowhere to stayduring the rainy season, and eat one meal a day.The expansion and influence of the Pa ̄ñcara ̄tra systemThe early history of the Pa ̄ñcara ̄tra and of its corpus after the NP (see above) stillremains uncertain (Matsubara 1994: 17 sqq.).

The Jaya ̄khyasam.hita ̄, one of the Pa ̄ñcara ̄tra ancienttexts, mentions the Vaikha ̄nasa group which is presumably of south Indianorigin (Colas 1996: 22 n. 1; 53 n. 1).Ba ̄n.a (seventh century) mentions the Pa ̄ñcara ̄trikas. The Advaitin S ́an.kara(eighth century) refers to the adherents of the Pa ̄ñcara ̄tra (pa ̄ñcara ̄trasiddha ̄ntins)in his commentary on Brahmasu ̄tra 2, 2, 44. His criticism of their tenets provesthat the Pa ̄ñcara ̄tra doctrine was well-known in his time in south India. In spite of the importance of the Pa ̄ñcara ̄tra tradition, inscriptions referring to itare scanty (Smith 1968). A Tirumukkudal (Chengalpattu district of Tamil Nadu) inscription of Vı ̄rara ̄jendra Co ̄l ̄a (1063–9) records a donation to theVaikun.t.haperuma ̄l.temple partly for the maintainance of a Vedic college whereMaha ̄pa ̄ñcara ̄tra and Vaikha ̄nasa, among other subjects, would be taught(Sankaranaranayan 1983: 18–19).

S.I.I. 17: 270).In fact, Cambodian epigraphy provides a comparatively larger and earlier doc-umentation on Pa ̄ñcara ̄tra (often in the orthography Pañcara ̄tra). The seventh-century Thvar Kdei inscription mentions the well-known Pa ̄ñcara ̄tra caturvyu ̄haconcept. This notion, though not the term vyu ̄ha, apppears in inscriptions of KohKer (during the reign of Jayavarman IV, 921– 41 ad), Pre Rup (961 ad, Ra ̄jen-dravarman), Prasat Kok Po (during the reign of Jayavarman V, 968–1001 ad)(Bhattacharya 1961: 98). The already mentioned Baset inscription (between648 and 657 ad) informs us about a person who performs the five sacrifices(yajña), follows the five timely observances (pañcaka ̄la ̄bhiga ̄min), and knows thefive elements “of those well-versed in the meaning of Pañcara ̄tra doctrine.”These observances probably refer to those of Pañcara ̄tra, and abhiga ̄minin thecompoundpañcaka ̄la ̄bhiga ̄minperhaps alludes to the first of them, abhigamana,that is, morning prayer, ablutions, etc. (Bhattacharya 1964: 50; 1965). A laterinscription from the reign of Ra ̄jendravarman (944–68 ad) mentions a priest“proficient in Pañcara ̄tra” and “knower of the five timely observances(pañcaka ̄la)” (Cœdès 1953: 121). The already mentioned Prasat Komnap steleinscription (late ninth century) mentions knowers of the Pañcara ̄tra precepts(pañcara ̄travidha ̄najña) among guests to be honored, which means perhaps thatthey were not permanent residents of the Vais.n.ava ̄s ́rama (Cœdès 1932: 88–112,esp. 98). The Kup Trapan Srok stele in Khmer records the activities of a sacer-dotal family, an ancestor of whom, named Kavı ̄s ́varapan.d.ita, followed thePañcara ̄tra observances, was the head of four hermitages, installed an image ofBhagavatı ̄ (in 1003 ad) and a lin.ga. Other members of his family installedvarious non-Vais.n.ava representations like Can.d.ı ̄ and lin.gas(Cœdès 1942:129–33).

Pa ̄ñcara ̄tra rituals anddoctrine often inspired such systems as Vis ́is.t.a ̄dvaita, Dvaita, and later Vais.n.avaschools. Important Pa ̄ñcara ̄tra texts were still being written in India in theseventeenth century (Matsubara 1994: 34–5).Vaikha ̄nasa corpus of temple ritualsBy contrast with the influential Pa ̄ñcara ̄tra corpus, Vaikha ̄nasa scriptures, theirsu ̄tras, and the texts which govern their temple rites (here called “medievalcorpus” for the sake of convenience), remained comparatively less known tonon-Vaikha ̄nasas. This may be partly due to the fact that the Vaikha ̄nasa tradi-tion was reputed as a Vedic s ́a ̄kha ̄and not as a group to which one adheredthrough initiation. Nevertheless it greatly contributed to the growth of publictemple worship in South India before the reforms of Ra ̄ma ̄nuja who is said tohave favored the Pa ̄ñcara ̄tra method of worship.The evolution of the Vaikha ̄nasa community from its renunciative traits toprofessional priesthood practicing temple rites aiming at the prosperity of thesociety is not well known. It appears in a Karnataka copper-plate dated 828 adthat Vaikha ̄nasas also worshipped non-Vais.n.ava deities: this inscription men-tions that a Vaikha ̄nasa named Devas ́arman of the Ka ̄s ́yapa clan was commis-sioned to worship the image of a sword-bearing goddess for King Ra ̄jamalla II.Later south Indian inscriptions (especially from the eleventh century onwards),however, record Vaikha ̄nasas as priests in Vais.n.ava temples. One of them, an edictof the Co ̄l ̄a King Ra ̄jara ̄ja I, applicable to Co ̄l ̄a, Ton.t.ai, and Pa ̄n.d.ya regions, allowsvillagers to confiscate and sell properties on which Vaikha ̄nasas (among others)have not paid due taxes, thus indicating the affluence of the Vaikha ̄nasas of thatperiod. Epigraphic evidence attests that in the eleventh to twelfth centuries theVaikha ̄nasa tradition was considered both as a Vedic s ́a ̄kha ̄and reputed for thearchitectural and iconographic teachings of its scriptures (Colas 1996: 58–64).The main part or totality of the medieval corpus of Vaikha ̄nasas was proba-bly composed in a rather short period between ninth and thirteenth/fourteenthcenturies, that is, much later than their su ̄tras. Vaikha ̄nasas considered it as acontinuation with their su ̄tracorpus and forming with it what they call theVaikha ̄nasas ́a ̄stra. Its designation by the late expression “Vaikha ̄nasa ̄gama” isanachronistic. Vaikha ̄nasa tradition lists as many as 28 texts in the medievalcorpus and attributes them to Vikhanas’s four disciples: Bhr.gu, Ka ̄s ́yapa, Atri,and Marı ̄ci, and sometimes to a fifth author, An.giras, also often identified withMarı ̄ci. By 1997 nine texts of the corpus and the corresponding collection ofmantras were published fully or in part.Though the published texts mainly deal with ritual, they also provide somegnostic and theological teaching.

Its physiology which involves mystical centers and acomplex “vein” (na ̄d.ı ̄) system differs from that of such texts as the Hat.hayo-gapradı ̄pika ̄ (probably composed after the fourteenth century). Its metaphysicalspeculations consist of a kind of theistic Sa ̄m.khya with the emanation of suc-cessive “principles” (tattva) from the Primordial Matter (pradha ̄na,prakr.ti), butthis Matter ontologically depends on Vis.n.u. Its teachings are similar to those ofthe Vis.n.usmr.ti and it borrows certain passages almost verbatim from the Bha-gavadgı ̄ta ̄. Certain ritual passages of the corpus also prescribe meditations oncomplex metaphysical notions, for example the visualization by the performer ofthe god from his “undivided” (nis.kala) aspect to his aspect “with divisions”(sakala). Mantric texts like the Eka ̄ks.ara, the A ̄tmasu ̄kta, and the Pa ̄rama ̄tmikacontain the conception of an A ̄tman or Vis.n.u, both the creator of the universeand omnipresent in it.The major Vaikha ̄nasa theogonical notion is the group of “Five Manifesta-tions” (pañcamu ̄rti): Primordial Vis.n.u, Purus.a, Satya, Acyuta, and Aniruddha,already announced in the Vaikha ̄nasasma ̄rtasu ̄tra. The medieval corpus pro-vides abundant instructions for the installation of this group of Manifestationsin a temple. It considers the last four of these Manifestations as fractions of thePrimordial Vis.n.u and as incarnating his four qualities (dharma,jña ̄na,ais ́varya,andvaira ̄gya), four Vedas, four cosmic ages, etc. Purus.a etc. are sometimes iden-tified with Vis.n.u, Sada ̄vis.n.u, Maha ̄vis.n.u, and Na ̄ra ̄yan.a (or Vya ̄pin) (also men-tioned in Pa ̄ñcara ̄tra texts), and sometimes they are said to arise respectivelyfrom them. The medieval corpus contains frequent and long descriptions of theiconography and ritual installation of Vis.n.u’s incarnations (avata ̄ra), sometimesdivided into a ̄virbha ̄vas(Matsya, Ku ̄rma, Vara ̄ha, Nr.sim.ha, and Va ̄mana) andpra ̄durbha ̄vas(Paras ́ura ̄ma, Ra ̄ghavara ̄ma, Balara ̄ma, Kr.s.n.a, and Kalkin).While the Vaikha ̄nasas ́rautasu ̄tra, in common with Vedic and Mı ̄ma ̄m.sakatexts, did not recognize S ́u ̄dras (the fourth class of the society) and Anulomas(groups born from fathers of a higher class than that of the mother) as qualifiedto be yajama ̄nas, that is, institutors of Vedic sacrifices, the medieval corpusaccepts them as yajama ̄nasof several major temple rites like the installation of animage, festivals, marriage of the god with S ́rı ̄ and Bhu ̄. This admission was con-ditioned by the presence of devotion to Vis.n.u in the patron and by the ritual inter-mediary of a “king” (ra ̄jan), that is, of an economically and/or politically eminentperson (though perhaps not specifically a person of a Ks.atriya class which wasabsent from south Indian society). An initiation called Nigamadı ̄ks.a ̄ whichVaikha ̄nasas conferred to non-Vaikha ̄nasas served as a ritual recognition of thepresence of devotion. This positive reevaluation of the role of S ́u ̄dras and Anu-lomas perhaps corresponded to the growing economic and social importance ofthese potential temple patrons. They could not be classified as twice-born, as wasthe case with Vel.l.a ̄l ̄as, often agriculturists, whom inscriptions of the eleventhcentury mention as donors to Vaikha ̄nasa temples. The rather rigid social patternwhich the corpus prescribes is also mitigated by the omnipresence of devotion,ritualized or not, in the masses, for instance during the Festival (utsava), whenstrict rules against social promiscuity were lifted at least temporarily.242gérard colas"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"The medieval Vaikha ̄nasa corpus was addressed to Vaikha ̄nasas who weretemple priests.

The corpus limited temple priesthood to householders(gr.hastha) and Brahmanical students (brahmaca ̄rin), hermits and renouncersbeing denied this right (except in rare cases), thus making a remarkable shiftfrom the ascetic values which the Vaikha ̄nasasma ̄rtasu ̄tra promoted.

By contrast, Pa ̄ñcara ̄tra is consideredas “avaidika,”ta ̄ntrikaand sometimes as “cruel” (kru ̄ra), meant for ascetics andfor those who search exclusively for release, and is to be practiced in placesoutside villages and towns. This stern doxographical standpoint perhaps denotesa wish to restrain the influence of Pa ̄ñcara ̄tra in public temple worship. Currentpractice, however, was probably less rigorous, for the corpus itself prescribes aritual expiation in the case of admixing Pa ̄ñcara ̄tra and Vaikha ̄nasa systems ofworship, which implies that admixing was not infrequent. Although allocatingthe main ritual functions exclusively to Vaikha ̄nasas, it permits the employmentof Pa ̄ñcara ̄trins as ritual assistants (parica ̄raka).The word dı ̄ks.a ̄bears several meanings in the corpus. Firstly, dı ̄ks.a ̄refers to a pseudo-Vedic practice consisting mainly of a series of ascetic commitmentslike fasting, supposed to prevent the pollution of the priests and patrons whichwould occur due to birth or death in their families during the performance ofseveral long rituals (Colas 1999). Secondly, it refers to an “initiation in thematernal womb” (garbhadı ̄ks.a ̄) prescribed to all Vaikha ̄nasas. According to theVaikha ̄nasasma ̄rtasu ̄tra, the sacrament ofsı ̄mantonnayana(tracing a furrow inthe hair of a woman in the eighth month of her pregnancy) is followed by anoffering of rice cooked in milk to Vis.n.u and feeding the rest of it to theVaikha ̄nasa pregnant wife. The rather late A ̄nandasam.hita ̄ adds an initiationwhich consists of branding this rice with hot metallic forms of a disk and a conch(symbols of Vis.n.u) before it is fed to the pregnant Vaikha ̄nasa wife. There is noevidence for this practice being current at the time of the older and intermedi-ate texts of the corpus, and the very expression “garbhadı ̄ks.a ̄” which the A ̄nan-dasam.hita ̄ employs to refer to it may be still later than the introduction of thisceremony. Vaikha ̄nasas may have introduced this device perhaps under the pres-sure of Pa ̄ñcara ̄trins, as a proof of their Vais.n.avahood which they proclaim tobe innate.history of vais.n.ava traditions243"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"The corpus also prescribes two kinds of initiation (dı ̄ks.a ̄) to non-Vaikha ̄nasas:the Nya ̄sacakradı ̄ks.a ̄ and the Nigamadı ̄ks.a ̄. The Nya ̄sacakradı ̄ks.a ̄ seems to bementioned and described only in the A ̄nandasam.hita ̄. Meant for non-Vaikha ̄nasahermits, it consists of the application of a santal paste etc. with forms of a conchand a disk on the arms of the disciple with the recitation of non-Vedic formulas.The Nigamadı ̄ks.a ̄, also called taptacakra ̄n.kan.a(“branding with a hot disk”), ismentioned only in two texts, namely the Samu ̄rta ̄rcana ̄dhikaran.a, which isancient in the corpus, and the A ̄nandasam.hita ̄, probably a more recent one.According to the Samu ̄rta ̄rcana ̄dhikaran.a, this ceremony gives S ́u ̄dras and Anu-lomas the ritual qualification of offering a sacrifice and also enables non-Vaikha ̄nasas to be employed as cooks and ritual assistants in temples ofVaikha ̄nasa ritual, when born Vaikha ̄nasas are not available for these tasks.According to the A ̄nandasam.hita ̄, candidates to this initiation may be twice-born or S ́u ̄dras or belong to a “mixed class” (i.e., be Anulomas or Pratilomas). Itdescribes this ceremony which, like the Pa ̄ñcara ̄tra initiation, consists of fivesacraments: branding the arms of the initiand with hot metallic forms of aconch and a disk, directing him to wear the Vais.n.ava emblem (u ̄rdhvapun.d.ra) on12 parts of his body, attributing him a Vais.n.ava name, teaching him a mantra(on which details are not given), and introducing him to the Vais.n.ava “sacrifice,”that is, the worship of Vis.n.u.While the corpus naturally extolls its own ritual, it nevertheless allows tradi-tional and local customs to operate with regard to temples of “nonhuman”origin. Its rules are supposed to be applied to temples identified as those foundedby human beings, but not to temples of “nonhuman” origin that is, those sup-posed to correspond to a direct manifestation of Vis.n.u, or to have been foundedby other gods, or by a Seer or which are mythological (paura ̄n.ika). The texts thusleave a large scope for innovation since the human origin of a temple may beobliterated within a few years of its actual foundation.The main subject of the corpus, however, are the prescriptions relating toworship in public temples, for it is said that the all-pervasive Vis.n.u manifestshimself in the image out of compassion for his devotees. The older texts of thecorpus distinguish between domestic worship (gr.ha ̄rca ̄) and temple worship(a ̄layapu ̄jana), that is, in a public shrine, more on the basis of the importance ofthe ritual than of its nature. More recent texts differentiate between worship per-formed “for one’s own self ” (sva ̄rtha or a ̄tma ̄rtha), which brings fruits to the per-former, and that performed “for others” (para ̄rtha), which benefits the patronwho finances it. The notion ofyajama ̄nawhich the corpus applies to the patronechoes the Vedic division between the ritual patron and actual performers of therite. Temple rites and the results which they produce are often equated with Vedicrites and their results in a hyperbolic way. Temple worship is not only said to bean extension of Vedic rites, but also to last even after the yajama ̄nadisappearsand to benefit the whole village including those who do not practice the domes-tic fire-sacrifice.Vaikha ̄nasa temple worship consists of three aspects: yogic practices, pseudo-Vedic rites, and ceremonies performed to the material representation of the deity.244gérard colas"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"Though not numerous, yogic practices are not altogether absent from templeworship. Meditation plays an essential role at precise moments in the ritualperformance and the priest is often enjoined the practice of breath-control(pra ̄n.a ̄ya ̄ma). The Vima ̄na ̄rcana ̄kalpa contains a section on yogawhich is intendedfor the Vaikha ̄nasa temple priest though not exclusively for him. The final goal ofyogaissama ̄dhi, a state of release while living (jı ̄vanmukti), a notion which theVa i s.n.ava Veda ̄nta school of Vis ́is.t.a ̄dvaita rejects. The Vima ̄na ̄rcana ̄kalpa pre-scribes the classical pattern of an eight-limbed (as.t.a ̄n.ga)yoga. Its description ofyogabears close similarities with two chapters of the Ahirbudhnyasam.hita ̄, aPa ̄ñcara ̄tra text. It however conceives brahmacaryawhich forms part ofyogaprac-tice as fidelity to his spouse for the householder and sexual abstinence for thosein the other three stages of life, while the Pa ̄ñcara ̄tra text understands it as com-plete sexual abstinence even with one’s own spouse. Temple rites also involve pro-cedures which, though rather Tantric in character, can be understood as yogicbroadly speaking. Mystical gestures (mudra ̄) are very rare in the corpus but impo-sition (nya ̄sa) of mantras and germ-syllables (bı ̄ja) are prescribed (more often onthe image than on the ritual performer’s body). The Khila ̄dhika ̄ra enjoins a“purification of the elements” (bhu ̄tas ́uddhi) of the performer’s body throughmeditation, a procedure not found in the oldest texts of the corpus, but currentin Pa ̄ñcara ̄tra and S ́aiva ritual traditions. Ritual conceptualization of the divinepower (s ́akti), also found, for instance, in S ́aiva ̄gama, plays an important role inthe corpus, since the installation of divine power in the image is a condition sinequa nonfor its worship.Vedicized ceremonies often run parallel to ceremonies devoted to the image.They are borrowed from the Vaikha ̄nasa S ́rauta and Sma ̄rta Su ̄tras but are oftentransformed. Fire-sacrifices have a secondary importance during festivals anddaily worship but they are numerous and elaborate during the solemn installa-tion of an image in a temple. The fire-pavilion of the Vaikha ̄nasas ́rautasu ̄tra was rectangular in shape; that of the medieval corpus is made square to suitritual transformations. The five s ́rautafires and a sixth lotus-shaped fire called Paus.kara are installed around a central altar on which the image to beinstalled, and vases are placed. Each of these fires is identified with a world and with a divine Vaikha ̄nasa manifestation. Domestic fires prescribed by the Vaikha ̄nasasma ̄rtasu ̄tra are also sometimes added to these six fires. Fire-procedures, from their preparation and kindling to their abandonment or theirkeeping for daily worship, form a ritual cycle almost independant of imageworship, though the corpus sometimes attempts to connect them through thenotions of fire and divine power (Colas 1996: 280–3).The worship of the image of Vis.n.u, his different aspects, and attendants is themost prominent feature of temple ritual. The corpus contains a great quantityof iconographic descriptions of the numerous deities to be installed ideally inlarge temples with several enclosures. The same divine aspect can be representedby as many as five images (dhruva,kautuka-arca ̄,autsava,sna ̄pana,balibera), eachof them fulfilling a specific function. For instance, the fixed (dhruva) image, saidto represent the immovable and undivided (nis.kala) form of the god, is the reservehistory of vais.n.ava traditions245"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"of divine power. The mobile image of worship (kautuka,arca ̄) which receives theessential of the daily worship but draws its power from the fixed image, is saidto represent the movable and divided (sakala) form of the god.The main rituals are similar to those found in Pa ̄ñcara ̄tra and S ́aiva ritualtraditions. The initial rite is the installation (pratis.t.ha ̄) of a new image in a newtemple, a long rite in which major ceremonies are the opening of the eyes of theimage and the final shower of water imbibed with divine power on the installedimage(s). It could last several years because it is closely connected with the mate-rial construction of the temple. The daily rite of worship (nityapu ̄ja ̄) of thekautukaimage is usually performed three times in the day (morning, midday, andevening before sunset). There are many varieties depending on the number ofhomages it includes. The rite of the festival (utsava) may be the regular yearlyone (ka ̄lotsava) or motivated by faith (s ́raddhotsava) or of an exceptional charac-ter (naimittikotsava). It may last between one and 21 days. The texts of theVaikha ̄nasa corpus also prescribe expiatory rites (pra ̄yas ́citta,nis.kr.ti) and differ-ent kinds of solemn baths which are purificatory or expiatory in nature. Theyoften contain one or several chapters devoted to minor and optional festivals,thus giving a complete and vivid picture of the liturgical calendar of a southIndian temple around the tenth century.The production of religious literature by Vaikha ̄nasas did not cease with theirmedieval corpus but continued well into the twentieth century. Apart from belles-lettresworks, this later literature consists of ritual manuals, hymns, commen-taries on the Vaikha ̄nasasu ̄tras and Brahmasu ̄tras, on medieval texts and partsof the mantra collection. The Moks.opa ̄yapradı ̄pika ̄ by Raghupati Bhat.t.a ̄ca ̄rya(twentieth century?), for example, extolls the role of worship as a means ofrelease.Vaikha ̄nasas also tried to impose themselves as a third division ofS ́rı ̄vais.n.avism on a par with Ten ̄kalai and Vat.akalai. This later doctrinal depen-dance of Vaikha ̄nasas on S ́rı ̄vais.n.avism, even while they preserved their ritualspecificity, reflects a major departure from their tradition as represented in themedieval corpus (Goudriaan 1965; Colas 1988, 1995, 1996).The Rise and Development of Vais.n.ava Schools of Veda ̄ntaThe tenth to thirteenth centuries saw the rise and development of three Vais.n.avaschools of Veda ̄nta which gave theistic interpretations of Upanis.adic doctrines:Vis ́is.t.a ̄dvaita, Dvaita, and Dvaita ̄dvaita, to which modern scholars often addVis.n.usva ̄min’s school. Though these early Vais.n.ava Veda ̄ntic schools are oftengrouped together, their destinies varied much in terms of geographical expan-sion and influence. We do not have any extant text of Vis.n.usva ̄min’s system. Theother three schools produced articulated philosophical systems. They empha-sized the role of devotion as a means of attaining release (by contrast withS ́an.kara’s Advaita which considered knowledge as the sole means) and greatly246gérard colas"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"influenced directly or indirectly the later Vais.n.ava traditions. Each was accom-panied and more or less supported by a specific network of religious institutions,particular ritual systems and modes of transmission. Vis ́is.t.a ̄dvaita and Dvaitadeveloped and received a religious basis first and mostly in South India. There isno testimony of the influence of Nimba ̄rka, the Dvaita ̄dvaita founder, and ofVis.n.usva ̄min in south India, though hagiography places their birth in this partof the subcontinent.The school of Vis ́is.t.a ̄ dvaitaWhile Vis ́is.t.a ̄dvaita (“nondualism of what is qualified”) refers to a certain doc-trine, the term S ́rı ̄vais.n.avism (to be differentiated from the more general wordVa i s.n.avism) could be said to refer to the socioreligious manifestation of this doc-trine as it was integrated and promoted by Vis ́is.t.a ̄dvaita in south India. Modernscholarship does not seem to have yet brought out a clear historical definition ofthis term. In fifteenth-century epigraphy the term s ́rı ̄vais.n.avais used to qualifya Vais.n.ava group known as Sa ̄tta ̄da. It is today often taken as referring solely toa group of Brahmins called Aiyan.ka ̄rs, but it is admitted that the use of the wordmay have not been so exclusive in the past (Jagadeesan 1977: 323; Lester 1994:44, 47, 48; Hardy 1998: 101). The word s ́rı ̄in the expression S ́rı ̄-vais.n.ava issometimes explained as stressing the role of S ́rı ̄, the spouse of Vis.n.u, in this tra-dition (Renou 1985a: 652; 1985b: 22). Developed in south India, Vis ́is.t.a ̄dvaitacame to be known later as S ́rı ̄samprada ̄ya in north India.Vis ́is.t.a ̄dvaita is also called Ubhayaveda ̄nta since it refers to both (ubhaya)Veda ̄nta doctrine written in Sanskrit and the mystical experience recorded in theA ̄l ̄va ̄rs songs in Tamil as its sources. Vis ́is.t.a ̄dvaita usually considers Na ̄thamuni(probably born at the beginning of the tenth century) as its first teacher.According to hagiography, Na ̄thamuni was born in a Brahmin family inVı ̄rana ̄ra ̄yan.apuram (near Cidambaram) where he officiated in the temple ofRa ̄jagopa ̄la. His role in the rediscovery and early propagation of the Divyapra-bandham has already been mentioned. His instauration of the practice ofsinging the Divyaprabandham in the Shrirangam temple gave these hymns thestatus of Vedas. Scholars have argued for or against his being a follower ofPa ̄ñcara ̄tra ritual (Mesquita 1979; Neevel 1977). Renowned for his yogic capac-ities, he is attributed with several doctrinal works in Sanskrit which are knownonly through quotations in later texts. His Nya ̄yatattva, quoted by Ya ̄muna andVeda ̄nta Des ́ika, is considered as the first treatise which systematizedVis ́is.t.a ̄dvaita doctrine. His main disciple was Pun.d.arı ̄ka ̄ks.a (Uyyakon.t.a ̄r), himselfsucceeded by Ra ̄ma Mis ́ra (Man.akka ̄l Nampi). The works of these authors areknown only through quotations.Ya ̄muna (A ̄l.avanta ̄r, eleventh century) is the first a ̄ca ̄ryawhose several com-plete works are preserved. He was the grandson of Na ̄thamuni and like him anative of Vı ̄rana ̄ra ̄yan.apuram. He is said to have become an ascetic after severalyears of marriage.

He wrote the Stotraratna and theCatuh.s ́loki, two well-known poems, and the Gı ̄ta ̄rthasan.graha, a summary ofthe teachings of the Bhagavadgı ̄ta ̄. His Siddhitraya explains the Vis ́is.t.a ̄dvaiticconception of the individual soul, the Supreme being, and knowledge. HisA ̄gamapra ̄ma ̄n.ya which is the first extant Vis ́is.t.a ̄dvaitic work to defend theauthoritativeness of the Pa ̄ñcara ̄tra texts, argues that these texts are revelationsof the God and are equal to Vedas (Srinivasachari 1970: 512–16; Neevel 1977:17).Ra ̄ma ̄nuja (Ut.aiyavar, said to have died in ad1137) is the best known amongVis ́is.t.a ̄dvaitin teachers. According to traditional accounts, he was born inShriperumbudur near Kanchipuram in a Brahmin family. He was taught inKanchipuram by one Ya ̄davapraka ̄s ́a, probably an Advaitin, also sometimes iden-tified with the Ya ̄davapraka ̄s ́a, who propounded the Bheda ̄bheda philosophy. Hereceived instruction on the Divyaprabandham, Ra ̄ma ̄yan.a, and the true meaning(rahasya) of mantras from five of Ya ̄muna’s disciples. It is said that whenTirukot.t.iyu ̄r Nampi (Gos.t.hı ̄pu ̄rn.a) taught Ra ̄ma ̄nuja the secret meaning of theeight-syllabled mantra (om.namo na ̄ra ̄yan.a ̄ya), Ra ̄ma ̄nuja immediately revealed itfrom the Tirukoshtiyur temple tower out of compassion for the crowd gatheredin the shrine. Ra ̄ma ̄nuja left the life of a householder, became a renouncer, andwas called to preside over the activities of the Shrirangam temple. It is said thatduring his north Indian pilgrimage he read in Kashmir a manuscript of theBodha ̄yanavr.tti, a commentary of the Brahmasu ̄tras, which later formed thebasis of his own commentary. To escape the persecution of Vais.n.avas by the Co ̄l ̄aking Kulottun.ga I, a fanatical follower of S ́aivism, he fled from Shrirangam toKarna ̄t.aka where he converted the Jain Hoysala king Bit.t.ideva (Vis.n.uvardhana)to Vais.n.avism. He is said to have returned to Shrirangam in 1118 where, asadministrator of the temple, he replaced the Vaikha ̄nasa mode of worship withthat of the Pa ̄ñcara ̄tra. He is also said to have established the Pa ̄ñcara ̄tra systemof worship in many other Vais.n.ava temples. There is, however, no historical basisfor this.Ra ̄ma ̄nuja’s S ́rı ̄bha ̄s.ya, a commentary on the Brahmasu ̄tras, establishedVis ́is.t.a ̄dvaita as a full-fledged philosophical school. Its main conception is thatthe Brahman has the individual souls (cit) and the insentient world (acit) as hismodes (praka ̄ras). Both these modes are as real as the Brahman and dependenton him as the body is dependent on the soul. Ra ̄ma ̄nuja also wrote short trea-tises on these su ̄tras, the Veda ̄ntasa ̄ra and the Veda ̄ntadı ̄pa, as well as a com-mentary on the Bhagavadgı ̄ta ̄. His Veda ̄rthasam.graha refutes nondualist anddualist doctrines and explains seemingly contradictory Upanis.adic passages. Theattribution to Ra ̄ma ̄nuja of the Nityagrantha, which gives instructions for thepersonal daily worship of an image, has been challenged. Three devotionalpoems are attributed to him (Vaikun.t.hagadya, S ́aran.a ̄gatigadya, S ́rı ̄ran.gagadya)(Hari Rao 1961: 45; Srinivasachari 1970: 516–21; Carman 1981: 24–64).Pil.l.ai Loka ̄ca ̄rya and Veda ̄nta Des ́ika are two major figures of Vis ́is.t.a ̄dvaitaafter him. Pil.l.ai Loka ̄ca ̄rya seems to have flourished during the second half of248gérard colas"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"the thirteenth century. His works mainly written in a highly sanskritized Tamil(Man.iprava ̄l.a), are compiled under the title As.t.a ̄das ́arahasya, 18 texts of whichthe Tattvatraya, the Arthapañcaka, and the S ́rı ̄vacanabhu ̄s.an.a are well-known.Man.ava ̄l.ama ̄mun ̄i (also named Varavaramuni and Ramyaja ̄ma ̄trimuni, four-teenth century), a celebrated commentator of the works of Pil.l.ai Loka ̄ca ̄rya, alsowrote the Yatira ̄javim.s ́ati, a well-known hymn on Ra ̄ma ̄nuja. Following the pre-ceptors of Shrirangam, he was actively engaged in expounding the devotionalteachings contained in the hymns of the A ̄l ̄va ̄rs. Veda ̄nta Des ́ika (Ven.kat.ana ̄tha),born and educated in Kanchipuram, was a younger contemporary of Pil.l.aiLoka ̄ca ̄rya whom he controverts in his works. He is credited with 130 works inSanskrit, Tamil, and Man.iprava ̄l.a which contain commentaries on the works ofYa ̄muna and Ra ̄ma ̄nuja, independent treatises, devotional hymns, and literaryworks. A brilliant logician, he not only perfected the doctrine of Vis ́is.t.a ̄dvaita andrefuted the doctrines of rival schools but also developed Vis ́is.t.a ̄dvaita logic basedon the works of Vis.n.ucitta, Na ̄thamuni, and others. He gave a theistic interpre-tation of the Pu ̄rvamı ̄ma ̄m.sa ̄su ̄tras which he considered as forming one workwith the Brahmasu ̄tras. He emphasized the role of “self-surrender” (prapatti, theattitude whereby the soul surrenders the responsibility of its protection to God)towards release and defended the authority of Pa ̄ñcara ̄tra scriptures. True to thespirit of Ubhayaveda ̄nta, he summarized Namma ̄l ̄va ̄r’s hymns in Sanskrit (Singh1958).The schism between the Vat.akalai (“the Northern division”) which traces itsorigin to Veda ̄nta Des ́ika and the Ten ̄kalai (“the Southern division”) which tracesits origin to Pil.l.ai Loka ̄ca ̄rya and Man.ava ̄l.ama ̄mun ̄i is not attested before the latesixteenth century (Mumme 1988: 2). Some scholars explain this split as result-ing from the Vat.akalai preference for the Sanskrit tradition and the Ten ̄kalaipreference for the Tamil Divyaprabandham (Appadurai 1977: 56). However thedifferences between these two divisions are based not so much on linguisticgrounds as on doctrinal principles (Mumme 1988: 6–7). One of the principaldifferences (which later texts believe to be 18 in number) concerns the definitionofprapatti. The Vat.akalai, according to which the soul is required to make aneffort to be saved by Vis.n.u, is often described as the school of the monkey’s baby,which clings to its mother. By contrast, the Ten ̄kalai, according to which Godalone chooses those whom he wants to save, believes that the soul shouldabandon all effort. It is known as the school of the kitten, for the kitten lets itsmother carry it around in her mouth. Another subject of doctrinal dissensionwas the role of Laks.mı ̄. The two schools stress her role as an intermediarybetween God and the devotee, but the Vat.akalai believes that she is infinite andontologically of the same level as Vis.n.u while the Ten ̄kalai holds that she is onlya soul (jı ̄va) which is ever liberated. Vat.akalai followers give more importance toritual performance than the Ten ̄kalai. Both the divisions consider the initiationby the five sacraments (pañcasam.ska ̄ras) indispensable, but while the Ten ̄kalaifollowers do not see the need of a further formal initiation into prapatti, theVa t.akalai consider it to be necessary. In the course of time the antagonismbetween the two divisions expressed in such minor details as the shape of thehistory of vais.n.ava traditions249"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"Va i s.n.ava emblem (u ̄rdhvapun.d.ra) applied on the body and the order of dishesserved during a meal (Siauve 1978, Mumme 1988, Jagadeesan 1977: 171–208,Varadachari 1983). Quarrels between them even occasioned lawsuits through-out the eighteenth and until the twentieth centuries (Hari Rao 1964: 117–28).This split which concerned devotees who financed the temple rites affected thecurrent administration of temples and minor aspects of rituals, but not the coreof the rites which Vaikha ̄nasa or Pa ̄ñcara ̄tra priests continued to perform accord-ing to their own ritual tradition, even as the particular emblem of one of the two divisions was imposed on the walls of the shrine, its main idol, or its priests(Colas 1995: 124, 125–6).The notion of lineage (parampara ̄) has a special importance in S ́rı ̄vais.n.avismin which various currents continuously tried to define themselves through dis-tinct lines of affiliation, because during the daily ritual, a S ́rı ̄vais.n.ava recites thenames of teachers in an order of priority which reflects his spiritual lineage. Twotypes of lineages are invoked: the A ̄ca ̄rya- (or Sama ̄s ́rayan.a-)parampara ̄, that is,lineage of the initiating preceptor, and the Grantha-parampara ̄, that is, thelineage of the preceptor-commentator of sacred texts.

Prestigious S ́rı ̄vais.n.ava families like the Uttamanampis and theTa ̄ta ̄ca ̄ryas still claim that their religious honors and privileges originate from histime. Several S ́rı ̄vais.n.avas who did not belong to any line of preceptorialsuccession acted as masters and initiated disciples (Jagadeesan 1977: 42–3, 47,51, 113–14).The Ko ̄yil Ol ̄uku (probably eighteenth-century in its present form) attributesRa ̄ma ̄nuja with the assignment of religious functions to S ́u ̄dra groups, not arevolutionary step, given the role already played by S ́u ̄dras as patrons in Vais.n.avatemples. Among them, Sa ̄tta ̄das (also named Sa ̄ta ̄nis), identified as Vel.l.a ̄l ̄as (thatis ranked among S ́u ̄dras) but also sometimes as Bra ̄hman.as, officiated as admini-strators of feeding houses for pilgrims at Shrirangam, Tirupati, and Kanchipu-ram during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. They also were in charge ofproviding flowers and other ingredients for temple worship and participated inthe recitation of the Divyaprabandham. Even today Sa ̄tta ̄das have the religiousprivilege of performing similar services in temples in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka,and Andhra Pradesh. Some of them also officiate as priests in small temples(Hari Rao 1961: 50, 90; Lester 1994).The late fourteenth century saw the rise and development of S ́rı ̄vais.n.avamonasteries (mat.has,mutts). It is not known with certainty which partYa ̄muna ̄ca ̄rya and Ra ̄ma ̄nuja (also named yatira ̄ja, “king of renouncers”) playedin the origin of S ́rı ̄vais.n.ava ascetic orders, though both of them are said to haveembraced an ascetic life. Vis ́is.t.a ̄dvaitin renouncers (sam.nya ̄sins) are usuallycalled “three-staffed” (tridan.d.in) by contrast with the “single-staffed” (ekadan.d.in)Advaitins who considered that the triple-staff custom is meant for lower classes of renouncers (Olivelle 1986: 53).

Among the well-known Ten ̄kalaimonasteries, mention should be made of the Va ̄namamalai Mat.ha (which hada special importance for the Ra ̄ma ̄nandasamprada ̄ya, a Vais.n.ava tradition ofnorth India), the Tirukkurungudi Mat.ha and the S ́rı ̄ran.gana ̄ra ̄yan.a-cı ̄yar Mat.hawhich were probably founded about the fourteenth century (Appadurai 1977;Jagadeesan 1977: 147–68; Lester 1992; Clémentin-Ojha 1999: 74).The school of DvaitaMadhva (probably 1238–1317), also named A ̄nandatı ̄rtha, A ̄nandajña ̄na,A ̄nandagiri, and Pu ̄rn.aprajña, is the founder of the Dvaita, that is, dualisticschool of Veda ̄nta later known as “Brahmasamprada ̄ya” in the north IndianVa i s.n.ava milieux. Information about his life comes mainly from the Madhvavi-jaya, a hagiography by Na ̄ra ̄yan.apan.d.ita ̄ca ̄rya, the son of one of his direct disci-ples. Born of Tul.u brahmin parents in the village of Pa ̄jakaks.etra near Udipi inKarnataka, Madhva became a renouncer at the age of 16 as an unmarriedperpetual religious student (nais.t.hikabrahmaca ̄rin). He acknowledged no otherteacher than the mythical Vya ̄sa, but according to hagiography an Advaitinascetic, Acyutapreks.a (Purus.ottamatı ̄rtha), was his master and initiated him.Though Madhva refused his doctrine, he succeeded him as the head of hismonastery. The debates he had with scholars in the course of his tours all overIndia strengthened his conviction against Advaitic doctrine and he converted hismaster to his own views. He installed an image of Kr.s.n.a in Udipi and promotedseveral ritual reforms like the substitution of a flour-made sacrifice animal(pis.t.apas ́u) in the place of a living one. The prestige of his school increasednotably after the conversion of Trivikrama, a then-famous Advaitin and proba-bly the court-pandit of King Jayasim.ha, to Dvaita.Thirty-seven works are attributed to Madhva. Several of them consist ofcommentaries on basic texts of the Veda ̄nta (Upanis.ads, Brahmasu ̄tras, andBhagavadgı ̄ta ̄), on the Maha ̄bha ̄rata and the Bha ̄gavatapura ̄n.a, a text to which,unlike Ra ̄ma ̄nuja, Madhva gave much importance. His ta ̄tparyason Bha-gavadgı ̄ta ̄, Maha ̄bha ̄rata, and Bha ̄gavatapura ̄n.a, give the essential teachings ofthese texts important to Dvaita school. Madhva summarizes his main doctrinalprinciples in 10 very brief treatises called the Das ́aprakaran.as. Several devo-tional hymns are attributed to him. He also wrote several ritual treatises like theYatipran.avakalpa, which explains how to enter the renunciative way of life.history of vais.n.ava traditions251"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"Madhva’s works often quote from Pa ̄ñcara ̄tra texts which he considers as author-itative as the Veda because, according to him, these two originally formed onetradition (Siauve 1968: 16). His Tantrasa ̄rasan.graha seems to follow thePa ̄ñcara ̄tra mode of temple worship.Madhva maintains that the Brahman is the only independent (svatantra)entity; the world consisting of sentient beings (citorjı ̄va) and insentient (acit) objects does not have an existence independent of the Brahman (they areasvatantra). The five differences (pañcabheda) which exist between God andmatter, God and sentient beings, matter and sentient beings, between sentientbeings, and between material objects, prove the reality of multiplicity. WhileMadhva insisted on the absolute superiority of Vis.n.u on S ́iva and other deities,his works and his hagiography do not show conflicting relations with S ́aivas.Several Ma ̄dhva followers composed hymns in honor of S ́iva. Till today, someMa ̄dhva families maintain a S ́aiva domestic temple. These facts seem to confirm ancient connections of the milieu of Madhva with S ́aiva worship. His family may have belonged to a Sma ̄rta group (today known as theBha ̄gavatasamprada ̄ya) (Sharma 1960; Siauve 1968: 1–36). Other majorauthors of Dvaita are Jayatı ̄rtha (1365–88) and Vya ̄sara ̄ya (Vya ̄satı ̄rtha,1460–1539). The latter’s mastery ofs ́a ̄straswon him great fame. Called to theVijayanagar court, he may have been the preceptor (guru) of Krs.n.adevara ̄ya(Sharma 1961: 30).According to the Madhvavijaya, Madhva ordained his brother and sevenother disciples as renouncers, directing them to perform the worship of Kr.s.n.a atthe Mat.ha founded by him in Udipi. These eight ascetics established their ownlines of succession by ordination which resulted in the foundation of eightmonasteries (mat.has) in Udipi. Until today the heads of these monasteries are incharge of the worship in Kr.s.n.a Mat.ha in turn for two years each, an arrange-ment known as parya ̄ya. Other direct or later disciples are attributed with thefoundation of monasteries outside the Udipi region. The Ma ̄dhva tradition hada following mostly in the Tul.u country (today a part of Karnataka), but in theeighteenth and nineteenth centuries a rather significant number of people con-verted to the Ma ̄dhva tradition in Tamil Nadu and in Kerala, including severallocal rulers and members of the Nambudiri Brahmin community (Sharma1960; 1961; Hari Rao 1964: 133).The Harida ̄saku ̄t.a (to be distinguished from Harida ̄sasamprada ̄ya, a laternorth Indian tradition) was closely associated with the Ma ̄dhva tradition. Thesewandering devotees spread all over the Kannad.a region, held Vit.t.hala, the imageof the temple of Pandharpur (in the southern part of the present Maharashtra)as their deity. They praised devotional, moral, and renunciative values in an easynonliterary Kannad.a language which appealed to the common man. While theHarida ̄saku ̄t.a tradition is said to have started with Acala ̄nanda Vit.t.hala (ca. 888ad) and others before Madhva, the earliest known poet-saint connected with theHarida ̄saku ̄t.a is Naraharitı ̄rtha (fourteenth century), perhaps a direct disciple ofMadhva.

His date and life still remain a subject of discussion among scholars. The earliest hagiography, theA ̄ca ̄ryacarita, probably does not predate the sixteenth century. Hagiographicalaccounts locate Nimba ̄rka’s birth in various places in the Telugu country, inVrindavan or a nearby village, in a Brahmin family. His school traces Nimba ̄rka’sspiritual lineage to Vis.n.u’s incarnation as a swan, through the four spiritual sons of Brahma ̄ (Sanaka, Sananda, Sana ̄tana, and Sanatkuma ̄ra) who in turntaught Na ̄rada, whom Nimba ̄rka acknowledges as his guru. Nimba ̄rka, likeMadhva, is said not to have received his doctrine from any historical teacher. LikeMadhva again, he is said to have remained an unmarried perpetual religiousstudent.Nimba ̄rka’s main work is the Veda ̄ntapa ̄rija ̄tasaurabha, a brief commentaryon the Brahmasu ̄tras. Except this and probably the Das ́as ́lokı ̄, 10 verses whichsummarize his doctrine, the authorship of most of the works attributed to himlike the Rahasyamı ̄ma ̄m.sa ̄ of which we know two sections only (the Man-trarahasyas.od.as ́ı ̄ and the Prapannakalpavallı ̄), several hymns and severalunpublished works (R. Bose 1943: 8–12, 16) still need to be confirmed. In theVeda ̄ntapa ̄rija ̄tasaurabha, Nimba ̄rka recognizes three principles: the sentient(cit), the nonsentient (acit), and the Brahman. Their relation which is natural(sva ̄bha ̄vika) and not caused by any condition (anaupa ̄dhika) is neither of absolutenondifference (abheda), since they are distinct by nature, nor absolute differ-ence (bheda), because citandacitare inseparable from the Brahman. TheVeda ̄ntapa ̄rija ̄tasaurabha does not mention the notion ofprapattiwhich the post-Ra ̄ma ̄nuja Vis ́is.t.a ̄dvaita emphasized, but the Prapannakalpavallı ̄ describes it interms similar to those of later Vis ́is.t.a ̄dvaita. The path ofprapattior total surren-der to the Lord is open to all including S ́u ̄dras, but does not imply absence of anyeffort on the part of the surrendering devotee, for he is required to lead a life ofdevotion and service. The Mantrarahasyas.od.as ́ı ̄ advocates complete self-surrender not directly to the Lord, but to the preceptor (guru ̄pasatti) and theabandonment of all other practices (R. Bose 1943: 54–7). These two attitudesare reminiscent respectively of the Vat.akalai and Ten ̄kalai views on prapatti.There is no historical proof that Nimba ̄rka and the first 28 preceptors of thistradition settled in Braj in and around Mathura before the end of the fifteenthcentury.

This tradition developed into 12branches based in 12 monasteries. A number of subdivisions later arose, pro-gressively weakening its cohesiveness. While in its early stages, the Nimba ̄rkatradition stressed the ascetic values, however initiating lay members into its fold.Under Harivya ̄sadeva ̄ca ̄rya, lay members received the right of initiating othersand transmitting this right to their male descendants.

Vis.n.usva ̄min pre-dates Vallabha (sixteenth century) and is often said to have lived in the thirteenthcentury. Vallabhite hagiography describes him as the son of a south Indianpriest. None of his works including commentaries on Bha ̄gavatapura ̄n.a andBrahmasu ̄tras have survived. According to Ma ̄dhava’s Sarvadars ́anasam.graha(fourteenth century) the followers of Vis.n.usva ̄min’s school maintained that thebody of Nr.sim.ha (Vis.n.u’s incarnation as man–lion) is eternal.

They crystallized around the piouspersonalities, and sometimes around the devotional works of poet-saints. Theirorigin and chronology often remains uncertain. Our knowledge of these tradi-tions depends on mostly biased and anachronistic documentation. Several ofthese movements were closely associated with the then developing literature inNew Indo-Aryan (NIA) languages. Two other traditions, those of Vallabha andCaitanya, which began in the late fifteenth century, expressed their doctrinalviews and their devotion both in Sanskrit and in NIA languages.Traditions associated with New Indo-Aryan literaturesThe devotional fervor which nourished the traditions of NIA expression was in fact not so much Vais.n.avite properly speaking as Ra ̄maite and Kr.s.n.aite, thatis, directed to Ra ̄ma and Kr.s.n.a which are however aspects of Vis.n.u. The prac-tices and concepts which they valued and which since have long existed inHinduism and Buddhism converged to some extent with several similar mystictechniques and notions of Islam and Sufism: ecstatic forms of worship, collec-tive singing (bhajanandkı ̄rtan), repetition of holy names (and devotion to them),notion of divine love, etc. Other means of release were devotion to the “Goodpreceptor” (satguru) who is God in human form, and the “company of the good”(satsan.g), that is, of the poet-saints, but more generally of pious devotees. Thesocial ideology of these traditions is difficult to circumscribe. They initiallyrejected caste barriers and were indifferent or even hostile to Brahmanic learn-ing and to ritualism. They have sometimes been presented as revolutionary cur-rents but they did not specifically denounce social structures (except perhapsMaha ̄nubha ̄vas, who isolated themselves from mainstream Hinduism), nor didthey seem to have raised strong opposition from the Brahmanical side. Thefigures around whom these traditions developed were often of a humble socialorigin, yet their following belonged to all strata of society including Brahmins.Though not professing formal renunciation, they often insisted on nonviolence(ahim.sa ̄), strict vegetarianism, and sexual restraint. Similar tendencies arose insouth Indian S ́aiva milieux, as illustrated by Basava (thirteenth century) whowrote in Kannad.a and Ve ̄mana (fifteenth century) who wrote in Telugu.

Vais.n.avism fromGujarat, of which Narasim.ha Mehata ̄ (fifteenth century) is a main personality,is the subject of another chapter in the present volume.Of the two Vais.n.ava traditions of Maharashtra, the Maha ̄nubha ̄vas (orManbhaus), literally “those who have a great experience” and the Va ̄raka ̄rı ̄s,“those who perform the tour,” that is, the pilgrimage to Pandharpur, the first isprobably older. Cakradhara (thirteenth century) is said to be its founder, and hewas succeeded by Na ̄gadeva. During the leadership of Paras ́ara ̄maba ̄sa (whichbegan in the late fourteenth century), the tradition isolated itself from thecommon fold of Hinduism and divided into 13 currents (a ̄mna ̄ya), each with itsown line of initiating preceptors and particularities of doctrine and practices.Reduced to two a ̄mna ̄yasin the twentieth century, it reopened itself to thesurrounding Hinduism and revealed its scriptures which until then had beenencoded and kept secret. The Su ̄trapa ̄t.ha and the Lı ̄l.a ̄caritra, which recordCakradhara’s life and sayings, as well as the Smr.tisthal.a, which describes theactivities of Cakradhara’s followers during the time of Na ̄gadeva, all in Old Marathi and of uncertain date, are among well-known texts of theMaha ̄nubha ̄vas. The Maha ̄nubha ̄vas direct their devotion to Parames ́vara, the sole source of release who is said to have incarnated in five avata ̄rascalled“the Five Kr.s.n.as,” who are Cakradhara, his teacher, his teacher’s teacher, thegod Datta ̄treya, and the god Kr.s.n.a. Their books prescribe mental exercises ratherthan external and ritual forms of worship (seva ̄). The main religious practice isthe “recollection” (smaran.a) of the names, deeds (lı ̄l.a ̄s), and manifestations ofthe above five incarnations, a recollection stimulated by pilgrimages to placeswhich they are said to have visited and veneration of the relics of these incar-nations, including objects used or touched by them. The Maha ̄nubha ̄vas rejectedsocial categorization in terms ofvarn.asand castes and several pollution rules.This institution is divided between lay disciples and wandering renouncers(sam.nya ̄sı ̄s) initiated into ascetic life through a ceremony called bhiks.a ̄(a termwhich also conveys the ordinary meaning of begging in the Maha ̄nubha ̄vatexts). In the early period of this tradition women were eligible for this initiationas well as for instructing and initiating others (Feldhaus 1983: 3–68; Feldhausand Tulpule 1992: 3–53).The Va ̄rakarı ̄pantha is more a devotional current associated with the godVit.t.hala (or Vit.hoba ̄, also called Pa ̄n.d.uran.ga) of Pandharpur (Maharashtra) thana homogenous and organized tradition. In the eighteenth century its followersclaimed a spiritual lineage of 50 Sants (holy men) (Schomer 1987: 4). Theybelieve that Jña ̄nes ́vara (a Marathi author and saint of the end of the thirteenthcentury) established the Va ̄rakarı ̄pantha, but Na ̄madeva was probably thefounder of their movement (Vaudeville 1987b: 218, n. 9). A tailor by profes-sion, Na ̄madeva (1270 to 1350 according to tradition) could be assigned to thebeginning of the fifteenth century from the linguistic analysis of his songs. Twoother major Maharashtrian Sants, Ekana ̄tha (a Brahmin, second half of the six-teenth century) and Tuka ̄ra ̄ma (a S ́u ̄dra, 1607–49) belonged to this movement.256gérard colas"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"Ra ̄mada ̄sa (1608–81), an ascetic follower of the Va ̄rakarı ̄pantha, founded hisown tradition (the Ra ̄mada ̄sasamprada ̄ya) and became the preceptor of kingS ́iva ̄jı ̄. Va ̄rakarı ̄ Sants consider the god Vit.t.hala of Pandharpur as “father andmother” and often address him as a loving mother. According to the followersof the Va ̄rakarı ̄pantha this image of Vit.t.hala is the very form (svaru ̄pa) of Vis.n.u-Kr.s.n.a (Vaudeville 1987a: 28–9; see chapter 9).By contrast with the above Marathi poet-saints who were Vais.n.ava devotees,the “Northern Sants,” from the northwestern states of Panjab and Rajasthanand the Hindi-speaking area, are generally associated with devotion to a form-less God conceived as being beyond the three gun.asofsattva,tamas, and rajas(nirgun.abhakti) and with the notion of nonduality of the individual soul withGod. But at least three of these “Northern Sants,” Ra ̄ma ̄nanda, Da ̄du ̄, andHarida ̄sa, are considered by traditions distinctly Vais.n.ava as their founders.The most basic details of Ra ̄ma ̄nanda’s life remain unknown. Modern schol-arship tends to assign him to the fifteenth century (Pollet 1980: 142). Hagio-graphy records that he reconverted to Hinduism persons who had previouslybeen converted by force to Islam, and recruited women and intouchable castesin the tradition which bears his name and which enjoins devotion to Ra ̄ma.However, it is not even sure that he founded that tradition (Burghart 1978).Ra ̄ma ̄nanda is attributed not only with a number of poems in the vernacular butalso with several texts in Sanskrit. Most of the often undatable texts of this tra-dition are written in northern Indian languages, not in Sanskrit (Burghart1978: 121, 124–5).Special mention must be made in this context of the Bhaktama ̄la whichNa ̄bha ̄da ̄sa (or Na ̄bha ̄jı ̄) of the Ra ̄ma ̄nanda tradition composed in the latesixteenth or early seventeenth centuries (Burghart 1978: 129; Pollet 1980:142). This important text, very rich in hagiographical stories, declares thatRa ̄ma ̄nanda was the disciple of Ra ̄ghava ̄nanda, himself an indirect disciple of Ra ̄ma ̄nuja (stanza 35), a statement which remains unproven.1It also de-clares that Hari (Vis.n.u) manifested himself as four vyu ̄has in this Kaliyuga:S ́rı ̄ra ̄ma ̄nuja, Vis.n.usva ̄min, Madhva ̄ca ̄raja (=Madhva=Madhukara in stanza 29),and Nimba ̄ditya (=Nimba ̄rka), each having established a “samprada ̄ya” (28),named respectively Janma, Karma, Bha ̄gavata, and Dharma. The paddhatis(“paths”) – Rama ̄-, Tripura ̄ri-, Mukhaca ̄ri-, and Sanaka ̄dika ̄- – belong respec-tively to these four samprada ̄yas(29). Sindhuja ̄ (another name of S ́rı ̄) is calledthesamprada ̄yas ́iroman.i, the “summit of the samprada ̄ya” to which Ra ̄ma ̄nuja andothers belonged (30).

But in the early twentieth century, the Ra ̄ma ̄nandatradition no longer traced its historical origin to S ́rı ̄samprada ̄ya which corre-sponds to the tradition of Ra ̄ma ̄nuja, but designated itself as Ra ̄ma ̄nanda-samprada ̄ya (Burghart 1978: 133; Clémentin-Ojha 1999: 74).

Atthe end of eighteenth century the Ra ̄ma ̄nandı ̄ ascetics formed a militant order(akha ̄r.a ̄), gathering ascetic-warriors named na ̄ga ̄sin view of retaining or regain-ing control over several pilgrimage centers against the concurrence of Das ́ana ̄mı ̄ascetics (Burghart 1978: 126). By the nineteenth century, the tradition com-prised of several lineages (some of them consisting of ascetic-warriors like theBa ̄la ̄nandı ̄s) associated with different monasteries, of which the head bore thetitle of Mahant. Each lineage owned its own temples, villages, and territories(Clémentin-Ojha 1999: 73).Several groups arose out of the Ra ̄ma ̄nandı ̄ tradition. Two of them originatedfrom Varanasi: the Ra ̄ida ̄sı ̄ group, a religious corporation of tanners, organizedby Ra ̄ida ̄sa (or Ravida ̄sa) (fifteenth century) and the Sadhanapantha founded bya butcher named Sadhana (seventeenth century).

He probablybelonged to a family of humble origin. Having experienced several mysticalvisions in his youth, he left home in around 1562 and became an itinerantpreaching ascetic. He is said to have married and become a cotton-carder. He diedin Narain.a ̄ (near Jaipur) which continues to be the center of his tradition. TheDa ̄du ̄pantha developed soon after his death. One of Da ̄du ̄’s disciples, Rajjab, is saidto have compiled his sayings (ba ̄nı ̄), which consist of religious didactic verses anddevotional songs in Braj bha ̄s.a ̄. Another disciple, Sundarada ̄sa, composed manydevotional hymns and short religious poems in a highly Sanskritized Braj bha ̄s.a ̄.His Jña ̄nasamudra integrated a yogic heritage from the system of Gorakhana ̄thaand from the Pa ̄tañjalayoga, and was perhaps influenced by Caitanyaite theol-ogy. According to the Da ̄du ̄pantha doctrine, devotion consisting of chantingGod’s name, etc., leads to a state of union with God who is the object of devotion.In this state of nonduality, the devotee becomes fully conscious of his total depen-dance on God (da ̄satva). While Da ̄du ̄ himself converted members from all strataof society, Hindus and Muslims alike, to his way, the Da ̄du ̄pantha today onlyaccepts persons identified as twice-born. It is followed by laymen and by religiousascetics, mostly men, who are designated as viraktas. The Da ̄du ̄pantha is dividedinto two main branches, Kha ̄lsa ̄ which is attached to the center of Narain.a ̄ andto Da ̄du ̄’s immediate disciples and Uttara ̄dha ̄ which traces its lineage to those pre-ceptors of the Da ̄du ̄pantha who migrated to northern regions after Da ̄du ̄’s death.While the viraktasof the Uttara ̄dha ̄ branch sometimes exercise a profession insociety, the Kha ̄khi (“ash-smeared”) viraktas, another group of Da ̄du ̄panthaascetics, lead a life of complete renunciation. The Da ̄du ̄panthı ̄ Na ̄ga ̄s were origi-nally organized as a militant group perhaps around the mid-seventeenth century,but today consist of laymen and ascetics (Thiel-Horstmann 1983).258gérard colas"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"Harida ̄sa belongs to the sixteenth century according to modern research.

The two main subdivisions of the tradition could have originatedfrom two disciples of Harida ̄sa: the Gosva ̄mı ̄s, who are in charge of the maintemple of this tradition, claim to have descended from Jaganna ̄tha, a marriedPanjabi Brahman, while Sa ̄dhus, renouncers who practice worship in whichsinging devotional hymns (sam.kı ̄rtana) is of the utmost importance, trace theirspiritual lineage to Vı ̄t.halavipula. In the early eighteenth century, in response tothe organization of Vais.n.ava groups into four main traditions (catuh.samprada ̄ya)by Savai Jaisin.gh, the Sa ̄dhu Pı ̄ta ̄mbarada ̄sa defended the thesis that the Harida ̄satradition stemmed from the school of Nimba ̄rka, while the Gosva ̄mı ̄s claimed anaffiliation with Vis.n.usva ̄min’s school. A schism occurred between these two sub-divisions in the second quarter of the eighteenth century, after which Sa ̄dhuslived secluded in monasteries, a disposition which continued till the end of thenineteenth century. Apart from Sa ̄dhus and Gosva ̄mı ̄s, the Harida ̄sa traditionhas a following of lay people who receive varied types of initiation with dif-ferent mantras from a preceptor of either of the two groups (Haynes 1974;Rosenstein 1997).Sanskritizing traditions from the late fifteenth centuryThe fifteenth and sixteenth centuries which saw the growth of the traditions ofNIA expression also witnessed the rise of two Sanskritizing Vais.n.ava traditions,those of Vallabha and Caitanya, both closely associated with a devotion toimages perceived as the very form (svaru ̄pa) of Kr.s.n.a and with the mythology ofKr.s.n.a’s life as described in the Bha ̄gavatapura ̄n.a. These two teachers (who livedaround the same time) or their immediate disciples, identified several places in the Braj region as Gokula and as sacred sites of Vrindavan which mythol-ogy associates with Kr.s.n.a’s life. The Vallabha tradition, from the time ofVit.t.halana ̄tha, glorified the role of Ra ̄dha ̄, Kr.s.n.a’s favorite cowherd girl (gopı ̄),and Caitanya tradition (and connected traditions) stressed the worship of thedivine couple (yugala) which they formed (Barz 1992: 90–1). This mode ofworship was not new but received a great impetus during the sixteenth centuryin traditions of NIA expression (like the Harida ̄sa tradition) as well. This was alsoassociated with the revival of the Nimba ̄rka tradition (Clémentin-Ojha 1990:351–75). Both Vallabha’s and Caitanya’s traditions, like that of Madhva, gavegreat importance to the Bha ̄gavatapura ̄n.a. They held devotion superior tohistory of vais.n.ava traditions259"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"knowledge and built religious doctrines rather than scholastic philosophies onthe lines of the Vais.n.ava schools of Veda ̄nta of the tenth to thirteenth centuries.The importance which the Vais.n.ava schools of Veda ̄nta gave to devotion whichcould be practiced by all, irrespective of their social status, did not affect theirsocial conservatism. By contrast, Vallabha’s and Caitanya’s traditions whichheld the same position with regard to access to devotion had to envisageintegrating backward classes, women, and other converts in a congregation ofdevotees which implied social promiscuity.Vallabha’s tradition, called Vallabhasamprada ̄ya, consists of a doctrine, theS ́uddha ̄dvaita (“Nondualism of the pure,” that is, of S ́rı ̄kr.s.n.a-Parabrahman),and a religious path guided by it, the Pus.t.ima ̄rga. According to hagiography,Vallabha was born in 1479 in a family of Telugu Brahmans in a village on theGodavari river. He passed his childhood in Varanasi, studied Vedas, S ́a ̄stras, andPura ̄n.as and spent 19 years debating with scholars and spreading his doctrineduring pilgrimage tours. In 1493–4 he is said to have identified at Kr.s.n.a’scommand, an image on the Govardhana Hill in Braj as S ́rı ̄govardhanana ̄thajı ̄,the very form (svaru ̄pa) of S ́rı ̄kr.s.n.a whose worship became an important featureof his tradition. This image was later moved to Na ̄thadva ̄ra in Rajasthan and is now known as S ́rı ̄na ̄thajı ̄. In 1494 again, according to Vallabha himself,S ́rı ̄kr.s.n.a revealed to him the brahmasambandha(direct relation with the Brahmanwho is S ́rı ̄kr.s.n.a). This initiation is said to remove the impurities (dos.as) of thesoul, who then proceeds to worship S ́rı ̄kr.s.n.a by dedicating all actions and pos-sessions to him. According to hagiography, Vallabha, who was celibate, marriedin around 1502 under the order of the image of Vit.t.hala of Pandharpur. Histradition does not consist of ascetics and all preceptors and laymen arehouseholders. In 1531 Vallabha became a renouncer and retired to Varanasiwhere he died (Barz 1992: 16–55).Eighty-four Sanskrit works are ascribed to Vallabha, among which Subodhinı ̄and An.ubha ̄s.ya commentaries on the Bha ̄gavatapura ̄n.a and Brahmasu ̄tras, theTattva ̄rthadı ̄pa, based on the Bha ̄gavatapura ̄n.a, the S.od.as ́agrantha, 16 tractswhich discuss dedication to God and the three obstacles to it, are considered asimportant. According to Vallabha, sentient beings and insentient world are thereal manifestations of S ́rı ̄kr.s.n.a-Parabrahman. Sentient beings are nondifferentfrom S ́rı ̄kr.s.n.a in nature but do not realize it due to ignorance (avidya ̄) impartedto them by S ́rı ̄kr.s.n.a himself. Their release (uddha ̄ra) too is bestowed by the godhimself through his grace (anugraha) and out of his own free will (iccha ̄). S ́rı ̄kr.s.n.aappears in different incomplete divine “descents” (avata ̄ras) in sport (lı ̄la ̄) and outof compassion for his devotees but his only complete avata ̄rais that of S ́rı ̄kr.s.n.awho lived in Braj and whose deeds are described in the Bha ̄gavatapura ̄n.a. Theinstitutional and doctrinal connections which hagiography ascribes between histradition and that of Vis.n.usva ̄min remain uncertain (Barz 1992: 45).Vallabha’s elder son Gopı ̄na ̄tha, and later his younger son Vit.t.halana ̄tha, suc-ceeded him at the head of the organization. Vit.t.halana ̄tha (died in 1586)received several grants from Emperor Akbar, one of which was used to found anew village at Gokula near Mathura, where he settled with his family and his260gérard colas"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"followers. He delegated the guidance of the Vallabha tradition among his sevensons, each of them in charge of one or several divine images of temples in dif-ferent places in the present Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Gujarat states. Thesecharges were transmitted to further generations through the eldest male descen-dants of Vit.t.halana ̄tha’s sons. Vallabha and Vit.t.halana ̄tha initiated Muslims,women, and untouchables (Barz 1992: 47).The Vallabha tradition produced a vast literature in Sanskrit (Dasgupta 1975:373–81) and also developed a devotional literature of high quality in Braj bha ̄s.a ̄.Four disciples of Vallabha, Su ̄rada ̄sa (1483–1563, the author of the Su ̄rasa ̄gara),Kumbhanada ̄sa, Parama ̄nandada ̄sa, and Kr.s.n.ada ̄sa, and four disciples ofVit.t.halana ̄tha who wrote and sang the glory of the image of S ́rı ̄govard-hanana ̄thajı ̄, are known as the as.t.acha ̄pa. Their songs (kı ̄rtanas) form part of thedisinterested service rendered to the god, called seva ̄.Seva ̄consists of collectivepraise of the god before his image, donation of wealth to the temples of the tra-dition, and finally constant contemplation of S ́rı ̄kr.s.n.a. This form of worship ischaracteristic of Vallabha’s Pus.t.ima ̄rga, built around the notion of S ́rı ̄kr.s.n.a’sgrace. It is to be distinguished from the marya ̄da ̄ma ̄rga, considered as inferior, thatis, the conventional mode of worship such as pu ̄ja ̄and observance of scripturalinjunctions. In Pus.t.ima ̄rga, where external and mundane actions representdivine events, meditation on and physical enactment of Kr.s.n.a’s games (lı ̄la ̄s)played an important role from the time of these poets (Barz 1992: 46 sqq., 52,97–104).Vis ́vambharamis ́ra, the future Caitanya, was probably a younger contem-porary of Vallabha, but his exact dates (usually said to be 1486–1533) remainuncertain. Sanskrit and Bengali hagiographies written soon after Caitanya’sdeath provide a detailed though often unreliable picture of his life. It is said thatVis ́vambharamis ́ra, born in a Vais.n.ava Brahmin family of Navadvı ̄pa (Nadia ̄)in Bengal, grew up in a milieu in which Kamala ̄ks.a Bhat.t.a ̄ca ̄rya (also namedAdvaita ̄ca ̄rya) was influential. Kamala ̄ks.a Bhat.t.a ̄ca ̄rya was the disciple ofMa ̄dhavendra Purı ̄ who seems to have taught a S ́an.karite nondualism combinedwith devotion. Vis ́vambharamis ́ra had a traditional s ́a ̄striceducation and was ahouseholder who remarried on the death of his first wife. At the age of 22 he issaid to have received in Gaya ̄ an initiation with Kr.s.n.amantra from I ̄s ́vara Purı ̄(perhaps another disciple of Ma ̄dhavendra Purı ̄), which debuted his mystical life.On his return to Navadvı ̄pa, he organized the collective singing ofkı ̄rtanaswithmusic and ecstatic dancing. Singing processions in the city (nagarakı ̄rtana)were also organized with the agreement of the local Mohammedan authority.Possibly in 1510, Vis ́vambharamis ́ra was initiated into renunciation by Kes ́avaBha ̄ratı ̄ (perhaps an Advaitin renouncer, De 1961: 20) and received his nameS ́rı ̄kr.s.n.acaitanya, abbreviated to Caitanya. After many years of pilgrimage hesettled in Puri, but continued to visit holy places, especially Vrindavan where heis said to have identified certain sites as places connected with Kr.s.n.a’s life.Caitanya is said to have spent the rest of his life in ecstasy and in the worship of Jaganna ̄tha, the image of the main temple of Puri (De 1961: 17, 20, 30–2,67–110; Hardy 1974: 37–40).history of vais.n.ava traditions261"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"Caitanya’s affiliation with the Ma ̄dhva tradition is a late construction. His fol-lowers came to be known as Gaud.ı ̄yavais.n.avas, that is, Vais.n.avas from the Gaud.aregion (situated in present South Bengal). After his death an important groupgathered around Nitya ̄nanda, an early companion of Caitanya (and perhaps pre-viously an Avadhu ̄ta ascetic), who remained in Navadvı ̄pa. Nitya ̄nanda seemsto have accepted members of all social classes more easily than Caitanya, whoallowed equal access to worship and to the role of preceptor but held a ratherconservative view with regard to social rules. He became a householder and hadtwo wives. Another group formed in Vrindavan around six of Caitanya’s disci-ples, called Gosva ̄mins. Apart from these two main branches other smallergroups arose around several personalities and sometimes against certain teach-ers (De 1961: 13–15, 77–8, 107–9, 111 sqq., 84 n. 2; Majumdar 1969: 260–9).Caitanya did not write any work except perhaps the S ́iks.a ̄s.t.aka, a collectionof eight verses describing his intense joy of devotion to Kr.s.n.a (De 1961: 113).The Six Gosva ̄mins composed the basic scriptures of the tradition. Sana ̄tana andRu ̄pa, two brothers, and their nephew Jı ̄va, the most prolific of the three, are theauthors of main literary as well as ritual and theological works. According tothem Bhagavant, that is, S ́rı ̄kr.s.n.a, is the ultimate reality who possesses infinitepowers and creates the universe which is real and ever dependent on him. Hehas an undifferentiated aspect (Brahman) in which his powers lay in a latentform and another aspect in which he is the inner controller of all creation(Parama ̄tman). The individual soul (jı ̄va) is neither different from Bhagavant (itforms a part of him) nor nondifferent from him (it retains its individuality inrelease which can be obtained either during his lifetime or after death). Devotionto Kr.s.n.a is the sole means of release. This devotion (bha ̄va) which is ever presentin all beings is aroused by practice (sa ̄dhana) which comprises ra ̄ga ̄nuga ̄(sponta-neous attachment to God) and vaidhı ̄(practice of the injunctions of the Scrip-tures). Constant practice of devotion in all its aspects or the grace of Kr.s.n.a leadthe soul to the experience of divine love (preman). An essential feature of thedoctrine is the explication of devotion through the notion of aesthetical emo-tion (rasa) and its utilization of the terminology of Sanskrit poetics (De 1961:166–244).The other three Gosva ̄mins are Raghuna ̄tha Bhat.t.a, Raghuna ̄thada ̄sa, andGopa ̄la Bhat.t.a. No work of Raghuna ̄tha Bhat.t.a is extant. Raghuna ̄thada ̄sa com-posed devotional hymns imbued with mysticism expressed in an erotic fashionand centered on the worship of the couple Ra ̄dha ̄-Kr.s.n.a. The well-knownHaribhaktivila ̄sa is attributed (though with some uncertainty) to Gopa ̄la Bhat.t.a(Joshi 1959). It codifies the behavioral and ritual rules of the Caitanya tradition,is influenced by Pura ̄n.ic, Pa ̄ñcara ̄tra, and Tantric texts. Its prescriptions includethe possibility of also initiating Can.d.a ̄las, but with Tantric mantras (De 1961:454). Besides doctrinal and ritual texts, the Caitanya tradition produced a largequantity of Sanskrit poems, dramas, and biographical works. Its early literaturealso comprised devotional songs in Bengali. Caitanya directly or indirectlyinspired a number of traditions, the most important being the Ra ̄dha ̄vallabhı ̄sand the Sahajiya ̄s.262gérard colas"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"Little is known about Hitaharivam.s ́a (1502–52) and the tradition of theRa ̄dha ̄vallabhı ̄s (mentioned in Na ̄bha ̄da ̄sa’s Bhaktama ̄la) which claims him as itsfounder. Hagiography describes him as born in a rich family near Mathura. Heis said to have settled in Vrindavan at the age of 32 where he founded theRa ̄dha ̄vallabha tradition. The Ra ̄dha ̄sudha ̄nidhi in Sanskrit and two Hindi worksare attributed to him. On his death, his son Kr.s.n.ada ̄sa (probably born in 1531)became the head of the organization. He constructed a temple for the image ofRa ̄dha ̄vallabha which had been discovered by Hitaharivam.s ́a, and the worshipof this image formed one of the features of this tradition. This temple wasdestroyed by Aurangzeb (Shukla 1971: 21–2). Works attributed to Kr.s.n.ada ̄sareveal a strong influence of the Caitanya tradition, especially of Ru ̄pa Gosva ̄min.They consist of a Pada ̄vali in Braj bha ̄s.a ̄and 13 Sanskrit texts, several of whichwere commented upon in Braj bha ̄s.a ̄by later authors. His Karn.a ̄nanda, a poemon the sports of Ra ̄dha ̄ and Kr.s.n.a, with his own commentary is his main work(Shukla 1971: 22–3, 68–91). The works of Hitaharivam.s ́a and Kr.s.n.ada ̄sa showno interest in religious practices or philosophical discussions. Their main themeis the constant and eternal union of Ra ̄dha ̄ and Kr.s.n.a. The contemplation of thisunion by the individual soul who is said to be the female friend (sakhı ̄) of Ra ̄dha ̄,gives rise to an emotion of joy (hita) which forms the aim of devotion to Ra ̄dha ̄and Krs.n.a and is considered as release (Shukla 1971: 24 sqq.). The Sakhı ̄bha ̄vagroup, where men dressed and behaved like Ra ̄dha ̄’s female friends, may havebeen a branch of the Ra ̄dha ̄vallabha tradition (Renou 1985a: 647).The links of the Bengali Vais.n.ava Sahajiya ̄ (from sahaja, “innate,” “natural”)tradition with the Buddhist Sahajiya ̄ tradition (which flourished in Bengal atleast three centuries before Caitanya) are uncertain. Though modern scholar-ship does not rule out a Sahajiya ̄ influence on Caitanya himself (through hisdirect disciples Ra ̄ma ̄nanda Ra ̄ya, Nitya ̄nanda, and Jahnavı ̄, Nitya ̄nanda’s wife,who are said to have been Sahajiya ̄s) (Dimock 1966: 46–55), it seems more prob-able that the Caitanya tradition influenced Sahajiya ̄s.Sahajiya ̄ followers had no regard for Vedic texts, but accepted texts written byVa i s.n.ava authors (Dimock 1966: 185–6). The Vais.n.ava Sahajiya ̄ tradition pro-duced a vast amount of literature often kept secret by its followers (M. M. Bose1930: 261–302). It contains a great number of lyric songs, the date of whichmodern scholarship has not yet fixed. Its Tantras (of which 79 titles are known)were written in Bengali, in an obscure and coded language (sandha ̄-bha ̄s.a ̄),between the early seventeenth and nineteenth centuries (Dimock 1966: 38,124; Gupta 1981: 177, 201). They adopted the Caitanya theology besides theirown views. Sahajiya ̄s considered Caitanya as the teacher of their doctrine andbelieved he was incarnated as both Ra ̄dha ̄ and Kr.s.n.a in a single body. Besides theconventional mode of devotion, they prescribed mystic worship in order torealize the divine presence of Ra ̄dha ̄ and Kr.s.n.a and their union in one’s own self(Dimock 1966: 228). Their mystical physiology, influenced by Tantric traditions,insisted on the role of chastity and the control ofrasa (semen) (Dimock 1966:157) in a spiritual progress which is said to be divided into three stages. Duringthe first stage the adept learns certain mantras from an initiating preceptor andhistory of vais.n.ava traditions263"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"conducts such practices as the repetition of Kr.s.n.a’s names. The second stageinvolves ritualized copulation with meditation on the divine couple. In the thirdstage the adept, transcending all physical desires, experiences the eternal divineunion of Ra ̄dha ̄ and Krs.n.a which is pure bliss (M. M. Bose 1930, passim; Dimock1966: 124–248). Though it had no consideration for orthodox social concep-tions and believed in the personal evaluation of moral principles, the Sahajiya ̄tradition with its esoteric rituals conducted in secrecy did not enter into conflictwith society (Dimock 1966: 105, 121). The Sahajiya ̄ tradition is said to nolonger exist, but the possibility of its continuation in contemporary India isevoked (Dimock 1966: 249).Other minor movements inspired by the Caitanya tradition remain less wellknown due to a lack of documentation. Karta ̄bha ̄ja ̄s recognized Karta ̄ba ̄ba ̄(end of the eighteenth century) of Navadvı ̄pa and his descendants as their onlydeity. The Spas.t.ada ̄yakas, followers of Ru ̄para ̄ma Kabira ̄ja, lived in celibacy inmonasteries which gathered men and women (Renou 1985a: 646–7). A groupof Vais.n.avas of Orissa, called the pañcasakha ̄s, “the five friends,” who worshippedthe formless Kr.s.n.a, are also said to have been followers of Caitanya (Majumdar1969: 240; Mukherjee 1978: 313–14).Except Vallabha’s, Caitanya’s, and related traditions, mention must also bemade of S ́an.karadeva (1449–1548). The tradition which claims him as itsfounder was independent from the Caitanya tradition though seventeenth-century hagiography mentions a meeting of both the religious leaders. Itremained confined mostly to Assam. Twenty-seven works, written in Sanskritand Assamese, are attributed to S ́an.karadeva. Among them six plays (calledna ̄t.as,na ̄t.akas, and ya ̄tra ̄s) still extant show that the extensive use of dramaticperformances was from the beginning a main feature of his tradition. His teach-ings were based on devotion as explained in the Bha ̄gavatapura ̄n.a. He and his first disciple, Ma ̄dhava, a main propagandist of the tradition, were ka ̄yasthas.S ́an.karadeva’s granddaughters and great-granddaughters played an importantrole in the creation of its monasteries, called sattras, where monks and marrieddevotees lived in separate quarters. Soon after S ́an.karadeva’s death the tradi-tion subdivided into several currents; the four main ones are usually countedBrahma-, Nika ̄-, Purus.a-, and Ka ̄la-sam.hatis. The ceremony of conversion to thistradition is called s ́aran.a. The main object of worship is a book (normally theBha ̄gavatapura ̄n.a) while the use of images is not strictly forbidden. Objects usedby the gurus of the tradition are also worshipped (Neog 1965).Late Vais.n.ava TantrasApart from Pa ̄ñcara ̄tra texts, several Tantric works were of special importancefor the different Vais.n.ava traditions. The Ra ̄ma ̄nanda tradition favored the use ofseveral texts, like an Agastyasam.hita ̄ (different from the Pa ̄ñcara ̄tra text of thesame title and probably from the twelfth century) for their worship of Ra ̄ma. The264gérard colas"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"sixteenth-century Caitanya texts quote the Gautamı ̄yatantra as their authority.Later tantras like the I ̄s ́a ̄nasam.hita ̄ and the U ̄rdhva ̄mna ̄yasam.hita ̄ either mention Gaura ̄n.ga, that is, Caitanya, or promote him as the main object ofworship (Goudriaan 1981: 105 sqq.). Several ritual Tantric texts, tentativelycalled “Ka ̄lı ̄-Vis.n.u Tantras,” like the Ka ̄lı ̄vila ̄satantra, the Utpattitantra, theKa ̄madhenutantra, tried integrating Vais.n.avism into S ́a ̄ktism by claiming Kr.s.n.ato be a son of Ka ̄lı ̄. They seem to be associated with the Vais.n.ava revival whicharose in northeastern India from the sixteenth century onwards (Goudriaan1981: 82–4).Late Modern and Contemporary Vais.n.ava Traditions and GroupsNew Vais.n.ava movements developed in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.The Sva ̄mina ̄ra ̄yan.a tradition (nineteenth century) from Gujarat promoted bothsocial and religious reforms. The Assamese reformist movements that arose inthe 1930s, like the Haridhaniyas (or Nama Kirtaniyas), the Maha ̄kı ̄yas, etc., mayalso be mentioned in this context (Cantlie 1985). At the end of the nineteenthcentury, Bengal saw a revival of Vais.n.avism inspired by the Caitanya devotionalcurrent. While reformist movements like Bra ̄hmo Sama ̄j and A ̄rya Sama ̄j scornedthis tradition, several historical personalities illustrate the opposite tendency. Forinstance, Bijoy Krishna Goswami (born in 1841), previously an ardent and influ-ential missionary of the Bra ̄hmo Sama ̄j, left it in 1889 and became a follower ofCaitanya. He had several disciples like Bipincandra Pa ̄l whom he initiated, butdid not found any organized movement (Jones 1989: 39–41; Lipski 1971). Byconstrast, Keda ̄rna ̄th Datt (1838–1914) founded a branch of the Caitanya tra-dition, the International Society for Kr.s.n.a Consciousness, which spread outsideIndia and is popularly known as Hare Kr.s.n.a movement. Serving as a magistratein the British Government, in 1868 he discovered the Caitanya tradition intowhich he had been born and subsequently wrote and edited around a hundredbooks on the subject. He took the Vais.n.avasam.nya ̄sinJaganna ̄tha Da ̄sa Ba ̄ba ̄jı ̄ ashis master and received the name of Bhaktivinoda T.ha ̄kura from the Gaud.ı ̄yaGosva ̄mı ̄s in 1887. In the same year he established a printing press in Calcuttato help circulate Vais.n.ava texts. He was initiated as a renunciate in 1908. Hisson Bhaktisiddha ̄nta Sarasvatı ̄ succeeded him at his death in 1914. He reestab-lished the use of the sacred thread in the tradition (which his father had abol-ished) as a symbol of “real brahminhood” for every initiate irrespective of hiscaste or origin. A. C. Bhaktiveda ̄nta Sva ̄mı ̄, who succeeded Bhaktisiddha ̄nta in1937, aimed at spreading the message of Caitanya among English-speakingpeople and undertook a translation of the Bha ̄gavatapura ̄n.a. Having become arenouncer in 1959, he visited New York in 1965 at the age of 70 and died in1977 (Hopkins 1984, passim).history of vais.n.ava traditions265"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"ConclusionVa i s.n.ava traditions did not develop in themselves and by themselves. They wereunder constant pressure from political and socioeconomic powers which con-siderably influenced them as protectors, as in the case of the early Bha ̄gavatatradition, but sometimes also as controllers. For instance, the fortunes of rivalS ́rı ̄vais.n.ava tendencies may have varied according to the support of Vijayanagarkings (Appadurai 1977). Another illustration is the political instrumentalizationof the notion ofcatuh.samprada ̄ya(“fourfold tradition” of Vais.n.avism which refersto the traditions of Ra ̄ma ̄nuja, Vis.n.usva ̄min, Nimba ̄rka, and Madhva) by therulers of Rajasthan in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (Clémentin-Ojha1999).The perception of Vais.n.avism as a single religion with an homogenous devel-opment can only be an ideal view. The notion of Vais.n.avism partly corroboratedby comparatively late Indian doxographies and adopted by modern scholarship,corresponds in fact to the aggregation of a multitude of varied traditions. Theabove overview shows the successive rise of Vais.n.ava traditions (and sometimes,their reappearance in another form) and their multiple aspects. This is becausethese traditions had to cater for a variety of human needs in terms of devotion,rituals, doctrine, and these furthermore towards a chosen divine aspect. Again,our comprehension of Vais.n.avism according to its successive tendencies dependson extant historical evidence which project to forefront merely fragmented andcrystallized images of Vais.n.ava traditions. This should not hide the fact that suchtrends as asceticism, devotion, image worship probably coexisted at the sametime in Vais.n.avism, though the texts do not give them equal importance.Only critical research can disentangle a historical perspective from textualviews. A comprehensive study of the multifarious and often biaised descriptionsand classifications of Vais.n.ava traditions in Vais.n.ava Sanskrit and vernaculartexts, as well as a complete historical study of such vital themes as the notion ofguruor of initiation in the different Vais.n.ava traditions, are required. A method-ical evaluation of the influence of these traditions on each other and on othertraditions, as well as that of the non-Vais.n.ava traditions on Vais.n.ava traditions,would help to locate them more precisely in Indian religions.More or less institutionalized traditions form only a part of religious culture.These structures which we tried to circumscribe are, so to say, superficial. Largersocioreligious realities in fact nourish them: patrons and devotees form the coreof historical Vais.n.avism.

The cultural institution behind these modernmanifestations, an institution which we have chosen to call the “renouncer tra-dition,” is very old. It goes back to about the middle of the first millennium bceand took shape along the mid-Gangetic plane in roughly what is today the stateof Bihar.The image of Indian religion as essentially world-renouncing and ascetic(Dumont 1960), however, is grossly inaccurate. Yet, behind that image lies akernel of truth: the renouncer tradition has been a central and important ingre-dient in the sociocultural mix that contributed to the formation of the historicalreligions in India. As any human institution, nevertheless, that kernel and theIndian religions themselves changed over time and space.The earliest historical information about the renouncer tradition comes fromthe Upanis.ads and other vedic writings, as well as from Buddhist literary sources.Given the uncertainly of their dates, however, it is impossible to give a precise orcertain date to the origin of that tradition: hence, my vague reference to “themiddle of the first millennium bce.” The earliest datable source that attests to theexistence of the renouncer tradition is the As ́okan inscriptions of the middle ofthe third century bce. Around this time, if I may be permitted to generalize, twocompeting ascetic traditions appear to have crystallized: anchoritesliving settledlives in forest hermitages cut off from social intercourse, and renouncerslivingitinerant lives in the wilderness but in interaction with towns and villages fromwhich they begged their food.An ancient Brahmanical law book describes the normative lifestyle ofanchorites:"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"An anchorite shall live in the forest, living on roots and fruits and given toausterities. He kindles the sacred fire according to the procedure for recluses and refrains from eating what is grown in a village. He may also avail himself ofthe flesh of animals killed by predators. He should not step on plowed land or entera village. He shall wear matted hair and clothes of bark or skin and never eat anything that has been stored for more than a year. (Gautama Dharmasu ̄tra,3.26–35)The anchorite’s life is marked by his refusal to avail himself of any product medi-ated by human culture. His clothing and food come from the wild; he is not per-mitted to step on plowed land, the symbol of human culture and society. Theanchorite has physically withdrawn from society, even though he continues toparticipate in some of the central religious activities of society, such as main-taining a ritual fire and performing rituals. At least some of the anchorites mayhave lived in family units; we hear often of wives and children living in foresthermitages.The renouncer, on the other hand, lives in proximity to civilized society andin close interaction with it.A mendicant shall live without any possessions, be chaste, and remain in one placeduring the rainy season. Let him enter a village only to obtain almsfood and go onhis begging round late in the evening, without visiting the same house twice andwithout pronouncing blessings. He shall control his speech, sight, and actions; andwear a garment to cover his private parts, using, according to some, a discardedpiece of cloth after washing it. Outside the rainy season, he should not spend twonights in the same village. He shall be shaven-headed or wear a topknot; refrainfrom injuring seeds; treat all creatures alike, whether they cause him harm or treathim with kindness; and not undertake ritual activities. (Gautama Dharmasu ̄tra,3.11–25)The renouncer’s withdrawal from society is not physical but ideological. He doesnot participate in the most central of socioreligious institutions: family and sex,ritual fire and ritual activities, a permanent residence, and wealth and economicactivities. He is a religious beggar, depending on social charity for his most basicneeds.Of these two ascetic institutions, the one that became central to the develop-ment of Indian religions and cultures was the renouncer tradition. The hermitculture became obsolete at least by the beginning of the common era and livedon only in poetic imagination; some of the most beloved of Indian poetry anddrama, including the two great epics, Ra ̄ma ̄yan.aandMa ̄ha ̄bha ̄rata, center aroundhermit life in the forest. S ́akuntala ̄, the famous Indian heroine immortalized bythe Sanskrit playwright Ka ̄lida ̄sa, was a girl living in a forest hermitage. But ithad little historical influence on Indian religion.272patrick olivelle"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"The OriginsThere is a longstanding and ongoing scholarly debate regarding the origin of therenouncer tradition. To simplify a somewhat intricate issue, some contend thatthe origins of Indian asceticism in general and of the renouncer tradition in par-ticular go back to the indigenous non-Aryan population (Bronkhorst 1993,Pande 1978, Singh 1972). Others, on the contrary, see it as an organic andlogical development of ideas found in the vedic religious culture (Heesterman1964).It is time, I think, to move beyond this sterile debate and artificial dichotomy.They are based, on the one hand, on the false premise that the extant vedic textsprovide us with an adequate picture of the religious and cultural life of thatperiod spanning over half a millennium. These texts, on the contrary, provideonly a tiny window into this period, and that too only throws light on what theirpriestly authors thought it important to record. It is based, on the other hand,on the untenable conviction that we can isolate Aryan and non-Aryan strandsin the Indian culture a millennium or more removed from the original and puta-tive Aryan migrations. It is obvious that the ancient Indian society comprisednumerous racial, ethnic, and linguistic groups and that their beliefs and prac-tices must have influenced the development of Indian religions. It is quite a dif-ferent matter, however, to attempt to isolate these different strands at any givenpoint in Indian history (Olivelle 1993, 1995b).It is a much more profitable exercise to study the social, economic, political,and geographical factors along the Gangetic valley during the middle of the firstmillenniumbcethat may have contributed to the growth of ascetic institutionsand ideologies (Olivelle 1993, Gombrich 1988). This was a time of radical socialand economic change, a period that saw the second urbanization in India – afterthe initial one over a millennium earlier in the Indus Valley – with large king-doms, state formation, a surplus economy, and long-distance trade. Ambition,strategy, drive, and risk-taking all played a role in both a king’s quest for powerand a merchant’s pursuit of wealth. A similar spirit of individual enterprise isevident in a person’s decision to leave home and family and to become a wan-dering mendicant. The new social and economic realities of this period surelypermitted and even fostered the rise of rival religious ideologies and modes of life.The Formative Period of Indian ReligionsThe second half of the first millennium bcewas the period that created many ofthe ideological and institutional elements that characterize later Indian reli-gions. The renouncer tradition played a central role during this formative periodof Indian religious history.the renouncer tradition273"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"Renouncers often formed groups around prominent and charismatic asceticleaders, groups that often developed into major religious organizations. Some ofthem, such as Buddhism and Jainism, survived as major religions; others, suchas the A ̄jı ̄vakas, existed for many centuries before disappearing. Renunciationwas at the heart of these religions.Even though the ideal of homeless wandering is often maintained as atheological fiction, many of these renouncer groups, such as the Buddhist andthe Jain, organized themselves into monastic communities with at least a semi-permanent residence. These communities vied with each other to attract laymembers, donors and benefactors, and for political patronage.A significant feature of these celibate communities is that they werevoluntary organizations, the first such religious organizations perhaps in theentire world, and their continued existence depended on attracting newmembers. Another was the admission, at least in some traditions such as the Buddhist and the Jain, of women and the creation of female monasticcommunities. If voluntary celibate communities that rejected marriage wereremarkable even for men, they must certainly have been revolutionary in thecase of women.The influence of renouncer practices and ideologies was not limited to whatwe have come to regard as non-Hindu or “heterodox” traditions; their influencecan be seen within the Brahmanical tradition itself. Indeed, during this earlyperiod of Indian history the very division into “orthodox” and “heterodox” isanachronistic and presents a distorted historical picture. Scholars in the pasthave argued that some of the changes within the Brahmanical tradition, suchas the creation of the a ̄s ́rama(orders of life) system, was instituted as a defensemechanism against the onslaught of renunciation. Evidence does not supportsuch claims. The Brahmanical tradition was not a monolithic entity. Thedebates, controversies, and struggles between the new ideologies and lifestylesof renunciation and the older ritualistic religion took place as much within theBrahmanical tradition as between it and the new religions (Olivelle 1993). Thisstruggle created new institutions and ideas within that tradition, the a ̄s ́ramasystem being one of the more remarkable and enduring.Some of the fundamental values and beliefs that we generally associate withIndian religions in general and Hinduism in particular were at least in part thecreation of the renouncer tradition. These include the two pillars of Indiantheologies: sam.sa ̄ra– the belief that life in this world is one of suffering andsubject to repeated deaths and births (rebirth); moks.a/nirva ̄n.a– the goal ofhuman existence and, therefore, of the religious quest is the search for liberationfrom that life of suffering. All later Indian religious traditions and sects arefundamentally ideologies that map the processes of Sam.sa ̄ra and Moks.a andtechnologies that provide humans the tools for escaping sam.sa ̄ric existence. Suchtechnologies include different forms of yoga and meditation. An offshoot ofthese ideologies and technologies is the profound antiritualism evident in mostlater traditions. In the areas of ethics and values, moreover, renunciation wasprincipally responsible for the ideals of non-injury (ahim.sa ̄) and vegetarianism.274patrick olivelle"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"Several of the renouncer movements that turned into major religions werefounded by people who had renounced the world, Gautama Buddha and the JinaMaha ̄vı ̄ra in the case of Buddhism and Jainism. Within these religions themonastic communities are at the center of both theology and ecclesiasticalstructure.Within the Brahmanical tradition, on the other hand, the situation was morecomplex. In the old vedic religion, the Brahmin was the ritual specialist andreligious leader, but these very functions required that he get married and fatherchildren, activities diametrically opposed to renunciation. We will examinediverse attempts to integrate the ideals of these two poles of the tradition at boththe institutional and the theological levels. The tension between the two idealsof religious living, however, continued to exist throughout the history of theBrahmanical and Hindu traditions.Values in ConflictThe debate on the conflicting value systems of renunciation and the society-oriental vedic religion is recorded in many early texts and revolved especiallyaround the male obligation to marry, father offspring, and carry out ritualduties. These obligations were given theological expression in a novel doctrine,probably the result of that very debate on values. The “doctrine of debts” positedthat a man is born with three debts – to gods, ancestors, and vedic seers – debtsfrom which one can be freed only by offering sacrifices, begetting offspring, and studying the Vedas. An ancient text waxes eloquent on the importance of ason, who is viewed as the continuation of the father and the guarantor of hisimmortality:A debt he pays in him,And immortality he gains,The father who sees the faceOf his son born and alive.Greater than the delightsThat earth, fire, and waterBring to living beings,Is a father’s delight in his son.(Aitareya Bra ̄hman.a, 7.13)And in what appears to be a dig at ascetic claims, the same text continues:What is the use of dirt and deer skin?What profit in beard and austerity?Seek a son, O Brahmin,He is the world free of blame.the renouncer tradition275"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"The proponents of ascetic and renunciatory values, on the other hand,dismiss these claims for sons and rituals. Their view of immortality and libera-tion is centered not on outward activities but on inward self-cultivation. Sons,sacrifices, and riches only guarantee the return to a new life of suffering withinthe wheel of sam.sa ̄ra. An Upanis.ad comments on the futility of sacrifices:Surely, they are floating unanchored,these eighteen forms of the sacrifice,the rites within which are called inferior;The fools who hail that as the best,return once more to old age and death.(Mun.d.aka Upanis.ad, 1.2)The Upanis.ads also devalue the importance of marriage and progeny:This immense, unborn self is none other than the one consisting of perception hereamong the vital functions. It is when they desire him as their world that wander-ing ascetics undertake the ascetic life of wandering. It was when they knew thisthat men of old did not desire offspring, reasoning “Ours is this self, and it is ourworld. What then is the use of offspring for us?” (Br.hada ̄ran.yaka Upanis.ad, 4.4.22)This conflict in values and ideologies is often presented as a contrast betweenvillage and wilderness, the normative geographical spaces of society and renun-ciation. People inhabiting these spaces are destined to vastly different paths afterdeath, the villagers returning back to the misery of earthly existence andascetics proceeding to immortality:Now, the people who know this, and the people here in the wilderness who ven-erate thus: “Austerity is faith” – they pass into the flame, from the flame into theday, from the day into the fortnight of the waxing moon, from the fortnight of thewaxing moon into the six months when the sun moves north, from these monthsinto the year, from the year into the sun, from the sun into the moon, and from themoon into lightning. Then a person who is not human – he leads them to brahman.This is the path leading to the gods.The people here in villages, on the other hand, who venerate thus: “Gift-givingis offerings to gods and to priests” – they pass into the smoke, from the smoke intothe night, from the night into the fortnight of the waning moon, and from the fort-night of the waning moon into the six months when the sun moves south. Thesedo not reach the year but from these months pass into the world of the fathers,and from the world of the fathers into space, and from space into the moon.

Created probably aroundthe fourth century bce, the system in its original form proposed four alternatemodes of religious living that young adults could pursue after they had com-pleted their period of temporary studentship following vedic initiation. Thesewere: continuing to be a student until death, getting married and setting up ahousehold, withdrawing to the forest as a hermit, or becoming a renouncer(Olivelle 1993). This system, first recorded in the early Dharmasu ̄tras composedbetween the second and third centuries bce, envisaged a free choice among thea ̄s ́ramas, which were viewed as permanent and lifelong vocations. Here is one ofthe oldest descriptions of the a ̄s ́ramas:There are four orders of life: the householder’s life, living at the teacher’s house,the life of a sage, and that of a forest hermit. If a man remains steadfast in any ofthese, he attains bliss. A common prerequisite for all is to live at the teacher’s housefollowing one’s initiation, and all are required not to abandon vedic learning. Afterhe has learnt the rites, he may undertake the order that he prefers.Following the rules of a novice student, a student should serve his teacher untildeath, leaving his body in his teacher’s house.Next, the wandering ascetic. From that very state, remaining chaste, he goesforth. With regard to him they admonish: “He should live as a silent sage, withoutfire or house, without shelter or protection.” Speaking only when he is engaged inprivate vedic recitation and obtaining food from a village to sustain himself, heshould live without any concern for this world or the next. Discarded clothes areprescribed for him. Some say that he should go completely naked. Abandoningtruth and falsehood, pleasure and pain, the Vedas, this world and the next, heshould seek the Self. When he gains insight, he attains bliss.Next, the forest hermit. From that very state, remaining chaste, he goes forth.With regard to him they admonish: “He should live as a silent sage with a singlefire, but without house, shelter, or protection.” Let him speak only when he isengaged in private vedic recitation. Clothes made of materials from the wild areprescribed for him. (A ̄pastamba Dharmasu ̄tra, 2.21.1–22. 1)The term a ̄s ́ramais somewhat new in the Sanskrit vocabulary and was prob-ably coined to express a new reality. Contrary to the common perception, theterm did not refer to ascetic habitats or modes of life, if by “ascetic” we under-stand values and institutions that oppose Brahmanical values centered aroundthe householder. On the contrary, a ̄s ́ramais a fundamentally Brahmanicalthe renouncer tradition277"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"concept and is absent outside Brahmanical discourse. It referred originally tohabitats and life styles of exceptional Brahmins living apart from society anddevoted solely to austerities and rituals.The creators of the a ̄s ́ramasystem took this term and concept and extendedit to all the legitimate modes of life, especially to celibate asceticism. Evidencedoes not support the common assumption that the system was created by con-servative Brahmins with the intention of resisting the new religious movementsand of safeguarding Brahmanical religion by incorporating the renunciatorylifestyle into a scheme that would lessen its impact and reduce or eliminate theconflict between it and the life of the householder. Elements of such a motivemay be detected in the later “classical” form of the system I will discuss below.But the original system gives equal weight to all a ̄s ́ramasand, quite contrary to the normal Brahmanical attitude, gives the candidates total freedom ofchoice among the competing modes of life. Permitting choice, indeed, placedrenunciation and celibacy on an equal footing with household life. The authorsof the system in all likelihood came from the antiritualistic tradition withinBrahmanism, a tradition that finds expression in some of the Upanis.ads. In lightof the socioeconomic conditions of northern India during this time with possi-bly the beginning of the Maurya empire, I am inclined to believe that the a ̄s ́ramasystem was an urban invention, or at least reflects the openness of an urbanmentality. This is reflected in the very nature of the original a ̄s ́ramasystem. Itenvisaged the a ̄s ́ramasas voluntary institutions. People are free to choose whatthey want to be as adults. The same principle was the basis of other voluntaryorganizations of the time, such as Buddhist and Jain monastic orders.This novel proposal did not go unchallenged. Indeed, some of the earliestsources that record the a ̄s ́ramasystem present it as an opponent’s view that is tobe rejected. One important argument used against the a ̄s ́ramasystem was thetheology of the three debts. The obligation to father offspring is clearly stated inthe authoritative texts of the Veda. This injunction contradicts the central pro-vision of the a ̄s ́ramasystem permitting a man to become a celibate renouncerprior to marriage.By the beginning of the common era, however, the a ̄s ́ramasystem underwentdrastic changes that culminated in its classical formulation. The a ̄s ́ramasare nowenvisaged not as alternate modes of life but as stages an individual goes throughas he grows old. The first a ̄s ́ramain the new scheme is identified with thetemporary period of study following vedic initiation. After completing this stage,a young adult got married and raised a family; this is the second a ̄s ́rama. Whenthe householder had settled his children, he withdrew into the forest as a hermit.After a period of time in this stage, the man became a renouncer during the finalyears of his life. Here a ̄s ́ramasare temporary modes of life corresponding to dif-ferent age groups, and choice is eliminated. This formulation reasserts the cen-trality of the householder; the productive years of an adult’s life are spent as aneconomically productive head of a household. The classical formulation alsoavoided the problems posed by the theology of debts. In the new system a manonly took to renunciation and celibacy after he had fulfilled his obligations to get278patrick olivelle"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"married, beget offspring, and offer sacrifices. In effect, the classical a ̄s ́ramasystem transformed renunciation from a life’s calling into an institution of oldage, a form of retirement.Both these formulations of the system contained aspects of artificiality. Theyanswered to the requirements of theological and legal minds demanding order;they did not reflect the usually chaotic reality of social or religious institutions.In the original system the choice ofa ̄s ́ramaswas limited to a single moment ofa young adult’s life; in reality, as we know from numerous contemporarysources, married people did leave their families and became renouncers. Theclassical system limited renunciation to old age; in reality people of all agesbecame renouncers. In time riders were attached to the classical system permit-ting individuals with extraordinary zeal and detachment to become renouncersearly in life.Attempts to blunt the opposition between domesticity and celibate asceticismwere at best only partially successful. Proponents of asceticism objected espe-cially to the fact that the grand compromise of the a ̄s ́ramasystem relegatedasceticism to old age, equating it thereby with retirement. The urgency of per-sonal salvation could not brook such postponement. An example comes from aLife of the Buddha written in the first century ceby As ́vaghos.a, a Brahmin whoconverted to Buddhism and became a Buddhist monk. Although the setting isformally Buddhist, the dialogue between the future Buddha and his father,Suddhodana, captures the controversy both within and outside the Brahmanicalmainstream regarding the proper age for becoming an ascetic. When the futureBuddha informs his father of his intention to leave the world, Suddhodana tellshim:Give up this plan, dear child; the time is not right for you to devote yourself toreligion (dharma). For in the first period of life, when the mind is unsteady, thepractice of religion, they say, can cause great harm.His senses easily excited by sensual pleasures, a young man is incapable ofremaining steadfast when confronted with the hardships of ascetic vows. So hismind recoils from the wilderness, especially because he is unaccustomed tosolitude.The future Buddha replies:I will not enter the penance grove, O king, if you will be the surety for me infour things. My life shall not be subject to death. Sickness shall not rob me of myhealth. Old age shall not strike down my youth. And misfortune shall neverplunder my wealth.Given that separation is certain in this world, is it not better to separate oneselfvoluntarily for the sake of religion? Or should I wait for death to separate meforcibly even before I have reached my goal and attained satisfaction. (As ́vaghos.a,Buddhacarita, tr. E. H. Johnston, 5.30–8; selections)The rejection of the compromise proposed in the classical a ̄s ́rama s ́system ispresented vividly also in a conversation recorded in the Maha ̄bha ̄rata (12.169:the renouncer tradition279"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"selections) between a father, the guardian of the old order, and his son, repre-senting the troubled and anguished spirit of the new religious world. This story,appearing as it does in Jain (Uttara ̄dhyayana, 14) and Buddhist (Ja ̄taka, 509), andlater Brahmanical (Markan.d.eya Pura ̄n.a, ch. 10) texts as well, probably belongedto the generic ascetic folklore before it was incorporated into the Maha ̄bha ̄rata.This text, just like the story of the Buddha, points to the ascetic rejection ofsocietal attempts to convert asceticism into an institution of old age. To the son’squestion regarding how a person should lead a virtuous life, the father replies:First, learn the Vedas, son, by living as a Vedic student. Then you should desiresons to purify your forefathers, establish the sacred fires, and offer sacrifices. There-after, you may enter the forest and seek to become an ascetic.The son retorts:When the world is thus afflicted and surrounded on all sides, when spears raindown, why do you pretend to speak like a wise man?The world is afflicted by death. It is surrounded by old age. These days and nightsrain down. Why can’t you understand?When I know that death never rests, how can I wait, when I am caught in a net.This very day do what’s good. Let not this moment pass you by, for surely deathmay strike you even before your duties are done.Tomorrow’s task today perform. Evening’s work finish before noon, for deathdoes not wait to ask whether your duties are done.For who knows whom death’s legions may seize today. Practice good from youryouth, for uncertain is life’s erratic path.The delight one finds in living in a village is truly the house of death, while thewilderness is the dwelling place of the gods – so the Vedas teach.The delight one finds in living in a village is the rope that binds. The virtuouscut it and depart, while evil-doers are unable to cut it.In the self alone and by the self I am born, on the self I stand, and, though child-less, in the self alone I shall come into being; I will not be saved by a child of mine.The text concludes:Of what use is wealth to you, 0 Brahmin, you who must soon die. Of what useare even wife and relatives. Seek the self that has entered the cave. Where haveyour father and grandfather gone? (Translation from Winternitz 1923)Textual TraditionsRenouncer groups both within and outside the Brahmanical tradition developedtheir own literature, especially texts that dealt with their modes of life and rulesof conduct. The Buddhist and Jain textual traditions are well known. WithinBrahmanism itself we have evidence of renouncer texts. The fourth century bce280patrick olivelle"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"grammarian Pa ̄n.ini (4.3.110–11), for example, mentions the Bhiks.usu ̄tras com-posed by Pa ̄ra ̄s ́arya and Karmandin. The Baudha ̄yana Dharmasu ̄tra (2.11.14;3.3.16) mentions a treatise on forest hermits.None of these early texts has survived. One of the reasons may have been thatdiscussions of ascetic life became incorporated in the Dharmas ́a ̄stras within thecontext of the a ̄s ́rama system. Some of their sections dealing with renouncersand forest hermits may, indeed, be fragments from early handbooks for theseascetics. The epic Maha ̄bha ̄rata, likewise, contains similar fragments of asceticliterature (Winternitz 1923). Sections of some of the early Upanis.ads may reflectrenouncer influence or literature.Within the Brahmanical tradition, nevertheless, the only surviving literaturedealing with renunciation is embedded within the Dharmas ́a ̄stras. It was notuntil the early middle ages that independent compositions dealing with the lifeof renouncers were composed. These fall into the category called Nibandha, thatis, scholarly texts dealing with one or several elements of Dharma with copiousquotations from earlier Dharmas ́a ̄stric treatises. One of the earliest survivingtexts of this class is the Yatidharmasamuccayaby Ya ̄dava Praka ̄s ́a (twelfth centuryce; Olivelle 1995a). Numerous other texts dealing with the rite for becoming arenouncer, his daily life and activities, rules governing his life, and his funeralwere composed during medieval times. Most of these have not been edited orprinted and only exist in manuscript (Olivelle 1976–7, 1987).Sam.nya ̄sa: Abandoning Fire and RitualI have already alluded to an important aspect of renunciation that cuts acrosssectarian divides: the refusal to use fire and the rejection of ritual activitiescentered on the sacred fire. This led to another central feature of renunciation:mendicancy. Renouncers begged cooked food and not dry rations; without a firethey were not able to cook. At least in some traditions, likewise, renouncers didnot follow the normal social custom of cremating their dead but instead buriedthem. One of the reasons given for this practice is again their refusal to use fire.Although present also in Buddhist and Jain traditions, the abandoning of thefire became a central feature especially in the Brahmanical understanding ofrenunciation. The sacred fire and the rituals connected with it are a centralfeature in the vedic and Brahmanical religion. The very first word of the veryfirst hymn of the very first text of the Veda, namely the R.gveda, is “Agni,” Fire –a celebration of the fire god as the priest who conveys oblations to the gods, whois the mouth of the gods in which all oblations are deposited. Abandoning thisparamount symbol of vedic religion, therefore, received special attention in thistradition.Sometime toward the end of the first millennium bcea new word was coined to express this significant element of Brahmanical renunciation. Theword was sam.nya ̄sa, which in later times became the most common term in thethe renouncer tradition281"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"Brahmanical/Hindu vocabulary for the institution of renunciation. In the earlyyears, however, the term had a more restricted meaning, referring primarily tothe abandonment of the fire and ritual during the rite of renunciation. Thisritual is often referred to simply as sam.nya ̄sa.A medieval definition of renunciation captures the central meaning of thisterm: “Sam.nya ̄sais the abandonment of daily, occasional, and optional ritesfound in the Veda and in the texts of tradition, rites known though injunctions,an abandonment carried out by reciting the Prais.a formula” (Olivelle 1975).The Prais.a formula is the central act in the ritual by which a person becomesa renouncer. It consists of saying three times the words “I have renounced”(sam.nyastam.maya ̄), first softly, second in a moderate voice, and the third timealoud. The ceremonies leading up to this climax begins the day before with aseries of offerings to ancestors and the shaving of the head and beard of the can-didate followed by a bath. On the day of renunciation, the candidate offers a finalsacrifice in his sacred fire and extinguishes the fire. The abandonment of the fireis interpreted within the tradition as an internalization. The fire is deposited inthe renouncer, who carries it within himself in the form of his breaths. Thereare five types of sacred fires in the vedic ritual, and there are five types of breathswithin the human body. Thus, the two sets dovetailed nicely; after his renunci-ation the five breaths are his five fires, and whenever a renouncer eats he offersan internal sacrifice in the fires of his breaths.The final act of the renunciatory ritual is the taking possession of theemblems of his new state: ochre robe, water pot, begging bowl, pot hanger, andstaff. The new renouncer places himself under the tutelage of an experiencedteacher.The medieval theological tradition of Advaita Veda ̄nta made renunciationcentral in its understanding of the path to liberation. Advaita was a monisticsystem of philosophy that looked upon the world of multiplicity as in some wayillusory. Taking this illusion that constitutes one’s own individual existence andthe external world as reality is ignorance, the cause of our suffering and of ourbondage to repeated births and deaths. The first step in the direction of trueknowledge is to give up all activities (karma) that are the driving force of theuniverse, and the most potent of such acts are the ritual acts, which are alsocalledkarma. Thus, the giving up of the ritual and the ritual paraphernalia,especially the ritual fire, was considered in Advaita Veda ̄nta as a prerequisite forspiritual progress.Renunciation as PenanceThe Dharmas ́a ̄stra of Manu (first to third centuries ce) contains a significantverse, which was probably a proverb current during that period: “What needscleansing is cleansed by using earth and water; a river is cleansed by its current,a woman with a defiled mind by her menstrual flow, and a Brahmin by means282patrick olivelle"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"of renunciation” (5.108). Here we find renunciation compared to other methodsof purification; renouncing is an act of purification from sin and defilement.Now, the normal method for getting rid of sin in the Hindu tradition is by per-forming an appropriate penance, which is called pra ̄yas ́citta. The most commonform of penance is fasting. Sometimes penitential acts are carried out as a vow,which is called vrata. Beginning about the fifth century ceand with increasingfrequency, the literature on Dharma subsumes renunciation under these twocategories of religious acts. The early texts of Dharma generally discuss renun-ciation and ascetic modes of life under the a ̄s ́rama system. Later texts, forexample the Dharmas ́a ̄stra of Ya ̄jñavalkya and medieval legal digests (nibandha),on the other hand, place them within the section dealing with penances(pra ̄yas ́cittaka ̄n.d.a). According to this understanding, the difference betweennormal penitential acts and renunciation is that the former are undertaken fora limited, often brief, period of time, whereas the latter is undertaken for life.This connection between penance and renunciation influenced both the reli-gious practices of ordinary people and the behavior of renouncers, a process thatI have referred to as the domestication of renunciation (Olivelle 1995a). Thisprocess is most evident in the handbook on renunciation written by Ya ̄davaPraka ̄s ́a. He integrates ascetic life into the normal ritual life of Brahmanism. Indealing with the daily practices of a renouncer, for example, he concludes thatany practice not mentioned in connection with ascetics should be gathered fromcorresponding practices of householders and vedic students. Penances forrenouncers, likewise, are the same as those for householders, except that they are sometimes more intense. So, for example, the common lunar fast(ca ̄ndra ̄yan.a), which consists in reducing and increasing by one mouthful theintake of food according to the waning and the waxing of the moon, has a moresevere ascetic counterpart called yatica ̄ndra ̄yan.awhich not only ascetics but alsoordinary people can perform. Reading Ya ̄dava’s work closely, one gets the dis-tinct impression that the Brahmanical renouncer is a very exalted type of house-holder rather than a figure who contradicts the value system represented bydomestic life.Renunciation in Later ReligionsThe leadership provided by renouncers in founding and propagating sects,already evident in the case of Buddhism and Jainism, continued well into themiddle ages and modern times. The French social anthropologist, Louis Dumont,has drawn attention to the close connection between sects and renunciation(Dumont 1960). Many of the founders of both S ́aiva and Vais.n.ava sects wererenouncers, and the organization of sects often accorded renouncers a centralposition.Most of the medieval Indian sects, however, had devotional theologies andliturgies that asserted the centrality of love and devotion to its particular god asthe renouncer tradition283"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"the sole means of attaining liberation. These theological and religious traditionsare collectively referred to as “bhakti.” Most bhaktisects accepted the institutionof renunciation, often redefining its meaning as withdrawal from worldly con-cerns so as to focus solely on devotion to god. Nevertheless, the internal logic ofbhakticontradicted the elitism inherent in the institution of renunciation.Renouncers were religious virtuosi; and in theologies where mystical quests andascetic discipline were central, the claim could be made that only renouncerswere able to achieve the highest goal of religion, namely liberation. Love, on theother hand, is egalitarian; anyone can love. Indeed, bhaktiliterature is filled withexamples of poor and ignorant men and women who gain divine favor by theintensity of their love.Bhakticontained the potential for radicalism both in religion and in society,even though not all bhaktitradition espoused radical social or religious change.Most were, in fact, rather conservative, acknowledging caste and gender differ-ences within religion. There were some, however, that did draw radical conclu-sions from the premise that all humans are alike in the eyes of god, and the onlything god requires from humans is complete and unconditional love and sur-render. It was not necessary to go to Benares to see god; he is present in one’sheart. For a person who loves god, his or her front yard is Benares. There is noneed to leave home and family and to become a world renouncer in order to lovegod; a poor farmer can love god more intensely while pursuing his lowly tasksthan an arrogant renouncer surrounded by a throng of disciples.The seeds of this challenge was already sown in the Bhagavad Gı ̄ta ̄. Standingin his chariot with Kr.s.n.a, the incarnation of Vis.n.u, in the middle of the twoarmies ready for battle in the great Bha ̄rata war, Arjuna is struck with remorseat the imminent destruction of kith and kin. There they stood, fathers and sons,uncles and nephews, grandfathers and grandsons, teachers and pupils, ready tokill each other for the petty comforts of royal power. In disgust and dejection,Arjuna throws down his bow and says, “I will not fight!” Kr.s.n.a, god andupholder of social order, uses every argument possible to convince Arjuna thatit is his duty as a warrior to fight, to kill and to be killed. The author of the Gı ̄ta ̄,subtly but effectively transforms Arjuna’s refusal to fight into the broadertheological dispute over engagement in and withdrawal from activity, living insociety and renouncing it. What is better? To act or not to act?Kr.s.n.a’s response amounts to a redefinition of renunciation, which is calledsam.nya ̄sain the Gı ̄ta ̄. Renunciation, Kr.s.n.a points out, is not simply the runningaway from society, the refusal to act – for whether we like it or not, our very natureforces us to act. “True” renunciation is not the mere withdrawal from action,which is impossible in any case, but the abandonment of any desire for the fruits,the results, of one’s actions. This true renunciation is an internal attitude andhabit; not an external institution with specific rules and emblems. Kr.s.n.a calls it“continuous or perpetual renunciation”; unlike institutional renunciation whichis carried out on the day that one performs the ritual of renunciation, here onehas to continuously fight inner longings and give up desire for fruits every timeone engages in any activity. Finally, this inner and true renunciation is not a284patrick olivelle"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"simple negativity, a giving up of desire; desire is given up so that one can offer togod one’s actions as an offering, as a token of one’s love.This new understanding of renunciation pervades later bhaktidiscourse. Mostoften, it only supplements the more traditional understanding of renunciation.Debates raged between competing traditions in medieval India about re-nouncers and renunciation – from lofty theological arguments about the natureand the function of renunciation in the path to liberation to what appears to the outside observer as petty squabbles about the dress, food, and emblems of arenouncer, even whether they should carry a single bamboo staff or threebamboos tied together (Olivelle 1986–7).In some of the more radical sects and traditions, however, we find the explicitrejection of renunciation. The Sikh religion that emerged in north India in thesixteenth century rejecting both Muslim and Hindu identities – “There is neitherHindu nor Muslim” – does not have a place for renouncers within its institu-tional structures. The fifteenth-century bhaktisaint Kabir is at his sarcastic bestwhen he rails against the holier-than-thou ascetics:Go naked if you want, put on animal skins; what does it matter till you see theinward Ram? If the union yogis seek came from roaming about in the buff, everydeer in the forest would be saved. If shaving your head spelled spiritual success,heaven would be filled with sheep. And brother, if holding back your seed earnedyou a place in paradise, eunuchs would be the first to arrive. (Hawley andJuergensmeyer 1988)Down the centuries the Hindu traditions have been caught in an internal andunresolved conflict not just between two institutions – married household lifeand celibate renunciation – but also between the two value systems representedby these two institutions. We have seen many and repeated attempts to bringthese two poles of the tradition together, always with limited success. This longdebate, with echoes in the ancient Upanis.ads, epics, Dharmas ́a ̄stras, andmedieval theological tracts, continues in India today, as exemplified in this 1978speech by the then Vice-President of India, whose view of householder as “truerenouncer” goes back to the Bhagavad Gı ̄ta ̄:Who is better – the householder or the sanyasi? Of course, the householder, accord-ing to Vice-President B. B. Jatti. While the householder willingly renounces all thathe earns to his wife and children for their love and affection, the sanyasi dependson others for his milk and fruits. Parasites, who are a mere burden on society, aresinners. If man has to progress, everybody must work. (Indian Express, May 8,1978)BibliographyBasham, A. L. 1951.

N. MadanDefining the TermsTo write about the householder tradition in Hindu society, it seems desirable thatwe begin with a brief clarification of the key terms “householder,” “tradition,”and “Hindu society” as employed in this chapter.A household is a group of persons who own or “hold” a house: they are thehouseholders. They may as well be seen as a group that is held together, as itwere, in or by a house. The idea of ownership is mutual and dynamic: it is adurable relationship made of many strands. A house is of course a building ofsome kind intended for human habitation, but in many cultural settings, includ-ing the Hindu, it is more than that. Besides a material (architectural, allodial)aspect, it has ritual, symbolic, and emotional significance, establishing richerbonds between the house and the householders, and among the householders,than those of mere co-residence in a dwelling.Co-residence is, however, a crucial aspect of the life of the householders. Itarises from the ties of kinship, which may be biological or fictive but modeled onthe biological, and of marriage. To elaborate, the household comprises at least amarried couple and their naturally born or adoptive children. In preindustrialsocieties the household is usually more ramified structurally and may eveninclude distantly related or unrelated helpers and dependants. In such societies,the family and the household usually are, unlike in contemporary westernsociety, differentiated. A family usually comprises many households which livein separate sections of a house or in separate houses. The houses may be builtaround a compound or may be scattered. The failure to recognize the embeddedcharacter of the household within the family has given rise to the somewhat mis-leading notion of the Hindu “joint” family (Madan 1962). Some perceptivescholars have rightly observed that from the Hindu perspective the western"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"household, which is also the immediate family, may well be characterized asbeing “restricted.”Apart from having a structural or formal aspect, the household also has func-tional and cultural aspects. Householders do many things together. Most notablythey produce and socialize children. They act as an economic group engaged inproductive and distributive activities, and marked by a division of labor on thebasis of (among other considerations) age and sex. They participate in domesticrituals focused on particular household members (e.g. birth, marriage, anddeath rites) or on other religious concerns (e.g. propitiation of supernatural“beings”). They gossip, tell tales, sing and dance together. All these and otherrelated activities comprise a significant part of the way of life of the household-ers – their culture. What they do not only fulfills certain practical needs, but alsobestows meaning and significance on their lives. The practical and the symbolicaspects of the householders’ lives, their interests and values, are closely inter-twined. They are a legacy that is ever being reaffirmed and reformulated.This brings us to the second term, “tradition,” which is used here to denotethe established ways of living in a society, and their underlying principles andvalues, accumulated over time. Traditions may be written or they may be oral.All that is remembered may not, however, be currently alive, nor may it be dead,for it may be revived and in the process reinvented. The householder tradition inHindu society today had its beginnings in the so-called vedic age about 3,000years ago, and has inevitably undergone many significant changes. Given sucha length of time, what is remarkable is perhaps not the extent of change, but themeasure of continuity.This continuity, however, is often questioned because the very idea of Hindusociety is said to be relatively recent. What, then, do we mean when we write ofHindu society in this chapter? Existentially, Hindu society comprises all thoseIndians who consider themselves Hindus and make public acknowledgment of this identity, for example when the decennial census is taken. It accounts for four-fifths of the population of India of nearly one billion. If the so-calledScheduled Castes of officialese, or Dalits (the oppressed) of popular discourse,formerly known as the “Untouchables,” are excluded – as some vocal Dalitintellectuals demand (see Ilaiah 1996) – Hindus still account for over two-thirdsof the population.The word “Hindu” is of course not new: even as term of self-ascription it has been employed at least since the fifteenth century (Thapar 1989: 224). Theidea of a large, multimillion-strong, community of subcontinental distribution,however, emerged only in the nineteenth century in response to the westerncolonial and Christian missionary challenges, and as a result of improved meansof transport and communication. Such an encompassing idea brought together,but did not merge into one, a multitude of communities identified by regionalculture and language, religious belief and practice, hereditary occupation andcaste, and other criteria.Thus, Bengali Brahmans, Tamil S ́aivas or Vais.n.vas, Gujarati Patidars, northIndian Kayasthas, and numerous other communities acquired an additionalthe householder tradition in hindu society289"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"shared identity as Hindus. The immediate significance of this development wasprimarily political. It also highlighted a sense of cultural togetherness in termsof the recognition of a common textual tradition of long duration, beginningwith the Vedic corpus and including the later Pura ̄n.as and Epics. The extent andnature of the knowledge of this tradition was (and is) variable, being derivedfrom the texts themselves or their exegeses among the literate elites, or receivedthrough verbal exposition by professional story tellers and family elders amongthe nonliterate, largely rural populace.It has been suggested that acknowledgment of the ultimate authority of theVeda may well be the minimum definition of Hinduism and Hindu identity today(Smith 1989: 13–14), irrespective of how much or how little is known about it.But Hinduism is not identical with Vedism or Brahmanism (Flood 1996). In itsgrowth other sources too, notably the folk traditions – some of them predatingthe Vedic period – have contributed significantly. In fact, a two-way flow has beenat work. Elements of the textual (“Great”) tradition have been restated and reen-acted in the idiom of the folk (“Little”) traditions (the process has been called,somewhat infelicitously, “parochialization”). Likewise local beliefs and practiceshave been built into the textual tradition through “universalization” (Marriott1955). Other process of communication or combination have also been at work,such as the identification of critical resemblance between different traditions(Hiltebeitel 1999).In short, both existentially and historically one can speak and write of Hindusociety meaningfully. Its boundaries are flexible, however, and even at its center“an inner conflict of tradition” (Heesterman 1985) has been manifest. One of themost significant of such antagonisms is between householdership (ga ̄rhasthya,firmly embedded in society, and renunciatory withdrawal from social obligations(sam.nya ̄sa). And this dichotomy is as old as the Vedic tradition itself.“Ga ̄rhasthya”: Way of Life or Stage of Life?Domestic groups of one kind or another are a cultural universal. Even food-gathering and nomadic tribes periodically settle down to rest and residence inopen camps or covered huts before they set out again in search of food for them-selves and their domesticated animals. Relatively permanent households aregenerally but not always associated with cultivation of the soil. They are char-acterized by rites and symbols that, among other things, valorize domesticity.Among the Vedic Aryans the domestic fire was more than a hearth forcooking food: it was also the locus of rites of various kinds and thereby acquireda symbolic character. The Aryan householder (s ́a ̄lı ̄na, from sa ̄la ̄, “hall”) did not,however, immediately qualify for the performance of the prescribed s ́rautasacri-fices that occupied a central place in his and his household’s life. For this purposehe had to establish several fire altars. The first of these (agnya ̄dheya) was lit withfire taken from the domestic hearth but, after some ceremonial cooking of grain,290t. n. madan"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"it was extinguished. One then set out from home to relight it elsewhere with afire drill after a lapse of time, say a year. More altars (two or four) were set upsubsequently. The process completed, the s ́a ̄lı ̄nabecame the a ̄hita ̄gni, that is, onewho has made the transition from the world in which he was born to one thatis transcendent. Two options were apparently available.The householder could choose to settle down in the second abode, afterleaving the first, and establish the sacrificial fires there, and acquire the variousaccoutrements of a householder, namely a fixed residence, grain, cattle, andother kinds of wealth including servants. Alternatively, the householder couldopt for the life of a wanderer (ya ̄ya ̄vara). Although he might not have settleddown long anywhere, his wandering had a clear purpose, namely the perfor-mance of the very same s ́rautasacrifices to which the householder devotedhimself. Indeed, the wanderer traveled to acquire the means, by force if neces-sary, to do so. Those from whom he took included the settled householders,whose antagonist he would have seemed to be. But his ultimate aim, after theyears of wandering and violence, apparently was to settle down to the life of apeaceful householder. Although less glamorous it was regarded as a welcomeway of life.In the event, the s ́a ̄lı ̄naand the ya ̄ya ̄varawere really not opposed to each otherin their aims but only in their methods. The householder does leave home onceto become the a ̄hita ̄gnihouseholder, and the wanderer eventually settles downto domesticity. Both are united in the role of the s ́rautasacrificer, who is a house-holder although, paradoxically, he also performs rituals that are extrasocial.Making their appearance in the vedic texts, the householder and the wandererare present in the Dharma literature also as two types of householders.Jan Heesterman, on whose discussion of the original Sanskrit sources theforegoing account is based (see Heesterman 1982 and 1985), points out thatwhile all Dharma texts prescribe the departure of the s ́a ̄lı ̄nafrom home beforehe may establish the sacrificial fires, the ya ̄ya ̄varaemerges as the renouncer(sam.nya ̄sa) in some of them. Like the s ́rautasacrifice, renunciation is an act thattranscends society. But while the sacrificer periodically reverts to the life of thehouseholder (after each sacrificial performance), or even does so for good, therenouncer turns his back on both the domestic and the sacrificial fires. Accord-ing to Heesterman, the renouncer better fulfills “the inner logic” of the vedic tra-dition, wherein the desire for breaking away from society is first articulated. Thewish for transcendence, however, never wholly repudiates the human world butrather encompasses it. “The householder adds an extra-social dimension to hisquality by becoming a s ́rautasacrificer and finally withdraws from society into arenunciatory mode of life. But even then he retains the quality ofgr.hasthaand[of]a ̄hita ̄gmi”(Heesterman 1982: 268).Patrick Olivelle, another authority on the subject, is even more emphatic inpresenting the early primacy of the householder’s way of life. He writes: “Theideal and typical religious life within the vedic ideology is that of a marriedhouseholder. The normative character of that life is related to the two theologi-cally central religious activities: offering sacrifices and procreating children”the householder tradition in hindu society291"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"(Olivelle 1993: 36). The scope of sacrifice was vast with cosmo-moral signifi-cance and included the three (or five) daily obligations of the householder inredemption of the “debts” mentioned in vedic literature. These number three insome texts and five in others: the debts to goods, seers, and fathers, and addi-tionally to all men and nonhuman creatures. To discharge the debt to the ances-tors, adult men of the “twice-born” (dvija) classes (varn.a) were expected to marryand beget sons. Implicit in the notion of the discharge of debts was an enlargedconception of the moral agent, comprising not only the male sacrificer but alsohis wife (“one half of the husband”) and their offspring. From the R.gvedadown(in time) to the Manusmr.tithis idea of the man–wife–son triad holds ground andidealizes the life of the householder. Through the performance of sacrifices andby begetting a son, a householder achieves the prized goal of immortality.The foregoing view of life underwent a radical transformation as a result ofboth an inner dynamism and significant socioeconomic changes between thesixth and fourth centuries bce. The latter included the introduction of wetlandrice cultivation in the lower regions of the Ganges valley resulting in the genera-tion of an agricultural surplus that facilitated an increase in population and theemergence of urban settlements. With the latter came the merchant class, thenotion of kingship, and an individualistic spirit. “The freedom to choose” thatone would associate with individualism was, according to Olivelle, “at the heart”of the challenge to “the vedic religious ideal,” which led to the formulation of“the original a ̄s ́ramasystem that permitted a choice among several modes of reli-gious life” (Olivelle 1993: 58).The alternatives to the life of the married man and the householder that nowbecame available comprised the life of the celibate and the ascetic respectively.For the ascetic and the renouncer the ultimate aim of moral striving was libera-tion from the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth in place of the Vedic house-holder’s quest for immortality. Comparing the ideology of the early a ̄s ́ramasystem to that of the varn.aand caste systems, Olivelle observes: “The creators ofthea ̄s ́ramasystem intended to do to the diversity of religious life styles what thecreators of the varn.asystem did to the diversity of social and ethnic groups”:instead of “eliminating” it, they accommodated “the diversities within an over-arching system” (Olivelle 1993: 101).Thea ̄s ́ramasystem as originally conceived was, however, transformed by thebeginning of the common era into what Olivelle calls the classical a ̄s ́ramasystem.Whatever the reasons for this transformation, which can only be speculative anddo not directly concern us here, it comprised two significant elements. The alter-native modes of life of the worldly householder and the ascetic renouncer nowbecame stages in the life of the moral agent. Of the four stages of studentship(brahmacarya), householdership (gr.hastha), retreat (va ̄naprastha), and renuncia-tion (sam.nya ̄sa), the first three were by the very nature of the scheme temporary(each stage leading to the next), and the last one permanent as long as one lived.Moreover, a sense of obligation in the pursuit of ideals, which had been over-taken by the notion of choice, was revived.292t. n. madan"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"To quote Olivelle again, “the four a ̄s ́ramascame to be regarded as constitut-ing four ideals of the Brahmanical ethic” that were, “as far as possible,” to be“realized by each individual” (Olivelle 1993: 129–30). And each stage was inau-gurated by the rites of passage appropriate to it. The Brahmans were less toler-ant of choice than their ancestors and provided an ideological back-up to thescheme of stages through the notion ofsvadharma, that is, dharmaappropriateto each stage of life and, concomitantly, each varn.a. It was thus that the com-pound notion ofvarn.a ̄s ́rama-dharmacame to be the definition of the religiomorallife of the Brahmans and derivatively of the other twice-born varn.as.While the notion of the life of the householder as a choice for life is presentin the Dharmasu ̄tras, the later notion ofa ̄s ́ramas as stages of life is elaborated inthe Dharmas ́a ̄stras, belonging to the first five centuries of the common era. Ofthese the most frequently cited, perhaps, is the Ma ̄nava Dharmas ́a ̄stra, also knownas the Manusmr.tiand believed to have been in existence already in the secondcentury (see Bühler 1964: xiv). The householder’s stage in the life of the indi-vidual is prescriptively introduced early in the text: “When, unswerving in hischastity, [the student] has learned the Vedas, or two Vedas, or even one Veda, inthe proper order, he should enter the householder stage of life” (Manu 3.2 inDoniger and Smith 1991: 43).One notices a certain urgency here, a desire not to postpone too long the inau-guration of the householder’s life. Appropriately, the making of a proper mar-riage is taken up first (Manu 3.4–66). The qualities of a woman that make hera good wife are listed. Eight forms of marriage and their varn.a-wise appro-priateness are described. Exhortations on the duties of spouses and the respectdue to women follows. The men of the household are advised to “revere” and“adorn” women if they wish for “good fortune”: “The deities delight in placeswhere women are revered. . . and [the family] thrives where women are notmiserable” (Manu 3.55–8).The law book then proceeds to prescribe the establishment of the domesticfires for cooking food and performing “five great sacrifices” as well as otherdomestic rituals. These sacrifices, it is explained, enable the householder toexpiate the sins that are daily committed as a matter of necessity at the fiveslaughterhouses of the home, namely the fireplace, the grindstone, the broom,the mortar and pestle, and the water jar (Manu 3.68). The expiatory rites are:“The study (of the Veda) is sacrifice to ultimate reality, and the refreshing liba-tion is the sacrifice to the ancestors; the offering into the fire is for the gods, thepropitiatory offering of portions of food is for the disembodied spirits, and the revering of guests is the sacrifice to men” (Manu 3.70). The continuity ofthe tradition from the vedic sacrifices (mentioned earlier in this chapter) down(in time) to S ́a ̄stric rituals is noteworthy.The argument is enlarged to bring in the other three orders (correspondingto the other stages of life): “since people in the other three stages of life are sup-ported every day by the knowledge and food of the householder, therefore thehouseholder stage of life is the best” (Manu 3.78).1In the giving of offerings andthe householder tradition in hindu society293"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"alms nobody is left out, not even dogs, those who have fallen, “Dog-cookers,”those whose evil deeds have made them ill, birds, and worms (Manu 3.92).Guests come in for detailed mention, and even a deserving Vais ́ya or S ́u ̄dra,approaching a Brahman’s house in the proper manner, must be given food,although only alongside the servants (Manu 3.112). Not everyone qualifies tobe a guest, however; certainly not Brahman householders in their own village,who can only be called foolish, for they run the risk of being reborn as “the live-stock of those who have given them food” (Manu 3.104). It is only after one andall have been fed that the pious householder shall himself eat. “The householdershould eat the leftovers only after he has revered the goods, the sages, humans,ancestors, and the household deities. The person who cooks only for himself eatsnothing but error [sin], for the food left over from the sacrifice is the foodintended for good men” (Manu 3.117–18).A large part of the third book ofMa ̄nava Dharmas ́a ̄stra(122–286) has s ́ra ̄ddha,the sacrifice to the ancestors, for its theme. The central rites consist of offeringrice balls (pin.d.a) to specified deceased ancestors and feeding invited Brahmanswho represent them.The fourth book attends to the issue of the means of subsistence of the house-holders. An interesting classification is presented. Subsistence by gleaning cornand gathering grains is “lawful”; unsolicited gifts are “immortal” and acceptable;farming, although the “deadly” mode of life, is legitimate; trade is “simultane-ously good and unlawful” and yet permissible. But servility must be avoided forit is “the dog’s way of life” (Manu 4.5–6). Detailed rules of behavior not only inrespect of diet but the whole range of natural and legitimate activities are listed.Altogether, a view of the householder’s life is presented in which a great dealis permitted including profit and pleasure, so long as it is lawful, prudent, gen-erally acceptable to good people, and in conformity with tradition (see e.g.175–80). What is more, the conception of the householder’s life presented intheManusmr.tiis inclusive and incorporates through subtle devices “the valuesof other a ̄s ́ramas without abandoning home and family” (Olivelle 1993:140).The conflict between the two views ofga ̄rhasthya– as a permanent alterna-tive to other ways of life, notably that of the renouncer, or as a temporary stagein the life of a twice-born man – was apparently never completely resolved inthe textual tradition of the Dharmas ́a ̄stras and subsequently. What is clear,however, is that, even when the idea ofa ̄s ́ramas as stages of life prevailed, thevirtues of the householder’s way of life were uniformly eulogized. Thus theMaha ̄bha ̄rata, which is a truly oceanic source of the precepts and practice ofdharma, endorses “the superiority of the householder” and promotes the idea that renunciation of the householder’s life is appropriate only in old age(Olivelle 1993: 148–51).Although Olivelle argues persuasively that the notion of choice in the origin-ala ̄s ́ramadid not completely disappear from subsequent formulations, contem-porary Indological literature has generally favored the idea of an orderedsequence of stages. This is true of both earlier works and the more recent ones,but Olivelle’s seminal work is bound to generate rethinking on the subject. The294t. n. madan"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"prevailing consensus regarding a ̄s ́ramas as stages of life may be illustrated byreferring to two widely read studies of Hinduism by Zaehner (1962: 146–50)and Flood (1996: 61–5, 87–90). In considering the householder’s state the veryfoundation on which the other states rest, contemporary scholarly opinionfollows the standard reading ofMa ̄nava Dharmas ́a ̄stra.The influence of Indology on social-anthropological studies of the family andhousehold in Hindu society has been negligible. Indeed many anthropologistsand sociologists writing in the 1950s and 1960s emphasized the desirability offreeing ethnographic inquiry from Indological assumptions about the characterof the Hindu family and the household (see e.g. Shah 1973). The one major dis-senter was Louis Dumont, who maintained that the sociology of India should lieat the confluence of the findings of Indology and the sociological vantage-point(1957: 7). Following this methodological perspective, he produced a seminalessay on world renunciation in Indian religions in which he suggested that “thesecret” (or core principle) of Hinduism (and the structure of Hindu society) maybe found in “the dialogue between the renouncer and the man-in-the-world”(Dumont 1960: 37–8).As Heesterman has pointed out, “In the classical Brahmanic view the pivotalactor on whom the dharmaturns is the typical man-in-the-world, the substan-tial ‘twice-born’ householder, the gr.hastha” (Heesterman 1982: 251). He dis-agrees with Dumont regarding the notion of the dialogue because, according tohim, the renouncer and the householder lack a common ground, and stand forgenuinely dichotomous, mutually antagonistic – rather than complementary –lifestyle choices. What interests us here is that both recognize the traditionallycentral position of the householder in Hindu society.Taking that agreement as the point of departure, we now turn to an exami-nation of the ethnographic evidence accumulated in the recent past.2The Householder in EthnographyIn the clarification of the definitional conventions (in the first section of thischapter), the attention paid to the house may have seemed somewhat excessive.In the classical textual tradition, the building of temples, royal palaces, and citiesexpectedly received much more attention than ordinary houses (Rowland1953), but some of the basic principles (concerning, for example, the choice ofthe site and the size and orientation of the building) were the same. The applic-ability of these principles to house building varied according to the varn.aof thehousehold, more choices being open to the Brahmans and Ks.atriyas than to theothers. The abundance or meagerness of the material resources of the house-hold also was a significant factor influencing if not determining the choices thatwere made. Some of the traditional considerations have survived until today;indeed there is today a resurgence of interest in urban India in vedic architec-tural principles of house-making.the householder tradition in hindu society295"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"The folk traditions are not lacking in this respect. Indeed, there are not onlyexplicit guidelines about house-making, which combine ritual and practical con-siderations, but a vast lore about the character of the houses, and its significancefor the well-being of the household also exists.Thus, among the Brahmans of the Kashmir Valley, widely known as thePandits (Madan 1989),3the house is the abode of gods as well as human beings.It has a guardian deity (gr.hadeva ̄) who is identified (through the rituals associ-ated with him) with Va ̄stupati, the vedic lord of the earth. The bonds betweenthe house, the deity, and the household are intimate. It is noteworthy that, tra-ditionally, a Kashmiri Pandit household never sold or bought a house. On build-ing a new house, the protective deities would be ritually reinstalled there beforeentering it, and the old house would then be demolished or, rarely, abandoned.The sentiments of love, sharing, and solidarity that characterize interpersonalrelations in a well integrated household are, in the Pandits’ estimation, thehighest ideals of human conduct, the acme of morality. The house is loved andvalued because of the sanctity and the sentiments associated with it and not merely because of its material value. It is regarded as a moral space parexcellence. The home is said to be neither the place for the indulgence of one’sphysical appetites (bhogas ́a ̄la ̄), nor for the performance of austerities (yogas ́a ̄la ̄,Madan 1989: 256–7). In other words, it is the narrow middle ground, the“razor’s edge” of the Upanisads.An even richer conception of the house in relation to the householders thanamong the Pandits is found in Tamil Nadu. Here houses are material structureslike they are everywhere, but they also partake of the properties of personhood.Valentine Daniel writes:Not only are houses, as are [village] and persons, [made of] substance that can becontaminated and changed by mixing with other substances (hence the concernwith what kind of substance crosses the vulnerable thresholds – windows anddoors – of the house and affects its own substance and that of its inhabitants) buthouses are also “aware” of their vulnerability. They have personlike needs forcompanionship, and experience loneliness and fear when isolated. (Daniel 1984:114)Houses here are believed to have a life cycle: they are conceived and born, theygrow, and may eventually die. Houses like human offspring have astrologicalsignificance and may bring good or bad fortune to the household. They havefeelings and attitudes. It is not therefore without trepidation that the decision to build a house is taken. To minimize the risks and uncertainty strict rules arefollowed in the selection of the site. It must be judged to be auspicious, and ap-propriate rituals (e.g. Va ̄stu Purus.apu ̄ja ̄, although everybody is not sure whoVa ̄stu is) may be performed.Conception is said to occur when a corner post or cornerstone is installed bya member of the artisan caste who is traditionally entrusted this work. While atwork, he must observe rules pertaining to himself. For example: he must eat only296t. n. madan"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"vegetarian food or else ghosts and evil spirits will take possession of the houseunder construction; he must avoid bodily contact with members of lower ja ̄tisor goods in the house will disappear; he must abstain from sexual intercourse orelse the house will be eaten by white ants. Another set of rules concerns the con-struction. Scarecrows must be planted in the four cardinal directions to ward offthe evil eye. When the roof is laid, only an odd number of beams must be used,as a result of which it is deemed to be incomplete. Incompleteness is a blemishand helps in warding off the evil eye. Moreover, incomplete houses may beexpected to grow further.When a house is ready for occupation, it is said to have been born. A horo-scope is cast for it to figure out what the future holds for it. In addition to thenine planets of horoscopes for human beings, the influence of the qualities ofthe first occupants also are crucial for a house. Houses acquire the same ja ̄tistatus as the householders and must observe the same rules of intercasteconduct as is applicable to them. In short, there is a structural homologybetween the human body and the house which is culturally constructed.That the house–householder relationship is an intrinsic one is well illustratedby the distinction that Bengali Hindus make between the ba ̄sa ̄(“nest,” abode) ofa man, his wife and children, and the ba ̄r.ı ̄(also called gr.ha, house) in which hisparents (and other family members) live. Until his father’s death he and hisimmediate family are deemed to be part of the larger family and he may notclaim to have his own separate ba ̄r.ı ̄. Needless to add, not all sons may live awayfrom the parental home (Inden and Nicholas 1977: 7).The Bengalis think of a house as shared space, and this makes room for unre-lated dependents (for example, servants) to live in it along with those who con-stitute the family and who share bodily substance. The Kashmiri Pandits makea similar distinction between one’s gara(house, home) and d.era(place of tem-porary residence), but the latter may be garato someone else. Moreover, a sonmay establish his own household even during the life time of his mother, but thisnormally does not happen while the father is alive.The issue here is the manner in which a household is constituted. Among thePandits the family (kutumb) usually comprises a number of households, eachliving in a house or a part of a house, and known as chulahs(hearth, hearthgroup). They make a clear distinction between those members who are born intothe family/hearth group (zamat), and those who are married into it (a ̄mati,“incomers”). Consanguinity and affinity are mutually exclusive principles.Besides birth and marriage, fictive kinship in the form of adoption also is a rec-ognized mode of recruitment to the family. At the household level unrelatedpersons may also be present, in some cases on a permanent or quasi-permanentbasis (Madan 1989: chs. 5 and 6). Moreover, families are not thought andspoken of in terms of a beginning and an end, but the household is subject to adevelopmental cycle. Births and marriages are the incremental events; deathsand partitions result in the loss of members. A household may even die as whenthe surviving spouse of a childless couple, or a couple that have only daughterswho have moved out on marriage (Madan: ch. 4).the householder tradition in hindu society297"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"Although parental love, filial piety, and fraternal solidarity are said to be thefoundation of the householder’s life, abandonment of joint living as one chulah,and complete or partial partition of the jointly owned estate, are commonlyexpected to occur among the Pandits (see ibid.: ch. 8). In terms of the ideologyof the householder, fraternal strife is considered morally reprehensive, but prac-tical considerations are allowed to override morality. Moreover, the blame forintrahousehold bickering is cleverly placed on the shoulders of the wives whoare, of course, the a ̄matiand not the za ̄mati. And the decline of morality in thedark age ofkaliyugis always cited as a cause of things that should not happen.In this context it is noteworthy that the domestic scene two thousand yearsago was essentially the same as it is today in most Hindu homes. Thus, we readin the Ma ̄nava Dharmas ́a ̄stra): “After the father and mother (are dead), the broth-ers [may] assemble and divide the paternal estate equally, for they have no powerover two of them while they are alive” (Manu 9.104 and 111). More signifi-cantly, apropos the contention of the decline of morality: “They [the brothers]may live together in [mutual respectfulness], or they may live separately if theywish for religious merit; for religious merit increases in separation, and so sepa-rate rituals are conducive to religious merit” (Doniger and Smith 1991: 209,210). It is, of course, questionable how much considerations of religious meritcount in contemporary times, but division of jointly owned estates does oftenoccur with a view to reducing the income tax burden.4The question of religious merit apart, performance of rituals is indeed a majorconcern of Brahman and other upper caste households even if only as a matterof convention. There are two main types of domestic rituals. Firstly, those asso-ciated with life-cycle events (notably birth, initiation, marriage and death),known as sam.ska ̄ra, and those that affirm the bonds between ancestors anddescendents, called the s ́ra ̄ddha. Secondly, there are the rituals that seek to estab-lish purposive and meaningful communication between householders andsupernatural “beings.” These may be supplicatory in character as is the dailyworship to one’s chosen deities, or contractual, or even coercive. The rituals per-formed by lower caste Hindu households may not be an exact replica of uppercaste rituals, and may not involve the specialist services of a Brahman priest, butthey too fall into the two categories mentioned above. Work-related rituals alsotake place in artisan and peasant households.Sustained by economic activity, reinforced by religious observances, the life ofthe Hindu householder is nourished and legitimized by the values of love,sharing, and solidarity. It has been explicated that, while “authority, rights andduties, land, inheritance, the distribution of resources within the joint family,prestations, reproduction, and so forth” are critical factors in the constructionof interpersonal relations in Bengali households, often providing the basis forconflict, love (prı ̄ti,prema) holds them together. “If kinsmen have the proper kindof love for one another then they will enjoy well-being and they will not bedivided by greed, selfishness, or envy” (Inden and Nicholas 1977: 87–8).A variety of loves is said to be discernible, namely conjugal, filial, fraternal,parental, and the love between brothers and sisters. Love may be egalitarian or298t. n. madan"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"hierarchical. In all cases, it is expressed through spontaneous and selfless feel-ings of caring (pa ̄lana), nourishing (pos.an.a), and supporting (bharan.a) for oneanother. Delight (ananda), gratification (tr.pti), and contentment (santos.a) are thefruit of such feelings (Inden and Nicholas 1977: 21).An elaborate ideology of love in Tamil Nadu comprises the ideas ofanpu(love),pa ̄cam(attachment), a ̄cai(desire),ka ̄ppu(bonding),pat.t.u(devotion), etc. Theseare articulable, and sometimes articulated, in explication of how the membersof a household relate to one another (Trawick 1996: ch. 3). Anpu is a complexnotion that connotes a multitude of emotions and moral judgments. Thus, lovemust be contained (ad.akkam, containment), for excess is harmful; moreover “lovegrows in hiding.” Even a mother’s love for the child must be “kept within limits,”for “letting love overflow its bounds could be harmful not only to the recipient,but to the giver as well” (Trawick 1996: 94). While the legitimacy and power ofsexual love and pleasure inpam, “sweetness”) may not be denied, the love ofspouses is also best contained to the point of concealment. Such concealmenttakes diverse forms including, particularly among the lower castes, the deroga-tion of the husband by the wife.Love is a force, but its essence is tenderness. It grows slowly by habituation;indeed it becomes a habit (par.akkam) that even death does not destroy. The lovedperson becomes a part of oneself. Pa r.akkamimplies friendliness, easiness, andgrace (Trawick 1996: 100). But it has its emotional costs. Love and attachmenthave a cruel aspect, for they produce restlessness. Moreover, being parted fromthe loved person is painful; it is like having a part of oneself severed. Love makesone do strange and even improper things, such as defiance of the rules of purity:picking up the leaf from which someone has eaten, and which is thereforeimpure, is an act of love and meritorious. It conveys a message of union andequality. Love teaches humility (pani). “In acts of love, the humble became proud, the servant became master, the renouncer became possessed” (Trawick1996: 106). Love normally produces servitude (adima), a sense of being con-trolled by another person, but then this feeling itself is “a powerful expression oflove” (111). Ultimately, love means that the members of the household “are allone” within the “four walls of the house.” As a Tamil householder (a woman)has put it, “In order for you to understand my heart, you must see through myeyes. In order me to understand your heart, I must see through yours” (115,116).There is a gentle and authentic simplicity about the manner in which theTamil villager articulates the place of love in the ideology of the householder.There are other values too that are generally affirmed elsewhere by other Hinducommunities, but raised above them all is the ideal of domesticity itself. TheKashmiri Pandits are the self-aware ideologues ofga ̄rhasthyawithin the valueframework of Hinduism, expressed, for example, in the notion ofpurus.a ̄rthacomprising the goals and orientations ofdharma,artha, and ka ̄ma. The Panditideology of the householder is lukewarm about the fourth purus.a ̄rthaofmoks.a,and explicitly negative about renunciation as a way of life or as the last stage oflife. As a householder, a Pandit may legitimately seek joy and plenitude, butthe householder tradition in hindu society299"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"ideally this endeavor should be subordinated to dharmaand combined withdetachment (virakti) and the love of one’s chosen personal deity (is.tadeva,is.tadevı ̄). As a well-known Pandit poet, Krishna Razdan (1850–1925), who wasa devout Vais.n.va, put it: “Why should we renounce the lovely world?/ Our loveof Him is our austerity . . .” (Cook 1958).The Pandit’s ideology of the householder is, in fact, more than just that: it istheir ideology of humanity. While all sentient beings are born (and die), humanbeings are made and matured through the sam.ska ̄ras and achieve differentdegrees of moral perfection by their conduct. A boy attains the ritual status ofan adult when he receives the girdle (mekhala ̄) and the holy neck threads(yajñopavı ̄ta). In the case of girls, it is marriage that bestows similar status onthem. Marriage is crucial for men as well as women for it is only through it thatthey become householders. Bachelors, childless widowers, and widows are nor-mally members of households but not themselves gr.hastha, and are thereforeconsidered unfortunate. The greatest desire of a Pandit, whether man orwoman, is to be a full-fledged householder.The Pandit ideology of the householder is constructed around men. Womenand children are spoken of in relation to them. But the men themselves recog-nize that in the reality of everyday life women are significant role players. Theyare referred to as gr.hasthadha ̄rinı ̄, the upholders and the bearers of the burdenofga ̄rhasthya. A man works out his destiny as a Pandit and a human being inthe company of women: without them his ritual, personal and social life isincomplete. Among the most coveted meritorious acts that a Pandit mayperform, the giving away of his daughter in marriage (kanya ̄da ̄na) ranks veryhigh. Men are hierarchically superior to women, but it is together with them thatthey constitute the core of the life of the householder.Being a Pandit is as much a concern of women as it is of men. In the domainof domestic activity, however, women’s roles are different, and their work in thekitchen as well as their participation in religious rites is severely but discretelyrestricted during the periods of menstruation. Moreover. women do not offerwater and food to ancestors; they do not have the ritual status and authority toinitiate their sons into adulthood or give their daughters in marriage. And yetthe wife is always present by the husband’s side on all major ceremonial occa-sions. She is one-half of his self (ardha ̄n.ginı ̄).The ideology of the householder clearly establishes the Pandit as the man-in-the-world. Such a person’s prime concern in the midst of worldly activities iswith the maturation of his self. This is ensured if he organizes his domestic lifein strict conformity with traditional purposes (purus.a ̄rtha), employing appropri-ate procedures for their achievement. Release from the chain of transmigration(sam.ska ̄ra) is a high but frankly distant goal – so distant indeed as to be virtuallybeyond reach. A prudent person concentrates on the slow but steady accumu-lation of merit by the conscious effort to lead a disciplined life.Renouncers are conspicuous by their absence in Pandit society. Self-styledrenouncers are distrusted as men who, with a failed domestic life behind them,300t. n. madan"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"make a virtue of necessity. At a deeper level, however, one might detect a fear ofthe renouncer, for he poses a threat to the ideology of the ga ̄rhasthya. Thesam.nya ̄sı ̄is too powerful an adversary to be contemplated with equanimity.Individual renouncers, if judged to be genuine, will be accorded respect. Butrenouncers as a category are caricatured: that the caricature is only too oftenan accurate enough portrait of the “holy men” one actually meets is anothermatter through not totally irrelevant. The real point seems to be that only whenthe renouncer is thus portrayed may he be convincingly employed as a foil tohighlight the virtues of the life of the householder. These are said to flow from“detachment in enjoyment,” which is the essence of renunciation. Ga ̄rhasthyais not to end in renunciation, but it should be guided by the values ofsam.nya ̄sa.For the rest, everything is dependent upon divine grace (anugraha).5The foregoing summary of the Pandit ideology of the householder is based onmy fieldwork in the village of Utrassu-Urnanagri (southeast Kashmir) carriedout mainly in 1957–8. It is noteworthy that, despite over 500 years of life livedas a small minority (about 4 percent of the population in the 1950s) amongstMuslims – who are mainly descendants of Hindus converted to Islam en massein the fourteenth century – and under Muslim rule between the early fourteenthand mid-nineteenth centuries, the Pandits have managed to preserve many coreideas and values of the Brahmanical tradition via oral transmission. In an essaybased on Sanskrit texts of the medieval period (ninth to thirteenth centuries)unknown to the rural Pandits among whom I engaged in fieldwork, AlexisSanderson observes:The Brahmanism of the middle ground...offered the Brahman householder amonism for the ritual agent which admitted renunciation but tended to confine itto the last quarter of a man’s life (after the payment of the three debts), and at thesame time made it an unnecessary by propagating a doctrine of gnostic liberationwithin the pursuit of conformity to the householder’s dharma.. . . [Moreover, thehouseholder] was to protect himself through disinterested conformity to God’s willmanifest as his dharma. (Sanderson 1985: 197–8)Needless to emphasize, it is the continuities between the ideas of the twoperiods (pre-Muslim and Muslim) that are remarkable rather than the differ-ences, which are essentially those of emphasis. It follows that in the study of thehouseholder tradition in Hindu society, the bringing together of the perspectivesof Indology and sociology is not only justifiable but indeed imperative.Concluding ObservationsThe two most characteristic institutions of Hindu society are caste and thefamily/household. Kane in his monumental survey of the Dharmas ́a ̄stras the householder tradition in hindu society301"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"concludes that the overall tendency “is to glorify the status of an householderand push into the background the two a ̄s ́ramas ofva ̄naprashthaandsam.nya ̄sa, somuch so that certain works say that these are forbidden in the Kali age” (Kane1941: 424). Ethnographic evidence also underscores the importance of the lifeof the householder in contemporary Hindu society.Looking back over time, it is noteworthy that various developments in thehistory of Hinduism have reinforced the householder tradition. Thus, many ofthe major protestant sectarian movements of medieval times, which today havemillions of followers, emphasized the virtues of disciplined domesticity asagainst renunciation. Basava (ca. 1106–67), the founder of the Vı ̄ras ́aiva (orLingayat) sect in Karnataka (in the south), himself moved to and fro betweenwithdrawal from and participation in worldly activities, but his followers haveremained wedded to the householder’s life. In Punjab (in the north) all but oneof the ten Sikh Gurus were married men with families, and explicitly opposedthe renunciation of the householder’s life. (The eighth guru died during hisboyhood.) Similarly, Vallabha (ca. 1479–1531), promulgator ofpus.t.i marga(“the way of abundance”), whose followers are found mainly in western India, was a householder, and so are his followers. Although Caitanya (ca.1485–1533), founder of the Gaudiya movement in the east, devoted to Ra ̄dha ̄-Kr.s.n.a worship, did himself abandon family life in his exultation of divine, con-jugal love, his followers include householders as well as ascetics, All these sectsextoll domesticity as the preferred state so long as it is an affirmation of the blissof the union of the devotee and the deity.In popular imagination, however, particularly outside India, the renouncerlooms large. This may be so because he is a magnificent, even theatrical figure,who gives away all his possessions, performs his own mortuary rites to proclaimthe severance of all social bonds, and lives a highly disciplined life of austerities(see Madan 1987: 1–16 et passim). Although he may be impressive, therenouncer is not the only actor on the Hindu stage of life; in fact, he is not onthe stage at all, but looks at it from the outside. That his gaze is powerful maynot be, however, denied. The figure in the center of the stage is the homely house-holder. If not exactly cast in a heroic mould, he is not a shadowy figure either.And, in his own manner, he is a fighter.The everyday life of the householder is marked by temptations that he mustresist. On the one hand, he hears on his front door the knock of the sam.nya ̄sı ̄,who stands there in the guise of the mendicant asking for alms, but also sug-gests the possibility of an alternative way of life. On the other hand, the bhogı ̄(“enjoyer”) knocks on his back door, as it were, inviting him to a life of pleasures.The values ofga ̄rhasthyaare challenged and threatened by both the visitors. Thehouseholder’s success lies in his ability to resist the extremist alternatives and totread the middle ground, combining the values of domesticity and detachment.For the Hindu, of whatever caste or sect, domesticity is marked by the feelingsof well-being and happiness.”6It embodies the values of righteousness andaction, purity and auspiciousness, and purposefulness and contentment. It is thegood life.7302t. n. madan"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"Notes1In the original: yasma ̄t trayo ’pva ̄s ́ramin.o jnãnena ̄nnena ma ̄nhavam/gr.hasthenaivadha ̄ryante tasma ̄jjyes.t.ha ̄s ́ramo gr.hi.2We may briefly note here the reading of the tradition by the scholars of what isknown as “Hindu law” (a product of British colonial administration). Thus, it is statedthat, “the joint and undivided family is the normal condition of Hindu society. Anundivided Hindu family is ordinarily joint not only in estate, but also in food andworship” (Desai 1998: 314). From the sociological point of view this statementsuffers from the conflation of two analytically and often empirically distinct groups,namely the family and the household. The law qualifies the foregoing characteriza-tion by maintaining that, “the existence of joint estate is not an essential requisite toconstitute a joint family and a family, which does not own any property, may never-theless be joint” (Desai 1998: 314). It is obvious that it is a larger grouping than thehousehold to which the law refers; it is equally clear that without constituent house-holds, there would be no joint families. The foundational nature of the household inrelation to Hindu society is thus implicitly recognized in Hindu law.3Virtually all but 5,000 to 10,000 persons of this community of about 300,000persons have been driven out of Kashmir following the eruption of a Muslim mili-tant, secessionist movement in 1989. The refugees live in temporary camps in Jammuand Delhi, or have taken up residence in various towns and cities of India, mainly inthe north. The hope that they will be able to return to their homes are not bright. Indescribing aspects of their domestic life, the present tense has been retained here.4The Hindu undivided family has tax-saving privileges that may be availed by indi-vidual members. These are not available to non-Hindu households (see Gulati andGulati 1962).5A negative attitude towards renouncers is widespread, and may go so far as to ascribea malignant influence to them, responsible for misfortune among householders, asdo the residents of the village Ghatiyali in Rajasthan. For them the sam.nya ̄sı ̄is thethreatening outsider (see Gold 1988: 53). But there are exceptions. In Rajasthanitself, the pastoral Raikas consider renouncers auspicious, even like gods, and theirblessings are valued by householders. The householder–renouncer relationship is notantagonistic here but “intertwined” (Srivastava 1997: 266).6For vignettes of domestic life among four castes of north India (Brahman, farmer,carpenter, and oil-presser), which show interesting similarities and differences, seeWiser 1978.7That would be a neat way to conclude this chapter, but we must note (at least in anote) that the values by which many secularized, Hindu, urban households live todaycome from sources other than traditional culture. The process of change had alreadybecome manifest in the late nineteenth century in cities such as Calcutta andBombay. Individualism was on the rise and large households were being viewed neg-atively by social reformers. The process of social transformation has deepened andbecome more widespread, particularly since independence. More and more people ofmeans in urban India today live in rented apartments, have small “households,”affirm the values of individual choice and achievement, and gender equality, andgenerally participate in a global culture of western origin. But, as the ethnographiccontent of this chapter shows, the old household tradition is by no means dead, par-ticularly in the rural areas, where three-quarters of the people of India live.the householder tradition in hindu society303"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"ReferencesBühler, G. 1964.

Performatively, these hundreds of gods eachhave their unique costuming, make-up, and insignia, and they are danced aspart of annual festivals in public rituals of worship by spirit-possessed profes-sionals who incarnate them in thousands of family, caste, and communityshrines across this region. Historically, teyyams literally enshrine the legacy ofthe way local deities, often themselves the apotheoses of human ancestors, havealternately contested or come to terms with caste-Hinduism, as their lives areliturgically recounted and ritually enacted from a largely subaltern religious perspective.Theteyyamtradition illumines a number of interesting issues for the studentof Hinduism, whether from the perspective of the history of religions or fromthat of the social sciences. Regionally speaking, teyyamworship is demonstra-bly part of those ancient and cognate patterns of institutionalized spirit posses-sion that were shared as a religious paradigm across the cultural zone of southIndia that we identify in kinship and linguistic terms as “Dravidian” (Trautmann1981). In its ritual and institutional stability, teyyamexemplifies how southIndian cults of possession and ancestor worship may have articulated with, andsynthetically given rise to, the local cultural form of temples and enshrinedimages associated with high Hinduism. It further suggests how those beliefs and practices labeled “tantric,” which are generally recognized to underlie theA ̄gamic ideology of temple-installation and worship, served historically and inthe present to mediate between high Hindu practice and possession-worship(Freeman 1998).From the vantage point of social science, teyyamaffords an equally fascinat-ing perspective on the caste-dynamics of this process, both ethnohistorically,"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"throughteyyamnarratives and recitations, and ritually, through the organiza-tion of worship, the various constituents and modes of the rites themselves, andthe spatial and social arrays they configure and map. Finally, all of this is centrally brought to bear on the transformations of personhood that form thephenomenological core of spirit possession, with all the implications of mimesisand deification enacted by lower-caste practitioners in a rigorously hierarchicalsystem. The chapter that follows will attempt a broad and descriptive overviewofteyyamworship, in a way that such aspects of widest scholarly interest arecontextualized and brought to the fore.1Possession Worship in its Sociohistorical ContextIn the Malayalam language of Kerala, teyyammost literally refers simply to the“god” or “deity” (cognate with the Sanskrit devaordaiva) whose elaborately cos-tumed form is donned for the rites of its possessed worship. These rites them-selves, and the festivals built around them, are called teyya ̄t.t.am, or “god-dance.”The ambiguity of this compound itself, however, points to the central ideologyof possession, for the usual interpretation is not that the performers are dancingthe gods, but rather that the gods themselves are dancing, through the bodies ofthe mediums that they have possessed for the occasion. This is borne out mostdramatically at the close of the dance-sequence, where the teyyam(the costumedperformer, we would say), walks among the gathered devotees, interacting withthem, hearing various complaints, receiving offerings, and granting blessings inthe direct voice and behavior and person of the god.This kind of institutionalized possession as a central paradigm of worship isanciently attested in south India from the Tamil Can.kam literature of the firstfew centuries ce, the earliest literature of any surviving Indian vernacular lan-guage (Zvelebil 1974). Ancient Kerala was culturally and linguistically a part ofthis early Tamil country, and it is clear from the structural and ritual features of worship described in the Can.kam corpus, that there are clear continuitieswithteyya ̄t.t.amand similar Dravidian modes of worship. The ancient Tamilsworshipped apotheosized ancestors and fallen martial heroes whose spirits theyinstalled into stone monuments (nat.ukal). These spirits were then periodicallyinvoked into costumed dancer-mediums who spoke as oracular embodiments ofthe deity, and received the same offerings of liquor and blood before similarlydescribed altars that one finds in teyyamworship today (Kurup 1982). The prin-cipal title of the ancient oracle, Ve ̄lan, even survives as the caste-name of onethose communities who perform teyyams today in Kerala, as does the caste ofPa ̄n.ar exorcist-musicians, whose title was anciently used of Can.kam bards (Hart1975).As stated earlier, similar cults of possession abound in south India, where theyare almost always confined to those castes that were traditionally ofS ́u ̄draorlower status in the Brahmanical, Sanskritic reckoning. Throughout south India,308rich freeman"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"however, the S ́u ̄dracategory has always included many of those dominant,martial, and landed castes that would elsewhere in India have been reckoned inthe royal or Ks.atriya varn.a. This seems consonant with the fact that possessionworship received royal patronage in Can.kam times (Hart 1975), and that manysocioeconomically and politically dominant castes in south India have contin-ued to patronize such practices into recent times, often in worship of their ownfamily, clan, and caste deities (kula-de ̄vata ̄). This, I believe, is historically linkedwith a qualitatively different ethnographic patterning one finds in possessioncults across south India as compared with the north. There are often greaterinstitutional investment, social organizational stability, and caste-based heredi-tary lines of possession-priesthoods across south India, whereas such cults tendto be more idiosyncratically personalistic, popularly contingent, and institu-tionally marginal across much of north India. At any rate we find that whilemany (especially urban) sections of the dominant and upper castes have Brahmanized in terms of embracing temple culture and Sanskritic norms ofworship, many landed, village-based dominants have also continued their ances-tral investment in local temple and shrine establishments that give prominenceto possessed worship. This is all the more the case for the bulk of those lowercastes who were traditionally excluded from temple entry, with the combinedresult that possession often retains a level of ritual formalization and sociallystructured entitlement one would associate with higher-caste priestly office inthe north. Teyyamworship exemplifies these points with great clarity, andfurther suggests how tantric doctrine and practice mediated between theBrahmanical and more localized religious complexes in the south.We have little by way of hard historical documentation for teyyamfrom thepremodern, but the internal references, traditions, and subject-matter of theteyyamliturgies as oral literature, conjoined with the areal spread of its ritualforms, particular gods, shrine networks, and social entitlements, would all indi-cate that it existed in substantially its contemporary form from at least the periodof the late medieval kingdoms of northern Kerala, from perhaps the fifteenthcentury. The deities and their shrines distribute with clear ritual and socialcleavages in conformity with boundaries of the old kingdoms of Ko ̄ lattuna ̄t.u,Nı ̄le ̄s ́varam, and Kumbal.am (covering today’s Kannur and Kasargode Districts).Major events recounted in the liturgies go back to probably the thirteenthcentury, and the distribution of cognate dance and possession forms, bothfurther south, throughout Kerala, and further north, in the bhu ̄taworship of theTul.u country in Karnataka (Claus 1978, Nambiar 1996), suggest the mucholder distribution of possession worship, as clearly fundamental to the religiousorganization of medieval society.The dominant kingly line in the teyyamregion of Kerala, that of the Ko ̄ lattiriRa ̄ja, still celebrates its own lineage goddess in the form of a teyyam, in concertwith an amalgam of other local teyyamdeities at its royal, family temple in apopular regional festival. This is despite the fact that, of course, the Ko ̄ lattirisalso worshipped at and extended their patronage to a variety of exclusivelyhigher-caste, Brahmanical temples and establishments throughout theirthe teyyam tradition of kerala309"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"domain. Moreover, all of their subordinate chiefs similarly had their ownteyya ̄t.t.amshrines, with similar amalgams of family and local teyyamgods, andthe festivals of these regional and sub-regional pantheons were calendricallycoordinated in conformity with political precedence and boundaries of religious-political jurisdiction throughout northern Kerala. Further south of oldKo ̄ lattuna ̄t.u, in the territory of the more powerful Sa ̄mu ̄ tiri or “Zamorin” ofCalicut, that king presided over a similar network of deities called tir ̄as, whichmost people do not distinguish from teyyams, and whose forms have regularlymigrated into the teyyamregion, where they have intermingled with theteyya ̄t.t.ampantheons.Despite royal patronage of a number of local gods represented in teyyamform,some of whom are apotheosized chiefly warriors, one of the centrally organiz-ing social facts ofteyya ̄t.t.amis that all of the actual performers are from castestraditionally considered polluting, the avarn.ar, or Kerala’s former “Untouch-ables.” This means that much in the teyyamdeities’ liturgies, costuming, andritual forms was authored by and is in the custody of communities that Indianresearchers today might label subaltern or Dalit, in other contexts. Indeed, sincethe substantial numbers ofavarn.acastes in Kerala (perhaps a numeric majorityin some locales) were all excluded from entry into Brahmanically regulatedtemples,teyyamshrines and temples were theprincipal institutional form of reli-gion for all these peoples. Teyyams were their only manifest gods, and teyya ̄t.t.amwas their form of “Hindu” worship.Since the caste constituency ofteyyamworshippers covers a far wider spec-trum of society than that of the actual performers, however, it means that thesocial provenance ofteyyamdeities is similarly wide. While we have thus seenthat some deities are of higher caste origins, representing socially powerful war-riors or their tutelaries, others find their origins among the lower castes, beingthe apotheoses of local avarn.aculture-heroes and heroines, as well as their ver-sions of more sui generissupernatural spirits and powers. The result of this isthat the associations ofteyyamgods to caste, both as to their particular originsand worshipping communities, weave complexly across the whole of KeralaHindu society, drawing sharp social distinctions in some cases, while articulat-ing a larger ritual order across the lines of pollution-status in others.The legend of how the current form and distribution ofteyya ̄t.t.amwas estab-lished in the Ko ̄ lattiri’s domains illustrates something of the caste and statusmediations and the challenges these posed in Kerala’s late medieval social order.The creation and establishment of the 39 chiefly teyyams of this realm is attrib-uted to one Man.akka ̄t.an Gurukkal., a powerful sorcerer-magician of the thenUntouchable Washerman caste, the Van.n.a ̄ns. His fame was such that his chiefdisciple and attendant, against the norms of caste-pollution, was even a memberof the chiefly Na ̄yar caste.Eventually the notoriety of the Gurukkal.’s supernatural accomplishmentsbrought him to the attention of the Ko ̄ lattiri Ra ̄ja, who summoned him to hispalace. While en routeand at court, Man.akka ̄t.an was subjected to a number ofnatural and supernatural tests by the king and his agents, in all of which he310rich freeman"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"handily triumphed. His final trial was to single-handedly perform the teyya ̄t.t.amsof 39 different gods in the span of a single night. He not only succeeded in this,but the king was so impressed that he commanded these teyyams to be estab-lished throughout his territories. These 39 comprise some of the most promi-nentteyyams connected with notable lineages and their territorial centers,including that of the king’s family, though they also include more rustic and,from a Brahmanical perspective, even quasi-demonic beings. Given the socialaffinities, depth, and spread ofteyya ̄t.t.am, there is little likelihood that this legendrelates to its actual origins; rather, it seems clear that this represents a move-ment of consolidation, in which a core of the teyyamtutelaries of prominent lineages (many of which were upwardly mobile from humbler origins) wereorganized into the ritual network of this king’s polity, with the royal cult at thecenter.The caste tensions inherent in such incorporations, however, are evident inthe conclusion to the legend. Having shamed the king and his nobles throughthe course of his meteoric rise, Man.akka ̄t.an determined to pre-empt theignominy of their almost certain attempts at vengeance. Like the Can.kam heroesof old, he therefore sat facing the north, in a rite of deliberately relinquishinghis mortal life (cf. Hart 1975). Though Man.akka ̄t.an Gurukkal.is not himselfcelebrated as a teyyam(his empowering family goddess, however, is), his finalresting place is surmounted by a monument of laterite stone, dedicated by theking, in which his living presence still resides. There he is regularly worshippedthrough vows and periodically offered liquor and massive blood sacrifices in collective calendrical rites. While the formal aspects ofteyyamworship are dif-ferent, we can see in the social dynamics of Man.akka ̄t.an’s life-story, demise, andsubsequent worship a theme of subaltern defiance and elevation common tomany teyyamliturgies.The Social Organization of WorshipTeyya ̄t.t.amfestivals are commonly celebrated on a yearly basis in the grounds ofshrines and temples where a particular group of one or more deities are housed.Festivals may be held less often at some shrines, though as with the annual celebrations, the dates are astrologically fixed by tradition. Shrines were, andusually still are, owned or managed along specific family, lineage or clan, andtherefore caste lines, though generally during the festivals, all who wish maycome to worship in a regulated fashion, according to traditional precedence. Thecastes sponsoring such shrines run all the way from the highest Brahmans, tothe lowest of the traditional avarn.acastes, though not surprisingly, there are differences in means, structural and ritual elaboration, and behavioral normsassociated with these levels of worship.A specific cluster of named and individuated teyyamdeities are hereditarilyinstalled in any given shrine, and designated lineages within specific castes ofthe teyyam tradition of kerala311"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"performers have exclusive, hereditary rites to perform each particular teyyamdeity in any given locale. Teyyamshrines are often still the prominent, and some-times the only, community religious institution among the lower castes. For themiddle and upper castes, however, teyyamshrines may be attached as adjunctsto a larger temple structure for Brahmanically worshipped deities, sometimesstructurally set apart, sometimes accommodated within the walls of the former.In addition to the lower-caste teyyamperformers who come to incarnate adeity during a teyya ̄t.t.am, most of the lower and middle castes have additionallymembers of their own particular caste who serve as priests to teyyamimages inthe shrine, ministering to them several times a month, or even daily. A class ofthese, called Ve l.iccappa ̄t.us or Ko ̄marams, are themselves possession mediums fortheirteyyamdeities, dedicated each to his particular deity, usually for life. Theyundergo ritually induced possession when worshippers come to the shrine at settimes once or twice a month to consult the teyyamdeities, though a few undergomore spontaneous episodes of possession outside of the ritual context. They alsofrequently perform their oracular rites in conjunction with the regular teyyamforms during the annual festival. In contrast to the elaborate costuming andmake-up ofteyya ̄t.t.amdancers during the annual festivals, these priests alwayshave only a light and standardized costume of a few ornaments, weapons, andother ritual insignia. Depending on their caste traditions, they may have specialred waist-cloths for these occasions of possession. Others wear only the regularbleached cloth (mun.d.u) of daily wear, but in most cases there are preparatorybaths and purification rites before the onset of possession.A typical lower or middle-caste shrine complex generally consists of a lateritewalled compound, with one or more free-standing wooden shrine-rooms,slatted, brightly painted, fronted with wooden carvings of supernaturals, androofed in tile. Each shrine room is generally dedicated to one, though sometimesmore, teyyamdeities, whose spiritual power may be installed in a full image ofmetal, a flat icon, a metal mirror, or simply a sword standing on a masonry plat-form or a wooden stool. Except for the nightly lighting of lamps outside theshrines, most teyyamimages are activated in worship only during the teyya ̄t.t.amfestivals or bi-monthly priestly rites, and so at other times these shrine-rooms areclosed and locked. Subsidiary teyyams often have their own loci in simple stoneor laterite altars, placed at other points in the compound, before which per-formers dedicated to those deities incarnate their gods.Some of the traditionally lowest castes, and those presently or formerly of“tribal” designation, may have only a small altar in a forest clearing, or only aclearing itself, into which a ritual stool (pı ̄t.ham) will be brought and set up for ateyyamperformance. Occasionally these clearings are adjuncts to fuller teyyamshrines of higher castes, the lower teyyams being done in conjunction withlarger and higher caste teyyams nearby, with rites of interaction between thedeities. In other cases, such clearings are for communities with their own rela-tively autonomous performances and deities.For the more prominent, permanently structural shrines, the occasion of theregularteyyamfestival is conjoined with the caste or community that owns the312rich freeman"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"shrine conducting its own pu ̄jarites on the enshrined images. These are usuallycarried out by its own shrine priests, including the ecstatic oracles dedicated toeach god, though for the higher castes, a Brahman or other priest of the temple-servant castes may be brought in for special pu ̄jas as well. In any case, only thesepriests will be allowed inside the shrine-rooms to handle and minister to theimages, and these rites are closely modeled on the tantric or A ̄gamic worshipcommon to Kerala and south India generally (Davis 1991, Diehl 1956).Often there are relations of traditional hierarchical subordination of thecastes sponsoring a teyya ̄t.t.amto one or more higher castes in the vicinity. In thatcase the teyyamfestival is inaugurated by lamps in the teyyamshrine being litwith a flame brought by shrine priests from the temple that is associated withthese higher castes. Thus the social hierarchy is mirrored in the divine energyof the gods flowing down the chain of authority, from the temple gods to theteyyamshrine through the medium of the flame. In any case, however, it is the flame used in worship of the teyyamshrine’s images that will be passed outby the priests, (and through insulating intermediaries in the case of higher castepriests) to the teyyamperformers. This represents the actual spiritual energy orpower (caitanyamors ́akti) of the enshrined images being transferred to thelower-caste dancers. As we shall see below, the ritual elaborations that this trans-fer takes are significant.The Rituals of Worship and PossessionOnce the particular performers from the families entitled to perform a particu-lar shrine’s gods have been appointed for that year’s festival, they will eachapproach the shrine in a fixed order during their inaugural rites. Each separateperforming caste will have their own caste-segregated make-up rooms wherethey will take up residence for the duration of the festival, which may run fromone or several days to an entire week. The gods are performed in a traditionallystipulated order for each shrine, each in a preliminary and more simply cos-tumed form on the first night, to be followed on the next or subsequent days withthe more highly elaborated and individuated full-teyyamcostume.There are actually two generic kinds of these preliminary forms, and everyteyyamgod will have one or the other form exclusively associated with it. Thesimpler of the two forms is called to ̄r ̄r ̄am, which is also the name for the teyyamsongs generally, and consists only of a special red waist-cloth, a vertically risingfrontlet tied across the brow, belled anklets and various other ornaments andjewelry. The more complex form, the vel.l.a ̄t.t.am, has warrior-style pleated waist-cloths and leggings, a wooden waist-piece, a winged wooden crown, and a crudebut standardized pattern of facial and body make-up.The various gods all have the same basic costume and appearance in the to ̄r ̄r ̄amorvel.l.a ̄t.t.amphase, whereas the fuller teyyamform, donned later by the same consecrated performer for that deity, is highly differentiated and individuated,the teyyam tradition of kerala313"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"with its particular configuration of elaborate costuming and crown, facial andbodily make-up, and insignia that mark it as an immediately recognizable and distinct being. If we range the various forms of possessed dancer associated withteyyamdeities on a continuum we thus find a steady progression of increasingornamentation and complexity from the shrine oracle priests, through the to ̄r ̄r ̄amto the vel.l.a ̄t.t.amand into the iconographically elaborate teyyams proper. This suggests that historically either distinct earlier forms of costume merged intoteyya ̄t.t.am, or that earlier forms of possessed worship have undergone this iconographic elaboration in partial emulation of the fixed images of the hightemple (though influence in the opposite direction is clear as well).Since the ritual transformation of the performer into the god is the most cen-trally significant aspect of the teyya ̄t.t.am, I wish to dwell on a few of the mostimportant elements of these rites to mark some larger points. For the to ̄r ̄r ̄amcel-ebration of a particular deity, each dancer comes individually before the openedshrine in which the priests have been performing pu ̄jato receive from them afolded banana leaf containing sandalwood paste and a ritual vessel of water(kin.d.i). The dancer uses these to sprinkle himself and daub the paste over speci-fied parts of his body in a prescribed fashion, starting with his head and endingat his feet. This sandalwood paste comes from the deity and being co-substantialwith it, helps to transubstantiate the body of the dancer into that of the god. Theplaces the paste is daubed are additionally said to correlate with the significantnodes and portals of the body according to the physiological conceptions oftantra, through which the performer absorbs, and is purified by, the divineenergy. Some compared this explicitly with the ritualized bodily purification, thedeha-s ́uddhirites of tantric priests (cf. Flood 2000).Following this, a second folded leaf is passed out which contains raw rice, fiveburning wicks, five betel leaves, and pieces of areca nut. The performer rever-ently tosses some grains of rice into his mouth, over his head and towards theshrine, then wafts the flames thrice towards his brow, inhaling the vapors. Thisleaf kit is then carried to a special masonry altar off to the north of the shrine,called the kalas ́a-tar ̄a, or toddy-pot altar, and there the five leaves are laid out,reverenced, and their essences ritually circulated through the dancer.As informants said of these rites, “the conception behind this is not just thatwhen the teyyamperformer gets this (leaf-packet) he is made worthy to put onthe costume; rather, through that lamp’s flame, he is actually being given thedivine power . . .” Aside from the evident continuation of the theme of absorb-ing the god’s energy through consumption of the god’s rice and of the divineflame’s energy, the rites at the toddy-pot altar have added significance. Thisstructure is a sacrificial altar, named for the pot of alcoholic toddy (kalas ́am) thatsits atop it and that will later be carried with the teyyamin procession by a specialpriest of the toddy-tapper caste whose presence is mandatory at all teyyams. Itis also the altar where blood sacrifices will later be offered, liquor and blood beingpotent substances of empowerment in the non-Brahman worldview. In thesepreliminary rites, the five wicks laid out are said to represent the five vital forcesor life’s breaths (pra ̄n.a) of the performer, with which he at once offers up his own314rich freeman"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"substance as a sacrifice (areca nut being a regular substitute for a body in tantricrites), and absorbs the life’s energies of the god in their stead. Some performersindeed referred to the system of inner vessels or na ̄d.isknown to tantric physiol-ogy, along which this energy is conducted through the body.Completing these rites, and tying on a headband representing the tradition’sgurus along with a frontlet, the dancer comes before the main shrine and beginsto sing the to ̄r ̄r ̄amsongs of the deity. The first of these songs is significant, for itis the invocation, the vara-vil.i(literally “call to come”), addressed to the deity.Rather like the a ̄va ̄hanaor invocation of a standard temple pu ̄ja, it summons thegod into one’s presence, but like the tantric variety of ritual to which it is akin,the site of that divine presence is one’s own body–mind complex. This becomesclearer in the progression of the main to ̄r ̄r ̄amsongs that are then sung by thedancer and his support troupe.In archaic or sometimes Sanskritized varieties of Malayalam, these to ̄r ̄r ̄amsongs variously recount in fixed compositions for each specific god its biograph-ical life and deeds (often as a former human being), its origins and migrations interms of the various locales and shrines where it was established (culminatingwith the place of current performance), and poetic descriptions of its costumedappearance, or imaginative enhancements built on the same. All of these themesconverge in their common performative purpose, in that they work to recreatethe actual presence of the deity in the body and person of dancer, through ver-bally repeating the highlights of its genesis and development as a person, andthen ritually indexing these to the current context and bodily site of possessedenactment. This is the very force of the word, to ̄r ̄r ̄am, where the root meaningis “to seem” or “appear,” but with a transitive force of agency and effective cre-ativity that lacks any simple English equivalent (unless we perhaps conjoin theseparate physical and mental significations of our word, conceive).This transformative trajectory culminates in a final song of actual possession(ur ̄accal to ̄r ̄r ̄am), which may narratively conclude with the death and apotheo-sis of the now divine protagonist, whom the dancer now becomes. Ritually, thisculmination of the song is signified by the performer receiving a mirror intowhich he peers (figure 14.1). The force of this act is universally acknowledgedby performers, as in the following explanation:When he looks into the mirror, the conception will arise, “This is not my form –this is the actual form of the goddess that I am seeing”. . . The act here is the seeingof the sacred face by the sacred face, a divine occasion in which they are fusedthrough seeing each other.The songs and rituals that bring on the possession state are basically the samefor the preliminary to ̄r ̄r ̄amorvel.l.a ̄t.t.amof the god as for the full teyyamform.The latter, more elaborate teyyamrituals are always done by the same dancerconsecrated for the preliminary rites, generally the next day. The costuming forthe full form, which takes place in the make-up room, is generally quite elabo-rate and complex, the facial make-up alone taking sometimes several hours tothe teyyam tradition of kerala315"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"apply. The costuming may include elaborate configurations of pleated cloth, andlacquered and gilt wooden pieces, in addition to sometimes valuable ornamentsand items of jewelry. The make-up room itself (an.iyar ̄a) accordingly becomes alocus of the prolonged ritual transformation of the dancer, where empoweringliturgical verses may be sung (an.iyar ̄a-to ̄r ̄r ̄ams), in addition to those performedbefore the main shrine. When the costuming is nearly completed, save for the316rich freemanFigure 14.1:The teyyam dancer reflexively experiences his transformation into thedeity through the mirror-gazing rite"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"placement of the crown, the performer is led from the make-up room before theshrine, where he usually sits on a ritual stool (pı ̄t.ham– again a term and conceptof tantric significance), for the singing of the final to ̄r ̄r ̄amsongs. As the versesthat bring on possession are sung, the crown is fitted and tied into place, theteyyamis handed the weapons of the deity from within the shrine, and the god’spower is brought out as before in the form of the shrine’s flame, and reflexivelyfixed and acknowledged through the dancer gazing into the mirror. Shrine offi-cials throw rice grains over the crowned deity from within the shrine, an act ofroyal and divine consecration.With the onset of possession, the dancer begins to tremble and shake, andfinally gives way to dance. The dances (a ̄t.t.am) for which the teyya ̄t.t.amfestival isnamed interweave several phases of dance proper, interspersed with variousother rites in interaction with shrine officials and worshippers. There is a gen-erally mandatory procession of the god from the toddy-pot altar, led by a priestof the toddy-tapper (Tı ̄yya) caste carrying the colorfully decked toddy-pot on hishead, accompanied by attendants with chowries, canopies, and tasseled orna-mental umbrellas. At various points there are rites that, like the initial receipt ofthe shrine’s weapons and flame, periodically recharge or reconfirm the flow ofdivine power to the teyyam. Such transfers of symbolic media with the priestsinside the shrine-room include rice, burning lamps, the god’s own weapons, andother sacred insignia such as woven umbrellas. In dances with the shrine’s ownoracle-priests, this divine s ́aktimay be tangibly passed back and forth betweenpossessed priest and teyyam, making the recipients alternately reel or leap spas-modically in place, or leading them into concertedly controlled joint dances ofwonderful precision and power.At the close of the main dance phase personal interactions, first with shrineofficials, then with gathered devotees begin, the teyyamspeaking in the first-person voice of the deity itself. Blessings are given out, contributions arereceived, and disputes may be presented before the god for settlement. Addi-tionally, there may be an extended procession of the dancer out of the shrinecompound and on a journey through the neighboring settlement to visit worshippers’ families and other temple-sites, as the god itself. Finally, the deityreturns to its shrine and to the toddy-pot altar, where, depending on the natureof the particular god, it may preside over a chicken sacrifice before a large caul-dron of artificial blood (kuruti). This is alternately interpreted as a great bloodsacrifice either to the deity itself, or to the numerous ghostly hordes in its charge,depending on the degree of Sanskritization at the shrine and among the per-formers. After a final round of blessings before the main shrine, the dancerremoves his crown and retires to the make-up room. If this is his last dance asthe god during this festival, this final rite is accompanied with a ceremonialreturn of the divine energy back out of the performer’s person and into thecustody of the shrine officials.Where a shrine houses a number of such deities, they are sequenced over oneor more days, with repeat performances of the lesser deities on successive days,culminating in the final and grandest performance by the principal deity of thethe teyyam tradition of kerala317"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"shrine. Not surprisingly, this will generally be the leading family deity of the mostpowerful lineage who founded or who presently controls the shrine.The Social Place of Divine Beings and PowersThe range of types ofteyyamdeities is quite great, reflecting their origins atvarious levels in the social hierarchy and under different sets of historical cir-cumstances. All of the data as to their various origins, natures, and histories are preserved in the fixed liturgies which are sung to invoke their presence forworship, and, to a lesser extent, in the ancillary legends that worshippers circu-late about them. (There is, however, a fairly strict hierarchy of expert knowledgeoperative here, where worshippers routinely refer one to, or cite, the liturgies andprofessional performers or oracle-priests as the authentic sources of truth inthese matters.)Many teyyams, those who represent the original prototype, I would argue,derive from the apotheosis of formerly living human beings. In apparent contrast, others are represented, from their birth, as gods, usually as localizedincarnations of Puranic Hindu deities, created for some special purpose in localcircumstances. The “human” teyyams themselves, however, seem to undergoapotheosis, often after miraculous deeds and violent death, only because of thedivine power already inherent within them. Relatedly, many of the originallygodly teyyams, likewise, are reported to have wandered about in human form,interacting with other human characters as members of their social communi-ties. The essential point suggested here is that there is no clear ontological breakbetween the human and the divine in this cultural context, but rather a contin-uum of expressions of powers, always divine to the extent they manifest an awesomely heightened effectiveness, and always human, to the extent that theyemerge from social relations in a narratively historical context. This narrativecontinuum of the human–divine power spectrum is fully consonant with, andperhaps even necessary, as the discursive support for a performative mode ofworship whose whole rationale is the demonstrated transformation of low-castehuman beings into the tangible embodiments of living gods.The worldview ofteyyamclearly implies that the entirety of human life at itsvarious levels – physical, social, and political – is suffused with unseen powers.The varying organizational scale and levels ofteyyamrites indicate as much, forthey range from occasions of individually contingent vows, consummated withteyya ̄t.t.ams performed in family homesteads, to prominent temple festivals, ofintricate social organization and calendrical coordination (sometimes plannedover decades), drawing on communities over an entire region. It is in the narra-tive content of the liturgies themselves, however, that the varied levels of originand pertinence of divine powers are most clearly in evidence. Teyyams who orig-inate in the political context of rule and warfare range from the tutelary goddessof the Ko ̄ lattiri Ra ̄ja, who defeated an arch enemy-demon to secure the kingdom,318rich freeman"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"down to the apotheoses of local chiefs, warriors, and military henchmen. Otherteyyams have a more caste-specific focus, representing milieus special to a par-ticular lifestyle, and sometimes in conflict with other castes in terms of socialauthority or status relations around ritual purity and pollution. Familial levelsof concern generate teyyamdeities as well, around authority and social controlswithin the family, around peculiarly marked ancestral figures, and, significantly,in terms of the oppression and wrongful deaths of various women who becomegoddesses subsequent to their deaths. Finally, there are various individuals whoset themselves apart in special achievements that entail the quest for and controlof divine powers: healers, scholars, sorcerers (mantrava ̄dis), martial arts experts,hunters, and even traders who operate in dangerous territories, may all besingled out as individuals whose surfeit of power marked them as divine.This spectrum of human–divine powers, being arrayed in an inherently hier-archical system of social dominance, frequently takes on an agonistic and con-testatory character, lending teyyamits characteristic narrative and performativeviolence. Among those teyyams of human derivation, as earlier noted, someclearly have their origins in the vengeful ghosts of lower-caste victims of socialor political oppression, or of women, often murdered by their own male kinsmenin the enforcement of gender hierarchy. Others arise from great hunters ormartial champions, whose low-caste origins and rise to power clearly harboredelements of challenge to the sociopolitical status quo. Still others are powerfulwarriors to begin with, who murder and conquer other peoples, establishingtheir own new order of power relations at the cost of pre-existing polities (figure14.2).Similarly for those of even initial godly status, there are usually relations ofsocial hierarchy or conflict that lead to violence against their often demonizedOthers, in which social elements of relative status, power, and imputations ofimpurity drive supernatural struggles that inevitably draw human charactersinto the fray, establishing charters for lasting institutions and relationships. Atypical example might be the case of Kun.d.o ̄r ̄a Ca ̄mun.d.i (figure 14.3). She is ini-tially created by S ́iva to kill the demon Da ̄rikan in the Kerala-specific recastingof a standard Puranic theme. Since this Ca ̄mun.d.i, however, is polluted from the carnage of her successful battle, she is banished from S ́iva’s presence andordered to travel to local holy bathing spots (tı ̄rtha), where she must seek purifi-cation. Instead of finding the enjoined purity, however, in visiting such placesshe forms agonistic relations with Brahmans, whose rites she disrupts, and whoaccordingly struggle, unsuccessfully, to banish and exorcise her. She similarlyafflicts a local king and his kingdom, committing cow-slaughter in his barns tofeed her appetite for blood, attacking the local temples in her demands for a placeas a deity, and finally killing the Brahman priests when this is refused. Throughsuch acts she eventually extorts acts of placation from the populace, is promotedto the status of a goddess, and is enshrined by a Brahman chief of Kun.d.o ̄r ̄a(whence her name), under the patronage of the king.

There is thus a major strain of resistant religion that informs teyya ̄t.t.am,in keeping with its largely subaltern performative province and communityorganization. Some intellectuals identifying themselves with the Dalit resur-gence have even recently enlisted teyyammyths as representative of their strug-gles (Ayrookuzhiel 1996).Related Traditions in the World of Teyyam: Tantra and Mantrava ̄ damIn the wider culture of this region, however, two earlier mentioned religiouscomplexes that span and link the caste order, cannot be severed from the contextofteyya ̄t.t.am, or from each other. These are the traditions of Kerala’s tantric modeof temple worship and that ofmantrava ̄dam. Kerala’s prominent Brahman caste,the Nambu ̄ tiris, are avowedly tantric in terms of the rites by which they conductthe installation and worship of temple images throughout Kerala. By tantric, Imean in this context, that the Kerala priest relies on classic tantric teachings ofthe psychophysical powers immanent in the human body, to first invoke the deityof worship into his own body, and only then to transfer its power, through hisown metabolic life’s energy or breath (pra ̄n.a) into the fixed image in the temple’ssanctum. As I have written at length elsewhere (Freeman 1998), it is not a greatstretch to posit that a long and complex historical relation underlies the promi-nence of tantric worship as official Hinduism in Kerala – essentially involving amini-possession each time the god is invoked in daily worship – and the eminencethat overt possession, epitomized in teyya ̄t.t.am, as a dominant popular mode of worship in south India has enjoyed over at least the past two millennia. Theparadigm of Brahmanical worship as essentially a muted form of possession thusreflects, on the high end of the social scale, an historical mediation whose resultswe also saw in the incorporation of a tantric rationale for the ritual acts ofteyyampossession reviewed earlier, at the lower end of the spectrum.Similarly, the whole complex ofmantrava ̄dam, problematically rendered as“sorcery” or “magic,” runs the gamut of the social hierarchy. In the Brahmani-cal register, rites ofmantrava ̄damare essentially contingent and private rites ofcontrolling, marshalling, or exorcising various gods and demons through ritesof tantric worship that are closely cognate to those used in the temple, but withgenerally temporary sites of invocation and various props and effigies for manip-ulating sacred powers (Freeman 1999). In the traditionally low-caste register,those castes who perform teyya ̄t.t.ampractice similar rites ofmantrava ̄damforsimilarly personal purposes, in which they additionally take on the costumedforms of special teyyams to invoke and control these same divine and demonicpowers. Again this suggests a long period of historical interaction and synthe-322rich freeman"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"sis between the various castes, in which similar conceptions of divine anddemonic powers, and similar technologies of control through animate and inanimate mediums of “possession,” get differently realized according to con-trastively more Sanskritic, versus more indigenous, linguistic and ritual idioms.Hereteyya ̄t.t.amgrades into lower-caste mantrava ̄dam, just as surely as Brahmanical tantric practice informs the mantrava ̄damof higher castes.Thus the larger point to grasp in the relation ofteyya ̄t.t.amto both tantric doc-trines and to mantrava ̄damis that popular religion and magic in south India are both predicated on immanent local powers whose worship entails rituallyintensifying that immanence through divine “possession,” whether of normallyanimate humans or through their inanimate surrogates. The natural imma-nence of these powers is revealed in the fluidity of boundaries between the divineand human, the living and the dead. Since these powers are immanently human,they are also social, and thus we can see how teyya ̄t.t.am, putatively “low-caste”religion, is actually and pervasively “popular” Hinduism. It was of course inti-mately and integrally part of the life-world of all the laboring castes, but it wassimultaneously a powerful index of martial prowess and authority for all thoseinvolved in traditional polity, and it also epitomized the dreaded Other of low-caste religious power against which Brahmanism defined itself, and which ittherefore came to assimilate in veiled, but unmistakable ways.Premodern Gods in Postmodern KeralaOne of the most remarkable aspects ofteyyamfor the historian of religion is the extent to which belief-structures, ritual practices, and social forms from pre-modern south Indian life-worlds seem to be stubbornly maintained, and evencelebrated, in the midst of modern, globalizing Kerala. Officially secular educa-tional systems, where science and technology are at a premium, socially egali-tarian institutions which deny, in principle, the relevance of caste, and a politicalscene largely shaped, and frequently dominated, by a putatively Marxist party,all sit cheek-by-jowl with teyya ̄t.t.am. We have reviewed the extent to whichdivine and magical powers, their ritual harnessing and manipulation, the continued life and presence of the ancestral dead, and their channeling throughincarnate possession vehicles all point to sustaining a worldview very differentfrom the empirical scientism of high modernity.While there have been some avowedly “progressive” attempts to administra-tively integrate and re-organize some teyyamshrines at a wider “community”level, in my experience, these are for the most part rhetorical and symbolic; themajority of these institutions remain clearly associated with hereditary lineagecontrol within particular castes, with offices, titles, insignia, and powers thatdevolve in ancestral lines and that link them to the very historical identity of thegods enshrined there. And in any case, these managerial concerns are largely amatter of administering the economic resource-base of the shrine during festivalthe teyyam tradition of kerala323"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"times. When it comes to the enduring ritual offices themselves, the shrine priests, officiants, and of course, the teyyamperformers are all filling their titledroles according to a highly regulated hereditary, caste protocol. Different castenames and conventions of address according to caste status from the medievalorder all apply in the rites themselves, in and through the very voice of the god’spossessed vehicle. Even the demarcations of ritual space still create zones of casteinclusion and exclusion, keyed to accord with the traditional purity norms of thecontrolling shrine members. Discriminations, supposedly extinct, that wouldcreate revolt in other, more secular public forums, reappear and are embraced asancestrally charged and potent mandates for accessing divine powers in this reli-gious context.In a wider extension of these same kinds of relations, we find former politicalorganizing principles and institutions resurfacing as well. While the largelyMarxist movements have gone far in refiguring patterns of land control andassociated social inequalities at many levels we would consider “political,” theearlier order in which religion and polity were intertwined in a more pervasivelyfelt set of institutional ritual “norms” (a ̄ca ̄ram), is preserved in relations betweenand across the network ofteyyamshrines. Thus, hierarchical relations betweenBrahmanical temples and lower-caste teyyamshrines still find overt ritualexpression, as with the earlier mentioned rite of transferring flames fromtemples’ lamps to their subordinate shrines. Processional prestations (ka ̄l ̄ca) ofproduce and goods are routinely made from former subjects and their shrine rep-resentatives to their former overlords as part of the celebrations. Former tenantsseek ritual “permission” from their historical landlords and chiefs to conducttheir festivals and accord them special honors and dignities in the shrines. Re-ciprocating ritual visits persist between former martial allies and dependantsduring each others’ teyyamfestivals. These and many other complex relations of“traditions and rites” (a ̄ca ̄ra ̄nus.t.ha ̄nan.n.al.) reenact, without apparent protest orembarrassment, many of the so-called “feudal” sociopolitical hierarchies thatKerala so prides itself on having eradicated in secular forums. Many of the shrineritual offices and the various dignities of the teyyamdancers themselves are stillritually ratified and their “ritual names” (a ̄ca ̄rappe ̄r) conferred by the des-cendants of kings, who become once again “ra ̄jas” for the occasion, at their“palaces” (ko ̄t.t.a ̄rams). This culminates in the fact that the territorial norms thatregulate and define different sub-traditions within the practice ofteyyam, stilllargely conform to the territorial boundaries of the otherwise defunct medievalkingdoms.For the historian, humanist, and social scientist alike, the persistence ofthis whole complex obviously raises perplexing problems for the construct of“modernity” itself, and the place of religion and tradition within it. The peren-nial vigor of traditions like teyyamsuggest ways that secular modernity itselfmay sometimes be relativized by a fundamentally religious reframing. It is clear,in any case, that the Hindus of northern Kerala maintain the prominence ofteyyamin their social lives not as a mere curiosity or relic of tradition.

Predominant Krishna traditions,for example, tend to associate Krishna primarily with Braj, a region just southof Delhi on the Gangetic plain of North India. According to Sanskritic textualtraditions, Krishna grows up in the Braj countryside living among cowherds and"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"frolicking on the banks of the Yamuna river. In later life, he leaves Braj to takeup residence in Dvaraka, which lies on the coast in the contemporary state ofGujarat. In this song, however, Krishna is enjoined to go to the city of Benares,famously situated on the banks of the Ganges River well to the southeast of Braj,a city that has been associated primarily not with Krishna, but with Shiva (Eck1982: esp. 94–145). Krishna traditions also tend to associate Krishna with thegoddess Radha, widely understood to be not Krishna’s wife, but his lover: theirrelationship is an illicit one, for Radha is married to another. But in this song,Krishna is a new groom, enjoined to come join his bride in their nuptial bed andto decorate her body “gently” (dhı ̄re se) with the adornments that mark her newstatus as a suha ̄gin, an auspiciously married woman. Furthermore, the bride inquestion is not Radha: it is Tulsi, the basil plant widely associated with theworship of Vishnu and his forms as the deities Krishna and Ram.I recorded this song in the city of Benares in the autumn of 1998, during the lunar Hindu month known as Ka ̄rtik. I had returned to Benares for the thirdtime in the space of four years to complete research on the religious dimensionsof Ka ̄rtik, particularly focusing on women’s devotional traditions associatedwith the month.2During Ka ̄rtik, many Hindu women living in and aroundBenares gather together in groups along the banks of the Ganges River andperform ritual devotions that they refer to collectively as Ka ̄rtik pu ̄ja ̄(Ka ̄rtikworship). It is in the context of these devotions that I heard female devotees singthis song, beseeching Krishna to come to Benares and join his new bride, Tulsi,in their marital chamber. The image of Krishna as Tulsi’s gentle groom and thenature of women’s religious practices concerning this sacred marriage aredeeply embedded in broader devotional traditions pertaining to Ka ̄rtik.Ka ̄ rtik as a Sacred MonthWhen measured against the solar calendar commonly used in the West, the first day of Ka ̄rtik in Benares usually falls sometime in mid-October, althoughthis varies from year to year.3Ka ̄rtik is considered the second month of the two-month autumn season and the last month before the onset of winter. Sandwiched between the hot and humid rainy season and the chilling cold thatoften comes in late December and January, Ka ̄rtik is widely associated in Benareswith pleasant and hospitable weather. From the perspective of traditional Indianmedicine, the change of season that occurs at this time of year is unhealthful,leaving the body vulnerable to illnesses, and in Benares I heard people attributeall kinds of medical problems to the change in the weather. Yet many people also declare that autumn is the best season and that during Ka ̄rtik the climateis more pleasant than at any other time of year.In addition to being welcomed for the change of season that it marks, Ka ̄rtikis also one of the most religiously important months in the Hindu calendar. It isassociated primarily with the worship of Vishnu and hence is most meaningful328tracy pintchman"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"to Vais.n.avas (those whose devotional life centers on Vishnu). At least in Benares,however, some S ́aivas (devotees of Shiva) and S ́a ̄ktas (devotees of the Goddess)also participate in month-long devotional observances associated with Ka ̄rtik,although they appear to be outnumbered by Vais.n.avas. Distinctive narratives,practices of text recitation, and month-long ritual observances bring the monthto life in Benares in people’s homes, in temples, and along the gha ̄t.s, the stonesteps that line the banks of the Ganges river at the edge of the city.The merits of Ka ̄rtik are especially lauded in sections of the Skanda andPadma Pura ̄n.as that both go by the name “Ka ̄rtik Ma ̄ha ̄tmya” (Glorification ofKa ̄rtik).4The two Ka ̄rtik Ma ̄ha ̄tmyas are not exactly the same, but they do sharea good deal of content. Significant portions of material appear in both texts inidentical or nearly identical form, and some narrative sections that are elabo-rated at length in the Padma Pura ̄n.a’s version of the text are recounted in abbre-viated form in the Skanda Pura ̄n.a’s version. Some portions of the Ka ̄rtikMa ̄ha ̄tmya of the Skanda Pura ̄n.a that are not reproduced in the Padma Pura ̄n.a’sversion of the text are found elsewhere in the Padma Pura ̄n.a in similar or iden-tical form, and vice versa. During the month of Ka ̄rtik the Ka ̄rtik Ma ̄ha ̄tmyasare recited aloud in homes and temples all over Benares, and it is considered tobe highly meritorious to recite daily a portion the Ka ̄rtik Ma ̄ha ̄tmya in the orig-inal Sanskrit, have it recited by a Brahmin priest, or at least listen to it. Of thetwo versions, that of the Padma Pura ̄n.a is by far the one most popularly recitedin Benares, and it is also the one most familiar to the women with whom I per-formed pu ̄ja ̄throughout the month. Both versions of the Ka ̄rtik Ma ̄ha ̄tmyainclude passages glorifying Ka ̄rtik, explanations of its religious importance,descriptions of ritual practices that should be undertaken during Ka ̄rtik, narra-tive material related to the month and its observances, and passages laudingthose who recite the text or listen to its recitation.The month of Ka ̄rtik is also associated with a month-long votive observanceknown as the Ka ̄rtik vrat(Skt.vrata). Mary McGee describes the term vratas itis generally used in contemporary Hindu culture as referring to “a religiouslysanctioned votive observance, that is, a rite performed at a particular time witha particular desire in mind” (McGee 1987: 17). McGee also notes that central tothe practice ofvratsin contemporary India is the notion ofniyam(Skt.niyama),“rule” or “restriction,” which underscores an emphasis in the vrattradition onpractices that inculcate self-discipline and restraint of the senses (50, 93–5). Inkeeping with this emphasis, the month-long Ka ̄rtik vratincludes a number ofinjunctions for actions and behaviors that are to be upheld throughout the entiremonth and that focus on disciplines and restraints pertaining to the mind, body,and personal conduct.Food restrictions figure prominently in votive observances, and the Ka ̄rtikvrat, too, entails abstention from certain types of food for the entire month,including eggplant, white radish, and certain types of pulses. The key obser-vance of the Ka ̄rtik vrat, however, is Ka ̄rtik sna ̄n(Skt.sna ̄na), daily ritual bathingbefore sunrise in a river or other publicly accessible body of water. In Benaresthe goal for most Ka ̄rtik bathers is the Ganges River. The Ganges is considered athe month of ka ̄rtik and women’s ritual devotions329"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"goddess in liquid form and is held to be a holy river, eternally pure and purify-ing. While bathing in the Ganges at any time of year is thought to be meritori-ous, in Benares the months of Ka ̄rtik, Ma ̄gh, and Vais.a ̄kh are all recognized asespecially meritorious months for daily Ganges bathing.The Benarsis with whom I spoke about Ka ̄rtik and its merits tended to describeKa ̄rtik as a highly auspicious month. Generally speaking, auspiciousness is adesired value in the Hindu tradition associated with well-being and happiness.Ronald Inden lists several Sanskrit terms often translated to mean “auspicious”and describes them as including that which is “pleasant, agreeable, propitious,favorable, salutary, better, fortunate, prosperous, desirable, beautiful, handsome,good, charming, radiant, beneficial – and, yes, auspicious” (Inden 1986: 30).Frederique Marglin’s work on auspiciousness in Hindu culture has emphasizedits connection to fertility, prosperity, happiness, and worldly well-being, valuesgenerally associated with householdership (Marglin 1985). While Inden andMarglin focus on auspiciousness largely as it pertains to worldly pursuits,Vasudha Narayanan further ramifies the discussion by calling for a clear recog-nition of two levels of auspiciousness. In her work on S ́rı ̄Vais.n.avism, she identifies one level of auspiciousness that has to do with everyday life and householder values and pertains to things like prosperity, happiness, or thelongevity of a husband – values that are encompassed under the general rubricof auspiciousness as Marglin describes it. But Narayanan also emphasizesanother level of auspiciousness that encompasses the pursuit of spiritual liber-ation or moks.aand is associated with the life of renunciation (Narayanan1985:62). This second level pertains to the achievement of spiritual advancement,renunciation of the world, and pursuit of the divine.Ka ̄rtik exemplifies and promotes auspiciousness on both of the levels thatNarayanan describes. Much of the symbolism that pervades the month can beinterpreted as conducive to either spiritual or worldly boons, or both, dependingon the devotee, and the line between the two is quite fluid. Many auspiciousness-related images, themes, and practices that permeate the month are not uniqueto Ka ̄rtik, but during the month they assume distinctive forms that uniquely con-textualize auspiciousness while embodying more general themes of auspicious-ness in Hindu culture.5Ka ̄rtik’s auspiciousness is exemplified by the month’s strong association withLakshmi, quintessential goddess of auspiciousness. The full-moon night withwhich Ka ̄rtik begins, S ́arat Pu ̄rn.ima ̄ or “Autumn Full Moon,” marks a festivaldedicated to Lakshmi. This celebration is known as Koja ̄garı ̄, and in Benares, aselsewhere, celebrants perform a special form of worship to Lakshmi and ask forher blessings. The goddess is said to roam the earth on this night asking, “Koja ̄garti?” (“Who is awake?”), and those who remain awake are considered mostlikely to win her blessings. Lakshmi roams the earth again, of course, on Diva ̄lı ̄,an important and well-known festival that takes place at the junction betweenKa ̄rtik’s dark and light fortnights in the middle of the month. Lamps are lit ingreat abundance during Diva ̄lı ̄ to show Lakshmi the path to people’s homes,filling the city with light. Light is popularly associated with Lakshmi: it is a form330tracy pintchman"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"of the goddess, and as such it embodies auspiciousness. The lighting of lamps isactually important throughout the entire month of Ka ̄rtik, however, not just onDiva ̄lı ̄. Every evening throughout the month, small lamps called “sky-lamps” areplaced in baskets and then hoisted to the top of bamboo poles. These sky-lampsare displayed mainly on the gha ̄t.sconstructed along the banks of the Ganges.The Ka ̄rtik Ma ̄ha ̄tmya of the Skanda Pura ̄n.a claims that Lakshmi herself comesto view these lamps throughout the month (7.118–20), and the Dharmasindhuproclaims that by offering sky-lamps during Ka ̄rtik, one obtains Lakshmi, i.e.,auspicious boons associated with Lakshmi, such as wealth, good health, andabundance (205).Light also has esoteric connotations and can be interpreted as symbolic of spiritual processes. One finds such an interpretation of the sky lamps, for example, in a 1995 volume of the booklet, Ra ̄ma ̄nand Praka ̄sh, “The Light of Ra ̄ma ̄nand,” published at S ́rı ̄Mat.h, a Vais.n.ava monastery located atthe Pañcagan.ga ̄Gha ̄t.in Benares. S ́rı ̄Mat.h is home to a number of monks of the Ra ̄ma ̄nanda tradition, a celibate Vais.n.ava order. S ́rı ̄Mat.h is very activeduring Ka ̄rtik and is a major organizational and financial power behind many of Benares’s public Ka ̄rtik celebrations. Here the sky lamps are attributeda spiritual meaning:These lamps hidden inside wicker baskets hanging from bamboo have probablybeen lit for gods. They have become a mediator between people “down below” and“people” “up there.”. . . But heaven is nowhere up there, nor do the gods residesomewhere “up there.”. . . Hanging the lamp in the sky means awakening con-sciousness in one’s mind.. . . These sky lamps are nothing but an effort to elevatethis consciousness. The gods reside only inside us, and whatever good there is inthe outside world is nothing but an expansion of this inner divinity. (32)The lighting of lamps each evening during Ka ̄rtik also occurs in conjunctionwith the worship of Tulsi, the basil plant. Tulsi is specifically associated withVishnu, and Vais.n.avas are bid to maintain a Tulsi plant in their homes during this month in particular, honoring it every evening by burning a small lamp at its base. Tulsi is considered to be an auspicious, purifying, life- and health-enhancing herb, and many informants in Benares advised me to consume it for all manner of ills, from upper respiratory problems to an upset stomach.Tulsi is also considered a goddess, and during Ka ̄rtik she comes to be elevated to the status of God’s bride. In Benares Tulsi’s wedding is performed at the appro-priate time in homes and temples all over the city.Tulsi is wed to her divine groom on the eleventh of Ka ̄rtik’s light fortnight.This day also marks the end of the ca ̄turma ̄sa, a four-month period that is con-sidered to be inauspicious. The ca ̄turma ̄sabegins right after eleventh of the brightfortnight ofs.a ̄d.h, a day known as S ́ayanı ̄Eka ̄das ́ı ̄, “sleeping eleventh.” It isbelieved that on this day Vishnu retires to sleep, floating in a vast ocean on theback of his serpent Ananta. For the duration of his slumber, which lasts for four months, auspicious life-cycle rituals, like marriages, are suspended. the month of ka ̄rtik and women’s ritual devotions331"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"Vishnu awakens on the eleventh of Ka ̄rtik’s bright fortnight, a date known as Prabodhanı ̄Eka ̄das ́ı ̄, “waking eleventh.”6Tulsi’s wedding takes place on thisvery day, not only marking the end of the inauspicious ca ̄turma ̄sa, but also establishing the opening of the marriage season for Hindus in North India. From this day forward until the next S ́ayanı ̄Eka ̄das ́ı ̄, auspicious life-cyclerituals, including marriages, are resumed.The Ka ̄rtik Ma ̄ha ̄tmyas describe the eleventh of Ka ̄rtik’s light fortnight as theday of Tulsi’s marriage to Vishnu, and they enjoin devotees to ritually reenactthe marriage. In this regard, Tulsi acts as a double of Lakshmi, Vishnu’s otherauspicious wife. For the women of Benares, however, Tulsi is wed not to Vishnu,but to Krishna. Such a distinction might at first appear trivial – Krishna andVishnu are, after all, different forms of the same deity, and the female devoteesI interacted with often referred to Krishna, Vishnu, and Ram interchangeably as“Bhagava ̄n” (Lord). While the distinction between Krishna and Vishnu mightnot be terribly important theologicallyin this instance, however, it is quite impor-tantmythologically, for distinctive narrative traditions associated with Krishnacome into play in, and are shaped and transformed by, the particular context ofBenarsi women’s Ka ̄rtik celebrations.Krishna and Ka ̄rtikLike Vishnu, Krishna, too, figures prominently in the month of Ka ̄rtik. Not onlyis daily pu ̄ja ̄to Krishna advocated in the Ka ̄rtik Ma ̄ha ̄tmyas, but various eventsassociated with Krishna’s life are also celebrated and commemorated throughoutthe month. For example, some popular sources associate the day preceding Diva ̄lı ̄with Krishna’s victory over the demon Naraka (e.g., Va ̄la ̄: 157; Gautam: 168).The first day of Ka ̄rtik’s light fortnight marks the celebration of Govardhan pu ̄ja ̄,worship of the lord of Mount Govardhan (Cow-Dung Wealth), a mountainlocated in Braj that is associated with Krishna mythological traditions.7And theeighth of Ka ̄rtik’s light fortnight, Gopa ̄s.t.amı ̄ (Cowherd Eighth), is cited in somecontemporary sources as the day that Krishna began not only to graze cattle inthe forest, but also to slay demons (Bharatı ̄ya ̄ and Ran.vı ̄r: 161; Gautam: 185).Several informants associated the month of Ka ̄rtik with the sum total ofKrishna’s life as a cowherd in Braj, from his birth until his eventual departurefor Dvaraka, even insisting that all the major events of this period of his life tookplace during the month of Ka ̄rtik. This association is reinforced in Benares in aseries of performances occurring during this month that are known as “KrishnaLı ̄la ̄.” These performances take place every evening on Tulsi Ghat beginning onthe twelfth of Ka ̄rtik’s dark fortnight and ending just after the month concludes.The term lı ̄la ̄means “play,” and it encompasses a number of meanings: it refersnot only to theatrical performance, but to Krishna’s “play” in Braj, that is, thesum total of his life from birth until his departure to Dvaraka. Krishna Lı ̄la ̄ reen-acts all the major events of this period of Krishna’s life.8332tracy pintchman"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"One of the most famous images associated with Krishna is that of the ra ̄sa-lı ̄la ̄, the “circle dance,” where Krishna, surrounded by the circle of cowher-desses, or gopı ̄s, in the forest, not only dances with all of them, including Radha,but also multiplies himself many times over so that he can take each one of theminto his intimate embrace. Some contemporary textual sources link Ka ̄rtik withthera ̄sa-lı ̄la ̄episode, citing in particular the night of S ́arat Pu ̄rn.ima ̄, the fullmoon night with which the month begins, as the night that the ra ̄sa-lı ̄la ̄tookplace in ancient times, or locating it during the last day or days of the month(e.g., Underhill 1921: 83; Mukherjee 1989: 210ff; Raghavan 1979: 172). The Devı ̄-Bha ̄gavata Pura ̄n.a maintains that the Ganges herself first appeared in the ra ̄sa-man.d.ala(the dance circle) on the last night of Ka ̄rtik, the night of Ka ̄rtik Pu ̄rn.ima ̄ (full-moon), and remains in the ra ̄sacircle on that night (851; 854–5). Popular traditions in Benares, however, tend to associate the entire month of Ka ̄rtik with the ra ̄sa ̄-lı ̄la ̄episode.Participants in Ka ̄rtik pu ̄ja ̄, the pu ̄ja ̄that Hindu women perform on the banksof the Ganges River throughout the month, consider it to be a version of thera ̄sa-lı ̄la ̄transfigured into a form appropriate for human women and enactedeach year in celebration of the earthly ra ̄sa-lı ̄la ̄of ancient times. The songs sungduring the pu ̄ja ̄tend to invoke the term sakhı ̄or “female friend,” a term used torefer to the gopı ̄companions who accompany and serve Radha and Krishna intheir love play, and in the pu ̄ja ̄circles women refer to themselves and each otherwith the same term. In interviews, several informants compared their role in thepu ̄ja ̄to that of the sakhı ̄sand described themselves as repeating or imitating thesakhı ̄s’ devotions to Krishna.9As one informant explained it,Krishna-jı ̄ did ra ̄swith the sakhı ̄s, and that is why all we sakhı ̄s get together and makeBhagava ̄ n and put Him in the middle....Whatever they did in the past, we aredoing the same thing in the pu ̄ja ̄.Without sakhı ̄s, thispu ̄ja ̄cannot be done....Inreality, we cannot get Lord Krishna himself, so we do this. It is the very same thing(asra ̄s-lı ̄la ̄).Bhagava ̄ n is in the middle of us, and we are doing ra ̄sall around him.We say that we are Krishna’s sakhı ̄sand that we are doing ra ̄s, we are doing his lı ̄la ̄.This informant draws a clear link between the pu ̄ja ̄and the circle danceepisode. It was not uncommon, however, for informants to use the term “ra ̄sa-lı ̄la ̄”to refer not only the specific episode of the ra ̄sa-lı ̄la ̄, but also to Krishna’sentirelı ̄la ̄, his entire playful life on earth, and they understand their role in thepu ̄ja ̄as related to this more expansive sense of the term as well.10Several infor-mants likened their role in the pu ̄ja ̄to that of the gopı ̄s who cared for and playedwith Krishna throughout his many years in Vrindavan. Within Ka ̄rtik pu ̄ja ̄, thisrole takes on a progressive character and concludes in the arrangement and cel-ebration of Krishna’s wedding to Tulsi. Hence while the understanding ofra ̄sa-lı ̄la ̄as the circle dance that facilitates the love-play between Krishna and Radhain the forests of Vrindavan remains, it is here supplemented by a vision of thera ̄sa-lı ̄la ̄as the nurturing of Krishna from childhood to adulthood, a nurturingthat culminates in the fulfillment of parental responsibility through the arrange-ment and execution of his marriage to a socially acceptable wife.the month of ka ̄rtik and women’s ritual devotions333"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"334tracy pintchmanKa ̄rtik Pu ̄ja ̄and Krishna’s Wedding to TulsiWomen who participate in Ka ̄rtik pu ̄ja ̄are Ka ̄rtik vratı ̄s, those observing themonth-long Ka ̄rtik vratby bathing in the Ganges River very early in themorning. Following their morning ablutions, they gather together in groupsalong the gha ̄t.sat the river’s edge. Participants construct several icons, calledmu ̄rtis, out of Ganges clay, including those of Vishnu and Lakshmi, Shiva,Ganesha, Radha-Krishna, Tulsi, the moon-god Candrama, the Sun-god Surya,and the Ganges herself. Forming a circle around the mu ̄rtis, they perform pu ̄ja ̄while singing devotional songs, called bhajans, particular to this occasion.Many deities are represented and honored, but several of the bhajanssungduring the pu ̄ja ̄focus specifically on Krishna, and informants told me that thepu ̄ja ̄itself is largely dedicated to Krishna with the other deities called to bepresent chiefly so that they, too, can participate as devotees. In the first song, thegods are awakened by their consorts so that they can attend the pu ̄ja ̄:Parvatiwakens Shiva, Lakshmi wakens Vishnu, and Radha wakens Krishna. Then whilemaking devotional offerings to all the icons, pu ̄ja ̄participants themselves wakenKrishna with song, inviting him to arise, cleanse himself, and eat his breakfast.A subsequent pu ̄ja ̄song celebrates Krishna’s form, enjoining all the sakhı ̄stofocus their gaze on him and enjoy his physical beauty:11Having bathed and cleaned himself, good Govinda is walking: look at him!He has a golden pot and is offering water: look at him!He is playing a golden flute in his hand: look at him!He has a golden anklet on his ankle and is making a ringing sound with it: lookat him!He has a golden basket, from which he is offering flowers: look at him!He has a shiny, golden sehara ̄12on his head: look at him!Thepı ̄ta ̄mbar13that he is wearing is flapping: look at him!He is chewing pa ̄n14in his mouth: look at him!He has put black eyeliner (ka ̄jal) on his eyes: look at him!He is wearing golden sandals and tapping them: look at him!Oh Krishna, Oh Narayan, take away my worries!Several other bhajanssung specifically to or about Krishna are also included inthepu ̄ja ̄, along with a ̄ratisongs to the Ganges, the sun-deity Suraj, Tulsi,Annadev (the goddess of food), and Shiva.After the main section of the pu ̄ja ̄is completed, participants narrate severaldevotional stories. The first story focuses on Ganesha, Lord of Obstacles, andideally is followed by four other stories, including at least one story related to the particular day in question. Since Friday is associated with the Goddess, forexample, then on Fridays a devotional story related to the Goddess is narrated;on Thursdays, a story related to Vishnu; and so forth. There is no official story-teller in the groups, although some women are more knowledgeable and outgo-ing than others and hence tend to recount more devotional narratives than"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"other women. Stories narrated include, among others, those related to Ka ̄rtik,Tulsi, the Ganges, and Krishna, all of which are of central importance in thepu ̄ja ̄itself.Participants in Ka ̄rtik pu ̄ja ̄consider Krishna to be in child form for the firsthalf of the month. During this period, when the daily pu ̄ja ̄comes to an end, par-ticipants gather together all the clay icons in the cloth on which the pu ̄ja ̄is per-formed. They then swing the baby Krishna, along with all the other deitiesinvolved in the pu ̄ja ̄, offering Krishna milk and singing a special swinging songto pacify him. After this, the clay icons, cloth, and all items offered during thepu ̄ja ̄are immersed in the Ganges River. Most participants remain and sing severalotherbhajansbefore dispersing. The final end of thepu ̄ja ̄is marked with a dec-laration about the auspicious fruits of Ka ̄rtik bathing, chanted in chorus:Ram-ji told us to bathe in Ka ̄ rtik. So we bathe in Ka ̄ rtik. Why? For food (ann), forwealth (dhan), for an ever-filled food storage room (bharal bhan.d.a ̄r), for marital hap-piness (suha ̄g), for going to Heaven (Vaikunth).This basic rhythm defines the course of the pu ̄ja ̄for approximately the first 20days of the month.On the fifth or eighth of Ka ̄rtik’s light fortnight, however, there is a shift. Pu ̄ja ̄participants have a priest come to their pu ̄ja ̄circle to perform Krishna’s janeu ̄, theceremony marking his investiture with the sacred thread, which designatesKrishna’s transformation from child to young man. For this occasion, as for themarriage itself, a brass mu ̄rti(icon) is used in place of the usual clay one. Pu ̄ja ̄participants lovingly bathe Krishna in Ganges water and turmeric, dress him infinery, and sing janeu ̄songs in order to prepare Krishna for his janeu ̄.The priestis then called to utter the mantrasappropriate to the occasion.In some pu ̄ja ̄circles, the swinging song is no longer sung after this point, sinceKrishna is no longer thought to be a child, and there is bawdy joking anddancing on this day as women begin to look forward to the impending marriage.In the pu ̄ja ̄circle that my friend and research assistant, Sunita Singh, attendedin 1997, Krishna’s transition to manhood after the janeu ̄was marked by thereworking of the clay Krishna mu ̄rtifrom a reclining position to a seated one thatexplicitly displayed his newly mature male features, accompanied, apparently,by a good deal of laughter and off-color joking.For several days following the janeu ̄, women sing marriage songs in the pu ̄ja ̄circle before beginning the pu ̄ja ̄itself, marking the impending marriage. Duringthe intervening days, pu ̄ja ̄participants assume the roles of family members on both bride’s and groom’s sides, discussing wedding arrangements, arguingabout dowry, and so forth. Designated participants gather money from the entirepu ̄ja ̄circle to purchase gifts and other necessary items for the wedding as well.A special ritual is then performed on the ninth of Ka ̄rtik’s light fortnight, aspecialvratday known as Aks.aya Navamı ̄, “indestructible ninth.”In Benares, women execute a special pu ̄ja ̄on Aks.aya Navamı ̄, which Ka ̄rtikpu ̄ja ̄participants do right after they have finished the Ka ̄rtik pu ̄ja ̄.Facing the riverthe month of ka ̄rtik and women’s ritual devotions335"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"and the newly risen sun, women use turmeric to draw on the ground a ritualdiagram consisting of thirty squares, called kot.ha ̄.Various offerings are placedin the squares, and a pandit is called over to recite the appropriate mantras. Asonevotaryexplained to me, observers of the vratsymbolically fill up the kot.h.a ̄with spiritual merit, since it is said that any good deed done on this day carrieswith it indestructible merit (hence the name, “indestructible ninth”). Ka ̄rtik pu ̄ja ̄participants, however, use this particular ritual to exchange wedding invitationsamong Ka ̄rtik vratı ̄s. In Benares, some kind of food gift may accompany awedding invitation, especially if you greatly desire the person’s presence at thewedding. After the Aks.aya Navamı ̄pu ̄ja ̄is completed, participating women offereach other prasa ̄dfrom the pu ̄ja ̄as a food gift while orally inviting one anotherto the upcoming wedding.For many Benarsi women, the marriage of Tulsi and Krishna is inextricablywoven into the devotional fabric of Ka ̄rtik of the whole. Some, for example, inter-pret food restrictions associated with the Ka ̄rtik vratas commemorating the fastthat Tulsi undertook in ancient times to attain Krishna as a husband. Oneinformant described the festivities associated with S ́arat Pu ̄rn.ima ̄, the full-moonnight that ushers in the month of Ka ̄rtik, as a celebration of Tulsi’s engagementto Krishna. On this night, it is said that nectar rains down from the moon, andat nighttime many Benarsis place out on their rooftops white foods, especiallykhı ̄r(rice pudding), to catch the nectar. The khı ̄rand other foods are then sharedamong family members the next day as prasa ̄d, a practice that this informantdescribed as sealing Tulsi’s engagement to her future husband. Several inform-ants claimed that Ka ̄rtik pu ̄ja ̄imitates a pu ̄ja ̄that Tulsi herself performed inancient times to win Krishna as a husband. Hence, many pu ̄ja ̄participants inter-pret the entire month of Ka ̄rtik in relation to the marriage of Krishna and Tulsi,and when the day of the marriage finally arrives on the eleventh of Ka ̄rtik’ssecond fortnight, they celebrate it with great fanfare.On the day of the wedding, after concluding the daily pu ̄ja ̄, participants clearand purify a space for the mandap, the marriage pavillion, which is decoratedwith bamboo branches. The groom, represented in this context by a brass mu ̄rti,is brought to thepu ̄ja ̄circle, bathed, and dressed in finery. The bride, a pottedTulsi plant, is also brought to the circle, dressed in a red wedding sari, andadorned with tinsel, small mirrors, and other decorations. Gifts are placed beforethe bride and groom and displayed as dowry offerings, and participants engagein a raucous round ofga ̄lı ̄– abusive, often crudely sexual songs that women singat marriages. As in the janeu ̄, a male pandit is called in briefly to recite the appro-priate mantrasand to collect the dowry items as da ̄n. The participants then sprinklesindu ̄ron the bride’s “head” to mark her new, married status and throwpuffed rice at the newly wed couple.Krishna’s wedding to Tulsi takes place on the eleventh of Ka ̄rtik’s light fort-night, so the full-moon night that marks the end of the month is still several daysaway. In Benares this is the period of the Bhis.mapañcak, the five days ofBhıishma, when large, clay effigies of the hero are made and worshipped on gha ̄t.sall over the city. For many Ka ̄rtik pu ̄ja ̄participants, however, these five days mark336tracy pintchman"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"the month of ka ̄rtik and women’s ritual devotions337the period between Tulsi’s marriage to Krishna and her departure with her newhusband to her sasura ̄l, her in-laws’ house, where the newlyweds are to take upresidence. Most of the pu ̄ja ̄participants with whom I spoke understand thesasura ̄lto be Vaikunth, the Vais.n.ava heaven that is usually associated not withKrishna, but with Vishnu. During this time, women’s daily pu ̄ja ̄continues, butnomu ̄rtisare made; the pu ̄ja ̄is done instead with a plastic or metal box. Thisperiod ends on Ka ̄rtik Pu ̄rn.ima ̄, the full-moon night with which Ka ̄rtik draws toa close. Ka ̄rtik Pu ̄rn.ima ̄ is celebrated with great fanfare in Benares as Deva-Diva ̄lı ̄, the Diva ̄lı ̄ of the gods. As the full moon rises over the Ganges River, thou-sands of lamps light the gha ̄t.sup and down the river along the city’s edge, andboatloads of spectators float along the Ganges’s waters to enjoy the remarkablesight.Women who participate in Ka ̄rtik pu ̄ja ̄interpret the five days from Tulsi’s mar-riage to Ka ̄rtik Pu ̄rn.ima ̄ as related to both the wedding itself and the ensuingsuha ̄gra ̄t, the night on which the marriage is consummated. According to manyinformants, these days mark the period that Krishna and Tulsi spend in the specially prepared Kohabar, a room in the house that is decorated in a specialway for the wedding and set up for wedding-related pu ̄ja ̄.In some Benaras households, newlyweds exchange dahi-gur., yogurt mixed with raw sugar, in the Kohabar of the bride’s natal home after the wedding before departing for thebride’s sasural. I was also told that in parts of Bihar, the groom remains at thebride’s house for nine days, and the suha ̄gra ̄t is celebrated in the Kohabar. Otherinformants insisted that this period had nothing at all to do with the Kohabar:instead, they said, Tulsi is too young to leave for her sasura ̄lat the time of herwedding, so she remains at her natal home until Ka ̄rtik Pu ̄rn.ima ̄, the night ofhergauna, when the bride is ceremoniously brought from her natal home to herhuband’s home. In any case, many informants insisted that Krishna and Tulsi consummate their marriage and depart for Vaikunth on the night of Ka ̄rtikPu ̄rn.ima ̄.Tulsi, Radha, and Realms of AuspiciousnessMany of the women I interviewed in connection with the Ka ̄rtik pu ̄ja ̄insistedboth that Ka ̄rtik is the time ofra ̄sa-lı ̄la ̄with Radha and the gopı ̄sand thatKrishna leaves Radha for the month to spend the time with Tulsi and then marryher, apparently without feeling that these two versions of events might be mutu-ally incompatible. In casual conversation, informants even tended to collapse thetwo into a single goddess and name them interchangeably as Krishna’s blush-ing bride. Nevertheless, songs and stories associated with the pu ̄ja ̄paint a pictureof tension between Radha and Tulsi and describe their competition over Krishna.Consider the following song, for example, which I recorded from the pu ̄ja ̄in1997. In the song, Krishna appears wearing the garb and ornaments of agroom, and Radha becomes suspicious."},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"338tracy pintchmanOh, my heart, worship Krishna.15Laughing, sweet Radha asked, “Krishna, how did that red tilak(auspicious mark)get on your forehead?”Krishna said, “Listen, dear Radha, I got the tilakwhen I went to bathe in theGanges river.”16Laughing, sweet Radha asked, “Krishna, how did that ka ̄jal(eyeliner) get on youreyes?”Krishna said, “Listen, dear Radha, when I picked up a pen, the ink (from the pen)got on my eyes.”Laughing, sweet Radha asked,”Krishna, how did that red color get on yourmouth?”Krishna said, “Listen dear Radha, my friends fed me pa ̄n, and because of that mymouth has gotten red.”17Laughing, sweet Radha asked, “Krishna, how did that red color get on your feet?”Krishna said, “Listen, dear Radha, my heel has become red from walking on ahenna-leaf.”Laughing, sweet Radha asked, “Krishna, how did your dhoti18get yellow?”Krishna said, “The washerman (dhobi) must have changed the dhoti.”When sweet Radha heard these things, she called the washerman immediately.“Listen to what I have to say, Washerman: How is it that Krishna’s dhotigotexchanged for this one?”The washerman said, “Listen, sweet Radha, Krishna and Tulsi have gottenmarried.”When sweet Radha heard these words, she bolted the door from insideKrishna said, “Dear Radha, open the door! Tulsi will be your servant (da ̄sı ̄).”The following song is even more explicit about the tensions between Radha andTulsi:In back of me, there is a Clove tree; cloves fall down from it all night long.My father cut down that clove tree and made a bed frame, and father wove a bedout of silk.The groom Shri Krishna and Queen Rukmini sleep on that bedRadha and Rukmini sleep there, one on each side, and Shri Krishna sleepsbetween them.Radha asks, “I am asking you, Sister Rukmini, what is it that I smell?”Krishna is talking and laughing; Tulsi stands just at his head(Rukmini says,) “That is Tulsi’s fragrance wafting in.”(Radha says,) “If I get a hold of Tulsi now, I will pull her out by the roots, and Iwill throw her into the Ganges River! Then all of my troubles will go away!”(Tulsi says,) “Go ahead, Radha, go to the Ganges River (and throw me in);Krishna will bathe in the river. I will touch Krishna’s feet, and my life will befulfilled (suphal).”(Radha says,) “If I get a hold of Tulsi now, I will pull her out by the roots, and Iwill throw her in the cooking fire. Then all my troubles will go away!”(Tulsi says,) “Okay, go ahead and throw me in the cooking fire. Then I willbecome fire in the month of Ma ̄ gh. In Ma ̄ gh and Pu ̄ s, everyone is cold.19Krishna will warm himself by that fire, and my life will be fulfilled.”"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"The tension between Tulsi and Radha that is exemplified in these songs haslarger symbolic resonances. Krishna’s proper marital relationship to Tulsi, cul-minating in their departure for Vaikunth, forms a symbolic counterpoint to therelationship between Krishna and Radha, whose love-play in Vrindavan is widelyunderstood as always remaining outside the bounds of marriage. In Vrindavan,Krishna is eternally at play, and his erotic sport is not bound by dharmiccon-ventions (Kinsley 1979: esp. 56–121). Vaikunth, on the other hand, whereKrishna and Tulsi are widely believed to go when they leave the earthly realm atthe end of Ka ̄rtik to take up residence as husband and wife, is the domain ofVa i s.n.ava kingship and marriage, both of which are subject to the demands ofdharma. When Krishna marries Tulsi and becomes her proper husband, hecounts Vaikunth, not Vrindavan, as his home. This is the Krishna summoned toBenares in the song with which this chapter begins.In his work on performances of Krishna lı ̄la ̄in Braj, John S. Hawley invokessymbolism of auspiciousness to contrast Vrindavan and Vaikunth (Hawley1983: 305–6). Krishna’s play in Vrindavan, Hawley contends, is the realm ofdispersed auspiciousness, where auspiciousness flows in all directions and is“made available to all who thirst.” Vaikunth, on the other hand, represents therealm of stable auspiciousness, embodied in the goddess Lakshmi – for whomTulsi acts as a “double” in the context of Ka ̄rtik pu ̄ja ̄– and exemplified in themarital relationship. Frédérique Marglin contrasts the playful realm of theyoung Krishna of Vrindavan, which is characterized by sweetness, with the later,princely realm of Krishna’s Dvaraka, which is characterized by sovereignty(Marglin 1985: 195–216). According to Marglin, the eternally lush, forestedbowers of Vrindavan represents a transcendent type of auspiciousness thatnever wanes; this is not true of Dvaraka, however, where auspiciousness is tem-porally bound, and, in accordance with the demands of sovereignty, acquisitionof auspiciousness remains a chief concern. As the divine realm of Vais.n.ava sov-ereignty, Vaikunth is the heavenly counterpart of Dvaraka.In Benarsi women’s Ka ̄rtik celebrations, Vrindavan and Vaikunth, sweetnessand sovereignty, transcendent auspiciousness and temporally bound auspi-ciousness all come together at the Ganges’s edge. The world of Ka ̄rtik pu ̄ja ̄celebrates the youthful Krishna’s Vrindavan lı ̄la ̄and the tasting of dispersed auspiciousness; but it also welcomes the sovereign glory of Vaikunth and the stabilizing of auspiciousness that Krishna’s marriage to Tulsi suggests. While theformer realm embodies sacred ideals pertaining to religious devotion, however,the latter realm reflects and is allied more closely with the concrete, worldly concerns of Hindu women.David Kinsley (1979) has described the nature of Krishna’s play in Vrinda-van as embodying the bliss of the divine realm, a bliss that transcends worldlyconcern. The call of Krishna’s flute to summon the gopı ̄s, Kinsley notes, “caresnothing for this world and its moral and social laws.. . . It comes from anotherworld where this-wordly morality and conduct have no place” (99–100). Suchperceptions of the divine permeate the world of Ka ̄rtik pu ̄ja ̄, where participantsassume the role of the sakhı ̄s and, in their hearts, frolic with Krishna on thethe month of ka ̄rtik and women’s ritual devotions339"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"banks of the Ganges. Yet the devotional realm of Krishna’s carefree sport is farremoved from the realm of real human relations that tend to occupy the spaceof Hindu women’s lives. Krishna’s marriage to Tulsi, celebrated so enthusiasti-cally on the banks of the Ganges, reflects the world of values and conventionsthat shape and inform human conjugal relations. When Krishna comes toBenares to adorn his new bride with the ornaments of a suhagin, a properlymarried woman, he enters that world.In her analysis of women’s symbols, Caroline Walker Bynum notes thatwomen’s images and symbols tend to continue or enhance women’s ordinaryexperience rather than break with that experience (Walker 1996: 74). Theimagery surrounding Krishna and Tulsi that is invoked in the pu ̄ja ̄– raisingKrishna to marriageable age, then arranging and participating in his weddingto Tulsi – has deep social resonance for Hindu women, whose lives revolve to agreat extent around their roles as brides, wives, and mothers. The child Krishnafrolics eternally in Vrindavan; yet the sons and daughters of women who par-ticipate in Ka ̄rtik pu ̄ja ̄grow up, and when they do, their weddings have to bearranged. The erotic love play between Radha and Krishna expresses the yearn-ing of the soul for intimacy with the Divine; yet human women marry, and whenthey do, they yearn for a proper husband with whom they can share the earthlyjoys of marriage and family. Like Tulsi, many of the married women in Benareswho participate in the pu ̄ja ̄were also carried off after marriage to an uncertainfuture in their in-laws’ house; their daughters, similarly, grow up and leave theirnatal homes to take up residence in their husbands’ villages and towns. KirinNarayan observes that in Kangra, Himachal Pradesh, where Tulsi’s weddingduring Ka ̄rtik is also performed, some women make an explicit link betweenTulsi’s life and the lives of human women, identifying Tulsi’s marriage and sub-sequent uprooting with human women’s marriage and departure for the in-law’s house (Narayan 1997: 37). In Benares, too, the marital drama unique towomen’s Ka ̄rtik traditions is continuous with the norm of women’s lives, repre-senting in ideal form the marital and parental destiny of numerous Hinduwomen in contemporary India.Notes1The epithet used here for Krishna is “Mohan Rasiya ̄ .” The epithet “Mohan” indi-cates Krishna’s nature as divine “enchanter.” The epithet “Rasiya ̄ ” points to hisnature as an “enjoyer” or “taster” of the emotions associated with devotion. Eachline of song text is repeated twice. In this chapter, all songs are translated in waysthat emphasize clarity of meaning, not literal accuracy.2This chapter is based on a larger book project currently in process.

In addition, since the lunar yearis about ten days shorter than the solar year, an intercalary month is inserted intothe lunar year every two to three years to correct the discrepancy. When thishappens the month of Ka ̄ rtik can fall quite a bit later than it does in years that arenot intercalated.4Skanda Pura ̄n.a 2.4.1–36; Padma Pura ̄n.a 6.88–6.117.5For more on Ka ̄ rtik and auspiciousness, see Pintchman 1999.6For more on the ca ̄turma ̄sa, see McGee 1987: 729–31 and 774–8.

See Kinsley 1979, especiallychapter three (122–204), and Haberman 1988.10In John S. Hawley’s research on ra ̄sa-lı ̄la ̄performances in Braj, the term ra ̄sa-lı ̄la ̄isalso used to indicate both the ra ̄sa-lı ̄la ̄episode itself and the entire lı ̄la ̄of Krishna’slife enacted in liturgical drama. See Hawley 1981 and 1983, chs. 6 and 7.11Kinsley notes an emphasis on bodily appearance in Krishna devotion (1979: 77):“In every Vais.n.ava-Krishna work, be it devotional, poetic, or theological, Krishna’sphysical appearance is doted upon.. . . The attitude of the devotee should be likethat of the gopı ̄who cursed the creator for having given her eyelids that preventedher seeing Krishna constantly.”12The sehara ̄is a type of headpiece that grooms wear at the time of the wedding. Themention of the sehara ̄here suggests Krishna’s upcoming wedding.13Pı ̄ta ̄mbaris a type of yellow garment associated especially with Krishna.14Pa ̄nis a mixture of betel nut, spices, and other additives rolled up in a betel leaf andchewed for enjoyment. Benares is particularly known for its excellent pa ̄n.15Bhaju man Govinda, bhaju Gopa ̄l. This refrain repeats throughout the song. Forstylistic reasons, however, I have chosen to omit the repetitions.16Krishna here is indicating that a pujari(a ritual functionary) residing on the banksof the Ganges River put the tilakon his forehead.17Chewing pa ̄nreleases a red-colored juice that stains whatever it touches, especiallythepa ̄n-chewer’s mouth and teeth.18A dhotiis a type of cloth that is wound around the hips; one end is passed betweenthe legs and tucked in at the waist. The implication here is that Krishna is wearinghispı ̄ta ̄mbar, a garment that the song implies is suitable for a groom to wear.19These are the months falling from roughly mid-December to mid-February.the month of ka ̄rtik and women’s ritual devotions341"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"ReferencesBharatı ̄ya ̄, Ru ̄ pakis ́or and Ka ̄rs.n.i Ran.vı ̄r Brahamaca ̄rı ̄. 1974.

Both sciencesinclude, along with the notion of rule, those ofparibha ̄s.a ̄or “metarule,” that is,a rule about rules; and ofrule order, a requirement often formulated by meansof a metarule of the form “Rule A precedes Rule B.” A simple example from ritualis that the rules about lighting the ritual fire precede those that describe howoblations are made into it.Some of the early discoveries of ritualists and grammarians anticipate rulesor techniques in modern linguistics, logic, mathematics or computer science. Anexample is the notion ofdefault. The ritualA ̄pastamba S ́rauta Su ̄tra (24.1.23–6)singles out default options for oblations, priests, and implements. It specifies thatthe default oblation is clarified butter; the default priest, the Adhvaryu; and thedefault implement, the juhu ̄ladle. There are degrees of default: when the juhu ̄isalready used, and no other implement is specified, the oblation is made with thehelp of the sruva. The notion of multiple default echoes or is echoed by Pa ̄n.ini’smetarule 2.3.1 which deals with ka ̄rakaor syntactic relations: “(the followingrules apply) when it [i.e., the ka ̄raka] is not (already) expressed.”Using metarules and rule order, the ritual and grammatical systems expressrecursiveness, that is, they describe an infinite domain of facts with the help of afinite number of rules. Pa ̄n.ini’s commentator Patañjali compares the expressionsof language to rituals of infinite duration and explains (by telling a story aboutBr.haspati, Professor of the Gods, trying to teach Sanskrit to Indra) why anattempt to enumerate all the forms of language can never reach an end. He con-cludes that “a work containing rules has to be composed.”Rules can only operate on units that are clearly demarcated. This requirementwas met in the oral transmission of the Vedas: for Vedic mantras are recited in"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"one breath, the caesura at the end being marked by a pause or the particle iti.Vedic Brahmins continue to the present day to recite mantrasin this manner. Ritualists and reciters generally do not know – and need not know – theirmeaning; but they know their precise formalong with their accents and modesof recitation which incorporate a good measure of linguistic analysis.For the Vedas to be orally transmitted, its sentences were analysed “word-for-word.” This is not easy because Sanskrit possesses sandhior “junction” (literally“putting together”). Sandhi is common in spoken English but uncommon inwriting where, for example: the indefinite article “a” is replaced by “an” when avowelfollows so that we have: “abook” but “anapple.” (The rule could be formulated the other way round depending on what is taken to be the defaultoption: “an” is replaced by “a” when aconsonantfollows.) In Sanskrit, sandhiisall-pervasive, for example:orvapra ̄ amartya ̄ nivato devyudvatah.(Rigveda10.127.2)“The immortal Goddess has pervaded wide space, depths and heights”The CONTINUOUS RECITATION of this mantrais called sam.hita ̄-pa ̄t.ha(the wordfor “continuous”, sam.hita ̄, is related to sandhi, and pa ̄t.hameans “recitation”).The WORD-FOR-WORD ANALYSIS, called padapa ̄t.ha(frompada“word”), is:a ̄ / uru / apra ̄h./ amartya ̄ / ni-vatah./ devı ̄ / ut-vatah.//(“per / wide / vaded / immortal / depths / goddess / heights”)This analysis goes deeper than words: the “pre-verb” a ̄is separated from the verbapra ̄h.(in the translation: “per” from “vaded”). Later rules express sandhitrans-formations, e.g.:a ̄+uru>oruuru +apra ̄h.>urvapra ̄h.,where the arrow “>” may be read as: “has to be replaced by”, “changes into,” or“becomes.”Generalizations of such rules are the su ̄traswith which the linguistic study of language or “grammar” (vya ̄karan.a) began. I shall subdivide its history intofour parts or periods: (1) PADAPA ̄T.HA or “word-for-word” analysis; (2)PRA ̄TIS ́A ̄KHYA or treatises that formalize these procedures; (3) PA ̄N.INI; and (4)LATER SCHOOLS.1 Padapa ̄t.haThe first system we know of is S ́a ̄kalya’s Padapa ̄t.haof the Rigveda but it containsideas and techniques that may go back to an older period (also preserved in thethe science of language349"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"Iranian Avesta). The Padapa ̄t.ha “word-for-word” analysis separated words andother elements, insuring their proper pronunciation, including accents (whichI omit from our discussion) and orally fixed the corpus or “text” thus contribut-ing to canon formationduring the late Vedic period in eastern India (Videhaaround 600–500 bc).There are several stages in the development of this analysis which depict agradual extension or generalization, i.e., scientific progress. At first the separa-tion between words or stems and suffixes was marked by a brief pause in therecitation as in the above example from Rigveda10.127.2 or in r.s.i-bhih., “by theseers.” This method was extended to nominal compounds: saptaputram >sapta-putram “seven sons.” It was called avagraha, “separation” and we express it by ahyphen though no writing was known in India at this period. Since “separation”was used in each analysis only once, a problem arose: many compounds consistof more than two members.S ́a ̄kalya’s solution was inspired by semantics: das ́apramatı ̄mis analyzed asdas ́a-pramatı ̄m“ten protectors” (i.e., fingers), not das ́apra-matı ̄mwhich wouldcorrespond to the equally meaningless “tenpro-tectors.” More complex caseswere taken care of with the help of two other methods of analysis: pragraha,“marking,” e.g., saptaputram iti; and parigraha, “marking-and-separation,” e.g.,saptaputram iti sapta-putram.The Padapa ̄t.ha is an analysis of theSam.hita ̄pa ̄t.haor “continuous recitation,”but by isolating words from each other, it facilitated the opposite of what wasintended: the forgettingof single words. Special patterns of repetition or vikr.tiswere constructed to minimize this risk. The question arises whether these pro-cedures were prescriptiveordescriptive– a relevant question for the historian ofscience since science is presumably descriptive. How can we find out?If we represent the words of the Sam.hita ̄pa ̄t.ha as: 1 2 3 4. . . and thePadapa ̄t.ha as: 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 /..., the next two vikr.tivariations may be repre-sented as follows:Kramapa ̄t.ha“Step-by-step recitation”: 1 2 / 2 3 / 3 4 / . . .Jat.a ̄pa ̄t.ha“Plaited recitation”: 1 2 / 2 1 / 1 2 / 2 3 / 3 2 / 2 3 / . . .TheKramapa ̄t.hadoes not introduce any new sandhicombinations: all its expres-sions belong to the Vedic Sam.hita ̄ and are a ̄rs.a, i.e., they were used by the “seers”(r.s.i); but the Jat.a ̄pa ̄t.ha(called after plaited or matted hair) introduces “2 1” and“3 2” which are reversals of the original order: they introduce something thatwas not in the Veda and therefore “not from the seers” (ana ̄rs.a).TheKramapa ̄t.haof the first words of our first example of Sanskrit sandhiisstraightforward:a ̄+uru / uru +apra ̄h./ apra ̄h.+amartya ̄>oru / urvapra ̄h./ apra ̄ amartya ̄/...TheJat.a ̄pa ̄t.hais plaited. It begins: a ̄+uru +uru +a ̄+a ̄+uruwhich becomes:orvurvoru – a real tangle. Worse, it contains an element that does not come fromthe Sam.hita ̄ of the Vedic seers: uru +a ̄>urva ̄. However, urva ̄is not an artificial350frits staal"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"prescription because the reciters describe the regular form that would result fromuru followed bya ̄in their ordinary speech, that is, the contemporary Sanskritthey spoke and were familiar with. The form urva ̄, which happens to be absentfrom the finite corpus of the Vedas, is grammatical: it belongs to the infinitelymany expressions of language that a native speaker is able to produce. The so-calledana ̄rs.aforms, then, which do not come from the Vedas, are Sanskrit anddescriptive. They are, in fact, the precursors of Pa ̄n.ini’s description of a form ofthe spoken language that he regarded as exemplary.2Pra ̄tis ́a ̄khyaThe practice of the Padapa ̄t.ha was formalized in the Pra ̄tis ́a ̄khyacompositions,in principle one for each s ́a ̄kha ̄or “Vedic school.” The earlier name pa ̄rs.adasug-gests that they belonged to a community (paris.ad) which orally transmitted anddiscussed the contents of their s ́a ̄kha ̄. The relationship between continuous recita-tionandword-for-wordanalysis is expressed ambiguously by the Sanskrit sen-tencepadaprakr.tih.sam.hita ̄which may be taken to mean: “The Sam.hita ̄ is the baseof the Pada” or: “The Sam.hita ̄ has the Pada as its base.” The Pra ̄tis ́a ̄khyagener-ally adopt the second interpretation, puzzling from a historical perspective, butsignalling a return to the original composers who put words together in theirinspired speech just as any user of language puts words together when speak-ing or writing. This illustrates that Indian grammarians regarded language asunchanging, an erroneous assumption which led, however, to the linguisticallyproductivesynchronicanalysis that was advocated in Europe more than two mil-lennia later by Ferdinand de Saussure.ThePra ̄tis ́a ̄khyasare early because of their structure and function, notbecause of the forms that survive and may have been influenced by Pa ̄n.ini orother grammarians. Their original aim was completeness. Whitney noted on asection ofTaittirı ̄ya Pra ̄tis ́a ̄khya that he could not discover any case of a retroflexnasal arising in the Taittirı ̄ya Sam.hita ̄from a dental nasal in the Taittirı ̄yaPadapa ̄t.ha“that was not duly provided for.” Weber used the term “complete”(vollständig) and a century later, Surya Kanta called the Rik-Pra ̄tis ́a ̄khya “entirelyfree from all oversights.” To be complete is only possible when we deal with afinitecorpus ofutterances, (copies of) unique events in space and time such asthe extent of a Vedic s ́a ̄kha ̄.A living language consists ofsentenceswhich cannotbe enumerated because they are infinite in number as Patañjali knew. Follow-ing Suryakanta, we postulate that the Pra ̄tis ́a ̄khyas originally produced exhaus-tive listings (gan.as) of examples, showing patterns of linguistic structure, andproceeded only later to generalizations explained by su ̄trarules. This dichotomyof ideal types does not always survive in the texts as they have come down to usbecause these have been influenced by Pa ̄n.ini or other grammarians.ThePra ̄tis ́a ̄khyas introduced the metalinguistic use of case-endings, at firstthe Nominative and Accusative as formulated by the metarule:”the expression‘this (Nom.) that (Acc.)’ means ‘becoming-that’ with reference to the soundthe science of language351"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"which stands nearest to it” (Rik Pra ̄tis ́a ̄khya1.14); and later simply as: “a changeis expressed as an Accusative” (Va ̄jasaneyi Pra ̄tis ́a ̄khya 1.133).The Padapa ̄t.ha discovered the differences between sentences, words, stems,pre- and suffixes, roots, etc., but the Pra ̄tis ́a ̄khya added an almost perfect ana-lysis of the sounds of language into vowels, consonants, semi-vowels, stops,dentals, velars, nasals, etc. They placed these sounds in a two-dimensional con-figuration, developed from the square or varga offive-by-five series (also calledvarga) of syllables that begin with a stop followed by a short a:kakhagaghan.acachajajhañat.at.had.ad.han.atathadadhanapaphababhama(1)These sounds are marked in our modern transcription by diacritics which weneed because our alphabet cannot express all the sounds of Sanskrit. It is notnecessary for the reader to know how exactly they are pronounced (but seebelow); however, we need to know that all the vowels ain the syllables of thetable are short(like the first aofapra ̄h.). A bar above a vowel (like the second aofapra ̄h.) indicates that it is long, that is, lasts twice as long as the short.The 5 ¥5varga“square” was extended and completed with fricatives or sibi-lants, semi-vowels and vowels. One should not look upon the resulting inventoryas the beginningof linguistics or compare it to our haphazard “ABC’s” to whichthere is no rhyme or reason. Like Mendelejev’s Periodic System of Elements, thevarga system was the result of centuries of analysis. In the course of that devel-opment the basic concepts of phonology were discovered and defined.In the mentalrepresentation of a such a square, it does not matter what is itsspatial orientation and whether vargadenotes a row or a column. The configura-tion remains the same when the square is rotated around its diagonal. Proximityand distance are also the same whatever the direction. Since two directions aremet with, this shows that these squares were composed and transmitted orally.Renou and Filliozat (1953: 668) had already made a more significant generalobservation: “One is forced to observe in this context that a Semitic type of writingwould have hindered phonetic studies if it had existed at the time in India, becauseit would have provided a model of analysis of the sounds of language that waspractical but not scientific.” The Indian science of language, in other words, didnot originate in spite ofthe absence of writing but becauseof it.3Pa ̄n.iniThe “Eight Chapters” (As.t.a ̄dhya ̄yı ̄) of Pa ̄n.ini’s grammar of Sanskrit (early to midfourth century bc) consist of rules, metarules, and defining rules. In the area of352frits staal"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"phonology, they are sometimes similar or almost the same as some Pra ̄tis ́a ̄khyarules, e.g., the definition of “homorganic”:(Homorganic is) having the same place, producing organ, and effort ofarticulation in the mouth.(2)Here “place” refers to “throat,” “palate,” “teeth,” etc., “producing organ” means“tip of the tongue,” “rolling back the tip of the tongue,” “tip of the teeth,”“middle of the jaw,” etc. “Effort of articulation” refers to “closed,” “semi-closed,”“open,” etc. – all Pra ̄tis ́a ̄khya concepts. Pa ̄n.ini (or earlier grammarians eclipsedby him) added to the study of phonology that of morphology, syntax and seman-tics. Pa ̄n.ini then freed himself from the notion of a finite corpus like that of theVedic mantras, and began to treat Sanskrit as a creative and infinite energeia inthe sense in which that Greek concept is now associated with von Humboldt orChomsky.Pa ̄n.ini started his grammar with a new classification of sounds, the result ofan at first sight surprising overhaul of the Pra ̄tis ́a ̄khya classification. He replacedthe two-dimensional varga system by a linear sequence, later called the S ́ivasu ̄tra:a i u N./ r.l.K / e o N./ ai au C /ha ya va ra T./ la N./ ña ma n.a n.a na M / jha bha Ñ / gha d.ha dha S./ ja ba ga d.a da S ́/ kha pha cha t.ha tha cat.a ta V / ka pa Y / s ́a s.a sa R / ha L //(3)The sounds I have expressed here by small letters are the sounds of the Sanskritobject-language. They consist of vowels and consonants (including semivowels),the latter followed by a short a. Capitals are part of the metalanguage: they referto metalinguistic markers to which I will return. The five vowels with which (3)starts may be long or short (r.andl.in their short form sound approximately likeryin “crystal” and liin “Clinton”).Pa ̄n.ini used short vowels (a, etc.) to refer to both short and long vowels (aanda ̄, etc.) because of an important generalization that he would otherwise miss. Ithappens to be a fact about Sanskrit (and some other languages) that many rulesof grammar that apply to vowels, apply to them whether they are long or short.For example, a+a,a+a ̄,a ̄+aanda ̄+a ̄, all become long a ̄(e.g., atra +agni >atra ̄gni“here, Agni!”, va ̄+agni >va ̄gni“or Agni,” etc.).To express this by four rules would not only be unwieldy; it would be unnat-ural for it would fail to express a generalization that captures a feature of thelanguage. Pa ̄n.ini, therefore, uses in his metalanguagea single vowel to express theshort and long forms ofthe object language. This enables him to express by a singlerule of the form “a+a>a ̄”, all four combinations of long and short. He gener-alizes further, because this lenghtening applies to the other vowels: e.g., the iindadhi+indra >dadhı ̄ndra (“milk, Indra!”). We shall see in a moment how heexpressed these facts.What happens to grammatical rules that apply to a short or long vowel only?Pa ̄n.ini marks them with Tin accordance with metarule (4):the science of language353"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"A vowel followed by Tdenotes its own length.(4)This means: “aT” denotes a, “a ̄T” denotes a ̄, “uT” denotes u, etc.Ka ̄tya ̄yana, another early grammarian, objected to (4), that “long” and“short” are merely habits of speech: some people speak fast and others slow.Patañjali retorted that this objection pertains to dhvani, “speech sound,” not tothe subject matter of linguistics which is sphot.a, the meaningful unit of expres-sion. Patañjali is right because, in Sanskrit, as in many other languages, the dif-ference between short and long may affect meaning. Patañjali’s concept ofsphot.ais concerned with competenceof the language; speakers’ habits such asrapid or slow speech belong to the psychological domain ofperformance. This isone of several cases where rules of Pa ̄n.ini’s grammar have logical, psychologi-cal, or philosophical implications.We are ready to return to the metalinguistic “indicatory markers” indicatedby the capitals “N.,” “K,” “N.,” etc. in (3). Their use is explained by metarule (5):An initial sound joined to a final (indicatory) sound (denotes theintervening sounds as well).(5)Thus, aN.denotes “a i u,” aK denotes “a i u r.l.,” iK denotes “i u r.l.,” yaN.denotes “ya va ra la,” and aC denotes vowels. The expression aN.may denote “ai u” or the class of all vowels and semivowels because the indicatory marker “N.”occurs twice as the reader will have noted. I shall not discuss whether this is aflaw or a particular merit of the system but Patañjali and other commentatorspay plenty of attention to such problems. They do not assume that Pa ̄n.ini wasperfect and reject what he said if they find that it contradicts the data or doesnot work.Pa ̄n.ini needs the notations aN., aK, yaN.etc. as elements of his artificial lan-guage, because phonology requires many combinations of sounds that cannotbe simply or naturally expressed in the varga system of (1) or in any form of (3)without metalinguistic markers. The notations of (5) enable him to express howtwo vowels combine into a single long one as follows:aK is lengthened when followed by a homorganic vowel.(6)Another rule is needed to express the fact that the vowels i,u,r.andl.arereplaced by the semivowels y,v,randl, respectively, when followed by a het-erorganic (i.e., nonhomorganic) vowel: e.g., dadhi+atra >dadhyatra(“milkhere!”),madhu+atra >madhvatra(“honey here!”), etc. (compare the contrast inEnglish between pennilessandpenny arcade). Using (5), Pa ̄n.ini’s first step mayhave been to formulate this fact as: “iK is replaced by yaN.when a heterorganicaC follows.” But “heterorganic” is omitted by default because (5) already tookcare of the homorganic cases.Why does dadhi+atrabecomesdadhyatraand not *dadhvatra? I have expressedit by using the English term “respectively.” Pa ̄n.ini uses a metarule:354frits staal"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"Reference to elements of the same number is in the same order.(7)Therefore, i>y,u>v, etc., but not, e.g., i>v. The rule we need may now beexpressed as:iK is replaced by yaN.when aC follows.(8)Expressions such as these are extremely common. Most phonological rules, andmany others, are of the form:After A, in the place of B, substitute C, when D follows.(9)Pa ̄n.ini expresses this formula and captures this generalization about languageby introducing an artificial expression that makes metalinguistic use of the casesof the Sanskrit of his object language, a method inspired by Sanskrit usage andintroduced by the Pra ̄tis ́a ̄khyas as we have seen. Pa ̄n.ini’s starting point is thesubject of the rule, i.e., the element which is substituted and therefore expressedby the Nominative Case. The metalinguistic uses of three other Cases are laiddown by three metarules which refer to the Genitive, Locative, and AblativeCases:The Genitive case ending is used for that in the place of which (some-thing is substituted);when something is referred to by the Locative ending, (the substituteappears) in the place of the preceding element;when (something is referred to) by the Ablative ending, (the substituteappears in the place) of the following.(10)Applying these rules, Pa ̄n.ini formulates (9) as:A+Ablative ending, B +Genitive ending, C +Nominative ending, D+Locative ending.(11)Applying this to the sandhi rule we have been discussing, where there is norestriction on the left so that there is no need for the Ablative ending, we arriveat:iK+Genitive, yaN.+Nominative, aC +Locative,which in Sanskrit becomes:ikah.yan.acito which sandhi is applied, producing the actual rule as it occurs in Pa ̄n.ini’sgrammar:the science of language355"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"iko yan.aci.(12)As it happens, a language consists of sentences, not just of words. From theperspective of the history of science, therefore, Pa ̄n.ini’s step is momentousbecause it resulted not just in the creation of artificial expressions but of an artificial metalanguage. Rule (12) is not merely an artificial expression but anelement of an artificial language like the artificial languages of algebra thatcame into being much later through Arab and European efforts. Pa ̄n.ini demon-strates in passing that artificial languages need not be written.Patañjali refers to Pa ̄n.ini’s first step of generalization by declaring: “thisscience pertains to all the Vedas” or “this science is a Par s.ad=Pra ̄tis ́a ̄khya forall the Vedas” (sarvavedapa ̄ris.adam idam s ́a ̄stram). Actually, Pa ̄n.ini’s Vedic rulesare haphazard and incomplete while his rules for the spoken language are almostperfect, if not in syntax, at least in phonology and morphology. Claims like thesesound like cheap commercials but are substantiated by comparing his grammarwith linguistic usage as we know it. It is sometimes said that “Pa ̄n.ini was, ofcourse, aided in his analysis by the extraordinary clarity of the Sanskrit lan-guage,” but John Brough observed: “We are apt to overlook the possibility thatthis structure might not have seemed so clear and obvious to us if Pa ̄n.ini hadnot analysed it for us.”The perfection of Pa ̄n.ini’s grammar is not only due to its high degree of for-malization. His science is as empirical as it is formal. The locus classicus on theimportance of empirical description is the laconic expression lokatah.“on accountof (the usage) of the people.” “The people” are the native speakers as illustratedby Patañjali: “He who needs a pot for some purpose goes to the house of a potterand says: ‘You make a pot. I need a pot for some purpose.’ No one who wants touse words goes to the house of a grammarian and says: ‘You make words. I wantto use them.’ (On the contrary,) having brought something to mind, withoutfurther ado, he uses words.”4 Later SchoolsPatañjali’s “Great Commentary” of around 150 bcseems to have been followedby a lull of several centuries. In the fifth century ad, the great grammaticalphilosopher Bhartr.hari broke the silence by composing an original subcom-mentary on Patañjali. By that time, Jainas and Buddhists had also begun to useSanskrit for their canonic writings and this resulted in several new grammars,at first practical manuals, but increasingly systematical and scientific treatises.Devanandin and Candragomin, Jaina and Buddhist grammarians, respectively,also of the fifth century, adopted Pa ̄n.ini’s system and metalanguage and soughtto simplify or abbreviate his expressions, sometimes introducing innovations.Candragomin refers to Middle-Indic forms that had been used in earlier Buddhist356frits staal"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"writings as a ̄rs.a, “belonging to the seers,” just as the Pra ̄tis ́a ̄khya authors haddone with respect to Vedic mantras.A later development of Sanskrit grammar benefited from the “new logic”(navya nya ̄ya) that had originated in Bengal with Ganges ́opa ̄dhya ̄ya (thirteenthcentury). This development continued, at least, through the eighteenth centurywhen Na ̄gojı ̄ Bhat.t.a wrote a treatise on Pa ̄n.ini’s metarules and philosophicalworks in which he combines Bhartr.hari with the Indian philosophy of language– a discipline not included in the present sketch.Grammatical concepts and techniques from the Sanskrit tradition influencedthe early (second century bc?) grammar of Tamil Tolka ̄ppiyam which is, in otherrespects, very different in outlook and structure. Sanskrit models were followedmore closely in later Dravidian grammars as well as grammars of Persian,Marathi, and other languages. Tibetan grammars were inspired by the Sanskrittradition but it took almost 500 years (from the ninth to the fourteenth centuryad) before they fully captured the power and sophistication of the Indianoriginals.The Indian grammatical tradition influenced not only a few grammarians butmuch of Asian civilization. We have seen that the first scientific classification ofthe sounds of language, that of the vargasysem of the Pra ̄tis ́a ̄khyas, was due toanoralanalysis. It is not surprising that this classification was taken into accountwhen the first Indian scripts evolved, but it went much further and served, formillennia to come, as a sound foundation for most of the numerous scripts andwriting systems of south, southeast and east Asia – from Kharosthi, Khotanese,Tibetan, Nepali, and all the modern scripts of India (except the Urdu/Persian) toSinhalese, Burmese, Khmer, Thai, Javanese, and Balinese. In south and south-east Asia, the shapesof earlier Indian syllables inspired some of these inventions,but it is the systemof classification that was of enduring significance whereverit became known. In east Asia, the bastion of Chinese characters could not adaptit; but in Japan it led to the creation of the hiraganaandkatakanasyllabariesduring the Heian period (794–1185), and in Korea it inspired the world’s mostperfect script, han’gul, developed in 1444 by a committee of scholars appointedby the emperor Sejong. All these Asian scripts are a far cry from the haphazardjumble of the “ABC” and the countless spelling problems that result from it inEnglish and other modern languages that use the alphabet.The Indian Science of Language influenced modern linguistics primarilythrough Franz Bopp (1791–1867) who was inspired by the Sanskrit grammarof Charles Wilkins of 1807, based in turn upon Pa ̄n.ini. But Bopp did not userulesand the celebrated nineteenth-century sound laws were discovered byothers. That rules could be formal had been discovered by Aristotle but remainedconfined to logic. The equations of algebra, another formal science from Asia,were restricted to mathematics and the natural sciences. That linguistics could be a formal science was perceived, or at least envisaged, by de Saussure,who predicted in 1894, that the expressions of linguistics “will be algebraic orwill not be.” Leonard Bloomfield was familiar with Pa ̄n.ini and used ordered rules once (Menomini Morphonemics of 1939). Formal rules were used the science of language357"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"extensively by Noam Chomsky and his school, and finally replaced by moreabstract principles.In classical India, “the arrangement of forms and speculation on forms revealmost clearly their content – they ultimately are the content itself.” I translatethis phrase from Charles Malamoud who adopted it from Louis Renou, the fore-most twentieth-century scholar of ancient Indian civilization. Attention to formis a characteristic of all science and even the Mı ̄ma ̄m.sa ̄ system of ritual philos-ophy declares: “when a visible result is possible, it is improper to postulate aninvisible one” (Mı ̄ma ̄m.sa ̄ Paribha ̄s.a ̄).To the modern age, the most important contribution of the Sanskrit gram-matical tradition is its construction of linguistics as a formal science. The studyof language, the most characteristic feature of the human animal, is as formalas that of the so-called natural sciences. The need of an artificial, formal lan-guage shows that natural language is unable to express adequately the struc-tures not only of the nonhuman universe but also those of human languageitself. When linguistics is an exact science, the distinction between human andnatural sciences falls to the ground and it becomes far-fetched to assert thathumans stand isolated in the universe – a postulate that has never been popularin India.BibliographyBoehtlingk, Otto. 1887.

We can only gather scattered terms for whole numbers, for basicfractions, and for simple geometric figures.TheR.gveda contains a number of numerical expressions. The Vedic poets wereparticularly fond of three and seven as holy numbers, and often used their mul-tiples such as 3 ¥7, 33 (=3¥11), 3 ¥50, 3 ¥60, 3 ¥70, 3 ¥7¥70, and 333(=3¥111). It has been argued that the number of gods, 3339, mentioned inR.gveda 3.3.9, is the sum of three numbers, namely, 33, 303, and 3003.Although it has not been proved that the Vedic Indians had a place-value nota-tion of numbers, this summation itself must have not been difficult for themsince their numeration system was basically decimal. They used the words eka,das ́a,s ́ata,sahasra, and ayuta, for 1, 10, 102, 103, and 104. For multiples of 103and of 104they often used expressions based respectively on 102and on 103aswell; for example, 2 ¥103=20 (vím.s ́ati)¥102(s ́ata), 3 ¥104=30 (trim.s ́at)¥103(sahasra), etc. The words for “hundred” and “thousand” are sometimesemployed in the sense of “a number of.” Thus, Indra is said to have destroyed ahundred old fortresses of S ́ambara and slain a hundred thousand (s ́atam.sahas-ram.) brave men of Varcin (ibid. 2.14.6). The number sixty seems to have had acertain weight with the Vedic poets since we come across expressions like “athousand and sixty (1060) cows” (ibid. 1.126.3), “sixty thousand and ninety-nine (60099) kings” (ibid. 1.53.9), and “sixty thousand ayuta (60¥103¥104=6¥108) of horses” (ibid.8.46.22), but its significance is not known."},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"There are also references in the R.gveda to the basic unit-fractions 1/2 (ardhaor “a half ”), 1/4 (pa ̄daor “a foot,” from the 4 “feet” of a quadruped), 1/8 (s ́aphaor “a hoof,” from the 8 “hooves” of a cow), and 1/16 (kala ̄or “a digit,” from the16 “digits” of the moon).The Vedic people seem not to have felt much difficulty in performing the addi-tion, subtraction, and, perhaps, multiplication of whole numbers, but divisionappears to have troubled them when it left a remainder, for only Indra and Vis.n.uare said to have succeeded in dividing a thousand cows into three. According totheS ́atapathabra ̄hman.a(3.3.1.13, 4.5.8.1), they correctly obtained 333 for thequotient with the remainder 1. This story is believed to be implicitly alluded toalready in R.gveda 6.69.8.By the time of, at latest, the Yajurvedasam.hita ̄, the Indians had extended theirlist of the names of powers of ten up to 1012. In Va ̄jasaneyisam.hita ̄17.2, they areused for counting the numbers of bricks. In Taittirı ̄yasam.hita ̄7.2.11–20, theyconstitute part of the sacrificial formulas (mantras) to be uttered on the occasionof an annahomaor “food-oblation rite,” which is performed at a certain stage intheas ́vamedha or “horse-sacrifice rite.” In the annahoma, a priest makes a seriesof oblations of ghee, honey, rice, barleycorns, etc. to the fire (agni) calleda ̄havanı ̄yathrough the night until sunrise, while uttering mantras in which a unitformula, “the dative case of a numeral +sva ̄ha ̄(hail to),” is repeated.The first mantrareads: “Hail to one, hail to two, hail to three,..., hail to nine-teen, hail to twenty, hail to twenty-nine, hail to thirty-nine,..., hail to ninety-nine, hail to one hundred, hail to two hundred, hail to all (sarva).” The numbersthat actually occur in this mantra are:1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 29,39, 49, 59, 69, 79, 89, 99, 100, 200;but this seems to be an abbreviation of a series of natural numbers from 1 to200 or more. According to the traditional interpretation, “one” representsPraja ̄pati (“lord of creatures” or creator), the rest being all things in the worldwhich have evolved from him. The mantras that follow consist of arithmeticalprogressions such as odd numbers, even numbers, multiples of 4, etc., some ofwhich are accompanied by an additional number either at the end or at thebeginning. Then comes the last mantra, which contains the decimal names froms ́ata(102) to para ̄rdha (1012): “Hail to s ́ata, hail to sahasra, hail to ayuta,..., hailtopara ̄rdha, hail to the dawn (us.as), hail to the twilight (vyus.t.i), hail to the onewhich is going to rise (udes.yat), hail to the one which is rising (udyat), hail to theone which has just risen (udita), hail to the heaven (svarga), hail to the world(loka), hail to all.” The four phrases beginning with “hail to the dawn” are utteredimmediately before the sunrise, and the four beginning with “hail to the onewhich has just risen” immediately after that. Some regard the last seven terms, us.astoloka, as the names of 1013to 1019, but there is no support for thisconjecture.indian mathematics361"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"It has been conjectured that zero is indicated by the word ks.udra(lit. petty, tri-fling) in the Atharvaveda (19.22.6=19.23.21), and a negative number by anr.ca(lit. without a hymn) (ibid.19.23.22). But this conjecture still awaits a proof.It is probable that the Pythagorean Theorem (the sum of the areas of thesquares on the two sides of a right-angled triangle is equal to that on itshypotenuse), which was explicitly stated and utilized by the authors of theS ́ulbasu ̄tras, had already been known at latest in the times of the Bra ̄hman.as.TheS ́atapathabra ̄hman.a(10.2.3.18) speaks of successive increases of theareas of the fire altars (agni): the basic fire altar, called the “seven-fold agni,” hasthe area of seven and one half square purus.as(onepurus.aor “man” is the heightof the sacrificer with his hands stretched upwards), and it is increased, in sub-sequent rites performed by the same sacrificer, by one square purus.aeach timeup to the “one hundread and one-fold agni.” The augmentation of area was mademost probably by means of the Pythagorean Theorem.The inverse case of the Pythagorean Theorem (if the sum of the areas of thesquares on two sides of a triangle is equal to that on the remaining side, thenthe first two sides contain a right angle) is also possibly referred to in theS ́atapathabra ̄hman.a.TheVa ̄jasaneyisam.hita ̄(30.20) and the Taittirı ̄yabra ̄hman.a(3.4.15) includethe word gan.aka(“a calculator”) in their lists of people to be sacrificed on theoccasion of the purus.a-medha(“human-sacrifice rite”). The gan.akain the formerlist, who is sacrificed for the divinity of a sea animal, is usually taken to be anastrologer, but this interpretation seems not to be decisive at all since anastrologer called naks.atradars ́a (“a star-gazer”), who is sacrificed for the divinityof wisdom, is listed prior to it in the same list (30.10). The gan.akain the latterlist, who is sacrificed together with a vı ̄n.a ̄player for the divinity of songs, is pre-sumably related with music.I.2 S ́ulbasu ̄trasS ́ulbasu ̄tras, which constitute part of, or appendices to, the S ́rautasu ̄tras, are basi-cally practical manuals meant for the preparation of the sites of s ́rauta rituals,the main topic being the construction of fire altars with burned bricks. A sac-rificer (yajama ̄na) had to strictly follow the regulations affecting the sizes andshapes of the sites and altars, because otherwise he was supposed to lose themerit to be attained through the specific ritual he was performing. Hence followsthe connection between rituals and geometry. But it would be wrong to supposeonly practical geometry like the measurement of land in the S ́ulbasu ̄tras. Thegeometry conceived by the s ́u1ba mathematicians already has theoreticalaspects as will be seen below.The two oldest S ́ulbasu ̄tras, those of A ̄pastamba and Baudha ̄yana, can be eachdivided into two parts. The first part treats geometry in general terms. The topicsdealt with in this geometry are certainly related to the construction of ritualsites, but it contains few words which indicate rituals. The second part treats the362takao hayashi"},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"construction of ritual sites including various altars. It is mostly devoted to thedescription of various fire-altars (agni) to be employed in the agni-cayana (“fire-altar-construction rite”). For the construction of a standard agni, the followingrequirements had to be satisfied: (1) an agni consists of five layers of 200 brickseach with the total height equal to the knee-height of the sacrificer; (2) the odd-numbered and the even-numbered layers each have one and the same arrange-ment of bricks, and no brick should coincide with the one above or below it; and(3) an agni should occupy an area of seven and one half square purus.as.Thearea of an agni was increased by one square purus.aeach time the same rite wasrepeated by the same sacrificer.The topics dealt with in the geometric portion of the S ́ulbasu ̄tras of A ̄pastamba(abbr. A) and Baudha ̄yana (B) are as follows.Linear measures (B 1.3–21; A provides them in later chapters at need).Construction of geometric figures (A 1.2–3, 1.7–2.3; B 1.22–44, 46–7).Relationships between the diagonal and the side of a rectangle (oblong andsquare).Pythagorean Theorem (A 1.4–5, B 1.45, 48–9).Computation of the diagonal of a square (A 1.6, B 1.61–2).Sum and difference of two squares (A 2.4–6, B 1.50–1).Equi-area transformation of geometric figures (A 2.7, 3.1–3, cf. 12.5, 12.9,15.9; B 1.52–60).Relationship between the area and the side of a square (A 3.4–10).The tools used for drawing figures in the S ́ulbasu ̄tras are a rope called rajju ors ́ulba and pegs or posts called s ́an.ku. A bamboo rod is sometimes used instead ofa rope. By means of these tools, one can draw a straight line, cut out a linesegment having any desired length, and draw a circle or an arc with any desiredradius.No specific rules are given for the drawing of a line, a circle, and an arc; thesecan be easily obtained by a rope and pegs. The main problem for the s ́ulbageometers, who were required to construct geometric figures like a square, a rec-tangle, and a trapezium, was how to draw a line orthogonal to, or parallel to, agiven line.The most important mathematical motif of the S ́ulbasu ̄tras is the area. Thecore of the S ́ulba mathematics is concerned with the religious requirement thatone should construct altars in varoius shapes with a given area, a requirementwhich seems to have originated from agriculture where a harvest greatlydepends on the area of the land (bhu ̄orbhu ̄mi).TheS ́ulbasu ̄tras contain the earliest extant verbal expression of thePythagorean Theorem in the world, although it had already been known to the Old Babylonians. It is stated in exactly the same words by A ̄pastamba (1.4),Baudha ̄yana (1.48) and Ka ̄tya ̄yana (2.7): “The diagonal rope (aks.n.aya ̄-rajju)of an oblong produces both which the flank (pa ̄rs ́vama ̄nı ̄) and the horizontalindian mathematics363"},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"(tiryan.ma ̄nı ̄)·ropesÒproduce separately.” What “the ropes produce” are notexplicitly mentioned, but are no doubt the square areas constructed on them.Highlights of the s ́ulba mathematics are transformations of geometric figureswith their areas kept unchanged. This theme was originally related with thepractical requirement of drawing altars in various shapes with a given area, butthe S ́ulba makers seem to have taken a step forward and tried to treat the themewith a theoretical perspective in mind.Baudha ̄yana deals with seven transformations. Five out of them are con-cerned with transformations from a square to a circle, a rectangle, an isoscelestrapezium, an isosceles triangle, and a rhombus, while the other two are thosefrom a rectangle and a circle to a square. All these, except the last one, can beput into the following scheme for constructing various figures.a rectangle Æa square Æa circle, etc.This scheme consists of three steps. Given an area A:1Construct a rectangle having the area A.2Transform it into a square having the area A.3Transform it into the desired figure (a circle, etc.) having the area A.For example, in order to draw a circle with the area A, one first constructs arectangle with the two sides aandA/afor any rational number a, and then trans-forms the rectangle into a square and the square obtained into a circle. In fact,for the s ́ulba mathematicians, this was the most natural way of constructing acircle with a given area, since they did not know the formula, A=pr2, from whichwe would compute rto draw a circle with the radius r.An apparent gap between s ́ulba mathematics and later Indian mathematicsused to puzzle scholars, and this made some suppose Western influence upon thelatter. But now we know some links between the two.The word, karan.ı ̄, used in later mathematics to denote a square number andthe square root of a number, originated from its use in the S ́ulbasu ̄tras.In order to draw a line measured by , Brahmagupta constructs an isosce-les triangle, whose base and two sides are measured respectively by (n/m-m)and by (n/m+m)/2, where mis any optional number. Its perpendicular is theline to be obtained (Bra ̄hmasphut.asiddha ̄nta18.37). This is a generalization ofKa ̄tya ̄yana’s rule (6.7), where m=1.The square nature or an indeterminate equation of the second degree of thetype, Px2+t=y2, which was to be investigated in detail by Brahmagupta andothers, presumably has its origin in the s ́ulba mathematicians’ investigation ofthe diagonal of a square or .Two root-approximation formulas used in Jaina works and in the Bakhsha ̄lı ̄Manuscript, seem to have been obtained by algebraically (or numerically) inter-pretingS ́ulbasu ̄trasgeometric rules for the rectangle-squaring transformation.2n364takao hayashi"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"A ̄ryabhat.a I’s terminology for series, citi, etc., too, is probably related to theS ́ulbasu ̄tras, whose main theme was the piling (citi) of bricks for Vedic altars.II Gan.ita (Mathematics)II.1 Up to the 5th century – prologueIt is but natural that one who calculates most in a society is called a calculator.Before the introduction and spread of horoscopic astrology and mathematicalastronomy to the Indian subcontinent, the occupation that, in Indian society,required calculations most seems to have been that of the accountant, since hewas called either gan.akaorsam.khya ̄yaka, both meaning “a calculator.” In theMaha ̄bha ̄rata (2.5.62) the sage Na ̄rada recommends to the king Yudhis.t.hira thathe make his calculator (gan.aka) and scribe (lekhaka) report to him the revenueand expenditure every morning. Kaut.ilya’s Arthas ́a ̄stra (1.19.9), too, refers tothe same daily task of a king. The salary of a king’s calculator and scribe is 500pan.aseach, while the highest salary, 48,000 pan.as, is paid to a minister, a prince,etc., and the lowest, 60 pan.as, to a servant who takes care of animals (ibid.5.3.3–17). The superintendents of governmental departments are said to beassisted by five persons, namely, calculators (sam.khya ̄yakas), scribes (lekhakas),inspectors of coins (ru ̄pa-dars ́akas), receivers of balances (nı ̄vı ̄-gra ̄hakas), andsupervisors (uttara ̄dhyaks.as) (ibid. 2.9.28). According to a later law book, theBr.haspatismr.ti(1.1.81–90), a court consists of ten elements including a gan.aka,who calculates money and assets, and a lekhaka, who writes sentences.The 107th story, Gan.akamoggalla ̄nasutta, of the Majjhimanika ̄yanarrates a dis-course of the Buddha with a bra ̄hman.agan.akanamed Moggalla ̄na, from whichwe know: (1) that a gan.akalived on calculation (gan.ana ̄), (2) that a gan.akatooklive-in pupils (anteva ̄sins) and taught them calculation (san.kha ̄na), and (3) that agan.akafirst taught his pupils to count from one to one hundred. The gan.ana ̄andthesan.kha ̄nain this story seem to mean respectively calculation (or mathemat-ics) in general and a relatively elementary skill of computation beginning withthe counting of numbers.According to the Arthas ́a ̄stra (1.2–5), a prince learns lipi(writing) andsam.khya ̄naafter his hairdressing rite, and then, after his initiation rite, learns thefour disciplines (vidya ̄s), namely, philosophy, the Vedas with related fields, pra-ctical knowledge like agriculture and commerce, and politics. This sam.khya ̄naisperhaps as elementary as the san.kha ̄naof Moggalla ̄na, although a calculator ingeneral is called not a gan.akabut a sam.khya ̄yakain the Arthas ́a ̄stra.In the Maha ̄bha ̄rata (3.70), the king R.tuparn.a is proud of his ability insam.khya ̄nain addition to that in dice, when he correctly estimates, without count-ing, the number of nuts, 2095, on two branches of a Vibhı ̄taka tree (Terminaliabellerica).Thissam.khya ̄na, therefore, contains a sort of statistical estimate of thequantities of nuts, crops, etc. The san.kha ̄naof the Jaina canonical text, T.ha ̄n.am.gaindian mathematics365"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"(747), consists of ten topics, which presumably cover the entire mathematicsknown to the Indians of those days. They are: basic computation (parikamma),procedure or applied mathematics (vavaha ̄ra), rope (rajju), quantity (ra ̄si), reduc-tion of fractions (kala ̄savanna), “as many as” (ja ̄vam.ta ̄vati), square (vagga), cube(ghana), square of square (vaggavagga), and choice (vikappa, combinatorics). TheJainas played an important role in the making of Indian mathematics.It was, however, neither gan.ana ̄norsam.khya ̄nabutgan.itathat was used lateras the most general term for mathematical science. A ̄ryabhat.a I, in the first verseof his A ̄ryabhat.ı ̄ya(ad499 or a little later), enumerates the three subjects to bedealt with in its subsequent chapters, namely, gan.ita,ka ̄la-kriya ̄(time-reckoning),andgola(spherics).The Vedic numerals continued to be used in later Hindu society as well, whilethe Buddhists and the Jainas each developed their own systems of numerals fornumbers greater than a thousand.Apart from the Indus script, the earliest extant script in India is the one calledKaros.t.hı ̄ of, probably, Aramaic origin. Its use was restricted to north-westernIndia and central Asia from the fourth century bcto the fourth century ad. Atnearly the same time, in the As ́okan edicts, appeared another script calledBra ̄hmı ̄ which was to become the origin of many varieties of south and south-east Asian scripts. Its relationship to the former is not certain. These scripts hadtheir own numerical symbols, but in both systems particular symbols were usednot only for units but also for tens, hundreds, thousands, etc., and some of themwere made by the principle of addition, and others by the principle of multipli-cation. The numeral systems in both scripts were therefore not based on a place-value system, and the Bra ̄hmı ̄, non-place-value, numerals continued to be usedin epigraphy even after the place-value system was introduced in daily calcula-tions and in mathematical literature in the early centuries of the Christian era.The oldest datable evidence of the decimal place-value system in India isfound in the Yavanaja ̄taka(ad269/270) of Sphujidhvaja, a book on astrology. Itis not certain if the decimal place-value notation in India had a symbol for zerofrom the beginning. We have to keep it in mind that, historically, not all place-value notations were accompanied by a zero symbol as the sexagesimal notationof the Old Babylonians proves. There is no reference to zero in the Yavanaja ̄taka.In Pin.gala’s Chandah.su ̄tra (8.28–31), a work on Sanskrit prosody, zero (s ́u ̄nya)and two (dvi) are used as signs for the multiplication by two and for the squar-ing, respectively, in the computation of powers of two, which occurs in the right-hand side of the equation, 2 +22+23+...+2n=2¥2n-2. The date of thework is controversial: some ascribe it to ca. 200 bcbut others to the third centuryador later. The oldest datable evidence of zero as a symbol as well as of that asa number are found in Vara ̄hamihira’s Pañcasiddha ̄ntika ̄(ca.ad550).II.2 The fifth to sixth centuries – beginningA ̄ryabhat.a I is so called to distinguish him from another astronomer of the samename, the author of the Maha ̄siddha ̄nta, who is called A ̄ryabhat.a II.366takao hayashi"},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"A ̄ryabhat.a I was one of the most influential mathematicians and astronomersin India through his two works, A ̄ryabhat.ı ̄yaandA ̄ryabhat.asiddha ̄nta.The latterwork is not extant but has been referred to by many later scholars. The workmainly influenced northwestern India. It is also known to have had some influ-ence upon the Sasanian and Islamic astronomy. The A ̄ryabhat.ı ̄ya, on the otherhand, mainly influenced south India.A ̄ryabhat.a I was born in ad476. This is known from his own statement intheA ̄ryabhat.ı ̄ya(3.10): “When sixty of sixty years and three quarters of theYuga had passed, then twenty-three years had passed here from my birth.” Thatis, he was 23 years old in ad499 (=3600-3101, since the last quarter, calledKaliyuga, of the current Yuga began in 3102 bc). The year mentioned here, ad499, is usually taken to refer to the date of the composition of the A ̄ryabhat.ı ̄ya.TheA ̄ryabhat.ı ̄yais divided into four “quarters” (pa ̄das), that is,1Quarter in Ten Gı ̄ti verses,2Quarter for Mathematics (gan.ita, in 33 A ̄rya ̄ verses),3Quarter for Time-Reckoning (ka ̄lakriya ̄, in 25 A ̄rya ̄ verses), and4Quarter for Spherics (gola, in 50 A ̄rya ̄ verses).Chapter 1 consists of 13 verses. The first verse contains the author’s salute toGod Brahma ̄ and refers to the three fields to be treated in the next three chap-ters. The second verse defines an alphabetical notation of numbers. The next tenverses (the words, “ten Gı ̄ti verses,” in the title of this chapter refer to this part)contain tables of astronomical parameters and of sine-differences expressed inthat notation. For example, the number of the sun’s revolutions in a yuga,4320000, is expressed as khyughr.=(2+30)¥104+4¥106.Chapter 2 of the A ̄ryabhat.ı ̄yais the oldest extant mathematical text in San-skrit after the S ́ulbasu ̄tras. Although the chapter does not have a clear divisioninto sections, it may be divided into four parts:i.Rules for basic computations (vv. 2–5),ii.Rules for geometric figures (vv. 6–18),iii.Rules for both figures and quantities (vv. 19–24), andiv.Rules for numerical quantities (vv. 25–33).A ̄ryabhat.a gives the names of the first 10 decimal places, and says: “·EachÒplace shall be ten times greater than ·the previousÒplace.”Problems of proportion were solved by means of the traira ̄s ́ika or “the ·com-putationÒrelated to three quantities.” The traira ̄s ́ika was not only indispensablefor astronomy but also essential for monetary economy. The first of the sevenexamples for the traira ̄s ́ika supplied by the commentator, Bha ̄skara I, is this: “Fivepalasof sandal-wood were bought by me for nine ru ̄pakas.Then, how much ofsandal-wood can be obtained for only one ru ̄paka?” The palaand the ru ̄pakaareunits of weight and money, respectively.The last rule provides a general solution called kut.t.akaor “pulverizer” to anindeterminate system of linear equations of the following type: “When a certainindian mathematics367"},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"unknown integer, N, is divided by a set of integers, {a1,a2,..., an}, one by one,the remainders are {r1,r2,..., rr}. What is that number, N?”Va r a ̄hamihira is one of the most famous authorities on astrology in India. Heflourished in Avantı ̄ (modern Ujjain) in the sixth century ad.He divided the “astral science” (jyotih.s ́a ̄stra) into three major “branches”(skandhas), namely, (1) mathematics including mathematical astronomy (gan.itaortantra), (2) horoscopic astrology (hora ̄), and (3) natural astrology or divina-tion in general (sam.hita ̄)(Br.hatsam.hita ̄1.8–9, 2.2, 2.19), and wrote severalbooks each in the second and third branches. His only work in the first branch,Pañcasiddha ̄ntika ̄, is a compendium of the texts of five earlier astronomicalschools, and no work on mathematics proper is known to have been written byhim, but his works are important from the view point of the history of mathe-matics as well.In the Pañcasiddha ̄ntika ̄, zero occurs as a number, that is, the object of mathe-matical operations like addition, subtraction, etc. For example, he states themean daily velocity of the sun in each of the 12 zodiacal signs beginning withAries as follows: “The daily velocity of the sun is in order 60 ·minutesÒminus 3,3, 3, 3, 2, 1; plus 1, 1, 1, 1; and minus 0, 1” (Pañcasiddha ̄ntika ̄3.17).Presumably, the existence of both the zero symbol for vacant places in theplace-value notation and calculations by this notation brought about theconcept of zero as a number, because we cannot calculate, for instance, 15 +20=35 without the rule, 5 +0=5. This is not the case with an abacus where nosymbol exists for vacant places.He expressly stated the “graphic procedure” for constructing a sine table, amethod which had been only alluded to by A ̄ryabhat.a I, and gave a sine table forthe radius, R=120 (ibid. 4.1–15).In a chapter on the combination of perfume of his work on divination,Br.hatsam.hita ̄(76.22), he provided a rule for calculating the number of combi-nations, nCr, when rthings are taken at a time from nthings, and a method called“spread by token” (los.t.aka-prasta ̄ra) for enumerating all the possible combina-tions correctly. In the same chapter he gave the correct numbers, 84 and 1820,of9C3and16C4respectively, but he mistakenly regarded 4! ¥4¥16C4=174720as the number of possible combinations when 4 are taken at a time out of 16ingredients for perfumes, in the ratio, 1:2:3:4 (ibid. 76.13–21); the correctnumber should be 16P4=16¥15¥14¥13=43680.In the same chapter he utilized a magic square of order four in order to pre-scribe the perfumes called “good for all purposes.” It consists of the four rows:2, 3, 5, 8; 5, 8, 2, 3; 4, 1, 7, 6; and 7, 6, 4, 1 (ibid. 76.23–6). This is the oldestmagic square in India. It is irregular because it is made not of the numbers 1 to16 but of two sets of the numbers 1 to 8, but it is “pan-diagonal” in the sensethat not only the two main diagonals but also all the “broken” diagonals eachamounts to the magic constant, 18 in this case. Presumably, Vara ̄hamihira firstconstructed a regular magic square with the numbers 1 to 16, and then modi-fied it by subtracting 8 each from the numbers greater than 8 to arrive at hisirregular square.368takao hayashi"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"II.3 The seventh to eighth centuries – restructuringThe seventh century saw a restructuring of Indian mathematics. It was dividedinto two major fields, that is, arithmetic with mensuration and algebra, whichwere later called pa ̄t.ı ̄-gan.ita(“mathematics of algorithms”) and bı ̄ja-gan.ita(“mathematics of seeds”), respectively. The “seeds” here means algebraic equa-tions (samı ̄karan.a, lit. “to make ·both sidesÒequal”), which, just like seeds ofplants, have “the potentiality to generate” the solutions of mathematical prob-lems. A work for pa ̄t.ı ̄-gan.itausually consists of two categories of rules oftenaccompanied by examples, that is, parikarman (basic operations) and vyavaha ̄ra(practical or applied mathematics).Brahmagupta included two chapters corresponding to these two fields in hisastronomical work, Bra ̄hmasphut.asiddha ̄nta(ad628), and began to use the wordgan.aka(“calculator”) in the sense of one who knows mathematical astronomy.According to his own words, Brahmagupta, son of Jis.n.u, wrote the Bra ̄hmas-phut.asiddha ̄ntain 25 chapters at the age of 30 in S ́aka 550 =ad628. This meansthat he was born in ad598. He was still active at the age of 67 (ad665), whenhe composed another work on astronomy, the Khan.d.akha ̄dyaka.In the Bra ̄hmasphut.asiddha ̄nta, five chapters are particularly concerned withmathematics. They are: chap. 12, “Mathematics,” on arithmetic and mensura-tion, chap. 18, “pulverizer,” on algebra (the title has simply been taken from thename of the first topic in the chapter), chap. 19, “Knowledge about Gnomon andShadow,” on measurements of shadows and lights, chap. 20, Answer to <theProblems of> Piling of Meters” (chandas ́cityuttara, on combinatorics concerningprosody, and a small section called “sine-production” (jya ̄-utpatti) in chap. 21(“Spherics”) on trigonometry.It is in chap. 12 that he gives his famous theorem on the diagonals of a cyclicquadrilateral. In chap. 18, he prescribes rules for surds, negative quantities, zero, and unknown quantities, and provides rules called varga-prakr.ti(“squarenature”) for quadratic indeterminate equations of the type, Px2+t=y2.Bha ̄skara I flourished in the first half of the seventh century in Saura ̄s.t.ra,perhaps in Valabhı ̄ near modern Bha ̄vnagar, and composed three works as theexpositions of the teachings of A ̄ryabhat.a I, “based on the continuity of tradi-tion” (samprada ̄ya-aviccheda ̄t).They are, in chronological order, Karmanibandha(“Treatise on ·AstronomicalÒComputation”) alias Maha ̄bha ̄skarı ̄ya(“Large·BookÒof Bha ̄skara”), a prose commentary on the A ̄ryabhat.ı ̄ya(written in S ́aka551=ad629), and an abridged version of the first work also called Karmani-bandhaaliasLaghubha ̄skarı ̄ya(“Small·BookÒof Bha ̄skara”).Particularly important for the history of Indian mathematics is the secondwork, that is, the commentary on the A ̄ryabhat.ı ̄ya, which provides valuableinformation on, among other things, mathematical procedures and expressionsof his time.A vacant place (kha) in the decimal place-value notation was indicated by asmall circle (bindu, lit. “a dot”), which was also put on the right shoulder of aindian mathematics369"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"negative number.

It was unearthed in a deterioratedcondition at Bakhsha ̄lı ̄ near Peshawar (now in Pakistan) in 1881 and is nowpreserved in the Bodleian Library at Oxford University. The extant portion of themanuscript consists of 70 fragmentary leaves. It is written on birchbark withthe earlier type of the S ́a ̄rada ̄ script, which was used in the northwestern part ofIndia from the eighth to the twelfth centuries ad. The language is Sanskrit butit has largely been influenced by the vernacular(s) of those regions.The work is a loose compilation of mathematical rules and examples collectedfrom different works. They are written in verse, and the examples are solved inprose commentaries on them and are often given verifications of the answers.The dates so far proposed for the Bakhsha ̄lı ̄ work vary from the third to thetwelfth centuries ad, but a recently made comparative study has shown manysimilarities, particularly in the style of exposition and terminology, between theBakhsha ̄lı ̄ work and Bha ̄skara I’s commentary on the A ̄ryabhat.ı ̄ya.This seemsto indicate that both works belong to the nearly same period, although this doesnot deny the possibility that some of the rules and examples in the Bakhsha ̄lı ̄work date from anterior periods.The rules that occur in the extant portion of the Bakhsha ̄lı ̄ work are: (1) arith-metical operations such as addition, etc.; (2) general rules applicable to differentkinds of problems such as the rule of three, regula falsi, etc.; (3) rules for purelynumerical problems such as algebraic equations and arithmetical progressions;(4) rules for problems of money such as buying and selling, etc.; (5) rules forproblems of travelers such as equations of journeys, etc.; and (6) rules for geo-metric problems such as the volume of an irregular solid. The Bakhsha ̄lı ̄ workemploys a decimal place value notation with a dot for zero.S ́rı ̄dhara, who flourished between Brahmagupta and Govindasva ̄min, is oneof the earliest mathematicians who wrote separate treatises for the two majorfields,pa ̄t.ı ̄-gan.itaandbı ̄ja-gan.tia, although his work on the latter is known onlyfrom a quotation. He included many new topics such as combinations of the sixtastes, the hundred fowls problem, the cistern problem, etc., in his Pa ̄t.ı ̄gan.ita.II.4 The ninth to fourteenth centuries – later developmentsA follower of the A ̄ryabhat.a school of mathematics and astronomy, Govin-dasva ̄min flourished in the first half of the ninth century in Kerala.

That which has smoke has fire,like a kitchen.” According to Govinda, the four terms of the rule of three corre-spond in order to the smoke and fire in the kitchen and the same two in themountain, and thus the rule of three can be regarded as an inference.A Jaina mathematician, Maha ̄vı ̄ra wrote a book for pa ̄t.ı ̄-gan.itaentitledGan.itasa ̄rasam.graha during the reign of King Amoghavars.a (ca. 814/815–80).The work is quite voluminous and comprises more than 1130 verses for rulesand examples. He seems to be the first in India who admitted two solutions of aquadratic equation.Bha ̄skara II was born in ad1114 to a family which produced a number ofscholars and literary men before and after him. He lived in Vijjad.avid.a at the foot of the Sahya mountain situated at the northern end of the WesternGhats, and completed his main work, Siddha ̄ntas ́iroman.i, when he was 36 years old (ad1150). He also wrote an astronomical manual, Karan.akutu ̄hara,inad1183, and a commentary (date unknown) on Lalla’sS ́is.yadhı ̄vr.ddhidatantra.TheSiddha ̄ntas ́iroman.iconsists of four parts. Two of them, Lı ̄la ̄vatı ̄andBı ̄jagan.ita, are on mathematics, and the other two, Grahagan.ita ̄dhya ̄yaandGola ̄dhya ̄ya, on astronomy. These four parts were often regarded as independentworks.The most popular among them was the Lı ̄la ̄vatı ̄, which is a well organized text-book ofpa ̄t.ı ̄-gan.itawritten in a plain and elegant Sanskrit. It circulated all overIndia and was commented upon in Sanskrit and in north Indian languages (suchas Mara ̄t.hı ̄ and Gujara ̄tı ̄) by a number of persons and translated not only intoIndian languages of the north and of the south (such as Kan.n.ad.a and Telugu)but also several times into Persian.Bha ̄skara II included a whole theory of the pulverizer in the Lı ̄la ̄vatı ̄, a bookofpa ̄t.ı ̄. This was possible because it required neither algebraic symbolism nor“intelligence” (mati) which were essential for bı ̄ja-gan.itaor algebra according toBha ̄skara II.The last chapter, “the nets of digits,” deals with permutations of numericalfigures. The last problem, for example, reads as follows: “How many varieties ofnumbers are there with digits placed in five places when their sum is thirteen?It should be told, if you know.”TheBı ̄jagan.itais the culmination of Indian algebra. Bha ̄skara II’s main con-tribution to algebra is his treatment of various types of equations of order twoor more (up to six) with more than one unknown. The equations of higherorders are solved by reducing them to quadratic equations. In his solutions, thesquare nature and pulverizer, as well as the “elimination of the middle term”(which is the name given to the solution procedure of quadratic equations), playimportant roles.372takao hayashi"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"Na ̄ra ̄yan.a Pan.d.ita wrote, in ad1356, a book for pa ̄t.ı ̄-gan.ita,Gan.itakaumudı ̄,in which he developed, among other things, theories of factorization, of parti-tioning, of combinatorics, and of magic squares.

Particularly important is the academic lineage headed by Ma ̄dhavaof San.gamagra ̄ma (fl. 1380/1420), which is often called the Ma ̄dhava school.Ma ̄dhava, a resident of San.gamagra ̄ma near Cochin in Kerala, was one of themost brilliant mathematicians in the world. His name is, and will be, remem-bered for his discovery of a power series expansion ofpat least and perhaps also of those of trigonometric functions such as sine, cosine, versed sine, andarctangent. The verses that state these series are found not in his extant astro-nomical works but in the works of his successors.In his commentary on the Lı ̄la ̄vatı ̄,S ́an.kara explicitly ascribes two methods forcalculating the circumference of a circle to Ma ̄dhava. S ́an.kara also citesMa ̄dhava’s verse which expresses, in the word-numeral notation (Bhu ̄tasam.khya ̄),an approximation to pcorrect to 11 decimal places, 2827433388233/(9 · 1011).Nı ̄lakan.t.ha Somaya ̄ji, son of Ja ̄tavedas, was born ca. 14 June 1444 inKun.d.apura near Tirur, Kerala, and studied under Da ̄modara, son ofParames ́vara, at A ̄lattu ̄ r, Kerala.He wrote an elaborate commentary on the A ̄ryabhat.ı ̄yain about 1510. Itshows his great talent in mathematics as well as in astronomy. To cite a fewexamples, he rediscovered the correct meaning of A ̄ryabhat.a’s rule for sine-differences. He expressly states the incommensurability of the diameter and thecircumference of a circle, although whether he has proved it or not is not known. He cites and proves Ma ̄dhava’s formulas for interpolation in the sinetable, and for the sum and difference of sines. He died after 1542.Indian mathematics thus made unique, remarkable progress up to the sixteenthcentury. It was only in the 1720’s that Jaganna ̄tha (1652–1744), at the requestof his patron, Jai Singh Sawai (1688–1744), produced the first Sanskrit versionof Euclid’sElementsunder the title Rekha ̄-gan.ita(Mathematics of Lines) from theArabic version of Nas.ı ̄r al-Dı ̄n al-T.u ̄sı ̄.BibliographyFor more bibliographical information, see Pingree 1970–94 and 1981 and Hayashi 2000.Amulya Kumar Bag, 1979, Mathematics in Ancient and Medieval India, Varanasi:Chaukhambha Orientalia, 1979.indian mathematics373"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"Henry Thomas Colebrooke, 1817, Algebra with Arithmetic and Mesuration from the Sanscrit of Brahmegupta and Bháscara, London: John Murray, 1817.

(A ̄rca-jyautisam 33, in Dvivedin 1907)This verse gave a strong motivation to those who devoted themselves in the studyof astronomy. Thus, for instance, Bha ̄skara II, the author of the Lı ̄la ̄vatı ̄andone of the most popular astronomer-mathematicians in India, wrote in themiddle of the twelfth century:First of all the Vedas advanced through the activities of sacrificial rituals, whilesacrificial rituals are said to be dependent on time. Since knowledge of time is fromthis science, therefore astronomy is said to be a branch of Vedic studies.(Siddha ̄ ntas ́iroman.i; Grahagan.ita ̄dha ̄ ya 1.1.9)The main purpose of the jyotis.aveda ̄n.gawas the preparation of a calendar inorder to fix the date of sacrificial rituals. Nothing is written on planets. The cal-endar described here represents the earliest stage of Indian calendrical tradition.Almost all the important elements which characterize the Indian calendar arealready found in this literature. The main feature of this calendar is the five-yearcycle which is clearly stated as:A year is 366 days, 6 seasons, 2 ayanas, and 12 solar months. This, multiplied byfive, is a yuga. (Ya ̄jus.ajyautis.am 28cd, in Dvivedin 1907)(The number of) sa ̄vanamonths, lunar months, sidereal months (in a yuga) are 61,62, and 67 (respectively). A sa ̄vana [month] has 30 days. A solar year is a turn ofthe stars. (Ya ̄jus.ajyautis.am 31)This statement can be tabulated as follows. Items in [ ] are not explicitly stated.1 year=366 days=6 seasons=2ayanas=12 solar months1sa ̄vana month=30 days5 years=60 solar months[=1,800 solar days]=61sa ̄vanamonths[=1,830sa ̄vana days]=62 synodic months[=1,860tithis]=67 sidereal monthsThis system requires two intercalary months (adhima ̄sas) in every five years, inother words, one intercalation in every two and a half years. This is clearly men-tioned in Kaut.ilya’s Arthas ́a ̄stra(2.20.66). We can interpret the word sa ̄vanahereas equivalent to the modern adjective “civil”, although there were different mean-ings of this word and this verse has been subject to different interpretations.1calendar, astrology, and astronomy377"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"With our interpretation it follows that62 synodic months =1,830 days, i.e., 1 synodic month ª29.515 days.Since this value is not very accurate (the modern value is 29.530589 days), theancient Indian ritualists should have put an adjustment rather frequently –addition of one day is necessary about every 64 months – in order to keep therelation of the date of rituals and the lunar phases. But there are many textualevidences which show the use of this five-year yuga, for instance, the Arthas ́a ̄straas mentioned above, the medical text Sus ́rutasam.hita ̄, the Buddhist textS ́a ̄rdu ̄lakarn.a ̄vada ̄na, and the Jain text Su ̄ ryapannatti. It was only after the intro-duction of Hellenistic astronomy that the calendrical values were improved to auseful degree.2Naks.atraand Lunar Astrology2.1 Two systems ofnaks.atraSometime in the later Vedic period the meaning of the word naks.atrashifted fromits original sense of “star” in general to its narrower sense, namely, one of the28 or 27 groups of stars which were regarded as the lunar stations along theecliptic. The earliest list ofnaks.atrasin this sense is found in the Taittirı ̄yasam.hita ̄(Macdonell and Keith 1912: 409–31). The names of the naks.atrasshow somevariations and their grammatical forms do not always agree. In table 18.1 themost commonly used forms are given. When 28 naks.atrasare counted, Abhijitis put between Uttara ̄s.a ̄d.ha ̄ and S ́ravan.a. The most important difference betweenthe 28 naks.atra system and the 27 naks.atrasystem is that in the latter eachnaks.atraoccupies an equal space of 13°20¢while in the former the distance isirregular. When, therefore, we find a naks.atraname in Sanskrit texts, we shouldknow which of the two system is intended. Since similar systems of unevenlyspaced 28 lunar mansions are found in Chinese and Islamic astronomy, therehave been disputes concerning their origin. In my view, the Chinese and Indiansystems are independent while the Islamic mana ̄zil al-qamar(stations of themoon) should have been influenced by the Indian naks.atras.The identification of stars comprising each naks.atraposes even more difficultproblems, but some secure identification can be made: for example, Kr.ttika ̄is agroup of stars corresponding to Pleiades, and Citra ̄ is aVirginis (=Spica).In the earlier Sanskrit texts naks.atras are counted from Kr.ttika ̄, while in thelater period As ́vinı ̄ (bandgArietis) became the first mansion. The shift ofthe starting point of the naks.atrasystem can be ascribed to the precession ofthe equinoxes. The time when Pleiades was near the vernal equinox is about378michio yano"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"2300bc. This is one of the reasons that some people claim the high antiquityand originality of Indian astronomy. There is also an attempt at decipheringsome of the Indus scripts as the names ofnaks.atra. Such attempts are not utterlyimpossible, but we must remember the difference between the naks.atraas a well-defined coordinate system and the naks.atra as a star or a group of stars ingeneral.According to the jyotis.aveda ̄n.gathe sun’s northern course (uttara ̄yan.a) beginsat its entry into the first point of the naks.atraDhanis.t.ha ̄, which, therefore, wasregarded as the winter solstice. Since the jyotis.aveda ̄n.gaused the equally spaced27naks.atrasystem, it turns out that the vernal equinox was assumed to be atBharan.ı ̄ 10°, which is 23°20¢distant from the first point of As ́vinı ̄ which, in thelater period, was equated with the first point (mes.a ̄di, i.e. “the beginning ofAries”) of the ecliptic longitude. If this difference were accepted as the amountof the precession, and if we could admit that the accurate observation was madein the jyotis.aveda ̄n.gaperiod, the text might be dated about 1,600 years beforethe time when Indian naks.atra coordinate system was fixed. This would put the date of the jyotis.aveda ̄n.gain about 1300 bc. But here I should remind thereader of what I already said about Kr.ttika ̄. What we can say about the date isonly relative.Thenaks.atra system played a very important role in some aspects of Indianculture, i.e., calendar making, astrology and ritual.2.2Naks.atrain calendar and astrologyThe lunar month was named after the naks.atrawhere the full moon is located.Thus, for instance, Caitra is the month during which the full moon is stationedin Citra ̄. The relation of the naks.atrasand the month names is shown in table18.1. This naming system must have been one of the reasons that the sidereal(nirayan.a) position of the Sun and the Moon was more important than theirtropical (sa ̄yana) position. In this way the relation of month names to seasonscould not but be sacrificed by the effect of the precession of equinoxes.Thenaks.atrasplayed the central role in the earlier period of Indian astrology,namely, the period before the introduction of horoscopic astrology from the west.Predictions were made according to the naks.atraswhere the moon is located. Toeachnaks.atraa deity from the Indian pantheon was assigned, for example, Agnito Kr.ttika ̄ and Praja ̄pati to Rohin.ı ̄, etc. (see table 18.1). Thus naks.atraworshipbecame an important part of Indian rituals. Since little attention was paid to theposition of planets nor to the solar position, I would call this type of astrology“lunar astrology” in contrast to horoscopic astrology where the planetary posi-tion against the background of the zodiacal signs is more important. Among the texts preserving this old lunar astrology are the S ́a ̄rdu ̄ lakarn.a ̄vada ̄naandtheSu ̄ ryapannattiwhich we have mentioned above, and the Paris ́is.t.aof theAtharvaveda.calendar, astrology, and astronomy379"},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"3 Nine Grahas3.1Grahasin medical textsMost Hindu temples have a shrine which contains the images ofnavagraha, i.e.nine planetary gods.

Itshould be remembered that in this context the Sun and the Moon are separatelyenumerated and thus they are excluded from the group ofgrahas.In three passages of the Sus ́rutasam.hita ̄(1.6.19, 1.32.4, and 6.39.266cd–267ab) grahasas heavenly bodies are mentioned. Especially deserving attentionis the second passage, because here we find the word grahaalong with hora ̄inthe enumeration of bad omens (nimittas) leading to a patient’s death. The wordhora ̄is a phonetic transcription of the Greek word w\u0002rawhich denotes (1) aspatial unit of half a zodiacal sign or (2) a temporal unit of the 24th part of aday, or (3) the first astrological place (ascendant). In Sanskrit texts on astrologythis word became one of the basic technical terms.This brief summary ofgrahasin medical texts would suffice to reveal the com-plicated nature of Sanskrit texts. One and the same word was used in differentmeanings according to the context, and new ideas were sometimes incorporatedinto the older text. Even if we limit our topic to the grahasas heavenly bodies,they are subject to a variety of meanings, as will be shown below.3.2Grahasas planetsSemantic changeThe concept ofgraha (etymologically meaning “one whichseizes”) as a heavenly body experienced at least the following stages ofdevelopment.1A demon which eclipses the Sun and the Moon was called svarbha ̄nu and,probably, graha.2The demon got the name Ra ̄hu and, somewhat later, the tail of the truncatedRa ̄hu was called Ketu.3Five planets were regarded as grahas.4The Sun and the Moon joined the grahas, and a group of seven or nine grahaswas established, though without fixed order.5The week-day order of the seven grahasand the concept of the nine grahaswere established.This process shows an interesting semantic change where the Sun and theMoon, which were originally considered as “one which is seized” finally turnedto be “seizer” (graha). The chronological order of the stages 2 and 3 is difficultto decide.Eclipse demonSince a solar or lunar eclipse is one of the most conspicuousheavenly phenomena, it is difficult to imagine that it escaped attention of thecalendar, astrology, and astronomy381"},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"Vedic poets. In fact a demon called Svarbha ̄nu in the R.gveda5.40.5 seems to havebeen regarded as the cause of eclipses. This is the only occurrence ofsvarbha ̄nuin the R.gvedaand there is no evidence that this demon was identified as graha.In epics, however, svarbha ̄nuis explicitly called “graha” (Maha ̄bha ̄rata6.13.40abandRa ̄ma ̄yan.a3.22.11cd).Old references to planetsIn one passage of the Atharvavedaagrahaappears as aneclipse demon. The oldest text which mentions Ra ̄hu as an eclipse demon is theChandogya-Upanis.ad(8.13). The Maitra ̄yan.ı ̄-Upanis.ad(7.6) enumerates Ra ̄huand Ketu along with Saturn (s ́ani) as one of the semi-deities. But the date ofthese passages is problematical.It is only after the period of Greek settlement in Bactria (third century bc) thatexplicit references to planets are attested in Sanskrit texts.TheArthas ́a ̄strais one of the oldest texts which clearly mentions Jupiter andVenus by the name Br.haspati and S ́ukra, respectively:Its ascertainment (is made) from the position, motion and impregnation of Jupiter,from the rising, setting and movements of Venus and from the modification in the nature of the Sun. From the Sun (is known) the successful sprouting of seeds,from Jupiter the formation of stalks in the crops, from Venus rain. (Arthas ́a ̄stra2.24.7–8)The data of the text has not been well established. Probably its oldest part wascomposed about two hundred years before Christ. It is evident that this passageconcerns weather prognostics. Pingree (1981) regards such prognostics as ofBabylonian origin.Nine grahas without fixed orderTheGa ̄rgyajyotis.a(between bcandad)2arrangesthe nine grahasin a strange order: Moon, Ra ̄hu, Jupiter, Venus, Ketu, Saturn,Mars, Mercury, and Sun. Here Ketu (almost always in plural form) is not yet thetail of Ra ̄hu but comets. The great epic Maha ̄bha ̄rataabounds in the enumera-tion ofgrahas,3but the order of the enumeration is not fixed, nor is the week-day order attestable. Ketu is not always included in the group ofgrahas. Often itis called dhu ̄ maketu(“smoke-bannered”) and no reference to the single “Ketu”without similar modification is found in the Maha ̄bha ̄rata. This evidence showsthat there was a period in India when all the nine grahaswere known but theorder was not yet fixed.To this period belongs the S ́a ̄rdu ̄ lakarn.a ̄vada ̄na. The passage which concernsus runs as follows:Now, oh Pus.karasa ̄ rin, I will talk about grahas. Hear about them. They are Venus, Jupiter, Saturn Mercury, Mars, Sun, and the Lord of the stars (Moon).(Mukhopadhyaya 1954: 53)382michio yano"},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"TheModengqie Jing, one of the Chinese translations of the S ́a ̄rdu ̄ lakarn.a ̄vada ̄na,adds in this context Ra ̄hu and comets (or a comet) to the seven luminaries andregards “nine” grahasas making one group. What is more interesting is that theweek-day order of seven grahasis attested in a passage of this Chinese transla-tion (Taisho Daizôkyô, vol. 21: 410). It is quite puzzling to find the week-dayorder here, because the Chinese translation is said to have been made in the earlythird century ad. This was the time when the notion of the week-day was justintroduced into India. In order to settle this puzzle we must hypothesize either(1) that the Chinese translators got some new information directly from the westor (2) that this passage was inserted in a somewhat later period.Week-day order of grahasIt was only after the transmission of Hellenistic astrol-ogy that the order of planets in India was fixed in that of the seven-day week.This order is the outcome of the combination of the Greek cosmological idea ofconcentric spheres and the Egyptian belief of the planetary gods presiding overthe 24 hours (w\u0002ramentioned above). In order to get the present order of week-day, the concentric spheres must be arranged in the order of Saturn, Jupiter,Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury, and the Moon. This order was known sometimein the second century bc. But the evidence of the earliest use of the week-daybelongs to a considerably later period.The first evidence of the introduction of Greek astrology in India is theYavanaja ̄taka. The text was translated into Sanskrit prose in ad149/150 and itwas versified in ad269/270 by a Sphujidhvaja. Only the verse version is extant(Pingree 1978). Sphujidhvaja’s version enumerates seven planets on manyoccasions, but it is only towards the end of the work (chapter 77) that the week-day order is attestable. This order does not seem to have been widely spread inthat period in India. Neither Ra ̄hu nor Ketu appears in this text. About a quartercentury later, however, Mı ̄nara ̄ja in his Vr.ddhayavanaja ̄taka(about ad300–25)describes planets in the week-day order, together with Ra ̄hu, although he doesnot mention Ketu (Pingree 1976). Vara ̄hamihira (mid-sixth century) does notregard Ketu as the tail of Ra ̄hu but as comets.The oldest Indian inscription which gives a date with a week-day is that of Thursday, 21 July, ad484 (Fleet 1877: 80–4). The first astronomical textwhich defines the week-day is the A ̄ryabhat.ı ̄yaof A ̄ryabhat.a (born ad476). Hisdefinition is:These seven Lords ofhora ̄beginning with Saturn are (more and more) speedy inthis order (of concentric spheres). Every fourth by the order of swiftness is the Lordof the day (which begins) with the sunrise. (ABh. 3.16)What we can safely say is, therefore, that the week-day and the order of the daysof the week gradually became known to Indian people at the end of the thirdcentury and it became wide spread about a century later.calendar, astrology, and astronomy383"},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"Thus all the passages in Sanskrit texts which describe planets in the week-dayorder should be dated later than the end of the third century.Graha worship section of the Gr.hyasu ̄trasMany variations of the order of theninegrahasare found in the section of the rite of worshiping grahas(grahayajña)in the Gr.hyasu ̄tras. Thus the time in which this rite originated belongs to thefourth stage mentioned above. Even in one and the same text we can find differ-ent orders of enumeration. In some texts the seven planets are arranged in theorder of Sun, Mars, Moon, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn. Some texts pre-suppose the week-day order using the word kramen.aorkrama ̄t(“by the order (ofweek-day)”). Such texts or at least this part of such texts must be considered asbelonging to the later period.4Old elements are of course preserved and repeat-edly appear in the later texts, so we cannot use such elements as the means offixing the lower limit of the date of a document, while new elements can surelyserve as the criterion to judge the upper limit of the text, or at least the part ofthe text which contains them.4 Classical Period4.1 New aspectsZodiacal signsA great change of the jyotih.s ́a ̄straresulted from the introductionof Hellenistic astrology and astronomy into India. The most remarkable elementin this was the important role played by the seven planets. Other new elementstransmitted to India were the twelve zodiacal signs beginning with Aries and thetwelve astrological places beginning with the ascendant. The first point of Mes.a(a translation of the Greek word corresponding to Aries) was equated with thefirst point of the naks.atra As ́vinı ̄. With the relation 27 naks.atras =12 zodiacalsigns (i.e., 9/4 naks.atras =1 zodiacal sign), one zodiacal sign was equated to“nine quarters” of a naks.atra.Referring systemThe Sanskrit names for zodiacal signs are translations of theGreek words and in some texts we find phonetic transliterations from Greek.However, there is a remarkable difference between the western zodiacal signsand Indian signs (called ra ̄s ́i). In Indian astronomy the precession (ayana) ofequinoxes was not taken into account and the initial point of the ecliptic coor-dinates was fixed sometime about ad285.5This is the so-called nirayan.asystem.In the course of time, therefore, the true vernal equinox (V.E. in figure 18.1),moving backward, separated from the initial point (mes.a ̄di) of the nirayan.alongitude. The amount of this difference, called ayana ̄m.s ́a, has accumulated to some 23.5 degrees in modern times.

In order to keep therelation of the lunar months with the change of seasons, the lunar month namewas related to the solar month. First of all the solar month was determined bythe “entry” (sam.kra ̄ntiorsam.kraman.a) of the sun into each of the zodiacal signs.The relation between sam.kra ̄nti and the lunar month names is shown in table18.2.

In the bright half month (s ́ukla-paks.a) nothing is different,but in the dark half month (kr.s.n.na-paks.a), the pu ̄rn.ima ̄ntamonth name is aheadof the ama ̄nta month name by one. Roughly speaking, sough Indian calendarsfollow the ama ̄ntamethod, while in north India the pu ̄rn.ima ̄ntasystem has beenused since ancient times.Intercalary month (adhima ̄sa)Since a lunar month (synodic month) is a littleshorter than a solar month, sometimes there occurs a lunar month which doesnot contain any sam.kra ̄nti. Such an additional month (adhima ̄sa) was called bythe name of the following month prefixed by adhika-. In the example of figure18.2 the month after Vais ́a ̄kha is called Adhika-Jyais.t.ha. An adhima ̄sawasregarded as inauspicious and no religious ceremony was performed during thismonth. Thus it is also called malama ̄sa(“impure month”).Omitted month (ks.ayama ̄sa)In very rare cases there occurs a month which con-tains two sam.kra ̄ntis. In such cases the second sam.kra ̄ntidoes not contribute tothe naming of the month and it is omitted as ks.ayama ̄sa. When such a casehappens there are inevitably two adhima ̄sas, one before and the other after theks.ayama ̄sa.

The month containing two sam.kra ̄ntis is called am.haspati,while the second adhima ̄sa is the adhima ̄saproper when rituals are not performed(see Kane 1962: vol. 5, p. 671).The possibility ofks.ayama ̄sawas first mentioned by Bha ̄skara II in hisSiddha ̄ntas ́iroman.i.

Inthe Indian calendar the concept oftithiplays an important role in order to deter-mine whether a month contains 29 days or 30 days.In the earlier period, a tithiwas simply defined as one-thirtieth of a lunarmonth, but later it was more exactly defined as the period of time in which theincrement of the lunar longitude over the solar longitude becomes 12 degrees.In both definitions one month consists inevitably of 30 tithis. A month is dividedinto two halves (paks.as), a bright half (s ́uklapaks.a) and a dark half (kr.s.n.apaks.a)each having 15 tithis. Since the sunrise is the beginning of a civil day, the ordinalnumber of a civil day in a half month is determined by the tithiwhich is currentat the sunrise. For instance, as in figure 18.4, if the sixth tithi(t6) is current ata sunrise, the day is called “sixth day” (d6). In this example, however, the nextday (d7) contains two ends oftithi(t7 and t8) and at the sunrise of the follow-ing day the ninth tithi (t9) is current. Thus the eighth tithidoes not contributeto the naming of the civil day. The eighth day (d8), therefore, is omitted from thishalf month. This omitted day is called ks.ayadina.Additional day (adhikadina)Quite opposite to the omitted days, sometimes ithappens that a tithicontains two sunrises. In such case the same date is repeatedand the second one is called adhikadina.In the example of figure 18.5 the eighthday (d8) of this half month is repeated.Pañca ̄n.gaThe traditional Indian calendar is called pañca ̄n.ga, i.e., “that which isconsisting of five elements.” The five elements are va ̄ra (days of week), tithi,naks.atra,karan.a, and yoga.

How they got access to Greekastronomical texts and which texts were studied are not known yet. When thefirst Sanskrit astronomical text based on Greek astronomy appeared it wasalready in a well established form. The text was the A ̄ryabhat.ı ̄yaof A ̄ryabhat.a(born in ad476). During the interval of 300 years between the first Yavanaja ̄takaand the A ̄ryabhat.ı ̄yaIndian astronomers must have been occupied with the taskof Indianizing and Sanskritizing Greek astronomy. The astronomical texts of thisperiod were all lost, but fortunately we have Vara ̄hamihira’sPañcasiddha ̄ntika ̄(Neugebauer and Pingree 1970) where the five astronomical schools whichwere known in his time were summarized. They are: the Paita ̄hamasiddha ̄nta, theVasis.t.hasiddha ̄nta, the Romakasiddha ̄nta, the Paulis ́asiddha ̄nta, and the Su ̄ ryasid-dha ̄nta. Vara ̄hamihira evaluates them by the following words:The Paulis ́a is accurate, that which was pronounced by Romaka is near it; theSa ̄ vitra (i.e. the Su ̄ rya) is more accurate; the remaining two have strayed far away(from the truth). (PS 1.3; Neugebauer and Pingree 1970: 27)In fact the Paita ̄mahasiddha ̄nta, belonging to the veda ̄n.gatradition, was obsoletealready in Vara ̄hamihira’s time. What characterizes the Vasis.t.hasiddha ̄ntaisperiod relations and linear zigzag functions which are probably of Babylonianorigin. No geometrical method is used in these two older schools of astronomy.ThePaulis ́aandRomaka, which are highly regarded, are of western origin as thenames suggest. These two texts were, according to Vara ̄hamihira’s own state-ment, commented upon by a La ̄t.adeva. The author of the Su ̄ryasiddha ̄nta, themost accurate of the five siddha ̄ntas, is not known. This text is different from thelater and more popular Su ̄ ryasiddha ̄nta.388michio yanosunrisesunrisesunrisesunrisesunrised9d8 (adhika)d8d7t6t7t8t9t10Figure 18.5:Adhikadina."},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"Pre-Ptolemaic systemWhat is to be stressed here is that the Greek astronomytransmitted to India was not the system of Ptolemy who was active in the middleof the second century in Alexandria, but that of certain schools belonging to theearlier period. This can be shown from several technical aspects: for example, theeffect of the evection (second anomaly) in lunar motion, the equant point in the planetary model, and the spherical trigonometry, which were first used byPtolemy, are all absent in Indian astronomy.It is interesting that Indian astronomy preserved some older elements ofGreek astronomy which disappeared in their homeland. One of the good exam-ples in this respect is trigonometry. It was by tracking backward along this lineof transmission that the first chord table ascribed to Hipparchus (fl. 150 bc) wasrecovered by G. J. Toomer (Toomer 1973: 6–28) from an Indian sine table.Toomer showed that some numerical values ascribed to Hipparchus in Ptolemy’sAlmagest could be explained by hypothesizing the use of this reconstructed table.It does not follow, however, that the Indian astronomers were only uncriticalreceivers of Greek astronomy. Rather, they introduced the foreign elements in avery limited time through a very small number of texts, and after this initialstage of introduction all the developments were made by themselves withoutforeign influence.With the introduction of Greek astronomy, Indian astronomical constantswere greatly improved. After A ̄ryabhat.a the constants were given as the rota-tions in a maha ̄yuga(4,320,000 years) or in a kalpa(4,320,000,000 years).The number of civil days (D) in a maha ̄yugais the difference between thenumber of the rotations of fixed stars (Rs) and those of the Sun (Y). Similarly,the number of lunar months (M) is the difference between the Moon’s rotations(Rm) and those of the Sun. As we have seen in the jyotis.aveda ̄n.ga, the differencebetween the number of lunar months and that of solar months (12Y) is thenumber of intercalary months (A). In the same way the difference between thenumber oftithis(T) and that of civil days is the number of omitted days (K).Let us give a set of these numbers according to the later Su ̄ ryasiddha ̄nta,belonging to about the eighth or ninth century. From table 18.3 we can get thelength of a solar (i.e. sidereal) year and that of a synodic month:calendar, astrology, and astronomy389Table 18.3Fixed starsRs1,582,237,828Solar yearsY4,320,000Civil daysD=Rs-Y1,577,917,828Sidereal monthsRm57,753,336Synodic monthsM=Rm-Y53,433,336Intercalary monthsA=M-12Y1,593,336TithisT=30¥M1,603,000,080Omitted daysK=T-D25,082,580"},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"390michio yanoThese numbers are good enough to prepare a calendar. This is why there stillsurvive some traditional calendars which are based on the Su ̄ ryasiddha ̄ntaandwhich give almost the same results as my computer program mentioned above.Kali yuga epochSince the mean positions of the Sun and Moon and the planetsare the function of time, one should assume a certain time as the initial point ofcalculation. The class of astronomical literature called karan.ais characterized bythe use of an epoch which is not very far back from the time of the text, whilethesiddha ̄ntatexts employed an epoch in a very remote past where all the planetswere assumed to be in mean conjunction at the starting point of the eclipticcoordinates. The epoch was sought by means of indeterminate equations of thefirst degree – at a certain time true positions were observed and they were con-verted into mean positions, while the mean motions of all the planets had beensomehow known. The epoch arrived at by this method was midnight of Febru-ary 17/18 in 3102 bcaccording to the midnight (a ̄rdhara ̄trika) school, and thesunrise of February 18 (Friday) of the same year according to the sunrise(audayika) school. That the epoch was very accurately chosen can be demon-strated by the fact that even today we can get a fairly good calendar using thisepoch and the constants of the siddha ̄ntatexts.Planetary theoryThe numbers for the rotations of planets are also given inastronomical texts. They vary slightly according to the schools (Pingree 1981:15). Let us give here (table 18.4) those from the later Su ̄ ryasiddha ̄nta.solar year =365.258757,synodic month =DYDM==29 530588..Table 18.4Rotations in a Maha ̄ yugaFixed stars1,582,237,828Saturn146,580Jupiter364,212Mars2,296,832Sun4,320,000Ve n u s ’ ss ́ı ̄ghra7,022,364Mercury’ss ́ı ̄ghra17,937,076Moon57,753,336Moon’s apogee488,203Moon’s node-232,246"},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"The “rotations of the fixed stars” in this table is the “rotations of the earth onits axis” according to A ̄ryabhat.a, because he thought that the earth was movingwhile the stars were fixed. But no Indian astronomers followed his idea untilNı ̄lakan.t.ha of the sixteenth century. The different behaviors of the outer planets(Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars) and the inner planets (Venus and Mercury) wereknown to Indian astronomers. The numbers given for the outer planets are theirsidereal rotations and those of their s ́ı ̄ghra(literally “swift one”) are equal to thatof the Sun. Those numbers for the inner planets are the rotations of the s ́ı ̄ghra,while their sidereal rotations are equal to that of the Sun. From modern astro-nomical point of view, therefore, the s ́ı ̄ghracan be interpreted as the mean Sun.Since, however, ancient Indian planetary theory was geocentric, they regardedthes ́ı ̄ghraas rotating on the geocentric orbit of the planet and constantlydrawing the planet in its direction.After computing the longitude of the mean planets as the function of timesince epoch, the true position was obtained by means of the eccentric-epicyclictheory. Here is a remarkable difference from Ptolemy’s theory. Ptolemy combinedtwo effects which cause the irregular motions of planets, namely, that of eccen-tricity and that of anomaly, and put them together in a single geometric model.In doing so he had to introduce a controversial point, which was later called the“equant,” outside the center of the eccentric circle. In India, on the other hand,the two effects were kept separate and no unified model was conceived. One wascalled the manda(literally “slow one”) epicycle which explains, in modern words,the combined effects of the eccentricities of the Sun and the planet, the otherwas called the sı ̄ghra epicycle as mentioned above. The effects of these two ele-ments for each planet were separately tabulated. The procedures of using thetwo tables in order to get the final equation (antyaphala) show some variationsdepending on the school. Thus we can say that Indian planetary theory is nottotally geometrical. Once they introduced geometrical models from the west,they developed their own functional method.It is worth mentioning that A ̄ryabhat.a’s school survived in south India, espe-cially in Kerala, and was revived as the Ma ̄dhava school in the fourteenthcentury. The culmination of this school is Nı ̄lakan.t.ha (1444 to after 1542), whotried to combine the two effects in a single geometrical model, and the result wasquite similar to the partial heliocentric model of Tycho Brahe.Notes1I follow Dr. Ohashi’s interpretation.

Just as Pa ̄n.ini’s famous linguistic study ofSanskrit leaps into the historical record fully formed, like the Buddha from QueenMaya’s side, so the medical encyclopedias too emerge with a learned medicaltradition in an almost fully articulated form.The antecedentsIn the case of Pa ̄n.ini, we do have some preceding literature, which shows ustraditional Indian linguistics in its childhood, so to speak, notably the Nirukta of Ya ̄ska, as well as the various s ́iks.a ̄andpra ̄tis ́a ̄khya texts. But in the case ofmedicine far less precursory material has survived. Early medical texts which are now known only by name include the Jatu ̄karn.atantra, the Ha ̄rı ̄tasam.hita ̄, thePa ra ̄s ́arasam.hita ̄, and the Kharana ̄dasam.hita ̄, all of which apparently existed at thetime of S ́ivada ̄sa who commented on the Carakasam.hita ̄in the fifteenth century.Other lost works include the Vis ́va ̄mitrasam.hita ̄, the Atrisam.hita ̄, the Kapilatantra,and the Gautamatantra (Roy 1986: 157–9 and Meulenbeld 1999–2002:Ia.145–79, 369–71, 689–99). But even before these specialist treatises onmedicine, there is a certain amount of material on the history of medicine whichcan be recovered from earlier, chiefly religious, texts.Medicine in Vedic timesIt is often claimed that a ̄yurveda evolved organicallyfrom the medical traditions discernible in Vedic literature. The respected scholarMira Roy, for example, draws attention to several areas of apparent continuity"},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"between the Vedic concepts, especially from the Atharvaveda, and the a ̄yurvediccompendia (1986:6.155f.). One of the examples she cites is the fact that five vitalbreaths are mentioned in both the Atharvaveda and the Carakasam.hita ̄(AV10.2.13, Ca.su ̄.12.8).But on closer examination, all of these supposed parallels break down. Thus,it is true that Caraka’s Compendiumdoes have a discourse on the five vitalbreaths. This discourse is put into the mouth of a scholar called Va ̄yorvida (“hewho knows about air”), who presents his theory as a cornerstone of physiology.As soon as he finishes his description, another scholar, Marı ̄ci, disputes his state-ment impatiently, saying (Ca.su ̄.12.9):Even if this is so, what is its general relevance to the purpose of this discussion orwith knowledge of medical science? This is a discussion on the subject of medicalscience!Va ̄yorvida tries to defend his point of view briefly, but without introducing anynew ideas, and Ma ̄rica proceeds to put forward his own view that fire (agni) isthe cornerstone of medicine. This too is superseded by the sage Ka ̄pya with yetanother view that somais the cornerstone, and so the discussion continues. Theconclusion presented by the chairman of the debate, Punarvasu A ̄treya, is thatwhile he regrets contradicting anyone, health ultimately comes down to abalance of the three humors (dos.as) (Ca.su ̄.12.13).All we can really deduce from these passages is that a doctrine of five breathsexisted at the time of the composition of the medical encyclopedias. Of coursethis is well known: the five breaths are already discussed in the much earlier lit-erature of the Upanis.ads and Bra ̄hman.as. But although the doctrine of thebreaths is mentioned in the early medical texts, it does not become an importantpart of medical thought or practice until the composition of a much later workcalled the A ̄yurvedasu ̄tra. This synthetic work, probably written in the early sev-enteenth century, tries for the first time to combine doctrines from a ̄yurveda anda form of tantric yoga (Meulenbeld 1999–2002: IIa.499 ff.).Roy herself finally concludes that in spite of some superficial similarities,A ̄yurveda, which incorporates different traditions [from the Veda], has a distinctplace alongside of the Vedas.. . . Although glorified as an appendage of Vedicliterature, A ̄yurveda as such is not mentioned there. (1986:6.156)Roy points out that although a later Vedic text, the R.gvedapra ̄tis ́a ̄khya (16.54),refers to a medical treatise called Good Medicine (subhes.aja), it is the Maha ̄bha ̄ratathat first refers to medicine as a science of eight parts (cikitsa ̄ya ̄m.as.t.a ̄n.ga ̄ya ̄m.2.50.80), and uses the word “a ̄yurveda” as the name of the science of medicine(12.28.44, 12.328.9, 12.330.22).TheCompendiumof Caraka contains a passage in which the physician isadvised on how to respond, when pressed by questioners on the subject of whichVeda his science belongs to (Ca.su ̄.30.21). He should answer that he is devotedto the Atharvaveda because that Veda prescribes rituals and prayers to enhanceand prolong life, and this is the purpose of medicine too. The context suggests394dominik wujastyk"},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"that this passage should be read as a slightly knowing suggestion, in which thephysician is being advised to claim allegiance to a Veda because his interlocutorrequires it of him, and as part of a didactic strategy, rather than for any morefundamental reason connected with real historical connections. It is temptingto read Roy’s arguments above, and others like them, as adhering to exactly thisancient recommendation.If a ̄yurveda does not derive from Vedic medical traditions, what then are itsantecedents?This has been one of the most outstanding problems for the history ofa ̄yurveda for most of the last century. One serious suggestion which has recurredin the literature on a ̄yurvedic history is that some of the the innovative doctrinesof a ̄yurveda were taken from Greek physicians in Gandha ̄ra. Jean Filliozat testedthis idea in his book on classical Indian medicine, and indeed found parallelsbetween Indian and Greek thought, especially regarding the doctrines of breath(Skt.pra ̄n.a, Grk. pneuma) (Filliozat 1964). But Indian medical literature has noloan-words from Greek, and is in this respect quite different from the Indianastral sciences (jyotih.s ́a ̄stra) which have borrowed many items of Greek vocabu-lary. There are philologically puzzling words in a ̄yurveda, for example jenta ̄ka,meaning a steam bath or sauna. This is almost certainly not a Sanskrit word inorigin, but it is not from the Greek either, and its origin has not yet been traced.In fact, Michio Yano has, as reported elsewhere in this volume, discovered oneGreek word in the early Sanskrit medical corpus. The word horã(w ̆ra) occurs inSus ́ruta’s Compendium(Su.su ̄.32.4) in a passage listing omens which foretell thedeath of a patient. If the patient’s zodiacal sign (hora ̄) has burning lights ormeteors in it, the patient is doomed. This proves that the compiler of this part ofthe text was already aware of the Hellenistic astrology that became available inIndia during the second century ce. But this makes it even more striking thatnot one Greek loanword for a medical term appears in Sanskrit medical litera-ture. Indian physicians almost certainly had the opportunity to imbibe Greekmedical ideas, but apparently no motive.Until recently, few other serious ideas had been mooted for the origin ofa ̄yurveda. The conjecture that a ̄yurveda embodies traditions that somehowcame from the Indus valley civilization is tempting, of course, but impossible toestablish. Scholars working within a traditional framework have tended not toengage with the problem, because of the strong traditional belief that a ̄yurvedais indeed a continuation of medicine from the Vedic sam.hita ̄s. Many texts on thehistory of a ̄yurveda, even written by contemporary scholars, start by repeatingthe mythological accounts given in the beginning of the sam.hita ̄s in whichmedicine is passed from the gods to the humans through a chain of divine beingsand spiritual teachers. Such scholars seem unable or unwilling to see such anaccount for what it is, a common frame for initiating any orthodox s ́a ̄stra, whichoccurs in variant forms at the beginning of a number of other major texts, suchas the Br.hajja ̄taka, and in various places in pura ̄n.ic literature (Pollock 1985; Zysk1999).Accounts of origins cast as historical discourses can be considered as havingtwo dimensions: a horizontal and a vertical, rather as Ferdinand de Saussurethe science of medicine395"},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"divided linguistic study into orthogonal diachronic and synchronic dimensions.The horizontal dimension is that of mundane time: history in this dimension isa narrative of the events of past times. The vertical dimension measures close-ness to God: the history of this dimension is the account of how the presentmanifest situation has evolved, or descended, from an original, pristine world ofabsolute unity. When at the start of a Sanskrit text we are told by the author, asso often happens, that the work once consisted of millions of verses, but washanded from the original omniscient sages to human scholars only in abbrevi-ated form, we must understand that we are dealing with vertical history. This isthe story of how knowledge – which is essentially of God – has come to us meremortals. Such a spiritual narrative is not to be confused or conflated with hori-zontal history, although the narrative may be cast in the language of past tensesand linear teacher–pupil descent. What we are being told is how the presentwork is an imperfect reflection of divine omniscience, a mirror – and manySanskrit texts are called “Mirrors” of this or that subject – of what is known inheaven. So when, at the start of the foundational texts of Sanskrit medicine, weare told of the passage of medical knowledge from the gods to ancient sages suchas Dhanvantari and A ̄treya, and thence to other humans such as Agnives ́a andSus ́ruta, to Caraka and Na ̄ga ̄rjuna, we do not necessarily need to try to grasp allthese figures as historical personages in the horizontal dimension. We are in thepresence, rather, of a kind ofapologia, an explanation of how something whichwas (past tense!) perfect, is now presented, brought into the present, in the blem-ished, mundane form of a textbook. It is an account of how knowledge whichwas once privileged is now commonly accessible.It was Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya who first began to grapple with thesociology of Indian medical history in his fascinating book Science and Society inAncient India (Calcutta, 1977). In that text he presented strong arguments forconsidering the early medical encyclopedias to be nonreligious, empiricallyoriented works which had undergone a secondary process of “Hinduization,” in order to make them into works acceptable to a Hindu brahmin elite.Chattopadhyaya, writing from a Communist perspective on Indian history, hadhis own motivations for discovering materialist and empirical traditions wher-ever possible in Indian intellectual history, and this probably biased manyreaders against accepting his conclusions about the history of Indian medicine.In the case of a ̄yurveda, however, there is much to commend his arguments. Buteven Chattopadhyaya was not able to suggest where this empirical traditioncame from.Medicine in the Buddhist communityEvidence for the beginnings of a system-atic science of medicine in India appears first in the literature of the earliestBuddhists, with many medical tales being recounted in the Tripit.aka. The Buddhainstructed his monks to care for each other in sickness, since they had aban-doned the social structures which would have provided them with treatment ifthey had not left their families to become monks.396dominik wujastyk"},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"You, O bhikkhus, have neither a mother nor a father who could nurse you. If, Obhikkhus, you do not nurse one another, who, then, will nurse you? Whoever, Obhikkhus, would nurse me, he should nurse the sick. (Maha ̄vagga 8.26.3, cited inZysk 1998: 41)The earliest Buddhist monks seem to have concentrated on providing medicalhelp only for each other, but before long the lay community started to requesthelp from the monks. Zysk (1998) has collected evidence to show that earlyBuddhist monasteries included infirmaries and had standing instructions to aidall those who were sick, not only monks.Buddhist monks thus seem to have taken an active attitude to their ownhealth and that of their lay supporters. This attitude may have been encouragedby the many medical epithets and turns of phrase attributed to the Buddha inthe recorded sermons. In his parables he often used images such as “removingthe arrows of suffering.” One of the forms in which the Buddha has been reveredsince at least the first century ceis as the “Medicine Buddha” (bhais.ajyaguru),and there is even a su ̄tra devoted to him under this name (Zysk 1998: 62).Zysk’s research into the medical materials recoverable from the Buddhistcanon has revealed close similarities with the classical Sanskrit sources onmedicine. It now seems almost certain that the foundations of classical a ̄yurvedawere being laid at the time of early Buddhism in the Buddhist and other asceticcommunities.In the centuries of Buddhist missionary expansion, Indian medical doctrineswere carried across the Himalayas into Central Asia and beyond, as well as intoSri Lanka. The rare manuscripts that have survived from this diaspora, such asthe Bower Manuscripts, share a common character: they are practical hand-books, manuals listing ailments and explaining the herbs and compounds thatshould be administered to cure them (Wujastyk 2001: ch. 4). There is littletheory, little explanation, little philosophy. In this they differ from the classicalcompendia of a ̄yurveda.It is also possible that some important authors of Sanskrit medical texts, suchas the famous Va ̄gbhat.a, were Buddhists.The Medical BodyThe medical system which evolved from this ascetic milieu contained a sophis-ticated set of doctrines, supported by close observation and long experience oftreating patients.The body to which Indian medicine addresses itself is the physical body asunderstood to the senses and to empirical examination. In particular, a ̄yurvedaknows no cakras, nor the spinal conduits of breath (pra ̄n.a) known from tantricliterature. The concept of the cakras has today entered public consciousnessworld-wide, and is widely viewed as an ancient and immutable element of theIndian world view. This view needs to be qualified in two directions. First, thethe science of medicine397"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"idea of the cakras is a relatively recent development in Indian tantric thought. Itis datable only to the tenth century ce, making its appearance in texts such astheKubjika ̄matatantra and the Ma ̄linı ̄vijayottaratantra (Heilijgers-Seelen 1990).Secondly, the cakras make no appearance whatsoever in a ̄yurveda. Notwith-standing the contemporary growth of various forms of massage and therapyfocussed on the cakras, there is no such theme in the classical Sanskrit literatureon medicine. The cakras really are an idea specific to tantra and yoga, and it isnot until relatively recent times that this idea has been synthesized with medicalthought and practice.With a customary Indian interest in itemization (Smith 1994), the a ̄yurvedicliterature is keen to enumerate the receptacles, ligatures, conduits, orifices, andtissues which can be found in the human body. The S ́a ̄rn.gadharasam.hita ̄(ca.1300) offers a fairly standard and clearly-presented version of such a list(Wujastyk 2001: 322–8). There are: 7 receptacles (a ̄s ́aya); 7 body tissues (dha ̄tu);7 impurities of the body tissues (dha ̄tumala); 7 subsidiary body tissues (upadha ̄tu);7 membranes (tvac); 3 humors (dos.a); 900 sinews (sna ̄yu); 210 ligaments(sandhi); 300 bones (asthi); 107 lethal points (marman); 700 ducts (sira ̄); 24 pipes(dhamanı ̄); 500 muscles (ma ̄m.sapes ́ı ̄); 20 extra ones for women; 16 tendons(kan.d.ara ̄); 10 orifices of the male body; 13 orifices of the female body. Althoughthese items may not in all cases be organs in the modern biomedical sense(Zimmermann 1983), there is a definite sense that a ̄yurveda views the body asa locus of medical organs and processes which would be recognizable in generalterms to a modern anatomist. After making his own much earlier enumerationof anatomical parts, Caraka noted, perhaps wistfully, that (Ca.s ́a ̄.7.17),The parts of the body cannot, however, be counted because they are divided intotiny atoms (parama ̄n.u), and these are too numerous, too minute, and beyond per-ception. The cause of the conjunction and separation of these tiny atoms is wind(va ̄yu) and an innate disposition to action (karmasvabha ̄va).This demonstrates an acute sense of the limits of possible scientific investigation,but at the same time contains fascinating and plausible suggestions about thenature of these “tiny atoms.” Throughout medical and scientific discourse inSanskrit, “wind” often appears in contexts which would, in early Europeanscientific discourse, require the word “force.”The metabolic processThe central process of the body is digestion. The Sanskrit words for the processesof digestion (pa ̄cana, d ı ̄pana) all imply “cooking” or “burning.” And the digestiveforce itself is simply called the “fire” (agni), or “fire in the belly” (ja ̄t.hara ̄gni). Oncefood has been eaten and cooked by this digestive fire, it turns into the first of theseven “body tissues” (dha ̄tu), namely chyme or chyle (rasa), the pulpy juice towhich food is reduced in the stomach. Then the other principle of heat in thebody, choler (pitta), goes to work and the chyle is transformed into the next bodytissue in the chain, blood. Blood transforms into flesh, and similarly the remain-398dominik wujastyk"},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"ing tissues, fat, bone, and marrow; are converted one into the next, until theseventh and highest essence of the body is generated: semen. This, of course,suggests a purely male view of the body, and a ̄yurveda’s picture of women’smetabolism includes no obvious equivalent to semen: the evolution of the chainof body tissues does not seem to fit the substances in a woman’s body. Onepassage in Sus ́ruta’s Compendiumlocates menstrual blood in the place of semen;another seems to suggest a certain degree of homology between male semen andfemale breast-milk. Yet another passage suggests that two women having inter-course may “somehow” (katham.cana) produce semen (Su.ni.10.18–23ab,Su.s ́a ̄.2.47). A ̄yurveda understands conception as the union of male semen andfemale menstrual blood (there is no concept of “ovum”). It is the woman’s blooddischarged during menstruation, but retained during pregnancy (when it istransformed into breast-milk), which joins with male semen and goes towardsbuilding a child’s body.Sus ́ruta’s Compendiumgives the time scale for this principle metabolic process(Su.su ̄.14.10–16). The nutritive juice (rasa) spends about 108 hours in each ofthe body tissues. Thus, it takes a lunar month for the nutritive juice to becomesemen, or menstrual blood. The total time spent in metabolizing is 648 hours.In a curious and interesting verse, Sus ́ruta notes that, “This nutritive juice (rasa)flows throughout the whole body like a tiny particle, in a manner similar to the propagation of sound, light, and water.”2However, this is not the normala ̄yurvedic conception of how fluids are transported around the body. How thenis the irrigation of the body – a metaphor used by Sus ́ruta – carried out?Fluids and their conduitsThe types of fluid in the a ̄yurvedic body include blood (rakta), milk, semen,breath (pra ̄n.a), the juice of digested food (rasa), and the humors wind (va ̄ta), bile(pitta), and phlegm (kapha).These fluids are transported from place to place by three principle types ofconduit: ducts (sira ̄), pipes (dhamanı ̄), and tubes (srotas). Given the importanceof this system of fluid distribution to the a ̄yurvedic physiology, surprisingly littlework has been done on clarifying what these conduits do, and how they areexplained in a ̄yurvedic theory (exceptions include Dasgu.pta 1969: ii.l3 andKutumbiah 1999: ch. 2).Ducts(sira ̄)According to the Sus ́rutasam.hita ̄, the function of the 700 ducts isto carry wind, bile, phlegm, and blood around the body, starting from their originin the navel. In a vivid pair of metaphors, one agricultural and one botanical,Sus ́ruta’s text describes the ducts as follows (Su.s ́a ̄.7.3):As a garden or a field is irrigated by water-carrying canals, and each part receivesnourishment, so the ducts provide nutrition to the body by means of their con-traction and dilation. Their branches are just like the veins on a leaf.the science of medicine399"},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"A point of special interest is that the ducts are colored according to what theycarry: those carrying wind are yellowish brown (arun.a), those carrying bile aredark blue, those carrying phlegm are white, and those carrying blood are red(Su.s ́a ̄.7.18). It seems likely that these distinctions are based on the observationof different-colored vessels under the surface of the skin. In yet another simile,Sus ́ruta likens the distribution of these ducts from the umbilical center throughthe body to the spokes radiating from the center of a wheel (Su.s ́a ̄.7.7).Pipes(dhamanı ̄)There are said to be 24 pipes in the body (Su.s ́a ̄.9). Like the ducts, they originate in the navel. From there, 10 go up, 10 down, and 4 sideways.Those which go up from the navel support the body by carrying particularitems (vis ́es.a) such as sound, touch, vision, taste, smell, out-breath (pras ́va ̄sa), in-breath (ucchva ̄sa), yawning, sneezing, laughter, speech, crying, etc. These 10pipes go from the navel to the heart and there each one divides into 3 branches,thus producing 30 pipes. Ten of these are devoted to carrying the humors, wind,bile, and phlegm, as well as blood and nutritive fluid (two pipes for each sub-stance). Eight more carry sense impressions: sound, form, taste, and smell(again, two pipes each). Two pipes are used for speech (bha ̄s.a ̄), two for makingsound (ghos.a), two for sleeping, and two more for waking up. Two pipes carrytears. Two pipes connected to the breasts carry women’s breast-milk; curiously,in men the same two pipes are said to carry semen from the breasts.Those pipes which go down from the navel carry substances such as wind,urine, feces, semen, and menstrual blood. In between the receptacles of raw anddigested food, the pipes divide into three branches, as before. The first 10 pipeshave the same functions as the first 10 upward pipes. The next two carry foodto the intestines, and another two carry water. Two carry urine to the bladder.Two generate and transport semen, and two make it ejaculate. In women, thesame four pipes carry and discharge menstrual blood. Two pipes are connectedto the intestines and function in defecation. The remaining 8 pipes supply sweatto the horizontal pipes.Each of the four pipes which run sideways are said to subdivide hundreds ofthousands of times, holding the body together in a network. Their ends are con-nected to the hair follicles, and through these sweat is carried out and nutritivejuice is carried in. This is how massage oils, showers, and ointments can movethrough the skin and affect the body internally. They are also the means bywhich pleasant and unpleasant sensations of touch are experienced.Tubes (srotas)According to Sus ́ruta, there are initially 22 tubes in the body, 2for each of 11 substances. Two of the tubes (srotas) carry breath (pra ̄n.a), andare joined to the heart and the pipes (dhamanı ̄) which carry nutritive juice. Twomore carry food, and are joined to the food-carrying pipes and the stomach. Two400dominik wujastyk"},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"carry water and are joined to the palate and the lung (kloman). Two carry nutri-tive juice and are joined to the same places as those carrying breath. Two carryblood, and are joined to the liver, the spleen, and the pipes which carry blood.Two carry flesh, and are joined to the ligaments, skin, and pipes which carryblood. Two carry fat and are joined to the waist (kat.ı ̄) and the kidneys. Two carryurine and are joined to the bladder and penis. Two carry feces and are joined tothe receptacle of digested food and the rectum. Two carry semen and are joinedto the breasts and testicles. Two carry menstrual blood and are joined to thewomb and the pipes which carry menstrual blood. (There is no suggestion thatthese last pairs are specific to either gender.) Caraka adds three more categoriesof tube: two carrying bone, two carrying marrow (completing the set of 7 basicbody elements (dha ̄tu)), and two carrying sweat. He omits menstrual blood. Likethe horizontal pipes, the tubes in the body divide and subdivide into innumer-able tiny branches.In contrast to the ducts and pipes, the description of these tubes is embeddedin a discourse of injury, and the symptoms arising from damage to them arelisted.Sus ́ruta records the existence of an ancient disagreement amongst physiciansas to whether the pipes, ducts, and tubes are really separate types of vessel, andin particular whether there is a significant difference between pipes (dhamanı ̄)and tubes (srotas). He argues that there is indeed a difference between these three types of vessel: they look different, have different connections, and differ-ent functions. The authoritative tradition of medical science also asserts theirdifference. It is merely because of their close proximity, similarity, and small sizethat they are conflated. Caraka also testifies to contemporary debates about thenature of these vessels; he records – and rejects – an extreme view that thehuman body consists only of a conglomeration of tubes.DiagnosisAnother disagreement in the early medical tradition concerns the methods ofdiagnosis. Caraka uses the traditional scheme of the three “epistemological standards” (prama ̄n.a) as the basis for his diagnostic scheme. Diseases arediscovered by means of the combined application of authoritative testimony, direct perception, and inference. The tradition of medical learning and sciencecounts as authority. Direct perception means examining the patient using all the senses, although Caraka is distinctly squeamish about the sense of taste, andoffers several ways of avoiding the need to taste the patient. Finally, inference is used to deduce the state of nonvisible features of the patient’s body andfunctioning.Using a simpler approach, Sus ́ruta first records the tradition that there arethree methods a physician should use to examine a patient: touching, looking,and questioning. But he then argues that a doctor has five senses, and that the science of medicine401"},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"he should use all of them when examining a patient. For some reason, thiscommon-sense view did not prevail in later medical textbooks, nor did Caraka’scomplex system. Later medical tradition normally reproduces Sus ́ruta’s triple-examination method.PulseDebate and questioning on the topic of diagnosis probably continued, for by thelate fifteenth century a new set of diagnostic methods had emerged as standard,the “examination of the eight bases” (as.t.astha ̄naparı ̄ks.a ̄): pulse, urine, eyes, face,tongue, faeces, voice, and skin. These methods are first mentioned as a fixed setin the Jvaratimirabha ̄skara of the Mewari physician Ca ̄mun.d.a (fl. ca. 1474–1538;Meulenbeld 1999–2002: IIa.165), and become a standard in later medicaltextbooks.The diagnosis of disease by pulse first appears in Sanskrit in the fourteenth-century Compendiumof S ́a ̄rn.gadhara (Wujastyk 2001: ch. 7). He begins bydescribing the pipe (dhamanı ̄) on the hand at the base of the thumb as “an indi-cator of life,” and notes that an expert can tell the well-being or ill health of thebody by its behavior. He then connects various humoral conditions with differ-ent movements felt in the tube (na ̄d.ı ̄). Thus, inflamed wind feels like the move-ment of a leech or a snake; inflamed bile feels like the gait of a sparrow-hawk,crow or frog; inflamed phlegm feels like the gait of a swan or pigeon. The tube is also characterized as feeling weak or strong, cold or hot, firm or sluggish(Wujastyk 2001: 318).In S ́a ̄rn.gadhara’s text, and until the advent of influences from Europeanmedicine, the understanding and use of pulse is closely tied to prognosticationtechniques. The ability to foretell the course of a patient’s illness has formed apart of a ̄yurvedic medicine from the earliest times. Caraka, for example, devotesa section of his Compendium, the Indriyastha ̄na, to the various signs by which adoctor can read the impending death of a patient. Thus, a patient who is aboutto die is called blossomed (pus.pita), partly because of the metaphor of a flowerinevitably preceding a fruit, and partly because a dying person may produceunusual and unexpected smells, including the smell of various flowers. Inlooking for signs of death, the physician is advised to feel the patients body fortemperature, perspiration, and resilience. He should also look for changes in thebreathing and in the pulsations at the nape of the neck (Ca.ni.3.6). Thus, whenthe examination of the pulse appears in a ̄yurveda, it fits well into a precedingtradition of prognostication. In a medical tradition which does not know of thepumping function of the heart or of the circulation of the blood, one has to askwhat the physicians thought they were feeling in the pulse (cf. Kuriyama 1999).The position of the first historical description of a ̄yurvedic pulse lore, inS ́a ̄rn.gadhara’s text, immediately precedes his sections on the interpretation of omens and dreams. This context sheds important light on how this newdiagnostic technique was understood.3402dominik wujastyk"},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"Disease EtiologyThe question of disease etiology in a ̄yurveda is of great interest, and is far more sophisticated than the simple idea that “disease is an imbalance of thehumors,” although this statement is certainly part of the classical tradition. One of the central etiological ideas in a ̄yurveda is the “abrogation of wisdom”(prajña ̄para ̄dha), the idea that we fall ill through actions that follow lapses of judg-ment.4This “judgment” (prajña ̄) consists of the combined work of three mentalfaculties: intelligence (dhı ̄), will-power (dhr.ti), and memory (smr.ti).5As anexample of impaired intelligence, the classical authors cite errors such as mis-taking something permanent as temporary, or something harmful as helpful,etc. Poor will-power would be exemplified by a lack of self-control in the face ofsensual enjoyments which are unhealthy. Faulty memory is exemplified when aperson’s mind becomes so confused by passion or darkness, that they cease to beable to see things as they really are, and they cannot remember what should beremembered. The concept of memory is expanded elsewhere in Caraka’s Com-pendiuminto a full-blown doctrine of yogic self-remembering, strongly reminis-cent of the Buddhist mindfulness (sati).6Erroneous mental processes are likelyto lead a person to engage in several types of faulty action. The person maymisuse or abuse their senses, body, speech, or mind in various ways, and thisabuse leads to sickness.A related cause of illness is the suppression of natural urges. Urges related tourine or feces, semen, wind, nausea, sneezing, clearing the throat, and yawningshould always be obeyed, without hesitation. So should the urgings of hungerand thirst, tears, sleep, or the panting induced by exertion. The suppression ofany of these natural urges can lead to disease and is another example of a lapseof good judgment. Of course, bad urges, such as to impetuous or dishonorabledeeds, should be suppressed, and this applies also to extreme feelings of negativeemotion, the vocal expression of hatred or criticism, or physical violence.Yet another disease etiology is the operation of karma: diseases afflict peopledue abrogations of their good judgment in the past. In the medical texts, theworkings of karma are described in more detail than is usual. The karma onecreated oneself during a previous embodiment shows itself in the present as goodor bad luck. Added to that is the further karma one creates in the present life-time. These two kinds of karma may be graded according to strength or weak-ness: karma can be low, medium, or superior. A combination of the superiorkinds of the two karma types gives rise to a long and happy lifetime. A com-bination of the low ones brings about a short and miserable life, and a com-bination of medium karmas is expected to result in an average lifespan.7Theliterature of “the ripening of deeds” (karmavipa ̄ka) develops these ideas, some-times in great detail, with personal case histories exemplifying diseases and theirkarmic antecedents (Pingree 1997; Wujastyk 1999).Demonic interference and possession was viewed as another valid cause ofillness. Women and children are particularly vulnerable to such possession,the science of medicine403"},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"which is also often presented as a punishment for bad deeds (Wujastyk 1999).Disease contagion is not a standard feature of the a ̄yurvedic understanding ofhow illness arises (Zysk 2000; Das 2000), but interestingly a form of spirit-contagion is described in Ka ̄s ́yapa’s Compendium, in which a demon (graha)which has taken up abode in one unfortunate person may be transferred toanother by means of touch (Wujastyk 2001: ch. 5).TherapyA ̄yurveda recommends a wide range of therapeutic techniques, including herbaldrugs, massage, sauna, exercise, diet (including the use of meat broths and othernon-vegetarian and alcoholic tonics), blood-letting (including leeching), simplepsychotherapy, and surgery. One important group of five therapies (pañcakar-man) became established early. According to Caraka, these were: emetics, pur-gation, two types of enema, and nasal catharsis. Sus ́ruta replaced one of theenema treatments with bloodletting. Other authors introduced sweating andmassage, as well as other therapies, into what became historically an increas-ingly important and elaborate complex of treatments.Almost every other therapeutic application in a ̄yurveda is preceded by astandard regime of oiling and sweating. “Oiling” usually consists of taking oilsor fats by mouth, often with food. But it can also consist of oil enemas, nasaldrops, bodily anointing, gargling, or the application of oils to the head, eyes, orears. “Sweating” can mean warming the body by any of a range of methods:with a hot cloth, a warm metal plate, or the hands, the application of hot poul-tices, taking a traditional steam sauna, or the pouring of infusions of herbs andmeats over the patient from a kettle. These preliminaries help to open the chan-nels in the patient’s body and to liquefy the humors which have been causingblockages, enabling them either to flow out of the body through the digestivetract, or to return to their proper locations in the body.SurgeryThe discussion of surgery in early a ̄yurveda is most highly developed in the Com-pendiumof Sus ́ruta. There are many chapters here on such topics as the train-ing of the surgeon, the preparation and maintenance of a wide range of scalpels,probes, pincers, and other surgical tools, and the diagnosis of medical problemswhich are to be treated specifically by surgery. Elaborate and varied surgicaltechniques are described, including perineal lithotomy, ophthalmological couch-ing for cataract, the reduction of dislocations, the lancing of boils, the piercingof earlobes, the removal of obstructions and foreign bodies of all kinds from the404dominik wujastyk"},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"flesh and orifices, rhinoplasty and the repair of hare-lip, and the suturing ofwounds (Mukhopa ̄dhya ̄ya 1913; Majno 1975; Wujastyk 2001: ch. 3). Sus ́ruta’ssurgical chapters are justly famous. Why such an extraordinarily advancedschool of surgery should have arisen so early in India, and why its work shouldhave been recorded in Sanskrit, remain unanswered questions. The vibrant tra-dition evidenced by Sus ́ruta’s text did not survive as part of professional medicalpractice, although isolated techniques such as cataract couching did continueto be performed by barber-surgeons in a tradition apparently unsupported by alearned literature or formal training.Materia medicaA large part of the a ̄yurvedic literature, including general works, monographs,and dictionaries, is devoted to herbal medicine and materia medica generally.Several thousand plants are known and described in terms of a pharmacologi-cal typology based on flavorings (six types), potency (usually two: hot and cold),post-digestive flavorings (usually three), and pragmatic efficacy (used when theeffect of a medicine is not adequately defined by the earlier categories). Thistypology is keyed to the system of humors and other physiological categories asexpressed through the vocabulary of pathology. The system of humors functionsin medicine in somewhat the same manner as the “case function” (ka ̄raka)system in Pa ̄n.inian grammar. Just as the six case functions provide the gram-marian with a set of categories though which the urge to express a meaning(vivaks.a ̄) can be related to morphological units of grammar, so the three medicalhumors provide a set of mediating categories through which diseases can berelated to herbal medicines.Rules of interpretationThere are certain rules of interpretation (paribha ̄s.a ̄) which are applied whenusing herbal medicines, and these exemplify the important notion of “defaultvalues” which Frits Staal has highlighted elsewhere in this volume in the contextof ritual and grammar. Thus, unless otherwise stated, the time of any action isdawn, the part of a plant is the root, the quantity of substances is equal, the con-tainer is made of clay, the liquid is water, and the oil is from sesame. By default,herbs should be fresh, not dried, and fresh herbs should be used in double the specified measure (Wujastyk 2001: ch. 7). There are many other standarddefaults which are silently applied in medical situations, including a set ofmore than 30 subtle and interesting rules called “the logic of the system”(tantrayukti) which are to be used when interpreting medical statements(Su.ut.65, Ca.si.12.41–48).8the science of medicine405"},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"Medical PhilosophySeveral modern authors have written about the interesting philosophical pas-sages which occur in the early medical literature, especially in Caraka’s Com-pendium(e.g., Dasgupta 1969: ii.13; Larson 1993). Caraka’s use of Sa ̄m.khya andVa i s ́es.ika concepts is of particular interest: his extensive treatment of the theoryand practice of formal argument (Ca.vi.8) led Dasgupta to argue that themedical literature preserved perhaps the earliest stratum of Nya ̄ya thought. Less attention has been paid to Caraka’s version of the Yoga system (Ca.s ́a ̄.1esp. 137 ff.). Comba (2001) has shown that this chapter of Caraka’s work citesseveral passages from the Vais ́es.ikasu ̄tra. For Caraka, yoga and liberation (moks.a)are both states in which all sensations (vedana ̄) cease. In liberation, however, thiscessation is complete, while in yoga it is a goal. Quoting from the Vais ́es.ikasu ̄tras,Caraka asserts that yoga arises when the mind is concentrated steadily on theself; in that state, the contact between the self and the sense organs, etc., ceasesto exist, and several special powers arise. These are the standard eight siddhis ofyoga and Indian magic. Caraka then focuses on the concept of mindfulness orremembering, in particular the memory of reality (tattvasmr.ti), which both givesrise to a serious and soteriologically oriented lifestyle, and is produced by it. Thefull emergence of this special kind of memory (smr.ti) results in freedom fromsuffering. At this point, Caraka presents his own unique eightfold path of yoga,which is quite different from the classical scheme of Patañjali. The path is aimedat developing memory, and consists of the following eight elements: under-standing causes, forms (nimittaru ̄pagrahan.a), similarity (sa ̄dr.s ́ya), and difference(viparyaya); adherence to purity (sattva ̄nubandha), practice (abhya ̄sa), the yoga ofknowledge (jña ̄nayoga), and repeated listening (punah.s ́ruta). The mindfulness ofreality (tattvasmr.ti) produced by these eight practices leads to the identificationof the self with brahman.The Wider Influence of A ̄yurvedaClassical Indian medicine, a ̄yurveda, has exerted a long and pervasive influenceon other indigenous traditions in India, as well as on those of foreign countries.The fields of dharmas ́a ̄stra, arthas ́a ̄stra, tantra, alchemy, ka ̄mas ́a ̄stra, and othersciences were all influenced by a ̄yurveda in varying degrees. A ̄yurvedic treatises,such as the toxicological tract which is embedded in Sus ́ruta’s Kalpastha ̄na,became famous in Arabic translations from a very early period (Wujastyk 2001:123). The Tibetan translation movement from the eighth century onwardsresulted in many a ̄yurvedic works becoming an integral part of the Tibetanhealing tradition, and a ̄yuvedic manuscripts recovered from the oasis towns ofthe Taklamakan desert testify to its importance in Central Asia. The Persian Kita ̄bFirdaws al-h.ikmaby ‘Alı ̄ ibn-Sahl at.-T.abarı ̄, written in 850, included a detailed406dominik wujastyk"},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"account of a ̄yurveda, based on already existing Persian and Arabic transla-tions of the a ̄yurvedic classics. The great Muslim physician Muh.ammadibn-Zakariyya ̄” ar-Ra ̄zı ̄ (d. 925) frequently cited Arabic translations of Caraka(Ullmann 1978: 19). Later, through the works of da Orta (1563), van Rheede(1678–1703) and Linnaeus (1748, 1753), a ̄yurvedic traditions exerted animportant and lasting influence on the development of botanical science inEurope (Grove 1995: ch. 2). During the twentieth century, a ̄yurveda has beensupported at the national level in post-independence India, with hospitals, col-leges, clinics, and a thriving a ̄yurvedic pharmaceutical industry. And a processof globalization – similar to that which took place earlier with yoga – has begunto occur also with a ̄yurveda. As might be expected, a ̄yurveda “in diaspora” is changing and adapting, as it moves from its premodern role as the only learned medicine available to the population to a new position as one part of aportfolio of alternative and complementary therapies offered alongside modernbiomedicine.Notes1Abbreviations used in this chapter: Ah. =As.t.a ̄n.gahr.dayasam.hita ̄(Kum.t.e et al. 1995),Ca.=Carakasam.hita ̄(A ̄ca ̄rya 1981), Su. =Sus ́rutasam.hita ̄(A ̄ca ̄rya 1992).

A cautionary episode in the Maha ̄bha ̄rata illus-trates the point. Bhı ̄s.ma tells Yudhis.t.hira that there is nothing more worthhaving than wisdom. Wisdom, he declares, is the greatest good, the refuge of allliving things, the ultimate acquisition, and is considered by the virtuous to beheaven itself (12.173.2). But then, in case his point should be misunderstood,he recounts the story of Indra appearing in the form of a jackal (12.173.45–8):I used to be scholarly [says Indra], a reasoner, a scorner of the Veda. I was point-lessly fond of critical inquiry and the science of argument. I used to make decla-rations on the basis of logic; in assemblies, speaking with reasons, I harangued thebrahmins and was rude during the Vedic recitations. I was an unbeliever, scepti-cal about everything, and though stupid, I thought myself wise. The status of ajackal that I have obtained is the result, Ka ̄s ́yapa, of my misdeeds.The terms in which Indra deprecates himself are important ones, for they gradually came to be associated with the practice of philosophy itself in India.Indra was a “reasoner” (haituka), he was addicted to the study of critical inquiry(a ̄nvı ̄ks.iki) and to the science of argument (tarka-vidya ̄). That free thinking ofthis sort was seen as embodying a danger to the stability of orthodox brahmini-cal learning is only too clear. In another epic narrative, the Ra ̄ma ̄yan.a, Ra ̄maadvises his brother Bharata to steer well clear of such people (2.94.32–33):You must not associate with those “worldly” (loka ̄yata) brahmins, dear brother.Their only skill is in bringing misfortune; they are fools who think themselves wise.In spite of the pre-eminent treatises on right conduct (dharma), these ignorantpeople derive their ideas from critical inquiry, and make declarations without anypoint."},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"These “reasoners” represent a challenge and a threat to the existing tradition.They will assent to the deliverances of reason whether or not it agrees with thescriptures and the authorities on what is considered to be proper conduct. The lawmaker Manu therefore advises that a brahmin who has adopted thescience of reasoning, treating with contempt the twin authorities on properconduct (the scriptures and the texts on right conduct or dharma), should as an“unbeliever” and a “scorner of the Vedas” be driven from the company of thevirtuous.1It is not that in the great epics reason as such is condemned, but only its capri-cious use. The “reasoners” are condemned for lacking any goal other than theuse of reason itself; they believe in nothing and are skeptical of everything. Theyuse reason to criticize the scriptures, but have no doctrines of their own. Reason,the message seems to be, is misapplied when it is used in a purely negative,destructive way. In other words, the proper use of reason should be to support,and not to undermine, one’s beliefs, goals, and values, The objection to the rea-soners, as they are represented in the epics, is that for them the use of reasonhas become an end in itself. It is goalless, capricious, ungrounded.The idea that the use of reason must be purposeful or goal-directed is takenup in the Treatise on Gains (Arthas ́a ̄stra), a famous book on government, politics,and economics which dates from around 300 bc. Its author is Kaut.ilya, supposedto have been the chief minister in the court of Candragupta, a Mauryan rulerwho came to power at about the time of Alexander’s death. The period follow-ing Alexander’s campaign in India was in fact a time of intimate and extendedcontact between India and Greece. The ancient Greek chronicler Megasthenesfrequently visited the court of Candragupta and in his Indicahe presented to theGreeks a vivid account of the Indian society of those times. Fragments of thislost work quoted by later writers reveal Megasthenes to have been greatlyimpressed by similarities between Greek and Indian ideas, especially about space, time, and the soul.2He is also said to have carried messages betweenCandragupta’s son Bindusa ̄ra, the father of As ́oka, and Antiochus I. Bindusa ̄raindeed asked Antiochus to send him Greek wine, raisins, and a Sophist to teachhim how to argue. Antiochus replied by sending the wine and raisins, butregretted that it was not considered good form among the Greeks to trade inSophists!Kaut.ilya’s purpose in writing the Treatise on Gains was to educate future kingsin the necessary skills required for a successful and prosperous rule. He statesthat there are four branches of learning in which a young prince should be trained: the religious canon composed of the three Vedas; the sciences ofmaterial gain, primarily trade and agro-economics; the science of politicaladministration and government; and finally a ̄nvı ̄ks.ikı ̄, the discipline of criticalinquiry, of which sa ̄m.khya,yoga, and loka ̄yata are listed as the principal divisions. Significantly, he rejects explicitly the claim of Manu and others thatthe study of critical reasoning is tied exclusively to a religious study of the selfand its liberation (a ̄tmavidya ̄). Critical inquiry is an autonomous discipline(1.2.11):412jonardon ganeri"},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"Investigating by means of reasons, good and evil in the Vedic religion, profit andloss in the field of trade and agriculture, and prudent and imprudent policy in political administration, as well as their relative strengths and weaknesses, thestudy of critical inquiry (a ̄nvı ̄ks.ikı ̄) confers benefit on people, keeps their mindssteady in adversity and in prosperity, and produces adeptness of understanding,speech and action.He reiterates an old couplet (1.2.12):The study of critical inquiry is always thought of as a lampfor all branches ofknowledge, a meansin all activities, and a supportfor all religious and social duty.Shortly after the rediscovery and publication of the Treatise on Gains in 1909,Hermann Jacobi wrote an article arguing that Kaut.ilya had to all extents distinguished and defined “philosophy” in India.3Kaut.ilya’s separation of astudy of “critical inquiry” (a ̄nvı ̄ks.ikı ̄) from theological studies was enough, heconjectured, to justify the identification of “critical inquiry” with philosophy.This rather important conjecture has been strongly disputed, on the groundsthat critical inquiry as described by Kaut.ilya consists simply in the art of inves-tigating by reasons, and this is something that is practiced in allbranches oflearning. Paul Hacker4makes the point that this “critical inquiry” is not neces-sarily an independent system of thought, but is sometimes rather a method. Inthe same vein, it has very plausibly been conjectured5that the early referencestosa ̄m.khya,yoga, and loka ̄yata are not to well-defined schools of philosophicalspeculation, but reflect instead a methodological division. Thus sa ̄m.khyalabelsthe methods of inquiry that rest on the intellectual enumeration of basic prin-ciples,yoga the methods of spiritual practice, and loka ̄yata the methods ofworldly or empirical investigation.We can agree with these conjectures without having to identify philosophyas a discipline with the having or inventing of a system of thought. Philosophyis circumscribed by adherence to a certain methodology and body of problems.Broadly, it is the a priori analysis of the interconnections and distinctionsbetween groups of concepts to do with the nature of value, thought, existence,and meaning. It is indeed possible to hear in Kaut.ilya’s remark about “investi-gating...good and evil in the Vedic religion, profit and loss in the field of tradeand agriculture, and prudent and imprudent policy in political administration”a suggestion that a reasoned investigation is an inquiry into the nature of thedistinction between good and evil, the proper goals of political institutions, andso on. But the intended domain of application for critical inquiry seems to bemuch wider than that. It encompasses any situation in which one sets aboutachieving one’s aims in a reasoned way. There is a reasoned way to go aboutmaking a profit, a reasoned way to rule a country. The study of what such reasoning consists in is one thing, the philosophicalinvestigation of the nature of profit or rule quite another. So a ̄nvı ̄ks.ikı ̄in Kaut.ilya’s sense is a study of thegeneric concept of rationality, as that concept features in questions about howrationally to think, how rationally to act, and how rationally to speak.hinduism and the proper work of reason413"},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"Kaut.ilya’s conception of rationality is goal-oriented and instrumental. Theinterest is in the reasoned way to achieve some goal, whatever that goal may be.The use of reason does not tell us for which goals one should strive, but only howrationally to strive for them. The Arthas ́a ̄stra is, after all, a manual of instructionfor princes. The discipline Kaut.ilya calls that of critical inquiry is the one whichtrains the prince in the way for him to fulfill his projects, having once decidedwhat those projects are to be. The other sciences, of trade and agriculture, ofpolicy-making and government, train him in the skills of choosing one objectiverather than another. A person is rational when he uses rational methods to reachhis aims. (Kaut.ilya wanted kings to become philosophers, not as Plato thatphilosophers be made kings.) It is not enough to be rational that the aim be insome sense a “worthy” one, for even worthy goals can be striven for by irrationalmeans.Bertrand Russell6said that “reason” “signifies the choice of the right meansto an end that you wish to achieve. It has nothing to do with the choice of ends.”The epic horror of the reasoner concerned the aimlessuse of reason, usingreason capriciously or solely to subvert the goals of others. Kaut.ilya’s defencemakes rationality instrumental and therefore goal-directed. It follows, however,that a tyrant can be just as rational as a ruler who is beneficent, an atheist asrational as a believer. If rationality is instrumental, then to act rationally is notthe same as to act well. Followers of reason alone still face the charge ofimmorality, hereticism, and untruth.1.2 Rationality in the Nya ̄ yasu ̄traGautama Aks.apa ̄da’s Nya ̄yasu ̄tra, the redaction of which took place in the firstor second century ad, deals with such themes as the procedures for properly con-ducting debates, the nature of good argument, and the analysis of perception,inference, and testimony in so far as they are sources of knowledge. There is a detailed account of the causal structure of the mind and the nature of its operation. Certain metaphysical questions are addressed, notably the reality ofwholes, atoms, and universals. At the beginning of his commentary on thisremarkable work, Va ̄tsya ̄yana Paks.ilasva ̄min (ca. ad400) wonders what it isthat makes the Nya ̄ya system distinctive. He answers as follows:Nya ̄ ya is the examination of things with the help of methods of knowing(prama ̄n.a). It is an inference supported by observation and authority. This is calleda “critical proof ” (anvı ̄ks.a ̄). A “critical proof ” is the proof of things desired, sup-ported by observation and authority. The discipline of critical inquiry is the onewhich pertains to it, and is also called the science of nya ̄ya or the writings on nya ̄ya.But an inference that contradicts observation and authority is only a bogus-nya ̄ya.7Va ̄tsya ̄yana agrees with Kaut.ilya that the study of critical inquiry is one of thefour branches of study, but he insists that it has its own procedures or method-414jonardon ganeri"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"ology. He claims that if critical inquiry did not have its own procedures then itwould “merely be a study of the soul’s progress, like an Upanis.ad.” This is a ratherimportant remark. Reasoned inquiry and scriptural studies are now claimed tohave the same eventual goal or purpose; where they differ is in method. Thatmarks a departure from Kaut.ilya’s purely instrumental conception of rational-ity, in which the use of reason could equally well serve any end. For Va ̄tsya ̄yanawants to claim that there can be rational goals, as well as rational means, and so to distance the Nya ̄ya system from the free-thinkers in the epics.Let us first see that Va ̄tsya ̄yana shares the epic horror ofaimlessreason.Reason, he says, can be used in one of three ways. One may employ it in a goodand proper way (va ̄da), as one does when one’s goal is to ascertain the truth ofthe matter. One may employ it in a bad or improper way (jalpa), as when one’sgoal is to defend one’s position at all costs, using any intellectual tricks one canthink of. Finally, one might employ reason in a negative and destructive way(vitan.d.a ̄). Here one has no goal other than to undermine one’s opponent. Peoplewho use reason in this way are very like the sceptics and unbelievers of the epics,and Va ̄tsya ̄yana disapproves. He claims indeed that to use reason in this way isvirtually self-defeating:Avaita ̄n.d.ikais one who employs destructive criticism. If when questioned aboutthe purpose [of so doing], he says “this is my thesis” or “this is my conclusion,” hesurrenders his status as a vaita ̄n.d.ika.If he says that he has a purpose, to makeknown the defects of the opponent, this too is the same. For if he says that thereis one who makes things known or one who knows, or that there is a thing bywhich things are made known or a thing made known, then he surrenders hisstatus as a vaita ̄n.d.ika.8Vitan.d.a ̄is the skeptic’s use of reason. Va ̄tsya ̄yana’s point is that someone whopresents an argument against a thesis has at least that refutation as their goal, and so commits himself to the machinery of critical examination. But avaita ̄n.d.ikawho accepts this gives up his claim to use reason aimlessly, withoutcommitment. So the aimless use of reason is not just pernicious, it is self-defeating!The salient point here is that reason must have a purpose, and the questionis what that purpose should be. Va ̄tsya ̄yana’s answer is clever. He argues that agoal is a rational one if it is the rational means to some further goal. And heclaims that whatever one’s eventual goal is, the rational way to achieve it isthrough the acquisition of knowledge – knowledge about one’s goal and how itmight be achieved. So the acquisition of knowledge is always a rational goal.Indeed it is the rational goal par excellence, for knowledge is instrumental in therational pursuit of any other goal:9Since there is success in one’s activities when the awareness of one’s object is pro-duced by an accredited method of knowing (prama ̄n.a), the method of knowing isconnected with the object. Without a method of knowing, there is no awarenesshinduism and the proper work of reason415"},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"of the object. Without an awareness of the object, there is no success in one’s activ-ities. But the knower, having grasped the object in thought by some suitablemethod, either desires it or wants to avoid it. His “activity” is the effort promptedby his desire for or aversion of it. “Success” is the coming together of that activitywith its reward. Desiring the object, or wanting to avoid it, one either makes aneffort to obtain it or else to avoid it. One’s “object” is the contentment [one feels]and the cause of that contentment, or the disdain and the cause of that disdain.Let me take a simple example. Suppose my goal is to acquire a piece of silver. Tosucceed, I need to know where silver might be found, and how to recognize it; Ineed to be in a position to know, of some object, that it is made of silver. I needto know other things as well, such as that I have some way of acquiring the silveronce identified. So the reasoned way for me to go about acquiring a piece of silveris to seek to acquire knowledge of the identifying traits, whereabouts, and meansof acquiring of silver objects. The acquisition of such knowledge becomes itselfa goal, subsidiary to my principal aim of acquiring silver.In the translation, I have tried to retain an ambiguity in the Sanskrit wordartha, in rendering it as “object.” It can mean both one’s goal, such as acquiringsilver, and also the thing which that goal concerns, the silver itself. It is the targetof one’s endeavor, both as the piece of silver, and equally well as the acquiringof that silver. Va ̄tsya ̄yana suggests that it can also denote the satisfaction onefeels on achieving one’s goal, or the irritation of not doing so. Later on,10hestresses that, in virtue of the connection that exists between knowledge of theobject and success or failure in one’s goals concerning it, one should employsome suitable method of knowing if one wants to succeed. The theory of ratio-nality in this way depends on a theory of the proper means of acquiring truebeliefs.Kaut.ilya said that the study of critical inquiry is the study of the notion of“investigating with reasons.” Va ̄tsya ̄yana tells us what a “reason” (hetu) is. It isa method of acquiring knowledge, a prama ̄n.a. For a “reasoned” inquiry is onewhich is based on the acquisition of knowledge. The early Nya ̄ya writers lookclosely at the characteristic method that constitutes a rational inquiry. Theopening verse in the Nya ̄vasu ̄tra is a list of 16 items which, according to itsauthor, comprise the subject matter of the Nya ̄ya system. The first two items arethe various methods of knowing and the domain of knowables. They constitutethe Nya ̄ya epistemology and metaphysics. The next seven are the theoreticalcomponents in the process of critical inquiry: doubt, purpose, observationaldata, doctrinal bases, extrapolative demonstration, suppositional reasoning, anda final decision. The final seven are terms of art in the theory of debate.Nya ̄yasu ̄tra 1.1.1:The highest goal in life is reached through knowledge about the nature of:(a)knowables, methods of knowing,(b)doubt, purpose, observational data, doctrinal bases, the parts of a demon-stration, suppositional reasoning, final decision,416jonardon ganeri"},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"(c)truth-directed debate, victory-directed debate, destructive debate, sophisticalrejoinders, tricks, false reasons, defeat situations.A properly conducted inquiry, adds Va ̄tsya ̄yana, is that process by which wemove from an initial uncertainty about the nature of the thing or concept underinvestigation, to an ascertainment of its properties. The inquiry is permitted todraw upon such data as are incontrovertible or accepted by both parties in thedispute, and it proceeds by adducing evidence or reasons in support of one sideor the other. The first element here is the existence of a doubt (sam.s ́aya) whichinitiates the investigation. A doubt is said to be a mental state whose content isof the form “Does this object have a certain specified property or not?” Typicaldoubts discussed in the Nya ̄yasu ̄tra (is the soul eternal or non-eternal?, is a wholeobject identical with the sum of its parts?) tend to be philosophical conjecturesor hypotheses, but the method applies just as well to the resolution of empiricalquestions.An inquiry must have a purpose. The assumption is that any form of rationalbehavior must have some motivating purpose, the point for which one wishes to resolve the doubt. The inquiry can appeal to shared background doctrinalprinciples and empirical data. Here, by “empirical data,” what is meant are theobservational facts to which all parties can appeal. The background principlesare called “doctrinal bases” or “proved doctrines,” and might also include a cate-gory ofa priori truths or principles. Gautama actually mentions several kinds ofdoctrinal base. In particular, there are those which everyone must accept, forexample that objects of knowledge are established via means of knowing. Otherdoctrinal principles are in the form of conditionals, where both parties agree onthe truth of the conditional, but dispute the truth of the antecedent. Also men-tioned are assumptions which are made merely for the sake of argument. Oneor both sides might grant some principle, simply to facilitate the inquiry. In anycase, having initiated an inquiry for some purpose, and taken into considerationboth empirical evidence and such doctrinal or a priori considerations, the inves-tigation concludes with the decision, which is a resolution of the initiatingdoubt.Similar characterizations of the general structure of problem-solving areoffered in the contemporary literature on formal heuristics.11There a problemis defined as one in which the following features are specified and delimited: agoal– a criterion of judging outcomes; an initial state, consisting of a situationand the resources available for the solution; a set ofadmissible operations fortransforming states; constraints on states and operations; and an outcome. Itwould seem that the Nya ̄ya account fits rather nicely this characterization of thestructure of a problem-solving set-up. The doubt is an initial state of uncertainty,the purpose is the goal, the admissible operations are the sanctioned methods ofreasoning by extrapolative demonstration (section 1.6) and supposition (tarka),the constraints are the observational data and doctrinal bases to which allparties agree, and the outcome is the final decision. A critical inquiry, then, is aformal heuristic for problem-solving.hinduism and the proper work of reason417"},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"Nya ̄yasu ̄tra1.1.1 makes a further demand on the type of proof procedureadmissible in a critical inquiry. It insists that the inquirer be able explicitly to setout for others the piece of knowledge so acquired as the conclusion of a preciselyformulated demonstration (avayava). In its general schematic form, a demon-stration scheme has five steps:i)Preliminary statement of the thesis to be proved.ii)Citation of a reason.iii)Invoking an example.iv)Application to the present case.v)Assertion with confidence of the conclusion.For example: (i) There is a fire on the mountain. (ii) Because there is smoke there.(iii) As in the kitchen. (iv) The mountain is the same. (v) Therefore, there is firethere. I will look in detail at the structure of such argument schemes in a latersection (1.7). I am interested here in what the demand for demonstration tellsus about the nature of critical inquiry, an investigation “with reasons.” The earlyNya ̄ya writers want to explicate the notion of a reason. Since the rational wayto achieve one’s goals is by acquiring knowledge about its constituents, it mightseem that a reason is any method of acquiring knowledge (prama ̄n.a). However,the insistence now is that the rational inquirer be able to set out his reasoningin an explicit and canonical way. And a “reason” is the premise or evidence (hetu)in such a suitably formulated argument. Va ̄tsya ̄yana explains that the variousmeans of acquiring knowledge have a subsidiary role here. They enter theaccount as the means by which each step in the explicitly formulated demon-stration is proven:12The means of acquiring knowledge reside in those [demonstration steps]. The pre-liminary statement of the thesis is an item of testimony (a ̄gama). The reason (hetu)is an item of inference. The example is an item of perception. The application is anitem of “analogical comparison.” The final conclusion exhibits the possibility of allthese coming together in a single thesis. Such is a nya ̄ya par excellence. With thehelp of this alone can truth-directed, victory-directed and destructive debate tech-niques be employed, never otherwise. Fixing the truth depends on this. The stepsin the demonstration are sentences, and as such are included among the objectsof knowledge; but they are mentioned separately for the above reasons.Va ̄tsya ̄yana’s systematizing idea is that the three strands out of which the Nya ̄yasystem is formed – theory of knowledge, study of critical inquiry and art ofdebate – can be brought together into a single discipline. In doing so, he intro-duces a new condition on a rational inquiry: that it be capable of being madepublic through verbal demonstration. A rational inquiry is, to be sure, a proce-dure for reaching one’s goal which exploits knowledge about that goal and themost effective way to achieve it. But it must also be knowledge of the sort thatcan be displayed. It must be knowledge that is backed up by reasons of the sortthat are potentially capable of convincing others, something that can stand upto the scrutiny of a debate.418jonardon ganeri"},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"There is a conflict here between two accounts of the source of rational norms.On the one hand, to proceed rationally is to proceed by acquiring knowledge ofan appropriate sort. But on the other hand, to proceed rationally is publicly toadduce reasons and arguments for the knowledge one purports to have. The firstis an epistemic conception of norms, while the second grounds norms in thepublic conventions of the debating hall. The early Naiya ̄yikas, drawing on theirroots in the systematization of debating theory, insist that rationality must be apublic affair, an explicit demonstration in the five-step format, but they try tomerge this idea with another, that the norms of reason are the norms of war-ranted belief. The tension between these two concepts of reason will manifestitself again as we examine in later sections other paradigms of rationality in theNya ̄yasu ̄tra.1.3 Rationality and the Ends of LifeThe early Naiya ̄yikas have linked the pursuit of rational inquiry with the finalends of life: Nya ̄yasu ̄tra 1.1.1 states that it is by understanding the nature of rea-soned inquiry, epistemology and debating theory that one attains the “highestgoal” (nih.s ́reyasa).Nya ̄yasu ̄tra 1.1.2 amplifies the point, adducing an exactsequence of causal relations between knowledge and liberation (apavarga).The final aim of life is the permanent elimination ofduh.kha. Duh.kha is a dif-ficult term in Indian soteriology. Its meaning is: suffering, pain, discontent, frus-tration, displeasure. What then is the source of all this discontent? One sourcehas already been mentioned by Va ̄tsya ̄yana in the passage quoted before – thefrustration of one’s plans. Obtaining one’s goals is an end in itself, but so too isthe pleasure or contentment that success instils. It is not just that in obtainingthe piece of silver, I gain as well the pleasures that go with possessing a valuablething. It is also that fulfilling one’s projects is a form of satisfaction in its ownright. Va ̄tsya ̄yana stresses, however, that the final aim of life must involve a separation from pleasures as well as pains. For pleasure is invariably attended by pain, as if it were honey mixed with poison! So the ultimate aim in life consists in the elimination of any attachment to the success or failure of one’sprojects, or the rewards or discomforts such projects bring.Can a life of reason help one achieve this? Kaut.ilya perhaps thought so, for hesaid that pursuing one’s goals by means of rational inquiry helps to keep the mindsteady in both adversity and prosperity. The Naiya ̄yika thinks so too (NS 1.1.2):Liberation results from the removal of the next member when the immediately pre-ceding member is removed in the sequence of: wrong belief, bad qualities, actions,birth, suffering.This is the pan-Indian karma theory, a causal theory of moral retribution. Thereis a direct causal link between the moral quality of one’s present actions and one’sfuture contentment or frustration in this birth or another (a commentator13hinduism and the proper work of reason419"},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"points out that by “actions” here what is meant is righteous and unrighteousconduct, since it is such conduct that is the cause of birth and rebirth). Weobserved earlier that with a purely instrumental conception of rationality, it isno more rational to do good than to do evil. To be rational is simply to set aboutone’s aims in a reasoned way. In the context of a causal theory of moral retri-bution, however, it is rational to strive to do good. For given that one’s final aimin life is to avoid frustration (presumably including the frustration of one’s futureplans), one has a reason to behave well now and do good. At least, one has areason as long as one knows that there is a direct causal link of the sort described.After all, acquiring knowledge about the sources of frustration and suffering isthe rational way to accomplish one’s aim of eliminating them!The rational life is a life best suited to eliminate at least one source of suffer-ing, namely the frustration of having one’s plans fail. So if one’s ultimate end inlife is to avoid suffering, and the main source of suffering is due to the frustra-tion of one’s plans, one has a reason to live a rational life. Moreover since, whenone examines the general causes of suffering and frustration, what one finds isthat future frustration is caused by past immoral deeds, one has a reason to haveonly moral deeds as one’s goal. Someone who believes in the karma theory ofmoral retribution has a reason to strive to do good and not to do evil. One finallink is needed to complete the picture. It is that bad or immoral deeds are theresult of false beliefs. Once one knows this, one has a reason to strive for onlytrue beliefs. For if one has only true beliefs, then one cannot do wrong, cannotincur the moral cost of future frustration, and so will succeed in life’s ultimategoal of eliminating such frustrations. One has, therefore, a reason to strive tominimize false beliefs, and so to study the sources of true belief and knowledge.And, in so far as a study of the Nya ̄ya system is the best method of achievingone’s highest goals, one should study it through repeated reflection, discussionwith others and by engaging in friendly debates (NS 4.2.47–9).This then is the reason why the study of epistemology and critical inquiry, inshort of the Nya ̄ya philosophy, is instrumental in achieving one’s final aims.There is an elegant explanatory closure here. One might not be inclined to agreewith every step in the explanatory chain. While it is plausible that there is adependency between the degree of success or failure of one’s plans and theextent of falsity in one’s beliefs, it is less easy to see that the dependency is medi-ated by the moral value of one’s actions. Even if one were tempted to omit thatlink, or regard the tie between rationality and moral behaviour differently, theexplanatory scheme affords a marvelous account of the relationship betweenthe study of philosophy and the quest for life’s final ends.1.4 PerceptionThe Buddhist asserts that perception of objects is itself a rational activity. Onedoes not, properly speaking, perceive the object at all, but only patterns of color,420jonardon ganeri"},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"sound, touch, smell, and taste. From their sequence in time and arrangement inspace, one infers the presence of an object of one kind or another. Reason hereis a mental faculty of construction, synthesis, and superimposition. It bringsorder to the array of sensory data. The early Naiya ̄yika, however, has tied reasonto explicit demonstration and proof. He has no place for the idea of reason as aninner mental faculty of sensory integration. Since there is no logical connectionbetween the capacity to see an object and the capacity to describe it, one is ledinstead to the idea that objects enter directly into the content of perceptual expe-rience. The Naiya ̄yika rightly worries that if reason has a role in the construc-tion or synthesis of the objectsof perception, then realism about those objects isthreatened. However, he allows reason to have a role in the organization of thetotality of one’s perceptions. Kalidas Bhattacharya accurately, if enigmatically,assessed the idea when he said that “thought as judgement, according to Nya ̄ya,is either the perception of a passive unity of different data in substantive-adjective relation, or, going beyond perception, conscious management of datathrough actual use of language.”14I begin with the Nya ̄yasu ̄tradefinition Va ̄tsya ̄yana would later classify thesu ̄tras into three kinds: “naming” su ̄tras, which introduce a topic or concept foranalysis; “defining” su ̄tras, which offer a definition of the concept in question;and “critical” su ̄tras, which examine and evaluate the adequacy of the proposeddefinition. A definition is a property co-extensive with the concept to be defined.A definition is faulty if it is either too wide or too narrow – showing that it hasneither of these faults is the purpose of the “critical” su ̄tras. The Nya ̄ya methodhere is not very different from the technique of finding necessary and sufficientconditions. Notice however that it does not tell us what the essence of the thingdefined is, but rather gives us a syndrome, a criterion for distinguishing betweenit and all other kinds of thing.Nya ̄yasu ̄tra 1.1.4 is a “defining” su ̄tra. It is the definition of perception:Perception is an awareness which, produced from the connection between sense-organ and object, is nonverbal, non-errant, and determinate in nature.A perception is an awareness that stands in a certain special relation to its object.The attempt is to define that relation in purely noncognitive terms. If the attemptis successful, then perception is a physical anchor between the subject and theexternal world. It is not itself cognitive, but rather supplies the raw material forcognition and so for reason.What constraints are there on the physical relation that obtains between aperceiver’s perceptions and the object perceived? A first constraint is just that therelation be physical, so that it is not explicated in terms of semantic relationssuch as that of denotation. This is what is meant by the assertion that percep-tion is “nonverbal.” Second, the relation has to have the right extension: it needsto hold between perceptions and the sorts of object one is normally regarded ascapable of perceiving. Uddyotakara (ca. ad500) has a clear discussion of thispoint.15He notes that the relation must be capable of obtaining between the hinduism and the proper work of reason421"},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"perceiver’s perceptions and objects which are both nearby and far away; it mustbe a relation capable of obstruction by solid, opaque objects; it must connect theperceiver not only with the objects themselves, but also with their perceptibleproperties such as color and shape, as well as with the perceptible properties ofthose properties; it must connect the perceiver not only with the front surface ofa whole object, but with the object as a whole (for one sees the table and not justits surface); and finally, he asserts that it connects the perceiver with the absencesof things, for apparently one can say that one seesthe absence, and not merelythat one fails to see.It is hardly surprising that the Naiya ̄yikas find themselves unable to describea single physical relation which obtains in all (and only) these circumstances,but perhaps they do not need to. For if it is part of the concept of perception onlythat it is grounded in a physical relation with a certain extension, then an ade-quate physicalist theory of perception needs only to specify what the extensionof the underlying physical relation is. The discovery of the way that relation isrealized in actual human perception might be a task assigned to the psycholo-gist of perception, not to the philosopher.The real interest in the Nya ̄yasu ̄traattempt to give a physical description ofperception lies in the remaining two conditions. The point is that, no matter howwell one succeeds in describing the underlying physical connection, there willbe cases where that connection obtains, but the resulting awareness is not genuinely perceptual. Va ̄tsya ̄yana points to cases of perceptual illusion and per-ceptual confusion:During the summer the flickering rays of the sun intermingled with the heat radiating from the surface of the earth come in contact with the eyes of a personat a distance. Due to this sense–object contact, there arises an awareness as ofwater. Such an awareness might be (mis-)taken as perceptual; hence the clause“non-errant.” An errant one is of that wherein it is not. A non-errant one is of thatwherein it is – this is a perception.Perceiving with the eyes an object at a distance, a person cannot decide whetherit is smoke or dust. Such an indecisive awareness resulting from sense–objectcontact might be (mis-)taken as perceptual; hence the clause “determinate innature.”These ambiguous passages led to a “vortex of controversy” (Matilal 1995: 310)and eventually to a sophisticated theory of content. It is alleged that a personwitnessing a mirage does not see the refracted sun’s rays, even if in the right sortof physical connection with them. Neither does he see water, for there is noneto be seen. Someone witnessing a mirage does not seeanything, but only seemsto see water. And a person who witnesses a ball of dust in the distance does notseethe dust if he is uncertain whether it is dust or smoke. An object is not seenif it is not seen distinctly.In both cases there is a natural temptation to say that the person does seesomething, but does not understand or know what it is that they see, or that theymisconstrue what it is that they see, or that their perceptual appearance is 422jonardon ganeri"},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"nonveridical. One sees the refracted rays of light, but mistakes them to be water;one sees the ball of dust, but fails to determinate it as such. To say this would beto concede that the existence of an appropriate physical connection is sufficientfor object perception. The difficulty with such a move is that, although it doesindeed extrude rationality from the perceptual, it does it so completely that theperceptual cannot be a basis for rational thought. The “objects” of perceptionare merely things in which one stands in a certain special physical relation, ona par with other objects one comes into physical contact with (e.g. by standingon or picking up). However, if perception is to be a foundation for rationality,there must be a way in which it is understood as making objects available inthought, as placing them within the ken of the observer.Might we analyze the two additional clauses in terms of belief ? If a personwitnessing a mirage does not see the refracted rays of the sun, perhaps it isbecause he falsely believes them to be water. Similarly, one can perhaps say thatthe person looking at the ball of dust does not see it because he does not believethat it is dust (does not know whether it is dust or not). We might then think oftaking the additional clauses as defining the perception of an object in terms ofa physical connection, together with the absence of a belief that it is somethingit is not, and the absence of doubt or disbelief that it is something that it is. Thatis:S’s perception is of object xiff:1)S’s perception stands in a relation R with x.2)R is physical (nonverbal).3)for all F, if S believes that FxthenFx.4)for all F, ifFxthen S does not disbelieve that Fx.There are two objections to such a proposal. First, clauses (3) and (4) are muchtoo strong. It is clearly possible to perceive an object and at the same time havefalse beliefs about it. I might, for example, perceive the table and yet believe thatit is made of space-filling infinitely divisible stuff. Second, since belief impliesrationality, the definition of perception in terms of belief is contrary to theattempt to extrude reason from perception.The proper implication of the Nya ̄yasu ̄tra definition is that the perception ofobjects is moduloa property. When I see an object (my desk, for instance) I do notsimply see it, but I see it as a table. Here, the clause “as a table” is to be read as anadverbial modifier of the seeing relation R. I stand in a “table-seeing” relation tothe object. The relativization of the seeing relation by a property allows a recon-struction of Va ̄tsya ̄yana’s cases. The person who witnesses a mirage stands in a“water-seeing” relation to the refracted rays. The errancy lies in the fact that theyare seeing the refracted rays as water, when in fact the rays are not. And theperson who witnesses a ball of dust, but fails to distinguish it as dust or smokestands neither in a dust-seeing relation to the dust-ball, nor in a smoke-seeingrelation, but equivocates. The correct way to read the definition then is:hinduism and the proper work of reason423"},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":"S’s perception is of object xiff:4)for some F, S sees xas an F, whereS sees xas an Fiff:1)S’s perception stands in a relation R with x.2)R is physical (nonverbal).3)Fx.Cause (4) excludes the case of the ball of dust, for since there is no definite wayby which the person sees the dust, the person does not see any object. It isnecessary for object perception that the object is seen in some definite way.Clause (3) excludes the case of the mirage, for the person attempts to see the raysmodulo water but the rays are not water. Notice here that “non-errancy” signi-fies simply an absence of warping, a lack of discord between the perception andits object, and is not explicated in terms of a correspondence between the objectand a perceptual content. We should think of this absence of warping as a pro-perty of the perceptual relation, much as transparency is a property of clearglass. Both are characterized in terms of the lack of a distortion or corruptionof what is seen, and not in terms of representational correspondence. The passivity of perception is preserved; perception remains free from interpretationand construction.It follows from the definition that if one perceives an object, and one does soby seeing it moduloits having a certain property, then it does indeed have thatproperty. This is so even though one does not see thatthe object has the prop-erty. Perceiving xasFdoes not imply believing that xisF, but it does imply thatone would be justified were one to believe that xisF. Perception is an evidentialsupport for reason, without itself being reasoned (an idea echoed in RoderickChisholm’s critical cognitivism16). Later Nya ̄ya writers draw a distinctionbetween perception that is “with imagination” and perception is “without imagi-nation.” Bimal Matilal explains the philosophical use here of the term “imagi-nation” or vikalpaas standing “for anything that, let us say, the mind adds to, orrecognises in, the ‘given.’ ”17In the Nya ̄ya theory the object perceived (x) andalso the mode under which it is perceived (F) constitute the perceptual given. It is the work of the “imagination” to bring them together into a propositionaljudgment (xisF).Buddhist objections to the Nya ̄ya definition focus on instances where percep-tion does seem to imply belief and inference. There is the case of Uddyotakara’srather remarkable claim that we perceive absences. I am looking for a pot. I lookin the kitchen and see no pot. Uddyotakara says: I see the kitchen as qualified byabsence-of-pot and thereby see the absence. The Buddhist Dharmakı ̄rti objectsthat this is really a piece of reasoning, an inference from nonobservation. Theinference runs thus. None of the objects which I perceive in the kitchen is a pot.If there were a pot in the kitchen, I would see it, for my perceptual faculties areworking normally and all other ceteris paribus conditions for perception are met.Therefore, there is no pot in the kitchen. Dharmakı ̄rti’s point is well taken, but424jonardon ganeri"},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"it does not constitute a refutation of the theory. We may simply give up thestrange claim that absences can be perceived.Nya ̄yasu ̄tra 2.1.31 rehearses an argument, apparently again due to Buddhists, which if sound would constitute a refutation. The argument is thatour ordinary perceptual claims are disguised inferences. I cannot see the wholetable from any one place. When I say that I see the table, what I mean is that Iinfer that there is a whole table on the basis that I have seen a part (its frontsurface). We never see wholes, but infer their existence from our more immedi-ate perceptions. If the argument is that all perception is inferential, thenGautama’s counter in Nya ̄yasu ̄tra 2.1.32, that we see at least front surfaces, isconclusive. If the argument is that all perception of wholes is inferential, theNya ̄ya reply is that the whole is present in each of its parts. So we can perceivea whole just as we can perceive a property. One says that one sees the colour orshape of the flower in virtue of seeing the flower; so too one sees the whole invirtue of seeing a part.What is at stake is the amount of work done in perception by reason. The Buddhist presses the Naiya ̄yika on the point that there is, in perception, anextrapolation and interpretation of what is immediately given. Allowing pro-perties to enter the (nonconceptual) content of perceptual experience as ad-verbial modifiers offers a way of avoiding the unpalatable consequence that theperception of a whole is an inference. Attention is drawn to two kinds of prop-erties of wholes: those that are properties of the whole without being a propertyof any its parts, and those that are properties of the whole only because they areproperties of every part.The second sort “saturate” the object, in rather thesame way that sesame oil saturates the sesame seed. The property being-a-tableor being-a-cow, on the other hand, applies to the whole, but not to any of itsparts. It follows that seeing modulo such a property is seeing the whole and notits parts. This Nya ̄ya rejoinder to the Buddhist criticism depends on one’s beingable to regard the property being-a-cow as an entirely objective feature of theperceived situation, not as itself a mere concept or mental construct. It is for thisreason that, in the war for hegemony between the Buddhist and Nya ̄ya phi-losophical views, some of the severest battles were those over the reality ofuniversals and wholes.181.5 Mind, Attention, and the SoulIs the mind rational? Is it conscious? That depends on what we mean by “mind.”The Naiya ̄yika, as generally for thinkers in classical India, sees in the mind(manas) something distinct from the soul (a ̄tman). It is the soul alone which isthe seat of reason, quathinker, perceiver, enjoyer of pleasures and sufferer ofpains. The mind is a mere instrument of the soul. It is that by which the soulcontrols the senses. The mind is given a second function: it is also that by whichthe soul perceives its own mental states. So the mind is both an inner sense andhinduism and the proper work of reason425"},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"the controller of the outer senses, but all the while entirely directed by the soul.The mind is mechanical.An enduring metaphor for the senses, due at least to Pras ́astapa ̄da, is aswindows onto the world. In a room with a window on every wall, each one rep-resents a possibility of sensory contact with some aspect of the world. But onlya possibility: in order to see out, one has to direct one’s attention to one windowrather than another. In the case of the senses, this role is assigned to the mind.It is a faculty of attention, that by which the soul directs its gaze through onesense rather than another. Another metaphor is helpful here. Think of the sensesas converging railway tracks, meeting at a point and becoming a single track.The mind is the set of points at the junction. It is that by which the controller(the soul, the signalman) channels its attention in one direction rather thananother.A perception arises in the soul when there is a causal chain: from object tosense, from sense to mind and from mind to soul.19Uddyotakara observes thatif this role of the mind in perception seems to have been forgotten in theNya ̄yasu ̄tra definition of perception, it is because a mind–soul link is not some-thingspecialto perception, while a mind–sense link is impliedby the mention ofthe sense–object connection.20The existence of the mind as an intersensory switching device follows froman alleged deficiency in the powers of the conscious soul. This is that the soulcan attend to at most one thing at a time. There is a strict sequence in the tem-poral order of thought. If the senses are functioning simultaneously, but one canentertain no more than one thought at a time, then one must have withinoneself a capacity to choose between the deliverances of the senses (NS 1.1.16,NS 3.2.56). In reply to the obvious objection that we do seem to be able to attendto more than one thing at once, Va ̄tsya ̄yana claims that this is an error producedby our inability to discriminate events which happen in very quick succession.He cites (NS 3.2.58) the illusion of a circling firebrand, appearing as if it were acontinuous hoop, and more interestingly, the way one hears a sentence as awhole even though the letters and words are uttered in sequence.This account of the mind is smooth. But a worry now presents itself. If theconscious soul fails to notice the distinctness in a sequence of perceptions, it seems to follow that the mind after all has a certain autonomy in operation.For if the soul is not quick enough to follow the mind’s switchings from one perception to the next, how can it be controlling them?21And yet there is noquestion of assigning consciousness (caitanya) to the mind. Nya ̄yasu ̄tra 3.2.38is explicit:It [consciousness] is not a property of the mind, for reasons already given, andbecause of its being ruled by another, and because [there would then follow an]acquiring of the benefits of actions not performed.The “reason already given” is simply the definition itself of the soul, as the exclu-sive abode of thought, will, pleasure and pain (NS 1.1.10). The idea of “benefits426jonardon ganeri"},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"of actions not performed” is a reference to the karma theory of moral retribu-tion. If the soul and the mind were distinct consciousnesses, then the future contentments or frustrations of the soul would depend on the present deeds ofanother, the mind. This contradicts the fundamental principle of the karmatheory, that the benefits and costs of one’s present actions accrue to oneself andnot to someone else. Va ̄tsya ̄yana uses the same line of reasoning against the Buddhist reduction of a person to a “sum and series” of consciousness-moments(NS 3.2.39). If a person is a series of distinct consciousnesses, then the deeds ofone reach their fruition in the contentments and frustrations of another, aninjustice incompatible with the hypothesis ofkarma.The more important assertion is that the mind is “ruled by another.” It doesnot act independently, but only as directed by the conscious soul. It thereforecannot itself choose which sense to connect with. How then can the soul beunaware of its operation? A solution to the puzzle begins to emerge when weremember that the mind has another function, along with that of intersensoryswitch. It is also an inner sense, the means by which the soul perceives its ownmental states. Va ̄tsya ̄yana:22Memory, inference, testimony, doubt, intuition, dreams, suppositional argument,and perception of pleasure and pain are the proof of mind.One conclusion we can draw from this is that the soul is not immediately awareof its own thoughts, for it requires an inner sense to perceive them. Thoughts,just like external events, can appear and disappear unperceived. So the mere factthat a thought occurs does not imply that it is taken notice of in consciousness.Once the point has been made that the mere occurrence of a thought is not suf-ficient for its being noticed, we see that the switching function of the mind neednot determine which thoughts are noticed, but need only ensure that thoughtsoccur in succession. We can think of the mind as scanning the senses, constantlyswitching from one to the next. Its movement so conceived will be very swift, butentirely automatic and mechanical. Perceptions from all the senses occurrapidly, but sequentially in the soul.To attend to something then, is not to direct the mind quaintersensory switchtowards one rather than another sense faculty, but rather to direct it quainnersense to some occurrent perception. The rapid movement of the mind need notbe something of which the soul is aware. There is still a problem. If a perceptioncomes before consciousness only if one chooses to direct the mind towards it,how can it be that one’s attention is sometimes drawn by the perception itself ?Standing on a thorn or a chip of stone will draw the attention even of a personwhose mind is fastened on some other thing (NBh. under NS 3.2.32). The worryis that I will not notice the pain in my foot unless I direct my mind to attend tothe deliverances of my tactile sense, but that there need be no motivation for meto do this in advance of noticing the pain. Unless it occurs to me to checkwhether my foot has been injured, I will not notice the pain! Even this, however,can be squared with a mechanistic conception of the mind. Let us say simplyhinduism and the proper work of reason427"},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"that some perceptions are so intense as to force the mind in their direction, notbecause it chooses to direct itself towards them, but simply because it is drivento do so by the intensity of the perception. A conception of the mind as entirelymechanical in operation has room to allow that this could happen. The “move-ment” of the mind is an automated scanning of the senses, potentially divertedby the occurrence of intense perceptions and by the controlling influence of thesoul. The mind is not itself a rational agent, and it is only in a relatively weaksense that the Indian soul–mind division is what one would now call a “dividedmind” hypothesis.23What now is the place of reason in perception? The function of the soul is tointegrate the content of distinct perceptions across times and between sensorymodalities (NB 3.1.1). It has the power to identify the object of some past per-ception and an object currently being perceived. The identity “this is the sameas that” is not given in perception, but discovered or “imagined” by the soul. Thesame is true across sensory modalities at a given time. Physical objects are per-ceived only by sight and touch, but the identification of an object held in one’shand with an object currently being seen with one’s eyes is the work of reasonand not of perception. Such identifications require one to be able to assume apoint of view which spans times and crosses sensory modalities. Rationality thenhas a reconstitutive role in aligning our perceptions with each other, so that theycome to represent a world of temporally extended and modality-independentobjects.24The possibility of transtemporal and transmodal identification of objects issaid by the Nya ̄ya to be the best argument for the existence of the soul as dis-tinct from the mind or the senses, and as the final refutation of the Buddhistanalysis of the person as a mere continuum of discrete consciousnesses. For howis a reidentification of an object possible by one who exists only for a moment?Only a single consciousness spanning time can “simultaneously” witness thesame object at two different times, and recognize it as time same. Only a singleconsciousness spanning sense modalities can “simultaneously” witness a singleobject through two modalities, and recognize it as the same. The Buddhist assertsthat a momentary consciousness can compare a current perception with acurrent memory (produced by the past perception of an earlier momentary con-sciousness), and so there is no need for there to be a single subject of the currentand past perceptions. The Naiya ̄yika reply is that there is a logicaldifferencebetween, on the one hand, judging that an object seen now is the same as anobject seen some time ago, and, on the other, keeping track of an object over a period of time. It is perhaps like the difference between discovering that twodifferent names refer to the same thing, and using a single name twice.25The ability to turn fleeting modality-specific perceptions into thoughts aboutenduring physical objects is a concealed art of the soul. It is rational because itadmits of a standard of correctness. Interperceptual identifications can be rightor wrong – the degree to which one can make them accurately, and the extentwhich one can do so for perceptions more distant from one another in time orappearance, is the index of a rational capacity.428jonardon ganeri"},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"1.6 Rationality and ExtrapolationThe discovery of identities among the contents of one’s perceptions is a corefunction of reason. There is another. This is the capacity to extrapolate fromwhat one has perceived to what one has not. That extrapolation is a key conceptin the early history of Indian logic is clear from some of the examples Va ̄tsya ̄yanagives under NS 1.1.5.26Seeing a rising cloud, one infers that it will rain. An inter-esting variant is: seeing the ants carrying their eggs, one infers that it will rain.Seeing a full and swiftly flowing river, one infers that it has been raining. Seeinga cloud of smoke, one infers the existence of an unseen fire. Hearing a cry, oneinfers that a peacock is nearby. Seeing the moon at one place at one time and atanother place at another time, one infers that it is moving (even though onecannotseeit move). The medical theorist Caraka27has some other examples:inferring impregnation from pregnancy; inferring the future appearance of fruitfrom the presence of seeds. In the ancient Buddhist logical text, The Essence ofMethod,28we also find: inferring from a child’s special mark that this person isthat child, now grown up; inferring from the salty taste of one drop of sea waterthat the whole sea is salty. The Ts’ing-mu29(a commentary on Na ̄ga ̄rjuna’s MiddleStanzas) has a similar example: inferring that all the rice is cooked on tasting one grain. And the Vais ́es.ikasu ̄tra mentions another sort of extrapolation – theinference of an entire cow from the perception only of its horns.30Extrapolation from the seen to the unseen can take place in any of the threedimensions of time – past, present, and future. Our interest is in the Indiantheory of rationality, and for this we want to look at answers given to the ques-tion: on what basis, if any, ought the extrapolation be made? For while dice-throwing, guesswork, and divination are ways of extrapolating, they are notrational ones. Extrapolation, like critical investigation, must be done “on thebasis of reasons,” and a theory of such “reasons” is a theory of that in virtue ofwhich an extrapolation is warranted. So we can discover Indian theories of ratio-nality in their explanations of why the extrapolations in the examples mentionedabove are warranted. Rationality now is the search for extrapolative license.While Va ̄tsya ̄yana says only that there should be a connectionbetween whatis seen and what is inferred,31many of the early writers have a definite interestin prediction and scientific explanation, and assume that extrapolation is war-ranted when underwritten by a causal relation. On the other hand, it is clearlyrecognized too that not all warranted extrapolation is causal. The Vais ́es.ikasu ̄tralists, in addition, the relations of contact, inherence, coinherence in a third, andbeing contrary (VS 3.1.8, 9.18), while the early Sa ̄m.khya s.as.t.itantra has an over-lapping list of seven.32Take the inference from a drop of salty sea water to theconclusion that the whole sea is salty. This is not an inference based on anycausal relation between the drop of sea water and the sea as a whole; rather, therelation between them is mereological. One would say that it is an inference fromsampling a “typical” member of a group. This is a very common and useful formof reasoning (witness the example of checking that all the rice is cooked byhinduism and the proper work of reason429"},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"tasting a single grain). It is not formally valid, but it is a pervasive and powerfulspecies of informal reasoning. We will see in the next section that it acquires particular significance in the context of a debate.There is also an intriguing example from Va ̄tsya ̄yana I have not yet men-tioned. This is the inference of the “residual” by elimination.33Wonderingwhether sound is a substance, a quality, or an event, and finding reasons to denythat it is a substance or an event, one draws the conclusion that it is a quality.What is interesting is that the early writers are well aware that not all warrantedinference can be reduced to the causal model. An adequate theory of inferencehas to find a description of the extrapolation-warranting relation at a level moregeneral than that of the causal.The difficulty in finding adequately general bases for extrapolative inferenceencouraged a skepticism about their existence. In one form, scepticism about thepossibility of rational extrapolation is just the claim that there is no adequateextrapolative basis. It is the view allegedly of the Loka ̄yata “materialist,” andmost notably of the sceptic Jayara ̄s ́i (ca. ad600). An early version of the skeptic’sargument is recorded in the Nya ̄yastu ̄tra (NS 2.1.37):[Objection:] Inference is not a means of knowing, because there may be errancyarising from embankment, damage and similarity.Gautama is referring to the examples of the swollen river, the ants, and thepeacock. His point is that the observed facts admit of different explanations: theswollen river might have been caused by a dam or embankment further down-stream, the ants might be carrying their eggs because their nest has beendamaged, and the peacock’s cry might have been made by a human or animalimpersonator. There are alternative causal explanations for each perceivedevent. This is a standard skeptical move. The sceptic introduces an alternativepossible explanation (that our experiences are all dreams or produced by an evilgenius, that the world was created five minutes ago with all its fossil records) andthen claims that the existence of such an alternative explanation shows that oneis not entitled to assume that the common-sense expanation is the correct one.Gautama’s reply is interesting (NS 2.1.38):No. Because it is a different thing from a [mere] partial case, fear, and [mere]similarity.The compact response is that there is an observable difference between a riverwhich is swollen because of upstream rain and one which is swollen because ofa downstream blockage, a difference between the orderly procession of antswhen it is about to rain and their fearful scurrying when the nest is disturbed,and a difference between a genuine peacock’s cry and that of an impersonator.The implication of Gautama’s reply for the rationality of extrapolation seemsto be this. An extrapolation from the seen thing to the unseen thing is rationalwhen there is a relation of some appropriate (as yet unspecified) sort between430jonardon ganeri"},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"the two. The relation does not obtain between the unseen thing and somethingwhich merely resembles the seen thing. The rational extrapolator, therefore,must have the capacity to discriminate between the thing in question and otherthings which merely resemble it, but do not stand in the appropriate relation tothe unseen thing. Only someone who can tell the difference between a flood riverand a dammed river is entitled to infer from swelling to rain; only someone whocan tell the difference between marching ants and frightened ants is entitled to infer from marching to rain; and only someone who can tell the differencebetween a peacock’s cry and a human impersonator is entitled to draw the infer-ence from cry to peacock.The skeptic will reply, of course, that he can always find an alternative expla-nation for the occurrence of a perceived event, no matter how finely attuned theperceiver’s discriminating powers. Even the best expert can be fooled by a goodenough forgery. But the question is whether it is rational to concern oneself withsuch extreme skeptical possibilities. The Naiya ̄yika proposes a common-sensemaxim for extrapolative reasoning: do not extrapolate beyond the level of yourcompetence. The skeptic has a different maxim: do not extrapolate if there is anypossibility of error. Since human beings have finite discriminatory capacities,there is always the possibility of error, and so the skeptic’s maxim implies that itis never rational to extrapolate. (Jayara ̄s ́i34claims even that there is no rationalextrapolation from the rising to the setting of the sun!) To reach the skepticalconclusion, however, the skeptic has further to prove that his maxim ofextrapolation is the rational one to adopt, while the common-sense Nya ̄yamaxim is not. And that is precisely what Gautama is here denying.1.7 Rationality and DebateH. N. Randle observed a long time ago that “the Naiya ̄yika was from first to lastata ̄rkika, a disputant.”35More recently, B. K. Matilal has called debate the “pre-ferred form of rationality” in classical India.36There is a good deal of truth inthese observations. A sophisticated theory of rationality evolved in the arenasof debate. Kaut.ilya observed that rationality is about the best means to an end,and the end of the debater is to win. But what counts as winning a debate? Ifthe debate is the victory-at-any-cost sort, and a debater wins when his opponentis lost for words or confused or hesitant, then the best and so most rational wayto proceed would be to employ such tricks as play on the opponent’s weaknesses:speaking very quickly or using convoluted examples or referring to doctrines ofwhich one suspects one’s opponent is ignorant. In the other sort of debate, thetruth-directed sort, “winning” is a matter of persuading one’s opponent, andalso an impartial audience, that one’s thesis is true, and the rational debatermust find some other methods. Nothing is more persuasive than an argumentbacked up by well-chosen examples and illustrations. And so, when theNaiya ̄yikas came to codify the form of rational debating demonstration, the hinduism and the proper work of reason431"},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"citation of examples was given at least as much prominence as the citation ofreasons. When the Nya ̄ya theory of inference was “rediscovered” by Henry Cole-brooke (he broke the news at a meeting of the Royal Asiatic Society in Londonin 1824), the Indologists of the day in their excitement failed to pay due atten-tion to this fact, and were led to some rather extraordinary speculations aboutthe origins of syllogistic theory. The Sanskritist Görres apparently arrived at theview that Alexander, having been in conversation with the logicians of Indiaduring his campaigns, sent some of their treatises back home to his tutor whoworked them up into a system! Equally remarkable was Niebuhr’s claim that theIndians must have derived their theory from the Indianized Greeks of Bactria (itis a view Vidhyabhusana was to repeat much later on). If there is a lesson here,it is that a little comparative philosophy is a dangerous thing.The debating room is a theater for the art of persuasion. It is a metaphor forany situation in which one wants to persuade others of the correctness of one’spoint of view. It will include by extension both the mundane situation of per-suading one’s companion that something is about to happen, and persuading ascientific or academic community of the truth of one’s thesis. The model of ratio-nality which comes out of the theory of debate is public, explicit, demonstra-tional. The norms of public reason are those of mutual agreement.The proper way to formulate one’s position is in accordance with a “five-limbed” schema: tentative statement of the thesis to be proved; citation of areason; mention of an example; application of reason and example to the case in hand; final assertion of the thesis (NS 1.1.32). Suppose I want to per-suade my walking companion that it is about to rain. I might reason as fol-lows: “Look, it is going to rain. For see that large black cloud. Last time you saw a large black cloud like that one, what happened? Well, it’s the same now.It is definitely going to rain.” In order to be able to generalize the structure ofsuch patterns of reasoning, the Naiya ̄yikas make an important simplifyingassumption. They assume that the underlying pattern is one of property-substitution. The claim is that all such patterns exemplify the same canonicalform: Ta becauseRa. An objent (the paks.aor “site” of the inference) is inferredto have a property (the sa ̄dhya or “target”) on the grounds that it has some otherproperty (the hetuor reason). The first simplification, then, is to think of rea-soning as taking us from an object’s having one property to that same object’shaving another.The simplification scarcely seems justified. A cursory inspection of the casesmentioned at the beginning of the last section shows that only about half fit sucha pattern. The cases of the swollen river, the ants, the peacock’s cry, the fruit,and the salty sea do not seem to fit at all. Neither can we fit reasoning to theremainder by elimination. The canonical schema seems to fit the case of themoon, the pregnancy, and the child’s special mark, but it is only at a stretch thatone can force the case of smoke and fire into the pattern (an irony as this is ahackneyed example which all the logical texts quote). Bearing in mind the waysin which Indian logic was later to develop, one can be forgiven for feeling thatthis adoption of a property-substitution model at an early stage, while perhaps432jonardon ganeri"},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"a helpful and necessary simplification for the sake of initial progress, alsorestricted the study of other patterns of inferential reasoning. Only the Jainalogicians explicitly tried to develop a theory of extrapolation free from this restriction.What licences the inference from Ra toTa? The Nya ̄yasu ̄tra answer is given infive brief and controversial aphorisms (NS 1.1.34–8):A reason is that which proves what is to be proved by being like an example.Again, by being unalike.An example is an observed instance which, being like what is to be proved, possesses its property.Or else, being opposite, is opposite.The application is an assimilation to what is to be proved “this is thus” or “this isnot thus” depending on the example.Likeness and unlikeness are relative to properties. Something is “like” anotherthing if both possess a given property. They are unalike with respect to that prop-erty if they do not both share it. Now arguably the natural way to interpret thesesu ̄tras is as follows. Either the locus of the inference is like the example (in thatboth possess the reason property, R) and, since the example has the to-be-provedproperty, so does the locus. Or else the locus of the inference is unlike theexample (it possesses the reason property, but the example does not), and sincethe example does not have the to-be-proved property, the locus doeshave it. If welet “b” stand for the example, then we seem to have:ais likeRba is unlikeRbTb~Tb\\Ta\\TaThis formulation actually makes the inference a generalization of the inferencefrom sampling. The example is a typical member of the class of things havingthe reason property. And it has this other property, the to-be-inferred targetproperty. But the site of the inference is also a member of the class of thingshaving the reason property. So it too has the target property (the negative for-mulation is similar). This is a powerful form of reasoning, one which we engagein all the time. It is not formally valid, but it is a pervasive type of informal rea-soning. We employ it whenever we infer that an object has a property on thegrounds that it belongs to a type, the typical members of which have that prop-erty. Compare: this grain of rice is typical of the whole pan of rice, and it iscooked. So any other grain will be cooked as well. This drop of water is typicalof the entire sea, and it is salty. So this other drop must be salty as well.We said that in the debating model, rationality is subject to public norms ofcorrectness. In arguments of the kind being considered, public norms do indeedhave a role to play, for they determine whether the object adduced by the debaterhinduism and the proper work of reason433"},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"as an “example” is adequate. For something to be capable of playing the role ofexample, it must be generally and uncontroversially accepted as a member ofRand as a T. The debater must, when he chooses an example, be careful to selectone that will fit public criteria of acceptability. Warranted extrapolation, clearly,is context dependent and occurs, in particular, only when there is a backgroundof shared knowledge. For one grain of rice is an adequate exemplar of all onlyif it is commonly known that all the rice has been cooked in the same pan, atthe same temperature, and with the same amount of water. It is for this reasonthat the pattern of reasoning here is neither formally valid nor reducible to anAristotelian syllogism.37There is a strong pressure, nevertheless, to fit such arguments into a deductive-nomological model. These arguments, the thought goes, rest on anunderlying lawlike universal generalization – that all the members of kind RareTs. The argument is then enthymematic for a deductively valid one: Ra, all RareT\\Ta. The role of the example, it is alleged, would be to provide empiricalsupport for the universal rule, either by being something which is both RandT,or by being something which is neither RnorT. The pioneer indologist, Stanisl¢aw Schayer, had a different idea.38He read the step labeled “example” inthe five-step proof as an application of a logical rule, the one we would now call“universal instantiation.” This is the rule that permits one to infer from “(\"x)(RxÆTx)” to “(Ra ÆTa)”. And he read the step called “application” as the applica-tion of another logical rule, modus ponens. But he still sees the overall inferenceas a formally valid one whose validity is a consequence of the fact that there isa hidden premise “(\"x)(RxÆTx).”More light can be thrown on this point if we examine the early Nya ̄ya account of a pair of debating moves called the “likeness-based” rejoinder and“unlikeness-based” rejoinder. A sophistical rejoinder (ja ̄ti) is a debating tactic inwhich the opponent tries unsuccessfully to produce a counter-argument, anargument designed to prove the opposite thesis. It is sophistical because thecounter-argument is based on a false or superficial resemblance. Nya ̄yasu ̄tra5.1.2–3 state:When there is assimilation through likeness or unlikeness, the likeness-based andunlikeness-based rejoinders lead to the opposite property.[The reply is:] the proof [of the thesis] is just like the proof of a cow from cowhood.One debater, debating properly, tries to prove that a certain object has a certainproperty by pointing out that it is like another object which does have that prop-erty. (The black cloud overhead now is like the cloud we saw yesterday – bothare black. But that cloud caused it to rain, so this one will too.) The opponentnow tries to counter by pointing out that the object is also like an object whichdoes not have the property. (The black cloud overhead is like the white cloud wesaw the day before yesterday – both are clouds. But that cloud did not cause rain,so this one won’t either.)434jonardon ganeri"},{"pageNumber":442,"pageContent":"ais likeR1ba is likeR2cTb~Tc\\Ta\\~TaAs an argument, the rejoinder seems to follow the very same pattern as the orig-inal one, so why is it false? The existence of such rejoinders shows that mere like-ness is not sufficient for good argument. The likeness has to be of the right type.When is the likeness of the right type? The Nya ̄yasu ̄tra’s very cryptic commentis that the “right type” is the type displayed by the relationship between a cowand its genus cowhood. Va ̄tsya ̄yana, the commentator, is unclear and confusedon this point. He does, however, make one important observation:39If one proceeds to establish the required inferable property on the basis simply oflikeness or unlikeness then there will be lack of regularity (vyavastha ̄). Irregular-ity does not arise with respect to some special property. For something is a cowbecause of its likeness with another cow, which likeness is actually cowhood, notthe cow’s having dewlap, etc. It is because of cowhood that a cow is unlike a horse,etc., not because of a difference of particular qualities. This has been explained inthe section on the limbs of a demonstration. In a demonstration, each limb servesa single purpose because they are connected with the means of knowing. The irregularity rests only on a bogus reason.If the likeness must be of the right type, then the reason property, as determinerof the likeness relation, must also be of the right type. The object under investi-gation must be like objects which belong to a group, the typical members of which have the target property. Va ̄tsya ̄yana implies that if the property inquestion is a property shared by typical members of the class of cows, then thereason property must be the class-essence cowhood.In the last section, we saw that rational inference is linked with warrantedextrapolation, and we wondered what it was that made an extrapolation war-ranted. The problem we have here is similar. We are now asking for the condi-tions under which it is admissible to extrapolate a property from one object toanother. It appears to be admissible to extrapolate the property “rain-maker”from one black cloud to another black cloud, but not from a black cloud to a whitecloud. It appears to be admissible to extrapolate the property “has a dewlap” fromone cow to. another cow, but not from one four-legged animal (a cow) to another(a horse). There seems to be an order in the world of objects, a structure whichlicences the extrapolation of properties in some directions, but not others. Objectsare grouped together on the basis of their likenesses and unlikenesses to oneanother. The possibility of likeness-based and unlikeness-based rejoinders shows,however, there are many different ways of making these groupings, many dif-ferent metrics of likeness. So the problem is this – given some arbitrary propertywe wish to extrapolate from one object to another, how do we decide which suchmetric determines a standard for proper and warranted extrapolation? For anextrapolation may be warranted under one likeness relation, but not another. Sonot every inference of the standard pattern is permissible:hinduism and the proper work of reason435"},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"ais likeRbTb\\TaThe response given in the tradition to this problem is to impose further con-straints on the relation of likeness. Relevant or extrapolation-warranting like-ness consists in the sharing of a property at least as narrow in extension as theproperty to be extrapolated. The idea is clearly expressed and ably defended byDin.na ̄ga, and for that reason he is rightly thought of as one of India s finest logi-cians. I also think that the pre-Din.na ̄ga Naiya ̄yikas would not have developedthe theory of inference in the way they did unless they had some such idea intheir minds. But I do not believe we should be led by this to try to reinterpretwhat they said as an unequivocal expression of the idea. Matilal puts the matterwell when he says that “the conception of a universal connection is being hintedat on the analogy of a universal property.”40Thehintwas there, but it was forDin.na ̄ga to lend that hint articulation (and perhaps it is only at moments whena theory is being revised that a precise definition is needed). The important pointis this need not be read as the introduction of a new premise into the inferencepattern, but rathet as a condition on when an inference is admissible. The con-straint is of the form: it is valid to infer Ta fromTbifais likeRbwhen b, theexample, is relevantly like a(i.e. when the property it shares with ais narrowerin extension than the property being extrapolated). An inference rule is notanother premise in the inference, but rather that in virtue of which the infer-ence is valid or invalid. And the treatment of the early Nya ̄ya theory as a theoryof inference from sampling shows how the rule that there be a “universal con-nection” (vya ̄pti) of this kind between the properties is not an enthymematicpremise, but a genuine inference rule of an informal logic.Five sorts of bogus reason (hetva ̄bha ̄sa) are mentioned in Nya ̄yasu ̄tra 1.2.4:thewandering, the contradictory, the unproven, the counter-balanced,andtheuntimely.41Of special importance here is the one called the “wandering” (for theunproven” and the “counter-balance,” see section 1.9). This was interpreted bylater Naiya ̄yikas as meaning that the reason property deviates from the target,and so as a case in which the criterion enunciated in the above paragraph is vio-lated. If a faulty reason is one which is present somewhere the target propertyis not, then by contraposition, a proper reason is one which is not present some-where the target property is not, and so is at least as narrow in extension. TheNya ̄yasu ̄tra definition is, however, less than explicit, and Va ̄tsya ̄yana’s explica-tion of this most important su ̄tra is all over the place:The wandering is that which does not remain at only one end. (NS 1.2.5)An example is: sound is eternal because it is intangible. A pot is tangible and isseen to be non-eternal. Sound is not tangible in the same way. What then? It isintangible. One might say, therefore, that because it is intangible, sound is eternal.However, in this example tangibility and non-eternality are not grasped as stand-ing in a prover–proven relationship. For example, an atom is tangible and it is436jonardon ganeri"},{"pageNumber":444,"pageContent":"eternal. And when something like the soul is the example, then the reason, whichis taken to be “because of being intangible” in accordance with the su ̄tra “a reasonis that which proves what is to be proved by being like an example (1.1.34),” devi-ates from eternality. For a thought is intangible as well as non-eternal. So, as thereis deviation in both sorts of case, there is no prover–proven relationship as themark of a (proper) reason is absent. One end is eternality, one end non-eternality.So we understand “being at one end.” Opposite to that which is at one end is thatwhich does not remain at only one end, because it is a pervader (vya ̄paka) of bothends.Four inferences are compared. (1) A pot is non-eternal. Sound is unlike a pot –one is tangible, the other intangible. So sound is eternal. However, we also havethis. (2) An atom is eternal. Sound is unlike an atom – one is tangible, the otherintangible. So sound is non-eternal. Again, we have: (3) The soul is eternal.Sound is like the soul – both are intangible. So sound is eternal. But also: (4) Athought is non-eternal. Sound is like a thought – both are intangible. So soundis non-eternal. The implication is that what undermines the inference is the exis-tence of examples which do not fit, i.e. counter-examples. Another maxim ofextrapolation is in play: do not extrapolate if you know of any counter-examples(there is no implication that the extrapolator is obliged to look for counter-examples, however). A prover–proven relationship is one for which no counter-examples exist. What Va ̄tsya ̄yana lacks, however, is a clear grasp of what makessomething a counter-example. He does not see that only a thing which is intan-gible and non-eternal ought to be thought of as a counter-example to the infer-ence from intangibility to eternality. Something which is tangible and eternal(an atom) is nota counter-example. For the existence of tangible eternal thingsis not inconsistent with the rule underpinning the inference, that whatever is intangible is eternal It is the gaining of a clearer grasp of the notion of acounter-example that leads one to an understanding of the proper form ofthe prover–proven relationship. Again, Din.na ̄ga is extremely precise on thenature of counter-examples, and can take a lot of the credit, even if the essential point had been appreciated before him.My point has been that there are many ways to arrive rationally at belief,other than that of formal deduction. Informal argument schemes, such as theinference from sampling, are just as much ways of reaching beliefs that it is rational for someone to hold, and it is with this wider concept of rational beliefthat we make better sense of the early Nya ̄ya philosophical enterprise.1.8 Reason, Scripture, and TestimonyIs it rational to believe the testimony of others or the statements of the scriptures? Does the assumption that it is rational to believe what we hear or read require us to think of rationality in a new way? We have so far encounteredtwo epistemic models of rationality: the perceptual model, according to whichhinduism and the proper work of reason437"},{"pageNumber":445,"pageContent":"rationality provides norms for the temporal and cross-modal integration of per-ceptual experiences; and the extrapolative model, according to which rationalityprovides norms for the extrapolation from the perceived to the unperceived. TheNaiya ̄yika thinks that belief in the testimony of others is indeed rational, butthat neither the perceptual nor the extrapolative model of rationality canaccount for why this is so. Testimony is a sui generis source of rational belief (i.e.a prama ̄n.a).The Nya ̄ya theory of testimony is simple. Nya ̄yasu ̄ tra 1.1.7 states that testimony is the utterance of a “credible person” (a ̄pta). On this su ̄tra,Va ̄tsya ̄yanaadds the following important comment:A credible person is a speaker who has knowledge of the object and is motivatedby the desire to tell of the object as known. This definition of a credible person isequally applicable to the seer (rs.i). the noble (a ̄rya), and the outsider (mleccha).42The comment is important because it implies that the scriptures do not have anyspecial claim to our assent, but are to be believed for precisely the same reasonsas any other piece of testimony, namely because the transmitter is credible. Acredible person is one who is knowledgeable about the subject matter, and whohas a sincere desire to communicate that knowledge, and can come from anywalk of life or branch of society.43Va ̄tsya ̄yana elaborates the point while discussing the Nya ̄yasu ̄tra argument (NS 2.1.68) that the authority of the Vedais just like that of a medical treatise, in that it rests on the credibility of the communicator. He comments:To what is this authoritativeness due? It is due to the direct knowledge of what isprescribed, compassion for fellow beings, and the desire to communicate rightly.Credible communicators, having direct knowledge of what they prescribe, showcompassion for fellow beings, (advising) “this is to be avoided,” “this is a cause of pain,” or “this is to be attained” and “this is the means to its attainment.” For creatures who cannot themselves understand, there is no other way of knowingall this. . . Thus a credible communicator is a source of knowledge.44When a person speaks who is knowledgeable, well motivated, and caring, it isrational to believe what they say. The scriptures, as it happens, are transmittedto us by such persons, and so we are entitled to believe them and regard whatthey say as a valuable source of knowledge, especially about moral and soterio-logical matters we would not otherwise be informed of. It is rational to believethe scriptures in just the same way and to just the same extent as it is rationalto believe a medical text about medical matters, or any other experts about theirrespective field of competence.A dilemma threatens this account of testimonial rationality. Must we knowthat the speaker has the qualities of competence, sincerity, and compassion inorder to be entitled to believe her, or not? It can hardly be right to say that weare entitled to believe any utterance we hear, and just hope that its author iscompetent and sincere. That would be an epistemic charter for the gullible.45But438jonardon ganeri"},{"pageNumber":446,"pageContent":"if we have first to establish that the speaker is competent and sincere, then it seems that our grounds for believing are inferential, and the rationality implicated in testimony is nothing but a variety of extrapolative rationality. We reason, in effect, that the present utterance is relevantly similar to past utterances of the same speaker, which have been seen to be true. Someone who accepts this (David Hume is a notable case) is led to conclude that it is indeed rational to believe the utterances of a sincere and competent speaker, butthat no new model of rationality is involved.What saves the Nya ̄ya theory is the idea that one can “monitor” the competence and sincerity of the speaker without forming any beliefsabout hercompetence or sincerity. One might simply have an internal “lie-detector” subconsciously monitoring for signs of blushing, fidgeting, and so on. The exis-tence of such a mechanism makes the following counterfactual conditional true:if the speaker were lying, one would come to believe it. In the presence of a sub-doxastic faculty of this sort, one need not attempt to acquire knowledge aboutthe speaker’s credentials. For one’s readiness to assent to what is being said willbe overridden if she were to lie. Assent is made rational in a negative way, by theabsence of evidence that the speaker is deceitful, rather than by positive evidencethat she is sincere. it is rational in the same way that it is rational for one tobelieve that one has not just trodden on a nail. One need have no positive reasonfor so believing (a visual inspection of the foot, for example) for one knows that,if one had just trodden on a nail, one would have come to know about it. The“reasoning” is ab ignorantiam and not inductive.46While the worry about the reduction of testimony to inference is raised in theNya ̄yasu ̄tra (NS 2.1.49–51), this defence is not to be found there. It emerges inthe later idea that a precondition for testimony is the “absence of knowledge ofunfitness” and not the “knowledge of fitness,” Va ̄tsya ̄yana says only that testi-mony depends on the speaker’s credibility and that “inference is not like this.”471.9 Reason’s Checks and BalancesI began this examination of rationality in the early Nya ̄ya with a description ofthe disreputable “reasoners” mentioned and criticized in the epics. The ill-reputewas on the grounds that their use of reason was unmotivated, groundless,unconstrained. The Naiya ̄yika is very careful to avoid this charge. The very termnya ̄ya, which Va ̄tsya ̄yana identified with reasoned inquiry itself, is contrastedwith another, nya ̄ya ̄bha ̄sa– a pseudo-inquiry. A pseudo-inquiry is one which,although-otherwise in accord with the rules governing proper reasoning (settingout the demonstration in a five-limbed format and with a proper reason prop-erty), contradicts observation and authority (see section 1.2). The same point ismade time and again. A properly conducted debate, one which is friendly andtruth-directed, is one which proceeds with the help of the methods of know-ledge-acquisition, employs the five-limbed format, and is not in contradictionhinduism and the proper work of reason439"},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"with, any doctrinal base (NS 1.2.1). A reason property which proves a thesiscontradictory to a doctrinal base is a mere bogus reason (NS 1.2.6). Reason inNya ̄ya has had its wings clipped. It can override neither observation nor author-itative doctrine!Descartes observed that our perceptions can sometimes contradict oneanother, and that when they do it is the role of reason to adjudicate. A towermight look round from a distance, but square closer up. A star and a distant lampboth look like specks of light, but one is vastly larger than the other. It is reason(belief and inference) that tells us that the star is larger than the lamp, eventhough they both look the same size. It is reason that allows us to decide whetherthe tower is really square or round. How, then, can one deny that reason some-times overrides perception? However, there are cases where perception overridesreason. Va ̄tsya ̄yana tries to find a case where a reasoned argument meets all thecriteria as laid down in the theory of inference, but whose conclusion has to berejected because it goes against perception. His example is: fire is not hot, becauseit is a creation, like a pot. Fires and pots are alike in that they are both productsof human effort (let us restrict the extension of “fire” to those produced byhumans). A pot, however, is a thing made of clay and so is not hot (materialthings are composed out of the four material elements, earth, water, fire, andair, and only those containing elemental fire are hot). So fire too is not hot! Theinference goes through even if we insist on a universal connection betweenreason and target. For it is indeed true that, among everything seen, createdthings are not hot. The point is that the inference extrapolates from the seen tothe unseen, and fire’s heat therefore belongs here with the unseen. The thermalproperties of fire, as the matter under investigation, are, as it were, sub judice.Every created thing ever encountered (excluding fire) has been found to be cold.So, extrapolating fire too as a created thing must be cold. Uddyotakara says thatthe inference is baffled by a perception of fire.The conflict here is between a prediction based on an inductive generalizationand an actual observation. In general, one faces a choice whenever one has bothan inference to the truth of some conclusion and strong evidence that the con-clusion is false. One can either reject the evidence for the falsity of the conclu-sion, or else reject one of the premises in the inference. The examples ofDescartes are cases where the first option is the correct one to choose. The evi-dence of the senses is defeated in one case by its own internal inconsistency andin the other by a generalization with enormous empirical support (that thingslook smaller when they are further away). But the example of Va ̄tsya ̄yana is acase where the second option is the correct one. In the face of incontrovertibleobservation, one must reject the similarity metric on the basis of which theextrapolation was made.When is it rational to reject the premise, when the conclusion? Is this not aquestion for reason itself to decide, and when it decides in favor of the conclu-sion (i.e. of perception) does it not therefore decide to override itself ? It is to avoidthe apparent absurdity of such a result that the Nya ̄ya insist on there being twodifferent models or faculties of reason: reason as the rational extrapolator, and440jonardon ganeri"},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"reason as the rational integrator of mental contents (perceptual and inferential).Integrative reason strikes a balance between perception and extrapolation, pre-ferring one or the other according to its own standards. What is true of the rela-tion between perception and inference is true too of the relation betweentestimony and inference, and true also of the relation between perception andtestimony. What is the norm on integration? What principle does it follow indeciding who to override? Maximizing consistency is the obvious answer, butthere is scope for weighting. The Nya ̄ya, it would seem, wants to weight testi-mony (and especially scriptural testimony) more heavily than anything else, andto weight observation more heavily than extrapolation. The pure reasoner of theepics would maximize the weight given to inference – no doctrine is unrevisable,no scripture sacred – or else, like the materialist, to observation. Such an anti-dogmatism may have led him to be banished from the company of the virtuous,but for us a question still remains. If there is a choice of weightings, which oneis the rational choice? On what principle does one choose? The search for reasonsgoes on. Unfortunately there isn’t sufficient space here to discuss how the laterNaiya ̄yikas brought this search for reasons to a close.Can reason really override itself ? As we have seen (section 1.7), five sorts ofbogus reason are mentioned in Nya ̄yasu ̄tra 1.2.4. In two of them, the unprovenand the counter-balanced, reason acts as its own regulator. These are important,for they are favourite weapons of the sceptic. The situation called “counter-balanced” is one in which, in order to resolve the point at issue, the debateradduces a reason which might equally well prove the point either way. Thereason meets all the criteria for warranted extrapolation, and would have beenentirely adequate in settling the matter, were it not for the possibility of anequally acceptable and adequate extrapolation to the opposite conclusion.Va ̄tsya ̄yana’s example is: sound is non-eternal because we do not apprehend insound the properties of eternal things, just like the pot, etc. The objection to thisotherwise admissible extrapolation is that it is reversible. For we can equally wellargue as follows: sound is eternal because we do not apprehend in sound theproperties of non-eternal things, just like the sky, etc. This too, on its own, wouldhave been an admissible extrapolation. (A simpler, if not entirely suitable,example would be: sound is eternal because it is eternal; and: sound is non-eternal because it is non-eternal.) In the absence of any ground for preferringone of these over the other, the most reasonable thing to do is to accept neither.Behind this bogus reason is another maxim of extrapolation: when faced withequal, but opposite bases for extrapolation between which you cannot choose,do not extrapolate. When reasons are balanced against each other, one is driveninstead towards the skeptic’s ataraxia.The other bogus reason of interest to us here is the one called “unproven,” ormore literally, “same as the thesis” (sa ̄dhyasama). The reason is one which hasnot itself been established, and in that sense is in the same state as the thesis tobe proved. Va ̄tsya ̄yana’s intriguing example is: a shadow is a substance becauseit moves. We have again an otherwise admissible extrapolation, but one thatwould be a false move in a debate. The problem is that the movement of shadowshinduism and the proper work of reason441"},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":"is not itself an established fact: it is neither a shared doctrine nor an indisputableobservation. For one needs to know whether shadows are seen to move like men,or whether what takes place is a succession of perceptions of dimly lit things pro-duced by the obstruction of the light by a moving cover. Extrapolation proceedsfrom the seen to the unseen or more generally, from the proven to the unproven.The underlying maxim on extrapolation is therefore: only extrapolate from whatyou have already established. The fault of being “the same as the thesis” is a violation of this maxim.The Ma ̄dhyamika sceptic Na ̄ga ̄rjuna uses this fault to devastating effect. Heargues that any reason adduced to refute the skeptical thesis will suffer the faultof being the same as the thesis. For if the skeptical thesis is that nothing can beknown, then to refute it is to prove that something can be known. But if it is notyet established that anything can be known, one can adduce no known or estab-lished fact to prove it. So any putative reason one adduces to prove that some-thing can be known will be the “same as the thesis” in being as yet unproven.The two propositions, “A proves B only if A is proven in advance of B” and “B=something is proven” in combination entail that A has to be somethingwhich is proven in advance of anything being proven, and this entails that thereis no such A. The skeptic’s thesis is indefeasible!Such is the account of reason as it was conceived in early India. The conceptis a shifting, not to say shifty, one, an interplay of different themes. The collec-tion of ideas presented here was supposed to describe the way people actually doreason and explain why they are justified in doing so. It is a common-sensetheory of common sense. In the subsequent chapters [ofPhilosophy in ClassicalIndia, 2001, the source from which this chapter is extracted], I look at attackson this account from several directions. The Ma ̄dhyamika skeptic’s claim thatreason is self-defeating has already been mentioned. It is self-defeating because,if true, it is provable that nothing is provable (chapter 2). The Jainas are dia-metrically opposed: reason, they say, is over-complete: everything is provable(chapter 5). And Din.na ̄ga, a founder-member of Yoga ̄ca ̄ra-Vijña ̄nava ̄da Buddhism, is neither a skeptic nor a syncretist, but a unificationistabout reason.What he rejects is the idea that there is a plurality in the concept of rationality(rationality quaintegrator, quaextrapolator, and quarecipient of testimony).Such a unification of reason, it turns out, necessitates a radical departure fromnaiveté (chapter 4). At the end of the book, I return to Nya ̄ya, and see how in the later period, responding to the many and varied assaults on the concept ofrationality embedded in common sense, it revitalized its defense of the common-sense account.Further ReadingTextsGautama ca. ad150,Nyayasu ̄tra(NS).Va ̄ tsya ̄ yana ad450,Nya ̄yabha ̄s.ya(NBh).442jonardon ganeri"},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":"Rationality, philosophical method (1.1–3)Arindam Chakrabarti, “Rationality in Indian Philosophy,” in Eliot Deutsch and RonBontekoe, eds., A Companion to World Philosophies (Oxford: Blackwell Publishers,1997), pp. 259–78.Wilhelm Halbfass, “Dar s ́ana, A ̄nv ı ̄ks.ikı ̄, Philosophy,” in his India and Europe: An Essay inUnderstanding(Albany: State University of New York Press, 1988), pp. 263–86.Bimal Krishna Matilal, “On the Concept of Philosophy in India,” in Philosophy,Cultureand Religion: Collected Essays(Delhi: Oxford University Press, 2001).Bimal Krishna Matilal, Perception: An Essay on Classical Indian Theories of Knowledge(Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1986), ch. 3.C.

First, can we identify a mode of discoursewhich can justly be called “Hindu theology”? Second, if we can, is it worthwhileto do so? In this introductory section I consider both questions.1In general, theology, philosophy, religious literature, and a wider range ofvalue-oriented cultural studies resist neat division from one another. Both theintersections and overlaps are of value, and usually one need not fuss over fixedseparations. In particular, the relationships and differences between philosophyand theology are rich and important, and it is difficult to distinguish themwithout caricaturing one or the other as if to postulate a philosophy devoid ofspiritual values, or a theology bereft of intellectual credibility. Both are theoreti-cal discourses which edge into more practical and moral concerns, or indeedderive from such concerns. Both theology and philosophy prize the cultivationof insight and the achievement of wisdom through disciplined practice; in turn,both quests, once properly defined, can be broadened again in relation to a yetwider range of popular resources in mythology, narrative, poetry, ritual practice,imagery, etc., all of which can flourish in numerous forms which resist neatdefinition according to particular academic terminologies. When these rich pos-sibilities are recognized, we are still left with the question: what merits the title“theology,” or, indeed, which schools of Hindu thought are not “theological”?The project of identifying theology as distinct from other religious or intel-lectual discourses involves challenges which for the most part are not peculiarto the Indian context. To understand the presuppositions of a search for “Hindu"},{"pageNumber":455,"pageContent":"theology,” it is helpful first of all to back up and recall some aspects of the religious and cultural situation in the West, where “theology” evolved as a usefulterm, and not always a term of approbation. In the pre-Christian Greek contexttheology was a lesser discourse, a reflective narrative about gods, and akin tomythological discourse. As such, it did not measure up to the newer, higher standards marked by “philosophy.”But thereafter the Christian tradition rehabilitated “theology” and used theterm to mark a superior mode of human reasoning which, infused with divinelight, was able to inquire deeply into the mystery of God and into matters of faithrelated to God. Rooted in gracious divine revelation, theology was nonethelessalso careful reasoning aimed at apprehending the mysteries of God insofar asthe mind was capable of such an apprehension. One of theology’s goals was alsoto enunciate defensible truth claims in accord with the faith, and arguable in thewider public sphere. In the emerging Christian context, theology was consideredforemost among modes of human knowing, and in the medieval West it was the“queen of the sciences.”More negative connotations resurfaced in Enlightenment Europe, whereleading intellectual voices favored philosophical and scientific knowledge over a“theologizing” burdened with myths and constrained by narrow-minded faith,the pseudo-science of the Bible, and extrinsic ecclesiastical authorities.2Insteadof philosophy being completed in theology, one now had to rise beyond theologyto philosophy and true science. Today, though, the views of theology in relationto science and philosophy are more nuanced and less heated. Depending on one’sdiscipline and intellectual position, one can formulate a variety of pro- or anti-theological stances or, often enough, simply ignore the category of “theology”altogether. Yet as we shall see below, theology persists in resurfacing as a seriousintellectual discipline, and today it again commands more urgent attention. HereI will argue that it is also an appropriate and useful term in the context of thestudy of Indian thought.However the debate worked out in the European context, there is no exact his-torical parallel in India, and so too there is also no identical requirement to differentiate the terms “philosophy” and “theology” (or any other candidates) inthe same way. Nevertheless, when Western scholarship turned its attention to India, one of the carry-over battles pertained to whether Indian thought was respectable, like science and philosophy, or secondary, like theology.3ModernIndian scholars have often enough appropriated the European debate on Euro-pean terms, found persuasive the Western scholarly skepticism about “theology,”and therefore taken the very idea of “Hindu theology” to be a pejorative termaimed at relegating Indian thought to a level below philosophy. On this basis,twentieth-century Indian scholars have reasonably resisted the appellation “the-ology” for the works of major Indian thinkers, even those who were scripturalexegetes, temple priests, etc.4But I suggest that denigrating or excluding “theology” is not a service to Indian thought. Rather, such a denigration reads a problem indigenous toEuropean history into an Indian context where religious commitments have 448francis clooney, sj"},{"pageNumber":456,"pageContent":"so often been deeply intertwined with the most rigorous reasoning; even a richersense of philosophy seems inadequate to the spiritual and religious values atstake; differences aside, “theology” remains a most viable and useful term.But such a claim in favor of theology is only a beginning, not a conclusion. Ifone decides to look for theology in India, the task involves reflection on Hinduintellectual discourses and an intelligent re-use of ideas rooted in Christian andWestern intellectual sensitivities.5As we shall see below, theology marks a kindof reasoning located between attention to sacred texts (s ́ravan.a) and meditation(nididhya ̄sana); it is sufficiently respectful of religious sources and authorities soas to allow them to affect how one thinks; it is likewise open to logical and rea-soned conclusions which are powerful enough to change how religious peoplethink about their beliefs. When Hindu reasoning is studied by Hindus and otherswho are genuinely interested in learning religiously from Hindu thought, therecognition of “Hindu theology” seems a timely step toward making differentfaiths and different reasons mutually intelligible.6Why bother identifying “Hindu theology”?But why? We must ask a bit more closely whether it is really important to defendreference to “theology” in the Hindu context, and whether “theology” is moreuseful than “philosophy” in identifying key aspects of Hindu thought. To beginwith, we can observe that numerous Hindu traditions were not oblivious to differences which support reference to the “theological.” Reasoning carriedforward without regard for authoritative religious sources needs to be distin-guished from reasoning marked by attention to scripture and other religiousauthorities; the latter is theological reasoning. Some Hindu reasoning is onlyvery indirectly connected with religious truth claims or religious practices; someHindu piety is deeply religious, but relatively immune to critical examination.But much reasoning and piety express a faith received and reviewed in a criticalfashion. The former reasoning and piety are close to what we mean by “philo-sophical reasoning” and “religious sentiment,” while the latter is more properly“theological reasoning.” These distinctions are important, since “theology” mostaccurately describes some of the major trajectories of Hindu thought. Sincemodern India has in fact been influenced by distinctions which originate in theWest – everything ultimately will have some name in English – and since the designation “theology” need not be pejorative,7there is no a priorireason toavoid talking about “Hindu theology” in distinction from “Hindu philosophy”and “Hindu religiosity.”Rather, it is also profitable to use the category, “Hindu theology,” even whenas scholars our goal may first of all be simply to describe what we find in Indiantexts, without making claims about the interconnections of faith and inquiry. Ifwe work with a broad and nuanced notion of theology – along with a less ide-alized and less all-encompassing notion of philosophy – we will be able to see thevirtue of reviving theology as a category for understanding Hindu thought. Ifrestoring “hindu theology” as a category449"},{"pageNumber":457,"pageContent":"we do so, we can more accurately understand which strands of Indian thoughtare most fruitfully aligned with which strands of Western thought. WhileWestern philosophy can provide a viable conversation partner for some Hinduthought, the sharp divergence of much of contemporary Western philosophyfrom much of contemporary Western Christian theology suggests too that the-ology will probably be a better partner for illuminating comparisons with themajority of the great works of the premodern Hindu tradition.We can also point to experiments in comparative theology which taketheology seriously as a viable crosscultural category, and which illumine Indianthought successfully, and more fully than would simple religious or philo-sophical analyses. A clear example is the volume Scholasticism in Cross-culturaland Comparative Perspective. Jose Cabezon, the editor, and his fellow contributors(myself included), begin with the intuition that although the elaborate theo-logical production and system of thought known as “scholasticism” is mosteasily rooted in the theology of medieval Europe, and in the works of authorssuch as Thomas Aquinas, it is possible and fruitful to use “scholasticism” toidentify ways of reasoning and even areas of content in other religious tradi-tions (although similarities will always be accompanied by differences in detailand in overall structure).8As “scholasticism” is useful cross-culturally, so too“theology.”Perhaps the most extensive recent evidence of the fruitfulness of theologicalcomparison lies in the lifelong work of Gerhard Oberhammer, retired Director of the Indological Institute at the University of Vienna. For more than threedecades Oberhammer has been committed to comparative study involving Asianand Western thought (primarily Hindu, Buddhist, and Christian) which oper-ates at a sophisticated theological level. Throughout, he has presumed that thesetraditions share interestingly similar categories (such as “revelation,” “tran-scendence,” and “sacrament”) which are not reducible to sociological or evenphilosophical concepts, and that through comparisons one can illumine thetheological traditions involved. Volumes in his ongoing comparative theologicalproject focus on the experience of transcendence, the manifestation of salvation,the transcendental hermeneutic, the notion of encounter as a religious category,and the sacramental dimension of religious traditions.9In his writings Ober-hammer is clearly aware of the perils inherent in comparative study. He knowsthat terms like “epiphany,” “transcendence,” “encounter,” and “sacrament” arerooted in technical Christian theology, and he admits that it would be facile toreduce the complexities of Indian thought to settled Christian equivalents.Arguing by analogy, though, he insists that if religious traditions such as theVedic, Buddhist, and Hindu traditions of India claim to lead practitioners beyondthe confines of this world, one can legitimately draw out the parallels with whatthe Christian theological tradition names as “sacrament,” etc.10The purposesand goals of Hindu and Christian thinkers are sufficiently shared that “theol-ogy” is useful as an overarching term which renders plausible more specific anddetailed theological comparisons. We can add that since this application helpsus to reorganize more lucidly our understanding of Indian thought, it also aids450francis clooney, sj"},{"pageNumber":458,"pageContent":"us in reconsidering, now in a broader perspective, theology in the West and inthe Christian traditions.Other examples too can be adduced. Some Hindu scholars (in the West, thusfar) are recognizing the value of theology as a category. For instance, in 1997 agroup of scholars published Meditation Revolution: A History and Theology of theSiddha Yoga Lineage,11in which they explicitly turn to the language of theology toexplain the Siddha Yoga tradition and to characterize themselves as theologians,believers, and practitioners who study their own tradition according to recog-nized scholarly standards. If it is indeed the first work in what must be a longerand richer tradition of religious reasoning about Siddha Yoga, Meditation Revo-lutionpromises rich theological results. Similarly, John Makransky and RogerJackson recently edited Buddhist Theology,12which similarly brings together thework of scholars willing both to testify to their own identity as Buddhists and tocharacterize their scholarship on Buddhism as “theological.”Clues toward the Identification of “Hindu Theology(ies)”In the first part of this chapter I simply proposed an initial case as to why it ispossible and worthwhile to interpret some strands of Indian thought as “theol-ogy.” I now wish to get more specific by identifying what can justly be called theological in the Hindu context. For this task, I now present a series ofconsiderations – e.g., themes, modes of reasoning, styles, audience expectations,the judgment of theologians – by the measure of which we can determinewhether a Hindu text or system of thought ought to be counted as theological.Each of the following clues has some merit on its own, but none is independentlysufficient, and it will not be necessary to accept all of them to justify the accep-tance of the category, “theology.” Nevertheless, in significant combinations theycan help us to make choices about texts (and systems of thought) that shouldbe called theological.13Theology as the study of GodThe simplest way to demarcate Hindutheology is to stipulate that texts whichare theological are those which have God as their primary object of intellectualinquiry. In much of what may be counted as Hindu theology the fact of a focuson a supreme, personal intelligent being who is the world source and guarantorof the significance of human life is an adequate working criterion. One canimmediately raise the question of what is meant by “God” and “gods,” and askwhether it is fair to appeal to terms like ı ̄s ́vara,bhagava ̄n,purus.a, etc.; much ofthe work of theology – Hindu or other – is devoted to specifying what we meanwhen we use “God” and accompanying words. Nonetheless an appeal to termsindicative of a highest and original source of reality – who can be referred to byrestoring “hindu theology” as a category451"},{"pageNumber":459,"pageContent":"words such as “intelligent,” “spiritual,” “person” – is a legitimate starting pointin the project of identifying “theology.”14Some substantive issues which characterize Hindu theologyI now list seven themes which help to define Hindu theology. In question aretopics of religious import which have a scriptural basis and practical import,which are not esoteric, and which can be argued even if rooted in faith. I suggestjust seven topics which can usefully distinguish theological discourse: a) thenature of a sufficient world cause, world maker; b) whether God is one or many;c) divine embodiment; d) the problem of evil; e) the nature and time of libera-tion; f) the appeal to revelation; g) “ignorance” as a theological category.a) The nature of a sufficient world cause, world-makerIn general, the debate overthe existence of God can be understood as a subdivision of a wider debate aboutwhether the world itself does or can have a satisfactory explanation. While thewider topic can be termed scientific or philosophical, the narrower form, focusedon the hypothesis that there is a person who is the source of the world, is a specif-ically theological topic. More particularly, the question is whether the worldcause can be thought of as simply a material principle, or whether a spiritualand conscious principle is the most reasonable prospect.A more particular form of the preceding initial question within the broaderIndian arguments regarding religious matters and the reliable means of reli-gious knowledge is whether there can be a convincing induction of the existenceof a world-maker. Can one offer a satisfactory explanation of the world withoutpositing that it has a maker? This question can be raised as an issue of episte-mology or an example of induction, but eventually it became a question aboutGod and a distinctively theological matter. In Vais ́es.ika empiricism, particularlyin its earlier stages, the project of a complete description of material reality ledto the question of whether that reality is explicable without reference to an exter-nal cause and measure of intelligibility, God. Eventually the Vais ́es.ika thinkers,and more prominently the Nya ̄ya logicians who commented on the basic Nya ̄yaSu ̄tras(from before the beginning of the Common Era), decided that reality couldnot be self-explanatory, and that accordingly some appeal to an exterior causewas required. The facts of ordinary reality raise questions which cannot beanswered by appeals to other aspects of ordinary reality. A clay pot is relativelysimple, but one must still explain how it got its particular shape, and perhaps toowho fused its upper and lower parts into a whole. All the more, the complexityof the world requires the postulation of an intelligent maker. Even if this makeris not seen, “he” must be posited as the cause who synthesizes the things thatare seen. This synthesizer is God.Once the Logicians entered upon this debate and decided to link the postula-tion of the existence of God with the foundations of intelligibility, they pursued452francis clooney, sj"},{"pageNumber":460,"pageContent":"the argument with great vigor. There was significant support for this kind of rea-soning about God’s existence, but the Nya ̄ya position was also criticized onlogical grounds and with respect to its religious implications, not only by non-theists but also by some theists who were not eager to adhere to a “God” (merely)knowable by induction. The outcome was a widespread debate, which includeda variety of Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain interlocutors, and it was a debate whichmade sense intellectually because “God” was accepted as a term worth arguingabout.15Many Hindu thinkers – in Nya ̄ya and Veda ̄nta, for instances – defended theidea that the world has a maker. While this argument can certainly be treatedas philosophical, particularly regarding one’s preliminary understanding ofterms such as “cause” and “effect,” “world” and “person,” most of those willingto debate the issue agreed to make the question of the nature of the cause a ques-tion of the nature of God; and for many this was also a question of under-standing God as known in scripture. In the Veda ̄nta version, the point is arguedrepeatedly in key texts, such as Uttara Mı ̄ma ̄m.sa ̄Su ̄tras1.1, 2.1, and 2.2, oftenin opposition to Sa ̄m.khya thinkers who held that there were two principles,material and spiritual. By Sa ̄m.khya reasoning, the material principle itselfsimply evolves into complex forms, and there is no need to hold that some spir-itual power governs the material principle or is its ultimate source. According toVeda ̄nta, the Upanis.ads offer a more reasonable explanation: the world causemust be a unitary principle which evolves into both spiritual and material real-ities. Since “God” is one of the more familiar terms (in English) for this spiritualcause, and since terms such as “Brahman” do not shift the force of the argu-ments significantly, the debate in general seems most easily described as theological.b) Whether God is one or manyEven if it makes sense to argue about causality– divine or other – and about the possible existence of a divine world-maker, itrequires a greater and more intense consensus to argue about further, more spe-cific issues, such as whether more can be said about God. In some circles, though,the topic of more specific knowledge of God was considered arguable, not merelya matter of belief and personal preference but as a matter of sense and truth,and was debated vehemently, in a debate best described as theological.To draw on just one sectarian example: Veda ̄nta Des ́ika, the fourteenth-century theologian of the Vis ́is.t.a ̄dvaita Veda ̄nta school (in turn rooted in the the-ology of Ra ̄ma ̄nuja [eleventh century]), argues that there is only one ultimatereality, who is the Lord Na ̄ra ̄yan.a (Vis.n.u) eternally accompanied by the GoddessS ́rı ̄. At the same time Vis.n.u is also Brahman, the Reality described in the ancientUpanis.ads. In his S ́rı ̄mad Rahasyatrayasa ̄ra, after a consideration of God’s per-fections in relation to other components of reality, Des ́ika turns to the questionof Na ̄ra ̄yan.a’s relation to other deities. He argues that there can only be one trueGod and it is possible and urgent to decide which deity is that true God. Sincereligious practice and salvation are ultimately dependent on a right relationshiprestoring “hindu theology” as a category453"},{"pageNumber":461,"pageContent":"with the true God, it is possible and necessary to know this God correctly. Properexegesis and clear reasoning will indicate that Na ̄ra ̄yan.a alone is the lord of theuniverse, neither S ́iva nor Brahma ̄.In his Nya ̄ya Siddha ̄ñjanaDes ́ika sets the argument on a firm philosophicalground, arguing that the notion of divine perfection requires that God be one,while the human experience of the divine, however limited, does not require thatGod be imagined in numerous forms rather than one form.16Although nondu-alist Veda ̄nta thinkers did not see a personal God as a primary constituent intheir system, they were willing to debate the oneness of God; a multiplicity ofgods makes no sense in terms of ultimate reality, but only on the level of popularpiety.17This kind of argument – one God, or several gods, or a Reality beyondgods – makes sense only within the frame of certain presuppositions which, Isuggest, are “theological.”c) Divine embodimentA third, consequent theological topic has to do withwhether it is meaningful to claim that God can be embodied. The Hindu (andBuddhist and Jaina) intellectuals who argued for and against the existence ofGod and about the divine nature also asked whether it makes sense to say thatGod can have and actually does have a body. On one level, this is a faith matterof great importance for the S ́aiva and Vais.n.ava communities; each in its ownway celebrates divine embodiment. But in both cases, it is also an issue requir-ing extensive intellectual inquiry.On the S ́aiva side, for instance, Arul.nanti’s thirteenth-century Civaña ̄nacit-tiya ̄roffers a rich positive exposition of S ́iva’s embodiment, developed forcefullyand in considerable detail. In section I.2 of the constructive part (Supakkam) ofCivaña ̄nacittiya ̄rArul.nanti defends the idea that the Lord can have a body, forthe simple reason that God is all-powerful and can do anything he chooses.Arul.nanti firmly asserts the perfection and freedom of S ́iva in his choice of formssimply as a matter of divine freedom. S ́iva’s mysterious play of forms, hiscomplex and shifting use of forms, is a purposeful divine pedagogy, aimed atleading humans through the mystery of physical and spiritual forms of exis-tence, from mere identification with material form to deeper and more spiritualunderstandings of the true meaning of “self ” and “having a form.”18For Vais.n.ava theologians too, the discussion of body as limitation aimed atruling out notions of divine embodiment which would constrict the divine per-fection. Yet in certain important features the Vais.n.ava theology of the divinebody differs from S ́aiva theology. Both material and spiritual realities arise froma single source and need not be seen as contrary to one another. God relates tothe world as that upon which the world depends entirely and that which givesit life, though without God’s being dependent on the world; analogously, the soulinhabits, gives life to, and guides the material body, without itself suffering mate-riality. Accordingly, Vais.n.ava theologians seem more open to the idea that Godcan assume specific bodies, either animal or human, and live over time withinthose specific forms.454francis clooney, sj"},{"pageNumber":462,"pageContent":"Whether or not one agrees that it makes sense to claim that God can assumea physical body, I suggest that in the Hindu context this is an intelligible issueperceived of as worthy of argument. So too, it is best seen as a marker of a debatewhich is best understood as theological and not simply philosophical nor merelya sectarian protestation.d) The problem of evilThe problem of evil is discussed in India as in the West,despite important differences in the framing of the discussion, ranging from thefactor of rebirth to the significance rendered to pain itself. But theodicy was stillan issue: if there is a God (or transcendent world source) who is all-powerful,how are suffering and inequality to be accounted for? In Uttara Mı ̄ma ̄m.sa ̄Su ̄tras2.1.34–6 this question is addressed by both nondualist Veda ̄nta thinkers (suchas S ́am.kara) and theistic thinkers (such as Ra ̄ma ̄nuja). To argue that the intelli-gent divine source who consciously arranged the world is cruel and unfair is alsoan argument that the Veda ̄nta position in favor of a unitary material and spiri-tual cause is ultimately incoherent; to support their view of the origin of theworld, the Veda ̄nta thinkers must account for evil. This argument, for andagainst the idea that divine perfection is harmonious with the state of the worldas humans experience it, is important and intelligible in a theological contextwhere notions of God, divine power, moral standards of good and evil, respon-sibility and guilt, are accepted as arguable and intelligible. While the argumentthat there is an ultimate right order and justice in the world need not be theis-tic, they are most likely theological. The problem of theodicy can arise becausethere is some expectation of perfection or of an intelligible order, which leads tothe mounting of a defense of the world as a coherent and intelligible whole. Ifthere is no such perfection, the theology dissolves and the problem loses itsurgency.19e) The nature and time of liberationAnother important question which serves tomark off theological ground is whether liberation is possible within a given life-time (as jı ̄vanmukti) or only after death. This too is a “boundary” question bestconsidered theological, since it relies on the premise that it is intelligible to speakof “liberation,” and that arguing between the alternatives of “liberation whilealive” and “liberation after death” is important and makes sense, given intelligi-ble positions about the world and the possibility and need for liberation. To besure, arguing about jı ̄vanmuktiinvolves factors which can be examined nonthe-ologically: for example, estimates of the human condition, whether that condi-tion can be radically improved, the means by which one overcomes the ailmentsof life, why death might be considered not merely the end but also a transitionalstate, and how one might even know that a person is to be judged not merelyholy or wise but actually liberated. The presuppositions are specific enough andinvolve sufficient religious values that one can rightly see discussions of libera-tion as most intelligible in a theological context.20restoring “hindu theology” as a category455"},{"pageNumber":463,"pageContent":"f) The appeal to revelationOur sixth example of a kind of discussion that is most properly termed “theological” has to do with the appeal to revelation,authoritative verbal testimony. We can begin by noting that Indian intellectualswere concerned to determine the proper modes of knowing which produceproper and reliable knowledge, and likewise uncover and dispel ignorance. Theconcern to understand properly the criteria for right knowledge is of course nota disposition unique to theology; but the disposition of some Hindu systems notonly to defend the need for reliable verbal communication but also to highlightspecific privileged (oral and written) texts does characterize theologicaldiscourse.In arguments among themselves and also with Buddhist and Jaina inter-locutors, Hindu thinkers analyzed the knowing process in a sophisticatedfashion, arguing the viability of truth claims and proposing subtle distinctionsand relations among the means of right knowing (prama ̄n.a), objects of rightknowing (prameya), and right knowledge (prama ̄).21Ideally, perception is the sufficient reliable means of knowledge.But since the argument that everything knowable can be known by simpleperception is never persuasively argued, supplementary means of right knowingmultiply. Intellectuals who are theologians are concerned with the truth of theirfaith positions, and are compelled to articulate and defend verbal authority, andultimately a idea of a privileged verbal knowledge, revelation. It is properly and distinctively theological to ask whether there is something that can be called“revelation,” a privileged body of verbal testimony which informs humans aboutaspects of reality which are not otherwise knowable.It is within a theological context that one can argue about this. Indian intel-lectuals may be divided into those who accept this privileged verbal informationand those who do not. In turn, those accepting revelation are further differenti-ated when one attempts to discern which words and texts, in which language(s),are revelatory. We see revelation defended in the Mı ̄ma ̄m.sa ̄ and Veda ̄nta, forinstance, particularly in argument with Buddhists and others skeptical about the authority of the Veda. Here one can distinguish thinkers inside and outsidethe Vedic tradition, and those adhering strictly to Sanskrit-language revelationfrom those willing to admit vernacular revelations.g) “Ignorance” as a theological categoryIf right knowledge becomes a theologi-cally distinctive category, it follows too that ignorance too becomes an episte-mological issue with theological and soteriological import. In the nondualistVeda ̄nta tradition avidya ̄is treated as a problem but also afforded an explanatoryrole, since this Veda ̄nta tradition has a vested interest in seeing ignorance as thecause of suffering and its removal as the appropriate response to suffering. Theissue is both whether the incongruities between scriptural promises and reali-ties on the one hand and the evident realities of ordinary life on the other haveto be explained in terms of objective differences and contradictions, or rather byappeal to a concept of ignorance which reduces differences to temporary defects456francis clooney, sj"},{"pageNumber":464,"pageContent":"in the observer. Perhaps things are as they are because of an individual and evencosmic confusion which distorts reality and alienates humans from their world.“Ignorance” thus has considerable implications for the analysis of the humancondition, the problem of bondage, and prospects for liberation. The study ofignorance too merits the title of a theological topic and, since it is not a topicwhich is restricted to one or another sectarian audience, it can be argued amonga wider range of Hindu thinkers.To conclude this section: the preceding considerations sketch a range of themeslikely to be found in theological discussions and so too to distinguish those dis-cussions. Someone can believe that there is one God who is maker of the world,takes on a body, is testified to in scripture, yet without also being willing to arguein defense of those beliefs. So too, there can be intellectuals who disagree withsuch beliefs, but who also think that it is possible and important to arguethrough one’s objections to those beliefs. It is when we find a context in whichthese matters are subjected to intellectual scrutiny, for the sake of approval ordisagreement, that we have a theological context.Mananaas theological reasoningIn the preceding sections I have linked theology not simply to religious beliefs,but also to religious truths and “public” positions liable to reasoned argumen-tation. Now I further develop this view, since key to theology is the convergenceof belief and reason: certain strands of Hindu thought are theological alsobecause in them we see operative a certain kind of reasoning that is focused –and constricted – by religious concerns. Often appeals to this kind of reasoningbalance an insistence that such reasoning is entirely logical with an insistencethat it is deeply indebted to sources ordinarily inaccessible to the hman mind. Itis a reasoning “freely” constrained by boundaries set according to some recog-nized authority, most commonly (though not only) verbal authority as revela-tion and/or scripture.22The Veda ̄nta commentators, for example, agree thatreasoning leads to knowledge of Brahman, but also that Brahman can be knownonly by a reasoning which submits to revelation and draws its conclusions consequent upon revelation.A key source for the influential Veda ̄nta understanding of the ordering andorganization of knowledge as theological is related to the injunction in theBr.hada ̄ran.yaka Upanis.ad, 2.4.5: “One’s self must be seen, must be heard, mustbe reasoned about, must be meditated on” – hearing properly (s ́ravan.a), reason-ing properly (manana), meditating properly (nididhya ̄sana), together climax invision (dars ́ana). As attention to scripture, hearing (s ́ravan.a) is the necessarybeginning of the project of learning; it must be followed by reasoning (manana)which inquires into the meaning and implications of what has been understood.But neither is reason theologically conclusive, since one must also go farther andengage in meditation, nididhya ̄sana.23restoring “hindu theology” as a category457"},{"pageNumber":465,"pageContent":"The intermediate stage, manana, is the reasoning which interests us here asproperly theological reasoning. It opens in both directions – toward sacred wordand toward meditation, constrained by scriptural boundaries and oriented to acompletion in religious practice – yet it remains recognizably logical, aimed atunderstanding, assertive of truth claims which are to some extent generalizable,accessible to argument and critique. Other kinds of reasoning, such as mightoperate mainly in terms of an analysis of human experience or simply in termsof repetition of scriptural claims without analysis, can be accounted for by otherterms, e.g., as philosophy or as confessional religious testimony.In numerous contexts Hindu thinkers sought to defend the possibility of andneed for rational reflection on faith issues, aiming at a delicate balance. Ratio-nalists, including some philosophers, may argue that reasoning should proceedsimply in terms of questions, problems, and doubts which can be resolved strictlyon logical grounds, and that all other matters are less intellectual matters, ofreligious sentiment. Religious conservatives may insist that the Veda is totallyclear, coherent, and need not be subjected to any critical examination. Againstboth positions, the theological mean represented by mananaholds the view thatfaith can be reasonable, yet still faith; thinking can submit to scripture, yet stillbe thinking.To illustrate how this reasoning was understood in the Hindu context I willdraw on three texts, two classical and one modern, which indicate respectivelyhow there is a reality, beyond texts, which can be known; how even the truth ofscripture can be argued; how theological reasoning is submissive to revelation. Ibegin with several of the va ̄rtikasof Sures ́vara (ninth century) on S ́an.kara’s commentary on the Br.hada ̄ran.yaka Upanis.ad2.4.5. Sures ́vara explains how thefour seeming injunctions – “it must be seen, it must be heard, it must be reasonedabout, it must be meditated on” – form a single integral enjoined activity.24Hesays that while the “seeing” mentioned in the Upanis.ad (“it must be seen”)cannot be enjoined, the means to that seeing – i.e., the “hearing” of theUpanis.adic texts, and the intellectual consideration of those texts – can beenjoined as the necessary means. This appropriate, always subsequent “reason-ing” focuses on the direct and implied meanings of scriptural texts and similarissues. Conformed to the words of the Veda, it aims at determining the relation-ship between verbal expressions and what is expressed by them. Revelation is thesource of liberative vision, but (with a teacher’s help) one must understand scrip-ture first. Neither does reasoning conclude merely in understanding texts, sincethe primary claim, “one should see,” also indicates a desire to know reality in itsessence. Were the goal simply the experience of insight, without an objective referent, the requirement that one must reason about the meaning of scripturewould have no point. Reasoning must therefore open into meditation.Thus, to draw on another familiar Veda ̄nta text as an example, the Veda ̄ntastudent must inquire into the meaning of “that” (tat) and “thou” (tvam) in theCha ̄ndogyaphrase “that thou art” (tat tvam asi). The goal of this inquiry is tolearn about the nondual nature of reality itself. This reasoning opens into thataccomplishment of vision which “dawns” subsequently in meditation, like the458francis clooney, sj"},{"pageNumber":466,"pageContent":"rising sun. Based in revelation and open to a more experiential completion, thisreasoning, supported by both the Cha ̄ndogyaandBr.hada ̄ran.yakaUpanis.ads, is areasoning which we can call theological reasoning.A second interpretation ofmananais drawn from the introduction to theNya ̄yakusuma ̄ñjaliof Udayana (tenth century), specifically a section of Vard-hama ̄na’s Praka ̄s ́acommentary in which Vardhama ̄na explores the kind ofinquiry that is possible and appropriate when God is the topic of inquiry. Inagreement with other commentators on Udayana’s text, Vardhama ̄na seeks tojustify the kind of inquiry that Udayana undertakes in his treatise; he too is con-cerned to defend it against views which would make reasoning about God unvi-able: i.e., God is so well known that there is nothing to think about; everybodyknows something about God, but nobody can speak with certainty, so it is all amatter of opinion; scripture is so perfectly informative that there is no need tothink about God at all, since one already knows.Vardhama ̄na discusses the Br.hada ̄ran.yakainjunction to think – “one shouldreason on it” in light of its implications for reasoning that is submissive to theUpanis.ads, and specifically with regard to whether it is even possible to argueabout “God.” Following the intuition which underlies the Nya ̄yakusuma ̄ñjali, hewants to explain the inquiry into God as respecting scripture without treating itas inadequate, yet too without allowing it to snuff out thinking; respectingcommon opinions while critiquing them; and not projecting knowledge of Godas merely the ever-receding horizon of inquiry.Vardhama ̄na argues that the inquiry into the existence of God which is takenup in the Nya ̄yakusuma ̄ñjaliis a real inquiry, not simply a review of positionsalready known by faith. While some observers might be tempted to reverse thesequence of “hearing” and “reasoning” and give preference to reasoning, suchthat scripture is to be consulted only for clarification, it is more plausible, giventhe sequence found in the Br.hada ̄ran.yakatext – “it must be heard, it must be rea-soned about” – that the study of the texts comes first, and that reflection is sub-sequent to that study. It is economical to see this reasoning as focused on textualinterpretation and not more broadly on the wider variety of aspects of “God”that might come to mind. Were the objects of “it must be heard” and “it mustbe reasoned about” different, then no real progress could be made by combiningthe study of texts with reasoning. The implication is rather that real exegesismust lead to real reasoning.It is true, Vardhama ̄na concedes, that religious people may not have doubtsabout God, since there is nothing to be learned about the lord which is not inscripture, and since what scripture says about the lord is reliable knowledge.Mananamust therefore be respectful reasoning, which does not call into ques-tion the authority of the scriptures. Indeed, there would be no motive to thinkabout scriptures were they not authoritative. But neither is this reasoning merelyan explication of the texts which sorts out what is to be taken literally overagainst what is metaphorical. Rather, reasoning aims at grasping the texts’meanings more precisely, even while never doubting their truth. Moreover,doubts can arise. Even if one may not doubt God’s existence, one can takerestoring “hindu theology” as a category459"},{"pageNumber":467,"pageContent":"seriously doubts about the inference of a world-maker. One cannot know Godwithout attributing some characteristics to him, which can be sorted out onlyby comparing and contrasting them with one another, in a reasonable fashion.25Our third reference which illuminates the nature ofmananaas theologicalreasoning draws on the theory of a twentieth-century pandit, Vasudeva ShastriAbhyankar. In his Sanskrit introduction to the Sarvadars ́anasam.grahaofVidya ̄ran.ya (fourteenth century), he distinguishes two kinds ofdars ́ana(ways ofthinking, systems of thought): the “scripturalist” (s ́a ̄striya)dars ́anas and the“rationalist” (tarka)dars ́anas. In the former category he places Mı ̄ma ̄m.sa ̄ ritualtheory, Veda ̄nta Upanis.adic interpretation and system, and Grammar(Vy a ̄karan.a), while in the latter he places Nya ̄ya logic, Vais ́es.ika naturalism, andthe Sa ̄m.khya/Yoga theory of the separate material and spiritual causes. Thereason for the distinction of the s ́a ̄striya dars ́anaandtarka dars ́anais not simplythat the former rely on scripture while the latter rely only on reason; thinkers inboth groups respect both sources of knowledge. But Abhyankar’s concern is the“bottom line”: if one is concerned with ascertaining the real truth about some-thing, and if there is a conflict between scripture and reason, what is one’s finalresort? He says that Mı ̄ma ̄m.sa ̄, Veda ̄nta, and Grammar are all s ́a ̄striya dars ́anaswhich come down on the side of scripture, to which reason must conform itself.Conversely, Sa ̄m.khya, Yoga, and Nya ̄ya are tarka dars ́anas because even iftheir theoreticians respect scripture, the fundamental resource is reason, notscripture. Arguments and authorities must make sense, and scripture must beinterpreted in such a way that it conforms to reason. It seems evident, I suggest,that the s ́a ̄striya dars ́anasare “theological,” and the tarka dars ́anasare“philosophical”;26mananais theological, tarkaphilosophical.27Throughout, however, it is important to retain a sense that even theologicalpositions are arguable positions. This arguability is crucial, since where positionsare asserted merely on the basis of authority – the text, a guru, a divine speaker– we have something less than a rational discourse, something which is not theo-logy. When argument is possible, it characterizes important, complete systemsof thought in which progress is possible even on matters important for religiousbelievers and practitioners. Most Nya ̄ya, Mı ̄ma ̄m.sa ̄, and Veda ̄nta texts, and somevernacular texts, e.g., in the Tamil Vais.n.ava and S ́aiva traditions, demonstratethis argumentative possibility, and thus are theological texts.Language, commentary, and communityA final set of clues has to do with issues related to style, context, and community: like other intellectual discourses, theology communicates in acertain way, and meets certain expectations. Here I suggest just three ways ofbeginning to explore these more elusive, contextual factors.CommentarySome religious texts stimulate commentary while others do not;some texts are commentaries, while others are not. I suggest that within the460francis clooney, sj"},{"pageNumber":468,"pageContent":"broader range of religious literature, the fact of commentary can be an import-ant clue to the presence of theological discourse. While being-commented-on isnot an obligatory feature of a theological text, texts with commentaries arebetter candidates for the title “theological” than those not commented on, sincecommentary indicates the recognition that the text’s ideas are worthy of furtherreflection and expansion. Authors who comment on some older religious textsare marking those texts as possessed of important though often difficult or subtletheological import which needs to be brought to articulation. Some texts deserveand require commentary, because they contain truth which requires elucida-tion; and such texts, along with their commentaries, are theological. Sacred textswhich are not commented on, or only in the simplest of word by word explica-tions, may be considered religiously inspiring but not theologically weighty.Thus, the Bhagavad Gı ̄ta ̄receives multiple serious commentaries, while mostother portions of the Maha ̄bha ̄ratado not. In turn, we may attribute theologicalsignificance to secondary texts, some themselves commentaries, which have infact generated further commentary, since further commentary too indicates theintellectualrespect afforded to such relgiious texts.Must Hindu theology be Sanskrit-language discourse?A still more elusive clue hasto do with the importance of the Sanskrit language itself with respect to Indianintellectual systems. While one cannot endorse the assertion that Indian intel-lectual discourse is always Sanskrit language-discourse, one can say that muchof it is precisely that, or at least composed in a context heavily indebted to San-skrit. Of course, a pervasive reverence for sacred sound and sacred word accruesto writings in Sanskrit; it seems that almost anything written in Sanskrit canelicit religious reverence. But in addition we can more narrowly assert that“Sanskrit reasoning” distinguishes much of what in fact counts as integralHindu theology. To think and write systematically in traditional Hindu India wasto compose in Sanskrit or in a way deeply indebted to Sanskrit. On this basis,theology might be treated as a Sanskritic mode of discourse, while writings in vernacular languages are less likely to achieve the “religious intellectuality,”systematic specificity, and arguability which characterize the theological.28Ipropose that Hindu theology is ordinarily Sanskrit-language discourse, eithercomposed in the Sanskrit language or in languages deeply influenced by San-skritic reasoning. While in theory this need not be the case, it seems in fact to beso.There are vernacular texts which fit the description of theology offered herewithout being deeply influenced by Sanskrit language discourse, but they arerare. I think immediately of key Tamil Vais.n.ava and S ́aiva texts, works which arerichly reflective and critical in their reasoning: e.g., in the Vais.n.ava tradition,Tirumal ̄icai A ̄l ̄va ̄r’s Na ̄n ̄mukan ̄Tiruvanta ̄tiand S ́at.ako ̄pan ̄’s Tiruva ̄ymol ̄i(ca.ninth century) and the long and rich tradition of commentary and treatisewhich the latter inspired,29and the S ́aiva Civaña ̄napo ̄tam, works which it inspiredsuch as Arul.nanti’s Civaña ̄nacittiya ̄r, along with other S ́aiva treaties such asUma ̄pati’s Tiruvarut.payan ̄(fourteenth century).30restoring “hindu theology” as a category461"},{"pageNumber":469,"pageContent":"Theology within a community at home with theologyFinally, it is worth observ-ing that theology does not occur in isolation from the community of those whowrite it and those who read it. It is recognizable as it is received, according tocertain audience and professional theological expectations. We have alreadyseen that the reasoning here proposed as theological is a reasoning which opensitself for a completion in religious realization, e.g., in that meditation (nidi-dhya ̄sana) which is subsequent upon a reasoned reflection (manana) on what onehas learned from scripture (s ́ravan.a). Theological reasoning imposes particularexpectations upon persons who read particular texts, texts revered within somecommunity.These expectations can be read in two directions. From one vantage point, acommunity may have specific expectations regarding particular authors whoare, or aren’t, to be called theologians. If a community expects an intellectualproduction to be merely informational or merely the explication of technicaldetails for the sake of a specialized audience, that writing will probably not betheological. If a community expects a text to report encounters with God, toarouse deep inspiration, or offer instruction on moral and ritual practices, thelikely author may be honored as a saint or prophet or teacher, but not as a theologian. Only if a community (or at least its elite) values the intellectualcontent of religious texts and the truth claims generated in relation to those textswill it interpret texts or commentaries as intelligently explicating the beliefs ofthe community, undergirding them with sufficient philosophical foundations,and defending them against competing philosophical and religious systems.Received in this way, texts may be properly recognized as “theological,” and theirauthors as theologians.From the author’s vantage point, of course, the matter comes to much thesame thing, since authors intend particular audiences. Communities expectingtheology and authors seeking a theological audience find one another withinlarger religious communities. If an author aims at aiding a religious audiencein thinking through the meaning and implications of its faith (in general, andparticularly in its scriptural sources), or at least in defending the intelligibilityand plausibility of faith, then that author’s work is an intellectual productiondistinguished by theological intentions. But if the author intends no such com-munication with a practicing religious community, he or she is likely not to bea theologian.Finally, a simpler way to state the preceding is to suggest that theology will be recognized by those who have theological commitments already. If one hastheological sensitivities, one will be able to decide what is theological and whatis not. It makes no sense to leave the judgment on this matter to those who havedecided that theology is not a possible and useful category by which intellectualmaterials can be categorized. This circularity is surely not very different from thesituation evident in other fields; it is no surprise that historical or literary studiesdepend on historians or critics for apt recognition of the categories of textsinvolved. Indologists recognize other Indologists, subaltern critics their own con-trary peers, and theologians find their own kind too. I admit this circularity not462francis clooney, sj"},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"to mark off theology as the exclusive preserve of theologians – it must remainintellectual, arguable, etc., and surely others can have negative as well as posi-tive opinions – but rather to stress that judgments in this regard cannot beentirely bereft of theological sensitivity.Of course, since theology has communal roots, it must be the theologians ofthe Hindu tradition who must take the lead in maintaining and fostering Hindutheology. Theologians from other traditions (such as this author) must makeonly tentative judgments about what seems to be theological and where Hindutheologizing might lead. In any case, it is opportune to admit here that if muchof this chapter is dedicated to identifying “Hindu theology” in the great classi-cal traditions, it will be up to intellectuals writing today, who are willing to becalled “Hindu theologians,” to chart the course of the future of Hindu theology.Theology as complex discourseEven if we decide that there is such a thing as Hindu theology and are willing todraw upon the preceding suggestions to build a case for identifying specificHindu theological texts, the decision about what is theological will never be amatter of determining a text “theological,” or not, in a simple, straightforwardmanner, as if theology can be only a simple discourse produced simply. A workthat is justly called “theological” need not be uniformly theological in all itsparts; theology can be divided into parts and subdisciplines, some of which arenot theological. In the Catholic theological context, for example, in schools and seminaries where theology is taught, one finds it standard to differentiatetheology into disciplines such as Biblical Studies, Church History, Dogmatic andSystematic Theology, Moral Theology (and/or Theological Ethics), Pastoral Theology, etc. In his Method in Theology, the twentieth-century Christian the-ologian Bernard Lonergan argued that theology is a necessarily complex activ-ity which operates in harmony with the different levels of human cognition andincludes eight disciplines which complement and confirm one another.31“The-ology” is the umbrella term for all these disciplines in the Roman Catholic tradition, since they are all intended to contribute to an overall theological education which necessarily includes such subareas, and since all together con-tribute to the still larger task of understanding the faith, accomplishing know-ledge of God insofar as this is humanly possible. Moreover, a line of reasoningor argument that at one point meets the criteria for theology may later on ceaseto be theological. Theology is complex and complicated, and it has a history.There is no reason to assume that Hindu theology should be any more simpleor uniform than Christian theology. It is necessary to differentiate Hindu theol-ogy according to its subsidiary disciplines, some of which may be particularlyphilological or philosophical, others more exegetical, and still others more prac-tical. For instance, a very old model for the distinction among disciplines con-tributing to a single whole is found in the Vedic ritual field, where the Veda, as(oral) text and practice, is supported by six ancillary disciplines: recitationrestoring “hindu theology” as a category463"},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"(s ́ı ̄ks.a ̄), metrics (chandas), grammar (vya ̄karan.a), etymology (nirukta), astrology(jyotis.a), rubrics (kalpa). Taken in isolation, some of these disciplines are intellectually interesting discourses which can well be studied apart from anyrelationship to Vedic performance, but in light of the stipulation that they areancillary to the Veda they are defined as contributing to the overall project ofVedic theory and practice.Other models too are available. After 300 bcethe Mı ̄ma ̄m.sa ̄ ritual theoristsformalized their division of the Veda into a series of interlocking subsidiarymodes of discourse, for example, mantras (recited in rituals), bra ̄hman.as (descrip-tive and prescriptive of ritual actions), and arthava ̄das (narratives and other literary formations supportive of performance). Underlying this division is therecognition that the fundamental Mı ̄ma ̄m.sa ̄ project, dharma-jijña ̄sa ̄(the inquiryinto the intelligibility ofdharma) was rightly differentiated into subdisciplines,all of which together constituted the study ofdharma.Similarly, the Veda ̄nta (Uttara Mı ̄ma ̄m.sa ̄) system distinguished the funda-mental inquiry into brahman(brahma-jijña ̄sa ̄) by discerning more limited tasks,such as demonstrating that Brahman alone is the real topic of Veda ̄nta (UttaraMı ̄ma ̄m.sa ̄Su ̄trasI), defending the reasonability of Veda ̄nta exegesis against a variety of theological and nontheological opponents (II), harmonizing medi-tation texts with one another (III), and clarifying the cosmology of the post-mortem world and other objective referents important for the coherence of the Veda ̄nta system (IV). None of these tasks is the same, and some may beconceived of as pretheological, yet together they form a unitary theologicalsystem.Or, in S ́aiva A ̄gama and Vais.n.ava Pañcara ̄tra texts, we find a standard dis-tinction of four sections devoted respectively to knowledge, ritual practice, meditative practice, and proper behavior. This differentiation too makes sense.While the “knowledge section” and its discussion of God’s existence and naturemost smoothly fit the notion of a systematic theology, it would be pointless tolimit theology to this kind of theory; the more practical considerations of ritual,meditation, and ethics are important too, as complementary discourses whichfulfill a theological function and together combine to form a richer whole that istheological.32Using the Clues: Some Theological and Nontheological TextsWe have thus far identified clues toward the identification of Hindu theology:content, mode of reasoning, “style,” and (in an admittedly circular fashion) the expectations of communities valuing theology. In calling these factors “distinguishing features” or “clues,” I readily concede that there is unlikely to bea sure and exclusive determination of what’s theological and what’s not. But letus conclude by applying what we have discovered, nominating some texts for thetitle “theology” and denying this appellation to others. The point of what follows464francis clooney, sj"},{"pageNumber":472,"pageContent":"is not to determine a conclusive list of major Hindu theologians and theologicalworks, but rather to illustrate the nature of the judgments necessarily involved,by attention to some Nya ̄ya, Veda ̄nta, and Mı ̄ma ̄m.sa ̄ texts, and a few otherinstances of Hindu intellectual discourse. I assume from the start that ourattention is focused only on plausible candidates for the title, and thus omit con-sideration of the wider range of intellectual production in the sciences and lit-erary fields. I also exclude works which may be theology, but not Hindu theology,e.g., the entire corpus of Buddhist and Jaina writings in traditional India. Finally,I limit my consideration to premodern works, though one could easily extendthe analysis to the theological credentials of more recent authors, ranging fromRam Mohan Roy and Keshab Chandra Sen to Sri Aurobindo and RamanaMaharshi, and to contemporary Hindu scholars writing both inside and outsideof India.Let us begin with Nya ̄ya. The early commentators on the Nya ̄ya Su ̄trasandauthors like Jayanta Bhat.t.a (ninth century) who wrote more systematic trea-tises developed increasingly sophisticated treatments of God’s existence and thedivine nature. Theological reflection – about God, using religious sources ofknowledge – came to the fore in the midst of a broader concern for proper logic,rhetoric, epistemology, and ontology. Much in the commentarial texts and in Jayanta’s Nya ̄yamañjarı ̄is not solely or primarily theological, and could just as well be located in some other disciplines. By contrast, Udayana’sNya ̄yakusuma ̄ñjaliis a substantive theological work entirely devoted to the topicof God’s existence. Building on earlier resources in the Nya ̄ya tradition, it bringsgreat originality to its consideration of the question of God, and argues its claimsabout God within a broad framework capable of convening a conversation acrossnumerous religious boundaries.But some Nya ̄ya treatments of God move from the realm of intentional theology to that of a more rarified logical analysis which simply retains olderand more theological elements. Although “God” is considered in a way that may be theologically useful in such works, they need not be thought of as the-ological. For example, I suggest that the I ̄s ́varava ̄da(Discourse on God) section ofGan.ges ́a’s Tattvacinta ̄man.i(thirteenth century) takes up the topic of God as anintellectually interesting one, but not as a living theological concern. Gan.ges ́aexplores the arguments about God’s existence in great detail, yet only within an exhaustive treatment of a wider range of epistemological concerns.33TheI ̄s ́varava ̄dais only the twenty-first part of the second book, itself devoted to an analysis of inference. The consideration of God is preceded by sections onthe construction of a good inference, fallacies, and generalization. It is followedby sections on causal efficacy and liberation. The third book then turns to thetopic of comparison (upama ̄na). “God” is one more topic to be sorted out andunderstood properly, one component within a much larger philosophical work; what had been a standard theological topic is taken up by Gan.ges ́a primarily for its epistemological value. Gan.ges ́a is a superb logician who cananalyze theological topics with subtlety; but he is not a theologian even whendiscussing God.restoring “hindu theology” as a category465"},{"pageNumber":473,"pageContent":"If we can admit that a tradition need not be focused on God to be theological,we can recognize many writings in the Mı ̄ma ̄m.sa ̄ tradition of ritual analysis astheological, despite Mı ̄ma ̄m.sa ̄’s rejection of the notion of a God who is creatorof the world or author of the Veda. Given the orientation of the earlier Mı ̄ma ̄m.sa ̄texts to the proper understanding of ritual and text – the dharmain theory andpractice – we can hypothesize that much of the writing of the eighth-centuryscholars Prabha ̄kara and Kuma ̄rila is theological, even if sections of theirlengthy commentaries are primarily grammatical or epistemological. Amonglater treatises, one notices texts like the Mı ̄ma ̄m.sa ̄ Paribha ̄s.aof Kr.s.n.a Yajvan(eighteenth century) which focus on the terms and distinctions essential to ritualanalysis.34Others, such as the Ma ̄nameyodaya, a seventeenth-century Bha ̄t.t.aMı ̄ma ̄m.sa ̄ work composed by Na ̄ra ̄yan.abhat.t.atiri and Na ̄ra ̄yan.asudhı ̄,35focus onepistemological issues and a standard list of the objects of proper knowledge,including God, the elements of the cosmos, and the self of the ritual agent. BoththeMı ̄ma ̄m.sa ̄ Paribha ̄s.aand the Ma ̄nameyodayamay be considered primarily theological works which however include major sections only propaedeutic tothe specifically religious topics related to ritual performance. Finally, however,we can point to a nontheological Mı ̄ma ̄m.sa ̄ treatise, such as the thoroughly analytic Nı ̄titattva ̄virbha ̄vaof Cida ̄nanda (thirteenth century), which focuses onthe nature of causality, sense perception, etymology, relation, the ultimate constituents of reality, truth and falsity, the nature of reality as nondual or dual(argued on logical grounds), and the nature of God, self, and words. Even ifCida ̄nanda takes up issues of vital importance in theological contexts, his trea-tise is significantly enough removed from the concerns of ritual, dharma, theismand atheism, that his tour de forcecan be treated as a philosophical and not theological work.Veda ̄nta, in its various schools, is by most standards theological, the hesita-tions reported by DeSmet notwithstanding. Veda ̄nta gives clear priority to scrip-ture over all other means of right knowledge. In the nondualist Veda ̄nta we seeoperative that theological reasoning (manana) which positions itself betweenscripture and religious practice; yet one also sees Veda ̄nta works which stand ata slightly greater distance and contribute indirectly to Veda ̄nta theology. Thesepoints can be exemplified with reference to two nondualist Veda ̄nta texts, theVe d a ̄nta Paribha ̄s.aand the Vivekacud.a ̄man.i.TheVe d a ̄nta Paribha ̄s.aby Dharmara ̄ja Adhvarı ̄ndra (seventeenth century) isa basic Nondualist Veda ̄nta manual.36In its first six chapters it analyzes themeans of right knowledge, including perception, induction, comparison, verbalknowledge, presumption, and non-apprehension. These chapters can be takenas philosophical clarifications of issues which must be worked out for the sakeof a smoothly functioning theology, and in light of them Dharmara ̄ja considersthe specific scriptural subject matter and religious purposes of Veda ̄nta in theParibha ̄s.a’s seventh and eighth chapters respectively. While most of the Ve d a ̄ntaParibha ̄s.amight be taken as philosophical and not theological, all the partscohere and find integration in the final soteriological concern, so one can termthe whole of it theological.466francis clooney, sj"},{"pageNumber":474,"pageContent":"TheVivekacud.a ̄man.i(after 800 ce) is a work of 580 (mostly) two-line verses.37It is implicitly and sometimes explicitly structured according to the line of think-ing evident in some key Upanis.adic texts; it subtly weaves together the tasks ofstudying the texts, reflecting on their meaning, and drawing that meaning intomeditation leading to realization. The Vivekacud.a ̄man.iis explicitly religious andcritically reasonable all the way through, and likewise it subjects that religiousreasoning to critical reflection. In a more integral fashion than is the case withtheVe d a ̄nta Paribha ̄s.a, the Vivekacud.a ̄man.iis a coherent theological text frombeginning to end. We must also note, however, that there seem to be few pre-modern commentaries on this work; perhaps it was not deemed weighty enoughto deserve commentary?By contrast, Vimukta ̄tman’s Is.t.asiddhiis a formidable Advaita work whichtreats in great detail an entire range of epistemological and ontological matters,and even issues specific to the terminology of Veda ̄nta on Brahman, self, libera-tion, etc. While there is no strong reason to exclude the Is.t.asiddhithe title of atheological work, its strong interest in the logical and philosophical under-pinnings of theological concerns suggests that it too, like the Tattvacinta ̄man.i,might well be termed a philosophical treatise which addresses some theologicaltopics.38When we turn to a clearly theistic school of Veda ̄nta such as Ra ̄ma ̄nuja’s andVeda ̄nta Des ́ika’s Vis ́is.t.a ̄dvaita, it will be no surprise that many of its works caneasily be counted as theological. Commentaries, such as Ra ̄ma ̄nuja’s S ́rı ̄bha ̄s.yaandGı ̄ta ̄bha ̄s.yaare richly theological, and so too treatises such as hisVe d a ̄rthasam.graha, which expounds both right exegetical principles and rightontology in support of theistic Veda ̄nta. But even in regarding theistic Veda ̄ntait is illuminating to distinguish primary theological writings from those whichare either accessory or devotional. Ra ̄ma ̄nuja’s three more devotional writings,collected in the Gadya Traya, are best taken as intelligent devotional masterpiecesintended to inspire the community of believers. But I suggest that they are nottheological works, even if the S ́rı ̄vais.n.ava tradition has rightly found in them awealth of theological meaning.Veda ̄nta Des ́ika presents us with an array of works, some of which may meritthe title of “philosophy” or “philosophical theology,” some “devotional compo-sitions,” and some “theology.” For example, a work such as the Paramatabhan.gaaims at refuting the doctrines of other schools, as Des ́ika argues his views largelyon the basis of correct reasoning; this might be counted as philosophical orapologetic theology.More complicated is the case of the paired volumes, the Nya ̄ya Paris ́uddhiandtheNya ̄ya Siddha ̄ñjana. The Nya ̄ya Paris ́uddhioffers primarily philosophicalanalysis in support of theology; in it Des ́ika meticulously considers Nya ̄ya posi-tions and also corrects them wherever necessary. Throughout, his aim is toreview and clarify problematic and unclear aspects of the system of logic setforth in the Nya ̄ya Su ̄trasof Gautama. It seems clear that this is a corrective workwhich is preparatory for theology, and only indirectly theological itself. The cor-rective work of the Nya ̄ya Paris ́uddhiis complemented in the Nya ̄ya Siddha ̄ñjanarestoring “hindu theology” as a category467"},{"pageNumber":475,"pageContent":"which itself has a kind of philosophical focus in its concern for the objects ofknowledge: inert material reality; the individual dependent self; the lord; theeternal abode of the lord; understanding, constitutive knowledge; qualities asreal but not material elements. But here the emphasis is on the truth of the com-munity’s faith positions. If the Nya ̄ya Paris ́uddhiis preparatory to theology, theNya ̄ya Siddha ̄ñjana, its deeply logical and philosophical nature notwithstanding,is more explicitly a reasoned defense of faith positions and accordingly moreobviously theological.For the sake of argument I have stated that texts such as the Tattvacinta ̄man.i,Nı ̄titattva ̄virbha ̄va,Is.t.asiddhi, and Nya ̄ya Paris ́uddhiare not theological, on thegrounds that although important components of their subject matter are rec-ognizably theological, they stress logic and epistemology over against theologi-cal issues. Other texts can be denied the title of theology because they areprimarily religious, edifying, or inspirational texts in which religious reasoningis secondary. In this category we can place most ritual manuals and mostmythology – not because such are devoid of intellectual content, but becausethat content has not been explicitated in an arguable form conducive to manana.So too, various hymns of praise – Vedic hymns and later praise hymns (stotra) –which laud a supreme God or Goddess may be religiously rich and even provoca-tive of theological reflection, but in themselves they are primarily meant toinspire and deepen religious faith. Hindu India abounds in religious works whichpromote religious values in various ways but (unless one mentally transposesthem into more theoretical and prose discourses) without providing a sufficientspace for critical reflection on arguable themes.There are religious works which have great religious and intellectual powerbut nonetheless are best counted as not theological because they do not sys-tematize their intended meanings in ways that can be analyzed, debated, andargued. The Ra ̄ma ̄yan.a, for example, is a persuasive and vastly influential reli-gious narrative which manifests great religious intelligence, but in itself it doesnot give evidence of a critical distance which invites the believer to stand apartfrom the text and think aboutit. It may be that some Ra ̄ma ̄yan.acommentariesare more theological than the epic itself. The Maha ̄bha ̄ratasurely has sections ofgreat theological import in it – most notably the Bhagavad Gı ̄ta ̄– but it would beuselessly broad to claim that the whole of the epic is theological. The Gı ̄ta ̄itself,though perhaps inherently rich in theological meaning, is established as pro-perly theological only by its further specification through commentaries andsynthetic summations such as Ya ̄muna’s Gı ̄ta ̄rthasam.graha(eleventh century)and the commentaries of S ́am.kara and Ra ̄ma ̄nuja.If reasoned theistic texts may be judged more readily theological, we will want to scrutinize closely and possibly differently works about Goddesses whichoften expound comprehensive even if not entirely systematic Goddess theol-ogies. Perhaps gender is yet another issue affecting how theology works out.Some Goddess treatises are poetic, and perhaps deliberately dissimilar to “stan-dard” theological texts. For example, the S ́rı ̄vais.n.ava Gun.a Ratna Kos ́aofPara ̄s ́ara Bhat.t.ar (twelfth century) is a Sanskrit language text of 61 verses 468francis clooney, sj"},{"pageNumber":476,"pageContent":"in honor of the Goddess Laks.mı ̄. Though florid in its descriptions and not easily read as a treatise in Goddess theology, commentators find in it all the the-ological depth one might hope for in terms of spelling out the relationship ofLaks.mı ̄ and Vis.n.u. If not formally theological, it is certainly a rich resourcewhich encapsulates earlier reflection on Laks.mı ̄ and prepares for later theologi-cal reflection.In Tamil we find the Apira ̄mı ̄ Anta ̄ti(ca. eighteenth century), 100 verses inhonor of the Goddess Abhira ̄mi who is both a consort of S ́iva and a preeminentDeity by herself. The 100 verses are similar to those found in other Tamil devo-tional works, such as those of the a ̄l ̄va ̄rs and na ̄yan ̄ma ̄rs, and thus easily fall intothat category of poetic works which are deeply reflective on divinity. Whetherthey are profitably counted as theological is another matter; part of the answerhas to do with how much emphasis one places on critical reasoning and sys-tematic presentation, and how determined one is to dig deeper inside the decep-tively simple verses. For this chapter, however, I leave it an open question as towhether the Apira ̄mı ̄ Anta ̄tiought to be called theological.The Tamil-language drama Cilappatika ̄ram(ca. fifth century) is a striking work which can be appreciated for numerous insights of great theological in-terest. Though dramatic and poetic in form, it proposes an (ultimately Jaina)analysis of the individual, social, political, philosophical, and religious con-stituents of society, while offering a good deal of Goddess theology along the way. But here too, the form of the arguments does not invite further elaboration,and (to my knowledge) the drama has not received significant theologicalcommentary.Different problems are posed by a work such as Pa ̄n.ini’s As.t.a ̄dhya ̄yı ̄(fifthcentury bce) the normative Sanskrit grammatical treatise. We know thatGrammar is not merely a instrumental discipline, but one with great religiousimport. Earlier, we saw Abhyankar’s comment that Grammar, like Mı ̄ma ̄m.sa ̄ andVeda ̄nta, is a scriptural system of thought (s ́a ̄striya dars ́ana), due to its commit-ment to the words of the Veda. But Abhyankar seems to have been thinkingmainly of Bhartr.hari and other such grammarians who made explicit their “the-ologies of language,” e.g., in relation to Brahman as sound (s ́abda brahman).Such commitments and understandings can be taken as signifying Grammar as“theological.” But in terms of the actual content of Pa ̄n.ini’s Grammar, though,we might also be inclined either to exclude the work or to relegate it to an import-ant but ancillary role.So too, even some systematic religious texts present religious truths in waysthat are evidently deeply intellectual and reasoned with scriptural roots, butwithout presenting them as arguable conclusions open to the kind of argumentthat characterizes theology. For example, The Laws of Manugives evidence of akind of juridical theological intent, as it reorganizes earlier legal materials,schematizing them according to the idealization of society according to class andstage of life, and then imbedding the whole in an account of the origins of theworld as a natural, social, and religious reality. Manuthus reorganizes earlierreligious and legal debates in a way that could well be taken as theological yet,restoring “hindu theology” as a category469"},{"pageNumber":477,"pageContent":"since it also presents its arguments in a way that appears final and intended topreclude further debate, perhaps it strives to be a post-theological text.As noted above, though, decisions about which texts are theological or notare ultimately more than descriptive claims about past learning and writing; atan important level, such theological judgments must be made within a com-munity of Hindu theologians willing to take up the task today.Some Final ReflectionsI do not suppose that all readers will be persuaded by the complex case made infavor of “Hindu theology” in the preceding pages, but I do hope that they willgive a serious hearing to my case. Nor would one have to accept every argumentor definition proposed in order to agree that “theology” is a viable and usefulterm in the Indian context. The acceptance even of various portions of my argu-ments should suffice: certain topics and themes are justly termed “theological”;manana, which reflects on verbal knowledge but has its finality in meditation, isjustly termed “theological reasoning”; the presence of commentary and, in mostcases, a Sanskrit language discourse, can confirm that a religious text is also atheological text; communities which accept the project of faith in tension withreasoning will value theology; and so on.For now, my approach should at least alleviate some of the misapprehensionsabout theology which arose in the earlier history of Europe and which haveinfluenced Indian thinking about theology. With the ground cleared, we shouldbe able to consider with some objectivity the claim that better than any otherterm “theology” names in English what many important Hindu thinkers havedone and are doing. In turn, the admission of this term opens more fruitful waysof understanding traditional Hindu thinking, and stimulates an exchange ofideas between India, still coming to terms with its own theological and non-theological heritage, and the contemporary scholarly world.I close then with two observations. First, I claimed at the beginning of thischapter that it was not my task to explain the word “Hindu.” This is of coursean admittedly difficult task in light of the contemporary consensus that it maybe misleading to apply “Hinduism” to how people believe, think, speak, and actreligiously in India; historians, social scientists, and Indologists have all in their own way determined that “Hindu” and “Hinduism” refer to nothing sub-stantial or particular, and they have often concluded that the words ought notbe used at all. However, without disregarding the historical and religious factorswhich make caution imperative, I suggest that it may be from a newly rejuve-nated appreciation of “theology” that “Hindu” can be reestablished – as a plau-sible, arguable, and useful theological category with which one can usefullybegin to understand the predominate Indian religious ways of believing andpracticing.470francis clooney, sj"},{"pageNumber":478,"pageContent":"Second, as conceded above, I admit that since we are speaking ofHinduthe-ology and not just theology, the final test must occur in a communal context,among thinkers who are willing to identify themselves as both “Hindus” and“theologians.” If this chapter has been properly dedicated to a retrospective con-sideration of where “theology” may be appropriately found in the Hindu tradi-tions, it will still matter, and matter more, to discern the present and future ofHindu theologizing by listening to those willing to think through the Hindufaith(s) in a way that is intelligible in the contemporary, global conversation ofbelievers and scholars interested in religion.Notes1It is not part of the task of this chapter to explain or defend usage of the word“Hindu,” but see my comment at the conclusion of the chapter on the rehabilita-tion of “Hindu” as a theological term.2See Dictionnaire de Théologie Catholique, vol. 15.1, cols. 342–6.3See Wilhelm Halbfass, India and Europe(Albany: State University of New York Press,1988), particularly “On the Exclusion of India from the History of Philosophy,” pp.145–9.4Over 40 years ago Richard DeSmet surveyed the Indian antipathy toward “theol-ogy.” He showed how in the twentieth century it became commonplace to see “the-ological” as equivalent to “burdened with dogmatic commitments” or “deficient inrational excellence.” Even religious thinkers like S ́am.kara were best defended bydeclaring, as did S. Radhakrishnan, that “the austere intellectualism of [S ́am.kara’s]system, its remorseless logic, which marches on indifferent to the hopes and beliefsof man, make it a great example of a purely philosophicalsystem” (Richard DeSmet,unpublished dissertation, “The Theological Method of S ́am.kara,” GregorianUniversity, Rome, 1955, p. 8; my emphasis). DeSmet’s thesis will be published in2004 by the University of Notre Dame Press.5One also needs to be able to find one’s way back and forth between the terminologyof Sanskrit (and other Indian) languages and English (and other contemporaryWestern and global) languages. This is not an endeavor for those who think that noterm in English can ever suitably represent a term from the Sanskrit language. Whilewe concede from the start that no single term from an Indian language can trans-late “theology,” we need not be limited to the strictures of literal or one-to-one trans-latability, and we need to resist the temptation to exclude all English-language termsas inappropriate to the interpretation of Sanskrit discourses. As a model for the kindof distinctions we need to make, we can recall Wilhelm Halbfass’s useful sorting outof questions related to whether Hindu thought can be treated as “philosophy.” Hisanalysis combined philological interest in the uses of terms like dars ́ana(perhaps:viewpoint, worldview), mata(opinion, school of thought), and anviks.ikı ̄andmı ̄ma ̄m.sa ̄(analysis, inquiry), with a sense of the larger comparative issues whichcome into play when one affirms or denies that certain strands of Indian thoughtshould be acknowledged as philosophical.

I do not attempt a broad survey ofpositions, but neither do I wish to suggest that theology is limited to the schools ofthought highlighted in my examples.7Naming something “theological” will be no more insulting or problematic thanother labels which one might apply to the intellectual systems found in culturesother than their own. Rather, it is useful to use the term “theology” and not just“religion,” “philosophy,” or “indology,” when attempting to understand Hinduthought by correlating it with Western counterparts.8Albany: State University of New York Press, 1998. Cabezon highlights severalimportant features which distinguish scholasticism, distinctions which can just aswell apply to theology: a strong sense oftradition, which includes the handing downof the texts which define the community; proliferativity, “the tendency to textualand analytic inclusivity rather than exclusivity”; rationalism, “the commitment toreasoned argument and noncontradiction”; completenessalong with compactness(nothing missing, nothing extraneous); systematicity(the endeavor to reproduce inwriting “the basic orderliness found in the world”); and self-reflexivity(“the ten-dency to objectify and to critically analyze first order practices”). Since “scholasti-cism” has been closely aligned with “theology” in the West, the same features canapply in a theological context as well. Cabezon’s comment on the comparativeinquiry underlying Scholasticismcould just as well be adapted to our inquiry into“Hindu theology” in this chapter: “Though I see no value in – or need for – an a prioridefinition of scholasticism preceding comparative work on the subject, I dorecognize that as a result of such work there may emerge a series of traits that willbe considered more characteristic of scholasticism than others. They will becomeso not by virtue of being part of the innate character of scholasticism – its essence– but because the traditions that have most benefited from being considered underthe rubric of this category have these as theirtraits...a texture is given to the cat-egory by the fact that certain traits will be more prominent than others, and this asa result of the fact that certain traditions will be considered more prototypicallyscholastic than others. If scholasticism is a useful category...then, like other suchcategories (religion, myth, symbol, scripture, ritual), it will survive and evolve in thisway over time” (p. 8).9Transzendenzerfahrung, Vollzugshorizont des Heils(Vienna: Publications of the DeNobili Research Library, vol. 5, 1978), Epiphanie des Heils: zur Heilsgegenwart inIndischer und Christlicher Religion(Vienna: Publications of the De Nobili ResearchLibrary, vol. 9, 1982), Versuch einer transzendentalen Hermeneutik religiöser Traditio-nen(Vienna: Publications of the De Nobili Research Library, Occasional Papers 3,1987), and “Begegnung” als Kategorie der Religionshermeneutik(Vienna: Publicationsof the De Nobili Research Library, Occasional Papers 4, 1989), Raum-zeitliche Vermittlung der Transzendenz: Zur “sakramentalen” Dimension religiöser Tradition(Vienna: Verlag der Österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, 1999).10See also my Hindu God, Christian God: How Reason Helps Break Down the Boundariesamong Religions(New York: Oxford University Press, 2001) in which I show thecommon theological ground of mainstream Christian and Hindu theologies on thethemes of God’s existence, the true religion, divine embodiment, and the judgmentof revelation upon religion.472francis clooney, sj"},{"pageNumber":480,"pageContent":"11Albany: State University of New York, 1997.12Richmond, UK: Curzon Press, 2000.13In what follows, I refer to Sanskrit-language and (to some limited extent) Tamil-language sources; of course, other language traditions of India can also be drawnupon in this regard.14While God or gods can be theology’s central topic, this rule can bear exceptions. Too rigid and exclusive a link between “God” and “theology” might unneces-sarily exclude schools of Hindu thought which on other grounds might seem tomerit the title “theological,” e.g., Mı ̄ma ̄m.sa ̄ ritual theory and nondualist Veda ̄ nta.One might still term a system theological if some other comprehensive explanatoryreferent is put forward, such as a transcendent Self (a ̄tman), or a higher realitywhich is the source of the world as a whole and yet also the pervasive life-forcewithin it (brahman), or an apprehension of the world in all its interconnected parts(dharma).15See Johannes Bronkhorst, “God’s Arrival in the Vais ́es.ika System,” Journal of IndianPhilosophy24 (1996): 281–394, and George Chemparathy, An Indian Rational Theo-logy: Introduction to Udayana’s Nya ̄yakusuma ̄ñjali, p. 78.

See Gerow, “What is Karma(Kim.Karmeti)? An Exercise in PhilosophicalSemantics,”Indologica Taurinensia10 (1982): 87–116. Gerow argues that thetraditional Indian philosophical understanding ofkarma– as action, as deedsleading to rebirth – bears a significance largely inseparable from the semantics ofthe Sanskrit language; the conceptual issues related to human acting and thenature of agency are more simply understood if we interpret them in terms of howaction is understood grammatically. Gerow certainly would not assert that belief inkarmaas rebirth is only a consequence of Sanskrit syntax, but the logic of the caseforkarma, and the very significance ofkarma, are explicable most directly in termsof the dynamics of the Sanskrit language.29To admit the real but somewhat rare possibility of a non-Sanskrit language Hindutheology, let us consider just Tiruva ̄ymol ̄i. This work of 1,102 verses can, fromvarious perspectives, be considered diffuse and unsystematic, rich in myriad themesand images which are simply juxtaposed. Although it is tightly bound by the strat-egy of having each verse begin with the word or phrase which ended the previousverse (the strategy ofanta ̄ti), it may still seem nothing but a canonical anthology.Yet as I have explained elsewhere (see Francis X.

They existedin Vedic times and are still widely used today. They permeate Hindu ritual. Asthe saying goes, amantraka kriya ̄ na sya ̄t, “no rites should be accomplishedwithout mantras,” and ritual was and still very largely is part of the daily life ofall observant Hindus. The term mantra, however, having been in use for somethree millennia all over south Asia, has not always and everywhere had the samemeaning. Mantras were used in different ways, in different contexts, and for dif-ferent purposes: the meaning of the term, like that of all words, is context-dependent. It is therefore necessary to examine separately the various meanings,uses, and values attached to it in the course of time in different Hindu religioustraditions. Not only has the meaning of the term mantra varied according totime and place, but at any given time the word has been used to refer to differ-ent ritual, meditative, yogic, and spiritual practices as well as to different formsor kinds of phonetic and linguistic utterance. It is therefore impossible to trans-late it by a single word in English or any other modern language. Several suchtranslations have been suggested; none is satisfactory. But we need not dwell on them, since the term mantra is now in common use. It is to be found indictionaries and needs no translation.As regards the term itself, the Sanskrit noun mantraderives from the verbalrootMAN, which means to think, but in the sense of an intentional, active formof thought. To this root is added the suffix tra, which is used to form words denot-ing an instrument, a faculty, or a function. A mantra, therefore, is etymol-ogically a means or an instrument of thought, this thought being intense, concentrated, efficient: all traits variously to be found, as we shall see, in everyform and use of mantras, ancient or modern. Later, and especially in the Tantrictheory of mantra, the mantras ́a ̄stra, the suffix trawas related to the verbal rootTRAI, to save, mantras being therefore seen as a form of thought leading to salvation. Thus the Tantric philosopher Abhinavagupta (tenth to eleventh"},{"pageNumber":486,"pageContent":"centuries) said that mantras are mananatra ̄n.aru ̄pa, thought and salvation, thatis, a liberating form of thought. We should perhaps add here that the languageof mantras is normally Sanskrit. They are formed from Sanskrit words orsyllables, which is logical enough since they are regarded as forms of the powerofva ̄c, the primordial Word uttered in the sacred Sanskrit language. In Tantricpractice, however, there are exceptions to this rule, especially in recent times.Mantras in VedismIn the Vedas, the noun mantra refers to the metrical texts collected in theSam.hitas that are recited, muttered, or chanted during Vedic sacrifices, be theyr.c,yajus, or sa ̄man, that is, hymns or poems, sacrificial formulas, or chants. Allthat is not bra ̄hmana(rule or explanation) is mantra; and mantras, in Vedic reli-gion, are the essential element of ritual performance, however complex in itsprocedure and mise en scènethat performance may be. They are considered asinstrumental in the accomplishment of sacrificial acts: they are what causes andeffects the efficiency of the sacrifice.The word mantra appears thus in Vedism as referring to something different,at least in its verbal form – poems, hymns, chants – from what it referred to lateron, but even in those early times some permanent mantric traits were present.First, mantras constitute the essential and efficient element in all ritual. More-over, brief ritual formulas such as sva ̄ha ̄(the exclamation used when making anoblation to the gods) were also regarded as mantras, and the three utterancescalledvya ̄hr.ti(bhu ̄h.,bhuvah.,svah.) referring to the earth, the intermediate space,and the sky, chanted during Vedic ritual, were believed to be invested with thecreative power of the primordial Word. Vedic chant also included meaninglesssyllables called stobha, such as ha ̄,bhu,phat., while in the Yajurveda other sylla-bles of that sort (hı ̄m,hum,vet. . .) were used, to one of which, om., was attrib-uted a particular and exalted position, which it has kept down to our days, asthe very essence of all that exists. Vedism thus shows the origin of aspects ofmantras which will be developed in the tantric mantras ́a ̄stra. The famous ga ̄yatrı ̄,the invocation of Savitar, the Sun, a particularly sacred formula which was laterused as a mantra (sometimes with sectarian variants dedicated to other deities)is also originally Vedic, since it is verse 10 of hymn 3.62 of the R.gveda. In fact,as formulas or utterances imbued with power and believed to be of supernaturalorigin, mantras have inherited and carried down to the present the Vedic con-ception ofva ̄c, the Word, seen as the supreme power, placed above everythingelse, identified with the brahman, the Absolute. But it is an absolute which is alsothe sacred formula: from earliest times, godhead has been seen both as powerand as sacred word.The Vedic solemn sacrificial rites have all but entirely disappeared in India.When they do endure, it is as a kind of archaeological reconstruction of the past,or as an artificial, domesticated form of return to some mythical origin. Certainmantra479"},{"pageNumber":487,"pageContent":"ancient Vedic notions and rites, however, have survived as elements, sometimesvery vital ones, of Pura ̄n.ic, then Tantric, and even modern Hinduism: andamong these, in particular, are the Vedic notions and speculations on the divinenature and power of the Word, especially in its mantric aspect.1Mantras havenever ceased to be regarded as of divine origin and nature, as endowed withsupernatural powers, and as ritually effective for evoking deities or for puttingtheir user in touch with a deity or even identifying him/her with the deity.Mantras may be generally described as sentences, words, or syllables of super-human origin, eternal, used to evoke deities or supernatural powers and also toput in touch or identify their users with these deities or powers. They are thoughtof as able, when uttered according to certain precise rules, to realize the inten-tional thought they embody and/or to accomplish different tasks or actions.These characteristics are variously emphasized in different rituals and at differ-ent times. The function of praising a deity or beseeching it to accept or be pleasedwith the gifts or oblations offered is stressed in Vedism, whereas that of evoca-tion or identification, or of accomplishing some religious or magic task, is moreprominent in the Paura ̄n.ic and still more in the Tantric context. Whatever the period, however, an essential trait of mantras is and has always been thattheir nature is that of the uttered, the spoken, or rather the speaking word (va ̄c vadantı ̄), transmitted orally, not in writing.2Even when they are poems orhymns, they are not Scripture.Descriptions of the yogic meditative uses of mantras, mysticolinguistic specu-lations on their nature, phonetic structure, symbolic values and powers are tobe found in the older (“Vedic”) Upanis.ads and in the Bra ̄hman.as.3For instance,in the Jaiminı ̄ya Upanis.ad Bra ̄hman.a, the god Praja ̄pati creates the sky, the inter-mediate space, and the earth by means of the three vya ̄hr.tis,bhuh.bhuvah.svah.,the essence of his speech being OM.. The Cha ̄ndogya Upanis.ad tells the samemythic tale and adds “the sound OM.is the whole universe.” “OM.isBrahman,”says the Taittirı ̄ya Upanis.ad. The divine nature and power of the mantra OM.isextolled in other older Upanis.ads, too: this extolling ofOM.as condensing andencapsulating in one syllable the totality of the Vedas (i.e., knowledge) is inter-esting in that it shows that, from Vedic times, brief, condensed utterances havebeen given primacy over extended, discursive ones, a concept to be found laterin the tantricbı ̄jamantras.Vedic sources also show the breaking up ofOM.intoits constituent phonemes, A,O,M., which are then correlated with differenttriads: the three Vedas, three parts of the cosmos, three vital breaths, and soforth, a trait later to be found in the tantric mantras ́a ̄stra. Also worth mention-ing here is the Maitrı ̄ Upanis.ad (one of the latest of the ancient Upanis.ads),which says that OM.is the essence of everything in the human heart, that meditation on Brahman rests eternally upon it, and that when stirred up it risesto the throat as an atom of sound, then reaches the tip of the tongue, finallyflowing out as speech. The person who sees all this, the Upanis.ad adds, sees onlythe Absolute and is freed from death and suffering: this mental and bodilyprocess does not differ much from later tantric mantrayoga practices. The originof such anthropocosmic concepts, as well as that of a number of other mantric480andré padoux"},{"pageNumber":488,"pageContent":"notions and practices, can thus be traced back to Vedic times. The idea, too, thatthe whispered (upa ̄m.s ́u) or inaudible utterance of a mantra is superior to, andmore effective than, its audible one, the silent (tus.n.ı ̄m) one being the highest ofall, dates from the Vedic period. For the S ́atapathabra ̄h.man.a, the silent or indis-tinct (anirukta) speech is the highest one of all, since it represents the unlimited.Ritual speech, says the same text, must be silent, “since seed (retas) is castsilently.” Another theme which continued to be discussed in later times is thequestion of the meaning or meaninglessness (a ̄narthakya) of mantras. It was firsttaken up in the Nirukta, their meaninglessness being upheld by the grammar-ian Kautsa, according to whom mantras are uttered simply for the utterance’ssake – ucca ̄ran.ama ̄tren.a; the question being less whether they themselves meananything than whether they are uttered to express a meaning which they have,or, on the contrary, do not contain. The issue is still relevant, for while somemantras are evidently meaningless, they all have, as ever, a ritual function or amagical efficacy.Mantras after the VedasThe Vedic mantra needed to be considered first, not only because it came firsthistorically, but also because in the Vedas the term mantra had the special, widermeaning of hymn or chant. Also because, as we have seen, some general anddurable mantric characteristics appeared in those early times. The Vedic period,however, cannot be separated from the one that follows. There never was a dis-continuity: Vedic mantras, as well as some Vedic rites, never ceased to be in use,since orthodox Hinduism has always regarded itself as ”Vedic.” While Vedichymns and chants recited during solemn Vedic rites tended to fall into disuse,other mantras of Vedic origin went on being used in the worship of deities andin various public or private, daily, or calendrical rituals, and still more in the life-cycle rites, the sam.ska ̄ras, which consisted mainly in the utterance (and/or transmission) of mantras and which ranged from the rite performed to ensureconception to those carried out after death. Every morning all twice-born maleHindus went on (and are still supposed to go on) reciting the sacred ga ̄yatrı ̄(alsocalledsavitrı ̄), from R.gveda 3.62 (tat savitur varen.yam bhargo devasya dhı ̄mahidhiyo yo nah.pracodaya ̄t), preceded by OM.and the three vya ̄hr.tis,bhurahbhuvah.svah.. Practically all the daily activities (as well as the exercise of bodily functions)of the pious Hindu (or at least of the observant brahmin) were to be accompa-nied, preceded, or followed by the utterance of mantras, mostly Vedic ones.However, as cults other than the S ́rauta and Sma ̄rta Vedic cults4developed, othermantras appeared. In these new systems, which tended henceforth to replacethe Vedic religion and which are called Paura ̄n.ic since their textual theologicaland mythical basis was the vast literature of the Pura ̄n.as, other mantras wereadded to or displaced the Vedic ones – even though some traditions, the Vais.n.avaones especially, went on using S ́rauta mantras to enhance their claim to mantra481"},{"pageNumber":489,"pageContent":"brahmanic orthodoxy. These paura ̄n.ic mantras – “Vedic” in the sense that theywere not Tantric – were used in the liturgy rather than to obtain supernaturalrewards. They usually consisted in the name of the deity or of the supernaturalentity being invoked or worshipped, in the dative case, preceded by OM.and fol-lowed by the ancient liturgical formula namah., meaning hail or obedience to, orby sva ̄ha ̄, the exclamation used in making oblations. For instance, S ́iva’s mantraisOM.S ́IVA ̄YA NAMAH., or OM.NAMAH.S ́IVA ̄YA.It is often said that deities are to be worshipped with their own special mantra,tattatmantren.a. Whatever the cult, be it the thrice-daily invocation prayer, thesandhya, or the ritual devotional worship, the pu ̄ja ̄, the rite always consists in theutterance (ucca ̄ra) or repetition (japa) of mantras, each of which plays an effec-tive, operative role in the ritual process, the outwardly visible actions of the offi-ciant accompanying, confirming the action of the mantras rather than beingthemselves effective. The importance of the mantras even in the nontantric pu ̄ja ̄,is also underlined by the fact that the worship of a deity normally ends with ajapa, the recitation of that deity’s mantra. We may note here that the mantra ofa deity is not the same thing as that deity’s name. But since Vedic times lists ofnames of deities have existed, the recitation of which was prescribed and con-sidered as ritually efficacious or as salvific. The S ́atarudrı ̄ya, The Thousand[names] of Rudra, of the Yajurveda (4.5), is one of the oldest of these lists. Hinduism proposes a large number ofna ̄mastotra, hymns of praise to the Name,orsahasrana ̄ma, Thousand Names of deities, and there are cases where the nameor names of a deity is/are to be uttered like, and with the same expected effectsas, a mantra.5The S ́ivapura ̄n.a, for instance, contains a list of a thousand namesof S ́iva and enumerates the benefits resulting from its recitation. It also pre-scribes the recitation of “multiple na ̄mamantras,” one of which consists of eightnames of S ́iva preceded by s ́rı ̄.For this Pura ̄n.a, however, the supreme mantra isOM., from which, this text says, all the Vedas were born. The devotional use ofsuchstotra,stuti, or stava(or nowadays ofkirtanorbhajan, devotional singing ofdivine names) is and has certainly always been very widespread. This practice isnot to be confused with the japaof mantras, though it too rests on the convic-tion that certain sacred words have a salvific power.In theory, Vedic mantras cannot be used by, or for, others than male membersof the three “twice-born” (dvija) classes, a very small minority of Hindus. Hencethe importance of non-Vedic mantras, which are all the more important becausethey are the majority of those used in all sectarian cults – that is, S ́aiva, Vais.n.ava,and “S ́a ̄kta,” domestic or public (temple) cults; in other words, the rites performed, or attended by, almost the whole Hindu community for the last thousand years of Indian history. In the ritual performed in such temples (whosepriests are normally brahmins, though the rites are either Tantric or tantricized),both Vedic and non-Vedic (often Tantric) mantras are used. Hindu-Tantricmantras did not follow Vedic-Brahmanic ones chronologically. Nor are they twoentirely separate sets of ritual formulas: the two categories co-exist, and some-times overlap.6Characteristic from this point of view are the sectarian forms ofthe Vedic ga ̄yatrı ̄, where the name of the Sun, Savitar, is replaced by that of482andré padoux"},{"pageNumber":490,"pageContent":"another deity, and sometimes the wording (but not the meter7) is modified so asto fit the deity invoked or the aim pursued.Regarding mantras in a non-Tantric context, we cannot overlook theYo ga s u ̄ tras of Patañjali, (1.27, 28) which say “The [term] expressing Him (thatis, I ̄s ́vara, the Lord) is the pran.ava” (tasya va ̄cakah.pran.avah.), and “[One should]repeat and meditate intensely its meaning” (tajjapah.tadarthabha ̄vanam). TheYo ga s u ̄ tras thus emphasize two essential aspects of mantra and mantric prac-tice. On the one hand, that the mantra is the va ̄caka, i.e. that which “expresses”the deity, that which brings about its presence for the utterer. The deity being “to be expressed” (va ̄cya) by the mantra tends therefore, in the context of theIndian conception of the power of the Word, to be considered as ontologicallysecondary to it – a notion which was to be expatiated upon in the Tantricmantras ́a ̄stra. Then, for the mantra to carry out its functions, it must be repeatedand intensely meditated. The repetition (japa) of mantras and their intense med-itation (bha ̄vana8) remain to this day two essential elements of mantric practice.The meditation of mantras is also designated by the more general term dhya ̄na,sometimes associated withjapa, repetition, in the compound japadhya ̄nam. Inthis case, it is the continuous flow of thought applied to the mantra beingrepeated that is emphasized rather than the intensity of concentration, as isnormal in practices whose aim is devotional rather than magical. The Pa ̄s ́upatas,who were pre-Tantric S ́aivas, prescribed, too, a meditative muttering of mantras(japa), but mainly so as to purify the soul of the worshipper and fix his attention.Characteristically, the five brahmamantras (Aghora, Sadyoja ̄ta, etc.) used by thePa ̄s ́upata ascetics were called “the five purifiers” (pañcapavitra ̄n.i), a role ofmantras also mentioned by Vya ̄sa in his commentary on the Yogasu ̄ tras. For thePa ̄s ́upatas, however, the essential function of mantras was to obtain union withthe Lord (ı ̄s ́varasam.yoga).But mantras were considered efficacious and necessary in all aspects, religious and secular, of life in post-Vedic times. The Maha ̄bha ̄rata alludes totheir power. The images of deities were ritually established, that is, infused with the being of the deity, with mantras. Mantras were also recited whentemples were built. The Arthas ́a ̄stra says that sowing is to be accompanied by the uttering of appropriate mantras. From ancient times, mantras were used for medical and magical purposes. The A ̄yurveda prescribes the use ofamulets inscribed with mantras to protect children from illnesses caused bydemons. Mantras were used also in veterinary medicine: the Hatya ̄yurveda, atreatise on illnesses of elephants, said that no remedy should be used unless itwas consecrated with mantras. Mantras were also used in the administration ofthe state, not only to propitiate the deity that protects the kingdom but also toincrease the wealth and power of the king, to support his armies in battle, andso forth. A minister, in Sanskrit, is called mantrin, not only as a counsellor (rootMANTR) to the king, but also as being able to use mantras for political ends.Such uses are, in fact, more tantric than s ́rautaorsma ̄rta. But many examplesof the uses of mantras in all walks of life in non-Tantric contexts could easily bequoted.mantra483"},{"pageNumber":491,"pageContent":"Tantric Mantras and the Mantras ́a ̄ straHowever important the notion and uses of mantras may have been from earlytimes, it was only with the development within Hinduism of Tantric notions andpractices that mantras really pervaded all types of religious, ritual, and magicalaction. Speculations on the subject thrived, and innumerable treatises, digests,or ritual manuals were written, dealing with their nature and uses and extollingtheir power. Tantric and mantric practices and notions were so interwoven thatmantras ́a ̄stra, the science or doctrine of mantras, was not only looked on as themost important portion of Tantric teaching, but it was also identified with it, theterms mantras ́a ̄straandtantras ́a ̄straoften being taken as synonymous. An earlyform of Tantric S ́aivism was named mantramargaand a traditional division ofS ́aiva tantras is between those of the mantrapı ̄t.haand those of the vidya ̄pı ̄t.ha(vidya ̄sbeing female mantras). All tantric texts deal either entirely or in part withmantras. The extent of this literature (noteworthy, though not always interest-ing and often repetitive) is enormous. It includes all the basic Hindu sectarianworks: the tantras, a ̄gamas, sam.hita ̄s, philosophico-religious texts of all persua-sions, hymns, eulogies (stotra), lists of divine names, and so forth, whether S ́aivaor Vais.n.ava – and this literature went on being added to down to our own days.Even texts of the s ́rutisuch as certain upanis.ads came also to include tantricmantras.9These were also to be found in a number of Pura ̄n.as (the Agnipura ̄n.a,for instance, is a rich repertoire ofmantras ́a ̄stra), and even in some dharmas ́a ̄stratexts. And so forth.Tantric developments, however, did not obliterate earlier practices. Tantrictexts and practices went on prescribing and using s ́rautaorsma ̄rtamantras. Formally, too, the Tantric mantras did not always differ very much fromnontantric ones. Their most noteworthy development lay in the increased use ofnonlinguistic elements, that is, syllables or groups of syllables devoid of meaningbut deemed to be imbued with power and efficacy. Either one or several suchsyllables were added to the initial OM.of the mantra, or before the final ritualexclamation, the ja ̄ti:namah.,sva ̄ha ̄, etc. (OM.HAUM.S ́IVA ̄YA NAMAH., forinstance), or else the whole mantra was made up of one such meaninglesssyllable, or of several either enumerated separately or grouped together. Such,for instance, is the mantra SAUH.10of Para ̄, the supreme goddess of the Trika, orthe mantra of the goddess Tripurasundarı ̄, consisting of 15 syllables: HA SA KALA HRI ̄M.,HA SA KA HA LA HRI ̄M.,SA KA LA HRI ̄M., or the Nava ̄tmamantraHSKS.MLRVYU ̄M..The use of such syllables or groups of syllables as elements of mantras or asmantras was justified by the fact that they are made up of Sanskrit phonemesand therefore of forms of the power ofva ̄c, the Word originally spoken in thesacred Sanskrit language. A well-known Tantric saying runs: “All mantras aremade up of phonemes, the nature of all phonemes being that of S ́iva” (mantra ̄h.varn.a ̄tmaka ̄h.sarve,varn.a ̄h.sarve s ́iva ̄tmaka ̄h.). As we have seen, the privilege ofbrief and esoteric utterances over discursive ones goes back to Vedic times. The484andré padoux"},{"pageNumber":492,"pageContent":"idea was also sometimes expressed in this connection that inarticulate soundsor ungrammatrical Sanskrit (or Pra ̄krit) forms, being farther from the norm ofarticulate rule-governed speech, were nearer to the Absolute. The notion thatmantras are in essence made ofna ̄da, the primeval subtle phonic vibration whichis the substrate of verbal enunciations, was also founded on the idea of the par-ticular power and nearness to the godhead of prelinguistic utterances. The bindu(theanusva ̄ra,m., the nasal phonetic element shown in writing as a dot) whichends most bı ̄jas, was also the subject of similar developments, being considered– because it is inarticulate and written as a mere dot – as a concentrated formof phonic energy both symbolizing the supreme level of the godhead and encap-sulating the total power ofva ̄c.Differently, but in the same spirit, OM.was oftenconsidered as divisible into its constituent phonemes, A,U,M, followed by binduwhose subtle sound was conceived as prolonged by eight other ever-subtler formsof inaudible phonic vibration until it dissolved into the utter silence of theAbsolute, a plane which is also that of the highest, “transmental” (unmana ̄), con-sciousness. Silence was always held in higher esteem than uttered word oraudible sound. As we have seen, this also goes back to vedism, where mantrasare often used silently. We have also seen that the distinction between three different ways of uttering mantras was Vedic. In the tantras these three ways are usually described as “voiced” (va ̄cika), “made in secret” (upa ̄m.s ́u), that is, pro-nounced so as not to be overheard, and “mental” (ma ̄nasa), each form being (asin Manu 2.85) higher, but also more effective than the preceding one. Thoughthis distinction may seem in a way to invalidate the equally stringent rule pre-scribing the absolutely exact pronunciation of mantras, it remains valid to thisday.As has perhaps been apparent in the above, Hindus have always tended to mixup theological, mystico-metaphysical, yogic, and ritual speculation, hence the(for us) ambiguous and unclear nature of mantras. These hymns or formulasoriginally used for sacrificing to the gods not only came to be used in all sorts ofrites or actions, but they were also given metaphysical characteristics and more-over were put to both ritual and meditative use by means of the somato-psychicpractices of yoga. Tantric texts very often do not distinguish between differentforms or aspects of mantras and mantric practice. In different texts, or in differ-ent places of the same text, mantras are viewed, defined, or made use of differ-ently: as mere ritual (but powerful, efficacious) formulas, as esoteric forms of thedivine Word, or as the essence of deities, as what brings them into being and/ormakes them present in their icons, or even as being themselves deities. Thesevarying conceptions of their nature and role were often used differently, but sometimes also without apparently distinguishing between them. This appears,for instance, in the opposing conceptions of mantras to be seen in, on the onehand, the dualist S ́aiva a ̄gamas, where mantras are often called an.u(which means minute, atomic, and, in these texts, soul), and as such are considered asindividualized powers, and are therefore made use of as discrete, quasi concrete,elements to be employed ritually (and/or yogically); and, on the other hand, in the nondualist S ́aiva traditions (and especially in the Kashmirian Trika mantra485"},{"pageNumber":493,"pageContent":"philosophical treatises), where mantras are considered as being, at least inessence, pure forms of the absolute power ofva ̄cor of the supreme Conscious-ness, powers used ritually and yogically too, but also and more essentially so asto unite the consciousness of their user with the supreme divine Consciousness.When one looks, as we shall (very briefly) do, at the various mantric practicesused from comparatively early times down to our days in Tantric or tantricizedrites or cults, one finds stressed and made use of, according to circumstance,either the first or the second of these two concepts, but also sometimes both, asfor instance when a mantra is conceived of as an aspect of the absolute divineConsciousness, or as a deity, yet is nevertheless used as a ritually manipulableentity, or is imagined and visualized by an adept as circulating in the subtlecenters and canals of his body during a yogic mental-cum-bodily practice. Thedual nature of mantras and of their functions is underscored for instance in the Spandaka ̄rika ̄, a S ́aiva Kashmirian text of the ninth century, which says thatthough they are the very Absolute, mantras act like ordinary living beings, thatis, they perform all sorts of actions, but they also liberate their user, whose mindis united with them and whom they eventually cause to fuse with the supremegodhead. We may note here, too, that mantras are also considered as constitut-ing a particular category of supernatural entities. This is the case notably inS ́aiva texts, which consider that there are seven forms or levels of consciousness,calledprama ̄tr., “knowers,” the highest of which is S ́iva, after whom come the“Great lords of mantras” (Mantramahes ́vara), then the “Lords of mantras”(Mantres ́vara), then the 70 million mantras, followed by three other levels downto ordinary human beings. This is worth mentioning since it places mantras(and their “Lords”) in a hierarchy of individual entities, rather than on a par-ticular level, or as particular forms, of the Word – though, of course, these dif-ferent mantric entities are deemed to exist on the three different levels ofva ̄cknown to the philosophy of grammar – for va ̄cis the ever-present substrate ofall that exists. We must also remember – nor did the Indians forget – thatmantras, whatever their nature, must be spoken or somehow uttered when used,and that they therefore have also an empirical physical existence: mantras asaudible or inaudible sounds articulated by the organs of phonation are some-times distinguished from mantras as powers.All deities, supernatural entities, and so forth, have a mantra which is theirva ̄caka, “that which expresses” them, the deity or entity being “what is to beexpressed” (va ̄cya), a conception which (see above) definitely subordinates thedeity as an entity to its mantra. All deities have a mu ̄lamantra(ormu ̄lavidya ̄ifthey are feminine), a basic or root mantra which, according to some sources, isthe substrate of all the mantras of that deity, for there are mantras corres-ponding to the different forms, aspects, or constitutive elements of deities. Suchare, for instance, the five brahmamantrasof the five faces or mouths (vaktra) ofS ́iva, whence all S ́aiva Scriptures are deemed to have issued, or the an.gamantras,the ancillary mantras of the “limbs” of S ́iva or of Vis.n.u. The “weapons” (a ̄yudha)or attributes of the deities also have their mantras. All these mantras are usedto invoke the deities or entities concerned and/or to install them ritually in the486andré padoux"},{"pageNumber":494,"pageContent":"icon, yantra, or whatever support they are to be worshipped on or made use of for some purpose. (This empowerment of the icon by mantras is absolutelynecessary: without it the icon would be void of any divine element and there-fore useless.) Deities to be worshipped have also a mu ̄rtimantraormu ̄rtividya ̄used to invoke or call forth their visible form (their mu ̄rti). There are alsokala ̄mantras, used to manifest the different parts (kala ̄) constitutive of the deity,which is thus conceived as made up of, ritually constructed with, mantras. Thelatter are therefore ontologically prior and superior to the former: in manyrespects tantric pantheons are systems or configurations of mantras rather thanof deities. Since there are mantras for, or corresponding to, or included amongthe constitutive elements or divisions of the cosmos described in tantric texts –thetattvas,kala ̄s,an.d.as,bhuvanas,adhvans, and even mantras – and sincemantras are used to evoke these entities, the very cosmos can be conceived ofas basically made up of mantras. Indeed, in the cosmogony of the Ahir-budhnyasam.hita ̄ of the Pa ̄ñcara ̄tra, the condition the god Vis.n.u assumes beforecreating the cosmos through a phonetic process is described as “mantric”(mantramaya). In this sam.hita ̄ as well as in S ́aiva texts, the manifestation of thecosmos results from the apparition in the supreme godhead of the 49/50phonemes of the Sanskrit alphabet,11fromAtoKS.A: all these phonemes can beconsidered as so many mantras (“seed-mantras,” bı ̄jamantras, rather, since theyare made by adding to each individual letter the bindu m., from AM.toKS.AM.).But the whole alphabet can also be considered as an alphabetic form of the godBhairava: “Bhairava of the totality of sound,” S ́abdara ̄s ́ibhairava, who is thusconsidered, and can be made use of, as a mantra of 50 syllables. Similarly, a dif-ferent order of the alphabet (going from NatoPha), called Ma ̄linı ̄, is both agoddess and a mantra. In such cases it is sometimes difficult to distinguishmantra from deity, for a deity may be considered as made up of, as being, amantra, or as made up of letters of the alphabet – these are “mantra-deities”(mantradevata ̄), “alphabet-deities” (varnadevata ̄), or “letter-goddesses” (lipidevı ̄)such as Sarasvatı ̄ in her form as Va ̄gı ̄s ́ı ̄.12The three supreme goddesses of theS ́aiva system of the Trika, Para ̄, Apara ̄, and Para ̄para ̄, are mantradevata ̄s, beingmade up respectively ofSAUH., of a mantra of 38 syllables, and of the three bı ̄jasHRI ̄H.HU ̄M.PHAT..Like Hindu deities – only more so – mantras are innumerable. They are tra-ditionally said to number 70 million – one of those large numbers in which Indiadelights. But nobody has ever counted them, in spite of the many lists that exist.The fact that mantras are regarded as secret formulas, powerful spells that canbe used for any purpose, good or bad, may explain the absence from all tradi-tions of any complete catalog. Moreover, in the existing lists, and more gener-ally in nearly all Tantric texts, mantras are usually not quoted in full. They arereferred to instead by their names – S ́rı ̄vidya ̄, for instance, or Hr.dayabı ̄ja, forSAUH., Pin.d.ana ̄tha or Ma ̄tr.sadbha ̄va, for KHPHREM., etc. –, or by the name oftheir devata ̄, or by their own names if they are mantradevata ̄s, like Nava ̄tman, or else by the number of their syllables, such as pañcadas ́a ̄ks.aramantrafor theS ́rı ̄vidya ̄ of 15 syllables, etc.mantra487"},{"pageNumber":495,"pageContent":"The secret character of mantras, together with the fact that they embody thehighest and most efficacious power ofva ̄c, the spoken-speaking Word, a powercalledmantravı ̄rya, is the reason why they may be transmitted and received onlyin secrecy and by word of mouth. They go, as is said, “from ear to ear” (karn.a ̄tkarn.am). A written mantra (and this is true not only in Tantric circles) or amantra found in a book is lifeless, powerless,13since it lacks the spiritual elementwhich only a qualified master can transmit. When their use is prescribed in atext, secrecy in transmission is upheld by employing conventional names fortheir constituent letters, or by quoting these letters in reverse order or in disor-der, or else by using secret diagrams called prasta ̄raorgahvara(“display” or“cavern”), which are ritually drawn and in which the letters of the Sanskritalphabet from which those of the mantra are to be chosen are displayed in a par-ticular order. These conventional ways of quoting mantras without actuallyrevealing them are called their “extraction” (mantroddha ̄ra). The secret esoterictransmission of mantras applies to those conferred during initiation and espe-cially to those which are to be used for a specific religious or magical purpose.Such devices are not necessary for mantras used in the course of ordinaryrituals, even if only selected (initiated) individuals are permitted to perform theserites.Each Tantric tradition has its own system of mantras and usually considersthe mantras of other traditions ineffective or dangerous. Such inadequatemantras, whether they belong to one’s own or to another initianic lineage, aresometimes described as suffering from defects (dos.a), usually described as of avery human character (being hungry, asleep, poor, cross-eyed . . .). Rites calledmantrasam.ska ̄ra, “purification of mantras,” aim at removing such defects. Wehave here cases where mantras seem to be regarded more as supernatural individual entities than as forms ofva ̄c– even though the defects so concretelydescribed consist mostly in the presence (or absence) of particular letters or com-binations of letters. There are also mantras which are by nature faultless, orwhich can be used without restrictions as to their form or nature: OM.is anexample. Such mantras, or those which can be used for different purposes asso-ciated with other mantras, are said to be sa ̄dharan.a, generally applicable. The dis-tinction between two categories and uses of Tantric mantras is worth noting, forthere appear to be, on the one hand, ritual formulas which dothings when usedby authorized persons at the proper time and according to prescribed rules,which are usually not secret, being found in all ritual manuals, though they mayincludebı ̄jaswhich are esoteric in character. On the other hand, in initiationsand/or for particular rituals, in particular those that may be called magical,mantras are esoterically transmitted from a master, who is a mantrinin that heknows and masters mantras, to a qualified disciple. This is especially the case inthe Tantric initiation (the dı ̄ks.a ̄) thanks to which the initiand will be admittedinto a particular group and be permitted to perform certain rites. If the initiatedoes not seek merely liberation (moks.a), if he is not what is called a mumuks.u,but intends to attain particular powers (siddhis), or enjoy particular mundaneor supramundane rewards, an intent denoted by the Sanskrit root SIDDH, he is488andré padoux"},{"pageNumber":496,"pageContent":"abhubuks.u, a seeker ofbhukti, and more specifically, if he receives the properdı ̄ksa ̄, a sa ̄dhaka.

In the S ́aiva kaula dı ̄ks.a ̄, too, thereis a moment when the initiand is possessed by the mantras placed in a ritualdiagram. These are cases where the distinction between mantra and deity tendsto disappear. We cannot enter here into the difficult question of the nature ofTantric mantras, a subject on which traditions often disagree. We may, however,say that, depending on texts and circumstances, mantras are seen either asdeities or powers, or as powerful formulas, formulas which exist empirically aslinguistic or metalinguistic elements, but which are divine in essence, and thisis why they are powerful. But they can also be seen and manipulated as bothformula and deity – a deity that is a mantra. This ambiguity probably resultsfrom the fact that Tantric conceptions of mantras unsystematically combinenotions of Vedic origin on the power ofva ̄cwith a ̄gamic rites and theologicalbeliefs. The former are more prominent in the tantras of Bhairava and still morein the often nondualist S ́aiva metaphysical systems (and in the texts of thePa ̄ñcara ̄tra), while the latter prevail in the generally dualist and highly ritu-alistic S ́aiva ̄gamas.14In India today, apart from ritual, it is the magical use ofmantras that is the most in evidence.The scope of this chapter does not permit us to review, even briefly, the manyand varied mantric practices described in Tantric texts; nor can we look at thebeliefs which go with them, however interesting (and sometimes curious) theymay be. The often very subtle philosophical disquisitions on the nature, effectivepower, and spiritual ways of access to the power to be found, for instance, in thework of such S ́aiva Kashmirian masters as Abhinavagupta or Ks.emara ̄ja (tenthto eleventh centuries) must also be left aside in spite of their interest. We shalltherefore limit ourselves to a rapid survey of just two important aspects of theuse of Tantric mantras, namely their ritual and their yogic applications.As has already been pointed out, all Tantric rituals consist essentially in theutterance of mantras. A rite, even a ritual worship, a pu ̄ja ̄, can be performedwithout any icon or concrete object of any sort, but it cannot be carried outwithout mantras. In a pu ̄ja ̄the deity is invoked and made present in the icon ordiagram; it is kept there and made to pay attention to the cult by mantras. It is bathed, it is offered flowers, incense, food, etc., with mantras which do notmerely accompany these actions and offerings, but actually perform them.Indeed, a pu ̄ja ̄can be perfomed without any concrete substances, etc., beingoffered, but with only mantras being uttered. This goes on until the deity is “dis-missed” by the appropriate mantra; after which there normally takes place arecitation (japa) of the deity’s mantra, which is finally “offered” to it. Since thereis a Tantric rule that “one who is not a god cannot worship god,” the officiatingperson’s body and mind must be deified before the worship begins. This prelim-inary ritual is performed by placing (by nya ̄sa) mantras on the performer’s body,mantra489"},{"pageNumber":497,"pageContent":"which they pervade with their power. Thus divinized, the officiant must thenperform on himself as a divine being an “inner” mental worship which is carriedout by means of mantras only. During the ritual “outer” (ba ̄hya) worship thatfollows, the mantras are deemed to create the body of the deity, and to make upits throne (a mantra ̄sana, formed by all the levels of the cosmos, the tattvas, fromthe lowest to the highest, all represented by their mantras mentally piled on eachother). Mantras, too, accomplish such ritual acts as transforming water intonectar (amr.ta), infusing ritual implements or substances with divine power, pro-tecting the ritual area, destroying obstacles, burning impurities, and so forth.Their utterance is often accompanied by ritual gestures (mudra ̄), usually con-sidered as merely accompanying them, underlining their power, rather than as directly operative. The effectiveness of mantras is particularly stressed andvalued in the so-called ka ̄mya, “desiderative,” rites performed so as to obtainsome desired result. In all such practices one finds at work the dual nature ofmantras: as words of power which effect what they say or symbolize, and as powerful supernatural entities.Mantras are also used in meditation and/or yogic practices, where they arementally perceived and meditated by the adept so that he may assimilate theirpower in mind and body, and thus attain either rewards or liberation. This is doneeither through meditation – dhya ̄naorbha ̄vana ̄– or as part of a cult, the Tantricpu ̄ja ̄often including yogic practices designed to foster the process of identifica-tion with the deity worshipped, a characteristic feature of the Tantric worship.These mantric practices sometimes consist in the intellectual and mysticalrealization of the “meaning,” that is, the symbolic value, of the mantra. Such isthe case, for instance, when the adept is to realize the inner creative movementof the supreme godhead as symbolized by the three letters of the mantra SAUH..The movement goes from pure absolute being (sat=S), to the coalescence of thethree basic creative energies of S ́iva (AU, because this syllable is called trikon.abı ̄ja,triangular seed), energies which are eventually emitted (H.since this letter iscalledvisarga, which means emission) in the absolute divine consciousness.Thebı ̄jamantra(for such practices do not concern longer formulas) can alsobe uttered by associating its utterance (ucca ̄ra, a term connoting an upwardmovement) with the ascent of the kun.d.alinı ̄, the human and cosmic form ofdivine power. The adept feels the presence of the mantra in himself as an ascend-ing subtle phonic vibration, the na ̄da, going from the lowest of his bodily cakrasto a subtle center above his head. Being carried upward by this movement whichhe imagines but also experiences somehow in his body, he eventually unites withthe Absolute on the ultimate plane ofva ̄cas well as of consciousness. In somecases the mantra, after having reached this supreme level, is imagined as flowingdown like a fluid substance, pervading the whole body of the yogin, who thusbecomes perfect and immortal. This quasi-physical conception and perception ofthe mantra is very typically tantric.We may add that mantras are abundantly used in any number of magic practices, often as amulets (kavaca), and so in written form, nowadays at least,not always in Sanskrit. In some amulets or yantras, they may even be written in490andré padoux"},{"pageNumber":498,"pageContent":"Arabic script. These are popular forms of mantra, but, like more sophisticatedones, they are signs of the Indian, nay universal, belief in the power or magicalefficacy of the word.15Notes1It is important to note that Vedic – vaidikain Sanskrit – is the term that has beenused for centuries to denote orthodox Hindu beliefs and practices. But even suchnon-Vedic texts as the tantras often tell their adepts to follow orthodox “Vedic” rulesof behavior in their social lives.2There are exceptions to this rule, as we shall see; however, they do not affect thegeneral principle of the fundamentally oral/aural character of mantras. It may beinteresting to note here that though forms ofva ̄c, the Word, the Vedic hymnsrevealed to the ancient Vedic poet-seers, the r.s.iswere deemed to have been seen bythem.3On these texts, see pp. 81–6.4Which were “Vedic” – vaidika– insofar as their rules and beliefs did not contradictthe Veda.5The ritual and devotional reading and recitation of the Devı ̄ma ̄ha ̄ tmya, where theutterance (ucca ̄ra) of this Pura ̄ nic text is preceded and followed by that of hymnsfrom the R.gveda, is another example of the religious use of the recitation of a sacredtext. On this, see Coburn 1991.6We may perhaps quote here the French indologist Louis Renou, who once wrote:“It is as easy in India to notice continuities as it is difficult to point out breaks incontinuity” (my translation).7A rule which underlines the priority of the form over the “meaning” of mantras.8Bha ̄vana ̄, from the verbal root BHU ̄, to come into being, is an intense form of mentalconcentration which activates the mantra, makes it perceptible to the meditatingperson, and identifies him/her with it.9Such is in particular the case of the so-called S ́aiva-, S ́a ̄ kta-, or Yoga-Upanis.ads ofthe canonical collection of the 108 Upanis.ads, a collection (as we know now) puttogether, and in some cases reworked, in the first half of the eighteenth century byone Upanis.adbrahmayogin.10Contrary to what is often believed, monosyllabic mantras do not necessarily endwith the bindu m..11There are 49 phonemes (varn.aoraks.ara) in Sanskrit, to which is traditionally addedthe group K+S=KS.A.12The well-known Tantric treatise S ́a ̄rada ̄ tilaka describes a Lipitanu Va ̄gı ̄s ́varı ̄, a“Goddess of the Word whose body is made of letters.”13This is the general rule. But exceptions could easily be quoted. In India, there areas many stringent rules as there are exceptions to them.14But ta ̄ ntrikas, whatever their persuasion, are “super-ritualists” – when ritual isrejected, it is only for those who have attained the highest esoteric plane.15For a very interesting study of modern mantric practices see Diehl 1956. The mostthorough study of mantras to date is Alper 1989.

On the other hand, every serious work on casteemphasizes the extraordinary uniformity of the beliefs and ritual practices asso-ciated with this institution (or set of institutions). It is a curious fact, then, thatthere is a near-unanimous consensus that caste and Hinduism are inextricablylinked. A statement cited in the opening pages of Lipner’s textbook on Hinduismmight well have come from Weber or any of his intellectual descendants whoseinterpretations of caste have dominated intellectual discussion of the subject inthe disciplines of sociology and social anthropology: “Caste is the Hindu form ofsocial organization. No man can be a Hindu who is not in caste” (Farquhar1913: 216, cited in Lipner 1994: 3). However, Lipner reminds us that there is adissenting, minority view which states that one must be very careful in makingthis equation: “The caste system, though closely integrated into the [Hindu]religion, is not essential to it...Even the profession of belief in the authority of the Veda is not essential” (Brockington 1981: 4, see Lipner 1994: 3).In this chapter I will support Brockington’s decoupling of caste andHinduism, though from a rather different perspective. Those who insist on theconnection, it will be argued, invariably select only certain ideological featuresof caste as worthy of consideration while dismissing others as if they simply did not exist. This typically goes hand in hand with an obliviousness to certainhistorical and sociological features which characterize caste and which explainits distinctiveness from other forms of social organization, such as tribe or estateor class.1What exactly do we mean by caste? What almost everyone can agree on isthat wherever there is caste, certain features are found linked together in a sys-tematic fashion.

These groups are based on linealkinship, and tightly regulated marriage alliances between households of differ-ent lineages. From one perspective, regulating marriage often appears to be a device on the part of wealthy households for inhibiting the dispersal ofland ownership. But non-landowning lineages, whether wealthy merchants orimpoverished groups, also regulate their marriages just as strictly as membersof landowning lineages. The fundamental message being circulated by membersof all “castes” (i.e. groups of intermarrying lineages) is invariably phrased interms of an encouragement to prevent one’s own “kind” from being contami-nated, with the word for “kind” in most Indian languages being ja ̄ti(or somevariant thereof), a concept which might also be translated as “species.”It is as if members of different groups were saying: “We are different fromeach other in the same way that different animal species are. Just as cats anddogs cannot interbreed, neither can we.” Since some relativist thinkers are reluc-tant to say that people with other cultural ideas are “wrong,” it needs perhapsto be stressed (if we are going to explain the ideology that different castes mustnot miscegenate) that there is, in fact, only one human species and its membersare not prevented from interbreeding because of their different origins. The arbi-trary, cultural nature of the prohibition on intermixing is shown more clearlystill by the fact that it is not restricted to procreation. Members of different castesare generally convinced that they should not eat together except on special occa-sions (and then should not eat “normal,” everyday food), and that they shouldabstain from performing certain rituals together.It is not uncommon for a village to have 20 or more castes all claiming toabjure relations of any fundamental kind with each other. But why should therebe such a proliferation of “kinds” wherever there is caste? A preliminary clue isthat in caste-organized communities normally one kind predominates in everysense – politically, economically, numerically, and as the provider of the mainpatrons of rituals. Conventionally referred to as the “dominant” caste (followingSrinivas 1959), they are more accurately entitled the “noble” or “kingly” caste,it being understood that nobility and kingship are refractions of each other, aswill become clearer later. All of the other castes are groups of lineages whichhave an obligation to provide people who will perform specialized ritual dutiesfor the noble caste. To default on these obligations always incurs some kind ofsanction, which is frequently underpinned by the threat, if not the actual use of,violence. Generally, the only people who can escape from these ritual obligationsare those merchants who are not dependent on landowners, or renouncers wholive a mendicant life outside of the sedentary communities organized along castelines.While there is a great deal of variation among theorists regarding the allegedunderlying mechanisms which generate this phenomenon whereby a multi-plicity of groups all fastidiously distinguish themselves from each other, mostpeople would agree that certain features stand out when caste is compared to496declan quigley"},{"pageNumber":503,"pageContent":"other forms of social organization. Of these perhaps the most striking is the insti-tution of untouchability whereby members of certain castes are so excluded thatthey appear on occasion to be beyond the pale of normal society. One verycommon, and perfectly acceptable, way to approach caste is thus by explaininguntouchability.2Crudely, though not inaccurately, there are two main explanations foruntouchability, both of which present Untouchables as the “opposites” ofBra ̄hman.as (spelled in various ways). Both of these approaches envisage casteorganization as “hierarchical,” in the commonly accepted sense of this term: aladder-like system of statuses. In both approaches, Bra ̄hman.as are at the “top”and Untouchables are at the “bottom.” According to one approach this is sobecause Bra ̄hman.as are priests and priests are pure, while Untouchables arepolluted because they perform degrading tasks which deal with the inauspiciousfacets of life and death. According to the other approach, the superiority ofBra ̄hman.as is fundamentally based on landed wealth and the power whichderives from it, while the wretched condition of Untouchables results from thefact that they are typically landless and dispossessed. According to this lattertheory, all talk of purity and pollution, whether by those who practice caste, orthose who analyze it, simply obscures the underlying economic and politicalreality.I will show shortly that neither of these theories is sustainable because theunderlying assumption of a stratified, ladder-like series of caste statuses does notmatch certain crucial features of the known ethnography. Before elaborating onthis, however, it is necessary to consider the most celebrated and influential(though also the most attacked) theorist of caste, Louis Dumont, who arguesagainst the idea of caste-as-stratification but then confuses the issue by appear-ing to employ precisely this concept. Dumont (1980 [1966]) attempts to escapefrom the notion of caste-as-stratification by introducing us to a second meaningof “hierarchy,” that of the encompassment of the part by the whole, whichimplies also the encompassment of something by its contrary. Thus, for example,in traditional societies the individual is encompassed by society and in castesociety, argues Dumont, the pure encompasses the impure.Dumont argues that Western theorists and those influenced by them tend tosee caste through modern, individualistic spectacles and to apply a set of judg-ments which are not applicable in the “holistic” traditions of caste-organizedcommunities where the individual is subordinated to, encompassed by, the moralclaims of the collective. He is perfectly correct to state that caste ideology givesprimacy to the whole community and has no place for the modern Westernconcept of individualism where people are free to make their own choices aboutwhom they associate with. In connection with this, everyone will agree withDumont that caste involves a “heavy” and pervasive use of ritual for structur-ing social relations which in many other societies are structured by centralizedpolitical and economic institutions.In the Indian case, argues Dumont, this holism expresses itself with referenceto two ideological features: the opposition of the pure and the impure, and whaton the relationship between caste and hinduism497"},{"pageNumber":504,"pageContent":"he calls the “disjunction between status and power.” By the latter he means thatthose who are the most politically powerful defer to the representatives of reli-gious values because the ultimate meaning of the society derives from thosevalues. This is why, he claims, in everyday life the priest ranks higher than theking, and in the varn.aschema of the Vedic texts the Bra ̄hman.a ranks higher thanthe Ks.atriya.Dumont’s theory has had pervasive and enduring appeal in spite of a torrentof criticism from every conceivable angle. The reason for this appeal is simple.Hindus themselves often claim that Bra ̄hman.as are the “highest” caste andUntouchables the “lowest” and Dumont’s approach appears to provide an expla-nation for this. But this common popular formulation of the order of castes runsinto problems immediately. First, there are thousands of Bra ̄hman.a castes whosemembers daily dispute each other’s status.3Evidently, if one Bra ̄hman.a casteclaims superiority over another Bra ̄hman.a caste, not all of them can be the“highest.” And if some Bra ̄hman.as are “higher” than others, then the criterionof being “higher” obviously must be by virtue of something other than simplybeing a Bra ̄hman.a. But what? This is one of the trickiest, and most contested,questions in the explanation of caste.The evidence needed to resolve this question, however, points overwhelminglyin one direction. The work of some “priests” (i.e. performers of ritual activitieson behalf of others) is clearly regarded by everyone in caste-organized com-munities as defiling. This seems relatively uncontroversial in relation to themembers of those castes who deal overtly with death or the disposal of liminalsubstances such as cut hair and nails, feces, menstrual blood, and afterbirth.Which society does not have to deal with these by setting them apart? But thework of a number of authors (see especially Heesterman 1985; Parry 1980;1986 and Raheja 1988a) suggests a much more radical view of ritual activity,for it would appear that it is not merely dealing with the physical byproducts ofhuman life and decay which is dangerous. It is not just castes such as Barbersand Tanners, Washermen and Sweepers, they argue, whose status is endangeredby their ritual activities. So too is the status of Bra ̄hman.a priests who are nor-mally conceived of as the “highest” caste(s) because of their alleged distancefrom the polluting functions of Untouchable and other “lowly” specialist castes.Allpriestly activity is dangerous because it involves the acceptance of “gifts,”commonly referred to as da ̄n.a, which act as vessels for the inauspicious qualitieswhich the patron of the ritual is attempting to shed. The evidence for this is bothethnographic and textual and indicates clearly that members of Bra ̄hman.acastes who function as priests are tainted, or compromised, by their ritual activ-ities. Many members of Bra ̄hman.a castes display their awareness of this problemby their reluctance to take on priestly duties. These nonpriestly Bra ̄hman.as, weare told, “widely despise Brahman priests” (Fuller 1984: 50; see also Guneratne2001: 539).This is not to imply that all ritual tasks enjoy equal esteem or lack of it; man-ifestly this is not the case. As a rough rule of thumb one might say that thosecastes whose functions are most closely associated with death and decay have498declan quigley"},{"pageNumber":505,"pageContent":"the lowest status, while those whose functions are more ethereal enjoy thehighest status. However, the relative evaluation of caste statuses is far from beingan easy matter since the paradigmatic ritual which connects members of noblecastes to others is sacrifice, and this is, by its nature, simultaneously ethereal andimplicated in violent death. Bra ̄hman.as normally represent themselves as beingremoved from the violent aspect of sacrifice but this is always relative and, in thefinal analysis, something of an illusion (or delusion). This theme cannot bepursued here without a full-blown exploration of the nature of sacrifice. Sufficeit to say that the ambiguity which is at the heart of this primal ritual of deathand rebirth translates into caste relations, as we will see a little later. One might object, however, that if it is the actual performance of ritual func-tions which is hazardous for one’s status, it is curious that the status of othermembers of the caste is also compromised even when they do not themselvesperform impure tasks. These people are affected because they either come fromone’s own lineage (i.e. they are related consanguineally), or they come fromother lineages with whom members of one’s own lineage conventionally marry(i.e. they are related affinally). Caste status cannot therefore be simply “interac-tional” as Marriott (1968) argued in a very influential article which contrastedwith the “attributional” theory of Dumont. Kinship and marriage are alsoprimary determinants of caste status.Ethnographic reports often fail to make clear that all members of castes donot need to perform the ritual function from which they derive their status. Whatis crucial is that one or more members of the caste in question provide the nec-essary ritual functionary. Caste is often reported to be a matter of occupation.This is false: what is at issue is a periodic ritual contribution to the community.All of the members of one caste may be agricultural labourers yet only someamong them may be required to perform a particular ritual function – say, toplay music on the occasion of worshipping a particular deity. Another caste (i.e.a group with whom the former will not intermarry) may also be agriculturallaborers and have a different ritual function – say, to be pall-bearers for noblecastes. Discrimination of this kind can be endless – as with totemic groups (see Lévi-Strauss’s interesting comparisons, 1963, 1966 [1962]). Even amonggroups where the link between caste and occupation appears more clear-cut, itis rarely the case that all members of the caste perform the job in question. Thus,to be a Barber is not to be a hair-cutter, but to be related to others whose ritualfunction involves the cutting of hair and other related tasks, such as nail-paringand midwifery, as elements of purificatory ceremonies. A Barber could, there-fore, be a taxi-driver, while the man cutting hair in the barber’s shop (i.e. as aprofession rather than as part of a ritual function) could well be a member ofanother caste. Similarly, a Bra ̄hman.a need not be a priest, a Farmer may be arickshaw driver, and so on.These three indisputable ethnographic realities – the fundamental nature oflineal affiliation in providing caste status; the fact that only some members of acaste perform the ritual function which gives all of the members of the castetheir status; and the fact that members of a variety of castes perform ritual on the relationship between caste and hinduism499"},{"pageNumber":506,"pageContent":"functions which are widely regarded as inherently dangerous – mean that thereare four mistakes in the oft-repeated formula that “Bra ̄hman.as are the highestcaste because they are priests.”41Not all priests are Bra ̄hman.as;2Many Bra ̄hman.as are not priests. They are Bra ̄hman.as because they arerelated to other Bra ̄hman.as (who may or may not be priests themselves; ifthey are assumed to be related to priests at some point, this may be in thedistant, or forgotten, past);3At least some priests are degraded by their ritual activities and, according tosome authorities, allof them are;4If the performance of ritual functions is degrading or compromising, thisimplies that only the renouncer, who is by definition outside caste-organizedsociety, can claim to be “pure.” The concept of “most pure” cannot then beequated with “highest” since “highest” indicates “inside.”The most important conclusion one can draw from these observations is thatthe idea that “Bra ̄hman.as are the highest caste” makes no sense (irrespective ofthe fact that it is very widely held by Hindus themselves and by commentatorson Hinduism). There is no doubt that ritual activity is directed at the ridding ofinauspicious qualities, but this does not indicate a capacity to rank groups ashigher and lower. On the contrary, careful study of the ethnographic recordshows that it is always impossible to rank castes unambiguously or without con-testation: ambiguity and dispute are built in to the structure of caste relations.This is seen both in the relations between patrons of rituals and priests of variouskinds, and among patron castes themselves.5Once these points are admitted, much of Dumont’s theory of caste quicklystarts to unravel. For Dumont, the opposition of the pure and the impuredepends on priests monopolizing ritual functions which were once the preserveof the king: “power in India became secular at a very early date” (Dumont 1980:76). But in spite of the fact that his entire theory of caste hangs on this claim,Dumont provides no evidence to support it – bar his own assertions thatBra ̄hman.as are now unambiguously the “highest” caste and Untouchables the“lowest.” With much textual and ethnographic evidence suggesting otherwise,it is fortunate that there is an alternative way of approaching the problem whichdoes not depend on concepts of highest and lowest.The pollution concepts which are the hallmark of caste are conventionallysaid to be an expression of “Hinduism,” even though we know perfectly well thatthis is not a monolithic set of beliefs. An alternative representation of castevalues portrays them as an expression of institutions associated with kingship.This approach, which is often associated with the seminal work of Hocart (1950[1938]), has certain advantages over any other explanation of caste. First, itoffers an explanation of why caste organization is found in some parts of theIndian subcontinent but not others. Typically, caste originates in regions which500declan quigley"},{"pageNumber":507,"pageContent":"are ecologically capable of sustaining kingdoms: relatively large populations ina relatively small area. Caste is associated with fertile agriculture, not withbarren mountainous or desert regions. Secondly, it offers an explanation of whycaste organization is found among non-Hindu communities in India, Nepal andSri Lanka and why very similar forms of social organization are found in othermonarchical and feudal societies which give ideological stress to what Geertz(1980) has aptly called “the exemplary center.”Caste ideology is an expression of the conflicting demands of two differentprinciples of social organization. On the one hand, there is the hierarchical prin-ciple of monarchy, a form of centralization which, of itself, is always verytenuous because it is dependent on personal patronage.6On the other hand,there is the relatively egalitarian principle of lineage organization which simul-taneously stresses kinship (sameness) and marriageability (difference, butbridgeable difference). To be a member of a lineage in a caste-organized societyis to identify first with one’s lineal kin in opposition to members of all otherlineages, then to identify with that group of lineages inside of which one mayseek spouses in opposition to those lineages which are not acceptable marriagepartners.Hocart brings together these principles of organization in caste society byarguing that castes are “families” which hereditarily transfer ritual functions inorder to ensure that the king and nobles remain in a pure state (1950: 17, 20).In contrast to the idea that caste is orientated to a pure–impure axis withBra ̄hman.as and Untouchables at polar ends, Hocart argues that what is at stakeis the integrity of kingship, the institution to which everyone is connected. Byimplication, it is a very fragile integrity which can only be maintained by therepeated performance of rituals (sacrifices). The integrity of kingship provides amodel – an exemplary center – for others to emulate by replicating the king’srituals on a lesser scale.Hocart’s approach endorses Dumont’s assertion that the separation of kingand priest (as he put it, the “disjunction between status and power”) is centralto the theory of caste. But it shows that Dumont was quite wrong about thedynamic of relations between kings and priests and the underlying structurethey depended on. Nobility and kingship are not a simple matter of materialdominance, but are concerned with the ability to command rituals which bringthe community together and expurgate the inauspiciousness which social lifehabitually generates. Priests are the instruments who perform this purging func-tion and who therefore make possible kingship and nobility. Caste organizationcould thus be said to be a division of the community into noble and kinglyfamilies on the one hand and priests on the other, provided it is understood that the primary function of priests is to cleanse the society of anything whichthreatens it with death and evil.In the modern, postcolonial period, the ostensible disappearance of kings fromthe political scene has not led to the disappearance of kingshipas an organizingprinciple of ritual and social relations though this has often been obscured byon the relationship between caste and hinduism501"},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":"modern political realities (see also Galey 1989). Even Raheja, whose brilliantethnography exposed the faultlines of Dumont’s theory more clearly than anyother recent work, muddies the waters somewhat when considering the natureof caste in contemporary India. She writes that “[k]ingship no longer exists, butit has been, perhaps, replaced by the ritual centrality of the dominant caste”(Raheja 1988b:517). The word “replaced” is unfortunate because it has alwaysbeen the function of members of dominant castes to patronize ritual, replicatingon a diminished scale the role of the king. Put differently, members of dominantcastes continue to be mini-kings, not just materially, but in terms of their politi-cal/ritual function. They are “at the center of a complex ritual organization thatpermeates nearly every aspect of the everyday life of the village” (ibid.). This real-world fact of kingship/patronage sits uneasily with Dumont’s insistence that theking’s role has been secularized, and much more comfortably with Hocart’s claimthat the king/patron is the “principal” of the ritual (Hocart 1970 [1936]: 61).A phrase which I have elided from the two quotes from Raheja in the previ-ous paragraph further confuses understanding of both kingship, and relationsbetween patrons of rituals and the priests who carry them out. In the village ofher fieldwork, she says, “as in many of the textual traditions on kingship, theBra ̄hman.a is hierarchically superior, yet the dominant landholding caste standsat the center of a complex ritual organization ...” (ibid.). It is difficult to see whatthe foundation for this alleged superiority is, other than an engrained idea thatBra ̄hman.asmustbe superior because that is what everyone else seems to believethese days. In practice, superiority seems to attach to members of the landhold-ing caste in both ritual and nonritual domains. If the Bra ̄hman.a is “hierarchi-cally superior” in an ideological sense, it is a Bra ̄hman.a who is so idealized thathe cannot possibly belong to the world of caste relations where he would betainted by the receipt of prestations for performing ritual services. It cannot bethe Bra ̄hman.a of the village who is necessarily immersed in caste (i.e. interde-pendent) relations, and who is therefore, like everyone else, caught up in the webof inauspiciousness which is the product of the dealings of normal social life.Interestingly, Dumont’s theory predicts just this eventuality: “In theory, poweris ultimately subordinate to priesthood, whereas in fact priesthood submits topower” (Dumont 1980: 71–2).One of the problems with any understanding of caste is that the word “caste”itself has been used to translate two quite different Sanskrit concepts which areassumed, quite wrongly, to have an automatic connection. We have alreadyencountered the concept ofja ̄tiand its sense of “kind” or “species.” Another wayof glossing this concept might be to say “the group that one was born into,” therelativity of this gloss conveying the contextual nature ofja ̄tiascriptions. Whenasked to name their ja ̄ti, people may name their patrilineage, the name of thegroup of lineages they conventionally marry into, or even the name of whatwould now be called an ethnic group. However, even though the concept iselastic, the idea of origin by birth is constant. There is no mystery about this. Ifa British person is asked: “where are you from?,” he or she may give the name502declan quigley"},{"pageNumber":509,"pageContent":"of a village, a county, a country, or even a continent depending on the interpre-tation given to what the questioner is seeking. Scholars approaching caste through the study of Hinduism and comparativereligion may be less acquainted with sociological and anthropological studies ofcaste on the ground and are more likely to be familiar with the Vedic concept ofvarn.awhich is also used to translate the word “caste.” The referent of thisconcept is rather different from that ofja ̄tisince the fundamental idea is less“belonging to a group by virtue of common birth” than “functions which mustbe performed if cosmic harmony and social harmony are to prevail” – it beingunderstood that cosmic harmony and social harmony are dependent on eachother. What the varn.aandja ̄ticoncepts share is an idea of “keeping apart” andit is this which allows them to become conflated in the concept of caste.In fact the original idea ofvarn.adoes seem to imply differences of originsbetween the “Vedic Indians, who called themselves “noble ones” (a ̄ryas), [and]the other peoples they encountered (chiefly the Harappans to begin with)”(Lipner 1994: 88). But the idea of separating conquerors from indigenes seemsto quickly become subordinate to an idea of protecting nobility which is inde-pendent of any consideration of ethnic origins. It has been mentioned thatrituals performed by priests on behalf of members of patron (noble, kingly)castes are paradigmatically sacrifices. It is no accident that the concept ofvarn.ais inextricably tied to a sacrificial theory of human society. The famous versefrom Rgveda x, 90 speaks of four varn.as: Bra ̄hman.a,ra ̄janya(later convention-ally referred to as the ks.atriya),vais ́ya, and s ́u ̄dra, each of which springs from adifferent part of the body of Purus.a – the lord of beings – who is portrayed ashaving been sacrificed at the beginning of time.Note that there is nothing here about lineage or pedigree, and neither is therein the later law book known as the Code of Manu (ca. 200 bcetoce200). In thistext each varn.ais portrayed as having a quintessentially different function. Thesefunctions revolve around sacrifice: just as the world and the four varn.as werecreated through an initial sacrifice, repetitions of this primal act are necessaryif order and harmony are to be maintained. To achieve this, each varn.ahas aspecific function:Manu lays down that the duty of the Bra ̄hman.a is to study and to teach, to sacrifice, and to give and receive gifts; the ks.atriya must protect the people, sacrificeand study; the vais ́ya also sacrifices and studies, but his chief function is to breedcattle, to till the earth, to pursue trade and to lend money; the s ́u ̄ dra’s duty is onlyto serve the three higher classes. . . for each man there was a place in society anda function to fulfil, with its own duties and rights. (Basham 1971: 139)Note again that there is no mention of any idea that a person performing anyspecific function must be born into a particular group. Yet there is a commonidea that people who belong to a particular ja ̄timust automatically have a cor-respondingvarn.aor belong to the residual category of Untouchables who arenot mentioned in the Vedic schema. Unfortunately reality is not so simple.on the relationship between caste and hinduism503"},{"pageNumber":510,"pageContent":"There is a great deal of dispute about which varn.aa particular ja ̄tishould beassociated with because everyone wants to be linked with the most noble lin-eages possible, and to dissociate themselves from anyone who might threatentheir status. Thus, from one perspective, someone may say: “All those people arelandowners and come from the Ra ̄jputja ̄ti; their varn.aisks.atriya.” Yet some ofthe people referred to may not go along with this. They may say: “it is true thatother people consider those people over there as Ra ̄jputs like us, but in fact theycome from different lineages and are not nobles like us. Our varn.aisks.atriya, buttheirs is s ́u ̄draand we would never marry them” (see especially Parry 1979).Similarly one group of priests may say that they are the priests of the formerkings and nobility and that this is made clear by the name of their ja ̄ti(e.g.Ra ̄jopa ̄dhya ̄ya in the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal). They might then claim that theirvarn.aisbra ̄hman.abut distinguish themselves from other people in the commu-nity who call themselves Bra ̄hman.as but who perform rituals for “low caste”households. They might insist that they would never marry with this othergroup ofsoi-disantBra ̄hman.as and might insist that the latter are “really” s ́u ̄dra.Considering yet another group of people who also call themselves Bra ̄hman.as,they might point out that the ritual role of this other group is restricted to theperformance of funeral rites and that they, the “real” Bra ̄hman.as, consider themto have a very low status, indeed to be “in fact” kinds of Untouchables.7These kinds of invidious distinctions are part and parcel of how caste works.Contrary to the impression given by some earlier commentators that caste dis-tinctions were rigid and universally agreed upon, others have always realizedthat there is a great deal of dispute about status:By organization and propaganda a caste can change its name and in the course oftime get a new one accepted, and by altering its canons of behaviour in the matterof diet and marriage can increase the estimation in which it is held. . . [A number]who claimed to be some special sort of Kshatriya or Vaishya at the 1921 censusclaimed to be some peculiar kind of Brahman in 1931. (Hutton 1963 [1946]: 98,113)Bothvarn.aascription and ja ̄tiascription are subject to claim and counter-claim,though there is a kind of obvious upper limit in that the more kingly a lineagecan present itself, the less will its claims to ks.atriyastatus be open to contest. Sim-ilarly, the more that a lineage can present itself as the domestic priests of kingsand nobility, the less will its claims to bra ̄hman.astatus be disputed. One shouldnot, however, assume that because certain people claimto be ofks.atriyaorbra ̄hman.astatus, that other people accept this claim. And one should not assumethat there is an automatic correspondence between varn.aandja ̄tiany more thatone should assume there is any inherent correspondence between English peoplecalled “Smith” and people who are smiths by occupation.Readers of this book who wish to approach the problem of caste from the per-spective of Hindu religious beliefs may be surprised that I have not referred toeither of two indigenous Indian concepts: karmaanddharma. Clearly this results504declan quigley"},{"pageNumber":511,"pageContent":"from my comparative approach which seeks to explain the institution of castein sociological terms rather than in terms of a regional ideology. Nevertheless,itissometimes said that Hindus are fatalistic and accept their caste statusbecause it is ordained by their karma, i.e. their destiny. No doubt this is some-times true; but equally, Hindus rebel against their lot just as frequently as anyother people. The idea that all Hindus meekly accept their caste position runscontrary to a mass of evidence. In modern times the attempts by millions ofUntouchables to redefine themselves, whether as of S ́u ̄dra status, or as Chris-tians or Buddhists (Isaacs 1964, Juergensmeyer 1982), provide perhaps themost striking instances of rebellion against the idea that one’s fate is written inthe stars.But there are many other illustrations of refusing to accept the position onewas born into which do not derive from modern conditions. The institution ofhypergamy in north India, which is widespread among landowning castes, is acenturies-old competitive marriage strategy the purpose of which is to renderone’s caste status as noble as possible by allying oneself to the most aristocraticfamilies who will accept one’s overtures, and distancing oneself from thoseamong one’s kin and caste fellows who might compromise one’s status. Othercommon examples of refusing to accept one’s place include the employment ofgenealogists to “prove” that one’s family has a glorious pedigree (Shah andShroff 1958), name changing in order to make it appear that one “really”belongs to a higher caste (Rosser 1966), and moving to another locality in orderto assume a new identity (Caplan 1975).The question ofdharmais more complicated. Many of the problems whichWestern interpretations of caste get into derive from a division between thespheres of religion and power which may be applicable to modern democraticsocieties, but which is meaningless in all of the complex, preindustrial, “tradi-tional” societies where the arena of politics is always heavily ritualized. In caste-organized communities, to refer to the arena of kingship as “secular” in orderto contrast it with the “religious” domain of priests is to introduce a divisionwhich cannot be sustained. If we translate dharmaas “religion,” it will be impos-sible to understand the character of any of the ritual mechanisms which areused to maintain caste divisions.The word “morality” much better conveys the sense ofdharma: the idea thatall positions carry with them certain expectations. If, as I have argued, the king’sexemplary centrality provides the key to the structure of caste relations, onemight expect that the dharmaof the king would be particularly onerous, and soit turns out to be:that brings us to the real nature ofra ̄jadharma, the teachers of which (all of thembrahmans) regarded kingship as a practical andreligious necessity, for they fearednothing more then chaos . . .Ra ̄jadharmais “the way a king should comporthimself in order to be righteous.” (Derrett 1976a: 606)The monarch is responsible for rainfall. . .

(Raheja 1988b: 514–15)A second problem with conceiving ofdharmaas “religion” is that Hindus (likemost other people) repeatedly contradict each other, and themselves, in relationto core values (see also Burghart 1978). There is a particular ambiguity sur-rounding the relations between patrons and priests because they are involved inan endless flow of inauspiciousness and this can be represented in contradictoryways. The widely reported uniformity in the structure of caste relations canhardly be said to derive from adherence to a set of values in relation to priestlypurity when, as we have seen, many Hindus regard all priests as contaminatedby their ritual duties.The uniformity of caste structure derives rather from a common sociologicalpredicament which is resolved through the institutions of kingship. This is whyit is perfectly possible to call oneself a Hindu and reject caste practices, but it isgenerally only possible to do so when one is living outsides the confines of amonarchical system – whether as a renouncer in the “traditional” world, or asa member of a more fluid, modern society.Notes1A much more detailed exposition of the argument that follows can be found inQuigley (1993).2Deliège (1999 [1995]) provides a comprehensive exploration of writings onuntouchability.3Levy (1990) provides an encyclopedic survey of ritual practitioners in one of themost complex examples of caste organization on the Indian sub-continent.

This is because, by hereditaryoccupation, they presided over the most important form of available power: that of the sacrificial ritual which was the source of temporal and spiritual well-being”(Lipner 1994: 89).5For further references and a more detailed examination of this, see Quigley (1993,ch. 4).6Yalman (1989) is particularly insightful on the connection between caste androyalty.7For ethnographic illustrations of Bra ̄hman.as making distinctions among each otherin this way, see especially Levy (1990), Parry (1980), and Fuller (1984).506declan quigley"},{"pageNumber":513,"pageContent":"ReferencesBasham, A.

Change was prompted by the political and cul-tural situation brought about by the British presence in south Asia, and by newmeans of communication. Challenges and opportunities came through contactwith cultures which had hitherto been inaccessible or unfamiliar. Foremostamong these was British culture, which was embodied, in various limited ways,by officials, teachers, missionaries, journalists, businessmen, soldiers, and otherson south Asian soil. Further, British culture in all its variety surrounded thoseHindus who traveled to Britain in increasing numbers through the nineteenthand twentieth centuries. Hindus looked not only to Britain but to the UnitedStates, and to France, Germany, and other European countries, through booksand periodicals, and sometimes through correspondence. In 1905 some werefascinated by the victory of Japan, another Asian country, over Russia; and from1917, some were stirred by events in what became the Soviet Union.At the same time new facilities for communication with the past led to aconcern with the literary, cultural and religious heritage of South Asia, whichwill be discussed below. This was also the period in which Indians acquired acommon identity. Hitherto they had identified themselves as Bengalis or Tamils,as S ́aivas, Jains, Muslims, and so on. To the British they were all “Asiatics” or“Natives,” as contrasted with “Englishmen” or “Europeans.” With the consoli-dation of British India as a political entity in the first half of the nineteenthcentury, the term “Indian,” which hitherto had often meant the British in India,came to mean the indigenous inhabitants. It thus becomes appropriate for us touse the term “Indian” rather than “south Asian” when referring to this period,remembering that in terms of present boundaries it covers not only India but"},{"pageNumber":516,"pageContent":"also Pakistan and Bangladesh. In the same period the term “Hindu,” which hadbeen first a geographical and then an ethnic label, came to be used as a religiousone, and a religion called Hinduism was discovered or invented (see GavinFlood’s Introduction to this volume).The period referred to as “modern” in which these changes took placeextends, very roughly, from the end of the eighteenth century through the twen-tieth. Some twentieth-century developments are considered in chapters in thepresent volume (Prasad, Ramaswamy, Viswanathan, Smith). For our presentpurposes, India becomes modern when communication is facilitated by meanssuch as printing, translation, and education, both in Indian languages and inEnglish, forming an arena in which public debate can take place. This arena,however, was a restricted one, to which most of the population had no access; itfunctioned mainly in large cities, and even there it was the preserve of an elite.It follows that in the modern period some parts of India, and some classes inIndian society, were more modern than others.The Political FrameworkMost of the religious thinkers we shall mention were involved in politics, and allwere aware of the great political fact of foreign rule. Much has been writtenabout colonialism as a factor in Western (or more precisely North Atlantic)understanding of India, and in Indian self-understanding (e.g. Kopf 1969; Inden1990). However, the use of this term, suggesting a single relationship of powerand exploitation, conceals the variety of relationships that existed at differenttimes and places between different groups of Indians on the one hand, and dif-ferent British groups on the other.In the eighteenth century the East India Company, which embodied Britishpower in India from its establishment in 1600 to its abolition in 1858, stillregarded itself as a trading company, and as deriving its political and fiscalauthority from the Mughal Emperor and other indigenous powers. However,successive renewals of the Company’s charter, at twenty-year intervals from1773 to 1853, brought it increasingly under the control of Parliament until thegovernment of British India was placed directly under the Crown in 1858.From the mid-eighteenth to the mid-nineteenth century the Companyacquired power in different territories at different times, by different means, andwith different intentions. Moreover, even from the 1850s, when the political mapof India reached the form which it retained, with a few changes, until 1947,about a third of the area was not ruled directly by the British, but by indigenousprinces bound by treaties requiring them to accept the advice of officials whowere partly diplomats and partly colonial governors. Some enclaves, again, werecolonies of European powers other than Britain: Denmark, France, the Nether-lands, and Portugal.The policies of the Company’s directors in London were often at odds not onlywith those of the British government but with those of its employees in India,510dermot killingley"},{"pageNumber":517,"pageContent":"who themselves were not unanimous. Most notably, while the Company tradi-tionally held that its position required it to refrain from interference in Indiansociety, some of its high officials thought that reform of society was a positiveduty, without which its presence in India would be unjustified. Such officialsincluded Lord Bentinck (1774–1839), Governor-General from 1828 to 1835,who came to India imbued with the utilitarianism of Jeremy Bentham, and SirCharles Grant (1746–1832), a member of the evangelical Clapham Sect, whobelieved that society could only be reformed by conversion to Christianity.Besides the Company’s employees, the British in India included independententrepreneurs, journalists, and missionaries, all of whom were regarded withhostility by the Company. Matters of public policy were debated by members ofall these groups, and by an increasing number of Indians. Debate was carriedon in print and in public meetings; and these, together with formal petitions,influenced the Governor-General and his subordinates to the extent to whichthey were willing, or considered themselves obliged, to listen. One of the recur-rent questions was whether there was, or ever could be, a truly representativepublic opinion in India.New CommunicationsThe nineteenth century saw rapid increases in communications, spreading fromthe three seaports in which British power was based: Bombay (Mumbai), Madras(Chennai), and Calcutta (Kolkata), the capital of British India and seat of theGovernor-General until 1911. The Grand Trunk Road linking Calcutta with theupper Ganges basin was developed from 1836 onwards. The first telegraph linewas laid in 1852, from Calcutta to Diamond Harbour, and the first 200 miles ofrailway were built between 1853 and 1856, starting at Bombay; by 1880 therailways had reached 4,300 miles (Schwartzberg 1978: 61; Bayly 1988: 198).Besides facilitating the movement of goods and people, the railways providedmen from the presidency towns with employment opportunities elsewhere,which facilitated the spread of ideas: for instance, many of the branches of theBra ̄hmo Sama ̄j which opened in the second half of the nineteenth century wereformed by Bengali railway officials from Calcutta (Damen 1983). Developmentsin international communications included the opening of the Suez Canal in1869, and a telegraph link to Britain in 1870.The transmission of ideas was revolutionized by printing – in English, the ver-nacular languages and Sanskrit. Though missionaries had pioneered printing inIndian languages, starting with Tamil in 1577, there was no printing inCalcutta, even in English, until 1777 (Nair 1987: 26). English-language news-papers soon followed, in Bombay and Madras as well as Calcutta. Vernacularnewspapers began in Bengali in 1818, followed by Gujarati in 1822 and Marathiin 1832 (Schwartzberg 1978: 105).Another important development was in communication with the past. Thestudy of the ancient Sanskrit literature of India had been carried on for centuriesmodernity, reform, and revival511"},{"pageNumber":518,"pageContent":"by pandits for whom it was a family tradition, but the patronage on which theydepended declined in the eighteenth century. The British presence brought newforms of patronage, and a new kind of scholar: the European Indologist, whodrew on the work of pandits and depended on their assistance, but interpretedthe tradition through Western forms of thought. At first there were no profes-sional Indologists: the only establishment for them at the beginning of the nine-teenth century was Fort William College, a training college for the East IndiaCompany’s British recruits which lasted only from 1801 to 1854 (Das 1978).On the other hand, amateur Indology flourished, though it was rarely officiallyrewarded except for work on dharma, which was considered to have a directapplication in the courts (Kejariwal 1988: 226f.). Pandits found new forms ofemployment at Fort William College, at missionary establishments, as teachersand translators to individuals, and in the law courts, where they were consultedon questions of Hindu dharma.An unintended consequence of the introduction of a judicial system on theEnglish model in 1773 was the appointment of Sir William Jones (1746–94) asa judge. He came to Calcutta in 1783, imbued with Enlightenment ideas aboutIndian culture, and eager to see it at first hand. He had drawn up a list ofresearch topics during his voyage out (Mukherjee 1968: 74), and in January1784, within four months of his arrival, he founded the Asiatic Society ofBengal, devoted to historical and literary research on India. The society had noIndian members till 1829 – not as a matter of policy, but because none applied(Kejariwal 1988: 152f.). However, the kind of research which it encouragedbrought British amateur scholars into collaboration with Indian scholars.Similar collaboration was fostered by the employment of pandits in various edu-cational institutions, and by missionaries.For Hindus, such study led to a new view of the past. Ideas which had hith-erto been the preserve of pandits trained in particular traditions of thought,could now be studied through printed editions, translations, and historicalaccounts. Most notably, Buddhism came to be part of the world of the Hinduintellectual: not as a system of errors to be refuted, as it appears in Sanskrit texts,but as a towering achievement of ancient Indian thought, and as a historicalreality whose monuments still stood on Indian soil. Even if it was viewed ashaving been superseded by later developments such as Veda ̄nta or bhakti,Buddhism was remembered as India’s spiritual gift to Asia.ChallengesThese developments in communication opened Hindu practices and ideas to crit-icism from the outside. Such criticism had come before, of course, from Muslims;and we must not forget the bhakti traditions with their often trenchant critiquesof particular social and ritual practices. But the new conceptualization ofHinduism meant that the hostile accounts of image-worship, the status of512dermot killingley"},{"pageNumber":519,"pageContent":"women, or Advaita Veda ̄nta, for instance, which were frequent in the nineteenthcentury, were taken as attacks on Hinduism itself, which had to be defendedagainst them either by justifying the beliefs and practices in question, or by repu-diating them as aberrations from the true Hinduism, or as misrepresentations onthe part of its opponents. Moreover, the dominance of Enlightenment ideas inthe arena of public debate, together with widely held assumptions of Christianand British superiority, meant that the resulting body of Hindu apologetic waspresented in terms of Western ideas of reason and morality which were assumedto be common to all civilized people.Eighteenth-century Western writers – for whom, it should be remembered,there was no such word as “Hinduism” – had often believed that the Hindus pos-sessed an ancient wisdom of immense value, even if its contemporary heirs didnot fully understand it. Brahmins were idealized as wise law-givers who gave upall claim to political power: an ancient embodiment of the separation of the leg-islative and judicial departments of government from the executive. Hindu reli-gious beliefs were upheld as supremely rational and moral; Sir William Jones, forinstance, wrote in a letter of 1787:I am no Hindu but I hold the doctrine of the Hindus concerning the future stateto be incomparably more rational, more pious and more likely to deter men fromvice than the horrid opinions inculcated by the Christians on punishment withoutend. (Mukherjee 1968: 119)This liberal view was opposed by an evangelical view which is expressed in anextreme form by the pioneer Scots Presbyterian missionary in India, AlexanderDuff (1806–78):Of all the systems of false religion ever fabricated by the perverse ingenuity of fallenman, Hinduism is surely the most stupendous. (Majumdar 1965: 155)Missionaries were banned from the East India Company’s territories until 1813,when evangelical pressure in Parliament forced a change. However, the BaptistMissionary Society, founded in 1792, had a base in the Danish colony ofSerampore, near Calcutta, from 1800, and other missionary societies soonfollowed. A view of Hinduism as evil helped to raise funds for the societies inBritain; it also followed from an extreme Protestant interpretation of the doc-trine of the Fall, in which all religion outside the Christian revelation is a productof human endeavor, and therefore inherently sinful.The evangelical view of Hindu degeneracy was partly matched by theutilitarian one. This found an influential advocate in one of the foremostUtilitarians, James Mill, whose History of British India, first published in 1817,included a condemnation of Hindu culture. But whereas evangelicals consid-ered that Hindu society could only be reformed through conversion toChristianity, Utilitarians believed that it was the duty of governments to reformsociety through education and legislation. In practice the two groups, both ofmodernity, reform, and revival513"},{"pageNumber":520,"pageContent":"which had followers among the Company’s officials (including Bentinck andGrant, already mentioned), often worked together. The missionaries put much oftheir effort into secular education, believing that the enlightened mind wouldnaturally gravitate to Christianity (Laird 1972). They also supported campaignsfor legislation in social matters. Most notably, the Baptist missionary WilliamCarey was one of the foremost advocates of legislation banning sahamaran.a, theburning of wives on the funeral pyres of their husbands, and his arguments,together with those of the Hindu pandit Mr.tyuñjay Vidya ̄lam.ka ̄r, the Hindureformer Rammohun Roy, and numerous officials, led the utilitarian Governor-General Lord Bentinck to introduce such legislation in 1829. (The woman whoso burns herself, in principle voluntarily, is not regarded as a widow in the ter-minology of dharma. By accompanying her husband into the other world, shebecomes a satı ̄, meaning a true or good woman. The term satı ̄, often in the olderspellingsuttee, was applied in English to the practice as well as the person; theSanskrit term is sahamaran.a“death together.”)Thus groups which differed widely in their credal foundations could cooperateon issues of social reform. A practice such as sahamaran.acould appear to an evan-gelical as evidence of the Hindus’ need of the gospel, to a utilitarian as calling forpunitive legislation, and to a pandit as calling for a more accurate interpretationof the S ́a ̄stras, while to Rammohun it showed the evil effects of idolatry. Socialreform became a topic for debate throughout the nineteenth century; its targetsranged from the fate of wives on the death of their husbands, to the proper formof dress for women. The agenda of social reform was set by an interactionbetween the actual state of Hindu society and the various ideologies of thereformers. It therefore changed in the course of its history, as we shall see. Themovements which are loosely called orthodox or conservative arose as consciousresponses to particular reform movements: the first such movement, the DharmaSabha ̄ in Calcutta, was formed to oppose legislation prohibiting sahamaran.a,while the Bha ̄rat Dharm Maha ̄ Man.d.al (“great society for Indian dharma”) wasformed in the Panjab in 1887 to defend image-worship and the position of Brah-mans against the A ̄rya Sama ̄j (Jones 1976: 109–11). Orthodoxy or conser-vatism, like reform, was a construct formed in a historical context.Early Nineteenth-century CalcuttaThe new influences first took effect in Calcutta, the capital. The British presencehad encouraged the growth of a class known as bhadralok(literally “goodpeople”), who gained their wealth from new opportunities for employment andcommerce, and came to dominate education and the professions. The ethnicallydiverse population of Calcutta included incomers from many parts of India andbeyond, outnumbering and marginalizing its indigenous population (Sinha1978; Killingley 1997); the bhadralok, who were equally incomers, were BengaliHindus of high caste. Besides Brahmans, they comprised Vaidyas, traditionally514dermot killingley"},{"pageNumber":521,"pageContent":"physicians, who rank themselves next to Brahmans, and Ka ̄yasthas, tradition-ally clerks, who claim Ks.atriya origin (Killingley 1991: 16). Being highly con-scious of their caste status, and sensitive to accusations of having forfeited it by taking up new occupations and consorting with foreigners, many of thebhadralokwere meticulous about ritual purity, and lavish over rituals and patron-age of Brahmans. Many of them also eagerly took up the opportunities for com-munication represented by printing, the use of English, the growing educationsystem, and a new fashion for forming societies.One such society was formed by Rammohun Roy (1772?–1833; the name issometimes spelled Ram Mohan Roy or Ray), the first notable Hindu to involvehimself in the new forms of communication. He founded newspapers in Bengaliand in Persian (which was a language of culture for Hindus as well as Muslims).He published books in Bengali and English which attracted favorable notice over-seas and controversy at home, and he corresponded with writers in Britain andthe United States.Rammohun’s interests covered political and legal matters, education, andreligion. He believed that each religious tradition had a core of truth consistingof belief in God and a humanitarian morality, but that each tradition had over-laid this core with unnecessary or even pernicious doctrines and rules of prac-tice. In Hinduism – he was probably the first Hindu to use the word, in 1816 –one of his targets was “idol-worship – the source of prejudice and superstition,and of the total destruction of moral principle” (Roy 1906: 21). Another wasthe elaboration of ritual, which he claimed was promoted by Brahmans for theirown profit. He claimed, however, that the rational worship of one formless God,without the use of images or rituals, was authorized by the Upanis.ads. It wasthus quite possible to reject image-worship and other rituals and yet remain aHindu, because “the doctrines of the unity of God are real Hinduism, as that reli-gion was practised by our ancestors, and as it is well known at the present dayto many learned Brahmins” (Roy 1906: 90).To promote this “real Hinduism,” Rammohun published Bengali and Englishtranslations of some Upanis.ads, and the Ve d a ̄nta-Su ̄traorBrahma-Su ̄tra(see PartII in this volume), following S ́an.kara’s commentaries in the main, but departingfrom them at crucial points (Killingley 1993: 95–9). He also published contro-versial tracts in which he supported his views with quotations not only from theUpanis.ads and Ve d a ̄nta-Su ̄trabut from the Pura ̄n.as, Tantras, and other Sanskrittexts. From 1815 to 1830, when he lived in Calcutta and wrote most of his pub-lications, he led a society which was at first known as the A ̄tmı ̄ya Sabha ̄(“friendly society”); in 1828 it was given a more formal shape as the Bra ̄hmoSabha ̄ or Bra ̄hmo Sama ̄j.Bra ̄hmois an English spelling of the Bengali wordbra ̄hmyaorbra ̄hma(these two spellings are pronounced alike), meaning literally“belonging to Brahman,” this being Rammohun’s preferred name for God.Members of the Sama ̄j often translated bra ̄hmaas “theist,” and called the Bra ̄hmoSama ̄j the Theistic Society. From Rammohun’s time the Bra ̄hmos had links withthe Unitarian movement in Christianity, which denies the doctrine of the Trinity(Lavan 1977; Kopf 1979). Rammohun’s followers were also known as Veda ̄ntı ̄smodernity, reform, and revival515"},{"pageNumber":522,"pageContent":"or Veda ̄ntists (Killingley 1993: 103), since he based his teachings on AdvaitaVeda ̄nta, often called simply Veda ̄nta.Rammohun attacked not only Hindu beliefs and rituals but the moral evilsthat he believed resulted from them. Besides sahamaran.a, these included poly-gyny, infanticide, the placing of the dying in the Ganges, and caste discrimina-tion. Other societies had other aims. The Dharma Sabha ̄, already mentioned, was formed in 1830 to oppose legislation against sahamaran.a, and any otherinterference with Hindu practice. One of its founders, Ra ̄dha ̄ka ̄nta Deb(1783–1867), was at the same time active in promoting some of the samecauses as Rammohun, particularly education, including the education of girls;another, its secretary Bhava ̄n.ı ̄caran.Banerjee, had edited a Bengali newspaperfounded by Rammohun. The Bra ̄hmo Sama ̄j and the Dharma Sabha ̄, like othersocieties in nineteenth-century India, cannot be understood in terms of a simpleopposition of reform and reaction; each of them was negotiating a way of beingHindu in the modern situation.Opposed to both was “Young Bengal,” a name which embraces many soci-eties of young men, some still in their teens, which met in the 1830s and 1840sto put Indian society to rights in the light of utilitarian and other rationalisticideas. Some of these men openly renounced Hinduism, and flouted its rules ofpurity. Such attitudes flourished especially among the pupils of the youngEurasian teacher and poet Henry Derozio (1809–31), who was dismissed fromthe Hindu College, the leading English-medium school in Calcutta, on a chargeof corrupting Hindu youth and teaching atheism. One such pupil, KrishnaMohan Banerjea, was converted by Alexander Duff into the Presbyterian churchin 1832 but was later ordained as an Anglican priest. Others remained rebelHindus, proclaiming their rebellion by eating beef and drinking alcohol.The Bra ̄ hmo Sama ̄jIn 1843 the Bra ̄hmo Sama ̄j was reorganized by Debendrana ̄th Tagore(1817–1905) around a “Bra ̄hmo Covenant” in which members undertook toworship one God and to renounce idolatry. Debendrana ̄th’s idea of God was influ-enced by his English education at the Hindu College, and he was sensitive toWestern-inspired critiques of Hinduism. One such critique appeared in 1845 intheCalcutta Review, edited at that time by Duff, under the title “Veda ̄ntism; – whatis it,” professing a utilitarian standpoint but clearly based on evangelical theol-ogy. It accuses Rammohun of whitewashing Veda ̄nta (meaning Advaita Veda ̄nta,as was usual at the time), and denounces it as a form of pantheism which lacksan idea of God’s love, arrogantly identifies the self with God, denies the reality ofthe world, leaving no lasting value to moral action, and offers virtual annihila-tion as the final goal. This critique provoked debate within the Sama ̄j, andeventually Debendrana ̄th distanced himself from Veda ̄nta and sought a theologygrounded in the Vedas which was not liable to these accusations.516dermot killingley"},{"pageNumber":523,"pageContent":"Here he found insuperable difficulties. In the modern situation Vedic textswere becoming accessible, even to non-Hindus, through printed editions, trans-lations, or descriptions; and it was becoming apparent that they spoke of manygods and of elaborate rituals for their worship. Already in 1833 Krishna MohanBanerjea had attacked Rammohun’s Veda ̄nta, albeit using very imperfect know-ledge, partly on the grounds that it was incompatible with the actual Vedas(Banerjea 1833). In the 1840s Duff took up the same argument, driving a wedgebetween Debendrana ̄th, who wanted to believe in the literal truth of the Vedas,and his rationalistic associate Akshoy Kumar Datta. In 1850 Debendrana ̄threluctantly abandoned the Vedas as his authority; he soon abandoned textualauthority altogether, in favor of “the pure heart, filled with the light of intuitiveknowledge” (Tagore 1916: 161; Rambachan 1994).The Bra ̄hmo Sama ̄j took a new direction when Keshub Chunder Sen(1838–84) joined in 1858. Debendrana ̄th was a Brahman, whose fatherDwarkanath Tagore was one of the wealthiest of the bhadralok; Keshub was aVaidya who earned his living in a bank. Nevertheless, Debendrana ̄th became likea father to Keshub, and in 1862 made him an a ̄ca ̄ryaof the Sama ̄j.A ̄ca ̄rya, a Sanskrit word meaning “teacher,” was the term used for the Brahmans whoexpounded Sanskrit texts and led worship in the Sama ̄j. The abandonment ofSanskrit texts as authorities, and the appointment of Keshub, a non-Brahman,changed the nature of the acaryas; they were referred to in English as “minis-ters,” and Keshub wore a black gown like a British nonconformist minister. Healso insisted that, whether Brahmans or not, they should not wear the sacredthread which was the mark of Brahman status.The group of younger Bra ̄hmos who gathered round Keshub wished toabolish caste distinctions; they promoted intercaste marriage, interdining andthe abandonment of the sacred thread. They tended to identify reform with the adoption of Western ways of thinking and behavior; and while they sawBra ̄hmoism as a bulwark against Christianity, they emulated the missionaries’self-denying zeal for their faith, opening branches of the Sama ̄j outside Calcutta,and refuges for young men and women who had broken with their families overreligious practice. They also wished the Sama ̄j to be directed by a representativebody rather than an unelected leader. All these points separated Keshub fromDebendrana ̄th, who envisaged a movement rooted in Hindu tradition and fittingintobhadraloksociety rather than separating itself from it. In 1866, after an inci-dent in which Debendrana ̄th allowed Brahman a ̄ca ̄ryas to wear the sacredthread, the Sama ̄j split, and the majority joined Keshub in a new organization,the Bra ̄hmo Sama ̄j of India. Tagore’s party, consisting mainly of his relatives andfriends, became known as the A ̄di (“original”) Bra ̄hmo Sama ̄j.Keshub went on lecture tours, demonstrating his commanding rhetoric, hisdevotional enthusiasm, and the power of steam travel and the English languageto spread ideas throughout India and beyond; in 1870 he visited England. Hismessage was that God was to be found not in “the dry wells of ancient traditionsand outward symbols” but in “the deep fountain of divine revelation” (Scott1979: 75); and revelation could only be apprehended by spiritually sensitivemodernity, reform, and revival517"},{"pageNumber":524,"pageContent":"persons. He was such a person; so too were his hearers, if they would open them-selves to God’s inspiration as he exhorted them to do. This spiritual awakeningwould be the key to social reform. His success depended on his audiences’ know-ledge of English, and on other forms of knowledge which came with an Englisheducation, enabling them to recognize his references to the Bible, English liter-ature, European history and contemporary philosophers. Keshub used ideasfrom Christian theology, including Jesus himself, for whom he expressed afervent devotion. Jesus, he pointed out, was an Asiatic, and Asiatics were betterable than Europeans to understand him (Scott 1979: 64). This argument, whichexploited the English habit of referring to Indians as Asiatics, gratified national-istic sentiment by taking Jesus out of the hands of the missionaries and placinghim in those of Hindus.Keshub’s emphasis on individual intuition of God made him indifferent toreligious traditions; it is impossible to identify him as a Hindu or a Christian,because he interpreted doctrines such as the atonement or avata ̄rain his ownway. This opened him to the charge of arbitrariness, and some of his followersobjected to his acceptance of doctrines and practices which Bra ̄hmos hadrejected as idolatrous; around 1875 he became an admirer of the uncouth sage Ramakr.s.n.a (1836–86), who despised Bra ̄hmoism and social reform. AsKeshub’s interest in Hindu traditions increased, his zeal for social reform seemedto wane, and like Debendrana ̄th he was judged autocratic.The incident which brought these concerns together was the marriage ofKeshub’s daughter in 1878 to the crown prince of Cooch Behar, a state underindirect British rule. She was 13 and the prince 15 (Borthwick 1977: 180); theritual included elements which Bra ̄hmos condemned as idolatrous, and poly-gyny was traditional in the family. The intention of the British officials whoarranged the marriage was to bring modernity into an underdeveloped state(Borthwick 1977: 174–8), and this was successful (Kopf 1979: 328f.); but tomany Bra ̄hmos it was a betrayal of their struggle against child marriage and idol-atry, and showed an arrogant disregard of their views. Rejecting Keshub’s lead-ership, they formed a more democratic organization, the Sa ̄dha ̄ran.(“general”)Bra ̄hmo Sama ̄j, in 1878. In 1881, Keshub formed his remaining followers intothe Church of the New Dispensation, which was more interested in worship andspiritual experience than in social reform.The example and missionary effort of the Bra ̄hmo Sama ̄j, particularlyKeshub’s tours, led to similar societies being formed elsewhere. The most influ-ential was the Pra ̄rthana ̄ Sama ̄j (“prayer society”) in Bombay. The situation inBombay Presidency was very different from that in Bengal: British power wasestablished later and more quickly, from 1800 to 1818, and followed a more con-certed policy. High positions were given to Indians, most of whom were of theChitpavan Brahman caste which had run the Maratha empire which the Britishhad conquered. They and other Hindus took up English and Western learningeagerly, while continuing also to write in Marathi. The Pra ̄rthana ̄ Sama ̄j, avoid-ing the problems over tradition and authority which split the Bra ̄hmo Sama ̄j,showed its continuity with the past by using the Marathi poems of Tuka ̄ra ̄m andother bhakti saints in its worship.518dermot killingley"},{"pageNumber":525,"pageContent":"Social ReformOne of the points which distinguished the Bra ̄hmo Sama ̄j of India from the A ̄diBra ̄hmo Sama ̄j, and in turn distinguished the Sa ̄dha ̄ran.Bra ̄hmo Sama ̄j from theChurch of the New Dispensation, was zeal for social reform. The main areas ofconcern were caste and the position of women; each of these involved severalissues.Discussion of caste in the twentieth century has centered on the privileges of higher castes, the oppression of lower castes, and the economic disparitiesbetween them. Many nineteenth-century discussions dwelt more on the divi-sions among the higher castes, and restrictions on their conduct. In the Bra ̄hmoSama ̄j, the movements to discard the sacred thread, to allow intercaste marriage,and to encourage interdining were aimed not so much against caste privilege asagainst the division within the bhadralokbetween Brahmans, Vaidyas, andKa ̄yasthas. Caste also meant pressure to follow rules of purity which were espe-cially irksome to those members of the higher castes who were most affected bymodernity; relaxation of such rules provided a middle way between the osten-tatious observance of purity by many of the new urban class, and the ostenta-tious rejection of it by Young Bengal.Use of the word castecan give a misleading impression that we are talkingabout a single phenomenon, or even a system inherent in Hindu society. It isbetter to think of it as a cover term for a number of phenomena which may vary from region to region, and are constantly open to change. The situation inBengal, where elite status is shared between brahmins, Vaidyas, and Ka ̄yasthas,is different from that in Maharashtra or Tamil Nadu, where there is a clear divi-sion between brahmins and those below them, and another between Dalits (seeQuigley in this volume) and those above them. The modern situation in someways rigidified caste identity: the use of caste titles became more widespread inthe early nineteenth century, while increasing contact between communities,and the British attempt to codify Hindu law, brought matters which had beenthe preserve of specialists into the arena of public debate (Bayly 1999: 94, 168).In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the methods and theoriesof physical anthropology with which the British reinforced the boundarybetween Indians and themselves, and classified Indians into hereditary typeswith different abilities, were also used by Hindu theorists to justify caste divi-sions. At the same time, the increasing accessibility of the Sanskrit traditionfacilitated the discussion of caste issues in terms of dharma.Dharma literature says far less about caste than it does about varn.a, the the-oretical division of society into Brahman, Ks.atriya, Vais ́ya, and S ́u ̄ dra. The firstof these categories can be identified, in any given region, with a particular groupof castes, since in Hindu society the boundary between Brahman and non-Brahman is usually clear, though not always undisputed. It is harder to identifyany of the other three divisions with a group of castes, since castes which claimto be Ks.atriya or Vais ́ya may be regarded by others as S ́u ̄ dra (see Quigley’schapter in this volume). When writers discuss caste in terms of dharma, modernity, reform, and revival519"},{"pageNumber":526,"pageContent":"therefore, they do so in theoretical terms which may not be easily related to therealities of caste in the region where they live.In south India, the most fiercely contested intercaste issue was between theDalits and the rest. The boundaries were clearly marked, socially, ritually, andspatially: members of Dalit castes had to keep a certain distance from others, andnot walk on the same road. When economic advancement encouraged a low-caste group to transgress these boundaries, fighting broke out; another possibleoutcome was a mass religious movement. Such movements include the conver-sion to Christianity of many of the Nadar caste, first by Jesuits in 1680, and laterby Anglicans from 1784 onwards (Jones 1989: 156–60). The traditional occu-pation of the Nadars is to tap juice from palmyra palms and ferment it into aliquor known as toddy; their economic dependence on this disreputable trade,and their personal dependence on toddy, justify their low status in the eyes ofhigher castes, while the Christian Nadars set great importance on abstinence. Acaste of similar status and occupation, the Izhavas of Kerala, was transformedby a movement initiated by one of its members, Na ̄ra ̄yan.a Guru (1854–1928).This too sought independence from toddy, but it was also a Sanskritizing move-ment, using Advaita Veda ̄nta to show that caste is not essential to a person (Jones1989: 179–82, 203–7; Samuel 1977).The most radical attack on caste using arguments from the Sanskrit traditionwas made by Daya ̄nanda Sarasvatı ̄ (1825–83). Daya ̄nanda was a Brahman fromKathiawar in Gujarat, but spent much of his life wandering as a sam.nya ̄sin overnorth India; the A ̄rya Sama ̄j, which he founded in 1875, had its greatest successin the Panjab, a region where Brahman authority was weak. Though he learnedfrom pandits, knew no English, and appealed to the Veda as his authority, he wasinfluenced by modern ideas, especially after a visit to Calcutta in 1872 (Jordens1978: 75–98). He denounced the worship of images and elaborate rituals, andtaught the worship of one God through homa, the Vedic offering of ghi and plantproducts in a fire. He aimed to restore the practices of the ancient A ̄ryans (hencethe name of his society); people should therefore be divided not into hundredsof castes but into the four varn.as known in the Veda. Moreover, membership ofthe varn.as should not be hereditary, but should be decided by public examina-tion at the age of 16 for girls and 25 for boys (Sarasvatı ̄ 1972: 87). Onintermarriage and interdining, Daya ̄nanda was conservative: they should beprohibited between the true, nonhereditary varn.as (Killingley 1991: 27f.). Hisproposals have never been put into practice, but the idea of four varn.as, basedon merit and not birth, has become generally accepted in modern Hindu dis-course (Killingley 1991: 30f.).Reform of the position of women again involved several issues. After sahama-ran.awas made illegal, attention focused on the situation of widows. Accordingto the dharma books widowers can remarry, but a woman can only be one man’swife; and since girls could be married at five or even younger, they could becomewidows at any age. A widow, being neither an actual nor a potential wife, wasa person without status, an unwanted burden on her marital family. The voicewhich was heard most clearly on this subject was that of I ̄s ́varcandra Vidya ̄sa ̄gar520dermot killingley"},{"pageNumber":527,"pageContent":"(1820–91), a pan.d.it who was a close associate of Debendrana ̄th Tagore. LikeRammohun’s against sahamaran.a, his arguments were both textual and human-itarian; the outcome was the Widow Remarriage Act of 1856. I ̄s ́varcandra was also among those who attacked polygyny, which was widely practiced byBrahmans in Bengal; but this attack did not lead to legislation.Another issue was child marriage, in particular the early marriage of girls.This was common among upper castes in many parts of India, and was opposedby the Bra ̄hmo Sama ̄j, the Pra ̄rthana ̄ Sama ̄j, Daya ̄nanda, I ̄s ́varcandra, andothers. In 1860 the first relevant legislation, affecting not marriage but con-summation, set the age of consent for girls at ten. Renewed controversy, height-ened by the death of a girl of eleven in Calcutta in 1890, led to the raising of theage to 12 in 1891. The law was controversial but ineffective, as was the ChildMarriage Restraint Act of 1929, which set the ages of marriage at 14 for bridesand 18 for bridegrooms (Forbes 1996: 83–90).While the government was wary of prohibiting any Hindu custom, it wasmore ready to pass permissive laws if there was demand for them, as shown by the Widow Remarriage Act. Another example is the Marriage Act of 1872.This was passed in response to demands from the Bra ̄hmo Sama ̄j for a legallyrecognized form of marriage which disregarded caste, was monogamous and didnot involve idolatry; the bride had to be at least 14 and the bridegroom 18. Toavoid attempting to define Bra ̄hmos as a community, the legislators required theparticipants to declare that they were not Hindus – nor Buddhists, Christians,Jains, Muslims, or Parsis (Kopf 1979: 103–5). This law was part of the back-ground to the Cooch Behar marriage (p. 518 above): although the marriage didnot contravene it, since the Act did not apply in a princely state, it betrayed theprinciples underlying it.These movements to improve the condition of women were the work of men,and treated women as passive rather than active. They were partly prompted bythe view of James Mill and others that ill-treatment of women indicated a lowdegree of civilization (Forbes 1996: 13). While the male reformers had genuineregard for women as persons, they also thought of them in terms of their pro-creative and nurturing roles: child marriage was condemned as pernicious tothe health of (male) offspring. Women’s education could be a way of furtheringthe concerns of men, whose efforts at reform were hampered by the conser-vatism of their wives and mothers. A Bengali wrote in 1848:An educated native who is even at the head of his family is connected with poojah[pu ̄ja ̄, worship of images] which he under the existing state of Society cannotremedy and thinks it expedient for preserving domestic happiness to perpetuate itso long as education is denied to our females. (Palit 1972: 67)It was not until the end of the nineteenth century that women themselvesbecame public champions of reform (Forbes 1996).There was also a caste dimension to gender issues which the reformers tendedto ignore. As the Bengali preacher Swa ̄mi Viveka ̄nanda (1863–1902) put it,modernity, reform, and revival521"},{"pageNumber":528,"pageContent":"All that you mean by your social reform is either widow remarriage, or femaleemancipation, or something of that sort. . . And again these are directed withinthe confines of a few of the castes only. (Viveka ̄nanda 1972–8: 5, 333).The issue of widow remarriage did not affect the lower castes, among whomwidows traditionally remarried; while interdining and intercaste marriage, aswell as female education, were mainly concerns of the bhadralok. Viveka ̄nandaconsidered that effective social reform could only be built on a spiritual basis ofAdvaita Veda ̄nta. The identity of the self and Brahman, he said (echoing PaulDeussen, the German interpreter of Advaita), was “the basic metaphysical truthunderlying all ethical codes” (Viveka ̄nanda 1972–8: 1, 385; cf. Hacker 1995:292–8; Killingley 1998: 145–9). Hindus did not need alien moral norms.Re-presenting the PastWe have seen how Rammohun and I ̄s ́varcandra questioned prevailing customsby reference to ancient Sanskrit texts. In 1891, during the age of consent con-troversy, M. G. Ranade (1842–1901) and R. G. Bhandarkar (1837–1925), bothmembers of the Pra ̄rthana ̄ Sama ̄j, opposed the early marriage of girls by showinghow the age prescribed for a girl’s marriage had been progressively lowered inthe course of history (Ranade 1902: 26–52; Bhandarkar 1928: 538–83). Wehave also seen how Daya ̄nanda used texts to argue that the ancient A ̄ryans prac-ticed nonhereditary varn.a. Those who opposed reform also appealed to the past;but as Ranade (1902: 170) put it, “When we are asked to revive our old insti-tutions and customs, people seem to me to be very much at sea as to what it isthey seek to revive.” Ranade and others used a consciously selective approach tothe past, guided by “the voice of God in us” (Ranade 1902: 174). Bhandarkarsaw the past as a progressive revelation to which the Vedic sages, Buddhism, theGı ̄ta ̄, and the bhakti tradition had each contributed (Bhandarkar 1928: 615f.).Another Chitpavan Brahman, B. G. Tilak, used textual study, astronomy, andgeology to argue that the Vedas were composed in 4,000 or even 8,000 bce(Wolpert 1962). His reading of history, like Daya ̄nanda’s, pointed to the Vedasas records of an ancient and divinely ordained culture. Unlike him, however, hepresented the Brahmans as the heirs and guardians of that culture. Tilak alsoextolled the seventeenth-century Maratha king S ́iva ̄jı ̄ as a Ks.atriya protector andpatron of the Brahmans, and hinted that resistance to British rule was a dutywhich Hindus owed to his memory.A very different history of Brahman and Ks.atriya was presented by JotiraoPhooley (or Phule, 1827–90), a member of the non-Brahman Maratha peas-antry. In Phule’s narrative the Brahmans had invaded India, seized the land fromits rightful owners the ks.atriyas, and attempted to destroy them as recorded inthe myth of Paras ́ura ̄ma (see Matchett’s chapter 6 above). They enslaved the sur-vivors by inventing the caste system, classifying them as S ́u ̄ dras. S ́iva ̄jı ̄ was the522dermot killingley"},{"pageNumber":529,"pageContent":"champion of the indigenous non-Brahman against the alien Brahman, and hisrole as protector was now taken by the British. Phule thus combined a commonmythical motif in which low castes claim to be descended from Ks.atriyas whowere cheated of their status, with the Indologists’ narrative of an A ̄ryan inva-sion (O’Hanlon 1985: 141–51). The view of the Brahman as an alien oppressorwas taken up and elaborated by the Tamil anti-Brahman movement in the twen-tieth century, which was able to point to a 2,000-year-old Tamil literatureindependent of Sanskrit.Religious and SecularIn the course of the modern period, movements to reform Hindu society becamemore varied, and leaders emerged among oppressed groups as well as elites. Yetthere was general agreement that Hindu society must have roots in the past, andit must have a religious basis. The emphasis on the past refuted both those whothought reform could only come from the West, and those who thought it wasprecluded by an unchanging dharma. The emphasis on religion was naturalwhen so much criticism of Hindu society attributed its evils to religion, whilemost of the ancient literature which became accessible was religious, or usedreligious motifs. Keshub, Viveka ̄nanda, Ra ̄dha ̄krishnan and others promoted theidea that Indian culture was essentially spiritual, in contrast to the materialismof the West (King 1985).There are exceptions to this religious approach to reform. E. V. RamaswamyNaicker (1879–1973), leader of the Tamil anti-Brahman movement, denouncedbelief in God along with Brahmans and their texts and rituals; however, othersin the movement discarded these while retaining God. Apart from Ramaswamyand some extreme nineteenth-century Utilitarians, secular programs have come mainly from twentieth-century Marxists, and it is notable that many ofthese were Brahmans: M. N. Roy, D. D. Kosambi, E. M. S. Namboodiripad. TheMarxists, like others, used the past as an arena for the ideological contest; oneof their methods was to reclaim ancient Indian materialism, which they believedhad been deliberately forgotten in favor of a false picture of Indian spirituality(e.g. Chattopadhyaya 1968). Another Brahman secularist was JawaharlalNehru, whose book The Discovery of Indiais a personal reflection on the past andwhat it can say to the future; he too extols ancient Indian materialism, but alsotheBhagavad-Gı ̄ta ̄, Buddhism, and even S ́an.kara.

Ram-PrasadThe very idea of “political Hinduism” raises questions generally about the natureof religion and specifically about the nature of Hinduism. To say that Hinduismhas had a political role in twentieth-century India is already to say a good dealabout an elusive and diffuse phenomenon. This is because many of the develop-ments through the twentieth century that ostensibly were motivated by con-cerns of religion are arguably products of more general concerns about identity,ideological historiography, political power, and economic share. Few issuescovered in this chapter are obviously religious in content, if by “religious” wemean anything pertaining substantively to the attainment of transcendence, oreven a socio-ethic founded on commitment to transcendence. But to the extentthat this book attempts to deal with all that might be considered “Hindu,” thischapter focuses on developments in twentieth-century and contemporary Indiawhere politics was or has been affected by appeal to a certain reading of Hin-duism. (But only a certain reading: after all, Gandhi’s thought and action areincomprehensible without a consideration of their religious dimensions, but byno means can be integrated into the present topic.)This chapter is in three parts. The first part looks at the seminal formulationsof the concept of an essential Hinduness and its political implications for thenation-state of India. The second part looks at the unsuccessful history ofpolitical parties and organizations associated with the ideology of an essentialHinduness in independent India and the eventual electoral rise of the premierHindu nationalist party to (shared) power. The last part analyzes the experienceof Hindu nationalism in power and suggests that such experience says some-thing about both Hindu nationalism and the problems of power in a democraticIndia."},{"pageNumber":533,"pageContent":"The Formulation of “Hinduness”: Its Political and Cultural ConsequencesWhile issues of religion and culture are deeply implicated in the sociopoliticalthinking of nineteenth-century India (see Dermot Killingley’s chapter in thisvolume), a particular crystallization of Hinduism-based ideology occurred onthe margins of the Indian nationalist struggle. This ideology, in brief, attemptedto provide criteria for membership of a nation-state, India, through appeal tomembership of a historical tradition defined, through certain putatively essen-tial features, as the religion of “Hinduism.”The first nationwide move towards injecting a specific “Hindu” dimensioninto the political sphere came with the setting up of the Hindu Mahasabha (TheGreat Hindu Association) in 1915, which drew on existing Hindu Sabhas (asso-ciations) in different regions of British India. Initially, it was an organizationwithin the Indian National Congress. The Congress itself was a nonsectarian,pan-national political body, and the Mahasabha was founded to press, generally,for a greater orientation towards concerns identified as important to Hindus, andspecifically, for a Hindu counterweight to Muslim demands for quotas for newlycreated administrative and electoral positions. This lobby group later becamemore explicitly involved in political activity directed towards the attainment of a“Hindu nation”; for that, it required a systematic ideology, which was providedby Vinayak Damodar Savarkar.The formulation of HindutvaIt was Savarkar who, in 1923, gave substance to the neologism “Hindutva” orHinduness, in his book, Hindutva: Who is a Hindu?Unlike what the title by itselfmight suggest to a student of religion, the book was not about the doctrinalessence of a religion called Hinduism; it was not a contribution to that litera-ture, so standard in later twentieth-century academia, on the definition of a reli-gious tradition. It was the articulation of a certain form of nationalism. Savarkarargued that geography, race, and culture reveal a commonality, which he iden-tified as “Hindutva.” But the geography is not strictly territorial, being insteadthe ancestral homeland of a people, historically descended from a “race” calledthe “Aryans.” Nor is race a biogenetic category, for Savarkar is willing to acceptboth the original intermarriage of the Aryans with older native inhabitants andthe continuing absorption, through marriage and cultural adoption, of differ-ent peoples into Hinduism. So, the ultimate category for Hindutva is culture. Butthis culture is not, strictly speaking, religious, if by “religion” is meant a com-mitment to certain doctrines of transcendence. Savarkar himself does notprofess religious faith, and takes religion – in the form of “Hinduism” – to be onlya part of the larger “Hindu” culture; a distinction is usually maintained betweenHindu religion and the larger Hindu (or even Indic) culture. In all these matters,contemporary political hinduism527"},{"pageNumber":534,"pageContent":"Savarkar is keenly aware of irreducible diversity, be it in conceptions of sacredgeography, racial intermingling, or religious beliefs and practices. That is why heattempts to identify an essence, a commonality. Everything, then, comes downto understanding the essence of Hindu culture. But unfortunately, when identi-fying what is distinctly Hindu, he goes back to a religious concept: to be Hinduis to take India as the holy land. This is what distinguishes the Hindu from theChristian or the Muslim (although, on other counts, the possibility of Christiansand Muslims being “Hindus” is granted). This is difficult to follow through, sincethe concept of what is holy is itself a religious one, but the religion involvedderives its identity from a culture – which culture, exactly, Savarkar is attempt-ing to essentialize in the first place.Regardless of the intellectual coherence of his position, Savarkar articulatedthe idea that the nation could be construed in terms of Hinduness. Since Hindusdid, as a matter of fact, exist, an appeal to their identity as the foundation ofnationalism was possible even if exactly how that identity was determined in thefirst place was not clear.The political consequence of this formulation lay, however, not so much inwhat it tried to do for Hindus as in how it used Muslims (and Christians) for itsideological ends. Arguably, it was a certain perception of Muslims and (in theform of the British) Christians that motivated the enunciation of Hindutva.Savarkar’s call to Hindus to regain an ancient glory is explicitly premised on thatglory having been tarnished by an invasion of and the clash with Islam (and,later, the Christianity of Western imperialism). A renascent Hindu nation (sinceSavarkar is convinced that there was such an original nation) must solve theproblem of heterogeneity and diversity. That is to say, in order to create a Hindustate, the problems brought about by the presence of Islam and Christianity (ren-dered possible according to Savarkar only by the oppression of Hindus) must be solved. Such a solution might require the removal of alienness from Hindusociety, but must at least involve Muslim and Christian acceptance of Hindupublic culture in a nation-state. The coherence of any strategy to render IndiaHindu, then, requires recognizing the threat of Muslim and Christian othernessand dealing with it in a variety of uncompromising ways.Subsequently, Savarkar led the Mahasabha, and his skills in this regard seemedlikely to lead it to greater prominence. But the Congress was moving decisivelyinto ever-wider constituencies, and by 1937, the Mahasabha was excluded fromit, especially on charges of being “communal,” i.e., pursuing the concerns purelyof a religious community, rather than of all India. Thereafter, it had no realpolitical role to play in the last decade of the independence movement.The RSS and Hindu cultureHindutva, however, gained a very different sort of organized support than theoriginal involvement within the Indian National Congress might have suggested.Savarkar deeply influenced Keshav Baliram Hedgewar, who had learned various528c. ram-prasad"},{"pageNumber":535,"pageContent":"terrorist techniques before joining the Congress. Hedgewar left the Congressconvinced of the inefficacy of Gandhi’s peaceful “noncooperation” methodsagainst British rule, and in 1925 founded a nationalist organization called theRashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS, the Association of National[ist] Volun-teers). His organizational model was the militant and ascetic sects of medievaland early modern India. But while borrowing elements from them such asshared rituals, a paradoxically ascetic engagement with worldly affairs, andtight-knit patterns of sacred leaders and dedicated initiates, Hedgewar also bor-rowed Western principles of organization and representation. The RSS soughtto emulate what were perceived to be highly successful British (and European)forms of discipline, drill, and corporate spirit. Hedgewar’s organizational skillsand contacts with like-minded men from his sort of background (Maharashtrianbrahmins) built up the RSS, but its ideological development came withHedgewar’s successor, Madhav Sadashiv Golwalkar.Golwalkar provided a systematic articulation of the RSS’s ideological groundsand aims in his work of 1939, We, or Our Nationhood Defined. Golwalkar bothcaptured Hedgewar’s working vision of the RSS and went beyond it to present adistinctive ideology. He captured the most striking aspect of RSS ideology – itsconcern for a nation rather than a state. Of course, this was still concern for theculture of a Hindu nation. But where Savarkar had approached culture in rela-tion to a Hindu polity, Golwalkar approached it in relation to Hindu society. TheRSS’s primary aim was to foster within society those aspects of thought andconduct that would integrate and unite Hindus. Issues of state may follow, butthat was not the objective of the RSS.Like Savarkar, Golwalkar did not articulate the idea of Hinduness in termseither of territorially specific (as opposed to ancestral and sacred) geographicboundaries or of racial purity. He too sought to present what was essentiallyHindu as an organic culture, which had become weak and divided. But whereSavarkar’s aim had been to make explicit the underlying unity of Hindus in orderto create a political entity, the Hindu state (raj), Golwalkar claimed that the RSSwould work to realise a society true to the Hindu nation (rashtra). In the narrowsense of involvement in the public mobilization of opinion for the purposes ofaffecting and attaining institutional power in a polity, the RSS was not conceivedas a “political” organization. It did not involve itself in electioneering andrunning for office. It represented and still represents itself as a “cultural” organ-ization, working to bring back into the functioning of society those principlesthat, according to it, exemplify the attitudes and values of Hinduness. (But I amnot being evasive in not saying exactly what those attitudes and values are: it precisely is the conceptual problem for Hindutva ideology that it cannot list in any specific way what makes Hindus – and only they – essentially Hindus.Instead, there is the circular appeal to the beliefs and practices of a preexisting,albeit unreformed and disunited Hindu nation precisely in order to define thatvery Hindu nation.)Organizationally, the RSS was successful, although its success bred its ownlimitations and problems. In drawing on traditional forms of organizationscontemporary political hinduism529"},{"pageNumber":536,"pageContent":"focused on physicality, militancy, asceticism, and sectarian membership, the RSSprovided its own version of the ritually mediated Indian gymnasium, the akhara.At these gatherings, organized under the aegis of a more Westernized unit of control, the local branch (shakha), groups of men could train themselves,physically and morally, to become exemplars of “Hindu manhood,” under theguidance of teachers/preachers (pracharaks). (The gender dimension was notsystematically thought through, but rather an outgrowth of an unthinkingandrocentricism. As the ideological appeal of inducting women into the move-ment became clearer, a women’s wing [the Rashtra Sevika Samithi, the NationalCouncil of (Women) Workers] was formed without much justification regardinggender.) The RSS expressed a combination of martial and spiritual values thatdrew from the previous few centuries of experience amongst the brahmins andother upper-caste men of Maharashtra. This cultural appeal was compoundedby sociopolitical factors. The growth of the Congress was due to mass mobiliza-tion; and the involvement of and articulation of demands by other sections ofHindu society was as much a cause of unease amongst potential RSS men aswas Muslim political activity. Consequently, the model developed by the foundersof the RSS was attractive and recognizable amongst many groups of brahminand other upper-caste Hindu men in and around Maharashtra.The problem for the RSS was that it was founded with the aim of eventuallytransforming the whole nation while its cadres seemed to be drawn from anarrow caste and regional background. So the drive began to extend its appeal.The cultural background of its early members, however, never ceased to beinfluential, and the growth of the RSS was not a product of any change in itsideological character. The model of the teacher and the idea of disciplined accul-turation helped widen its appeal at least to other parts of North India whereyoung upper caste men could identify with the RSS. Not only has the RSS neverbeen able to have appeal across castes, but it has tended to be weak in SouthIndia, outside the areas of Karnataka state on the borders of Maharashtra.Where the RSS has drawn from traditionally disadvantaged backgrounds, it hasdone so because of the ambition of castes and individuals to improve their socialstatus through the emulation of the upper castes known as “Sanskritization.”Meanwhile, in the 1930s, the Hindu Mahasabha, which still based itself onthe narrow appeal of elite groups of royal families and upper-caste notables,could not mobilize itself as a political force of any electoral or strategic con-sequence. Specifically political concerns about the place of Hindus and Hinduculture in an independent Indian state were articulated much more influentiallyby the Hindu traditionalists within Congress. They attempted to reconcile theirfundamental sympathy for a more Hindu-oriented political dispensation withMahatma Gandhi’s determination to preserve harmony and equality betweenreligions. Whatever the inner tensions of Hindu traditionalism within Congress,it had the immense advantage of working institutionally within the electorallydominant Indian political force of that time, leaving the Mahasabha withoutscope for influence.530c. ram-prasad"},{"pageNumber":537,"pageContent":"Hindu Nationalism and the Politics of Independent IndiaPartition and its aftermathThe political impact of the growth of the RSS in the 1940s was magnified by theevents surrounding the birth of Independent India. The RSS, implicitly basingitself on the concept of a cultural “majority,” took a very different view ofHindu–Muslim differences than did the leaders of the Muslim League. But ironi-cally, both were opposed to the dominant Congress idea of an India for all reli-gions. The leaders of the Muslim League held that it would be impossible to havea single nation-state for all religions, and campaigned for the creation of a sepa-rate “Islamic state” of Pakistan. Hindu nationalists, and in particular, the RSS,equally disagreed with the concept of a state neutral (or equally tolerant)towards all religions. But they did not hold the Partition of India to be the solu-tion. They argued instead that India (by then defined by the borders of the BritishRaj, although in Hindutva theory it was a much larger and ideal entity, perhapsencompassing everything between Iran and Singapore) was already a Hindunation and should never be divided. Instead, all Muslims had to agree to partici-pate in a national life that, in some constitutive way, was Hindu. The renascenceof the nation would not consist only in the transformation of the attitudes andvalues of those who already counted themselves as Hindus. It would also requirethe recognition by both other native Indian religionists – Buddhists, Jains – andreligionists of the “alien” religions – Muslims, Christians – that they were, in acultural sense, Hindus. For this reason, the RSS implacably opposed the Parti-tion of India. Hindu nationalists could not reconcile themselves to Partition,when those from Congress who negotiated for Indian Independence – Gandhi,Nehru, Patel – finally and reluctantly consented to it because they recognizedthat the idea of a unified and religiously neutral state was unacceptable to theMuslim League and its supporters.With Partition, the political leadership within Congress showed potentiallydivergent attitudes to the emerging situation, based on different readings of therole of Hinduism in the Indian polity. Jawaharlal Nehru and others held thesecular position that (the now partitioned) India should be a country in whichthe state was neutral towards all religions and, if anything, supportive of theminorities so as to compensate for any natural domination that a majority Hindupopulation would have in the polity. Vallabhai Patel and others sympathetic toa Hindu traditionalist position argued in precisely the opposite direction: givena natural Hindu majority, the structures and processes of the state should reflectthat fact, so that the treatment of minorities, while having to obey all the dic-tates of legal equality and fairness, had to be derived from a Hindu position. Thisdivision was based on competing interpretations of Gandhi’s own balancebetween his Hindu beliefs and his acceptance of the equality of religions. AfterPartition, Gandhi refocused his expression of interreligious amity, from contemporary political hinduism531"},{"pageNumber":538,"pageContent":"opposition to Partition to harmony between India and Pakistan and between thereligious communities within India.The RSS and the Hindu Mahasabha had some affinity with the Hindu tradi-tionalists within Congress, and on occasion were invited into its fold. But theHindu traditionalists were still utterly loyal to Gandhi, whereas his morallyunflinching strategy of reaching out to Muslims after the death of his politicaldream of an undivided India profoundly alienated Hindu nationalists. (Therewere, however, some Hindu traditionalists who abandoned Congress to join theHindu Mahasabha, because they thought the Congress insufficiently resolute inits opposition to Partition.) Hindu nationalists saw this as the ceding of the goalof a Hindu India, although there were differences of opinion in the RSS and theMahasabha about how to treat the offer of rapprochement from Hindu tradi-tionalists within Congress. The potential for any development in such a direc-tion was severely damaged when a Mahasabha (and former RSS) member,Nathuram Godse, assassinated Mahatma Gandhi for his sympathetic attitude toMuslims. Nehru saw this against his reading of all forms of Hindu nationalismas essentially fascistic, and acted strongly by banning the RSS.In the years after Independence, Hindu nationalism was in a strange state. Onthe one hand, it had not only not got its demand for an undivided, Hindu India,but it had been implicated in the death of Gandhi. On the other, it not only hadaffinities with one wing of the utterly dominant Congress Party (and thereforesome scope for future political influence), but it seemed well placed to occupythat space in the political sphere open for sociocultural conservativism. Duringthe crisis caused by the issue of the treatment of Hindus in Pakistan (especiallyBengalis in East Pakistan), Hindu nationalists sought to take the high groundagainst what they saw as Nehru’s soft and weak strategy. But he acted decisivelyagainst their attempts to manipulate the political issue and build bridges withHindu traditionalists within Congress.The Jana Sangh and the dominance of Nehruvian secularismThere was no real growth in Hindu nationalism over the following two decades.The single most important reason was extrinsic to the Hindu nationalist organ-izations: the determination of Jawaharlal Nehru, India’s first Prime Minister, tofashion a polity and a politics that was not only secular in the formal Indiansense of state neutrality towards religions, but also “noncommunalist,” that is,strictly without any appeal to or role for religion-based identity in the public lifeof the nation-state. The Indian constitution that came into force in 1950 wasvery much a secular document, since many of its framers had views akin toNehru in this regard.The constitutional framework of Indian politics therefore made it difficult forthe Hindu Mahasabha to operate on its basic ideology of a Hindu nation. Anyexplicit electoral appeal to putative Hindu values seemed to run counter to thelegal concept of a polity in which religion was not a legitimate source of politi-532c. ram-prasad"},{"pageNumber":539,"pageContent":"cal identity. This difficulty was compounded by the fact that the other majoropposition groups, the Socialists and the Communists, were in total agreementon this framework with the Nehruvian Congress. In a more organizationalcontext, too, the Mahasabha was at a disadvantage; its lack of mobilizationalcapacity, its dependence on certain elite groups, its lack of grassroots support,all told against it everywhere but in certain strongholds in central India.Nehru was not only successful in constitutional terms, by making secularismthe norm of political activity. He was also successful within the Congress in bothlimiting the influence of Hindu traditionalist leaders, who may have had goalssimilar to the Hindu Mahasabha, and in developing a party system tied to amachinery of state-derived power and patronage that dissuaded even thoseunsympathetic to his ideals from leaving Congress.In sum, Hindu nationalism could not make any headway in the politics ofnewly independent India. But there was to be some hope for it in the formationof a new party, the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, although it came to very little in thefirst two decades of its existence. The history of the Jana Sangh and its rela-tionship to the RSS is important for what it tells us about the nature of Hindunationalism and the conditions that led to the eventual re-formation of the Jana Sangh as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). It was the BJP that eventuallygained a measure of success in using the appeal of religion to gain power ingovernment.S. P. Mookerjee, a Hindu traditionalist in Nehru’s original cabinet, foundhimself so much in disagreement with government policy, especially with regardto (Islamic) Pakistan, that he began to liaise increasingly with Golwalkar and theRSS. Eventually, he left to start the Jana Sangh. From the beginning, the rela-tionship between the explicitly party political Jana Sangh and the “cultural” RSSwas complicated. On the one hand, there was the consideration that by givingideological and – more directly – organizational support to a political party, theRSS could hope to transform society through the political process while itselfremaining outside of it. On the other hand, there was the more austere concernto remain untouched by political considerations in the pursuit of the ideal ofsociocultural transformation. Eventually, the continued marginalization ofHindu traditionalists within Congress seemed to Mookerjee to open up the pos-sibility of a Hindu nationalist opposition to Congress, and Golwalkar softenedhis suspicion of involvement with a political party.The formation of the Jana Sangh did not lead to any significant impact by Hindu nationalism on the Indian polity, because of the combination ofNehruvian strategies mentioned above and the sheer personal authority ofNehru in removing nonsecular alternatives from serious political influence.Mookerjee’s straightforward political aim of developing an alternative to theNehruvian conseus therefore did not succeed, and in any case was always seenat odds with RSS ideals. However, the search for immediate political impact was rejected by the Jana Sangh after 1954, under the leadership of DeedayalUpadhyaya. The Jana Sangh began to espouse, in effect, the RSS goal of anultimate transformation of the Hindu nation. Political activity was to be contemporary political hinduism533"},{"pageNumber":540,"pageContent":"confined to necessary and strategic engagement with specific issues and theoccasional electoral success.Upadhyaya developed his views on Hindu nationalism, and thereby codifiedthe Jana Sangh mission, in two books, The Two Plansand, more resonantly, Inte-gral Humanism. From the RSS (to which, as most of the subsequent Jana Sanghleadership, he belonged), he accepted the ultimate aim of a cultural transfor-mation of the nation, based on the organic notion of an existent Hindu societywith its own essential historical features and functions. But the explicit politicalaim, which was to be the Jana Sangh’s specific raison d’être, was the realizationof the Hindu nation within the state of India, through the transformation of allpolitical institutions from village to central government. However, such trans-formation, which would seem to require electoral success, was in fact going tobe achievable only through gaining more diffuse support in society as a whole.The process was an idealization: it was not that the Jana Sangh would gain powerthrough electoral success and then bring about social change; rather therewould first have to be social change before there could be electoral success. The Jana Sangh could only then set about attending to its specific tasks withinthe Hindutva movement, namely, the realization of Hindu principles within theinstitutions of the Indian state.This strategy had a profound effect on the way party political Hindu nation-alism developed. Adhering closely to the idea of (self-)disciplined organiza-tion espoused by the RSS, the Jana Sangh concentrated on the so-called sanghathanist strategy. Sangathanmeans “consolidation,” and the strategy wasmeant to focus on building disciplined cadres and inculcating Hindu values atthe grassroots. The contrast was with the conventional political model of elec-toral calculation, alliances, elite support, manifestos with explicit socioeconomicpromises, etc. The consequence of the sangathanist strategy was a sustainedcloseness between the RSS and the Jana Sangh, and lack of electoral success (forwhich the sangathan strategy offered idealized justification).Hindu nationalism through the 1950s and much of the 1960s found it diffi-cult to explicate a political position that made relevant use of the cultural argu-ments of Hindutva. This was primarily because of Nehru’s and, initially, IndiraGandhi’s refusal to allow any relaxation of the secularist framework of discourseand political contestation. The Jana Sangh had, instead, to engage through otheroppositional strategies, especially on the economy. Here, there seemed to be nodirect and obvious answer to the question of what economic model followedfrom Hindutva ideology. One wing of Hindu nationalism, which had an affinitywith the still existent Hindu traditionalist element in Congress, made the linkbetween cultural conservatism and economic liberalism. It saw not only aninstrumental reason to oppose Nehruvian socialist and dirigiste policies but alsoan ideological continuity between an organic conception of a society comprisedof different groups and an economic ideal of free activity. The other wing took the cultural conception of an organic society to involve commitment tosocial issues of development, which was to a certain extent compatible withNehruvian socialism. This tension has continued to beset Hindu nationalism.534c. ram-prasad"},{"pageNumber":541,"pageContent":"However, even the anti-free marketeers could find some disagreement withNehruvian socialism, because the latter concentrated on the essentially mod-ernist enterprise of creating an industrial economy, whereas the RSS type ofsocial development was focused (in a way oddly reminiscent of Gandhi) on theagrarian economy, with its ties to an ancient civilizational way of life.The first taste of power: the Janata PartyThe ideological tension within the Hindu nationalist fold gradually fed into atension over political strategy as well. In the face of the dominance of theNehruvian Congress, the Jana Sangh had, as mentioned, adhered to its RSS rootsof cultivating a cultural strategy on the ground, without overt concern for elec-toral success. But divisions within Congress opened up between Indira Gandhiand her older colleagues in the late 1960s, and the Jana Sangh was confrontedwith a choice. It could retain its old strategy or it could move in a more populistdirection to benefit from any possible re-alignment with Hindu traditionalistsopposed to Indira Gandhi.Populism brought its own difficulties, as was evident during the “cow protec-tion agitation.” The cow being considered sacred, Hindu nationalists had alwaysasked for legal provision against cow slaughter. In a bid to further their agenda,Hindu nationalists attempted to mobilize Hindu public opinion in the mid-1960sagainst the government’s refusal to allow for such provision. This includedappeal to Hindu religious organizations and holy men. Such a form of populismdrew on the ideological roots of sangathanist strategy, by mobilizing people onthe basis of cultural appeal to Hindu values. However, as violence resulted fromthe confrontation between demonstrators and the government, the Jana Sanghrealized that such populism hindered instrumental strategies aimed at forminga coherent opposition to Indira Gandhi’s Congress, because her other opponentswere at least uncomfortable and usually hostile to Hindu nationalist concernslike “cow protection.” So the Jana Sangh in Parliament had to try and buildbridges with anti-Indira Gandhi groups, and the agitation proved a failure.Indira Gandhi’s adroit use of Indian nationalist sentiment during and afterthe victorious war with Pakistan and the birth of Bangladesh in 1971 politicallymarginalized the Jana Sangh. However, her drift into authoritarian rule, endingin the declaration of an Emergency, in which political rights were suspended, ledto a recrudescence of Hindu nationalism. As legitimate leaders of the politicalopposition were jailed, the extralegal activity of the RSS, now led by anotherMaharahstrian brahmin, Balasaheb Deoras, had a chance to flourish. He ini-tially tried to cooperate with her but she had no immediate gain in doing so, andcontinued to target RSS workers as much as she did anyone else. The RSS thentraded on its old image as an organization willing to be exposed to politicaldanger and oppression. It became a focal point of resistance, organizing anti-governmental activity alongside socialists and others by drawing on a newmembership that was thrown, by Indira Gandhi’s actions, into undergroundcontemporary political hinduism535"},{"pageNumber":542,"pageContent":"opposition. When the Emergency ended and she boldly decided to go to thepeople on her record in the Emergency, a new political topography shaped up.The opposition to her had come from across the political spectrum and, indeed,had been the prime cause of her extreme and undemocratic reaction. JayaPrakash Narayan, the Gandhian reformer, had sought before the Emergency todevelop an idealistic oppositional front to Indira Gandhi. This value-based idealwas predictably transformed into a highly political strategy (although much tohis acknowledged discomfort). When the post-Emergency election was declared,an extraordinary political creature was born: the Janata Party, consisting ofthe Socialists, the Congress (the breakaway party of the 1960s), more recentCongress dissidents, some others – and the Jana Sangh.The Janata Party was to be the Jana Sangh’s means of entry into legitimatepolitical power, and as such, the latter accepted the terms of its participation inthe government the Janata Party formed after Indira Gandhi’s defeat.The RSS equivocally supported the Jana Sangh’s strategy of engaging in poli-tics with secularist parties. Its grassroots mobilization was crucial, but it refusedto formalize any amalgamation into the Janata Party, firmly asserting its self-conception as a cultural guide that stood “above” political activity. In any case,there were strong internal differences of opinion within the Janata Party aboutthe RSS, as the Socialist wing took the RSS to be against everything it stood for.This suspicion of the RSS was a feature of the Janata Party during its brief andunstable period in power.The point to note about Hindu nationalism’s first taste of national power was the extent to which its engagement with the political process depended onuneasy alliances with non-Congress parties. The same parties that, from the late1960s, had drawn Hindu nationalists into opposition to Indira Gandhi felt itmore rational to oppose them when power became an actuality. A commonenemy was insufficient, outside times of crises, to keep secularist parties alliedto Hindu nationalists, despite the claims of pragmatists within the Jana Sangh– like Atal Behari Vajpayee, External Affairs Minister in the Janata government– that they had set aside their original ideological goals in favor of the socialreform agenda of the Janata Party. By the time of the next election, IndiraGandhi’s use of secularism as an ideological counter-strategy had made non-Jana Sangh groups within the Janata Party appear antisecular – appearing tosubordinate them to Hindu nationalism. After electoral defeat, the break-up ofthe Janata Party was inevitable, for its internal contradictions were insuperable.The BJP and the Sangh ParivarIn 1980, the Jana Sangh refounded itself as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).This party was going to take a very different course through the Indian politicallandscape. The RSS under Deoras was emphatic that the Jana Sangh had failedin its strategy of integrating with other parties primarily because it had not keptits ideological purity, a purity that could take the party to political power only536c. ram-prasad"},{"pageNumber":543,"pageContent":"through a mobilization of Hindus for a religiocultural cause. From now on,political power would come only through unique Hindu nationalist strategiesaimed at a fundamental transformation of the attitude of Hindus towards thenature of the Indian polity. The RSS would be involved in this process becausegrassroots activity and cultural transformation were going to possible only if theBJP acted in accordance with the ideas behind its conception. This eventually ledto the radical strategies of the late 1980s and early 1990s; and they were radicalbecause Hindu nationalism combined, in that period, grassroots organization inthe traditional RSS manner with mass mobilization through the politicization ofHindu cultural identity. But this was not before the new BJP had attempted tomaintain some continuity with its predecessor.In the early 1980s, Indira Gandhi appropriated Hindu sentiments in herincreasingly extreme attempts to outflank all opposition. This included herdangerously confrontational treatment of the demand for a Sikh state in thePunjab, which ultimately led to her assassination. But Rajiv Gandhi, succeedingher on a wave of sympathy that brought Congress an unprecedented domina-tion in Parliament, also found it expedient to invoke Hindu imagery in hisattempt to secure support from sections of the Hindu population. The BJP’s“liberal” strategy of fighting on social and economic issues, therefore, was quiteunsuccessful, for it had abandoned its natural constituency and then found ittaken over by the Congress. (Indeed, in this period, the RSS occasionally pre-ferred Congress to the BJP in local disputes, as when it was challenged by theelectorally successful Communists in Kerala. There, Congress alone providedopposition and partially used communalization to secure upper-class Hinduvotes against the Communists.)Partially because of the lack of political success, the RSS revivified a differentorganization, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP, the World Hindu Assembly).This had been founded in the 1960s with the support of religious leaders likeSwami Chinmayananda, but had focused primarily on the teaching of Hindureligious beliefs. In the 1980s, it started developing as the activist arm of Hindunationalism, working with the RSS but expressing its Hindutva convictions inovertly political areas and in a political manner. Its strategy was exemplified indemonstrations and marches meant to articulate the idea of a united HinduIndia, covering places sacred in Hinduism and systematically conflating Hindusacred geography with Indian political unity.Then, for a variety of reasons (and when a late and unconvincing lurchtowards getting back Muslim votes led to his loss of Hindu votes as well), RajivGandhi’s Congress lost power to the new left-wing party, the Janata Dal. The BJP almost recreated the situation of ten years previously, going into an anti-Congress coalition; but only almost, for it did not join the government. To under-stand what the BJP then did, we must see what was happening with Hindunationalism in the 1980s.Through the decade, Hindu nationalist mobilization had proceeded almostagainst or independently of the BJP’s cautious and noncommunal parliamen-tary strategy. Hindu nationalism in this period became more focused and contemporary political hinduism537"},{"pageNumber":544,"pageContent":"organized than it had previously been. In 1981, the conversion of low-casteHindus to Islam in the Tamil village of Meenakshipuram has acted as a lightningrod for the alarmist tendencies of Hindu nationalism. Events like that could bepresented as an attack on Hinduism and therefore a threat to the very fabric ofIndia. Another rich source of threat perception was the illegal immigration ofMuslims from Bangladesh. Although the bulk of them went to the contiguousstates of West Bengal and Assam (where they interacted with other ethnic prob-lems), the political consequence was most felt in Bombay. There, the right-wingShiv Sena (the Army of Shiva), which had originally sprung up as a chauvinistMaharashtrian party targeting internal immigrants from south India, reposi-tioned itself as a Hindu nationalist party targeting Muslims. As with conversion,so with illegal immigration, the threat of an Islamic invasion of a Hindu land wasused as a cultural gloss on prevailing economic insecurities and tensions.The non-BJP organizations in the Hindutva family of organizations (theSangh Parivar), then, were busy developing a mobilizatory rhetoric. The funda-mental strategy was to interpret economic tensions in cultural terms, and con-flate the identities of culture and the nation-state. Muslims, it was argued, wereunfairly pampered by the secular nation-state, which was blind to the threatposed by them to its very existence. The ideal way to safeguard the nation-statewas to remove the threat, but that could be done only by those whose loyaltywas only to it; and they were the Hindus, whose nation, after all, India was. If,in that process, the resources of the state were redirected to Hindus, that wasonly fair and proper. Indira and Rajiv Gandhi recognized that targeting economicresources (jobs, places in educational institutions, other forms of preferentialtreatment) was an effective means of mobilizing key constituencies; hence theirconcern to express a Hindu identity. But whereas, in this period, the BJP’s par-liamentary caution allowed it to be outflanked, the other Hindu nationalistorganizations persisted with their strategy, hindered though they were by Con-gress’s actual control of economic resources. These organizations were workingfor the longer term. Also, when Rajiv Gandhi recognized the need to woo backMuslim voters after his flirtation with Hindu symbolism, the Hindu nationalistswere ready to welcome disaffected Hindus.Electoral Success and the Problems of PowerIn the late 1980s, the BJP faced a delicate task. Its strength would come elec-torally only through the grassroots mobilization undertaken by the rest of theSangh Parivar; and it was that very strength that would make it a worthwhileally in any anti-Congress alliance. But that alliance was to be with the Janata Dal,which was extremely hostile to Hindu nationalism; indeed, more so than the oldJanata Party, which had at least had old-style Hindu traditionalists at its core.In the elections of 1989, the BJP went into an agreement with the Janata Dal,but did not join the government formed after the defeat of Congress, merely offer-538c. ram-prasad"},{"pageNumber":545,"pageContent":"ing parliamentary support from outside. Calculations over parliamentary major-ity alone kept the Janata Dal in its relationship with the BJP, and the BJP bidedits time as part of an anti-Congress front without worrying its fellow organiza-tions in the Sangh Parivar.The Hindu nationalism of the rest of the Sangh Parivar, which the BJP wasnow acknowledging as successful in the mobilization of the Hindu vote, was ableto reinterpret basic socioeconomic concerns amongst a large section of thepopulation as a cultural issue, wherein lay its success. A small, but influentialurban elite was concerned to increase its wealth and power through access tothe instruments of state, in a way directly opposed by the Left parties (includingthe Janata Dal) and indirectly by the promiscuous and erratic populism ofCongress. The Hindu nationalists, by claiming that they would recast the stateas a traditional (if unspecified) Hindu organism, promised these aspirationalelites a dispensation in which they were likely to gain influence commensuratewith their perceived standing in traditional (caste) society. The larger group toappeal to, however, was the middle-class (and middle-caste) semi-urban groupscaught in the uncertainties of economic modernization – scarce public sectorjobs, a competitive educational market, erosion of agricultural certainties. Thisgroup had a perception of loss of access to economic wherewithal. Hindunationalists explained this as being caused by the unfair and threatening dis-crimination by the state in favor of Muslims – the very people who, by virtue ofhistory and transnational loyalties, were alleged to be least “deserving” of statalsupport. To both these groups, Hindu nationalist offered a Hindu state, in whichnatural, organic privileges would come to those who “belonged.”The crucial political achievement, however, lay not in this targeting, but inthe symbolization of Hindu identity for a Hindu state. Clearly, in order to drawupon the support of Hindus as Hindus, a definable conception of Hinduism asthe cultural essence of India had to be given; and this, as we will remember, wasthe concern of both Savarkar and Golwalkar. The success of Hindu nationalismin the late 1980s and early 1990s lay in presenting identifiable symbols of suchan essence. The most potent symbol the Hindu deity, Rama, and his supposedbirthplace, Ayodhya, in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.Ayodhya and the consequences of mobilizationRama has a long and complex history in Hinduism; but suffice it to say that,warrior though he is from the beginning, his divinization by the traditiondepends heavily on seeing him as the exemplar of compassion, forgiveness, andgentleness in the most extreme circumstances of war, conflict, and misfortune.In contrast, Hindu nationalism selectively reread him as a martial hero, a lop-sided guardian of cultural honor. They also took the Gandhian idea of a Utopian“rule of Rama” (ram rajya) as an age of balance, harmony, and peace, and re-fashioned it as the exemplification of a culturally pristine Hindu nation. Thusreread, the popular worship of Rama (mostly in north India) could become ancontemporary political hinduism539"},{"pageNumber":546,"pageContent":"already existent manifestation of Hindu nationalism. This process was helped,indirectly and largely unwittingly, by the simplistically refashioned but enor-mously successful television serialization of the Ramayanaby the state broad-casting corporation.This process of creating a political focus on a religious symbol would not haveworked without a specific means of relating the ideal of a Hindu nation to thethreatening reality of Islam; for the stigmatizing of Muslims was, as we haveseen, the obverse of the Hindu nationalist conception of a Hindu polity. To acertain extent, the present was potent enough – as the agitation over Muslimimmigrants from Bangladesh showed. But, despite militancy amongst someMuslim groups, especially those ideologically (and sometimes financially) linkedto transnational Islamic fundamentalism, the inescapable reality was of a largelydepressed community usually socially integrated into Indian society. So, therevivification of Hindu India had to come from history.Turning to an old concern going back to the 1940s, Hindu nationalists beganagitating for the reclamation of Hindu holy sites taken over by Islam in the past.Undoubtedly, it was the practice of some Muslim rulers to build mosques on thesite of destroyed Hindu temples; in Benares and elsewhere, this was the case.There was, in any case, the fundamental question of what significance to attachto these historical events in today’s multireligious and secular polity; but theHindu nationalists chose as their main target a more problematic site, a mosquein a small and nondescript village that bore the same name as Rama’s traditionalcapital, Ayodhya. That there had been a temple at all there was uncertain; thatthere was any local tradition associating the village with a traditional sacred sitewas uncertain; that Hinduism reads literal meaning into sacred geography isquestionable. But the connection between a mosque, a place-name resonantwith meaning to many Hindus, and a divinity with pan-Hindu appeal was irre-sistible. The start of the re-creation of a Hindu nation, then, was the liberationof Hindu holy places, and the first place, the most important, because commonto all Hindus, was to be Ayodhya. For this, the mosque had to be destroyed anda temple (re)built in its place.By 1990, an unsustainable division was emerging between the Janata Dal,led by Vishwanath Pratap Singh, and the BJP. The Janata Dal’s own populismwas targeted, in conventional Leftist fashion, at the economically weak sectionsof society – in India, those castes specified by the Constitution as either “Back-ward” or “Scheduled.” The proposal was to increase massively the reservationof educational seats for these castes. While the BJP was concerned not to an-tagonize potential voters amongst them, its own targeting was of different sec-tions of society, as we have seen. As agitation and counter-agitation over theproposed reservation policy spread across India, the BJP decisively swungtowards the Hindu nationalism propagated by the rest of the Parivar. The Pres-ident of the BJP, Lal Krishna Advani, who had been trained in the RSS, threwhimself into a plan of mobilization. He began a “pilgrimage of the chariot” (rathyathra) across the country. Ayodhya became the focus of Hindu nationalistmobilization. To destroy the mosque was to destroy the deleterious consequence540c. ram-prasad"},{"pageNumber":547,"pageContent":"of alien rule over a native Hindu land, to (re)build a temple on the site was toreclaim history itself for Hinduism.This campaign was calibrated in its rhetoric. It built up a series of appeals,through public meetings, repeated use of messages, the playing of tapes in publicplaces, and the association of sacred symbols and places with the Hindutvaconception of the nation. All this was meant to create and sustain an identitythrough psychoses. It cannot be said that the strategy was thought out inabstract terms. Rather, a direct and unquestioning connection was madebetween targeting Muslims and creating support amongst Hindus who werepotentially or already hostile to Muslims. But the actual process was, in its way,sophisticated. By heightening a sense of the alienness of an identifiable (minor-ity) group, the campaign would bring together those who shared that sense.From the negative identification of otherness would emerge a positive commonidentity, multiplied through the psychology of crowd agglomeration. This would,if sustained, convert into a longer-lasting support for the leaders of the mobi-lization. Such support could translate into electoral strength. But that sense ofthe alienness of Muslims, to be sustained for such ends, would inevitably requirea mass emotionalism, which would seek immediate and cathartic expression: inviolence. In short, violence appeared to be intrinsic to this method of mobiliza-tion. Even aside from the trauma of Partition, there has been communal clashesbetween Muslims and Hindus in India in the past, some extremely serious; butthis time its occurrence was a result of a political strategy, not due to a randomcollection of pressures.The mobilization proved successful on its own terms because it represented a concrete outcome as the first step of an abstract political process. It linked the vast ideological goal of a Hindu polity with a tangible act meant as historicalredress. Every expression of resentment over the Muslim role in India’s past andpresent could be articulated in the campaign to tear down a mosque and builda temple in its place. The formal sentiment of Hindu pride was given substancethrough a more diffuse exaltation of Hindu sacrality – the ahistoric importanceof Ayodhya had impressed itself on the minds of many Hindus. Some Hindusconsidered holy, either leaders or followers of various religious orders, under-took to support the movement.The demolition on December 6, 1992, was driven by a mixed body of mili-tants (especially those of the Bajrang Dal, the militant [but autonomous] youthwing of the VHP), most of them completely out of the control of the politiciansand other leaders who had led the movement and sought to gain political advan-tage from it. The ruling Congress dithered in its response, both to the movementand to the actual demolition, vacillating between acting strongly against Hindunationalist leaders (but alienating a potentially huge Hindu vote) and beingconciliatory (and alienating both Muslims and the evident majority of Hindusopposed to the entire strategy). Some leaders were charged, some of the localpolice were implicated in the destruction, there was an angry response fromMuslims, the violence escalated, and in Bombay, where the Shiv Sena was readyto exploit its communalist muscle, there were serious riots. Apart from the actualcontemporary political hinduism541"},{"pageNumber":548,"pageContent":"violence and death, however, a more abstract if extremely grave issue was atstake: the status of the Indian polity as one in which religions were treated withequal respect and religion itself was not a legitimate concern of the politicalprocess.In the event, the issue has proved irresolvable. On the one hand, the immedi-ate political fallout revealed a striking resistance amongst Hindus to the processof communalization, i.e., the process of recasting politics as a struggle over reli-gious identity and between religious communities. Geographically, there was astrong rejection of the strategy in most of south India, removed from the eventsin Ayodhya and with a different history of intercommunal relations. Demo-graphically, there was an immediate ebbing away of support for the BJP from the urban elite groups, who saw in the destruction of the mosque nothing buta loss of political credibility. On the other hand, the question still remained as towhether a suitably modulated version of this strategy could, in future, remobi-lize sufficient numbers of Hindus. This was because the very possibility of large-scale and violent communalization had now become conceivable within thepolitical system.Hindu nationalism’s optionsThe subsequent history of Hindu nationalism over the decade revealed the fun-damental differences of conception, goal and strategy that had long existed inIndia, but which emerged starkly after Ayodhya. Two factors made the choicesfacing Hindu nationalists ever clearer after Ayodhya. Firstly, the destruction ofthe mosque itself was such an extreme event in the context of India that, evenif any ambivalence about its value and effect remained, it could not form thebasis of a unified and sustained Sangh Parivar strategy such as had character-ized the brief period between 1989 and 1992. Differences in the assessment ofthe value and effect of the destruction became a matter of sharp debate withinthe Parivar. Secondly, the BJP itself moved ever closer to national power (afterhaving gained some power at the state level), and the electoral calculation didnot add up to a simple endorsement of the mobilizatory strategy that had led toAyodhya. There was a Hindu vote-bank, and that had helped the BJP in stateelections, especially in Uttar Pradesh itself; but that vote-bank did not extend inany simply manner either to Uttar Pradesh or to the country as a whole.These two considerations, one conceptual (and, perhaps, ethical), the otherinstrumental, led to the same outcome, which was a diversification of Hindutvastrategy directed at different points of an ideological continuum. At one end ofthe Hindu nationalist continuum were those who thought that the realizationof a Hindu nation – in which there was either no other religion or only suitablysubordinated religions – was only just beginning, and its achievement throughcontinued mobilization would come regardless of political cost and lack of demo-cratically accredited power. At the end were those who thought that the mostand the best achievement possible was a political manifesto that included some542c. ram-prasad"},{"pageNumber":549,"pageContent":"specifically Hindu conceptual categories regarding the Indian state, a manifestothat permitted conventional political calculations for the attainment of democ-ratically accredited power. In short, the issue was what Hinduism could possiblymean in politics. The strongest and most ideological response was that Hinduismwas the source of a collective transformation that could also transform the verynature of the Indian polity. In contrast, more instrumentalist politicians tendedto represent Hindutva, in contrast, as (merely) the source of cultural ideas withwhich to interpret (and justify) actions within the existing polity.The idea that Hindutva implied a transformation of the Indian polity appealedto those who were willing to challenge the current constitutional and proceduralarrangments. That willingness manifested itself in hostility towards Muslimsand Christians, along with conservative resistance to the perceived influence of the West on Indian social and economic life. Agitation for the removal ofmosques from other favored Hindu sites continued, despite the wrangles andwider concerns following the destruction of the mosque at Ayodhya. Thestandard demands for a “uniform civil code” (the removal of special protectionfor Muslim personal law from legal generality), and the ending of special lawson property pertaining to the Muslim-majority state of Kashmir, continued tobe made. Some attention also began to be directed at (especially Western-fundedmissionary activity directed at) conversion to Christianity represented yet againas a threat to Hindu culture. (This was an issue that was to be become muchmore critical by the end of the decade.) Against the backdrop of a wider nativistrejection of the economic liberalization that was occurring under a reformistCongress regime, Hindu nationalist organizations targeted, in particular, (mostlyWestern) multinational corporations entering the long-protected Indian con-sumer industry. All these were presented as struggles over the Hindu soul ofIndia, threatened as it was held to be from within through the religious minor-ities and from without through Western materialist culture.In the mid-1990s, the BJP attempted to retain the support of those who hadbeen mobilized through appeal to the “hard” Hindu nationalism of the rest ofthe Sangh Parivar, even while it sought to appeal to those segments of the elec-torate more concerned with issues of efficiency (anticorruption, administrativecompetence, economic liberalization) than with religious identity. In pursuit ofthe latter, there was a projection of the BJP – especially in the form of Atal BihariVajpayee – as the party of good governance. After Congress under NarasimhaRao lost power, the BJP sought to position itself as the only alternative. But evenits diversified strategy failed to bring it sufficient direct electoral support. At thesame time, other parties, national and regional (with the exception, of course,of the Hindu nationalist Shiv Sena in Maharashtra), adhered to the “secularist”conception of politics, and refused to contemplate electoral alliances with theBJP. When given a chance, the BJP lasted less than a fortnight in government forlack of partners to form a coalition.This experience was sufficient for the BJP to persuade itself that its bestchance of success lay in pursuing the “soft” strategy of focusing on issues of gov-ernance rather than ideology. The Hindu vote bank mobilized through violence-contemporary political hinduism543"},{"pageNumber":550,"pageContent":"based confrontational ideology, as on Ayodhya, would have nowhere else to go,while the chance of increasing votes in a wider constituency would only comethrough pursuing issues of governance. But beyond the votes themselves(which, even when maximized, might still not be enough) any hope of power laywith alliances, and alliance partners would be tempted only by a less ideologi-cally motivated BJP.As the “Third Front” of parties that came to power in 1996 found themselvesunable to provide stability over a full term of Parliament, elections had to becalled again. The failure of an alliance without the BJP made it look necessary– and the “soft” strategy of the BJP made it look possible – for many parties tothink of dealing with it. The BJP’s share of the vote in the next General Electionwent up slightly, although it still got less that 30 percent of the popular vote. Itwon the largest number of seats; but well short of a majority, so that it neededto put together a precarious coalition in order to form a government.Democratic power and its constraintsBy 1998, “Hindu nationalists” were in power in India. But what did that mean?Clearly, the Indian polity was not going to be transformed constitutionally oreven culturally. The electoral arithmetic saw to that. There were too many politi-cal forces to constrain the core impulses of Hindutva, besides the divergenceswithin Hindutva itself. This was most evident in economic policy: Jaswant Singh,a long-standing member of the BJP in the Rajya Sabha (Upper House) in the past,was perceived by the RSS and others to be too unideological and reform-mindedto be allowed to hold the key post of Finance Minister. (He became [an influen-tial] External Affairs Minister instead.) But the economic imperatives had to bemet and the BJP-led coalition had perforce to continue the same inconsistent butliberalizing policies of the two previous regimes. This set the BJP-in-governmentagainst other organizations within the Parivar, whose instinctive nativism madethem protectionist and antireformist. On other issues too, the strength of un-sympathetic allies compelled the BJP to give up formally (in the governmentagenda) its traditional Hindutva demands. Ironically, when Hindu nationalistsattained power, it could only be on terms that allowed little space for Hindunationalism.The decision to conduct nuclear tests in 1998 seemed on the face of it to beat least one unqualifiedly Hindu nationalist decision. Certainly, both supportersand opponents of the BJP often saw it as driven by the desire to express thestrength of a Hindu nation. But the reality was more complex. Previous gov-ernments had come close to conducting the tests, and the defense establishmenthad consistently argued for tests and been heard sympathetically by previousPrime Ministers. Of course, it was seen as being of immediate domestic advan-tage to conduct the tests and ride a (rapidly diminishing) wave of nationalism.But what kind of nationalism – Hindu or Indian? Traditionalists in the BJP partyhierarchy, and in the RSS and VHP, read the tests as expressing Hindu greatness,544c. ram-prasad"},{"pageNumber":551,"pageContent":"made possible through the decision of Hindus. This was clear in their portrayalof the tests in religious-ideological terms, characteristically anti-Islamic. TheHindu bomb would forever show the strength of India against Pakistan. Manyof them seemed genuinely surprised when (as everyone else had expected)Pakistan, with massive Chinese assistance, managed a symbolic responsethrough its own tests. The BJP-in-government was not unhappy about thisresponse. It helped for the moment to heal divisions within the Parivar, broughtabout through unhappiness over the BJP’s economic and social pragmatism. Butit was not entirely happy either, wishing to use the tests to play more widely toIndian nationalism. The Defense Minister, from an allied party with a strong sec-ularist base, claimed that the tests were meant to signal Indian preparednessagainst China. While this articulation was diplomatically unwise, it was part ofthe larger concern to present the tests as simply part of an Indian coming-of-ageon the international scene, not a narrow anti-Islamic reflex. Gradually, opposi-tion within India to the weaponization of nuclear capability also turned fromrhetoric about Hindutva to substantive concerns about India’s geostrategy. Shiftsin the international response, from diplomatic condemnation to a tacitly acqui-escent refocus on economic cooperation, strengthened this trend. The Hindutvadimension of the tests faded away into issues about India’s place in the worldand the proper means of attaining it.By the end of the decade in which the BJP’s drive to power had been impelledby grassroots appeal to an exclusivist Hindu identity, Hindu nationalism founditself at a crossroad. The use of real political power seemed to require instru-mentalist alliances and economic governance, which meant the effective repu-diation of an ideology to transform the Indian polity into a Hindu one. Againstthis, it had become possible to even think of political power in the first place onlybecause of mobilization through appeal to Hindu identity. In power, the oldtension between ideological purity and political realism remained. And so longas it remained, Hindu nationalism seemed doomed to attaining political poweronly by denying itself.In the next election, brought about prematurely because of the loss of supportfrom one regional party, an accident of personalities decided the strategy of theSangh Parivar. The Prime Minister, Vajpayee, had the impeccable credentials ofan RSS man who had been in the Jana Sangh throughout its existence and inthe BJP since its inception. Yet he had chosen to represent himself as the leaderof a national alliance of parties and views that subsumed the BJP and deniedany role for Hindutva in its manifesto. And he alone was likely to deliver anypolitical power to the Parivar, because of his personal standing with the nationalelectorate. Reluctantly, they went into an election supporting leaders (not onlyVajpayee but almost the entire front-rank of cabinet ministers) who had alreadydeclared that they would not permit core Hindutva demands to form any part ofa new government’s policies. The alternative was loss of all access to politicalpower. In the previous election, the BJP leadership had hedged its bets and tacitlycondoned inflammatory rhetoric and spasm of violence while officially follow-ing a much less ideologically loaded strategy. This time, it put all its eggs in onecontemporary political hinduism545"},{"pageNumber":552,"pageContent":"basket and concentrated on an ostensibly Vajpayee-led reasonableness and anoncommunal plan of action.The second success of the BJP, this time as part of a stable coalition, appearedto confirm the view that Hindu nationalism could not hope to change the Indianpolity, because of the nature of Indian politics. Indian political exigencies wouldbroadly remain the same regardless of specific ideological agenda. The con-straints of economic liberalization – to respond to globalization through deregulation, open markets, hard negotiation in bi- and multi-lateral forums –seemed, by the turn of the century, to be inescapable.Geopolitical constraints too seemed to make a mockery of ideology. The tenserelationship with Pakistan over Kashmir focused attention on this matter. FromIndependence, Kashmir had been a contested area. A state under British rule, its Hindu ruler had acceded to India despite its Muslim majority. Although thenewly formed Pakistan failed in its attempt to annex Kashmir, a part of Kashmirstayed under Pakistan after a cease-fire. A plebiscite was supposed to have beenheld but never was. The situation by the late 1980s was roughly this: India main-tained that Kashmir – including, nominally, that part in Pakistan – was an inte-gral part of the secular Indian Union, the special constitutional provisions madefor it being held adequate to its special status. Pakistan claimed that as a Muslim-majority state, Kashmir would more naturally be part of Islamic Pakistan, andthat any plebiscite held would lead to this end. Meanwhile, Pakistan would bemorally committed to any attempt by Kashmiri Muslims to break away fromIndia. As Indian mismanagement of Kashmir led to the alienation of a largesection of the population, the spread of Islamic fundamentalist ideology, andtraining, especially through Afghanistan, reached Kashmir via Pakistan. Asvarious militant groups took to fighting the Indian army, the political situationsettled into this dead-end equation: India would not talk about any change toKashmir without the cessation of civil unrest, sustained, it seemed from the evi-dence, through Pakistani support for Kashmiri Islamic militancy. Pakistanrefused to acknowledge that it overtly supported the militants but argued thatIndia had to face the reality of a natural Islamic coincidence of interest betweenKashmir and Pakistan. As for the militants, most followed Pakistan’s line whileclaiming still to be fighting for outright independence (the end seemingly sup-ported by a substantial portion of Kashmiri Muslims).In this context, Hindu nationalists always argued for complete Indian controlover Kashmir and an utter refusal to concede anything to either Pakistan or themilitants. In government, the BJP found itself acting somewhat differently. First,Vajpayee initiated a confidence-building process with the Prime Minister ofPakistan; but this came to nothing. Worse, for mysterious reasons, Pakistanundertook a risky incursion into India, in cooperation with Kashmiri militants.The BJP-led government braved domestic anger with a highly restrained anddefensive military policy that ruled out counter-incursion and incurred higherIndian casualties than a more aggressive tactic might have permitted. Immedi-ate international support for Indian policy resulted and the mini-war came toan end without clear result but with Pakistan compromised on the international546c. ram-prasad"},{"pageNumber":553,"pageContent":"scene. This striking repudiation of Hindu nationalist ideology was followed by aseries of other examples: in negotiations with militant hijackers of an Indianplane, in making contact with a range of militant groups, in declaring and main-taining cease-fires in the guerrilla war with the militants.As the BJP-led government presided over an uncertain but discernibleincrease in Indian engagement in world affairs, politically and economically,Western and Islamic countries began to deal with India on purely geopoliticalterms, seeming to regard the ideological considerations of Hindutva as irrel-evant to geopolitics.The question in the early years of the twenty-first century concerns the roleof Hindu nationalism, not in world affairs but in the transmutation of domesticpolitics. Electorally, Indian politics seems set to remain what it became in the1990s, an uneasy mix of national and regional parties, able to secure majorityonly through coalitions. This fragmentation has occurred through the emer-gence of a range of political organizations speaking for specific regional andcaste-based interests. In this landscape, compromise and balance are essential,and that does not make for the success of ideology. There will continue to beinternal institutional differences over exact tactics within the BJP and betweenit and other groups in the Sangh Parivar. Arguably, when the BJP was most effec-tive in keeping its non-Hindu nationalist allies in government happy, thestrongest opposition to it came from other members of the Parivar. In someinstances, there has been a congruence of interests against the BJP, as when its(admittedly erratic) pursuit of economic liberalization threatens the protection-ist instincts of both the Farmers Wing of the Parivar and various agriculturallobbies in other parties.In short, once the BJP came to power (in a coalition), it was at odds with thevery movement that brought it to power. We have already looked at the politicalexigencies of this uneasy relationship, and will shortly look at the fundamentaldivide between cultural and political imperatives. But before that, another issuehas to be addressed, namely, the challenge of governance. Without doubt, mobi-lization and the pursuit of Hindu nationalist ends have demanded a variety ofextra-legal tactics, mostly involving or resulting in violence. The BJP recognizedthe self-denying nature of its relationship with such mobilization, which bothbrought it hard-core support and alienated everyone else. Indeed, by the elec-tion of 1998, the BJP has assimilated with some success the contradictions ofHindu nationalist strategies. It presented itself as the only possible means of con-trolling unbridled Hindu nationalism, because it could control rather thanmerely oppose it. But this assimilation could not work well once it took on theburden of governance and actually had to assert that control. Civil disorder isnot an effective mechanism for political engineering; and this is simply becausea mechanism needs to be subject to order. A government (especially a democra-tic one, most especially a coalition) can least afford to use disorder – communalviolence – to maintain sociopolitical stability. (Indira Gandhi had tried to usecommunal unrest to maintain her power, and even where she temporarily suc-ceeded, she did not maintain stability.) So the BJP found itself having to actcontemporary political hinduism547"},{"pageNumber":554,"pageContent":"against the very forces unleashed – uncontrollably – by mobilization, forces forwhich the attainment of democratic power was irrelevant. Missionaries killed ornuns raped in the “defense of Hinduism” were law and order problems for thegovernment – even or especially when that government was led by the BJP. Evenfar less extreme acts, like the Parivar’s condemnation of the BJP’s attempts towoo Muslims into its fold (not entirely unsuccessful), were problematic to a partyengaged in procedural politicking. From representing itself as the only partycapable of controlling Hindu nationalism, the BJP became the party mostdirectly attacked by Hindu nationalists.Culture vs. politicsWhat had happened was that a chasm had opened up between religioculturalgoals and politics ends. Any tectonic shift in the Indian polity, if it comes, is there-fore not likely to happen in the political landscape, but under a vaster, less clearlycontoured cultural terrain.In a sense, we can see the battle over the future of Hindutva as one betweenthe visions of Savarkar and Golwalkar. The experience of Hindu nationalists indemocratic power suggests that Savarkar’s vision of a directly political transfor-mation of India into a Hindu state is not, as far as we can see in 2002, likely tobe realized. Hindutva ideologues came to understand this over the course of theyears the BJP first came to national power. Despite the occasional polemicaltwitch (reviving the plan to reclaim Hindu “sacred sites” from mosques) and theinstitutional jerk (replacing Congress appointees on national academic bodieswith those more sympathetic to Hindutva readings of history and culture), theinertia of coalition politics and the dictates of a fractious yet astute Indian elec-torate appeared to keep the BJP from becoming an effective vehicle for the recast-ing of the Indian polity. Ironically, where the BJP-led government had anysuccess, it was in matters of economic governance and international relations,where Hindutva ideology played no role. This scarcely led to any a congruenceof interest between the BJP high command and the rest of the Parivar.The longer the BJP stayed in limited power, the more Hindu nationalismseemed to take on a religiocultural manifestation. The VHP began to organize theengagement of Hindu religious figures and organization in debates about thenature of India. The RSS ideal of a change in Hindu culture as the prerequisitefor the creation of the Hindu nation seemed more and more the sustainable goalof Hindutva activity. During the great festival of the Maha Kumb Mela inAllahabad in 2001, for example, the VHP succeeded in organizing a “HinduSansad” or Convocation of religious figures, bringing under one roof what nearlyamounted to a collective Hindu papacy, demonstrating the strength of the ideathat there could be one unified “Hinduism.” Although – and perhaps preciselybecause – many religious figures, orders, and organizations warned against sucha gathering becoming used for “political” ends by the VHP, the general principleof pan-Hindu meetings and agreement seem to have been presupposed. To the548c. ram-prasad"},{"pageNumber":555,"pageContent":"extent that the growth of a sense of a common Hindu identity was long the aimof the RSS, the very organizational fact of such a Hindu gathering under the aegisof the Parivar suggested that there was some confluence between Parivar ideol-ogy and a shift in the nature of contemporary Hindu self-conceptions.Contemporary political Hinduism, then, is a complex phenomenon. On theone hand, the actual experience of political power demonstrates the limits ofreligion-derived ideology in the governance of the Indian polity, democratic, plu-ralist, economically emergent, and geopolitically promising as it is at the begin-ning of the twenty-first century. On the other hand, as Hindu culture becomesimplicated in the affirmation of identity in the face of global erosion of differ-ence – as Hindus construct identities through creative interpretations of historyand community – organizations mediating cultural politics can seem to offerways and means for such construction. It is here that the VHP in particularseems able to exploit the need of some Hindus in their search for self-definition.By providing organizational wherewithal, apparently useful educationalresources, and scope for relentless self-affirmation, the VHP can seem to offer away for Hindu self-definition. If there is sufficient support for such activity, thenthe cultural route to making India a Hindu nation might still seem open. Butthis does not seem a straightforward or open route. The very plurality of theIndian people – especially the “Hindus” – that seemed to have made a directpolitical transformation of India virtually impossible, now stands in the way of any easy prognosis about the future of Hindu nationalism.Annotated BibliographyBasu, A. 1996. “Mass Movement or Elite Conspiracy?

Among the most intriguing of thesefictions is the imagination of the modern nation as an ancient goddess who, asthe embodiment of timeless values and cherished ideals, arouses adoration andcommands reverence among her citizen-devotees. We see this fiction at work inmany different parts of the modern world – the Americas, Britain, westernEurope – but it is perhaps in colonial and postcolonial India, on the putativemargins of the metropolitan West where it first started, that the contradictionsof thinking the nation simultaneously as ancient and modern become mostapparent. In this chapter, by focusing on two such goddesses who put in anappearance in late colonial India – Tamil ̄tta ̄y (Mother Tamil), and Bha ̄rat Ma ̄ta ̄(Mother India) – I reflect on some of these contradictions, inspired by SudiptaKaviraj’s observation that “the nation, in India. . . is a thing without a past”:It is radically modern. It can only look for subterfuges of antiquity. It fears to faceand admit its own terrible modernity, because to admit modernity is to make itselfvulnerable. As a proposal for modern living. . . in a society still knowing only onelegitimizing criterion – tradition – it must seek to find past disguises for these wholly modern proposals. (Kaviraj 1993: 13)I will argue that although both Tamil ̄tta ̄y and Bha ̄rat Ma ̄ta ̄ cloak themselvesin the mantle of great antiquity, strategically borrowing for their “disguise” froma vast repository of symbolic practices and beliefs that I gloss here as “Hindu,”they are products of a modern imagination, and telltale signs of their modernityset them apart from the pantheon of older Hindu goddesses on whom they arequietly parasitic. In making this argument, I want to obviously resist the notion,shared by both their devotees and some scholars, that these mother-goddesses"},{"pageNumber":558,"pageContent":"are but natural expressions of the devotion to the mother-figure that has beendeemed a timeless and universal ingredient of Hindu culture and society.Instead, I propose that the imagination of these goddesses has been possiblebecause of a new, even “secular,” ideology of motherhood that has accom-panied the consolidation of modernity everywhere, India included. All the same,the passions that these goddesses have managed to arouse in the subcontinent,and the structures of sentiments in which they have come to be embedded, aredistinctive enough that Tamil ̄tta ̄y and Bha ̄rat Ma ̄ta ̄ are not mere rehearsals ofsimilar symbolic fictions elsewhere, nor indeed are the nationalisms whose fertileimaginations have generated them.Introducing Tamil ̄tta ̄y: Language Devotion in Tamil IndiaI begin my reflections on such matters with the figure of Tamil ̄tta ̄y (figure 26.1),who is the lesser-known and more local of the two, confined as she has been tothe Tamil-speaking parts of India, in contrast to the pan-Indic Bha ̄rat Ma ̄ta ̄.1Asthe apotheosis of the Tamil language, and the founding mother and guardiandeity of the Tamil-speaking community, the moment of her birth can be tracedto an 1891 hymn in Tamil by the litterateur P. Sundaram Pillai (1855–97). Inthis hymn (which since June 1970 has served as the state of Tamil Nadu’s official “prayer song”), the earth is imagined as a woman whose beautiful faceisparatak kan.t.am(“ Bha ̄rat,” “India”) and whose radiant brow is the southernpeninsula. The southern tira ̄vit.a na ̄t.u(“Dravidian land”) adorns that brow as anauspicioustilakam(sacred mark). The hymn then declares:O great goddess Tamil!Like the fragrance of that tilakam, your fame spreads in all directions,and delights the whole world.Spellbound in admiration of your splendid youth and power, we offer you our homage.(quoted in Ramaswamy 1997: 17)Although there are occasional examples from before the 1890s of the glori-fication and feminization of the language (Ramaswamy 1998a), I have arguedat length elsewhere that it is from the closing years of the nineteenth centurythat Tamil ̄tta ̄y emerges systematically as a figure of speech, worship, and iden-tity in the context of the development of what I have characterized as “Tamildevotion” (tamil ̄ppar ̄r ̄u) (Ramaswamy 1997). A loosely-connected network ofpraise, passion, and practices centered on the adoration of Tamil, Tamil devo-tion has underwritten many different projects over the course of the twentiethcentury, beginning with a religious revitalization movement which aimed toidentify the authentic Tamil speaker as a follower of the lord Shiva whoseworship was most efficacious when conducted through the medium of “divine”552sumathi ramaswamy"},{"pageNumber":559,"pageContent":"Tamil (teyvattamil ̄). In tandem with this movement (and occasionally at crosspurposes with it) were concerted efforts to establish the “classicality” of Tamilin order to prove that Tamil speakers were among the most “civilized” peoples ofthe world, if not the most. Both projects were largely spearheaded by literary and religious elites in whose musings Tamil ̄tta ̄y appears as a deity (teyvam) or athe goddess and the nation553Figure 26.1:Tamil ̄tta ̄y (Mother Tamil).

In this process, thefigure of Tamil ̄tta ̄y, as indeed the language she embodied, underwent a funda-mental transformation, from autonomous deity and sovereign queen, to a frailand endangered mother totally dependent on her “children,” the loyal speakersof Tamil. As the figure of the mother emerged as a sign of the authentic, purecommunity, and as a metonym for “the people,” and as their language – imagined as “mother tongue” – was configured as the bearer of the true soul,spirit, and genius of its speakers, the motherhood of Tamil was fashioned intoan instrument with which to contest both British colonialism andIndian nation-alism. So, Tamil speakers were told:There is no distinction at all between our mother who bore us for ten months, gavebirth to us, watched over us, sang lullabies to us, and fed us milk and guarded us,and our Tamil language which taught us about good conduct and tradition, andgranted us good values and knowledge, and which is the very reason that we livewell and in prosperity. We have the same attachment to our language as we havefor our mother; we have the same devotion to our language as we have for ourmother; we have the same love for our language as we have for our mother. He whodisregards his language. . . is like he who disregards his mother and forsakes her . . . (quoted in Ramaswamy 1997: 72)This assertion that disregarding their language was like disregarding theirmothers, even matricide, was frequently used to arouse a “sleeping” populace tocome to the rescue of their endangered mother language. This was especially soin the middle decades of the past century when the Indian National Congressparty vigorously promoted Hindi as the future national language of India, acause that was taken up as well with even greater enthusiasm by the indepen-dent Indian state after 1947. In the writings of numerous devotees of Tamil,Hindi (caricatured as a bloodsucking demoness, a sultry temptress, an upstartmaid, and a false mother) as well as its chief patron, the Indian state, were tar-geted as the principal enemies of Tamil and Tamil ̄tta ̄y, and hence of the incipi-ent Tamil nation (Ramaswamy 1999). Between the late 1930s and mid-1960s,a series of vigorous, sometimes violent, anti-Hindi protests provided the contextfor the widespread deployment of Tamil ̄tta ̄y’s body in various stages of distressand disarray. Anti-Hindi poetry as well as populist speeches from these decades554sumathi ramaswamy"},{"pageNumber":561,"pageContent":"abound with provocative images of Tamil ̄tta ̄y shackled in chains, or confined toa dungeon. Her “children” were told that their mother’s body was riddled withscars and wounds; that her golden figure which was once adorned with mag-nificent jewels was now trapped in iron manacles; and that she was constantlyin tears (Ramaswamy 1998b, 1999).In her guise as a frail and endangered mother, the Dravidian and Tamilnationalists’ Tamil ̄tta ̄y closely resembled another “nationalist” manifestation ofthe goddess in the imagination of those of her devotees who saw themselvessimultaneously as “Tamil” and “Indian.” For these Tamil “Indianists,” Tamil isone among a larger “family” of “mother tongues,” harmoniously flourishingwithin the framework of the Indian nation, rather than outside it. In turn,Tamil ̄tta ̄y is a companion to Bha ̄rat Ma ̄ta ̄, rather than her victim. Indeed, in theirpoetic musings, Tamil ̄tta ̄y and Bha ̄rat Ma ̄ta ̄ are imagined in very similar terms.They are both virginal mothers. They are the most ancient of women, compas-sionate and nourishing. And they are bothowed allegiance by the Tamil speakerwho is simultaneously “Tamil” and “Indian.” This is in stark contrast to theradical Dravidianist for whom Bha ̄rat Ma ̄ta ̄ was a “false mother,” and Tamil ̄tta ̄yis the only one who deserves the total and unconditional surrender of every loyalTamil speaker.In my longer work on the goddess, I have also argued that not only is Tamil ̄tta ̄yvariously imagined thus by her devotees, as the language that she embodies is variously configured, but that devotion towards her is multiply manifested, asreligious, filial, and erotic. Indeed, this is how Tamil devotion, fundamentally anetwork of patriarchal discourses and practices conducted largely by men, solves the problem of having a female figure enshrined at the very heart of itsenterprise. She is first isolated and abstracted from the real world in which Tamil-speaking women of all shades have been disempowered through much ofthis century; she is then endowed with a plenitude of powers and possibilitieswhich transform her into a strikingly exceptional Woman, not readily confusedwith the flesh-and-blood women on whom she is also obviously modeled. Thoughshe may be thus empowered, her potential to exceed the control of her (male)creators is contained through her fragmentation. The plethora of multiple per-sonae that she is endowed with works to prevent her consolidation as a threat-ening all-powerful being, even as it simultaneously opens up the possibility thather various selves may be deployed in contradictory ways for the different pro-jects of her devotees. Tamil ̄tta ̄y is thus yet another classic example of the objec-tification of woman as a thing “to be appropriated, possessed, and exchanged inthe social relations of cooperation and competition among men” (Uberoi 1990:41). Although some Tamil-speaking women have appropriated her to stake outindependent claims of their own (Ramaswamy 1992), Tamil ̄tta ̄y, like other ex-emplary female icons, is far from cutting a feminist figure in her guise as tamegoddess, benevolent mother, and unsullied virgin. Visible and valorized she maybe, but she is very much a figment of the patriarchal imaginations at work incolonial and postcolonial Tamil India (Ramaswamy 1997).the goddess and the nation555"},{"pageNumber":562,"pageContent":"Revisiting Bha ̄rat Ma ̄ta ̄: Geopiety in Colonial and Postcolonial IndiaIf Tamil ̄tta ̄y flourishes as an object of “language devotion,” the more well-knownfigure of Bha ̄rat Ma ̄ta ̄ circulates as an expression of what I have elsewhere char-acterized as “geopiety,” passionate longing for and attachment to a territorynamed “India, that is Bha ̄rat” (Ramaswamy 2002). As opposed to Tamil ̄tta ̄y who,prior to my own work on her, was quite under-studied by to the scholarly com-munity (for passing reference see Kailasapathy 1970: 64–119; Lakshmi 1990;Pandian 1987; Thaninayagam 1963), Bha ̄rat Ma ̄ta ̄ has received academic atten-tion from various quarters. This may be partly because, in contrast to Tamil ̄tta ̄y,she was the subject of a fairly extensive official archive that was the product ofthe British colonial state’s interest in her (for colonial interest in the goddess, seeChirol 1910; Ker 1973; McCully 1940: 264–9). Convinced about the centralityof this goddess to the popular mobilizations of Hindu religious revivalists and“revolutionary” nationalists alike, British officials – who were already quiteambivalent about the mother-goddess Ka ̄lı ̄ on whom she was partly modeled –censored poetry and visuals featuring Bha ̄rat Ma ̄ta ̄ from the early years of thetwentieth century well into the 1940s (Barrier 1974; Shaw 1985). Although thisrich archive has yet to be sufficiently analyzed, what is clear is that soon after herinitial emergence in the writings of Bengali devotees from the late 1860s, Bha ̄ratMa ̄ta ̄ became an all-India personage, appearing in the patriotic poetry of everymajor linguistic region of the emergent nation from the early years of the twen-tieth century. It is also clear that it was not just the obviously religiously-inclinednationalist like Aurobindo Ghose (1872–1950) or Subramania Bha ̄rati (1882–1921) who sought her blessings and offered her their allegiance, but even the more “secular” of modernists like Rabindranath Tagore (1861–1941) orJawaharlal Nehru (1889–1964) who invoked her, if only ambivalently.Scholarly interest in Bha ̄rat Ma ̄ta ̄ has also been provoked in recent years byher proliferation in the discourses and symbolic activities of various Hindunationalist parties whose members have written poems about her, built templesand shrines in her honor, conducted all-India “pilgrimage” processions centeredaround her, sought to introduce her into their schools, and circulated her visu-ally and materially through postcards and greeting cards, wall posters, and videofilm (see e.g. Bacchetta 1996; Brosius 1999; McKean 1996; Sarkar 1995; vander Veer 1994). The Bha ̄rat Ma ̄ta ̄ of today’s Hindu nationalists is much moredivisive than her previous incarnations and, as Patricia Uberoi rightly notes, lessinclined to participate in a “secular” union to which all Indians regardless oftheir religious affiliation are welcome. “In those days, her flag was invariably the Indian tricolour, not the monochromatic pennant of an imagined Hindukingdom” (Uberoi 1999–2000: 34). Although Bha ̄rat Ma ̄ta ̄ today stands as asymbol of militant “Hindu,” rather than a composite “Indian,” nationalism, Iwould nonetheless insist that part of the reason for her popularity among herpresent-day devotees is the hard work that has been done through the course of556sumathi ramaswamy"},{"pageNumber":563,"pageContent":"the previous decades to make her a part of political landscape of the subconti-nent in the name of a “secular” India.It is surprising, therefore, given her ubiquity in twentieth-century India, thatBha ̄rat Ma ̄ta ̄ has not been subjected to the kind of critical scholarly scrutiny thata comparable figure like Marianne of France has received from Maurice Agulhon(1980) and others (see e.g. Hunt 1984; Mosse 1985). For instance, Bha ̄ratMa ̄ta ̄’s remarkable presence in the nationalist aspirations of diasporic Indians in the early decades of the twentieth century, such as the members of the SanFrancisco-based Ghadar Party, has barely been noticed, nor indeed has thepoetry produced on her by Muslim and Sikh devotees (Bose 1997: 63–4; Puri1993: 140–4), and by even the occasional white Christian votary like C. F.Andrews (Andrews 1914). There is some scholarly work on her place in thepatriotic imaginations of her Tamil and Hindi devotees, although we know littleyet about the differences that might set apart these regional manifestations fromeach other (Baskaran 1981; Goswami 1998: 332–45; Ramaswamy 1997).2Most of the existing scholarship on the goddess is narrowly focused on Bha ̄ratMa ̄ta ̄ in her Bengali guise (writ large as “Indian”), and largely limited to her placein the imagination of Bankim Chandra Chatterjee (1838–94) (see Bose 1997).Although Bankim’s well-known musings from the 1870s and 1880s have beenundoubtedly crucial to the popularization of the idea of the nation as a goddessand a mother, recent scholarship suggests that the ground had already beencleared for such an imagination to surface through the work of others. As IndiraChowdhury’s work shows, Bha ̄rat Ma ̄ta ̄ had already put in an appearance in the poetry and plays of various Bengali patriots associated with the “Hindumela” (Hindu fair) in the late 1860s and early 1870s (Chowdhury 1998:95–119). The notion of India as the female deity “Adibha ̄rati,” had also appearedby 1866 in the imagination of Bankim’s contemporary, Bhudev Mukhopadhyay(1827–94), who turned for patriotic inspiration to an ancient Puranic legend inwhich the body of the goddess Satı ̄ was dismembered and scattered across thesubcontinent in 52 different places which became pilgrimage spots in Hindusacred geography (Raychaudhuri 1988: 39–41; 63–5). As Tapan Raychaudhuriwrites, “Bhudev read into this myth a new meaning”:When I was a student of Hindu College, a European teacher told [us] that patrio-tism was unknown to the Hindus, for no Indian language had any word to expressthe idea. I believed his word and was deeply distressed by the thought. I knew then. . . the mythical account of...Sati’s death, but that knowledge did not help merefute the teacher’s statement or console myself. Now I know that to the descen-dant of the Aryans the entire motherland with its fifty-two places of pilgrimage isin truth the person of Deity. (quoted in Raychaudhuri 1988: 39)Bhudev’s somaticization of the motherland, thus enabling the transformation ofits inhabitants into each other’s siblings by virtue of being born of her womband raised on her milk, clearly anticipates the prolific use of similar somaticimagery in numerous poems on Bha ̄rat Ma ̄ta ̄ which came to be composed andcirculated over the course of the next century and more (Ramaswamy 1998b).the goddess and the nation557"},{"pageNumber":564,"pageContent":"It is in this context of an emergent geopiety that Bankim Chandra’s famedhymn “Bande Ma ̄taram,” “Homage to [the] Mother,” was first published in 1875in his journal Banga ̄darshan.3Incorporated later into his 1882 novel A ̄nandamath[Abbey of Bliss], and set to music by Rabindranath Tagore and sung publicly in 1896 at the Indian National Congress Party’s Calcutta session, the hymncelebrated an unnamed “mother” in the following terms:I bow to you, Mother,well-watered, well-fruited,breeze cool, crop green,the Mother!Nights quivering with white moonlight,draped in lovely flowering trees,sweet of smile, honeyed speech,giver of bliss and boons, the Mother!Seven crore4voices in your clamorous chant,twice seven crore hands holding aloft mighty scimitars,Who says, Mother, you are weak?Repository of many strengths,scourge of the enemy’s army, the Mother!(quoted in Bose 1997: 53)Although the hymn is not explicitly or even implicitly territorial, nor does itunambiguously identify “the Mother” it celebrates, nevertheless it soon becamethe rallying cry for an emergent patriotic cult of Bha ̄rat Ma ̄ta ̄ from the early yearsof the twentieth century in the context of the “Swadeshi” movement that sweptacross Bengal, Madras, the United Provinces, and other parts of British India(Bagchi 1990; Goswami 1998: 431–43; Sarkar 1973, 1987). From the mid-1880s, but especially from 1905 with Abanindranath Tagore’s well-knownpainting featuring her, Bha ̄rat Ma ̄ta ̄ also becomes an object of “visual piety”(Morgan 1997), as artists sought to convert poetic musing into pictorial reality(see, for example, figure 26.2). In doing so, they invariably turned, as manyscholars have noted, to the emergent practices of picturing Hinduism’s numer-ous deities in “god-posters” and “calendar art” (Guha-Thakurtha 1991; Larson,Pal and Smith 1997; Mitter 1994). Pictorial practice thus reaffirmed Bha ̄ratMa ̄ta ̄’s status as an ancient “Hindu” goddess that poetic imagination had alreadyconferred on her.In the course of the past century, her numerous devotees have invariablyinsisted that Bha ̄rat Ma ̄ta ̄ is a manifestation of Devı ̄ or Durga ̄, of the female prin-ciple embodied in the paradigmatic female divinity, S ́akti. So, Bankim’s BandeMa ̄taram concludes by addressing the Motherland thus:You are Durga ̄ bearing ten weapons of war,Kamala at play in the lotuses,Goddess of Learning, giver of knowledge,I bow to you(quoted in Bose 1997: 62)558sumathi ramaswamy"},{"pageNumber":565,"pageContent":"Figure 26.2:Bha ̄rat Ma ̄ta ̄ (Mother India).

The outsider sees heras a mere bit of earth, and looks upon her as only a geographical expression andentity. But we, her children, know her even today as our fathers and their fathershad done before, countless generations, as a Being, as a Manifestation of [S ́akti]. . . And we have always, and do still worship her as such. (Pal 1923: 106)While her devotees may think and present her thus, I believe it would be amistake to assume, as some scholars have indeed, a seamless and transparentconnection between Bha ̄rat Ma ̄ta ̄ and other female goddesses such as Durga ̄ orthe goddess of earth, Pr.ithvı ̄. So, Vidya Dehejia notes in passing that “[s]ince theland itself is spoken of in Sanskrit as Pr.ithvı ̄ or goddess earth, it is perhaps notsurprising that kingdoms, cities, districts, and boroughs are gendered feminine.India is ‘Bha ̄rat Ma ̄ta ̄’ or ‘Mother India’...” (Dehejia 1997: 14–15). Diana Eckargues more insistently that since “Bha ̄ratavarsha” or “India” is imagined inPuranic Hinduism as “the dismembered body of the Goddess,” it would be erro-neous for scholars to link the imagination of Bha ̄rat Ma ̄ta ̄ to modernity alone,for “such a view of its history lacks a longer historical perspective.”It is clear that the identification of devis [goddesses] with the land has much olderroots in the symbolisation of the body-cosmos as inscribed in the land through itssystem of devi shrines. A considerable history of pilgrimage to the multitude ofIndia’s hilltop, cave, and cliff-side devis preceded the use of the rhetoric of themother-land in 20th-century Hindu nationalism. (Eck 1999: 34)I agree with Eck that there indeed is a long tradition within Puranic Hinduismof identifying the earth as female and as the goddess Pr.ithvı ̄, and of perceivingthe land that we today know of as “India” as sacred (see also Kinsley 1987:178–96). All the same, I would also insist that an entirely novel way of relatingto national territory marks the modern moment in India, as it does elsewhere,and that this novelty manifests itself in the manner in which Bha ̄rat Ma ̄ta ̄ hasbeen imagined by her patriotic devotees as the presiding goddess of a moderngeopolity. But before I detail this, I want to address the various “subterfuges ofantiquity” through which “modern” goddesses like Bha ̄rat Ma ̄ta ̄ (and Tamil ̄tta ̄y)have managed to persuade even the learned scholar to forget their modernity.Subterfuges of AntiquityQuite simply, the principal reason one can be lulled into believing that Tamil ̄tta ̄yand Bha ̄rat Ma ̄ta ̄ are timeless ancient goddesses is because their devotees unam-biguously assert so, and consciously endow them with personalities and powers560sumathi ramaswamy"},{"pageNumber":567,"pageContent":"that are associated with the “eternal” goddesses of the Hindu pantheon, espe-cially Devı ̄, the paradigmatic mother-goddess. So, in his poetry, her ardentdevotee places Tamil ̄tta ̄y at the very beginning of time itself and in the companyof the gods, and deems her to be “everlasting” and “boundless.” She is the sourceof everything in the world – of knowledge and happiness, of wealth and pros-perity, of bliss and light, indeed of life itself. In poem after poem composed onand about her since the 1890s, she is declared to be the destroyer of darknessand of false illusions. She cures her followers of anger and jealousy, and grantsthem true vision. She rids them of afflictions and weeds out their troubles. Ather feet, even the worst sinners find salvation. By her very presence, she destroysthe sins of her devotees. She is indeed their ultimate refuge (Ramaswamy 1997:85–97). Listen to one such devotee, the poet Mudiyarasan (b. 1920), whoaddresses Tamil ̄tta ̄y thus:Residing in my heart that is your temple, offer me grace;Adorned in your garland of poetry, offer me protection; Resting on my tongue,grant me good sense;[so that] In verse and word, I will be strong....I worship you every day and talk about your fame everywhere . . .(quoted in Ramaswamy 1997: 85)And compare this to a random verse from the Devı ̄ Ma ̄ha ̄tmya, the paradigmatictext which marks the enshrinement of the idea of the Goddess in PuranicHinduism:O Devi, we bow before you, who are yourself good fortune in the dwellings of thevirtuous. . . intelligence in the hearts of the learned, faith in the hearts of thegood, and modesty in the hearts of the high-born. May you protect the universe!(quoted in Jagadiswarananda n.d.: 53)So, by praising her in terms that have been used over the centuries to praisegoddesses in this society, Tamil ̄tta ̄y, although she is a product of a late colonialimagination, is eternalized and transformed into a timeless divinity. Further, sheis not only praised in a manner befitting goddesses, but some well-known genresof praise used over the centuries to praise deities – genres such as thetirupal.l.iyel.ucci, the tirutaca ̄n.kam, the pil.l.aittamil ̄, the tu ̄tu, and so on – are nowdeployed in praise poetry around Tamil ̄tta ̄y. Through the deployment of suchpoetic genres and praise strategies, her devotees have endowed their languagewith the powers and charisma that have gathered around deities over thecentury in this society. In turn, Tamil speakers are encouraged to relate toTamil ̄tta ̄y as they interact with their gods – with a mixture of adulation, rever-ence, and deep love.Much the same can be said of Bha ̄rat Ma ̄ta ̄ who, from early on, was not justconsciously modeled on the goddesses Ka ̄lı ̄, and Durga ̄, but even imagined astheir incarnations, as I noted earlier. So, soon after Bhudev consciously recastthe Puranic Satı ̄ as his motherland, another of his contemporaries, Akshayathe goddess and the nation561"},{"pageNumber":568,"pageContent":"Chandra Sarkar, appropriated a Tantric text called Das ́amaha ̄vidya ̄, and rewroteit in 1873 with a new protagonist, Bha ̄rat Ma ̄ta ̄, imagined variously as the Hindugoddesses Ka ̄lı ̄, Bhuvanesvarı ̄, Bhairavı ̄, and so on (Chowdhury 1998: 96–7).Similarly, in Bankim Chandra Chatterjee’s A ̄nandamath, a novel that is founda-tional to the patriotic cult of Bha ̄rat Ma ̄ta ̄ that soon swamped the subcontinent,“the Motherland” (which shortly afterwards would come to be identified asBha ̄rat Ma ̄ta ̄) is explicitly visualized as an icon housed in a temple, much in themanner that other Hindu goddesses would be enshrined. She manifests herselfin three different forms, two of which are unambiguously named Jagaddha ̄triand Ka ̄lı ̄, and the third, the “motherland” of the future, is quite clearly modeledon Durga ̄, the patron-goddess of all devout Bengalis. Note the similarity between“the motherland” of the future and Durga ̄ in the following statement:This is what our Mother will become. Ten arms are spread in ten directions; in eacha different weapon, a symbol of a different power, her enemy sprawled defeated ather feet, the lion she rides on mauling her adversary...(quoted in Kaviraj 1995:139)Such verbal attempts to constitute her as a divine figure through prose andespecially verse, were also supplemented by visual productions in which Bha ̄ratMa ̄ta ̄ was unambiguously presented to her patriot-devotee as a goddess-likefigure. So, beginning with the 1905 painting by Abanindranath Tagore throughtoday’s Hindu nationalist visualizations, Bha ̄rat Ma ̄ta ̄ is invariably endowed withfour arms – a somatic feature generally only reserved for deities in Hindu society– with one of her hands held up in a gesture of blessing her “children,” in muchthe same way that Hindu icons are conventionally depicted. Frequently, espe-cially in the pictorial imagination of her more militant devotees, be they herPunjabi-speaking Sikh followers attached to the expatriate Ghadar Party, or herHindu nationalist devotees of recent years, she stands in the company of thelion, the animal most commonly associated with the goddess Durga ̄. She is alsoinvariably shown carrying archaic weapons such as tridents and spears (ratherthan a modern gun), and the ornaments that adorn her body are archaic, as isher clothing.5Many of Tamil ̄tta ̄y’s visual representations as well bestow upon her an air ofhoary antiquity, even though under the influence of the secular Dravidian move-ment (some of whose radical followers have even professed atheism), there areattempts made to present her as an everyday Tamil woman, clothed in a modernsaree, shorn of any divine attributes. Although the official government of TamilNadu statue of the goddess shows her with two arms, the prototype on which itis based – which is currently housed in a “temple” to the goddess in the southIndian town of Karaikkudi – was cast with four arms, one of which is held in agesture of blessing her subjects. Befitting her status as an ancient goddess oflearning and culture, Tamil ̄tta ̄y is frequently shown carrying cadjan leaves (butrarely a printed book, although print capitalism has been critical to the dissem-ination of her cult).6Instead of choosing from a wide array of modern musical562sumathi ramaswamy"},{"pageNumber":569,"pageContent":"instruments that are in use in today’s Tamil lifeworld, her devotees havepreferred to show their goddess playing the archaic “ya ̄l.,” a lute-like instrumentwhose great antiquity they laud. The items of jewelry that abundantly adorn herbody are declared to be the great works of ancient (but never modern) Tamil lit-erature: so the Cilapatika ̄ram [the Lay of the Anklet] jingles on her feet as anklets,theMan.ime ̄kalai[the Jeweled Belt] encircles her waist, and so on. As with Bha ̄ratMa ̄ta ̄, her jewelry and her clothing confer upon her an iconographic personathat consciously remove her in most cases from the everyday Tamil modern(again see figure 26.1).The Cunning of ModernityYet, I insist that in spite of the best efforts of their devotees to pass Bha ̄rat Ma ̄ta ̄or Tamil ̄tta ̄y off as timeless ancient goddesses, signs of their novelty and moder-nity are quite apparent to the discerning eye. I do so insist not just because myhistoricist training allows me to trace their emergence to texts and practicesdatable to the latter half of the nineteenth century – and not any earlier. Myinsistence also does not just follow from the conclusions of feminist scholarshipthat such female figures emerge as iconic in the context of a late colonial worldin which motherhood came to be newly privileged, both as the sine qua non ofwomen’s identity, and also as the foundational site on which pure and true sub-jectivities and communities could be imagined and reproduced. And lastly, myargument does not just rest on the new ways of visually presenting these god-desses to their devout public (through media such as calendar art, “god posters,”cinema, and video) in poses and appearances that can be persuasively describedas “modern.”Persuasive enough as these reasons might all be, I rest my case for the moder-nity of these goddesses on the entirely novel manner in which the entities thatthey embody – be it the territory of “India” or the Tamil language – come to bereconfigured in late colonial India. In the case of Tamil ̄tta ̄y, I have argued else-where that it was not until the latter half of the nineteenth century that Tamilemerged as an object of praise in and of itself, deserving adulation for its abilityto ensure communication between its speakers, their schooling, and their gov-ernance, rather than for commanding the attention of the gods or being the lan-guage that they favor. We get a glimpse of this new people-centered ideology thatemerges around Tamil in the following declaration from 1879:Tamil gave birth to us; Tamil raised us; Tamil sang lullabies to us and put us tosleep; Tamil taught us our first words with which we brought joy to our mothersand fathers; Tamil is the first language we spoke when we were infants; Tamil isthe language which our mothers and fathers fed us along with milk; Tamil is thelanguage that our mother, father, and preceptor taught us. . . [T]he language ofour home is Tamil; the language of our land is Tamil. (quoted in Ramaswamy1997: 11)the goddess and the nation563"},{"pageNumber":570,"pageContent":"Such a declaration reflects a new sentiment in which the language comes tobe imagined, for the first time, as the personal property of their speakers as a col-lective. The myriad practices of Tamil devotion place the people who speak Tamilat the very center of the project, as an imagined community of “Tamilians”(tamil ̄ar). This people-centered ideology of modernity inaugurates a patrimonialimagination in which language is constituted as a tangible, material possessionthat is transmitted from one generation of its speakers to another who relate toit as a property-owning “collective individual.” It is such a new imaginationwhich enables, indeed needs, the figure of Tamil ̄tta ̄y as the “mother” of all Tamilspeakers who are converted into each other’s siblings by virtue of the fact thatthey have been borne by her “womb” and nurtured on her “milk,” and who inturn reproduce other future speakers.The geopiety that produces the imagination of India as Bha ̄rat Ma ̄ta ̄ is simi-larly new because the national territory that she embodies is configured in anovel way – as a clearly delineated piece of Earth that is imagined as the exclu-sive, sovereign, and collective property of its inhabitants, the nation’s citizens.The proprietary relationship between the nation’s citizens and the territory theyinhabit comes to be best signified by maps of the nation that proliferate in theage of nationalism across the modern world, India included. Not surprisingly,visual representations of Bha ̄rat Ma ̄ta ̄, the “mother” of the nation, show her inthe company of maps and globes (on which “India” is delineated) from the earlyyears of the twentieth century. In some cases, she occupies the entire map ofIndia, in other cases, she appears to rise from it, in still others she replaces thecartographic outline of India with her own body (Ramaswamy 2001; 2002). Itis the territorialization of the goddess thus, through her association with aspecifically delineated “geo-body” (Thongchai 1994) that colonial and post-colonial geographical identify as “India,” which arguably sets apart Bha ̄rat Ma ̄ta ̄from Pr.ithvı ̄, the older goddess of Earth. The incorporation of the modern map (as indeed the Indian tricolor flag which she frequently holds) into theiconography of Bha ̄rat Ma ̄ta ̄ signifies a novel way of relating to territory – as ageobody that is rendered visible to the citizen-devotee’s eye through cartographicpractices.In both Tamil devotion and Indian geopiety, the objects of their adulation –the Tamil language and the Indian territory – are transformed from rarifiedabstractions into embodied entities that can be seen and touched. They are, inother words, framed as “pictures.” In a provocative essay that has been thesubject of much critical discussion, Martin Heidegger has observed that “thefundamental event of the modern age is the conquest of the world as picture.”In making this observation, he was in essence underscoring the emergence ofthe modern subject who stands abstracted from a world that he could observeas “a whole,” and in turn, manipulate and have at his “disposal.” “There beginsthat way of being human that means the realm of human quality as a domaingiven over to measuring and executing, for the purpose of gaining mastery overthat which is as a whole” (Heidegger 1977: 132–5). In the last analysis, it isbecause Tamil ̄tta ̄y and Bha ̄rat Ma ̄ta ̄ are such “pictures,” allowing their devotees564sumathi ramaswamy"},{"pageNumber":571,"pageContent":"to see as “a whole” the entities that they embody, that I characterize the imagi-nations that gave birth to them as “modern.” As pictures, they place the lan-guage and the terrritory that they represent at the “disposal” of their speakersand inhabitants repectively, sealing the new proprietary attitudes towards“Tamil” and “India” that have been ushered in by modernity. The subterfuges ofantiquity to which their votaries resort notwithstanding, it is the cunning ofmodernity that enables the very imagination of Tamil ̄tta ̄y and Bha ̄rat Ma ̄ta ̄ asicons of new collective identites.Notes1For brief discussions of Tamil ̄tta ̄y’s presence in Sri Lankan Tamil culture, see Daniel1989: 35–6 and Suseendirarajah 1980.2For example, in all the poetry in Tamil on Bha ̄rat Ma ̄ta ̄ that I have read from thetwentieth century, she is never imagined as a widow, whereas Indira Chowdhurynotes that she does so appear in the imagination of Bengali patriots of the 1860s and 1870s. It is possible that this in itself reflects the preoccupation with the plightof widowhood among Bengali social reformers in the later half of the nineteenthcentury (Chowdhury 1998: 96–7). Similarly, see Joseph Alter’s thoughtful com-ments on how the understanding of Bha ̄rat Mata in the wrestling communities ofnorthern India is significantly different from the “xenophobic chauvinism” thatmarks the Hindu nationalists (Alter 1996: 126–9).3There are numerous works on the hymn and its subsequent history, much of it fairlyhagiographic and patriotic in content. For some useful observations, see Bose 1974and Das 1984.4A crore is a unit of measure which is equivalent to ten million. This figure betraysthe fact that Bankim’s “Mother” was really Banga Ma ̄ta ̄ (Mother Bengal) rather thanBha ̄ rat Ma ̄ta ̄ (Bose 1997: 53).5It has to be noted that quite frequently, Bha ̄rat Ma ̄ta ̄ appears wearing a saree andblouse in a style that became popular only from the later half of the nineteenthcentury – yet another telltale sign of her modernity. For a perceptive essay that con-siders the politics of “clothing’ the goddess figure more generally in the pictorial prac-tices of colonial and postcolonial India, see Guha-Thakurtha 1999.6Even when she occasionally appears holding a printed book – invariably theTirukkur ̄alor the Tolka ̄ppiyam– rather than cadjan leaves, this is carefully selectedfrom Tamil’s corpus of ancient rather than modern works.ReferencesAgulhon, Maurice. 1980.

The gender of the human being, the soul, and the deityare articulated, commented upon, debated, contested, performed through songand dance, poetry and theology. The discourses range from equating gender with biological sex, essentializing the “womanly” and “manly” characteristics,to changing behavior patterns which point to fluid gender identifications, to therejection and transcendence of gender polarities. The resources for such discus-sions can be sought in brahminical Sanskrit literature which is frequently patri-archal in tone, vernacular poems, songs, narratives, rituals, icons, arrangementof temple spaces, folklore, and performing arts. The materials are plenty – weare looking at over 3,000 years of literature and over 4,000 years of materialculture. One can move through the labyrinths of S ́iva or Vis.n.u worship, or seekreinforcements for gender theories through literature and rituals relating to theGoddess. We find many socially celebrated narratives and rituals of deities anddevotees taking on roles and raiments associated with the “other sex.” One mayspend the entire chapter deconstructing the many dimensions of Vis.n.u’s incar-nation as the enchanting woman, Mohinı ̄, and its commemoration in annualtemple rituals. We could explore the portrayal of deities in iconography andpopular calendar art to see how and why they are depicted as simultaneouslyhaving what may be “commonly” perceived as “male” and“female” attributes.Alternatively, one may look at social constructions of gender by just looking atwhat is called India’s “third sex” – the transgendered hijracommunity. On theother hand, philosophical discourses push us away from gender dichotomies tospaces which transcend the traditional polarities. The Hindu traditions have a wealth of materials which can inform us on how some human beings haveunderstood gender in many ways over four millennia; narratives and arts whichcan contribute to the current academic discourses on gender."},{"pageNumber":576,"pageContent":"In this chapter, I will discuss issues relating to gender in a modest fashion byusing the S ́rı ̄vais.n.ava tradition – one of the well known communities in southIndia and one which has a dominant influence in temple rituals in NorthAmerica – as a thread to lead us through literature and rituals, songs and dance.Although the gender of the human being, soul, and the deity are all important,I will spend more time talking about devotees and the soul. There will only be abrief discussion on the all-important topic of gender and God in Hinduism, atopic which is worthy of a monograph on its own; and regretfully, no discussionat all of India’s “third sex.”1Since the Hindu traditions have transmitted theirlore over centuries through the performing arts, I will allude to them severaltimes. Even though it will not be possible to cover many areas in this chapter,using one tradition as a “base camp,” I hope, will give us a vista point to look atthe expansive landscape.The Gender of the DevoteeThe mother says of her “daughter”:Night and day, her eyes know no sleep.She splashes her tears with her hands.O conch, O wheel,she cries and folds her hand;O Lotus eyesshe cries and grows faint.How can I survive without you?she asks, and searches the earth, groping with her hands.O Lord of Tiruvarankam, where red kayalfish dart in the waters, what are you doing with her?(Tiruva ̄ymoli, 7.2.1)So sang the poet Namma ̄l ̄va ̄r in the ninth century ce. This song, which is partof a set of 11 verses, embedded in longer poem of 1,102 verses, is recited in someVis.n.u temples in south India every day and acted out in a ritual once a year. Hispoem, the Tiruva ̄ymoli (“Sacred Utterance”) is addressed to Vis.n.u, whom headdresses as a mother, father, support of all being, child, and lover. AlthoughNamma ̄l ̄va ̄r was a male, like many other devotional poets, he frequently spokein the voice of a woman in his poems. His image, thought to be charged with hispresence, is enshrined in many temples including the sacred temple town ofS ́rı ̄ran.gam. During the ritual in which this particular verse is enacted, he isdressed as a beautiful woman. Exquisitely clad in silk clothes, with an artificialbraid flowing from “his” head, and bejeweled, he is taken to meet “her” lover –the Lord Vis.n.u. In song and ritual, Namma ̄l ̄va ̄r, the male poet, is portrayed aswoman longing for “her” beloved.Namma ̄l ̄va ̄r’s stance as a woman in this poem and in the ritual, waiting forthe male God, is a trope that runs through the many Hindu samprada ̄yasor tra-ditions. It comes up in literature, song and dance, and rituals, and we will use it570vasudha narayanan"},{"pageNumber":577,"pageContent":"to lead us into the issue of gender in the Hindu traditions. Namma ̄l ̄va ̄r wrotefour poems and in all of these he seeks to be united with Lord Vis.n.u. He is oneof 12 poet-saints considered as paradigmatic devotees by a community calledS ́rı ̄Vais.n.ava. This community worships the Goddess S ́rı ̄ (Laks.mı ̄) and Vis.n.u andconsiders the words of these 12 poet-saints to be a revelation, a Tamil Veda, par-alleling the Sanskrit Vedas. In the eleventh century cethe S ́rı ̄Vais.n.ava commu-nity introduced the Tiruva ̄ymoli into the temple and home liturgies and beganto comment on it – initially, orally and through the performing arts, and thenlater in writing. Selections from the Tiruva ̄ymoli are recited daily at S ́rı ̄vais.n.avahomes and temples. A full recitation with verbal and performative commen-taries is also held during the Adhyayana Utsava, the annual Festival of Recita-tion. The program for 21 days starting with the new moon includes (a) therecitation of poems; (b) processions of the festival image through the streets; (c)the dressing up of the festival image of Vis.n.u and the poets in various costumes;(d) enactment of particular episodes from the saints’ poetry or the epics byspecial cantor/actors called araiyarsin S ́rı ̄ran.gam, S ́rı ̄vil.l.put.t.ur, and A ̄lva ̄rTiruna ̄gari, all temple towns in the state of Tamilnadu, India. Of the manyactivities that take place during these celebrations, we will, in the course of thischapter, just look at two: the songs of Namma ̄l ̄va ̄r (and other poets) composedfrom the voice of a woman, and particularly, the dressing up of Namma ̄l ̄va ̄r asa young girl, and second, the portrayal of the male God, Vis.n.u, as an “enchant-ing woman” (Sanskrit: mohinı ̄), to see how gender can function in some Hindutraditions. Specifically we will explore how the human being, the soul, and theSupreme Being are gendered in literature and the performing arts.The Poet as a Woman: Namma ̄l ̄va ̄r’s Words for “Her” BelovedAbout a quarter of the Tiruva ̄ymoli is written from the voice of a woman.Namma ̄l ̄va ̄r speaks through the voices of “women” characters whose literaryroles were well known in Tamil poetry written in the first few years of thecommon era. In the love poems written around the first and second centuries ce(Ramanujan, Hart, Narayanan) we meet young women and men in love. Thepoet – frequently male – speaks in the voices of a young girl in love, or her motheror friend who seem concerned about her welfare. None of the men nor thewomen alluded to in these poems were named; the poems were supposed to be “universal” and naming them would limit them. Namma ̄l ̄va ̄r adopts thesevoices; however, in this case, both the lovers are named. The “young woman” isNamma ̄l ̄va ̄r, and the “young man” is Lord Vis.n.u. The later S ́rı ̄vais.n.ava traditioneven gave a name for Namma ̄l ̄va ̄r’s guise as a woman: they call “her” personal-ity Parankusa Na ̄yaki or the Lady Parankusa. Tirumankai a ̄l ̄va ̄r, another malepoet who wrote such poetry is called the Lady Parakala by the community.In the temple town of S ́rı ̄ran.gam, when the works of these poets (along withthose of ten others) are recited annually during the Festival of Recitation, somegender in a devotional universe571"},{"pageNumber":578,"pageContent":"episodes are acted out in rituals over a 21-day period in front of the icon of Vis.n.u.These are attended by thousands of people, with about 400,000 pilgrims comingin on important days. Vis.n.u, in S ́rı ̄ran.gam, is called Ran.gana ̄tha, the “lord ofthe stage” or the “lord of the island.” Although the main icon within the innershrine depicts him as reclining on the coils of the serpent called Ananta(“without end,” “infinity”), the smaller festival icon of him standing upright isused in procession and celebrations such as the Festival of Recitation. On thetenth day of the recitation, this icon of Vis.n.u is dressed as a woman. This isconsidered to be a very special annual event and the ritual is called “Mohinı ̄alankaram” (“the adornment as an entrancing woman.”) The crowds are thethickest on this day and the next, the eleventh day after new moon (ekadas ́) inthe month of Margasirsa (December 15 to January 14). Vis.n.u, clad in white andred silks, with beautiful jewelry sparkles as a woman. “She” is taken in a pro-cession around the temple as the throngs worship “her.” This attire and dress-ing of Vis.n.u is a special favorite with the pilgrims; “truly,” they say every year,“tonight, the Lord is more beautiful than the Goddess (Laks.mı ̄) herself.”The recitation of the Tiruva ̄ymoli begins the next day; the eleventh day of thefestival. On the seventeenth day of the festival (that is seventh day of theTiruva ̄ymoli recitation), the section in which Namma ̄l ̄va ̄r, in the voice of awoman addresses, the lord at S ́rı ̄ran.gam (the poem given in the beginning ofthis chapter) is acted out. Just before the celebrations that day, the image ofNamma ̄l ̄va ̄r is dressed as a woman in beautiful silk garments, with a hairpieceand artificial limbs. The Lady Parankusa, as “she” is known, is carried in a palan-quin to the Hall of a Thousand Pillars and the araiyarsby “her” side recite poemswith emotion. As they finish the moving verses, depicting “her” intense longingfor union with the Lord of S ́rı ̄ran.gam, the priests who are standing by Vis.n.u’sicon, lift him from his palanquin into their arms and walk towards Namma ̄l ̄va ̄r.This festival icon of Vis.n.u, known popularly as “the Handsome Bridegroom,”seems to be almost walking towards the devotee to be with “her” for a raptur-ous union, and the crowds applaud. The following day, Namma ̄l ̄va ̄r is back inthe Hall, back again in his usual clothes.Sometimes, Namma ̄l ̄va ̄r, Tirumankai A ̄l ̄va ̄r, and other poets, step outside theTamil literary conventions and see themselves as participants in an episode fromthe epics, the Ra ̄mayana or the Maha ̄bha ̄rata, or one of the stories of Kr.s.n.a(an incarnation of Vis.n.u) given in the Pura ̄n.as, devotional texts composed in thefirst millennium ce. Namma ̄l ̄va ̄r, and especially Tirumankai, see themselves aswomen connected with Kr.s.n.a and speak in the voices of Yas ́oda ̄, Kr.s.n.a’s fostermother, or one of the cowherd girls. The following verse by Namma ̄l ̄va ̄r is typicalof the genre:You were gone the whole day,grazing cows Kanna!Your soothing words burn my soul.Evening tramples like a rogue elephantand the fragrance of jasmine buds,572vasudha narayanan"},{"pageNumber":579,"pageContent":"loosening my bonds, blows upon me.Embrace my beautiful breastswith the fragrance of the wild jasmineupon your radiant chest.Give me the nectar of your mouth,and with your jeweled lotus hands.adorn my lowly head.The poet’s identifying himself as a “gopi,” one of the many cowherd girls whois in love with Kr.s.n.a, is a motif that we find in literature all over India. Althoughthis is one of the earlier examples, in time, the love of the gopis, especially thatof Ra ̄dha ̄, the girlfriend and consort of Kr.s.n.a, is seen as exemplary. Some poetsapproach Kr.s.n.a and speak as though they were the cowherd girl (Hardy,Hawley); others, in later centuries speak in the voices of Ra ̄dha ̄’s girlfriends. Menand women poets adopt the voices of girls speaking directly to Vis.n.u or Kr.s.n.a;though as Hawley has shown, at least in the north Indian sixteenth-centuryliterature, there isa discernible difference in the voice of the woman poet Mı ̄ra ̄and the voice of the male poet Sur who adopts a woman’s voice (Hawley 1986).The human being addressing the deity as a male lover is pronounced in someof the performing arts in the Hindu culture, especially classical dance. One hasto note three elements in this scenario: first, that the intensity of the passionarticulated in the song – whether it is distress or wrath at the lover not coming– is palpable and it is not simplyorjusta metaphor for or an allegorical descrip-tion of the separation (viraha) between the human soul and the Supreme Being.To explain it away as only spiritual separation is to take away from the integrityof the poet’s experience and his/her stark emotion. One cannot interpret awaythe intensity of the poet’s bodily longing as an allegory; one cannot speak simplyin terms of the soul’s quest for god. That is to lose sight of the drama of the poet’slonging and love. Second, the devotional theme and the spiritual longing are alsointegral themes undergirding or sometimes overt in the songs and dances; wecannot by any measure think of these songs as justromantic fictions or conceits.Finally, one cannot simply speak about the “lover” poems (“na ̄yaki bha ̄va,” “modeof the heroine”) and songs as a monolithic genre. There are many varieties of such “lover” poems with different portrayals of women; different notions of“femininities.” It is this last point that I will be nuancing, to show that onecannot automatically stereotype the woman’s voice as the helpless, pining lover.One of the many ways in which the separation between God and the humanbeing is portrayed is by speaking of the agony that prevails when one is sepa-rated from one’s beloved. Frequently, one is suspicious of one’s lover; a suspicionthat transforms itself into wrath or distress. In many songs that are choreo-graphed and performed in the Bha ̄rata Natyam style, Vis.n.u, S ́iva, or Murgan ̄, allrevered Gods in the Hindu tradition, are seen as the absent or errant male. While,in general, the mood in the early Tamil poems (as in the Tiruva ̄ymoli) we seemore verses where a poet speaks in a distressed, “pining” tone than in an angryone, this is by no means the only sentiment expressed in the “woman’s” voice.gender in a devotional universe573"},{"pageNumber":580,"pageContent":"Some women poets like A ̄n.d.a ̄l (eighth century) tease Kr.s.n.a as “a prankster whoknows no dharma” (Nacciyar Tirumoli14: 4) and Namma ̄l ̄va ̄r, in anger, speaksof Vis.n.u as the “cruel, wicked one” (Tiruva ̄ymoli 5.3.5). Namma ̄l ̄va ̄r, in the voiceof a woman, also threatens to “ride the ‘palmyrah horse’ ” (Tamil: matal) to showthe extremity of “her” passion for Vis.n.u:Lifting my modesty, stealing my heartthe Lord of the divine ones reaches the high heavens.My friend, this I swear:I shall shock all the earth,I shall do weird deedsand like a wild womanride the palmyra stem like a horse.With no sense of shame, I shall ridethe palmyra stem through every street in townand women from all the lands will cheer me onAnd I shall demand from the Lorda cool blossom from the tulai plantand adorn my head with it.(Tiruva ̄ymoli 5.3.9–10)This is an allusion to a ritual in which a manpublicly proclaimed his love for awoman by making an artificial horse using sharp palmyra leaves and “riding it”through the village. The ritual is described in Tamil literature in the first two cen-turies of the common era. The lover, the hero, was now willing to throw all cir-cumspection to the winds and publicly announce his love for a young girl. Theheroine, the village leaders, and families of the young man and woman, wouldall be convinced of his passion, and hastily facilitated his union with his beloved.This ritual threatened to hurt the man physically and was considered to be anextreme step; the villagers, witnessing it, would be convinced that he had to getmarried to his love immediately and arrange for the wedding. “Riding a palmyrahorse” was supposed to have been practiced only by men; Tamil texts describinglove proscribed it for women. The act, even for men, was considered to be “scan-dalous.” In Namma ̄l ̄va ̄r’s poem, we have a “double” crossing over – Namma ̄l ̄va ̄r,a male, speaking as a woman, who wants to act like a male. The “essentializing”of women that may be perceived in the figure of a love sick girl of Tamil poetryis teased into other modes of behavior. We see a different twist in this scenarioin a poem by Tirumankai A ̄l ̄va ̄r, also around the ninth century ce. Tirumankai,also in the voice of a “girl,” wants to ride the palmyra horse, but acknowledgesthat a woman resorting to this act is against the rules of love, at least accordingto Tamil conventions. He says:It is true we have heard and understand that in southern texts that it is not fit foryoung girls, girls with glances soft as a fawn, girls with the gait of a swan, to discardtheir shame and modesty and ride the matalfor their men. But we do not accept it.We hold up the path shown in the north. (Periya tiru matal 21)574vasudha narayanan"},{"pageNumber":581,"pageContent":"Note that Tirumankai A ̄l ̄va ̄r says clearly that he knows the grammar of Tamiland the grammar of love in Tamil lands do not countenance women doing thematal. However, he says, he accepts the “northern” path. Women in the north,he says, ride the matalto show their unbridled passion for men. In his poems, helists some of these women.It is obvious that the concept and ritual ofmatalis completely south Indian.Yet, when Tirumankai lists his examples of women who recklessly proclaimedtheir love in northern India, he rounds up the usual suspects and then some. Hislists include Uma ̄, Ulupi, Us.a (daughter of Banasura), Vega ̄vatı ̄ and Va ̄savadatta,all women whose passion for their lovers has been celebrated in written and oraltraditions. He also includes Sı ̄ta ̄, who though known for the love she had forRa ̄ma, is hardly the hotheaded exemplar of a matalriding lover. What Tiru-mankai is saying is that these women articulated their love in public and wereprepared to die if it was not reciprocated. Understandably, some of this is exag-geration, but one gets the point. Uma ̄ is Parvati and as Sa ̄tı ̄ had burnt herselfto display the pride of her love for S ́iva. Ulupi married Arjuna, Va ̄savadatta, andVe ga ̄vatı ̄ figure in stories in the Kathasarita sa ̄gara. Ulupi, a woman, actually kidnapped Arjuna and took him to her land; Us.a had a young man calledAniruddha (Kr.s.n.a’s grandson) abducted and brought to her chambers.Uma ̄/Sa ̄tı ̄ killed herself. By stating this, Tirumankai says that it is acceptable forwomen to go public with their passion because it is done in northern India, eventhough he is aware it is not inadmissible in the Tamil country. What we have in this traditional literature is the painting of north and south Indian cultures andwomanhood according to south Indian texts in broad strokes; what we have is a kindof “essentializing” of cultures and gender, and a ninth-century “protest” against theessentializing of gender.And so, while Tirumankai, a man, has adopted the stanceof a woman in love, he feels that desperate times call for desperate deeds and heis willing to take the initiative and declare his love publicly.In any event, the love-sick woman is only oneof the many kinds of womenportrayed in literature. Speaking just about women in love, there are many dis-cernible in texts and drama. This figure of the “heroine” or the primary char-acter/dancer is developed in the Natya S ́a ̄straor “Treatise on Dance,” attributedto the sage Bha ̄rata. This text, possibly compiled around the first two centuriesof the Common Era, outlines the principal features of classical dance in its reli-gious context. The Natya S ́a ̄strabecomes the reference for almost all classicaldance forms of India in later centuries. In this text, Bha ̄rata speaks about eightdifferent kinds of “heroines.” These are women in different kinds of romanticsituations whom the dancer can portray in her performance. The “heroines” inthese dramatic situations are: one who adorns herself expecting union with herlover; one who controls her husband by her love; one who is separated from herlover because of a quarrel; one distressed by separation from her lover; one whois enraged with her lover; one who is deceived by her lover; one whose husbandis away on work; and one who boldly proceeds to meet her lover. Obviously, someof these are not quiet, resigned and patient women; they are dramatic, passion-ate, and subjects of the story, not characters who have been objectified. In textgender in a devotional universe575"},{"pageNumber":582,"pageContent":"and performance, these “heroines” are the intense women in love; in religiouscommentary and interpretation, they represent the human soul and the “lover”is the “male” deity. He has either not come to see his girlfriend (portrayed by thedancer), or is involved with another girl. Depending on the scene that is depictedin the song, the dancer (na ̄yika ̄or the “heroine”) exudes grief, anger, or rage athis tardiness or imagined behavior. The stances for such a behavior are pre-scribed by formulaic convention; thus there are a range of moods expressedwhen the deity, here envisaged as the male lover, is just absent, or when he isknown to have spent time with another woman. The Bha ̄rata Natyam dancerecitals are replete with dozens of such songs.In literature and performing arts, the romance and the passion between thesoul and God is sometimes seen to be similar to that between Sı ̄ta ̄ and Ra ̄ma, thewoman poet Meera and Kr.s.n.a, or Ra ̄dha ̄ and Kr.s.n.a. Sı ̄ta ̄ was married to Ra ̄maand they belonged to each other (svakı ̄ya ̄); but Meera, and in some versions ofthe story, Ra ̄dha ̄, were married to other men (parakı ̄ya), yet longed for Kr.s.n.a. Insome cases, a woman may be seen as belonging to “all” and only going to oneman for a price (samanya). These three situations become paradigms for thehuman–divine relationship in poetry, song, theology, literary and performativecommentaries. Consider the following “padam,” a genre of classical Karnatikmusic in south India, which is sung by musicians and choreographed bydancers. It belongs to the second category; that is, a woman who is married toone man, yet longs for another:My dear, handsome, good natured Venugopala!I was married when I was very young.Now, my husband beckons – and I have to take leave.But do not forget the love I have for you.The lotus and sun are distant from each other – but the distance is insignificant2And so too, wherever I am, my heart will be at your feet.I shall always regard only you as my LordAnd that gives me the courage to bear all that comes my way in life.(Attributed to Ks.etrayya, seventeenth century;Sahana raga3)The voice of the woman in this and later padams is not that of a helplesswoman who simply waits for her “man” to come. Here is a married woman whois addressing her lover, in violation of the norms. Songs such as these and thoseof the woman poet Mı ̄ra ̄ remind us that chastity and marital fidelity, which arecrucial concepts in understanding of women in the normative texts on dharma,are bypassed when a woman is enthralled with her “man.” The environment iseven more different in some other padams which speak of the samanı ̄ya ̄heroine;the one who will go to the highest bidder. The speaker is the male lyricist,Ks.etrayya, speaking in the voice of a sophisticated courtesan:Pour gold as high as I stand, I still won’t sleep with you.Why be stubborn, Muvva Gopala? Why all these tricks?You set women afloat on your words,576vasudha narayanan"},{"pageNumber":583,"pageContent":"break into their secret places,deceive them with affectionate lies,excite them in love play,get together the whole crowd one day,and then you steal away like a spinach thief . . .You opportunist,you excite them from moment to moment,make mouths water,show them love to make them surrender,drown them in a sea of passion,and by the time the morning star appears –you get up and vanish.Pour gold as high as I stand.(Ramanujan et al. 1994: 98–9)The protagonist is a worldly, educated woman, a courtesan from urban sur-roundings. We have sensual, sophisticated poems from a streetsmart woman,one who appeared in public like the men in the seventeenth century. It has beenobserved of this courtesan: “We thus achieve an image of autonomous, evenbrazen, womanhood, a far cry from the rather helpless female victim of theabsent god in Tamil bhakti. . . in contrast to the torn female personality of Tamilbhakti, the courtesan in these poems is remarkably self-possessed” (Ramanujanet al. 1994: 38).Thus, the love between the human being and the deity is articulated as therelationship between a woman and a man against the backdrop of early Tamilpoetry and Sanskrit “heroines” in Bha ̄rata’s Treatise on Dance. The male or femalepoet, speaking in the manyvoices of a woman-lover, languishes, laments,cajoles, chides, threatens, and teases. The passion is striking, the drama, as agood drama should be, is engrossing.But the lover is not the only kind of woman’s voice that the male poet speaksin. Sometimes, he is Yas ́oda ̄, the foster mother of the toddler Kr.s.n.a, wanting tobathe him, comb his hair, drink his milk, and so on. Sometimes the poet is oneof the cowherd girls who is complaining about Kr.s.n.a to Yas ́oda ̄ about his appar-ent childish mischief that is tinged with erotic sentiments:O mother Yas ́oda ̄:At twilight, the other day, he came, as though one familiar with me!He showed many tricks, he played with me.Holding and pulling my garment, he demanded a ball of butter,and so he warred with me, not letting go...“Thaaye Yas ́oda ̄” in the raga Thodi by Oothukadu Venkata Subbaiyaiyar4The twilight time is the hour for clandestine meeting between lovers. Yet herewe see a child Kr.s.n.a who gets into trouble and who teases the cowherd girl.Whether it is Kulasekara A ̄l ̄va ̄r in the eighth century, Oothukadu Venkata SubbaIyer in the eighteenth century, or Ambujam Kr.s.n.a, the sensitive woman lyricistgender in a devotional universe577"},{"pageNumber":584,"pageContent":"in the twentieth century, the rasaor “flavor” created by the voice of a cowherdgirl taunting Yas ́oda ̄ about the toddler Kr.s.n.a’s mischief, has been one that Hindudevotees have enjoyed in song and in dance. In other verses, the male poet in thevoice of the mother or friend spank and scold Kr.s.n.a for his alleged mischief. The voices are many; the masks, numerous; the moods, ranging from distress to delight.In what ways does this role-playing inform us about gender? Some may arguethat in the laments of the lovesick woman as well as in the ritual withNamma ̄l ̄va ̄r, the portrayal projects a social, “patriarchal” relationship on to andreplicates the male–female social power structure in the human–divine rela-tionship. This, indeed, is true in many instances, where the deity is seen as thesupreme “Man” (Purus.ottama) and the woman’s “lowliness” is exalted. In somecases, it is not just a “lowering” of a male to assume the role of a female, butthat of a low-caste cowherd girl as well (Hawley 1986). Should we then look atgender like caste assume that since a woman seems obviously lower than menin Hindu society the male poets assume the female role?Such a concept of gender would be correct, but only partiallycorrect. As wejust saw, the “helpless” woman is just oneof the voices the male poet takes; healso takes those of a mother in command of her child; an excited cowherd girl;a lover who wants to proclaim “her” love to the whole village; a sophisticated,worldly-wise courtesan; and a wrathful lover, among other roles. In some rarecases, the male poet also takes on the voice of a father. In the following poem,Kulacekara A ̄l ̄va ̄r (ca. eighth century ce) speaks in the voice of Ra ̄ma’s father,who, as we see in the poem is separated from his son:The words of Ra ̄ ma’s father Das ́aratha:Without hearing him call me “Father” with pride and with love,Without clasping his chest adorned with gems to mine,Without embracing him, without smoothing his forehead,Without seeing his graceful gait, majestic like the elephant,Without seeing his face (glowing) like the lotus,I, wretched one,having lost my son, my lord,still live.(Kulacekara A ̄l ̄va ̄r, Perumal Tirumoli9.6)In this and other poems, it is the ache of the separation that comes through; therole is one which depicts the vehemence of this distress. In some ardent poems,the poet assumes the role of a woman who is “possessed” by a male deity whomshe loves; thus the cries are both plaintive and powerful. Namma ̄l ̄va ̄r, the samepoet who spoke so achingly about “her” lover’s absence, says in the voice of the“heroine’s” mother:“It is I who created the earth and the sea,It is I who am the earth and the sea . . .It is I who ate the world and the sea578vasudha narayanan"},{"pageNumber":585,"pageContent":"Is my daughter possessed bythe Lord of the earth and the sea?What can I tell my daughter,who claims to know the earth and the sea?”(Tiruva ̄ymoli, 5.6.1)In this poem the “mother” of the heroine speaks in wonderment about herdaughter who exults in her “union” with her lover. Namma ̄l ̄va ̄r, the male, isspeaking as a “mother” of her “girl” who is acting like the male deity. This doubleswitch (male acting like a female who is “possessed” by a male”) is not verycommon, but shows the fluidity of gender. “She” seems possessed by him;empowered and hardly distressed.A dominant paradigm in Hindu literature, as we saw, is to depict the soul’sseparation from the deity by having the male take on the voice and role of thefemale. The overarching archetypes are the cowherd girls separation from Kr.s.n.aand the separation between the “hero” and “heroine” in Tamil poetry. Both thesework themselves out in texts, arts, and rituals all over India. Although thisassumption of a female role is common, we must note that such an assumptionin not necessarily always one sided. We just saw a male assuming the role ofother males who have experienced the “separation” situations.5In some rituals,a woman saint may take on the role of a male; thus in rituals in S ́rı ̄Villiputturin the state of Tamilnadu, A ̄n.d.a ̄l, the eighth-century woman poet sometimeswears the dress of the male deity, Kr.s.n.a.Whether it is a male or a female then, what is stressed is the intensity of thepassion which can be depicted in many voices. The hierarchies seem to shift butit is not based only on gender – the mother, courtesan, or friend does not cringe infront of the lover.Here and elsewhere (Narayanan 1999) we see that gender isonly one of the terms in Hindu hierarchies: there is caste, class, stage of life, age,and relationship among other factors which contribute to hierarchies. Genderhere seems functional; when the mood warrants it, various roles are taken andthere is no unilateral hierarchy in the literature. The many voices are importantin the poet’s articulation of love and no hierarchy (at least the south Indianexamples) is seen in between the various kinds of love. The voices of women andmen in certain kinds of relationships are valued and privileged in this discourseand in the changing roles, hierarchies are done, redone, affirmed, and subverted.The Gender of the Soul: Three Encounters betweenExemplary Men and WomenThe poet, the human being assumes and moves between various gender roles. Itis clear that in text and ritual, the human being assumes various genders. But,does the soul have a gender? We saw in the ritual of Namma ̄l ̄va ̄r in S ́rı ̄ran.gamand in the songs of many male poets that they think of themselves as a woman.gender in a devotional universe579"},{"pageNumber":586,"pageContent":"Let us come back to this question after considering three short narratives, allwell known in local regions of India.There is only one male in BrindavanA popular story about the woman saint Mı ̄ra ̄(fifteenth century) narrates her meeting with Jı ̄v Goswa ̄mi, a holy man and atheologian. Jı ̄v Goswa ̄mi refuses to have anything to do with her – or any woman– even though she is filled with love for Lord Kr.s.n.a. She gently chides him andreminds him that there is only one “Male” in all of Brindavan (the land whereKr.s.n.a played with the “gopis”) and, indeed, the universe – Kr.s.n.a. All other beingsare “female” in relationship to him (Hawley, 1988: 126 and 203).6Goswa ̄mi sawthe point and saw her.Tresses, not dressesMahadeviakka, a woman poet of the eleventh century, in the Karnataka region, walks out on her husband, a king. She goes in searchof her lover, Lord S ́iva, and his devotees. In time, she is so focused on S ́iva thatshe loses all sense of her own appearance; “she appears to have thrown awayeven modesty and clothing, those last concessions to the male world, in a gesture of ultimate social defiance, and wandered about covered in her tresses”(Ramanujan 1967: 112). She goes to Kalyana where the saints Allama andBasava have a congregation of devotees and run a school for them. Ramanujancalls the dialog between Allama and Mahadeviakka as one between “sceptic and love child which turned into a catechism between guru and disciple” (112).When Allama asked Mahadeviakka who her husband was, she said she wasmarried forever to S ́iva-Chennamallikarjuna (“S ́iva who is white as jasmine”).Allama then asked her why she had taken off her clothes as though by that actshe had peeled off her illusions; and yet, she was covered with her hair. He asks:if she was so free and pure in heart, why did she have to replace her sari with acovering of tresses? Mahadeviakka replies that “Till the fruit is ripe inside theskin will not fall off ” and goes on to say dryly that if she were to display her body,it would hurt him! (Ramanujan 112–13). She is accepted into the company ofsaints; but restless, she leaves them in search of her divine lover. WhileMahadeviakka is apparently not self-conscious about her own body and femalenakedness she recognizes that others do not have the same perception – butwhen they do, she implies, her femaleness and her body should not matter.No admission, without permissionA story in the epic Maha ̄bha ̄rata (XII.321)speaks about Sulabha ̄, a woman with great religious knowledge, who apparentlywants to see if King Janaka is truly enlightened. At her request, Janaka expandson his spiritual attainment and affirms that he is enlightened. He concludes bysaying that his soul is free of all attachment, is fixed on the supreme truth, andthat he treats all creatures equally. Sulabha ̄ wants to see if this is true andthrough her own yogic powers enters his mind. Janaka accuses her of trying to580vasudha narayanan"},{"pageNumber":587,"pageContent":"seduce him, a righteous man. He tells her that she has no right to pollute himwith her touch. Sulabha ̄ is not affected by his decrying her; she says that he hasconfused the soul and the body, for she has not touched him at all.True, our bodies should not touch, but I have not touched you with any part of mybody. I rest in you like a drop of water on a lotus leaf, without permeating it in theleast. How can you distinguish between souls which are in essence the same? Howcan you call the contact of two enlightened beings unlawful? (Leslie 1983: 89)Sulabha ̄ concludes that anyone so obsessed with the external fact that she is awoman cannot be enlightened (Leslie 1983: 99).All three stories, all encounters between a male and a female, address the notionof gender directly. In all of them, the male figure is the learned, wise patriarch,the acknowledged “saint.” The first two stories reverse many hierarchies tradi-tionally accepted in many Hindu communities – male gender, meditative focus,priestly functions, learning are all questioned by a woman who is obsessed withdevotion to God. They, of course, highlight the importance of devotion overritual practice and male learning. If it were not for the last story (and manyothers in the Hindu tradition) we would almost be tempted to think of traditionallearning as male and devotion as female. But it is not so simple.The first story flows with the some of the moods in the devotional poetry we saw earlier – the deity is the male, and all, including Jı ̄v Goswa ̄mi, are femalein relation to the divine. And yet, here and in many stories, the learned or thehigh-caste male forgets it (Venkatachari), and the female devotee has to nudgehim, “awaken” him. In the second story, Mahadeviakka knows only S ́iva as abridegroom. She is gendered as a devotee, but she is oblivious to her body. Theouter signs of her biological womanhood do not matter to her as a person, yetshe is aware that the male saint is aware of it. Her answer is ambiguous; butRamanujan and others have interpreted her as saying that while she is indiffer-ent to her body (and its sexuality), this nominal covering with her hair is herconcession to the male company around her. Eventually, though, she implies, itwill not, should not matter; that is just the shell.Which brings us to the last story. Sulabha ̄ is clearly a woman and Janaka a man.They meet as peers, as philosophers and aspirants in search of enlightenment.Both are knowledgeable, both engaged in the practice of religious exercises.Janaka thinks of himself as enlightened but is conscious, indeed, outraged overhis suspicion that Sulabha ̄’s femaleness will somehow compromise his enlight-enment. Sulabha ̄’s answer is very different than Mı ̄ra ̄’s query to Jı ̄v Goswa ̄mi. Itis not the case that allbeings are female; it is that noneare female – or for thatmatter, male. It is this last position, exemplified in the Sulabha ̄ story, that manycontemporary women gurus have taken. Ma A ̄nandama ̄yı ̄’s disciples thought shewas beyond gender. Ma Jaya Sati Bhagavati, a guru originally from New York andwho works extensively with AIDS patients, also says “there is no male or female.”7gender in a devotional universe581"},{"pageNumber":588,"pageContent":"The notion that the soul is beyond gender would be consistent in philosophi-cal discourses within the Hindu traditions. The Bhagavad Gı ̄ta ̄, one of theimportant texts of the philosophical traditions, has many detailed discussions onthe soul (translated as “self ” in many editions).It cannot be cut, it cannot be burnt, cannot be made wet, cannot be dried. It iseternal, present everywhere, fixed, free from movement, and perennial. (BhagavadGı ̄ta ̄ 2–24)In these and many other verses in the second chapter, the status of the soul isdiscussed. It is interesting that while in this translation and some others trans-lated by Indians (Radhakrishnan is a major exception) the soul is translated as“it,” most western translators automatically refer to the soul in the masculinepronoun. The point made in the Bhagavad Gı ̄ta ̄ is that the body is transient andthe soul is definitely beyond the reach of material change and modification.Just as there are for the embodied soul childhood, youth and senility in the body,similarly there is also the attainment of another body (after death). (Bhagavad Gı ̄ta ̄2:13)Here, the various changes one associates with the body are projected onto themany bodies the soul takes in the course of its reincarnations. The soul itself isnot affected by these changes. This notion is picked up by many theologians,including Ra ̄ma ̄nuja in the eleventh century. Commenting on the verse quotedabove, he says, “The eternal souls, on account of their being subject to begin-ningless karma, become endowed with bodies suitable to their respectivekarmas” (Sampatkumaran 1969: 26). Passing over the notion of “beginning-less” karma, what is of interest to us here is the concept that the souls simplytake on bodies which are most suitable to them at that point. Gender certainlyseems to figure in this list that is here today, gone tomorrow, in the next life.Ra ̄ma ̄nuja elucidates on the fact that the soul is different from all material influ-ences, like that of the body. Commenting on Bhagavad Gı ̄ta ̄ 2:20 and 25,Ra ̄ma ̄nuja says of the soul:It is (now) pointed out that, as the self is eternal for the reasons mentioned, andhence free from evolutionary changes, all the attributes of the insentient (body)like birth, death, etc., do not exist (for it). . . [B]irth and death which are beingexperienced by all in all bodies do not ever touch the soul.As it is different in kind from all material objects, it cannot be thought of aspossessing the essential quality of any of them. Hence it is immodifiable, absolutelyincapable of modifications. (Ra ̄ma ̄nuja’s comment on Bhagavad Gı ̄ta ̄ 2:20 and 24;Sampatkumaran 1969, 34 and 37)The philosophical traditions preserve the soul’s existence in a place beyond theissues of all physical constructs including gender.

This is not to imply that the real-ization that the soul is beyond gender is in any way “higher” to the other; as inmany spaces in Hinduism, here too we have multiple engagements, multiplevisions of gender and the human being and gender and the soul.The Gender of Vis.n.uMany of the “love poems” we saw explicitly addressed the deity as a male “God.”This is obviously true for many Hindus at many times, but as anyone with evena cursory understanding of Hinduism can tell us, the supreme being isworshiped in many ways and many forms. The gender of the deity varies in thedifferent traditions of Hinduism and in the philosophical texts. Let us simplyconsider the gender of the God Vis.n.u, who is clearly held to be a man. Many of the Vais.n.ava texts tell us quite explicitly that the supreme being is the “highestof men” (purus.ottama). One of the most enduring hymns from the Vedas, recitedregularly still, has been the “Hymn to the Cosmic Man” (Purus.a Su ̄kta). “TheThousand Names of Vis.n.u” (Vis.n.u Sahasrana ̄ma), a popular devotional piece con-sidered generally to be a part of the Maha ̄bha ̄rata and which is recited regularlyin homes and temples, addresses Vis.n.u several times as the “highest of men”; an epithet that is commented upon by theologians. But even in the S ́rı ̄Vais.n.avatradition, Namma ̄l ̄va ̄r, whose feminine voice we just heard, speaks of thesupreme being as one who has bothgenders and as having nogender.Being my father,my friend, and the motherwho gave birth to me . . .(Tiruva ̄ymoli 6.3.9)In several poems, he calls Vis.n.u “mother;” later S ́rı ̄vais.n.ava theologians, com-menting on the “auspicious qualities” of Vis.n.u stress the notion ofvatsalya, thatis, the maternal love that a mother cow has for its calf. Vis.n.u (as well as Ra ̄ma,Kr.s.n.a, et al.) is said to have this quality of maternal love towards his devotees(asrita vatsalya). So, the male deity incorporates in himself the quality thatmother cows are said to have – the undiluted, “essential” maternal love whichseems almost biological in texture.Vis.n.u is not just the “mother,” he is also the archetypal enchantress. One ofhis lesser known incarnations, which does not figure in the traditional list of 10but which is included in the longer, unedited list of 24 that comes in theBha ̄gavata Pura ̄n.a, is as a beautiful woman, Mohinı ̄ (“enchantress,” “the onewho ravishes.”) Although commentators and theologians emphasize the notionthat Vis.n.u is the supreme male, poetry, narrative, and ritual feature the sparklingbeauty of Mohinı ̄. On the day before the Tiruva ̄ymoli recitation and actingbegins in S ́rı ̄ran.gam, and in many south Indian Vis.n.u temples across India andgender in a devotional universe583"},{"pageNumber":590,"pageContent":"the world (Atlanta, Pittsburgh, Chicago, Malibu, etc.), the “festival” icon ofVis.n.u is dressed as Mohinı ̄. This is on the eve of one of the holiest days in theHindu calendar – the day called Vaikun.t.ha Ekadas ́i. This day is the eleventh day(ekadas ́i) after the new moon in the month of Margasirsa.While there are many narratives of Vis.n.u’s incarnation as a woman, the storyof the churning of the ocean of milk is the most popular in performing arts andin sculpture. The grandest bas relief– one of the largest in the world – is on thistheme at Angkor Wat, Cambodia, and the story is performed over and over againin Bha ̄rata Natyam and Kuchipudi. When the Asuras (“demons”) and the Devas(“divine ones”) fight over the nectar of immortality, Vis.n.u appears in the formof a Mohinı ̄, an enchanting woman. The Asuras, enraptured by her appearance,agree to let her mediate and distribute the nectar, and she gives it all (with acouple of minor exceptions) to the Devas. While there are many layers to thisstory, at least on one level it deals with the enchanting, seductive form of Vis.n.uwhich gives the divine beings a shot at immortality. In a sequel to this story, LordS ́iva requests Vis.n.u to take the form of Mohinı ̄. Upon beholding “her,” he fallsin love with her. The deity Ayyappa is considered to be an offspring of S ́iva andMohinı ̄. He is called “Hari Hara Putra” or the “son of Vis.n.u and S ́iva.” His templeis in Sabarimalai, Kerala, and it is one of the most popular places for malepilgrimage in India. About two million devotees gather there for the peak daysin January.The importance of the incarnation as Mohinı ̄ survives today only primarilyin rituals where the male god is dressed as female. Devotees retain the ambigu-ity in their understanding of this ritual. One the one hand, Vis.n.u can take anyform and he is father and mother; on the other hand, he can appear as thecharming seductress if that is how the devotees envisage him. This trope – themale God as the entrancing woman and the devas (or human devotees) cast inthe role of those who are enamored of “her” – has not become popular in laterVa i s.n.avism, as did the image of a male devotee who adopts a female role. It ispossible that it reflects a time when notions of gender were more fluid than thecenturies when such delineations based on sexual difference were prevalent.Men wearing female garb are seen in the Maha ̄bha ̄rata as well as in othertraditions of the Hindu culture. During a year in exile, Arjuna becomes a“female”dance teacher, in the palace at Virata. The male devotees of the GoddessGan.ga ̄mma in Tirupati dress as females, emulating and being possessed by theGoddess during her festivals (Flueckiger, forthcoming).It is possible that the appearance of Vis.n.u as Mohinı ̄ is not emphasized morein the S ́rı ̄vais.n.ava tradition because of the S ́rı ̄/Laks.mı ̄’s increasing importanceafter the ninth century. The Goddess Laks.mı ̄ has a central role in S ́rı ̄vais.n.avatheology and is worshiped at home and in temples. She is portrayed as beinginseparable from Vis.n.u, residing on his chest, and we see this in all icons ofVis.n.u. This inseparability from Vis.n.u is seen in everyday life in the foreheadmarks that S ́rı ̄vais.n.ava men and women wear. The white, U shaped mark is saidto depict Vis.n.u’s feet and the red line in the middle is Laks.mı ̄. The inseparabilityof the couple who are the divine supreme deities is even more dramatically seen584vasudha narayanan"},{"pageNumber":591,"pageContent":"in the figure of the Ardhanarı ̄s ́vara (“the God who is half female”) worshipedby the followers of the god S ́iva. In this image, popular in icons and in calendarart, the right half of the figure is the male god S ́iva and the left half is Parvatı ̄.Vis.n.u is seen to be “the highest man” as incarnate as a woman. He is called“mother,” but in later centuries he is better known as inseparable from theGoddess Laks ́mı ̄. But the same being is also beyond gender; listen to Namma ̄l ̄va ̄r:Neither male nor female, nor is he neuter.He cannot be seen, he’s not one who is,nor one who’s not.When you desire him, he takes the formof your desire,but he’s not that either:it’s very hard indeed to speak about my Lord.(Tiruva ̄ymoli 2.5.10)Although later commentators stress the pronoun “he” in this verse and say itrefers to the “highest of men,” the verse itself pushes the limits of our under-standing of gender and clearly says that the supreme being is neither male norfemale. In saying so, Namma ̄l ̄va ̄r is following that strand of the Upanis.ads whichspeaks of the ineffable nature of the supreme Brahman: “before it is reached,words turn back, along with the mind” (Taittirı ̄ya Upanis.ad, 2.9.1). The souland the supreme being, then, are in the devotional universe; gendered, but inphilosophical discourses, beyond gender.ReflectionsAre the rituals, the dances, the songs, constructed and performed by men andwomen in the Hindu tradition important in our understanding of gender? AnnGold (2000) distinguishes between two approaches in the study of gender con-figurations in south Asia and the closely related subject of women’s roles insouth Asian society. There are scholars, she says, who highlight the endemic andsystemic devaluation and consequent disempowerment of women at every level,from social and economic to cosmological and psychological. These scholars do not take the words of the women or their rituals as empowering them in any way, and conclude that “any moves women do make against their gender-determined fates are fairly futile and ultimately insignificant, given the over-weening structural circumstances by which women’s lives are circumscribed”(Gold 2000: 204). The second group tend to write from situated experiences andportray the different ways in which women live, negotiate, and imagine theirgender identities. This group recognizes and acknowledges women’s numerousdisadvantages but also takes their speech and rituals as “possessing the actualacute potency in particular situations, and further potentiality to alter existinggender in a devotional universe585"},{"pageNumber":592,"pageContent":"power structures” (ibid.: 204–5). The study of gender in this chapter hasaccepted the second model but also recognized that some of these women’s rolesare also available to male devotees under certain circumstances. In thedevotional milieux, the female role of the Tamil “heroine” or Yas ́oda ̄, or acowherd girl, is empowering to the male and female devotees and dancersbecause of its relational proximity to a male god. Narratives, song, and danceenhance this fluidity of gender roles and cannot be seen as just a helplessperformances in a patriarchal universe.In recent scholarship, the relationship between gender and sex is understoodin at least three ways. One way is to see gender and sex as homologous: they arethe same. According to this view the differences between “men” and “women”are natural and essential; one’s gender is an inevitable result of the physiologi-cal differences. A second way is to see the relationship as analogous. Gender con-sciousness is understood to be based on socialization and lived experience; thusgender symbolizes sex. Thus, some feminist thinkers and social scientists per-ceive sex to be “natural while gender is cultural, subject to human variation and construction” (Warne 1999: 142). This model accepts, to some extent, thenotion of a “normative heterosexuality grounded in biological nature, althoughit allows for particular cultural constructions which transgress a strict linkageof sex and gender” (ibid.). The third model sees sex and gender as heterogenous.Sex and gender are both not natural and innate; in fact, gender may constructsex. According to one position – in a range of positions that construct this model– “sexual dimorphism is not absolute; ‘nature’ produces humans with a rangeof combinations of hormones, chromosomes and sexual apparatuses” (ibid.).The choice involving a male/female continuum is a human choice and aconceptual construct. Power is central to the understanding of distinctions;divisions and hierarchy are inherent in the act of “gendering.”It is possible to discern, in the songs and rituals of the Hindu traditions, con-cepts which seem to allow for all of these ways of thinking; though the secondway of interpreting the relationship between sex and gender may be more easilydiscernible. It is when one moves into philosophical and theological essays thatone is urged to go beyond all dichotomies, including gender for the soul and forthe deity. At the human level, however, the devotees happily distinguish betweenvarious gender roles but keep the boundaries permeable and fluid. There aremany kinds of femininities as there are many kinds of women, as we saw earlier.Role-playing as a woman is not simply to feel weak in front of a patriarchal deity,but to enjoy the many nuances of love in the situations framed by the conceit ofTamil poems or Puranic/epic narratives.Notes1There is a considerable body of literature on the hijracommunity of India.
