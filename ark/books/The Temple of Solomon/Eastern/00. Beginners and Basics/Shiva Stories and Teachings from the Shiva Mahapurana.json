When Indra appeared,Shilada asked for the boon of a sonwho would be immortal, but Indra saidit was impossible for him to grantimmortality. The only person who"},{"pageNumber":552,"pageContent":"could grant him such a boon was Shiva,so Shilada started to meditate on Shiva.After many years, when his body wasreduced to a mere skeleton, Shivaappeared and told him that he himselfwould be born as his son.

Hearing thetremendous sounds made by the boarand the hunter, Arjuna opened his eyesand saw the boar rushing into theclearing where he was sitting.Immediately Arjuna strung his bow andshot the beast as it charged toward himwhere he sat before a mud linga ofShiva that he had made for his worship.At the same moment, the kirata also"},{"pageNumber":565,"pageContent":"shot the boar; both arrows found theirmark simultaneously.

He ran forward to prostratehimself at the divine hunter’s feet andbeg pardon for the great offense he haddone in daring to fight with him. Shivanow revealed his true form with Parvatiby his side and the ganas frolickingaround them. Arjuna prostrated againand again and begged Shiva to forgivehim.Shiva laughingly declared, “It was agreat experience to fight with you. I’m"},{"pageNumber":568,"pageContent":"proud of your prowess. You may nowask me for any boon you wish.”Arjuna was so ashamed that he didnot dare to ask for the weapon forwhich he had been doing tapasya. “AllI want is to have devotion to your holyfeet all my life,” he said. Shiva, whocould see into his heart, insisted that hecould ask for anything he wished and itwould be granted to him.

This is because the truedevotee is one who has been able tosubjugate the divine through theintense power of his devotion.

This is the great lesson, thatSundarar did not hesitate to involve theLord in every single incident of his"},{"pageNumber":662,"pageContent":"life, even his love affairs. He lived foronly eighteen years but in that shortspan of time he composed some of themost beautiful songs about Lord Shiva,known as thevarams.

Itwas his duty to offer the Lord sacredashes to anoint his body, and a garlandof honey-laden flowers.

Afterconsorting with them in the pleasuresof love, you may come back to me.”These were the words of the Lord.Another reason why Sundarar had totake a human birth was that he had nottotally exhausted all the bonds of hiskarma. In the theology of the SanatanaDharma, God’s grace does not take theform of absolution of all sins, even forthe greatest devotee. If that were the"},{"pageNumber":664,"pageContent":"case there would be an end to the gameo f life.

He strengthens his will tosurrender totally to the will of God,thereby eradicating his desire for thefruits of karma and severing his link inthe chain of births and deaths. Theother reason for Sundarar’s incarnationwas that the Lord wished him to"},{"pageNumber":665,"pageContent":"compose divine music that would be aninspiration for all those in the world.He was thus born into a noble Brahminfamily.The king of the land saw thebeautiful child and adopted him. At theage of fourteen he wanted to get himmarried, but to the great consternationof all concerned, an old Brahmin withashes on his body and a garland ofrudraksha beads round his neckstormed into the wedding hall anddeclared that the boy was his bondedslave and had no right to marry withouthis permission.

Having thus established hisrights over the boy, the old Brahminentered the temple of Shiva andvanished, at which point Sundararrealized that this was none other thanthe Lord himself. Later the Lordappeared to him in a dream and orderedhim to compose songs about him. Fromthat day on, Sundarar wandered fromtemple to temple singing the praises ofthe Lord. At the temple of Tiruvarur, aheavenly voice told him, “Sundarar, Ihave made you my friend. From nowon you will be a bridegroom for therest of your days on earth.”Parvati’s attendant, Kamalini, with"},{"pageNumber":667,"pageContent":"whom Sundarar had fallen in love, hadbeen born as a beautiful woman namedParavayar.

After Sundararcomposed another divine song, theLord changed the gold to its originalvalue.The other woman Sundarar had lovedin Kailasa, Aninditi, had been born as agreat devotee of Lord Shiva and wascalled Sangiliyar.

Shiva spoke toSangiliyar in a dream and told her tomarry Sundarar. She was willing, butwhen she knew that Sundarar wasalready married she made him promisenot to desert her under anycircumstance.
