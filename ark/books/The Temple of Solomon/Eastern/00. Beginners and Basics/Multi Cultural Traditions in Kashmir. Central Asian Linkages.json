Kaw is Dean, College Development Council and Director, Area StudiesCentre, Centre of Central Asian Studies, University ofKashmir, Srinagar.]AbstractKashmir experienced an unprecedented political turmoil during the last two decades.Besides affecting the South Asian peace, security and development, it created theimpression as if Kashmir was always a violent zone and its people were devoid ofessentials of harmony and mutual coexistence. However, the present article holds to thecontrary. It argues that Kashmir symbolized not only a “paradise on earth”,1 but also acelebrated space of “multiculturalism”. Its people were accordingly imbued withsymbiotic traditions embodying innumerable values and customs. Among them, few wereassociated with the individual and group faith in different spiritual beings or objects forsacred and mundane ends: these are precisely termed as the “religio-cultural traditions”.What exactly were these traditions? Where did they emanate from? How and when didthey find a space in Kashmir? What was the role of the state to this effect? To what extentdid they influence the mindset of the people? These and similar other issues are outlinedfor discussion in this article.Several customs and traditions owe their origin to religion which has been always a dynamicsocial institution in all global communities. It generally represented the peoples’ “belief inseveral living and non-living things for attaining salvation and blessings and expressingextreme devotion there unto them”.2 The given belief is usually formalized through a set ofcommonly shared rituals and ceremonies about which the French sociologist, Emile Durkheim,maintains: “A religion is a unified system of beliefs and practices which unite together all thosewho adhere to them.”3 Talcot Parsons (1907–79), another prominent functionalist, argues thatbeliefs, rituals, practices and other social norms are quite useful for the functioning of a certainsystem4 though conflict theorists like Robert K.Merton holds otherwise: “these may not alwayscontribute to the society. Many of them may turn dysfunctional, at a certain time, due to theirinbuilt weakness to resist to or adopt themselves in a given social system.”5 The conflictsociologists further maintain that racial, occupational, social and religious conflicts alwaysdilute the unified spirit of the societies across the globe.6 The two groups of sociologists evenlylock horns on the nuances of the word culture. The ethno-centrists believe that some culturesare essentially dominant and superior to others7 which, however, the relativist group ofsociologists negates by arguing that a “certain culture can be inherently good or bad in relationto its own system than the systems from outside”.8"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Applying the views of functionalists vis-à-vis Kashmir society and culture, one can assumethat different religio-culturalrituals and practices formed the core of human activity in Kashmirsociety notwithstanding dynastic changes, internecine wars and ethnic conflicts. Such ritualsand practices evolved in the wake of the mutual intelligibility of the peoples of Kashmir andSouth and Central Asia to share their ideas, thought, faith and culture during their onwardmarch to civilization. True subscribing to extraneous influences must not have been initiallywithout “cultural shock” to the ethnocentric people of Kashmir. Gradually, however, theyappreciated them for mutual benefits, social sustainability and human togetherness. Naturally,the given optimism was bound to forge marked cultural affinities between the twogeographical spaces, broaden the peoples’ world view and develop among Kashmiris a sense ofreligious tolerance and progressive thought.Such a mutual understanding antedating prehistoric times,9 actually emanated from constanthuman interaction along the Grand Silk Route10 of which several branches traversed Kashmiracross the Kun Lun, Karakoram, Pamirs and the Hindukush mountains.11 Hoards of monks,pilgrims, priests, Sufis, saints, scholars, traders, merchants, artisans and craftsmen, treadedthese mountain passes for fame, fortune, missionary and philanthropic pursuits.12 Theirrelentless efforts were incidentally reinforced by the factors of Kashmir’s strategic location,geographical proximity, and political integration of Kashmir with the “Greater Central Asia”,Iran, Afghanistan, North India and Xinjiang (China).13 One may recall that Kashmir was anindispensable part of the centralized power structure of the Indo-Bactrian Greeks (190 BC),Sakas (Scythians)& Parthians (90 BC–64 AD),14 Kushanas (1st–2nd century AD) and Hunas (5thcentury AD),15 Karkotas of Kashmir (8th century),16 Mughals and the Afghans (16th–19thcentury).17 Thus, from early times, Kashmir was hooked to its Central Asian neighbourhoodthrough regional, cultural, economic and political integration.18(A) Iranian Influence(i)Pre-historic Period:The process of Kashmir’s multi-vector amalgamation with outerworld commenced with the importation of primitive forms of snake and fire worship from Iran.The former obtained among the anthropoid apes since Paleolithic times: they “worshippedserpents and buried them with a supply of insects in their graves as a provision for their futurelife.”19A universal phenomenon though,20 the serpent cult was brought by the Aryans fromIran to Kashmir across the northern areas in Gilgit, Astor, Dah, Hano, Garkun,21 Kargil andDurchik Ladakh.22 With its induction, the existing set of Kashmiri beliefs in natural forces andtheir allied divines, supplemented. Subsequently, however, the early settlers of Kashmirbecame the staunch serpent worshippers; hence, styled as theNagas after the name of thesnakes. In Kalhana’sRajatarangini, theNagas are described as the civilized humans, male-female, who unlike their rival group, thePisachas, lived around the home of the snakes, springsand lakes.23 Like anthropoid apes, the KashmirNagasburied and revered snakes as semi-divines and thought them containing supernatural powers with which they guarded human“dwellings, treasures and the graves of their progeny”.24 With this belief in mind, the natives(Nagas) offered milk to the snakes (nagas) to invoke their blessings for a variety of ends.25 Notsurprising, therefore, to notice Kashmir abounding with scores of such sacred springs,"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Anantnag, Sheshnag, Nilanag, Padmanag, as were named after various names of snakes.Indeed the impact of serpent cult was so piercing that the natives carved their images insculptures: the roughly dated 11th-12th century Kadroo stone sculpture retrieved from Pulwamain South Kashmir and the 16th century stone structuredbowlies from Jammu, the otherdivision of the Jammu & Kashmir state in India, offer the typical examples in this behalf. Eventhe sparsely distributed religious structures in Kashmir carry the graven images of the serpents.The 16th century Mughal chronicler, Abul Fazl, in his monumental work reports about sevenhundred such places that possessed graven images of snakes and about which “wonderfullegends are told”26 albeit most of them excepting those of the sixteenth century are withoutdesigns and the motifs. In any case, the serpent tradition was and continues to be a commonpractice among Kashmiri Pandits27 as well as the Muslims for the attainment of variegateddesires.28 That it was practiced by the Kashmiri Muslims during the medieval period isforthright vindicated by Mirza Haidar Dughlat, Abul Fazl and Haidar Malik Chadoora.29 Evenits influence on them is amply certified by their belief in considering the killing of a snake nextto asin. In addition, they splashed grains at shrines and graves to express regard unto snakesand other animals, besides earning blessing there against for their ancestors. The KashmiriPandit community also remembers the snakes on the eve ofpuja and other religiousceremonies.30Likewise, the primitive cult of fire worship was central to Iran though it emanated in the 6thcentury BC at Balkh in the neighbourhood of Iran, Central Asia and Afghanistan.31 Founded byone Ahur Mazda, the Zoroastrian32 ideology emphasised on the veneration of several Iraniangods and among them, the fire god was perceived to be powerful enough to purify the humanbody from all evils and allow it attain peace and salvation.33 Much like the serpent cult, ittravelled in the train of Aryan migration to Kashmir around the 8th century BC.,34 and in duecourse of time, it got embedded into the innate religio-cultural texture of Kashmir throughseveral practices about Shali maintains: “In the performance of Shradha rites, the Vedic deitiesreceive worship through the fire, Shaivite through the phallic emblem of cooked rice andShakta through a lamp”.35 Accordingly, the Kashmiri Pandits subscribed to fire worship indiverse forms. They circumambulated a firetoformalizeyajna, hawanand other religio-maritalrituals perhaps under theParsi or Zoroastrian influence.36 Under the same influence, theKashmiri Muslims celebratedFrove, an extant local festival of lights and bonfires37 after thename of a revered Kashmiri saint, Zain Rishi, at Ash Muqam in South Kashmir. On a certainday, the devotees burn a chip of pinewood, tie it to a strong willow stick, and carry it up to ahill housing the cave of the saint and chanted slogans: ‘This is the fire of Zain Rishi” meant tokill the demon and register victory of good over wicked forces.38 The local ceremony ofVayukis again near to theIranian style ofFarvardin.39On a specific day of a month, the KashmiriMuslims remember their dead, visit their graves and distribute loaves of rice, theRohan Posh,among the needy.40(B) Central Asian Influences(ii) Ancient Period: In addition to Iran, Kashmir borrowed multiple influences from the Tajikland as is vividly vindicated by the commonTajik-Kashmirheritage. The Paleolithic and"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Neolithic sites of Sarazam, Penjikent and Kuldara in Tajikistan and Burzahoma and Gufkral inKashmir dating around the same period, 5000-3000 BC, reveal the coexistence of an irrevocableTajik-Kashmir bond in terms of the common human habitat along the river beds and forestslopes, settlement pattern and the material finds comprising charcoal, hearths, grains, chisels,bone and stone made celts, grinders, querns, needles, awls, arrow heads, spears, beads, combs,bodkins, harvesters, scrapers, choppers, cores, flakes, pits and pit chambers.41 The mode andform of ancestral, animal, sun, river, tree and the worship of like natural forces,42 also suggest ashared history of mutual influences and cultural affinities between Tajikistan and Kashmir.43However, these mutual ties strengthened with the advent of Buddhism, an ethico-moralphilosophy founded by Lord Buddha in Bodhgaya Bihar, India, in the 5th century BC. The saidphilosophy demanded the humans to undergo self-introspection, shun malice and other evildesigns and subscribe to right thinking, right approach, right action etc. so as to become perfectand immaculate , theSakya Mani.Given its popularity especially after the death of its founder,Buddhism transformed into a formal faith, which reached Kashmir during the reign ofMauryan King Ashoka in the 3rd century BC. He popularized it through various measureswhich included engaging Kashmiri monks in the religious congregations at Pataliputra44 andconstructing largenumber of religious structures, thestupas andchaity as, in the Valley withsymbolic representation of Buddha’s footprints, tree andchakra.45 On the fall of the Mauryas,the Indo-Bactrian Greeks (190 BC.) under their famous kings, Demetrius and Menandra(Milinda), pronounced Buddhism by building numerousviharas andstupasin Kashmir. It iseither from Kashmir46 or their Gandhara capital in Taxila that they transported Buddha’ssymbols and images to China and Central Asia.47 Personally King Menandraheld discussionswith an eminent Buddhist monk, Nagasena, and builtMilindavihara after his own name inKashmir implicitly to allow free intellectual debate on faith and its existential realities anddevelop a sense of inclusiveness among the Kashmiris.48 Besides, the Indo-Greeks promotedKashmir’s trade with Central Asia 49 and introduced Gandharan art in Kashmir50 which iscandidly evidenced by material finds from Semthan (modern Bijbehara) in South Kashmir.The Indo-Greeks were succeeded by the Sakas (Scythians), Parthians and the Kushanas (Yue-Chiehs) [ Ist. century BC- 3rd century AD]. All the three dynasties especially the Kushanas undertheir veteran kings, Kanishka, Hushka and Jushka (1St- 5thcentury AD) legitimised Buddhism bydeclaring it the state faith. They designed Buddha’s images and symbols in sculptures,constructed and granted rent free land grants toviharas,stupasand their keepersandpermitted complete freedom of religion. King Kanishka personally held religious dialogue withmany people51 including the then Buddhist scholar and saint, Nagarjuna at Sadarhadvana(modern Harvan) in proper Srinagar.52 Importantly, he organized the fourth (some say thethird) Buddhist conference in Kashmir which was undeniably a landmark in the history ofKashmir for it assembled hoards of Buddhist monks from South, Central and South East Asiaon the one platform for exploring the hidden secrets and existential realities of Buddhism.53 Itsfindings were inscribed on the copper plates. While few of them were spotted from the NorthKashmir, many others are known to one Kashmiri scholar Yusuf Teng. Hiuen Tsang does notidentify the exact venue of the conference though,54 yet the event established Kashmir as one of"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"the peaceful and suitable place for dialogue on the religio-cultural matters.55 That way, Kashmirwas strategically logged on to the greater Buddhist world.56No doubt, the Buddhist kings extended every possible support to Buddhism in Kashmir.They juxtapose accorded adequate, if not equal, patronage to other ideologies to uphold theinnate Kashmiri tradition of human coexistence, mutual forbearance and religious toleration57Perhaps with the same consideration, Mauryan King Ashoka revered Vedic58 andShaivitedeities and semi-deities,59 built twoShaivite temples at Bijbehara, [named Ashokeshvara], andreplaced the stucco building material [specific to Buddhist Viharas] by stone [specific toShaivite Temples].60 His purported son, Jaluka,61 a staunch follower of Hinduism though, isalso reported to have shown liberality unto Buddhism by constructing a Buddhistvihara atKitsahom (modern Baramulla) in North Kashmir.62Besides religious structures, the numismatic evidence also certifies tothe Kashmir’s traditionof religio-cultural pluralism under extraneous influences. That Kushanas considerablypatronized Buddhism but regard unto other religions especially Shaivism, is not far to seek intheir coins and material remains. Kanishka’s coinsdepict Buddha’s images63 as well as a four-armed standing Shiva with a drum, gourd, goat and a trident in his hands, indeed a livingexample of Kashmir’s rich heritage of “inclusiveness”. His successors too demonstratedoptimum liberality towards the non-Buddhist orShaivite faith as is borne by different types ofcoins: Hushka’s coins, for instance, bear the impressions of Vedic or Hindu gods (the sun with ahalo of rays)64; Vasudeva’s coins carry the image of the Greek legends65 and the coins of theKidara depict the impressions of a Hindu goddess.66 In addition to Buddhist, Brahmanical orShaivite influences, their coins exhibit the images of Greek and Zoroastrian deities: the latterwas characteristic of the Scythian and Parthians before them.67 The Semthan finds and the 7thcentury Chinese account of Hiuen Tsang,68authenticate the confluence of Buddhist, Hindu,Vedic, Greek and the like influences during the Buddhist rule.69 This presupposes that theBuddhist kings preferred “inclusion” and “tolerance” to “exclusion” and “intolerance”notwithstanding degeneration in the rank and file of the monks due to excessive absorption inwine, fish, meat, gambling, andTantricpractices of sorcery, magic and sexual or physical unionwith the Shakti70: the Hindu priests too were later absorbed by theTantric forms of faith.71During the course of religious transition, Kashmir formally experienced the introduction ofShaivism or Hinduism. It started with Jaluka, the son of Ashoka, and went down to thenomadic tribes of Hepthalites or White Hunas (410–569 AD)72 from North China. In reality, therule of Hunas was a breakthrough for it elevated Hinduism to the pinnacle of the state faith.Being ardent devotees of Shiva, Toraman in general and Mihirkula in particular constructedShaivite temples in every nook and corner of the Valley,73 and settled a huge number ofGandharan Brahmans in Kashmir. The local ruling dynasties, the Karkotas (600–855),74Utapalas (AD 855–939)75and the Loharas (1003–1101)76 also nurtured theShaivite andVaishnaviateideologies by building and carving out Brahmanical images of Indrani, Vishnuand Shiva on the religious structures and providing rent free land grants to temples and theBrahmans for their maintenance.77 Only the Hindu King Harsha was an exception to thisgeneral pro-Brahmanical policy. He ruthlessly destroyed temples and siphoned off their"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"centuries old wealth partly under economic compulsions and partly under the influence ofAbhinavgupta’s Trika Saivism (11th century) which signified a strong social reaction againstthe Brahmanical rituals.78Simultaneously, however, the Hindu kings demonstrated toleration unto Buddhism bybuilding monasteries,79 granting rent free land grants to them and the monks for maintenance,80allowing representation of Buddha’s images in sculptures at Pravarsenpura and Ushkur andcelebrating Buddha’s anniversary along with the anniversary of the Brahmanical gods.81 TheSemthan finds, Harwan tiles and rubble structures,82 and the 8th century Martand andAvantiswamin stone temples certify the union of Tokharian (Buddhist) andShaivite influenceson Kashmir culture and architecture. To this effect, the Karkota rule is rightly remembered as agolden period in Kashmir history for it saw the convergence of Buddhism, Vaishnavism andShaivism into one religio-cultural basket.83 All the three religious ideologies assimilated,excreted and shared mutual influences with each other. Whereas Hinduism exportedpolytheistic and Tantric84 beliefs to Buddhism, it instead borrowed scriptural form of art fromBuddhism. Such a triangular confluence sufficed to the co-existence of diverse faiths, ideologiesand arts in Kashmir85 under her age-long experience in multiculturalism.(iii) Medieval Period: The ancient legacy of religious toleration and cultural pluralism wasalso upheld by the early Muslim rulers in medieval Kashmir. No doubt Islam incorporates amonotheistic ideology based on the belief in “No god but God, the Supreme Creator of theUniverse” and denunciation of all sorts of polytheistic forms of stone, idol, image and shrineworship.86 However, it could retain its egalitarian character only in Arabia whereas in Iran andCentral Asia, it was constrained to make a kind of compromise with pagan, nomadic and tribaltraditions. Consequently, Central Asian Islam combined together the essentials of actual faithand the age-old un-Islamic customs and traditions. However, for the given support from boththe nomadic and sedentary peoples, 87 it developed into the “folk Islam”88 with strong socialappeal, which even the Wahabi Movement of Sayyid Sharie Muhammad of Madina could nottear apart in 1912 AD.Since Islam did not arrive directly from Arabia to Kashmir, it naturally carried with it mixedIranian and Central Asian influences, which were gradually absorbed in the innate Kashmiritraditions . Initially, therefore, the neo-converts to Islam continued visiting temples, performingHindu ritualyajna, dressing in Hindu attire and invoking stones, idols, images and deities forblessings. They did not perform the Islamic practice of circumcision and instead perpetratedacts of un-Islamic innovations. Even for expediency, their Islamic preachers did not object tothese fundamental violations lest they enter into conflict with the neo-converts; hence, rendertheir whole mission abortive. More so, they delivered religious sermons not in Arabic but inlocallanguage/s and used local Hindu religious idioms ofAvtar, Deva, Nirguna, Pran, P’aap,Punya, Surag, Ahankar andKrodh in their speeches. Likewise, they made theRishicult89identifiable with Hinduism by subscribing to celibacy, vegetarianism, non-violence and non-injury to animals and abstaining from the use of garlic and onion etc.in food.90 The mostpopular missionary saint, Sayyid Ali, from Hamadan in Iran, permitted groupdhikr orcollective chanting of religious literature in chorus to undercut the loud recitation ofmantras in"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Hindu temples.91 Neitherpardah nor Islamic education was made mandatory for Muslimwomen.92 Law of succession93 and the adoption of a son were not objected to despite being un-Islamic in character: this practice is still in vogue in Kashmir.94 Under the circumstances, theage-long traditions featuring a mixed brand of pagan, Zoroastrian, Buddhist and Hindupractices continued to have a space in the existing religio-cultural basket of Kashmir.Over the years, however, the Kashmiri Muslims learnt to differentiate between monotheismand polytheism and, as such, stopped visiting Hindu temples. They denounced the Hindudeities and Brahmanical forms as these ran across the belief in infallible, inalienable andindivisible reality of God. In fact, the rejection of the Brahmanical ritualistic forms was not anew phenomenon but rather a continuation of the reaction articulated by an eminent scholar,Abhinavgupta, and the most able King Harsha, in the early and late 11th century.It was laterupheld by Lalla, aSaiva Yogini, and Sheikh Noor-ud Din Rishi or Nund Rishi, a reveredKashmiri saint, in the 14th century. Lalla was fearless enough to recognize the ‘oneness of God’,95 and condemn (like her IndianBhakts) stone worship inall its forms and manifestations:“He is here, there and everywhere. The idol is but a stone. The temple is but a stone. Fromtop to bottom all is stone.”96In the same century, Sayyid Ali Hamadani adopted Lalla and Nund Rishi’s philosophy as thelocal base for advocating Islamic monotheism. The scores of his accompanying Central Asianmissionaries, artisans, craftsmen, scholars and scientists, toured villages and towns andsensitized the Kashmiris to the essentials of Islam. Many of them permanently settled andformed their Diaspora in Kashmir, and were thus termed as theKashanis,Badakhshanis,Bukharis,Geelanis,Andrabis,Sayyids, etc.97 However, despite their mass awareness98 aboutwhat is often termed as the “high Islam or puritan Islam”, the Kashmiri Muslims took recourseto the “folk Islam” embodying, besides all else, the innate customs and traditions. No doubt,their mindset changed from temple to mosque but their association with the pre-Islamic valuesand customs continued there with them.It was rather re-energised by the Sufistic philosophyand the cult of shrine and saint worship for being above ethno-national and religio-sectarianconsiderations as was the case elsewhere in Iran, central Asia and Afghanistan. The devoteesdedicated shrines, tombs and the mausoleums to the eminent Sufis,imams,sayyidsandascribed great miracles to their supernatural powers to animate the dead and inspire peoplewith a “feeling of reverential awe and mysterious influence”. Consequently, whole Valley andits Central Asian borderlands were replete with such shrines99 which the devotees invariablythronged, tied tags and lit candles on100 to invoke blessings for curing ailments, bearingchildren, auguring bumper harvests, to name only a few ends. They comprised all social andgender groups, men, women, and children especially among the peasantry who, more oftenthan not, donated cattle, slaughtered animals etc. at the shrines.101Undeniably, their attitude was reflective of a cardinal contradiction in their belief andpractice. While, they practicedkalima,nima’z,hajj,zakat,rouza, circumcision, marriage andother Islamic rituals and rites, they simultaneously visited and esteemed tombs and shrines intotal disregard of theQur’anic injection: “And they set up (idols) as equal toAllah, to mislead"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"(men) from His path. Into hell, they will burn; therein, an evil place to stay in...There is no godbut God, the Eternal and Absolute. Those who believe not are arrogant. You should worshipnone butAllah.”102The given dichotomy was probably the outcome of the constantly pouringin religio-cultural influences from across the borders in Iran, Afghanistan, Central Asia, Chinaand India.Nonetheless, such extraneous influences germinated fair deal of cultural affinity betweenKashmir and its South and Central Asian neighbourhood.. One glaring example is manifest inthe practice of preserving and displaying the relics of the revered Prophet Muhammad(PBUH) atseveral shrines in contemporary Kashmir. The said practice was implicitly the continuation of asimilar practice of around 1st century AD in ancient Eastern Turkistan or Chinese Central Asiaor what currently forms Chinese largest province called the Xinjiang Uighur AutonomousRepublic, where people preserved and demonstrated the relics of the Buddha, the beggingbowl and the tooth, as a token of reverence unto and seeking blessings from the said great soul[ lord Buddha].103 AnotherKashmiri practice termedNafl was the replica of a 13th centurypractice in Eastern Turkistan. To ward off famine or other natural calamities, processions weretake out while holding up in hands the long wooden poles tied with scraps of cloth. After goingthrough different streets in Srinagar, the processionists terminated atEidgah for prayers andconfession of bygone sins.104 No major difference obtained in these two practices except that theEastern Turkistanis held out a small meteorite believing thatsince it had fallen from the sky asa ‘stone of heaven’, it would, as such, redeem them from the drought severities.105 Similarly, theRishi cult of medieval Kashmir had its counterparts in Eastern Turkistan. According to themedieval accounts, the Rishis resemble the Buddhist, Hindu, Vaishnav and Muslim saints andSufis for they (i) lead an austere life, (ii) abstain from worldly allurements, (iii) disregardpolytheism, Brahmanism and ritualism, (iv) avoid taking meat, (v) plant trees, (vi) speakpeople’s language, (vii) and tread long distances to preach monotheism, peace and non-violence.106 They were held with great respect by the Kashmiris, who paid obeisance at theirshrines and abstained from meat or fish on the eve of their anniversaries to show theirassociation with them.107 The Kashmiri Rishis were , as such, identifiable with the specificgroups of ascetics in the Eastern Turkistan about whom Marco Polo avers: “there is a particularclass of devotees, who live in communities, observe strict abstinence in regard to eating,drinking and refrain from any kind of sexual indulgence, in order that they may not giveoffence to the idols whom they worship”108 Similar types of affinities were marked in thearchitectural specimens of Kashmir and Turkistan as a whole. The pagoda type of Chinesebuilding structure together with the mixed use of stone, wood, stuccoes, dab and wattle andearthen roofing in different ancient and medieval structures of Kashmir, attest to the incominginfluences from China, Central Asia, Afghanistan, Iran and India; hence, reflective of“continuity within change”. In fact, few extant Muslim shrines or mosques in Kashmir wereraised on the already existing temple or monastery structures to maintain ,inter alia, links withthe Buddhist and Hindu past. Little wonder to notice some Buddhistchaityastransformed intoHindu temples first and subsequently into Muslim mosques, graves or shrines. One suchexample is offered by theShah-i Hamdan shrine in proper Srinagar. Itwas esteemed by theKashmiri Pandits for its premises housed the Kali temple during the medieval Kashmir."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Thus the centuries-old legacy of multiculturalism was legitimized with the arrival of Islamand mystic ideology of Sufism to Kashmir in the 14th century. Itbrought with it not only arevolutionary social movement but also scores of customs and values related to individual andgroup behaviour vis-à-vis birth, death, marriage, faith and other social norms. These were,willy nilly, adopted and embedded by the natives in their innate cultural fabric. In any way, thenet result of exotic influences culminated in marked compatibilities in the nature, compositionand performance of a variegated set of customs and traditions over a vast geographical spacespanning Kashmir, Iran, Central Asia, Afghanistan, India and China. The Common practicesand rituals allied, for instance, to the naming of a new-born baby, the wedding of a couple andthe performance of rituals and rites of the deceased by a Buddhist monk, Hindu Brahman or aMuslimMoulvi orImam , prove the point.109In short, the Kashmir’s tradition of religio-cultural pluralism symbolised a conglomerate ofcustoms and values which were an indispensable part of “cultural universals” than anyparticular group, region, faith, and people or country. They came into being in sequence ofconstant human interaction on the basis of the reciprocity of give and take relationship. Theseincluded the rites and rituals meant,per se, to appease the living and non-living beings andobjects for variety of ends. Consequently, these customs and traditions had a great socialappeal and were least infringed by racial, occupational, social or religious conflicts, negatingthereby the above argued views of the conflict theorists on the negative role of religion onculture and society. Instead they marginalised the scope of reactionaryand revolutionarymovements in both quantitative and qualitative terms. Obviously, the ideological void betweenBuddhism, Hinduism and Islam and evenbetween “puritan Islam” and “folk Islam” did notstretch that much during the ancient and medieval periods.The reasons were more than obvious. These customs and traditions promoted close-knitrelations between individuals and groups, guaranteed them social security against men-madeand God-made forces, inculcated in them a sense of peace, harmony and social togetherness,capacitated them to distinguish between sacred and profane values, sensitised them to socialchanges and challenges, made them immune to complexities of life and consoled them in theevent of stress and strain110 as is rightly argued by Tolman while maintaining that the customsand traditions offered a mental therapy to those isolated individuals who, for their ownfrustration, were unable to respond to existential and stark realities of life.111 More so, theycrystallised family and community bonds and their ethico-moral foundation, facilitated humanmixing and exchange of rural-urban commodities on festive occasions.112 As a matter of fact,their benefits were too wide to be compressed in simple terms.Perhaps no other explanation is apt than the one underscored by Smith in general. To quotehim: “by the ritual performance and rehearsal of ceremonies and feasts and sacrifices, by thecommunal recitation of past deeds and ancient heroe’s exploits, men and women have beenenabled to bury their sense of loneliness and insecurity in the face of natural disasters andhuman violence by feeling themselves to partake of a collectivity and its historic fate whichtranscends their individual existences.”113Endnotes"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"1 Father Xavier, “Letters from Kashmir, Sept., 1597”, H.
