Hopefully this new edition by Motilal Banarsidass will largely solve this problem. The new edition also gives me the opportunity to present two new appendices that summarize the discoveries relevant to these sects and the analyses of them that other scholars have made since the book’s original publication in 1972. Except for a few minor corrections, the original text of the book remains intact. The new material described and discussed in the two new appendices has not been integrated into the bibliography and index, but extensive cross-references are included in the notes to the appendices as well as complete biographical citations.

Lorcnzcn"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"PREFACEThis study attempts to give as complete as possible a description of two extinct ^aivite sects—the Kàpàlikas and the Kàlàmukhas. In a Christian context the concept of a ‘sect’ embodies three essential features : a specific doctrine (including a prescribed mode of worship), a priesthood, and a well-defined and exclusive laity. The structure of Hindu ‘sects’ is in general much more amorphous than that of Christian ones. In most cases more emphasis is placed on doctrine and mode of worship than on organisation. The Sanskrit words most often used for the Kàpàlika, Kàlàmukha and Pàsupata ‘sects’—the groups discussed in this study—are darsana, samaya and mata. The basic meaning of these words is ‘doctrine.’ Each of the three groups also had its own priesthood. That of the Kàlàmukhas appears to have been the best organised. Several Kàlàmukha monasteries (mathas), each under a single head (matha-pati), controlled temples in the regions surrounding them. It is doubtful, however, whether any of the three groups had its own exclusive laity. An ordinary farmer or merchant might have called himself a Buddhist, Jain, Vaisnava, or Saivite, but probably not a Kàpàlika, Kàlàmukha or Pàsupata. Records indicate that persons supported priesthoods of different and even hostile ‘sects’ without feeling disloyal. For this reason it might be more appropriate to speak of Kàlàmukha, Pàsupata and Kàpàlika ‘monastic orders’ rather than ‘sects.’ Since, however, the term ‘monastic order’ does not usually imply a separate doctrinal or philosophical position, we will remain content with the word ‘sect.’Unfortunately no religious texts of either the Kàpàlikas or the Kàlàmukhas have survived. Their portraits must be drawn from accounts by their opponents and, in the case of the Kàlàmukhas, from the information contained in epigraphic grants to their temples. The comments on both sects by Yâmunàcàrya and his famous pupil Ràmânuja make the best starting point.Many of the remarks by these two Vaisnava sages about the Kàpàlikas are confirmed and enlarged by the numerous descriptions of Kàpàlika ascetics in Sanskrit literature. Of particular importance are two dramas—Bhavabhüti’s Mâlatï-Màdhava and Krçnamisra’s Prabodhacandrodaya—and two legendary accounts of the life of Saipkaràcàrya—Màdhavàcârya’s Éamkara-digvijaya and Ànanda-xi"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"xiiI'Rl >A( T.giri’s Samkara-vijaya. Although nearly all of the sources for the Kapalikas are fictional and written from a hostile point of view, the overall picture they give is detailed enough and consistent enough to ensure that it is reasonably authentic. The discovery of two or three inscriptions from what must have been Kapalika temples at least guarantees their existence.Apart from the remarks of Yamunacarya and Ramanuja, the sources for the Kalamukhas are nearly all epigraphic ones. The majority of the grants to Kalamukha temples have been found in what is today Mysore State and date from the eleventh and twelfth centuries a.d. Most are written in Kannada, the language of the region. In general they provide more information about the history than the doctrine and cult of the sect. The religious information that they do contain tends to discredit rather than corroborate Yamunacarya and Ramanuja. Most importantly, the records indicate that the Kalamukhas were an offshoot of the Pasupatas, a sect about which a good deal is known from surviving religious texts as well as from inscriptions.Few modern scholars have paid much attention to either the Kapalikas or Kalamukhas. One of the earliest reputable discussions of the two sects is in R.G. Bhandarkar's Vaisnavism, Saivism and Minor Religious Systems (1913). Bhandarkar limits himself to a brief summary of the accounts of Ramanuja, Madhavacarya, Anandagiri, and Bhavabhuti. Although he admits that 'there appears to be a confusion between the sects of Kapalikas and Kalamukhas’ in Ramanuja’s account, Bhandarkar seems to accept that the Kalamukhas were ‘the most extreme sect.’ This view, which has been accepted by many subsequent writers, is, I feel, an incorrect one. For a truer picture of the Kalamukhas one must look to their inscriptions. No comprehensive study of Kalamukha epigraphy has so far been attempted, but worthwhile discussions of the Kalamukha Sakti-parisad at Belagave are found in J.F. Fleet’s ‘Inscriptions at Ablur’ and in A.V. Subbiah’s ‘A Twelfth Century University in Mysore.’ A great number of Kalamukha inscriptions are edited and translated by B.L. Rice in Epigraphia Carnatica. Other inscriptions have been edited, and often translated, by various scholars in Epigraphia Indica, South Indian Inscriptions, Indian Antiquary, and other journals. For the Kapalikas only one modern scholar merits special mention—K.K*. Handiqui.

I have included a fairly comprehensive list of the many modern studies of the Pàsupatas at the beginning of chapter six.In the present study I have attempted to gather together for the first time all the available source materials on the Kàpâlikas and Kàlàmukhas and to extract a coherent account of their history, doctrines and religious practices.With the Kàpâlikas I have first presented these source materials in as readable a form as possible and saved most of my analysis of them for a separate chapter. This arrangement has necessitated a good number of repetitions of important references for which I ask the reader’s indulgence. The reconstruction of Kâpâlika cult and doctrine is admittedly speculative owing to the distorted and fragmentary character of the evidence. For this reason I have had to repeatedly qualify my remarks with words and phrases such as ‘probably,’ ‘possibly,’ ‘perhaps,’ ‘seems to,’ ‘tends to suggest,’ etc. Of greatest importance is the identification and des­cription of the peculiar vow of the Kàpâlikas called the Mahâvrata. It is this vow, I believe, that provides the key to a proper under­standing of many of their unorthodox ascetic practices.The subject of tantric religion is potentially a rather controversial one, and some of my comments might raise the hackles of those concerned for the image of Indian religion. The axes I have to grind do not include the wilful denigration of things Indian, and I have tried at all times simply to draw the most reasonable conclusion the evidence afforded.The presentation in a readable form of the profuse epigraphic evidence on the Kàlàmukhas was a more difficult task. My main object has been to demonstrate the great importance of this sect in tenth to thirteenth century Mysore and to rescue it from the tantric limbo to which it was relegated by Ràmànuja, R.G. Bhandarkar and others.The last chapter discusses the Pàsupata ancestry of the Kàlàmukhas, particularly the date and life of the Pàsupata- Kàlàmukha saint Lakulisa. Many of my remarks are in the nature of criticisms and cautionary notes about the conclusions of modern scholars. Included, with some trepidation, is a criticism of Professor Ingalls’ theory of the shamanistic origin of this sect.Several technical details must be mentioned. The critical apparatus I have used is based for the most part on K.L. Turabian’s A Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses and Dissertations.

The words ‘Saivite’ and ‘§aiva’ are distinguished ..The former is applied to anyone who specially worships the god Siva, the latter to a Saivite who follows §aiva-Siddhanta. The spelling of Indian place names is always a problem. In general I have used the versions given in the Government of India’s Road Map of India (2d edition). For the names of small villages and other places not on this map, I have normally used the spellings given in my sources.Sanskrit words are transliterated according to the system now used by most Indologists. Nasal-consonant combinations are transliterated as in Monier-Williams’ Sanskrit-English Dictionary. Thus I have written ‘âamkara’ not ‘Sankara.’ In order to avoid confusion—especially between ‘c’ and ‘ch’—I have also made uniform the spelling of Sanskrit words in quotes and translations of other scholars, though not in the titles of their books and articles. Translations from Sanskrit are my own unless otherwise specified. Since my knowledge of Kannada is more limited, I have normally relied on the translations of Rice, Fleet, Barnett, and others for the Kàlàmukha epigraphy in this language. I have also had the help of Dr. H. Ullrich of Michigan State University and Professor H.S. Biligiri of Deccan College, Poona. I am particularly grateful for Professor Biligiri’s excellent translation of the important record describing the exploits of Bonteyamuni of Horpbal.Several other persons have contributed suggestions, criticisms and linguistic assistance.

Vácaspati Miára (c. 850) divides these Máhesvaras into four groups—áaivas, Pásupatas, Kapalikas, and Kárunika-siddhántins.2 Bháskarácárya (c. 850) repeats this division but replaces the Kárunika-siddhántins with Ká(haka-siddhántins.3 Other commentators are said to call this last group Káruka-siddhántins.4 Yámunácárya (c. 1050), the teacher of Rámánuja, lists together áaivas, Pásupatas, Kápálas, and Kálámukhas in his Ágama-prámánya.5 Rámánuja (c. 1017— 1137) repeats his preceptor’s comments, in large part verbatim, in his Sri-bhásya,6 Most later commentators also seem to follow Yámuna’s classification. Although the Káruka-, Kárunika-, Káthaka-siddhántins are only described very cursorily, they are apparently identical with the Kálámukhas.The comments of Yámunácárya and Rámánuja contain valuable information, but have been accepted too uncritically by modern scholars. In some places Rámánuja’s ÉrT-bhásya is ambiguous and his remarks about the Kálámukhas tío not always harmonise with what is otherwise known about them.7 Also, he does not maintain consistently clear distinctions between the four sects. Spmetimes he seems to describe them collectively, at other times1 Brahma-sütra-bhá$ya, ed. B. Sastri, ii. 2. 37.2BhámatT, ed. B. Sastri, ii. 2. 37.3Bra/tma-sütra-bhásya, ed. V.P.

He first identifies the four sects which follow the doctrine of PaSupati and then adds :All these make an analysis of reality and a hypothesis about the attainment of bliss in this world and the next which are opposed to the Vedas. They make a distinction between the instrumental and material cause (nimittopadanayor bhedam) and designate Pasupati as the instrumental cause (but not the material cause of the Universe).8In this respect the four sects appear to be the same. This is, no doubt, an oversimplification, but each may well have propounded a dualistic metaphysics.Ramanuja next discusses the main features of Kapala (Kapalika) worship :As the Kapalas declare: 4He who knows the essence of the six insignia (mudrika-satka), who is proficient in the highest mudra, and who meditates on the Self as seated in the vulva (bhagasana-stha), attains nirvanaThey define the six insignia (mudra) as the kanthika (necklace),9 the rucaka (another neck ornament), the kundala (earring), the sikha- mani (crest-jewel), ashes, and the sacred thread. A person bearing these insignia is not born again in this world.10Yamunacarya makes the important addition that they have two secondary insignia (upamudrd)— the skull (kapala) and the club (khatvahga) .n Most Saivite ascetics smear their bodies with ashes and wear sacred threads, but the skull and khafvanga are mostly peculiar to the Kapalikas. The term kundala is used for the earrings of the Kapalikas in a number of sources, and in Bhavabhuti’s Mdlati-Madhava a female Kapalika bears the name Kapala- kunciala.12 Large earrings made of rhinoceros horn or other materia! are a distinguishing feature of a related group of tantric ascetics, the Kanphafa Yogins (kan = ear, pha(a = split). Their earrings are of two basic types—a flat one called darsana and a round one called kundala. Both are known as mudras. 13 Statues of Lakulisa, the*ii. 2. 35-37.9Yamunacarya reads karnika in place of kanfhika.

The other insignia in Ramanuja’s list, the neck ornaments and crest-jewel, are nowhere else specially connected with the Kapalikas.The phrase ‘proficient in the highest mudrd' or ‘most skilful in (the use of) mudras' (para-mudra-visarada) is difficult to interpret. R.G. Bhandarkar explains it as he ‘who is skilful in their [the six insignia’s] use,’14 but it is not easy to see how these insignia can be ‘used’. In tantric literature the term mudrd is one of the five Ma-sounds which designate the principal ingredients of the central tantric ritual (pahca-makara-sadhand) : madya (liquor), mdmsa (meat), matsya (fish), mudrd, and maithuna (coition). Here mudrd has a variety of meanings. In Hindu tantras it usually denotes parched grain, kidney beans, or any cereal believed to possess aphrodisiac qualities.15 In Buddhist tantric works, on the other hand, it usually refers to the female partner in the ritual. In Buddhist tantric yoga, the four stages in the pro­duction of bodhi-citta are also called mudras. They are karma- mudrd, dharma-mudra, maha-mudra, and samaya-mudra.16 In non-tantric religious usage, and often in tantric works as well, mudrd denotes various ritual gestures, especially ones made with the hands. More generally it simply means ‘mark’ or ‘insignia’ as in the ‘set of six insignia’ ( mudra-satka ) mentioned above. Bhandarkar’s interpretation of Ramanuja’s phrase is still the best one, but most of the other meanings of mudrd are also possible.The meditation on the ‘Self as seated in the vulva’17 is reminiscent of the Buddhist tantric maxim: ‘Buddha-hood resides in the woman’s vulva.’18 The term bhaga (vulva) also has a variety of meanings, especially in the Buddhist Tantras. Many of these texts begin with the words : ‘Once upon a time the Lord of all Tathagatas ... was dwelling in the vulvae of the vq/>tf-women.’19 This is an example of .what Bharati calls afferent sandhd-tevKimoXogy—the use of object words, frequently erotic ones, to ‘intend’ metaphysical or mystical concepts.20 Here the commentators explain bhaga as“ p. 127.15A.

Another Buddhist connection is found in the vernacular songs (caryas) of the Sahajiya Buddhist saint Kanhapada. He elevates the Kapalika to the rank of perfected yogin 22 Vajrayana literature also refers to ritual paraphernalia typical of Kapalika worship—such as bones, blood, flesh, and skulls—more often than Hindu Tantras do.Nonetheless, all Sanskrit sources claim that the Kapalikas worship the Hindu deity Bhairava-Siva and his consort. There is little doubt, therefore, that the Kapalikas were a 6aivite sect. The Buddhist parallels indicate that they must have also had some connection with Buddhist tantrism, but, in the absence of additional evidence, it is useless to speculate about what this may have been. Yamunacarya and Ramanuja continue their discussion with some comments about the last of the four sects, the Kalamukhas. Both authors should have been acquainted with these ascetics since the sect was influential in South India, particularly in the Mysore region, between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries. Yamunacarya is believed to have spent most of his life in Kanci. His disciple divided most of his time between this city and Srirangam, about 150 miles to the south. He also made pilgrimages to other parts of India. Contemporary Kalamukha monasteries in the Madras region existed at Tiruvanakkoyil in Chingleput District, Vedal in North Arcot District, Koyil Tevarayanpettai in Tanjore District, and Kotfuipbajur in Tiruchchirappali District—none very far from Kanci or Srirangam.23Ramanuja’s portrait of the sect, however, is quite different from the one obtained ffom Kalamukha epigraphs or from the works of their parent sect, the Pasupatas. Sri-bhasya ii. 2. 35-37 states :Likewise, the Kalamukhas designate (the following) as the means of securing all desires in this world and the next: eating from a skullbowl, besmearing the body (snana) with21Dasgupta, pp. 1Q5, 120-21.22S.B.

Only two items are associated with the Kalamukhas in other sources—the bath in ashes and the staff (laguda). The bath in ashes is one of the central rituals prescribed in the Pakupata-sutra24 The supposed author of this work, Lakullsa, is held in equally high esteem by both the Pasupatas and Kalamukhas. His name indicates that he also carried a staff (lakula) 2$ The words lakula and laguna are synonymous and etymologically identical. The Kapalikas, on the other hand, normally carry a khafvanga or a trident (trikula). Elsewhere In the Agama-pr&manya, Yamunacarya speaks of a fourfold division of the tantras: Saiva, Pasupata, Saumya, and Llguda.36 This clearly corresponds to the four sects: Saiva, Pliupatu, Kfipfila, and Kaifimukha.Eating from a skull bowl and worshipping the gods with a pot of wine are items especially associated with the Kapalikas, not the KfilSmukhas. Sanskrit sources usually portray Kapalikas as charlatan ascetics who wander about with a skull begging bowl and drink liquor freely for mundane as well as ritual purposes. They also wear the ashes of the dead although no source claims that they eat them.The seeming confusion in Ramanuja’s account between the Kftp&likas and Kalamukhas was noticed by R.G. Bhandarkar who concluded (p. 128) that ‘people do not seem to have made a sharp dintinction’ between them. G.S. Ghurye has suggested (p. 128) that by the twelfth century, the time of the greatest number of KKIlmukha epigraphs, the sect ‘had purged itself of, or had at least suppressed, the more objectionable practices.’ Bhandarkar’s theory is the more plausible one, but neither is very satisfactory. There were in fact considerable differences between the two sects, und Yamuna and Ramanuja must have known how to distinguish them. Ghurye’s theory fails to account for the fact that the earliest K&l&mukha record, an inscription of a.d. 810, shows no more evidence of religious extremism than any of their later records. One might suggest a more sinister explanation. At the time of“ Ed. R.A.

The two Vai$nava priests may have purposely confused the two Saivite sects in order to discredit their more important rivals.Sri-bhcisya ii. 2. 35-37 next gives a list of religious paraphernalia prescribed in the Saivagamas: ‘the rosary of rudrak$a seeds in the hand, a single mass of matted hair on the head, the skull-bowl, the besmearing the body with ashes, etc.’ Presumably Ramanuja means to associate these items with the Saiva sect, but with the exception of the skull-bowl, which does not belong with the Saivas anyway, all the items are part of the costume of most types of Saivite ascetics.This list may be compared with the only significant epigraphic description of a Kalamukha ascetic. A grant of a.d. 1252-53 from Munavajji in Belgaum District praises the Kalamukha rayarajaguru Sarvesvaradeva: ‘whose body was sprinkled with ashes; who wore a srtiall piece of cloth around the loins, and the hairy skin of an antelope; who carried a rosary of Rudrak§as. .. .’27 The loincloth and antelope skin as well as the ashes and rudraksas are standard equipment for most Saivite^ascetics. No mention is made of wine pots or skull bowls.Ramanuja’s £ri-bha$ya ii. 2. 35-37 concludes with a disparaging description of the Kapala vow (vrata) :Likewise, they (?=the Saivagamas, the four sects, the Kapalas) state that even men belonging to lower castes can attain the status of Brahmana and the highest dsrama (=samnyasa, mendicancy) by means of certain special rites. (For it is said): ‘One instantly becomes a Brahmana merely by the process of initiation. A man becomes a great ascetic (yati) by undertaking the Kapala vow.’This may be compared with the following verse from the Kularnava- tantra : ‘Gone is the §udra-hood of the Sudra and the Brahmana- hood of the Brahmana (vipra) ; there is no division into castes for one who is consecrated by initiation.’28 Hostility to caste conscious­ness is a normal feature of tantric worship and is consistently espoused by Kapalikas in Sanskrit literature. From a modern point27J.F. Fleet (ed. and trans.), ‘Sanskrit and Old Canarese Inscriptions Relating to Yadava Kings of Devagiri,’ JBBRAS, XII (1876), 40.^Ed. T. VidySratna, xiv. 91."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"FOUR SA1VITE SECTS7of view this hostility may be commended, but for orthodox Hindu writers such as Ramanuja an attack on caste was an attack on the whole divinely ordained social order (varnairama-dharma).There are also limitations to this tantric rejection of caste which Ramanuja does not choose to note. In most tantric works the denial of caste occurs only in ritual situations. In day-to-day affairs, caste distinctions are still maintained. Thus Kuldrnava- tantra viii.101 says: ‘In this cakra (circle of worship) there is no division into castes. Everyone (in it) is declared to be equal with Siva.’ Elsewhere, however, this text prescribes different lengths of studentship for members of different classes. The Mahanirvana- tantra seems to accept class divisions without qualification.29 The transcending of caste barriers in a ritual context has little or nothing to do with rational materialist arguments. It is part of a mystical reversal and revaluation of all values, eine Umwertung alter Werte, valid only in the sacred circle of worship. In the supra- mundane universe of the ritual, opposites coalesce and change places—the lowest is highest and the highest lowest.30 In relation to caste, this mystical principle culminates with the apotheosis of the dombi (washerwoman) in Kanhapada’s tantric Buddhist songs.31Puraqas and Other SourcesSeveral Puranas and a few other works contain lists incorporating some or all of the sects in the fourfold classification of the Brahma- sutra) commentators.

The term $ivasasana from the Malkapuram inscription does not necessarily refer to the Kapalikas since this identification is based merely on an analogy with the standard fourfold division.54 The term Kahkala (skeleton) from the Skanda Purana almost certainly refers to the Kapalika sect, but the fifth item of this list, Mahavrata, often denotes this sect also. Kalanana (blackfaced) from the Malkapuram inscription is merely a synonym for Kalamukha. A tenth century grant to a Kalamukha priest at Ko<Jumbalur (Tiruchchirappali District) similarly mentions fifty Asitavaktra (black-faced) ascetics residing at his monastery.55 Although the literal meaning of Kaladamana (time-subduing) from the Vamana Purana is consi­derably different, it is evidently another variant of Kalamukha and Kalanana.

In the Kurma Purana Siva says : kI have declared other iastras which are a source of confusion in this world and are opposed to the words of the Vedas. The Varna, Pasupata, Soma, Langala, and Bhairava (sastras) are declared to be outside the Vedas and are not to be served.’57 Yamunacarya is equally critical: ‘Saiva, Pasupata, Saumya, and Laguna are designated as the fourfold division of the Tantras. One should not make a mixture (of these with Vedic rites).’58 The Sktonda Purana, however, at one point declares that only five of the twenty-eight agamas lead to the path of liberation : the Kalamukha, Kankala, Saiva, Pasupata, and Mahavrata.59The remarks of the Vamana Purana vi. 86-92 are the most interesting. It states that Brahma created four groups which worshipped Hara (Siva) and gave them each a sastra: The first is known as Saiva, then PaSupata ..., then the third Kaladamana, and the fourth Kapalika.’ The text then gives a pseudo-historical account of the origin of each :Siva himself was Sakti, the beloved son of Vasis^ha. Gopayana then became his pupil ...Mahapasupata was the ascetic Bharadvaja. His pupil was the king SomakeSvara ...Lord Kalasya was the ascetic Apastamba.

His pupil was the powerful Arnodara, a great ascetic and a Sudra by birth.The apparent associations of teachers and doctrines are Sakti and Saiva, Bharadvaja and PaSupata, Apastamba and Kaladamana (Kalamukha), and Dhanada and Kapalika. The reasons behind this choice of religious founders are obscure. Sakti, Bharadvaja and Apastamba are famous sages and Dhanada is the god of wealth. None are elsewhere connected with these sects with the possible exception of Apastamba.

This sutra prescribes the penance for one who has killed a Brahmana, a Brahmahan : ‘With a skull (sirah-kapall) and a staff (in'his hands), living on alms, announcing his deed (as he begs), and eating little food, the killer of a Brahmana may be purified after twelve years.’1 Other law books prescribe much the same penance but do not use the term kapalin. An important connection between this penance and the Kapalika faith does exist,2 but in this passage kapalin has the sense only of ‘bearing a skull’ and does not imply the existence of a sect or order of Kapalins.In the Maitrdyamya Upani$adcertain Kapalins who hypocritically wear red robes (kasaya) and earrings (kundala) are mentioned among persons with whom it is improper to associate.3 This seems to denote a member of the Kapalika sect, but the relevant passage is definitely an interpolation or appendix to the original text and may be of fairly late date.4The Prakrit Gatha-saptaiatT is traditionally ascribed to the first century a.d. Satavahana king Hala but was probably compiled sometime in the third to fifth centuries. It contains a verse describing a ‘new’ female Kapalika who incessantly besmears herself with ashes from the funeral pyre of her lover.5 The word ‘new’ (nava), unless it means simply ‘young’, suggests that her Kapalika vow was taken at his death.

The astronomer-mathematician Vara- hamihira (c. 500-575) refers to the Kapala vow in his Bfhatsamhita ix. 25 : ‘When the chariot of RohinI (an asterism) is intercepted (by Venus), the earth (becomes) decorated with hair and pieces of bone and seems to keep the Kapala vow, as if it had committed sin.’7 This might refer merely to the Brahmanhan penance, but verse lxxxvii. 22 of this work seems clearly to mention Kapalika ascetics : ‘When (a tranquil omen) is in the southwest (spoke of a ‘Cycle of Quarters’) the arrival of a cow,*a sportsman (kridaka) or a Kapalika is indicated, and one will obtain a bull. (There will also be) black gram, horse-gram, etc. and food.’In his Brhajjataka xv. 1, Varahamihira enumerates seven classes of ascetics, each born under the influence of a different heavenly body.8 He lists them as follows: the Sakyas under Mars, Ajivikas under Mercury, Bhiksus under Jupiter, Vrddhas under the moon, Carakas under Venus, Nirgranthas under Saturn, and Vanyasanas under the sun. The tenth century commentator Utpala (or Bha{- totpala) says that the Vfddhas are also known as Vrddha-sravakas or Kapalikas.9 Utpala also mentions a similar classification made by the fifth century Jain authority, Kalakacarya. This connects the sun with Tapasvins, the moon with Kapalins, Mars with Raktapatas, Mercury with Ekadantjins, Jupiter with Yatis, Venus with Carakas, and Saturn with K§apanakas.10 Again commenting on Varahamirhira’s text, Utpala says: ‘Here the word Vrddha- sravaka implies the wandering ascetics who seek refuge with Mahesvara, and the word Ajlvika those who seek refuge with6Ed.

It is apparently based on an attempt to equate them with Kalakacarya’s Ekadantfins.12 If the identi­fication of Vrddhas or Vrddha-kavakas with the Kapalikas is correct, the claim that they worshipped Mahesvara is also correct. The Vrddha-Sravakas are again mentioned by Varahamihira in his Brhatsamhita li. 20: ‘When a fortune-teller is consulted by persons in the sight of a [Vrddha-sravaka], they do so for the sake of friends or gambling; when in the sight of a friar of decent order [suparivraj], their query concerns a courtesan, king or wife in childbed.’13 H. Kern, the translator of this verse, renders Vrddha-sravaka as ‘skull-wearing Saiva monk,’ presum­ably on the basis of a commentary. We have found no other examples of Kapalikas being called by this name.The famous Chinese pilgrim Hsiian Tsang gives brief accounts of the relative strengths of the various types of Buddhists and other sects in the places he visited during his South Asian travels (c. a.d. 630-644). In KapiSa, modern Nuristan in eastern Afghanis­tan,14 he found over a hundred Buddhist monasteries. In addition, he says, ‘there are some ten temples of the Devas, and 1000 or so of heretics (different ways of religion)\\ there are naked ascetics, and others who cover themselves with ashes, and some who make chaplets of bones, which they wear as crowns on their heads.’15 Beal identifies these heretics as Digambara Jains, Pasupatas, and Kapala-dharins, i.e. Kapalikas.16 Elsewhere Hsiian Tsang gives a general description of various non-Buddhist ascetics he met in India proper :The dress and ornaments worn by non-believers are varied and mixed.

This king’s contemporary biographer Banabhatta vividly portrays the religious life of court and kingdom in his Har$a-carita and Kadambarl. These works show that both primitive and developed types of tantric worship were already widespread in the seventh century. The most archaic level of tantric worship is represented in Kadambarl by the wild Sabara tribe of the Vindhya forest whose ‘one religion is offering human flesh’ to Candika18 and whose chief had shoulders that ‘were rough with scars from keen weapons often used to make an offering of blood’ to Candika.19 The incorporation of ‘Hinduised’ (Eliade) or ‘Sans- kritised’ (Srinivas) forms into the rituals of tribesmen such as these probably amounted to little more than the identification of their tutelary gods and goddesses with Hindu ones such as Bhairava, Kali and Candika.Elsewhere in Kadambarl Bana describes various religious and philanthropic acts performed by Queen Vilasavati of Ujjayini in order to acquire a son:She slept within the temples of [Candika], dark with the smoke of bdellium \\guggulu] ceaselessly burnt, on a bed of clubs covered with green grass ...; she stood in the midst of a circle drawn by [great magicians20], in a place where four roads meet, on the fourteenth night of the dark fort­night . . she honoured the shrines of the siddhas and sought the houses of neighbouring Matrkas ...; she carried about little caskets of mantras filled with birch-leaves written over in yellow letters; ... she daily threw out lumps of flesh in the evening for the jackals; she told pandits the17Trans. ibid., II, 134.«Trans.

Crossroads, for instance, are a focal point for fertility rituals and other religious ceremonies in many parts of the world.22A much more sanguinary amalgam of archaic magic and tantric ritual is described in the Harsa-carita. When Harsa’s father falls ill, the populace of the capital city undertake various penances in order to avert his death :Young nobles were burning themselves with lamps to propitiate the Mothers [Matfkas]. In one place a Dravidian was ready to solicit the Vampire [Vetala] with the offering of a skull. In another an Andhra man was holding up his arms like a rampart to conciliate Candika. Elsewhere young servants were pacifying Mahakala by holding melting gum \\guggulu] on their heads. In another place a group of relatives was intent on an oblation of their own flesh, which they severed with keen knives. Elsewhere, again, young courtiers were openly resorting to the sale of human flesh.23The sale of human flesh to cremation ground demons is mentioned in Bhavabhuti’s Malati-Madhava, in the Kathdsaritsagara, and in other Sanskrit works. Somadeva’s Yatastilaka (a.d. 959) men­tions Mahavratin heroes who sell human flesh cut from their own bodies.24 The term Mahavratin is normally used to denote Kapa- likas.25 The Dravidian in the above passage who offers a skull to a Vetala must also represent a Kapalika or closely related type of ascetic.A tantric ascetic from South India is described in great detail in Kadambarl.

These facts show that tantric worship was fully developed by Bana’s time and was apparently centered mainly in South India.From our point of view the references to the teachings of the MahapaSupatas and to the mountain Sriparvata are of special interest since they both tend to connect this devotee with the Kapalikas and Kalamukhas. We have noted that the Vamana Purdna seems to mention MahapaSupata as the form of Siva who incarnated himself as Bharadvaja for the propagation of the PaSupata doctrine, but that elsewhere it mentions Saivas, Pasu-26Ed.

Handiqui points out (p. 241) that the Mahapasupatas are mentioned by Udayana (late tenth century) and that Varadaraja (eleventh century) and Saipkara Misra (c. 1600) both identify them as those Pasupatas who practised the Mahavrata. A South Indian drama approximately contemporary witfi Kadam- barf, Mahendravarman’s Mattavilasa, seems to address a Kapalika as MahapaSupata 29 A verse found in two Kannada inscriptions from Belgaum District dated a.d. 1148 and 1219-20 seems to identify Kalamukhas as both Mahapasupatas and Mahavratins.30 A few other inscriptions also called Kalamukha priests Mahavra­tins. This is a source of some confusion since Kapalikas are usually given this title, but it is likely that the Kalamukha and Kapalika Mahavratas were quite different vows.31 Since the Kalamukhas were closely related to the ordinary Pasupatas, we feel that it is in general best to connect the Mahapasupatas with the Kalamukhas and not with the Kapalikas or Pasupatas. There is no evidence, however, that either the Kalamukha or Pasupata faiths were markedly tantric in character. For this reason it is quite possible that the Mahapasupata teachings written down by Bana's Dravida- dharmika were Kapalika and not Kalamukha doctrines. This would also agree with the Mattavilasa reference. The conflicting claims of the Kalamukhas, Kapalikas and Pasupatas to the title Mahapa§upata cannot be completely resolved without further evidence.Somewhat the same problem is encountered in the reference to, the Dravitja-dharmika’s wonderful stories about Sriparvata. This famous pilgrimage site in Kurnool District, Andhra Pradesh, is the home of the Kapalikas in Bhavabhuti's MalatT-Madhava^See above, pp. 11-12.29Ed. T.G. Sastri, p. 26. Trans. L.D. Barnett.

Bhairavacarya, the saint who befriended Harsa’s ancestor Puspabhuti, was also from South India (dak$inatya) and also performed a tantric ritual appropriate for a Kapalika. One of his three disciples, Karnatala, was a Dravida and another, Titibha, carried a skull begging bowl (bhiksd-kdpalika) in a box made of kharjura wood.33 Bhairavacarya’s name indicates that he worshipped Siva as Bhairava, the form of the god held in especial esteem by tantric groups such as the Kapalikas. Bana introduces him as the ‘great Saiva saint named Bhairavacarya, almost a second overthrower of Daksa’s sacrifice, &ho belonged to the Deckan [s/c], but whose powers, made famous by his excellence in multifarious sciences, were, like his many thousands of disciples, spread abroad over the whole sphere of humanity.’34The word here translated as ‘great Saiva saint’ (mahaiaiva) does not seem to denote a specific sect or ascetic order. It is simply a descriptive term showing his strong devotion to Siva. The original overthrower of Daksa’s sacrifice was Siva himself. In at least one source, the Vamana-Purdna, Dak§a is said to have refused to invite Siva to his sacrifice because the god had become a Kapalin after cutting off the fifth head of Brahma.35 Siva-Kapalin or Kapalesvara is the divine archetype of the Kapalika ascetic.36When King Puspabhuti, a devout worshipper of Siva (parama- mahesvara), learned of this great saint Bhairavacarya, he expressed a desire to pay him homage. A meeting was arranged and Puspabhuti went to see him in a Bilva tree plantation near an old temple of the Mothers (Mates). The description of the saint which follows is too long to quote in full, but a few of its more interesting features should be noted.37 Puspabhuti saw Bhairavacarya ‘seated on a32See below, pp. 50-51.33Ed.

Suddenly a spirit (puru$a) rose up from a chasm in the earth. This spirit, the Naga Srikanjha, attacked the king and Bhairava- carya’s three disciples. The king used the sword AUahasa given to him by Bhairavacarya to fell this Naga. The king refrained from administering the final blow, however, because the spirit wore a sacred thread. Lak§ml rewarded the king for his piety with the promise that he would become the founder of a mighty line of kings. Having completed the rite, Bhairavacarya acquired ‘the hair-lock, diadem, earring, necklace, armlet, girdle, hammer, and sword’ and became a Vidyadhara.43The powerful spell called Mahakala-hpdaya (Heart of Mahakala- §iva) is not mentioned elsewhere in Sanskrit literature to our knowledge. From the vividness of his description, however, it seems certain that Bana had some real ceremony in mind. Most remarkable is the fact that Ba^a portrays Bhairavacarya sympa­thetically. He is not a wicked magician but a worthy ascetic and a friend and confidant of the founder of the house of Bana’s patron. From this fact we can only infer that by the seventh century tantric religion, even of the so-called ‘left-hand observance’ (vamacara) type, was accepted and supported by many persons of learning and high social status. As a corollary to this, it must also be assumed that the behaviour of most of these ascetics was considerably more circumspect than their critics would have us believe. Two epigraphs from western India show that even the Kapalikas had at least some official support in the early mediaeval period.44 Another indication of public support for this sect is found in Bhavabhuti’s Malatl- Madhava. Although the two major villains of the play are Kapalikas, one of the heroes, the yoginl Saudamini, is also said to observe the vow of a Kapalika.45A wicked counterpart to Bana’s Bhairavacarya appears in Dandin’s Dasakumdra-carita (seventh century).46 Prince Mantra-42Trans.

We have already noted the references in Bana’s works and the association of Kapalikas with Sriparvata in Malati-Madhava. The most important South Indian source is the Mattavilasa. This one act farce (prahasana) was composed by the Pallava king Mahendravarman, who ruled at Kancl between about a .d . 600 and 630. The leading character in the drama is a Kapalin ascetic who lives at the temple of Ekambira- natha near the capital. We will discuss this work in more detail below.50 A contemporary of Mahendravarman, the Saivite ndyatjar Appar, refers to Saivas, Pasupatas and Kapalikas in his vernacular songs.51 The Kapali£vara temple at Mylapore, a suburb of Madras is the subject of a song by Sambandar (c. a .d . 644-660), another of the nayandrs.52 The sixth or seventh century Tamil epic Manimekalai47'asyanaka-narendrasya ... siddhy-antarayah.1 Ed. ibid., text pp.'213-14.^Ibid., text pp. 213-15.49See below, pp. 56-57.50See below, pp. 54-55.51 See M.A.D.

Although it is impossible to date these composite texts accurately, some of them—such as the Brahmanda, Vayu and Matsya—date back to the third to seventh centuries a.d. The Vayu, Brahmanda and Kurma Puranas assert that when the Kali-yuga is in full sway Ka^ayins, Nirgranthas, Kapalikas, Veda sellers, txrtha sellers, and other heretics opposed to varnasrama-dharma will arise.54 Brahmanda ii. 29. 116-17 claims that Svayambhu (Siva) created Pasupata Yoga first and Kapala Yoga last. The Skanda Purana prescribes, as part of the worship of the goddess Paramesvari, the distribution of pots of wine (surdsava) to Kapalikas and male and female slaves.55Kapalika EpigraphyThe epigraphical sources regarding the Kapalikas are very few. Only two inscriptions register donations to Mahavratin ascetics who are fairly certain to have been Kapalikas. The term Kapalika itself, however, appears in three inscriptions from southern Mysore State dedicated to their arch rivals, the Jains. Two are from famous Shravan Belgola and one from Tirumakutfal-Narsipur Taluk in Mysore District. The earliest is from the former site and records the death by the Jain rite of sallekhand (fast unto death) of the Western Ganga king Marasiipha III (a.d. 960-974).56 It is written in Sanskrit and Old Kannada. The author compares Marasiipha to Siva, Lord of the Kapalikas :Famous was the glory of Mandalika-Trinetra (a Trinetra or Siva among the mandalikas or chieftains) as if to make the ...

It does not necessarily imply any sympathy with Saivism. The Kápálikas seem to be either religious mercenaries or simply battlefield scavengers. The possibility that they were militant religious mercenaries is strengthened by the description of a warlike Kápálika band in Mádhavácárya’s Šamkara-digvijaya.58 The strings on which the Kápálikas of the inscription arrange the heads of the king’s Pallava enemies are apparently the traditional skull garlands of these ascetics.The other two inscriptions, both written in Sanskrit, date from the twelfth century. The Shravan Belgola record commemorates the death by sallekhaná of the Jain preceptor Mallisena-Mala- dharideva in a.d. 1 129.59 The inscription from Tirumakudal- Narsipur Taluk, dated a.d. 1183, commemorates the death in the same manner of a preceptor named Candraprabha.60 Both records give a lengthy priestly genealogy of the teachers whose deaths they honor. The genealogies show that both preceptors belonged to the same priestly line. Mallisena’s name does not appear in the later record, however, unless it has been defaced. Both records quote a verse about an earlier teacher named Vimalacandra who hung up a letter—presumably a polemic document of some kind- addressed to the Kápálikas and other opponents :To the gate of the spacious palace of Satrubhayamkara which is constantly thronged with passing troops of horses and numbers of mighty elephants of various kings, the high-minded Ášámbara (i.e. Digambara) Vimalacandra eagerly affixed a letter (addressed) to the Šaivas, the Pášu- patas, the sons of Tathágata (i.e. Buddha), the Kápálikas, (and) the Kápilas.61Šatrubhayaipkara, if this is a proper name, cannot be identified.

Vimalacandra is the nineteenth of forty teachers named in the Malli§ena epitaph. The Parsvanatha-carita, composed by Vadiraja in a.d. 1025, says that Vimalacandra was the disciple of Matisagara, who was the disciple of Sripala of Siqihapura.63 In the epitaph list, however, the eighteenth teacher is one Pu$pasena, who was a contemporary of number seventeen, Akalanka. Three verses which Akalanka addressed to a king named Sahasatunga are quoted. In the last verse he claims that ‘in the court of the shrewd king HimaSItala, I overcome all the crowds of Bauddhas.’64 Akalanka’s exploits are described in other Jain works such as the Rajavali-kathe, the Akalahka-carita, the Akalanka-stotra, and Jinasena’s Adipurana.65 These works identify Himasitala’s capital as Kaiici. According to the Akalanka-carita, Akalanka defeated the Buddhists in year 700 of an era referred to as Vikramarka-Sakabdlya.66 This obscure term might denote either the Vikrama or §aka eras. If the latter— the era most often used in the region—the date would be equivalent to a.d. 777-78. If the former, it would be a.d. 642-43. Another work dates his victory sometime after the year'§alivahana-§aka 710 during the reign o f‘Himasitala-maharaja.’67 This is equivalent to a.d. 787-88. B.L. Rice claims that ‘the Jains have for the date [of Akalanka’s victory] the memorial sentence sapta-sailadra which gives 111 §aka = 855 a.d.’68 This chronogram is probably merely a mystical number. If the suggested date for Jinasena’s Adipurana (between a.d. 782 and 8 38)69 is correct, a.d. 855 is too late for Akalanka. The Pallavas ruled at KaficI during the eighth century, but none of their kings was called Himasltala. Nonetheless it is best to place Akalanka in this period. The king named Sahasatunga to whom Akalanka made his claim might then be the Ra$trakuta king Dantidurga (c. a.d. 733-758).70 If Vimalacandra came not long after Akalanka, he must have lived in about the first half«Ibid., p. 185.«Narasimhachar, EC, II (rev, ed,), intro, p. 84.«Trans. ibid., no. 67.«See Hultzsch, El, III, 187.«See Narasimhachar, EC, II (rev. ed.), intro, p. 84.67W.

This might be the Ra§(rakuta king Kr§na II, who ruled between a.d. 877 and 913.71The three inscriptions thus indicate that Kapalikas were present in southern Mysore during the ninth and tenth centuries. This helps to give credence to the legend of Saipkaracarya’s encounter with some of these ascetics in the Karnata region.72 We know from Mahendravarman’s Mattavilasa that Kapalikas already existed elsewhere in South India at the beginning of the seventh century.73The two grants which register donations to Mahavratin ascetics who must have been Kapalikas are from western India. Both connect these ascetics with the god Siva in his Kapalin or KapaleS- vara form. The earlier grant is a copper plate issued by the early Calukya Nagavardhana, son of Jayasiipha and nephew of PulakeSin II, sometime about the middle of the seventh century.74 It was found in the possession of a resident of Nirpan near Igatpuri in Nasik District. Nagavardhana informed all present and future kings :Be it known to you that ... the village of Balegrama, which lies in the district of Gopara§(ra, has been given by us, at the request of BalSmma-Jhakkura, ... for the purpose of the (rite called) Guggula-puja of the temple of (the god) Kapalesvara, and ... to the great ascetics [Mahavratins] who reside at that (temple).75Balegrama has been identified as modern Belgaum-Taralha about twelve miles north-east of Igatpuri.76 The fact that the god is called Kapalesvara (Lord of the Kapalas) and not KapaleSvara (Lord of the Skull) helps to confirm that the Mahavratins of the temple were Kapalikas.

Panigrahi argues that the well-known Vaital temple in Bhubaneshwar, Orissa, was originally a Kapalika shrine.95 This temple, built in about the eighth century, has Camunda as its presiding deity. In all likelihood it was originally named after this goddess. The Svarnnadri-mahodaya states that ‘the venerable goddess Camunda garlanded with skulls exists at a spot on the west not far from the tank ...,’ and that ‘she is of terrific form and is known as Kapalini.’96 This must refer to the Vaital temple. Although this solitary reference to Camunda as Kapalini cannot be taken as conclusive evidence of Kapalika worship, other features of the temple—such as the fierce deities sculptured around the inner shrine and a panel of erotic couples between the walls and roof—at least indicate tantric influence.Another temple which may have been associated at one time with the Kapalikas is the famous Pasupati temple near Kathmandu in Nepal. An inscription from this temple, written in Sanskrit and belonging to the reign of King Jisnugupta (c. a.d. 630), records a gift to ‘Varahasvamin, Dharma ... and to the Somakhaddukas in the congregation of the Mundasrnkhalika-PaSupatacarya .. .’97 The term Mundasrnkhalika (Wearing a Chain of Heads) is more appropriate for a Kapalika than a Pasupata.

The most important, and probably the earliest, of the extant biographies are the Samkara-vijaya, attributed to his disciple Anandagiri,100 and the Samkara-digvijaya, attributed to the famous Vijayanagar sage Madhavacarya alias Vidyaranya.101 Dhanapati- suri’s Pindima commentary on the latter work adds some extra detail but is mainly extracted from Anandagiri’s account. A signi­ficantly different version of one of the legends is contained in a Kanphata work, the Gorakfa-siddhanta-samgraha.102 None of these sources can lay much claim to historical accuracy. They are collections of stories handed down, embellished and invented during several centuries between the great theologian’s death and their final redaction. Most modern authorities agree that the author of the Samkara-vijava was not Sarpkara’s disciple Anandagiri but an obscure author of about the fifteenth century. Many scholars also believe that the author of the Samkara-digvijaya was not Madhavacarya, the Vijayanagar rajaguru, but a later author who wrote under his name.103 Sarpkara’s disciple could not have written the Samkara-vijaya, but we can see no significant objection to Madhava-Vidyaranya being the author of the Samkara-digvijaya, particularly since the quality of its Sanskrit verse is excellent.ARMAD 1937, pp. 3, 45, 58; ARMAD 1938, p. 5; ARMAD 1939, pp. 55, 57, 72; ARM AD 1940, p. 34; ARMAD 1945, p. 33.100Ed.

The first of these, the story of Samkara’s encounter with a treacherous Kapalika named Ugra- Bhairava, appears in Madhava’s work and in the GSS\\ the second, Samkara’s battle with the militant Krakaca of Karnataka, appears in the works of Madhava and Anandagiri; and the third, Sarpkara’s debate with the casteless hedonist Unmatta-Bhairava, appears in Anandagiri and is repeated in similar wording by Dhanapatisuri.Samkara and Ugra-BhairavaSaipkara’s meeting with Ugra-Bhairava seems to have occurred somewhere along the Krishna River, perhaps at a spot near SriSaila ( = Sriparvata).104 Madhavacarya begins his tale (xi. 1-2) :Once a certain Kapalika there, who hid his own wickedness by adopting the disguise of a sadhu like Paulastya ( = Ravana, in the abduction of SIta) and had not yet completed what he had set out to accomplish, saw the muni (Sarpkara) whose magical power (maya) was limitless.Thinking that his own ambition was as good as achieved, Ugra- Bhairava approached Saipkara and greeted him with fulsome praise. The Kapalika then explained what he had ‘set out to accomplish’ (xi. 9-12) :I will endeavour to please Kapalin (Siva) and thereby achieve my own object.I gratified Ugra (Siva) with arduous and severe penances for a full one-hundred years in order to go to Kailasa with this body to sport with I§a (Siva).Pleased, GiriSa (Siva) said to m e: ‘You will attain the (ultimate) goal which men desire if, for the sake of pleasing me, you sacrifice in the sacrificial fire either the head of an omniscient sage or the head of a king.’,04The location is not explicitly stated. In the previous sarga, however, Saipkara is said to have been travelling along this river from Sri&aila. The Kapalika’s name is not mentioned in Madhava’s text but appears in the commentary and in the GSS."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"KÂPÀLIKA SOURCES33Having said this, MaheSa hid himself. From that time on I have wandered about, my hope fixed on obtaining that, but I have not yet found a (willing) king nor a (willing) omniscient sage.There is little doubt who he had in mind.In order to persuade Saipkara to accede to his implicit demand, Ugra-Bhairava then extolled the great benefits of self-sacrifice (xi. 13-16) :By good fortune I have now seen you, an omniscient sage, travelling about for the welfare of the world. Soon the rest (of my object) will be accomplished, for the bondage of men has its termination in correct vision (samdarsandnta) .The skull of an anointed king or a lord of munis is the prerequisite for my success (siddhi). The former, however, I cannot even conceive of (obtaining). Therefore, it is up to you.In offering your head you will acquire wondrous fame in the world, and I will acquire success (siddhi). After medi­tating on the transience of the body, O Best of Men, you should do what is propitious.I cannot dare to ask (///., my mind cannot ask) for that. Who will (willingly) abandon his own body, the fulfiller of desires? (But) you are indifferent (to worldly desires) and care nothing for the body. (You have) assumed your own body (only) for the benefit of others.Here he even attempts to turn Saipkara’s own Vedantic doctrines against him.Ugra-Bhairava then compared himself, with specious modesty, to those men who are ignorant of the pain of others and think only of their own ends. Such men, he said, are like Indra, who stole a bone from the sage Dadhyanc to use as an axe to slay the ninety-nine Vrtras. Men like Dadhyanc, who abandon their transient bodies for the sake of others, acquire an immutable body of fame (yasah-sarira) . Their priceless virtues delight all mankind. After several more verses in the same vein, Ugra-Bhairava finally made his request (xi. 24): ‘You should bestow (your) head (on me). O Lord, homage to you!’ Saipkara was apparently moved by"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"34THE KARAEVAS AND KAlAMUKHASthe Kapalika’s plea and agreed to grant him his desire. ‘What true sage,’ said Saipkara (xi. 25), ‘who knows the human body here in this world (to be subject to) decay, would not fulfill the request of a supplicant?’ Samkara had to abide by the principles of his theology. Since the soul (atmon) is the only ultimate reality, it matters little what becomes of the body. It is merely the creation of may a. Realizing that his pupils would never allow such idealistic foolhardiness, however, Sarpkara advised Ugra-Bhairava to visit him in secret. The two sealed their pact and Samkara retired to an isolated spot hidden from his pupils.In full Kapalika regalia, Ugra-Bhairava again approached to collect his reward (xi. 30, 32) :(Holding) a trident, with three horizontal lines (drawn across his forehead), looking about (cautiously, wearing) ornaments made of garlands of bones, with his eyes inflamed and rolling about through intoxication, the yogin (Ugra- Bhairava) went to the dwelling place of the teacher ...Beholding that (Kapalika) in the form of Bhairava, the teacher resolved himself to abandon his bodySaipkara then ‘yoked himself with the atman (dtmanam atmany udayunkta)' Sitting in the proper yogic position (siddhasana) , he (xi. 35) ‘forgot the whole world of creation in samadhi.' When Ugra-Bhairava saw him seated in this position, his fears were dispelled and he prepared to strike with his trident. No sooner did he come near to Sarpkara, however, than that sage’s disciple Padmapada magically knew it (xi. 38, 42) :Then, remembering the supreme power of the Man-lion (Vi§nu’s Nrsirpha incarnation) held by Prahlada, which removes the affliction of those who call it to mind, that (Padmapada), well-versed in mantras (mantra-siddha), be­came the Man-lion (incarnate) and saw the ill-intentioned endeavour of (Ugra-Bhairava) ...Running up with great speed he ... tore open with his claws ... the breast of (the Kapalika) who was striking with his trident.This ends Madhava’s version of the encounter."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"KÂPÀLIKA SOURCES35The Goraksa-siddhanta-samgraha belongs to the Kanpha^a or Gorakhnath (Goraksa-natha) tradition, sometimes called the religion of the Nath Siddhas. Many of the tantric practices of its adherents resemble those attributed to the Kapalikas. According to the GSS (p. 16), its philosophy is ‘above dualism and monism (dvaitddvaita-vivarjita).’ In these circumstances it is not surprising that the GSS version of the legend of Sarpkara and Ugra-Bhairava reflects less favourably on the advaita sage. Here the god §ri- Bhairava himself assumed the form of Ugra-Bhairava in order to challenge Saipkara’s religipus beliefs and test their sincerity. The disguised god approached him and said (p. 16) : ‘Sir, you are a samnyasin (and hence) impartial to friend and foe alike and indifferent to the (opposite) senses of word pairs such as bliss and sorrow, etc.’ He immediately requested the sage’s head as an offering to §ri-Bhairava. By this means he would fulfill his vow (pratijHa). Saipkara carefully considered the alternatives (p. 16) :If it is not done (as the Kapalika demands), then there will be the ruin of monism (advaita-hani) since there will not be impartiality towards friend and foe. If it is so done, defeat is (equally certain). Even in this twofold thought there is defeat (of pure non-duality).These unhappy alternatives completely baffled the great sage, and he could say nothing. Madhava posed more or less the same problem but avoided carrying matters to their final philosophical absurdity by the commonsense intervention of Padmapada. The GSS retains this episode but refuses to let it go at that. After he was struck by Padmapada-Nrsiipha,105 Ugra-Bhairava mani­fested his true identity as the god §ri-Bhairava. He then addressed Saipkara in a voice as deep as thunder :Sir, (this is) a defeat for advaita. What has become of that which you said about friend and foe? As a wrestler causes his opponent to fall by falling himself, (I have) accomplished the ruin of (my) opponent’s (i.e. your) doctrine through the loss of my own body. Moreover, now you yourself will also meet your doom. Stand up, stand up! You should fight!106l05The third vowel in Padmapada's name is lengthened in the GSS.106Pp. 16-17.

(Thinking), Tn my own doctrine akriya ([inaction] is proper),' he stood (motionless) in accordance with his devotion to advaita.The Kapalika then created a magical power of Yoga (yoga-maya) and employed it to cut off the heads of Saipkara and his four disciples. Afterwards, however, they were revived. Then,' says the GSS (p. 17), 'true detachment arose.'Although it is clear that the author of the GSS wishes to condemn Samkara’s insistence on akriya (inaction or non-performance of rites), he never really proposes any practical alternative. Whether Samkafa stood up and fought or not, his doom was equally certain. In a sense this paradoxical dilemma is well-suited to a doctrine which says it is 'beyond dvaita and advaita.' Similar statements are found in other tantric texts. In the Kularnava-tantra, for example, Siva declares: 'Some accept dvaita and others accept advaita, (but) they do not know my essence which is beyond dvaita and advaita.’l07 Neither the Tantras nor related Kanphafa literature contain much systematic philosophical speculation. For the most part they are content to loosely synthesise the arguments and hypotheses of the orthodox systems. To a certain extent phrases such as 'beyond dvaita and advaita' merely proclaim the religious superiority of tantric doctrine. They do not necessarily imply any rational, philosophical position. In a sense they are rejections of all rational metaphysics. It is not knowledge, but ritual, devotion and psycho-physical discipline (Yoga) which these schools empha­sise. In this context, there is no need for the GSS to propose an alternative course of action. The author needs only to point out the inadequacy of Samkara’s position. The command to stand up and fight may be interpreted simply as a demand to symbolically acknowledge the self-defeating nature of the doctrine of akriya. Sarpkara's beheading is therefore the occasion for the appearance of true detachment (virdga).lQ&l07Ed. T.

Sri-Bhairava assumes this form to challenge Saipkara, but Ugra-Bhairava himself is neither praised nor condemned. Since both the Kapalika and Kanphata schools belong to the tantric tradition, however, one might expect fhat the Kanphata attitude would be broadly favorable. That this is the case is made clear by some subsequent passages in the GSS. In the first of these the author asserts the superiority of the doctrine of the Nath Siddhas but allows the Kapalika faith a qualified validity (p. 18) :Indeed, some people believe that these (Siddhas) hold the Kfiptlli kn doctrine on account of the mention of the devotion of the KApalika,log but that is not actually (the case). Our doctrine is beyond all worldly ties (avadhuta).Nonetheless, the Kapalika doctrine was also revealed by Nulha (Siva). Natha was the revcaler of this path.The author then quotes from the Sabara-tantra a list of twelve sages to whom the Kapalika doctrine was revealed : Adinatha, Anadi, Kala, Atikalaka,110 Karala, Vikarala, Mahakala, Kala- bhairavanatha, Batuka, Bhutanatha, VIranatha, and Srlkantha.T hese twelve had twelve disciples: Nagarjuna, Jadabharata,I lariscandra, Satyanatha, Bhimanatha, Goraksa, Carpata, Avadya, Vairagya, Kanthadharin, Jalandhara, and Malayarjuna. These pupils were the original ‘promoters of the (Kapalika) path (marga- pruvartakas) 'xu Several of these names recur in traditional Kanphata lists of the eighty-four Siddhas and nine Nathas, most notably the name of Gorakhnath (Goraksa) himself.112 On the basis of this statement and the common features in Kapalika and Kanphata worship, some modern authorities believe that the latterlo claim him for the Kanphata side. The section which immediately follows this passage describes Samkara's spiritual advancement through Visnu, Siva and Sakti worship to his final enlightenment by the Mahasiddhas and his adoption of the Path ol the Nathas {Natha-marga).|,igThis apparently refers to the preceding Ugra-Bhairava episode.,IUS.B.

We feel, therefore, that such historical speculations are of little value.The author of the GSS next poses the question (p. 20) : ‘For what reason was the Kapalika path revealed?’ The answer is found in a myth. Once the twenty-four avataras of Vi§nu became intoxi­cated with pride {mada, also := wine). As mortal creatures amuse themselves, so Varaha (Boar), Nrsiipha (Man-lion), and the other avataras began splitting the earth, frightening wild animals, oppressing towns and villages, and doing other mischief. Krsna was filled with adulterous emotions, and ParaSurama destroyed a great number of k$atriyas to punish the sin of only one of them. Natha became exceedingly angered by these wicked actions and assumed the form of twenty-four Kapalikas.114 In the ensuing battle the Kapalikas cut off the heads of the avataras and carried the skulls about in their hands. This was how the school of Kapalikas (Skull-men) arose. The loss of their heads caused the avataras to lose their pride as well. As a result they were granted a boon. Natha replaced the skulls and returned them to life.115The Ugra-Bhairava legend, whatever its historical value, and this myth both reflect the very real hostility between the tantric sects and Brahmanic orthodoxy. The fact that the author of the GSS chooses the Kapalikas instead of the Siddhas to represent the Kanphaja side of the dispute suggests not only that the two sects were on friendly terms, but also that the stories were already in popular circulation. Madhavacarya’s Vedantic version of the Ugra-Bhairava legend is certainly older than the GSS's Kanphata account.The battle between the V i^u’s avataras and the twenty-four Kapalikas may reflect an extension of the conflict between the1I3Ghurye, p. 128. See also G.W. Briggs, Gorakhndth and the Kanphafa Yogis, p. 218.

In many parts of India the Vaisnavas replaced the Jains in popularity and influence and in the process absorbed many Jain beliefs and prac­tices, including hostility to the excesses of tantric Saivism.116/Samkara and Krakaca or Bodholbana-nityànandaThis legend also has two versions—one by Mâdhava and the other by Anandagiri. Although the broad outlines of the two accounts are identical, several important differences indicate that they may have originated from separate traditions. Anandagiri sets his story in Ujjain while Mâdhava sets his somewhere in Karnâtakà. Mâdhava calls Samkara’s Kâpâlika antagonist Krakaca and Anandagiri calls him Bodholbana-nityànanda. The latter Kâpâlika also has a disciple named Batuka-nâtha. Anandagiri begins his account with a lengthy debate between Samkara and Bodholbana- nityànanda which is omitted by Mâdhava,11\"7 and Mâdhava includes some semi-historical and martial detail omitted by Anandagiri. Since Mâdhava’s version is generally more coherent and complete, we will base most of our discussion on it.According to this version, Samkara had begun a march to Setu (Râmesvaram) in extreme South India accompanied by his best pupils and a king named Sudhanvan. This was the start of a conquest of the four quarters (digvijaya). At Ramesvaram they met a number of non-Brâhmanical and non-Aryan Sâktas whom Samkara defeated in a great debate. The sage honored Lord Râmanâtha and converted the Colas, Pàndyasand Dravidas. Next he proceeded north to Kâflcï, constructed a beautiful temple there, and suppressed the Tântrikas by spreading Goddess worship in a form authorized by the scriptures (sruti-sammata) . Proceeding towards the North­east he passed through Andhra, paid homage to the Lord of the Venkata hills (Venkatâcalesa), and eventually arrived at the capital of the Vidarbha kingdom (eastern Maharashtra) (xv. 1-7} :u^The most obvious example of Jain influence on later Vaisnava attitudes is found in the philosophy of M.K. Gandhi. Although some of Gandhiji’s ideas were inspired in part by European precedents, others —such as his faith in ahimsà. asceticism, cleanliness and vegetarianism—owe more to his Gujarati Vaisnava background. From quite early times Gujarat has been a centre of Jain influence, and all these beliefs derive their original impetus more from Jainism than Hinduism.M7This debate contains much religious information and will be discussed below, pp. 83-85."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"40THE KÁPÁLIKAS AND KÁLÁMUKHASThere the king of the Kratha-Kaisikas (Vidarbhas) approa­ched him with reverence and offered his worship.

Krakaca himself is subsequently said to ‘prattle the essence of the Bhaira- vágam asAt the least, these Bhairava-tantra followers must have belonged to some similar group of Tantrikas.

They revel in the misfortunes of the world and bear hostility against honoured men.1Samkara’s royal disciple Sudhanvan guaranteed the sage protection, however, and they advanced ‘to conquer the multitude of Kápálikas’ (xv. 10-14) :When Krakaca, the foremost of the Kapálin teachers, learned of (Samkara’s) arrival, he came to meet him.Smeared with ashes from a cremation ground (piír-kánana- bhasman), carrying a skull-bowl in his hand, weilding a trident, and accompanied by many whose appearance matched his own, that conceited and proud (Kápálika) spoke thus :‘Although properly ashes are worn (by you),118 for what reason do you hold that impure (clay) bowl and renounce this pure and fitting skull?

The enraged Kapalika soon returned with his followers to seek retribution for this insult. As they approached he shouted : 'I am not Krakaca (= a saw) if I do not cut off your heads1 (xv. 15-17) :He sent out the countless crowds (kulas) of angered Kapalins whose cries were as terrifying as the clouds of the deluge. They attacked with weapons held aloft.The Brflhmana followers of Sarpkara were terrified, but the faithful Sudhanvan countered the Kapalika advance and drove them back. Krakaca then shifted the battle to another part of the field and again threw the Brahmanas into confusion. In desperation they sought Sarpkara's protection (xv. 21) :The king of ascetics (then) reduced those (Kapalikas) ... to ashes in an instant through the fire which arose from his humkara (the sound hum, a mantra).Sudhanvan rejoined Samkara and slaughtered a thousand more of their enemies.

Dhanapatisuri’s Qindima com­mentary, following Anandagiri almost verbatim, continues the story to the final conversion of the Kapalika’s disciples. In this version the god Sarphara-Bhairava did not immediately kill Bodholbana- nityananda. When the god appeared Saipkara paid him homage and set forth his own philosophy in order to justify his action against the Kapalika and his disciples. Bhairava was pleased by the sage’s statements, however, and commanded him : ‘You should make those Kapalikas embrace the faith of the Brahmanas.’120 The god explained that he had become manifest because he was bound by the mantra (mantra-baddha) used by Bodholbana, not because of any merit of that ascetic (na dharmatas). Saqihara- Bhairava then vanished and the followers of the Kapalika doctrine (Kapdlika-matdnugas) — who were of twelve sorts, Bajukas, etc.— bowed down to Saipkara. The sage was filled with compassion and instructed Padmapada and his other disciples to convert the repentant heretics.121Unfortunately neither the commentator nor Anandagiri identifies the ‘twelve sorts (dvddakadha) of Kapalikas beginning with the Batukas.’ Ba{uka, however, appears as one of the twelve original Kapalika sages in the Sabara-tantra list quoted in the Gorakfa-,19xv. 26. Anandagiri’s account of this episode is worth comparing. Seeing that he and his pupils had been beaten by Sarpkara, Bodholbana-nityananda approached the sage and said (chap. xxiii): 4 “Samhara-Bhairava is to be honored by me. I will cause him to appear by means of mantras. He will quickly devour you and your retinue/* Saying this and again uttering (the sound) hum; holding a human skull with his left hand; filling that with liquor by means of a mantra; drinking half (of it) himself and giving the remainder to his pupils; and looking into the middle of the sky with round and reddened eyes—he said: “(You), who are Saiphara-kala (Destruction-time), Bhairava, Prabhu, and ISvara, should come and speedily devour the sarpnydsin and his retinue.’ ’’i20Dindima commentary, vs. 8, on MadhavacSrya, xv. 28.*2ilbid., vss. 1-14."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"KAPALIKA SOURCES43siddhcmta-samgraha.m Evidently these twelve sages were considered to be the founders of twelve divisions of the Kapalika sect. The presence of this tradition in such unrelated sources suggests that there may have been some factual justification for it.The personalities of the two legendary Kapalikas, Krakaca and Ugra-Bhairava, are quite distinct—where the latter used guile the former chose brute force—but in appearance Krakaca, like Ugra- Bhairava, is a typical Kapalika. He smears his body with the ashes of the dead; he carries a trident and a skull bowl; he worships Bhairava and Mahakapalin; his text is the Bhairavagama; he honours this god with liquor and offerings of human heads; and he imagines salvation as the indescribable bliss of an endless embrace in the arms of Uma.Both the location and the large size of Krakaca’s Kapalika battalions merit additional comment. In Madhavacarya’s version the Vidarbha king warned Sarpkara against going to the Karnata region because it was populated by ‘many crowds of Kapalins.’123 Dhanapatisuri glosses this location as the town Ujjayani (sic), but this cannot be correct. He apparently relies for this identification on Anandagiri, who begins his version (chap. xxiii) : Travelling along the northern road, §ri-§arpkaracarya ... saw the city named UjjayinI which was filled with (persons) devoted to the Kapalika observance.’ The Karnata region approximately corres­ponds with modern Mysore State and never included the famous Malava city, Ujjain.124 Evidently there were two separate traditions. Reasons exist for both these places to be associated with the Kapalikas.Neither Madhavacarya’s Samkara-digvijaya nor Anandagiri’s Samkara-vijaya can claim much historical accuracy. Both are products of about the fourteenth or fifteenth century and both tend to shed as much light on the religious life of India during the century or two preceding their composition as on the religious life ofl22See above, pp. 37-38.i23Madhavacarya xv.

The mafha at this place was supposedly founded by Marulasiddha, one of the five great acdryas of Virafcaiva tradition. See M.R. Sakhare, History and Philosophy of Lingayat Religion, pp. 361-62. Unfortunately Anandagiri’s statement that Saipkara reached UjjayinI ‘travelling along the northern road’ makes this identification less likely."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"44THE KAPALIKAS AND KALAMUKHASthe time of Samkaracarya. The Karnataka region, which seems to have been the home of Ugra-Bhairava as well as Krakaca, was domi­nated by the Kalamukhas during the eleventh to thirteenth centuries. Since no lesser authorities than Yamunacarya and Ramanuja associate, and perhaps confuse, the two sects, there is at least a prima facie case that Madhava did the same. Krakaca's dress, behaviour and religious beliefs are definitely those of a Kapalika, not a Kalamukha, but in one important respect he and his followers have more affinity with the latter sect.In Madhava’s story Krakaca is said to command vast legions of Kapalikas (Kapalifdlah, Kapdlika-jalakah, Kapalinam kuldni). Nearly every other story featuring Kapalikas describes them as solitary peripatetic ascetics, occasionally joined by a single female disciple. This absence of organization may help to explain the relative lack of Kapalika epigraphy. The Kalamukhas, on the other hand, usually established themselves in large monastic communities. It seems quite likely that Madhava was modelling his Kapalika legions on the brotherhoods of the Kalamukha mathas. As in the accounts of Yamunacarya and Ramanuja, the confusion between the two sects may have been intentional. This would help explain the absence of any mention of Kalamukhas in Madhava's work.Although in each chapter of Anandagiri's Samkara-vijaya Samkara debates a different rival sect, the Kalamukhas do not appear in this work either. Since the Malava Ujjain was never a center of the Kalamukhas, however, it is less likely that Anandagiri was confusing the two sects. There is a tenuous connection between this town and the Kapalikas in the fact that Bhavabhuti wrote his MalatT-Madhava for the festival of Lord Kalapriya, who is usually identified with the god Mahakala of Ujjain. The play is set, however, in Padmavati, a town which scholars locate some 220 miles north of Ujjain near modern Narvar.125 Today Ujjain is an important center of the Kanphata yogins.126 If Gorakhnath's commonly accepted date, c. a.d. 1200, is correct, this town may well have been a Kanphata center by the time of Anandagiri (about the fifteenth century).127 Since Kanphata Yogins also organise them­125See the introduction to Devadhar and Suru’s edition of the play. p. 4.U6Ghurye, p. 137.127Although Anandagiri's date is not certain he seems to have lived sometime after Madhavacarya. Since the Kalamukhas were already rapidly declining in Madhava’s time, this is another reason why it is unlikely that Anandagiri was con­fusing them with the Kapalikas."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"K.ÂPÂLIKA SOURCES45selves into monastic communities, Anandagiri might have confused them and the Kapalikas.Whether Krakaca’s ascetic legions are modelled on the orga­nization of the Kalamukhas, Kanphatas, or Kapalikas themselves, their militancy is quite striking. Military orders of religion were not unknown, however, either in mediaeval India, mediaeval Europe, or sixteenth century Japan. In Europe the Crusades produced several military orders, the most famous being the Templars and the Hospitallers. These orders not only fought against the Muslim princes of the Holy Land but also on occasion joined forces with these very princes against each other.128 In the sixteenth century Japan witnessed the Ikko Ikki or Fanatic Risings by monks of the Pure Land (Jodo) sect, who fought with their sectarian enemies and in many places even challenged the authority of the feudal lords.129Although the mutual tolerance shown by religious groups native to India has always been remarkable, rivalry among them, especially for royal patronage, sometimes led to violence. In ancient times competition usually took the form of great public debates which often became miracle contests. One such contest between Buddha and the Ajivika teacher Purana Kassapa took place at Sravasti in North India. It seems to have ended with some sort of riot in which the Ajlvikas were expelled.130 In some cases defeat in debate led to royal persecution. According to a South Indian legend, the famous nayanar Nanasambandar once vanquished the Jains in debate and converted the Pancjya king to Saivism. The king then executed 8,000 Jains by impalement.131 The Kalamukhas are frequently extolled for their debating skill, but most of their debates—like that between Bonteyamuni and some rival logicians132 —seem to have been peaceful ones. In about a .d . 1160, a debate cum miracle contest between the Virasaiva leader Ekantada Ramayya and the Jains at Ablur in Dharwar District, Mysore, ended with the defeat of the latter.

These akhadas (regiments) are still in existence. Nominally at least, their members belong to one or other of the ten orders of Saivite ascetics reputedly founded by Saipkaracarya (the Dasanamis) .The Juna Akhatfa (Old Regi­ment) was formerly known as the Bhairava Akhatfa. Its present tutelary deity is Dattatreya but originally must have been Bhairava. The traditional date for its establishment is a .d . 1146, but Ghurye (p. 104) believes that it is descended from an older sect of Saivites, namely the Kapalikas. This is a tempting suggestion, particularly since one of the akhadas centers is at Ujjain. It is difficult to see, however, how it could have survived a transition from the Kapalika faith to Vedanta. The traditional dates for the foundation of some of the other akhadas go back to as early as a .d . 647, but the earliest reasonably verifiable date for an actual battle involving Naga Samnyasins is a .d . 1266. Most of their recorded activity belongs to the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries and culminates in a great victory t^ver the Vai$nava Bairagis at Hardwar in 1760.134The preceding discussion suggests an interesting but admittedly hypothetical chain of events. An original historical debate between Saipkara and some Kapalika ascetics either at Ujjain or somewhere in Mysore ended in a riot during which the Kapalikas were put to flight and some possibly converted. In succeeding centuries this story was gradually elaborated until the original antagonists became a vast army of warlike monks modelled in part either on the Kalamukha monastic orders (Madhava) or on the newly emerging military orders of medieval India (Anandagiri).Samkara and Unmatta-BhairavaThis legend appears in Anandagiri’s Sarpkara-vijaya, chapter xxiv, and in Dhanapatisuri’s pindima commentary on Madhava’s Samkara-digvijaya xv. 28.

A certain Kapalika of the Sudra caste (jati) named Unmatta- Bhairava (lived) there. His body was covered with ashes from a funeral pyre; his neck was ringed with a garland of human skulls; (three horizontal) streaks of lamp-black were drawn across his forehead; all his hair was fashioned into a top-knot (jata-juta); his waistband and loincloth were made from a tiger skin; a skull-bowl adorned his left hand; his right hand held a loudly ringing bell (ghanta) ; and he was chattering repeatedly ‘O Sambhu-Bhairava! Aho, Kalisa!’This classic description of a Kapalika ascetic is followed by a derisive exposition of his hedonistic doctrine, a doctrine more suitable for a Carvaka or Lokayatika than a Kapalika. Unmatta- Bhairava came to meet Sarpkara and proclaimed to him the superiority of the Kapalika faith over all others. He lamented the fall of Batukanatha, Bodholbana’s disciple, and the other Kapalikas from the true faith and said : Their undoing (was their reliance on) being of the Brahmana caste. I will have nothing to do with caste.’136 He then gave a materialistic justification for his rejection of caste and suggested that there are only two real castes, the male-caste and the female-caste. He also asserted that promiscuity is the proper rule of conduct between them since the joy (ananda) of sexual union is the true form of Bhairava, and the attainment of that joy at death is salvation (moksaJ.137Saipkara listened politely to the Kapalika’s blasphemy and said (vs. 23): ‘O Kapalika, this was well said.

To his own disciples Samkara explained (vss. 28-30) :T have come only to punish Brahmanas who have embraced a bad faith and not others. This man is not to be spoken to. Take him away quickly.’This legend provides a good example of the accusations of hedonistic licentiousness which orthodox writers are fond of leveling against tantric ascetics. These accusations have some factual basis. Sex and alcohol, for instance, do play an important part in tantric ritual. In the daksindeara tradition symbolic equi­valents are substituted or the rituals sublimated into mere mental exercises, but in the vdmdcdra tradition of the Kapalikas real women and wine were employed. Nonetheless, the assertion that the Kapalikas were hedonists and that they justified this hedonism with a thoroughly materialistic philosophy cannot be accepted. Materialistic hedonism falls within the province of Lokayata and Carvaka philosophy, not tantricism. This is not to say, of course, that many tantric ascetics were not licentious. Unmatta-Bhairava's orgasmic conception of moksa and his rejection of caste, however, are at least partly confirmed by other sources and will be discussed in more detail elsewhere.140Kapalikas in Sanskrit DramaVillainous Kapalika ascetics appear in a number of Sanskrit dramas and stories.

Bhavabhuti was an orthodox Brahmana from a family which followed the Taittiriya branch of the Yajurveda. He may have had some Saivite leanings but was not a strict sectarian.149 It is likely that Ksemisvara, the author of Candakausika, was also an orthodox Brahmana. Krsnamisra used his allegorical Prabodhacandrodaya to extol the merits of advaita Vai$navism. Sankhadhara seems to have favored some moderate form of Saivism since his Latamelaka opens with introductory verses to Gaurl and Siva. Ramacandra and Yasabpala were both devout Jains.All these writers express their contempt for the orgiastic and sadistic features of the Kapalika cult. This is particularly true of the Jains, whose extreme asceticism made them natural enemies of tantncism. The distain of the orthodox Saivite writers, on the other hand, probably reflects a desire to disavow any association with their heretical brethren. It is significant, perhaps, that Kr§na- miSra, a strong Vaisnava, attacks a Carvaka, a Digambara, a Buddhist, and a Kapalika but neglects to mention any of the more respectable Saivite sects.The dramas provide some important additional information about the geographical distribution of the Kapalikas. The Matta- vilasa is set in Kanci, the capital of Mahendra. The Kapalika ascetic of the play is said to live at Ekambam (eamvvavasl).{5° This must refer to the Ekambira-natha temple, which is still one of the major temples of Kanchipuram. In its present form, however, the building dates from a later time than Mahendra’s. Bhavabhuti’s Malati- Madhava, as we have noted, is set in Padmavatl, a town which was probably located about 100 miles south of Agra. The Kapalika Aghoraghanta operates from a temple of Karala situated in the cremation ground of that town, but his home is said to be the mountain Sriparvata.151 Another character, the virtuous yogini Saudamini, is said to be ‘observing the vow of a Kapalika on Sri- parvata.’152 The heroine Malati is eventually abducted to this place by Aghoraghanta’s female disciple, Kapalakuntfala.,48See ibid.149Bhavabhutfs name means either ‘wealth of Siva’ or ‘ashes of Siva.’150Ed.

It is mentioned in the Mahabharata as a place sacred to Siva and Devi.153 In Matsya Purana clxxxi. 28-29, it is listed as one of eight secret places sacred to Siva. The Mallikarjuna lihga at the site is one of the twelve jyoiirlingas of Siva.154 Today the shrine is held in especial esteem by the ViraSaivas. The earliest references to Mallikarjuna worship on Sriparvata are found in Subandhu’s Vasavadatta (c. a.d. 600)155 and the Padma Purana.156 Madhavacarya claims that Samkaracarya himself visited the shrine of this god on Srisaila.157 In a.d. 1090 a Kalamukha priest of the Parvatavali named Ramesvara-pandita was the head of the Mallikarjuna-sila-matha on this mountain.158 A few years earlier, in 1057, the Western Calukya king Somesvara I came to Srisaila and washed the feet of the Kalamukha teacher SureSvara-pantfita in the presence of the god Mallikarjuna.159 In Banabhatta’s Kadambari, as we have seen,160 the South Indian tantric priest who lived in the Candika temple near Ujjain is said to know ‘thousands of wonderful stories about Sriparvata.^ In his Harsa-carita; Bana calls Harsa a ‘Sriparvata of magical powers (siddhis)'x6x These two references by Bana indicate that Sriparvata was already famous as a center of tantric worship by the first half of the seventh century, but Kalhana is the only author besides Bhavabhuti to specifically connect it with the Kapalikas.162 Some­time before the eleventh century the temple of Mallikarjuna came into the hands of the Kalamukhas. We do not know what sort of relations, if any, they maintained with the Kapalikas. It is not likely that the two sects were ever on very friendly terms. By about the fourteenth century the Kalamukhas had been /eplaced by the Vlrasaivas.

This king was also the patron of Rajasekhara. Krsnamisra composed the Prabodhacandrodaya for Kirttivarman (c. 1070-90), a Candella king of Jejakabhukti (modern Bundelkhand region). Sankhadhara's Latamelaka was written during the time of Govindacandra (c. 1114-54), a Gaha4avala king of Kanauj. Ramacandra and Yasahpala both lived in northern Gujarat during the reign of the Caulukya king Ajayapala (c. 1172— 76). Yasahpala’s Mohardjapardjaya describes the conversion to Jainism of Ajayapala's predecessor, Kumarapala (c. 1143-72). A Kapalika is included among the enemies of this king. In Rama- candra's Nalavilasa, a reworking of the Nala-DamayantI legend, some Kapalikas appear as spies of Citrasena, a Kalacuri-Cedi king. This king is probably modeled on one of the Kalacuri kings of Tripuri (near Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh) since one or more of these kings is believed to have fought with Kumarapala.163 The play is set in Vidarbha.If all the information about the distribution and dates of the Kapalikas is collated, we find that they existed throughout most of the Deccan plateau as early as the eighth century. They are connected specifically with Kancl, parts of Mysore, western and central Maharashtra, Ujjain, the Gwalior region of Madhya Pradesh, and Kurnool District in Andhra Pradesh. They may also have been found in Orissa (Bhubaneswar) by this date. Sources later than the eighth century indicate their presence in Gujarat, Bundelkhand, the Vindhya hills, and other parts of India.164 According to Bhavabhuti, Sriparvata in Kurnool District was a particularly important Kapalika center in his time. In later centuries, however, they were replaced at this site by the Kalamukhas. Areas from which we have no pre-ninth century records of Kapalikas include Bihar, Uttar Pradesh (except Varanasi), Rajasthan, Punjab, Kashmir, and West Pakistan—the whole of ancient Aryavarta.

These rumors are undoubtedly little more than old wives’ tales, but some Vamacara ascetics do survive in this region.Although the evidence is very scanty, it appears likely that the Kapalikas originated in South India or the Deccan. This is not surprising since the region south of the Vindhyas was dominated by Saivism from very early times. The earliest epigraphical reference to tantric worship occurs in Visvavarman’s a.d. 423-424 record from Gangdhar in south-eastern Rajasthan near Ujjain.166 Further south, in Tamil country, the early inhabitants worshipped the god Murugao with rites which might be called tantric in character.167 Murugan was later identified with Siva's warlike son Skanda.The precise date of the foundation of the Kapalika order is impossible to establish. It is unlikely however, that these ascetics existed more than a century or two before the time of Mahendra, the author of the Muiiavildsa. This period, the fifth to the sixth century a.d., also marks the time of the first development of tantric literature in the subcontinent. The Kapalikas appear to have virtually died out by about the fourteenth century. The sect was perhaps absorbed by other Saivite tantric orders such as the Kanphatas and the Aghoris.168Kapalika characters have important roles in only four of the dramas—Mattavilasa, MalatT-Madhava, Candakausika, and Pra- bodhacandrodaya. The Kapalika Satyasoma in Mahendra’s Mat- tavilasa is a wholly comic creation, reminiscent in many respects of the Kapalika hedonist Unmatta-Bhairava. The Kapalikas in Mdlarf-Madhava and Candakausika, on the other hand, are nefarious rogues similar to Krakaca and Ugra-Bhairava. In the Prabodhacandrodaya the Kapalika Somasiddhanta displays both comic and horrific traits.To some extent dramatic requirements, both practical and theoretical, have influenced the differing treatments of these ascetics.

As a result, the plots of many dramas are recapitulations and elaborations of popular legends and myths, and the characters are representatives of ideal types and sentiments, not people. The influence of the rasa theory is particularly noticeable in Malatl- Madhava. The act in which the Kapalikas appear is meant to evoke the sentiments of terror (bhayanaka, based on the emotion of terror, bhaya) and horror (bibhatsa, based on disgust, juguptsd), and these sentiments are embodied in them.The Mattavilasa is a one act farce (prahasana) in which the comic sentiment (hasya) naturally predominates. Satyasoma, a drunken Kapalin or Kapalika and his equally tipsy wench, Deva- soma, engage in some classic slapstick and clever banter with a Buddhist friar, a PasUpata monk, and a raving madman. As they enter the stage, Devasoma finds that she is too drunk to stand upright and calls for Satyasoma’s assistance. Equally drunk, he falls as he lifts her up. In his befuzzlement Satyasoma calls Deva­soma Somadeva and is accused by her of having another mistress. He offers to forswear liquor to atone for his mistake, but she protests : ‘O, master!

Without the skull bowl, however, he fears he will lose the title of Kapalin (SkuII-bearer). Even worse, the skull had some nice roast meat in it. As they set off in search of the skull, a Buddhist friar passes by on his way to the King’s Monastery with a full alms bowl hidden under his robe. The friar’s favorite pastime is looking for an ‘uncorrupted original text’ wherein the Buddha sanctions ‘possession of women and use of strong drink.’ Satyasoma and Devasoma see that he is hiding something and accuse him of taking their skull. The Buddha, Satyasdma taunts, is superior even to Kharapafa, the author of the Thieves’ Hand-book, for :Your Buddha, while the Brahmans’ eyes were closed,Filled up his granary by filching notionsFrom Mahabhtiratam and from Vedantas.171Devasoma offers her master a drink and he passes the cow’s horn to the friar. Even though this fellow has wronged us, Satyasoma declares, nonetheless ‘our doctrine lays chief weight on sharing our goods.’ Visibly licking his chops, the friar is forced to refuse because he is afraid someone might see. The argument becomes more and more heated and Satyasoma finally threatens to make the friar’s own head into an alms bowl. They begin to fight but are stopped by Babhrukalpa, the Pasupata monk, who agrees to act as mediator. In reality, however, he is more interested in win­ning Devasoma than in settling the dispute. The friar is at last forced to show the bowl which he had hidden in his robe. Satyasoma and Devasoma refuse to admit that it is not their skull and claim that the friar merely changed’its color and shape. Babhrukalpa suggests they take the matter to court, but before they can do so the madman enters carrying the skull bowl which he had taken from ‘a most respectable dog belonging to a Candala.’ He offers the skull to Babhrukalpa, who rejects it, but refuses to give it to its rightful owner, Satyasoma. They all attempt to trick the madman into giving it up, but he is adamant. Finally, when the friar calls him a madman, he tells Satyasoma to ‘take this skull and show me the madman.’ Satyasoma obligingly misdirects him and everyone parts the best of friends.17lTrans.

In his left hand he holds a ‘glistening chunk of human flesh dripping with clotted blood.’ As the Kapalika woman exits Madhava enters. He laments his separation from Malatl and offers the flesh for sale to the fiendish local residents. His lengthy description of their loathsome activities serves as Bhavabhuti’a vehicle for expressing the sentiment of horror (hlbhatsa). As Madhava passes near the temple of Karala, he hears a voice crying out in distress and goes to investigate.Kapalakundala and Aghoraghanta then enter with Malatl, who wears the marks of a sacrificial victim. The Kapalikas offer obeisance to the goddess Camunda and describe her fearful dance as they themselves dance about the stage. Malati’s last wish— that Madhava should remember her even in death—wins the sympathy of the cruel Kapalakundala, but Aghoraghanta remains pitiless. Raising his weapon, he calls upon Camunda to accept his offering. In the nick of time Madhava rushes forward to save Malatl. As the two men prepare to fight, soldiers are heard approa­ching the temple looking for her. This ends the fifth act called ‘Description of the Cremation Ground.’In act six Kapalakundala tells how Madhava has killed her guru and swears revenge. Much later, when Malatl and Madhava are again briefly separated as they are about to be secretly married, Kapalakundala has her chance. She captures the heroine and flies off to Sriparvata with her. Act nine opens with the entrance of the yogini Saudamini, a former pupil of the go-between Kamandaki. The yogini, who has just flown up from Sriparvata, finds the de- separate Madhava and tells him that she has intercepted Kapala­kundala and rescued his precious Malatl. The lovers are eventually reunited and all ends happily.The Candakausika (Angry Kausika) by K$emi£vara is an adaptation of the puranic myth about King Hariscandra and the175Act V. after vs. 4 (my translation)."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"58THE KAPALIKAS AND KAlAMUKHASirascible sage Visvamitra Kausika,176 One day the king accidentally interrupted the sage’s meditation. As reparation he offered his whole kingdom, but the sage was still not satisfied and demanded a final fee (dakflnd) as well. The king set out for Varanasi to earn it. In this city he resolved to sell himself into slavery. His virtuous wife, who had followed him to the market, rushed forward ahead of him and sold herself as a domestic slave to a Brahman teacher. Kausika was not placated by her self-sacrifice, however, and the king in desperation declared that he would sell himself even to a Canqlala. The god Dharma immediately appeared in the disguise of a Cantata and purchased the king as a keeper.Act four, like the fifth act of Malati-Madhava, takes place in the cremation ground. Hariscandra’s duty was to take the blankets from the dead for his new master. Dharma entered, this time dis­guised as a Kapalika, and said :Here am I, sir—Subsisting on alms given without asking for them and calmed by control over the five senses, I have crossed the great cremation ground of transmigratory existence (saipsdra) and now roam this disgusting cremation ground.(Reflecting) . It is quite suitable that divine Rudra per­formed the Mahavrata. Supreme indeed is this excellence of (those who) roam at will. B ut-Being exclusively devoted to alms alone, penance alone, and rites alone—all this is easy to obtain.

While the king warded off the vighnas, the Kapalika left in search of a great treasure of magical quicksilver (siddharasa) located somewhere nearby. The female Sciences (Vidyas) then appeared and offered their services to the king, but he told them to wait upon the revered Viivamitra KauSika instead. Meanwhile the Kapalika returned with a Vetala who carried the treasure of magical quicksilver on his shoulder. This treasure, the Kapalika claimed, could bestow immortality :Driving away death through its use and at once attaining the path to the immortal world, the Perfected Ones (Siddhas) enjoy themselves on the peaks of Meru, where the wishing tree (kalpa-druma) bears clusters of blossoms.179He offered it to the king who refused to accept it for himself since this would be inconsistent with his condition of slavery. He requested the Kapalika to give the treasure to the Cantjala.HariScandra was given one more great test of character. His wife entered the cremation ground bearing the body of their son, and the king was forced to demand the funeral blanket as his master’s due. After he had snatched it away, flowers fell from the sky and the gods sang his praises. The child revived and was crowned king of his father’s empire. Hariscandra and his wife ascended to heaven amidst great rejoicing.The Prabodhacandrodaya of Kr§namisra180 is an allegorical nafaka dedicated to the defense of advaita Vai$navism. Most of the characters are personifications of abstract qualities such as Discrimination (viveka), Confusion (moha), Falsity (dambha), and Faith (sraddha). The third act introduces four heretical sectarians who are the friends and auxiliaries of Passion (maha- moha) : a Materialist (Carvaka), a Jain (Digambara or K§apanaka) a Buddhist monk (Bhik§u), and a Kapalika called Somasiddhanta. Two virtuous maidens, Tranquility (santi) and Compassion (karund), enter in search of Tranquility’s mother, Faith.

I view the world as alternately (or mutually) separate and not separate from God (Isvara) through eyes that are made clear by the ointment of Yoga.The Jain Ksapanaka, curious to hear about the Kapalika vow (vrata), asks Somasiddhanta to explain his conception of dharma and moksa.

At the command of her master she embraces first the Buddhist and then the Jain. The resistance of both is soon shipwrecked on the shore of lust. They plead with Somasiddhanta to initiate them into the most excellent doctrine of Mahabhairava. He orders them to sit and takes up a vessel of liquor. He drinks from it and offers the remainder to his new disciples (act III, vs. 20) :Drink this purifying nectar. It is the remedy prescribed by Bhairava against (transmigratory) existence. It is the means of cutting away the bonds of creaturehood (pasu-pasa) .They at first refuse this polluted and improper drink, but when Faith takes a sip they can contain their eagerness no longer and together imbibe the wine, which is made ‘fragrant with the liquor from the mouth of the Kapalini.’ The two are soon drunk. Pleased with his work, the Kapalika says to his Faith : ‘Love, we have obtained a pair of slaves purchased without capital. Let us now dance.’ As they all dance about, he extols his doctrine in which the eight great powers (mahasiddhis) are won without having to abandon the objects of the senses.182 The Ksapanaka then praises his new ‘king of teachers’ and kulacarya.l83 The Bhiksu sees that the Jain is drunk and asks Somasiddhanta to sober him up. Soma­siddhanta does this by giving.the Jain some half-chewed betel nut. The three heretics then draw up a plan to capture Faith for their king, Passion, but they soon discover that she has been joined by Visnu-devotion and Dharma and has entered the ranks of their enemy, the good king Discrimination.

One of the heroes of the play causes the revived corpse to strike down the Kapalika. The same author’s Nalavilasa186 features two Kapalikas—Lam- bodara (Hanging-belly) alias Ko§(haka (Stomach) alias Bhasmaka (Ashes) and his teacher Ghoraghona (Horrible-snout) alias Me§amukha (Sheep-face). Both are spies for Citrasena, a Kalacuri- Cedi king. The spies are devious but rather amusing. In YasahpSla’s Mohardjaparajaya187 five heretics—a Kaula, a Rahamana (Muslim), a Ghataca|aka, a Nihilist (Nastika), and a Kapalika—each give a one verse summary of their faith.

Tantric religion contains an amalgam of hedonistic and sadistic elements. The playwrights have simply emphasised one or other of these two elements in accordance with their artistic purposes and religious prejudices. Since hedonism lends itself easily to comic treatment, farces such as Mattavilasa and Lafamelaka feature Kapalika sybarites. Those authors whose aim is to horrify lay stress on the more sinister aspects of the cult. One work, the Pra- bodhacandrodaya, includes both elements. Although the account in this play is still highly tendentious and distorted, it is in many respects the most informative. We must postpone a fuller discussion of Kapalika religion until after we have reviewed the descriptions of these ascetics in religious and narrative literature.Miscellaneous Later SourcesStories about Kapalikas occur frequently in katha collections such as Somadeva’s Kathasaritsagara (c. 1063-81).

She was seen there by a ‘hypocritical Kapalika.’190 He immediately fell in love with her and retired to a cremation ground to attempt to make her his wife by means of a spell (mantra) and burnt offering. Madanamanjari learned of his plan through her magical power but was helpless against his Yak§a-subduing spells. Drawn by these spells she reached ‘the terrible cremation ground which was filled with bones and skulls and frequented by demons.’ There she saw the wicked Kapalika. He had made a fire for oblations and a ritual circle (mandaia) in which he worshipped a supine corpse.191 Madanamanjari invoked the protection of king Vikramaditya who immediately appeared accompanied by a Vetaia named Agniiikha. The king ordered the Vetaia to ‘kill and eat this evil K&palika Nyho has carried off another's wife.' The Vetaia entered the corpse which rose up and quickly dispatched the Kapalika.Another lecherous Kapalika appears in the story of a young Brahman named Candrasvamin.192 One day this Brahman went to town on an errand. Meanwhile a Kapalika came to Candras- vamin’s house and happened to see his beautiful wife. The lady immediately contracted a fever and died that evening. By the time Candrasvamin returned, his wife’s relations had already placed her body on a funeral pyre. As he approached the blazing pyre he saw the Kapalika. On his shoulder the ascetic carried a ‘dancing’ khafvanga staff, and in his hands he held a thundering damaruka drum. When he threw ashes on the fire, the lady stood up uninjured. Drawn by his magical power (siddhi), she ran away with him to a cave on the bank of the Ganga. In the cave were two captive maidens. After putting down his khatvahga, the Kapalika exclaimed to them : ‘My vow has attained success (siddhi). I Imve now obtained her withoilt whom I could not enjoy you two evem though I had obtained you.’ The lady’s husband Candrasvamin !ted followed them there, however, and, seeing his chance, he threw the khatvahga into the189Ed.

Without the magic of his staff, the Kapalika was powerless. He tried to flee but was killed by one of Candrasvamin’s poison arrows. ‘Thus,’ says Somadeva (xviii. 5. 16), ‘heretics, who make a mockery of the Sivagamas for the pleasure of evil accomplishments, fall (into ruin), just as they had already fallen (into sin).’ Candras- vamin released the two bewitched maidens and returned home with his wife.Another story from the Kathasaritsagara, that of the Brahman gambler Devadatta (v. 3. 196ff.), has as one of its central characters a Mahavratin named Jalapada. One day Devadatta gambled away all his possessions, even his clothes, and was unable to return home to his father’s house. He entered an empty temple where he saw the solitary Mahavratin, whose magic had accomplished many things, muttering mantras. Devadatta greeted him respect­fully and recited his tale of woe. The Mahavratin offered to restore Devadatta’s fortunes if the gambler would assist him in becoming a Vidyadhara. The following day the Mahavratin came and sat under a banyan tree in a corner of the cremation ground. That night he did puja, offered ric$ boiled in milk, and scattered food offerings in the four quarters. He told, his new assistant to perform the same worship every day in the same spot while saying: ‘O Vidyutprabha, you should accept this puja.'m Eventually their efforts were rewarded with success.In Kathasaritsagara v. 2. 81 Somadeva mentions a ‘Mahavratin Kapalin’ who wears matted hair, smears himself with white ashes, and has a half moon like Siva’s drawn on his forehead. In yet another story (iii. 5. 74-77) a group of spies in Varanasi disguise themselves as ascetics who ‘observed the Kapalika vow.’ One of them assumes the role of teacher while the others become his disciples. These disciples then go about saying : ‘This teacher knows the present, past and future.’ And they make sure that any predic­tions their teacher makes, come true. By this infallible method the spy-ascetic quickly wins the notice and confidence of the king.The Jain legend of Prince Brahmadatta is found in Devendra Gam’s eleventh century commentary on the Uttarddhyayana194 and in Hemacandra’s (1088-1172) Trisastisalakapuru$acaritra.195 At one point in this story, the prince’s friend Varadhanu is forced1WV. 3. 207.

When she obtains her 108th skull she is to 'fulfill her purpose.’197 Vinaya- candra’s (c. 1300) Mallinaiha-caritra tells how Prince Ratnacandra finds a Kapalika ‘eagerly dancing with a sharp sword’ in front of a young woman who is tied to a post. The prince rescues her and kills the ascetic.198 The story of King Devapala in the Kathakosa, a collection of uncertain date, mentions a Kapalika who carries a bundle of wood on his head. When the queen sees him, she recog­nises him as her husband from a former life. She had worshipped the Jina and become a queen. He had refused to do so and attained the ‘miserable condition’ of a Kapalika.199 In Jambhaladatta's version of the Vetalapaficavifisati,200 written sometime before 1500, the ascetic whom King Vikramakesarin agrees to assist is called a Kapalika. The king is requested to carry an unmutilated dead man from a tree on the bank of a river to the cremation ground where the Kapalika is to perform a magic rite. ‘When you have come,’ the Kapalika tells him, ‘then here in a circle [mandala] furnished with the various instruments of worship, when I have washed the corpse and worshipped the gods and muttered a great incantation [mahamantra], I shall attain magic power [siddhi\\.'20i The ascetic’s actual aim is'to sacrifice the king, but the dead man, really a Vetala, warns the king and the Kapalika is killed instead.Many references to these ascetics take the form of poetic meta­phors or similes.

This is the legend of the kings VikramSditya- Har§a, Pravarasena II and Matfgupta.207 Pravarasena, son of Toramana and heir to the throne of Kashmir, went on a lengthy pilgrimage during which the throne fell vacant. King Vikramaditya- Har§a, who was apparently overlord of the region, sent his court poet Matfgupta to fill the post. Pravarasena, still on pilgrimage, learned of this usurpation and sought to gain the kingship himself. When he arrived at Sriparvata, ‘a saint [Siddha] called Asvapada, who appeared in the guise of a Pasupata ascetic, offered him food prepared from roots.’208 Asvapada said that the prince had been his attendant in a former life and that on a certain occasion the ascetic had offered his servant a boon. Pravarasena had asked for a kingdom. Siva had then appeared and promised to fulfill this wish in another life. After imparting this information, Asvapada disappeared.

When Jayanta complained that he was too ex­hausted from travelling to start on the great journey back to Kashmir, Asvapada said : Then bathe to-day, since I who am of the Kapalin sect, have touched you who are a Brahman.'209 Asvapada then threw him into a pond. When Jayanta opened his eyes he was standing near Pravarasena’s palace. The letter was quickly delivered. It instructed the king to kgo and betake yourself to Siva’s abode.’210 With a great burst of light the king rose into the heavens.There has been much speculation about the identity of these three kings. It can be safely said only that they lived sometime between the fifth and eighth centuries. The legend about them is apocryphal in any case. From our point of view the important fact is that a.Pasupata ascetic who lives at Sriparvata calls himself a member of the Kapalin sect. Kalhana’s apparent identification of the two sects is undoubtedly a mistake, but it is an understandable one since Sriparvata is associated both with the Pasupatas, through their offshoot the Kalamukhas, and with the Kapalikas. In the time of the three kings, the site was probably controlled by the Kapalikas. In Kalhana’s time it was a Kalamukha center. This might be the source of his confusion.The idea of contact with Kapalikas causing pollution recurs in several sources. In view of their strange habits, this is not surprising. K$emendra (c. 1050-75), the Kashmiri polymath, includes a restriction against drinking with Kapalikas in an attack against the,tantric gurus of the Kali-yuga : The gurus claim that mukti (is obtained) by drinking (wine) in one vessel with artisans—such as washermen, weavers, leather makers, and Kapalikas—during cakra-puja,2n by having a feast of unhesitating sexual pleasure, and by (generally leading) a festive life.'212 It is not clear why209Trans.

In case of contact with Kapalikas, restraint of the breath (prandyama) is also prescribed.214 The Usana- samhitd includes Kapalikas in a list of heretics with whom food should not be eaten 215Two fairly late works, the Barhaspaii-sutra and Gunaratna’s fourteenth centpry commentary on Haribhadra’s Saddarsana- samuccaya, stress the hedonistic element of the Kapalika faith. Gunaratna claims that tjie Kapalikas are identical with the Nastikas or Lokayatikas who enjoy wine, meat and illicit intercourse.216 The Barhaspati-sutra distinguishes Kapalikas from Lokayatikas but seconds Gunaratna’s charge of dissoluteness.217A fourteenth century Tamil work, the Sivaprakasam of Umapati, contains a brief disquisition on seven sects which hold that mukti is the removal of mala (impurity). These include the Pasupata, the Mahavratin and the Kapalika.218 Here Mahavratin probably denotes the Kalamukhas. Another Tamil work, the Tiruvorriyur Puranam. seems to refer to Mahavratins in this sense.219 The twelfth century Tamil author Sekkilar describes a Mahavratin ascetic who might be either a Kapalika or a Kalamukha. This ascetic is Siva himself in disguise. Three lines of ashes are drawn across his forehead; his head is shaved except for a tuft tied up213vi. 3, cited by Handiqui, p. 356 (my translation).

Two of the Kapalin songs are addressed to the PombI (Washerwoman) who, in symbolic terms, is the goddess Nairatmya (Essencelessness) and Buddhist counterpart to the Hindu Kula-kundalini Sakti.222 In the form of a Kapalin yogin, Kanha becomes the lover or husband of the Dombl :Outside the city, O Dombl, is thy cottage; thou goest just touching the Brahmins and the shaven-headed (and never reveal [sic] thyself to them). O Dombi, J shall keep company with thee and it is for this purpose that I have become a naked Kapall without aversions. .. . Thou art the Dombl and I am the Kapall, for thee have I put on a garland of bones. The Dombl destroys the lake and eats up the lotus- stalk. I shall kill thee, Dombl, and take thy life.223As the earthly Dombl should not be touched by the orthodox, so the divine Dombl is inaccessible to them. She lives outside the ‘city’ (the world of the senses). Unless she is killed (i.e. controlled) she spoils the lake (the body) and eats the lotus stalk (the bodhicitia or mind of enlightenment).224 The second song expresses similar sentiments :Of what nature is, O Dombl, thy cleverness?—the aristocrats are outside thee and the Kapalis are within . . .

Since there is reason to believe that the Kapalika and Kalamukha Mahavratas were different vows, we* will discuss them separately beginning with the former.A large number of sources connect the Kapalikas with the Mahavrata. Jagaddhara, a commentator on MalatUMadhava, explains Kapalika-vrdta or Kapala-vrata as Mahavrata.1 Similarly, Candapala, a commentator on Trivikrama-bhatta's Nalacampu (p. 164), equates Kapalikas and Mahavratikas. A Saivite ascetic in Somadeva’s Kathasaritsagara v. 2. 81 is called a Kapalin Maha­vratin. Kslrasvamin (eleventh century), in his commentary on the Amarakosa, lists together Kapalin, Mahavratin, Somasiddhantin, and Tantrika.2 A Mahavrata-Kapalika named Mahavrata, who follows the ‘heretical Mahdvrata-siddhantaappears in Gokulana- tha's Amrtodaya (c. 1700).3 As we have seen,4 some of the Puranas and a few other sources contain lists of sects in which the Kapalikas (or Kalamukhas) are replaced by Mahavrata-dharas or Maha- vratins. In one or two of these sources, however, Mahavratins are listed as distinct from both Kapalikas and Kalamukhas. In two plays, Mattavilasa and Candakausika, a Kapalika character refers to Siva’s performance of this vow.5 In the latter work the Kapalika himself is called a Mahavrata-carin as well.6 We have already discussed the seventh century Calukya grant from Nasik District, which registers a donation to the Mahavratin priests of a Kapales-*Ed.

It is asso­ciated with the mysterious brotherhood, the Vratyas, whom Hauer saw as precursors of the yogins,7 and it incorporates a number of features which seem appropriate for a Kapalika ceremony, such as ritual reviling, obscene dialogue and sexual intercourse.8 There is little likelihood, however, that this ritual would have been resurrected several hundred years after it had to all intents and purposes died out and after its original religious and social context had disappeared. Furthermore, there is another Mahavrata which may be identified with some certainty as the Great Vow of the Kapalikas. This is the chief penance prescribed for the removal of the sin of (accidently) killing a Brahmana.The rules for this penance, with several variations, are found in most of the major law books, but it is called the Mahavrata in only one of them, the Visnu-smrti. This work says :1. Let a man make a hut of leaves in a forest and dwell in it;2. And let him bathe (and perform his prayers) three times a day;3.

The commentators disagree about whether or not he should use the skull in his hand as a begging bowl.11 In the Apastambiya Dharmasutra, however, a person who has killed a learned Brahmana (Bhrunahan) is required to ‘take a human skull for his drinking-vessel.’12 One who kills an ordinary Brahmana, on the other hand, is merely instructed to carry a shallow metal or clay vessel.13 Several works require the penitent to carry a skull on his staff, and this skull is generally identified as the skull of the person Slain.14 Some works also require the carrying of a khat- vdhga,15 the staff most often associated with the Kapalikas. In his comments on Apastambiya Dharmasutra i. 29. 1, Haradatta (c. twelfth century) in fact says : ‘the word khatvahga is well known in the Kapalika-tantra.’16 Literally, khatvahga means ‘limb of a bedstead,’ apparently on account of its shape. Vijnanesvara’s Mitdksara on Yajnavalkya iii. 243 describes it as a ‘banner made of a skull mounted on a stick (darida).'A few of the law books specify the clothes the penitent must wear. Apastamba says that a Bhrunahan ‘shall put on the skin of a dog or of an ass, with the hair turned outside.’17 Baudhayana (ii. 1. 3) prescribes the hide of an ass alone. For an ordinary Brah- mahan Apastamba (i. 24. 11) requires a plain hempen loincloth reaching from the navel to the knees.Because he is polluted by his crime, the sinner must live in a hut in the forest and avoid entering a village except to beg.

Some of these alternative penances end in almost certain death and others merely require the spending of large amounts of money for Vedic sacrifices. One of them, the chief penance prescribed for a Bhrunahan in the Vasistha Dharmasutra, seems to have tantric overtones. The guilty person is instructed to build a fire and offer in it eight oblations cut from his own body : hair, skin, blood, flesh, sinews, fat, bones, and marrow. The successive oblations are offered to Death with the words 4I offer my hair to Death, I feed Death with my hair’ and so forth.21 At the least, this penance requires self-mutilation, and excessive diligence could easily cause death. The rite is reminiscent both of the grisly oblations that the Kapalika in the Prabodhacandrodaya claims to offer to BKairava and of the sale of flesh cut from their own bodies by the Mahavratikas of the Cancjamarl temple in Somadeva’s Yasastilaka.22The Mahavrata penance of the Visnu-smrti and other law books18Trans.

These ascetics lived in the forest, wore loincloths or animal skins, carried a khatváñga and a skull bowl, obtained their food by begging, and polluted those with whom they came into contact. Given the pervasive tantric motif of the identity or con­junction of opposites,23 the relation between the penance of the law books and the vow of the Kápalikas is not inexplicable. The Kápalikas, we suggest, adopted this vow precisely because it was the penance for the most heinous of all crimes, the killing of a Bráhmana. They were at the same time the holiest of all ascetics and the lowest of all criminals. As in the case of the dombi (and the Kápálin) of Kánhapáda’s songs, that which is lowest in the realm of appearance becomes a symbol for the highest in the realm of the spirit. Furthermore, if the Kápálikas were in reality already guiltless, the performance of this penance would result in an unprecedented accumulation of religious merit and hence of magical power (siddhi).The paradoxical identity of Kápálika saint and Brahmahan sinner finds its divine archetype in the curious myth of the beheading of the god Brahmá by Siva. This also introduces the essential ingredient of Saivism which is lacking in the law book penance. The myth occurs in a number of the major Puránas, but their accounts vary considerably. We will summarise the Matsya Purána version since it seems to preserve most of the basic features of the story 24 One day Siva is asked by Párvatí why he never leavesthe Avimukta k$etra in Varanasi, where the Kapálamocana(Setting Free of the Skull) tirtha is located. Siva replies (clxxxiii. 84-87) :Formerly, O Varárohá, there was an excellent fifth head of Brahmá. It arose, O Suároni, having the same lustre as gold. When that flaming fifth head of the great-souled one was produced, O Devi, he said (to me): ‘I know (the circumstances of) your birth.’ Then, filled with anger and my eyes inflamed, I cut off* his (fifth) head with the tip ofthe nail of my left thumb. Brahmá (then) said : ‘Whenyou cut off the head of me who is guiltless, you will become a Kapálin endowed with a curse.

The head magically attaches itself to his body, and he travels with it to the Himalayas to ask Narayana (Vi§nu) for alms. Narayana lacerates his own side with the tip of his nail. A great flood of blood streams out and spreads over fifty yojanas. This great flood flows for a thousand divine years, but it cannot fill the skull. Narayana asks Siva about the origin of this amazing skull, and Siva tells him the story of the beheading and its aftermath. Siva is then instructed to go to ‘his own place’ where the skull ‘will establish itself.’ Siva travels to many famous tirthas but the skull does not ‘establish itself until he visits ‘the great resting place Avimukta’ and there his curse finally departs. Siva concludes his tale :Through the grace of Vi§nu, O SuSroni, the skull was there broken in thousands (of pieces). As many pieces were produced as riches are obtained in a dream. This sacred field (ksetra) I made the tirtha which removes (the sin of) Brahmahatya. It is renowned on earth, O Devi, as the Kapalamocana of the gods .. . Whoever abandons his body while abiding there will merge with me.Every ritual has a divine model or archetype, and the penance Siva performs is the model of the Mahavrata penance for the killing of a Brahmana.

The law books are in general much older than the Puranas, but both classes of works are based on earlier sources which are now lost. The killing of a Brahmana (Brahmahatyd) is already regarded as the worst of all sins in the Brahmanas,27 but these works do not refer to the expiatory penance. The essential features of the §iva-Brahma myth are found, however, in the story of Rama Raghava and the sage Mahodara from the Salyaparvan of the Mahabharata.2* According to this story Rama once fought and beheaded a wicked Raksasa. The demon’s head attached itself to the thigh of the sage Mahodara. The sage wandered from tirtha to tirtha trying to rid himself of this burden, but he had no success until he bathed at the Ausanasa tirtha on the Sarasvatl River. This place, named after the sage Usanas or Sukracarya, washed away the skull and thereafter became known as Kapala- mocana.29There can be little doubt that the two myths are related. Even the name, if not the location, of the sacred tirtha is the same. The Mahabharata legend, however, contains no suggestion of Brahmahatya. The Raksasa’s skull attaches itself to Mahodara because it is itself demonic, not because of the guilt of beheading. We suggest the following historical development. The Rama- Mahodara story, or some similar prototype,30 was borrowed to provide the basis of the myth of the beheading of Brahma, and this myth was then used to give divine sanction or precedent to the already existing legal prescription against killing a Brahmana.The relative priority of the Saivite myth and the Kapalika26Trans.

Did the Kapalikas invent the myth in order to provide a divine model for their ascetic obser­vance, or did they model the observance on the myth? The evidence is inconclusive. The sources in which the myth first appears, the Puranas, also mention human Kapalikas, and there are no references to the ascetics significantly earlier than these works. In- some respects this question is a needless one. Since both the penance for killing a Brahmana and the association of Siva, the god of death and destruction, with skulls undoubtedly antedated the Siva-Kapalin myth, Saivite ascetics who observed the Mahavrata might also have antedated it. Whether or not such ascetics existed and whether or not they themselves invented this myth, it is certain that the later Kapalikas adopted it as their divine archetype.The ultimate aim of the Kapalika observance was a mystical identification or communion with Siva. Through their imitative repetition of Siva’s performance of the Mahavrata, the ascetics became ritually ‘homologised’ with the god and partook of, or were granted, some of his divine attributes, especially the eight magical powers (siddhis)}{An important aspect of this ritual communion with Siva-Kapalin seems to have been the identification of the devotee’s begging skull with the skull of Brahma. As their name indicates, this skull bowl was the Kapalika’s trademark. In the Prabodhacandrodaya (act III, vss. 12-13), the Kapalika describes himself as one who ‘eats from a human skull’ and says that 'the conclusion of our fast (is accomplished) by drinking liquor distributed in the skull of a Brahman (Brahma-kapala)! The Kapalika in Yasahpala’s Moha- rajapardjaya (act IV, vs. 23) states : ‘Nara-kapalin declares that he who invariably eats human flesh in the skull of a noble man (uttama- purusa) obtains the position of Siva (Siva-sthana).’ Ugra-Bhairava, the Kapalika opponent of Sarpkaracarya, claims that Girisa (Siva) had told him that he would attain the ultimate goal of men if he would ‘sacrifice in the sacrificial fire either the head of an ominscient sage or the head'Df a king.’32 In the Mattavilasa, the Kapalin’s wench laments that their lost sku(l ‘was as splendid as the skull of the Lotus-throned God,’ another allusion to the Siva- Brahma myth.33 We have noted that some of the law books specify31The psychology of this type of ritual identification with gods and heroes is well analyzed by M. Eliade in his Cosmos and History (chaps, i and ii).32Madhavacarya, £amkara-digvijaya xi. 11.33Trans. Barnett, BSO S, V, 712-13.

This is what Siva does with the skull of Brahma. It is unnecessary and unlikely that the Kapalika Maha­vratin first killed a Brahmana in order to obtain a skull bowl, but not any old skull, it seems, would suffice. It had to be the skull of a noble man (uttama-purusa-kapala) or the skull of a Brahman (Brahma-kapdla). If our hypothesis about the ascetics' identification with §iva-Kapalin is correct, the term Brahma-kapala would equally imply the skull of the god Brahma.There remains one other Mahavrata we have yet to discuss. According to Patanjali’s Yogasutra ii. 30-31, when the five yamas (restraints) of ahimsd (non-injury), satya (truthfulness), asteya (non-theft), brahmacarya (chastity and restraint of the senses), and aparigraha (non-acceptance of more than is necessary for bodily subsistence) are practised without exception being made for status, place, time, or occasion, the observance is known as the Mahavrata.34 Its performance is incumbent on yogins at all stages.35 This Mahavrata, we believe, is the Mahavrata of the Kalamukhas. Although the evidence to support this contention is rather slim, there is virtually no reason to connect the Kala­mukhas with the Mahavrata of the Brahmanas or the Mahavrata of the Visnu-smrti.36 On the other hand, the Kalamukhas of the Ko<Jiya-matha in Belagave (Shimoga District, Mysore) are said to study the Patanjala and other Yogasastras,37 and most Kala- mukha inscriptions stress the yogic attainments and virtues of these ascetics. Furthermore, the texts of the Pasupatas, the sect most closely related to the Kalamukhas, lay particular emphasis on the performance of the five yamas. Kaundinya’s commentary on the Pdsupata-sutra attributed to the Pasupata-Kalamukha saint Lakulisa devotes no less than nineteen pages to praise ofascetic Bhairavananda, who might be a Kapalika (see above, p. 49). praises the goddess Kali, who drinks the blood of demons ‘from a goblet made of the skull of Parame$thin [Brahma].’ (Trans.

When Somasiddhanta fell, his comrades Kapalika, Nilalohita, Mahabhairava, Bhuta- damara, and Umamah^svara all fled the field.

The sexual implications of the derivation sa-Uma are particularly suitable for the god of the Kápálikas.A few inscriptions briefly mention the Somasiddhánta doctrine but do not contain any significant information about it. A priest entitled Caturánana-pantfita, who headed the Tiruvorriyúr matha (Chingleput District, Madras) in a .d . 1171-72, is described as a contemporary of a Somasiddhantin named Vágíša Bhat{a.49 The priests of the Tiruvojcriyurwtf//za were Mahavratins.49 Another allusion to the Somasiddhanta doctrine is found in an inscription from Mčvuotfi in Dharwar District dated a .d . 897.50 As we have seen,51 Somakhadtfuka ascetics of the congregation of Mun<Ja- špnkhalika Pášupatácárya are named as donees in a seventh century grant from Nepal.KftpiUka BhaktiWhile we possess no actual Kápálika text, we can attempt to reconstruct the basic doctrines and attitudes of the sect from the many references we have cited. The keystone of the Kápálika faith was bhakti, personal devotion to a personal god. This god was usually identified as Šiva in his terrific Bhairava incarnation. The rituals into which the Kápálika’s bhakti was channeled were either propitiatory, imitative or a combination of both. The aim of these rituals was a mystical communion of the worshipper and his god. The rewards of this communion were twofold. On the mundane plain the devotee gained suprahuman magical powers (siddhis) while on the eschatological plain he attained final libera­tion from transmigratory existence (mukti) and dwelt in a heaven of perpetual sexual bliss.The statements of Bodholbana-nityánanda and his Kápálika followers in Anandagiri’s Šamkara-vijaya form the locus classicus,47See ibid., p. 131.

He who is the cause of destruction is also the cause of preservation and creation ... All the gods, each endowed with a particular authority, are merely portions of him. They carry the command of Bhairava on their heads, and their powers, which attend on his word, are each directed to a particular duty.52Parts of this passage are ambiguous but its general purport is clear. The word Karman, for instance, may imply either ‘religious ritual and good works’ or ‘the effects of past good and bad deeds’, although the latter interpretation is clearly the more plausible one. The chief object of the passage is to proclaim Bhairava to be the creator, preserver, and destroyer of the universe and lord of all the gods. The epithet ‘world-creator’ (jagat-kartr) suggests the dualistic distinction between the material and instrumental causes of the universe which Ramanuja and other Brahma-sutra commentators attribute to the Kapalikas and other worshippers of PaSupati. The demotion of the many gods of the Hindu pantheon to the position of portions (amsas) of one primary god is a concept frequently found in bhakti literature, particularly the Puranas, and is a form of what has been called henotheism, a kind of halfway house between polytheism and monotheism.Bodholbana-nityananda and his followers continue with an elaboration of their doctrine.

The eighth, Sarphara-Bhairava, is Bhairava himself. The remaining gods are merely his ‘portions' and are further distinguished as creation-makers (srstikartrs), preservation- makers (sthitikartrs) and destruction-makers (samharakartrs). Taken all together, the creation-makers are his Rudra (,sic for Ruru-Brahma) portions, the preservation-makers his Asitanga (Vi$nu) portions, and the destruction-makers his Krodha (Rudra) portions. The Kapalikas conclude : ‘Thus having caused the creation of the world etc., and afterwards the dissolution, he makes a contraction of seven of his forms and one eternal Sarphara-Bhairava remains who is the paramdtman,’54This omnipotent deity demands both propitiation and imitation from his devotees. In this respect the Kapalika faith differs from other thcistic religions only in the procedures adopted. Ritual propitiation is sacrifice. Externally this usually takes the form of human or animal sacrifice. To be acceptable to the deity, the victim must be of auspicious color and size, unpolluted, and, in the case of humans, morally pure. At the same time, however, he is normally regarded as a scapegoat, the repository of the trans­gressions of the sacrificers. The Kapalikas, if their critics are to be believed, specialised in human sacrifice.As we have seen, allusions to Kapalikas performing human sacrifices, making offerings of human flesh, or doing puja with the aid of corpses are numerous. In Malatl-Madhava (act V. vs. 25) the faultless heroine is led forward wearing the marks of a sacrificial victim. The heartless Kapalika Aghoraghanta raises his weapon and invokes Camunda : ‘O divine Camunda, the offering (puja) placed before you was promised at the beginning of the performance of incantations. May you (now) receive it.' More often the god the Kapalikas invoke is Bhairava. At the end of our fast, says the Kapalika in Prabodhacandrodaya (act III, vs. 13): ‘Mahabhairava should be worshipped with offerings of awe-inspiring human sacrifices from whose severed throats blood flows in torrents.' To this god, he adds, we offer oblations of ‘human flesh mixed with brains, entrails, and marrow.' Sarpkaracarya's Kapalika opponent Krakaca puts the matter more forcefully : i f he (Kapalin-53Another word for Candra (the moon) is Soma.

The purpose of the rite was to appease and gratify a wrathful and blood-thirsty deity. The idea of the victim as a scapegoat is less explicit but is inherent, iq any case, in the very concept of sacrificial propitiation.Human sacrifice existed in India, as in most parts of the ancient world, from a very early date. According to a legend which first appears in the Aitareya Bráhmana, the Ik^váku king Hariácandra volunteered to sacrifice his first-born son to the god Varuna.56 The purusamedha (man-sacrifice) is described iij ^a number of Bráhmanas but had become merely symbolic by the time of the Éatapatha Bráhhtana,57 Human sacrifices were given a new lease on life, as it were, with the emergence of tantric cults in the early mediaeval period. In some regions, particularly Bengal and Assam, the practice became fairly common. The sixteenth century Koch king, Nar Náráyan, is said to have sacrificed about 150 men at a single ceremony.58 A combination of British suppression and Hindu reform virtually eliminated the practice by the early nine­teenth century, but cases of alleged human sacrifice are still reported sporadically.59The important Sákta work, the Káliká-Purána, devotes an entire55Madhavacarya, xi. 11.56vii. 13-18, cited by E.A.

By human flesh the goddess KamakhyS’s consort Bhairava .. . remains pleased three thousand years. Blood consecrated immediately becomes abrosia and since the head and flesh are gratifying, therefore should the head and flesh be offered at the worship of the goddess. The wise should add the flesh free from hair, among food offerings 61Before executing his victim, the sacrificer says to him: Thou, by gratifying Cantfika, destroyest all evil incidents to the giver. Thou, a victim who appearest as a sacrifice meet for the Vai§navl, hast my salutations.’62 The scapegoat aspect of the sacrificial propitiation -of Bhairava and Durga is here made more explicit.The personal counterpart to animal and human sacrifice is self-sacrifice. This concept subsumes a wide range of activities from self-immolation or suicide to self-mutilation and from physical penances to simple exercises of mental discipline. The chief penance performed by the Kapalikas was, of course, the Mahavrata. There is also some evidence that they occasionally practised various forms of self-mutilation such as cutting flesh from their own bodies for sacrificial oblations.63 The Kapalika Ugra-Bhairava claims to have gratified Ugra (Siva) 'with arduous and severe penances for a full one-hundred years.’64 The Kapalika in.Candakausika (act IV, vs. 26) claims to subsist on unrequested alms and to have control over the five senses.

Several references, albeit sarcastic ones, to Kapalin tapas also appear in Mattavilasa^5 Although the above allusions to Kapalika asceticism and Yoga are few and not very detailed, it is evident that the authors were aware that the Kapalikas were not simple hedonists.In addition to propitiating Bhairava through various kinds of sacrifice, the Kapalikas imitated the god by ritual reenactment of his mythological exploits. To a large extent the paths of propitiation and imitation overlap. The Mahavrata, for instance, is both a propitiatory penance and a reenactment of the penance of Siva. In some rituals, however, the idea of propitiation is absent or insignificant. Most of these are communion rituals in which the worshipper is united with divinity through food, drink, sex, or mental ecstasy. These rituals are normally preceded by propitiatory ones which give the devotee preparatory purification. The Kapalika in Prabodhacandrodaya does not drink until he has fasted; Ugra- Bhairava gratifies Ugra with severe penances for one-hundred years in order to go to Kailasa with this body to sport with Isa.’Kapalika rituals of food and drink are referred to in a number of sources.66 In Yasahpala’s Moharajaparajaya the Kapalika says that one obtains Siva-sthana by eating human flesh in the skull of a noble man. The lost skull bowl of Mahendravarman’s Kapalin was full of roast meat. Gunaratna and the Barhaspati-sutra claim that the Kapalikas are sybaritic Nastika materialists addicted to wine, meat and illicit intercourse. Saipkara’s opponent Krakaca fills his skull bowl with surd through his power of meditation. After drinking half of it, he invokes the god Bhairava. Unmatta- Bhairava, another of Saipkar^’s Kapalika opponents, proudly declares that his father and gradfather were liquor makers and espouses a thoroughly hedonistic code of conduct. In Mattavilasa the Kapalin similarly advocates wine and women as the road to salvation recommended by Siva, and the Kapalika in Prabodha­candrodaya describes wine as the ‘remedy against (transmigratory) existence prescribed by Bhairava.’ In Anandarayamakhin’s Vidya- parinayana (act IV, after vs. 32) the Kapalika Somasiddhanta almost apologetically defends his use of wine and meat by main­taining that they are pxescribed in the Bhairavagamas: ‘We aret65Mahendravarman, after vss. 6 and 10 and vs. 21.MSee above, chap. ii."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"KÂPÂLIKA CULT AND DOCTRINE89counted among heretics through divergence from the Veda by addiction to wine (madhu), meat (mamsa), etc., which are prohi­bited in the Vedas, (but in fact we hold) the doctrine of the authori- tativeness of the Veda with compliance to the Bhairavagamas.'Since the Kapalikas were a tantric Saivite sect, their addiction to meat and wine, as well as sex, should be associated with the five Ma-sounds (pancamakara) of tantric tradition and not with hedonistic materialism. The passage from Vidyaparinayana men­tioning madhu and' mamsa tends to confirm this association. In Anandagiri’s Samkara-vtjaya the Kapalika Bodholbana declares (chap. xxiii) that true and fearless sages are ‘all always dependent on knowledge (bodha) produced from substances (d r a v y aThese 'substarlces’ probably represent the five Ma-sounds since the terms pahcadravya and pancamakara (also pahcatattva) are synonymous in tantric texts. The context of Bodholbana’s statement alsc t*:nds to support this interpretation.In tantric practice the partaking of wine and meat has both a hedonistic and eucharistic aspect but is in no way connected with materialism. Hedonistically, the first four of the five Ma-sounds —wine, meat, fish, and grain (mudra) — are regarded as aphrodisiac (uttejaka) preparatives to the final maithuna or sexual union between the initiated adept and his female partner. These four ingredients do not in fact possess aphrodisiac qualities although wine, of course, may help to release inhibitions. A. Bharati points out that the only substance used in tantric sddhana which has any such qualities is vijaya or Indian hemp (Cannabis IndicaJ.67 This is taken about an hour and a half before the five Ma-sounds.The eucharistic significance of the four preliminary ingredu nts is variously explained in tantric sources. Kularnava-tantra v. 79-80 says : 'Wine (surd) is Sakti; the meat is Siva'; the enjoyer of those is Bhairava himself. The bliss sprung from the union of those two (?=§iva and Sakti) is called moksa. This bliss, which is the form (rupa) of Brahman, is established in the body (of the worshipper). The wine makes it manifest. For that reason the yogins drink.’ The reformist Mahdnirvana-tantra states: 'Wine [surd] is Tara Herself in liquid form, Who is the Saviour of beings, the Mother of Enjoyment and Liberation.’68 In the Kaulavalinirnaya the goddess is worshipped as the surd which was churned from the milk-6777ie Tantric Tradition, p. 252.^Trans.

From their union come forth Brahma, Vi§nu, and Siva. Therefore I drink thee with my total personality, o goddess of liquor.’69 Bharati’s tantric informants variously inter­preted the term fcw/a-nectar (kuldmrta) as 'the spiritual essence of the five makaras ..., the cosmic residuum caused by Siva’s and Sakti’s eternal copulation’; 'the liquid which emerges from the contact of Siva and Sakti’; and the rajas (menstrual blood) of the goddess.70 Saktisangama-tantra ii. 32. 25 says that the wine 'is produced from the rasa of Sakti.’ This statement seems to have similar sexual implications although it appears in the context of a list of substitutes (pratinidhi) suitable for dak?inacara worship.All of the symbolic equations just cited clearly indicate the presence of an element of totemic communion in the ritual con­sumption of the first four Ma-sounds. This alimentary communion is based on the archaic maxim that we are what we t2X—man ist was er isst. The identification of the ritual foods with the body or body products of Siva and Sakti confers on the communicant consubstantiality with them. He becomes the god and shares various divine attributes such as immortality and magical powers. Before discussing these supernatural benefits, however, we must examine the central ritual of tantric communion, sexual intercourse.Since some of our sources for the Kapalikas are quite explicit about the significance of this ritual, it is not necessary to rely on tantric works except for confirmation. The archetypal basis of the ritual is delineated most succinctly in the traditional etymology for the term Somasiddhanta—the doctrine of Soma (Siva) united with Uma (Umayd sahitah Somas tasya siddhantah) .71 The human participants of the ritual mentally identify themselves with Siva and Sakti respectively. In the bliss of sexual union the human pair realize the divine bliss of Siva and Sakti. Final salvation (mukti), on this view, is perpetual orgasm, not merely extinction of the cycle of rebirth.When asked about his conception of mok$af the Kapalika in Prabodhacandrodaya replies (act III, vs. 16) :69Trans. by Bharati in The Tantric Tradition, p. 259.™lbid., pp. 259-60.1]Prakasaf!ka to Kf§nami£ra’s Prabodhacandrodaya, ed.

The attainment of that (bliss) at death is moksa. This is the ultimate truth.’72 The Kapalika Bodholbana-nityananda praises the fearless sages who are ‘always dependent on the knowledge produced from substances (dravya), whose hearts are gratified by the embrace of Kapalika saktis, who are addicted to drinking the excellent nectar arising from sexual union, ... and who (declare that) Bhairava is the abode (pada) in death.’73 The drinking of the nectar of sexual union is probably a reference to the yogic exercise of reabsorbing with the penis the seminal fluid discharged in coitus. The rationale for this practice, called the vajrolimudra, is explained in the Hathayogapradipika: ‘Having drawn up his own discharged bindu [the Yogi] can preserve (it) ... By the loss of bindu (comes) death, from its retention, life.’74 The same idea lies behind the allied practice of coitus reservatus recommended especially in Buddhist Vajrayana texts. Breath (prana), thought (citta), and semen (bindu)— the three jewels—must be simulta­neously ‘immobilised’ in an act which yields the perfect state of oneness in duality.75 The belief that the loss of semen causes the destruction of mental and spiritual as well as physical potency is widespread even in modern industrial societies.

His penances, spells, and magic rituals gave him the power to perform supernatural deeds with or without the assistance of the gods. The development of the doctrine and practices of Yoga led to a systematic cultivation and enumeration of the priest- magician’s magical powers.80 In the Yogasutra of Patanjali, generally dated sometime between 200 B.C. and a .d . 300,81 a considerable number of magical powers are said to stem from the practice of samyama.*2 The powers include the ability to know present, past and future, to become invisible, to become strong as an elephant, to enter another’s body, to walk on water or thorns, to hear inaudible sounds, and to fly through the air. Elsewhere in the Yogasutra Patafijali states that the siddhis may be obtained by any of five methods: birth, drugs, mantras, penance, and samadhi. Ydjnavalkya-smrti iii. 202-203, a work slightly later than or contemporary with the Yogasutra, says that supra-normal powers of hearing, seeing, remembering, becoming invisible, abandoning one’s body, and entering another’s body are the mark of Yoga-siddhi. The Rdjamartanda commentary on Patanjali by King Bhoja (early eleventh century) contains a list of eight great siddhis ( mahasiadhis ) which can be won by Yoga: (1) animan, the power of becoming small; (2) laghiman, the power of levitation; (3) gariman, the power of becoming heavy; (4) mahiman, the power of becoming limitlessly large; (5) isitva, control over body and mind; (6)prakamya, irresistible will; (7) vasitva, control over the five elements; and (8) kamavasayitva, fulfilment of desires.83 Similar lists are found in the Yogabhasya of Vyasa (seventh to eighth centuries), the tantric Prapahcasara, and other works.84In spite of the abundant textual references to various siddhis in classical Yoga texts, many modern Indian scholars, and like- minded western ones as well, have seized on a single sutra of Patanjali (iii. 37) to prove that magical powers were regarded as80Perhaps the oldest mention of the siddhis is in the Apastambiya Dharmasutra ii. 9. 23. 6-7.«•See Kane, HDS, V, Part II, 1395-99 and Eliade, Yoga . . pp. 370-72.82Yogasutra iii. 16-50.

Other references to the magical powers of Kápalika ascetics appear in the Kathdsaritsagara stories of Madana- mañjari, Candrasvámin, Devadatta, and the Kápálika spy.90 In Jambhaladatta's Vetálapañcavimsati (pp. 10-11) the Kápálika mutters a great incantation (mahamantra) in order to obtain siddhi. The Kápálin-Pásupata Asvapáda in Kalhana’s Rájatarañ- gini displays the ability to remember his past lives and to magically transport his disciple to Kashmir.91Kr§namisra's Prabodhacandrodaya (act III, vs. 22) contains a particularly interesting allusion to the siddhis of the Kápálikas.85Even as objective a writer as Eliade partially succumbs to this view (Yoga pp. 88-90).

The name Kálámukha, sometimes spelt Kálamukha, may refer to a practice of marking their foreheads with a black streak.1 Judging from the large number of epigraphs recording donations to Kálámukha temples and mathas, these ascetics must have wielded considerable influence in the region. Unfortunately few indications of their beliefs and ritual survive apart from the information which can be gleaned from these epigraphs. They reveal the existence of at least two major divisions of the Kálámukha order—the Éakti-pari§ad and the Simha-parisad. Records of the latter division have been found over a wide area including various parts of Andhra Pradesh and Mysore. The former division seems to have been limited mostly to the Dharwar and Shimoga Districts of Mysore. Nonetheless, the number of extant §akti-pari§ad epigraphs is greater and they have been found at a larger number of sites. Moreover, they are generally of greater length and contain more religious information. Barring historical accident, it must be assumed that the §akti-pari$ad was the more important of the two groups.Approximately sixty-five inscriptions from eighteen §akti-pari$ad temples have been found and published. Its control over two of the temples is doubtful, however, and a few of the inscriptions, though found in Kálámukha temples, cíate from a period either before or after Kálámukha occupation. Four separate subdivisions of the áakti-parisad are distinguished, and it may be assumed that others existed whose names have not survived. The most prominent division was centred in the Kedáresvara temple at Belagáve in Shimoga District.2 The ascetics styled themselves as•T.A.G.

No less than fifty of the sixty-five epigraphs refer to this line of ascetics. About twenty-two of the records are located at the Kedá- resvara temple itself. The rest are at five other temples in the region. The same ascetics seem to have been in charge of all six temples. At two of them, however, the connection with the Sakti-parisad is based merely on the correspondence of ascetics’ names and dates.The records are slightly inconsistent about the hierarchy of the three parts of the organisation. The Kedaresvara epigraphs of 1094 and 11033 and the duplicate Ablür epigraph of 1101-44 refer to the Müvara-kDneya-samtati of the Parvatavaji of the Sakti-parse, but the Kedaresvara record of 11135 seems to refer to the Sakti-parse of the Müvara-kóneya-santána of the Parva- támnáya.

The Kedaresvara record of 11938 refers to the Parvatavaji alone. This confusion is easily resolved by comparing the names used by the other subdivisions of the §akti-pari$ad.

A few of the terms derive from Kannada, the language of most of the inscriptions, while the others derive from Sanskrit. Parse is a Kannada variant of parisad (group, assembly, council). Avafi (row, line, lineage, dynasty), amndya (sacred tradition or texts, instruction), and samtati or santana (continuation, lineage, offspring) are common Sanskrit words, but their use in this context is rare. We may translate the Sakti-parisad as the Assembly-of-the- Goddess and the Parvatavali as the Mountain-Lineage. The latter term probably refers to the sacred mountain Snparvata or Srisaila in Kurnool District. A priest of the Parvatavali named Ramesvara was presiding over the Mallikdrjuna-sild-matha at this site in a .d . 1090.12 Snparvata was an important pilgrimage center for the Kalamukhas and is frequently mentioned in their epigraphs. Parvata might also refer to the holy Himalayan mountain Kedara- nath commemorated in the name of the Belagave temple or to the goddess Parvati, who was herself of the lineage of the Mountain. The Bhujangavali or Serpent Lineage may be an allusion to the association of Siva with the cobra. The Kannada term Muvara- kdneya is obscure. J.F. Fleet notes (£Y, V, 219) :Muvara must be the genitive of muvaru, ‘three persons', unless it can be connected with mu, = mudu, ‘advanced age'. For kdne, of which kdneya is the genitive, the dictionary only gives the meanings of ‘a pitcher; an inner apartment or chamber, a room’.Belleya seems to be the genitive of befli, a Kannada word meaning ‘silver.' Itfige, ‘a brick,' is still current in Kannada. It is derived from the Sanskrit istaka or istika.The Muvara-kdneya-samtatiThe Muvara-koneya-samtati of the Parvatavali had its head­quarters at Belagave, but its control extended to about five additional sites in the surrounding region.

The last two sites, however, cannot with certainty be $aid to belong to this line. The earliest inscription at the KedareSvara temple in Belagave is dated by Rice at c. a .d . 1078.13 It is a grant made to the priest Valmlki-muni, the second in descent from Kedarasakti-munipati. Another priest second in descent from KedaraSakti was Somesvara- pantfita-deva. He is the donee in four grants : three dated a .d . 1094, 1103 and 1113 from the Kedaresvara temple and one dated 1101 from Ablur.14 Subtracting about twenty-five years for each priest, Kedarasakti must have headed the monastery between about 1025 and 1050. If the Belagave-Ablur Somesvara is identical with the ascetic by that name teaching at Su^i as early as 1060,15 Keda­rasakti may be placed slightly earlier. The name Kedarasakti suggests that he may have been the founder of the Kedarasvara temple and priesthood. The latest inscription of this priesthood found at the temple is dated 121516 although a collateral line at Gadag has left a record dated 1225.17 If we can identify the priest­hood at Devasthana-Hakkalu as another collateral line, the period may be extended up to the twelfth year of Ramacandra-raya of the Seunas, or 1280.18 This is one of the latest dates of all Kala- mukha epigraphs.

Certainly these Kalamukhas do not seem to uphold a doctrine ‘in conflict with the Vedas (Veda-virodha) ,’ unless by this Ramanuja merely means in conflict with his own Vedic exegesis. The list of subjects studied at the matha includes nearly the whole of traditional Sanskrit learning with the addition of two slightly less orthodox subjects, Lakula-siddhanta and Patahjala Yogasastra. The eclecticism in the choice of alms reci­pients is astonishing and testifies to the charity and tolerance of the directors of the matha. The sectarian affiliations of all the various classes of ascetics given alms cannot be determined exactly, but the list probably, includes Jains, Buddhists, Saivas, Vaisnavas, and perhaps even Ajlvikas. The term ksapanaka usually refers to naked Jain ascetics although it occasionally refers also to Buddhists. Hamsa and paramahamsa ascetics may be either Vaisnava or Saivite since these terms seem to denote levels of spiritual advance­ment rather than sectarian affiliation.32 There is some confusion regarding the titles ekadandin and tridandin. G.S. Ghurye believes that the former are Saivite and the latter Vaisnava while A.L. Basham seems to suggest the opposite.33 K.K. Handiqui has clearly shown that the original sources themselves are ambiguous or contradictory.34 Basham further suggests that the compound nagna-bhagna, ‘naked and crippled,’ may refer to a class of ascetics, possjbly the Ajlvikas, who were ‘naked and crippled’ owing to ritual austerity and initiatory mutilations.35The comparison of the Southern-Kedara with the original Himalayan mountain points to some connection between these ascetics and the North-west. Several Kalamukha priests in Mysore bore the name Kasmira-pan<Jita, and this fact led A.V. Subbiah to assert that the Kalamukha sect originated in Kashmir.36 This^See G.S.

First, both the Kâlàmukhas of Ramanuja and the priest's of the Kedàresvara temple are worshippers of Siva. Furthermore, however great the learning of the Kodiya-matha priests, the essential featurfc of their faith seems to be personal devotion or bhakti to §iva rather than metaphysical speculation or a 'religion of sacrifice and ritual observance. In’ this respect these priests bear resemblance to their famous opponent who at this time was preaching his bhakti- yoga at Srirangam some 250 miles to the south-east.Ramanuja identifies the Kâpàlas, Kâlàmukhas, Pâsupatas, and Saivas as the four Saivite orders which follow the doctrine of Pàsupati. The association of the Kâlàmukhas with the Pââupatas is well-documented. Many Kâlàmukha teachers, including §ri- kantha, are identified with Lakulïéa, the famous Pàsupata saint to whom the Pàsupata-Sùtra is traditionally ascribed. Ldkulasid- dhànta, the Doctrine of Lakula, is one of the chief subjects studied at the Kôdiya-matha, and most of Srikantha’s successors are either identified with Lakula or said to follow the Lâkulasiddhânta or Lâkulâgama. Other South Indian inscriptions attest to the importance of Lakullsa to the Kâlàmukhas and consequently to the close relation between the Kâlàmukhas and Pâsupatas. A nearly identical verse contained in two records from Belgaum District—one from Sirasangi dated a .d . 1148 and one from Nesargi dated 1219-2041—seems to identify the Kàlàmukhasas Mahàvratins and Mahàpâsupatas.

These usually portray him as a naked yogin with a staff (lakufa) in his left hand and a citron in his right, with his penis erect, and either standing or seated in the padmasana. At about the beginning of the eleventh century, however, the Lakullsa cult seems to have shifted its activities to southern India, especially to the Mysore region. The number of statues in northern India declines and the name Lakullsa suddenly appears in a large number of Kannada epigraphs. Some of the donees in these epigraphs are identified as Kalamukhas and others as Pasupatas. It is likely that there was an actual migra­tion of LakuliSa devotees to the Karnataka region from various parts of north-western India.As we have noted, V. Subbiah suggested that the Kalamukhas originated in Kashmir. In support of this theory, however, he could cite only a few inscriptions which mentioned Kalamukha ascetics named KaSmira-pantfita. A recently edited inscription from Muttagi in Bijapur District dated a .d . 1147 helps to give the theory some added weight.43 The record eulogises a line of Saivite priests who had migrated from Kashmir and had settled at Bijapur. This priesthood is positively identified as a Kalamukha one in a grant of a .d . 1074-75 from Bijapur itself.44 It appears, in fact, that the priests belonged to the Bhujangavali, another branch of the §akti-pari§ad. One of them was named Kasmira and another Lakullsvara.The reason or reasons for the migration from the North of LakuliSa devotees are uncertain. Missionary zeal, loss of patronage, unsettled political conditions, and famine are all possible factors. Several Kalamukha ascetics are known to have been peripatetic teachers, but missionary activity in the South cannot explain why the Lakullsa cult seems to have lost its power in the North. Famine or loss of patronage by one or more royal dynasties are quite strong possibilities but virtually impossible to confirm. Many parts of north-western India were being rocked by the incursions of Mahmud of Ghazni at about this time and this may also have42The date and teachings of LakulUa are discussed in detail below, chap. vi.45Ed.

Two northern sites connected with the worship of LakulISa and attacked by Mahmud were Mathura and Somnath. In a .d . 380 the former city was the home of the group of ascetics who traced their descent from Kusika, a disciple of Lakulisa. In a .d . 1287 Somnath was the home of a line of Pasupatas who traced their descent from Gargya or Garga, another of Lakulisa’s disciples. Kashmir itself, however, was not conquered by Mahmud although he plundered the Kashmir valley in a .d . 1014 and again attacked the place, this time without success, in the following year. In about a .d . 1030 the great Muslim scholar Al-BIruni noted that ‘Hindu sciences have retired far away from those parts of the country conquered by us, and have fled to places which our hand cannot yet reach, to Kashmir, Benares, and other places.’45 If many Hindu scholars had fled to Kashmir, many of the more prudent Kashmiri scholars must have decided that the time was ripe to move elsewhere. Among them may have been the Kashmiri , Kalamukhas who travelled to the South where some of their co-religionists had established themselves as early as the end of the eighth century.Several interesting similarities exist between the Somnath Pa&upatas and the Belagave Kalamukhas in addition to their association with LakulISa. The Cintra prasasti of 1287 records the consecration of five lihga temples in Somnath.46 The Pancalinga temple in Belagave belonged to the Kalamukhas. The five lingas at Somnath were consecrated by a priest named Tripurantaka. One of the Ka amukha temples in Belagave was dedicated to the god Tripurantaka. The Somnath Tripurantaka’s preceptor was Valmlki-rasi, a name also found among the early priests of the Muvara-koneya-saiptati. The Somnath record describes a pilgri­mage undertaken by Tripurantaka during which he visited two sites with important Kalamukha associations—Kedara in the Himalayas and Sriparvata in Kumool District. These similarities show that the Pasupatas and Kalamukhas continued to share a large body of common traditions in addition to having a common base in the teachings of Lakulisa.A third point of agreement between the statements of Ramanuja and the Kalamukha epigraphs is their references to the agamas. Ramanuja seems to state that the doctrines of the Saivas and other45Trans. E.C. Sachau, Alberuni's India, 1,22. *SEd. and trans. G.

Tradition enumerates twenty- eight of these texts, but the actual number is much larger. They are usually associated with the doctrine of the Saiva sect proper, Saiva-siddhanta, but other Saivite schools developed their own agamas. Most of fhese are now lost although there are several extant agamas of the VIrasaiva or Lingayat sect. The term agama is sometimes used simply as a generic term for 6aivite religious texts or for the Tantras.A fourth point of agreement is the connection with Yoga. Srikantha is called a ‘Lord among Yogins ( Yogisvara) ' while Ramanuja’s Kalamukhas practise various Yoga type rituals. The emphais on Yoga is better exemplified by some of the epithets of Srikantha’s successors, but nowhere do the inscriptions suggest quite such unusual measures as those listed by Ramanuja. We have noted above the description of a Kalamukha priest as a typical Saivite ascetic in the 1252-53 record from MunavaJJi.48One additional feature to emerge from the descriptions of §rikan{ha is their emphasis on his knowledge of the science of logic, or tarka-vidya. This emphasis becomes more explicit in the epithets of some of his successors who are called Naiyayikas and Vaise§ikas. The Nyaya-Vaisesika system of philosophy is preeminently the science of logic and is closely associated with the Pasupatas.49 We might also compare the predilection for logical, or rather casuistical, argument of the Kapalika in Mahendravar- man’s Mattavilasa.Somesvara-pandita-deva, the third in the main line of Kedares- vara pontiffs, is the reigning pontiff in three records from Belagave and in two identical records from Ablur, all dated between 1094 and 1113.50 He may also be identical with the SomeSvara whono THE kApAlikas and KALAMUKHAS47Ed. and trans.

The present record further claims Somesvara proficient in siddhánta (doctrine), tarka (logic), vyákarana (grammer), kávya (poetry), nátaka (drama), Bharata (?=music), and ‘many other branches ofliterature and learning.’ The term siddhánta may refer simply to philosophy in general; to Saiva-siddhanta, the doctrine of the Saiva sect; or, most likely, to the Lákula-siddhánta taught at the Kodiya-matha.The duplicate inscription of a .d . 1101-04 found at theBasavesvara temple at Ablür reveals that the original name of the temple was Brahmesvara, after the name of the official who built it.55 According to this record, the village of MuriganahaHi was given to the temple by the dandanáyaka Govindarasa in the year 1101.

Fleet thinks there may be ‘some hidden second meanings,’ but we feel they are probably correct as rendered. If they are correct, then the reference to the Buddhists must also be a positive one. The water-lilies (mrijata) of this passage are, in fact, probably day-blooming, not night- blooming. Somesvara would then be the sun that opens the water- lilies that are the Buddhists. The object of the whole passage is to announce Somesvara’s mastery of all philosophical doctrines. We have noted that commentaries to the ‘six systems of philosophy’ including the Bauddha system were said to have been composed at the Kodiya-ma(ha. Vacaspati Misra provides a precedent for this.

The first of these epithets merely repeats the yogic virtues mentioned in the 1094 grant with the exception of prdndyama and pratydhara. His praise continues :He who is gracious to learned men; he who is a very sun to (open) the great cluster of water-lilies (blooming in the daytime) that is the Nyaya&astra, and who is a very autumn- moon to bring to full tide the ocean of the Vaise§ikas; he who is a very ruby-ornament of those who are versed in the Samkhyagama, and who is a very bee on the water-lilies that are the feet of his teacher; he who is a very spring to the grove of mango-trees that is the $abdasastra, and who has given new life to the Lakulasiddhanta by the development of his wisdom; he who is a very stream of the river of the gods in unequalled reasoning, and who has made the assembly of his disciples to prosper by the favour of the counsel given by him; he who is a very ocean to (receive) the stream of the great river that is the Sahityavidyd: and who has quite satisfied the god Paramesvara (§iva) with the unbroken flow of his devotion; he who is the sole abode of the virtues of blameless and spotless penance, and who has delighted the whole circuit of the earth with the moonlight that is his fame.58The Belagave record of 1103 is a grant to the temple of Dak§ina- Kedaresvara made by the same dandanayaka Govindarasa for incense, lights and offerings to the god while washing the feet of Somesvara.59 In addition to the above epithets, he is also called ‘the acdrya of the temple of the southern Kedaresvara of the Tavaregejce of Bajjigave.’ Thus it appears that Somesvara was at the same time the acarya of the Nagaresvara temple, the Brahmesvara temple, and the Daksina-Kedaresvara temple (unless he had by this time given up the former positions).^Ed. and trans.

The Sarasvatas were and are a Brahmana caste resident chiefly in Punjab and Sind but also prominent in both Kashmir and Mysore. The identification of a Kalamukha priest as a member of this caste shows that at least some, and probably most, of the Kalamukha priests claimed Brahmana status and also tends to confirm the connection of the Kalamukhas with the Northwest and Kashmir. It seems probable that a good number of the present day Sarasvatas of Mysore are descended from northern migrants including the Kalamukhas. A famous member of the Sarasvatas, the poet Bilhana, migrated from Kashmir to the court of Vikramaditya VI, a patron of the Kalamukhas, in the second half of the eleventh century.61 It is not inconceivable that Bilhana himself was in some way allied with the Kalamukhas.An ascetic bearing the name Somesvara was attached to the gods Nagaresvara and Acalesvara in Sudi, a village in Dharwar District not too far from Belagave, at abopt this time. He is mentioned in grants dated a .d . 1060, 1069-70, 1075, and 1084.62 He may plausibly be identified with the Muvara-koneya-samtati priest, but this identification cannot be confirmed since none of the Sutji records mention any of his preceptors or the Sakti-parisad.

The company of fair women must be the ‘public women’ (sufeyar, i.e. devadasls), who figure prominently among the donees in this grant.The Su<Ji records praise the ascetic called Somesvara in terms which closely mirror the praises of the Ablur and Belagave inscrip­tions.

We are inclined, therefore, to accept his identity with the Somesvara at Ablur and Belagave.Somesvara is further praised in several records of his successors. The a .d . 1129 Kedaresvara epigraph lists the entire line of ascetics from Kedarasakti to Gautama but claims that ‘the fortune of the Kedara temple was planted, as if a tree of plenty for the world, through Somesvararya.’66 The 1156 epigraph of Vamasakti II, disciple of Gautama, contains a nearly identical statement.67 The much defaced grant of c. 1164 mentions Somesvara as a disciple of Srlkantha.68 Somesvara-deva begins the list of acaryas in the Triku{eSvara temple inscriptions from Gadag of the years 1191 and 1 192.69 The inscription of 1192, as mentioned above, adds the significant title ‘Kajamukha-acarya’ to his name.The main line of the successors of Somesvara seems to have passed from Vidyabharana, also called Vadividyabharana, to Vamasakti I and Gautama-muni. These three as well as their three predecessors all appear in the 1129 Kedaresvara inscription. The description of Vidyabharana makes clear what must have been the true attitude of these ascetics to the rival creeds of Bud­dhism, MImamsa, and Syadvada or Jain scepticism :After that, the equal of the celebrated Bharabhuti [unidenti­fied], was celebrated that fortunate munipa's [SomeSvara’s] younger brother, Vidyabharana, a faultless ornament of learning, an ornament of the lady fame.

Nonetheless, it was to Vidyabharana that the Calukya king Somesvara III came to make a grant to the temple in 1129. After the details of the grant—a gift of the village of Tadavanale for repairs to the temple and for worship of the god—the inscription continues with an unusual passage which relates how ‘Vidyabharana, despising it [the gift] as being a cause for the destruction of the various pleasures of learning and the happy state of yoga, made it over to his own world-renowned senior disciple Gautama-muni, with the headship of the matha/ The section closes telling how the tree which is the Kedarcsvara temple was planted by Somesvara, ‘threw out branches, was filled with sprouts, blossomed and spread into all the world’ under Vamasakti I and bore fruit through the great Gautamacarya. Vidyabharana is not mentioned. The invo­cation, however, declares that Vidyabharana has commanded the god Kedaresvara to protect Gautama, ‘a present manifestation of the ancient Gautama-muni.’Evidently something unusual must have happened in the suc­cession of the matha at about this time. Fleet (El, V, 224) notes that there is nothing in the inscription to explain why both Vama­sakti and Gautama are called the chief disciples of Vidyabharana and nothing to explain ‘why Vidyabharana “censured” or came to regret the happiness of having devoted himself to the various delights of learning because it had proved ‘‘destructive of stability,” and on that account, appointed Gautama to the office of Matha- pati.’ The former question is a bit puzzling, but the latter one, at least in the terms given by Fleet, is based on an inaccurate transcription of the text. It is not happiness which is destructive of stability, but the gift which is destructive of Vidyabharana’s happiness. The main problem seems to be why Vamasakti was passed over in favor of Gautama when it came to choosing the successor of Vidyabharana. Vidyabharana, it should be emphasised, only transferred the ‘business of the matha’ to Vamasakti. The record does not state that Vamasakti ever received the actual70Ed. and trans.

Vidyabharana seems to have kept this honour for himself, since it is to him that Somesvara III of the Calukyas went in 1129 to make the grant. Vamafcakti was probably appointed only executive director of the monastery and may have either died before the final appointment of Gautama or else simply have been passed over for some unknown reason. Fleet thinks that the ins­cription was drawn up at some time considerably after 1129 but we cannot see any significant reason why this should be the case.In the 1149 KedareSvara grant, Gautama is called the disciple of Vadividyi£bharana-pan<iita-deva.71 Vidyabharana is given the same expanded title in a grant from the BrahmeSvara temple at Ablur dated a .d . 1130 and 1144.72 This grant introduces us to a new member of this priesthood named JnanaSakti-pantfita-deva who was ‘the disciple of Vadividyabharana-pantfita-deva of the Muvara-kdneya-saqitati.’ The inscription records how a certain Bammagavun^a was reminded that the shrine of Brahmesvara at Ablur had prospered under the protection of his father and grandfather and that he too should make donations to this temple. Bammagavup<Ja accordingly became ‘inflamed more than ever with a desire for union with the passionate woman that is devotion to the god §iva.’ He then mounted a horse and promised to donate as much land as the horse could cover while running at top speed. After this unusual miniature aivamedha he washed the feet of JfianaSakti and presented the land he had promised. This was in 1130. In 1144 a danfanayaka named Mallibhavarasa made another grant to the BrahmeSvara temple. Both grants were ‘preserved’ by Bammag£vun<ia and the great saint Jfiana^aktideva. A Jfiana§akti is named as the priest of the Tripurantaka temple in Belagave in two grants dated c. 1150 and 1159, but it is unlikely that he is the same person.73Gautama again appears in the 1139 KedareSvara temple ins­cription.74 This grant records the establishment of an image of the god KusuveSvara and the donation of its temple, ‘as attached to the god KedareSvara,’ to Gautama-deva by two sculptors named Bavana and Ravana ‘in order to clear an aspersion on their own race of the sculptors.’ What this aspersion or fault of their guild7lEd. and trans.

These two grants from Gadag and another dated a .d . 121378 are the only Sakti-parisad records written mainly in Sanskrit.One of the most remarkable features of these Gadag grants is their location so far from Belagave. Gadag is situated some seventy- five miles north-north-east of Belagave. Ablur and Su^li are only about fifteen to twenty miles from Belagave. This long distance raises the possibility that Candrabhusana of Gadag was not in fact a member of the Belagave line. His rather late dates also suggest this. In the 1129 Kedaresvara grant Vidyabharana must already have been quite old since he had seemingly turned over management of the matha to first one and then a second senior disciple. If Candrabhusana was still alive in about 1199 and was, say, about eighty years old, he would have been only ten years old in 1129. In addition, the Gadag inscriptions mention neither the Sakti- pari^ad, the Muvara-koneya-sarptati, nor the Parvatavali. None­theless, the evidence in favor of Candrabhusana belonging to the Belagave line is too strong to be dismissed. Most important is the designation of his teacher and teacher’s teacher as Vidyabharana- deva and Somesvara-deva respectively. The odds against these two being persons other than the Kedaresvara ascetics are high on the basis of the identity of the names alone. Siddhanti-candra- bhu§ana-pandita-deva’s name, particularly the ending ‘pandita- deva,’ and the explicit mention of his belonging to the Kalamukha lineage render the identification nearly certain. Although Ablur and Su(Ji are much nearer than Gadag to Belagave, they provide a precedent for the extension of the priesthood to other temples. The large gap in years between the 1129 inscription of Vidyabharana and the 1199 inscription of his disciple Candrabhusana is rather difficult to account for, but it is not impossibly large if Vidyabharana lived until about 1140 or 1150. The fact that he is given the expanded title Vadividyabharana-pandita-deva in the 1144 grant to his Ablur disciple Jnanasakti and in the 1149 grant to his Belagave disciple Gautama suggests that he acquired the title sometime after 1129.

The above passage is written in a pleasing kavya style and contains several points of interest. First, the priest is said to command the support and respect of royalty. Although he does not claim the rank of rdjaguru like other Kalamukha priests, the list of his intellectual attainments, particularly the inclusion of rdjanitl or polity, is well-suited for a royal advisor. The term Vatsyayana might refer to the famous fourth century commentator on the Nyaya-sutra, but the context favors an identification with the author of the Kama-sutra. Second, Candrabhu§ana seems to have carried on the tradition of his Belagave preceptors in acts of charity and munificence and to have instituted much building and expansion of the temple and the area about it. Third, he is shown to have supported the practice of temple prostitution. This settles any doubts about whether or not devadasls were employed at Kalamukha temples. They obviously were, and this practice may have been partially responsible for Ramanuja’s dislike of the Kalamukhas.Several other epigraphs have been found at the Trikutesvara temple in Gadag, but most are fragmentary or contain little infor­mation about the priesthood. The earliest, dated a .d . 1002, registers a land grant to the temple of Svayambhu in Gadag.80 The gift was entrusted to the priest Kajajfiani-vakkhani-jiya, the disciple of Koppina-vakkhani-deva, a disciple of Puliya-pan<Jita. Although there were no priests by these names at the Kedaresvara temple in Belagave, the Svayambhu temple is evidently the same as the temple of Svayambhu TrikuteSvara. A later Koppina-vakkhana-deva appears in a genealogy of Parvatavali ascetics at Ron, also in Dharwar District.81 Another priest unknown to the Belagave records, KriyaSakti-pantfita, was the head of the ma^ha of Svayam­bhu TrikuteSvara in a .d . 1102 when a feudatory of the Calukya king Vikramaditya VI made a grant to the temple.82 This priest122 THE KApALIKAS AND KALAMUKHAS79Ed.

A fragmentary grant to the Triku|esvara temple made in 1184—85 contains the name Vidyabharana but must have been made to his disciple Candrabhu§ana.83 Candrabhusana’s own disciple Kriyasakti-pa^ita is the donee in a grant to the temple made in a .d . 1213.84 The grant is badly damaged and fragmentary. In 1225 two golden banners were given to the temple by Can^auvve, the ‘daughter,’ i.e. disciple, of Siddhanti-KriyaSakti-pantfita.85 This must have been the same priest with an expanded title like that of his preceptor.The prestige of the Belagave maffia probably was greatest during the reign of Gautama’s main line successor Vamasakti (II) who claims the exalted rank of rajaguru in seven grants dated between 1159 and 119386 during the reigns of the Kaiacuris Bijjala, Somesvara Deva, and Ahavamalla Deva, and of the Hoysala Vira-Ballala II. That VamaSakti should have held such a post is not inherently unlikely, since there are several other examples of Kalamukhas assuming this title. Rudra£aktr-deva claims it is a grant made in 1249 to the KotiSvara temple at Kuppatur in the Shimoga District87 An earlier priest from this temple named Sarvesvarasakti-deva is called rajaguru in a grant dated 1070.88 Another Kalamukha priest named Sarvesvara-deva takes the title in the 1252 grant from MunavalU in Belgaum District.89 It is by no means certain if any of these priests were ever rajaguru to a more exalted official than local feudatory rulers and officials.VamaSakti II first appears in a grant to the Kedara-maffia dated a .d . 1156 during the reign of the Calukya Taila III.99 It was issued by a minister of Taila Ill’s feudatory, the Kalacuri Bijjala- devarasa, at the request of ‘learned men and attendants’ to provide for offerings to the god, for food for the temple ascetics, and for«Ed.

Not all of the Kedaresvara inscriptions display such tolerance, however, and it is impossible to determine what exactly were the relations between the Muvara-koneya-samtati priests and their rivals. Perhaps they constantly altered in accordance with the personalities of the reigning priests.Bijjala’s ‘great minister Kesimayya-dandanayaka’ had established and endowed a temple and a Brahmapuri dedicated to Kesava- Visnu. One would naturally suppose him to be a staunch Vaisnava. The inscription of 1159 claims, to the contrary, that none other than VamaSakti, priest of the Kedaresvara temple, was his aradhya or family priest and that it was to him that the superintendence of the new temple and Brahmapuri was entrusted :Washing the feet of his aradhya possessed of .. .

Otherwise this passage adds no new information. The title aradhya is interesting, however, since it was also attributed to the legendary founders of the VIrasaiva sect.In 1162 a .d ., according to another Kedaresvara inscription,93 Bijjala came to ‘BaJJigave’ in order to subdue the southern region.

Although there does not appear to be any record of a Gramesvara temple at Ablur, this hypothesis is a dubious one. It is best to assume that the Kuppatur lemple of Kojisvara and its subsidiaries formed a separate complex. The arrangement into a central archdio­cese with various parishes in the surrounding region may well have been a regular feature of the Kalamukha church. The efficiency of this type of organisation may help to explain the sect’s rapid rise to prominence in the region.

His chief immediate disciple was Avadhüta who had the following junior colleagues: Kedara- éakti, Mallikarjuna, Mürujávi, Nirvánayogi, Vámadéva or Váma- ¿akti, Siddhésakti, Rudraáakti, and Kriyááakti. Vámaáakti had three disciples: Bonteyaguru, Mallikarjuna, and Rudraáakti. In 1189 a.d . this last-named priest purchased some land from the local officials oT HoipbaJ for the temple of the god Kurnara- Bontéévara which he had built in memory of his teacher Vámaáakti. Other gifts were made to the god by local artists and merchants on the same occasion. The most important feature of this lengthy record is the following unique recitation of a series of miracles performed by Bonteyamuni :Of the powers of Bonteyamuni, the outstanding were:In summer, when the burning heat was attacking him from all the four directions, he stood unperturbed on a slab of Suryaiifa in Srigiri with his uplifted pleasant face and hands: seeing this the Sun granted him omniscience and told him ‘Preach Kartfvada to whomsoever you meet whether they be devas, manu$yas, yakfas or raksasas.’ Having received this favour from the sun, Bonteya, full of all powers and dedicated to Éivadharma, returned from the mountain and performed a linga-prati$fhapana during which there was a homa whose fires burned in the skies, and he made many scholarly Brahmans fold their hands in respect.i°6ibid., no. 137.lo^Ed.

The dagger melted and collected like water in his bowl. He drank it and went on his way as everyone was amazed at his great powers.Further, taking a round in Kanaka he came to the emperor Jayasiipha’s house and stood in front of him. At that time famous and well-versed logicians of other systems of philo­sophy were there and questioned him how the Kartr he defended could be formless. He stood invisible (became formless) amidst the hundred logicians for a while and made them speechless (answerless), and expounded the philosophy of Isvara-kartrvada. Thus, by his negation of the other schools of philosophy, he got the title Kartrvada- cakravarti.Furthermore, (once) as Bonteya was coming on a round in the capital, he was seen by a man who was riding an (intoxicated) elephant in rut and who said: ‘Hey! Did you see a bonte (a jumble bundle—a pun on the name of Bonte- yamuni)?’ Hearing that the sage threw it (the bonte) on the ground. The elephant came and lifted it up and collapsed to the ground. [This section is obscure].Further, as he was going round different countries for pilgrimage, one day he was begging alms in Kollapura and a jogini (sorceress) offered him molten metal as alms and he received it without evading it and drank it; the jogini was in flames.Further, once when he was attacked by fever, as if to illustrate the moral that even great ones get rid of the effects of their past deeds, he placed the fever apart in a bag and was busily engaged in the meditation of God.108Several of the places visited by this peripatetic teacher can be identified. Srigiri is probably the same as Srisaila or Sriparvata, the famous pilgrim center in Kumool District. At about this time the Mallikarjuna-sild-mafha of Sriparvata was headed by a Kala- mukha priest of the Parvatavali named Ramesvara-pandita.109108Ibid., 11. 16-26. We thank Professor H.S.

During this period Karahata was the capital of the province known as the Karahata Four (or Ten) Thousand. It is not clear whether Kataka is to be taken as a proper noun. The word generally means simply ‘royal camp’ and in this sense might refer to a number of places. If a proper name is meant, the most likely possibilities are Cuttack (Kataka) in Orissa and Dhanyakataka, sometimes called simply Kadaka and better known as Amaravatl in Andhra Pradesh. The latter site is a better choice since it is known to have contained a Kalamukha temple in the 10th century 110 and is not very far from Srlparvata. Nonetheless, there was no king named Jayasimha ruling over either town at this time. Jayasimha seems certain to be the younger brother of the Kalyana Calukya Vikramaditya VI. As early as 25 June 1077 he was the de facto ruler of the regions known as the Belvola Three Hundred and the Puligejce Three Hundred under the nominal overlordship of his older brother. He rapidly extended his control to the Kandur One Thousand, the Banavasi Twelve Thousand and the Santalige One Thousand. His name disappears from ins­criptions after a .d . 1083. Bilhana’s Vikramankadeva-carita tells of a quarrel between the two brothers the consequence of which was the defeat of Jayasimha. This must have taken place in about 1083.111 Jayasimha’s kataka or royal camp was probably located in this region, which roughly corresponds to the present day Shimoga and Dharwar Districts. The ‘capital’ (rajadhani) mentioned in the next section of the inscription might refer to Kalyana, the main Calukya capital; to Belagave, the capital of the Banavasi Twelve Thousand and Santalige One Thousand; or to any one of several regional capitals in the Calukya empire. Kollapura is, of course, the same as the modern city Kolhapur in southern Maharashtra. Kollapura was the center of a Sakta cult of Pasupata dcdryas dedicated to the goddess Kollapura-mahalaksmi.112 This may well account for the presence of a jogini there.The dates of Jayasimha’s viceroyalty, c. 1077-1083, give the best clue to the period of Bonteyamuni’s priesthood.

This is, in essence, the doctrine which Ramanuja attributed to the Kálámukhas and other worshippers of Paáupati—the Üualistic view of áiva as the instrumental but not the material cause of the universe. The term ísvara-kartrvádá, in the form issarakáranavádi, first occurs in the Máhábodhi Jat aka where an adherent of this doctrine appears as one of the five heretical councillors of King Brahmadatta of Benares.113 áaipkaracarya, in his Brahma-sütra-bhásya ii. 2.37, discusses the views of the Isvara-karanins. These persons are allied to or identical with the Máheávaras who ‘maintain that the five categories, viz. effect [karya], cause [karana]> union [yoga], ritual [vidhi\\y the end of pain [duhkhánta] were taught by the Lord Paáupati (áiva) to the end of breaking the bonds of the animal (i.e. the soul); Paáupati is, according to them, the Lord, the operative [instrumental] cause.*114 These Máheávaras must be Pááupatas since the same five categories appear in Kaun^iinya’s bha$ya on the Pááupata sútra and, in a disjointed form, in Saya^a-Madhava’s discussion of the Nakulíáa-Pááupata system. The extant Paáupata texts do not make any special effort to give an ontological analysis of the material world, but they do maintain an essentially dualistic world view. In at least one important respect, therefore, the Kálámukhas appear to have followed the philosophical doctrines of their close spiritual relatives, the Pááupatas.áaipkaracárya further associates his Máheávaras with the Vaiáe$ikas, who teach ‘that the Lord is somehow the operative cause of the world,’ and with the Naiyáyikas.115 We have noted above the frequent epigraphical references to Kálámukhas as Naiyáyikas and Vaiáe$ikas. There is other evidence connecting the Pááupatas with these two closely related philosophical systems. Bhásarvajña, the author of the well-known Nyáya-sára, also wrote a commentary on the Pááupata work, the Ganakáriká. Gunaratna, the author of a commentary on the Saddariana-samuccaya of Haribhadra, describes the adherents of both the Nyáya andmjátaka, ed. V. Fausbotl, V, 228, 238 and 241.,uTrans. G.

The Naiyáyikas, he says, call themselves Šaivas and the Vaiše^ikas, Pášupatas. Rájašekhara, in his Saddaršana- samuccaya, speaks of the Nyáya sect of Pášupatas.116 In all likelihood the philosophical position of the Kálámukhas did not differ a great deal from that of these Nyáya-Vaiše§ika Pášupatas.After receiving his commission from the Sun, Bonteyamuni’s first act was to set up a liňga. The establishment of liňgas was a characteristic Kálámukha activity, but the worship of Sürya was not. Sürya’s command to preach Kartrváda to gods, men, and demons is best interpreted to mean that the doctrine was to be taught to men irrespective of caste. This also agrees with Rámá- nuja’s statements and helps to confirm the historical link between the Kálámukhas and VIrasaivas.Bonteyamuni’s miracles themselves need little comment. He performed a great penance and a god then rewarded him with divine knowledge and a commission to preach this to the world. He magically turned back attacks by men, animals, witches, and disease. He converted his opponents in a great debate with the aid of a miracle. These are all typical motifs of religious folklore and occur as frequently in western traditions as in eastern although the contexts may differ. These exploits point to a significant ‘magical’ element in Kálámukha belief, but this does not necessarily exclude a high degree of philosophic sophistication as a comparison with mediaeval Catholicism easily shows. The curriculum of the Kodiya-ma{ha could not have been mastered by a group of illiterate witch-doctors.There is one other Kálámukha epigraph which may belong to the BeJJeya-santána, a grant found in the Hariharešvara temple at Sáténahajji in Dharwar District.117 It was issued in a .d . 1204 during the reign of the Hoysala king VIra-Ballála II.

As mentioned above, this grant furnishes the best clue to the meaning of the term Parvatavali and confirms that Sriparvata was an important Kala­mukha center. It was found on a pillar at Kazipet in the Warangal District of Andhra Pradesh. Another grant found at Hanam-Konda or Anamkonda in the same district seems to mention the same teacher.120 This states that the father (?) of king Tribhuvanamalla (Betarasa II) granted Vaijanapali alias Sivapura to Ramesvara- pandita. The father of Tribhuvanamalla was Prola I. King Prola is called ‘the best pupil of that Ramesvara-pandita.’ The teacher is described as follows :This Ramesvara-pandita, who pervaded the quarters (i.e. was well-known) with the moonlight of his fame, who was a Meru mountain for the gems of qualities, the greatest of Siva’s devotees, compassionate, the giver of food to the poor, to the wretched, to the mendicants and to the brahmins, and who was well known for his tapas, conducted service at these temples with great interest .. .118Ed. and trans.

Both are now protected monuments. Around the base of the Tripurantaka is a sculptured frieze illustrating scenes from the Pancatantra.131 Scattered between these scenes are erotic figures similar to those in the frieze around the plinth of the Lak$ma$a temple at Khajuraho. Various theories have been propounded to explain the presence of erotic sculpture in Indian temples. One of the most prevalent views is that it reflects the influence of tantric ideas. Despite the testimony of Ramanuja, however, there is little evidence that Kalamukha worship was in any sense tantric. The peculiar scorn-producing ascetic practices (dvdras) of the PaSupatas do include a mild form of sexual exhibi­tionism called ifngaranaP2 but this does not seem sufficient to account for the sculpture, especially since the commentator on the Pasupata-sutra commends celibacy in no uncertain terms.133 More significant, we feel, is the evidence of temple prostitution at many Kalamukha temples including, as the donation of Trilocana shows, the Tripurantaka in Belagave. In our opinion the erotic sculpture of this temple, and the Khajuraho temples as well, is basically profane in character. Like the devaddsis—for whom it might have been a type of advertisement—the sculpture was simply one of the many semi-secular entertainments formerly provided by the temple. This view does not debase the undoubted beauty of the sculptor’s art, it simply puts it in a different light.134 It would be useful to learn if erotic sculpture is found on other Kalamukha temples, especially those which are known to have maintained devaddsis. The Hoysala style Mallikarjuna temple at Kalsi in the same district contains similar sculpture and may well have been staffed originally by Kalamukha priests.135uoEd.

Although the temples are spread over a large area, they are only five in number and contain a total of only eight relevant inscriptions. It is probable, therefore, that this group was less influential than the Šakti-pari$ad, or at least received less royal and official support.The Siipha-pari§ad is first mentioned in the undated Tantjikontfa grant of the Eastern Cálukya king Ammarája II, who ruled over Veňgí and parts of Kalifiga between a .d . 946 and 970.1 The grant is written in Sanskrit and registers the donation, by the king, of Tantfikontfa and three other villages for the god Umámahešvara in the temple (deválaya) called Samasta-bhuvanašraya. The temple was located in the city Vijayavafi, the modem Vijayawada or Bez- wada on the Krishna River about sixty miles from the river’s mouth. According to the inscription, the temple was originally established by Vijayáditya Narendramrgaraja, who must be Vijayáditya II (c. a .d . 799-847) of the same dynasty. On the occasion of the summer solstice (uttaráyana) Ammaraja II made a gift for the increase of his country, lineage, life, health, and supremacy, in order to provide for temple repairs, bali, naivedya, music (átodya), and a free feeding house (satra).

He is said to have built, in his guru's presence, a beautiful stone devakula and mafha of three stories. For this he received from the king three villages and a thousand she-goats. The record ends saying that the king was the donor, the guru VidyeSvara (II) the composer, and Kafakanayaka the executor of the grant (text 11. 61-68). This may imply that Vidye§- vara was the rajaguru of Ammaraja II, but we know from other records that this king was not a patron of Siva alone since he also made donations to some Jain temples in Bezwada.5Sometime about the end of the tenth century, or possibly earlier, members of the Siipha-pari$ad established themselves in the Bellary District of Mysore. In a .d . 1045 the Lenka One Thousand, a military clan led by the dandanayaka Tikai^na, set up lihgas of NolaipbeSvara and LenkeSvara and won permission from King SomeSvara I of the Kalyana Calukyas to grant some land for worship of the two gods.6 The gift was made while washing the feet of SomeSvara-pantfita of the Siipha-pari$ad, who was in charge of a mafha in Kdgaji, the capital of the Kogaji Five Hundred.

In another grant from this temple dated the same year, this clan donated some more land to the god Nolaipbesvara while washing the feet of the same teacher in the presence of the god Virüpâkça (§iva).7 Both grants identify Someévara as the disciple of Jfiâneévara-pançlita and disciple’s disciple of Maleyàla-pançlita-deva. These priests are given the usual list of yogic virtues, and in the former grant Maleyàla is said to know the true meaning of all the iastras which issued from the lotus-mouth of ârï-Lakulïsa.8This Maleyaja seems to have been an important and well-known religious leader of Siipha-pariçad since he begins the priestly genealogies in many grants found at other sites in this region. In a .d . 1093 Gangarasa, a mahâmandalesvara of the Câlukya king Vikramàditya VI, donated some land for the god Baleévara in a temple of the god built by Gangarasa’s father at the nearby village of Halagondi.9 The grant was made after washing the feet of the teacher Khaleévara-pançlita. Khaleévara’s teacher was Sântaràéi- pan<Jita, whose teacher was Someévara-pandita, whose teacher was Jnâneévara-pançlita, whose teacher was Maleyàja-pançlita. Maleyàla, Jfiàneévara and Someévara are obviously the same teachers who appear in the two grants from Morigere. The des­cription of Maleyàla is in fact copied virtually verbatim from the first Morigere grant. The Halagondi record adds the information that Maleyàla was attached to the god Ràmeévara whose temple was presumably located in Kôgaji. Khalesvara-pan<Jita is given the usual yogic virtues.Twenty-two years earlier, in a .d . 1071, Vikramàditya VI donated a village to the god Kalideva of Huvina-hadagalli, another village in Bellary District, at the request of the mahajanas of the place.10 The grant was for service to the god and for feeding the students, servants, singers, and ascetics of the mafha of Lakuleévara-pantjita, a priest who belonged to the lineage (santati) of Maleyàja-pantfita- deva of Ràmeévara.This same Maleyaja seems to head the priestly genealogies of the donees in two grants found at Yêwûr, a village in Gulbarga7Ibid., no. 104.8Another grant from this temple dated a.d. 1064 (ibid., no. 127) records a gift made to a Siva temple while washing the feet of *... ¿vara-pantf ita-deva of Mopngere.’9Ibid., no. 163.loibid., no. 135."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"OTHER KÀLÂMUKHA PRIESTHOODS145District of Mysore.

Who casts aspersion on these two (statements), on his head will I place my foot in the king’s assembly 29It is difficult to estimate the weight to be given to this defence of social orthodoxy. It is fairly certain that most if not all Kàlàmukha priests claimed Bràhmana status. This we gather from the 1113 inscription which calls Someâvara of Belagâve a Sàrasvata,30 from a few scattered references to the gotras of Kàlàmukha priests, and from the common ending to many of their names, ‘-pançiita- deva.’ On the whole, however, Kàlàmukha inscriptions are re­markably silent on the subjects of caste and class, and in the case of Bonteyamuni of Hoipbal a Kàlàmukha priest is instructed to preach to anyone who would listen.31 Furthermore, the extant texts of the PàSupatas, the sect most closely associated with the Kàlâmukhas, have virtually nothing to say about the subject, and the VIrasaivas, the sect which succeeded the Kàlàmukhas, were openly hostile to caste consciousness. Without more specific information it is impossible to determine the dominant attitude of the Kàlâmukhas to varnQsrama-dharma. In these circumstances the above verse should perhaps be regarded as little more than a stock imprecatory formula.At least two other religious establishments in Belagâve, the Panca-ma^ha and the Senior- or Hiriya-matha, may have belonged25Ed. and trans.

An inscription found in Belagàve itself registers a grant to the god SiddheSvara of Benakanalcoja33 The donor issued the grant in a .d . 1039 after washing the feet of the Kàlâmukha priest KriyàSakti-pandita-deva. A grant of a .d . 1163 from Bandalike commemorates the construction of a stone tower (pràsâda) and a golden pinnacle (kalaka) for the town’s Siva temple by an official named Màceya-nàyaka.34 This official also set up a linga pamed Some§vara—after his feudal overlord, the Kadamba Soma—and donated some land for its temple. Màceya’s guru was DevaSakti- bratindra, ‘an ornament to the face (mukha) of the celebrated Kàlàmukhas.’ This priest is said to be expert in Vedanta, the eight branches of Yoga, Siddhanta, and the Éaivâgamas and to possess the usual yogic virtues. It is also claimed that he received a boon from Aghôra, thé-âcârya of the celebrated Hiriya-matha of Bam- maküru.’ The chief priests of the Brahmacàri-matha of the Someé- vara temple were named SomeSvara-pandita and Blreya-jiya. About eleven years later, in a .d . 1174, Màceya built another Siva temple in the town—called Boppeévara after Kadamba Soma’s father Bopparasa—and donated some land to the Mülasthâna âcârya, the Kàlâmukha Kalyânaâakti-paflçfita.35Belgaum DistrictIn this district of northern Mysore the ancient town of Puli, modern Hüli, seems to have been an important Kàlâmukha center. A composite inscription found there registers several grants to a temple of Andhàsura (Siva) which was controlled by a line of Kàlâmukha priests.36 The first grant, dated a .d . 1104, was to the âcârya Tatpuruça-paùdita, a disciple of Jnànasakti-pandita-deva.

This may be the same priest or, more probably, a successor. A third grant to the god, made by some leading citizens of Puli in 1184, does not mention any priest. In 1224 the weavers* guilds of Puli, worshippers of the god Tri- kQfeivara, made a findl gift to Vámašakti-deva, the sthánácárya of the Andhfisura temple.An undated record found in Huli refers to a Jňánašakti who must be identical with one of the Jflánašaktis of the previous inscriptions.37 He is called ‘an árádhya adored by bowing monarchs of demons and men,’ and ‘an excellent mirror of Kálámukha (doctrine) ' His disciple was Nágaráši, whose lay disciple Mádi- Gautfa is mentioned in another record.38This Jnánašakti and his disciple Nágaráši may well be the same as the priests Rirapuli-jnánašakti and Nata-nágaráši included in the genealogy of the Kálámukha priest Honnayya who taught at Nesargi in the same district.39 In a .d . 1219-20 an official of Kártavírya JV of the Raftas of Sautidatti and Belgaum erected temples of Habbešvara, Mánikešvara and Siddhešvara in Něsargi.

The Sakti-parisad controlled temples at Ablur, Adur, Gadag, Haje-Nidnegila, Hombal, Kuyibal, Lakshmesvar, Rdn, and perhaps also at Sudi and Satenahajli.

Two grants from Nandi Hill in Kolar District are of considerable importance, however, since they are by far the oldest Kalamukha inscriptions yet discovered.

Isvaradasa is described as compassionate towards all beings, devoted to performing good deeds and endowed with the virtues of observing vows (vrata), fasting (upavasa) and niyama. Four years earlier, in 806, the Ra§trakuta king Govinda III donated a village to this Isvaradasa, ‘the lord of the sthana on Nandi Hill,’ for incense, lamps, perfume, bali, and caru in the temple of Siva.87These two records indicate that at least a few Kalamukha ascetics81Ibid., Ak. 42.82Ibid., Ak. 48.«Ibid., Ak. 52.8«Ed.

The ascetics must have originally migrated from somewhere in the North, the home of Lakulisa and his disciples, but we do not know precisely when they arrived. The early presence of Kala- mukha monasteries in the Mysore region was probably an important factor in the later migration of Kalamukha priests from Kashmir during the tenth and eleventh centuries.88Ratnavali’s grant of a .d . 810 concludes with the following unusual imprecation: ‘May he who destroys this incur the sin of having turned Sriparvata upside down, of having cut off the heads of the sages there, of having cut off the heads of a thousand tawny cows and a thousand Brahmanas at Baranasi (Benares) and of having killed in Jambu-dvlpa sages and Brahmanas versed in the 4 Vedas, 18 pramanas and siddhantas.’89 The prominent mention of Sriparvata indicates that this site was already an important holy center for the Kalamukhas. The praising of Brah­manas versed in the Vedas, cows and the city of Varanasi emphasizes the relative orthodoxy of these priests’ beliefs.A grant of a .d . 1169 found at Karadalu in Tumkur District regis­ters a gift to the temples of Sobbesvara, Mace&vara, Bammesvara, and 4... ¿vara.’90 The donee was Bamma-jlya’s son Garigarasi-jiya, ‘a moon to the Kalamukhas’ and ‘the obtainer of a boon from the goddess Sarada.’The Kriya£aktis of VijayanagarA priesthood the heads of which each bore the name or title Kriyasakti played an important part in the religious life of the early Vijayanagar empire.91 Many Kalamukha and Pafcupata priests called themselves by this name and there is little doubt that the Kriyasaktis of Vijayanagar also belonged to one of these two related sects. The term kriyasakti—like jnanasakti, another common Pasupata-Kalamukha name—denotes an important concept in Pasupata theology.92 One of these KriyaSaktis is said to have8*See above, pp. 108-109.89Trans.

Vidyaranya, the famous scholar and Vijayanagar guru, was one of the heads of this matha. A Sanskrit work called Vidya- ranya-kalajnana actually claims that Kriyasakti was the disciple of Vidyaranya and states that these two were revered by the first thirteen kings of Vijayanagar, who were worshippers of the god Virupaksa.94 An inscription of a .d . 1390 seems to record a grant by Immadi Bukka, son of Harihara II, to a shrine of Vidyasaipkara erected in memory of the guru Kriyasakti, who had died the previous year.95 Vidyasaipkaracarya was the title of the guru Vidyaranya’s predecessor at Sringeri, Bharati-Krsna-Tirtha. Another reading of this record, which is evidently badly edited, concludes that Immadi Bukka made his grant with the permission of, rather than in memory of, Kriyasakti.96 A grant of Harihara II dated a .d . 1384 states that the king listened to the teachings of both Vidyaranya and Kriyasakti.97 A grant issued in the year 1403 registers gifts of land both to Kriyasakti-deva-raya-vodeyar and to the guru of the Srihgeri matha.98The PaSupatas and Kalamukhas were philosophical dualists and for this reason were regarded with disfavour by advaita theo­logians such as Saipkaracarya and Sayana-Madhava, the author of the Sarvadarsanasamgraha. This latter priest has been identified as either Vidyaranya himself or his nephew.99 If Kriyasakti was a PaSupata, it is highly unlikely that he was Vidyaranya’s disciple or that a temple of Vidyasarpkara was set up in Kriyasakti’s memory. On the other hand, there is no need to assume that the two groups were overtly hostile to each other. Relations between the various Hindu sects in the early Vijayanagar empire were generally cordial.

As we have noted, one may have died in the year 1389. Several variants of the name occur, including KaSivilasa-Kriyasakti (1368), Kriyasaktyacarya (1378), Vanlvilasa- Kriyasakti (1379), Kriya§akti-deva (1398, 1399, 1431), Kriyasakti- guru-munisvara and Kriya§akti-deva-raya-vodeyar (1403), Kriya- Sakti-guru (1410), and KriyaSakti-deSika (1410). In Madhava- mantrin’s Tatparyadipikd the author identifies his guru as Kasi- vilasa-KriyaSakti, and Gangadevi does likewise in her Kampardya- carita.Like several Kalamukha priests,103 Kriyasakti is given the title rajaguru in a number of records. In some he appears as the guru of Madhava-mantrin, a minister of Prince Marapa.104 Other records praise Kriyasakti as the kula-guru or rajaguru of Harihara II, of a governor called Vitlhanna Otfeyar (1403), of Devaraya I and his son Vijaya-bhupati (1410), and possibly also of Devaraya II (1429). In the Vira-Kampardya-carita he is also called the kula-guru of Kampana II.105 Since the term kula-guru means family preceptor, it is likely that these priests &ere held in high esteem by most of the early Vijayanagar rulers.Many inscriptions describe Kriyasakti as a worshipper of the god Siva in the form Svayambhu-Triyambakadeva.

The best source is an inscription of Madhava-mantrin dated a .d . 1368 which registers his gift of the village of Muchchantji in Shimoga District to eighty learned Kashmir Brahmanas.107 The lengthy eulogy of this minister asserts that he, ‘through the astonishing favour of his master Kasivilasa Kriyasakti, a manifest incarnation of Girina, gained celebrity as a Saiva [sambhava].’ He also ‘cleared and made plain the ruined path of the upani$adsand ‘on the advice of the Siva guru Kasivilasa Kriyasakti, he worshipped in the manner of the Saivamnaya the god of gods embodied in his own favourite linga [ista-linga], Tryambaka-natha, by means of daily special ceremonies, and by a number of rites and practices.’ The grant to the eighty Brahmanas was made to mark the completion of a ‘great Saiva vow’ (mahac-chaiva-vrata) lasting one year which he had undertaken in accordance with the directions of the Siva- samdhyd. Unfortunately the specific details of this great vow and the other rites and practices are never spelt out. The ‘great Saiva vow’ is conceivably the Mahavrata of the Kapalikas although for reasons already stated we prefer not to make this identification.108 The donees in the present grant must have had some connection with KriyaSakti since they are described as ‘pre-eminent by their virtues and the country of their birth [Kashmir], travellers to the farthest point of the Cardyaniya-aticarandmndya, daily observers of all the rites appointed in the pure $ivamnaya, ever devoted to the worship of the A${amurti.’109 From a record of a .d . 1347 we learn that KriyaSakti’s disciple Madhava-mantrin aided Prince Marapa in the compilation of a work called Saivdgama-sdrasarpgraha.ll° The minister was also the author of the Sutasamhitd-tdtparya-dipika on the Sutasarphita of the Skanda Purapa.ni><*Ed. and trans.

Asita-vaktra, Black-face, is a synonym for Kalamukha. This tends to show that Kalamukha, rather than Kalamukha, is the correct Sanskrit form of the name. Mallikarjuna’s own name may reflect devotion to the god of Sriparvata. According to the inscription Mallikarjuna was a member of the Atreya-gotra, a resident of Mathura, a master of the Vedas, and a pupil of Vidyarasi and TaporaSi. Mathura might be either of two famous cities—Uttara-mathura (modern Mathura in U.P.) or Daksina-mathura (modern Madurai in Madras). The latter city is more probable since it is less than 100 miles from Kbtfumbajur, but the former is also possible since many Kala- mukhas were emigrating from the North at about this time.Inscriptions found at PaJlimatfam in Ramanathapuram (Ramnad) District and Tiruvojriyur in Chingelput District refer to Mahavratin ascetics who must have been Kalamukhas. At PaJJimadam some sheep were given for a lamp in the majha of MahavratigaJ attached to the Sundarapandya-iSvara temple.119 The grant was issued during the reign of VIra Papdya and has been tentatively dated at about the middle of the eleventh century.At Tiruvojnciyur an important majha of Mahavratins was founded or brought to prominence by Vajabha, a general of C5Ja Rajaditya, in about the middle of the tenth century.120 When Rajaditya died in a .d . 948 during the battle of Takkolam, Vajabha was not at his side. In grief and shame the general went to bathe in the Ganges and resolved to become an ascetic. He returned to the South and entered a cave named after the guru Niranjana at Tiruvojriyur. There he obtained enlightenment and devoted himself to the per­formance of the Mahavrata for the sake of the protection of the majha. He assumed the spiritual name or title, Caturanana-pan<Jita, and, in about a .d . 959, made a gift of some gold to the assembly (sabha) of Narasiipha-mangala for a special service to the god §iva on the day of Dhani§Jha, the star of his own birth.\"*Ed.

Raghavan notes (El, XXVII, 300) that the Tiruvorriyurp-Puranam tells of a Tontfai- man of Kanci who erected a Siva temple at Tiruvornyur and established 500 Siva lihgas. He also brought from the banks of the Ganges 500 Brahmana Mahavratins and dedicated several images of Kali and Bhairava and one of Siva in the form of a teacher of the Mahavratins. Some of these images can still be identified and seem to date from later Pallava times.Kalamukhas and VirasaivasA considerable amount of circumstantial evidence points to the existence of a close historical link between the Kalamukhas and the Virasaivas. A definitive analysis of the problem would require extensive research both in the field and in the library. In particular, the voluminous hagiology of the Virasaivas, mostly written in Kannada and Telugu, would have to be digested and painstakingly compared with the available epigraphic data. We will be content to draw attention to some of the more important clues which have turned up in the course of our investigation of the Kalamukhas.The early history of the Virasaivas is buried in a maze of legends.124 The principal early leader of the sect was Basava (Sanskrit vrsabha = bull), a minister of the Kalacuri king Bijjala (ic. 1145-67). VIrasaiva tradition claims that the sect antedates Basava, who was merely a major reformer. Modern authorities disagree about this point, but it seems probable that to most intents and purposes Basava was the founder. Not only is there no epigraphic evidence of the existence of Virasaivas before Basava, but the epigraphic allusions to VIrasaiva activity in the two or three centuries after Bijjala are few and far between. This is not to say, of course, that the sect had no antecedents. The evidence suggests that it was a reformist schism from the Kalamukha church,2lSee K.A.N. Sastri, The Colas (1st edition), 1,433, and Rangacharya, Inscriptions . . ., I, 445.,22See K.A.N. Sastri, The Cofas (1st edition), I, 433-444.,23See ed. H.K.

The Basava Purana avers that Basava was the son of a Brahman named Madiraja and his wife Madalambika of Bagevatfi (in Bijapur District). Basava was married to the daughter of Ba|adeva, Bijjala’s chief minister, and was appointed to Bajadeva’s position after the latter’s death. Basava’s sister Nagalambika had a son named Canna-Basava. After Basava’s appointment, he and his nephew began propounding the new Virasaiva doctrine and won a great number of converts. In the process they rapidly depleted Bijjala’s treasury with munificent gifts to the jahgamas, the Virasaiva priests. This alienated the king who sought to punish Basava, but before he could do so the latter fled. The king set out' to capture him, but Basava gathered together a large number of his followers and defeated the king in battle. The king then reinstated Basava to his old position but their relations were never again the same. Basava eventually commission­ed one of his followers to murder the king. After the murder Basava hurried to the shrine of Sangamefcvara at the confluence of the Malaprabha and Krishna rivers and was absorbed into the godhead.The major portion of the Jain version is similar, but there are several important differences. After the regicide, for instance, the murdered king’s son is said to have chased Basava to Ulavi on the Malabar coast, where the former minister ignominiously committed suicide by throwing himself into a well. Basava’s nephew Canna-Basava was later reconciled with the new king and became sole leader of the Virasaivas.Both these sources are relatively late and there is no solid epigraphic confirmation of the story. For this reason J.F. Fleet125S.C. Nandimalh, in his A Handbook of Virasaivism (p. 9), notes that the Kala- mukha ma(ha at Huli is now an important Virasaiva majha and tentatively concludes that the transformation of Katamukha majhas into Virasaiva majhas may have occurred elsewhere as well: ‘Slowly and imperceptibly they were absorbed into Virasaivism.‘ The Mysore Gazetteer (II, Part II, 885) offers the opinion that the Saivite revival under Basava and the other early Virasaivas ‘seems to have followed as the natural result of the work of these Saiva teachers of the PaSupata [sic for Kalamukha] school at Balagami [ = Belagave].126Trans.

Sastri feels that Fleet went too far in this rejection and cites a genealogy contained in a subsequently edited Arjunawada inscriptions of the Yadava Kannara (a.d. 1260) which mentions ‘Basava or Sangana-Basava as the younger son of Madiraja described as Tardavddi-madhyagrdma-Bagavadi-puravarddhisvara.’128 These two persons, Sastri believes, must be the famous Virasaiva and his father. Although this identification is perfectly plausible, there is still no epigraphic corroboration of the legendary biographies or even of Basava being a minister of Bijjala.An inscription of about a.d. 1200 found at the Somanatha temple at Ablur in Dharwar District provides better evidence about a Saivite priest named Ekantada Ramayya,129 who is des­cribed as a VIraSaiva saint in the Canna-Basava Purana.no A great contest was held in the town between him and the Jains. He van­quished them by offering his own head to §iva, who restored it as good as new after seven days. The losers still refused to destroy their image of Jina and establish one of §iva in its place. Ekantada Ramayya destroyed their shrine and built a large temple of Vlra- Somanatha in its place. The Jains appealed to Bijjala for retribution but declined his offer of a second contest for bigger stakes. Bijjala therefore dismissed their appeal and ‘bestowed on Ekantada Ramayya, in the public assembly, a jayapatra or certificate of success.’This record contains an important clue to the possible_relations existing between the Virasaivas and Kalamukhas. In it Ekantada Ramayya is said to have delivered a sermon in the BrahmeSvara temple at Ablur. As we have seen,131 this temple was headed by Kalamukha priests of the Muvara-kdneya-saiptati until at least a.d. 1144. There is no reason to assume that it was not still in their hands when Ekantada Ramayya visited it a few years later. Evidently Ekantada Ramayya and these Kalamukha priests128In Yazdani (ed.), The Early History ..., I, 463.i29Fleet, El, V, no. E.13i)Trans. G. Wurth, JBBRAS, VIII, 198. The story of ‘Yekanta Rameiya' in this work differs considerably from the epigraphic account, but the essentials are similar enough to confirm that he is the same priest. According to the Purana, ‘Yekanta Rameiya, a great saint,’ heard of the fame of Basava and went to Kalyana to see him. This suggests that Ekantada Ramayya became a Virasaiva after his reputation was already established. This Ablur inscription gives no specific indication that he belonged to this sect.131See above, p. 118."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"170THE KÂPÀLIKAS AND KÀLÂMUKHASmaintained cordial relations. It is even possible that at the time of delivering his sermon Ekantada himself was a member of the Kalamukha sect.132 The Brahmesvara temple is today known as the temple of BasaveSvara and is a ViraSaiva shrine.133Many other former Kalamukha temples are now controlled by the VIrasaivas. The exact number and percentage is not known134 but they include the Kedare§vara temple in Belagave, the Triku- tesvara temple at Gadag (Dharwar District), and the Kalamukha temples at Huli (Belgaum District). Belagave, the former seat of the §akti-pari$ad, is now a center of ViraSaiva activity and is visited by ViraSaiva pilgrims from the surrounding areas.135 Of the five most sacred Virasaiva mathas, one is at Sriparvata in Kumool District and one at Kedaranath in the Himalayas—both sites with important Kalamukha associations. Even more signi­ficant, perhaps, is the fact that few VIrasaivas are found in areas not formerly dominated by the Kalamukhas.The similarities we can trace between Kalamukha and Virasaiva cult and philosophy are regrettably few. This is not altogether surprising since very little is in fact known about the early VIrasaivas apart from the broad outlines of their history. Our information about the Kalamukhas is not much greater except insofar as we assume that they followed the doctrines and rituals of the Pasupatas.The most characteristic feature of later Virasaiva philosophy, the doctrine of sat-sthala, is not mentioned in the early vacanas. According to S.N. Dasgupta, the philosophical content of Basava’s vacanas is negligible.136 One of the earliest Virasaiva philosophical works, Revanarya’s Siddhanta-sikhamani, written in about the thirteenth century, does present certain similarities to Kalamukha— or at least PaSupata—doctrine. This work states that §iva-Brahman is without any form or differentiation, yet is endowed with will by which he creates and destroys the world.137 This corresponds to the view of the Kalamukha priest Bonteyamuni of Hoipbal that the Creator (kartr) is formless.138 The idea that the distribution of the fruits of karman is managed and controlled by God, rather02See above, note 130.UBSee Fleet, El.

We know virtually nothing about Kálámukha social attitudes, but it seems probable that they were more orthodox.141Two important similarities between the respective cults of the Kálámukhas and Vírašaivas are the organization into large mathas and the emphasis placed on liňga worship. The former needs no comment. There is no epigraphic evidence that the Kálámukhas ever followed the Virašaiva practice of each devotee wearing a small liňga, but the Basava Purána itself admits that this practice existed even before Basava. In any case, the Kálámukhas valued liňga worship very highly. In the Kedárešvara record of c. a .d . 1164, for instance, the Belagáve priest Kedárašakti asserts that ‘Whoso sets up but one liňga, obtains a myriad-fold all the merit described in the ágamas,’142The priests of the Vírašaivas are called jaňgamas, a term they explain as Uiňgas in movement.’143 In a number of inscriptions the same word, with the same interpretation, is applied to Kálámukha priests. The a .d . 1192 record from Gadag describes the Kálámukha Candrabhu§ana-pan<iita-deva as the fourth, and moving (jaňgama) liňga of the god Triku{ešvara.144 The donor of the a .d . 1189 grant from HoipbaJ, the Kálámukha priest Rudrašakti, is called a jaňgama,145 and the Kálámukha ascetic Sarvešvara-deva, who headed the Jagadíšvara temple at Munavajji in a .d . 1252, is called a jaňgama-liňgávatara, an incarnation of a moving liňga.146 In the Virašaiva Puránas the relations between Basava and the jaňgamas, especially the profligate twelve thousand, are not altogether»9History ..., V, 49-50.l40Ibid., pp. 9-10.141 We have alluded to the Kâlàmukha attitude to caste above, p. 149.142Ed. and trans.

In the period of Kalamukha dominance in Mysore, which is also the time in which Ramanuja preached, the epigraphs of the PâSupatas and Kalamukhas display many simi­larities. Both sects revere the legendary teacher Lakulléa. The ascetics of both bear similar or identical names and undertake pilgrimages to Kedàranàth and Sriparvata.1 The philosophical content of the îévara-kartr-vâda propounded by the Kalamukha priest Bonteyamuni of HoipbaJ2 can be little different from the Pâéupata doctrine of Isvara as Cause (kdrana) of the Material Universe (karyd). We have quoted above the passage from ins­criptions at Nesargi and Sirasangi which seems to equate Kala­mukha, Mahavratin and Mahàpâéupata.3 Most sources, however, describe the Kalamukhas and Pâéupatas as separate, though closely allied, Saivite sects.4A number of modern scholars have written about the history, ritual and philosophy of the Pâéupatas.

This passage, from the Tantrâloka of Abhinavagupta (c. a.d. 1000), merely says that ârïkantha and Lakulesvara are the two authorities on âiva-sàsana. This is hardly conclusive, or even very useful, evidence.Also following R.G. Bhandarkar, but more plausibly, J.N. Banerjea has suggested that the âiva-bhâgavatas mentioned by Patanjali (c. 150 b .c.) in his comments on Pànini v. 2. 76 were pre-Lakulîsa Pàsupatas.12 Banerjea sees Lakulïsa as the ‘systéma­tiser’ of this earlier Pàsupata order. Unfortunately, this theory finds no support in either of the two extant Pàsupata texts—the Pàsupata-sütra with the Pancàrtha-bhàsya of Kaundinya13 and the Ganakàrikà with the Ratnafikà attributed to Bhâsarvajna.14 In his gloss on Pàsupata-sütra i. 1, Kaundinya (pp. 3-4) says that the Lord assumed the body of a Bràhmana and came to earth at Kàyàvatarana. Then he went to UjjayinI where he imparted the sutras to a disciple named Kusika. This, as we shall see, is a clear allusion to the legend of Lakulïéa. The Ratnatïkà instructs the. devotee to honor the tîrthakaras beginning with Lord LakullSa and ending with Ràsïkara. Thus by as early as the Gupta period, the time to which Kaundinya is generally assigned, Lakulïsa was regarded as the founder of the order by the Pàsupatas themselves. Banerjea’s theory must be viewed as pure speculation. It is certain that Saivite ascetics existed before Lakulïéa, and some of these undoubtedly inculcated similar beliefs and practices. Religious orders are never founded in a vacuum. Wine and wineskins are never completely new. Nonetheless this does not justify calling these early Saivite ascetics Pàsupatas.Lakulïéa was in all likelihood the founder of the Pàsupata order. The sources for his personal history are fairly numerous and varied12Indian History Congress, Proceedings of the Fourteenth .... pp. 32-36.

In addition to the allusion in Kaun^inya’s bhdsya, legends of his birth and priesthood appear in the Vayu15 and Ling a Pur anas}6 the Karavana Mahatmya,17 and three early mediaeval inscriptions.18 The Karavana Mahatmya, a comparatively late work, gives the most complete version. According to it Siva was born as the son of a Brahmana couple named ViSvaraja and SudarSana in the village of Ulkapuri. The divine infant performed several superhuman feats but died at only seven months. His mother put him into the water of a nearby tirtha, and from there he was taken by tortoises to the Jalesvara- linga. He was brought back to life after this initiatory journey to the underworld and later went to Kayavarohana where he took up his priestly mission. In the Vayu and Lihga Puranas Siva predicts, in puranic fashion, that he will become incarnate as the brahmacarin Lakulin by entering a corpse found in a cremation ground at Kayarohana (Vayu) or Kayavatara (Lihga). This was to occur in the twenty-eighth yuga when Kr§na was incarnate as Vasudeva. The stone inscription of a .d . 971 from the Eklingjl temple near Udaipur states that in the country of Bhrgukaccha, the region around modern Broach, the sage Bhfgu was once cursed by Vi§nu. The sage propitiated Siva for aid and the god became incarnate as an ascetic holding a club (lakula). This occurred at Kayavaro­hana.19 The Paldi inscription of a .d . 1116, also found near Udaipur, says that when Siva saw the tree of dharma being destroyed by the axes of the Kali-yuga, he descended to earth at Kayavarohana in Bhrgukaccha.20 The Cintra prasasti of Sarangadeva, a late thirteenth century record from Somnath in Gujarat, relates how Siva came to Lata and dwelt at Karohana as Lakullsa ‘in order to bestow favour on the universe’ and also ‘to favour the offspring of Uluka, who long were deprived of sons in consequence of a curse of their father ...m15Ananda§ram edition, xxiii. 219-224.,6Ed.

It also seems that LakulISa belonged to a Brahmana family and that he travelled at least as far as Ujjain to preach his doctrines.Kayavarohana is unanimously identified with the modern village of Karvan about 19 miles north of Baroda.22 Ulkapuri, LakuliSa’s birthplace in the Karavana Mahatmya version, is modern Avakhal in the same region. The legend of the sons or offspring of Uluka alluded to in the Cintra prasasti is not mentioned in other Sources.

Fleet’s attempt (,JRAS for 1907, pp. 425-26) to connect the inscriptional Uluka with the Mahabharata story of Sakuni, the son of a king of Gandhara named Subala, and Sakuni’s son Uluka is not altogether convincing.The name LakuliSa—with its variants NakuliSa, LakuleSa, Lakulin, and Lakullsvara—is derived from the word lakula, laguda or lakufa meaning ‘club.’ This is clearly shown in the ex­pression ‘whose hand was characterised by a club (lakulopalaksita- karaf from the Eklingji inscription24 and in the epithet Lakufa-pani from the Karavana Mahatmya 25 LakuliSa is thus the Lord (Isa) who bears a club (lakulin), A plain club—not the khatvanga suggested by Biihler (El, I, 274)—is in fact the identifying mark of LakulISa sculptures. D.R. Bhandarkar quotes a verse from a work called Visvakarmdvatara-vastu-sastra which specifies that sculptures of Nakullsa should show him seated in the padmasana, with his penis erect, and with a citron (matulinga) in his right hand and a club (danda) in his left.26 Most known sculptureswere for a long time without sons in consequence of a curse laid upon (his) father, ... settled (adhyuvdsa) at Karohana/^See Biihler, El, I, 274.

Ingalls has pointed out the striking resem­blances between the religious practices of the Pásupatas and those of the Cynics.28 He notes that ‘one cannot avoid the suspicion that the name Lakullsa is derived both semantically and phonetically from the patron saint of Cynicism,’ Hercules (‘HpctrX>js), another man-god who wielded a famous club 29 The physical resemblance, though not the phonetic one, between Lakullsa and Hercules was recognised much earlier by Fleet (JRAS for 1907, p. 424). He suggests that the Indian god ancient Greek writers called Hercules might be Siva and not Kr§na as scholars usually assume. Whether or not this is true in every case, he adds, ‘we can hardly doubt that the club of Siva as Lakullsa is the club of Herakles.’ He also points out that in about the first century a.d. the figure of Hercules on the coins of the Kusanas was being replaced by Siva. On one of the coins of Huviska Siva is shown holding a club.In spite of the similarities in the cult practices of the Pasupatas and the Cynics and the resemblances between Lakullsa and Her­cules, Ingalls (HTR, LV, 296) is forced to ‘doubt that the evidence permits one to speak of a genetic relation.’ Thus he rejects the conclusion of F. Sayre, who, without being aware of the Pásupata parallels, sought to derive Cynicism from India.30 On the whole we are inclined to agree with Ingalls since, as he indicates {HTR, LV, 296), there is virtually no direct evidence of a foreign back­ground within either cult. Nonetheless there are one or two circum­stantial details not noted by either scholar which point to some sort of relationship.Sayre has well documented the Greek evidence for the migration of Indian religion and philosophy to Greece but ignored the evidence for migration in the other direction. His statement (p. 45) that ‘the Greeks were receptive of ideas from other nations while the Indians were not’ has been amply refuted by R.A. Jairazbhoy.3127See ibid., pp. 184-89.

This, we might add, was also true of the Broach or Bhj-gu- kaccha region where Lakulisa taught. At the time of the author of the Periplus (first century a.d.), Barygaza (Broach) was the chief trading port in western India. It seems to have held this position from as early as Mauryan times.32 Gautama or Ak ça pad a, the traditional author of the Nyàya-sütra, is also believed to have resided in this region, and one modem authority has claimed that his logic borrows extensively from Aristotle.33 As we have seen, both the Pàéupatas and the Kàlàmukhas are known to have had close connections with the Nyàya and Vaiéeçika schools of philo­sophy. It is also perhaps significant that Kashmir, the region from which many Kàlàmukhas migrated to the South, was on another important trade route to the West and had been exposed to Greek culture under the Indo-Greeks.Much controversy has centered around the date of Lakulïéa. Fleet (El, VI, 228) originally identified him with the Kàlàmukha priest Lakulïévara-pançlita who presided over the Pancalinga temple in Belagàve in a.d. 1035. Fleet later abandoned this opinion (JRAS for 1907, p. 420) in the light of the discoveries of D.R. Bhandarkar. In view of the references to Lakulïéa in the Vâyu Purâna, a work usually assigned to the early Gupta period, Bhandarkar (JBBRAS, XXII, 157) placed him ‘as early as the first century a.d. at the latest.’ R.G. Bhandarkar dated the rise of the Pàéupata system mentioned in the Mahàbhàrata, and presum­ably Lakulisa as well, ‘about a century after the rise of the Pâficaratra system, i.e. about the second century b.c.’34 In 1931 D.R. Bhandar­kar published the Mathura pillar inscription of Candragupta II (El, XXI, 1-9). This records a donation by the Màheévara teacher Uditâcàrya of two lingas named after his teacher, Bhagavat Kapila, and teacher’s teacher, Bhagavat Upamita. Uditâcàrya is described as tenth in descent from Bhagavat Kusika and fourth in descent^See R. Thapar, Aioka and the Decline of the Mauryas, pp. 80-83, 229, and also K.A.N.

Bhandarkar identified this Kuáika with Kuáika, the disciple of Lakulláa. Since the inscription dates from a.d. 380, he assigned Lakulláa to the first half of the second centuryA.D.This date has justifiably commanded acceptance by most scholars, but there are a few problems and uncertainties about it which many have unfairly ignored. First, neither the word Lakulláa nor Pááupata occurs in the record. It was issued as a request to future Máheávaras to protect and honour the two ¡ingas. Máhesvara is normally simply a generic term for those who worship Siva. Sáyana-Mádhava, for instance, applies it to the adherents of both the Pááupata and áaiva doctrines.35 Saipkarácárya seems to use it for the Pááupatas alone,36 but Vácaspati Miára and Bháskarácárya divide the Máheávaras into four distinct sects.37 The only reliable meáns of identifying Uditácárya’s sectarian allegiance are the inscription’s concluding line of praise to Lord Dantja, who bears the staff of Rudra (Rudra-danda), and the Lakulíáa-like standing figure engraved on the pillar. These render it reasonable to assume that this is a Lakulíáa-Pááupata record, but there is still a problem about the identification of Bhagavat Kuáika. As V.S. Pathak has noted,38 there are at least two Kuáikas among the spiritual descen­dants of Lakulláa. Kuáika I was his chief disciple and is mentioned in a number of epigraphic and literary sources.39 .Kuáika II is mentioned in Rájaáekhara’s §addarsana-samuccaya (c. 1350),40 in the commentary of Gunaratna (c. 1375) on Haribhadra’s work of the same name,41 and indirectly in the Pááupata Ratnafiká^Sarvadariana-sarpgraha, ed.

Although the list is not in strict chronological order— LakulTsa’s four disciples appear to succeed one another—Kusika II must have lived some time after Kusika I. If the Mathura inscription refers to KuSika II, then Lakulisa’s date mint be pushed back about another one hundred years. A Kusika III or IV is, of course, also by no means impossible.LakulISa had three other important disciples besides KuSika. The names of all four disciples are given, with variations, in the Kurma, Vayu and Lihga Puranas,43 by Rajasekhara and Guparatna,44 and in the Cintra prasasti. This last record describes Lakuli&a’s arrival at Karohana in Lata and then continues :His four pupils—KuSika, Gargya, Kauru$a, and Maitreya— arrived (avateruh) at this place in order to (learn) the special conduct (caryd) of the PaSupata vow. The fourfold lineage (jati) of those ascetics then came into being (and) adorned (all) the land girded by the four oceans.45The abbot (sthapddhipa) Karttikarasi, who became ‘an ornament of the gotra of Gargya,’ is then introduced. He belongs tothe early thirteenth century. By this time, it seems, the followers of the four disciples of Lakulisa were organised into separate groups. From the evidence of the Mathura pillar inscription, this division probably goes back at least as far as the fourth century a .d .No records survive of any priesthoods which traced their descent^Ed.

Bhandarkar attempted to connect the third disciple, Kaurusa, with the Karuka-siddhantins named as one of the four Saivite sects by commentators on Brahma- siitra ii. 2. 37.46 These Karuka-siddhantins appear as Karunika- siddhantins in VacaspatFs (c. 850) Bhamati, as Ka{haka-siddhantins in Bhaskaracarya’s (c. 850) Brahma-sutra-bhasya, and as Kala- nlukhas in Ramanuja’s §ri-bhasya and other commentaries on this sutra.41 We cannot accept Bhandarkar’s theory. In the first place, the word Kaurusa is not very close phonetically to Karuka, Kafhaka or Kalamukha. Secondly, there is no precedent or reason for connecting the names of any of the other three Saivlte sects— Pa&upata, Saiva and Kapalika—with the names of Lakulisa’s other three disciples. The followers of KuSika and Gargya both seem to have been PaSupatas. Thirdly, if the Karuka-, Karunika- and Kathaka-siddhantins later became known as Kalamukhas,48 as appears likely, and if they were all descended from Kaurusa, it is strange that no mention of this disciple is found in any Kala­mukha epigraph.By the time of Harsa-vardhana (606-647), and probably as early as Gupta times, there were PaSupata temples in most parts of India.49 The pilgrim Hsiian Tsang met or heard reports about \"ash-smeared (followers) of the outer way,’ i.e. PaSupata heretics,50 at Jalandhara in East Panjab, Ahicchatra in U.P., Malakuta in^R.G.

Chakra- varti, Pakupatasulra, IH Q , XIX, 271). Kdfhaka is a school of the Black Yajur Veda, the Veda to which the Taittinya Aranyaka belongs.49Although several small studies and surveys of the later history of the Pa£upata sect have been published, a complete work is still needed. The puriqic material especially should be examined in more detail. Several of these works show definite Pa§upata influence. A preliminary study of this influence on parts of the Kurma Purana has been made by R.C. Hazra, ‘The Smrti-chapters of the Kurma Purdna ' IH Q , XI (1935), 265-86. The Vayu Purdna has two chapters (xi and xiv) on Pasupata- yoga.

Post-Gupta sculptures of Lakullsa have been found throughout India, although the center of gravity for both sculpture and epigraphy shifts to the South by about the end of the tenth century.54No texts on the ritual regimen and religious philosophy inculcated by the Kalamukhas have so far been discovered. There are, however, several works composed by or about the PaSupatas. In the absence of contrary evidence we must assume that the Kalamukhas main­tained the PaSupata regimen and theology more or less intact.The first Sanskrit sources on the PaSupata system to be noticed by modern scholars were the brief passages in the Brahma-sutra commentaries, the ‘Pasupata vow’ of the Atharvasiras Upani$ad,55 and the ‘NakuliSa-PaSupata-darSana’ chapter of Sayana-Madhava’s Sarvadarianarsamgraha.

Since the oldest extant and possibly original work of the sect, the Pasupata-sutra, is devoted almost exclusively to ritual, it is likely that philosophy was a secondary development. Already in the Pancartha-bha§ya, however, PaSupata philosophy is presented in a systematic form. Since the cult seems older we will outline its basic features first.The ritual prescriptions of the sutras do not have a very rigid arrangement or order. Kaundinya and later writers attempted to remedy this situation and also to incorporate both theology and ritual into a single theoretical scheme. Two rather pedantic systems of classification were evolved—the first best represented by Kaundinya and the second by the Ganakarika.Kaundinya divides Pasupata doctrine into five Principal Topics (pancarthas) : Effect (karya), Cause (karana), Union (yoga), Observance (vidhi) and End of Sorrow (duhkhanta).& These five Topics are described as the central feature of Pasupata (or Mahesvara) doctrine in the comments of Saipkaracarya, Vacaspati MiSra and Bhaskaracarya on Brahma-sutra ii. 2. 37. Most of what may be called the Pasupata cult falls under the heading of Observance.The system of classification set out in the Ganakarika is somewhat more complicated.

These are: (1) the Marked (vyakta), (2) the Un­marked (avyakta), (3) Victory (jaya), (4) Cutting (cheda), and (5) Cessation (nisthd)^ In the Marked Stage the Aspirant (sadhaka) adopts the marks of the sect and performs certain vows. He ‘bathes’ himself and lies down in ashes from a funeral pyre. He wears flowers taken from an image of Siva. He lives in a temple and performs there six Acts of Worship (upahara): laughing, dancing, singing, uttering the auspicious sound huduk (or dumdum), offering homage (namaskara), and pious incantation (japya). All this is to be done only in the company of other PaSupatas. In the Unmarked Stage the Aspirant leaves the temple, abandons the identifying marks of his sect, and actively encourages censure from the populace by means of several peculiar practices, notably the six so-called Poors (dvaras) : krdthana (snoring or acting as if asleep when one is not), spandana (shaking one’s limbs as if afflicted by ‘wind-disease’),64mandana (walking as if crippled), srhgarana (making amorous gestures in the presence of women), avitatkarana (acting as if devoid of judgement), and avitadbhdsana (uttering senseless or contradictory words). The third, Victory Stage is characterised by victory over the senses. In the fourth, Cutting Stage, the Aspirant presumably destroys all his remaining worldly ties.65 The final, Cessation Stage marks the absolute cessation of all exertion, mental or physical, religious or profane.Each of the five Stages is associated with a particular Place (desa), Strength (bala), Impurity (mala), Purification (visuddhi), Procedure (updya), Attainment (labha), and Aspect of Initiation (dlk§akarin) . These form the remaining seven Pentads. The relationship of all these items is best seen in the table on next page.The last of the nine Groups is called Means of Livelihood (vrtti).

It shouki also be recalled that several other Kalamukha priests are described as experts in drama and music.The curious custom of courting dishonour by disreputable behaviour during the Unmarked Stage is the most distinctive feature of the PuSapata cult. It is described in some detail in the third chapter of the Pasupata-sutra and in Kauntjinya’s commentary thereon.70 According to these two sources the chief rationale for this behaviour is the transfer of good and bad karman. The sutras explain it thus : ‘Because of the censure of others, he gives his (accu­mulated) demerit (papa or adharma) to them, and he takes the (accumulated) merit (sukjrta or dharma) from them.’71 Without the censure of others these actions would result simply in the increase of the performer’s own demerit.72 The idea of exchanging good and bad karman, as Ingalls notes (HTR, LV, 293) is common in classical Sanskrit literature. The idea of intentionally courting dishonour for this purpose, however, is very unusual and difficult to explain.Ingalls (HTR, LV, 295-98) seeks the origin of some of the ascetics’ peculiar behaviour in the beast-vows mentioned by the Jaiminiya-Brdhmana and later Sanskrit literature and in other techniques of spiritual possession practised by shamans in primitive societies throughout the world. Without wishing to discard Ingalls’ hypothesis entirely, we believe that most of the psychological and historical foundation for these practices can be found, without going so far afield, in the dominant asceticism complex of Indian religion itself.Courting the censure of one’s fellow humans is, after all, an efficient means of cutting oneself off from them, of achieving isolation and worldly detachment. Under various names this state of detachment is an essential ingredient of Jainism, Buddhism and Upani$adic Hinduism. As we have seen, Removal of Attach­ment Causes (sahgakara-hdni) is one of the five Purifications ins^See above, p. 128.7°Most of this chapter and its commentary have been translated by Ingalls, HTR, LV, 285-91.\"HPdhipata-sutra iii. 7, 8 and 9.“^Kautidinya’s PaHcartha-bha$ya on sutra iii. 7."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"188THE KAPAUKAS AND KALAMUKHASPaSupata doctrine. Kauntfinya himself makes it clear that the cultivation of detachment as much as the transfer of merit is the motive behind the PaSupata’s actions. Under sutra iii. 3, ‘Dis­honored (avamatah),' for instance, he quotes a verse which declares: ‘For he who is despised lies happy, freed of all attach­ment.’73 His comments on sutra iii. 11 are equally explicit. The sutra declares: ‘He should gp about like an outcaste (preta)'14 Kauntfinya comments :He should appear as though mad, like a pauper, his body covered with filth, letting his beard, nails and hair grow long, without any bodily care. Hereby he becomes cut off from the respectable castes and conditions of men, and the power of passionless detachment is produced.1*This type of idea has no place in the world of the shaman. His babblings, animal noises and so forth do cut him off from his fellow men, but both he and they regard this behaviour as a sign of his superior spiritual power. However much the shaman controls his trance, he believes that he is in communication with the spiritual world. The PaSupata’s mad behaviour, on the other hand, is completely feigned and wins only contempt from ordinary men. It is possible that the ultimate source of some of his practices may be found in shamanism, but their psychological basis has changed completely. For this reason we prefer to consider the Pasupata’s courting of dishonour mainly as an extension, albeit a highly original one, of the search for worldly detachment through ascetic penance.76^Trans. Ingalls, HTR, LV, 286.74Trans. ibid., p. 289. The usual meaning of preta is, of course ‘dead person* or ‘ghost.* This may well have been the meaning intended by the sutra although Kauirfinya seems to interpret it as ‘outcaste.*75Trans. ibid., except for the passage put into italics. Ingalls translation at this point seems significantly misleading. The whole of the Sanskrit sentence reads: ato varpa§rama-vyucchedo vairagyotsahaS ca jayate.* Ingalls renders the italicised passage as ‘and gives rise to disgust.’ In the present context vairagya seems more likely to denote the positive quality of ‘freedom from all worldly desires.’ This is the meaning used by Kaupdinya elsewhere in his commentary. Under sutra i. 42, for instance, we find the compound dharma-jftdna-vairdgyadvaryddharmajfidnd- vairdgydnadvarydnam. ‘Freedom from all worldly desires’ would naturally arise in the worshipper, not in those who see him.76Thc acceptance, if not the courting, of dishonour is prescribed for Jain ascetics"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"LAKULIŠA AND THE PAŠUPATAS189One other point about the cult of the Pášupatas should also be noted. This is the great emphasis placed by Kauntjinya, and to a lesser extent by the Ratnatika, on the ten yamas and niyamas or ‘major and minor restraints.’ Kauptfinya defines the five yamas as non-injury (ahimsá), celibacy (brahmacarya), truthfulness (satya), non-trade (asarpvyavahára) , and non-theft (asteya). He defines the niyamas as non-anger (akrodha), attentiveness to the teacher (guru-šušrusá), purity (šauca), abstemious diet (áhára- lághava), and constant caution (apramáda).11 Other Sanskrit works define these yamas and niyamas somewhat differently.78 They form the first two of five ‘limbs’ of Yoga named in Yoga- sutra ii. 2979 and invariably head the similar lists of yogic virtues repeatedly attributed to Kalamukha ascetics in epigraphy. The five yamas also appear to be associated with the epithet Mahávratin as it is applied to Kalamukha ascetics. According to Yoga-sutra ii. 31, when the five yamas are maintained under all circumstances— without regard for caste, place, time, or occasion—they are called the Mahavrata.80The theology of the Pášupatas is a large and father complicated subject which we do not feel qualified to discuss in detail.81 Its basic outlines are summed up in the five Principal Topics (minus the third, Observance, which denotes the cult). The first Topic is Effect (kárya). This is divided into three categories : (1) Cognition (vidyá) including various types of conscious and unconscious mental activity; (2) World and Body Parts (kalá) including the physical elements and human organs, senses and mental faculties; and (3) the Individual Soul (pašu). All Effect is said to be dependent (asvatantra).in the following passage from the Ácáráňga-sútra (trans. H. Jacobi, iv. 16. 2-3): ‘A mendicant, living thus, self-controlled towards the eternal (world of living beings), the matchless sage, who collects his alms, is insulted with words by the people assailing him, like an elephant in battle with arrows. Despised by such-like people, the wise man, with undisturbed mind, sustains their words and blows, as a rock is not shaken by the wind.*77PaHcártha-bhá$ya on Pášupata-sútra i. 9 (pp. 16-33).\"«See P.V.

The PaSupata faith is thoroughly theistic and consequently God functions as the linchpin of its metaphysical system. He is described as the creator, destroyer and supporter of the universe.82 He has two major aspects—one which is immanent and manifold (sakala) and one which is transcendent and formless (niskala) Both are characterised by unlimited Power of Knowledge (jficina-sakti) and Power of Action (kriyd-sakti)** Speech is incapable of expressing his formless aspect84 In his manifold aspect, however, he is called by various names in accordance with his several attributes and functions such as patitva, sattvd, adyatva, ajatatva, and so forth.85 In this aspect he is also said to pervade all Effect (defined as the twenty-five categories or tattvas of Saqikhya).86This doctrine of God as Cause must be very similar to the Isvara- kartr-vada taught by the eleventh century Kalamukha priest Bonteyamuni of HoipbaJ. Although little is known about his doctrine apart from its name, one of the stories describing the miracles he performed during his travels provides the additional information that the Kartr of his doctrine also had a formless aspect. At a great debate his opponents ‘questioned him how the Kartr he defended could be formless.’ In reply ‘he stood invisible (became formless) for a while and made them speechless ...>87One of the most distinctive features of Pa$upata doctrine as propounded by Kaun^inya and the Ratnafika is the belief in God’s absolute independence (svatantrata)** In practical terms this independence means that God acts without regard for human karman (karmddinirapek§a). God’s will is thereby placed over and above even the moral order (dharma). Sayana-Madhava contrasts this view with that of the MaheSvaras who follow the Saiva-darSana. They reject this PaSupata doctrine ‘because it is blemished by the faults of cruelty and injustice’ and hold that ‘the Supreme Lord, the Cause, (acts) in conformity with (human) karman, etc.’89 In other words, the Saiva-darsana God cannot^Ratnafika in Ganakarika, p. 11.83Kaup;linya on Pa&upata-sutra ii. 27 and v. 27.84Ibid., v. 27.

H. Jacobi points out that the Nyaya logician Uddyotakara (r. 620), who calls himself a Pasupatacarya, adopts the Saiva-darsana point of view on this point.90 This shows that at least one important doctrinal split had occurred in the Pa§upata sect by the seventh century. This is by no means surprising since the radical view of Kaun^inya and the Ratnafikd strikes at the heart of nearly all Indian ethical systems, the theory of karman. Sayana-Madhava allows the Pasupatas a rebuttal to the charge that their doctrine of God as an independent Cause would lead to a situation in which ‘human deeds (karma) would produce no result and all effects would be produced at the same time,’91 but their reply, at least as Sayana-Madhava presents it, is not altogether clear or convincing. It does appear, however, that they were forced to temper this doctrine somewhat, although not to such a degree that it is possible to agree with Jacobi (p. 53) that the difference between Uddyotakara and LakulISa (sic) is only apparent.Salvation in PaSupata doctrine is the state called End of Sorrow (duhkhanta), the last of the five Principal Topics. As is to be expected in such an uncompromisingly theistic system, it is achieved only by the grace of God. Sutra v. 40 declares : ‘He who has constant caution attains the end of sorrows through the grace of God.’92 Preliminary to this final liberation, however, is Yoga, the fourth Topic, which Kaun<Jinya repeatedly defines as ‘the union of the atman and ISvara.’93 The soul does not become absorbed or dissolved in ISvara or Brahman as in monistic Vedanta, but remains inseparably tied to God in the state the sutras call Rudra-sdyujya.94The designation of Salvation as End of Sorrow has a rather negative ring. Bhaskaracarya claims that the Pasupatas, Vai£e§ikas, Naiyayikas, and Kapalikas all hold End of Sorrow and moksa to be identical. In this condition, he adds, the atmans are without attributes and resemble only stones.95 Much the same claim is made by Yamunacarya.96 This does not seem to be any more true for the PaSupatas than for the Kapalikas. It is certainly not the90Die Entwicklung der Gottesidee bei den Indern, p. 53.^Trans.

The latter work distinguishes between two types of End of Sorrow—the Impersonal (anatmaka) and the Personal (satmaka). Impersonal End of Sorrow does resemble the state referred to by Bhaskara and Yamuna. It is characterised only by the absolute extirpation of all sorrows. Personal End of Sorrow, however, is a state of ‘Perfection (siddhi) characterized by the Power of Lordship (aisvarya) of MaheSvara.’97 This Perfection consists of Power of Knowledge or Perception (jfidna- or dfk-sakti) and Power of Action (kriyd-sakti). These two are also divided into a number of specific superhuman abilities. The Power of Knowledge is fivefold and comprises extraordinary powers of seeing, hearing, thinking, discrimination, and omniscience. Power of Action is threefold and comprises the ability to act with the swiftness of the mind (manojavitva), the ability to assume forms at will (kama- rupitva) and the ability to act without physical organs (vikarana- dharmitva). In addition, the diman who has attained Personal End of Sorrow gains ten other Perfection characteristics including such qualities as fearlessness, agelessness, deathlessness, and lordship (patitva).9* He possesses, in short, nearly all the attributes of ISvara himself.91Ratnafikd in Ganakdrika, pp. 9-10.^Ibid.

In Sanskrit literature, Kápálika characters mock Vedic doctrines while they either prepare a human sacrifice or drink and carouse with comely female disciples. In the second place, however, some of these same sources suggest that the Kapalikas in fact ritually modelled their lives on a divine archetype, on the god £iva-Kapalin who must endure a lengthy penance to atone for the sin of having cut off one of the five heads of Brahma. This symbolic re-enactment of Siva’s Great Vow (mahávrata) earned the Kapalikas their title of Mahavratins.This doubly archetypal character of the Kapalikas, or at least of their traditional portrait in Sanskrit literature, has made them apt objects of modem academic analysis from a variety of structuralist, symbolicist and archetypicist points of view. Examples of such analysis can be found in the present book, in Wendy O’Flaherty’s discussion of the Siva-Kapalin myth in her The Origins of Evil in Hindu Mythology, and in two articles on Bhairava by Elizabeth-Chalier Visuvalingam.2NEW DATA ON THE KAPALIKAS1.

The most important literary omissions are from Tamil sources. First is the story of Sinittonda, contained in the Tamil Periya Purdnam, a text of the twelfth century.5 This legend relates how a “ Bhairava” ascetic came to the house of the devotee Siruttonda and demanded to be fed the flesh of Sinittonda’s son.

Although the text does not specifically call the ascetic a Kapalika, his character is obviously congruent with the Kapalika archetype.Second is the story of Tirilokacojan, a king of the Cola country, and a group of Brahman Kapalikas from Nepal. This story is found in the late medieval Perurppuranam and has been translated by David Shulman.6 In this tale the Kapalikas successfully persuade the king to adopt a life of hedonistic self-indulgence with the following argument:7 “Your Highness, our home is in Nepal, but we have come here after hearing of your fame and the richness of your country. This is our knowledge: the true source of joy in the world is sexual union with beautiful women. Some say that the world is created by a god, but they are fools; has any one ever seen such a god? There is no immortal deity; only the body is lasting and real. The world is created and increases through sexual union, which is the finest thing there is; and it is enhanced by drinking wine. So discard all this talk of salvation, O great king!”The king accepts their arguments and abandons “ the Vcdic way” with disastrous results for his kingdom. The god Brahma eventually sends the sage Narada to bring the king back to his senses. The Kapalikas then flee the land.Given the rather late date of this text, it seems unlikely that the Kapalikas’ speech is more than a stereotyped argument against heresy. The fact that they are portrayed as materialists as well as hedonists also suggests that the author of the passage did not really know much about the actual historical Kapalikas. On the other hand, the fact that they arc identified as Brahmans and as having come from Nepal is noteworthy. At the least, this reflects an awareness that Nepal was by this time the chief stronghold of extreme forms of tantric religion and that this rather unorthodcx religious current—somewhat like Jcwish-Chrislian gnostic cults—was essentially a phenomenon controlled by elite social groups rather than a popular movement of the lower classes.Another interesting and previously unnoticed reference to the Kapalikas is found in the well-known Nath-sampradaya text, Svatmarama’s6.

Barthakuria.9 Unfortunately, none of them adds much of significance to our understanding of Kapalika beliefs and practices.Recently, Nagendra Nath Upadhyay of Banaras Hindu University has published a monograph in Hindi on Bauddha Kapcdik sadhand aur sdhitya in which he discusses the beliefs and practices of what he claims to be a tradition of Buddhist Kapalikas.10 He has in fact produced a useful study of Buddhist tantricism, some early schools of which do seem to have been strongly influenced by the Kapalikas. It also seems clear, however, that the original Kapalikas were Saivites and not Buddhists. Apart from Krsnacaryapada’s well-known and probably metaphorical references to himself as a Kapalin in his caryapadas,u references .which come from a tradition as much associated with the Naths as with the Buddhists in any case, Upadhyay has not offered, in my opinion, sufficient evidence to justify the identification of the Tantric Buddhists of his study as Kapalikas. On the other hand, Alexis Sanderson, who has been working with unpublished manuscripts of the Buddhist yoginltantra tradition, claims that this tradition should be considered to be “ a variant of the ¿aiva Kapalika.“ 12Mark Dyczkowski has suggested to me that the Kapalikas were simply followers of a Kapalika “ vow” , recruited from various tantric groups, rather than members of a specific “ sect.” Although plausible, this view fails to explain the many references to the Kapalikas as one of several8.

Nonetheless, one must still try to better locate them in historical time and space by means of solid epigraphical evidence.In the first edition of this book I was able to identify only two inscriptions that clearly record donations to persons who are likely to have been Kapalika ascetics (above, pp. 27-28). Both arc from western India. A copper plate grant found in Igatpuri, Nasik District, registers a donation of a village to finance the “ Guggula-puja” at a temple of the god KapaJesvara. The donees were the Mahavratin ascetics who lived at the temple. The donor was the early Calukya king Nagavardhana who lived about the middle of the seventh century a.d. A second copper plate grant, found near Tilakwada in Baroda District, registers a grant made in a.d. to “ the muni named Dinakara, a Mahavratadhara who was like the Kapalin, ¿amkara, in bodily form.” The donor was a vassal or official of the Paramara king Bhoja. One other earlier identified reference to a contemporary Kapalika (here called a Somasiddhantin) ascetic is found in an a d. 1171-72 inscription from the Tiruvorriyur matha in present day Chingleput District of Tamilnadu, although it is not really clear whether the actual donee of record, one Caturanana-pandiia, was a Kapalika or not (above, p. 83).In recent years two other epigraphs have been edited and published which can be identified as grants from and to Kapalika ascetics, although the editors of the inscriptions have not made this identification. The more important inscription was found at Kolanupaka, ancient Kollipake, in Nalgonda District of Andhra Pradesh.13 It is written in highly Sanskritized Kannada prose and is dated in Saka year 973 (a.d. 1050) during the reign of the Calukya (of Kalyana) king Trailokyamalla (SomeSvara I). It records the donation of some land to Candamayya, a servant of Gangamaraja, by a Brahman (vipra) named Somi-bhattaraka. This Somi-bhattaraka is said to be the chief (sthanadhipati) of the temple of 3amkare$vara'(=Siva) in Kollipake.These inscriptions give us the first word portrait of a Kapalika ascetic from a source sympathetic to these ascetics. After a few words whose joint sense is not completely clear, the inscription refers to Somi- bhattaraka as “devoted to the meaning of the Somasiddhanta issued from the lotus mouth (? of Siva).” Somi-bhattaraka is said to be “ sprinkled with ashes; adorned with the six insignia (mudra); and holding a13.

Somasiddhanta can be better discussed after reviewing the contents of the second new KápáJika inscription. The mention of the six insignia, the skull and the khatyanga club provides an important and surprising confirmation of the statements about the Kápálikas made by Yámunácárya and his disciple Ramanuja, both contemporaries of Somi-bhattáraka. In his Agamaprámánya, Yámunácárya claims that the Kápálikas assert that:15The fruit of liberation (apavarga) is attained through knowledge of the six insignia (mudrika-satka) and through wearing them, not through the understanding of brahman. He who knows the essence of the six insignia, who is proficient in the highest mudrá, and who meditates of the Self as seated in the vulva (bhagcisana-stha) attains nirvána. (The Kápálikas) define the six insignia as the karnika (earring), the rucaka (necklace), the kurulala (earring), the sikhámani (crest-jcwcl), ashes (bhasma), and the sacred thread (yajňopavita). The skull (kapala) and the khatyanga club arc declared to be the secondary insignia (upamudra). If the body is marked with these (various insignia) one is not born again here (on earth).In Somi-bháttáraka’s inscription, the reading of the term “ six insignia” (san-mndrá) is not completely clear, but a comparison with Yámu- nácárya’s text confirms the reading, particularly since the skull and khatyanga appear in both texts immediately afterwards. The damaru and other drums and musical instruments arc frequently associated with Saivite ascetics, but they do not seem to have been special insignia of14. mukha-kamala-vinirggata-Somasiddhdnldbhiprdya-pardyQnam [*bha] smoddhulita-sa [*n-mudrd] [*=dra] lamkrita-khaivamga-kapala-ddmaruga- mrdamga-kdhalam sri-brindlha-pdda-pamkaja-bhiamara-mahdvrali-dLdndmbu•rdsi-satya-iapo-nidhi- The starred additions and correction arc my own as isthe translation.15.

Ashes arc of course worn by nearly all Saivitc ascetics.Detailed discussions of the six insignia, the two secondary insignia and the term “ Mahavratin” are found in the earlier chapters of this book and need not be repeated here (above, pp. 2-7,73-82). I would only note here that I do not agree with Minoru Hara’s suggestion that “ the adjective mahat in the mahd-vrala may have had a pejorative connotation” as in the case of the term mahabrbhmana.l6 It is clear from this inscription and from many other sources that the Kapalikas themselves called themselves Mahavratins. It is unlikely that they would have done so if the term was pejorative.In the second new inscription, it is the donee who appears to belong to the Kapalikas, although the identification is somewhat more problematic in this case. The inscription was found in Bangalore District.17 It is written in Sanskrit and Kannada and has been dated in about the sixth century a.d. The donor was the “ Prthivl-Komkani- mahadhiraja” named Durvinlta. In his fourth regnal year DurvinTta gave the village of Penna-ur as a brahmadeya to “ Kapali-sarman, who belonged to the Kutsa gotra, the Taittiriya-carana, and the Pravacana- kalpa; who was a resident of Upakotta; whose rites were characterized by sacrifices with Soma; and who was the son of Agni-sarman.” 18The name Kapali-sarman makes it fairly likely, though by no means certain, that he was a Kapalika. We have noted that Somi-bhattaraka was called a vipra,i.e. a Brahman. Kapali-sarman is not merely a Brahman, he is a learned Brahman evidently well-versed in Vcdic literature and rituals. His association with Vcdic Soma sacrifices is particularly noteworthy since it suggests some possible relation between such sacri­fices and the Somasiddhanta of Somi-bhattaraka and other Kapalika16.

Even granting that Remesh’s reading is orthographically correct, it makes better sense if the text is amended to the reading in the earlier edition."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"222APPENDIX Aascetics.Although Somasiddhánta is discussed at some length in chapter III (above, pp. 82-83), I would like to briefly review the basic argument. In the lists of four (or more) Šaivite sects frequently found in Sanskrit sources, the term Soma, Sauma or Saumya sometimes appears in place of Kápálika. Ksírasvámnťs commentary on the Amarakosa equates Kápálins, Mahavratins, Somasiddhanlins, and Tántrikas. In KrsnamiSra’s Prabodhacandrodaya and in Anandaraya’s Vidyáparinayana, the Kápálika characters are named Somasiddhánta. Several commentaries on Krsnamišra*s Prabodhacandrodaya derive the term soma from sa-Uma or Umayá sahitah, i.e. “ he who is with Uma,” or the god Šiva as the lover of Umá-Párvatl. This didactic etymology obviously agrees well with the sexual symbolism characteristic of tantric Hinduism, but Kápáli- sarman’s association with Soma sacrifices or rites suggests the possibility of a more orthodox, Vedic background to the term.Vinodacandra Šrívástav has criticized me for identifying Somasiddhánta as the doctrine of the Kápálikas alone, suggesting that Somasiddhánta and Nyáyasiddhánta may have been equivalent terms.19 This equation would make it possible to connect the philosophical affiliation of the Kápálikas with that of the Kálámukhas, wno are known to have been mostly Naiyáyikas, but Šrivástav supports his hypothesis with insufficient evidence. In all the so far identified occurrences, the term Somasiddhánta refers to the doctrine of the Kápálikas or, in one or two references, other tantric ascetics. Until further evidence is discovered, there is little reason to connect Somasiddhánta with Nyáya or any other known philosophical school.The image of the Kápálika ascetic in Indian literature is an interesting and valid topic of study independent of its possible correspondence or non-correspondence with historical reality. Nonetheless, the attempt to reconstruct this historical reality is a task of equal or greater value. A. Sanderson’s proposed identification of a corpus of Kápálika texts19: V. ¿nvastav, “Kdpdlik evam Kalamukh: ek ailihasik sarniksd,\" Journal of the Bihar Puravid Porishad, 3 (1979), pp. 155-78. Snvastav fails to cite the most interesting piece of evidence in favor of his hypothesis. G. Tucci has suggested that the term na ya xiu mo found in Chinese translations of Harivarman’s lost Sanskrit work Tattvasiddhisastra is equivalent to nydya-sauma or nydya-saumya (see above, p. 82). Snvastav further speculates (p. 174) that Soma may be the name of the human author of the Somasiddhanta. This is a plausible suggestion but is not supported by any concrete evidence."},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"APPENDIX A223preserved in Nepal has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of actual Kapalika beliefs and practices. Even so, a better understanding of the historical evolution, distribution and strength of the Kapalikas also requires the identification and analysis of whatever epigraphical material exists relevant to these ascetics. The inscriptions of Somi-bhaitaraka and Kapali-iarman add important historical data to what is already known about the Kapalikas."},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"APPENDIX BThe first edition of this book was published in 1972 but in fact mostly written in 1967.1 Since then, a large amount of previously unavailable source material relating to the Kàlàmukhas, chiefly the texts of inscriptions, has been published. In this paper I want to review the more important new material and make a tentative réévaluation of the still largely unsolved historical problem of the transition from Kàlàmukha and VIraiaiva dominance in the Karnataka region starting from the appearance of Basava and his Viraiaiva contemporaries about the middle of the twelfth century.The Kàlàmukhas formed the principal branch of the Pâsupata “ sect” of Saivism present in the Karnataka region from about the ninth to the thirteenth centuries. Particularly under the royal dynasty of the Western Càlukyas of Kalyâna, and to a somewhat lesser extent under the successor dynasties of the Kalacuris and the Seunas (Sevunas) or Yàdavas of Devagiri, the Kàlàmukhas were the dominant religious force in this region. Many Kàlàmukha preceptors claimed the title of ràjaguru to the kings of these dynasties and their feudatories. The rapid and rather mysterious decline of the Kàlàmukhas during the thirteenth century probably had as much to do with the decline of these dynasties as with the activities of the VIraSaivas and other rival religious movements. Unfortunately, the available historical record is not sufficient to raise the discussion on this point much beyond the level of deductive speculations.The numerous inscriptions which refer to Kàlàmukha temples, monasteries and preceptors often reveal much about their religious beliefs and accomplishments. These inscriptions paint a quite different picture of the Kàlàmukhas than that contained in the attacks on them made by their theological and religious opponents such as Yàmunàcàrya and Râmànuja. These attacks, together with somewhat peculiar religious practices prescribed in Pâsupata texts, have suggested to many modem scholars that the Kàlàmukhas were a heterodox, and non-Brahmanical,THE KALAMUKHA BACKGROUND TO VIRA$AIVISM1.

In a recent public lecture, for instance, a leading historian of South India referred to the Kalamukha and Páéupata preceptors as “so-called Brahmans“ and as priests who “claimed Brahman status.“ In fact, except in one or two cases, the inscriptions do not identify the caste of the Kalamukha preceptors, but most inscriptions do claim that these preceptors were panditas well-versed in traditional Sanskrit learning.In what sense, then, can we consider the Kálámukhas to be heterodox? It must be admitted that there is a sense in which any “sect“ (sampraddya or pantha) within Hindu tradition rnay be regarded as somewhat unorthodox since the sect’s very existence is defined by its maintaining certain specific beliefs and practices which distinguish it from the varied, but very loosely specified or defined beliefs and practices of the majority of Hindus who do not profess allegiance to any particular sect. This is true even of the otherwise highly orthodox and “ non-sectarian“ organization of the smdrta Brahmans, who generally accept a specific theological doctrine, usually Advaita Vedanta, and practise a specific form of worship, the pdncdyatana-pujd. The smdrta cult is distinct from most other sects, however, insofar as it is basically domestic rather than centered in temples and monasteries.Apart from this weak sense of heterodoxy inherent in any sect, however, I can see no reason not to accept descriptions of Kalamukha preceptors as orthodox pandits who fully merited their often used epithets pandita and pandita-deva, whatever their caste origins may have been. The elaborate praises of their religious and scholarly accomplishments in the inscriptions indicate that most of the leading Kalamukha preceptors were followers of the orthodox theological schools of Nyáya and Vaišesika and that they were also experienced adepts in the mental and physical disciplines of Yoga. Many are said to be learned in the theological doctrines of their opponents as well, striking evidence both of their religious tolerance and of their skill in religious debate. Often the Kalamukha preceptors are described as “ life-long brahmacarls,“ suggesting that that sect was comprised principally of celebate sannydsins and their lay followers. There is evidence, however, that at least some of the preceptors were married.The inscriptions show that the Kálámukhas were divided into at least two different parisads (“councils“): the Šakti-parisad and the Simha- parisad. The Šakti-parisad was further divided into at least two separate"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"226APPENDIX Bavalis or amndyas (“traditions” ): the Parvatavali and the Bhujangavali, both of whose monastic centers were mostly located in northwestern Karnataka and adjoining districts. These avails were further divided into a number of santatis or santanas (“ lineages” ). The Ittige-santati at Mattikote, Shimoga District belonged to the Bhujangavali while the Muvara-Koneya-santati at Belagave, Shimoga District, and the Belleya- - santana at Puligeri and Hombal, Dharwar District, both belonged to the Parvatavali. The more recently published inscriptions reveal the names of two more santatis of the Parvatavali of the Sakti-parisad: the Siva- lingi-santana with a center at Hippalgaon (Pippalagrama) in Osmanabad District, Maharashtra, and the Kittagave-santati at Tilivalli and other sites mostly in Dharwar District. The chief centers of the Simha-parisad seem to have been at Vijayawada (Bezwada), about 100 kilometers from the mouth of the Krishna River in Andhra Pradesh, and at Kogali in Bellary District of Karnataka. A large number of inscriptions refer to Kalamukha preceptors without mentioning the organization divisions to which they belonged. Probably most were members of one or other of these two parisads.A number of the newly published Kalamukha inscriptions come from districts where their presence was previously unknown.

It is written in Sanskrit, as opposed to the Kannada of most Kalamukha inscriptions, and is dated in a year equivalent to 1192 a.d. during the reign of Mallugi II of the Seunas and the Ralta chief Baljala.7 After a long description of the family of Ballala, it registers some grants of land and money for offerings to the temples of Mallikarjuna and Sarvesvara.

The inscription registers a donation to the Sarasvatl-mandapa of this place by Bhlma-natha, the chief minister of the king. The gift was entrusted to the Kalamukha leader Tatpurusa- pandita, the “ younger brother” of Trilocanacarya and the disciple of Kriyasakti-pandita-deva. Kriyasakti was the disciple of Vadi-Rudra- pandta. The virtues of all four preceptors, and of Tatpurusa’s own disciple, Sfikantha, are recounted in some detail. Several are given the usual list of yogic accomplishments (yama-niyama etc.) and are said to be masters of the orthodox darsanars of Nyaya, Vaisesika, Samkhya, and MIraamsa in addition to being followers of the Lakulagama or Lakufisvaragama.Although these several different spiritual lineages of Kalamukha preceptors from Nanded and Osmanabad Districts were unknown previously, their presence in this part of southwestern Maharashtra dunng the eleventh and twelfth centuries is not surprising. The dynasties which controlled this region during this period were the Western Calukyas followed by the Seunas. Both dynasties, especially the Western Calukyas, were generous patrons of the Kalamukhas. It is worth noting that the zone of greatest Kalamukha strength in Karnataka—approximately Shimoga, Dharwar and Belgaum Districts—was an area of nearly constant conflict between the Seunas and the Hoysalas, who were only rarely patrons of the Kalamukhas, during the whole of the thirteenth century. By the end of this century Ala-ud-din Khilji had begun to bring the territory of the Seunas under his control, which can only have made the situation worse for the Kalamukha temples and monasteries.109.

Not surprisingly we find that kings and feudatories of this dynasty made grants of Kalamukha temples and monasteries located in this region. The important Mallikarjuna monastery at the famous pilgrimage center of £risaila or Sriparvata in Kumool District was controlled by Kalamukha preceptors of the Parvatavali of the Sakti- parisad. Earlier, in the tenth century, a king of the Eastern Calukyas made a grant to the temple of SamastabhuvanaSraya at Vijayavatl (Bezwada) on the Krishna River. The temple was at that time controlled by Kalamukha preceptors of the Simha-parisad.11 Recently, a number of new Kalamukha sites in Andhra Pradesh have come to light from inscriptions published by the Andhra Pradesh Archaeological DepartmentAt Sanigaram in Karimnagar District two inscriptions have been found which register grants to the temple of Kommesvara and its preceptor Lokabharana-pandita in 1128 a.d. and to the temple of Parthesvaradeva and its preceptor Candrabharana-pandita in 1149 a.d. respectively.12 The first record refers to the Western Calukya king Bhulokamalladeva (Somesvara III), his feudatory the Kakatiya Prolalarasar, and his feudatory the chief Repola Kuruvarasar. The second record refers to the Western Calukya king Jagadekamalladeva (III) and the same two feudatories. The names of the gods and preceptors suggest that they were Kalamukhas.More evidence from Karimnagar District comes from Vemulavada. An inscription of 1083 a.d., issued during the reign of the Western Calukya king Tribhuvanamalladeva (Vikramaditya VI), describes the construction of a temple of RajadityeSvara by a feudatory of the king and some gifts made to the temple for the upkeep of ascetics belonging to the Bhujangavali.13 The Bhujangavali, as noted above, was a major subdivision of the £akti-parisad of the Kalamukhas.14 Another inscription from the same town, issued in 1108 a.d. during the reign of the same king, registers a gift for the temple of the god Harikesvaradeva entrusted to the preceptor Brahmesvara-pandita of the “ Simgha11.

A number of recently published inscriptions from these districts deserve some discussion.One interesting scries of inscriptions refers to a line of preceptors associated with the Rame£vara temple at Ramatlrtha in the northern Athani Taluk of Bclgaum District The earliest of these records was issued in 1115 a.d. during the reign of Vikramaditya VI.22 It was found in the compound of the Ramesvara temple itself. It registers a grant to this god which was entrusted to Sivasakti-pandita, described as a devotee of the god Ncmcsvara, an upholder of the prcceptor-lineagc (guru-kula) of Goiakanura, and endowed with several of the yogic virtues often attributed to Kalamukha preceptors. This Gotakanura seems to be the same as the site of Kokatnur also in Athani Taluk. An inscription from Kokatnur issued in 1169 a.d. during the reign of Rayamurari Sovideva of the Kalacuris records a gift made to VidyaraSi-pandita-dcva, the preceptor of. the temple of Svayambhu Visve£vara at the agrahara Korgotanura (i.e. Kokatnur).23 A record found at Umarani in the former Jath State of Sholapur District, Maharashtra, a site not far from Ramatlrtha, registers a donation to a temple of Hemme£vara in Umarani, entrusted to Candrabharana-pandita-deva, the preceptor of the temple of Svayambhu RamcSvara and disciple of Lokabharana-pandita-dcva. The inscription is dated in a Saka year probably corresponding to 1141 a.d.24 That this temple of RamcSvara is in fact the temple in Ramatlrtha is confirmed by a grant found there dated in a year equivalent to 1167 a.d. during the reign of the Kalacuri king Bijjala (c. 1145-1167 a.d.).25 At the instance of Bqjala, the mahcimandalesvara Ftrmadi made a grant for the renovation of the Svayambhu Ramesvara temple.

These gifts were entrusted to SomeSyara-pandita of the puliyarasa monastery. In 1087 another Ratta chief renewed the gifts and entrusted them to Somefcvara-pandita’s disciple Jfiana§akti. This Puliyarasa monastery was located in the town of Huli, ancient Puli, also in Belgaum District. Several earlier published inscriptions relating to this line of preceptors have been found in Huli itself.28Dharwar District is particularly rich in Kalamukha sites. Many new inscriptions relating to previously known and unknown sites in the district have been published, or briefly noted, over the past twenty years.A short inscription found at Anaji in Hirekerur Taluk records a gift of land to a temple connected with the “ Sasti-parise.” 29 This must be the Sakti-parisad. The chief interest of the inscription is its early date. It mentions a local ruler of Banavasi province who is known from other records to have been a subordinate of the Rastrakuta king Krishna II (c. 880-914 a.d.). This makes the inscription the earliest £akti-parisad epigraph and one of the earliest of all Kalamukha epigraphs.

It records, in mixed Sanskrit and Kannada, the construction of a temple dedicated to Šiva as Sávantcšvara by two sons of an officer of the king and the donation of a village to this temple.

Rudrasakti was the disciple of Šaktideva, the disciple of Sarvesvara-deva, the disciple of Kumara, the disciple of Gokarana, the disciple of Vidyábharana-deva.The praise of the first preceptor, Vidyabharana, begins with the usual list of yogic virtues found in Kálámukha inscriptions. He is further called the preceptor of the seventy-seven places (saptáhattarislhánácáryyarum), a master of the four Vedas and other traditional subjects of Sanskrit learning, the upholder of the doctrines of the Lákulágama, a worshipper of the god Šri-Siddhanátha or SiddheSvara of Kabbina-sirivura, a teacher of the Kittakróma monastery (Kittakróma-mathaitadesika-padaH), and a leader of the “ Kálámukha” (Kálámukhasyágrani).The fourth preceptor of the lineage, Sarvešvara, was associated with the god Kollšvara. known from another source to be a temple located at Devasthana-Hakkalu in or near Kuppatur in Shimoga District.

Some slight evidence suggests that this lineage might be connected with the Muvara-koncya- santali of the Parvatavali of the Sakti-parisad, whose headquarters was at Bclagavc in Shimoga District. Much stronger evidence, however, connects the Tilivalli and Devasthana-Hakkalu preceptors with the Kalamukhas of the newly identified Kittagavc-santati of the Parvatavali of the Sakti-parisad whose other main centers appear to have been at Haralahalli in Haveri Taluk of Dharwar District and at Rattihalli in Herekerur Taluk of the same District. The Mallikarjuna and Sarvcsvara temples at Ardhapur in Nandcd District, Maharashtra, discussed above, probably belonged to the same Kittagave-saniati since the preceptor Brahmarasi, who apparently headed these temples in 1192 a.d., is also called “ chief of the seventy-seven monasteries.”Two inscriptions found at Haralahalli in Haveri Taluk in Dharwar District register gifts to the temple of SomcSvara or Svayambhu Somanatha 40 The donee in both cases was the preceptor KalyanaSakli- dcva, who is described as being a “ Kalamukha” of the Kituigavc- santati and the Parvatavali of the Sakti-parisad.

The religious virtues of a Kalyanasakti and his spiritual predecessors are described at considerable length in both inscriptions: Kalyanasakti was the disciple of Sarvesa, the disciple of AmrtaraSi. A later record of Vlra Vikramaditya-deva, dated in 1213 a.d., registers another gift entrusted to the slhdndcarya of the Somanatha temple named Trilocana-deva.41Two newly published inscriptions form Rattihalli in Hirckerur Taluk of Dharwar District also register gifts to a long spiritual lineage of Kalamukha preceptors of this same Kittagave-santati. The first of these inscriptions is dated in a year equivalent to 1174 a d. during the reign of the Kalacuri king Rayamurari Sovideva and his Kadamba subordinate Pandyadevarasa.42 It registers a gift to the temple of Kadambcsvara of Rattapalli, entrusted to KalyanaSakti-pandita of a gurukula of the “ Kalamukhas.” He must have been quite aged at the time since both his disciple and disciple’s disciple are mentioned in the record. The full spiritual genealogy given includes ten generations of preceptors who must have extended over more than two-hundred years. The genealogy begins with Vamadeva-yati, the guru of Vadi-Rudra-yati, the guru of KriyaSakti (I), the guru of Amrtaraii-yatTsa, the guru of Srikantha-deva, the guru of KriyaSakti (II), the guru of Sarve^varaya, the guru of the donee KalyanaSakti-vratipati, the gum of Murujavideva-vratipati (I), the guru of Lakull£vara-deva.The second grant is dated in a year equivalent to 1238 a.d. during the reign of the Seuna or Yadava king Singhana II and his Kadamba subordinates 43 The genealogy of the Kalamukha preceptors is mostly copied from the earlier grant The name of LakuIiSvara’s disciple, Muiajavi (II), who is the donee, is. added, and the names of KriyaSakti (I) and AmrtaraSi are inadvertently omitted.

This title was in fact claimed by several Kàlàmukha preceptors during the reigns of various Western Càlukya. Kalacuri and Seuna kings.44The preceptor Munijàvi II of Rattihalli is given the same epithet, “preceptor of the seventy-seven places” (saplàhattari-sthànàcàrya), that we met in the epigraphical elogies of the Kàlàmukha lineages of the Sàvanteévara temple at Tilivalli in Dharwar District, the Koflévara temple at Devasthàna-Hakkalu (Kuppatür) in Shimoga District (together with several associated temples in this region), and the temples of Mallikàrjuna and Sarveévara at Ardhàpur in Nanded District. The preceptor Vidyàbharana of Tilivalli is given the additional epilhçt of “ teacher of the Kittakrôma monastery” which again makes his connection with the Kittagàve-santati highly probable. This Kittagàve-santati of the Rarvatàvali and Sakti-parisad was previously unknown to modem scholars. Taken together, the evidence from Rattihalli, Tilivalli, Devasthàna-Hakkalu, Ardhàpur, and from Haralahalli in Dharwar District shows that the Kittagave-santati was a major institutional subdivision of the Kàlàmukhas, perhaps rivaled only by the Müvarakôneya-santati centered at Belagàve in Shimoga District.45A collection of the available information about the known organizational divisions of the Kàlàmukhas and their principal centers yields the following diagram on the next page.Academic research on the Kàlàmukhas is still in its initial stages, and a great deal more work needs to be done, particularly in two areas.

The inscriptions contain considerable* information relevant to this subject, but R.N. Nandi’s pioneering studies seem to be the only serious attempt so far at analyzing the available data.46 As it has evolved, Nandi’s position stresses the importance of large land-holding and industrial tcmplc-estatcs as the foundation of the Kalamukha movement and the subsequent rejection of this temple-estate system by the Virasaivas, who were comprised of and led by Smaria Brahmans, farmers and artisans. These groups, he argues, had interests incompatible with those of the large temples. Nandi’s thesis is an attractive one, but he fails to weight the influence of contingent historical events such as the fall of the Western Calukyas of Kalyana and the later takeover of the region by a Muslim dynasty. There is also a need for a more exhaustive and detailed examination of the empirical evidence.46. R.N.

I would like to discuss this latter problem a little further.By the middle of the thirteenth century, inscriptions referring to Kalamukha preceptors suddenly, and somewhat mysteriously, become very scarce. The latest record which clearly mentions Kalamukha preceptors is an inscription from Devasihana-Hakkalu (Kuppatur) in Shimoga District dated in a year equivalent to 1280 a.d. The next oldest seems to be a record of 1252 a.d. from Munavalli in Belgaum District.47 Both pertain to the reigns of Seuna kings. There follows over one-hundred years of virtual epigraphical silence from all the Kalamukha sites. Then inscriptions reappear at many of these sites starting from about the end of the fourteenth century. By this time, however, most of the temples and monasteries are in the hands of VlraSaiva preceptors. The Kalamukhas, who were the dominant religious force in northern Karnataka and many surrounding areas up to at least 1200 a.d., have simply47. Ed. and trans. B.L.

Similarly, see an epigraph of 1292 a d . from Hassan District giving a long account of the life and miracles of a priest named Parvataiya, related to the god Mallikârjuna of Sriparvata, in M.H. Krishna, Epigraphia Carnalica, old vol. 15 (1943), HN 112. An inscription of 1368 a .d . from the Madhukéévara temple in Banavasi, North Kanara District, registers a grant to Bikkideva, son of Lakulcsvaradèva. Another from the same site and same dale registers a grant to Cikkadcva, son of Lakulisvara, who are likely the same two persons (see Vasundhara Filliozat, U Épigraphie de Vijayanagar du debut a 1377 [Paris: École française d’extreme-orient, 1973], nos. 88, 90). These priests are said to be ràyarâjagurus and to have “ the lustre of the autumn moon which swells the ocean of the Siva doctrine (siva-samaya).\" It is more likely that they were Pasupatas than Kalamukhas. The Pasupatas were still active at Tiruvânaikka, Trichinopoly District, in 1584 a d . (See T.V.

SriSailam copper plate inscription.50 Cynthia Talbot has shown that this Bhiksavrtti Matha also had some historical connection with the earlier Golaki Matha. at SriSailam. The Golaki Matha priests seem to have belonged to the Saiva Siddhanta sect.51How can the disappearance of the Kalamukhas be accounted for? Political, social and religious factors must all have been involved. Without a great deal of further research in both epigraphical and literary48. A somewhat similar situation occurs in the case of the well-known former Pasupata temple of Eklingji near Udaipur in Rajasthan. An inscription of 971 a d . found there relates the history of the Pásupata founder-saint Laku lisa (ed. D.R. Bhankarkar, JBBRAS, 22 [1904-07}, 151-65). The Pasupatas continued to exist in this region until at least the end of the thirteenth century. When the traditional Sanskrit history of the Eklingji temple was written, however, the Pisupatas were not even mentioned. See Ekalihga-máhálmyam( ed. Premlatá Šarmá (Delhi: Motilal, 1976).49. Gopal and Ritti, Summaries..., no. 53 of 1945-46.50. See Cynthia Talbot, \"Golaki Matha Inscriptions from Andhra: A Study of a Šaiva Monastic Lineage,\" in A.M. Shastri and R.K. Sharma (eds.), Bajapeya (KD. Bajpai Felicitation Volume) (Delhi: Agam Kala Prakashan, 1987), pp. 133-46. The two inscriptions are edited in South Indian Inscriptions, vol. 16, 7 and in Epigraphia Andharica, vol. 1, ed. N. Venkataramanayya (Hyderabad: Andhra Pradesh, Director of Archaeology and Museums, 1969), pp. 44-51, respectively. Other examples of this transition are cited above—pp. 167-72. A work which might shed more light on the transition is the Mallikárjuna-panditárádhyacarilramu by Pálkuri Sómanálha, Virasaiva text of about the thirteenth century written in Tclugu. See M. Rama Rao, The Temples of Srisailam (Hyderabad: Govt, of Andhra Pradesh, 1967). Talbot (p. 137, also note 8) suggests that the preceptor Parama-sfva of the Kalmatha—who was the donee of a 1293 a d . grant (APRE 244 of 1966) from Lingala, Kumool District, to the god Mallikarjuna of Srisailam—may have been a Kálámukha. The late date makes this unlikely, although the identification of the Kalmatha with the Kallu and Šila mathas may well be correct. Talbot (pp. 140-41) also tentatively identifies the Asamkhyáta Máhěšvaras found at árisailam in 1313 a d . (SII, 10, 504) and 1315 a d . (ARIE 41 of 1915) with the Virasaivas. These seem to be the earliest records (also Sn, 10, 503 of 1312) found at Srisailam proper, suggesting that earlier inscriptions may have been purposely destroyed (see Talbot, p. 140).51. See Talbot, pp. 134-41."},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"APPENDIX B241sources, coupled with fieldwork at the temple site themselves, however, any analysis of this question must remain highly speculative. One preliminary question which is somewhat more tractable, concerns the possible historical continuity between the Kalamukhas and the VIrasaivas. In other words, to what extent is it possible to characterize VIrasaiva beliefs and practices as an outgrowth or further development of Kalamukha-Pasupata beliefs and practices? Writing twenty odd years ago, I argued that “ the evidence suggests that the VIrasaiva movement was a reformist schism from the Kalamukha church with Basava cast in the role of Luther.“52 Today, on second thought, I think this opinion needs some revision.It cannot be denied that there is at least some historical continuity between the two movements.53 To begin with, both the Kalamukhas and the VTraSaivas are worshippers of Siva. Both place special emphasis on the worship of this god in the form of a lihga. Kalamukha preceptors are sometimes called jahgamas or jahgama-lihgas (“ moving lihgas“ ) as are VIrasaiva preceptors. The geographical spread and concentration of the two movements is nearly identical, and many former Kalamukha temples were subsequently occupied by the VIrasaivas. The intellectual centers of both the movements are large monasteries. There are even a few doctrinal similarities between Kisupata and VIrasaiva theology. There is, therefore, a strong likelihood that the jahgamas to whom Basava, then said to be a minister of the Kalacuri king Bijjala (c. 1145-1167 a.d.), supposedly gave large donations from the State treasury were none other than the Kalamukhas.In addition, we have the ambiguous figure of Ekantada Ramayya. He is described as a great ¿aiva saint, without specifically calling him a VIrasaiva, in VIrasaiva literature. The story of his victory over some Jains in the time of Bijjala is described in both the Canna-Basava Purana and in an undated inscription from the Some£vara temple^at Ablur in Dharwar District of about 1200 a.d54 In this inscription Ekantada Ramayya is said to have delivered a sermon in the Brahmesvara temple52. See above—pp. 167-68.53. The assertions of this paragraph are more fully documented above—pp. 167-72.54. See above—pp. 169-70 for further details. The Ablur inscriptions have been edited by J.F. Fleet, Epigraphia /ndica, 5(1898-99), 213-65 {n.b. no. E). P.B. Desai has edited some further Ablur inscriptions relating to Ekantada Ramayya and others in Epigraphia Indica 29 (1951), 139-44. See also Gopal and Ritti, Summaries..., nos. 40, 50-54 of 1948-49.

Was Ekantada Ramayya at that time a Kalamukha? There is really no way of knowing.The SomeSvara temple at Ablur also contains relief sculptures depicting Ektantada Ramayya’s victory over the Jainas together with scenes from the legends of theVIraSaiva saints Jedara Dasimayya and Siriyalasctti and Cangalavve. Ekantada Ramayya is also mentioned in several VlraSaiva inscriptions from other sites in Karnataka. A grant of uncertain date from Kempanapu in Mysore District mentions the VlraSaiva teacher Ekanta Basavesvara, described as a descendant of Ekanta RameSvara, probably the same as Ekantada Ramayya.55_Another inscription from Mandhya District, Karnataka, includes Ekantada Ramayya’s name in a list of ViraSaiva saints. The record bears a date equivalent to either 1280 or 1305 a.d., about 150 years after his famous victory over the Jains.56Nonetheless, the differences between the Kalamukha and ViraSaiva movements are even more striking. On the whole, VIrasdiva theology and Kalamukha or, more accurately, PSSupata theology bear little resemblance to each other. The characteristic sat-sthala doctrine of the ViraSaivas may have become popular only some time after Basava, but in any case it displays little similarity to the pentads of the PaSupata texts. More important, the entire atmosphere of dcvotionalism and of religious and social non-conformism found in the early VTrasaiva vacanas has no observable point of contact with the orthodox scholasticism purveyed in the Kalamukha monasteries. It can even be said the two movements represent antipodes of Indian intellectual and religious tradition the Brahmanic and the anti-Brahmanic, the scholastic and the devotional, Sanskrit learning and vernacular poetic inspiration, pan-Indian culture and regional culture, social and spiritual hierarchy and social and' spiritual equality. Even if we admit the existence of some elements of historical continuity between the Kalamukhas and early Virasaivas, there is no doubt that Basava and his fellow VIraSaivas revolutionalized many of the cultural and social values of the earlier movement. ViraSaivism represented not “a reformist schism of the Kalamukha church” but rather its overthrow. The extent to which later Virasaivas subsequently fell back into a religious and social conservatism similar to that of the Kalamukhas is another question best left to others to discuss.242 APPENDIX B55.
