They are, for the most part, pre­sented in chronological order and so document in their own way my personal journey through parts of the Sa iva and, to some extent, the Vai�l).ava Tantras. Anyone who has travelled on similar paths knows how vast and marvellous the lands of this extraordinary world are. Like a pilgrim travelling barefoot carrying nothing but a staff and pro­visions for the journey, like many other fellow travellers of the past and present, I have been guided and inspired by the wonder of this world. Puting my trust in the principle that \"all things are by nature everything\" (sarvam sarvatmakam), my hope is that the deities of the few sacred sites I have managed to visit will grace me with a glimpse of the All, too vast to grasp except in its individual manifestations. The past thirty years have witnessed an immense growth in the numbers of my fellow pilgrims. Each one of us, without distinction of birth or culture, has been graced. But even as we have been illumined we have been led to contemplate increasingly vaster ex­panses of the Unknown. Self-awareness, Own Being and Egoity The first three essays were the result of research into the devel­opment of Kashmiri Saivism, which was required for the work I was :engaged in on the Spanda school. The first of these is a brief histori­cal study of what can be said to be the hallmark ofKashmiri Saivism. This is the notion that the one, unique reality - which is equally Siva, the Self and all that appears and exists in any form -is pure, universal 'I' consciousness (ahambhava). 9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"5Zl 8oumey in !he CZUorld of !he %nlras Although the Upani�ads had already proclaimed the oneness of the Self - Atman - and the Absolute - Brahman - centuries before, the formulation of this fundamental identity in this way is truly unique in the history of Indian thought. Pataii.jali teaches in his Yo gasiUra that the highest, most subtle object of concentration is the sense of'I-ness' (asmita). But in the ultimate liberated state this gives way to the pure consciousness of the Self (puru$a). The Buddhist Anuttarayoga Tantras teach forms of what has been termed 'deity Yoga', in which the aspirant develops the 'divine pride' (divyagarva) of being the deity. But this too must ultimately give way to the inef­fable experience ofVoidness; that is, the realisation of the dependent origination of all things and hence their lack of independent exist­ence. The Upani�ads teach that the Self is the 'knower' who 'sees' and 'perceives' but, according to Sailkara at least, it is such only in relation to a provisional object of knowledge. The latter appears to have an independent existence only as long as the individual perceiver has not realised his true identity with the one absolute Brahman which can have no outer or inner relationship with any other reality. Once the true nature of the Self is realised to be the absolute Brahman which is 'one without a second', this subjectivity is abandoned. In all these cases the ego is given a positive valency, but only insofar as it serves as means to the realisation which ultimately annuls it. For the same reason Satikara insists that the Brahman is not a personal crea­tor God. There can be no real world that the Brahman may create, just as there can be no object in relation to which the Brahman may be a subject. Just as the Brahman does not create, the Self does not perceive. The Self-cum-Brahman is simply the reality behind illusory creation and perceptions. Although Kashmiri Saivism agrees with Advaita Vedanta that the S&.lf is the one absolute reality, it neither denies the reality of the world nor the ultimate, absolute status of the one God. In the first stages of the development of the monistic metaphysics developed by the Kashmiri masters in the 1Oth century, it was essentially a dy­namic pantheism. Reality is a 'process-less process'. It is a process which, in the temporal terms of its individual manifestations, is a perpetual succession of creation and destruction. In terms of its own essential nature, and that of its manifestations, it maintains its own 10"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"9ntroducHon ineffable identity, unchanged and untouched by time and space. As Abhinavagupta puts it \"the principle of consciousness, very pure, is beyond talk of succession and its absence\".1 The Buddhists also es­pouse a process theory of reality, but they come to the conclusion that the manifest world generated and sustained through, and as, this process is ill usory, which the Kashmiri Saiva schools do not. The earlier ones, the Spanda and the Kalikrama along with the budding Pratyabhijfia represented by the Sivadr$1i ,of Somananda, accepted this paradox as it stands. The bipolar unitary consciousness engaged in this process spontaneously forms itself into all the polarities that sustain the business of daily life (vyavahara) including subject and. object, cause and effect, continuity and change, transcendence and immanence, the one who graces (anugrahitr) and the one who is graced (anugrahya). At this early stage in the development ofKashmiri Saivism, the contradictions inherent in this 'idealistic realism' are resolved a pri­ori by the axiomatic postulate that the one reality is a 'union of oppo­sites'; the prime one, from which all the others are derived, being Siva and his divine power. This view, common to all the sastric the­istic traditions of India, is here coupled with an uncompromising monism which allows for the continued integrity of the male polarity -that of the power-holder- even as the female polarity - that of his power - ebbs and flows in consonace with the rythmn of con­stantly renewed manifestation. And this manifestation is never any­tl'rlng but that of Siva himself. About the middle or second half of the ninth century, Somananda developed this view, applying it systematically to the resolution of the cardinal problems with which philosophers and theologians are concerned and engaging vigorously in reasoned argument against its possible opponents. Siva is Siva because he is free in every respect to act and to know by vir tue of the omnipotent power of his will. By virtue of his power of action, Siva is an agent. As such he is the ca).lse of all things, insofar as effects are the products of the activity of the agent. Similarly, Siva is a 'knower' by virtue of his power of knowl­edge which allows him to know the object he has generated himself into. 1 kramtikramtititam samvittattvam sun irma/am I T A 41180ab. 11"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"5Zl flourney in the CZJ.Jorld of the 'Tantras At this point Utpaladeva, Somananda's devoted disciple, inter­venes to open up what he rightly calls a 'new path' by developing his philosophy to its ultimate conclusion. But to do this he had to depart from the substance model of consciousness. Although everybody agrees, of course, that consciousness is insubstantial, it nonetheless retained many properties of a substance. The relationship between Siva and Sakti can be understood as one be�een substance and its essen­tial attributes. As the foundation of manifestation, it is like the form­less clay in relation to the objects fashioned from it, or the screen upon which the cosmic picture is project.!d. The analogy is particularly per­tinent when consciousness is understood, as it is l;>y the Advaita Vedanta, to be devoid of cognitive activity. A pure lucid awareness devoid of objectivity is like a 'pure' substance devoid of attributes. Indeed, Abhinavagupta would say that it is so much like a substance that its conscious nature is negated. While Satikara boasts of his perfectly inactive Brahman, these monists denounce it as being inert and pow­erless, like a stone. This is why the Spanda and Krama schools, along with Somananda, posit the ultimate existence of a cognative conscious­ness which generates itself into the world and its individual perceivers. From the perspective of these three schools, it expands out to its ob­ject and retracts from it, passes through the phases of perception and flows with the current of its cognative and conative energies, respec­tively. However, the substance model has not been fully abandoned even though consciousness is fluid-it pulses, heaves and flows, like an expanding and contracting gas, waves, or streams of water. Utpaladeva adopts a new, more satisfactory model. Cognative consciousness is like light. It illumines even as it lights itself up. The physical body, cognative apparatus, concepts, cognitions, objects, all that appears in any form is the shining of this divine Light. This is Siva. His powers to will, know and act, already extensively described by Somananda, fuse into the one power of reflective awareness. This is the awareness that consciousness has of its own nature-by virtue of which it is a subject- and of its contents, by virtue of which it is the object. This is Sakti. The interplay between these two polarities is the one universal, absolute 1-ness. This, according to Abhir:avagupta, is the highest, subtlest vie•.v of reality which, although never directly articulated in the Tantras, 12"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"9nfroducHon must be, nonetheless, implicitly accepted by them if Tantric rituals and Yoga are to be effective. Thus he makes use of this insight as a golden hermeneutical key to unlock the innermost meaning of the Tantric traditions he examines. He applied his hermeneutic so thor­oughly that Utpaladeva's brilliant and unique contribution could only be noticed when the time was ripe for a detailed analysis of early Kashmiri Saiva monism, and access was achieved to what remains of Abhinavagupta's scriptural sources. Abhavavada, the Doctrine of Non-being This short excursion into an obscure doctrine espoused by sev­eral Saiva schools appeared to me in the early eighties to be particu­larly rare and unusual. According to this view, Siva, who is inher­ently beyond characterization, is characterized as Non-being. But further research has revealed that, although not very common, this 'positive apophansis' is not as rare as it seems. A major area of research, as yet hardly touched, are the various concepts of Emptiness taught first in the early Upani�ads, and subse­quently in the Saiva and Vai�Qava Tantras and the later so-called Yoga Upani�ads. The interplay between the formless transcendent reality -the deity beyond time and space- and the manifold forms gener­ated within it through its own inherent power is a major recurrent paradigm represented in a vast number of ways. Remeniscent of the early identifications of the Brahman with Space, the image carries over into the Tantras where this transcendental emptiness is the Sky (variously called vyoman, kha, or akasa). Despite the logical contra­dictions, which cannot anyway affect it, the supreme Void is located, as it were, at the end of a long series of lower more 'concrete' princi­ples. The Siddhanta reserves this level for the Siva principle. Simi­larly the Kaula Tantras of the Kubjika school praise Bhairava, the wrathful form of Siva, as the Void which, although above all things and supremely vacuous, is the foundation that sustains all things: I praise that Bhairava who is eternal bliss, supreme, tranquil, formless (ni$kala), free of defects; beyond the firmament he is the supreme Void. Superior to the supreme, tranquil, pure, extremely pure, I praise that Bhairava who sustains the whole universe. 2 2 SM 1/26cd-28ab. 13"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"9l f}oumey in !he CZ!Jorld of the %nfras Although Bhairava is all things (visvarilpa) he is 'more void than the Void' .3 We may define this characterization of the transcend­ent as so strongly apophatic that in phenomenal terms it is even more than the 'nothing' we experience as the absence of something. Su­premely passive and transcendent, and yet attainable by Yoga and even ritual because this Non-being is not a pure antithesis of Being, it is its transcendental aspect. Experienced directly in the most el­evated state of consciousness of the deity, it is not amenable to the binary dichotomy of reason: \"Free of mind and beyond mind, devoid of being and non-being, free of merger and verbalization, devoid of logical cause and reason, what is to be abandoned and instrumental means, scripture (sruti) and example, it is endowed with the condition of non-being (nastikya­bhava ). It is the Void free of defects, the transcendent lord of all causes (kara!Jeivara), beyond the senses and speech; (the wise) know it to be the Supreme Sky. The means to its (attainment) is all this path ofYoga and ritual.\"4 Alongside this passive transcendent there is a dynamic one. Non-being is the active, creative source of Being. In the Void of transcendental consciousness - Non-being - we experience the plenitude of manifestation - phenomenal Being. The Trisiro­bhairava, an important Tantra of the Trika school, explains that the Void of Consciousness (cidvyoman) is the final and supreme plane beyond the gross, elemental vacuum. It is the Void of Siva which is the supreme $tate, Non-being which is the pulse of the experience of Being.5 The Kubjika tradition teaches that the Divine Current of the en­ergy ·of the supramental energy of consciousness courses through the Void of Non-being. The energies of this flux are aspects of the con­templation ofNon-being that leads to the Transmental through which the Yogi becomes one with the supreme deity, his authentic and in­nate nature. As the Manthanabhairava Ta ntra teaches: \"One should 3 ibid. sunyac chanyataram sunyam bhairavam tam namamy aham ll/32ab 4 KMT 19/90-93ab. 5 bhutavyomapadatltam cidvyomantapadam param I bhiivapratyayasamrambham abhavam parama gati� I sivavyoma tu tat jfi.eyam ....... .

(This) is the teaching concerning the arising of one's own nature.\" 6 Similarly, Kalikrama sources teach that the spheres of the five­fold flux (pancavaha) of consciousness -transcendental, mental, sensorial, biophysical and objective -flow through Non-being. Thus what the Ka!Ikrama characterizes as five spheres of emptiness un­fold perpetually in the Great Void of Non-being. Praising the god­dess Kali who is all this, the Tantra exclaims: \"Salutation to you who are the Non-being of all things\". 7 Kali is Bhairavi- Bhairava 's con­sort-whose form is fierce and is established in the essential nature of Non-being.8 Apart from these essentially mystical formulations, occasionally found in many of the major early Saiva Tantric traditions in which Siva is worshipped in his fierce form as Bhairava and the goddess in hers, 'non-being' is also an important logical category. Any entity can be said to be the postive correlate of the non-existence of everything else. This is not idle sophistry. Each thing is specifically itself because it is not anything else. Absence or 'non-being' is thus an extensive subject of philosophical enquiry. For the philosophers of the Kashmiri Saiva tradition, it is also a way of establishing the existence of the Self as pure substratum consciousness which must necessarily exist to ex­plain our daily experience. How is that? If we reflect on what we mean by the absence or non-existence of an entity, we find that it coincides with a perception of a place or sustaining ground devoid of that entity. If we divest ourselves of all thoughts, recollections, feelings, percep­tions and the like, what must remain is their underlying ground - the 'place' where they are absent-that is, the substratum consciousness. , The same reasoning holds good for the entire cosmic order. Its· 'non­being' is the non-finite ground of its existence, that is, Deity. Samvitprakasa, the Light of Consciousness This essay is an adaptation of the introduction to my edition of the Samvitpraktifa by Vamanadatta published in 19 90.

A few years later I noticed a second one in the Central Library ofBanaras Hindu University, where several interesting Kashmiri manuscripts have been preserved. In the mid-eighties Prof. Gnoli was kind enough to give me a copy of the Srinagar manuscript. At that time I was preparing the Stanzas on Vibration, an annotated translati n of the untranslated commentaries of the Spandaktirikti. Amongst them was a commentary by Bhagavadutpala, also called Utpala Vai�I:}ava. A convert to Kashmiri Saivism, he chose to include references from several Vai�I:}ava sources in his commentary to establish, no doubt, that they were essentially compatible, whilst reserving the place of honour to monistic Saivism. A fellow Vai�cyava with strong Saivite influences, Vamanadatta is an important source for Bhagavadutpala. The latter quotes Utpaladeva and so was acquainted with the phenomenology of the Pratyabhijfia, but it is quite possible that Vamanadatta was not. Im­portant key terms, basic to the Pratyabhijfia, are missing, such as the central concept of universal 1-ness. Nonetheless, Vamanadatta's po­sition is very close to that ofUtpaladeva. Consciousness is luminous. It shines as all things. The radiance of this Light is the interplay be­tween subject and object. It is dynamic. But while Pratyabhijfia terms are missing, a key term drawn from the Kalikrama is so prominent that it appears in the title of the work, namely, samvit. This is one of several words in Sanskrit for consciousness. It is highly significant that Vamanadatta should chose this one, for although it is a common term for consciousness in Kashmiri Saivite circles, it is rare else­where. Even so, it appears frequently in the Tantric sources of the Kalikrama, including the Jayadrathayamala, its earliest extensive source. There the main deity is the goddess Kalasarilkar�iQi, a form ofKali, who is identified with samvit which is, appropriately, a femi­nine noun. The Jayadrathayamala is also unusual because it out­lines, here and there and in simple terms, an idealism based on an identity of subject and object explicitly stated in those terms. We know that Vamanadatta was well acquainted with the Kalikrama from references he himself makes in his work. Moreover, a certain Vamana appears as the second teacher in the lineage of the Kalikrama founded 16"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"9nfroducfion in Kashmir by Sivananda (also called Jiiananetra).9 Thus, this Vamana belonged to the end of the ninth or beginning of the tenth century and so either preceeded or was an older contem­porary of Utpaladeva. If this is the same Vamana, his system tells us a great deal about the development of Kashmiri Saivism. But even if our Vamanadatta is not so early, there can be little doubt that his ideal­ism and phenomenology is inspired largely by the Kashmiri Kalikrama. The degree to which it has inspired Utpaladeva remains an interesting point of debate. Another fertile field of research is the peculair rela­tionship between Vai1;)I).avism and the Kalikrama. The Jayadratha­yamala and related early Kalikrama sources present interesting forms of Lak1;1mi, Vi1;)I).u's spouse, worshipped in the centre of a circle of Kalis.

The Inner Pilgrimage of the Thntras Although this study is based on textual sources, nonetheless it is as much concerned with the world 'outside' as the 'inner' one of the Tantric scriptures. A point of contact between these two domains is sacred geography. Many concerns are addressed when we talk about sacred geography. It is a way in which human beings take possession of place. Through it they find their home not only in the human world but also with the deities to whom sacred places ultimately belong. 9 Then I bow at all times to the best ofteachers, the venerable Sivllnandanlltha who possesses the eye of great transcendental wisdom (mahajfitina). I reverence with devotion the venerable Keyuravatl who has grasped all the wisdom born of the sacred seat and wonders in the Wheel of Emptiness.

Established at the beginning of time by the presence of deity and perfected men and women who, descending from th� limitless expanse that is their original home into the world of men, form a bridge to its unconditioned and eternal power. Sacred geography is as much human as it i _, divine. It is more than physical, social or cultural geography. It is the geography of the land in which we live. It is not just space or places, it is our home. Places locate us. They personalize the landscape, transforming it into a familiar place where we are free of the fear of the unknown. It becomes a place where we belong and which belongs to us, recovered from the anonimous expanse or from those who had been there before us. From as far back as man trod the earth conscious of himself and his surroundings, he needed to know at least in which direction he was travelling. First a nomad, the ancient Indian roamed the face of the earth invoking the deities not of place, but of direction. Wherever he went he would call them to offer them what he could and receive from them sustenance, offspring, vigour, power, and all the good things of the world in which he moved. He called his gods from their distant homes in the sky, the wind, the fire, the waters, in the dawn, in the rivers, in all the limitless and sacred landscape that enveloped him and through which he moved with his kin and comrades. He carried with him the sacred fire with which he cooked his food and that of the gods, the fire which, wherever it was placed, became his home and shelter. In this fire he made his offerings, the same fire with which he cooked his food and was, in his ever changing world, the centre where he found nourishment and life-sustaining warmth. Then, with the passage of time, his life became more sedentary and he delighted in a land in which he lived where the rivers and the clouds where like fat milch cows, flowing with nourishing milk.10 10 I do not wish to enter into the controversy concerning the original home of the so-called Indo-europeans. There can be no doubt that the Vedas were entirely revealed in India. Moreover, they contain no memory of some earlier period outside India. The theory that the Indo-european ancestors of the Vedic 18"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"9nlroducHon Here he communicated with the gods, offering them rich sacrifices, lengthy and full of invocations, praise and thanksgiving. Here he could take time to make his petitions and prepare the offerings. But he never lost his urge to wonder and so, with time, the nomad became a pilgrim. Pilgrimage is a rich and varied human phenomenon. It is man's response to the sacredness of places where theophanies- astonishing manifestations of the divine - occur. Necessarily linked to places, they are creative events that originally took place, as Eliade would say, in ilia tempore, at the 'beginning of time', and in those places where gods, mountains, rivers, sacred trees, everything of importance - indeed, even the entire universe - originated. Sacred sites not only commemorate the origins of things, they are also powerful markers of place. In the barren landscape of the Australian desert, they orientate the aboriginal. In crowded urban space they transform it into a living mm:ujala populated by the beings of its sacred sites and the mortals who live and move amongst them. The guardians of place came to be guardians of the home, the village, the neighbour­hood, town, city, state and, ultimately, the entire country, regardless of the boundaries of human settlements. It is not surprising therefore that the first reference we find in the Sanskrit sources to sacred place and its natural human response - pilgrimage - occurs with the founding of the protoype of the first Aryan state. This took place in the early post-rgvedic period praised as the golden age of the Kurus under their king Parik$it, the ancestor of the well-known Janameya Parik$ita of BrahmaJ:.la and Mahabharata fame and of the Parik$ita dynasty of the Kurus. Momentous developments took place in the Vedic culture of the period, including the arrangement of the Vedas in the form we have peoples came from outside India is by no means as easy to establish as many history books assume. Elements of Vedic sacrifice- such as the mobility of the sacred fire -do suggest that the Vedic people were at some time nomadic, but this does not at all imply, yet alone prove, that they were not native Indians. The reader is referred to Bryant (200 1) for a concise, unbiased presentation of the major theories. While he shyes away from reaching any ultimate conclusion, his study does demonstrate that the 'Aryan invasion' theory is far from being evidently the best one. 19"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"91 EJourney in !he CWorld of !he Cfanlras today. The centre of political power and Vedic culture became Kuru­k�etra - the Land of the Kurus. This was the favoured land of the Vedic gods, who flocked to the many sacrifices performed there in their honour. It is in Kuruk�etra that the heavenly river Sarasvati -the Milky Way - was regarded as flowing down from heaven about the time of the winter solistice. The ritual texts make the Sarasvati and her companion the Drsadvati the place of long treks -the first recorded pilgrimages - along her banks to the point where they flowed down from the now-opened door of heaven in the north-east.11 By the middle of the first millenium of the current era the first Tantras are being redacted at a time when other post-Vedic sources regularly refer to numerous k$etras-'sacred lands'- and 'river fords'-tlrthas-by which to cross over to heavenly realms. The sources we examine in this essay are typical of a new order of highly literate Tantric cults that emerged from the eighth century onwards. These, like the earlier Tantric cults and Saiva sects from which they evolved, focused on the figure of the roaming ascetic. But now the places he has to travel to are much increased in number. Moreover, they are no longer just simply called 'sacred lands' -k$etras -they are specific seats -pithas - of deities and meeting grounds for male initiates and Yoginis, their female counterparts. The development of the sacred geography of India we witness in these sources is paralleled by that of their public, exoteric counterparts -the Pura:t:tas. Influencing each other, the latter came to serve as the register and scriptural authority for a vast expansion both of the number of sacred sites as well as the detailed development of the sacred geography of each place. Inevitably, the original culture of peripatetic renouncers had to adapt to the needs of initiated householders and cloistered monks, bringing about the rapid interiorization of sacred sites and pilgrimage. This process, along with the cataclysmic effects of the Muslim incursions into India and the posterior conquest, left the scriptural imprimatur that recorded and sanctioned the history of the development of the sacred geography of the country largely in the hands of the redactors of the Pural).as. The powerful Muslim presence, with the loss of patronage that this entailed, coupled with their active 2 Witzell995: 15-16. 20"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"9nfroducHon widescale destruction of temples, brought about the end of extensive religious foundations. Thus Buddhism with its network of large monastic institutions died out, as did the original Saiva and Vai$l).ava monasteries that were their Hindu counterpart. Wherever this took place Hindu religious culture, fighting for survival, centred itself again, as it had done in earlier times, on small local and domestic cults that could be managed with relatively modest individual and public support. Monumental temples and monasteries were replaced by no less grand, detailed and extensive sacred geographies which integrated the myriads of local cults, great and small, into robust networks that could elude and resist the Muslim determination to conversion. So, although the earlier Tantric traditions had largely been truncated, in the parts oflndia where these changes took place, Tantric deities, sites and rituals proliferated once more and for the same reasons as before and the same public need - protection, personal and political power. But now the enemy was no longer within and the destruction wrought was more terrible. So the deities of the Tantras appeared in huge numbers in the public domain and mingled there with the divine forms already there. Each was alloted a place, and the magnitude of their sacrality and power was no longer measured by the size of the modest temples, shrines and domestic altars they inhabited, but by the power of place from which they drew their energy first and to which they returned it, strengthened. In this way the countless millions of gods and goddesses oflndia could work together, co-ordinated by the network of sacred sites that covered every corner, great ::lnd small, of the vast land of Bharata. Kubjika, the Androgynous Goddess and The Cult of the Goddess Kubjika My first contact with the goddess Kubjika was in 1981. That was the year I got married, and I received as a wedding present from my friend and preceptor Alexis Sanderson a copy of a manuscript of the Kubjikamatatantra. At that time I was still deeply involved in Kashmiri Saivism, but the seed had been sown. In the following years I made regular trips to the Kathmandu Valley in Nepal, as I still con­tinue to do. There I found manuscripts of many more Tantras that came originally from India and liturgies dedicated to the goddess 21"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"91 (Journey in !he CWorld of !he Cfanlras Kubjika, although she is now virtually unknown in her country of origin. It seemed also that she was no longer worshipped in the Val­ley either. There are no temples to her or other outer signs of her presence. Nonetheless, I continued to make enquiries until, in 1987, someone found the courage to tell me that he had taken initiation into her cult. This led to the discovery that the Newars, the original in­habitants of the Valley, true to their strong Tantric inclinations, prac­tice a surprising number of secret Tantric cults, both Buddhist and Saiva. Focusing my attention on the Saiva cults, I was astonished to discover the existence of a 'secret society' several centuries old. It is common practice amongst South Asian Hindus in general to have a family deity (kuladevata), although it is often relatively neglected. But for Saiva Newars their family deities are the prime focus of their religious concerns. Moreover, these deities are all Kaula goddesses whose cults died out in the rest of the subcontinent centu­ries ago. Admitting, as such cults did when they were still practiced elsewhere, numerous local and regional variations, the manner they are worshipped is distinctly Newar. But even so, they clearly retain their original Tantric character and present an interesting picture of how they may have been practiced in the past elsewhere. Similarly, Newar society is of great interest not only to the anthropologist and sociologist, but also, and in a special way, to the student of Tantra. Families, joint and extended, are the fibres of caste, and castes the threads of the fabric of all traditional Hindu societies. In this case, the colour and patterns of the weave are those of the secret, Tantric lineage deities configured spontaneously by the economy of the social order. In short, we find here a unique example of what may have once been a relatively common phenomenon in South Asia, namely, a Tantric society. At the same time, despite the substantial Buddhist presence, Newar society is still largely configured as is a traditional Hindu one. This is especially true of Bhaktapur, which is almost entirely populated by Newars. A large town of about 20,000 people, it retains the social topography of a medieval capital of a South Asian king­dom. In the ideal centre is the palace of the king, around which is the centre of the town where the higher castes reside, to which the fami­lies of the king's priest (purohita) and ministers belong. Next come 22"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"9nlroducHon the craftsmen and farmers, and finally, in the outermost circle on the borders of the town, the sweepers and the other low 'unclean' castes. To all of these people, except the last, access is allowed to the secret Tantric cults. The nuclear castes worship the secret Kaula goddesses directly as their family deities, and their attendants those of the sec­ond circle. Served by their priests (which amorigst the Newars are not necessarily always Brahmins) in conformity with the usualjajmani system prevalent in South Asia, the initiates also benefit through them from the esoteric Kaula Tantric rites in addition to the usual exoteric ones, both familial - the rites of passage - and public - temple and festive rituals. The chief priest, from which the other priests ulti­mately derive their authority, is the king's family priest. These two figures- the royal client (yajamana) and his family priest (purohita) - have been locked together in a relationship of mutual depend­ence, spiritual and material, for centuries before the advent ofTantra. The latter deepened this relationship even further, strengthening it with the double bond and power of both the earlier Vedic related smarta and the later Tantric initiatory modalities. In accord with common practice, the king's deity is that of his country and people. With two faces, the inner secret goddess and the outer public god, the king's deity transmits its energy and grace both in the outer domain and through the network of esoteric familial god­desses who, energies in their own right, are thereby inwardly charged. Thus the king, his goddess and his priest together are the axis of this inner secret society. But there is one more even deeper level and that is the innermost secret unknown even to the king: the goddess of his priest. Here we reach the source of the chain of transmission. Se­cretly - for secrecy fosters and sustains inner power - the king's priest connects his goddess to that of the king. Month after month, year after year for centuries he has faithfully served his lord by rees­tablishing time and again the link between their two goddesses. This is the strange and wonderful vortex of power into which I was suddenly plunged when all those years ago I stumbled upon the goddess Kubjika. Or did she seek me out? Kubjika is the priest's goddess. She is the goddess of creation, and so is relatively mild and erotic. The king's goddess is Siddhalak!?mi, a form of Kali-the goddess of destruction. Her name - Accomplished Royalty (or 23"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"9! fjoumey in !he CWorld of !he Cfanlras Wealth)- reminds us that she destroys her opposite, impotence and poverty. Her awesome ferocity imparts to her royal devotee the power he needs to be king while she draws energy from the emanation of the energy of creation of the goddess Kubjika, from which the king and his goddess ultimately derive their authority. So while the king's goddess devours and consumes his enemies, material and spiritual, the priest's goddess nourishes and replenishes. But since the Malia kings lost their thrones to the Gorkha king Prthivi Narayan Shah, who invaded the Kathmandu Valley in the I 7'h century, the performance and power of the secret rituals of the Malia kings have steadily declined, and with them those of their Newar subjects. The necessary patronage, once abundant, which allowed initiates to maintain the extensive ritual activity their com­plex secret cults require, has progressively been withdrawn. The modern world, which proposes other goals and means to their attain­ment, has accelerated this process. Hardly anybody of the new gen­eration is drawn to take the initiation which burdens them with many obligations and promises, it seems, no rewards. We may soon wit­ness the final fatal blow at the hands of insurgent Communism, which everywhere has been inclement to all religions. The Goddess, in her many secret manifestations, is dying. Hidden in the family temples and prayer rooms of her devotees, her manifestations are quietly breathing their last. But now, providentially, the outside world has been allowed ac­cess to that secret world as never before. The huge libraries of largely Tantric manuscripts collected over the centuries by the Newar kings were first transferred to the libraries of the Ral).as, the prime minis­ters of the Shah kings, and then to the state archives. These, along with many manuscripts piously preserved for centuries by the fami­lies of former ministers and common initiates, have been photographed in the past thirty years in the course of a vast manuscript preservation project financed by the German government in collaboration with the Nepalese. These years have witnessed dramatic developments in the study of Agamic Saivism in general. Progress ha� been made on several fronts. On the one hand there has been a substantial increase in the historical and anthropological data. On the other, access has been 24"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"9nlroducHon cleared in this way to vast reserves of u�edited and unpublished sources, which have greatly swelled the numbers of those to which we had access previously. But as yet not much has been done to bridge the gap between these two dimensions, the doctrinal and its applica­tion. Indeed, the gap, one could say duality, between them has been widened by the increasingly complex theories and reflections that have developed in these and preceeding decades. Scholars, attempt­ing to understand the immense amount of data available to them, surveying the history of the religions of South Asia and the present situation, commonly analyse it in terms of an interaction between two traditions. These have been variously defined, for example, as 'Aryan' and 'non-Aryan', 'Sanskritic' and 'non-Sanskritic', 'Vedic' and 'non-Vedic', 'Brahminic' and 'Sramanic', 'urban' and 'rural', 'literate' and 'non-literate', 'textual' and 'oral'. One could add con­siderably to the list of characterizations of these presumed polarities, a fact which in itself eloquently testifies to the uncertainty in which they are shrouded. To a large degree these distinctions derive from the divergence between what we find in the texts and what actually takes place in the world outside. The Sanskrit texts, depending on their type, are sometimes amenable to this type of analysis in various ways and differing degrees. But unless we find concrete external instances of interaction between these two cultures, we cannot be sure to what degree, if any, the forms we find in the text are not the result of inter­nal, purely ideal developments. In a sense, the texts live in an inde­pendent world of their own. The law books (dharmasastras), those dealing with household rites (grhyasutras) and the sections of the PuraQas dedicated to the description and eulogy of sacred places (mahatmya) are examples of types of texts that are relatively close to the reality 'on the ground'. Others, amongst which the Tantras are prime examples, are much more distant. Out 'in the field' we observe what appears to be the same interaction between two contrasting cul­tures as the one we find in the texts. They seem so closely analogous that what can be said about one applies also to the other. There is however a major difference between the two situations- anthropo­logical and textual. The former is open to empirical assessment whereas the latter is not. We may conduct surveys which supply us 25"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"9!

The Tantras of all schools are well known for their rich and vivid religious forms, but although they often refer to the out er world, the images are largely ideal. It is likely that part s at least of the Tantras were used in the man­ner in which they present themselves, namely, as directly applicable, prescriptive text s.

One of the most distinctive features of the monistic Saivism that developed in Kashmir from about the middle of the ninth cen­tury with the revelation of the Sivasutra to Vasugupta was introduced some three generations later by Utpaladeva, one of the major expo­nents of the Pratyabhijfia school. This was the concept of what, for convenience, I will term the 'absolute ego' . It is a concept of the one absolute reality which is at once Siva, the Self and pure conscious­ness understood as a self-reflective pure egoity (ahambhtiva). It is the transcendental ground within which and through which the entire range of cosmic and individual principles in the sphere of the sub­ject, object and means of knowledge are generated, sustained and destroyed through a process in which its transcendental nature immanentalises itself even as it reverts back to transcendence. The concern of this paper is to establish that it is with Utpaladeva that this subtle and complex intuition of the absolute first appears in the history of Indian philosophical thought. In order to support this thesis and explain how I came to it, I will deal with a number of basic con.cepts, most of them historically prior to Utpaladeva, others new, that have led to its formulation. Our point of departure are the earliest works that can be defined as Kashmir Saiva in the sense that they represent themselves as sys­t matic treatises (stistra) of avowedly purely human authorship rather than revealed scripture. These are the Sp andaktirikti, written either by Vasugupta or his direct disciple Kallatabhatta, and the vrtti on the same that is universally attributed to the latter.

Even so, they provide us with a fairly complete formulation of the nature of ultimate reality. The first thing to notice here from the point of view of our present discussion is that neither the Spandakarikii nor its vrtti take the ego to be in any way ab solute. They fall in line with all the other schools of thought that that developed in India up to then which unanimously agree that the ego- the 'I'-is relative.1 From one point of view, the ego is understood as the ahamkara which is a part of the inner mental organ that processes, coordinates and identifies the sensory data sup­plied by the senses. From a different of point of view it is the 'notion of self'-ahampratyaya. As such it is the conceptualized counterpart of the notion formed of the ob ject in such a way that when we say \"I see and know this particular X\", both 'I' and 'X' are part of a proposi­tion formed at the conceptual, discursive level (vikalpa). It is also the 'feeli ng' one has of oneself as reacting sub jectively to the ob ject as pleasant or painful, that is, as involved in the play of the gw:zas; and so, the 'notion of self' appears in the notions the perceiver forms of himself as happy, sad or dull. Although related to one's own deeper authentic nature in that this is the essential ground of such egoic notions, they are distinct from it. Thus in the Spandakarikii we read: \"No notions such as 'I am happy', 'I am miserable' or 'I am at­tached' (exist independently). They all clearly reside elsewhere, namely, in that which threads through (all) the states of pleasure and the rest.\" Kallata comments: \"The (subject) threads through all the states (of consciousness). He connects them together (in the continuity of the experience that): 'I am the same (person) who is happy and sad, or who later becomes attached'. (T hey all reside) 'elsewhere' in that state independent (of all transitory perceptions). As scripture (declares): '(this) one's own ature is considered to be the highest reality'.\" 2 1 For an extensive account of the concept of the ego according to the major schools of Indian Philosophy see: M.

Own 93eing and egoii!J This view does not posit a pure 'I-ness' outside and apart from relational, conceptual propositions referring to cognitive acts. The ego-notion (ahampratyaya) is the condition of the disturbed or disrupted (k.�ubdha) state of personal existence which is that of the individual soul subject to the innate impurity of ignorance and, hence, transmigratory existence. Thus the Spandaktirikti declares: \"An individual, desirous of doing various things but incapable of doing them due to his innate impurity, (experiences) the supreme state (param padam) when disruption (lcyobha) ceases.\" Kallata comments: \"(The individual soul) pervaded by this innate impurity may desire to act, but even so cannot make contact with this inherent power. However, if the disturbance of his conceived notion of his own iden­tity as 'I' (aham iti pratyayabhavarilpa) were to cease, he would be established in the supreme state.\" 3 This disturbed condition, which is the egoic notion of the fettered soul (paiu), prevents it from abiding in the state of per­manent repose within itself which is its basic condition (svtitma­sthiti), considered, according to this monistic view, to be that of Siva Himself. Freedom from bondage is thus understood as 'the attainment of one's own nature' (svtitmaltibha). This attainment (ltibha) or 'laying hold of one's own nature' (svtitmagraha), though egoless, is not entirely impersonal, as the avoidence of the term 'atman' in preference to the term 'svasvabhava' in the Spanda­karika indicates. The word 'atman' almost invariably figures in the text in com­pounds where it functions as a reflective pronoun in the sense of 'one's own' rather than meaning the 'Self'. For example, in the eighth karika we are told that the senses operate by virtue of the power inherent in one's own essential nature. The expression for this is 'atmabala' that one could translate as 'the strength or power of the Self'. This would not be right as the use of the analogous form 'svabala' in ktirika 36 indicates. There the author says that objects become progressively more evident to the subject as 'his own strength' i. e. the inherent power of his subjective consciousness, is applied to 3 SpKa, 9 and vrtti on the same. 31"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"5ll 8ourney in !he CWorld of !he Cfanfras their percept ion.4 Similarly, objects, perceptions, emoti c.ns, mental images and all else that manifest s objectively acquire a P�ture of their own -atmalabha -because they are grolmded in the universal vibration of consciousness -Spanda-wit h which one's own na­ture is identified. For the same reasons it would be wrong to translat e the expression 'atmalabha' as 'attainment of Self'. In karika 39 the yogi is instructed to be established within himself. Here too the ex­pression 'svatmani'should not be translated to mean 'in his own Self' .5 In the vrtti, the terms 'svabhava' and 'svas\\' ;bhava', meaning 'own nature' or 'own own nature' , are recurrent. ' ve also come across the synonyms 'atmasvarapa' 6 and 'atmasvabl.ava'.7 In one place, however, Kalla!a writes: \"sarvatmaka evayamatma\", i. e. \"this Self is indeed of the nature of all things\". The Self referred to here is the individualli •ing being (jiva). Here, Kalla!a seems to be making use of a st andard expression drawn from the Upani�ads well known to his lit erate readers generally to st at e that the individual soul himself, just as he is, is complete and perfect.

But this need not necessari ly be the case, for virtually all Indian schools of thought accept that the distinctive feature of the subject is this capacity for self-awareness, contrasted with the phenomenological st at us of the object which is never an objeCt of it s own awareness but always that of a subject. There is no need, even, to posit the existence of an absolute Self for this to be the case.

It is one's own essential nature (svasvabhava) as Paramasiva who is free of all contact with duality.15 Thus, an unin­terrupted awareness ofthe egoity (ahamkara) which is that of one's own true essential nature (svasvabhava) is liberating. The egoity (ahampratyaya) which takes its support from the body is destroyed when it is eradicated by the authentic ego.16 \"It melts\", to use Rajanaka Rama 's expression, \"like a heap of snow, by coming in contact with the light of the sun of the authentic ego (svabhavikahampratyaya) that transcends all fictitious supports\".17 At the same time, however, as Rajanaka Rama says, the egoity (ahampratyaya) projected onto the body is not false (upapanna) in th11t it ultimately abides in a reality that is not transitory.18 Thus, according to him, whatever the.

This is so not only in his presentation of the realization of Spanda and its activity as an act of recognition but in his views on the two types of egoity. That this is his personal inter­pretation of Spanda doctrine and not originally to be found in it is confirmed, partially at least, by the absence of this distinction in Bhagavadutpala's commentary which, apparently mote consistent with the Karikti and vrtti, invariably relegates all ego-consciousness to the ' level of a notion. He does this, it seems to me, not so much. as a conscious attempt to keep Spanda doctrine 'pure', i.e. not to overlay it with higher hermeneutical interpretations, but because the view which particularly inspired him was not that of the Pratyabhijfia, al­though he quotes Utpaladeva several times, but the monistic Vai�I).ava idealism ofVamanadatta's Samvitpraktisa. In this work, the sense of 'I' is consistently relegated to the level of a thought construct: it is the notion of 'I' (asmadvikalpa) and nothing more.21 K$emaraja, the remaining major commentator, takes the 'I' sense to be absolute, adding to it further interpretations which, as we shall see, are a continuation of the views his teacher Abhinavagupta devel­oped. Here absolute 'I' consciousness is Sakti, which K�emaraja iden­tifies with Spanda, the power of Siva, one's own authentic nature that infuses its energy into the body and mind. He �tes: \"Even that which is insentient attains sentience because it is consecrated with drops of the juice (of the aesthetic delight-rasa) ofl-ness. Thus that princi­ple not only renders the senses fit to operate once it has made them sentient, but does the same also to the subject that one presumes is their impell�r even though he is (merely) conceived to exist (kalpita).

But he also is nothing if he is not penetrated by the Spanda principle.\" 22 20 Ibid., p.ll2. 21 See chapter 3: Th e Samvitpraktisa- The Light of Consciousness. 22 SpNir, p. 22. 36"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"oe/f-9/warenrus. Own 93etng and egotly But let's get back to Utpaladeva. It is well known to students of Kashmiri Saivism that Somananda was his teacher, as well as the first exponent of the philosophy which was to draw its name from Utpaladeva's Isvarapratyabhijna. Somananda wishes to trace the geneology of his views to personalities associated with the propaga­tion ofSaivism in the TantrasY In this way he not only tries to stamp his views with the seal of scriptural authority but also affirms that they are ultimately drawn from the Tantras. Now, it is in fact true that a number of basic concepts he presents are already taught in Tantric traditions which precede him. But even though he draws from this fund of ideals he nowhere posits the existence of an absolute ego, and in this he is consistent with the Tantras. When we get to Utpaladeva, even though he declares that the ·�w and easy path\" he expounds in his Isvarapratyabhijnakarika is that shown to him by his teacher Somananda in the Sivadr$!i,24 he introduces an entirely new idea, namely, that the ego-sense, that is relative when related to the body, is ultimately grounded in an au­thentic, absolute'ego. Thus as Abhinava tells us: \"The idea that that which manifests as the 'I' is perfect, omni­present, omnipotent and 'eternal being, that is, the idea that the 'I' is identical with the Lord, the subject, the lustrious one ... was not in vogue before because of(man's state of innate) ignorance. This stistra makes people fit to live this idea in practice by bringing to light (Siva's) powers of knowledge, will and action. This happens by virtue of this treatise on the Pratyabhijiia which essentially consists of a series of proofs to justify this idea in practice.\" 25 Utpaladeva develops the notions of the Self and absolute being that were already worked out before him to what he must have thought were their ultimate conclusion. Thus he writes that: \"repose in one's own essential nature (svasvarupa) is the reflective awareness (vimarsa) that 'I am'.\" 26 One might say that here Utpaladeva is explaining in his own Pratyabhijiia terms that the Spanda doctrine 23 SDr. 71107-122. 24 IP, 4/1/16. 2s Commentary on IP, 2/3/17. 26 APS, 15. 37"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"9l {journey in !he CWorld of !he 'Tanlras adopted from the Tantras of \"establishment in one's own essential nature\" (svasvanlpasthiti) implies that this, the liberated condition, is that of the pure ego-identity. Now in order to make this transition, Utpaladeva must intro­duce a concept which finds a precedent in Bhartrhari who declares that the universal light of consciousness shines as all things. More­over, it must be full of the power of speech, otherwise it would not be the one light but the darkness (aprakasa) of its negation, that is, the M!lyic world of multiplicity. This power he defines as \"self-re­flective awareness\" (pratyavimarsini)Y But Bharqhari does not ex­plore this notion fully to reach the ultimate conclusion that absolute being, as self-reflective consciousness, is absolute egoity as Utpaladeva does. According to Utpaladeva, vimarsa operates as the 27 VP, 11124. It is a notable fact that this term, so important in the technical vocabulary of the Pratyabhijiia, is not at all common in the Saivagama. It does not belong to the common terminology of the Tantric systems syncre­tised into Kashmiri Saivism, at least as far as we can gather from the sources quoted by the Kashmiri authors themselves. As an example of the uncom­mon occurrence of the terms vimarsa we can cite the Ktilikula: \"The su­preme power of the lord of the gods whose nature is supreme consciousness is reflective awareness (vimarsa ) endowed with omniscient knowledge.\" (Quoted in NTu, I p. 21). Abhinavagupta refers to the Gamatantra which says: \"The deity of Mantra is considered to be reflective awareness (vimarsa) co-extensive in being with Great Consciousness\" (TA, 16/286). A passage quoted from the Tr isirobhairavatantra reads: \"The supreme Sky (partikasa is said to be the well formed space (su$ira), the lord of the principles of existence, the fourth state which pervades from above and the center. It is the abode of contemplation (vimarsadhtiman).\" (TA, comm. 5/91). While in the third reference 'vimarsa 'clearly has a broad, generic sense denoting the con­templative consciousness that the fully developed yogi has of the supreme principle, the two former references equate vimarsa directly with Sakti. They do certainly refer quite clearly to a concept of consciousness in which it reflects upon itself. But these are the only passages, out of several hundreds quoted in Kashmiri Saiva works, in which this term occurs, and it seems that vimarsa in these passages also has a broader, less specific sense than in the Pratyabhijiia. Thus, what appears to be the meaning here is that the yogi who contemplates the one absolute consciousness does so by virtue of the power of contemplation inherent in consciousness itself which is, as the Tr isirobhairavatantra says, the abode of contemplation. 38"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"oe/f9lwareness.

It is both its universal crea­tive and cognitive power through which it forms itself into the All and through which the All is resolved back into it. Moreover, it is thee ground of all possible judgement and representation conceptual\\ (savikalpa) and intuitive (nirvikalpa), of the contents of conscious­ness in and through each cognitive act, as the self-awareness of a pure non-discursive egoic consciousness. It is this inherent attribute of consciousness which makes it ultimate. Echoing Bhartrhari, Utpaladeva says: \"If one were to consider the reflective awareness (vimarsa) of the light of consciousness (prakasa) to be other than its own essen· tial nature (svabhiiva ), it would be as insentient as crystal even when the light is coloured by seemingly external phenomena (artha).\" 28 This reflective awareness (vimarsa ) is explicitely identified by Utpaladeva with the reflective awareness of 'I' (aharhpratya­vimarsa ), a term we can contrast with the earlier 'notion of I' (aharhpratyaya). It is the 'I' consciousness (aham iti vimarsa) which manifests as the subjectivity (pramatrtva) of the psycho-physical complex, in the notion (vikalpa) both of self and its opposite.29 But as the reflective awareness of 'I' is in itself the very nature of the light of consciousness (prakasatman), it is free of all thought con­structs (vikalpa) as these depend upon the duality of relative dis­tinctions. 30 An important aspect of the concept of vimarsa - which, as we shall see, Abhinavagupta developed into a wide ranging herme­neutical key to interpret Tantric doctrine- is its identification with the supreme level of Speech. Somananda had already done this be­fore, but his concept of vimarsa was much more limited than the one Utpaladeva developed. One of the arguments Somananda advances, in refuting Bhartrhari 's view that pasyanti is the supreme level of speech, is that pasyanti-the Speech which 'sees' -cannot view either itself or the supreme principle without this involving both in a subject and object relationship which degrades it and the 28 JP, 115/ll. 29 lbid., l/6/4-5. 30 Ibid., l/6/l. 39"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"9l fjoumey In !he CUJorld of !he Cfanfras ultimate principle to the level of an ob ject. This would then require another pasyanti to see that and that another leading to an unac­ceptable infinite regress.31 Thus, the perceiver's subjective status as the seer (dr$!rtva) precedes pasyanti as the supreme level of speech. Although Somananda calls this subjective state 'vimarsa', it is not, as it is for Utpaladeva, the awareness the light of con­sciousness has of itself as all things and as beyond them, for that would involve an unacceptable split into the internal subject-object relationship he wishes to avoid. Thus, Somananda explains it as follows: \"Just as the product that an agent like a potter (intends to generate) -a jar, for example- abides as a reflective awareness ( vimarsa ) in the form of an intention (iccha), such is the case here also (with Su­preme Speech). This (supreme level of speech) abides prior (to all things), for otherwise, if consciousness were not to possess a subtle (inner) outpouring (u/lasa) which abides intent upon its task (karyonmukha), how could that desire unfold (and reach fulfillment)? Siva abides as the one who is endowed with the state of this (supreme level of Speech) when in a condition of oneness (stimarasya):\" 32 In short, Somananda maintains that Siva is absolute conscious­ness as charged inwardly with a power that flows through it, even as it rests in itself and expresses itself as a tension directed towards its externalization in the form of the phenomenal world in and through the act of perception. In the following passage, Utpaladeva brings together a set of concepts already formulated before him in his con­cept of vimarsa, identified with the supreme level of speech, to present it in a new more complex perspective. \"The nature of the power of consciousness (citi) is reflective awareness (pratyavimarsa) and is supreme Speech which, spontane­ously emergent, is the lordship of the Supreme Self, the freedom which is the intent (aunmukhya towards both immanence and tran­scendence).

Own 93eing and egoif!J We might notice incidently, before moving on, that this impor­tant passage leaves the way clear for Abhinavagupta in his subse­quent detailed hermeneutics of the Tantras to expound the symbol­ism of the Heart as the dynamics of pure I -consciousness, which he develops in particular in his commentaries on the Partitrisikti. We shall return to this point later. Now we must briefly attempt to tackle the Tantric sources prior to Utpaladeva. Although I cannot claim, of course, to have read all the Tantras that predate Utpaladeva, in none of what little I have managed to study in print and manuscript is there any mention of an absolute ego. While all the other notions we have dealt with concern­ing the Self and its relation to the ego and ultimate reality are attested implicitly in the Tantras, this is not the case with the absolute ego. Barring one important exception which I shall deal with later, which is anyway very ambigious, Kashmiri Saivites do not quote a single agamic source in which the concept appears. One could argue, per­haps, that they did not choose to do so, but this seems hardly likely if we consider the key role it assumes from Utpaladeva's time onwards. On the other hand, a host of other notions that are woven together in the fully developed notion of the absolute ego which we find in Abhinavagupta are found there. It is hard to resist the conclusion that what has taken place is a higher hermeneutic in which there has not only been interpretation and presentation of single notions, but a grand synthesis of various concepts of the absolute, already implicit in the Tantras with that of the absolute ego. There is no point in examining every detail of this process; that would require an extensive study. All that can be done here is to present a few key examples that can serve as representative illustra­tions of this hermeneutic method. We may begin with the sole refer­ence amongst those quoted by Kashmiri Saivite authors from the Tantras that can be construed to be one to an absolute ego. This is a verse quoted by Abhinavagupta and by Mahesvarananda in his Mahtirthamafijari who attributes it to the srika�Jthiyasamhitti.34 In the original Sanskrit it reads: 311f<!041'\"fllfq�l-11«! �: �: mG� I ��OI�dlq<!;lf<!Ol41\"f4 � � II 34 T A, 3/223a-4b. 41"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"9'I 8oumey In !he CWorld of !he %nfras Translated, this means: \"Mantras devoid of the first (letter) and the last (are barren) like autumn clouds. Know that this consciousness of the first and last (letters) is the characteristic of the master.\" . Although apparently insignificant, this verse is extremely im­portant as it is the only one Kashmiri Saivites quote as being a refer­ence to the absolute ego in the Tantras. One may however, under­stand this cryptic verse to mean simply that the adept must recite his mantra mindful of each part, including its beginn�ng and end. Once the adept can maintain an abiding, undistracted state of mindful con­centration on the entire mantra from the first to the last letters, he attains a level of spiritually mindful concentration that makes him fit to be a teacher of others. But Abhinavagupta understands this verse in a quite different, more elevated way, which is explained as fol­lows by Jayaratha in his commentary on this passage: \"The first (letter) is (A, symbolic of the) absolute (anuttara) and the last is HA (which symbolizes the completion of its emission); thus even mantras, if devoid of the reflective awareness of 'I' (AHAM) which is (encompassed by these) the first and last letters (of the alphabet) and are not known to be of that nature, are like autumn clouds -that is to say, they do nothing. [ ... ] While if, on the contrary, they are known to be the supreme vitality of mantra (paramantravlrya) which is the reflective awareness of 'I' they per­form their respective functions.\" 35 What Jayaratha is saying becomes clear when we examine the context in which this reference appears. Abhinavagupta dedicates the third chapter of his Ta ntraloka to a detailed exposition of Matrkiicakra. Simply, this is the series of the fifty letters of the alphabet which is understood to exist as fifty energies or aspects of the universal po­tency of the supreme level of Speech, connected with which mantras are spiritually effective. In the Ta ntrasadbhava, Siva says to his consort: \"0 dear one, all mantras consist ofletters and energy is the soul of these (letters), while energy is Matrka and one should know her to be Siva's nature.\" 36 35 TA, II, p. 212. 16 SSOvi, p. 89. 42"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"oe/f5llwareness. Own li3eing and egoily The Tantras deal with this concept extensively. According to one purely Tantric 37 explanation, Matrka as mantric energy is the source of the higher liberating knowledge of non-duality. This is when she operates as the power of Aghora which makes inner and outer mani­festation one with Her own nature in the all embracing experience of liberated consciousness.38 Ma trka is also the basis of the lower bind­ing knowledge associated with discursive thought when her true na­ture is unknown. Then she functions as the power Ghora which de­prives man of the awareness of unity and obscures Siva's universal activity. Thus, in this sense too, mantras devoid of the first and last letter, and all those between them in Matrkacakra are fruitless. Now according to Abhinavagupta's higher hermeneutics Matrkacakra represents the creative aspect of pure 'I' consciousness -AHAM, that, like a wheel, rotates from A to HA and back again around the hub of bindu -M. There is no point in dealing at length with this highly complex symbolism here which is worked out in Abhinava's commentaries on the Paratrliika. A few remarks will suffice. Abhinavagupta introduces his explanation of the secret the goddess seeks to know from the god by quoting Utpaladeva as saying that \"egoity (ahambhava) is said to be the repose the light of consciousness has within its own nature\".39 He identifies this pure 'I' consciousness with the supreme level of Speech, as does Utpaladeva: \"In the process of withdrawal, the real !-feeling is that in which all external objects like jars, clothes etc., withdrawn from their manifoldness, come to rest and finally repose in their essential unin­terrupted and absolute (anuttara) aspect. This absolute (anuttara) aspect is the real !-feeling (ahambhava). This is a secret, a great mys­tery. In the process of expansion, the changeless, unsurpassable, eter­nal, tranquil and venerable Bhairava is the form 'A'. It is the natural primal sound, the life of the entire range of phonemic energies 37 Throughout this paper, the expression 'Tantric' refers specifically to matters dealt with in the Tantras. Thus a Tantric explanation is the way something is explained in the Tantras. Similarly, by Tantric symbols, I mean those sym­bols which are found in the Tantras. 38 SSiivi, appendix p. 9 n. 82, KSTS edition. 39 APS, 22. 43"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":".J 9l [Journey in !he ClJJorld of !he CfanlrtJs .(sakalakaltijalajlvanabhuta). He, in the process of expansion, as­sumes the form 'HA', that is, Kut}rjalinl Sakti. Then he expands into a dot, symbolizing objective phenomena (nararilpetJa) and indica­tive of the entire expansion of Sakti (i.e. the entire manifestation starting with Bhairava). Similarly, the lowest part of the last phase of objective manifestation (m or nara) has three powers (of will, knowl­edge and action) whose life is the trident of the energies Para, Parapara and Apara. In union with emission (visarga) that is, the energy of (the letter) HA, (the Point) penetrates the Absolute, that is (the letter) A, which is its fundamental, unalterable state, in the re­turn movement.\" 40 Now, while Abhinavagupta understands the reflective awareness of 'I' to be Supreme Speech, the Heart of consciousness, as already posited by Utpaladeva, he adds that it is Matrka which is the vitality of mantra (mantravlrya). He writ�s: \"This reflective awareness of this (Mantric) nature, uncreated ; and unsullied, (the Masters) call the 'I' (aham). It is this indeed that is the luminosity of the light (of consciousness). This is the vitality (vlrya) and heart of all mantras without which they would be insenti­ent, like a living being without a heart.\" 41 Many more observations could be made concerning how Abhinava presents the absolute ego as the highest expression of the ultimate state taught by the Tantric traditions he considers to be the highest. For example, we may briefly observe how he overcodes in ........_ this way the Trika conception of reality. The Trika teachers refer to the Siddhayogesvarlmata as the supreme authority. Quoting this text, just before the reference we have cited above, he says: \"The seed here (of all things) is KutJrja/inf, the life-principle of the nature of con­sciousness. From this is born the Triad (Trika) of the Absolute (A), the Will (I) and Expansion (U), and from this all the other letters.\" 42 40 PTv, Jayadeva Singh's translation, p. 54-5. 41 TA, 4/192-3. In the PTv, Abhinava similarly defines 'I' consciousness as \"\"wonder which is the very nature of the light of consciousness and the vital­ity of Mantra which is the Supreme Speech that is innate and uncreated.\" SICfiPM4 fu �\\llfqCfii'f'Gltiq{cll'i�,-IOI�cfl4:qJi(ifiF(IMI�f'\"lf<:11 PTv, p. 18 of the text printed with Jayadeva Singh's translation. 42 TA, 3/220b-1a. 44"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"oe/f-9/wareness. Own Cf3eing and egotty As all the letters together are the fifty aspects of the reflective awareness of 'I' consciousness, this, the absolute, is grounded in this way in the supreme Triad, or one of its representations, which is taken as characteristic of the Trika view of the one reality. Further on Abhinava similarly presents the absolute ego as the ultimate reality the Krama School expounds. This he does by first declaring that Matrka has a second aspect known as Malini. Matrka represents dynamic consciousness as perpetually creative; Malini rep­resents consciousness as perpetually withdrawing into itself all dif­ferentiation to fuse it into its universal oneness. This symbolism is supported by the Tantras, but, one could say, at a lower level of self­reflection. Matrkacakra is a symbolic cosmogram in which the let­ters of the alphabet are collocated in their normal serial order. Malin! is a different collocation (prastara) of the alphabet in which the or­der is di sarranged so that the vowels, symbolizing Siva's seed (bija), are mixed with the consonants symbolizing Sakti 's womb (yoni). In this way, Abhinava represents Malini both as the choatic pleroma into which everything is withdrawn and, at the same time, as the one reality that, fertilizing itself, is adorned with the flux of emission.43 Now, just as the supreme form of Speech, identified withMatrkti, is grounded in Trika as its expansion, so Malini, similarly identified with Supreme Speech, is said to be Kalasarilkan;;iQI (also spelt Kala­kar�iQI), one of the forms of Kali worshipped as the embodiment of the dynamic power of consciousness in the Kalikrama. In this con­sciousness, Siva and Sakti, symbolized by the letters A and HA of AHAM, unite. Thus Abhinava writes: \"This (i.e. the energy Malini), which is in reality one only and supreme, is She who attracts Time (kalakar$i1Ji) and, by union with the power-holder aspect (of absolute consciousness), assumes the nature of a couple (yamala). The reflective awareness of this ( cou­ple) is completely full 'I' (consciousness) which, by virtue of this freedom, manifests division within its own nature. Three-fold is said to be its form when division manifests, namely, (the Speech) of Vi­sion (pasyanti), the Middle Voice (madhyama) and gross corporeal Speech (vaikhari).\" 44 43 TA, 3/232-3. 44 T A, 3/234-6. 45"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"91 fjoumey in !he CWorld of !he 'Tanlras Although the identification ofKlllasarilkar�ii,li with the supreme level of Speech is attested in purely Krama sources, the identifica­tion of this, the supreme energy of consciousness, with absolute egoity is not, although to Abhinavagupta this seems naturally implicit. Klllasarilkar�iQI is the pure conscious energy which courses through subject, object and means of knowledge whilst abiding in a fourth state beyond them (turiya) that regenerates itself perpetually, even as it rests in its own nature. Thus it seemed naturally identifiable to him with the absolute ego and its cosmic dynamism. But even so, this identification is far from the intentions of the teachings in the origi­nal Krama sources. The Klllikrama teaches that the ultimate state is egolessness and that it is attained by destroying the ego. ArQasirhha writes of Klllasarilkar�iQI that she is: \"Klllika, the one (reality who is such) by virtue of Her being the (universal) process (of consciousness) in the form of the mis­tress of the wheel of the cycle (of consciousness).

Cakrabhanu was the third teacher in the tradition after him. Then from Cakrabhanu, ArQasirilha traced two lineages ending with Somesvara and Naga, both of whom were his teachers and are the fourth in line after Cakrabhdnu. Thus if we date Sivananda as Rastogi does, as living 800-850 AD, then ArQasirilha lived sometimes between 950-1000 AD.

K�emaraja, like his predecessor, Rajanaka Rama, considers the true nature of the subject to be the inner light of 'I' consciousness. This is the inner fo rm of Siva. While the outer form is perishable, the inner form is the subjective aspect which is supreme 'I' consciousness fo r, as K�emaraja says, \"even though the subject resides in its body, it is still identical with the Lord (who is pure 'I' consciousness)\".47 K�emaraja adds a further dimension to the notion of Spanda with respect to the commentators before him by identifying it squarely with the supreme energy of consciousness and this with Supreme Speech and the absolute ego, much as Abhinavagupta does. Thus he says of Spanda that it is the creative autonomy of Siva (svatantrya)48 as \"the perfect !-consciousness (of the Lord) (purr.zahanta) consisting of the higher power A and the innate power HA which encompass within themselves, as in a bowl, all the let­ters from A to KS. That (aham) is the power of Supreme Speech which is the supreme resonance of consciousness (paranada) that is ever emergent (and eternal) although unutterable. It is the great mantra, the life of all, and successionless awareness that contains within itself the uninterrupted series of creations and destructions and encloses within itself the entire aggregate of energies that con­stitute the' cosmic order ($a(iadhvan) made of innumerable words and their referents ... \" 49 To conclude, we may note that others after K�emaraja went on to extend these reflections into the brilliantly diverse world ofTantric symbolism in many ways. Siva is identified with the light of con­sciousness (prakasa) and Sakti with his reflective awareness (vimarsa), and the two are portrayed as locked together in the amo­rous and sportive play of kamaka/a. This is a theme developed by Pul)yananda and other exegetes of the Srividya tradition in their com­mentaries on the Nityli$o(iasikarr.zava and Yo ginihrdaya and in their 47 Commentary on SpKA, 16. 48 Commentary on SpKA, I. 49 Commentary on SpKa, 45. 47"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"9l 8ourney in !he CWorfd of !he Cfanlras independent works. Here we notice how, amongst other things, basic Tantric cosmological models are overcoded with this brilliant new concept. This becomes especially clear when we compare the cosmologies of the Prapaficasara and Saradatilaka, fo r example, with that of the Kamakalavilasa ofPm)yananda. In various ways, all three outline a symbolic cosmology in which ultimate reality is rep­resented as splitting itself up initially into two and three elements to then go on and develop out of itself throughout the entire gradiant of cosmic and microcosmic principles. It is only the Kamakalavilasa which identifies these original elements with aspects of the pure ab­solute ego and sees in their interplay and development its cosmic and transcendent activity. This fact is all the more striking when we ob­serve that the original symbol of Kamakala, that is, the triangle in the center of Sricakra, as it appears in the Nityasorjasikarnava and Yoginihrdaya, is devoid of this representation. Thus we can clearly see how the concept of an absolute ego is projected onto an earlier symbolic structure overcoding it and thus lending it greater herme­neutical depth through a broader and more profound conception of the absolute. In this way the Saktas drew substantially from their fe llow Saivites. Thus, Sivananda, the 12th century commentator on the Nityasoqasikan:zava, and one of the earliest teachers of this line, tells us that his tradition originated from Kashmir. 5° Finally, not only was the concept and the associated Tantric sym­bolism of the absolute ego developed at the secondary exegetical level but it also found its way into later primary sources. Not only do a number of later Sakta and Saiva Tantras take it for granted, but its strong appeal influenced the Vai�J:.lava Paficaratra as well. Thus the Ahirbudhnyasamhita and, more particularly, the Lalcymitantra, both of which are clearly influenced by Saivism, take this as a fundamen­tal conception of the absolute reality which the Lalcymitantra in par­ticular identifies with the goddess who is pure 'I-ness'. Thus the brilliant insight of one man, Utpaladeva, whose writ­ings are more concerned with philosophical and theological issues than with the intricacies of Tantric symbolism, is used to systemati­cally recode it.

In one place however, the author is moved to state his view by contrasting it with that of others when he seeks to refute the nihilist view that Non-being is the ultimate liberated con­dition. What interests us here is who this opponent could have been and what his views were. To begin with let us examine the passage in question. Below is quoted Spandaktirikti 12 and 13 along with parts of the commentary by Kallatabhatta. \"Non-being cannot become as object Of contemplation, nor is there consciousness there; moreover, it is a mistake to believe that one has experienced (non-being) insofar as one has the certainty that 1that was' by (subsequently) coming in contact with determinative discursivity.\" ( 12) 1 For a summary of the controversy concerning the authorship oftheSpandakllril«l, see Rastogi Th e Krama Ta ntricism of Kashmir, Delhi 1979, p. 113-7. 2 See SpKiWr, p. 40, SpKavi, p. 165, SSuva, p.2, and SSuvi, p. 1-2. 3 SpKavi, p.19. 51"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"91 8oumey In the CWorld of !he %nlras Commentary: \"One should not contemplate non-being as other yogis teach (who say): 'Non-being is to be contemplated until one identifies one­self with it'. \"In fact this (doctrine) is unsound (for two reasons: firstly) be­cause it is wrong to apply (oneself) to the contemplation (bhavana) of non-being, as it is in fact nothing but a state of unconsciousness; and also because later (once it is over) and one is again affected by discursive thought (abhiyogasampar$a) one recalls that: 'my state of emptiness has passed'. Nor is that one's own essential nature (atma­svabhava) insofar as the conscious nature is not remembered in the way one does a state of unconsciousness, but is (in fact) experienced as the experiencing subject, being as it is ever manifest (nityodita). \"Therefore one should consider that (state) to be created and artifical like the state of deep sleep.

All we know is that he is a yogi and his aim, according to the passage Kallata quotes apparently drawn from scripture, is to be­come of the nature ofNon-existence. Of the three commentators,4 only �emaraja chooses to identify the opponent here while RiljAnaka Rilma avoids the problem altogether by simply saying that these verses are intended for those who may be misled into thinking that, because the Self is devoid of all the qualities of objectivity, the teaching is that 'Non-being' is the goal.5 Bhagavadutpala is more definite, al-4 Apart from Kallatabhana the commentaries of three other authors survive namely, the Spandakilrikilvivrti by Rajanaka Rama, the Spandapradipikil by Bhagavadutpala, the Spandanir1)aya and Spandasarhdoha by K$emaraja.

He says that these verses are meant to refute the view of the partisans of the doctrine of voidness who maintain that Non-being is the object of contemplation with which the yogi should become one.6 �emaraja, however, clearly states that the opponents are three; namely, the S11nyavadin Buddhists, the fo llowers ofAlq;apada, and the Vedantins who base their views on the Upani$adic dictum \"in the beginning there was non-being (asat)\".1 Certainly all these are pos­sible opponents from the Kashmiri Saiva point of view. K$emaraja refers to them together characterizing their highest state as deep sleep, saying \"many philosophers like the Vedantins, Naiyayikas, the fo llow­ers of the Samkhya, the Buddhists and others have fallen into this great and uncrossable ocean of insentience in the form of the void.\" 8 We suggest, however, that it is possible that the original oppo­nents did not belong to these groups but were in fact also Saivites themselves. Although not a well known doctrine, Non-being has at times figured as the supreme principle identified with the Emptiness (sunya) of indeterminate consciousness. Thus according to the Vijnanabhairava: \"That which is not an object of knowledge cannot be grasped, and, as the emptiness established in Non-being, that should all be contemplated (bhavya) as being Bhairava, at the end of which (the yogi experiences) the arising of consciousness.\" 9 In the Manthanabhairavatantra, the supreme Kaula reality which encompasses the union of Siva and Sakti - Akula and Kula -is praised as \"eternally manifest, without master and devoid of any in­herent being\".10 The Jiianamrtarasayana, quoted in Sivopadhyaya 's commentary on the Vijnanabhairava, exalts \"Non-being established in Being\" as \"the supreme principle beyond (all) principles\". 11 Even Utpaladeva, the well-known exponent of the Pratyabhijfia who as-6 SpPra, p.lOl. 7 ChllnUp, 3/ll/1.

Siva the Supreme God and ultimate principle is generally, in this work, represented in positive terms. We do find, however, that in places when the Tantra attempts to express the transcendent acosrnic nature of the supreme reality, it finds no better way to do so than in terms of the absence of phenomenal Being. Again, Abhiiva -Non­being- is a term in the SvT for the supreme reality equated with Siva, understood as both transcendent Non-being and present in all things as their essential nature as 'pure Being' (sattiimatra). Non-being is there­fore to be understood as reality which is not merely phenomenally ex­istent. Reality is pure Being which is Non-being. In one place this point is made by contrasting the wisdom of logic and other worldly (/aukika) philosophies, which are binding, to knowledge of Siva (Sivaj iiana): \"All the goals achieved by fo llowing worldly and other doctrines are effortlessly attained when the knowledge of Siva that comes into effect at the end of Atimarga arises. 0 goddess! Everyone does not achieve it for it is extremely pure and brings about union (yoga) in the Supreme Abode which is that ofNon-being. Non-being is beyond contemplation and its domain is beyond the universe. Free of the mind, intellect and the rest, it is devoid of reason and doctrine. It is the imperishable Lord, beyond perception and the other means of knowl­edge, beyond all reason and authority, free of bondage and mantra, omniscient, omnipresent, tranquil, pure and free of accidents.\" 13 Non-being is again presented as the supreme state in another section in the SvT which deals with the progressive rise of conscious­ness through the phases of the syllable 'OM' in consonance with the pervasions of the vital breath through the centers of the body, each presided over by a deity termed a 'karar:za' -meaning 'instrument' - representing an aspect of the universal cause of creation and de­struction. The process is termed \"the abandonment of the instruments\" 12 Quoted by K�emaraja in his commentary on SSt, 12113. 13 SvT, 11/190-3. 54"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"9/bhaoaoada. !he CfJoclrine of 9ron-93eing because, as consciousness in the form of the vital breath rises from one to the other, the lower is abandoned for the higher.

Here the yogi experiences the \"equalness of flavour\" (samarasa) of all things. This is because his consciousness is not directed at a spe­cific object (mantavya). Thus his mind abides in a state of pure inde­terminate awareness (mananamiitra). By going beyond this level the yogi's consciousness becomes pure, and by resting in· the power of the Transmental (unmanii), which is the undivided Light that illumines the entire universe, he attains Siva.15 In this way, the yogi goes be­yond even the level Beyond Mind and so abandons the six instru­ments and merges into the seventh which is Paramasiva beyond them. According to the SvT this is: \"extremely subtle, the supreme state (bhava) said to be Non-being (abhava).\" �emaraja comments: \"The supreme state is the supreme being (sattii) ofParamasiva. It should be known to be extremely subtle and the universal cause which, because its nature consists of the cessa­tion (pralcyaya) of all being, is Non-being.\" 16 Thus Unmana- the Transmental - in relation to this state is lower insofar as it is the 14 SvT, 4/262-6. 15 SvT, II, p. 166. 16 SvT, 4/268b and commentary. 55"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"9l 8oumey in !he CUJorld of !he Cfanlras reflective awareness of one's own nature directed in a subtle way (kirizcidaunmukhya) to its realization.

Thus while contemplation of the other lower phases in the development of OM bestow yogic powers (siddhi) of an increasing order of perfection, it alone bestows liberation directly. Therefore the Tantra enjoins that the yogi should constantly contem­plate the supreme and subtle Non-being by means of the Transmental.18 This is because Non-being is beyond all the senses and mind and is, according to �emaraja, the pure knower which has no objectively distinguishable characteristics (alalcyya). The Tantra concludes: \"Non-being should be contemplated by means ofBeing having rendered Being without foundation. (In this way) one attains the plane of Non-being free of all limitation. This is the abandonment of the instruments.\" K�emaraja comments: \"The plane whose nature is Non­being is that in which no phenomenal entities (bhtivti/:1) exist. It should be contemplated by Being which is Supreme Being (parasattti) of the nature of consciousness. (In response to the query) 'surely the consciousness\"principle is that which bestows being?'

This is rendered without foundation and free of support in its tranquil (i.e. unmanifest) state by penetrating into the abode of power thus rendering it of the nature (of the Transmental).\" 19 The same theme is again taken up a little further on when the Tantra comes to deal with the nature of the Vo ids. These are seven within which are distributed the phases of OM. As before, six levels are to be transcended and merged into the seventh which is \"supremely subtle and devoid of all states\".2° The lower Vo ids are impure because they are unstable. Similarly the sixth Void, which is that of the Transmental, although Sakti and as such the way to achieve the high-17 Ibid. 18 Ibid., 4/277a. 19 SvT, II, p.l78. 20 SvT, 4/292a. 56"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"<Jlbhaoaoada. !he 9Joclrine of 9'ton-93eing est Vo id, is below it.

It is the seventh Vo id which is Non-being.22 The SvT declares \"that which is not void is called the Void, while the Vo id is said to be Non-being. Non-being is taught to be that wherein existing things have ceased to exist. (It is) pure Being (satttimtitra) supremely tranquil. That (transcendental) place abides in a certain undefinable manner.\" 23 K�emaraja is quick to point out that what is meant here by 'Non­being' is the principle of consciousness (cittattva) and that it is not 'empty' in the sense of being nothing at all, but is called the Void because in it all objectivity ceases. There can be little doubt, however, that the Tantra is here extolling Non-being as the supreme principle which is subtle beyond all levels of subtlety. It pervades the gross lower levels and in so doing itself becomes gross and subtle. 24 In short, Non-being is the pure Being which both transcends and con­stitutes all levels of existence. Although called Non-being and is said to be 'empty' it should not be confused with a mere nothing. Although the presentation of the supreme principle in such strongly apophatic terms is not common in the Saivagamas, it is not exclusive to the SvT. The Ta ntrasadbhava, a work known and quoted by Kashmiri Saiva authors/5 elaborates further. It quotes wholesale 21 The expression 'kiiicicca/atva' in the text refers to Spanda-the vibration of consciousness. The term Spanda is derived from the root 'spadi'which is defined in this way in the dhtitupti{ha which is traditionally quoted to define the meaning of the term Spanda. See e.g. SpPra, p. 84. 22 Worth noting here is that in so far as Unmanli is equivalent to Spanda, according to the SvT the supreme level which is immobile (avicala) and Non­being is beyond Spanda- a view which Spanda doctrine naturally rejects. 23 SvT, 4/292b-3. 24 Ibid., 4/294-5. 2s For the numerous quotations from the Ta ntrasadbhava in Kashrniri Saiva works refer to LAS, vol.

KuJ:19alini's rise liber­ates from the ignorance that consciousness is exclusively located in the physical body and so leads to the realization of the all-pervasive nature of the Self, a state technically termed Atmavyiipti. This state spontaneously leads to the realization of Siva's pervasive presence termed Sivavyiipti and the yogi established in Sakti is thus estab­lished in his authentic nature (svabhiivastha). This is a state beyond all states and levels including the contemplation of emptiness (sunyabhiiva) as well as Siva and Sakti.26lt is achieved by abandon­ing all dichotomizing thought processes (vikalpa), including the thought of liberation. The contrast felt to exist between bondage (amolcya) and liberation is just a thought construct. The notion of duality (dvaitabhiiva), conceived spontaneously by the mind, causes limiting conditions to prosper. In order to achieve liberation the yogi must abandon all being (bhiiva) by forsaking the notion of existence for it is that which generates phenomenal beingY Moreover, the yogi is to abandon all sense of personal existence along with that of everything else: \"The notion of self-existence (mamatva) should in every cir­cumstance be abandoned; one should consider (only) that 'I am not'.

This is done by first abandoning all existent things and states of being (bhava). The mind thus freed of thought-constructs is established in Non­being (abhava). This is not, however, the end of the path. The yogi must also abandon Non-being and become established in the authentic Being which is his true nature (svabhava). In this way the mind (manobindu) disappears instantly like a drop in a mass ofwater.30 Thus the yogi is to abandon attachment both to the world of thought and sensations as well as to the tranquil (santa) state ofNon-being to enter the supreme abode that, free of the subject who impels and the object of impulse, is beyond the contemplation of Non-being (abhavabhavanatlta).31 29 etat samkalpasamghti.tam tava sambodhakiiral}am I advaitanirvikalpan tu nirindriyam ala/cyal}am II alak$asya kuto lak$o amanasya kuto mana& I amane pratyavasthti.mam kartavyam satatam budhai/:1 II nastitvam vartate nityam astitvan tu parityaj et I nastf.tvam moJcyo mahavardha/:1 sarvasunyeva bhavayet II gha{avad bhatigurakaram vidyuddarsanasannibham I sarvatyajyamaye 'lcyaye nastikye tu manam kuru II Ta ntrasadbhava, fo lio 16a 30 ibid., fo lio I Sa. 31 abhavabhavanatitam codyacodokavarjitam I Ibid. folio 18a. 59"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"9l F}oumey in !he CWorld of !he Cfanlras The expression abhtivabhtivanti - 'the contemplation of Non­being'- referring to a state of contemplative observation (samtidhi) in which all sensory and mental activity ceases, is very significant for our study. Kallata makes use of it as do all the other commentators on the Spandakarikti, thus leaving us in no doubt that this is a standard technical term. This contemplative state is not considered to be ultimate in the Ta ntrasadbhtiva which represents, one could say, an advance on the SvT which prefers to characterize the transcendental aspect of pure Being as Non-being, instead of understanding being and non­being as relative concepts and going beyond them. Even so, accord­ing to the Ta ntrasadbhtiva the contemplation of Non-being does ultimately lead to the highest realization. The Spandaktirikti and its commentators, for their part, deny that it is of any value at all. Thus K�emaraja maintains that whether Being or Non-being is taken as the support of meditation when contemplation reaches perfection they are both realized to be merely conceptual representations and so, he says, the contemplation of Non-being as the eradication of all things can never lead to the realization of the supreme reality (paramtirtha).32 Even so, perhaps, these authors would not have objected as much if it was in this alone that the doctrine of Non-being consisted. The earliest Spanda authors were more likely to have been objecting to the kind of doctrine taught in the Jiitinatilaka to which we now turn. - Although manuscripts of this work are rare and it does not seem to have been of any great importance, the Jiitinatilaka is notable for its theistic nihilism.

Nor are those great-souled ones who have entered the pure water of Non-being burnt by the terrible fire of transmigration though it be intense. Maya, the snake of phenomenal existence (bhava), angry and with long fangs, hard to overcome, whose form is crooked, can do nothing to those who contemplate Non-being.

One who perceive's this principle directly '&ratya�a) is never burnt by the fire of time. In the body it is differentiated (sakala), beyond it is undifferentiated (ni$kala). It is a state of com­pactness (ghanavastha) and is all states. The vital breath (pra!Ja) by nature, it is splendour, stable (dhara!Ja) and pervasive. It can be seen when the yogi is free of thought-constructs (riirvikalpa) as th'e subject (matr) and essence of consciousness (vijiianasadbhava). Man is liberated when the mind (citta) is established in this omnipresent reality that is tranquil'(fanta) and free of all being (bhava). The mind that is unsupported is absorbed in the absence ofbeing. Lib­erated, he enjoys eternal, unobstructed and unirtterrupted bliss (sukha). In Chapter VIII Siva explain's that the yogi should contemplate his own Self within the body as being in a state of emptiness (sunyavastha) for once he has realized this in his own body he real­izes that all this universe is empty (sunya). Thus those whose minds are stable think nothing. The yogi should not direct his attention any­where, whether above, below in front or behind. Depositing his own nature (svarnpa) on the lower plane and abandoning all existent things (bhava) he should think of nothing. He should observe that every­thing is merged in all things and having seen the Self of that which pervades everything'he should think of nothing. In this way behold­ing the waveless (nistaraliga) Self, meditation and the object of medi­tation come to an end. Once one has heard ahd seen the omnipresent Siva, the object of sight and hearing cease to exist. Entering the im­mobile place, the stainless abode of the Vo id, the yogi should think of naught. Just as in the middle of the ocean one sees nothing but water, in the peaceful ocean of consciousness one sees nothing but consciousness within and outside all living beings. Although it is the nature of the mind to wander, once one has known this were can it go? Thus the. mind of one who sees consciousness constantly within himself is well fixed. 63"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"9f 8oumey In !he CZ!Jorld of !he Cfanfras The wise man who is intent on contemplating Non-being (bhava) has no need of any other practice. He, the best of yogis, who is estab­lished on the plane of Non-being, enjoys the Three Worlds along with Siva. This is the knowledge of the state of emptiness (sunyavastha). A yogi in this state is not affected by virtue or vice. He has no concern with what he should or what he should not eat. Like the rays of the sun in the sky he never moves. Concluding Remarks The Jfianatilaka s exposition of the doctrine of Non-being agrees well in many respects with that of the SvT and the other sources we have examined. The main points to note is the identification of the supreme principle with Siva who is Non-being. This is the state of emptiness (sunyavastha) which the yogi attains when he has freed himself of all discursive thought. In order to realize this he must practise the contemplation ofNon-being (abhavabhavanii). Although the Jfianatilaka identifies the liberated condition realized by this prac­tice with a positive state of bliss and Non-being as pure, pervasive consciousness, it is quite understandable how this can be understood in negative terms. The Spandaktirikii also stress that all thought-con­structs and notions (pratyaya) of a discursive order involving a per­sonal referent ('I am happy' or 'I am sad' etc.) must be overco�e to reveal one's own authentic nature (svasvabhava). This state of reali­zation, however, is a state of consciousness which, although beyond all other states, pervades them. As one's own nature (svabhiiva), it is a unique personal state ofbeing (svasvabhav�) possessing both agency (kartrtva) and cognizing subjectivity (jnatrtva) as its inherent quali­ties (akritrmadharma). It is this, acc9rding to the:S.panda teachings, that is Siva's nature and not the emptiness of the absence of Being. 64"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"-3-THE SAM.VITPRAKASA The Light of Consciousness The Text and its name The Samvitprakaia by Vamanadatta is a theological-cum-philo­sophical tract of medium length, the first section of which is framed in the form of a prayer addressed to Vi$Q.U, variously called Hari, Madhava, Vasudeva and Acyuta. What makes this text particularly interesting and important is not only the fine style in which it is writ­ten and the depth of its contents, but the fact that it appears to repre­sent a genre ofVai$Q.ava monism the existence of which is virtually unknown. Although a Vai$Q.ava text, the idealist monism it presents is in many respects parallel to its Kashmiri Saiva equivalents. One could go so far as to say that just as we refer to the Saiva monism that I developed in Kashmir between the 9th and 11th centuries as Kashmiri Saivism, we can analogously refer to the system expounded in this text, which was written in Kashmir during the same period, as a form ofKashmiri Vai$Q.avi�m. The similarities in style and conception be­tween the Samvitprakasa and Kashmiri Saiva literature in general makes this work an object of study for the modem scholar ofKashmiri Saivism just as i.t was for Kashmiri Saivites in the past. Thus, prior to its recovery in manuscript, we knew of the existence of the Samvitprakaia almost exclusively through quotation in Kashmiri Saiva sources, 1 where references appear alongside those drawn from Saiva works with no incongruity. We have called the text Samvitprakaia and this is the name by which it was generally known to Kashmiri Saivites, although it is 1 Dvivedi notes that Vrunanadatta's Samvitprakaia is mentioned by Devaraja, a commentator on the Nigha�tu LAS, II p, 73 with reference to Aufrecht, I p. 681. 65"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"5Zl f}oume!J in the CWorld of the CfantrtJs also occasionally referred to by other names.

In the two avajlable manuscripts, there are seven sections called 'prakara�Ja'. In one of the manuscripts, the number of verses of each section is noted by the scribe at the end of each one.

Even so, insofar as by far the greater majority of references are drawn from the first section, the name Samvitprakasa frequently refers equally to both the text as a whole and a section of it. Vamanadatta, the Author of the Sarilvitprakasa Kashmiri Saiva authors refer to the writer of the Samvitprakasa as Vamanadatta. 5 He himself confmns that this is his name in the con­cluding verses of each section.6 He also says that he was born a Brah­min in Kashmir and that he belonged to the Ekayana.7 In this way he tells us that he was a Paiicaratrin for it is to the Ekayana that the Paiicaratra affiliates itself. Thus Ramanuja's teacher, Yamunacarya, who lived in South India about the middle of the tenth century wrote a work, now lost, called the KtiSmlrtigamaprtimtiiJYG. There he is said to have sought to establish the revealed character (apauru�eyatva) of the Ekayana branch of the white Yajurveda which Paiicaratrins claim is the original source of their Agamic literature.8 The Paiicaratra tradition considers the Ekayanaveda to be a 'secret tradition' (rahasytimntiya).9 5 Jayaratha, for example, commenting on TA, 5/154cd-5ab writes: :r<f'll: qi&11<::0'01ill4ol \\liMctfJOlfct tifCIOICfll� I 6 'ffoqf&11<::0'0fll W:i �l3rGIT SP, l/138 Cf. ibid. 2/61, 3/60, 4/98 and 5/52 7����:1 lbid., 11137 8 Vedanta Desika writes: �� �Cfllll1�11&1lll&1<'fl<>�ll� ('f� Cfli�!Oft<I'1&1�1&110l! v:cf �qf.:;qctf�fu ��I Paficaratnara/cya, Vedantadesikagranthamala edited by Annangaracarya, p. 95; Vedantadesika repeats this statement in his Nyayaparisuddhi, p. 168.

Indeed, according to these sources, the Ekayana is not just a part of the Ve da but the \"very root of the tree of the Ve da\", 11 that \"stands at the head of the Ve das\". 12 Quite in keeping with Vamanadatta's affir­mation of his Ekayana affiliations, the text confirms his thorough­going\"Va i�Q.avism and his incorporation of Paiicaratra concepts in places confirms his Paiicaratra associations. 13 All we know about Vamanadatta is what he himself tells us in this, his only recovered work.

Again, Yogaraja quotes Viravamaka as saying: \"We worship (the deity) incessantly by means of the transcendental fire sacrifice in which the fuel is the forest of duality and death itself the human victim (mahapasu).\" 19 This verse cannot be traced in the manuscripts of the Sarhvitpraktisa, but they are incomplete. It could, anyway, have been drawn from another work by our Vamanadatta. However, this does not seem very likely in so far as the form of the \"transcendental fire sacri­fice\" is drawn from a model that is clearly more Saiva than Vai�J)ava. The word 'vfra' in the author's name lends further weight to the view that this verse is drawn from a work written by a Saiva, rather than a Vai�J)ava, author. Thus, it is not at all certain whether Viravamanaka and our Vamanadatta were the same person. The same uncertainty prevails concerningAbhinavagupta's reference to a Yamanaka as one of his teachers in the Ta ntraloka.20 Although Abhinavagupta does refer to Vamanadatta with respect in one place as 'guru', he may simply mean that he was one of his venerable predecessors or elder contemporaries rather than literally his teacher. However, even though Abhinavagupta was averse to Vai�J)avas, as are Saivites in general, he was prepared to concede that the views o( others were valuable even if they taught what he considered to be lower doctrines. Thus he writes that: \"I myself, for this very reason, have frequented, moved by curiosity for lower doctrines and scriptures, masters of all sorts, logicians, Vedic scholars, Buddhists, Jainas and Vai�J)avas etc ... \"21 Perhaps Vamanadatta was one of these Vai�J)ava teachers to whom Abhinavagupta refers.

Even so� it seems to me that Vamanadatta was probably either an elder contemporary of Abhinavagupta or belonged to the genera­tion just preceding him. Vamanadatta's use of Pratyabhijfia analo­gies (especially photic) and phenomenological idealism modelled on perception suggests that he postdates Utpaladeva. But the absence of a concept of an absolute ego and no identification of the supreme level of speech with the reflective awareness (vimarsa) of this ego goes against this view. Could Vamanadatta represent a point of tran­sition, albeit Vai�I).ava, between the idealistic monism ofSomananda and the phenomenological monism of his disciple Utpaladeva? At any rate, there is no reason to doubt that Vamanadatta lived and wrote in Kashmir sometime between the 9th and 11th century, that is, dur­ing the period of Kashmiri Saivism 's most vigorous growth. This was a period during which such a large number ofKashmiri scholars and religious men turned their attention to writing and teaching that in many cases it is hard to decide who preceded whom and indeed, many were contemporaries of different ages. The style and content ofVamanadatta's work is in itself eloquent testimony to his belong­ing to this rich period oflndia's religious history. The Va�qava Monism of the Samvitprakasa Sarhvitprakasa - the light of consciousness - the title of the first chapter, coincides as we have seen with the name of the entire text. In fact, the symbolic notion of consciousness as luminous is indeed one of the major themes of the text as a whole and of the first chapter in particular. Vamanadatta, like the Pratyabhijfia philosopher, Utpaladeva, makes extensive use of this analogy thus imparting a Pratyabhijfia-like tone to his mode of discourse. This feature markedly distinguishes Vamanadatta's work from another monistic Vai�I).ava tract that has come down to us and that we know was studied in 1Oth 22 The Jsvarapratyabhijiia is quoted in SpPra, p. 84, 87 and 124. 71"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"91 f}oumey in !he ca.Jorld of !he Cfan!ras century Kashmir, namely, the Paramtirthasara, also known as the Adhtirakarika written by Patafijali, alias Se�a, traditionally identi­fied (certainly mistakenly) with the author(s) oftheMahabhti$ya com­mentary on PiiQ.ini's grammar and the Aphorisms on Yo ga.

Present in the body, the Self is the embodied soul (dehin); his presence stimulates the activity of the body, mind and senses, but he does nothing, just as the magnet that attracts iron to itself is inactive.34 Thus: 33 � �lfmi!Sfl<l;:;;i Sfllsl41�1 � �: 1 � �: �lfm4\\;li!Sfl11<lCflq<::� : II ���m���� l:['ij: \"'fffifu 'B'ci f<l\"1f<lf\"''':lCilf'\"lCl �II � �: Cfl{'q{UIIf(!Of<:l'q]'Cf ��:I B<iff4\"'1\\;iJC! � � \"llf<l�qfqq II PS, 47-9. 34 �5� !J>UICfl{OiliOI : 'Cfi\"Ufu �I �'I:'OOffi � �sfq '1' 'Cfi\"Ufu fctif-5'i\"..<::NII <l<;:,q<;iiC114fq � � � Wlfu �I C1G:_qci5fl{OIB�it�ill'!fct 'Rr<::f� �II AKa, 11-12.

Abhinava and Adise�a agree that the Lord is not affected by the troubles of the world; it is the deluded who are peaceful, happy or sad according to their state of mind.37 The Self seems to act due to the activity of the mind and body, just as the sun reflected in running water seems to move.

CJbe .Eight of Consciousness Adise�a's system tends towards a monism of the Advaita Vedanta type and develops the Sarhkhya theme of Puru$a's passivity with respect to Prakrti, here identified with Maya. The embodied soul does nothing, it is Maya that acts. The Self seems to be an agent and enjoyer only because of its association with the body. Now, even though Vamanadatta agrees with Adise�a that there is only one reality and that it is pure consciousness which he praises devoutly as Vi�.Q.u, he sets off on a different tack to present and estab­lish his monism. Like all monists, Vamanadatta stresses in various ways the indeterminate nature of the one reality: it is not exclusively one or other of possible prototypical categories that characterize things such as subject and object, inner and outer etc., and it is beyond conceptualization and hence speech.39 This implies, according to Vamanadatta, that the duality verbal expression necessitates is not real but is merely a conceived idea,40 thus, distinctions such as that between subject and object are false.41 However, this does not mean that the world and those that perceive it are unreal illusions. The' world of things cannot be based on their non-existence. 42 Vamanadatta stresses that the appearance of an illusory snake would not be possi­ble if there were no rope.43 Maya is not the illusory world, it is the fa lse knowledge of ignorance which perceives duality in Vi�.Q.U who is one and non-dual. When this Maya is destroyed one perceives ul­timate reality as it is.44 The world is not unreal; on the contrary, it is as real as Vi�t:J.U himself who, making it as he pleases, is one with it.45 Thus, according to Vamanadatta, the world is actually created, sus­tained and destroyed by Vi�t:J.U who, in doing so, forms himself into the universe - thus assuming his external form - to then revert to his own internal, undiffe rentiated nature when it is destroyed. Vamanadatta thus develops a peculiar position of his own here. Ac­cording to him, it is possible to explain the generation of the world both in terms of real and apparent change. The Advaita view main­tains that the world is a product of a seeming change in the Brahman, like the apparent change that takes place when we perceive a rope mistakenly to be a snake. This view is sharply contrasted with the 39 SP, 1/1-3. 40 Ibid., 118. 41 Ibid., 1/28. 42 Ibid., 11111 b. 43 Ibid., 1/100a. 77 44 Ibid., 11102b-3. 45 Ibid., 1/99."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"91 E/oumey In the CZJ.Jorld of !he Cfanfras one that asserts that the Brahman changes into the universe by alter­ing itself, like milk that becomes curd.

This can be explained both in terms of real and apparent change. (Explained as merely) apparent change, it is You, 0 Acyuta (who persist unchanged although) it appears to be otherwise. (And as a) real transformation, it is always You (who, although essentially the same, assume many forms)just as gold (fash­ioned into an) earring (remains gold).\" 46 Even so, Vamanadatta stresses that subject/object distinctions are not ultimately real. It is the notion based on duality (bhedasamkalpa) that splits up the unity of consciousness into sub­ject and object, inner and outer.47 Both the condition of the subject and that the of object are states of Vi�QU who is the one, pure consciousness, and so they are ultimately false in themselves.48 It is only the foolish who, seeing the world of subjects and objects, believe that that is the way things are also within Vi�Qu,49 whereas he is re­ally beyond all phenomenal being and contamination by such rela­tive distinctions. As Vi�Qu is the universal nature of all things - like the gold of gold ornaments- there can be no distinction within him. 50 There can be no time or space within him who is the one support of all and consists of all things, while at the same time transcending all particulars. 51 Thus, Maya is ignorance or false knowledge of duality. The way this false knowledge operates is through language, for that which is undivided within one's own consciousness appears to be fragmented when it reaches the plane of speech. 52 Duality is just the way we talk about things and hence think about them. The primary form of this duality is that between subject and object. But if we reflect upon this relation and what it entails we discover that it is not as it initially appears to be. Objectivity (meyatva), Vamanadatta argues, amounts to a state of limitation and the exclusion of elements one from an­Qther (pariccheda), and this doesn't take place within consciousness 46 Ibid., 1/104b-6a. 47 1bid., 1/l. 48 Ibid., l/28. 49 Ibid., 1/51. so lbid.,l/109-11. 78 51 Ibid., 1/62. 52 Ibid., 2/19."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Cfbe OamoifprakMa.

In reality cogni­tive consciousness (jfiana) shines by itself; it does not require any object. 56 The status of things as objects of knowledge is not due to some inherent attribute they possess of themselves, but is due to their relation to a perceiving subject, while the subjectivity (matrtva) in the perceiving subject has no existence apart from the object.57 The establishment (siddhi) of truly existing things is independent (anapek$a). There is neither subjectivity nor objectivity in those things that are independent. 58 Similarly, if it is impossible to con­ceive of knowledge with no field of application (vi$aya), it is also impossible for this field to exist without content (vi$ayin ). 59 The same argument holds good with relation to action (karma) and the agent. Action pertains to that which is made manifest by consciousness (prakasya) but this can have no existence in the absence of an agent;60 but as nothing is manifest but consciousness itself there can be no question of action or agency. I At the same time, however, Vamanadatta affirms that Vi��:tu, the consciousness which is the one ultimate reality, is genuinely crea­tive. The entire universe arises out of him 61 - and he precedes and supports all the business of daily life (vyavahara), be it that of the body, speech or mind. 62 As consciousness, Vi��:tu is the unique cause of all things, 63 and nothing can act apart from him 64 -for all that is impelled to action in any way is ultimately impelled by conscious­ness, the one reality.65 Thus what Vamanadatta means when he says that \"creation has no being (satta): being pertains to consciousness\" is not just that all this world of the fettered (samsara) is merely an 53 Ibid., 2/21. 54 Ibid., 2/26. 55 Ibid., 2/29. 56 Ibid., 2/33. 57 Ibid., 2/51. 58 Ibid., 2/52. 59 Ibid., 3/33. 60 Ibid., 2/54. 61 Ibid., 1/73. 79 62 Ibid., 1/93. 63 Ibid., 171. 64 Ibid., 1/74. 65 Ibid., 1/75."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"9l 8oumey in !he CWorld of !he %nfras imaginary notion (vikalpa),66 but that, unlike consciousness which requires nothing, there is no �henomenal entity which just exists and is known as such in itself independently of consciousness. 67 It is this seeming independence which is fa lse. 68 Vamanadatta thus accepts that the one reality is varied (vicitra). Unity is different from relative distinctions and duality (bheda); it is the whole of reality which is involved in it, not just one reality or existing things contrasted with another independent reality. Vamanadatta explains all this by taking recourse to a common Pafi.caratra notion which understands Vi�I)u as four-fold (caturatman) as himself and his emanations (vyuha). These four are equated with various quatemities of mutually dependent elements that represent phases or levels within the entire range or reality. These are vari­ously defined in different contexts as: 1) Reality (vastu), phenomenal being (bhava), determinate par­ticulars (artha), and action (kriya).69 2) The four levels of Speech: Santa, Pasyanti, Madhyama and Va ikhari. 70 3) Subject (pramatr), object (meya), means ofknowledge (mana) and veridical cognitive consciousness (miti).71 This way of understanding causality leaves Vamanadatta free to talk about Vi�I)u's cosmically creative activity in terms which often remind us of Kashmiri Saivism and that fits �ith a world view that generally characterize the monisms ofTantric systems as a whole as distinct from those developed from the Upani�ads. This form of monism is fo rmed by an identification of the opposites which simul­taneously involves their transcendence. Reality is one because it in­cludes everything. It is for this reason that it is free of duality. One­ness is Jot achieved merely by denying multiplicity as unreal from the perspective of a higher transcendental reality. In this way Vi�I)U is completely established in himself at all times, and yet generates and destroys the universe that arises from him and falls back into him like the ocean that is in itself waveless and yet generates waves.72 Thus, requiring nothing outside himself, Vi�I)u is endowed with per-66 Ibid., 3/2. 67 Ibid., 2/21. 68 Ibid., 2/22. 69 Ibid., 1/87. 70 Ibid., l/89. 80 71 Ibid., 2/59. 72 Ibid., 1/73."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Cfbe OamollprakMa.

Although this is a metaphor in a sense, in another, absolute divine consciousness and the world manifested in and through it are literally the light of consciousness and this is the way it is experienced. This presentation of the one, absolute reality as light is well-know to Indian thought fr om very early times. It finds its classic expression in the fo llowing verse which appears in a number ofUpani�?ads: \"The sun shines not there, nor moon and stars; These lightnings shine not, much less this (earthly) fire! 73 Ibid., 1184. 74 Ibid., 1/81. 75 Ibid., 1192. 76 Ibid., 1125. 77 Ibid., 1/119. 78 Ibid., 1/112-3. 79 Ibid., 1/24. 80 Ibid., 1/22. 81 81 Ibid., 1117. 82 Ibid., 1110. 83 Ibid., 1122. 84 Ibid., 1114."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"9l 8oumeg in !he CWor/d of !he %nlras After Him, as He shines, doth everything shine.

The illuminators are both the perceiving subjects and their activity through which th� objects of illumination are known, made known and hence, r rom this idealist point of view, created. All these illuminating lights .hine by virtue of Vi�t:tu, the one light. 86 In this sense, Vi�t:tu i.> 2 · ,,ays immediately apparent as all things, in the act of knowing ther: and as the knower. As the immediate appearance of things just as they are, that is, as the shining of the universal light, they reveal Vi�Qu's nature which is thus directly apparent (prakata). The light of the sun illumines an object and so makes it apparent (ptakata), whereas before it was obscure (aprakata) and hence unknown. But Vi�t:tu is always appar­ent as all things. There is no need to find ways to make him evident, nor is there any need of proofs to establish his existence.87 Thus, the light which is the illuminator (prakasaka) is at the same time the object of illumination - without this compromising its essentially luminous nature as the pure presentation of things just as they are in the immediacy of their direct experience. Thus Vamanadatta writes: \"None dispute that You (0 Lord) are the essential nature of (all) things; it is not darkness (aprakasa) that shines when (the light of consciousness) becomes the object of il lumination.\" 88 In this way Vamanadatta accounts fo r unity as the identity of opposites understood as aspects of the same numinous reality, namely, the shining of the light of consciousness. But while the illuminator as light manifests the object and thus presents itself as the object's man_i­fe st appearance, it also transcends it: \"Just as these things are separate from the light of the sun and it is undivided, so are You separate from all these objects ofYour illu­mination.\" 89 8l Svetasvataropani$ad 6114.

Vi$IJ.U, the one reality is unaffected by the diversity of things - he is unconditioned. Although present in that which has form and is determined by time and space, he is free of them.90 But this is not because they are u.nreal or less then real in respect to Vi$IJ.U's reality: Vi$IJ.U is free of time, space and fo rm because he encompasses every­thing; the universe is full ofVi$IJ.U and there is no state in which he is absent.91 Thus Vamanadatta's transcendental logic is soon transformed into a 'logic of immanence' in which the absolute is understood as one because it excludes nothing, rather than because it stands beyond the many phenomena subject to a conditioned, contingent state of existence. But if all this is true and Vi$IJ.U is that same consciousness which is in every perceiving conscious being as its most essential nature, why are we not aware of this fa ct directly and so, being conscious of our ultimate identity with Vi$1)..U, be in his same state? The answer, Vamanadatta affirms, is to be found in the negative, privative char­acter of tho,ught (vikalpa). This is a theme Vamanadatta develops extensively throughout the third prakara!Ja where he discusses the nature of thought and its fo rmation through the power of Speech. The world of daily life is perceived through a veil of thought con­structs which represent what is presented by the shining of the light of consciouspess in conceptual terms. Those who cannot penetrate through this veil of conceptual representation and be conscious of the immediacy of things and themselves just as they are, that is, as clearly evident manifestations of the light of consciousness, are cut off both from the outer reality of the object and the inner reality of the subject. Thus removed from themselves and, by the same token, from the wqrld around them, they are helplessly caught up in the trammels of conditioned existence. Thus Vamanadatta pertinently quotes the dictum: \"all thought is samsara\".92 Like all Hindu monists, \\'�manadatta preaches that liberation comes by identifying ourselves with the true Self (in this case identi­fied with Vi�IJ.u), and by freeing ourselves of fa lse identification with 90 Ibid., 1/14. 91 Ibid., 1170. 92 Ibid., 3/2. 83"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"91· fJoumey In !he CWorld of !he Cfanlras the body and all else that is not Self(anatman).

If the Self were to be an object, the subject who perceives it would be superior to it. Thus there would be something higher than the Self and another higher than that would be required in order to know it. Ultimate Being cannot be known like a sense object, for all sense objects are limited, conditioned entities. 94 This does not mean that the Self is never known objectively, rather that it is not known in itself as it is in this way. When consciousness is perceived as an object, it becomes the things of the world that are 'other' than the Self. As Vamanadatta says: \"Just as one perceives the external form of that which is in the field of vision, just so consciousness, established in the act of per­ception, perceives its own nature as the object of knowledge.\" 95 In order to know the Self, we must find another mode ofknowledge: \"Transcending all things, how can anyone describe Your nature (0 Lord)? Description applies only to that which is divided, while the Self of none is such and that (Self) is You, Who are the Self of all, and so for this reason also You cannot be described.

We distinguish between one thing and an­other labeling one and then the other according to their functions. This division is a purely mental construct; although useful, indeed essential, fo r daily life, it is not real. 97 If some existing thing were to stand contradicted by another, this contradiction would necessarily extend to its essential nature. The being of entities cannot in itself oppose itself; difference, distinction and contradiction are all notions, they are not qualities inherent in the being of things.98 Similarly, if Vi�l).u is everything and he is discernable in both subject and object, this distinction too is false - it is just a notion.99 Vi�l).u must be known directly and not as the subject knows his object, and that is only possible if he is the Self: 93 Ibid., 2/3. 94 Ibid., 2/4-6. 95 Ibid., 1/9. 96 Ibid., 1/33-34. 97 Ibid., 118. 84 98 lbid., 2/47. 99 Ibid., 1/27-8."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Cfhe OarhoilprakMa.

He builds up his epistemology on the basis of an idealism that accounts for the possi­bility of knowledge by positing it not as the product of cognitive activity but as its a prior ontological and epistemological ground which cognitive activity simply reveals. Veridical cognitive conscious­ness (manata)101 is in every case one's own self-awareness alone (svasamvedana) which is understood to be the very Being (salta) of consciousness free of thought constructs.102 The three sources of right knowledge (prama) are direct perception, inference and scripture.103 All means ofknowledge (prama�:za) are each individually associated with their specific object and so do not allow the subject to experi­ence pure awareness directly 104 unless he makes a special effort to do so. Thus Vamanadatta writes: \"You transcend all thought constructs and so, although directly apparent, are fo rgotten, as happens with something in front of a man whose mind is full of desire for something else.\" 105 But, although Vi�I).u is worshipped as consciousness and this consciousness manifests as the objects of the world in and through each act of perception, Vamanadatta does not go as far as his Kashmiri Saiva counterparts who, perceiving reality in much the same way, conclude that the world-order and all that transcends it are encom­passed in the self-reflective awareness of a universal 'I' conscious­ness. Thus, while Vamanadatta's phenomenology coincides with that ofUtpaladeva and oflater Kashmiri Saivites in general as far as the phenomenon of presentation is concerned, there is divergence in the characterization of the representational aspect, that is, the judgement of what is presented by the shining of the light of consciousness. A Kashmiri Saivite would say that Vamanadatta does not tackle this problem thoroughly. Implicit in his view is that not all representation is conceptual and that this non-conceptual representation is essen­tially an awareness of the Self as all things and as beyond them and 100 Ibid., 1/5. 101 Ibid., 2/39. 102 Ibid., 2/48. 103 Ibid., 2/35. 85 104 Ibid., 2/34. 105 Ibid., 1135."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"9!

I am not referring here to a mere absence of a technical term - such as 'vimarsa'-more to the point is that Vamanadatta categorically rejects any fo rm of egoic projection onto absolute consciousness. All sense to self must be eradicated. As Vamanadatta says: \"0 Madhava, only You remain when one free of ego (reflects that) You perform this action and (that it accords with) Your nature. Now if this separation (from You) which corresponds to this (false) presumption of egoic existence dissolves into the Self by devotion to You, separation is destroyed and oneness is established.\" 106 The sense of oneness as 'I' is never an independent self-subsist­ing awareness; according to Vamanadatta it is always the subject of predication as when one thinks: \"this is different from me and I am different from that\".107 It is thus essentially a thought construct like all relativizing analytic notions. Instead of being a notion centred on the object, it is a notion concerning oneself (asmadvika/pa) and so, like its objective counterpart, it must be rejected as short of ultimacy. Vamanadatta equates the ego with the notion of personal existence as individual, appropriating or acquisitive consciousness. It consists of an intent (samkalpa) to make the object one's own. Thus, rather than the sense of 'I' it is better described as the sense of 'mine'. This sense of 'mine' (mamata) expresses itself each moment as an inten­tion which leads to another, thus maintaining its existence. Vamanadatta accordingly describes it as a transitory (anitya) prod­uct of the pulsing activity of consciousness (spanda). Just as death is the inevitable result of its persistence, so death ceases when it comes to an end.108 106 Ibid., l/100b-2a. 107 Ibid., 2/29. 108 Ibid., 4/42-3. Worth noting in passing is that while Vamanadatta states expressly in this passage that the pulsation of consciousness -Spanda -is free of thought constructs he does not equate it with the dynamics of the absolute ego as most Kashmiri Saivites do, but treates the ego as an epiphe­nomenon of its activity. 86"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Cfhe OamoifprakMa.

At best, it is understood as part of the inner mental organ operating there as the factor which personalizes or appropriates the perceptions reflected and made known in the intellect. 109 It is Utpaladeva who formulates for the first time in his lsvarapratya­bhijfiakarika a notion of the absolute as a pure ego consciousness and makes full use of it in a completely developed system, thus extending the universal Hindu doctrine of Self into a higher meta­physics of the Self as a Fichtian-like superego.\"0 That Vamana­datta's views are compatible with this ulterior development is ex­emplified by the extensive quotation of his work in the fourteenth chapter of the Lak$mltantra.

The close affinity between Vamanadatta's views and monistic Saivism is clearly evidenced by Abhinavagupta addressing him respectfully as 'teacher', 114 even though throughout his works he consistently relegates Vai�l)avism to a lower level than Saivism as a whole and particularly that of his own Saiva traditions.115 In short, Vamanadatta 's work, despite its diver­gence in certain respects from Saiva monism - particularly with regard to the ultimacy of the ego-sense- still remains, nonetheless, highly compatible with it. The extensive use Bhagavadutpala makes of the Samvitprakasa as a source in his commentary on the Sp andakarika clearly exemplifies how Vamanadatta 's work can serve 113 The La/cymftantra contains citations from the Svacchandabhairavatantra and the Vij iianabhairava, both Tantric texts being well-known and respected by Kashmiri Saivites. It also cites K�emaraja, Utp:)\\adeva and Abhinavagupta in a number of places. According to Sanderson, the La/cymftantra and the Ahirbudhnyasamhita quoted by Natatur Amma! (= Vatsya Va radacarya) must have been composed between 1100 and 1200 in South India because the mantras of the Yaj urveda quoted in them belong to the Taittiriya recension peculiar to the Southern tradition after the lOth century. 114 TA, 5/l 55a, see p. 67, n. 5. 115 Abhinavagupta devotes the 35th chapter of his Ta ntraloka to the relation­ship he believes exists between the various scriptural traditions as taught him by Sambhunatha, his Trika teacher (TA, 35/44b). There he uncompro­misingly declares that: \"In order to achieve the various fruits more or less perfect of duty (dharma), profit (artha), sexual pleasure (kama) and liberation (molcya), there is only one means, namely, the Saivagama\" (ibid., 35/24). Abhinava agrees that teachings are diverse but they also yield different fruits at differing levels so that those at a lower level cannot yield the fruits of a higher one: \"The various fo rms such as Vi�Q.U etc. which God assumes are due to his self-differentiation and, as such, that is, due to this differentiation, are on the plane of Maya.

Bhagavadutpala, as his ancestry and traditional appella­tion -Utpala Vai�Q.ava - suggest, had strong ties with the Vai�Q.ava community although he was undoubtedly a Saivite when he wrote his commentary. Vamanadatta's work served his purpose admirably, fo r here was a text that he could freely quote that would find ap­proval by both groups, and so link together more closely the Paiicaratra and Saiva sources that he freely quotes without deference to one or the other, in an attempt to establish that the doctrine of the Sp andakarikti is taught in both. Apart from these general, pervasive Saiva influences that can be discerned in Vamanadatta's work, we find more specific references which show that Vamanadatta accepted the more esoteric, strongly Sakta-oriented Saiva tt:aditions prevalent in Kashmir, namely, those of the Krama school. Thus, fo r example, we can discern clear traces of Krama notions in the fo llowing passage: \"0 Lord, the abiding condition of all things is that of Your own immutable nature simultaneously (manifest everywhere). It can be known by means of its progressively mutating nature (kramasvanlpa) (that is such without thereby) running contrary to the simultaneity (of the immediacy ofBeing). Simultaneity is possible in· the absence of progressive change (kra11',1a), which in its turn (is possible only) in the absence of the former. Thus, as they are mutually contradictory, they cannot aris� from one another. So, in this way, those who have realized the ultimate truth know that You manifest Your self-himi­nous conscious nature as the state of mutual dependence (between these polarities and all things).\" 116 This way of understanding the fundamental polarities of exist­ence as progression -krama - versus simultaneity -yaugapiidya - is typical of Krama absolutism which views the absolute as dy­namic consciousness that, forming itself into all things, is the entire process of creation, persistence, and destruction while standing be­yond them in a fourth ineffable -aniikhya - state in which con­sciousness is at once all of them simultaneously. From this point of view, the ineffability and absolute nature of consciousness, the one reality, lies in its being this progression despite remaining itself 116 SP, 1/66-8. 89"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"9! 8oume!J in !he CWorld of !he Cfanlras changeless. This position is summed up by Abhinava when he says: \"the pure principle of consciousness transcends all talk of succession (krama) or its absence (akrama).\" 117 There is one place in Vamanadatta's work where his Krama lean­ings are made fully explicit. In the beginning of the fourth section he makes a plea fo r tolerance, insisting that, although Vi�I,lu's energy assumes various names and forms according to different schools of thought, one cannot say that these differences correspond to separate principles or, for that matter, that they do not. This is, anyway, of no importance, that which one should abandon is not a view but karma which is binding, and that which is to be taken up is the pure con­sciousness of the subject. He concludes that this power is: \"One and abides in many states as both mobile and motionless. She rests on the foundation of time which is the twelve-petelled lotus and by her progressive differentiation (kalanti) She, Kalakar�ii,ll, makes her (eternal) Time manifest as having assumed the form of (temporal) time by means of the generation and destruction of (all) existing things.\" 118 Kalakar�ii,li, also called Kalasarhkar�ini, is well known as a fo rm of Kali venerated in the Krama school. Her association with the twelve-petelled lotus described as tlfe foundation of time is possibly a reference to the cycle of twelve Kalis that lies at the core ofKrama mysticism. Important also, as indicative of Vamanadatta's non-Vai�I,lava influences, is his representation of the arising and falling away of images within consciousness as a discontinuous process: there is a gap between the arising of one fo rm and the falling away of another. The attentive soul who can catch this moment in-the center between one perception and the next no longer feels the bondage of the illusory play of Maya through the activity of thought, but experiences it all as the pure expansion of consciousness.119 We can compare this view with that of K�emaraja who says: \"This supreme plane of awareness consists of all the powers (of consciousness) pulsing in unity. Although actually manifest to all constantly, on the plane of Maya it does not sustain a firm realization 117 TA, 411 80ab. 118 SP, 4/ 12-3. 90 119 Ibid., 1/4 and 1/41-44."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"crbe Oamoifpra�sa. crbe .8ighl of Consciousness of consciousness within oneself. Even there, however, it is clearly manifest at every junction (between cognitions).\" 120 In the center between perceptions the attentive soul can experi­ence the pure indeterminate awareness (nirvikalpa) that serves as the basis of determinate perception as its source, resting place, and end. In the ce_!lter abides what Vamanadatta calls 'pure experience' (suddhanubhava); 121 that is, the fundamental self-awareness . (svasamvedana) through which consciousness is perceived and is the basis of all knowledge which Kashmiri Saivites identify, as we have already noted, with absolute 'I' consciousness. Finally, it is important to stress that, despite the powerful influ­ence Saiva monism exerted on Vamanadatta, he remains thoroughly Vai�r:tava throughout his work. Vi�r:tu is his sole object of devotion which he also worships as his incarnations that he understands as hypostheses or aspects of consciousness and its manifestations.122 His Paficaratra associations are also clearly evident from his presentation of the four· vyuhas -Vasudeva, Sarhkar�ar:ta, Pradyumna and Aniruddha, to which he assigns mystic centers in the body as part of a developing praxis in which their association with their energies plays a prominent role.123 Indeed, despite the space Vamanadatta dedi­cates in his work to establishing, even as he praises Vi�r:tu, that con-. sciousness alone, free of all diversity and subject-object distinctions, is ultimately real, his primary concern is with practice. Thus not only does he dedicate space to a description of the yogic centers and chan­nels in the body viewed from the perspective of his sophisticated idealism, he also devotes the entire fifth chapter to an analysis of the phonemes as vital components of mantra and vehicles of the sound (nada) or word (sabda) energy of consciousness which he identifies with the syllable Om and that make mantras powerful and cosmi­cally significant as incorporating within themselves the energies of all manifestation and what lies in the transcendent beyond it. This concern fits naturally with Vamanadatta's recurrent references to 120 SpSam, p. 6, see PTv, p. 106 ff. where Abhinava deals with this practice extensively. 121 SP, 1141. 122 Ibid., 1/25 ff. 123 Ibid., 4/64ff. 91"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"5Zl E/oumey in !he CWorld of !he Cfanlras Speech (vac), its levels, fo rms and nature.

To conclude we can say that the discovery and edition of Vamanadatta's work may well serve as a stimulus fo r further re­search into the interaction between Saivism and Vai�I)avism in gen­eral and, more specifically, between their monistic forms. Thus a work like Bhaskara's Kalcyyastotra evidences, in the passages quoted from it, signs of the author's attempts to integrate certain basic Paiicaratra notions into his Saiva monism. 124 Other works, like the Cicchaktisamstuti 125 that we know of only from quotations, exhibit a sort of intermediary character. This text, focusing on Sakti, draws from both Saiva and Vai�I)ava ideas to support its Sakta monism. Again, although the Paramarthasara draws its inspiration from other sources to develop its monism, its existence is a further indication that, although less extensive than their Saiva equivalents, Vai�I)ava monisms deserve to be carefully researched and not only in the works of known authors but, more especially, in the original Paiicaratra scrip­tures amongst which some, particularly the Ahirbudhnyasamhita and the La/cymltantra, exhibit marked Saiva influences. 124 I am thinking here particularly of the verses from the Kalcyytistotra quoted in SpPra, p.103. 125 Quoted ibid., p. 87 and p. 113. 92"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"-4-THE INNER PILGRIMAGE OF THE TANTRAS The Sacred Geography of the Kubjika Tantras with reference to the Bhairava and Kaula Tantras This paper focuses on the sacred geogr�phy of a few Saiva schools of the Bhairava Tantras and their parallel Kaula schools, 1 in particular that of the little-known goddess Kubjika and, to a lesser extent, the much better known goddess Tripurit Apart from the Tantras 1 One could term these Kaula schools 'Sakta', i.e centred on the worship of goddesses. However, although this term does indeed characterize the Kaula schools correctly, it is a misleading term in this context. This is because it would imply that the Bhairava Tantras were not Sakta. It is true that the milder, more Siddhanta-like Bhairava Tantras, such as the Svacchanda­bhairavatantra, are centred primarily on the worship of the male deity, as the generic term for this type of Tantra suggests. However, this is not the case with the more 'extreme' members of this class. These are generally replete with Yogini cults and sharply focused on the feminine. The Jayadrathaytimala, fo r example, is an important Bhairava Tantra, but it is primarily concerned with the worship of numerous forms ofKali, especially Kalasarhkar!?ii}I. The chapters or sections in the JY concerned with the wor­ship ofKali are commonly (but not invariably) labelled there as parts of the Ktillkrama (i.e Kaii 'liturgy', 'tradition' or 'transmission') which is also some­times called the Ktilikula. So, fo r example, in one place in the JY we read: \"This secret is the Ktilikula, that has come through the oral transmission.\" IW.likulam idam guhyam mukhaptirampartigatam I JY 4/2l/26ab. The dis­tinction between the two types of Tantras - the Bhairava and Kaula - is thus not coterminous with that between Saiva and Sakta. Kula is a modality (prakriyti) or fo rm of practice (tictira) which the texts distinguish from the Tantric one. In this perspective, the Bhai.!ava Tantras are primarily concerned with Tantric practice (tantrtictira) but allow for the Kaula mode. Kaula Tantras, on the other hand, pride themselves in being free of the Tantric mode (tantrtictiravivarjita). But note that the 'Tantric mode' may also be Sakta. 93"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"9l f}oumey in !he CUJorld of !he Cfan!ras themselves, a major source for this paper is the work of the great 1 1th-century Kashmiri, Abhinavagupta, especially his Ta ntraloka. All the sources belong to the culmination of the fo rmative period of Tantrism,2 that is, between the 9th and 12th century. A major feature of these geographies, which this paper will briefly explore, is the manner in which they have been interiorized. In 1950 D.C. Sircar published the Sakta Pi!has. In this work he presents an edition of the Pi!hanin:zaya that lists 51 goddess sites (pifha). In his lengthy introduction, Sircar reproduces a number of such lists from other sources, q10stly PuraQas and some Tantras. Apart from this well-known work, very little research has been done on the sacred geographies of the Tantras in comparison to the relatively large amount of research that has been done on the geographies of the PuraQas and the Epics. One obvious reason for this is that many of the sacred sites of the PuraQas and Epics are still functional. Hence they can be accurately located and much can be learnt about them from work in The Ta ntrasadbhava, for example, is a major Bhairava Tantra of the Trika school. Although it teaches, amongst other things, the worship of a triad of goddesses - Par!i, Par!ipar!i and Apara -it professes the excellence of the Tantric mode.

Even so, the term S!ikta, in a generic, adjectival sense, is both meaningful and convenient and is used accordingly in this paper. 2 Padoux (2000: 12) rightly admonishes that: \"the term tantrika-that is to say, tantric, but not in the modem sense of the word- is of ancient usage in India; but the term 'Tantrism' is a relatively recent western creation. It is better not to use a term that leads one to suppose there exists in the vast socio-religious complex of Hinduism a current, sect or entity called tantrism.\" I use this term in this paper, as I use the term Sakta, in a broad generic sense with reference to disparate tantric (tantrika) traditions simply as a matter of convenience. I do not imply thereby that Tantrism is a sect or religion in its own right. So when I refer to the development of Tantrism, for example, I intend the development of the many Tantric sects and cults as a whole, al­though, of course, they may not all be literally growing together at any one time in the same way or rate. 94"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"crbe 9nner CJ>i/grfmage of !he %nfras the field. Although a number of the sites found in the early Tantras have been absorbed into the sacred geography of the Purat).as and Epics or may have been common to both from an early period, their connec­tion with the Tantric tradition has mostly been lost. It fo llows, there­fo re, that the Sanskritic tradition associated with most of these sites does not generally refer to the Tantras as its authority. And even where such references exist, they are to Tantras of a later period. Another reason why the sacred geography of the Tantras has not received much attention is that the roots ofTantrism belong to a cul­ture originally developed by peripatetic ascetics. In the transition to the idiom of the Sanskrit normative texts (sastra)-in this case the Tantras - the forms of the earlier proto-Tantric cults 3 were neces­sarily domesticated to varying degrees and systematized by those who knew this idiom best, namely, Brahmins and those ascetics who were well versed in Brahminical culture.4 This was not at all a unique phenomenon in the history of Hinduism; Dumont, amongst others, has drawn attention to the fa ct that: 3 I deliberately refer to these seminal cults as 'proto-Tantric' to reserve the adjective 'Tantric' for those cults and their elemental contents found in the texts denoted as Tantras or by some equivalent term. One of these terms is 'Agama' which literally means '(a tradition) coming from the past'. This 'coming' (agama) is often presented in the texts as being originally, and most fundamentally, an oral transmission. Many of the numerous rituals de­scribed in the early Tantras, especially the Saiva and their offshoot, the god­dess-centred Kaula Tantras, are best suited for the solitary peripatetic as­cetic. The great Tantric systems that developed in the early period, that is, prior to the 12th century, are highly elaborate. Those who built these systems must have been erudite practitioners who approached their task from the perspective of the prior and contemporary literary traditions. These tradi­tions furnished ready-made forms and norms that served as a filter through which what remained of the 'external', 'oral' elements was transformed and absorbed. This took place so thoroughly and the additional, purely literary input was so massive that contact with these sources became highly tenuous, a· correct assessment of their nature being now problematic. 4 The Buddhist Tantras, especially those of the Yoga andAnuttarayoga classes, which were, in some respects, strongly influenced by their Saivite equiva­lents, probably developed in an analogous manner. In this case wandering Buddhist ascetics contributed substantially, although not exclusively, to lay­ing the fo undations of the Tantric systems, which were mostly developed 95"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"9l (Journey in !he CWorld of !he Cfan!ras \"The secret of Hinduism may be fo und in the dialogue between the renouncer and the man-in-the-world ....

Behaving in accord with a different code of conduct which, although ethically very stringent, differs from the commonly accepted one of smarta Dharma, these antinomian ascetics lived in a separate reality. Enjoined in their rituals (puja), religious conduct (carya), and itinerant life, to make no distinction between pure and impure, in terms of the conventional moral code of the householder they were little different from the outcastes with whom they freely associated. And yet these ascetics were the workers of wonders and, above all, accomplished adepts who founded many, if not all of the numerous Tantric traditions.7 systematically by erudite monks in their monasteries. In this case the input of the system builders was supplemented not only by the Buddhist literary traditions (stistra) but also by the Saiva. The Buddhists conceived this proc­ess to be one of interiorization of the Saiva elements. These elements were 'external' both because they were outside Buddhism and, above all, because they were literally done. 'Internalized', they could be inserted into the monu­mental structures of the great Buddhist Tantric systems. 5 Dumont 1980: 270, 275 quoted by Quigley 1993: 56. 6 See footnote 1 above. 7 The examples that could be quoted are innumerable. A KubjikA Tantra tells us about a Vidyananda who received initiation from Ni�kriyananda. The text tells us: \"Here was a sage (muni) called Silaciti. His (spiritual) son :vas an accom­plished adept- Siddha-whose appearance was like that of a (tribal) Sabara. He was called Vidyananda.

But other forms ofTantrism, particularly the Sakta cults, stayed closer to their roots and so main­tained their original, strongly closed, esoteric character, despite the inevitable process of domestication. The householder in such cases did not need to go to a temple or sacred site. He simply reproduced . the temple and the original wayfaring life in his imagination by means of symbolic representations. These, and the sacred space he created to perform the prescribed rituals and Yoga, he projected into himself. Accordingly, the sacred geographies of such cults lay close to the edge of redundancy and were subject to considerable transformation and assimilation into the greater encompassing smarta sacred geographies of the Puriil).as. Nowadays, the literate (as opposed to the folk) religions of the populations of large areas of South Asia are still based to a large degree on the Tantras. The Saiva rituals perfonned in the temples of South India are adapted from the Saivasiddhiinta Agamas just as the Vai�Qava rituals are based on those prescribed in the Paiicaratra and Vaikhanasa Samhitas.8 The Lingayat Saivism of Andhra and KarQa-t aka is based on a corpus of Saiva Agamas developed independently of the Siddhanta, although similar to it in many respects and clearly influenced by it. In Bengal, Maithila and Assam the Saktism of the late (post-12th century) Sakta Tantras is still practised.

In this case, the term is a synonym of the term Tantra.

Its expansion in the past (especially between the 6th and 12th centuries) and survival up to the present was possible to the degree in which Tantrism managed to adapt to the requirements and conditions of the householder. The strategies adopted to make these adaptations possible are no less extensive and diverse than the extent of the cultural forms, philosophical thought, ritual and lifestyles to which they have given rise. This paper is an attempt to analyze a few examples, drawn from selected Tantric sources (especially the Kubjika Tantras), of one of these strategies, namely, the interiorization of their own sacred ge­ography. These texts perceive how the external sacred geography draws its power from its internal counterpart� while the inner geog­raphy derives its form from the outer. Thus the two give life to one another, even when their relationship has been interiorized and be­come purely ideal. The dialectical interplay between the inner and outer yields more than just the accumulation of the energy of an interiorized sacred place. It sucks into itself the outer fo':ffi to place it at the very centre of reality. The Nameless and Formless thus as­sumes name and form - as the geography of the innermost creative core of reality. . Thus, an essential fe ature of the sacred geography of these texts is that it is always understood to have an internal equivalent. As one would expect, the ideal, interior pole progressively assumes increas­ingly greater prominence over the exterior one until the latter dwin­dles away into a virtual cipher. Even so, we should not forget that for this dialectic to function properly, this sacred geography must, at its origins at least, be external, that is, empirically real. This is true not in spite of, but because of the ideal reality of the inner, even though the inner is the product of the power of the creative imagination ap­plied to the creation of a sacred universe for the purpose of ritual, contemplation (i.e. Yoga), and the development of insight (jnana). We shall therefore need to examine both, that is, the concrete outer geography and its ideal inner equivalent, in order to understand the manner of their interaction and with it the sacred geography of these Tantras. 98"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"CJbe 9nner Cf>i/grimage of !h e %n!ras In order to do this I will present a few exemplary geographies, both to determine their content and to see how these principles oper­ate in the doctrines of the Tantras chosen for study. I will focus espe­cially on the Tantras of the goddess Kubjika. An important fe ature of this geography is that it can be interiorized to varying degrees depending on the interiority of the locus of projection. This can be: 1) The Body: The corporeal surface of inscription 10 may be on or around the body as well as in the centres and channels within it. Examples we will examine include the projection of the sacred places founded by the goddess Kubjika in her tour oflndia onto the face, as described in the Kubjika Tantras, and the imaginary lotus of sacred sites projected into the body according to the Nisisamctira, a Bhairava Tantra quoted by Abhinavagupta in his Ta ntrtiloka. 2) The Breath: This is variously-represented. In some of the fo l­lowing examples, the twofold character of the breath, dynamic and at rest, characterized as Sound (ntida) and the Point (bindu), respec­tively, are the loci of projection. 3) Core reality: At this, the innermost level, the ground of exist­ence itself is the surface of inscription. In this case, sacred place is the Divine Core. This is not a projection but the radiating source of all projections that together qonstitute the manifest world with its sacred geography. According to the Tantras of the Kali cult (the Kalikrama), fo r example, the supreme power of the deity's divine consciousness is simultaneously both the source and the sacred seat -plfha-of its energies: \"0 mother! This, the great sacred seat (plfha) born from You, is the energized vitality (of consciousness) which pours forth when Siva becomes one with You by virtue ofYour perpetually expanding body of energy. And this, the (divine) intellect, the supreme vitality (of conscious­ness) is Yo u, 0 (goddess) Siva, whose body oflight abides within the five elements beginning with Earth and who generates the Wheel of the Sacred Seats (plfhacakra-corresponding to them).

Perceived, 0 Mother, by the wise who are at one with the fo rce (of pure consciousness -udyama ), You are the unobscured dawning (of enlightenment).\" 11 In the Kubjika cult, in a manner typical of the symbolism of Sakta cults in general, the Divine Core is primarily characterized as the triangular geometric icon that represents the goddess as the Source - Yoni - of manifestation. Let us begin from this inner core first, as the teaching that concerns it is central to the doctrine of the Kubjikli Tantras that I have chosen for detailed study. As emanation itself, Kubjika is the MaQ.<Jala that is both the source of the universe and its ideal geometry. In this case the MaQ.<Jala is primarily the Triangle of the Yo ni (lit. 'vulva') which is the god­dess herself. This is why she is called Vakra (Crooked) and Kubjikli (Hunchbacked). This basic triangular fo rm has fo ur components lo­cated at the three comers and the centre. These are the four primary seats (pl{ha) of the goddess. The goddess is the entire economy of all the energies both in the universe and in their microcosmic and transcendent parallels in consciousness. But she is not just the sum of all energies; she is also every one of them individually. They are deployed in sacred space that the Tantras in general characterize as an Emptiness (sunya) called the Sky (kha, vyoman) or the ethereal space of consciousness (cidakasa). The pervasive condition of these energies precedes and, in one aspect, perpetually transcends mani­festation, which is understood to take place on the analogy of speech and its attendant vehicle, breathing.

Thus by the 11th century, at the latest, this scheme of four primary sacred sites (pitha), which became largely standard for the whole of subsequent Tantric Saktism, was already well established and thoroughly interiorized in the Kubjika Tantras. The primary im­portance of these places for such forms of Tantrism, both Saiva and Sakta, cannot be overstated. An important example on the Hindu side is the incorporation of this triangle, wholesale with its sacred seats, into the centre of Sricakra by the Tantras of the goddess Tripura. The same grouping of sacred seats is also given pride of place in the Bud­dhist Hevajra Ta ntra and some of the other major Buddhist Tantras of the Anuttarayoga and Yoga groups. 13 They interiorized these places so thoroughly in fact that the Four Sacred Seats (catu$pitha) came to represent metaphysical principles.14 As Map 9; plotted on the basis of a selection of such texts indicates, the sacred geography of these Tantras has much in common with those of their Hindu equivalents of the time, including the Kubjika Tantras. The process of interiorization of these places is so ancient and thorough that the exact location of these places is an object of much scholarly dispute. An additional process which, in the case of the Tantras at least, accompanies, as well shall see, that of interiorization, renders the exact identification of these places even more difficult. I am referring to the phenomenon of replication, whereby sacred places of pan-Indian importance are projected into local geographies. Although I cannot hope to resolve these disputes, I shall venture to present hitherto unanalyzed material pertinent to this problem with a few modest.observations and a very tentative hypothesis.

Moreover, the character of at least one of these places and its characterization in the Tantras appear to corre­spond. I am referring to Jalandhara. Tantric etymology derives the first part of this name from the word jvala meaning 'flame' or jala meaning 'net'. These two derivations are combined to furnish a de­scription of Jalandhara as the place that \"bears (-dhara) the net or series of the goddess's flaming energies\"Y Most Hindus know that in the Kangra Valley, close to the modem town of Jalandhara in the Jammu region, there is a cave where natural gas leaks from cracks in the rock. The small flames that this produces are worshipped to this day as the manifest form of the goddess Jvalamukhi whose name literally means '(the goddess) whose mouth is made of flames'. 16 Kamariipa is harder to identify. The original name of this place, known to both early Hindu and Buddhist sources, is Kamaru. The Sanskritized form 'Kamariipa' is easily derivable from it. This place 15 mahajvalalisandlp tam dfptatejanalaprabham I mahajvaltivalifopam devyas tejo mahadbhutam I dhrtam yena pratapo syas lena tajjalasamjfiakam II KMT 2/50cd-51 \"Powerful with its series of great flames, the radiant energy (tejas) of the goddess is very astonishing.

These range from the accounts of the 6th-century Chinese Buddhist pilgrim Hsuan tsang, Muslim accounts from the 16th century onwards and 19th-century British archeolo­gists and travellers, as well as Sanskrit sources. Bakker (1983: 60f.) reports that the country of Jalandhara is said to have received its name from a Daitya king called Jalandhara. According to the Padmapura�:za, Jalandhara, the son of the Ocean and the Ganges, was given a part oflndia (jambudvfpa) for his residence. This country came to be known as Jalandhara. (PadmapurtiJ:za, Uttarakhanda, 4/3 ff.). Mythology identifies this area with the vast body of the demon Jalandhara who was slain by Siva in battle. The local tradition of the Kangra Valley, which is a part of this area, identifies Jalandhara's mouth with the goddess Jvalamukhi, whose shrine is located in the Valley. Examin­ing the sources at his disposal, Bakker perceives a connection between the location of this goddess and Jalandhara even without referring to the Tantras where this connection is explicit. 103"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"9l 8ourney in the CWorld of !he Cfan!ras is of great importance for the early Sakta -technically called Kaula - Tantras and the strongly Sakta-orientated Bhairava Tantras. This is largely because of its association with Matsyendranatha, the reputed originator of the Kaula teachings and therefore, by extension, all the Kaula Tantric traditions, including those of Kubjika, Tripura and Kali.17 Abhinavagupta praises him first, before all the other teachers he venerates at the beginning ofhis monumental exegesis of the Tantric schools known to him, the Ta ntraloka. Jayaratha, in his commentary on the Ta ntraloka, tells us that this is because Matsyendranatha is \"famous as the one who revealed all the Kula scriptures\".18 He was especially important for Abhinavagupta because the latter, like many Tantrics of the 11th-century Kashmir in which he lived, considered Sakta Kaula ritual and doctrine (kulaprakriya) superior to its Saiva­cum-Bhairava equivalent (tantraprakriya), with which it is blended both in the Tantras and Abhinava 's Ta ntraloka. 19 The many Kaula tra­ditions that link this site with such an important figure and its persist­ent identification with Kamakhya (modern Gauhati) in Assam lend credibility to the correctness of this identification. 17 For the sake of precision, it is important to specify that the Tantric (rather than 'folk' or Purlii).ic) worship ofKaU makes its first substantial appearance in the Bhairava Tantras. Although the Tantras of this group are centred on the worship ofBhairava, a fierce and erotic form of Siva, Kaula (i.e. early Slikta) Tantrism developed out of them. The adept (variously called sadhaka or, in the Brahmayamala, avadhuta) is identified in the rituals of many of these Tantras with Bhairava in order to satisfy the hordes ofYoginis who are his encompassing and otherwise dangerous followers. Klill and her numerous ectypes came to prominence in this context in the Bhairava Tantras. The unedited Jayadrathayamala, which is said to consist of 24,000 verses, is an important Bhairava Tantra. Dedicated virtually exclusively to the worship of this goddess in numerous forms, it is one of our oldest and most substantial sources of her worship. 18 sakalakulasastravatarakatayti prasiddhal:z I TA vol.

But despite the name and its undoubtedly early age, no testimonia have been traced in this manucript to allow us to be able to certify that this is the same text as the one to which Abhinavagupta refers. However, this may sim­ply be because the manuscript is incomplete. 23 OQ<;liyana is the spelling most commonly found in the primary sources to which I refer. However, the spelling UQQiyana is the one most popular in the secondary sources referred to here and in general.

Actual proof that the Swat Valley was known as UQQiyana is obtained from Tibetan travellers in the area.

The layout presented by the Nisisamciira, a Bhairava Tantra (see Map 5), gives pride of place to Kamatiipa as the main sacred seat. Its pre-eminent status is vividly symbolized by deriving it directly from the core of reality as the cosmogonic will (icchii), an identification suggested by the first member of its name Kamatiipa which literally means 'sexual desire'. This assumes the form of the foundation (iidhiira) wherein all creation resides and finds its support. This de­sire emanates the Point (bindu) and Sound (niida), which are the breath of the core as its pervasive vitality at rest within itself and in an ac­tive state, respectively. U<,l<,liyana, to the right, is the Point and PiirQagiri, to the left, is the Sound. Abhinava rejects the possibility of a fourth seat in the centre, even one that some refer to as a \"half (i.e. not fully formed) sacred seat\" (ardhapltha).25 This layout also pro­duces a reasonably well-shaped triangle, although it is not equilat­eral, unlike the one of the first scheme (see Map 1: triangle traced in black). The Nisisamciira knows of the existence of Jalandhara but relegates it to the status of a secondary site (upasamdoha), along with the borderlands of India, Nepal, Kashmir and \"the direction in which foreigners (live) (mlecchadik)\". Perhaps, when the Nisisamciira was redacted, Jalandhara, along with these other places, had not yet gained the importance it was to have later.26 25 A 'half-sacred seat' (ardhaprtha) added on to the three main ones appears also in the Kaulajiitinanin:zaya (Bagchi: 24). There it is called Arbuda which is the Sanskrit name of what is now a sacred site especially fo r the Jains, namely, Mount Abu in Rajasthan. 26 Largely on the basis ofthese references, Dviveda states in his introduction to the Nityfi!jo{iasiktir7Java (p. 81) that there were originally three primary seats, not four. This view is examined and rejected by Bakker (1993: 50-2). In support ofDviveda's thesis we may note that the Kubjika Tantras vacillate between a scheme of three seats and one of four. The transmission of the Kubjika teachings takes place through three lineages (o/i) namely that of the Eldest (jye!ftha), Middle One (madhyama) and Child (btila). They were propa­gated by three Siddhas from three sacred seats, in successive ages. The eld­est Siddha was Oc;lc;lisanatha who taught in Oc;lc;liyana (also spelt Uc;lc;liyana).

The importance of Uc;lc;liyana would not allow its omission in the later scheme and so it was conveniently placed in the centre to sym­bolize not its location, but excellence. A more realistic variant found in the Kubjika Tantras, which lends further credence to the realism of the triangular model, locates Orilkarapitha, that is, possibly, the town ofOrilkaresvara in Madhya Pradesh, in the centre. Although this site is not in the literal geographical centre, it does, at least, lie within the triangle. 27 Let us return to the Kubjika Tantras to examine in greater detail their symbolic geography of the core reality- the goddess's trian­gular Yoni. As is the case with Tantric deities in general, one of the fundamental aspects of the goddess Kubjika is her aniconic form as mantric sound. This is portrayed as the pure dynamic energy from which the universe is generated, of which the universe consists and into which it ultimately is resolved. In this perspective, the Triangle, representing the unified field of universal energy, through which the cycles of existence are perpetuated, consists of the primary energy of the fifty phonemes of the Sanskrit alphabet that together constitute the womb of mantras. Laid out in a triangular diagram (prasttira ), 28 was Mitraniitha who taught in Kamariipa. Although this setup concurs with the strong triadic tendency apparent in the symbolism of the Kubjika Tantras, it Jacks the symmetry and completeness of a quatemity. There are four Ages (yuga), not three. Moreover, as U<.fQ.iyiina is the first seat, and hence the original source of the teachings, it should be in the centre and not in a comer of the triangle. So we find that practically from the earliest Kubjikii Tantras an extra, fourth Siddha is added. He is Caryiinatha. His name, as the texts them­selves say is more an epithet than a proper name, derived from his assiduous Tantric practice (carya). The other three Siddhas could also be called Caryanatha. Thus he appears to be Jess substantial than the others and his seat - Jalandhara -was originally a convenient addition. 27 See Ambqmatasamhita, fols. lOb-I Ia, where Orhkara replaces U<.f<.fiyai,la. Cf. also KMT 24/83. 28 The wordprastara simply means 'grid' or 'diagram'. This term is used in this sense in other types of Sanskrit texts as well. Thus, for example, Sanskrit musicological texts use this term to denote a diagram or 'graph' (as Lath calls it) 'on which the notes (svara) and microtones (sruti) of a musical scale 108"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Cfhe 9nner cpifgrimage of !he Cfanlras called Meru, they are assigned to forty-nine small triangles drawn within the triangle.

This is why KuQ.<;lalini, the inner form of the goddess as Speech, is likened to a serpent with three and a half coils. Each letter is worshipped as a Bhairava or a Siddha. Each one of them lives in his own compartment that is itself a Yoni, said to be 'wet' with the divine Command (ajfia) of the energy of the transmission that takes place through the union they enjoy with their female counterparts who reside there with them. The sacrality of sacred sites is derived from such hierogamies and so each compartment corresponds to a sacred site where these Siddhas are said to reside, practise and teach. These sites have been plotted on Maps 1 and 2.

And this is, indeed, the order in which they are listed in the Kumarikakha1,1<}a 32 of the Manthanabhairavatantra as the places the goddess converts into sacred sites (ayatana, tirtha, samdoha) by visiting and casting her empowering gaze upon them in one of her colonizing rounds of India.

This sacred seat has emerged on top of the triangular Yoni, above the Half Moon. The supreme KlUI, who illumines divine knowledge, is located there.

This relation­ship is established to allow for the exteriorization of the letters and so, by extension, the sacred sites onto the surface of the body. In this case, the Triangle contains the goddesses of the female form of the alphabet, which is itself a goddess called Malini (lit. 'Garlanded One', ·i.e. the goddess who wears the Garland of Letters). The figure of a standing man identified with a fo rm of a Bhairava (or Siddha) called Srikat:J.tha (who is the guardian of the first letter of the alphabet) is the male form of the alphabet called Sabdarasi - the Aggregate of Words. This is the male Person (puru$a) who resides within Nature identified, by implication, with the Triangle. In this way the Triangle with the letters it contains, the Bhairavas that preside over them, and the places that symbolically enshrine their energies can be projected onto the body (see Fig. 2). An interesting consequence of these symbolic associations is that the letters that are extracted from the Triangle to form mantras are not only pervasive sounds and deities, but also places. Accord­ingly, we occasionally find in the Kubjika Tantras that the letters extracted from the triangular diagram to form mantras are labelled with the name of the place to which they symbolically correspond rather than the Siddha or Bhairava, which is much more common. In this perspective, this means that mantras are interiorizations of sa­cred places. This startling symbolic association is the result of an important principle, namely, that each deity must be associated with a place in order to be effectively immanent and hence an object of the worship by which it is propitiated to bestow its gifts. Thus the deities of the letters of a mantra, which is the sonic icon of its presid­ing deity, in order to be effective and hence render the mantra effec­tive, must carry along within themselves their own divine locations.

It presents an ulterior elaboration of this scheme and so can be safely assumed to postdate the Kumarikakhanda. The fact that the number of places listed makes exactly fifty clearly indicates that they have been compiled and standardized for a specific purpose and are not simply lists of sacred sites. That the list in the Kumarikakhanda, in particular, is a standard one is confirmed by the fact that it appears, with just a few variant entries, in the Yo ginlhrdaya, which is an important Tantra of the Tripurii cult. All of these texts are certainly prior to the 12th century. sale copies of the commentary on various chapters of the Safslihasrasarhhita (both of which are also largely unpublished). The latter is an expanded ver­sion in 6,000 verses of the Kubjilaimatatantra consisting of 3,500 verses. For a basic table comparing the contents of these two texts, see Schoterman 1982: 14ff. 35 Although implied in the first reference in the KuKh noted already (foot­note 32 above), the collocation of the sites within the Triangle is only made explicit in KuKh 51122. There, after having listed the fifty sites again, the text says: \"These are said to be the sacred seats which are extolled as (the group of) fifty. They have arisen in accord with the sequence of emanation by moving in an anti-clockwise direction.\" We have noted already that the letters are projected into the Triangle in the same anti-clockwise direction and so it is clear that the text here implies that these site are to be projected into it in the same way. We should note in passing that the passage KuKh 51/ 15cd-25ab is probably drawn from YKh (2) 2411-10 where this short section is aptly labelled pifhameruprastlira. 112"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Cfhe 9nner CJ>i/grimage of the Cfanlras As we have noted already, the KMT belongs to at least the 11th century. The Yo ginlhrdaya contains many notions elaborated by Kashmiri Saivites between the 9th and 11th centuries. 36 However, there is no certain mention of the text prior to the 13th century.37 Moreover, Amrtananda, who states that his commentary was the first ever made on the YHr, probably lived in the late 13th or in the 14th century in South India. 38 Another indication of its relatively recent origin is its high degree of domestication. The liturgy centred on the worship of Sricakra that it expounds can be performed entirely in one place - at home, in a temple or monastery - by a householder or non-itinerant ascetic. Unlike the Kubjika Tantras and Abhinava's 36 Padoux ( 1994: 15) lists some of them. But note that, although there is a similarity in many respects with non-dualist Kashmiri Saivism, important fu ndamental notions of that system that are missing in the YHr itself are supplimented by Amrtananda in his commentary. Thus, for example, Padoux points out that Amrtiinanda \"characterises sa kti by vimarsa , the supreme god­head beingprakasavimarsamaya. The term vimarsa , typical ofK�emariija's Pratyabhijfiii, is not found in the YHr itself' (ibid. p.l 5). This means that the most fundamentally characterizing feature of non-dualist Kashmiri Saivism namely, its conception of ultimate reality and the Self as an energetic, self­reflective 'I-ness' (ahambhava) consisting of presentation (prakasa) and re­flective awareness (vimarsa), is missing. Thus, the world view in the YHr is strangely reminiscent of the early forms of non-dual Kashmiri Saivism which were similarly devoid of this fundamental notion (see above, chapter 1). We find the same is the case with the metaphysics ofVamanadatta, a non-dualist Vai�Qava who lived in Kashmir during the early period of the development of Kashmiri Saivism (see above, chapter 3). However, we should not be too hasty in assigning an early date to the YHr on this basis. There are passages in the YHr that reflect K�emaraja's version of the Pratyabhij fia (Padoux 1994: 10 n. 5 referring to Sanderson). One of them, at least, comes very close to the notion of \"I-ness\" to which I am referring (i.e verse 1/56) but does not go all the way. Nonetheless, here we have evidence that the YHr post-dates K�emaraja who, as Abhinavagupta's most distinguished disciple, lived into the middle or second half of the II th century. 37 Jayaratha, who lived in 13th century Kashmir, quotes some five verses from the YHr in his commentary on the Vti makeivaramata (also called Nitya:;ocjasiktin:zava). This, Padoux tells us, is the earliest mention of this text (Padoux 1994: 10). 38 Ibid., p. 12. 113"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"91 floumey in !he CWorld of !he 'Tanlras Ta ntrtlloka, it makes no provisions at all for the possit ility of any real peregrination to these sites, not even as a secondmy alternative or along with their projection on the body. Thus, as in the Ta ntrtlloka, in which Abhinavagupta, a master of the theory and practice of interiorization, expounds a thoroughly domesticated cult, the pro­jection of these sacred sites onto the body is of relatively minor importance. According to the liturgy of the Yo ginfhrdaya, .he placing ofthe fifty seats on the body is the sixth of a sixfold _J;ojection onto the body that is done at the beginning of the rite. Th-: first of these depo­sitions is that of fifty Gm:J,esas, one for each letter of the alphabet. This is done to remove obstacles to the performance of the rite. Then comes a deposition of the nine planets and twenty-seven constella­tions (nalcyatra). The six Yoginis presicling over the six Wheels (cakra) within the body come next. They govern the gross elements and mind along with the physical constituents of the body (dhatu). They are accompanied by an entourage of fifty Yoginis who govern the fifty letters of the alphabet, the phonemic equivalents of the forces within the Wheels that operate within the adept's cosmic body. Once the inner, subtle body has been energized in this way, the fifth deposition is performed, which is that of the twelve signs of the zodiac (raii). Thus, the outer body has been freed of obstacles, transformed into the universe, and its central vitalizing axis is energized. Finally, this process is completed by the projection of the fifty sacred sites, corre­sponding to the letters, onto the surface of this cosmic body. In this way, the body is prepared as a pure, cosmic and energized surface of inscription onto which the adept projects the Sricakra in which he will worship and become one with his deity. Thus Sricakra is drawn on the whole of the sacred land ofBharata, which is set in the spheres of the cosmic forces with which it is vitally linked and forms an essential part. From the point of view of the present inquiry, there is one im­portant feature of this group of fifty places. Not only are the indi­vidual places the same as those found in the Kubjika Tantras, but the order in which they are listed is such that when they are projected onto a triangular grid in the manner prescribed in the Kubjika Tantras, we find the main sacred seats -Kamarupa, Jalandhara, P11n:tagiri 114"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"crbe 9nner cpi/grimage of !he Cfanlras and U<;l<;liyana -in the comers and centre, in the way noted above. The Sriv idya system does not utilise this grid and so this serial order is of no consequence for it. This leads one to suppose that the group has been lifted wholesale from the Kubjika Tantras or a common source. However, the latter possibility would only be a feasible op­tion if other early Tantric systems had the same grid as the one found in the Kubjika Tantras with these sites projected into it. Up to now none has been found although the use of grids of this sort to extract the letters of mantras is not uncommon practice. We can observe it in the Tantras of various schools. Their shapes may vary as does the manner in which the letters are distributed within them. Thus the Srlrasamahodadhi, for example, quoted by Jayaratha in his commen­tary on the Vamake.Svaramata, describes a similar triangular grid. But the arrangement of the letters within it differs fr om the one in the grid we are examining. 39 Indeed, despite the importance of the Meruprastara in the Kubjika Tantras, it is not common in other Tantric sources. The only other place I have been able to trace it so far is in a Buddhist Tantric text. This is the Ta ttvajfianasamsiddhi by Sunya­samadhivajra whose original name was Divakaracandra. His teacher was Pail).<;iapatika, also called Avadhutapada. Significantly, perhaps, Sunyasamadhivajra is said to have written this work without the per­mission of his teacher. Is this because he drew from Tantras of other schools? If so, were Kubj ika Tantras among his sources? 40 Moreover, there can be little doubt that the projection of the main sites onto the grid is a development that took place in the Kubjika Tantras. 'The first description found in the Kubjika Tantras of how this grid should be drawn occurs in chapter four of the KMT (4175--80). This chapter of the KMT is drawn directly from the Ta ntrasadbhava, which is an important Trika Tantra.41 If we compare 39 See p. 45 of the Sanskrit text and Finn 1986: 238 n. 320 for a diagram of this grid. 40 See Banarasi La! 2000: 43 - 72. 41 Chapters four, five and six of the KMT are basically chapters three, six and eight of the TS. See Goudriaan and Schoterman 1988: 488ft'. for a table of some of the major variants between the readings in the two texts.

Thus in the TS we read: \"Deposit the group of vowels starting from the north-east in (the regular alphabetical) sequence (into the grid). At the end of that (se­ries of vowels, deposit) the consonants (in due order) until they reach the centre (of the grid). The god called Harilsa (i.e. the letter HA), the great soul, is in the abode ofBrahma (in the centre).\" Whereas the KMT says: \"Write (the letters) beginning with the letter A from Kamariipa (onwards) in this way successively. The vowels and consonants (should be written) according to the shape (of the triangle yathavrtti) until they reach the centre. 0 goddess, the great called Harilsa of the great soul is in O<;i<;iiyana.\" 42 The identification of the starting point, that is, the lower cor­ner of the downward pointing triangle with Kamariipa and the centre with U<;i<;iiyana is enough for the adept, as it is for us, to infer the presence of the other seats in the remaining comers.43 Thus there can be no doubt that the presence of the main sacred seats was inducted into the triangle of letters originally described in the TS, a major Trika Tantra. Finally, the' texts themselves confirm that, when they were compiled, this triangle, symbolically called the Island of the Moon, with these sacred seats from which the Siddhas were said to have promulgated the teachings, was specific to the Final Tradition (pascimamnaya), that is, the Kubjika Tantras.44 Thus in one of them we read: 42 The Sanskrit of these two passages is as follows: Isanytidi krame1Jaiva sannyaset [ k kh g: sabhyaset] svaramal}(ialam Ill 00 II tasyante tu tata/:1 [ k kh g: tat a] spars a yavan madhyam upagatti/:1 [ kh: -ta] I brahmasthtinagatam devam hamsakhyam tu mahtitmana/:1 II 101 II TS 3/l OOcd-1 01 ktimarilpad aktiradau likhed evam kramel}a tu I svarti/:1 sparsti yathavrttyti yavan madhyam uptigata/:1 II o#iyanagatam devi hamstikhyam tu mahtitmana/:1 I KMT 4/79-80ab. 43 See figure 1 on p. 169. 44 See footnote 55. 116"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"crbe 9nner CJ>i/grimage of !he 'Tanlras \"The Gestures (mudra), the Siddhas and the four sacred seats, have (all) been brought down (to earth) onto the Island of the Moon (i.e. the triangular mm:ujala).

Thus it appears that by that time this set was considered to be, at least by the author of the Yoginzhrdaya, a standard one. This suggests that by the 11th or 12th century, when these manipulations were being elaborated, pilgrimage by Tantric ini­tiat�s to these sites was already becoming redundant. Finally, by the time the Yo ginlhrdaya was written, it may well have become totally so. What remained was the projection onto the body and other tech­niques of transposition that served, amongst other things, as a means of purifying the adept. We have seen how this worked in the case of the Tantric system taught in the Yo ginzhrdaya; let us now return to the Nisisamcaratantra, and see how it functions there. Abhinavagupta chooses this as his source for the sacred sites that are projected onto the body of the neophyte as a part of the pre­liminary rites of purification that form the prelude to the rite of ini­tiation. This deposition is performed immediately after the ritual bath­ing and precedes the important deposition of the letters onto the body. Abhinava is following a model already formed for him in the Tantras themselves. The projection of the sacred sites onto the body serves to transform it into a sacred universe, the geography of which is marked by these sacred sites. We have already noted that according to the Nisisamcara the ultimate goddess site (pztha) is Siva's will, which is identified with the most important sacred seat, namely, Kamartlpa. The cosmogonic Sound (nada) and the primordial, dimensionless Point (bindu) from which the cosmic process unfolds are the sacred seats ofPun:tagiri and U<,!Qiyana. Similarly, the three subsidiary seats (upapltha) are said to be KuQ<,lalini and the first derivatives of Sound and the Point. Externally, these three correspond to Devikota, 45 mudrab siddhas catu/:1 prthM candradvrpe 'vataritab I pradhanab pascimamnaye aprasiddhanyadarsane II KuKh 60/70 117"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"91 8ourneg in !he CWorld of !he Cfanlras KolHigiri, and Ujjayini. This is followed by another triad, that of the three samdohakas.46 These are the sense of taste (/a/anti, lit. 'the tongue'), a tertiary derivation of the Point (bindu) and Pervasion ( vyapti), from which sacred energy emanates. These correspond to Pux:tc;iravardhana, Varendra and Ekamra, respectively. Around these three triads, arranged on the eight petals of the 'lotus of the heart', are twenty-four more sacred places. They are eight primary sacred fields (lcyetra), eight secondary ones (upalcyetra) and eight second­ary samdohas. These three groups are located on the main part of the petals, the tips and joints between them, respectively. A grouping in three sets of eight and projection onto a lotus in a similar way is known to the Kubjika Tantras. This developed from an original set of twenty-four sites presented without internal differen­tiation.47 These are the twenty-four sites of the KMT plotted on Map 6. It is, I believe, very significant that these twenty-four places are, apart from a few minor variants, the same as those listed in the Madhavakula section of the Jayadrathayamala quoted by Abhinava­gupta. Not only are the entries in the two lists virtually the same, they are practically in the same order.48 This coincidence tells us that when these Tantras were redacted, these places were already consid-46 The terms samdoha and upasamdoha are of uncertain derivation. They are also found in Buddhist Tantras in this or a similar fo rm (such as chandoha) (See HT 1/7110-8). Jayaratha, the commentator on the Ta ntrtiloka, derives the term from the root samduh, meaning to milk, suck, or ooze (milk). Thus he says that \"a samdohaka (is what has been milked) because it consists mainly of the exuded secretion of the secondary seats\" (samdohaketi upa­plthani}:rsyandaprayatvtit I T A, vol. VI p. 2489). 47 It appears that apart from the grouping together of the most important seats, Kaman1pa and the rest, the division of other such sites into separate subsets is neither uniform nor significant. 48 The entries and their order coincide in the two lists up to the eighth entry in the Jayadrathayamala list, namely, Sripitha. The KMT lists Srikota. That this is another name fo r Devikota is confirmed by the corresponding entry in the list found in the commentary on the Satsahasrasamhitti (25/8).

This is a mistake for Marukesa. The correspond­ing entry in the commentary in the SatSS, Marukesvara, confirms this.

Such omissions are transgressions of the Rule (samaya), as a result of which the adept's strength fails (glani) and obstacles afflict him. Worshipping these sacred places along with the goddesses who reside there, their weapons and the protectors of the field (lcyetrapala) can purify the adept who has thus sullied himself. It seems that a literal pilgrimage is enjoined here because the Tantra goes on to say that if the adept cannot do this or is lazy, he can purify himself by simply praising the sacred seats.49 The worship of these and other sites is a regular feature of all Kaula ritual. It is a major feature of the Kubjika Tantras which, therefore, contain many such hymns dedi­cated to the sacred seats. In this case this means reciting the verses in the Tantra in which these twenty-four places are listed in the morning just after getting up or before going to sleep. The Tantra promises that even if the initiate has committed terrible sins, he is respected (sammata) by the Mothers (Matrka) who reside there. Moreover, the adept can recite the hymn when he is in the sacri­ficial area where the rites of the goddess are performed, in front of Kubjika's MaJ:l(iala, her icon, or a Liriga. He may also recite it stand­ing in water when he malces his ablutions. In this way, we are told, calamities, poison, fire, water or disease do not overcome him. 50 The Tantra supplies an alternative, more elaborate, method of worshipping these places if the adept is overcome by great fear (mahabhaya). To remedy his distress, he should fashion twenty-four circles (ma1J.rja/a). These are divided into four groups of six, one group for each direction starting with the east. Flowers of various colours are offered -in the east white, south yellow, west red, and north dark blue. Ajar full of water is placed in the centre. A lamp is placed in each of the twenty-four circles. The adept should then move around through these replications of the sacred seats in due order. He should do this for a day and a night. Having passed the night keeping him­self well under control, he should then make offerings of meat and wine (technically called virabhojya). Then he should propitiate the sacred seats, prostrating before them repeatedly.

Finally, we may note that the name of the chapter of the KMT where this is taught is appropriately called \"the Pervasion of the Whole and the Parts\". The Satsahasrasamhita presents an interesting interiorization of this replication of the twenty-four sites. In this Tantra they figure as the components of the Wheel ofthe Sun, which, along with those of the Fire and Moon, are the three enclosures of the Wheel of the Skyfaring Goddesses (khecarfcakra)51 located in the upper extremity of the yogic body. They are divided into three groups, according to whether they are primary or secondary Sacred Fields (lcyetra, upa/cy etra) or meeting grounds (samdoha). The sites are arranged on the petals of the lotus in four groups of six. There are two sacred fields on the first two petals. Then there are two secondary sacred fields on the next two petals and two meeting grounds on the following two. The remaining three groups of six are placed on the remaining petals in serial order in the same way. These twenty-four places, arranged in this way on the petals of the lotus, correspond to the twenty-four principles of existence (tattva) ranging from Earth to Nature (prakrti). Thus a connection is made with the principles of existence that constitute the whole of empirical reality, not just the body. The pilgrimage to the sacred places takes the adept around the manifest universe. The stops on the journey are linked in a developing progression, which is at the same time, in a seemingly paradoxical manner, circular. When he reaches the upper 51 Chapter 25 of the SatSS opens with a beautiful description of this Wheel. Bhairava says to the goddess: \"0 fair-faced one! I will (now) tell (you about) the great Wheel of the Skyfaring Goddesses. (Shaped like a lotus), its sprouts are the worlds and it is adorned with the parts of Mantras (pada) as its leaves.

The goddess establishes a sacred geography to delineate her specific worldly domain and so colonize site, city, region, country and the world through her descent from the tran­scendent. She thereby spreads the teachings concerning her and the geography thus established and internalized in her Tantric system. In this system, as in most others of its kind, time and location serve as the prerequisites for the delineation of the specific entities that lend their identity to the energies, which are internally configured so as to replicate their concrete, external existence in ideally perfect geomet­ric patterns and regular rhythms. These geometries and rhythms con­stitute the system in its complexity and, hence, its spiritual trans­formative power. Specific forms, places and time thus become ideal ciphers that mark the configuration and development of abstract tran­scendent reality, which becomes immanent at first as sacred geometries within the divine consciousness of the deity so as to con­stitute its Body of Energies (kulapi!J.(ia), the latter then being repli­cated in the body of the adept.53 This then is the intermediate reality that is vitalized by the universal,. abstract energy from the upper tran­scendent reality. This energy flows out to the chaotic configurations of outer concrete entities that, by lending this energy their forms, concretize the transcendent, rendering it amenable to approach. In 52 This material has been drawn from $atSS 25/2-9. Here is, it seems to me, a fine example of how pilgrimage is conceived. The pilgrim's route, rather than being a representation ofthe path to liberation, which would be straight, is more of the nature of a circumambulation of sacred space. This is done not to achieve liberation but to propitiate the deities of the sacred space and gain benefits then:oy. 53 The KMT explains that the teaching concerning the Body. of Energies (kulapif}c}a) is the practice of the Sequence ofthe Sacred Seats and the Body (pif}c}a).

Accordingly, the root Tantra of the Kubjika cult begins by delin­eating this sacred geography, and in so doing explains the origins of the goddess herself. This starts from the goddess's land of origin, the Santiinabhuvana -the World of the Lineage. This is presented as the 'outside world' of myth. Its three peaks, arranged in a triangle, enclose an idyllic land behind the Himalaya 54 to the west of Meru. 55 Internally this is located at the top of the Twelve Finger Space above the head (see Fig. 4). This is the hermitage ofHimavat, who receives Bhairava with such devotion that the god grants him a number of boons. 56 Himavat, by way of recompense, introduces Bhairava to his daughter, the virgin (kumiirikii) Kalika who asks him to be the deity she worships. Bhairava responds by imparting to her a vision of the universe and insight into the energy that sustains it. This is the divine Command (iijiiii) that was transmitted through the six lineages of the six accomplished adepts (siddha) who were the disciples ofMatsyendranatha, who, as we have seen, is the legen­dary founder ofKaulism in this age. 57 The places where the six disci­ples received initiation and whence they, spread the teachings are listed in Tantras of different schools. 58 These places clearly belong to the geography of the early Kaula Tantras.

He then disappears telling her to go to Mount Kaumara. 60 She abandons her companions and, in order to seek her god, she goes to the Mountain of the Moon, which she ascends, there to assume the form of a Linga in which the entire universe is enveloped. The god now begins to worship the Liilga, called Udyanabhairava, and asks the goddess to abandon her unmanifest form. Accordingly, the goddess bursts apart the Liilga and emerges out ofit.61 Then the goddess imparts her grace 60 KMT l/48-54. In the SatSS this place is identified with Srisa ila, which is the sacred seat ofMatailga. Internally, it is the trunk of the body up to the neck. 61 KMT 2/3. The theme of the goddess emerging from the Litiga is well known. In the Devlmtihtitmya of the Marka1;rjeya Purti1Ja Mahamaya \"rent open the Siva Linga and came fo rth\". The same is stated in the Kalik4 Purti1Ja (76/83-93). A similar conception, namely that this primordial energy comes from the Person (puru.�a) is found in the Bhagavadgitti (1514). The idea is well known to the Saivasiddhanta, according to which spheres of energy (kala) emerge from the Lili.ga. Sricakra is also worshipped in association with the Linga and is sometimes even drawn on it. Banerjee (1974: 508) tells us that a \"unique image was discovered in the ruins ofVikrampur, within the limits of the ancient capital of the Senas and their predecessors, in the quarter ofthe town known as Kagajipara.\" He goes on to descibe it as \"four feet in height. It shows in its lower part a well-carved Sivalinga, from the top of which emerges the half-length figure of a fo ur-armed goddess with her front hands in the dhytinamudrti, the back hands carrying a rosary and a manuscript. The Devi is profusely ornamented, and her beautifully carved youthful face with three eyes has a serene meditative expression.\" It is reproduced in Plate XLV, 2 ofBanerjee's book. He identifies it as Mahamaya. The iconography Banerjee describes corresponds to that of the goddess Para. Although this figure may not be that of the goddess Kubjika, who is frequently identified with both Para and Mahiimaya, she could well be depicted in this way. 124"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"crbe 9nner CfJt/grimage of !he Cfan!ras to the god. Then she goes to various places where she recruits the resident goddess who, 'sporting' (sexually) with a Siddha, an aspect of Bhairava, generates spiritual sons and daughters. The first place the goddess visits is the Kula mountain. This is Sriparvata, called Kumara. When the goddess looks at it, Sri, the goddess of royal power and wealth, suddenly becomes manifest, so it is called Srisaila. She draws a line on the ground with her toe and so creates a river that serves as a boundary. She establishes the god­dess Chaya there and gives her the command that whoever enters that sacred area will be her equal. The goddess continues her journey to Mount Trik11ta and then to Mount Ki1;lkindha. In these places she gives the power of her command and graces the demons who protect them (ralcyasa ). She then goes to the shore of the ocean, where she stands for a while, and so there she is Kanyakumari. Then, having graced the ocean, she goes to a cave called Daradar.u,i i. There the goddess assumes the form of Shade ( chayadhari), her mind set on the Unmanifest. She then goes a long distance to the western Himagahvara. The forest goddess (vanapallika)62 Olambika resides there. The goddess is pleased and declares that this place is called U<;l<;liyana because she flew up into the sky there.63 She resides there in the Krta Age along with her consort U<;l<;lamahesa, who is Mitrananda, a founder of the Kubjika tradition. There, she is called Raktacamul)<;ia.64 She then goes to Karala. The place is said to be brilliant with radiant energy; it is therefore renamed Jalandhara, the place of the flame -jvala. The burning radiance of the goddess's flames has been awakened and she sees countless marvelous creations like those produced by magic (indrajala -here too, apparently, an etymology is implied). She won­ders what this marvelous creation is. She is told that although she has fa llen because of the god's great energy, she has not fled from it and so she is addressed as the one who extends the net (jala) ofMaya. She is told that she will be given lordship over Jalandhara.

By virtue of the Yoga (vi$uva­yoga) by which she has done all this, she becomes the mistress of the mountain which is identified with Pufl!agiri. Her authority is exerted at the end of the Dvapara Age. Her consort is Cakrananda.66 The goddess then goes to a place called Kamika. There is a river there called Ucchu�ma, there in the forest of Mahocchu�ma. In the same forest there are two lakes. One is called Mahahrada and the other NI!a. Here the Great Goddess again meets the local goddess, who is \"melting with passion and melts the three worlds with (her) desire\". Kubjika is pleased to see her and names her Kamesvari-the 'Mis­tress of Passion'. She explains that the nature of the sacred seat where Kamesvari resides is her passion itself (ktimarupa) and so this place is the sacred seat Kamarupa where the goddess Kamesvari resides in the Age of Strife (kaliyuga). Her consort will be Candrananda. Seated on the Wind and passionate, he is Kamadeva - the God of Love himself. This completes the formation of the four main sacred seats.67 The god goes on to talk of a fifth sacred seat (associated with the Kula of Matali.ga) which is located in the northern part of Lake NI!a in the forest of Mahocchu�ma, located in Madhyadesa. The whole universe is generated from it. This sacred seat is said to be located in the middle, above the sacred seat ofKama.lt is filled with three streams (srotas), and so the goddess there is Trisrota and her form is that of a river.68 Presumably, this place is the Trisrota referred to previously. The goddess then goes to the eight places where the Eight Moth­ers (Matrka) are located (see Map 7). Not only Tantric meeting grounds (samdoha) but also sacred bathing places (tlrtha) are created wher­ever the goddess goes and casts her gaze. The virgin goddess -Kumarika-thus spreads her fame throughout the land ofBharata, so that it becomes a veritable part of the goddess (kumtiriktikha1Jrja).69 66 Ibid. 2/63cd-81. 67 Ibid. 2/82-100. 68 Ibid. 211 01-11. 69 Ibid. 21118. 126"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"CJbe 9nner cpifgrimage of !he Cfan!ras Once she has completed her journey around India she can unite with the god.

Then the god disappeared in an instant. It appears at first sight that the goddess is tra velling all around India to visit the major Sakta sites. In fact the story of this pilgrimage records, at least from when she reaches Himagahvara, the local repli­cation of pan-Indian sites, especially the most important of them -the four sacred seats. The phenomenon of replication, which is fun-70 This is according to KuKh 6/223cd-225. The reading of the name of the god who resides in this place according to the KMT (2/121-2), where these verses originate, is O<,iramahesana (MS C: o<;lram-; D: oddra-; FH: odra-) and the name ofthe place U<;l<;lapitha (MSs CK: o<;!ra-; HJ: o<;l<;!ra-; D: utta-). The place where the teachings were originally propagated is called U<;lapitha in KuKh 7/59b. It is here that the three Siddhas, O<;I<;!Tsanatha, Sa:?thanatha and Mitranatha, received knowledge. As the first of these presides over O<;l<;liyana, this may imply that U<;lapitha should be distinguished from that. But the texts imply that the first of these three remained where the original transmission took place, whereas the other two went to two other seats which they fo unded namely, Sa�thanatha to Piirl)agiri and Mitranatha to Kamarupa. Thus we read in the Ykh (I) 14/16 that \"(the sacred seat of Om is placed first ... I praise (this) the first sacred seat\". In the next line it is called U<;lupitha. The same lines appear in Ykh (2) 5/18a. There the spelling is O<;IL The vari­ety of spellings of this place name add to the confusion. There can be little doubt, however, that we should not distinguish between an original seat and O<;l<;liyana! O<;la.

It may well be an indication of some confusion in the tradition itself which was propense, it seems to me, to make the land of O<;lra, that is, Orissa, an important, if not original, site of the spread of the teachings. One could reasonably speculate that this confusion was related to an uncertainty as to the location of O<;IT (= O<;l<;liyana), which was a very prestigious site. Jfiananetra, the fo under of the branch of the Kalikrama that associated itself with the Uttarapitha (the Northern Seat), is said to have received the original transmission in this place. It is identified in the Kalikrama Tantras with O<;l<;liyana. Moreover, as happens in the Kubjika 127"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"91 8oumey in !he CUJorld of !he Cfanlras damental to Pudil).ic sacred geography, is no less so in its Tantric coun­terpart. Thus the goddess reveals various aspects of herself in the places she visits and thereby replicates the location where this aspect is present in the macrocosmic India. She also infuses the local god­dess with her power as the Great Pan-Indian Goddess and so, as the Sakti of sakti, she becomes her essential nature. Another important feature of her colonizing tour is the hierogamies that take place in the individual places with aspects of the male deity, embodied in the adept who resides there. These unions, which are the source of the spiritual power of these places, generate the goddess's spiritual offspring, who form what the texts variously call a household (grha), lineage (anvaya, santati) or clan (gotra) through which the teaching is transmitted. A further development in the definition of the location of these places took place in the Satsahasrasamhita, where they are projected onto the head. This has been graphically represented in Figure 4. Worth noting is the position of the four major sacred seats, Oc;lc;liyana (also called Uc;lra) in the ears, Jalandhara in the mouth, Pufl).agiri in the uvula and Kamarupa in the eyes. This is because, the Tantra tells Tantras, it is also called the Omkarapitha (see Dyczkowski 1988: 182). The Kubjika Tantras seem to know about these connections with the Kalikrama because the goddess in U<;lu I O<;lipitha is said to be Kalasari1kar�iQi (Ykh (I) 14/17) who is the main form of the goddess in the Kalikrama. But somehow, it seems, the land of O<;Ira continued to come to the mind of those who con­tributed to the development of the Kubjika Tantras and so in the KMT there is some uncertainty. Finally, note that the name of the sixth chapter of the KuKh where these teachings are given is 'the Pervasion of the Sacred Seat of the Command'. According to the Sarhketapaddhati quoted by Vidyananda in his commentary on the NSA, the Artharatntivali, the 'Seat of the Command' (ajiiapifha) is O<;lupitha. Vidyananda explains that Paramasiva in the fo rm of Caryanatha presides there with his consort Kamesvari. She selects the three Siddhas, O<;l<;liSa, Sa�tha and Mitra, and places them in authority in the three seats of Purri1agiri, Jalandhara and Kamarupa, respectively (NSA p. 220). This is an appropriate way of describing this place as it is from here that the goddess sets out to create all the other sacred sites. This is also the first seat into which the god and goddess are said to have entered 'together', at the beginning of chapter six of the KuKh where it is called U<;li (KuKh 6/6a) and unequivocally explained to be U<;l<;liyiina (= O<;l<;liyana). Thus, this is the First Seat (adyapifha) which is consistently recognised by the texts to be O<;l<;liyana, and so should not be confused with O<;lra, that is, Orissa. 128"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Cfbe 9nner Cf>i/gn'rnage of !he %nfras us, these four seats manifest when the goddess wishes to hear, speak, thrive and see, respectively. Sacred place is thus interiorized into the cognitive processes and metabolism. Two rivers flow from the Mahocchu�ma Forest located in the Cavity of Brahma at the top of the head into the two lakes represented by the eyes. Above the Cav­ity of Brahma is an inverted pyramid that resonates with a series of energies culminating with the Transmental (unmani) at the base of the pyramid. Thus the rivers that flow from the Cavity of Brahma represent the flow of spiritualizing energy that vitalizes sight. The culmination of this sacred geography is the upper triangle that forms the base of the pyramid (see Fig. 5). This triangle is signifi­cantly equated with a place called Candrapura, which the texts tell us is the \"home of the Pascima (i.e. Kubjika Tantras)\" (paicimagrha), and so is represented as the Vulva (yoni) of the goddess which is this tradition (pascimamnaya) itself. This interiorized representation of place is typical of the innumerable references to Candrapura, vari­ously interiorized and otherwise used as a key symbol in the Kubjika Timtras. The triangle emanates a circle called the Seat ofYoga (yoga­plfha), and the latter is identified with the main MaD<:lala of the Kubjika Tantras, namely, the Sariwartamaf.19ala. This is an interiorization of two locations. One is Candraparvata (the Mountain of the Moon) and the other is Candradvipa (the Island of the Moon). Candrasila (the Moon Rock) is in the centre and within it is Candraguha (the Cave of the Moon). All these 'places'- mountain, island, rock, and cave -are linked with the goddess. No less frequent is the association the later Kubjika Tantras make between the goddess and the land of Konka!fa. 71 This is a long strip ofland along the western coast oflndia known as the Western Ghats (see Map 2) that includes, in its southern part, the area nowadays familiar as Goa. Candrapura, located in the north of this region, was for several hundred years, up to the middle of the 11th century, the capital ofKonkana. This place is now called Chandor and is located in what is now west-central Mahara�tra. 71 Thus, fo r example, the Kumarikakhal)<,ia of the Manthtinabhairavatantra declares: \"Again, the Mother known as Kamala (Lotus) descended (to earth) in Korikal)a. That, indeed, is authority made clearly manifest in Korikal)a.\" (KuKh 17 /43cd-44) 129"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"91 fjoumey in the CZUorld of the Cfanlras We know of another Candrapura that fits the description found in the earliest Kubjika Tantra, the KMT, which unlike the later Kubjika Tantras makes hardly any reference to Kori.kal).a.72 This was an im­portant town in what is now the Garhwal district of the western Himalaya. Not far from it is a mountain called Candraparvata (the Mountain of the Moon). Moreover, the erratic identification of these places at times with Candradvipa (the Island of the Moon), further confuses the picture. Candradvipa is an island in the Bay of Bengal well known as the place where, according to a myth familiar to most early Kaula schools,73 including the Kubjika Tantras, Matsyendra­natha overheard Siva teaching Kaula doctrine to his consort. The similarity of these names, the prestige ofthese places and the strong lunar qualities of the goddess may have combined to create a com­posite mythical location made up of the combined replication of these three places. But whether these places can be located or not, the fact that the projections onto the head taught by the $atsiihasrasamhitii produce the forced symmetry they do is an indication of the original, external existence of these places. Thus compare and contrast the projection of the four main sacred seats along the axis of the body up to the neck/4 72 The only connection the goddess has with Koii.kaQa in the KMT is her identity as Koii.kaQavva (7/39) or Koli.kal)esanya (7/l8c, 30), the presiding goddess of the Weapon (astra), the last of the six limbs (miga) of her Vidya. These are the sole references to this place in the KMT. This fact is in sharp contrast with the frequent eulogies of this place along with the Dak�iQapatha (i.e. the Deccan) found in the later Kubjika Tantras, especially the KuKh and YKh of the MBT. 73 See introduction to Bagchi 1934. 74 KMT 1417-11 says that this standard set of four places is located in the body as fo llows: l) Oqqiyana- (the genitals?) below the navel; 2) Jalandhara- stom­ach; 3) Purrilagiri- heart; and 4) KamarOpa- throat. The Ciiicirilfmatasara­samuccaya, a late Kubjika Tantra, illustrates the ease with which it is possible to produce a symmetrical projection ofthe sacred seats onto the face. The method, the Tantra tells us, is drawn from the Siddhayogesvarimata, a prime authority fo r the Trika Tantrism Abhinavagupta expounds in the Ta ntraloka. This Tantra, in this case at least, substitutes Orilkarapitha (perhaps Orilkaresvara in modem Madhya Pradesh) for Oq<;tiyana. As the projection requires the simultaneous display of ritual gestures (mudra) it cannot be brought about by touching the 130"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"Cfhe 9nner Cf>i/grfmage of !he Cfanfras prescribed by the KMT. This is a perfectly symmetrical arrangement -which is certainly because it is purely ideal. One could hazard to say that, for the Satsahasrasamhita, the body serves as the locus of projection for the pan-Indian macrocosm and the head for its local­ized replication. Perhaps because the latter was no longer functional by the time of the redaction of the Satsahasrasamhita or because the cult had spread from its place of origin, the author of the Satsahasra­samhita chose to internalize it. He thus integrated the local geogra­phy into the overall system of interiorization of its macrocosmic coun­terpart that had already taken place in the KMT. Despite the thoroughness with which the sites and all that had to do with pilgrimage had been internalized, until the 1Oth or 11th cen­tury (the probable time of the redaction of the earliest Kubjika Tantras), if not later, the inju nction to actually visit these places was not modi­fied. The following passage from a Kubjika Tantra not only encour­ages the worship of the sacred seats, which can be done anywhere, but tells us of the fruits of visiting them in the standard style of pil­grimage texts: \"He who constantly worships the tr ansmission (krama) of the sacred seats that has come down through the sequence of the series (of teachers -paramparyakrama ), having known it thus, is himself Bhairava directly apparent. He who does the round of the sacred seats, whether he be a teacher (acarya) or an adept (sadhaka), is liberated. He is Siva directly apparent, he is (a true) member of the tradition and the best of teachers. By resorting (sevana) to the sacred seats, all (one's) countless sins are destroyed, whether one has committed brahminicide a thousand times (or even) if one has killed a myriad cows. So one should worship the four seats constantly. The desire of one (who does) so becomes an accomplishment (siddhi) and he is dear to the yoginis.\" 75 respective parts of the body, as is usually done. Instead, the Tantra prescribes that one must look at these locations, that is, visualize them there, in a manner reminiscent of how the goddess sacralizes sites by the energy of her gaze. The four sacred seats are located in the head as follows: 1) Orilkara-mouth; 2) Jala-right ear; 3) PliriJa -left ear; 4) Kamariipa-tip of the nose (CMSS 7/ 34). In this way a triangle is projected onto the face with Kamariipa in the centre. 75 KuKh 6/19lcd-5ab. 131"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"9I fjoumey in !he CWorld of !he Cfanlras That the injunction to visit these places should be taken literally is further reinforced by the warning that fo llows that the adept who goes or resides in these places should not be proud. 76 Peregrination to the sacred places is variously termed. It may be simply called a 'wandering' (atana, bhramar:za). This may be associated with the pi­ous wandering of the ascetic in search of alms (bhilcyatana)11 and, especially, begging for alms in the eight sacred Kaula places listed below. Accordingly, these places are called 'sacred seats of peregri­nation' (atanapitha). They are also the residences of goddesses, ac­complished adepts and Tantric partners who are represented as low­caste women or close female relatives. From this point of view they are called 'houses' (grha, ghara, veiman). Thus, according to the Kubjika Tantras, the eight major Kaula sacred sites each have a house occupied by a woman of low caste who is identified with a Mother (Matrka), as recorded in the following table 78 and plotted on Map 7. The second entry in bold records the identifications made by the Madhavakula and the Devyayama/a, both Kali Tantras that prescribe the worship of Kalasarhkar�aQ.I as the supreme form of Kali. 79 76 \"The Kaula adept (vera) who has entered Oc,l<.fiyana and cultivates pride (there) becomes poor and dies; (indeed) he lives (barely) for a month. A thief, river or terrible disease kills the deluded soul who is given to pride in Jlilandhara. He lives fo r (only) six months and dies along with his relatives. Or, again, he who despises (others) in the sacred seat (called) Piin)a and is proud dies by fire or else dies in the fifth month in a fierce battle. A blow by an invisible hammer falls on the head of one who, seated comfortably in Kliman1pa, acts proudly. He dries up along with his body and dies in the middle of the lunar fo rtnight. The teacher, 0 handsome one, who has been proud will go to hell.\" (KuKh 6/196cd-202ab) 77 KuKh 16/1-2. 78 The identifications of the resident low-caste women (who are referred to as goddesses) with the Eight Mothers {Mlitrkli) is according to KuKh 16/13-5. The identification of these female beings with the Mothers may not be an original part of the teachings of the Kubjikli Tantras. There are several places in the Kubjikli Tantras where these eight places with their low-caste resi­dents are listed as a group, with occasional variants, without associating them with the Mothers. This is the case in the KMT (25/90-Sab), which is cer­tainly the oldest of the Kubjikli Tantras and also, for example, in KuKh 14/ 78-80. The latter source supplies the inner equivalents (adhytitma).

The edition of the Ta ntrtlloka reads Kulagiri. 82 The edition of the Ta ntrtlloka reads ktirmukl. 83 This is the Cavity of Brahma on the crown of the head. 84 The KuKh calls this place Kotivar:?a, as does KMT (25/94).

A representative example of this replica­tion is the circle of Mothers that surround Bhaktapur (see Map 8).

A New Year festival that takes place in April serves, amongst other things, to commemorate the founding of the city of Bhaktapur. The founding of the city in this case effectively means the establishment of its sacred geography, of which the circle of Mothers is one of its cardinal features.

The secret liturgies of many, if not all, ofthe Kaula traditions (amnaya) in Bhaktapur take this set with these particular eight low-caste women associated with them as the standard format in which the Mothers are worshipped.

If any doubt re­mains that the Eight Mothers of Bhakta pur are derived from the Kubjika Tantras, the identification is confirmed by the fact that while the Moth­ers are being installed, one a night, on the border of the outer civic space, the principal goddesses on whom the Mothers attend are wor­shipped in the royal palace as the deities of the king, the state and the people. As one would expect, these goddesses include, in a prominent manner, the tutelary of the Malia kings, Siddhalak�mi. Indeed, the se­cret rite performed in the royal palace on the main day of the festival which mirrors the erection a large pole (yasiif) in a public place in Bhaktapur culminates with the erection of a flag pole and flag (dvajarohaiJ.a) to the goddess Siddhal�rni. Even so, the main goddess worshipped secretly in the course of this secret rite is Kubjika. Accord­ingly, the Mothers who are her attendants in the Tantras are those who are worshipped as her attendants in the city ofBhaktapur. This is sym­bolized by the collocation of the goddess Tripura in the centre of the circle, thus marking the 'true' (i.e. esoteric) centre of town. Although the public worship Tripura there in the form of an ani conic stone as a ninth Mother, initiates know that this is the place where initiates wor­ship their own lineage goddess, who may or may not be Tripura.89 89 Newar initiates frequently worship their own esoteric deities in place of the public ones. The public deity is venerated as the surface onto which the esoteric deity is projected and worshipped in secret. Notable examples of this phenomenon is the worship of the main Bhairava in Bhaktapur as Kubjika, Pasupati as Sikhasvacchanda Bhairava, and his consort Guhyaka!I as the goddess embodying the weapon (astra) of the goddess Kubjika. 135"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"9l f}oumey in !he CWorld of !he Cfanlras Here then we have a fine example of the replication of Tantric sacred geography mediated by its initial interiorization in the domes­tic rites of Newar Kaulas. We may note here one of the important fu nctions of inter1orization, namely that, once the initiate has interiorized a sacred geography, he can transport it within himself. Then, if his cult receives the necessary patronage, which occurs when, for example, a king becomes an initiate, he can project it outside.90 In this case this projection makes the foundation of the civic space a mesocosmic replication of Kaula geography. Thus it allows Newar initiates the possibility of visiting these places, as did their Indian Kaula ancestors. This example serves to demonstrate the need fo r the continuing existence of such places in the outer, public domain. Not only do the Mothers serve as demarcators and protectors of the sacralized civic space, it also makes the pilgrimage to their sacred sites possible. And the citizens ofBhaktapur do in fact do this on the occasion of the New Year's fe stival and the nine-day worship in au­tumn of Durga, who is the common public identity of each Kaula goddess. The pilgrimage to such places, whether by N ewars in their towns or by their predecessors in India, is undertaken as a vow ( vratacarya). The pilgrimage can be interiorized as a possible alternative to its actual performance. When this happens it is called the Vow ofKnowl­edge ( vidyavrata ). The KMT declares that, \"he who practises the Vow (vratacarya) and internalizes what is external achieves success 90 One ofthe many examples of this phenomenon can be seen in the temple of Sarilvara!Bde-mchog in Tsaparang. Tucci ( 1989: 43-5) has described this tem­ple, which contains detailed frescos of the ma1J¢alas of the Sarilvara cycle of the Buddhist Anuttarayoga Tantra. On one of the walls there are three mal)r/.alas representing the body, speech and mind of the enlightened adept. They are squares, on the sides 6f each of which are represented eight sacred Vajrayana sites in India. These sites correspond to those plotted on Map 9. Just as these sacred sites were transported to Tsaparang in this way, they travelled wherever Sarilvara was worshipped, including the entire Himalayan region. Thus Tucci remarks that \"now all these places are [found] through Zanskar, Kashmir, Kulu, the districts ofHazara and Swat\" (ibid.: 43). They were not only transposed in this way from place to place but were also internalized as the parameters of the adept's body, speech and mind. And, by means of another reversal, they marked spots of the giant body ofthe enlightened adept projected onto the landscape. 136"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"lfhe 9nner cpi/grimage of !he %nlras (siddhi)\".91 The practice of the vow is living in accord with one's ba­sic state of being (bhava); this is why the Tantra says that it is called the Vow of Knowledge. This basic state of being is full of awareness, through which the perceptible is. discerned in the course of cognition, and so the power of consciousness is awakened.92 The application and development of this awareness through spiritual discipline and its con­tinued maintenance in daily life, which is manifest in adherence to the rules of right spiritual conduct, is to live in accord with one's inner being, which is the internal Vow of Knowledge. As the Tantra says: \"Meditation, worship, the repetition of mantra, the fire sacrifice and the practice of the Rule (samayacara�Ja)-this is said to be the Vow of Knowledge. The external vow is not the best.\"93 Again: \"These places (sthana) I have mentioned are within the inner (Su­preme) Self (adhyatma) and are grounded in the individual soul. The eternal (Self), residing in the Wheel of the Heart, wanders constantly within them. As long as (a person) does not attain the inner teaching (adhyatmanirJ:Zaya) concerning the sacred seats, how can he have suc­cess (siddhi) even if he wanders (throughout) the triple universe?\" 94 But the Kubjika Tantras do not prescribe the elimination of the outer sacred sites or outer pilgrimage. Though the outer pilgrimage is fruitless without the inner, it serves a necessary function for those who are not yet fully developed.95 In order to achieve success both the internal and external vows should be practised together.96 As the Tantra says: \"Both the inner and outer aspects have an inner and outer condition.\" 97 91 KMT, 251121. 92 Ibid., 25/38. 93 KuKh, 14/22cd-23ab. 94 Ibid. 14/80cd-82ab. 95 Accordingly, a Kubjika Tantra succinctly states: \"The external sacred seats have been revealed in order to (instill) devotion in (common) people.\" (KuKh 14/83ab) 96 \"One who has thus performed the internal and external vow, (practised right) conduct and (applied the spiritual) means (st1dhant1), has success (siddhi). 0 god, (this is) the truth, without a doubt.\" (Ibid. 14/99cd-1 00ab) 97 Ibid. 14/82cd. 137"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"91 FJoumey in !he CfJJorld of !he Cfanlras One of the major aims of this vow coincides with that of the performance of penitential vows in general, including those suggested by the Dharmasastras, namely, the purification of the individual from sin. According to the Kubjika Tantras, this purification leads to lib­eration, just as the perf ormance of the vow in itself gives the adept magical and yogic power-siddhi. In order to understand the outer form of this and other such vows in a larger perspective, we should have to retrace its history right back to Vedic times and Vedic sacri­fices which demanded the observance of a range of vows on the part of the patron of the sacrifice (yajamana) and his officiants. For the specifically1 Saiva historical precedents, we would first have to turn to the (Lakulisa) Pasupatasutras belonging to the 3rd or 4th century. Then we would need to examine the Saivasiddhanta Agamas that fo llowed after. We could then proceed on to the Bhairava Tantras, which logically and in actual fact (some parts of them at least) were the immediate historical predecessors of the Kaula Tantras. These texts contain prescriptions for numerous vows (vrata). The unedited Brahmayamala is an example of a Bhairava Tantra that is especially rich in this respect. The important and likewise unedited Kali-cen­tred Jayadrathayamala also lists many such vows. These include the Vow ofMadness (unmattavrata), the Vow ofNakedness (nagnavrata), the Vow to Be Transvestite (strivesadharavrata), the Vow to Wear Red Clothes (raktavesadharavrata ), and many more, including the most famous of all, the Great Vow (mahavrata). This vow requires that the ascetic wander constantly from place to place imitating Bhairava's penance fo r having severed one of Brahma's heads. He should wear six insignia, namely, a necklace (ku!J.thika), neck orna­ment (rucaka), earrings (ku!J.c!ala), crest-jewel (sikhamaiJ.i), ashes (bhasma) and a sacred thread (yajnopavlta). Most important of all is the skull he should carry. The ascetics who observed this vow were accordingly called Kapalikas ('Skull Bearers'). The Brahmayamala 98 has been described as a Kapalika Tantra. This is partly because the fo rm of the cult it prescribes is relatively 98 It is worth noting in passing that the Hrahmaytimala recommends that the neophyte take initiation in a cremation ground in Varal)asl confirming the connection of this now, dominantly, Purii1;1ic city with the early Bhairava and Sakta cults.

In particular, it devotes lengthy passages to a description of the aforementioned insignias and, especially, to the skull.99 The Kubjikii and other Kaula traditions were close de­scendants of such cults, and many traces of their connection remain. Thus the Kubjikii Tantras prescribe five rather than six insignias and omit the infamous skull. They also admit the wandering life. Thus a Kubjikii Tantra says: \"Adorned with (the sacred insignias),l00 the recitor of mantra, taking (each sacred) field (lcyetra) as a refuge, should wander (from one to the other and within them. These places include), in due order, a cremation ground, (a deserted) forest, (an abandoned) well (or) gar­den, an auspicious temple, an empty palace, the peak of a mountain, a crossroad of fo ur roads, one of three roads, village roads, the sea­shore, the bank of the confluence of rivers or, 0 sinless one, (a desert where there is only) a solitary tree or (where there is just) a single linga or (any) fe arful (ca�{la) (sacred) field.\" 101 Abhinavagupta, who belonged to the 11th century, systemati­cally expounded a possible pattern of total interiorization of such sites and, indeed, all Tantric ritual. The reason why this is possible \"The sacred circle shown to the neophyte in the course of his initiation into the cult of the BrahmaytJmala is to be drawn in a cremation ground with the ashes of a cremated human corpse. In it are worshipped Y�as, Pisacas and other demonic beings, including Rdk�asas led by Ravar;ta, who surround Bhairava to whom wine is offered with oblations of beef and human flesh prepared in a funeral pyre. The name of the circle is the 'Great Cremation Ground' (mahtJSmastJna) and is to be drawn in VllraQasi.\" (See also ibid. : 30). 99 Although I would agree with this characterization of this and similar Tantras as a graphic, generic manner of describing their contents, it is important to note that references in them to any specific Kapalika sect are rare, if they exist. The BrahmaytJmala certainly does not contain any. It would therefore be hazardous to say that this was the Tantra of a Kapalika sect even though it does contain a great deal of interesting material concerning the performance of the Kapalika's vow. 100 The KMT (25/43) explains that the five insignias are the Five Instruments (kara�:�a). These are the five deities who generate, sustain and withdraw the five gross elements, namely, Brahma (Earth), Vi�QU (Water), Siva (Fire), Rudra (Air), and Mahesvara (Etheric Space). 101 KuKh 14/29cd-32ab. 139"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"9l [Journey in !he C[})orld of !he Cfanlras and should be realized is in every case the same, namely, everything is a manifestation of consciou,sness within consciousness, like a re­flection in a mirror.

Even if they are projected onto the body or, deeper, into the vital breath, they remain externai to consciousness. Nonetheless, Abhinava does not deny that pilgrimage may be benefi­cial, in the sen.se that it does yield some fruit, namely, the specific benefits and accomplishments (siddhi), magical and yogic, that e·ach or'these places and its resident deities is supposed to bestow.103 These, however, are worldly benefits (bhoga) rather than the liberated condi­tion.104 Even so Abhinava does riot reject external rituaf. Pilgrimage to sacred sites, like all ritual and yogic practice, are part of a hierarchy of possibilities depending on the spiritual development of the aspirant.105 102 TA 15/100b-1a. 103 Abhinava writes: \"Thus all these places, internal and external, concern (only) those who wish to obtain the fruits of this or that Wheel (calera). Ac­cording to the (Saiva) scripture these places (sthtina) are diverse and w.!thout number.\" (TA 15/101b-2a) 1104 Abhinava writes: \"Mountain tops, riverbanks, solitary lingas and the like mentioned (in the Tantras) are external (places). Here (in this doctrine) they serve (as a means to attain) particular accomplishments, not fo r liberation. Mountain peaks and the like, projected into the vital breath within the body serve as a means fo r (Tantric) practitioners (stidhaka) to gain accomplish­ments (siddh i), not fo r liberation.\" (TA 15/80b-2a) 105 Abhinava quotes the Matangatantra as saying that \"This prescription to ritual action (vidhana) is an easy means (sukhoptiya) which the teacher ex­plains to those who are unable to contemplate (the true liberating) knowledge\" (T A 15/8). Therefore, initiation (dilcyti), Tantric spiritual discipline (caryti) and concentration (sarntidhi) are for those who are unable to attain reality directly by knowledge. Even so, initiation and the rest are based on knowledge and so, according to Abhinava, the man of knowledge (jntinin), rather than the one who performs rituals, or even the yogi, is the most excellent. Similarly, he says that teachers are of increasing orders of excellence according to whether they are proficient in the performance of rituals, Yoga or knowledge (TA 15/18-9). 140"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"'!be 9nner cpi/grlmage of !he Cfanfras Moreover, going to places where spiritual people gather is condu­cive to the practice of Yoga and therefore to the acquisition of spir­itual knowledge.106 Even so, he denies that places have any inherent power in themselves. One may worship successfully wherever the lotus of the heart of consciousness unfolds.107 While the Kubjika Tantras agree that for this, or any, spiritual discipline to be effective, its interior equivalent must be experienced, they do not deny the existence of the power of place (sthiinasakti). According to this theory, the rays ofthe deity's consciousness con­verge in certain places by virtue of these places' inherent power. This convergence and formation in this way of a location where the deity may descend into the world is essential because no worship is possi­ble in the absence of location. Each deity, whether in the outside world or within the body, must have a place of its own. This place, which serves as the sacred seat and field of the deity, is where union (meliipa) with the deity takes place. Consuming a sacrificial meal of meat and wine, the adept receives the grace of the deity of that place which is thus no less sacred than the deity itself. In a more archaic, magical perspective, such places were origi­nally believed to be potent in themselves, and this potency could be channelled and applied. Indeed, the Tantras prescribe the practice of magical rites aimed J. the control of others and the destruction of one's enemies in these same places. Abhinava's warning against at­tachment to the practice of magic 108 recalls to mind the large amount of space dedicated to such matters in the Tantras in general and most particularly in ones such as these. The passages are eloquent testi­mony of the primitive animistic and magical substratum of the reli­gious culture out of which they developed as more elevated refine­ments - literally 'sanskritizations'. One of these refinements is the 106 Ibid. 15/98b-l OOa. 107 Abhinava writes: \"The wealth of the sacrifice (yt:z�asrl) is well established in that place (dhaman), whether internal or external, where the lotus of the heart blooms (vikasa).

The culmination of this process of refinement was not the addition of a totally different, higher ideal, but rather its interiorization. These Tantras did not teach, as did Abhinava, that liberation and the attain­ment of accomplishment (siddhi) are contrasting ideals belonging to different realms. On the contrary, the Kubjika Tantras say that: \"If one perceives the pure inner aspect with the mind, 0 be­loved, then the subtle rays (of the light of the Supreme Principle) within each external thing bestow union (me/aka), the sacrificial pap (caru) or the liberated state (apiiiavividhi). They endow the lineage (with the teachings) and explain the self-established (reality -svastha). 0 god, he who wanders on the earth with an impure inner being does not, for that reason, have a vision (of the deity -darsana) anywhere through me, 0 Rudra.

(Indeed), the rays of consciousness (jniina) arise in every single place. 0 fair-hipped one, they are innumerable within earth or in water, fire, wind, and air.\" 110 Thus the aspirant is admonished to be a pilgrim. But along with his outer pilgrimage he must learn to travel through his own body along the conduits of the vital fo rce to their vital centres. This is his inner journey through the world orders arranged as stations along his ascent to freedom. He must travel through the universe -the Egg of Brahma. Then when he reaches the top he will find DaQ<;lapaQi who with his staff cracks open the Egg for him to ascend up beyond it.111 109 Ku.Kh 14/83cd-87ab. 110 Ibid. 14/89f. 111 Paraphrasing the Svacchandatantra Abhinava writes: \"Above Rudra 's abode is (the abode of) ofDal).c;iaplil).i who, in accord with Siva's will, breaks the egg and fashions the path to liberation.\" (TA 8/159b-60, see also SvT 10/611b-4) 142"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"CJlJe 9nner Cf>l/grimage of !he Cfan!ras The accomplished adept is one who is free to move at will (sveccha­carin) throughout the cosmic order 112 and move beyond it. Thus, the Tantras envisage an end to the initiate's cosmic wayfaring. The uni­verse is not a closed system, reality extends beyond it, for otherwise there could be no freedom from the cosmic order. There is no break between the realms of worldly experience (bhoga) and those of the liberated state. Even beyond the cosmic order, at the very summit of reality (para kii$/hii), movement does not cease. But the perfected initiate (siddha) no longer needs to suffer the strains of a long and tiring journey. No longer held fast by the forces of attraction to the glorious diversity (vicitrata) of the cosmic order, he is free to take flight. No longer wandering in the complex net of M�y� with its countless locations and times, he moves through the Sky of Pure Consciousness. This then is the ideal of the Bhairava Tantras and, especially, the Kaula Tantra, namely, the Accomplishment of Flight (khecaratvasiddhi).113 112 Cf. SM fo l. 137b: \"He wanders as he pleases right up to the end of the world ofBrahma.\" (bhramate ca yathecchaytl abrahmabhuvantlntikam). 113 According to the Kubjika Tantras, the fruits of travelling to the sites of the Eight Mothers with the prescribed inner mindfulness are indeed, as Abhinava says of all such pilgrimages, the acquisition of various magical and yogic powers (siddhi). These are attained over years of practice in a graded order until the final one is attained, which is the Accomplishment of Flight. Even though it comes at the end of a graded series of worldly attainments, this culminating accomplishment is not worldly (bhoga), but liberation itself. Ideally, the KMT tells us that in this particular case, this takes place in twelve years when \"even one who has murdered a brahmin\" achieves success. In the first year he gains political power. The king and his harem come under his control and the king's vassal lords and ministers venerate him. In two years he gains power over the fair damsels of the spirits of vegetation (yalcyakanytl). In three years, the women of the demons of the seven hells are so aroused by the adept that they literally die in their yearning fo r him. In the following. years he attains the higher worlds, starting with that ofBrahrna up to that of Rudra. In the eighth year he reaches that ofisvara, in the ninth that of Sadasiva and in the tenth he becomes a veritable repository of knowledge. By the eleventh year, he can sport in the sky with the mighty beings who reside there, and in the twelfth, endowed with all eight yogic powers, he moves with the Skyfarers in the Sky of Pure Consciousness beyond the sky (KMT 25/53-64ab ). 143"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"5Zl 8oumey in !he CWorld of !he %nlras The Siddhas and Yoginis who reside in the sacred places in the Triangle are all Skyfarers.

As the energy of Speech she vitalizes all the phonemic energies that combine in infinite variety. As each of them is a sacred place, she is not only the Nameless (anama) Letter but also Place (sthana); what the text calls the 4ivine inner Place that is one's own place (svasthana ).114 Abhinavagupta, in accord with his hermeneutic, provides a more sophisticated phenomenological interpretation. The energy that \"wan­. ders in the Void\" is the reflective awareness of the light of conscious­ness that shines as all things. This energy wanders amidst the objects ofthe senses and they thus become objects of perception. By exten­sion; this same power is responsible for the subjective responses to the object, namely, attraction or repulsion. Thus, this energy consists of both the inner and o�ter senses as well as their objects.115 The Skyfarer is one with this energy.

The yogi who is firmly identified with (Siva) in his fu llness and freedom is the author of (these) five functions.

At -this point a question naturally comes to mind, namely, to what extent are the geographies of these texts realistic? Are these real places or mere names that serve as another set of ciphers the Tantras employ to fe ed their seemingly limitless appetite for symbolic representation? A detailed geographical and historiCal study of each of the places plotted on the maps and liste.d in the chart appended to this chapter is in the course of preparation. T�is will certainly yield a good deal of information. But we should not be disappointed if we do not find all that we expect. These forms of Tantrism are not well suited to be public religions. Even when internalized, they remain es<;>teric, pri­vate cults that require neither temples nor public, communal fe stivals. Even so traces do remain in, for example, forms of temple architec­ture, iconography, literary references, occasional inscriptions, and in the sacred geographies of the Purat).as that are still in place. The sacred geography of some traditions, at least, of the Bud­dhist Yoga and Anuttara class of Tantras of the same period coin­cided in many respects with that of the Bhairava and Kaula Tantras (see Map 9). It is not surprising therefore that the Tantras and com­mentaries on both Buddhist and Saiva-cum-Sakta sides of the fence contain admonitions to stay clear of one another if encounters hap­pen to take place in such sites.

The Buddhists, how­ever, considered themselves to be superior to their Saiva counter­parts because they maintained that, unlike the Saivites, they found 'internal symbolic equivalents for the elements of Kaula ritual, in­cluding the sacred geography. The distance both parties feel should be maintained between each other is a measure of their similarity. Indeed, there are numerous details such as these that confirm their common cultural heritage that, at its grass roots, one could call the culture of the vagrant ascetic and the sacred seats. 120 These were power places that were felt to have power in themselves, and so it would not be surprising if many of them existed before these Tantric developments. By the 1Oth century when, I believe, the earliest Kubjika Tantra was redacted, the sacred geography of these places had assumed the form of the regular and recurrent pattern of an ideal scheme. But even so, it was still functional. It was, moreover, purely Tantric, that is to say, sanctioned by and recorded in the Tantras. For the followers of the Bhairava and Kaula Tantras, this appears to be a period of transition from the vagrant life of the solitary ascetic to that of the householder. Thus, the group of fifty sacred sites that, as far as we know at present, appears for the first time in the Kubjiklt Tantras were simply treated as a standard ideal set.

Citralctita, Gaya and Vrndavana are other notable examples. The myth of ori­gin of these places which relates them to the dismembered parts of Sati's body is not found in the early Tantras. This is all the more surprising because they know the story ofDak�a's sacrifice apd how his daughter, Sati /Uma, threw herself into the sacrificial fire and died because Siva, her husband, was not invited to it. The s�bse-121 The passage is found in the 15th chapter of the Jfiamirf.lavatantra, which · postdates the Yo ginlhrdaya. It recurs in the Sii ktanandataranginl (chapter 15) by the 17th-century Bengali Brahmananda, who quotes it from the Gtindharvatantra. See also chapter 5 of the Brhannflatantra. 122 Matsya Purlif.la 13/26-56. Sircar ( 1973: 25) informs us that: \"An early list of this nature can be traced in the Mahiibharata (VI, ch. 23); but a complete list of the 108 names of the mother goddess with the specification of her association with particular holy places is probably to be found for the first time in the Matsya Purlif.la.\" Sircar places the text in the \"early medieval period\", but it may well be quite late. It is certainly not prior to the 12th century. This is because the Puriii).a refers to Vrndavana as a resort ofRadha and to Puru�ottama in Puri. The former was certainly unknown as a divinity before the post-Gupta period. The latter did not attain to eminence prior to Anantavarman Co9agailga (1078-1147 A.D.), who laid the foundation of the great temple of J�gannatha at PurL"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"91 8ourney in the CWorld of the 'Tantras quent evolution of the sacred geography of the Sakta pithas thus mirrors the evolution of Saktism in the Purat:tas as much, indeed more, than in the Tantras. An example of the degree to which this process has progre�sed is how few hl;lve observed that the goddess Mahi$iisuramardini/ Durga is actually a purely Purat:tic goddess. Prior to the 13th century or even later, the goddess Durga, although known to the Tantras, plays do significant role in the Tantras' ritual programmes. She is the pub­lic non-Tantric representative of the secret Tantric goddesses. The Saktism of the Purat:tas, on the other hand, gives this goddess pride of place, assimilating other goddesses, including those of the Tantras, to her. The same process can be observed geographically in the lay­out of the 1 08 �akta pithas. Thus Tantric cults and their sacred geography survive both within the adept and his home as well as in the outer world to the degree in which they can be assimilated or adapted to the public domain with­out losing their essentially secret, internal identity. 148"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"crbe 9nner 'Pilgrimage of the %nlras ·.

The map has been plotted on the basis of the lists of sacred sites found in selected Buddhist Tantras in an article in Hindi called \"Bauddha tantrom mem pl{hopapl{hadi ka vivecana\" published in Dhl/:1, Sarnath, Varanasi, 1986 vol. 1: 137-148. The Tantras and texts consulted were the Va santatilaka, Jii anodaya, Vajravarahlyogarajottamarahasya, Sricakrasamvaraherukabhi­samaya, Laghutantra{lka, Abhisamayamaiijarl, Yo ginfjala, Samvarodaya and Hevajratantra. Details of the sources, all of which are manuscripts, apart from the Samvarodaya and Hevajratantra, can be found in the aforementioned article. The places listed in all these Tantras apart from the Hevajratantra (1/7/12-18) are virtually iden­tical. Thus, effectively, there are only two lists. One is labelled HT in the table and the other BT. 10) The Six Kaula Siddhas: See Appendix 2. ll) 108 Sakta Sites according to the Matsyapurar:za: Sircar 1973: 26-28. * I am very grateful to Prof. Rana P.B.

A short medieval tract, probably of Bengali or Maithili origin, called the Kubjiktitantra has been was published by Chatterjee in Bengali script in the late 19th century. There is, qowever, very little connection, if any, between this Tantra and those of the earlier Kubjika corpus. 2 The main Sanskrit texts I have consulted (or this paper are as follows: the Manthanabhairavatantra, KumariktikhaJJtfa (MBT (KuKh)) and Yo gakhaJJtfa (MBT (YKh)). These are two of the three sections of this Tantra, the whole of which is not less than 24,000 verses (sloka) long.

Moreover, only Rajopadhyaya Brahmins, the former family priests of the Malia kings, can give initiation to those who do not belong to their own family.4 Their K�atnya assistants, called Karmacaryas, a corrupt form of the Sanskrit, Kramacarya, can initiate their own family members. Kubjika is worshipped exclusively by initiates in private shrines reserved for esoteric cult deities who, for Hindus, are all goddesses and their as­sociated entourage. The Buddhists have their own analogous forms of initiations and their deities are those of the so-called Supreme Yoga (anuttarayoga) Tantras. Although the texts describe a number of iconic forms of the god­dess Kubjika, hardly arty have been found. She can and, it seems, is u�ually, if not always, worshipped in her mal)f;/ala; and even that is not essential. Daily worship can be performed by an initiate in his , o.wn home. It can be offered to a triangtilar diagram which he traces -. with his finger on the palm of his hand at the beginning of the rite and then imagines to be in front of him as a representation of the Yoni of the goddess. Myths of Origin The oldest myth concerning the origin of the goddess Kubjika and the transmission of her cult is told in the first three chapters of the Kubjikamatatantra. The scene opens with the coming ofBhairava 3 The original model for the adept of the Kubjika cult is that ofthe renouncer yogi. Even so, the lists of followers of this tradition recorded in the MBT and elsewhere clearly indicate that people of all castes and women were initi­ated. The relative importance of the renunciant with respect to the house­holder also seems to have eroded away. Thus in one part of the MBT (KuKh) the renunciant is exalted above the householder as able to attain the perfec­tions of Yoga (siddhi) (ibid., 11/94-6). Elsewhere we find that the reverse is the case and the householder is declared to be at least the equal, if not supe­rior to the renunciant and the teachings are declared to be specifically for him. Interiorisation of the ritual and prescribed modes ofbehaviour and dress, clearly contribute to the domestication of the Kubjika cult. At present it is virtually entirely a cult for householders.

Bhairava shows her the entire universe as \"burn­ing with the quality (gul)a) of the bliss of the empowering energy (ajna of the Transmission of the Teaching)\". 5 This vision makes of her \"an awakened being\" (prabuddhabhavatma). She is then told that she must become quality-less and so abandon her form as a young virgin (kumaritva). The god then imparted the teachings to her and, ordering her to go to Mount Kumara, he disappeared. She is amazed by what she has seen and in this state of\"supreme wonder\" she ques­tions distraught: \"who are you and what am I doing?\" 6 After much thinking, she abandons her companions and goes to the Mountain of the Moon (Candraparvata) to look for Bhairava. This mountain is said to lie to the west of Meru. 7 It is a beautiful tropical paradise, a 5 'Ajfia' is an important technical term found particularly in the Kubjika Tantras. Literally, the word means 'permission' or 'command' and so, by extension, 'grace' or 'empowerment'. Through the power of'a jfia' the deity dispenses 'adh ilalra'. This word denotes the fitness or suitability of a person or being to perform a certain task or fulfill a function. It can be translated as ..._ 'authority'. A god, for example, may be given the authority-adhilalra-to govern a particular world order by the permission/ command/ grace -ajfia - of the Supreme Deity. The Master transmits it as an empowering energy to his disciple in the course of initiation. -The psychic centre between the eyebrows where the teacher is said to reside is called 'ajfiacakra'. This is because the mental faculties lie here and beyond it is the domain of 'ajfia' which is that of Kubjika as the energy unmana-'Beyond Mind'. This is the energy of the will (icchasakti) that conjoins with the transcendental sphere of Siva (sambhavapada). It seems that the technical use of this term was developed particularly in this Kaula school but is not unknown outside it. In the Kr$1Jayamala, the goddess Tripura is said to be \"under the control of Kr�l}a's command (ajfia)\" (KY 4/8). In a more technical sense, a name of the goddess Lalita in the Lalitasahasranama­stotra of the Brahmil1Jt;/ap urana is 'tijfia'. In the LingapurtilJa Siva says that \"initially my eternal command (ajfia) arose out of my mouth\". See LSNS, translation by Suryanarayana Murti, p. 174. 6 KMT 1/54-5. 7 The Western Tradition -Pascimarnnaya- is that of the goddess Kubjika. The word 'pascima' means both 'west' and 'subsequent'.

It is in fact a ma�Jrf.ala with symbolic doors, fortified walls and arches. The goddess is again astonished when she beholds the Stone. The previous state of wonder with its ensuing confusion was brought about by her cosmic vision that induced her to wonder throughout the world in search of the god. The present state of wonder, in a sense, reverses all that occured in the previous one. She is astonished not by the vision of a universal reality but by that of a marvellous particular. Instead of it inducing her to action and \"waking up\" she mounts the Stone and falls into a yogic trance brought about by the energy of empowerment (ajfia). As a result, the world is enveloped in her energy and merged into her as she assumes the form of a Liliga (lirigarilpa).9 paicimedam krfam deva purvabhagavivarjitam (KMT 2/20cd) paicimam sarvamargtiJ:Ztim (ibid. 2/2lc). They can mean: \"This, 0 god, is (the tradi�ion of the) west I (the tradition which is) subsequent devoid of the (tradition of the) east/ prior (one).\" , And: \"The last I western (portion) of all the paths\". Of the two options it seems that in these references the sense of 'paicima' seems to be that which fo llows after in time. It is the latest Tradition. Bhairava has told the goddess that before (purva) he had given her the teachings, now it is she who has to propagate them. In this sense 'paicima' would mean 'subsequent'. The distinction is temporal rather than spatial. The spatial is, however, more common. The association repeatedly made in the MBT be­tween the Pascimarnnaya and Sadyojata indicates an adaptation of a Siddhiinta moqel. Of Sadasiva 's five faces which teach various doctrines, Sadyojata is the western face. Although both directional and temporal symbolism are fo und in the texts, there is a greater emphasis on the former rather than the latter. In space, the Pascimarnnaya is closely associated with the Mountain of the Moon, a place that the goddess likes in a special way and underscores the goddess's strong lunar associations. It is also the place that she sets off from to spread the teachings in the land ofBharata. Its location to the \"west ofMeru\" (ibid., l/59c) does not seem to be coincidental. In. time the Pascimarnnaya is the latest and, in a sense, the last because it is the Kaula tradition of the Kaliyuga, the fourth and last aeon.

Everything is im­mersed in the darkness of the unmanifest absolute except the place where the goddess in the form of a Liriga resides which, due to its brilliance, he calls the Island of the Moon. The god now abandons his unmanifest form and begins to praise the Liriga. This arouses the goddess from the oblivion of her blissful introverted contemplation and she bursts apart the Linga to emerge from it in all the splendour of her powerful ambivalence. Dark as \"blue collyrium\" she is \"beau­tiful and ugly and of many forms\". Bhairava asks the goddess for the favour of empowerment (ajiia), confessing that her terrible austerity is harmful to him. The goddess is overcome with emotion and shame and becomes bent over (kubjikariipa). The goddess is not embarassed just because she has been asked to be the god's teacher but because this implies that she must unite with him to make the transmission effective. The goddess who is \"round\" as the Liilga becomes \"crooked\" as the triangular Yoni.10 From the previously neutral indifference of transcendence, she must be aroused to become the fertile, erotic Yoni.

Minor conjunctios led to and make up the supreme conjunctio. In her journey around the land of Bharata the goddess assumes various forms in various places where she resides as the presiding goddess of that place. She thus reveals different aspects of herself according to where she becomes manifest. Thus in some of these places the erotic component of her nature becomes apparent. The form of the goddess is, as one would expect, particularly erotic in Kamariipa. There she is \"made haughty by the enjoyment of pas­sion\" (laimabhogakr!atopa). Her aroused erotic nature is symbolized by her fluidity; she melts or flows. She is also arousing, so she causes to melt and flow \"the three worlds\" by the force of her desire (iccha). 11 To be initiated is to be born as the son or daughter of the god\\ goddess and so belong to a family\\ lineage\\ caste along with other initiates. The mother­hood of the goddess in this sense is as particular as it is universal. She travels to the sacred sites and there generates sons and daughters. In this way a household (grha) is fo rmed. In this household the members belong to di­verse clans (gotra) and distinctions in caste (jtiti) are recognised. The stages of life marked by the requisite ritual purifications (saril$klira) as outlined in the smritis is also reproduced. Initiation into this tradition largely follows the model of the Saivasiddhanta in many respects and this is one of them. A necessary preliminary for initiation into Siddhanta Saivism is the regenera­tion of the aspirant as a 'Saiva Brahmin' (saivadvija) who is fit to receive the initiation. The pattern here is largely based on the Vedic initiation in which the sacrificer must, for the purpose of the sacrifice, also be the priest and so must be transformed accordingly. The Kubjika Tantras, as do the Tantras as a whole, prohibit caste distinctions in the ritual setting. At the same time, the distinction is never forgotten outside it. Moreover, initiates into other Tantric systems that are not Kaula are treated as if they belonged to a different caste. They should not eat the sacrificial offerings with initiated Kaulas who are enjoined to make every effort to avoid interdining with them. The ghufhi institution that operates amongst the castes in the Kathmandu Valley seems to be derived from the ii)COrporation of family lineage and caste as aspects of a transmission. The ambiguity of having a caste and hence being a part of the conventional, 'orthodox' social order and being without caste as a prog­eny of the goddess is paralled to that which prevails between the identity of the initiate as being somehow both householder and a homeless renunciant.

This reminds us of the ancient symbolic connection found in the Veda between moisture, water, rain, potent fluids (including sexual juices and milk) and energy. More­over, her intense spiritual potency is symbolized by her powerful sexuality represented by her perpetual moisture as the Yoni full of seed.12 Even she is amazed to perceive the intensity of her erotic state and for a moment loses consciousness, overawed by the powerful beauty of her own form. This is just as happens to the initiate in the rites of initiation due to the impact of the empowering energy of the Transmission. Here she is young and passionate (kamini) and what she reveals gives even the god who merely beholds her here \"the attainment of the fruit of the bliss of passion\". Again, this is just what happens ideally at the climax of initiation when the Master (acarya) gazes at the disciple who falls down \"like a tree cut down from its root\", liberated from the burden of Karma by the sudden rise of the energy of Kut:t<.lalini that pierces through his inner psychic centres. Aroused and arousing in this way, she is accordingly called the 'Mis­tress of Passion' (kameivari) and as such is similar to the goddess Tripurasundari. Kubika's varied identity as a range of goddesses symbolizes the varied facets of her metaphysical being, her 'personality' if one would hazard to perceive one in a purely Tantric deity such as this one with a relatively scant mythology. Accordingly, in one of her iconic forms, she is depicted as having six faces. One of these is that of Tripura.13 Again, in the Sequence of the Young Woman which, along with that of the Girl and the Old Woman, is one of the three 12 The temple to the goddess Kamakhyli at Gauhati in Assam, the site identi­fied by tradition as that ofKamarOpa, enshrines the Yoni of the goddess.

The water that emerges becomes periodically red during which time the goddess is said to be in mensis. 13 The goddess has three basic forms: I) Gross, 2) Cosmic, and 3) Triangular as the Yoni.

There she assumes this form in a cave on Kailash, the axis mundi. Her crooked form when she emerges from the Linga is the Yoni, the manifest form, normally kept hidden, that the god desires to see. As the Linga in the Cave (guhti), she is withdrawn into herself- the Cave of the Yoni which, by another reversal, is the \"Abode ofSarhbhu\". 14 Tipura and her yantra -Sricakra - serve as vehicles for the transmis­sion of energy to other goddesses. This energy is symbolized and evidenced by an intensity of passion. Tripura, a powerfully erotic goddess, serves to intensify the erotic energy of other goddesses. This appears to be the case with the goddess Kubjika and so too, fo r example, with Radha in the Km:w­yamala. The KY declares that when Kr�l)a desires pleasure (bhoga) he con­templates himself in the fo rm of a woman and Radha is created (chapter 12). But although generated by Kr�IJa fo r his own purposes, Radha turns out not to be interested in him even though she is described as 'passionate' (susnigdhti) (chapter 13). From chapter 16 to chapter 28, the Tantra de­scribes �!)a's struggle to attract Radha. In order to do this Kr�l)a trans­fo rms himself into Tripura. The goddess then sends out the energies that surround her in Sricakra one sphere at a time to overcome her pride and fill her with desire. But Radha either makes these energies her own servants or frightens them away with the energies generated from her own body. Fi­nally Tripura herself set about the task and assumed the fo rm of Mantra. She then recited the Mantras and displayed the gestures (mudrti) that are made when worshiping the triangle which is the innermost part of Sricakra. The gestures aroused Radha's passion and made her feel distressed by separa­tion. The final gesture made her completely shameless. Finally, of course, the couple unite. This myth clearly illustrates how passionate sexual desire is a symbol of spiritual desire and how this must grow to an unbearable extreme to lead to final union. The shame Radha feels is the final stage she must abandon just as Kubjika has to do to give herself up totally to the ravishment of the conjunctio. Here Tripura plays the role of the erotic god­dess who imparts her passion to Radha through the ritual she performs. Analo­gously, the incorporation of this goddess into the composite figure ofKubjika serves to enhance her erotic power. 183"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"91 8oumey in !he CWorld of !he Cfanlras In this condition she is inactive. As the male phallus, she is impotent, immersed in formless contemplation. This conjunctio is accordingly called the Neuter (napum.�akam). It can be the 'neuter-male' abso­lute, in which case the term retains its regular neuter gender. It can also be the Female Eunoch: the feminine 'napum$aka'. In one myth of origin, recorded in the KRU, the goddess is generated from the god just as in the earlier myths, she emerges as the Yoni from the Linga. In another myth in the Kularatnoddyota, he is generated from her. In this case the Linga emerges out of the Yoni which is symbol­ized by the stone (sila -a feminine word) that acts as the mat;f/.ala that envelopes its base in the account of the Kubjikamatatantra.15 In this way, these Tantras attempt to portray the goddess simultaneously as a polarity in a conjunctio and as containing within herself the conjunctio as a coincidentia oppositorum. She is simultaneously the two opposites. Reversals of opposites, their conjunction, identifica­tion and transcendence all operate together in the dynamics of the goddess. She relates to her male opposite both externally and inter­nally. This gives rise to three possibilities: 1) The goddess is alongside the god in the centre of the matrix of energy that is the goddess. 15 Sex change is a recurrent mythological theme. This is an example of the sex change of a feminine deity to a male one which, on the contrary to the somewhat easier and more common reverse change, involves not the loss of a sex organ but its acquisition. Another example is found in the Hevajratantra. The Buddha recommends that the adept identify with either of the two partners of the conjunctio, namely, the female Nairatyma or the male Hevajra. But even though either is initially presented as equally good for the solitary state (ekavira/a), the culminating conjunctio invariably takes place with Nainltmya not Hevajra (called Heruka in the passage below) because the initiate must be reconstituted in the womb of his Mother. Consequently a question arises as to how the adept who has identified with Nairatmya can couple to generate himself. The Buddha re­plies by saying: \"The yogi who has identified with the goddess Nairatmya should, abandoning the feminine form, assume the form of the Lord (bhagavat). After relinquishing the breasts, the Vaj ra (i.e. phallus) arises in the middle of the Lotus (i.e. vagina), the sides become the bells (i.e. testicles) and the stamen (i.e. the clitoris) becomes the Vaj ra. The other forms assumed are those ofHeruka, the great being of erotic delight. The man who is one with Heruka attains the mas­culine fo rm without any difficulty and by this the yogi whose powers are fully manifest attains the Gesture of Accomplishment.\" (Hevajratantra, 2/2/23-5) 184"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"CXubjikti, the 9/ndroB!Jnous Qodde ss The matrix of energy can be understood as that of Speech. This universal power through which the cycles of existence are perpetu­ated consists of the primary energy of the phonemes that together constitute the womb of mantras. Laid out in a triangular diagram, called Meru, they are assigned to forty-eight small triangles drawn within the triangle. In one scheme their contents are symbolized as forty-eight siddhas who reside in the Yoni. The last two, the letters 'HA' and 'KSA', represent the god and the goddess in the centre in the vertical dimension. Energizing conjunctios are in this way occuring in a number of ways. Each male siddha is in conjunctio with the female triangle in which he resides. All of them together are con­tained in the one cosmic Yoni in the centre of which is the universal hierogamy that compliments and completes the individual conjunctios. The phonemes thus arranged according to their normal alphabetical order constitute the male Aggregate of Words -Sabdan:isi. One could say that this is a dominantly male Yoni despite the multiple conjunctios that generate energy both universally and through each particular. To set the balance, a second Yoni is required which is dominantly fe male. This is achieved by laying out in the same fash­ion another order of the alphabet which is female. This is called Malin!, 'the Goddess who wears the Garland of Letters'. This second Yoni represents the withdrawal of the energies into the primordial chaos in which male vowels ('seeds') are higgaldy-piggaldy conjoined to female consonants ('yonis'). These two, Sabdarasi and Malin! are, along with ma!Jrjala and mudrii, mantra and vidyii, one of a triad of conjunctios that together constitute the triadic universe. Their con­junction analogously makes the ritual powerful along with its man­tras and yoga. In this case mantra is the Nine-syllabled mantra (naviitmamantra) which is the sound-body of the god Bhairava and the vidya is the One-syllabled Vidya (ekiik$aravidya) which is the sound-body ofKubjika. This is the syllable' AIM'. Its triangular form with an upward slanting line toped by the nasalizing point nicely represents the Yoni with its clitoris (the female phallus) and the seed that arouses it to fertility and power. 2) The god is in the centre of the matrix alone.

This is a very powerful and important option. The Yoni is not only a matrix of Mantric energy, it is also the world of the Transmis­sion of the energy through the Lineages of the Traditions. The Tri­angle in this perspective has at its comers and centre the primary sacred seats (prtha) of the goddess. These are the well know, indeed paradigmatic sites: Pflll).agiri, Jalandhara, Kamarupa and OQQiyana. In these centres reside the teachers of the primordial Divine Trans­mission (divyaugha). This scheme, incidently, in this, unmodified, form is just as we find in the innermost triangle of Srtcakra.16 It can be amplified with the addition of more sacred sites and there are a good number of variations on this basic p.attem.17 16 See my Th e Canon of the Saiwigama and the Kubjika Ta ntras of the We stern Kaula Tr adition, State Univ. of New York Press, Albany, 1988, p. 178 n 110. 17 The Yoni as a triangular figure represents a series of triads with which Kubjika, as Sambhavisakti, Siva's energy in its cosmic form, is consequently identi­fied. It is in this triadic form that the energy is manifestly active (pras.rta). These triads are: l) a) The Transmental (Manonmanc) -Will (Iccha) b) The Pervasive (f}lap ini)-Knowledge (Jnana) c) The Equal One (Samana) -{\\ction (Kriya) 2) The Drop (Bindu), Sound (Nada) and Energy (Kala). 3) The Drop (Bindu) as the Principle of Time (Kalatattva, i.e. Siva), the Principle of Knowledge (Vidy atattva) and the Principle of the Self (Atmatattva). These correspond to: i) the three qualities ofNature (gu�a), ii) Brahmli, Visl)u and Rudra (MBT (YKh) 14/2-4). 4) The Three Sequences. These are three sequences (krama) of ritual action. The ritual reenacts the creation of the world and so this triad, as do the others, generates the world. The triad consists of: i) The Sequence of the Girl (Balakrama), ii) The Sequence of the Young Woman (Yauvanakrama), and iii) The Sequence ofthe Old Woman (Vrcf.dhakrama). 5) Corresponding to the previous triad is that of the three sequences (krama): i) Individual (A�va ), ii) Empowered (Sakta ), and iii) Pertaining to Siva (Sambhava ). 186"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"CXubjika. the 9/ndrogynous Qoddess An important feature of this sacred geography is that it is always understood to have an internal equivalent as places within the inner, subtle body, technically called 'kulapir:zrja' -the body of energy. The goddess is moving through this body sanctifying its parts by filling them with the energy of empowerment (ajiia). Ultimately, this body of fully empowered energy is the body of the goddess. In one respect it has the shape of a human body with a head, arms and legs but in another, deeper aspect, it is the sacred sphere (ma�:ufala) of the goddess which is her Yoni. Although the texts do not say so explic­itly, it seems that the triangular land ofBMrata is just that Portion of the Virgin Goddess. 6) An important triad is that of the three energies: i) Supreme (Para), ii) Middling (Partipara), and iii) Inferior (Apara). This triad is that of the god­dess Mlllini who, as the crooked Kul).c;ialinl, is the Yoni (ibid., 12/20-23ab). The conections between the Kubjikll tradition and the Trika that flourished in Kashmir are numerous. This one is frequently stressed. Just as triads are an important feature of the symbolism of the Yoni, so qua­ternities also feature prominently, the triad for the corners and an extra element for the centre. Further additions have been made to the basic pattern and so the pi!has are in various places said to be 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8. The group of eight is based on the principle of geometric compounding of groups of eight. The God­dess Parll, who is equated with Khaiijini ('She Who walks with a limp'), the alias ofKubjikll ('The Hunchback'), resides in all the eight Sacred Centres. She radiates her empowering energy (ajiia) throughout them through the medium of a teacher who is given the title 'Nlltha' and so reveals the Tradition within it. The Supreme Goddess in the Centre of each pi!ha is portrayed as six-fold ($a!­prakara) because there are six primary forms of the Goddess in each location. In the first pi!ha, Adipltha, these six aspects are: Uc;lc;lllmbll, RaktA, Kllli, Karlllini, Klllasarilka�iiJ.I and Kubjikll.

From this Linga \"churned from above\", as the texts tell us, flows out the creation of the goddess into the spheres of her psycho­cosmic mar.u;lala. Its primary form is the energy of empowerment (tijiia) which is the Drop (bindu) of white, lunar sperm that also flows through the Transmission.18 In this scheme the goddess forms an in­ternal conjunctio with herself. Self-stimulation and the self-regen­eration of bliss is symbolized by the image of the goddess found in the Paratantra as licking her own Yoni to drink its vitalizing juices.

Also worth noting is that the Yak$inl in one ofthese pitha's is called Khaiijinl. The cathonic connection and that with the vegetal world and the Goddess is here quite evident. Her power, as usual, is understood as flowing through the transmission of her teachings. These conduits of power are here represented as living. They are trees, creepers, roots and vines which, with the other elements, form a part of the sacred geography of the Yoni and its inhabitants (MBT (YKh) 14/13ft). 18 Doniger quotes the following passage to show how the more common concept of the male androgynous Liil.ga appears in contemporary South In­dia in a modified form: \"The civalinkam or the phallus is a male form, but the substance within it, which is liquid (semen) or light (the deity), which is its action, is cakti, fe­male ... the sign of maleness is really the locus of female qualities in a man, the male womb [that yields a] milky, generative substance\" (Egnor 1978, p. 69 in Sexual Metaphors and Animal Symbols in Indian Mythology by Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty, Motilal Banarsidass, Delhi, 1981, p. 318).

To reinforce this process theory of reality and its immediate ritual and soteriological application, the entire system itself emerges from a pre-cosmic absolute and reverts back to it. This absolute is both a neuter transcendent (beyond the opposites) and the sexuated neutrality of the conjunction of opposites which is the dy­namic condition of their interrelation that characterizes immanence. The 'Neuter' (napum$akam) is an androgynous absolute generated by the hierogamy of Siva and Sakti. It is the One understood as the supreme conjunctio from which all the phenomenal order is gen er­ated. This takes places in stages, the first of which is desire, just as it was the last to be absorbed into it. The passionate desire of the pri­mordial couple, male and female, engulfs and consummes into itself all other things. When only that remains beside the Two, it is finally absorbed into the ecstasy (ananda) of their conjunctio. The fullness of their passion manifests, asAbhinava puts it, in the fullness of their union. 19 But although union brings perfect satisfaction it does not extinguish desire. It is not the end but a new beginning. Pure tran­scendence can only be a metaphorical possibility in any scheme of reality. It necessarily lies outside it. It is total extinction, the end of all endings. The transcendent IS because it is not, never has been, nor ever will be, touched by becoming. The conjunctio IS a conjunctio because it is taking place NOW. It is perpetually renewed. It IS be­cause it OCCURS, not just because it exists. And so Desire arises ever and anew. It is the energy of the conjunctio, Kaulini who is the Mother of Insight (darsana), the Supreme Goddess, the Female Eunoch (napum$aka) whose form is the 'sprout' of the clitoris.20 \"In the context of Indian ideas about self-contained fluids, the linga in the yoni may be regarded as a male image in another way; it may symbolize the fa ntasy of protecting the phallus by taking it inside the body- the male's body - a narcissistic fa ntasy of self-sufficiency (Kakar 1978, pp 159-9). This would be an inversion of the myth in which the full body of the god Siva emerges from inside the liilga.\" (Ibid. p. 318) The Linga in this case is clearly within the goddess. 19 TA 3/170. 2o MBT (YKh), 4/179. 189"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"5Zl 8ourney in !he CZJJorld of !he Cfanfras It is certainly true, as Do niger points out, that \"male androgynes by far outnumber female androgynes and are generally regarded as positive, while the female androgynes ... are generally negative\".21 Moreover, \"the female androgyne is not only barren but dangerous: she is a woman with a phallus, the erotic mare in the 'wrong' spe­cies, who threatens the seducing man with opposition\"Y Even so, this does not entirely apply to Kubjika who is a rare example of an Indian androgynous goddess. Although she is q_ot represented as such in her iconography, her more 'essential' identity as ambivalent Yoni shares masculine haits along with its obviously feminine ones. Even though she is a feminine androgynous being, she is predominantly positive and, in this case, is not infertile. She does however have a dark, consumming side which is represented by Kali with whom she is regularly identifiedY Her association with the lower spheres of existence is connected to her igneous identity. She is the devouring consumming mother as the Fire of the Aeons (samvarta) that burns in the centre of her sacred Circle-samvartamm:uja/a, the 'Divine Linga'. There, in the Centre, she is Rudra's �nergy which is \"beauti­fully terrifying\" (subhi$Wli). It is this aspect which identifies her most closely with Kali. But even though she, like Kali, consumrnes the worlds into the Void of her Yoni, the Triangle of the energies of will, knowledge and action, Kubjika is largely a benign androgyne despite her femininity. This is because the tension between tlie opposites is released within her through the blissful flux of emission. Her mad passion to con­sume everything into herself-the cosmic womb -has been satis­fied. She is blissful with the Linga pouring out its energizing seed within her. Filling her, that is, with that same energy of bliss that is her own dynamic nature.

Transposing in• abstracted terms the natural symbols exploited so extensively in the earlier Vedic tradition, the Sun as a universal Tantric symbol applied in this specific context combines within itself all the positive forces that make for fertility and power. The Moon drips its nectar as the secretion of the Yoni that \"oozes bliss\" and the Fire bums to accept that offering to strengthen the deities and the body of the Perfected Yogi (siddha) that contains them.

The text stresses that this 'arising' and 'falling away' takes place from and into the Drop in the centre of the Yoni (ibid. 13/128cd). They are connected by the currents of the two breaths, ascending and descending. In the centre of both Yonis resides the goddess, just as she resides in the centre of every matrix of energy in the micro-/macro-cosm.

The cult of this ob­scure goddess 1 will be compared with that of the much better known goddess Kali, and references will occasionally be made to the god­dess Tripura. The latter, like Kubjika, figures prominently right from' the start of her history in the Sakta Kaula Tantras;2 the former emerges initially in the Bhairava Tantras 3 and as a member of the Kaula pan­theon. For those interested in Nepalese studies, an important com­mon feature of these three goddesses and their ectypes is the central position they have held for several centuries in the esoteric Tantrism 1 See Dyczkowski 1987a: 95ff. for a summary of the work published up to that time on this goddess. Since then more work has been published. See the bibliography. 2 I refer here to the Kaula Tantras as Sakta, not in a technical, but a descrip­tive sense. Sakta as a technical term denoting those cults, scriptures, or peo­ple associated with the worship of the goddess as Sakti (meaning literally 'power') is absent from the terminology of the Tantras prior to the eleventh century. Instead we find the term Kula and its cognate Kaula. According to Abhinavagupta (PTv pp. 32f; see Pandey 1963: 594f.), the term Kula is derived from the root kul which means 'coming together as a group'. Thus, in a non-technical sense, the word kula means 'family'. A wide range of symbolic meanings that refer to metaphysical and yogic concepts are found in this term by Tantric exegetes. Amongst the Newars the non­technical sense is never forgotten. Kula is not just the divine family, that is, the aggregate of the god's energies gathered together in the figure of his Tantric consort. It is also the human fa mily of the goddess's disciples who, amongst the Newars, are also literally related. 3 Concerning the Bhairava Tantras, see Dyczkowski 1987a: 42ff., also below. 193"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"9l f}oumey in the CUJorld of the Cfanlras of high-caste Hindu Newars as their lineage (kula) deitie'>. Thus the aim of this essay is twofold. One is to present a general ..>verview of some salient features of the typology of these forms of the sacred. The other is to present a brief introduction to Newar Saktism as the context in which the goddess Kubjika has been worshipped for most of her history. One of the most basic features of the complex and multi-layered religion of the Newars is the thoroughness with which it has been permeated with Tantrism. This is true of both Ne¥ ar Buddhism and Hinduism. In what follows I will deal exclusive] f with the latter. In Nepal, as elsewhere, Hinduism displays a remarbble capacity to pre­serve and maintain older forms of religion alongside the newer, giv­ing each its place in the economy of the expanded whole. Thus, for example, the present Gorkhali kings, like the Malia kings before them, are still considered to be incarnations of Vi�QU, and Siva Pasupati remains, as he has been for centuries, the patron god ofNepal. These gods along with the ubiquitous Bhairava, Siva's wrathful form, and the goddess Durga, otherwise known as Bhagavati, and the eight Mother goddesses (matrka) who are arranged in protective circles around the Kathmandu Valley and its major cities, the many GaQesas who protect the quarters of Newar towns, villages and countryside are the basic constituents of the Newars' public religion. They are the gods of the 'outside' public domain, what Levy has aptly called the 'civic space' or 'mesocosm'. Easily accessible to researchers, they have been the object of a great deal of study. But there is another 'inner' secret domain that is the Newars' 'microcosm'. This does not form a part of the sacred geography of the Newar civitas, although, from the initiates' point of view, it is the source and reason of much of it. The deities that populate this 'inner space' and their rites are closely guarded secrets and, often, they are the secret identity of the public deities, known only to initiates. The two domains complement each other. The outer is domi­nantly male. It is the domain of the attendants and protectors ofboth the civic space and the inner expanse, which is dominantly female. By this I mean that while the deities in the public domain may be both male and female, the male dominates the female, while the se­cret lineage deities of the higher castes are invariably female accom-194"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"crbe Cull of !he Qoddess CXubjika panied by male consorts. The interplay of these two polarities gener­ates the complex structures ofNewar religion. Again, this, the inner domain is layered and graded in hierarchies of deepening and more elevated esoterism that ranges from the individual to his family group, clan, caste, and out through the complex interrelationships that make up Newar society. Thus the interplay between the inner and outer domains is maintained both by the secrecy in which it is grounded and one of the most characteristic features of Newar Tantrism as a whole, namely, its close relationship to the Newar caste system.4 It is commonly accepted by Tantrics everywhere that the teach­ings of the Tantras should be kept secret, although in actual practice the degree to which secrecy is maintained varies and the Newars are amongst the most orthodox in this respect. But this other feature of Newar Tantrism is in striking contrast to the precepts of the Tantras, especially the Kaula Tantras that tirelessly admonish equality. 5 The 4 Quigley confirms that one of the aspects ofNewar society on which every­one is more or less agreed is that \"caste divisions are underscored, as are all aspects ofNewar social life, by pervasive ritual. While certain rituals bring togther all the inhabitants of a particular settlement, many others are prima­rily oriented to an individual or a particular kinship group - a household, for example, or a group of affines, or perhaps a lineage.\" (Gellner and Quigley 1995: 300). Especially important amongst the 'many others' fo r the higher castes are Tantric rituals. s It is worth stressing that although the Tantras enjoin that when initiates sit together to perform their Tantric rites there should be no caste distinctions, they become operant once more when the ritual ends. The two domains, the 'inner' Tantric and the 'outer' Smtirta, are treated independently. Thus, for example, once the aspirant has received initiation in the Tantric cult of Svacchandabhairava, which is an important part of Newar esoterism, as it was of Kashmiri, the Svacchandabhairavatantra prescribes expiation for anyone who even mentions prior caste: priigjiityudira!Jiid devi prayascittl bhaven nara/:11 (SvT 4/544b; cf. ibid. 4/414. Abhinavagupta enjoins the same fo r Trika Saivites in T A 15/576). Further on, however, the Tantra enjoins that 'one should not criticize the Smiirta religion which teaches the path of right conduct'. smartaril dharmaril na nindet tu iiciirap athadarsakam (ibid. 5/45; see Arraj 1988: 29 -30 fn . 2.

Accordingly, the Tantras devote long sections to listing the qualities required of the disciple and those of the teacher.

Indeed, those of low csste are believed to have a special power by virtue of their low sta­tus-thus reversing the common view that those of high caste, espe­cially Brahmins, possess it. The Newars are well aware of this princi­ple, which is well exemplified by the many well-known stories of the life and exploits of the Brahmin Gayapati, better known as Gayal).bajya, who was instructed in the use of mantras by an outcaste (pocj.e ). 6 In this aspect, as in many others, Tantric ritual is analogous to its Ve dic predecessor. Thus Heesterman points out that after the conclusion of the Vedic sacrifice \"about to leave the ritual enclosure, the sacrificer, whether king or commoner, returns to his normal, unchanged self in society: 'Here I am just as I am', as he has to declare in his concluding mantra (SB 1/1/1/6; 1/9/3/ 23). Nothing has changed.\" 6 Gayabbiijya was almost certainly a historical figure. He was a Brahmin who lived in Sulirnha, in the western part of the core area of Patan, in the sixteenth century. There are many stories of the miracles he performed by the powers he acquired with the help of an outCaste (por,ie). I am grateful to Nutan Sarma for giving me a copy of an unpublished paper called 'The Story ofGayal)bajya' in which he collects some of these stories aJ,Id data establish­ing the historicity of Gayal)bajya. The fo llowing is a brief summary of one of the most fa mous of them (seeN. Sharma 1991: Iff. arid 1993: 46ff.). The pious Gayal)bajya used to go daily for his morning ablutions to Mrtyuiijaya Ghat ('Riverbank of the Conqueror of Death') at the confluence of the rivers Vagmati and Manohara. One day, on his way to the river, it began to rain very heavily. He took shelter under the roofing overhanging the nearest house, which happened to belong to an untouchable who was fa mous in Patan as a powerful Tantric. Inside the house a child was crying. The mother who had tried in every way to calm it, and became exasperated, laid hold of a knife and stabbed it to death. Soon afterwards, the father came home and seeing what had happened consoled his wife and, taking the child into another room, brought it back to life. Astonished by what he had seen, Gayal)bajya took to standing outside the untouchable's house fo r a while every day when he passed to take his bath.

In actual fact, Newars cannot choose their Tantric guru. Nor are they all allowed to have one. The rule is so rigidly applied that the nineteenth-century chronicle, the Bhti$tivarhstivali, meticulously lii.ts the names of the castes whose members can 'receive mantra' and those who can give it.7 Significantly, these prescriptions are attributed to Sthitimalla, the fourteenth-century king who was famous for having established the caste structure ofNewar society. In actual fact, his contribution was more probably a reform and extension of a pre-existing caste system, which we know from references in much earlier inscriptions, pre­dated him.8 But while some credence may be given to Sthitimalla's legislation of the caste system, we are not yet in a position to say to to be admitted. Then one day the outcaste asked him why he came daily to stand outside his house. Gayabbajya took the opportunity to ask the outcaste to reveal his Tantric secrets. The outcaste agreed and told him to come after four days with a bunch ofwood apple leaves (belpatra), which Gayal)bajya did. Then they went together to the riverbank where the Brahmin bathed daily. The outcaste then told him to bathe. When Gayabbajya had finished, the outcaste, squatting on a platform where ancestral offerings (srtiddha) are made, wrote m,antras on the wood apple leaves and threw them into the river, telling Gayal)bajya to eat them. When he had done so, he was astonished to discover that he knew all the mantras. However, he had not acquired their power (siddhi). Instructed by the outcaste, Gayal)bajya began to worship Bhul).<;le Gal).esa in order to empower the mantras he had received. After some days, Gal).esa appeared to him and told him to go to the shrine of Balkumari on the night of the fourteenth day of the dark fo rtnight (piicahre) in March when the l)akini wltches gather to prepare magic collyrium (mohani). This collyrium, Gal).eSa told him, would give him the powers he sought. Eventu­ally, Gayabbajya managed to acquire the collyrium and, smearing it on his fo rehead he attained the power (siddhi) he sought and became a great Tantric. 7 See Bhti$tivarnsavali pp. 156ff. r 8 Slusser writes: \"The Indian caste system was in effect in the Nepal Valley from at least the beginning of the Licchavi Period [i.e. the fourth century], as inscriptions attest.

Even so, we can say with confidence that the system, care­fully graded and regulated by caste considerations, was well in place when the Bhii�iivarnsiivali was written and in all probability for a number of centuries prior to that. One of the reasons for this phenomenon is certainly the power­ful influence Brahmins have had on the formation of the Newar, es­sentially Hindu, state through their influential patrons (yajamiina), especially the Newar kings and their officials. It is hard to resist this view when we observe that the system is constructed in such a way that when it is functioning in ideal circumstances, at least from the Newar Brahmin's point of view, the Newar Brahmins are the sole dispensers of the vital initiation that allows access to it. The situa­tion, then, is analogous to the monopoly Brahmins have striven to achieve throughout their history everywhere in South Asia, and wher­ever there are Hindus, as family priests (purohita) for the higher 'twice-born' castes. In this capacity they perform the smiirta rites of passage (samskiira) that mark a Hindu's progress through life from conception to death. In the case of the higher Newar castes who are entitled to receive it, the family Brahmin purohita or another Newar Brahmin, whose traditional office it is to do so, may give Tantric initiation to those members of the family who have passed through all the rites of passage preceding marriage and desire it. Thus a Newar Brahmin may be bothpurohita and Tantric guru.9 Even so, the two priestly functions are always clearly distin­guished. This is evidenced by the fact that they may be performed by two different Brahmins. But even in those cases, each extended Newar family lineage (phuki)10 of all but the lowest castes is traditionally 9 For a general account of these two aspects of the Newar Brahmin's func­tion, see Toffin 1989. 10 Ishii provides a basic definition of the terrnphuki.

The initiation given to members of the higher castes, that is, the ones eligible to receive the sacred thread, is into the worship of one of the goddesses belonging to six Kula lineages (ammiya) amongst which Kubjika, forms of Kali and Tripura are the most important. She is the 'chosen deity' (i�tadevata)l1 and lineage goddess (kuladevata, amnayadevata) of the aspirant's extended family lineage (phuki). While certain Brahmins can give initiation to people who do not belong to their lineages, there is a second group of people who are empowered to dispense Tantric initiation only to their own family mem� hers. These are the Brahmin's assistants the Josis (astrologers) and Acajus (both Kshatriya castes). The latter are also called Karmacaryas, which is an appellation derived from the Sanskrit name for a Kaula teacher, namely, Kramacarya. D. R. Regmi (1965�1966, vol. 2, p. 715, quoted in Levy 1991: 356) defines their function as follows: \"These Acajus functioned as inferior priests in all Brahman led households. They accepted dalcyir:za (gifts in money) as well as food in their host's house .... But they could not chant the Vedic mantras and also could not conduct the [Vedic] rituals. These were done by Brahmans alone. The Acajus and Josis, however, were indispensable for any [complex] ritual. 11 In India the 'chosen deity' a person may have is literally that, a particular god or goddess to whom that individual feels especially attracted. Coinci� dentally, this deity may well be one that has been worshipped in his or her family. Indian kings regularly have such family deities. The Newar kings had several chosen deities. The Licchavis (fourth to ninth century) had Pasupati and Vi�I:�U and a goddess called Manesvari. The worship ofMiinesvari was maintained by the Malia kings. Ral)ajitmalla (ruled 1722-1769 A.D.), fo r example, refers to her in his inscription on the side of the gate to his Bhakta pur palace as his 'chosen deity'. (In this inscription the king refers to himself as srimatpasupaticaraf.lakamaladhulidhusaritasiroruhasriman­maneivari:;tadevattivaralabdha-. See A.D. Sharma 1954 for a detailed no­tice of this inscription.) From the time ofSthitimalla the Mallas also adopted the goddess Taleju. She was their lineage goddess. However, this did not prevent them from having other 'outer' chosen deities. Siddhinarasirilhamalla (1597-1619 A.D.) of Patan, fo r example, chose Kr�I:�a for himself. His son, Srinivasamalla, chose Matysendraniitha who was, and still is, the 'chosen deity' of the city of Patan. Again, to close the circle as it were, the chosen deity of Matsyendranatha is Siddhilak�mi, the goddess Taleju (see below). 199"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"5Zl 8oumey in !he CZJJorld of !he Cfanlras The Josi was concerned with the task of finding out an auspicious time for any kind of rite performed. The Acaju helped to arrange methodi­cally the requirements of the ritual performance. He prepared the ground­work for the actual rite. It was left for the Brahman priest to use them.\" The Josi's functions may be much more complex than those de­scribed here. Indeed, nowadays the Josis who belong to families tra­ditionally linked to the worship of Taleju, the Malia kings' lineage deity, have many rituals to perform in the Taleju temples of Kathmandu and Bhaktapur. In Kathmandu, the Taleju Brahmin who worships in the Malia kings' private chapel (agafi) is assisted by a Josi, not a Karmacarya, although Karmacaryas do assist in the more lengthy occasional rites.12 In Bhaktapur, where both Josis and Karmacaryas have ritual functions in the Taleju temple (agafi) of the Malia royal palace, the Josis have more to do than the Karmacaryas. This is cer­tainly not the way it was in the past. This is clear from the fact that Karmacaryas in general have much more extensive priestly functions than do Josis. Thus in Bhaktapur, for example, where Karmacaryas have, as elsewhere, numerous patrons (yajamtina) for whom they perform Tantric rituals, the Josis do not have any. This is the case even though Josis are generally considered to have a higher caste status than Karmacaryas. The latter are of varying status in different places. In Bhaktapur, where the status of such auxil­iary priests in general is considered to be lower than in the other cities, there are also Acajus belonging to the farmer (jyapu) castes. Their function, which they share with other Karmacaryas, is to worship the mother goddesses (matrkti) who encircle and protect the ci ty. 12 The degree in which this relationship has been politicized is well illustrated by the reversal of roles that takes place in the Taleju temple (not to be con­fused with the agaii) of the Kathmandu Malia royal palace. There, the main daily officiant is a Karmliclirya who is, apparently, assisted by a Newar Brah­min. The latter cooks the mixture of rice and pulse that is the deity's daily food offering (bhoga) because, in order to avoid pollution, a Brahmin must do this. Thus, although Karmacaryas have managed to take over almost all of the ritual functions in this temple and so pocket the money offering and take home most of the remains of the many food offerings financed by the Nepa­lese government, they could not eliminate the Brahmin, who was originally their boss, altogether. But in this case, paradoxically, as he is the most senior because of his ritual purity, he has been reduced to the status of a cook. 200"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"crbe Cull of !he 9oddess CXuhjika Thus we find that there is a hier archy of ritual agents of varying A status graded amongst the Newars according to their caste and ritual \\ functions. A cardinal feature of the situation as it is at present is the fact that Karmacaryas do not receive initiation from Brahmins. The latter do, however, continue to act as their purohitas and perform their Smarta life cycle rituals for them. There are reasons to believe, however, that they did originally take initiation from them. Karmacaryas assert, especially the ones of higher status, that they can compile liturgies when required, and probably have done so. But although there are many amongst them who assert that because they can do this they are not dependant on Brahmins, it is they, nonethe­less, who go to consult Brahmins when in doubt concerning ritual procedure, not the other way around. Moreover, their roles are al­ways those of assistants, and they cannot give initiation to people outside their lineage. This is the case with Josis also. The Bhaktapur Josis believe that they were originally Brahmins and that this is the reason why they can initiate their own lineage members. Even so, in both cases Brahmins perform ritual functions for them that they can­not do alone. The most revealing of these from this point of view is the necessary presence of Brahmins at certain crucial junctures in the thirteen days required for the death rites (antye$!i). Although I have not as yet examined the liturgies in question, I have been reliably informed by a Rajopadhyaya ofBhaktapur that on one of these occa­sions, if the deceased Karmacarya was an initiate, a rite is performed aimed at returning the mantra to the deity and the guru from whom it was received. Even though the deceased Karmacarya received initia­tion from a senior family member, on this crucial occasion it is a Brahmin who acts as the guru, thus revealing the identity of the origi­nal point of entry of the Ka�acarya 's lineage to its ritual status. Smarta Hinduism, at least that part of it concerned with the rites of passage, distinguishes, in some respects, very clearly between the priest, who can perform rituals, and the layman who cannot perform them himself and so must employ a priest for this purpose. But even in that case a great deal of ritual activity in a smarta rite is under­taken by the priest's patron (yajamana), although he does so as di­rected by the priest, not independently.

By thus bestowing on his pa­tron (yajamtina) the right to share in his priestly functions, the Brah­min attempted to free himself of the danger of taking his patron's impurites onto himself. Summarizing Heesterman's view on the clas­sical Vedic sacrifice, Quigley (1993: 59) explains: \"In the classical ritual, the patron (yajarhtina) has· already been purified. Acutely aware of the dangers inherent in accepting a pa­tron's gifts and thereby his impurity, the 'brahmin' has made his sac­rificial services 'superfluous' (Heesterman 1985�39). Or, put another way, the patron has become his own priest with the result that death and impurity no longer circulate between the parties.\" But while Newar Brahmins are aware that ritual action may de­file their classical Brahminical identity, their ranking of status 13 is only partially based on considerations of relative purity. This is be­cause, in the context of Tantric ritual, these considerations are tem­porarily suspended, to be replaced by the ordinances of a different ritual universe.14 The corollary to this is that, in the context ofTantric ' 13 Quigley pertinently points out that there is a gulf between the theory that Brahmins stand supreme in the caste hierarchy and practice where their sta­tus is, for various reasons, subordinated to that of their patrons. Quigley refers to this theory as a \"colonial interpretation of caste\" (Quigley 1993: 84) with which modern scholars often concur. But \"why\", he asks, \"should they claim that the Brahmal) stands supreme when, time after time, his status is shown to be intensely ambivalent, at worst vilely degrading?\" (ibid.) Quigley writes that the main reason for the \"near unanimous defence of the Brahmal) 's supremacy lies in the fact that authorities on Hinduism have, more often than not, illegitimately fused two very different concepts-}titi and varl'}a-or caste (Brahma.Q) and [priestly] function (brahmaiJ). Here they have indeed made the same mistake as colonial administrators.\" We should not forget, however, that the fo remost ofthese authorities are the Brahmins themselves! Moreover, it is not only scholars and colonials who have been misled by these authorities but virtually all Hindus, even though many will agree that Brahmins can be, and very often are, degraded by impurity. The contrast between Brahminical theory and actual practice is the basis of the energizing tension and dynamism that characterises every Hindu society. 14 This procedure is well exemplified by the formulations of Srividya initiates in Bhaskararaya's tradition in Benares. Brahmins may drink the ritual offerings of wine without defilement because, according to them, as caste considerations are suspended for the duration of the rite, they are not, at thai time, Brahmins. 202"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"CJbe Cull of the [}oddess CXubj ika ritual, the contact with sources of defilement (including his patron's impurities) no longer serves to depress in the same degree the status of a Brahmin or anyone who functions as a priest. Thus, even more so than in the non-Tantric context, the empowerment transmitted to the initiate from the deity through the guru and the rite of initiation enables him to begin his life as an independent ritual agent. He is, as far as the Tantric ritual to which he has gained access is concerned, his own priest and can act as a priest, for the members of his lineage at least. Thus Tantrism further blurs the distinction between priest and layman. The Tantric initiate is not like the baptised Catholic Chris­tian layman, a passive and, at best, receptive, spectator of ritual ac­tion in which his function is hardly more than consent. Like priests of most religions, great and small, throughout the world he \"has a special and someti!Des secret knowledge of the techniques of wor­ship including incantations, prayers, sacrificial acts, songs and other acts that are believed to bridge the separation between the divine or sacred and the profane realm.\" 15 • · Tantrism in this respect reflects the diffusion of priestly func-· tions throughout local communities in South Asia, including the Newar, where we see potters, barbers, washermen and others acting in priestly capacities on particular occasions, while in some cases, as happens with the Newars (see below), members or branches of fami­lies function as sacrificial priests for their cognate and affinal rela­tives (see Heesterman 1985: 152). Even so, Newar Kaula initiates cannot perform rituals for others outside their lineage unless they are Brahmins or (generally Kshatriya) Karmacaryas. The only other limi­tation on the common initiate's ritual activity is purely practical. He may not have the time or the knowledge to do more than perform the relatively short and simple daily obligatory rite (nityapuja). For other rituals he may therefore call the Karmacarya or Brahmin who is tra­ditionally related to his lineage. In case there are no initiates left in the lineage or they are old, disabled or have moved to distant places (and these contingencies have nowadays become common) even the daily obligatory rite may be performed by a Karmacarya. 15 James 1974: 1,007 quoted by Levy 1992: 346.

At the top stands the Taleju Ra jopadhyaya, who still acts as the Malia king's purohita and guru even though the Gorkhali Shahs have been ruling since 1769. He officiates at the innermost esoteric centre of the network of Hindu Newar esoterism - the Malia king's Tantric shrine where Taleju, his lineage goddess, is worshipped, as the litur­gies say, for the benefit of the king, his country and his people. Ideally-and in the past this was probably the case-the Taleju /Brahmin is accepted by everybody as the sole head and foundation of the entire system. He is the ultimate guru of all the gurus. In a sense, he is not only the ultimate but the sole ritual agent. All initi-ates are his assistants. They act in his place through the extension of his empowering authority, transmitted to them through the initiation he administers. From this uncompromisingly autocratic point of view, all those who serve clients (yajamtina) with their priestly functions have been appointed to this task by the Rajopadhyaya. Their clients are really the clients of the Rajopadhyaya who has delegated this job to them. The Taleju Rajopadhyaya insists that he can do 'everything' and 'go everywhere'. Theoretically he has access to every secret place and can perform any ritual. In actual fact, however, at present at least, he cannot. There are numerous public temples - for example, the temple of Guhyesvari near Pasupati - where the sole officiants are Karmacaryas. Moreover, even if there are many Rajopadhyaya Brah­mins who have their own traditional clients, even the seniormost Rajopadhyaya cannot enter a family's Tantric shrine (tigafi) if he is not specifically authorized to do so. Even so, the Rajopadhyaya insists that the Karmacaryas' priestly functions are merely supplementary extensions of his own. He as­serts that his ancestors created the range of Karmacaryas and the Josls to act as his assistants. This is because although he can perform every ritual action, including animal sacrifice and the consumption ofliquor (ali, sudha), he may choose not to do these things.16 More-16 That this is the case is clearly proved by the fact that there are rituals that only Rajopadhyayas can perform.alone, the prime examples being those that require animal sacrifice that they must, therefore, do themselves even though they in­variably prefer to have the actual killing done by an assistant whenever possible. 204"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"CJ'be Cull of !he 9oddess CJ(ubjika over, there are rituals or parts of rituals that only he can perform; and so he must attend to them.

Of course, matters do not seem to be this way to others. As a result of what the Rajopadhyaya may call a mass rebellion, most of these other priests consider themselves to be autonomous agents. It is possible to meet a Karmacarya who bows his head respectfully as he says in a hushed voice that he is nothing but the servant of the Rajopadhyaya, but most are far from this fealty.17 In Bhaktapur, the Karmacaryas who serve the upper castes (thar) affirm that they lived in Bhaktapur prior to the arrival of the Rajopadhyayas, which took 17 I am thinking in particular of an interview with a Karmiiciirya who, after performing the functions ofthe Karmacarya in the Taleju temple in Patan for many years, resigned. When asked ifthis was because of some quarrel with the Rajop!idhyaya priests, he was surprised. \"Why should we quarrel,\" he said, \"they are our gurus and we are their assistants!\" The reason he left was quite another. The government trust that finances the Taleju and other tem­ples in the Valley gave him only one Nepalese rupee a day as remuneration. At present this is barely the price of a cup of tea. The tone and mood of this Karmacarya was in sharp contrast with that of the main Vidyapitha Karmiicarya who performs the equivalent rituals in the Bhaktapur Taleju temple. He is a senior science lecturer in Tribhuvan University and has sev­eral well-to-do patrons. Moreover, the situation in the Bhaktapur temple, although not good, is considerably better than in Patan, and so those who act as priests there are better rewarded. The Bhaktapur Karmacarya, who is in a much better financial position and, as a university lecturer, enjoys a better social status, combined with a self-assertive character, represents the kind of Karmacarya who is convinced of his own importance and resents the inferior status to which he is relegated by Rajopadhyayas. He does not talk about his caste status. He prefers to talk about his competence as a ritual agent. He goes so far as to boast that he can perform the smarta life cycle rituals him­self - which he is certainly not authorized to do.

These disputes are clearly extensions of those that take place wherever society is ordered into castes, a social order that has been aptly characterised as a \"contested hierarchy\". In this case, the gra­dation of ritual empowerment is the defining characteristic of status. 18 The Bhaktapur Karmacaryas accept the historicity of the story of Ullasa and Allasa Raj. These were two Brahmin brothers who came to the Valley from Kanauj. Alliisa Raj went to the hills where, it is said, his descendants became the hill (parvatiya) Brahmins. Ullasa Raj came to Bhaktapur and his descendants are said to be the present Rajopadhyaya Brahmins ofBhaktapur (Levy 1992: 346ff.).

There are several other legends (for which see Toffin 1995: 188). Genealogies have been recovered that begin with Ullasa Raj (see Witzel 1976). Toffin writes: \"According to this document, this Kanaujiya priest arrived in the Nepal Va lley in the middle of the sixteenth century and died in 1576. He is suppos­edly the earliest 'Nepalese' ancestor of the family. However, these dates have to be treated with caution because other interpretations of the genealogies are possible: the original ancestor could have migrated to Nepal in the four­teenth century, at roughly the same time as Taleju was brought to Bhaktapur, or at the end of the fifteenth century during the reign of Raya Malia ( 1482-1505 AD).\" (Toffin 1995: 188) The legends vary also for different cities, since 'Rajopadhyaya' was not originally a proper name but a title meaning the 'king's teacher', and it ap­pears that several Brahmin families came at different times and settled in various places in the Valley. Toffin remarks: \"Nor does it seem that the present day Rajopadhyayas are all descended from a single ancestor as legend claims. Rather it appears that the first arriv­als, no more than several families, continued to receive reinforcements until quite a late date (at least until the sixteenth or seventeenth century).

Thus, although every initiate is empowered to perform all the rituals associated with his own lineage diety, in practice, the seniormost member of the lineage - the thakali (also called nayo) and, to a lesser degree, his wife - the naldn -have special privi­leges and obligations along with other elders.19 Significantly, the thakali and his wife must be present for at least the preliminary stages of the rites ofTantric initiation of members of their lineage. Traditionally it is the thakali who performs the worship of the lineage deity in its aniconic form as a stone (see below). He must be present and often performs priestly functions in the major life cycle rites. In this he may complement the ritual activity of the family purohita. The purohita who, as we have said, must be a Brah­min, performs the Sanskrit rites. The thakiili may at times perform additional non-Sanskritic rites. A striking example of this is the kaytapuja. Amongst the upper castes this is done in conjunction with the smarta rite of passage in which a sacred thread is given to a young man as a sign of his entry into adulthood (upanayana). This part of the rite is basically the same as the one perf ormed in India, while the other part of the rite is important enough to give its name to the whole ritual. Essentially, this consists of the donation of a loincloth-kayta -to the young man as a token of his transformed status and full admission into his lineage as an adult. This is done not by the Brah­min, but by the thaka/i.20 Low castes (but not the lowest) who are not entitled to the smarta rite of passage retain the rites associated with the offering of the kayta. 19 This is generally true fo r all Newars, whether Hindu or Buddhist. Thus, the lineages ofBuddhist farmer castes (jytipu, maharjan) in Patan and Kathmandu have a group of five elders who lead their community (Gellner and Quigley 1995: 181 fn . 4). 20 Gellner reports that amongst the Buddhist farmer castes (maharjan): \"Once a Maharjan has been through the ritual of consecration of an elder (thakuli [= thaktili]layegu) in some circles he is considered able to act as a priest for such occasions as kaytti piljti (loincloth worship), thus making it unnecessary to invite the Vaj racarya, domestic priest.\" (Gellner and Quigley 1995: 181 fn. 4) 207"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"91 f}oumey in !he CWorld of !he %nfras I believe that these are examples of many remnants of Newar religious customs that pre-existed the introduction of rc ligion from India. Numerous anthropologists and historians have noted in a large number of contexts a hard core of beliefs and ritual practice, both individual and collective, that cannot be reduced to those of scrip­tural Hinduism or Buddhism. This should not surprise us. Indeed, we perceive the existence of analogous cores throughout the Indian sub­continent and wherever these religions have spreaJ. It is this core [which gives these religions and the traditional, es· entially religious societies to whose development they contribute. their particular re­gional and local character.

Moreo­ver, the subject is so extensive and controversial that it would require separate treatment. Even so, a few features of this core system of beliefs that are relevant to our topic need to be provisionally and succinctly tackled here, if we are to understand the specific character ofNewar religion and, more specifically, the Tantrism of the higher 1 castes which centres on the worship of the goddesses who are the subject of this essay. To do this Jet us begin by returning to the figure of the thakali. There are numerous circumstances in which the thaka/i functions as the priest of the lineage ofwhich he is the head. Amongst the lower castes he often operates in this capacity independently. In the case of the higher castes, his role as the lineage priest is eclipsed by the Sanskritic lineage priests, the guru,purohita and Karmacarya. None­theless the preeminent seniority he enjoys in his lineage is concretely apparent in his priestly functions. Particularly important from the point of view of this study is his role as the chief priest in the worship of a stone as the lineage deity, because Newar Saktism is also centred on the worship of lineage (kula) deities. The worship of these stones and, indeed the worship of stones as deities in general, is a characteristic feature ofNewar religion, both Buddhist and Hindu.

On the basis of the results of the surveys carried out so far, it transpires that the main deity worshipped in the stone by the lower castes, that is, those not entitled to receive Kaula initition, is male. Amongst the farmer (jyiipu) lineages in Bhakta pur we find, amongst others, Mahadeva and Naraya�a. The potters worship Ga�;tesa; stone-and metal-workers (iilpakar), Visvakarman; and the copper-and bronze-workers (tamrakiir), Mahadeva. The stones are usually kept in a specific place to which lineage members go every year. The stones may be moved, or others selected elsewhere into which the deity is invokedY In the course of the lengthy rite of ado-21 Vergati writes: \"What seemed to me specific to the Newars both Buddhists and Hindus was the relation between the lineage deity and a particular terri­tory. The divinity was situated obligatorily in the same area as that in which the ancestors and senior members of the lineage resided. Even if people are unable to explain in detail their genealogies they always know where their lineage deity is situated.\" (Vergati 1995: 18) 22 A notable example of this in Bhaktapur was the shifting of the digu stone of the Taleju R.ajopadhyayas. The stone was kept in a small sacred grove called Sillighari, just outside Bhakta pur, where numerous lineage stones are kept. Al­though the worship of digu stones is not usually done in secret, the R.aj opadhyayas do not wish to be observed when they perform these, or indeed, any rites. Ac­cordingly, they built a wall around the area where the stone was located. But the bricks were repeatedly removed from the wall, making it hard for them to keep their rites secret. Thus they decided that they should move their stone. Accord­ingly, some fo rty years ago, all adult male Rajopadhyayas of that lineage met around the stone. A ritual drawing of lots took place in order to ask the deity in the stone for its consent to move it. When the elders had decided on the basis of the outcome that this consent had been given, a new stone and companions were installed in the new location. And so now the new stone is located in a garden of the royal palace where the digu of the Malia kings is kept (see below). The potential mobility of the deities in such stones is well illustrated by the unusual case of the digu deity of the Tamrakars, the copper-and bronze-work­ers, ofBhaktapur. Although they always perform the rites of their digu deity at Hanuman Ghat, they do not have the usual set of fixed digu stones. They must go to the river to collect fresh stones every time they worship their digu. They do this at random by simply closing their eyes and taking the first stones of an appropriate size they happen to touch. Eight stones are selected in this way. Seven of them represent guardians (lcyetrapala), and the remaining one, the digu. 209"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"9l 8oumey in !he CWorld of !he Cfanlras ration the present and, if the stone has been shifted, previous loca­tions of the stone are mentioned and the year of its removal. Thus it is possible to find people who know of the stone's location even sev­eral hundreds of years back. It is also possible to share the same stone with others. This is what happens in the P11TQ.acaQQI temple in Patan. This and one other temple, also located in Patan, 23 along with three others in Bhakta pur 24 are the only open public temples to the goddess Siddhilak�?ml in the Valley. Here she is represented by a large stone. Although the god­dess of this temple is commonly known as P11TQ.acal).Qi, there can be no doubt the deity in the sl,lTine is Siddhilak�?mi, because the tympa­num bears an image of this goddess. Moreover, there is a lengthy hymn dedicated to this goddess inscribed on a slab cemented onto one of the walls. The temple was built by the Rajopadhyayas of the locality (Vala). The stone in the temple serves as the digu dyal:z of a large number of families living in Patan, including all the lineages of Rajopadhyayas in Patan.25 23 The other temple is associated with the Kirantis of eastern Nepal, a people who are perhaps descendants of the Kiratas who appear in many Newar leg­ends as the earliest known rulers of the Kathmandu Va lley. Slusser informs us that \"there are two sites in Patan where the Kiranti maintain traditional ties. One of these, the SiddhilaJq;mi temple near Tyagal-tol, attracts certain Kiranti families for the annual worship of their clan god, the Kuladevatti (degu, devtili)\" (Slusser 1982: 96). Although the local people do refer to the temple as one of Siddhilak�mi, the icon is not at all that of this goddess. Moreover, no inscrip­tion found on or near the temple refers to the deity in it as being this goddess. 24 The oldest temple in Bhaktapur dedicated to Siddhilak�mi was built by Jagatprakasamalla, who ruled between 1643 and 1672 A.D. This is located next to the Malia palace. His son, Jitamitramalla, who ruled from 1673 to 1696 A.D., built another one next the one his father had built. The third was built by Bhiipatindramalla (1696-1722 A.D.) in Ta:marhi square. See plate 1. 25 Up to recent times, there were six lineages ofRajopadhyayas in Patan, collec­tively called the Six Families ($atkula). They are all connected with Piifi.laCaJ:!Ql. The six families are: I) Balima, Patukva and Gabahal. These three belong to one family. They are descendants of three brothers who took up residence in these three places in Patan; 2) Sulima; 3) Vala, also called Valanima; 4) Svatha. Their Tantric shrine (tigafi) is in the Mucheril quarter ofPatan; 5) TaJ:uar:hlivi; 6) Nugal:J. This lineage came to an end three or four generations ago. 210"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"Cfhe Cull of the Qoddess CXubjika The story concerning the founding of this temple is still trans­mitted in the Val anima lineage of Rajopadhyayas, who are relatives of the present Taleju priests.26 The hero of this story is Visvanatha, the son of Gayal:,lbajya (see above fn. 6). He was the purohita and Tantric preceptor of King Siddhinarasirilhamalla, who ruled Patan from 1597 to 1619. Visvanatha, the story goes, found the goddess in the form of a stone in the Nakhu river, which in those days flowed next to the present location of the temple. The nearby pond is said to be a remnant of this river. Visvanatha and a certain Pull).ananda Svami, who is said to have come from Bengal, erected this temple with the help of the Malia king and other patrons. All the Rajopadhyayas of Patan go to this temple and perform digupuja in conjunction with their smtirta rites of passage, especially when their sons are given the sacred thread (vratabandha) and when they marry. They do not wor­ship their digu otherwise. Large numbers of people, including many from Kathmandu whose ancestors lived in Patan, come to this temple during the sea­son in which the digu is worshipped to perform the rites, using the stone in the temple as a substitute for their own digu stones. Re­search has revealed that as many as half the upper caste families of Patan worship their digu here.27 The number of people who make use of this stone in this way is so large that during the digupuja season they often have to wait a long time before their tum comes, and when it does they only have time to perform a brief digupuja. The animals that are customarily sacrificed may be cooked and eaten in one of the two rest houses located in the vicinity specially for this purpose. This appears to be a unique case. There are many examples of temples containing stones that serve as a substitute for digu stones. But normally in such cases the original digu stones are located else­where. This alternative is available to those families who have moved far from their original homes where their digu is located and find it hard for them to go there to worship it.

There is an old inscription on the temple wall that establishes that the temple was indeed constructed during the reign of Siddhinarasirilhamalla. This means that this unique custom cannot predate the middle of the seventeenth century, unless there were other such stones, or indeed this one itself was being used for this purpose. If the legend concerning the finding of the stone in the Nakhu river is true, then the latter hypothesis can be discarded. The reason why all this is possible is because the digu stone is ·just a temporary dwelling place of the lineage deity. Thus an essen­tial preliminary to digupiija is the invocation of the presence of the lineage deity into the stone. This can be done even when the stone is already 'occupied' by another deity. Indeed, Newars frequently in­voke the presence of deities in various objects, including ritual dia­grams, jars, and the other implements used in the ritual, sacrificial offerings, the place where the rite is performed, the sacrificial fire, themselves as priests 28 and in other people. Deities may even be invoked into icons of other deities.29 Despite much controversy con-28 When powerful, secret deities need to be taken out in procession during festivals, bundles are carried around the processional route. The general public is led to believe that they contain the 'original' form of the deity. At times there are two such mysterious bundles, thus adding further to the confusion and speculation. Even seasoned western researchers have been caught up in such 'intrigues'. Referring to the famous New Year's festival-Bisket Yatra -in Bhaktapur, Vergati tells us that: \"crushed in a large crowd I could watch what was happening in the Main Chowk [of the royal palace where Taleju's shrine is located] at the time of Bisket jatra but I was never able to see the box which reputedly contains the yantra ofthe goddess Taleju\" (Vergati 1995: 9f But even ifVergati had been able to see the box or even its contents, she would not have seen the deity because in actual fact, in this case as in many other such instances, the deity is not in what is being carried but within the person who carries it. Prior to his emergence in the public space the bearer has mentally extracted the deity or a part of it from its hidden location and projected it into his heart where it is safe and well hidden. 29 This is why Siddhilak�mi or Plin).acai).QI may not be the identity of the lineage deity of the families who worship their digu in the temple ofPiiri).acai).QI referred to previously.

The main officiant for this rite is the lineage elder-the thakali. If he is not initiated or unable, the rite may be performed by another senior member of the lineage. But if none have been initiated, it must necessarily be done by the lineage priest, who may be a Brahmin or, more commonly for such rituals, a Karmacarya. they wish the identity of the deity they are worshipping to be kept secret, to project the deity they are worshipping onto another one. In this way, it appears to the onlooker that a certain deity is being worshipped whereas, in fact, that deity simply serves as the vehicle of the deity that is really being worshipped. 30 It may appear at first sight that there are no written liturgies for digupujti or the rites performed at large festivals. But this is·not the case for the higher castes at least. Thus the NGMPP has microfilmed a manuscript of the liturgy prescribed for the worship of the digu of the Malia kings, Dviriunaju. The text is simply called Dvimmti}upujti and is NGMPP reel no. B 703/7. In order to find the written liturgies for the secret rites performed in public festivals, one must first know the deities that are worshipped on these occasions and the rites performed at that time. During Bisket Yatra, for example, the rite performed in secret in the Malia palace in Bhaktapur is centred on the ceremonial raising of a banner in honour of the goddess Siddhilak�mi. Several manuscripts of this liturgy have been microfimed by the NGMPP. One is the Siddh ila/cyml­kotytihutidhvajtirohaf)avar$avardh anavidhi, NGMPP reel no. A 249/4. 31 Vergati writes concerning digupujti: \"The annual ceremony always takes place according to the fo llowing schema: the pa}ti begins with a meditation by all the members of the lineage who, in their minds, focus on the image of their chosen deity. The head of the lineage (or the ritual specialist) invites the deity to take its place in the stones. An animal victim is then slaughtered ... \" (Vergati 1995: 55ff.). A little further on she describes this procedure in greater detail: \"Those who participate in the pujti stand facing the stones. The officiant is in front of them, also facing the stones. All are bare-headed, with hands joined at chest level, fingers pointing to the ground. The participants attempt to visualize the image of the deity and to project it into the stone. Before the silent meditation (tivtihana [that is, invocation]) which lasts several minutes, the digu dy o [i.e. dy ab] stone is only a stone: afterwards, it is the seat of the divinity throughout the duration of the ceremony\" (ibid. 57). 213"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"9l 8ourney in the CWorld of !he Cfan!ras As I have noted already, the lower castes who are not allowed to take Tantric initiation worship non-Tantric deities (and in some cases Bhairava) in the digu stone. The rites may also be done by a Karmlicarya or a Brahmin for them, but it is much more usual for them to do it for themselves. Even though they do not take initiation from a Brahmin, they also maintain a room or shrine where an Image of the deity is kept. But in many cases the identity of the deity is not kept as scrupulously secret as it would be by the higher castes. I believe that all these facts make sense if we postulate the exist­ence of an original cutural substratum or substrata which predate the introduction of Buddhism and Hinduism. I believe the form of this core culture may be discerned, to some degree at least, by examining the practices and beliefs that cannot be traced to the Sanskrit texts, Buddhist or Hindu, those, that is, that are not Indian. This does not, of course, exclude other possible influences, but these appear to be minor compared to those from India. The society, culture and reli­gion of the farmer castes (jyapu, maharjan) appears in many respects to coincide most with this ancient core, although it has undergone a steady process of Sanskritization for many centuries. As Gellner writes: \"It is remarkable that although nearly all other Newar caste sub­groups have a myth which traces their origin to somewhere else, usu­ally India, the Maharjans have no such myth. Even at the level of the sub-caste within one city there appear to be no such myths. As dis­tinct from this, specific lineages do of course often have traditions which record their migration from some other place within the Val­ley. Thus, not claiming to come from outside, the Mahaijans have been seen to be the true locals. This has led some observers to see them as descendents of the original inhabitants of the Valley and to look for ancient survivals in their culture and social practices.\" (Gellner 1995: 160) This older religion appears to have been strongly centred on ancestor worship that was based on the belief that people, both men and women, acquire the status of deity as they grow old. Accord­ingly, Newars still undergo three succesive rites of passage (called burtijamkwa) every ten years from the time they reach the age of77 years 7 months 7 days 7 gha!i (about 2 hours) and 7 palas (about 2 214"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"crbe Cull of !he Qoddes.s CXubjika minutes). After this ritual a person \"leaves the world of men for that of the gods\" (Vergati 1995: 12). If he lives to undergo the third ritual passage he is belived to be fully deified. Thus the very first member of the clan was the most senior, the most divine. I believe, although no immediately apparent trace of this belief survives, that he was the original deity whose presence was invoked in the digu stoneY Whether this is true or not there can be no doubt that from the start this religion was domestic. The domestic unit was not the family, not even the extended joint family, as in India, but the phuki -the group of closely related patrilineal families. I suggest that the priests of the phukis were the most aged members. They performed the rites of passage for the phuki members and the worship of the phuki's deities. Another important surviving feature of this religion is the wor­ship of protectors. They are the original forms of the GaQ.esas who protect each locality, the Bhairavas who protect whole towns and villages or large areas of them, the Mothers who encircle human set­tlements, and others. Like the digu deities, they have iconic counter­parts which are usually kept apart except on certain occasions when the two are brought together. In Newari the Bhairavas and the Moth­ers can be generically referred to as Aju (lit. 'grandfather') and Ajima (lit. 'grandmother'), implying, it seems, that some of them, at least, were believed to have originally been deified human beings. Thus, according to Newar legend, some of the Bhairavas were originally 32 I say this fully conscious of how controversial this view is. Thus Ishii writing about the Newar village of Satungal says: \"Although the digu dy a/:1 is the deity of the lineage there is not the slightest suggestion of what one finds in other cultures, that the lineage god is a deified ancestor. Neither the legends about the early settlers of Satungal nor the sraddha ceremony is related to this deity. Moreover, in some cases, the same digu dy a/:1 is wor­shipped by many groups not patrilineally related, though all patrilineally related people worship the same digu dy a/:1\" (Ishii 1995: 146). In reply one could say that sraddha rites belong to a separate ritual dimension. And we have seen that the same stone may be the abode of different lineage deities fo r different people. It is possible that the ancestral origin of the digu dy a/:1 and of the other ancient deities of the early inhabitants of the Kathmandu Va lley has been forgotten. 215"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"9l 8oumey in !he CWorld of !he 'Tanlras kings who, as deities, continue the royal function they perform as human beings of protecting their peopleY All these beings were, and still are, worshipped in stones. The Sanskritized name for such stones is, appropriately, pifha, which lit­erally means 'seat'. While the digu stones (which are never referred to as pithas) originally marked the location of the phuki and so are moveable and had human origin, the plfha stones are markers and delineators of place common to the community as a whole. They were not placed in their locations but discovered there. They protect larger or smaller areas, according to their status, function and loca­tion, all three of which are interrelated. Thus some mark and protect areas that together cover the whole Valley. Others protect villages, sectors of towns, the roads, crossroads, houses, and courtyards, even refuse dumps. Such stones are to be found everywhere, both in the countryside and -where they are particularly profuse -in human setNements. These stones are, indeed must be, worshipped by those who live close to them. Occasionally the inhabitants of a town or village decide that they should worship all the stones in which dei-33 Anderson (1975: 156) writes that: \"The estimated five million Bhairab images in Nepal are seen in sixty­fo ur different manifestations and fo rms depicting his combined human, de­monic and animal characteristics.\" These sixty-four manifestations are the male counterparts of the sixty­four yoginis. This purely Tantric representation also depicts both the Bhairavas and their consorts as divinized human beings, that is, perfect Tantric adepts (siddha) and the female adepts with which they unite. Here, as in many other instances, the representations of the Sanskrit scriptures coincide in principle with popular local beliefs. The human origin of one of the major Bhairavas in Kathmandu illustrates this thesis. He is represented by five small stones in an open temple site near the Bagmati River between Tripuresvara and Kalimati, just south of old Kathmandu. The Newars, Anderson informs us, \"conform­ing with legends in which many Bhairabs are identified as various Nepalese kings, say Pachali is the name of one such sovereign who ruled from Farping village near Chobar Gorge\" (ibid. 158). Another myth represents Pacali Bhairava as belonging to the Jyapu farmer caste and his lover a Khasai (butcher) girl.

When this took place in Patan in 1989 Gutschow counted 442 ofthem.34 An important clue to the manner in which this earlier religion, centred on the worship of such stones, is incorporated into the Sanskritic religions of India, both Hindu and Buddhist, is the ritual that takes place when the iconic counterparts of the stones are brought to them. This rite is essentially a form of installation (pr{u:zaprati$!hti) of the deity into the stone and the icon (or its representation), followed by worship. We witness here the symbiosis of the two religions. The stone draws its life force (prti�:za) from the icon and the icon from the stone. The two must therefore, at some time at least, be worshipped together. This may take place just once a year or more often, according to cus­tom. In the case of the royal goddess Taleju, the stone which is the digu ofthe Malia kings (called Dvirilmaju) must always be worshipped along with its equivalent iconic form and vice versa even in the course of the daily rites (nityapuja). These rituals always involve the invoca­tion of the deity (tivtihana), which can be considered, in some re­spects, to be a reduced form of the fully developed rite of installation. We observe in this way how the Sanskrit mantras, and especially the powerful Tantric mantras used in such rites Sanskritize the earlier 34 Gutschow writes: \"The irreversible character of urban space is closely linked to the idea that essentially the quality of 'place' reveals itself through aniconic repre­sentations of gods and goddesses, namely, Ga1.1esa, Bhairava, and Durga. In Patan there are altogether 442 such representations, which are collectively called piga, as the specific connotation remains mostly vague. These piga are unhewn stones, which emerge out of the ground and reach eventually a height of one or two meters; or they are flat stones, integrated into the regu­lar pavement of squares and streets. These stones have first been discovered or 'found' by ritual specialists through Tantric power and in many cases the legends tied to this discovery have survived and fo rm the base for a ritual reenactment of that detection of the sacred.\" (Gutschow 1995: 112ff.) One may hazard the suggestion that these discoveries are more often than not colonizations of the earlier, autochthonous, deities in the stones by their Tantric counterparts brought about by these Tantric ritual specialists. Thus what Gutschow explains is the \"aniconic infrastructure of the town\" that represents \"the power ofthe place which enables people to live there\" (ibid.) has become a network ofTantric energies wielded by the protectors of place. 217"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"9l f}oumey in !he CWorld of !he Cfan!ras aniconic forms and how these latter are reaffirmed in their function of contributing their energy to the empowerment of the deities from which these mantras originate. Thus the ancient guardians of the Newars become the attendants of the Tantric goddesses of the higher castes, empowering them even as they are empowered by them to perform their functions as protectors of place and lineage. The sources of the hi story of the development of these forms of Tantrism amongst the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley include the common sources of any aspect of Nepalese history, namely, inscrip­tions, chronicles, the records of land grants, business transactions, corporate trusts (guthis) and the colophons of manuscripts contain­ing dates or dateable references. But particularly important, and as yet virtually untouched, are the immense number of liturgical works (paddhati, pujavidhi) the Newars have written to regulate, in part at least, their very many and often extremely extensive, esoteric ritual procedures. Indeed, along with ethnological and historical studies, a study of these texts, together with the Tantras that are their primary literary sources, is essential in order to understand the specific form Newar Saktism has assumed over the past thousand years since its introduction into the Valley from India. These Hindu texts (I am not concerned with Newar Buddhism) can be broadly classified, in terms of this enquiry, into three basic types: 1) Those liturgies that are constructed entirely from materials drawn from Tantric sources, that is, from texts written in Sanskrit called Tantras or synonyms of that term. 2) Those liturgies which contain, usually in very moderate de­grees, passages drawn from the Vedas which, Newar Brahmins insist, can only be recited by them. These are important but relatively few. 3) Those liturgies that contain in varying degrees material drawn from other sources that are not in written form. These include an immense range of ritual activity that appears to be derived from local custom. It is worth noting that very little of this activity is, in the form it is at present, intrinsically articulate. When something is said, the speaker makes use of a language which is not local, namely, San­skrit, even if it is usually quite corrupt and, not uncommonly, mixed with Newari. In order to avoid the controversial term 'tribal', one could call these sources, simply, non-Sanskritic. 218"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"CJbe Cull of !he Qodde ss CXuhjika For the sake of clarity, it is worth stressing that there is also a great deal of ritual activity that takes place 'without a book', as the Newars put it. This may also be to varying degrees Sanskritic in the sense that it is both guided by the religious notions and pantheon common to Hindus throughout South Asia and/or related to forms of the sacred that are local and, therefore, non-Sanskritic. Although such non-literate ritual activity is important and, statistically, constitutes a considerable amount of the ritual activity Newars engage in, that done 'with a book' is considered to be the most powerful, however great the non-Sanskritic elements it may contain. If we examine these liturgies referring to the simple three-fold classification outlined above, we notice that the basic structure, even of those of the third type, is the one which is most coherently and systematically elaborated in the first type, to which belong liturgies constructed entirely from materials drawn from Tantric sources. In this tangible and direct manner Tantrism serves as a vehicle of Sanskritization at the very core ofNewar culture, radically rooted as it is in religion that is to a very large degree ritualistic. In this and other ways, notably its art, Tantrism is a ubiquitous part ofNewar culture. For high-caste Newars, and to proportionately varying degrees as one descends the hierarchy of the Newar caste system, insofar as the de­gree of access to these rites is a measure of caste status, esoteric Tantric rites combine with domestic rituals including, as we have seen, the smtirta rites of passage and the worship oflineage deities (digu dyal)). They also form an invariable part of civic festivals. In both cases they perform the essential function of energizing them from 'within' to render them effective. This esoteric Sanskritic dimension of Newar religious culture is most developed amongst the higher castes because only they are allowed to take the initiation which authorize them to perform and attend the purely Tantric rituals in their most complete form belonging to the first group. The upper sections of the lower castes have access to such rituals, although these are centred on dei­ties who serve as attendants of the esoteric deities of the higher castes. 35 35 These attendants - for the most part one or other of the Eight Mothers who surround and protect Newar settlements - are identified by initiates with the great lineage goddesses, especially Kubjika, because they are ema­nated from them. 219"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"9l (Journey In !he CUJorld of !he %nfras Moreover, as one goes down the caste hierarchy, rituals tend to con­tain, as one would expect, greater proportions of non-Sanskritic ele­ments. Although not prominent in the esoteric Tantric rituals of the higher castes, they do make their appearance in some of the more elaborate occasional Tantric rites of even Newar Brahmins. Another distinguishing feature of the esoteric religion of the higher castes in relation to the more exoteric religion of the lower is that the former is centred on the worship of goddesses, while the equivalent religion of the lower castes concentrates more on their male equivalents. I must stress that I am contrasting the esoteric reli­gion of the high castes to which access can only be had through ini­tiation with that of the lower castes who are generally not entitled to take such initiations. But rather than examine the development of Newar Tantrism that has taken place at the hands of the Newars themselves as re­flected by these liturgical works, I wish instead to explore some of the salient features and developments of the specifically Tantric tra­ditions that are their original and most authoritative Sanskrit sources. In order to do this I will focus primarily on the Tantras and related material pertaining to the early period of the development of Kaula Tantrism, that is, prior to the thirteenth century of the current era. 36 36 It is possible to distinguish two great periods of development of Hindu Tantric traditions. The dividing line between them are the works of the monistic Kashmiri Saiva exegetes beginning with Vasugupta (ninth century) and ending with Jayaratha (thirteenth century). For uncertain reasons, of which I believe the major one to be the disruption brought about by the progressive Muslim conquest of North India, there was a sudden catastrophic break in most of the lineages of the major Tantric traditions in northern India in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Most of the Tantric traditions that survived this break were those found in South India at that time. One major exception of particular importance for this study is the Kubjikli cult, which by this time was, it seems, well established amongst the Newars in the Kathmandu Valley and has continued to develop there since then. Another is the cult ofTripurli. The new Tantrism that developed after this period in northern India was dominantly Slikta, that is, centred on goddess cults. A great deal of the con­tents of these cults were built up from the vague memories of the earlier ones that had been lost but which were generally more extensively and systemati­cally developed than their successors. 220"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"CJbe Cull of !he Qoddess CXubjlka This is because, although the Newars continued to absorb forms of Tantrism from North India throughout the period of the development of Hindu, especially Sakta, Tantrism in that region, the Tantric tradi­tions of the early period centred on the goddesses Kubjika, Kali and Tripura have remained by far the most dominant sources for them.37 Amongst these three goddesses two are especially important. One is Kubjika because she appears, from the field work done so far, to be the goddess of most, if not all, of the higher-caste priests of the Hindu Newars. This is certainly true in Bhaktapur. It is probably for this rea­son, and insofar as it is the priests who have made the liturgies, that Kubjika functions in innumerable ways, which are still the objects of research, as the energizing centre of the Newar esoteric Sakta pantheon.38 37 The group ofTen Goddesses, the so-called Dasa Mahavidya, which became a very important configuration of divine forms in North India from about the sixteenth century onwards, are well known to the Newars. They even figure in the sacred geographies of Kathmandu, Patan and Bhaktapur. From what I have been able to gather from interviews, they are also to be fo und in some of the rooms or chapels (tigaii) of higher-caste initiates where they worship their Tantric family goddesses (kuladevatti). Apart from the aniconic stones in which they reside (pltha) encircling Kathmandu and Patan, some of them have tem­ples. One important temple is dedicated to the goddess Bagalamukhi. It is located in the temple complex ofKumbhesvara in Patan. Framed paintings of all ten of the Dasa Mahavidyas adorn the upper part of the outer walls. 38 One striking example of the way this is done is found in most of the Newar liturgies of all these Kaula goddesses. The initial purification of the hands and body of the officiant that must precede all Tantric rituals is done by mentally projecting mantras onto the body. This transforms the body, speech and mind of the officiant into that of a deity and so renders him fit to worship the deity. The mantra fo r this process (technically called nytisa-lit. 'deposition') is invariable Kubjika's Thirty-Two-Syllable Vidya (the Newars call it 'battls l' which literally means 'thirty-two-( syllabled) one'). The Kaula initiation which is most popular in Bhaktapur is called the Va $i$thadlk$akarmapaddhati (which is probably a misnomer for Viii$tadlk$tikarmapaddhatz). I was given a copy by a Bhairavacarya ofBhaktapur. The preparatory phases ofthe initiation which render the disciple fit to receive the mantra of his or her lineage goddess re­quire that the teacher project the mantras ofKubjika onto the disciple's body. This is invariably the case regardless of the identity of the lineage goddess of the person receiving initiation. The basic identity of the initiate as a ritual agent is here clearly revealed to be Kubjika. I plan to deal extensively with this important and complex aspect ofNewar Saktisrn in future publications. 221"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"9l 8ourney in !he CUJorld of !he %nfras The other goddess is Kali. Although goddesses have numerous forms, as do South Asian deities in general, some of Kali's forms have especially well-defined identities. Three of these figure promi­nently in Newar esoteric Sructism. These are Dak�ii).akali, Guhyakali and Siddhilak�mi.39 Especially the last two are so well defined that even though they are both forms of Kali, they possess separate and extensive Tantras of their own from which the basics of their cults, that is, their mai).<;lalas and mantras, are drawn. These Tantras are the Guhyakalltantra 40 along with the Mahakalasarizhita 41 and the 39 The correct Sanskrit name of this goddess is Si ddhal�mi, but she is known to the Newars as Siddhil�mi. As these are her last and if not her only wor­shippers, certainly they are the most important ones left, I prefer the Newari fo rm to which I am, anyway, habituated. 40 According to Divfur Acarya, whom I gratefully acknowledge for the in­formation, there is a fourteenth-century palm leaf manuscript of this Tantra preserved in the Kaisar Library in Kathmandu. Another incomplete manu­script has been microfilmed by the NGMPP from a private collection. The root mantra of Guhyaka!I is taken from this Tantra. This is the form of the mantra used in the worship ofGuhyakali at night (nisa rcana) that takes place at the conclusion of her procession (yatra) from the Taleju temple in Kathmandu to her main temple in the Pasupati area (see Michaels 1994 for details). The liturgy (the text of which is called Guhyesvarlnisarcanavidhif:z, NGMPP reel no. A 948/4) is centred on the Secret (guhya) Ka!I's secret iden­tity, namely, Kubjika, or, to be more precise, Kubjika's Weapon. The form of the mantra itself confirms this identity by addressing the goddess as Guhyakubjika as fo llows: OM GUHYAKUBJIKE HOM PHAT MAMA SARVOPADRAVAYA YANTRAMANTRATANTRACORI':/APRAYOGADIKAM YENA K�TAM KARAYITAM KARISYATI TAN SARVAN HANA HANA DAMSTRAKARALI HREM HRIM HOM HREM HOM PHAT GUHYAKUBJIKA YAI SV AHA The mantra is found in the tenth chapter of the KMT. By omitting OM and SVAHA the Sword Weapon (khat;fgastra) mantra is formed. This is the mantra of one ofKubjika's Maids (Diiti), namely, that of the Weapon. She is identified with Guhyakaii who is also known as Guhycivart. The KMT goes on to inform us that the source of this mantra is the separate, independent (svatantra) Tantra called Guhyaklili consisting of 125,000 verses (KMT l 0/20-30). This means not only that the cult ofGuhyakali pre-existed the KMT, but that it was colonized by the Kubjika cult at a very early period of its development. As there is at least one Nepalese manuscript of the KMT belonging to the first half of the eleventh century (see below), we know that this must have taken place by that time. 222"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"Cfbe Cull of !he Qodde .ss CXubjika Jayadrathayamala,42 respectively.

This took place in 1654 A.D. Ac­cording to this chronicle he found the spot where the goddess was located \"having perused the book Mahakala Sanhita (sic)\". A similar reference is found in the Rajavamstivali (6: 4). The worship ofGuhyesvari in the Valley in conjunction with Pasupati certainly predates the founding of this temple (Michaels 1994: 315). Indeed, the couple and their residence in the Valley are mentioned in several early Tantras, including those of the Kubjika cult. She is known, fo r example, to the Nisisamcaratantra, of which there is a palm leaf manuscript (see bibliography). The text is written in old Newari script which may be as old as the twelfth century or earlier. But although the text is early, the exposition of the pit has found in this text does not agree with that found in references from the Nisisamcara quoted in Kashmiri works (see Dyczkowski 1988: 156 fn. 251 ). Several fo lios of this manuscript are miss­ing; moreover, the order of the remaining ones is badly disarranged. The reference begins on the bottom line of the first part of the fourth fo lio in the serial order in which the manuscript was microfilmed.

There are no early references to this text and it is virtually unknown outside the Kathmandu Valley. One wonders whether it was a Newar creation. Further research will disclose the degree of influence this Tantra, of which there are numerous Nepalese manuscripts, has exerted on the Newar cult of Guhyakaii. 42 This Tantra which, along with the Manthtinabhairavatantra of the Kubjika school, is the longest known in existence, extends fo r 24,000 verses. No part of it has yet been edited and published. It was well known to the Kashmiri Saivites of the eleventh century who referred to it respectfully as 'Tantrarajabhattaraka' � the Venerable King of Tantras. This was a major source of the Kashmiri Kaii cult (as Kalasarilkar�a!Jl) as it is of the cult of the goddess Taleju (i.e. Siddhilak�mi) for the Newars. 223"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"9I fjo umey in the CWorld of the Cfanlras Malia kings, known to the public as Taleju.43 It is worth noting that even in the case of the cult ofthe goddess Siddhilak�?mi, despite her central role in Newar Saktism, both in its most esoteric forms and its public manifestations, where she figures as Taleju, the goddess Kubjika operates, as elsewhere in the rich complex ofNewar Saktism, as the primary source of power in numerous very secret, and hence especially powerful, ritual contexts. An example of this process is the secret connection that the Taleju priest establishes between the two goddesses. It is this connection and identification, enacted ritu­ally at prime moments in the liturgical cycle, which keeps the king's goddess powerful. Thus the source of power and, ultimately, the most fundamental identity of Siddhilak�?mi - the lineage goddess of the king -is Kubjika, the lineage goddess of his priest. But despite her truly extraordinary importance for Newar Saktas, the goddess Kubjika, unlike the popular goddesses Kali and Tripura, is virtually unknown outside the circles of her Newar initiates in the Kathmandu Valley. Even so, the Kaula Tantras concerned with her cult are numerous and extensive, as is befitting of a goddess that has been given such prominence. Her virtually total obscurity outside Nepal does not mean that Kubjika is a Nepalese goddess. The Newars have been surprisingly prolific as compilers of liturgical works for their own rituals, but there is, as yet, little evidence that they have 43 Referring to the goddess Kali, Sanderson (1988: 684) states that: \"the Newars, who maintain the early traditions of the region, preserve her link with the Northern Transmission. For them Guhyakali is the embodiment of that branch of Kaulism. Linked with her in this role is the white goddess Siddhalak�mi (always written Siddhilak�mi in Nepal) one of the apotropaic deities (Pratyangira) of the Jayadrathayamala and the patron goddess of the Malia kings (1200-1768) and their descendants.\" This statement is, I sup­pose, based on the study ofNewar Kaula liturgies. Thus, without having to ask embarrassing questions the scholar has penetrated one of the Newars' most closely guarded secrets by studying their liturgies. This is a fine exam­ple of how the work of the anthropologist in the field can be usefully supple­mented by that of the textual scholar. We may also note that if Sanderson is correct when he says that \"Guhyakali is the embodiment of the Northern Transmission\" fo r the Newars, it fo llows that the Northern Transmission has been subordinated by them to the Western Transmission belonging to the goddess Kubjika. 224"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"Cfhe Cull of !he 9oddess CXubjika composed Tantras of their own.44 It appears from the studies made so far that virtually all of the very many Tantras found in manuscripts in Nepal were labouriously copied and brought from outside the Kathmandu Valley. Despite the very rich sacred geography of the Kubjika Tantras, Nepal is only very rarely mentioned. On the other hand, innumerable references in the texts clearly indicate that Kubjika was originally an Indian goddess. Specifically, the Kubjika Tantras frequently refer to her as the goddess of the land ofKorikar:ta, which corresponds to the long strip of land between the Western Ghats and the sea, and, even more specifically, to her connection with the city of Candrapura. Of the many places sacred to the goddess in India mentioned in her Tantras, only Candrapura is identified as the home (vefman lit. 'house') of the Western Transmission, which is that of the Kubjika cult. The passage cited below goes so far as to identify the place with the goddess's mar:t<;lala, her most personal abode: \"That, indeed, is the Western House (vesman) called the City of the Moon (Candrapura). This is the first mar:t<;lala and (first source of) authority for (the initiates) who recite mantras.\"45 44 See the end of note 41. The Kubjikopani$ad, although not technically a Tantra, is virtually so in much of its content. This text may have been pro­duced by a Newar Brahmin. The Brahminical pseudo-Vedic character of the text is not only attested by the extensive quotations it makes from the Atharvaveda but by its own statement that \"a worshipper ofKubjika ... should be a brahman from Parasara's clan and a teacher in the school ofPippalada­saunaka as taught in the Atharvaveda\" (Kubjikopani$ad 1 0/2). The relatively late date of the text is indicated by the central place it gives to the Ten Mahavidyas (see above fn . 37). That the text may well have been written by a Newar initiate who was acquainted with the worship of both Kubjika and Siddhilak�mi transpires from the central place given to Siddhilak�mi as the most important of the Mahavidyas and her identification with Kubjika in her fo rm as Siddhikubji. By the time the Ten Mahavidyas became popular in India, the worship of Siddhilak�mi and other related goddesses outside the Kathmandu Va lley had probably ceased. Moreover, the worship of Siddhi­lak�rni as one of the Ten Mahavidyas in the primary textual sources is very rare, if not unique to this text. Thus her place of honour as the greatest, most regal of these ten 'royal' goddesses, as they are described in this text, indi­cates that this text may well have been written by a Newar Brahmin initiate who may have been one of the priests of the goddess Taleju I Siddhilak�mi. 45 etad vai pascimaril veima candrapuryeti ntimatal:z I ma�;¢a/am prathamedam tu adhiktiraril tu mantri�;am II (KuKh 3/12) 225"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"9l 8oumey in !he CWor!d of !he %nlra.s We know of two Candrapuras that fit the descriptions found in the texts. One was an important town in what is now the Garwal disttjct of the western Himalaya. Not far from it is a mountain called Candraparvata. Moreover, both these places are approximately to the west ofKailasa, which is where these places are said to be located by the KMT, the earliest and root Tantra of the Kubjika cult.46 On the basis of this and other references, and because of the goddess's many association with mountains, I have expressed the opinion in a previ­ous publication that Candrapura was located somewhere in the Hima­layas (Dyczkowski 1988a: 91). This was also the opinion ofGoudriaan (Goudriaan 1981: 52) but not ofSchoterman (Schoterman 1982: 37) who preferred the South Indian location detailed below. The other Candrapura is located in Goa, the ancient kingdom of KonkaQa. Nowadays it is called Chandor, and it was the capital of the Silaharas, who ruled this area in the fourth century A.D. At the begin­ning of the eleventh century, the Kadambas of Goa under Sa�thadeva (c. 1005-1050 A.D.) extended their authority over the whole of Goa, vanquishing the Silaharas. They moved the capital from Candrapura (Chandor) to Goapuri (Goa Velha) in about 1052.47 The following passage from chapter 43 of the Satsahasrasamhita confirms the con­nection between Candrapura and the Kadamba kings. The passage talks about an important founder figure called Siddhanatha (variously named, O<,l<,lisanatha, Tu�Qinatha, and Kurmanatha in the text) and his advent to the city of Candrapura, of which the Tantra says: \"There is a city there called Candrapura (the City of the Moon) with (many) citizens located on the beautiful and extensive shore of the western sea in the auspicious forest by the sea in the great land called KonkaQa.\" 48 46 merob pascimadigbhage I (KMT l/59c) 47 S.

The Tantra thus presents Kubjikii as a goddess of a royal cult, and she is indeed one of the Newars' royal goddesses. And there seems to be little reason to doubt that, at some stage in the early development of the tradition, Kubjikii was a South Indian goddess. 5° However, this South Indian Candrapura may not have been the god­dess's original home. The earlier KMT does refer to the land of Korikacya but does not stress its importance in the emphatic manner the later Kubjikii Tantras do. In fact, as Heilijgers-Seelen (1994: 2) points out: \"the texts themselves are inconsistent with regard to the place of origin of the Kubjikii cult, but the basic text [i.e. the KMT] seems to locate this place somewhere in northern India in the west­em regions of the Himalayas.\" The later Tantras, namely the Satsii­hasrasamhitii and the Manthiinabhairavatantra, on the other hand, repeatedly stress the connection between Candrapura and Korikacya. These facts seem to indicate that the Kubjika cult was, as Goudriaan says, \"originally located in the Himalayan region\" (Goudriaan 1981: 52).

Mahesvariinanda, who was a disciple ofVidyiinanda and lived in the part of South India ruled at that time by the Cholas, quotes from Kubjika sources in three places in his auto-commentary on the Maharthamanjarl (two on p. 4 and one on p. 126). Although these references have not been traced in the KMT, he appears to have been acquainted with the Kubjikii Tantras which, although little known, must therefore have been in circulation in South India in the fourteenth century.

That the cult was already established in central India by the eleventh century with its centre in this Candrapura is supported by the following inscrip­tion from Kan:Iataka (Nelamangala taluka) dated 1030 A.D. com­memorating the founding of a Siddhesvara temple: \"At the foot of a wonderful tree in Candrapuri, [which is] situ­ated by the western ocean, Adinatha is installed.

If so, we know from the colophon of his work that he resided at some time in Kashmir 52 and received initiation in Pravarapura (modem Shrinagar) where, as the colophon states, \"the venerable Vitastajoins the Indus\". 53 Although the Kubjika cult was not popular in Kashmir, there is evidence attesting its presence there in the first half of the eleventh century. 54 We must be cautious, however, in making this identification because the Satstihasrasamhitti and the Manthtina­bhairavatantra themselves cannot be dated earlier than the begin­ning of the eleventh century, both of them apparently referring to major Muslim invasions.

This may be one of the reasons for the confusion between the two Candrapuras in the texts. But whether the Kubjika cult was introduced into Nepal from the Western Himalaya as Heilijgers-Seelen (1994: 2) asserts or not is a matter for further research. Nowadays, almost all the manuscripts of the Kubjika Tantras and related works are in Nepal or are of Nepalese origin. The text with by far the greatest number of manuscripts is the KMT. Sixty-six manuscripts, complete and fragmentary, of the KMT have been found and examined by the editors of the KMT. This is truly a massive number for any sort of text, especially Tantric, and represents yet another measure of the immense popularity and importance of the Kubjika cult amongst the Newars.

(Slusser: I, 398). Thus we can safely say that the cult of the goddess Kubjika had not only reached the Valley by the beginning of the eleventh century but was already developing throughout it. Inci­dentally, it is worth noting that it appears from the form of Vivekaratna's name that he was a renouncer. Thus although, as we have seen, Rajopadhyaya Brahmins became the centre and mainstay of the esoteric network ofNewar Tantric Saktism, this does not nec­essarily mean that they were the original propagators of it in the Kathmandu Valley. Even so, they may well have played an important role in its spread, as they certainly did in its application and adapta­tion to Newar culture and religious life.60 This great Agama which illumines the jewel of the Srikula was copied (sarhlikhitam, lit. 'written') with devotion by the venerable Kull!.cl!.rya and scholar Vivekaratna.\" This reference informs us that Vivekaratna resided in kli$1habhidha, that is, a '(place) called Kl!.�tha'.

If the dating of the original of this manuscript is correct and it belongs to the eleventh century, then this is the earliest reference so far re­covered to the place which was to fuse with its neighbouring settlements and ultimately give its name, after several centuries, to the city fo rmed thereby. Prior to the discovery of this colophon Slusser (1982: 89) informs us that when she was writing: \"the first record ofKa�thama1,1<,lapa as a place name is encountered in a colophon dated A.D. 1143 (N.S. 263).\" 60 It is worth mentioning in passing that the rapid spread of this, and many other Tantric systems, may well be due to the large part peripatetic ascetics played in their propagation and, probably, in their original redaction. The original redactors and propagators of the Tantras, as the language of the texts shows, possessed only a basic and frequently defective, knowledge of San­skrit. But even this could only have been acquired by those who had access to the language. In this period, there were only two types of people who would easily have had this privilege, namely male Brahmins and ascetics. I believe that the latter were prominent in the initial stages of the formation and propagation of a wide range of Tantric cults, including those we are discussing here. In the subsequent phases of domestication and institution­alization, Brahmins played more important roles and in many places, as in the Kathmandu Va lley, they became dominant. An interesting and important hybrid, which nicely combines the two, is the Brahmin renouncer. This fig­ure, although unknown in the Kathmandu Valley at present, was immensely important in the development of all forms ofTantrism in India. 231"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"9! 8oumeg in !he CWorld of !he %n!ras So far there is no evidence for the existence of the cult ofTripura in the Valley at this time. The reason for this may well be simply that the cult had not yet developed sufficiently in India. Early manuscripts of Saivasiddhanta Agamas and Paiicaratrasarhhitas establish that the Tantric cults of Siva and Vi�r;u prescribed by these scriptures existed alongside their Purar;ic equivalents which drew extensively from them. These forms ofTantrism continue to be popular in South India but gave way to Kaula Tantrism in Nepal. The Bhairava Tantras, an­other important category of early Saivite Tantras, are exemplified by the (now exclusively Nepalese) manuscripts of the Brahmayamala and the Sritantrasadbhava. Although these texts prescribe Bhairava cults, they are replete with rituals centred on the worship of the god­desses who are Bhairava's consorts. In this and in many other re­spects they represent a point of transition from the earlier Saiva to the later Sakta cults.61 The Jayadrathayamala, to which we have al­ready referred as the root Tantra of the proto-cults of Siddhilak�mi, considers itself to be a part of the Bhairava current. 62 And the Sruantra­sadbhava, as we shall see, is an important source for the Kubjika tradition. 61 I do not mean to say that the cults prescribed by these texts led an exclu­sive existence apart from others. There always was, as there is now, over­lapping of any one cult with others. Many of the cults of the Bhairava Tantras may have predated a large part of those of the Saivasiddhanta Agamas. The fo llower of one may also have been initiated into those of the other. One could say that this tendency to blend together diverse cults is the practical consequence of the radical polytheism of Hinduism as a whole. By this I mean that Hindus, like the ancient Greeks, never worship a deity alone. He or she is always accompanied by others even though, unlike the Greeks, Hindus may perceive the deity as having an ultimate, absolute identity. 62 A typical colophon found at the end of each chapter (patala) of the Jayadrathaytimala reads: iti bhairavasrotasi vidytipithe siraschede jayadrathaytima/e mahtitantre caturvirnsatistihasre '(this is a chapter of) the great Tantra, Jayadrathayamala, (otherwise known as) the Sirascheda, con­sisting of twenty-four thousand verses which belongs to the Seat of Knowl­edge of the Bhairava current'.

Moreover, this person or group of people was certainly influenced by the Trika system of this work. I have gone into this matter in some detail because it is exemplary of a general principle, namely that most, if not all, Tantric systems are built up at their origins by initiates of other systems. As initiates they would have a firm belief in the power of the most important mantras of those other systems and will therefore naturally tend to incorporate them into the new system they are building. Mantras and seed sylla­bles have power in themselves. They enjoy the independent exist­ence and identity of deities along with their attributes and limbs which, indeed, they are said to be. The incorporation of mantras into a sys­tem is thus equivalent to the incorporation of iconic forms. Similarly, the permutations of single mantras are equivalent to the permuta­tions of their corresponding iconic forms. No Tantric system discovered to date is without similar pre­cedents. The Saivasiddhanta incorporates in a modified form the Pasupata iconography and mantras of five-faced Sadasiva as a cen­tral part of its most original core.71 Cults expounded in the Bhairava Tantras similarly draw from the Siddhanta, maintaining, in varying degrees, a connection with it. A clear example of this is the cult of Svacchandabhairava which, although a Bhairava cult, is very close to those of Sadasiva in the Siddhantagamas and contains elements of Pasupata Saivism. 72 It appears that these layers in the formation of 71 See Bhatt 1961: 22ff. concerning the mantras of SadliSiva 's five faces. 72 Arraj has examined the history and structure of the Svacchandatantra, the root text of the Svacchandabhairava cult, at length in his doctoral disserta­tion (see bibliography). He discerns various strata in the history of the Svacchandatantra. These are: 1) Srauta and smtirta precepts and practice; 2) Rudra: Specifically, part of the Satarudriya has provided the Bahurilpa fo r­mula of saka/a-Svacchandabhairava, used in the primary rituals throughout the Tantra (Arraj 1988: 31); 3) Vedic meta-ritualist and ascetic speculation. This includes meditation on OM (pra7Java) and interiorized rituals focused on the vital breath; 4) Brahminical sti stras: Arraj sees similarities in the im­plicit theory of language with Bhartrhari. Other sti stras include logic, astrol­ogy and medicine. Their presence is, however, not great; 5) Philosophical schools (darsana): These are, above all, Yoga and Sarilkhya, which have had great influence on the text; 6) Epics and PurlU_las: The influence of the Pur!\\Qas is especially fe lt in the fo rmulation of cosmologies; 7) Vai�Qava Paiicar!\\tra: 236"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"<Jbe Cull of the Qoddess CXubjika the cult were discerned by the Newars in their own way, leading to the esoteric identification of Pasupati with a form of Svacchanda­bhairava. 73 The cults of the Bhairava Tantras included at least two species that were so strongly orientated towards the worship of goddesses that they were more Sakta (according to the later terminology) than Its contribution may have been the modification of Samkhya cosmology through the addition ofMaya in the theistic scheme of emanation; 8) Pasupata: This includes whatArraj has listed separately as 'Rudra'; 9) Saiva: This group Arraj rightly, I believe, identifies with the Saivasiddhiinta. Arraj and Dyczkowski ( l987a: 139 fn. 24) point out that Brunner-Lachaux in her lengthy notes on her translation of the Somasambhupaddhati frequently refers, espe­cially in the section dealing with initiation in part 3, to the Svacchandatantra and compares it at length with the statements of the Siddhantiigamas and their commentators. 73 Newar Kaulas worship Svacchandabhairava independently. But his most important role is as the consort ofKubjika. He appears in this capacity in, fo r example, the important Bhairava fire sacrifice called Bhairavtigniyajfia. In this context he is worshipped as Sikhasvacchandabhairava. In this form he is the consort ofKubjika when she is worshipped along with six goddesses who are her attendants (dutl) and embodiments ofthe six limbs of her mantra. Apart from innumerable references in Newar liturgies, several references to this form of Svacchandabhairava have also been found in inscriptions. I am grateful to Nutan Sarma for pointing this out to me. Even at the initial scriptural level, when the Tantra was compiled, Svacchandabhairava served as an intermedi­ary between the mild Sadasiva ofthe Siddhanta and the fierce Bhairava of the Bhairava Tantras. Subsequently, in the course of the development of his litur­gies amongst the Newars, he became the esoteric identity ofPasupati. In retro­spect one could hazard to say that the identification was already an open pos­sibility in the Svacchandatantra. Arraj notes a number ofPiiSupata influences in the formation of the cult at the scriptural level (Arraj 1988: 40-46). Espe­cially, important, I would say, is the close similarity in the identity of Svacchandabhairava's five faces and those ofPaSupati, on the one hand, and Sadasiva of the Siddhantagamas, on the other. Thus this cult, which is very important for Newar Saktism, bridges the gap between PaSupati and Sadasiva on one side and on the other serves as an intermediary between the Bhairava and the Kaula Tantric cults. The net result is that, as the consort of Guhyakali who is worshipped secretly as an aspect ofKubjika (see above, fn. 40), PaSupati is worshipped secretly as Sikhasvacchandabhairava in conjunction with Kubjika. 237"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"9l fjoumeg In !he CWorld of !he Cfanlra; Saiva. These were the Kiili cults and those centred on the worship of the Three Goddesses. The next step was the move into another class ofTantra and cult. These were the Kula Tantras, which distinguished themselves from all the other types of Tantra by referring to them­selves as Kaula and to the others as Tiintrika collectively. The Kubjika Tantra represents a major point of transition between these two modalities. The dictates of the cult appear in many respects to be in an intermediate and mediating phase between the two. The cult of the goddess Kubjika is, as the Tantras of her cult tirelessly remind us, fully Kaula. Even so, they take care to recall the link with the earlier Bhairava Tantras. The goddess and her tradition is 'established in Siva's sphere' (stimbhavama�:uja/asthti). We are frequently told that the Kubjika cult appears at the end of the Kali age. This appeared to be such an important feature of the Kubjika cult that the KMT named it the Pascimiirnniiya, literally the 'Last (or Final) Tradition' of the Kaula cults. Even so, the initiate is admonished to respect and even worship the 'previous tradition' (purwimnaya). This consisted, col­lectively, of all the earlier Kaula schools. These were believed to be the earliest ones, all of which were derived from Matsyendraniitha and his six disciples. As the system developed after the redaction of the KMT, the name Pascimiirnnaya remained but the word pascima came to be understood as meaning 'western', which is its other com­mon meaning. This was facilitated by the development of the parallel Kiili cult which referred to itself as the Uttariirnniiya -lit. 'Northern Tradition' or 'Higher Tradition'-possibly because it did, in reality, develop in the North oflndia, specifically in Kashmir and the neigh­bouring Himalayas. As the Pascimarnnaya developed it came to in­corporate Kali to increasing, albeit moderate, degrees. 74 However, this element, along with the addition, at a still later period, ofTripura cults/5 does not form a part of the essential core of the system. 74 We have already observed the manner in which the KMT colonized the cult of Guhyakali. Also, see below. / 75 The goddess Kamesvari is known to the KMT. She is said to reside in KlimarOpa where Kubjikli meets her in her colonizing tour of the Indian sub­continent described in chapter 2.

In the rest of this paper I will examine some features of the exchanges, mutual influences, common forms, and specific identi­ties of these cults in relation to one another and individually that characterize these processes at work in the Tantras. The relationship the texts have with their living social, political, anthropological and cultural contexts-what they contribute to them and what they draw there with the same name together with another one called Nila. The goddess delights on both sides of the banks (of these lakes?). Again the goddess (Kubjika), whose limbs are the universe and the principles of existence, sees a goddess there who is \"proud with the pleasure of passion (kama) and burn­ing with the Lord of Love (vasantatilaka). She is melting and melts the three worlds with (her) desire.\" Seeing her the Mother smiles and asks her who she is and how she has come there. She calls her \"passionate one\" and is pleased with her fo r having shown her all these wonderful things. She tells her that she should be called Kamesvari because in this way she has obtained the fruit of the bliss of passion. Out of compassion the form of passion ( kilmaropa) has been fashioned before her and so this great sacred seat (where the goddess Kamesvarl resides) which is called Ktimanlpa will come into existence during the Kali Age. Her consort will be Candrananda. He will be seated on the shoulders of the Wind. Passionate, he will be Kamadeva (KMT 2/82-94). The Tripura cult has incorporated the identification of Kamesvari with the early prototype ofTripura so well that most initiates into the Tripura cult would not be able to distinguish the two. The relative antiquity of the Kubjika cult with repect to that ofTripura is, I believe, well exemplified by the appearance ofKamesvari in this passage with no reference either here or elsewhere to Tripura, her later, developed form. The consistent silence throughout the later Kubjika Tantras becomes strikingly eloquent when we notice the appearance of rituals centred on Tripura, in the form of Tripurabhairavl, in the Yo gakha�uja of the Manthdnabhairavatantra. Tripura appears also in the CMSS, a relatively late Kubjika Tantra, as the goddess of the Southern Tradition (da/cyil)dmntlya) where her identity with Kamesvari is evident (see Dyczkowski l987a: 71). 239"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"9l 8oumey in the CWorld of !he Cfanfras from them - will be examined elsewhere. Suffice it to say that we observe similar, if not the same principles operating in both dimen� sions, namely, the ideal one of the texts and the empirical one of their human contexts. We notice, for example, in both cases an attempt to furnish the cult of each deity with everything that is neccessary to render it complete. Theoretically this should make it independent of all the others. But this is never the case either in the texts themselves or in their application. Indeed, in order to achieve this 'complete­ness' each cult assimilates elements from others. Even its most 'origi­nal' specific and specifying core is itself as much a product of a long historical process as is the uniqueness of its moment of creation. But this is not felt to be an opressive contingency; rather this continuity with the past is considered to be a mark of authenticity and authority. Concretely, in the case of the goddess Kubjika, we observe that in some respects she has peculiar characteristics and traits which are virtually unique to her, while in others, she embodies many of the common characteristics of all the great goddesses of Hinduism. It is above all this fact, more even than the extent ofher scriptural sources, which qualifies Kubjika to be considered a great goddess - a Mahadevi - despite her extreme obscurity to the rest of Hinduism or, indeed, Hindu Tantrism in India. Thus, like all the great god­desses of Hinduism, of which the popular, Pural).ic goddess Durga is the prime archetype/6 Kubjika incorporates into herself many other 76 Coburn writes concerning the Devlmahatmya, well known as the source of the myth of origin of the goddess Durga: \"Of the various features of the Devlmahtitmya, one stands preeminent. The ultimate reality in the universe is here understood to be feminine: Devl, the goddess. Moreover, the Devlmtihtitmya appears to be the first Sanskrit text to provide a comprehensive - indeed, well-nigh relentless - articula­tion of such a vision. From the time of the IJ_gveda onwards, of course, vari­ous goddesses had figured in the Sanskrit tradition. But never before had ultimate reality itself been understood as Goddess.\" (Coburn 1998: 32) Durga became the Sanskritic representation of many popular, local and regional goddesses throughout India and has served for centuries as the pub­lic fo rm of the secret lineage Kaula goddesses of the Newars and of Kaula goddesses throughout India.

Thus although the Kubjika Tantras do contain myths re­counting the origin of the goddess Kubjika, there is no specific myth in her case which accounts for the process whereby she includes other goddesses into herself as there is for the PuraQic goddess Durga. Even so, we can observe the results of this synthesis in her rituals, mantras, maQQala, and her visualized forms. Accordingly, Kubjika is both a unique goddess and is exemplary in many respects of the other great Kaula Tantric goddesses, especially Tripura and Kali. Moreover, just as Kubjika's external form is unique to herself, despite its composite nature, the same is true of her inner nature, that is, her metaphysical identity. Kubjika, like all the other great god­desses of the Kaula and Bhairava Tantras, is essentially the energy of universal, absolute consciousness (cicchakti) by means of which it does and is all things. Accordingly, Kubjika is said to be both crea­tive and destructive.78 Even so, she is predominantly concerned with emanation (S!$!ipradhtina). Her cult can thus be contrasted with that of Kali, which is predominantly concerned with withdrawal (samharapradhana). Even so, the spheres of manifestation are the domains of both deities. The rituals of both goddesses represent both processes. But Kubjika, in several of her forms, is visualized, like Tripura, as a young 'erotic' goddess (see Dyczkowski: 1996), sym­bolizing her fertile creativity. Kali, on the contrary, is fierce, thus symbolizing the reverse. Even so, both types are essentially concerned with creation, and this is symbolized by their occasional portrayal in sexual union with their male counterparts. 77 For example, in one place the goddess declares: aham sunyasvarape!Ja para divyatanur hy aham II aharh sa ma/inldevl aharh sa siddhayoginll aharh sa ktilikti kticit kulayagesvarl hy aham II aharh sa carciktidevl kubjiktiharh ca !}aqvidha I \"As my nature is the Void, I am the Supreme goddess (Para) and my body is divine.

Kali, on the other hand, sits on top of her partner, who is reduced to such passivity by the fury of her passion that he can be variously portrayed as Siva in some iconic forms or as a corpse (sava) in others. Referring to the earthly counterparts of these divine couples, namely, the Siddha and his Tantric consort, the Yogini, the Tantras distinguish between these two types of coupling by calling them 'pleasing union' (priyameliipa) and 'violent union' (hathamelapa), respectively. The former gener­ates the lineage of accomplished adepts (siddha) and the world of sacred places in which they reside. Like a witch who sucks out the vitality of the unwary male, 79 the latter withdraws the ignorance which normally impels the corpse-like Siva locked in 'r everse intercourse' below to be active and 'on top' 'churning' his energies into a dy­namic active state. The special intensity and fertility ofKubjika, whose name literally means 'Humpback Lady', is further expressed by the transgressive image of the solitary80 goddess bent double in order to lick her own vulva. Thus she makes herself blissful freely and inde­pendently and is so fertile that she can generate the impregnating sperm with which she herself is to generate the universe. 81 79 On the subject of witches - called in various parts oflndia by such names as l)akini, l;>ayan, I;>ajan, Den, Dhakuni, Ce�I and Silini- see Herrmann­Pfandt ( 1996) who explains that \"a husband of a human Oakini has to cope with the danger of being sucked out or being brought to death through cer­tain sickness\" (ibid. p. 49). 8° Kubjika is not usually portrayed in this way as a solitary goddess ( ekavlrtl), although there are prescriptions in the Tantras fo r her worship in this form. In a passage quoted below we find another reason for her bent condition in relation to her union with her consort, in which she is portrayed in her much more common coupled condition (yamalabhtlva). As usual, marriage and conjunction with the god tames the goddess even as it deprives her of her independence. Thus, in that situation, she is not in an uroboric state of self­regeneration but is generated from the god. 81 This aspect is evident in one of her common names, i.e. Sukradevi, which means literally the 'Goddess Sperm'. Similarly, in a verse which is a part of the so-called Sarilvartasutra ($atSS Ill and KuKh Ill), which Newar initiates frequently recite in the course of their rituals to invoke Kubjika (avahana), she 242"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"Cfhe Cull of !he 9oddess CXubjika But although both goddesses are represented in the context of their own special symbolism as independant and, hence, complete in themselves, both processes, which they respectively govern, must go together.

In terms of the psychology of their symbolism only implicitly expressed in the texts, Kali is the radiantly Dark Goddess oflight who is the shadow­like counterpart of the shining light blue 82 Kubjika. Thus they are distinguished, even as they are integrated, both by the discerning consciousness of the renouncer yogi and by the power of the sym­bolism ofthe householder's ritual action.

Even so the connection between the two goddesses is clearly established from the beginning of the Tantra. The god Himavat has just praised the god Bhairava who has C<?me to visit him in the hermitage in the Himala­yas. Bhairava is pleased with Himavat's devotion and offers him five boons. In response to these favours, Himavat offers Bhairava his daughter whom he introduces as the young virgin (kumarilai) Kalika. We come to know that she was Uma in a previous life and that she is ultimately Kubjika. In the later Manthtinabhairavatantra she is called Bhadrakalika. If the Newar Kaula ini­tiates ofBhaktapur in the Kathmandu Valley were to study this Tantra they would certainly see in this textual identification a sign that Bhadrakali, whom the citizens venerate as the founder of their town, is secretly Kubjika.

The Tantra describes the origin of the goddess Kubjika as an em­bodiment of the creative desire (iccha) of the god Bhairava. Note how, even though she is the main deity, she is said to be the god's attendant as would befit a pious Hindu wife. But even so, the uni­verse is generated from them by means of a union that is necessarily incestuous: 88 \"The will, inherent in the essential nature of the transcendent, imperceptible, supreme and supremely blissful Lord, shone forth (babhau). God, aroused by his own will, fashioned a supreme body (vapu) (for himself). That (body) possessed every limb and was en­dowed with the previously (stated) attributes (of deity). Shining like billions of moons, it (was) an immense and marvellous mass of en­ergy. The great lord, the venerable Kubjesa, accompanied by the en­compassing attendants (avaraJJa) of the Srikrama (the tradition of the goddess Kubjika), sat on the seat of the Wheel of Knowledge, adorned with the garland ofPrinciples ofExistence (tattva). The Lord of the gods, whose nature is beyond conception comtemplated his own imperishable, and sacred (bhavita) nature, (the Self) of the ven­erable Wheel of Bliss. \"Free of objectivity and residing in his own foundation (adhara), (he contemplated himself) in order to fashion the wheel called (the Wheel of) Bliss.

Then, the benefactor of the uni­verse, for the benefit of(his) attendants (praticaraka), conceived the thought which is supreme NirvaQ.a, namely: 'Who is our attendant?' 88 Compare this relationship with the one Kali -the goddess of Time- has with her consort, Bhairava Mahiikala (the Great Time). Bhairava represents the vital breath (prti1Ja). Its movement impels the motion of the mind and, with it, the flux of time. Kali is the divine consciousness who, intent on consuming the energies of manifestation that arise out of her own nature, absorbs the vital breath and with it time into her eternal nature (MP p. 7). Thus, far from being the god's pious bashful attendant, she devours him!

Kubjikii is Ku!Jc.ialini bent over in the form of a sleeping snake coiled in the first of these Wheels called muladhara-the Root Foundation. In this case, the energy within the body ofKujesa is not in this Wheel, which is located in the base of the geni­tals, but in the second Wheel along, namely Svadhi$thana - the Wheel of the Self-Supported. In this context, the collocation of this energy here is appropriate. The Wheel of the Self-Supported is the place where the erect penis makes contact with the cervix at the base of the womb during sexual intercourse. Thus this Wheel is the centre of the first point of contact in the union of Siva and Sakti from which the emission ( visarga) that generates the universe originates. But although this makes sense, even so, given the prestige of the Six Wheel system in the Kubjikii Tantras, which is at the very core of the cult, one wonders at the anomalous role of this Wheel here. Is it a hangover from an earlier formulation of the Six Wheels when there were only five? 90 The Tantra appears to imply that Kubjika, as Mahiimiiyii, should be identi­fied with Durgii, the foremost public representation of the Great Goddess. Newar initiates into Kubjikii's cult stress how Kubjikii is preeminent amongst all the great goddesses of Newar Siiktism because she is Mahiimiiyii in a more direct, original sense than the other goddesses, even though they are also all identified with Durgii (as Mahi�iisuramardini- the Slayer of the Buffalo Demon), who acts as their public exoteric form. 246"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"Cfhe Cull of !he Qoddess CXubjika ence) and, residing in the twenty-five principles of existence,91 the Supreme Goddess was beautiful. \"Energized by the (mantras called the) Five Jewels, enveloped by the seven bodily constituents (dhatu ), her nature the wine (sudha) (that inebriates her consort) and divine, she is coloured with the colour of the principles of existence (tattva).

The Kubjika Tantras occasionally identify the goddess with Nature (prakrti), which is an identification found in the Pural)as and in the later Sak:ta Tantras. When this identification is made, Siva figures as the Person (puru$a), who is not just the individual soul of the Siirilkhya who goes by the same name, but the divine male counterpart of the goddess. The number of principles in such cases is then usually about twenty-five to twenty-eight, varying in detail according to the particular text and its cult.

She then flows down from it into the spheres of her emanations, while she continues to reside within it.

But her special domain is, as her very name suggests, time (ktlla). Abhinavagupta explains in his Ta ntra/oka: \"Again, time (can be experienced) both as a succession (krama of mo­ments) as well (as eternal time) free of succession. Both aspects abide en­tirely within consciousness. Thus scripture affirms that Kali (the Goddess of Time) is the Lord's supreme power. It is that same power which, by its spon­taneous development (praroha), manifests outside consciousness the suc­cession and its absence, encompassed within its own nature, and so abides as the (life-giving) activity of the vital breath (pral)avrtti). Consciousness alone, very pure and of the nature of light, severing objec­tivity from itself, manifests as the sky void of all things. That is said to be the voidness of consciousness and is the supreme state yo gins attain by reflect­ing on objectivized manifestation with an attitude of negation (neti neti). This same void Self(khatman) is called the vital breath, the throb (spanda) and wave (urmi) of consciousness. By virtue of its inherent inner outpouring (samuccha/atva), it falls upon the objectivity (which it) separated from (it­self) with the intention of taking possession of it.\" (TA 6/6-11) The identification of the goddess with the energy of the Transmental (unman f) is also not unique to the Kubjika Tantras. The Agamas (i.e. Tantras) of the Saivasiddhanta regularly prescribe the worship of Siva's consort as the power of the Transmental. As in the Kubjika Tantras, Siva's consort in such Tantric texts is also understood to be the intermediary between the spheres of emanation, which are within the purview of the mind, and the transcend­ent above them; beyond mind.

The goddess, who is the power of bliss (anandasakti), is accordingly called Napurilsaka ­the Female Eunuch. To the best of my knowledge this name is exclusive to the goddess Kubjika.

Through this energy the world is created, and through it one attains the authority (adhikara) to perform Tantric and Kaula rituals, initiate others and ultimately lead them to the same realization. 102 The Ta ntra of the Churning Bhairava (Manthanabhairavtantra) tells us: \"In the centre (of the mal).l;iala) is the Place of Repose; it is the expansion (of emanation -prasara) and the experience (of ultimate reality), the understanding of which is one's own (spiritual) authority.\"103 representing this association by the respective colours of their three god­desses, who are the black Guhyakali, the red Kamesvari, and Siddhil�mi who is white. Two pictures of this triad can be viewed in the museum in Bhaktapur. Note the conspicuous absence of Kubjika in this triad. This is because she is identified with Mahilmaya, which is Nature (prakrti), their original source. Thus she is present there, in a sense, as all three. Or, to put it another way, she is their basic absolute and hence unmanifest, secret identity. 101 ya sa sa ktir bhagakhyata sa mbhor utsangagamini I kaulini brahmacaryer.za srim an devi napumsaka II \"The energy called the Vulva (bhaga ) who sits on Sambhu's lap is, by virtue of (her) continence, Kaulini, the venerable goddess Neuter (napurilsaka).

The expression 'srlman devi napurilsaka 'combines an irregular masculine form of address ( 'sriman ') and, as we have already noted, the peculiar transformation of a neuter noun into a feminine adjectival name (napurilsaka), both with reference to the goddess, to represent her multivalent nature. Other cases of deviant Sanskrit have not, and will not, be noted here. 102 This interesting and original concept, reminiscent in some ways of the Tantric Buddhist conception of Bodhicitta, 'Mind of Enlightenment', is dealt with extensively solely in the Kubjika Tantras. All beings whatever their status, gods, men or demons, have spiritual authority because they have re­ceived the Command (ajiia) of the goddess Kubjika. This Command permits them to exert this authority within their jurisdiction. This doctrine may well have served to justify the configuration of Newar Kaula Tantrism around this goddess in the radical manner in which it is at present. 103 madhye visramabhum{ril prasaram anubhavaril pratyayaril svadhikaram II (KuKh l/3c) 252"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"Cfbe Cull of the Qoddess CXubjika This same energy is also in the centre of the body, that is, be­tween the two vital breaths of inhalation and exhalation.

This mal).c,iala is primarily the triangle of the Yoni. This is why the goddess is called Vakra - Crooked. We have seen that this basic triangular form has four components located at the three corners and the centre. These are the four primary seats (plfha) of the goddess. The goddess is the entire economy of energies. But she is not just the sum of all energies, she is also every one of them individually. They are deployed in sa­cred space, and indeed the energies are the sacred places themselves. The Kubjika cult is called the Transmission of the Mother (avvakrama) and also Srtkrama.

These are common, non­technical uses of the word. In a technical sense, 'krama' denotes a Kaula liturgy, consisting as it does of a sequence of actions and reci­tations of mantras. Unlike the Srikrarna, the Klilikrama includes within the sequence of the rite of adoration (pujakr ama) the sequences of emanation, persistence, withdrawal and the inexplicable (anakhya). The Miidhavakula section of the Jayadrathayamala, to which Abhinavagupta refers in his treatment of Kaula ritual, declares that: \"(According to this practice), in order to attain both worldly en­joyment (bhoga) and liberation, one must worship the tetrad of ema­nation, persistence, withdrawal and the inexplicable together with the sacred seats and the burning grounds.\" 106 The four moments of emanation, persistence, withdrawal and the inexplicable are worshipped as separate configurations of god­desses. In some versions of the Kalikrama a fifth moment is added. This is called 'Manifestation' - Bhasa- and consists of the 'shin­ing' (bhasa) of all four moments together. Although the Kalikrama is particularly sophisticated in its presentation of these moments in the cycle, it is not the only cult that does so. The cult ofSrividya, like the Saivasiddhanta, and indeed most elaborate Tantric ritual, repli­cates through ritual action the cyclic creation and destruction of the universe.107 It is particularly well represented in the ritual program of the Kalikrama. Indeed, in the Klllikrama they are considered to be fundamental aspects of the goddess herself: \"(Oh Umll), unfolding awareness of creation, persistence and destruction!

This is the transcendental, pure dynamic consciousness (samvit) that generates, sustains and with­draws the three states. 109 A major characteristic of the Kalikrama, this notion is absent in the basic form of the Kubjika cult. Even though Kubjika is frequently called the Nameless, she is not described as the fourth inexplicable consciousness which encompasses the triad of creation, persistence and destruction, as happens in the Kalikrama. Let us examine some sample texts in order to observe the difference this identification makes. In the following passages Kubjika is called the Nameless (Anama or Anakhyii) and she is identified with the energy of consciousness called Transmental (Unmana): \"There, at the end of the mind, there is nothing else except the (energy) which is beyond the mind (manonmani). (And so), she is called the Transmental (unmana), the supreme (energy), who trans­ports the nectar (of immortality).\" 110 Again: \"Above that is the Trans mental (unmana) state; that state ( corre­sponds to the) Sambhava (principle). (One attains it) once one has practised (immersion in) the one Void where everything comes to an end. And once the Transmental at the end of the Void has been reached, 109 The Jayadrathayamala is a very important work for many reasons. One of these is the relatively frequent reference to the phenomenology of the dynamic energy of consciousness which in this text is termed samvit. This term is rare in other non-Buddhist Tantras despite the fact that it is the basic term used for consciousness by Kashmiri Saivites. Even more striking, when compared with other Hindu Tantras of this period (i.e. prior to the develop­ment ofKashmiri Saivism), is its surprisingly sophisticated idealism which identifies subject and object through the act of perception. Although the Mahakiilasamhita is a Kali Tantra which postdates the Jayadrathayamala and makes extensive use of this fourfold division of creation, persistence, destruction and a fourth state beyond them as well as the firefold one with 'manifestation' added to the four, it is devoid of the earlier idealism due to its exclusive focus on external ritual. The paradigm is so basic, whether inter­nalized or not, that it is not surprising to discover that the Newar Ka!I rites are similarly dominated by this divisions. 110 nanyam tatra bhavet kiiicin manasante manonmani I unmana sa samakhyata para hy amrtawihini II ( KuKh 15113) 255"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"9l fjourney in !he CWorld of !he %nlras who is it that is not freed from bondage?\" 111 \"Emanation (sr�ti) (generated) from the sequence (krama) abides alone in the Yoni, facing downwards. (This energy is) the Transmental (manonmani), the essential Being (of all things-sadbhiivii) and the great wave (of the energy of consciousness) whose form is Light.\" 112 Kubjika is the energy 'beyond mind' which leads to the pure transcendent Being of her consort. She is the Inexplicable (Anakhya), Without Name (Anama), not, primarily, because she is the semper eternum of God's Being which encompasses past, present and future in its inexplicable simultaneity - although she is also this - but, above all, because she is, literally, beyond the mind. She is the final stage at the end of a vertical ascent through the expanse of immanence, at the extremity closest to transcendence. Again, the location of the multiple energies of the goddess is not only represented by the goddess's sacred seats. It also refers to the placement of the letters of the alphabet within a diagram called a prastiira. The letters of a mantra are extracted from this diagram. This is done by indicating the position of each letter in relation to other letters next to it. This process is the microcosmic parallel of creating the universe part by part from the phonemic energies that constitute the universal energy of the goddess. Thus, Kubjika, like other Kaula goddesses, is an embodiment of Speech. As such, she is both every single phonemic energy and so is the one 'Letter' (var�ii), and is also transcendent and so is called 'Devoid of Letter' (avar�ii): \"Vidya, the auspicious power (sakti), residing in letter and that devoid of letter, is of two types.

This takes place by a process the KubjikA Tantras and the Kalikrama call 'churning'. This is the process of emanation marked by the emergence of the individual energies or aspects (kala) of Kula, the universal energy with which Kubjika is identified.116 The Kubjika Tantra of the Churn­ing Bhairava (Manthanabhairavatantra) explains: 114 e$1i sa devata devataya khyata maya prabho I guhairamad vini$krtinta asvara svaravahinlll (KuKh 17 /24) mAn interesting feature of this temple is that it is not the temple of the great Sanskritic tradition, but the archaic tree shrine of popular local folk tradition. Thus, in places, the texts apparently identify Kubjikli with a local goddess who lived in a tree or a stone underneath it. Accordingly, her Circle (mar:zqala) is the Circle of the Tree. The original circle being the shade of the tree of which the tree, and hence the stone, was the centre.

In the ftnal section of this essay, I deal with the goddess's association with trees and vegetation. 116 The Kumtlrikli section of the Manthanabhairavatantra defines the nature of this activity as fo llows: \"(The act of) churning is said to be emanation itself, which is the arising of the aspects of the (energy of) Kula (manthanam Sf$ fir evoktam kaulikam kalasambhavam )II (KuKh 17 /35cd).

And that is Harhsa (the Gander), the Great Soul which is the nectar generated from the (primordial) fire. These two are called Siva and Sakti. The triple universe is woven warp and woof (with them). This is the secret called the 'Great Churning' (mahamanthana).\" 117 The womb of energies, the Yoni, is, by a symbolically significant reversal and conjunction of polarities, known as the 'Yonilinga' (vulva­phallus) which is said to be 'ch urned from above'. The inner, unrnanifest power is aroused by its own spontaneous inspiration. The upper part is the male principle-the Linga (phallus)- the lower part the female - the Yoni (vulva). The drop of the vital seed which is generated thereby is the empowering Command (apia), which is both the source of the universe and the means to attain the supreme state: \"The divine Linga, churned from above, is divided into six parts (prakiira).

The same passage is also quoted by K$emaraja in his commentary, the Sp andaniriJaya (p. 6), on the Sp andakiirikti. The passage explains that the god of the Kaiikrama is called Manthanabhairava, lit. the Churning Bhairava, because \"he engen­ders the creation etc. of all things (by arousing) and churning his own power\".

This figure, seen very commonly in and around Newar tem­ples and houses symbolizes the union of opposites represented by these divine, all-embracing polarities. Union takes place between the triangles, at the comers and in the centre, which is marked by a dot, representing the fe cund fusion of the vital seed of the couple. Kashrniri Saiva texts explain that this figure also represents the sexual union of the divinized human couple engaged in a special type ofKaula ritual. 121 the tradition, the deities of all six must be worshipped. Thus the initiation Newars receive not only initiates them into the worship of their own lineage deity but also into the worship of all of the others. The lineage goddess is not wor­shipped exclusively; but she is given pride of place. Moreover, whoever one's own lineage deity may be, the maJ:l<fala in which the deities of the six lineages are worshipped is enclosed by Kubjika's mantra (see below). Thus Kubjikii, in the form of her mantra, encompasses them all and thereby energizes them. The contents ofthe six traditions are the ones prescribed by the Partitantra. In 1947 a series of articles written by the Nepalese major-general Dhana Samser Jailgabahiidur Ral,lii came out in the Hindi magazine Car:u;li. In these articles the author expounds the pantheon and related matters of these six traditions on the basis of the Partitantra and other texts considered authori­tative by Newar Siiktas. Note that the Partitantra (chapter six) prescribes the worship ofVaj rayogini as the deity ofthe Lower Tradition, stating that this is the tradition of the Buddhists. Newar Kaulas have replaced her with Hata­kesvari who, along with her consort Hiitakdvara, governs the hell worlds. This change is in consonance with the expurgation by Newar Kaulas of Bud­dhist influences in their rites. 121 Referring to the symbolism of the formation of the letter AI, Abhinavagupta says that the letter E is represented by the triangle of the goddess's Vulva, which is \"beautiful with the fragrance of emission\" (visargtimodasundaram - TA 3/95a). Then: \"When the powers of the absolute (the letter A) and bliss (the letter A) become firmly established there (in the triangle, which is the letter E), it assumes the condition of the six-spoked (mar:u;lalasa{lavasthiti, i.e. AI) brought about by the union of two triangles.\" {TA 3/95b-6a). Jayaratha comments that \"in the process of the practice of ritual sex (carytikrama) the condition corresponding to the Gesture of the Six Spokes (sar;laramudrti) arises by the encapsulation of the two triangles, (one being that of the) male 260"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"Cfhe Cull of !he Qoddess CXubjika Newar initiates are also aware of this symbolism and openly accept it.

So the reader must be con­tent, as I have to be, to wonder. Just as this six-sided figure represents the six lineages, it is also commonly found in the maQ<;iala of the lineage goddesses, techni­cally called the Kramamar.ujala. This is the case with the Krama­mQl:ujala of the Western Tradition (pascimti.mnti.ya), which the Kubjika Tantras describe as \"the city of the illumined intellect (dhr) \"122 be­cause it is the embodiment of the teachings of the lineage (krama) of teachers who transmit the tradition (krama) and because its constitu­ent elements, represented by mantras, are worshipped in a fixed se­quence (krama) which constitutes the liturgy -Krama. There are twenty-eight such constituents and so the rite of adoration (pujakrama) of this maQ<;iala is called the Sequence ofTwenty-Eight (a${avirnsati­krama). These twenty-eight constituents are represented by mantras arranged in six groups consisting of four, five, six, four, five, and four parts, respectively. They are projected onto the comers of the six-sided figure. According to one interpretation (see KuKh 2/8), they are as follows: 1) The Group of Four: the intellect along with the energies of will, knowledge and action. 2) The Group of Five: the five types of sensation, namely sound, form, taste, smell, and touch. adept (siddha) and nhe other that of the) yogini.\" The sides of these trian­gles are formed from the three channels of the vital breath (irja, pifzgalti and SU$Umnti) that come together in the genital region of each of the two partners engaged in this rite. The vital breath is impelled along these three channels by the energies of will, knowledge and action. When these extroverted ener­gies are experienced in conjunction with the inner energies of the absolute and its bliss, as happens for a moment, at least, in sexual intercourse, the three energies and corresponding vital breaths of the partners work together to generate the emission ( visarga) through which the fecund seed of the cou­ple is projected with force through the centre. 122 yad etat kaulikamjfianaril kramamar;rjaladhipuram \\ (KuKh 5/lab) 261"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"5Zl 8o urney in !he CWorld of !he Cfan!ras 3) The Group of Six: the five senses, namely the ear, eye, tongue, nose and skin, and the mind. 4) The Group of Four: the four states, namely waking, dream­ing, deep sleep and the Fourth. 5) The Group of Five: the group of five gross elements-water, fire, earth, wind and space. 6) The Group ofF our: the three qualities ofNature, namely sattva, rajas and tamas, along with Siva, their master. According to contemporary Newar ritual procedure, the two su­perimposed triangles are surrounded by an eight-petalled lotus. Eight mother goddesses (matrka) are worshipped on the petals. They guard the directions and the divine couple in the centre. Outside this eight­petalled lotus is a sixteen-petalled lotus. The deities worshipped here are the eight mother goddesses again, but this time along with their consorts, the eight Bhairavas, who are worshipped next to them.

The components of the mas:H,iala are worshipped systematically, part by part, each with its own group of mantras. The deployment of energies in space is thus parallel to their deployment in time. Both of these are held together by their sequence (krama) in time and space.124 There are three such sequences. They are the Sequences of the Child, the Youth (also called the Middle One) and the Eldest. They are also called.the Sequences of the Individual Soul (a�ava), Energy (sakta) and Siva (sambhava).125 Kubjika is the goddess of these sequences (kramadevi), and she manifests as and through them in the form of their mantras. This identity is acted out symbolically by the worship 124 Abhinavagupta explains in his brilliantly profound manner: \"The extending process of diversification and development (katana) along the path (of the cosmic order) takes place in two ways, namely in a sequen­tial and in a non-successive manner. Succession (krama) and its absence essentially amount to (the two ways in which forms are manifest) in the field of phenomenal existence. Thus this can take place either through the differ­entiated development of single units ( ekakalanti, as happens, for example, in making the transition from cause to effect) or (simultaneously of a number of units, as happens when viewing) a picture.\" (TA 6/6) We may note in passing that Abhinavagupta is indebted for these con­cepts not to any Tantric tradition but to Bhartrhari, the philosopher of gram­mar, for this important exegesis of the Kaula term krama (meaning literally 'sequence' or 'succession'). 12s Nobody who has studied the Trika Tantrism elaborated by Abhinavagupta can fail to notice that these three sequences bear the names of the three major categories into which Abhinavagupta, inspired by his Trika teacher Sambhunlitha, has classified practice both ritual and yogic (which one could say is roughly equivalent, as Abhinavagupta presents it, to what may be called mysticism). It appears that these terms were originally used in the Tantras to denote phases in the liturgies of some of the rituals they taught, as is the case with the Kubjikli Tantras. Once again one is struck by the extensive use Abhinavagupta has made of the language of ritual to talk about mysticism, that is, experience of the sacred, and to formulate philosophical and theo­logical concepts. Indeed, he is so adept at speaking the language of ritual for such purposes that one is apt to forget that a work such as the Ta ntraloka is, despite its extremely rich philosophy and mystical soteriology, structured in the form of a liturgical work (paddhatz).

We are told by Jayaratha, the commen­tator on the Ta ntrtiloka, that the rituals and practices in the Ta ntrtiloka belong to these two types, namely Tantric ritual and Kaula ritual. The former is cen­tred on the god, Bhairava or Siva, and the latter on the goddess or goddesses. 126 All the major Kaula goddesses are identified with Ku1;1<;ialini. The goddess Kubjika differs from other Kaula goddesses in that she is not KuQ<;ialini merely by ascription. Much of her mythology, iconography and ritual is moulded primarily around her personage, metaphysical identity and activity as KUJ;�<;ialini.

Each 'wheel generates and sustains one or more of the components of the body, the flesh, fat, bone, marrow and so on. Each of these components is governed by one of Kubjika's attend­ants who are the mistresses (nayika) of each wheeL Called yoginis, these are demonic goddesses or witches who can be invoked to per­form magic rites.

A separate Vidya 128 and maJ;l<;lala (also called yantra) is prescribed for each one. Even so, they are all linked to one of the three varieties of Kubjika's thirty-two-syllabled mantra known as Vajrakubji. In this way, a link is maintained with the supreme goddess who is identified with KuJ;l<;lalini as the energy of the vital breath and speech. iconic form and nature. Moreover, as Sanderson (1988: 687) points out: \"The system of six power-centres (cakras) is also characteristic of the yogic ritu­als of the Kubjiktimatatantra. Later it became so universal, being dissemi­nated as part of the system of kw:u;ialinfyoga beyond the boundaries of the Tantric cults, that it has been forgotten in India (and not noticed outside it) that it is quite absent in all the Tantric traditions except this one and the cult of the goddess Tripurasundari.\" It appears, moreover, that the cult ofTripurii borrowed this from that ofKubjika. Evidence for this is the addition in the Tripurii cult of what are clearly three extra subsidiary centres to make nine. This is because the mal}qala ofTripurii is made of nine enclosures (avara�a). Kubjika's mal}(,iala, as we have seen, is made of six parts (praktira) to which the six centres correspond without need of accommodation. 127 nigrahanugrahe sa ktir bhavate tava niscayam 1 martyaloke vrajitva tu kuru krit;lam yathecchaya II \"It is sure that yours is the power to assist (anugraha) and to obstruct (nigraha).

The temporal sequence (krama) in this case is the lineage of the transmission. This is the goddess's family (kula, anvaya, santati) which belongs to her clan (gotra) and house (grha).129 Thus the residence, place of initiation and preaching of the teachers in the goddess's family should all be recollected along with each teacher. The goddess gives rise in this way to the sequence which is her exter­nal manifest form. The sequence (krama) of the rite and the sequence of the lineage would not be complete without it. Accordingly, the texts prescribe that the MaQQala of the Teachers (guruma�Jcfala) should be drawn along with the Mal)Qala ofSarhvarta (that is, the kramama�Jrfala of this school described above), but worshipped before it. Accordingly, Newar Kaulas worship the teachers of their lineage along with the legendary founders of the cult of their lineage goddess in a maQQala that is drawn specially for this purpose as part of the preliminaries of the more elaborate rites of adoration (kramarcana)Y0 129 This is a common analogy found in various forms and more or Jess empha­sized in all Tantric traditions. Indeed it reaches back into Vedic times. The anal­ogy became concrete fact in the not uncommon case of the Brahmin father who acted as the tutor and spiritual preceptor of his son. In this context, the Brhada­rar;yakopani$ad envisages the transfer of spiritual knowledge literally as a trans­fer of vital force from father to son at the moment of the father's death: \"When a father thinks that he is going to die, he says to his son, \"You are Brahman, you are the sacrifice, you are the world.\"[ ... ] When a father who knows this leaves this world, he penetrates his son together with speech, the mind and the vital force. [ ... ] The father remains in this world through the son alone. The divine and immortal organ of speech, mind and vital force pervade him.\" (1/5/17; English translation drawn from Th e Brhadtirar;yaka Up ani$ad, Mylapore: Sri Ramakrishna Math, 1979). Finding support from such traditions in the Brahminical worldview, the Newars have understood the Tantric analogy between a spiritual lineage and familial one literally. 130 Vajriicaryas, the Newar Buddhist Tantric priests, do the same. Locke in­forms us that: \"The Guru MaiJ<;iala rite is a ritual performed at the beginning of every pujti performed by a Vaj racarya. The mar;¢ala in question is the Mt. Meru mar;¢ala which is offered to the gurus i.e. the Buddha, the Dharma.

'The Fire from the Mare's [Mouth]'). According to the PuraQas, this fire burns at the bottom of the ocean. The water it causes to evaporate falls as life-giving rain.

The angered god was sorely offended and, much angered, destroyed the sacrifice. Thus to Dak�a accrued the demerit of failing to complete it. A Kubjika Tantra goes on to add its own slant to the story: \"When the goddess came to know of what had occurred, (she said): 'My father Dak�a's sacrifice has been destroyed by me be­cause (its destruction was) due to me.

The moon alternates progressively between light and darkness. It both bestows and withdraws its light. Similarly the lunar goddess shines darkly as it were. Kiili, who as her name tells us with its double meaning, is both Lady Time and the Black Lady, is in apparently paradoxical manner described as radiant light (bhasa). Kubjika also possesses these two aspects. In her case however, al­though she is also sometimes said to be dark blue (syama) or dark blue and red (syamarw:za), her brightness,_ rather than darkness, is more frequently emphasized in the forms, myths and sacred geogra­phy associated with her. Thus, for example, she is said to reside on the Island of the Moon in the form of a lunar stone in the centre of the island symbolizing the lunar drop (bindu). Her lunar whiteness is associated with the fertilizing sperm. Her lunar power and ambigu­ously plural sexual nature combine, and so she is called Sukrii -Female Sperm. She lives on the triple peak of the Mountain of the Moon which is identified with Meru, the mountain at the centre of the world. Her abode is the City of the Moon and her house is the House of the Moon, where perfected yogis and yoginis reside.

One must be born from it, sustained by it, and ultimately merge into it. The 'process' (krama) in this case is the sequence ofthe phases of the inner moon. As Eliade (1974: 155) notes: \"The sun is always the same, always itself, never in any sense 'becoming'. The moon, on the other hand, is a body which waxes, wanes and disappears, a body whose existence is subject to the uni­versal law ofbecoming, of birth and death.

In this context, Kubjika, the energy of consciousness (citkala), has two aspects. One is the energy of plenitude- the Full Moon (pim:za).

The light turns to darkness and the darkness turns to light as Kubjika reveals her dark aspect and Kali reveals her radiance. This cosmic cycle is repeated in the movement of the breath. When it takes place mindfully, in the manner about to be described, breathing becomes the epitome of time. Its ceaseless recurrence, which is lif e itself, mirrors within the creation and destruction of the world, repli­cating thus internally the fire sacrifice (the performance of which is coordinated with the phases of the moon) through which the world is created and which marks its end. Accordingly, the Kubjika Tantras, mindful of the importance of this process, teach several versions of it, one of which should be visualized in the following manner. The first stage engages the en­ergy of the New Moon. It is the dark phase of progressive merger. The adept should sit and direct his attention down to the genital cen­tre where he should visualize the rotating Wheel of Birth (janmacakra). In the middle of that moving wheel, the Wheel of the Drop rotates in an anticlockwise direction, the reverse of the original pure condition. Within that is the supreme energy of consciousness, Kubjika, the Transmental (manonmanl}. By contracting the anus, in­haling and then retaining the breath, this energy is raised up with, and through, the flow of vitality that travels up the central channel of vitality in the body called Su�urnna. 147 Like a whirling wheel of fire, it enters first the navel and then the heart. Its movement beyond this station of expansion marks its progressive depletion as it assumes increasingly subtle forms of sound (nada). Finally at the climax of It is worth noting that Abhinavagupta in his extensive survey ofthe Tantras refers only to the energy of the new moon as the source of the other lunar energies. Perhaps the symbolic combination the two, namely, the emptiness of the new moon and the plenitude of the full moon is a connection that is made only in the Kubjika Tantras. It is certainly not common, even though the symbolism of the energy of the New Moon (amtikalti) is well known to many Tantric traditions and both new moon and full moon are usually con­sidered to be particularly important times in Indian liturgical calendars. 147 In the Upani�ads this upward movement is described as one ofthe ways in which the vital breath can exit the body when a person dies. It is the best way, the only one which leads to immortality. The others lead to various forms of rebirth.

Just as the energy of the New Moon was elevated from below, this energy is 'elevated' from above.

One of these passes up to the crown of the head. Going up by it, one goes to immortality. The others are for departing in various directions.\" (8/6/6. This same stanza recurs in Kafhopani$ad 6/!6. See also Ta itterlyo­pani$ad 116 and Prasnopani$ad 3/7.) Su�urnna is mentioned by name, perhaps for the first time, in the fo llowing interesting passage in the Maitryupar.zi$ad. This is one of the earliest refer­ences to the Yogic process ofleading the breath upwards through this channel: \"Now it has elsewhere been said: 'There is a channel called the Sushumna, leading upwards conveying the breath, piercing through the palate. Through it, by joining (yty) the breath, the syllable OM, and the mind, one may go aloft. By causing the tip of the tongue to turn back against the palate and by binding together (samyojya) the senses, one may, as greatness, perceive great­ness.' Thence he goes to selflessness. Because of selflessness, one becomes a non-experiencer of pleasure and pain; he obtains the absolute unity (kevalatva). For thus it has been said: After having first caused to stand still The breath that has been retained, then, Having crossed beyond the limited, with the unlimited One may at last have union in the head.\" (Maitryupar.zi$ad 6121. Both these passages are Hume's translations.) According to later descriptions of this process, the breath rises, taking the heat of the body up along with it (as happens when a person dies), in such a way that the central channel feels warm. Thus, su,�mii - lit. She Who Is Pleasingly Warm- the alternative name for this channel, occasionally found in the early Kaula Tantras, gives us a clue to the meaning of the word SU$Ummi as perceived by Kaula Tantrics. 276"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"Cfbe Cull of !he Qoddess CXuhji ka \"(The adept) should contemplate that croo�ed energy.

As I have not had access to the liturgy that prescribes this deposition, I cannot supply precise details at present. Even so, it is clear that such elevated and internal practices are virtually the ex­clusive domain of only the most privileged Newar Brahmins. The reason these Brahmins advance for this is that they alone have access to the most powerful divine forms and rituals, and so need to prepare and protect themselves in additional ways not necessary for the aver­age initiate for whom the usual, more external, ritual procedures are sufficient. But to an outside observer the feeling is irresistible that here we have yet another example of how these Brahmins have at­tempted to safeguard their spiritual and, hence, worldly prerogatives. Moreover, such manipulations of the original Tantric traditions in their favour along with the uniformly central position given to this one goddess, Kubjika, who is their lineage deity, suggests that it was such people who set up the complex system we find today and that has been operating for several centuries. 149 That major changes were brought about that greatly favoured them cannot be doubted. According to the legends in the Kubjika Tantras, and indeed Tantras of this sort in general, the founding fig­ures were renouncers, not householders. The legends describe them as living a peripatetic lifestyle, wandering from one sacred place to another, and encountering in these 'meeting grounds' (melapasthana) other accomplished adepts (siddha) and yoginis. At times they would interrupt their pilgrimage to live in caves or under trees where, as the Tantras tell us, they would sit with their 'gaze averted upwards' until they were granted a visions of the goddess. This is a far cry indeed from the householder life of the Brahmin guru, his Kshatriya Karmacarya assistants and high-caste initiates!l50 149-0ne of the aims of the present on-going research is to .discover how far back this system has been operating and how it evolved. A more extensive examination of Newar Tantric liturgical works, especially early ones, will hopefully supply us with new data and shed light on the matter. 150 Dumont writes: \"Is it really too adventurous to say that the agent of devel­opment in Indian religion and speculation, the 'creator of values' has been the 278"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"CJbe Cull of !he Qoddess CXubjlka The Tree Goddess The root Tantra of the Kubjika school, the Kubjikamata, does refer to the goddess's assocation with trees, but in the later texts this association is extensively explored. The early Upani�ads had already compared the body of a man to a tree with its root the Brahman.151 Similarly, the maQ<,iala of the goddess is the tree within which she resides and over which she presides in the form of a Yak�iQI, an an­cient India folk deity of vegetation and the earth. The whole tradition and its teachings are represented as the Tree of Consciousness which grows out of the Divine Current (divyogha) of the Divine Kaula tra­dition. This Tree is supreme bliss, its best fruit is the tradition of the Siddhas (siddhaugha) and its branches include the places that are deposited in the body, the aggregate of letters, the Rudras, Siddhas, the various types of sacred places, the divine cave, the Abyss, the Sky, and the Skyfarer (khecara), each of which is divided into mil­lions of aspects.152 This tree is especially represented as a tamarind (ciiica) that grows on the Island of the Moon, the goddess's maQ<,iala, from the middle of the triangle. Thus, in the later Kubjika Tantras, where this imagery is elaborated, the goddess is frequently called the renouncer? The Brahman as a scholar has mainly preserved, aggregated, and combined; he may well have created and developed special branches ofknowl­edge. Not only the founding of sects and their maintenance, but the major ideas, the 'inventions' are due to the renouncer whose unique position gave him a sort of monopoly for putting everything in question.\" (Dumont 1980: 270, 275 quoted by Quigley 1993: 56) 151 The Brhadaraf}yakopani$ad declares: \"As a tree of the fo rest, just so, surely, is man.

There, in the shade of the tree, she transmitted the enlightening Command (ajfia) which gave him the authority (adhikiira) that empowered him both to attain this realization and to transmit the teachings which lead others to it. Another tree closely associated with Kubjika is the kadamba tree. At times it is this tree, rather than the tamarind, that symbolizes the tradition and its growth from the Yoni of the goddess's empower­ing Command.156 At times this tree is the maQ.Qala itself rather than a development of it. To be precise, it is the maQ.Qala that has been em­powered by the Command of the goddess. The goddess thus ferti­lizes herself, as it were, to give birth to the cosmic tree.

Conclusion There are numerous other symbols associated with the goddess Kubjika. They, like the rituals, sacred geographies, mantras, forms of Yoga (especially those linked with the movement of the vital breath) described in her Tantras, are surprisingly rich. The texts have devel­oped in a highly creative period of the history of Tantrism and con­tain numerous traces of its development. All this would be more than enough to warrant extensive research of this goddess. But there j more. The application of precept to practice is in the case of this virtually unknown goddess also surprisingly extensive. To trace its 'ramifications we must seek to understand the whole complex net­work of Newar Tantrism and so, inevitably, a ma jor part of Newar society and its history. This study will reveal, no doubt, how text and �� context penetrate each other, like Siva and Sakti, to form a complete reality, internally ideal and externally concrete. 157 krtva tritayasamyogam lcyipta a) FiantamafJ¢ale II rasmijwiltikadambam ca cintayec ca adhomukham I navalalcyakrte deva trailokyam api sadhayet II \"Once having fo rmed the conjunction of the three (energies) and thrown the Command into the mal).Q.ala, one should think (of it) as the Kadamba (tree) aflame with its rays facing downwards. 0 god, once one has (re­cited the Vidya) 900,000 times, one controls even the three worlds.\" (KuKh l l/22cd- 23) 281"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"9l 8oumey In !he CWorld of !he Cfanlras The Plates Plate on page 3: Kubjika. This painting by Jiianakara Vaj racarya is based on the visu­alized form of the goddess Kubjika described in the Pascimajye­${hamntiyakarmtircanapaddhati. This typical Newar liturgy represents the goddess in a form in which Newar initiates commonly visualize her. I have chosen this source accordingly. There are several vari­ants, especially in the attributes she holds, of the corresponding form described in the Kubjika Tantras. Seven variant visualizations are described in the Manthanabhairavatantra{ikti by Riipa8iva (fol. 9ff. ). Others are fo und in the KuKh 29/33ff. and 49/25cd ff., KnT (fol. lla ff.) and KRU 8/53 ff. In this case she holds in the right hands, from top to bottom, a trident, the mirror of Karma, a vajra, a goad, arrow and flat sacrificial knife. In the corresponding left hands she holds a severed head, ascetic's staff, bell, scriptures, a bow and a skull-bowl. She wears a lion and a tiger skin and a garland of human heads and is surrounded by a circle of stars (ttirtima�;ujala ). The paddhati says that she has a large belly and is bent (kubjarnpa). She is adorned with snakes. These features are empha­sized in several descriptions of this form in the Tantras as well. They indicate that she is the snake goddess, Kul)<;ialini. She is seated on a lotus that grows from Siva's navel who lies prone below her on a throne (simhasana). According to the Kubjika Tantras, the navel is the place where she rests in the form of a coiled snake and from where she rises. The image therefore represents the goddess as Kul)<;ialini emerging from the god as his divine will (icchasakti). Another interesting feature is the yellow colour of the front (purva) face. This is not the usual colour of this face according to the texts. A few learned Newar initiates affectionately refer to Kubjika in Newari as masukva/:z maju-the Yellow-Faced Mother. A large bronze mask representing this goddess is found in a temple close to that of Vajrayogini in the vicinity of Sanku. The Newars associate the yel­low colour of her face with Brahmai)I, the first of the eight Mothers (matrkti). I suppose that this connection explains why the Durga danc­ers of Bhaktapur receive their empowerment from Brahmili)I (alias Kubjika) in a ritual performed at her shrine just after the nine day Durga festival held in autumn. 282"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"<Jbe Cull of !he Qoddess CXubjika Plate 1: Two Siddhilak�mi temples, Bhaktapur.

To her left is Smasanabhairava and on her right Mahakala. Bhaktapur is unique insofar as it boasts three Siddhilak�mi tem­ples, all three of which originally contained stone images of the god­dess. They were built by three successive Malia kings, .who ruled between the middle of the seventeenth century and the first quarter of the eighteenth. This was a period when many of the most beautiful and important temples were built in all three of the cities ofthe Val­ley. The urge to build these temples by the Bhaktapur Mallas indi­cates a need to externalize the cult of their lineage deity to bring her powerful, beneficial presence into the public civic space. This urge was part of an overall resurgence of Tantrism throughout the Valley that is visibly evident by the flowering of the vast complex of iconic forms that adorn the temples of that period. This was also the time when the liturgies of Siddhilak�mi, the goddess Taleju, that still gov­ern the form of her secret rituals nowadays, were redacted by the gurus of the Mallas, the Taleju Rajopadhyaya Brahmins. The first of these temples is in plain red brick with a tiled roof. It was built by Jagatprakasamalla who ruled between 1643 and 1672 and is situated next to the palace. It contained a stone statue of the goddess that is now missing. His son, Jitamitramalla, who reigned between 1673 and 1696, built the second temple. This is situated next to the temple built by his father (see plate 1 ). It is a small, grey­stone, sikhara type of temple decorated with multi-armed images of forms of the goddess Mahi�asuramardini. She is the public represen­tation of all the secret lineage goddesses and, therefore, also of Siddhilak�mi. The image inside the temple is still in place. It is about one metre high and carved in black stone. The third temple is Nyatapola, famous as the tallest temple in the Valley; Bhupatindramalla, the son of Jitamitra, built it during the period of his reign, which lasted from 1696 to 1722. According to a well-known story, BhUpatindramalla had a dream in which he saw 283"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"9l f}oumey in !he CZUorld of !he Cfanlras the Bhairava who resides in the temple in Ta:marhi square on a de­structive rampage. When he awoke, he felt the presence of his line­age goddess who told him to build a temple to her in order to control Bhairava. Bhairava is the god of the lower castes, especially farmers, who made up, and still do, the majority of the population. It is hard to resist the feeling that in actual fact Bhupatindramalla was worried about unrest amongst his subjects whose growing influence was rep­resented in his dream by the increased destructive power of their god. In a culture where magical Tantric action is felt to be more pow­erful than the outer use of force, Bhupatindramalla accordingly built his temple on six high plinths with five pagoda roofs so as to tower above the Bhairava temple to one side of it in Ta:marhi square. In­deed, just the pl inths are so high that the image of the goddess in the sanctum on the first story stands above its counterpart in the Bhairava temple. She is surrounded by small wooden carvings of the sixty­four yoginis that are placed at the head and in between the support­ing wooden pillars around the outside of the sanctum to intensify her female energy and channel it to the outside. The iconography of the goddess further reinforces her domi­nance over the god. She stands on Bhairava who supports her with two of his four hands. He is Kalagnirudra, the embodiment of the Fire of Time that consumes the worlds at the end of each cosmic cycle. In the bronze representation reproduced here (see plate 4), he looks up at the goddess and has two hands joined in an attitude of devotion. As Bhairava was the esoteric identity of the Malia kings, they were the intermediaries between the common people, who wor­shipped Bhairava, and the goddess who was the Malia's tutelary and hence that of the entire kingdom. The hierarchy of power is mirrored for the public to see in the increase by ten of the strength of the beings represented by pairs of statues positioned on both sides of the stairs, a pair for each plinth, leading up to the sanctum. It seems that Jagatprakasa and Jitamitra were more liberal than BhUpatindra. The image in the temple built by the first ofthese three may well have been accessible to the public. Again, although the second temple is a closed one, parts of the image are visible through the wooden latticework of the doors.
