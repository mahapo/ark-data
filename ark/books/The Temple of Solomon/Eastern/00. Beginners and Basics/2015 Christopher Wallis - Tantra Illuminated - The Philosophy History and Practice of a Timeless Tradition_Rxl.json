That is, it is thefirst introduction to the history of Tantra and its philosophy written for ageneral audience.2 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en2] Thepresent volume is unique in combining these three characteristics: 1) it isintended for a readership other than professional scholars, that is, bothspiritual practitioners (yogīs) and undergraduate students; 2) it provides athorough overview of classical Tantra (8th–12th centuries); and 3) it is basedon the original manuscript sources in Sanskrit and the best of the scholarshipproduced over the last thirty years, especially the major research breakthroughsin Tantrik studies in the last ten years.need for this bookThis book meets a specific need, for outside of a relatively small circle ofscholars, awareness of the huge impact of the Tantrik religions on thedevelopment of Asian spiritual thought is still virtually unknown. In universitycourses on Indian religion, it is either not taught, or it is touched on brieflyin a grossly distorted manner. And in countless popular books like the recentAmerican Veda, doctrines that come out of Tantra are mistakenly identified asbelonging to other streams of Indian religion.3[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en3] A book for the widerreadership is needed to set the record straight, give credit where credit isdue, and provide accurate answers to the many questions that the more thoughtfulpractitioners of modern yoga are starting to ask about “the real Tantra.”the purpose of this bookThe purpose of this book is to clearly and effectively answer the followingquestions:❖ What is Tantra?❖ What are its basic spiritual and philosophical ideas?❖ What is its history and who are its main figures?❖ What are its fundamental practices?❖ What is the significance of Tantra to the broader history of Indian yoga?❖ To what extent is it possible to incorporate Tantrik teachings and practicesinto a modern Western yoga practice?The book has an additional purpose as well—to offer the reader an immersion intoa spiritual worldview that (if she chooses to work with it deeply) can triggerradical personal transformation and permanently expanded awareness.scope of the present volumeYou may wonder what the phrase “classical Tantra” refers to. It distinguishesour subject matter from the later Hindu Tantra and haṭha-yoga traditions, andalso from modern Western neo-Tantra. The classical Tantra treated in this volumeis associated with a specific religious tradition, the religion of Śiva-Śakti,also known as Shaivism, the dominant religion of India in the medieval period.But there is also the important category of Buddhist Tantra; thus some readerswill wish to know its relation to what I am calling classical Tantra. (If youare not interested in this question, please skip to “How to read this book,”below.) To answer the question briefly (since more detail is given later on), Ibelieve that this book is a good introduction to Tantra, even for thoseinterested in its Buddhist form, because the latter is so very similar toclassical Śiva-Śakti Tantra. This is not coincidental; the practices of BuddhistTantra that are not found in earlier (non-Tantrik) Buddhism were directlyadopted from classical Śiva-Śakti Tantra.4[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en4] Furthermore, much of thespiritual philosophy of Buddhism that is unique to its Tantrik phase (theteachings of Dzogchen, for example) is extremely similar to the nondual Tantrikteachings at the core of the present volume.5[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en5] I believe that futurescholarship will show that the Tantrik tradition that flourished in theHimālayan region transcended the rigid religious boundaries that are of suchimportance to religious conservatives and scholars.6[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en6] Though we don’t know withcertainty the direction of influence between nondual Śiva-Śakti Tantra and theteachings of Dzogchen, this book, though it focuses on Śaiva (= Śiva-Śakti)Tantra, can indeed function as an adequate orientation to Tantra in general,i.e., to the worldview and practices shared by the various Tantrik religions.how to read this bookThis is not exactly like other books you have read. It uses a couple ofdifferent voices, since it attempts to bridge the gap between those who have aserious spiritual interest in the subject and those who have a scholarlyinterest in it but cannot read Sanskrit well. Much of the time it is informaland easy to read, and occasionally it is a little more difficult andphilosophical. Therefore it is written in a way that makes it possible to skipahead or even skip around. Don’t get bogged down in a difficult passage. Youwill enjoy the book more and be more successful at understanding it if you makeit through once, skipping whatever seems too dense for you, and then go back fora more thorough second read. There are also many Sanskrit words in parentheses,which are not necessary to pay attention to at first. In fact, most things inparentheses are adding nuances that you needn’t worry about the first timethrough. The same goes for the endnotes: they provide more information anddiscussion for those already familiar with the material in the main body of thetext. Some of the endnotes are scholarly; others simply add more detail.Since the subject matter of the book is not linear, but more like a web ofknowledge, you can feel free to skip around if you like. Let yourself engage ina conversation with this book, and the potentially mind-altering or evenlife-changing experience it offers to you will be of a much fuller quality.This book is an introduction to the history as well as the philosophy ofclassical Tantra. The standard scholarly format would be to present the historyfirst, since it provides the context for what follows, but the historicalmaterial can be dense for anyone not already motivated by love for thephilosophy. We have chosen, then, to place the spiritual philosophy up front,after an introduction that explores the definition of the term tantra. If thequasi-scholarly introduction seems too dense, and you want to dive right intothe spiritual teachings, feel free. On the other hand, if you are alreadysomewhat educated in Shaivism, the introduction and the history sections mayhold the greatest interest for you, since the research presented there iscutting-edge and may very well surprise you.Once you have read through the book once or twice, I invite you to return toespecially difficult or profound passages so you can contemplate them further.Such passages are marked with a special symbol (see the key below). You also maywish to select quotes that move or intrigue you and work with them in aspiritual process, as described in the section on The Empowered Means[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-30_split_000.xhtml#empoweredmeans]."},{"pageContent":"acknowledgmentsGratitude to my gurus and a brief life-sketch.First I will acknowledge those who made this book possible in the broadestsense, which will also entail a brief autobiography. Swāmī Muktānanda (“Bābā”)probably did more than anyone else in the 20th century to make the teachings ofŚaiva Tantra known in the West, from incorporating them into his own teachings1[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en1] to influencing majorpublishers (specifically Motilal Banarsidass in India and SUNY Press in theUnited States) to bring out some of the major texts of Kashmīr Shaivism. Myfather brought me to meet Bābā in Santa Monica at the age of eight, which made abig impression on me.My mother brought me to meet Bābā’s successor, Swāminī Chidvilāsānandā (betterknown as Gurumayī), when I was sixteen. She granted me śaktipāt initiation,forever altering the direction of my life. Studying and practicing at Gurumayī’sāshram (until the age of twenty-four) and receiving her sublime teachings, Istarted to fall in love with the texts of Shaivism from which she quoted. At herCatskills āshram, I met two great practitioner-scholars of the Tantra, PaulMuller-Ortega and Douglas Brooks.Contact with these scholars led me to commit to attending university to studythis tradition full time. The instruction and loving mentorship I received fromMuller-Ortega and Brooks at the University of Rochester provided an invaluablefoundation. There being no graduate program in Sanskrit at Rochester, I nextattended the University of California at Berkeley, where I was taught Sanskritgrammar by two masters of the subject, Robert Goldman and SallySutherland-Goldman. I also did a year at U.C. Santa Barbara, where I studiedwith David Gordon White. The watershed in my academic education, though, camewhen I enrolled in the Master of Philosophy program in Classical IndianReligions at the University of Oxford (United Kingdom), where I was fortunate tobe tutored (often one-on-one) by the greatest living scholar of Śaiva Tantra andone of the finest Sanskritists in the world, Alexis J. G. S. Sanderson, SpaldingProfessor of Eastern Religions and Ethics at All Souls College.Returning to U.C. Berkeley, I was extremely blessed to have as a visitingprofessor one of Sanderson’s foremost students, Dr. Somadeva Vasudeva, thebreadth of whose knowledge of Sanskrit literature and Śaiva Tantrik yoga isquite beyond my comprehension. I have learned much from this great scholar andtruly fine man. (Note that this publication uses the more correct spelling“Tantrik,” derived from the Sankskrit adjective tāntrika, instead of theanglicized “Tantric.”)This book owes its greatest debt, though, to Professor Sanderson, whoseinfluence can be felt on nearly every page (especially in the history section).His example formed my ideal of absolute intellectual integrity, which entailsrelentless pursuit of the truth as part of a community of scholars engaged inlongitudinal study that prioritizes the field as a whole over personal glory. Hetaught me the value of admitting when I don’t know, of sacrificing my own agendaand sense of how I would like things to be in deference to the truth, and ofstriving to be as transparent a mediator as possible in the act of transmittingthe words and ideas of the ancient masters to students of the present day. I bowto the vast ocean of his knowledge. I am not at all sure that he will approve ofthe synthesis of historical scholarship and constructive theology that this bookpresents (see the Foreword). In the act of making these ancient spiritualteachings relevant to the lives and needs of modern spiritual seekers (mycommunity and my student base), I have striven to not distort those teachings.If I have done so inadvertently, I apologize and refer the reader to Sanderson’sextensive academic writings. It is to these and his patient, personalinstruction that I owe nearly all of my understanding of the history of Tantra.In terms of my spiritual understanding of the philosophy, that is due to all ofthe teachers named above. It has been further enhanced recently by my contactwith two excellent practice teachers, Ādyashānti and Dharmabodhi Sarasvatī. Theformer is not educated in the Tantrik view, yet his teachings are perfectlyaligned with it, and sitting with him in retreat has powerfully affected me. Thelatter is highly educated in the Tantrik tradition and its yogas, and hisinsight into practice, based on extensive personal experience, has beenextremely helpful in clarifying for me aspects of this path. He has been verygenerous in supporting the writing of this book, reviewing the manuscript, andhosting me at his āshram in Thailand. These two teachers helped me bring mypractice and understanding to a whole new level.The North American yoga community has showered me with incredible love andsupport, inspiring me to bring these teachings to a wider audience. Without it,this book would not have been written.At the deepest level, the one without whom none of this would have happened isGurumayī. The spiritual awakening I had through her grace catalyzed a process ofunfolding that allowed me to encounter the words of the Tantrik master AbhinavaGupta as palpably living energy, not mere fossils. Without Gurumayī’s unfailinglove and grace, I would likely be a mere intellectualist, dessicated of spirit,wondering what it might be like to experience that which the ancient mastersdescribe. I will never forget the blessing she gave me in 1997, when I left herāshram to attend university to study this tradition full time. To her, to myparents (of course), and to all my beloved teachers, one thousand humblepranāms.note from the illustrator“Art enables us to find ourselves and lose ourselves at the same time.”— Thomas MertonEssence manifests form. When patterns arise, consciousness may see something wecall a personality, just as a pattern of sounds can be called a “song.” Overtime, traditional personalities emerged. When a desire arose to share thesepersonalities on paper, there was a challenge: how does one draw asong-of-Consciousness? Not just as a pretty picture, but as a guide for othersto hear and play the music? One might use symbols that could be read like sheetmusic by one’s intended audience.So over many centuries, a rich system of symbols was developed in the East toillustrate deities as patterns in essence, like songs are patterns in space.These images are not Art in the Western sense of expressing a personal vision.They’re Sacred Art as a vehicle, as a yantra or device to transmit essence. It’stempting to consider this iconography as depicting something “out there.”However, this view may prevent us from “hearing the music” inside ourselves. Themusic, symbols, musician, and audience are all the same song played in differentkeys.The images in this book exactly match descriptions in texts translated byChristopher Wallis. Those descriptions did not contain all the necessarydetails, so manuscripts, statues, and paintings as far back as the 10th centurywere also consulted. Though the source materials are ancient, my artwork isflavored by the modern Newar style of Nepal (that of my primary teacher inSacred Art) and my own preference for humanistic anatomy. Months were spent inresearch, but when it was time to draw, I followed my heart.Many thanks to Dinesh Shrestha, Mavis Gewant, and Pieter Weltevrede for sharingteachings from their Sacred Art traditions. Friends from around the worldcollaborated via social websites, adding depth and richness to my work. Thebooks created by Harish Johari and Robert Beer were invaluable not only asreferences but also as tools for transforming the task of drawing into the joyof sadhana. Most of all, I am grateful to Dharmabodhi Saraswati for hisinsights, guidance, and encouragement.Ekabhūmi EllikAugust 2011, Berkeley, CAlist of illustrations❖ Kīrtimukha (protector deity)[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_3.xhtml#krit]❖ Śrī Yantra, Elaborate [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_3.xhtml#yantra]❖ Flaming Vajra [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-9.xhtml#vajra]❖ Śiva as Lord of the Dance (naṭarāja)[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-10_split_002.xhtml#lordofthedance],Expressing the Five Acts❖ Śiva-liṅga [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-12.xhtml#linga], thesimplest representation of presence❖ Map of India [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-12.xhtml#mapofindia],with Key Tantrik Sites❖ Sadāśiva [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-12.xhtml#sadashiva]❖ Svacchanda-bhairava and Aghoreśvarī[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-15.xhtml#image]❖ Amṛteśvara and Amṛta-lakṣhmī[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-16_split_001.xhtml#amrt]❖ Parā-devī [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-17.xhtml#para]❖ The Three Goddesses of the Trika[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-19.xhtml#trinity]❖ Visualization of the Trika Goddesses[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-19.xhtml#mandala]❖ Sarasvatī in the Newar Style[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-19.xhtml#sara]❖ Kubjikā with Navātma-bhairava[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-21.xhtml#kubjika]❖ Lalitā Tripurasundarī [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-22.xhtml#kub]❖ Śrī Yantra, simple [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-23.xhtml#yantra]❖ Tri-triśūlābja-maṇḍala[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-28.xhtml#mandala]❖ The Cakra-system of the Trika[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-30_split_000.xhtml#chakra]❖ Fire-wheel Visualization[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-30_split_000.xhtml#wheeloffire]❖ Ritual Implements[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-30_split_001.xhtml#ritual]"},{"pageContent":"quick ’n’ easy pronunciation guidefor sanskrit words(a full guide can be found in the back of the book)❖ c is always pronounced as “ch,” as in Italian; so candra = chandra and vāc =vaach❖ ph is always as in upheaval, never as in phrase❖ ś and ṣ are both pronounced “sh” as in sugar❖ jñ is pronounced gnya, so yajña is “yag-nya” and jñāna is “gnyaana”"},{"pageContent":"forewordfor scholars and academicsThis section addresses concerns primarily of interest to scholars. It is adefense of the identity of the “scholar-practitioner” and of a new way of doingreligious studies, to which this book is a contribution.One of the most interesting things about the mastery of a body of knowledge isthe extraordinary flexibility it grants. Once well understood, it can bevariously inflected depending on the context, audience, and purpose ofarticulation. Those who study the field called “semiotics”, which, in itspragmatic dimension, refers to the collective process of meaning-making, arefamiliar with the seemingly spontaneous process by which distinct spheres ofdiscourse are generated by specific contexts, and the fact that that apparentspontaneity does not equate with cultural transparency. In academic writing andteaching in the humanities, and most especially in religious studies, there is atacit normative metadiscourse around “objective knowledge” and “knowledge forits own sake” that pushes a forced consensus, one which almost completelyprohibits the examination of religious ideas from a personal or pragmaticperspective. This is an institutionally imposed consensus in the sense that itis not shared by any undergraduates I have taught, certainly not by the generalpublic, and it only appears in the discourse of graduate students because theyhave learned to conceal their personal religious commitments in order to conformto the normative concept of so-called objectivity, an intellectual pretenseglamorized as an academic ideal. (Show me a religion grad student, and I’ll showyou a deeply religious person “in the closet,” or someone who’s had theirreligiosity weeded out of them by the reductionist discourse intellectuallyprivileged by academia.) As the respected Buddhist scholar-practitioner JoséCabezón has noted, “[T]here is still a widespread reticence to engage thequestion of the religious identity of the scholar within religious studies as awhole.”7 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en7]This situation has, in my view, brought about the current atrophying of theacademic study of religion. The fashionability the field enjoyed in the 1960sand ’70s has long since waned, and the field has been rightly criticized forfailing to develop methodologies or hermeneutic strategies that justify itsexistence independent from departments of history, sociology, anthropology,philosophy, etc. (I am reminded of Ninian Smart’s self-mocking characterizationof religious studies as “polymethodological doodling all the time.”) But none ofthis would matter, I think, if undergraduate students could study religion theway they want to, an approach that would, coincidentally, also constitute theunique methodology that religion departments are lacking. By this I mean aserious engagement with the worldviews expressed by religions in acts of body,speech, and mind, in a manner that would entail a range of thought experiments(and even body experiments) that allow the student to make his own embodiedconsciousness the locus for consideration of the question, What does realityactually look like and feel like from within this religious worldview? Suchexperimentation clearly does not involve an actual conversion to the givenreligion, nor does it necessitate the instructor’s personal adherence to thereligious object of experimentation, and yet it is rarely practiced in theuniversity setting. This despite the fact that this sort of process is, in myexperience, what students drawn to the study of religion are most interested in,and despite the fact that such an open and real exploration would be the mostauthentic engagement with the original ideals of academia one could imagine.Though I am an academic scholar, I am also a spiritual practitioner. The book Ihave chosen to write as my first is not one that is likely to gain mecredibility in the academic world, despite the fact that in order to write it Ihad to earn three degrees and become competent in the reading and interpretationof a wide variety of primary and secondary sources. My endeavor here is not toprofit from the current popular interest in something called Tantra, nor is it abid for notoriety by watering down and “making ready for prime time” ideas thatare chiefly comprehensible to trained professionals, as academics often viewmainstream books in their field. Rather, this book is something more interestingto me: it is an exercise in what Cabezón calls “academic theology,” or what Iwould call a self-conscious experiment in well-grounded constructive theology.It weds together the interests and needs of two diverse communities of readersin a way that, I here argue, only a scholar-practitioner is capable of doing. Insuch an individual, two realms of discourse—one rooted in intellectual claims ofobjectivity, the other in personal religious experience and concomitantbeliefs—may either exist separately, forcing him to maintain a kind of splitpersonality, or they may cohere into unity as he permits intellectual insight toinform his spiritual being and spiritual experience to guide his intellectualinquiry without relinquishing his commitment to truth. For me, this process ofcoalescence did not arise within the academic context, in which the only goodreligious scholar is a dis-integrated religious scholar, but within a verydifferent context to which I was initially driven by financial need: freelanceteaching in yoga studios. This environment, derided by some academics as beinganti-intellectual and woefully ignorant of “real yoga,” not only welcomed theprocess of sustained and engaged reflection on the philosophy and practice ofyoga but pushed me to reflect in more productive ways on the material I hadstudied. Questions of how philosophy related to practice, and of what thereligious life of those who authored the ancient texts might have really lookedlike, were forced into the center of my awareness as my audience relentlesslypushed the discourse away from intellectual abstraction and textual literalismand toward concerns about why the original historical actors held the views theydid, what experiences informed those views, what it would mean for modern peopleto hold those views, and how our own cultural context might alter, organically,the ways in which those views might be held. These nonacademic teachingengagements have compelled me to understand the knowledge systems of ancientIndian religion as what they originally were: ways of interpreting reality thatwere embedded in practice contexts and grounded in the real-life concerns ofhuman beings who worked with these religious understandings as ways ofpurposively refashioning their approach to daily lived existence. To avoiddiscussion of how religious ideas might personally impact us is thus to avoidconfronting, in any real way, the original purpose and function of those ideas:for, I argue, it is only in actually applying religious ideas to our own livesthat they can take on their real power and significance, and only in this way dothey become accessible to us as authentic and meaningful objects of inquiry."},{"pageContent":"Introductionan orientation to tantraTantra is now a buzzword in the modern Western world. We see it on the covers ofpopular magazines and books, usually linked suggestively with the notion ofsuperlative sexual experience. Though almost everyone has heard this word,almost no one—including many people claiming to teach something calledtantra—knows anything about the historical development of the Indian spiritualtradition that scholars refer to as Tantra. What these academics study as Tantrabears little resemblance to what is taught under the same name on the workshopcircuit of American alternative spirituality. It is not the main purpose of thisbook to explain why that gap is so wide—a deeply complex issue of historicaltransmission and strange misunderstandings. Here we simply present acomprehensive overview of the original Indian spiritual tradition that wasarticulated in Sanskrit scriptures called tantras (which is where the name camefrom). Why would this be of interest to modern Westerners? There is oneoutstanding reason: millions of Westerners are today practicing something calledyoga, a practice which, though much altered in form and context, can in manyrespects be traced back to the Tantrik tradition.8[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en8]Given the widespread terminological confusion, I ask you as the reader to simplyclear your mind of whatever you think you know about Tantra, however valuablethat knowledge may or may not have been to you, and to start afresh. In thisway, I have a chance to effectively orient you to the original Tantrikworldview: a way of seeing and understanding reality that can challenge andilluminate you to the deepest levels of your being.Yoga is a living tradition profoundly influenced by the Tantra, yet it hasforgotten much of its own history. This book is part of a new wave of work byscholars who are also practitioners, and whose goals are to rediscover andreintegrate some of what has been forgotten; to clarify the roots of many ideasand practices that are floating around (thereby grounding them and enhancingtheir richness); and to chart clearly the vast and varied landscape of Indianspiritual thought, with a view to what it can contribute to our lives today. Forit is certainly the case that most 20th-century teaching and writing on Indianthought was either exciting but incoherent and ungrounded (the practitionercontext) or systematic but dry, boring, and insipid (the academic context). It’stime to rectify that—and no Indian tradition has been more misunderstood,relative to its deep influence on global spirituality, than Tantra.Part of this book is historical. As a scholar, I help people to distinguishbetween new ideas and those that have been around for awhile, not in order tosuggest that the old is better or inherently more legitimate than the new but sothat readers may be equipped to accurately identify which ideas are persistentand widespread in the Tantrik traditions, and therefore central, and which onesare more peripheral. Why might this be an important point of discernment? Fromthe practitioner’s point of view, the enterprise of learning to identify thecentral tenets of a given spiritual tradition is based on the axiom that anytradition preserves over time the most effective teachings and practices anddiscards those that have proven ineffective.9[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en9] Therefore, to identifythe most prevalent Tantrik practices and ideas over the course of centuries ofhistorical development is to identify practices and ideas that have beeneffective for countless practitioners. This process of identification allows usto innovate on a firm foundation of understanding, rather than—as many modernyoga teachers have done—filling the gaps in our knowledge by simply making upideas based on idiosyncratic individual experience. Again, I do not mean toimply that a traditional way of thinking or technique will necessarily be moreeffective for you as an individual than a new one. But it is true that only timewill tell if a new technique or teaching has sufficient efficacy to become anenduring part of a living spiritual tradition.You may ask (and I think you should) how I am qualified to represent theoriginal Tantrik tradition. Twelve years of intensive study at the universitylevel have served to acquaint me with the Sanskrit language and the contents ofsome of the Tantrik texts written in that language. This academic study is, inmy view, complemented by twenty-four years as a spiritual practitioner in atradition influenced by several of these original Tantrik texts. Though I amhardly a master, I have spent many years of my life in the full-time occupationof simply trying to understand the ancient Tantrik masters sufficiently well toaccurately represent them in my own English words. The effect reading this bookhas on your life will be a testament to whether I have accomplished this goal insome measure.why study the history of tantra?Unlike the history you might have been forced to learn in school, the history ofthe Tantrik traditions is a fascinating story that consists not merely ofinformation, but of inspirational and powerful ideas—some of the most originalideas ever conceived concerning human potential. Historically, these ideas wereinextricably wedded to transformative spiritual practices, some of which you mayalready be practicing. You see, some practices that originated within Tantrawere handed down to the present but became unmoored from their originalphilosophical anchor points. (For example, the tradition of haṭha-yoga, thebasis for modern yoga, originally grew out of Śaiva Tantra.) The Tantrik mastersevolved their teachings and techniques as an unbroken whole, a well-craftedinterconnected matrix designed to free you permanently from ignorance andsuffering. So when you understand the profound and exquisite vision of realitythat was originally taught in connection to these yogic practices, thisknowledge empowers your own practice, keeps you inspired about your path, andgives you great clarity and focus. It is therefore practically useful for you tobecome more educated in the traditions that nurtured the practices of yoga thatyou cherish today.There is tremendous misunderstanding in the yoga world today about thehistorical facts of the development of the yogic and Tantrik traditions. Whilehistorical facts may not be the most important aspect of studying thistradition, learning them helps us replace our fantasies about how things are(and were) with a deeper connection to reality. This is a process thatchallenges us in at least three important ways. It challenges us to accept theworld as it is, rather than how we would like it to be. It grounds us in anawareness of the very human difficulties involved with learning, teaching, andliving a spiritual path, thereby helping us to cultivate compassion for othersand patience with ourselves. Finally, it prevents us from using shaky ordownright incorrect historical claims to justify what we think is the best pathor the most correct form of yoga practice. When knowledge of the real historykeeps us from this error, we are forced to rely on our own experience of ourpractice when justifying it to others—which is a far more stable basis.Arguments about which path is best or most authentic are fruitless endeavors.Even worse, when these arguments are “supported” by spurious facts and aconfused and partial knowledge of history, they merely antagonize others andmake us look bad. On the other hand, openly sharing your experience and whatworks for you as an individual, without an agenda, helps to connect you withothers and invites them to contemplate their own experience. This is yoga,beneficial connection.Now a word about the methodology of good scholarly research and the results itproduces. Some people, influenced by so-called post-modern thought, regard withsuspicion any claim about facts or history. They prefer to see everything as asubjective narrative and refuse to grant any authority to truth claims, sayingthat everyone’s “truth,” though different, is equally valid. Though this may bethe case as far as our individual psychological experience of the world goes,social science (e.g., historiography) and the hard sciences have shown thatthere is such a thing as a real fact. How have they shown this? Simple: bydrawing on a sufficient quantity of evidence, weighing it carefully, and thenusing it to make a prediction about something not yet known. When new evidencecomes to light showing that prediction to be correct, the information and themethod used for prediction is shown to be valid. We have many examples of thisin the hard sciences. Black holes were predicted on the basis of mathematicalmodels long before they were observed by astronomers. What physicists knew mustbe true as a result of their accurate understanding of the physical laws of theuniverse was vindicated, almost as an afterthought, by observational evidence.10[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en10] There are also examplesof this in the “soft” sciences, including the study of India, though these aretoo complex to get into here.11[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en11] Let me hasten to addthat unlike some authors, I will not present as fact anything for which strongevidence or scholarly consensus is wanting.Accepting that there are such things as facts requires you to be humble and tohave the flexibility to relinquish your position when it is shown to be wrong.This too is part of yoga. Of course, there is also plenty of room for anindividual to develop her own beliefs, as these philosophical traditionspartially concern themselves with metaphysical issues, about which we are not ina position to provide definitive proof one way or the other. That is, while theTantra actively engages the higher mind, it also attempts to transcend the levelof the intellect on which “proof” is an operative term. Here your owncontemplated experience becomes primary in formulating your understanding ofreality. When the wisdom of well-considered experience is joined coherently towell-grounded factual knowledge, you have a strong foundation from which tosuccessfully navigate both the path of yoga and the world in general.Since we have very few facts about the social setting of the Tantrik traditions,a history of Tantra must be predominantly a history of ideas and practices.Wherever something is known about the lived reality of the communities thatfollowed these teachings, I will mention it. This humanizing of the greatmasters of the tradition helps us feel closer to them and even identify withthem.what’s in a name?the meaning of the word tantraIn this section I will explain the development of the word “tantra,” startingfrom its simple and general meanings and working up to its more complex andspecific applications. First off, tantra is a Sanskrit word with variousstraightforward usages, including “theory,” “doctrine,” or simply “book.” Thoughthe word sometimes designates any sort of book, it more commonly refers toscriptural texts that are purported to have been divinely revealed by God or theGoddess. These tantras began appearing in India around the 6th century of thecommon era and continued to be composed in large numbers (hundreds of majortexts and thousands of minor ones) for the next thousand years. These scripturaltexts also went by other names, such as āgama (“what has come down to us”). Youwill find out more about them and their contents later.“Tantra” has a more specific meaning in the context of these revealedscriptures: it can refer to the system of practice presented by them. Ingeneral, we may say that each tantra presented a more-or-less complete system ofspiritual practice. So a given guru would work primarily with a single tantra(though he would sometimes supplement it with related and subsidiary texts) andteach his disciple on the basis of that specific tantra. In this sense, then,tantra would simply mean “a system of spiritual practice articulated within aspecific sacred text,” and people in the original tradition would thus ask eachother, “Which tantra do you follow?”Western spiritual teachers often state that “tantra” means “loom” or “warp” (asin the weaving term), and these meanings are indeed found in the dictionaryunder “tantra”—but that usage is merely a homonym. None of the Tantrik textscite this as the meaning of “tantra,” which incidentally signals one of thepitfalls of definitions offered by non-Sanskritists. However, the tradition doesoffer some interpretive etymologies of the word “tantra.” An interpretiveetymology is a way of breaking down the word into component parts that allows anunpacking of the inner meaning of the word. The most commonly found etymology of“tantra” follows. It breaks down the word into the verbal roots √tan and √tra,the former meaning “propagate, elaborate on, expand on,” and the latter, “save,protect”:Because it elaborates copious and profound matters, especially relating to theprinciples of reality [tattvas] and mantras, and because it saves us [from thecycle of suffering], it is called a tantra.12[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en12] (Kāmikā-tantra)In other words, Tantra spreads (tan) wisdom that saves (tra). Here the secondverbal root has a double meaning, for it alludes to the fact that Tantrikpractices give us a means of strengthening and protecting ourselves from worldlyharm, as well as bestowing the ultimate spiritual liberation (more on thislater). We could equally well say that a tantra is a device (tra) for expanding(tan), as a mantra is a device for working with the mind (man), and a yantra isa device for controlling (yan). Modern teachers like to mention that the verbalroot √tan means “stretch, expand,” saying that Tantra is so called because itstretches our awareness and expands our capacity for joy. This is a good exampleof a modern interpretive etymology, and though it is not found in the originalsources, it is very much in their spirit.In medieval India, those people who received Tantrik initiation usually receivedit from a single guru in a specific lineage and performed the daily practicegiven by that guru on the basis of a single tantra. So for each individualpractitioner, Tantra as a spiritual movement was not something highly complex,for he did not concern himself with what other tantras or gurus might be saying.By contrast, the Western mind likes to have a sense of the whole landscape andformulate general definitions based on it, so unlike their Indian counterparts,Western scholars have striven to define Tantra as a phenomenon, a religiousmovement, by looking at what its various streams had in common. This effort hasnot been entirely successful, primarily due to a failure to consult a wideenough range of sources, but it is still worth looking at its results so far,which we will do after considering the tradition’s own definition of the word."},{"pageContent":"the tradition’s own definitionThough it is true that most premodern Indian people didn’t care for formulatingabstract general definitions, a few of their scholars did. And when weinvestigate thoroughly enough, we find just such a definition in the originalsources. In my mind a definition of a tradition from within that tradition takesprecedence over definitions offered by academics from a foreign culture athousand years later (though those too are useful, as we will see). So let’slook at what the Tantrik scholar and guru named Rāma Kaṇṭha, who lived around950–1000 CE, says Tantra is:A Tantra is a divinely revealed body of teachings, explaining what is necessaryand what is a hindrance in the practice of the worship of the Divine; and alsodescribing the specialized initiation and purification ceremonies that are thenecessary prerequisites of Tantrik practice. These teachings are given to thosequalified to pursue both the higher and lower aims of human existence.14[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en14] (Rāma Kaṇṭha’scommentary on the Sārdhatriśati-kālottara)I should note here that the language of this definition is colored by the factthat the author is a dualist (which might surprise you, since all the Tantrikteachings that have come to the West are from nondualist sources). However,since the Tantra was (as we shall see) a coherent spiritual system regardless ofsectarian differences such as dualism versus nondualism, the points of RāmaKaṇṭha’s definition are more or less applicable across the board. Furthermore,the definition is important as the only known indigenous attempt to define theTantra. Let’s get clear on the four main points Rāma Kaṇṭha makes.First, he mentions the requirement of proper initiation to the Tantrik path,which took the form of a ritual ceremony that destroyed karmic barriers tosuccessful practice, brought the goal of spiritual liberation within the reachof a single lifetime, and (on the immediate practical level) gave the initiateaccess to the scriptures and the secret practices they contained. We willdiscuss later in the book whether this requirement of initiation means thatWesterners cannot properly undertake a real Tantrik practice. Here it sufficesto note that initiation was regarded as crucial and required in original Tantra.Second, his definition highlights what many people in the original Indiancontext saw as the key element of daily Tantrik practice: “ritual worship” of aform of the Divine. Now, the English phrase “ritual worship” will probably givethe wrong idea to a Westerner with a very different religious background. Let meclarify that here “worship” means—at the very least—the actual evocation of thepower of the Deity and interaction with it. More commonly, it means actuallybecoming that deity through techniques of ritualized meditation and/ormeditative ritual, either temporarily or as part of a process by which anyperception of difference between oneself and the Deity is eventually permanentlyeradicated. As we will see later on, there are also forms of the Tantra thatdispense with ritual altogether and emphasize direct intuitive awareness ofdivine reality brought about through simple practices connected with theelements of daily life. Though originally these forms were greatly in theminority, I will argue later that these are the forms that Westerners can mostsuccessfully and authentically engage with.Third, Rāma Kaṇṭha’s definition states that there is a twofold goal of allTantrik practice, the “higher” and the “lower” goal. The first refers to a stateof spiritual freedom, release from all suffering, salvation or beatitude, thenature of which we will discuss in more depth. This state is usually calledmokṣa or mukti in Sanskrit (both of which mean “release” or “liberation”). Thesecond refers to the goal of worldly enjoyment and prosperity, which encompassespleasure, power, and all good things of the tangible world; it is usually calledsiddhi or bhukti. The fact that the Tantra is legitimately directed at both ofthese goals is one thing that sets it apart from other Indian religioustraditions, or indeed most religions in the world. Though it is true that thereare Tantrik texts devoted almost exclusively to either the goal of mukti or ofbhukti, in general Tantrik spiritual technology was designed to secure bothgoals, with the latter subordinated to the former. Note carefully here that RāmaKaṇṭha’s definition tells us we cannot call any practice Tantrik that is onlydirected toward the lower goal. For example, if the goal of a practice is simplyto improve one’s sex life, then however spiritual-sounding it may be, it cannotbe called Tantra. If, on the other hand, that goal is part of a practice inwhich it is consistently subordinated to the goal of complete spiritual freedomand awakening to the ultimate reality, then it can be called Tantra (if theother definitional requirements are also met).Fourth and lastly, Rāma Kaṇṭha’s definition says that the Tantra is somethinggiven in scriptures that are divinely revealed, which means, in this worldview,that Tantrik teachings and instructions on practice are sanctioned by divineauthority. The Tantrik scriptures themselves are always said to be spoken by aform of God or the Goddess; or, in Buddhist Tantra, a celestial Buddha orBodhisattva, which arguably amounts to the same thing. The “fact” of whether thetantras were “really” divinely revealed was not a question that much interestedthe classical writers; issues of faith and belief were simply not as significantto them as those of efficacy and practice. Since one received the scripturalteachings from a trusted authority (the guru), one simply got on with thepractice, and faith naturally increased as that practice started to showresults.It should be added here that the scriptural corpus of Tantrik texts is almostentirely unpublished so far, in India or the West. That is, they largely existonly in manuscript form (see image to the right), physically and linguisticallyinaccessible to most. What the general public has some limited access to inEnglish is in fact not the Tantrik scriptures themselves, but rather thecommentaries on those scriptures, and other works inspired by them, written bygreat Tantrik masters.15 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en15]These commentaries came, over time, to be treated like scriptures themselves,and this is how they are presented by some modern gurus. Such a presentation ispossible because of the high degree of sophistication and spiritual wisdomexhibited by these commentarial texts, which in many cases seems considerablygreater than that of the original scriptures. The part of the Tantra that todayis called Kashmīr Shaivism consists entirely of these commentaries andassociated writings, written by a series of masters from Kashmīr. Thesematerials are what preoccupy most discussions of Tantrik philosophy, since thescriptural texts are themselves almost wholly concerned with practice.[image/real_manus.jpg]Ancient manuscript of a Tantrik scripture (rotate 90º clockwise to viewcorrectly)western definitions and categorical listsEarlier I said that Western scholarly attempts to define Tantra are alsovaluable. Though Rāma Kaṇṭha’s definition gives us some crucial information, themodern reader needs additional parameters to recognize what original Tantrareally looks like. The scholarly definitions give us this information in theform of lists of features that are typically found in Tantrik thought andpractice. We will now examine some of these lists. First, though, I shouldmention that the scholarly attempt to define the Tantra is rooted in theunderstanding that it was a spiritual phenomenon that affected all the Indianreligions to some degree. It was a new way of doing spiritual practice that wasdeeply influential; for all that, it was undertaken by a small percentage of thetotal population. An argument can be made that the Tantra is a mode of practice(and associated mode of viewing reality) that is not of any one religion, thoughit is found as the esoteric dimension of many religions.16[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en16] The religions that itinfluenced, in order of degree of influence, were Shaivism, Buddhism,Vaishnavism, Jainism, and Indian Islam.17[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en17] The innovations ofTantra were developed almost entirely within the first two religions in thislist, then transmitted to the others. Between these two, Shaivism has historicalpriority, because many of the Buddhist Tantrik texts drew directly or indirectlyon Śaiva tantras, while the reverse was rarely if ever the case.18[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en18] Though Shaivism wastherefore the Tantrik religion par excellence, Buddhism eventually becamethoroughly “Tantricized,” and in this form, it was transmitted to Tibet. ThusTibetan Buddhism is almost completely Tantrik. Any attempt to define the Tantraas a general category, then, ought to encompass both Śaiva Tantra and BuddhistTantra. Indeed, there is little discernable difference between the most“Buddhistic” school of Śaiva Tantra (the Krama) and the most “Śaivist” school ofBuddhist Tantra (Dzogchen). The commonalities that lead us to argue for thevalidity of “Tantra” as a general concept will become more obvious as we examinelists of characteristics that match both Śaiva and Buddhist variations.Scholars have attempted to ascertain what Śaiva Tantra, Buddhist TantraBuddhism, and Vaiṣṇava Tantra all have in common, and thus what constitutesTantra per se. Here I wish to combine the lists presented by five differentscholars (Tribe, Hodge, Goudriaan, Brooks, and Lopez) to create a master list ofTantric features. In no particular order, the features that characterize Tantraas a spiritual movement are:• alternative path / new revelation / more rapid path• centrality of ritual, esp. evocation and worship of deities• proliferation in the number and types of deities (compared to the antecedenttradition)• visualization and self-identification with the deity• centrality of mantras• installation of mantras on specific points of the body• ontological identity of mantras and deities• necessity of initiation and importance of esotericism/secrecy• yoga (usually referring to meditation and visualization practices)• ritual use of maṇḍalas, especially in initiation• spiritual physiology (i.e. subtle body and cakras) and kuṇḍalinī• mapping deities and pilgrimage sites onto the practitioner’s body• linguistic mysticism• importance of the teacher (guru, ācārya)• addition of worldly aims, achieved through largely magical means• lay/householder practitioners• bipolar symbology of god/goddess• nondualism• revaluation of the body• revaluation of ‘negative’ mental states• importance of śakti (power, energy, goddess)• revaluation of the status and role of women• transgressive/antinomian acts• utilization of ‘sexual yoga’• the cultivation of bliss• spontaneity (sahaja, a technical term)• special types of meditation that aim to transform the individual into anembodiment of the divine after a short span of timeThe last ten features really only apply to nondualist or “left current” Tantra(a term that will be explained further). There are six elements that constitutethe most prominent features of classical Tantra: yogic meditation, mantras,maṇḍalas, guru, initiation, and ritual worship of the divine (using fire, water,flowers, scented pastes, and so on). Yet, despite their universality, thesefeatures cannot be taken to completely define Tantra by themselves, because allof them (except maṇḍalas) are also found to some degree in non-Tantrik Indianreligions.These six aspects are usually organized and given their specific form by theseventh universal feature of the Tantra, that of “deity yoga,” which entailsworking with the power of a particular aspect of the Divine to which one hasbeen linked through initiation. This work takes place through use of the deity’sassociated mantra, yantra, visualization, and/or consecrated image. Thus wereturn full circle to the beginning of our discussion: what distinguishes apractice as indisputably Tantrik is that it involves deities and their mantrasthat are revealed in explicitly Tantrik scriptures. Having said this, it isperfectly appropriate to call any teaching or practice Tantrik (or “tantric”) ifit appears in an original Tantrik source (whether scripture or commentary). Ifwe wish to preserve any specific meaning to the word, however, the label is nototherwise appropriate.implicationsThe definitions we are considering are entirely focused on the historicalreality of the Tantra in its original Indian context. As a Western student ofthe Tantra, you may be dismayed by them, because they don’t seem to describe apractice that you can engage with as part of your yoga and philosophy of life.However, though it may or may not be true that you cannot undertake a Tantrikpractice of the type most frequently found in medieval India, that does not meanthat no form of Tantrik practice is available to you. As you will see, there areTantrik teachings and practices that are both accessible and powerfullyeffective for the Westerner. The most important thing about any Tantrik practiceyou learn is that you receive it from someone experienced in it, who hasreceived some or all of its benefits and navigated its pitfalls.It is impossible to describe the whole field of Tantra in one book. The presentvolume therefore focuses almost exclusively on the teachings and practices ofnondual Śaiva Tantra[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-10_split_000.xhtml#nondual]. Aside fromthe need for brevity, there are three reasons for this.❖ First, nondual Śaiva Tantra is the area of my expertise.❖ Second, despite its massive historical and contemporary significance, ŚaivaTantra is not yet well known compared to Tibetan Buddhist Tantra, which alreadyhas a substantial following in the West.❖ Third, and most importantly, I have seen first-hand how powerfully theteachings of nondual Śaiva Tantra resonate with Western yoga practitioners. Ihave come to believe that this tradition possesses some of the most effectiveteachings and technologies for human transformation, and that it is particularlyrelevant for our time.questions and answershow does all this fit into “hinduism”?Most of us have been taught that the indigenous religion of India (which used tobe called Hindustan) is something called Hinduism. What is Hinduism, and howdoes it relate to Shaivism and Tantra? This question, which should be a simpleone, is confused by a profound series of misunderstandings.Let me start by clarifying the biggest misunderstanding: there is no such thingas “Hinduism.” That is, until recently. Bear with me and I’ll explain. WhenEuropean culture began interacting with India in a sustained manner, starting inthe 16th century, it encountered a bewilderingly complex culture of dozens oflanguages and religious and cultural traditions. Overwhelmed by this complexity,Europeans simply referred to all non-Muslim Indian people as Hindoos (derivedfrom the Persian term for “people east of the Indus River”) and, a little later,started grouping all their various religious practices under the nameHinduism.20 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en20] Part of thereason for this is that Europeans at that time did not care to investigate thevarious Indian spiritual traditions and come up with more accurate terminology.What is certain is that prior to the colonial period (the 1500s onward), theterm Hinduism is not accurate: what we find instead are religious traditionsthat regarded themselves as mutually distinct, called (in English) Brāhmanism(a.k.a. Vedism), Shaivism, Shāktism, Vaiṣhṇavism, Buddhism, and Jainism (plus afew non-religious spiritual traditions, like Sānkhya and Pātañjala Yoga).21[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en21]The term Hinduism is inappropriate for another important reason; it was not usedby Indian people themselves until the colonial period. Modern scholarshipincreasingly (though still not fully) respects the object of its study andstrives to understand things from the inside as well as the outside. From thatperspective, we can say that something called Hinduism authentically began toexist when the first Indian used the word to refer to his own religion (thishappened in the early 1800s).22[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en22] As more educated Indiansbegan to use the term, they had to come up with a definition for it. Theydecided that “Hinduism” denoted all those lineages, sects, and traditions thatregarded the Vedas (India’s first holy books) as the ultimate spiritualauthority. This excluded Buddhism—which distanced itself from other Indiantraditions by repudiating the Veda—despite the fact that it derived from thesame religious culture and played a crucial role in the development of Indianspirituality in all periods. Some other Indian traditions (such as Shaivism)were included in the definition of Hinduism, though they were not based on theVedas, and they granted the Vedas no special religious authority.23[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en23]Nowadays, we can certainly say that Hinduism exists: though originally anartificial concept, it has now—for better or for worse—become “reified.” This isnot only because the word is used extensively today by Indian people themselves,but more importantly because previously separate Indian religions have cometogether over the last five hundred years to make a new religious “stew,”erasing many old boundaries, making meaningless many of the old debates, andimparting more or less the same flavor throughout. This has necessarily meantthe loss of the more distinct and unique flavors; the unique doctrines andpractices of the religions that coalesced to make Hinduism have mostly beenforgotten.24 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en24]This modern Hinduism is as much a cultural identity as it is a religious one (ormore so), which is why it is not, generally speaking, something one converts tobut rather something one is born into.so as a practitioner of yoga or tantra, i’m not somehow converting to hinduism?The foregoing discussion explains why it is the case that a Westerner who wishesto practice yoga or Śaiva Tantra does not necessarily need to adopt a newreligious and cultural identity. It is true that membership in some Indianreligious traditions requires that you be part of a specific caste or clan, orundergo specific Vedic rites of passage. However, the practice of Tantrik yogainvolves transcending one’s ordinary identity, and therefore does not requireinitiates to belong to any specific caste, class, gender, or ethnic group. To bemore precise, Tantrik practice involves the creation (or realization) of anesoteric divine identity within your earlier, culturally-specific identity. Soyou can remain a cultural Christian, Jew, or Buddhist and still be a Tāntrika.25[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en25] Śaiva Tantra inparticular articulated the idea—unique in India—that all followers of itstradition form a single community regardless of birth, and that therefore it isbetter to initiate a sincere foreigner (bottom of the caste hierarchy) than aninsincere brāhmin (at the top).26[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en26] Though in the 21stcentury people can do what they like, to me it’s important to know that thespiritual path I want to walk sanctions my walking on it.27[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en27]what’s the connection betweentantra and yoga?That really depends on what you mean by “yoga.” I’ll address two main meanings.The first is the original meaning of the word “yoga,” referring to acomprehensive set of psycho-physical practices (emphasizing meditation) intendedto discipline and integrate body, mind, and spirit with the aim of attaining thehighest spiritual goal. Yoga in this sense began around the time of the Buddha.A thousand years later, the Tantra incorporated yoga as an important part of itssystems of practice. Tantra also expanded on the previously existing body ofyogic practice, adding hundreds of new techniques: more complex prāṇāyāmas,detailed visualization practices, and mantra-science, as well as many body-basedpractices, especially yogic postures, sacred hand gestures, and the activationof energy centers (cakras) in the body.We see the significance of yoga to the Tantrik tradition when we simply list thefour main topics found in the Tantrik scriptures:❖ doctrine or wisdom teachings (jñāna),❖ ritual worship (kriyā),❖ mystical practice (yoga), and❖ daily conduct and vows (caryā).A number of elements of Tantrik yoga have survived into the present day, thoughusually separated from their original context. We will present some informationon Tantrik yoga in Part 3 of this book.On the other hand, if you mean “yoga” in the modern sense of a comprehensiveāsana practice, plus one or two other simplified practices (i.e., what scholarscall “modern postural yoga”), it too is connected to the Tantra, if onlytenuously. Modern yoga is the latest phase of a historical development that maybe traced all the way back to Śaiva Tantrik yoga. We can briefly summarize thesalient facts here: the religion of Shaivism and its Tantra or esotericteachings, which comprised an enormously detailed system with a vastinstitutional base, became unwieldy with the loss of state patronage after theMuslim conquests, and thus was later simplified into (and mostly replaced by) agrassroots system of practice called haṭha-yoga.Haṭha-yoga traced itself back to the most well-known Śaiva Tantrik guru,Matsyendra. It presented itself as a complete spiritual path, consisting ofprāṇāyāma, meditations on the centers of the subtle body, and the use of threebandhas and more than eighty-four different yogic postures or āsanas, all inservice of activating and raising the spiritual energy called kuṇḍalinī. Thoughnearly all of these elements were explicitly derived from Śaiva Tantra,haṭha-yoga was not fully Tantrik because its texts did not teach Tantrikmantras, Tantrik ritual, or require full Tantrik initiation (the threeindispensible elements of mainstream classical Tantra). It preserved some of theearlier practices of Tantrik yoga with admirable success, though it alsocontinued the process of dilution and simplification of the Tantra. In the early20th century, haṭha-yoga’s āsanas and prāṇāyāmas became the inspiration for thesynthesis of the system of modern yoga.28[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en28] Thus modern yoga has itsroots in ancient Śaiva Tantra.what is the kāma-sūtra?what does it have to do with tantra?Nothing. The Kāma-sūtra is part of a branch of literature called Kāma-śāstra, orthe science of pleasure. Its overall goal is the maximization of sensualpleasure as a valid end in itself. By definition, it is not Tantrik, because inthe Tantra, the goal of pleasure, when present, is always subordinated to thegoal of final spiritual liberation, which does not figure into the Kāma-sūtra.Simply reading the original texts will immediately reveal that they belong to acompletely different class of literature. Nor do any of the public erotic templecarvings seen in India (such as in Khajurāho) relate to Tantrik practice.but tantra is about divinesexuality, right?Only if you are interpreting that phrase very broadly indeed. If we survey theŚaiva Tantrik literature as a whole, we will see that sex per se is virtuallyabsent as a topic. There is one lineage group, however, the Kaula, that teachessensual practices and has what we might call a “sexualized” view of the world,seeing the whole of reality as the harmonious and joyous pulsating union ofvarious sets of complementary opposites.In the original Tantrik sources, we do find some techniques for working withsexual energy and using it to activate kuṇḍalinī, but we find absolutely nophysical techniques aimed at prolonging orgasm and so on. While there is such athing as a Tantrik sexual ritual in the Śaiva tradition, it was taught in onlyone text out of many hundreds, and it is there called a secret and esotericdoctrine meant for a very few. (It is taught much more prominently in BuddhistTantra, however.) The Tantrik sexual ritual was primarily a meditative exercise,not a pleasure-maximizing exercise. For more on the difference between originalTantra and the American new-age “Tantric sex” workshops, see the conclusion[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-30a.xhtml#sadfact]. Those workshops areabout spiritualized sexuality (not necessarily a bad thing per se), whereasoriginal Tantra is about a sensual and embodied spirituality (and even then,only in the Kaula schools). What original Tantra is all about will become clearas you continue reading.outline of the restof the bookIn Part 1, after briefly defining nondual Tantra, we will explore all the basicteachings in the philosophy of nondual Śaiva Tantra, especially as they apply tospiritual practitioners in the 21st century. In Part 2, I will give a historicaloverview of the development of the major branches or schools of ŚaivaTantra—that is, the systems dedicated to Śiva and/or Śakti—with an outline ofthe characteristics of each branch. Following that, in Part 3, I will delineatethe main practices and lived reality of this Tantrik tradition in anintroductory manner. All three sections include new translations of passagesfrom the original Sanskrit texts. Finally, there is a conclusion discussing“Undertaking a Tantrik spiritual practice in the modern world” with an afterwordon “Survivals of Śaiva Tantra; or, where do I learn more?” You will also findvarious appendices of interest to the serious student of Tantra.[image/Flaming_Vajra_INK.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"1The Philosophy of Nondual Śaiva Tantraprefacewhat you’re getting yourself intoTo step into the world of Śaiva Tantra is to enter a world of magic and mystery.Mind-expanding philosophy and arcane rites, pantheons of fierce goddessesembodied in mystic syllables, energy diagrams that map the many dimensions ofreality, visualizations of power centers within the body, gestures that expressthe purest forms of consciousness, nectarean experiences of the sheerestecstasy, wielders of supernatural power, and concepts that challenge thefundamental norms of ordinary society: these are just some of its features. Inshort, it is a world that encompasses the entire range of human spiritual andreligious activity, from the most elevated and sublime contemplations of ourinner nature to the strangest of superstitions. (We’ll be focusing on theformer.) Some people today are interested only in the high philosophy of theTantra, others in the purely practical techniques, others are curious about theentire historical picture.Whomever you are, to fully delve into this world, you must not only relinquishany notions of what you think Tantra is but also some of your deeply heldassumptions about reality itself. Otherwise, you will never be able to trulyunderstand this particular worldview. Any alternative worldview can function asa critique of the status quo view of reality in our society, but for it to do soin a real and productive way we must—at least temporarily—lay open to questioneven the fundamental principles by which we create interpretations of phenomena;in other words, we must question the very frameworks with which we create aworld for ourselves to live in.One way to initiate this process is to begin cultivating an awareness that weall live in a world of stories, or narratives. Narratives are the more or lesscoherent stories that we are told, and we tell ourselves, about the events andpeople around us in order to make sense of them. All generalizations, statementsof value judgment, and verbal representations of reality constitute narratives.All narratives are false in the sense that they are necessarily distortions ofreality and true in the sense that they bear some relationship to reality, onethat can tell us much about ourselves. For example, if someone says, “The BayArea is a great place to live,” we don’t usually assume that they have done acareful study of dozens of places to live, cross-referenced against a survey ofordinary people about what constitutes a great place to live. Rather, we knowthat they have had some specific, good experiences living in the Bay Area andhave generalized these into a story.Usually, however, we aren’t so clear minded about our own stories. When you say,“I have an issue with ____,” or “I’m good/bad at ____,” you are selectivelyrepresenting to yourself and others a complex array of past experiences in a waythat reduces them to an apparently factual proclamation and implies a permanentstate of affairs. Similarly, if you say to someone, “I’m happily married,” youare representing and reducing a set of experiences that, if known by the personto whom you are speaking, would not necessarily be described by them as a happymarriage. However, to try to arrive at the “truth” of whether or not themarriage is in fact happy is missing the point—for the only truth is the natureand content of the specific, individual experiences themselves. Everything elseis a story being told about these experiences. So, what type of question doesnot miss the point? Perhaps one that addresses how and why we represent ourexperiences with a given narrative about them, and whether or not that narrativeis serving us well. For each narrative about the past shapes our experience ofthe present. While it is true that some narratives better approximate realitythan others, the primary value narratives have lies in their usefulness forhelping us create the world we want to live in. When they are not doing that,their value is questionable.So like everyone, you have sold yourself a set of stories about how things areand how you are. When a set of stories doesn’t meet a person’s deepest needs,that person eventually starts seeking new ones. This is where religion comes in.A religion is a complex structure of narratives about reality intended toaccomplish a specific goal (often labeled as “salvation” or “liberation”). Areligion, then, is a metanarrative. When you engage with a spiritual traditionsuch as Śaiva Tantra, you are inquiring into whether its narratives aboutreality are sufficiently compelling and effective to warrant overwriting some ofyours with some of its. (Of course, you are also enquiring into the efficacy ofits practical techniques, but these are inseparably joined to its narratives.)According to Śaiva Tantra, embracing a more uplifting interpretation of realityis a necessary step on the way to complete transcendence of all narratives.Unlike the way it is seen by many religions, some branches of Tantra explicitlyacknowledge that nothing that can be said in words is complete or absoluteTruth. The Real cannot be adequately captured by language, and therefore allattempts to do so are approximations that have a relative utility. Anapproximation in language (i.e., a narrative) is useful insofar as it ultimatelyleads you beyond language to a desired experience of reality, which is itself awordless, immediate state of personal revelation.29[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en29] If this is not yourgoal, then what follows can at least have an intellectual interest for you.definition of nondual śaiva tantraWhile we will address other Tantrik traditions in the following historicaloverview, this book takes as its exemplar and focal point the lineages ofnondual Śaiva Tantra (pronounced SHY-vuh TUN-truh), most clearly typified by theKaula Trika lineage. Later on, as we move through the history, you willunderstand how this specific tradition fits into the big picture of the Tantra.To begin, though, I want to define nondual Śaiva Tantra (NŚT for short) asclearly as possible, so you can get oriented to where we’re headed and whatwe’re going to focus on (please note in the period we are looking at, theGoddess traditions called Śākta Tantra were not separate from Shaivism. Theywere considered part of the same religion).My definition of nondual Śaiva Tantra isA spiritual movement originating in northern India that reached its peak in the9th to 12th centuries, primarily characterized by1. Emphasis on direct experience of a divine reality that has transcendent andimmanent aspects, called Śiva and Śakti respectively, with Śiva primarilyunderstood as the pure consciousness that is ultimate ground of being and Śaktias the flowing energy making up the entire manifest universe.2. Initiation into a guru-disciple relationship and an egalitarian kula(spiritual community).3. Spiritual practice in four aspects: contemplation of View teachings,meditative ritual, yogic techniques of the subtle body, and the aestheticcultivation of the senses, all aimed at accessing and assimilating the divineenergy in all things, in order to achieve both worldly success and spiritualliberation.30 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en30]This definition also applies to other forms of nondual Tantra, such as Buddhistforms (though they of course use names for the Divine other than Śiva and Śakti,such as Buddha-nature). This rather condensed definition will be explainedsimply now and elaborated later.NŚT holds that one thing alone exists: the Divine, in various permutations. Tosay that God alone is real is the same as saying everything that exists is God.In NŚT, to experience this divinity in and as all things is the goal of thepractice. The Divine is here taught as having two aspects, the transcendent andthe immanent. The transcendent aspect is called Śiva (SHEE-vuh) and personifiedas male divinity (God). Though Śiva is represented mythologically as havingcertain characteristics, Tāntrikas (followers of the Tantra) understand Śiva aspure Consciousness: nonpersonal, utterly transcendent of all limitations orqualities, beyond the reach of senses, speech, and mind—in short, the singularLight of Awareness that makes possible all manifestation; the quiescent andpeaceful ground of all that is.The immanent aspect of the divine (“immanent” means perceivable through thesenses and the mind) is called Śakti (SHUCK-tee) and personified as femaledivinity (Goddess). That is, the entire manifest universe is the Goddess, andtherefore ought to be reverenced as such. Now, Śiva and Śakti are actually one,not two, but are represented as two because they correspond to twointerdependent aspects of reality, one of which is predominant in any givenmoment of experience. The two different experiences of the Divine represented byŚiva and Śakti are the enstatic, in which we turn within, surrender everything,and reach the quiescent and transcendent ground of our being; and the ecstatic,in which we express our divine nature in creative, dynamic, outward-going, andembodied ways. According to NŚT, both modes are necessary to fully know theDivine, and a harmonious balance of both is the only true spiritual liberation.The cultivation of this state of awakened freedom originally took place in thecontext of a spiritual community guided by a spiritual master. (He was called amaster not because he was everyone’s boss but because he had completely masteredhimself.) Though people were required to take initiation formally in order tohave access to the guru and to the scriptures, it is important to note thatinitiates were not required to renounce their jobs, possessions, or family life.That is to say, the Tantra was mostly a “householder” path, and renunciates werethe minority. The practitioners were people like you and me, and they dealt withmany of the same challenges of everyday life that we face today. They joined akula, or community that rejected the significance of caste, class, and genderdivisions, and they practiced a life-affirming spiritual discipline. This ispart of the definition above because NŚT emphasizes the crucial importance ofhaving a teacher, of proper initiation, and of the role of community. We couldeven say these are indispensable.The third element of the above definition concerns the type of practice NŚTtaught. While meditation, mantras, and ritual are central, these are also foundin many other forms of Indian spirituality. What NŚT added was its innovativeyogic techniques of the subtle body, plus the revolutionary notion thatvirtually anything can become a form of spiritual practice. This idea is basedon the teaching that all things are manifestations of the Goddess. Therefore thebody was seen not as a locus of sin and impurity, as in the pre-Tantriktradition, but rather as a vehicle to realize divine reality. This led to a newemphasis on practices focused on the body and its energies and to the detailedmapping of the structure of the universe onto the body, which was seen as amicrocosm of the whole. Likewise, the experiences of the senses were not viewedas distractions from spirituality but as opportunities to engage in divineworship. This was a more effective approach for people living in the world, forspiritual practice was no longer limited to ritual acts or ascetic renunciation.Thus this path was sometimes called “the new and easy method.” NŚT teaches thateven mundane daily actions like washing the dishes and walking the dog areopportunities for experiencing the joy that flows naturally from the holisticawareness of being in full Presence.Again, this is just a brief and simplified summary of the attitude NŚT takes tothe world and to practice. It is also a definition in the sense that it helps usto know what we’re looking at and to differentiate it from other paths. ThoughNŚT shares many similarities with other nondual mystical paths, we honor thetradition by reserving the word Tantra for the lineage teachings that were basedon the revealed scriptures called tantras.orientation to the viewThis section serves to summarize the vision of reality that is central to thenondual Śaiva Tantra and which undergirds and empowers all the practices thatconstitute the path. In the Indian tradition, the first and most crucial step onthe spiritual path is getting oriented to the View (darśana) of the path thatyou will walk. The Sanskrit word darśana is often translated as “philosophy,”but the connotations of that English word miss the mark. Darśana meansworldview, vision of reality, and way of seeing; it is also a map of the pathyou will walk. We may understand the importance of View-orientation through ananalogy: You might have all the right running gear, a snappy outfit and the bestshoes, and you might be in great shape, but none of that will matter if you arerunning in the wrong direction. By contrast, if you first get properly orientedso that you are moving in the right direction, even if you go slow or have afunny walk, you’ll still get there in the end. Thus, orientation to the View iscrucial even for those whose interest in the Tantra is entirely practical, forpractice that is not founded on and aligned with right View (sad-darśana) issaid to be fruitless. Note that “right View” is also the first step of the NobleEightfold Path of Buddhism.Now this teaching is not very popular in the West, partially because we valuenot telling people what to think or believe, but also because the View teachingsare not well understood. The popular opinion, then, is that yoga will do itswork regardless of what viewpoint you hold, since yoga transcends the mind. Thisis true but to a very limited extent. It is also true that yoga can only takeyou so far if its attainments are being used to reinforce a skewed view. Thisexplains why some great yogis in medieval India became sorcerers, drunk onpower; and why some prominent yogis today, similarly deluded, have manipulatedtheir students and wielded their power for personal gain. Yoga (and even more soTantrik Yoga) gives power, and that power can magnify whatever is present: itmakes a good person into a saint and a jerk into an even greater and moreeffective jerk. Realizing this fact, which accounts for so much otherwisedisillusioning behavior in the world of yoga, we may begin to take a leaf out ofancient India’s book and require students to be well-versed in right View beforethey are considered intermediate, let alone advanced.Let’s get clear: Having right View does not mean the ability to recite doctrineaccurately. It means having marinated your mind and heart in the spiritualteachings until they illuminate your experience of reality. It means holding theteachings close until they become your beloved friends and allies, yourunfailing supports. It means being able to offer them to others in your own way,through your own unique words and actions. (Note well though, being a goodspeaker of the View does not necessarily indicate inner attainment.) Finally, itmeans having seen through the pitfalls of wrong understanding that drain theteachings of their uplifting power.Of course there is not only one right View. Each practice tradition has a rangeof possibilities for right View (a broad range on some issues and a narrow rangeon others), straying from which will take you off the path sooner or later. As adeceptively simple Chinese proverb has it, “Be careful where you’re going,because you might end up there.” If you stop and think about it, you’ll see thismakes sense. Just as wrong alignment in a yoga pose will cause damage to yourbody sooner or later, in the same way having an understanding which is notaligned with your real goal will be at best ineffective and at worst take youinto deep delusion. Since practice happens every day, misalignments have a slowbut huge cumulative effect over time. There must be alignment of View, practice,and fruit for this path to work. If you know anyone who has practiced for yearsand is not a highly developed, stable, kind, clear, relaxed, and open person, itis because of a lack of alignment of these three. It is never too late, but thelonger the misalignment has been there, the harder it can be to correct.An objection that is sometimes raised concerning the process of learning andimbibing View teachings is that as practitioners we wish to become free of allmental constructs, so why would we add more to the already considerable load weare carrying? The ancient teachers were very much aware of this objection andclarified that we cannot leap from a flawed foundation straight into freedomfrom mental constructs. Right View, in alignment with our goal, is preciselythat View which can empower us to first release our distorted views and then togo beyond constructed views altogether. As we proceed, you will start tounderstand how this is possible.I will conclude these prefatory comments by giving just one real-life example tohelp to dissolve any remaining skepticism about the value of View teaching. Thegreat master Abhinava Gupta suggests to us that if you practice yoga from theperspective that you are not good enough as you are, or that there is somethingwrong with you that needs fixing, then your yoga cannot fulfill its ultimatepurpose because it is a practice founded on wrong understanding. It can only goas far as fulfilling the limited purpose that has been conceived by your limitedego-mind. However, if you undertake the practice of yoga with the right View ofself, that you already are a perfect and whole expression of the Divine and thatyou are doing yoga to realize and then fully express what is already true, thenyou have empowered your practice to take you all the way. This shift into rightView can happen at any time; and when it does, the rocket fuel added to yourprogress will be proof enough of what I have said. In fact, only experientialproof is valid in this domain; I make arguments with words only to satisfy yourmind that the experiment is worth conducting.Now that we have been oriented to the necessity of View-orientation, we areready to encounter the core View of nondual Śaiva Tantra. First I will present acondensed, high-octane paragraph that contains the whole of the View in seedform. After that, I will unpack that paragraph in more detail. Engage yourintuitive and poetic faculty more strongly as you read the seed paragraph,reading slowly and carefully, letting the words sink in regardless of whetheryou fully understand them intellectually. Your intellectual faculty can engagemore fully for the unpacking. You may wish to reread this orientation sectionmore than once; at the same time, don’t feel that you have to understandeverything before moving on.Now let’s dive in together, beginning at the very core: what is the true natureof reality?the viewAll that exists, throughout all time and beyond, is one infinite divineConsciousness, free and blissful, which projects within the field of itsawareness a vast multiplicity of apparently differentiated subjects and objects:each object an actualization of a timeless potentiality inherent in the Light ofConsciousness, and each subject the same plus a contracted locus ofself-awareness. This creation, a divine play, is the result of the naturalimpulse within Consciousness to express the totality of its self-knowledge inaction, an impulse arising from love. The unbounded Light of Consciousnesscontracts into finite embodied loci of awareness out of its own free will. Whenthose finite subjects then identify with the limited and circumscribedcognitions and circumstances that make up this phase of their existence, insteadof identifying with the transindividual overarching pulsation of pure Awarenessthat is their true nature, they experience what they call “suffering.” Torectify this, some feel an inner urge to take up the path of spiritual gnosisand yogic practice, the purpose of which is to undermine their misidentificationand directly reveal within the immediacy of awareness the fact that the divinepowers of Consciousness, Bliss, Willing, Knowing, and Acting comprise thetotality of individual experience as well—thereby triggering a recognition thatone’s real identity is that of the highest Divinity, the Whole in every part.This experiential gnosis is repeated and reinforced through various means untilit becomes the nonconceptual ground of every moment of experience, and one’scontracted sense of self and separation from the Whole is finally annihilated inthe incandescent radiance of the complete expansion into perfect wholeness. Thenone’s perception fully encompasses the reality of a universe dancingecstatically in the animation of its completely perfect divinity.unpacking the viewAll that exists, has ever existed or will ever exist, is one infinite divineBeing, free and blissful, whose body is the universe and whose soul isconsciousness. This philosophy, then, can be called theistic monism, which means1) the view that only one thing really exists—i.e., that every person and objectexists as a form or aspect of one basic reality (monism)—and2) that that basic reality has an innate capacity for self-awareness, andtherefore it can be called a being, a being whose nature is unbounded by anyform of limitation (theism).Though problematic, the only word we have in English to denote a completelyunbounded conscious being is “God.” Thus all sentient beings, seen and unseen,are simply different forms of one divine Consciousness, which looks out at theuniverse that is its own body through uncountable pairs of eyes. To make itpersonal: you are not separate from God/dess and never have been. Indeed, youare the very means by which She knows Herself.This philosophy holds that the basic principle of reality—the foundation of allthat is, that to which all things are reducible and which is not itselfreducible to anything else—is conscious Awareness. This is argued for in thefollowing manner: We cannot demonstrate the existence of any reality that is notthe content of some being’s experience, and all experiences by definition takeplace within awareness and are permeated by awareness. Thus everything andanything we can point to as having any existence whatsoever—whether commonlyheld realities, like what we call the external world, or your own personalreality, such as your dreams and visions—exists within the field of awareness.To posit the existence of something that no one is aware of is nonsense, for assoon as you posit it, you are necessarily aware of it. (If you say, “Well, whatabout things out there in the universe that scientists have proven the existenceof but no one has ever seen?” then you have confused consciousness withperception. If the physicist has modeled the outer-space object mathematically,then he is necessarily aware of it.)So far the proposition is quite logical; the specifically spiritual assertionhere is that all limited consciousnesses (e.g., you and me) are merely vantagepoints within one all-encompassing and unbroken field of awareness. Actually,this too is logical, because if we were each separate islands of consciousness,discontinuous with the rest, we would not be able to communicate with each otheror even share the same reality. There could not be any coherence by which wecould call reality a universe if it was perceived by more than one perceiver.Thus there is only one Perceiver and only one Doer. Still, I call this assertion“spiritual” because there is no way to prove it except through your innerspiritual experience, which will prove it to you and you alone.In other words, the nature of Consciousness is such that each given embodimentof it can, through empowered reflection, come to realize its nature; but thereis no proof of its nature other than this individual internal process, preciselybecause this Consciousness is prior to, and the basis of, all “proofs.” From theperspective of the nonduality of Consciousness, then, the attempt toscientifically prove or validate our spirituality is absurd, because all sciencepresupposes Consciousness but not the other way around.Another way of explaining this teaching is to say that all things are part ofone vast field of energy, called the Light of Creation or the Light ofConsciousness (prakāśa). This field of energy, vibrating at an incalculablenumber of different frequencies, is all that really exists. It is also calledthe Ocean of Awareness. Though we are experiencing it (and nothing but it) allthe time, we do not realize that we are. We are like the fish in the story,asking skeptically, “What is this thing called water?” The last thing a fishwould contemplate is the very medium of its existence. An ordinary being noticesleast that which is the greatest constant in his life. So, we pay littleattention to the nature of the one thing present in every experience:Consciousness. We don’t perceive the fullness and potency of the divine realityin which we constantly partake because we exist in a state of contractedawareness, our powers limited and our perception narrowed to a tiny bandwidth.To put it briefly, our brains synthesize an experience of reality through ourlimited senses, each of which functions as a different type of frequencyanalyzer directed at this fluxing field of energy all around us (and which weare not separate from). Sentient beings like us are simply nodal points ofself-awareness, recursive movements of energy in an otherwise undifferentiateddynamic field. As thinking beings, we perform analytic and synthetic mentaloperations in our contemplation of reality. Some of those operations rigidify,becoming more or less durable and persistent mental constructs, which we thenuse as filters to select and interpret what we think is significant in reality,thereby narrowing further our already limited spectrum of perception. Then wemake the final error of believing that the interpretive constructs wesuperimpose on reality are reality itself, instead of what they actually are,imperfect representations that served a particular need at a particular time.This wrong understanding causes us suffering. Indeed, it is the only cause ofsuffering.If the last paragraph was dense for you, don’t worry, it will be unpackedfurther as we go along.the names of the ultimate realityThis divine Consciousness is called by various names in the texts of thetradition. When talking about it as God, it is called Śiva or more commonlyParameśvara, “the highest Divinity.” But the nondualist scriptures usuallyprefer other names for it, because this is a principle that far transcends (evenas it includes) any notion of a personal God. Some of these follow.The names of the nondual Divine (= Śiva-Śakti in perfect fusion)the Heart (hṛdaya)the Essence (sāra)Vibration (spanda)Absolute Potential (visarga)the Bliss of Awareness (cidānanda)the All-Pervasive (vibhava)the Totality (kula)Intimate Fusion (saṅghaṭṭa)Vision (dṛk)Potency (sāmarthya)Experience (bhoga)the Fierce One (caṇḍī)the Supreme Power (parā śakti)the Devourer of Time (kālakarṣiṇī)the Word (vāk)the Wave (ūrmi)the Eternal (nityā)the Nameless (anākhya)We are told that the Absolute has many names so that at least one of them willspontaneously penetrate the inner awareness of the practitioner. Of these, NŚT’spreferred name for the supreme principle of reality is the Heart. (We mustdistinguish Heart, the core of being, from the emotional center. See the sectionon the Five-Layered Self[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-10_split_001.xhtml#fivelayer].)However, since the Tantrik masters do frequently use the word “God,” it isimportant to define exactly what that means in this context, for it is somethingquite different from what the word means in the minds of many Westerners.Abhinava Gupta offers us a nondual definition of “God” in his Essence of theTantras:In actuality it is only the unbounded Light of Consciousness, reposing in innatebliss, endowed with the Powers of Will, Knowledge, and Action, that we call God.(Essence of the Tantras)This profound statement will be unpacked in the pages to come.the essential nature of the divineNow, this infinite all-pervading Divine Consciousness is absolutely free andindependent (svatantra) and, in its self-aware mode, is spontaneously blissful(ānanda). Because you are not separate from That, your true nature is also freeand blissful, though you are usually not aware of it, for reasons we will cometo. Suffice to say now that the process of sādhanā (spiritual practice) issimply about removing the impediments to your ability to see yourself as youreally are and accessing the blissful freedom that is always already your realbeing.the activity of the divineWe have established that the fundamental nature of all beings is divine, and wehave established what the Divine is—a completely autonomous blissful awareness.So, what does it actually do? Its activity is also fundamental to its identity,and that activity is of course the creation (and dissolution) of the manifestuniverse. But what is creation, really? It is nothing but the projection, theflowing forth, within the infinite field of Consciousness, of a vastmultiplicity of apparently differentiated subjects and objects. Let’s definethis subject-object pole, this basic twoness that the One appears as. Eachobject (= something that can be known) is an actualization of a timelesspotentiality inherent in the Light of Consciousness (prakāśa). That is to say,each object is an embodiment of some facet of the One’s infinite being. Eachsubject (= any knower, a sentient being like you) also embodies that Light ofConsciousness, but is further a reflexive movement of self-awareness, aspecifically defined mode of the One’s self-reflection (vimarśa). That is, you(and every sentient being) incarnate a unique way for the One to reflect on itsSelf.reflection (vimarśa) andrecognition (pratyabhijñā)A few more words about this crucial principle. We said above that everythingthat exists is a manifestation of the one Light. Some embodiments of that Light,then, also have the capacity to enfold awareness and reflect on themselves or onother aspects of the Light in relation to themselves. These are what we callsentient beings, those nodal points of the energy field that can, as it were,fold light back onto itself in the act of self-reflection (vimarśa). And we canunderstand the term “self-reflection” both figuratively and literally here, forthe self-aware being realizes that all other beings are reflections of herself,as she is also a reflection of them, and that all are reflections of the oneSelf. For this reason, vimarśa can also be translated as “representation,” forit is the process by which Consciousness re-presents itself to itself in variousforms, as part of its overarching play of self-awareness and self-love.Thus for a sentient being, every encounter with any other being is anopportunity for reflecting on his own total nature. Recognizing yourself in theother being, and the other being in yourself, necessarily involves an expansionof your sense of identity. That is, it entails a realization that you haveartificially limited yourself to a set of mental constructs (such as any set of“I am” statements), and this realization is simultaneously an opportunity forthe expansion of your sense of identity. The process of expansion continuesuntil you experience yourself in all things, and all things in yourself—theunbounded state of absolute fullness (pūrṇatā) that is oneness with God andfinal realization. Then, you no longer perceive yourself as a mother or anAmerican or a doctor or a yogī but rather as the pattern of the whole universecurrently playing that role and no more identified with it than the actor onstage believes he is really Hamlet, even as he plays his part passionately.This perspective brings a sense of meaning and presence to even the simplestacts. For when you sit and contemplate a stone, what is really happening is thatthe universe is contemplating itself as “stone.” Your perception of yourself assomehow separate from the Whole is nothing but ignorance. This was therevelation had by a certain physicist who one day realized that, though hestudies fundamental particles (protons, electrons, neutrons), he himself wascomposed of the very same particles. He saw that because the universe is onecontinuous whole, his study of physics is nothing other than the universecontemplating itself. Yet to accomplish this act, the universe must temporarilyalienate part of itself from the whole in order to turn and look at itself; andthe process is not complete, he saw, until that portion turns its capacity forcontemplation upon itself, collapsing subject and object, and thus reintegratingitself with the Whole, which it actually never left.31[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en31]To recap, then, this infinite Consciousness chooses not to remain statichomogenous formless nothingness but rather condenses itself into form,manifesting itself (within the field of its own awareness) as a vastmultiplicity of apparently differentiated subjects and objects, thus initiatinga vast dance of self-exploration. Now, this act of creation is called a divineplay or game (krīḍā), in the sense that this activity is fundamentally a freeand joyous act of self-expression, done entirely for its own sake. The word“play” is simply used to indicate an activity that has no purpose outsideitself, as well as pointing toward the notion that joy and love underlie andmotivate the whole process. (For God so loved Herself, we could say, that Shegave form to every aspect of Her being.) The doctrine of play shows us that theTantrik View is not evolutionary, that it does not hold that reality will beintrinsically better or more beautiful at some future point (though yourcapacity to experience its beauty is always evolving!). The whole of divinereality is expressed fully in each moment. Rather than “play,” the Tāntrikascould have used the word “art” to express this understanding—for that word hasconnotations of creativity and beauty that are central to their vision ofreality—except that art is often thought of as representing something else, andthe universe stands for nothing but itself. Further, “art” implies artifice,while “play” or perhaps “artful play” better expresses the organic, spontaneous,dynamic quality with which the universe unfolds and, as well, alludes to thechildlike wonder experienced by those who see it as it really is. Ourdiscussions here are neatly summarized by the verse that concludes chapter 1 ofEssence of the Tantras:This Self is an embodiment of the Light of Consciousness; it is Śiva, free andautonomous. As an independent play of intense joy, the Divine conceals its owntrue nature [by manifesting plurality], and may also choose to reveal itsfullness once again at any time.32[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en32] (Essence of the Tantras)Thus, this play of manifest creation, in which the Divine freely bodies itselfforth as the universe, is the result of an impulse, a natural creative urge(icchā) within the Divine to express the totality of its self-knowledge (jñāna)in action (kriyā). These, then, are the three primary Powers (śaktis) of God,the three that denote what Śiva-Śakti does, as opposed to the even more basictriad above that denotes what Śiva-Śakti is (i.e., Consciousness, Bliss, andFreedom). The three Powers of Will, Knowledge, and Action naturally unfold inprecisely that sequence, for the precognitive creative impulse toward joyfulself-expression (icchā) must come first, surging up from the core of Being; andthen it must equip itself with understanding (jñāna), i.e., with informationabout how energy flows most effectively in embodied forms; and then it canengage in empowered activity (kriyā), inevitably achieving its consummation.This process unfolds in each instant on all scales.The natural question that most people have at this point is something like, “Ifthis whole world is nothing but the free and voluntary self-expression of thedivine Light, why is life so hard?” The problem with this question is that itdemonstrates a lack of understanding of nonduality, for it can only be asked bya mind that does not include “hard” as an aspect of divine Light, one that is asbeneficial and blessed in its own way as “easy” or “happy.” To put it anotherway, Śiva-consciousness rejoices equally in pain or pleasure, in happiness orsorrow, for both poles equally express its divine Being. God loves the whole ofthe creation that is himself, and since you are not separate from God, you havethe capacity to love the whole of reality as well. This, of course, is the“tough nut” of nondual philosophy, and it cannot be resolved throughintellectual understanding (which is rooted in duality), but only through astate of nondual experience brought about by dedicated spiritual practice. Withthis in mind, let’s explore a little more the perspective on suffering in NŚT.The View states, “When that divine Consciousness contracts into finite embodiedloci of awareness, out of its own free will, and those finite subjects thenidentify with the limited and circumscribed cognitions that make up this phaseof their existence, instead of identifying with the transindividual overarchingpulsation of pure Awareness that is their true nature, they experience what theycall ‘suffering’.”Let’s break that statement down. It is simply saying that suffering is a resultof your ignorance of your own true nature. Here we must distinguish sufferingfrom pain. There’s nothing wrong with pain; it is both natural and beautiful.Natural in that it is a feedback mechanism by which nature protects us, andbeautiful when it shows us our aliveness. For example, the intensity of the painyou feel when a loved one passes away is another form of your love forthem—experienced in that way, it becomes a thing of sharp beauty. Suffering,however, is a mental state we could represent with statements like “This sucks!”“I hate this,” “I wish this wasn’t happening,” or “I don’t deserve this!” Mostof what is unpleasant about human existence is not pain, but mind-createdsuffering. And we can be free of this suffering, for the scriptures tell us itis entirely a product of ignorance, of not seeing things as they truly are. Theprimary form of this ignorance is our misidentification of ourselves. Thismisidentification is a kind of forgetting: God incarnates as you, and in orderto specifically become you, She has to forget the rest of her vastall-encompassing being. In other words, to fully manifest the particular aspectof herself that you are, She has to temporarily let go of all the other aspectsof herself. This is the self-concealment mentioned in Abhinava’s verse above.So, here you are: What you see of yourself, what you know of yourself, is simplythe tip of a massive iceberg (to use one analogy). You look around, and all youcan see is what shows above the water, so you imagine that’s all there is. Yet,the sages tell us, the pattern of the whole universe, of all that is, isimprinted on the deepest level of your being. You are not only part of thewhole, you are the Whole. Realizing this brings the experience of joyous freedombecause you perceive that with infinite options available to Her, Consciousnesschose to become you. And furthermore, you are not a static entity but a dancingpattern of energy, an unfolding process—a perfect and integral instantiation ofthe divine process by which God reflects on herself and expresses herself.To attain all the fulfillment you’ve ever dreamed of and more, you simply needto see the truth of your own Being: that infinite potential exists within you,for you are an expression of the Divine, and whatever manifests through you inthis life, though not infinite, is to be honored as what you alone can add tothe ever-expanding process of God’s grand self-exploration. Suffering willautomatically fall away when you are able to simultaneously honor what iscurrently manifesting through you (the tip of your iceberg) as well as the wholeof your divine being, a fullness you may not be able to “see” but can learn topalpably feel. Abhinava gives this teaching in the summary verse of theintroduction to his Essence of the Tantras:Tradition teaches us that ignorance is the sole cause of bondage: it is taughtunder the name “impurity” in scripture. When the power of all-encompassinginsight arises, it is completely uprooted. With the arising of the fullconsciousness of the Self, by which all impurity is destroyed, there isliberation.33 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en33] (Essenceof the Tantras)Those who gain an intimation of the fact that they are not seeing the fullpicture of reality will at some point feel an inner urge (icchā) to take up thepath of the cultivation of spiritual wisdom (jñāna) and practice (kriyā). Thepurpose of walking the spiritual path, from the nondual Tantrik perspective, issimply to undermine your misidentification and directly reveal within theimmediacy of your awareness the fact that the divine Powers of Consciousness,Bliss, Willing, Knowing, and Acting comprise the totality of your individualexperience as well—thereby triggering a recognition that your true identity isthat of the highest Divinity, the Whole in every part.Let’s unpack that. The purpose of spiritual practice could not be to attainunion with God, for you are already one with the divine reality. Neither is itspurpose to make you more beautiful or more perfect, for nothing exists that isnot God, so you cannot be more beautiful or more perfect than you already are.Yet you are not currently experiencing reality that way, due to yourmisperception of yourself. So, the primary purpose of spiritual practice is todestabilize deep-seated, skewed mental constructs about yourself, constructsthat you also project onto others in your life. These visions of reality are notin alignment with the Truth and therefore debilitate you. The process ofundermining false views through practice continues until they are seen for whatthey are and begin to fall apart. When your obscuring mental constructs fallaway, you automatically see yourself as you really are: a free being of blissfulconsciousness, playing with your powers of intent, understanding, and action.When you see yourself clearly, there comes a flash of recognition: you are amicrocosmic expression of precisely the same divine powers that create,maintain, and dissolve this whole universe. When you experientially realize thatthe same beautiful and awesome powers that orchestrate the intricate andwondrous display of this entire creation are flowing within you, creating youeven as you create with them, providing the very foundation of your wholeexperience of reality, there is a profound shift. Your fear and pettiness dropaway as you harmoniously fall into the dance of life energy, realizing that youhave been the only one who has ever limited your potential. An explosion of joyaccompanies the realization that there is nothing to do, nothing to achieve,other than to fully embrace the divine powers that seek to manifest through youby expressing the entirety of your authentic being in the fullness of eachmoment, in an endless flow of such moments.This state of awareness in which you are completely in tune with reality,immersed in your divine nature, is called samāveśa. You have touched this state,however fleetingly or incompletely, many times in your life. Recognize it asthat state in which you are fully present with yourself and your surroundings,relaxed yet focused, expansive and free yet grounded in your realsituation—embracing the reality of what is in the now. What is important aboutthis state, from the Tantrik perspective, is not so much how good it feels butwhat you learn from it and how you grow from integrating it.Is it really possible to be in such a state—that we may call Presence—all thetime, or are the uppermost reaches of human potential impossible to sustain? Theanswer given by the Tantra is that it is, indeed, possible for Presence tobecome your default state. This does not imply that it is a static condition orthat it does not need refreshing. Nevertheless, just as your default perceptionof reality is currently one of subject/object duality, with occasionalrevelations of the unity of being, that situation can become reversed, evenpermanently reversed, because unity is in fact the more fundamental reality. So,we may say that spiritual practice serves to repeat and reinforce experientialknowing of the Truth through various methods, until this vision of realitybecomes the nonconceptual ground of every moment of your experience. That meansit has passed beyond the level of philosophy and religion, beyond the level ofwords and thought, and has become a vibrating reality at the foundation of yourbeing, spontaneously illuminating all that you experience. When this happens,your contracted sense of self and separation from the Whole is finallyannihilated in the incandescent radiance of complete expansion intoall-embracing perfect wholeness (pūrṇatā). Then, as Abhinava Gupta tells us,your perception fully encompasses the reality of a universe dancing ecstaticallyin the animation of its completely perfect divinity. This is liberation. This isawakening to the Truth. This is why you took birth.thoughts to live bythe basic philosophical framework of nondual śaiva tantraPhilosophers use a handful of special terms to denote the central questionscontemplated by those who wish to understand reality. We will learn them nowbecause they are conveniently precise and concise, and besides, you can impressyour friends with them.ONTOLOGY – What is the fundamental nature of reality? What is “being”? What canwe say about existence?EPISTEMOLOGY – How do we know anything? What are the valid means of knowledge?How can we test what we think we know?TELEOLOGY – Is there a specific purpose to existence? Is it evolving toward anend point? Are things progressing?PHENOMENOLOGY – What is the nature of conscious experience? Does the content andquality of our moment-to-moment experiences give us any access to enduringtruth(s)?THEODICY – If there is a God, how do we explain suffering? What is the purposeof evil? How can evil and suffering exist if the all-pervasive Divine isfundamentally good?We will explore each of these questions briefly in plain and accessiblelanguage. I should mention that the mode of our discussion here is not straightphilosophy but what is called philosophical theology because it includes theDivine as an axiom, or at least a variable, in the mix. Furthermore, some ofthese questions—which are all central to Western philosophy—are not addressed ina systematic manner in the Tantrik literature but through a variety of sometimescryptic statements that I have wrestled with over the years. So, I amparticularly grateful to one of my teachers, Ādyashānti, for clarifications ofseveral of these issues, explanations that deeply connected to both mycontemplated experience and my scriptural study.ontologyThe topic of ontology (and the related ones of cosmology and metaphysics) ispartially covered above in the summary of the View, and further explored in “TheCategories of Tantrik Thought,” so we will not address it separately here.epistemologyOne of the central concerns of philosophy is to investigate how we know what weknow, if there is such a thing as certain knowledge, and, if so, how it isattained. This is a topic of concern to the Tantra as well, and it is exploredin depth by the scholar-sages Utpala Deva and Abhinava Gupta. The difficult andabstruse nature of these discussions invite us to focus on a simpler formulationoffered by the second author in his Essence of the Tantras. There Abhinava tellsus that the process of creative contemplation or holistic meditative inquiry(bhāvanā-krama) that leads to experiential knowing of reality is based on thesethree supports:❖ sound and careful reflection on your experience (sat-tarka)❖ the guidance of a great teacher (sad-guru) who is skilled in meditativeenquiry and has attained its fruit❖ the wisdom of the scriptures (sad-āgama)When these three come together in agreement, Abhinava suggests, we know we havearrived at truth. One or two of them is insufficient for certainty. In fact,allowing ourselves to abide in uncertainty about anything not supported by allthree keeps us open and in a process of learning that closes down if weprematurely decide that we know.Usually in Indian philosophy, the first two valid means of knowledge that areargued for are direct perception and valid inference; here they are combinedinto sat-tarka, which means the process of drawing sound conclusions based onone’s experience. In logic (both Western and Indian), a conclusion is “sound”when the premises are true and the structure of thought leading to theconclusion is valid. To give a slightly modified version of the standard Indianexample of a logical argument:Premise 1: Where there is smoke, there is fire (axiom based on the aggregate ofone’s experiences).Premise 2: There is smoke on the mountain over there (direct observation).Conclusion: Therefore, there is fire on the mountain.The argument is called valid structurally because if the premises are true, theconclusion must also be true. But it is only sound (= correct) if the premisesare in fact true. And this particular argument is an example of inferencebecause there is no way to be one hundred per cent sure that there is alwaysfire whenever and wherever there is smoke. The standard argument in the Indiansystem of logic is not deduction, which seeks to establish irrefutablecertainty, but inference. Unlike in Western philosophy, in the Indian system younever decide that you know for sure, and so you never completely close yourselfto unguessed possibilities. Thus the sense of wonder and openness that is thefoundation of all philosophy is maintained.The problem of direct experience as a means of knowledge is that people oftendraw conclusions based on their experience that are logically invalid. Theydon’t realize they are doing so because their assumptions and the process bywhich they draw their conclusions usually go unexamined. Even more basically,they are often unable to separate their experience from their interpretation.People can get ruffled when their interpretation of their experience isquestioned, saying, “But that’s my experience!” In fact, anything you can say inwords about your experience is an interpretation, not the experience itself. Onthe path of inquiry into truth, we never devalue or dispense with reflection onour personal experience (note that Abhinava mentions it first), yet since wecannot be one hundred per cent certain about the conclusions we draw or howuniversally applicable they are, we soften our iron grip on our apparently safeand comfortable sense of certainty and seek to corroborate it with trustedauthorities: the teacher and sacred scripture.To some Westerners, having the spiritual teacher and scripture as the other twolegs of the tripod seems redundant. But this system of checks and balances iswell worked out. Scripture exists as a representative document of a wholecommunity; because even if a given scripture was written by just one person, itis transmitted (copied and recopied) for centuries if and only if some of itscontents are effective for a wider group of people. As a document of collectivewisdom perpetuated by community, scripture protects you from an aberrant teacherwho preaches his own idiosyncratic experience as if it were universal, therebypotentially leading you astray. Of course, for this setup to work, you must reada scripture with your own judgment, not solely on the basis of the teacher’sinterpretation of it.On the other hand, though scriptures are presumed to have been written by anawakened master, a healthy skepticism is maintained by requiring their wisdom tobe corroborated by the other two sources of knowledge. Further, the requirementof the living teacher means that you are protected from an off-the-wallinterpretation of scripture you arrived at in your own head. Such aninterpretation might make sense to you, might even feel good, but is seen by theteacher with clear long-term view to be one that will eventually take you offtrack. Such a teacher will rarely say, “You’re wrong,” but will more likelychallenge you to contemplate deeper, beyond your conditioned mind.This system of double corroboration for valid knowledge allows us to come upwith seeds of wisdom that we can count on and build a spiritual life on. But theprocess is not completed until these seeds come to life as living, vibratingwisdom within us. That is, in the Tantra, we seek not just to know wisdom but tofully embody it. The evidence that you have done so is that you no longer needthe external form of the teaching (the words or concepts); it has simplyblossomed into living experience, unsupported by any reminders. When thishappens, then no matter how beautiful the words of the teaching are, they seemto be flat or pale or inadequate in comparison with the actual experience. Wediscuss this final, subtle criterion for true wisdom elsewhere in the book.teleologyMany religions are teleological, that is, they say there is a purpose to life, apurpose to the creation of the universe, a Grand Plan. This vision of thingsusually entails the notion that things will one day be better, both for youpersonally (such as when you die and go to heaven) and for the whole world (suchas when the savior comes). NŚT is unusual, then, in denying and/or challengingteleology. It clearly denies teleology of the second kind, on the universalscale, for it teaches that the fullness of divine reality is present here andnow: there is no future moment when God will be more fully revealed than S/Healready is. This antiteleological stance is called the doctrine of divine play,or krīḍā, mentioned above. The universe is said to be a divine play not in thesense that it is always fun (obviously) but rather in the strict sense of theword “play,” that is, anything done for its own sake rather than for anafter-the-fact result. And it is a play in another sense, in that there existsthe possibility for joy (ānanda) in any and every experience, though some yieldup that potential more easily than others. By joy here I do not mean “extremehappiness,” but rather a kind of loving acceptance of any given present-momentreality. The Heart has an innate capacity to grant a deep affirmation ofwhatever is going on in this moment, to envelop the whole of each experience inloving awareness (even experiences that the mind despises). When it exercisesthat capacity, it is called ānanda.It is not all that surprising that the Tantra denies universal teleology, sinceIndian philosophy has always seen time as cyclical rather than linear. However,there is a kind of individual teleology in this tradition, seen in the claimthat spiritual awakening and the initiation that follows it guarantee youreventual liberation. This is on the one hand a claim intended to ensure thesuccess of the religion, but on the other hand it acknowledges a deep truth: theprocess of awakening to your real divine nature, once set in motion, willinevitably bear its fruit. Even if you reject and scorn the path totally, it isargued, eventually divine grace will prevail and you will find your way back tothe path, even in a future life. This is partially because once the power offull awakening has been glimpsed, even if the memory of it lies dormant, nothingelse will seem totally worthwhile in comparison.This notion of the inevitability of the process gives rise to two possiblemisunderstandings. First, that nothing need be done by one who desiresliberation, and second, that the process leading to liberation is necessarily agradual progression. These misunderstandings are corrected by two teachings. Thefirst is that the process unfolds through a combination of grace andself-effort. Grace ensures that the conditions for its unfolding are met;self-effort determines the speed and efficiency of the process. Self-efforttakes the form of the cultivation of insight or yogic practice or (morecommonly) both. Without self-effort, the blossoming of your awakening occurs atan infinitesimal rate. At the same time, if your effort has the quality ofstriving toward a distant goal, you are wasting a lot of energy. The effort inquestion here is the gentle effort required to no longer hold on to your limitedknowledge.The second teaching is linked to the first. Though the process of yourliberation unfolds gradually, at any moment it may complete itself through asudden leap of all-encompassing insight. This is possible because awakening toyour real nature is not the result of a certain specific amount of spiritualpractice. Furthermore, if we consider full awakeness as a far distant goal, tobe attained after much striving, then that is what it will be. Instead, we areinvited to gently hold the awareness, that it could be as close as our nextbreath—and then to take the next breath as an opening to that possibility.But, we protest: it can’t be that close, because I have so much work to do, somany unresolved issues and unhealed wounds. In so protesting, we forget that ourreal nature, by definition, is always available to us in some measure. Accessingit does not depend on solving any problem or healing any wound. (Though it isalso true that those wounds, or rather our beliefs about them, can impede therecognition that this divine core is our real being—and this recognition isnecessary to end our habitual return to the limited story of the separate self.)This understanding is crucial, for when people hear about the possibility ofliberation, they almost always imagine that such a thing could only be theresult of solving their problems and healing their wounds. But your real naturewas never wounded, so why should accessing it be dependent on completing yourtherapy? This misunderstanding leads to putting the cart before the horse, anddevoting an inordinate amount of energy to figuring out and fixing a “self” thatis not the real you.In fact, what often happens is this: you wake up out of the false belief thatthe limited, conditioned self is you, and then that limited self—whose locus isthe mind—slowly begins to reflect the new state of affairs. That is, the mindbegins to align itself to the vibration of your real nature, now that the powerof your awareness is focused there instead of on the mind. Though awakening canhappen in a moment, there is a (sometimes lengthy) period of integration as themind dissolves some belief structures and reorganizes others to come intoharmony with the new realization that it is not what it thought it was—that itis not the real you. Depending on the type of awakening you’ve had, this processcan be easeful or deeply disorienting and unsettling. If the latter, there needsto be frequent remembering that it is just the mind that is unsettled, for inyour real Self or essence-nature, you are always completely okay.At this point, we need some clarification to avoid the problem of “spiritualbypassing,” whereby some people say, “I don’t need to work on myself at allbecause my real nature is unconditioned Light, not this messy mind that hasnothing to do with the real Me.” This is a dangerous delusion, and it iscountered by the following teaching. As described above, you first wake up toyour individual essence-nature, that is, the way God vibrates uniquely in and asyou, unaffected by all your conditioning. Second, the mind or conditioned selfneeds to come into alignment with this essence-nature or else you end up with akind of split personality: a divine you and a messed-up you. There is nointegration. No matter how good you are at accessing the divine you, themessed-up mind keeps getting triggered by life situations, and that is whatother people experience from you. So, even if you have access to your divinecore, if its energy is not flowing forth and blessing your mind and body andothers around you, you are not liberated. Tantra utterly rejects the goal ofPatañjali’s yoga, that of retreating to and dwelling in a divine soul that issafely removed and cut off from the world. Therefore, awakening is not completeuntil the body-mind is clear and strong and healed enough to be a vessel for theflowing forth of the divine energy of the Core. Tantra seeks to develop a“healthy ego,” which is a servant of the divine Core. But as mentioned, thatstrengthening and healing of the body-mind is far easier and more joyful oncethere has been some degree of awakening to your essence-nature, which is why thelatter is given priority. When your individual awakening and correspondingliberation of the body-mind are complete (called āṇava-samāveśa), only then canyou properly proceed to the next level of awakening, that of unity with allthings, in which your individual divinity is realized as an expression ofuniversal divinity, and thus dissolves into the universal field of energy (arealization called śākta-samāveśa).For the Tantra, awakening (bodha) and liberation (mokṣa) are real, and they arethe key concepts that drive the whole of the spiritual life. But there is asubtle and significant point here: as concepts, as goals, as destinations, theymust eventually be transcended. After reaching a certain level of development,we discover that the simple teleology implied by the concept of liberation wasactually a teaching tool. That is, the teaching that there is such a thing as“liberation” galvanizes a new seeker on the spiritual path and sets in motion aprocess that is inevitably beneficial, even though the seeker’s concept ofliberation as a “thing” that she will one day attain is itself false. What wediscover is that instead of walking a path to reach a specific finaldestination, we are walking it to learn how to walk it. The moment we fall intosimple harmony with the walking, dissolving ideas about our destination or ouridentity as a walker, path and goal merge into one. In other words, liberationis complete when we are no longer waiting to be liberated. But that is not ateaching that is useful for beginners, since it can undermine their beneficialdedication to practice and encourage spiritual bypassing. Rather, it is ateaching the guru presents to individuals who have been successful in theirpractice but are still striving after their concept instead of surrendering towhat’s already there for them.In this sense, then, even individual “progression” on the path, in the sense ofprogressing from point A to point B, is an illusion. You are moving through aprocess, yes, and there is a kind of directionality to your moving, but it isnot an evolution to some better state of being as much as it is a dissolving ofthat which prevents you from recognizing the truth that has always been right infront of you. So, to conclude, future-focused teleology as conceived by mostreligions is downplayed or at least nuanced by NŚT, even as it is affirmed that1) there is such a thing as awakening; 2) if you’re not yet fully awake andfree, you can be (indeed, you will be, if that is your heart’s desire); and 3)NŚT offers you the necessary guidance to experientially actualize that reality.phenomenologyPhenomenology asks, what is the truth-value of experience? What and how far canour subjective experience tell us about reality? Here I will not be exploring afavorite subject of phenomenology, how consciousness encounters the world, sinceI do that later. Instead I will address the role of experience, especiallyspiritual experience, in a nondual philosophy.Quite simply, since reality is One, and everything is equally an expression ofthat one divine Light of Consciousness, every experience by definition is anexperience of God. As the scriptures say, “Śiva is the substance of everyexperience whatsoever.” Now, some interpreters of the tradition say, “Everythingis God, but some things are more God than others.” This is as nonsensical as thefamous quote from Animal Farm, “Everyone is equal, but some are more equal thanothers.” If we propose that some things are more God than others, likeconcentrated orange juice versus watered-down orange juice, then we must alsopropose the existence of something that is not God that waters down divinity.But no such thing can be found, at least in this philosophy, because 1) thedefinition of God here is the unbounded Light of Consciousness, 2) everythingthat is known to exist is an object of experience, and 3) every experience is bydefinition pervaded by consciousness.Therefore, this—whatever is happening right now—is as God as it gets. Now, ifyou are in a miserable or banal life situation, you may be disappointed by thisannouncement. But notice I said, “This is as God as it gets,” not, “This is asfree as it gets.” Freedom means actually experiencing the divinity in eachmoment, which is the same as not wanting the present moment to be any differentfrom the way it is. When you don’t want any moment to be any different, then youare no longer struggling (or even waiting) for a better situation, and thereforeyou are free to fully show up for what is actually happening now. Paradoxically,this reveals the inherent joy of consciousness, because by not strugglingagainst some part of reality, you see and meet the whole of the moment, and younaturally enjoy it to the maximum extent you are capable of in that moment.Ultimate freedom, then, is not an experience or a state of mind. It can’t be,because no experience or state of mind is permanent. An experience, howevergreat and wonderful, cannot be the goal of the spiritual path, for as soon as itis gone, you want it again, and then you are not free—and radical freedom is theavowed goal of all yoga. So, this leads us to the necessary conclusion thatpleasurable experience, however refined and pure, cannot be more divine thananything else. The pursuit of spiritual “highs” is not the path of yoga, Tantrikor otherwise. Nor is final liberation the result of a high experience. It is theresult of total surrender of all your grasping, total opening to what is beyondall your stories.So, what’s all this talk about ānanda, or bliss, in the Tantrik tradition?Simple: ānanda is the most common by-product of this deep surrender and openingto reality as it is. In fact, it is more than that: ānanda is a very importantfeedback mechanism for consciousness. If you believe you have given up yourstruggle and accepted what is and you do not experience ānanda (joy, relief,profound contentment, or similar) as a result, then that means you have actuallysurrendered to your dominant story about reality, rather than to reality itself.Surrendering to your story makes you feel defeated and depressed. Seeing thingsas they really are, and giving the full heart’s consent to reality as it is,always results in some form of ānanda, whether subtle, soft, sweet relief orastonishing, ecstatic, expansive joy. Ānanda in whatever form is what tells youthat you have had a true seeing and a true dying away of your grasping limitedself into divine reality. But, and this can hardly be said too many times,ānanda is simply the chief by-product of realization, it is not the goal of thepath, and it is not more divine than anything else. If you think otherwise, youwill starting grasping after it and building a new “spiritual” self-image aroundit, and then you are caught again. Probably the greatest pitfall on thespiritual path is confusing the by-products of realization with that whichproduces them, and this is why nondual Tantra clearly posits the goal of thepath as Truth, not happiness. Make true seeing your goal, and more bliss thanyou can imagine will arise as a by-product of that journey; but the moment yoursights shift to bliss as the goal, delusion begins to reassert itself. This isthe key teaching that shortens the duration of the whole spiritual process morethan any other single teaching, so I strongly advise you to work it deep inside.the role of desire in a nondual viewYou may object that Tantra famously legitimates human desire, even viewing it asa means to liberation, instead of negating it as other yogas do. Desire is, ofcourse, just as divine as anything else, but for it to become a means toliberation, there must be right View toward it. Why would the Tantra bother tolegitimate the common variety of delusion-based desire, seeing that it has neverbrought true and lasting freedom to anyone? As we explore later, ordinary desireis binding for it reinforces the false view that you are not already complete asyou are, that you are something separate from the object of your desire. Desirebecomes a vehicle to your liberation when you trace it back to its source andrealize that your desire for some external situation (whether a car, a spouse,whatever) is really a desire for the feeling, the flavor of consciousness, thathaving that thing will bring you; or, to be more accurate, the feeling that youbelieve having that thing will bring you. All desire boils down to thefundamental desire for the fullness of being; in other words, all longing islonging for God. As suggested above, this fullness of being is not accomplishedby a quantitative accumulation of good experiences. It is your natural state,and in terms of desire, it is accessed by finding the primal root of yourdesire, far deeper than any particular wanting, and letting it explode with therealization that ultimately you simply desire to be the whole of what you are.The intensity of this desire has the power to shatter the confines of theconstructed self, for it is not satisfied until it is connected to everything.In this way, desire becomes a vehicle of your liberation.Whenever you are centered in the real core of your being, a completely differentkind of desire can arise: the “pure desire” that is a natural flowing forth ofyour essence-nature into embodied action. It does not seek to grasp somethingand bring it in. It is the opposite movement: an impulse to share yourself, toconnect your innate vibration with the world. This desire does not limit orcontract you, for it does not arise from self-image but from a much deeperplace. This is the kind of desire that the Tantra honors unreservedly, thelonging not only to be your Self but to act in the world as a beautifulexpression of that Self.theodicyOne of the most difficult—and interesting—questions in the study of spiritualphilosophy is often phrased like this: “If God is wholly good and all-powerful,how can there be evil, how can there be suffering?” This form of the question oftheodicy presumes an all-powerful personal deity separate from his creation whocould intervene to prevent suffering but chooses not to. Who could ever worshipsuch a God, I wonder, without simultaneously resenting him? The wholeorientation to the question is fundamentally different for nondualism, whichdenies that kind of separate deity. Let’s explore how this question can bemeaningfully answered in a nondual context.First off, Tantrik philosophy shifts the terms of the discussion by denying thatevil exists at all. That is, both “good” and “evil” are conceptual structuresthat people overlay onto reality; they are not inherent in reality itself. Butwhy do these concepts arise, and to what aspect of reality do they relate?“Good” is a label that we give to human beings or human institutions thatperform actions that, in our estimation, benefit others or in some way make lifemore wonderful for people. Conversely, “evil” is a label we give to those whoseactions, in our estimation, are detrimental or make life more painful forothers. But both of these oversimplifying, reductionist labels alienate us fromthe real humanity of those that we are labeling by sanctifying or demonizingpeople who are, in actuality, doing exactly the same thing that you are doingevery day of your life: that is, trying to find some happiness and freedom inthe best way they know how.That phrase is the key to the issue, for the factor that is actually operativehere, differentiating those we wish to call “evil” from those we wish to call“good,” is their relative degree of ignorance of the true nature of reality. Twotypes of ignorance are operative here: the nonconceptual ignorance that isdisconnection from essence-nature, and the conceptual ignorance that is a set ofinterpretations of reality that is not actually in alignment with reality. Thesetwo forms of ignorance are related because the second is built on the foundationof the first.Those who are deeply disconnected from their own real nature, and are thusunable to tap into the inexhaustible wellspring of joy, love, and inspiration attheir core, will express this inner disconnection and alienation in actions thatothers find difficult and painful. Furthermore, the disconnected person willevolve a worldview corresponding to their inner experience, one in whichhappiness is something they have to obtain from outside, something they have tofight for. Being disconnected from themselves, they are likewise disconnectedfrom others, and therefore it seems perfectly logical to them to try to obtainwealth and happiness for themselves at any expense to others. Society andreligion try to change such people by telling them that they will reap what theysow, that harm to others will come back on them, but such moralizing misses thepoint: that is not the way disconnected individuals experience reality. Theydon’t feel their connections to all other living things, so such moralizingappears to them as a thinly veiled attempt to control their actions and limittheir freedom, and they rebel against it. When we label such people as “evil,”we shut down the possibility of understanding their experience, and we shut downthe possibility of compassion, which is particularly sad because only acts ofcompassion and love furnish the compelling counter-evidence to a disconnectedperson that might begin to change his view. In other words, the only way forthis disconnected self-concealment and concomitant misalignment to start tocorrect itself is for the individual to have an experience that gives himconcrete evidence of another way of seeing and understanding reality, a way thatdemonstrates greater value because it is more effective in meeting his deepestneeds. This is why we call love a transcendent principle: it is the appropriateresponse to both love and hate.There are others whom we praise and call saints: those who can loveunconditionally, those whose actions uplift others and make life more wonderfulfor many who come into contact with them. But such people are simply expressingtheir inner experience of profound connection to the source of love and insight.When we put them on the pedestal of sainthood or greatness, we distanceourselves from our capacity to access that same source. If you seek “the good”for yourself and for others, the only sustainable way of actualizing that goalis through a palpable, living connection to a level of being on whichcontributing to the well-being of others is the easiest and most natural thingyou could possibly do. This is why, from a spiritual perspective, the mosteffective political, social, or environmental activism is awakening to your truenature and helping others awaken. Indeed, in the long run, it is the onlyeffective method, for awakened ones naturally exist in harmony with their totalenvironment (because they never use their personal will to resist the largerpattern, because they are the larger pattern). All our political, social, andenvironmental controls are simply attempts to compensate for our lack ofawakeness, and as external superimpositions, they ultimately fail in exactproportion to the degree of unawakeness in the people they aim to control.So, everyone, everywhere, is doing exactly the same thing: living in preciseaccordance with their view of reality and trying to maximize their happiness andfreedom in the most effective way they can see from within their worldview. Andtheir view is built upon the basis of their experience, so arguing with it doesno good (unless you know them well enough to base your argument on elements oftheir experience). Since everyone is doing the same thing, how can we call someevil and others good? We can say that some are more ignorant and others less so,because it is factually true that the strategies by which disconnected personspursue their happiness will not be successful, but they believe that they willbe successful. Thus, it is fair to say that they are in a temporary state ofmisalignment. As the teaching states: All beings are Śiva, in relative degreesof self-concealment or self-revelation.This brings us to the question of suffering. Having granted that there is nosuch thing as evil, we naturally turn to the question of why there must besuffering. Why not create a universe in which suffering is not a possibility?This form of the question presumes a dualism between creator and created that isnot operative here. If we alter it to the question of why the universe iscreated in such a way as to allow for the full range of possibilities, from themost horrific to the most sublime, then we have the sort of question that was ofgreater interest to the Tantrik thinkers.Consciousness, we learn, is innately autonomous by nature. Since it is the firstprinciple, it is subject to no limitations; rather, any and all limitations areproduced by it as the framework in which it moves. It is free to exist in anymode, which is why no one else has the power to determine your inner state.Naturally, when Consciousness embodies itself as a universe, that universe willalso display the same nature of openness to any and every possibility: awide-open playing field. What mechanism could there be to impede the expressionof contracted forms of consciousness while simultaneously allowing theexpression of expanded forms? In fact, it is crucial that all forms ofconsciousness have the power of self-expression, because that is the primarymode through which consciousness learns about itself. If the consequences ofignorance were not permitted to arise, how would it mature into wisdom?You might think, “I’d rather people have less autonomy than see all thissuffering.” That is of course the principle on which laws are enacted andprisons filled: given the amount of ignorance about, we’d better curtailpeople’s ability to act on their ignorance. One way to show the flaw in thisthinking is to take it to its logical conclusion. A friend of mine in college,where we both studied religion, thought up a parable to demonstrate that we willalways ultimately choose freedom and the full range of possibilities itincludes, even if it means suffering. It’s called the parable of the DreamMachine. He said, “Imagine you live in a dimension where you have total control.Nothing happens without your permission, and everything you want to happenhappens. For a while, you’d probably enjoy innumerable pleasures and luxuries.Then, after not so very long, you’d get bored, and you’d invent adventures foryourself that seemed to include challenge, such as rescuing a damsel from afire-breathing dragon. But even that would pale eventually, because you’realways in control. The challenge isn’t real, because there is no possibility offailing. Sooner or later, you fall into boredom, ennui, and jaded lassitude—inother words, all the signs of a consciousness in stagnancy. Then one day, amagical machine appears that you didn’t put there. There’s a big button on itand next to the button a sign. The sign says,The Dream Machine“If you push this button, anything could happen: joys beyond your wildestdreams, and fears beyond your darkest nightmares; or more probably, both. If youpush it you will forget you pushed it and be plunged into a world of infinitepossibility. Will you take the chance? Will you go on the adventure?”At this point my friend turned to me and said the phrase that gave me chills ofrecognition: “The question is not whether you’ll push the button. It’s just, howlong will you wait?”This story shows so effectively that as much as we think we would be happybending the world entirely to our individual will, we would not. It is only bygiving full range to the all the possibilities within consciousness that it candiscern the true pattern of its being. As one of my teachers says, it is only bygranting the whole world its freedom to be exactly as it is that you can befree.Having explored the innate autonomy of Consciousness that allows for both wisdom(full self-awareness) and ignorance (partial self-concealment) and for thealigned and misaligned actions that arise from them respectively, we are stillleft with the question of why there is ignorance in the first place. Why doesthe mode of concealment arise at all? Almost all Indian philosophy evades thisquestion, stating that ignorance is beginningless and thus we cannot address thequestion of a cause. Tantrik philosophy, however, has an interesting answer forthose who care to dig for it. It observes that when the universal, the formlessAbsolute, moves into the particularity of form, each form is necessarilylimited; that is, it expresses certain qualities by negating others. To manifestX is to suppress or withdraw all that is not X. To manifest Steve is to withdrawinto the formless ground all that is not Steve. The problem comes when aself-aware bit of consciousness like you or me surveys its manifest limitedbeing and makes the assumption that this is all there is to it. But this is notall there is to it because the formless ground of infinite possibility is in youas well—as the very root of your being. In other words, orienting to the mosttangible and obvious level of reality (your body, thoughts, etc.), which is alsothe level of maximal difference from other forms, you start to identify withthat level and thereby lose awareness of the subtle dimensions of your beingwherein the pattern of the whole universe is encoded. Seeing only part of thewhole but taking it to be the Whole is what we mean by ignorance, and ignorancegives rise to suffering because it entails a misalignment with reality as it is.Why does this assumption, which leads to limited identification, which leads tosuffering, get made? We could say that the motive force of the universe is love.It is out of love for itself that Consciousness bodies itself forth as auniverse, and it is out of love that it allows for the total range ofpossibilities in that universe (because to negate any possibility would be toreject that aspect of itself). The beginning point of limited identification isalso love: when Consciousness finds itself in a body, it is as it were soenamored of its creation that it temporarily forgets the rest of itself. It thenis no longer seeing the whole and gets caught in partial (limited)identification. (An innocent mistake with not-so-innocent consequences down theline.) That limited form of consciousness then receives (as it were) “signals”from reality that it is out of alignment, signals we often characterize as“suffering.” Being a limited form of consciousness, it takes a while for thereal import of these signals to sink in, at which point Consciousness starts towake up to the whole of itself. This whole process, which seems to us to takeages, is really just a brief moment, a blip of misunderstanding, on the largertimescale of the universe.So, most pain and all suffering is part of a feedback mechanism that theuniverse uses to warn you of a misalignment. We do not object to having bodiesthat feel pain when we touch something red-hot, because we know that painprotects us. Mental suffering can be more acute and difficult to bear thanphysical pain because it points us toward deep misalignments in ourthought-structures. As it turns out, most human suffering is mind-createdsuffering, that is, it arises from clinging to stories that are not in alignmentwith reality. If a way of looking at a situation causes you to suffer and bringsyou into division and conflict, then that’s all the evidence you need to markthat perspective as misaligned and begin to release it. “But surely some formsof pain are perfectly natural,” the objectioner says. “You can’t think that thepain of losing a loved one is indicative of a misalignment.” If the pain inquestion is unbearable despair and depression, yes; it indicates that there is amisaligned story in place such as “I’ll never be happy without him.” When thereis no story to turn pain into suffering, the pain of loss is a thing of sharpbeauty, fully welcomed by the clear and awake one as another form of her love.It passes through her without resistance and therefore does not get stuck.Since all suffering, from a twinge of anger to agonizing guilt, is a feedbackmechanism, all suffering is welcomed by the awake one as a gift and a blessing.Not in the artificial Pollyanna sense of “Oh, it’s really okay, I’m fine, let’slook on the bright side, somehow it’ll turn out okay,” but in the sense that nomatter how much it hurts in the moment, she knows that it is part of a honingprocess which is perfectly calibrated to eventually center her in herunconditional freedom and love. It is a process that works insofar as we lookinto what the feedback is asking us to be aware of. Often we do not. We just tryto get past the suffering; in which case it will arise again, and again, untilwe look into what we are being shown about the way we are holding reality. Themoment you see clearly how you—and no one else—are responsible for yoursuffering, and how your view of things creates it, an irrevocable process hasbegun that will not stop until it has brought to an end all mind-createdsuffering.Because everything contributes to this process, which tends only to yourbenefit, the awakened ones have always said, “Everything is a blessing,” or,perhaps more accurately, “Anything can be for a blessing.” The very word “Śiva”means blessing, so when the scriptures say that the world is śiva, they meanboth that it is divine and that it is a blessing (there are actually no capitalletters in Sanskrit). It is in this sense that we can say that reality isintrinsically auspicious (which means “conducive to success”), that reality isintrinsically good—not in the sense of good versus bad but in the deeper sensethat anything can be for a blessing, and every experience offers itself to youas a guru, teaching you something about the deeper pattern. You don’t have tounderstand it with your mind; you simply open to it in full awareness andwithout resistance, whether it is painful or pleasurable, and the learninghappens automatically.Now, the final objection: “All that sounds fine, but what happens to all yourhigh-flown spiritual philosophy when humanity manifests the worst it has tooffer? What about war and concentration camps?” No spiritual philosophy is worthits salt that breaks down just because the degree of suffering has increased.The point here is this: everything points us to the deeper pattern, andsometimes consequences get drastic indeed before humans choose to learn aboutthat pattern and act on their learning. But in every case that consequencesbecame drastic, there were smaller signs of the misalignment long before thatpoint. “So, do you think war is a blessing?” No, not if by “blessing” you mean“a good thing”; but yes, if you mean “a powerful opportunity to wake up.” One ofthe great beings of our time Thich Nhat Hanh woke up in the midst of the VietnamWar, and his insight and compassion have been flowing ever since, benefittingthousands. And the great humanistic psychologist Victor Frankl tells us that hediscovered the power of love in a Nazi concentration camp: he found the deepestmeaning, and a connection to God he had not known before, in maintaining hishumanity and supporting his fellow inmates in the worst of circumstances. Helater wrote,We must never forget that we may also find meaning in life even when confrontedwith a hopeless situation, when facing a fate that cannot be changed. For whatthen matters is to bear witness to the uniquely human potential at its best,which is to transform a personal tragedy into a triumph, to turn one’spredicament into a human achievement. When we are no longer able to change asituation—just think of an incurable disease such as inoperable cancer—we arechallenged to change ourselves.Some say Frankl was the exception, a man gifted by his natural constitution totake the best out of the worst. Actually, he was a normal man who transformedradically when he realized, on the very brink of despair, “Everything can betaken from a man but one thing, the last of the human freedoms: to choose one’sattitude in any given set of circumstances—to choose one’s own way.” This powerof autonomy exists in everyone in equal measure; in exercising it, you make theworst thing that ever happened to you into the greatest gift, thereby joiningthe legion of those who have gone before you who can honestly say, “My life hassometimes been filled with challenge and pain. I’m so grateful for all of it andI wouldn’t change a single thing.”"},{"pageContent":"the categories oftantrik thoughtThe Five Layers of the Self—The Five Acts of God[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-10_split_002.xhtml#fiveacts]—The FivePowers—The 36 Tattvas[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-11_split_000.xhtml#u68f02970-f7c4-474e-b23e-91c95879ae44]—TheThree Impurities[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-11_split_000.xhtml#impurities]—The FourLevels of Speech[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-11_split_001.xhtml]—The Five States ofAwareness[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-11_split_001.xhtml#fivestates]introduction to the categoriesLike all Indian philosophical systems, nondual Śaiva Tantra (NŚT) presents whatseems at first a bewildering array of lists of various aspects of reality, allof which attempt to describe the experience of embodied consciousness in itsvarious phases. Such categorical lists are a primary teaching tool for thetradition. Before you read this section, it is important to understand that eachof these lists gives a more or less complete account of reality from oneparticular angle. To use an (imperfect) analogy, it’s like cutting a marbledcake from several different angles: each cut produces a different pattern of oneand the same thing. Without understanding this, those who like to get the basicgist of a teaching may find the categories redundant or repetitive; while thoseinterested in details may feel overwhelmed by the wealth of distinct types ofinformation. Both problems can be corrected by understanding first that each ofthese various lists provides a different roadmap to practice, a viewpoint thatorients the unfolding of sādhanā. If you understood any one of them completely,you wouldn’t need any other map. Yet a variety of maps are presented, becausesome will make sense to some people, others to others. My recommendation is thatafter reading them all, you focus on contemplating deeply whichever one makesthe most sense to you. Then later you can contemplate another one, forcultivating an understanding of any one serves to illuminate the others.Practitioners of the Anusāra style of modern yoga may wish to note that itsstructure was directly inspired by these categorical lists, especially the FivePowers, Five Acts and the thirty-six tattvas. First we turn our attention to theTantrik vision of the nature of an embodied conscious being.nested layers of consciousness:the tantrik five-layered selfOne of the central questions of Indian philosophy has always been “Who or whatam I?” What are the dimensions of the self? What are the contours andconstituents of a human being? Or, to be more precise, “What is the referent ofthe ‘I’-cognition?” NŚT has its own unique answer to this question, one thatlike many Tantrik teachings will seem familiar yet provide fresh insights.The Tantrik vision of the self may be compared to a matryoshka or Russian doll:nested layers, proceeding from the gross to the subtle, the less essential tothe more essential, as we move from the periphery to the core. There are, intotal, five layers of the self in the Tantrik analysis:❖ the physical body,❖ the heart-mind/energy body,❖ the prāṇa or life-force,❖ the transcendent Void, and❖ the Power of Awareness.The last is your essential nature, the Self within the self.34[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en34] We should understandright at the beginning that these layers are not rigidly separated; in fact, asone Tantrik master tells us, “It is the nature of each layer to be pervaded byall the layers beneath it.” The subtler the layer is the more it can pervadeother layers, which is why Consciousness, the subtlest of all, is all-pervasive.But this schema does not denigrate the body; in fact, the body is the only layerwhere all the layers of self can be experienced simultaneously.Some texts add a sixth, most peripheral layer: the material expression of yourbeing that surrounds you, your “stuff.”[image/circle_chart.jpg]The point to this map of ourselves is that suffering arises as a result of afailure to perceive the whole of your being and its natural hierarchy. Thisinability to perceive the whole comes from mistakenly identifying your “self” asonly one or two of the layers we have described. Let’s analyze the layers fromthe outer to the inner.If you are identified with the outermost layer, your “stuff” (vastu), thatidentification expresses itself in such thoughts or statements as “I am rich,”or “I am poor,” and so on. In these statements, we are literally equating ourI-ness with our economic status, because the verb “am” functions as an equalssign. As another example of vastu-identification, consider how we equateourselves with our cars, such as when someone else’s car bumps ours and we yell,“You hit me!” I need hardly point out how identifying ourselves with thematerial vastu layer brings suffering, for material wealth and status is neitherstable nor certain. Though vastu includes our self-expression in the selectionand arrangement of objects in our home environment, it does not necessarilyfollow that delighting in this form of expression indicates attachment to thevastu layer. There is nothing wrong with loving material objects per se; it isforming an identity dependent on that dimension that we are concerned about. Forexample, if others’ opinions about your home feed your pride or self-hatred,then the unhealthy form of attachment is present. Discernment is necessary totell the difference, on this and all the layers.The next layer is that of the body or deha. Our identification with the body isexpressed in many thoughts or statements like “I am fat,” “I am thin,” “I amyoung,” “I am old,” “I am pretty,” “I am ugly,” and so on. Thoughts such asthese indicate a belief that your identity is defined by your physicality. Ifyou are identified with the body to the exclusion of the deeper layers of yourbeing, then you will necessarily base your self-worth on your own and others’opinions of your body. In this case, you are definitely setting yourself up forsuffering, for the one universal truth of the body is that it will break down,age, decay, and die. If you believe you are this body and nothing more, thattruth is terrifying. In ancient Indian tradition, yogīs would contemplate theimpermanence of the body by going to cremation grounds and practicing open-eyedmeditation, gazing at the burning bodies for days or weeks on end. This was apowerful way to get the truth of mortality through their heads, and it resultedin decreased attachment to the body and an increased sense of the preciousnessof life. It is no coincidence that in our culture that celebrates the physicaldimension of life to the point of obsession, death is hidden away. Crowds arediverted from seeing a body in public; examples of extreme old age aresequestered away in old folks’ homes. Thus we propagate a fantasy of ourimmortality, setting ourselves up for greater suffering when the fantasy isshattered. We do not know how to age and die gracefully. But if we believe andexperience that we are something more than this physical body, dying gracefullybecomes a possibility.Note that for each layer, I give the expressions of identification with thatlayer in the form of pairs of opposites; this is because according to yogapsychology, it is impossible to identify with one side of a pair without alsoidentifying with the other side. In other words, if the thought “I’m pretty”gives you pleasure, the thought “I’m ugly” will give you equal amounts of pain.Attachment to one side necessitates attachment to the other, which shows thatthey are flip sides of the same coin.The next layer is that of the heart-mind, or citta, which is pure Consciousnesscontracted into thoughts and feelings. We express our identification with themind-layer in thoughts or statements such as “I am smart,” “I am stupid,” “I amcompetent,” “I am incompetent,” “I am happy,” “I am sad,” and so on. The lasttwo may surprise you as examples of mind-identification. In Indian philosophy(as expressed in the Sanskrit language), the mind and the heart are not twodifferent things, if by those terms we mean the locus of thought and the locusof emotion. Both thoughts and feelings are vibrations of citta, or the“mind-stuff.” They are actually two ends of a single spectrum. If this were nottrue, we could never talk about our feelings or feel strongly about our ideas.The difference between thoughts and feelings is simply that thoughts arevibrations (vṛttis) with a greater linguistic or logical component, whilefeelings are vibrations with a greater affective charge. The difference is notabsolute but one of degree. For example, when we feel sad, that feeling isnearly always strongly tied to a specific thought, often unconscious. Becomingaware of that thought can help us become unstuck, tapping the latent energy ofthe feeling.When we are identified with our mind—that is, with our thoughts and feelings—tothe exclusion of the other layers of our being, we suffer. For the mind changeseven more rapidly than the body, a kaleidoscopic shifting display of imagery,words, ideas, and feelings, in which apparently sure ground turns out to betotal fantasy. In an attempt to stabilize this mental domain, we repeat certainpatterns of thought until they become ingrained habits. These are often nothealthy patterns, but we prefer the comfort of their familiarity to thewide-open possibility that can seem like terrifying uncertainty. We can becomevery attached to creating a sense of security by rigidly defining how things“ought to be”; in reality, we are staving off the fear that comes with therealization that nothing is certain and we are very much not in control even ofour own mind, let alone what happens to us. By contrast, the most amazing reliefand sense of freedom come when we no longer see our identity and reality asdefined by our thoughts and feelings. When we are not overly identified with themind, we ride the flow of its energy, learning its flux like the surfer learnsto ride the waves. We are merely amused by its foibles and petty fears and drawpower from its intense feelings, whether “positive” or “negative.”Most of us are most strongly identified with the mind out of all the layers.Becoming free of the bondage of this identification is of course impossiblewithout increasingly grounded direct experience of the deeper layers of self.Such disengagement from the mind (which does not imply devaluing its usefulness)is crucial in all forms of yoga, whether Tantrik or non-Tantrik. You see, whenwe overidentify with the mind, we cannot help but believe its stories. The mindcreates oversimplified, overgeneralized, and distorted representations ofreality (called vikalpas). When we take these mental constructs asreality—instead of the distorted second-order representations that they are—wesuffer. (Remember that according to NŚT, all suffering comes from not seeingthings as they really are.) When we are not overidentified with the mind, we arenaturally more skeptical of the stories it makes up about reality, which arespun out of hopes and fears based on past pleasurable and painful experience,rather than any clear assessment of the real situation in front of us. Free ofmind-identification, we don’t take ourselves too seriously, and we certainlydon’t believe everything we think. We understand that the mind is just one ofmany sources of input that an awakened being takes note of as part of herself-aware loving embrace of her whole being. It’s like a mother who lovinglylistens to the stories of all her children, not necessarily believing any ofthem literally but taking note of them when they point to a deeper reality orissue. (More will be said about this key issue.)The next layer of the self is that of the prāṇa, which is usually translated as“vital energy” or “life-force.” At this layer, individuality is transcended, forwe share this layer with all living beings. The movement of prāṇa, which isintimately connected to the breath, is vital for life to continue. In fact,prāṇa serves as the interface between the physical body and the mind and is thekey to the mind-body connection, though it is subtler and more fundamental thaneither. It is, in a sense, the means by which the mind extends itself throughoutthe body in the form of what is called the “subtle body.” (More on that later.)Prāṇa constitutes a subtler and more essential layer of our being than the mind.Our identification with prāṇa is expressed in such statements as “I amenergized,” “I am drained,” “I feel alive,” “I feel blah.” The amplification anddepletion of prāṇa, which is connected to diet, exercise, sleep, andthought-patterns, is responsible for our general energy level and many of ourmoods as well. If you find yourself cranky or irritable or listless, with noclear external reason for it, it is often due to the energy-state of your prāṇaand can thus be addressed through food, exercise, sleep, or relaxation. Thoughit may be “natural” to be more strongly identified with the prāṇa layer thanwith any of the more external layers, over-identification with prāṇa puts us atthe mercy of our moods. Taking our moods too seriously can prompt impulsiveaction that our mind- or body-layer may later regret (such as snapping at aloved one). We take prāṇa-based moods too seriously when we believe they arearising from the layer of the mind instead of simple prāṇa depletion oramplification (the widespread problem of reducing everything to our psychology).We may take a moment here to define the five basic subtypes of prāṇa. Somewhatconfusingly, the first subtype has the same name as that of the generalcategory, being called prāṇa-vāyu, (the “outward-moving wind”). This governsexhalation. Apāna-vāyu (the “downward-moving wind”) is linked to inhalation andgoverns all downward movement in the body, such as moving food through thedigestive tract and eliminating waste. Samāna-vāyu (the “equalizing wind”) islinked to the digestive fire in the stomach and to the fusion of the in-breathand the out-breath in the yogic practice of prāṇāyāma. Udāna-vāyu (the “uprisingwind”) is linked to belching, vomiting, sneezing, speech, and the rise ofkuṇḍalinī through yogic practices. Lastly, vyāna-vāyu (the “pervasive wind”) islinked to the movement of the limbs and the distribution of nutrients throughoutthe body. As you can see, all the five prāṇas must be in good working order tohave a healthy and enjoyable experience of being in the body.The penultimate layer in our analysis of the self is that of the transcendentVoid (śūnya). The Void, which is all-pervasive, is empty of all form and energy,absolutely still. It is, in a sense, Śiva without Śakti, or rather with Herexisting as unexpressed potentiality. This is the layer our awareness occupiesin the state of deep dreamless sleep. We can also access this layer while awakethrough meditation. Most people don’t identify with this layer; but manymeditators who have reached the place of the transcendent and profoundlypeaceful Void decide (upon emerging from it) that this is their real nature,declaring, “I am the Void,” or, more commonly something like, “I am not of thisworld; my true Self transcends all things.” Such people renounce allidentification with the material world, body, and mind, becomingtranscendentalists. They can attain deep states of peace but often cannotintegrate these states into daily life, and thus they may fail to adequatelytake care of their body and become unable to relate to others easily. They mayeven become escapist and turn away from the beneficial work of engaging inrelationships and improving the health of the ordinary mind and body. This isnot the Tantrik path; a Tāntrika renounces nothing and seeks tirelessly torealize the Divine on all layers of being.In the Tantrik View, the ultimate center of our being is absolute nondualnonlocal Consciousness (cit or saṃvit), beyond all other layers yet pervadingthem, making awareness of them possible. Consciousness is the secret pulsatingcore of your whole existence, mysterious because it is omnipresent and yet youdon’t notice it. It is the most difficult “layer” of your self to grasp, becauseit is the power by which all grasping is done. It is the most difficult toperceive, for it is the power behind all perception. It is the core in the sensethat it is the only aspect of yourself that is impossible to objectify. ThisConsciousness is absolutely not different from the supreme Divinity that is theessence of all things. It is all-embracing, present in all forms of awareness,including even the most contracted forms of self-identification with any of theprevious layers. Because this core Consciousness is by definition simultaneouslytranscendent and immanent, when we are identified with it, we can experience anystate as divine, not just the ones that are radically elevated from our ordinaryexperience. In other words, identification with our core Consciousness enablesus to experience divinity in all things, because it is the divinity in allthings. It is the perfect fusion of Śiva and Śakti, pure consciousness and allthe forms of energy that it embraces. Therefore this “level” of your beingcannot be pictured as topping the hierarchy of the layers of the self, becauseit pervades and subsumes the entire hierarchy.Identification with this Core takes the form of the experience (not thethought), “I am blissfully free self-aware Consciousness!” This is sometimesexpressed with the mantra śivo’ham (“I am the Divine”). For nondual Tantra, thisstate of liberated awareness in which we know our true nature by being it ismost perfectly summed up by the phrase pūrṇo’ham, which we may translate as “Iam the whole,” or “I am complete and perfect,” or (less poetic but moretechnically accurate) “I am that ‘I’ which encompasses all things.”The great master Utpala Deva describes the spiritual state of samāveśa—totalimmersion into the Divine—precisely in terms of this five-layered self we havediscussed:Experientially realizing the primacy of the Conscious Self as the true Knowerand Agent, and realizing that the other layers of individuality—from the Void tothe body—are mere attributes of it, is what characterizes samāveśa.35[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en35] (Stanzas on theRecognition of the Divine)In other words, the deepest spiritual experience of reality consists of the fullrealization that this divine Consciousness is your true essence, and that allthe layers of your being that you are accustomed to identifying yourselfwith—your stuff, body, mind, prāṇa, and the Void—are in fact the ever-changingexpressions of that core Consciousness.36[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en36] To put it yet anotherway, Consciousness vibrates forth into manifestation as all the more peripherallayers of your being, from the Void outward. Those other layers are epiphenomenaof the core Consciousness, not the other way around.The Tantrik model of the self invites us to ask where the locus of ourconstructed identity lies. On what level do we habitually fixate our awareness?In Paul Muller-Ortega’s phrase, what is our “individual identity assemblagepoint”? If it is on one of the more peripheral layers, we have more work to do.In working with this five- or six-layer model of the self in actual practice, wesee the classic Tantrik twofold movement of transcendence followed by pervasion.That is, we are asked to engage in a contemplation practice of negation followedby a deeper affirmation. First, we reject identification of our real Self withour stuff, then with our body, then our mind, then the prāṇa, then the Void.When we realize our real Self as the core divine Consciousness, thesimultaneously transcendent and immanent blissfully free Self-awareness, then wealso realize that we are in fact all the layers of the self that we hadpreviously negated. All those layers are seen as expressions of that nondualConsciousness. Identifying with the body, etc., ceases to be a problem when itis superseded by a deeper and truer identification. Thus we move from theerroneous perception “I am (only) this body,” to “I am divine Consciousness,vibrating in the form of this body.” Or, “I am all of these layers of being, andyet I am inexpressibly more than that!” (Note that as a statement in language,these experiences sound egotistical or ostentatious; but as deep wordlessexperience, they are not.)Negation is thus simply a tool to reach a deeper affirmation; transcendence ismerely a preliminary to a fuller expansion. In the contemplation of the Tantrikfive-layered self, we find our center, we plunge into our core, we (in thelanguage of Anusāra yoga) “hug inward to the midline” that we may expand outwardfully and joyously in a balanced way.the five (+1) powers of godThe five Powers, or śaktis, are the primary way in which the nondual ŚaivaTantra describes the fundamental nature of the Divine. They are:❖ CHIT-ŚAKTI—the Power of Consciousness❖ ĀNANDA-ŚAKTI—the Power of Bliss❖ ICCHĀ-ŚAKTI—the Power of Will or creative impulse❖ JÑĀNA-ŚAKTI—the Power of Knowing❖ KRIYĀ-ŚAKTI—the Power of ActionTo put it another way, God/dess is simply the blissful conscious agent of allknowing and doing. There is also a sixth, all-important “meta-power” thatencompasses the other five: Svātantrya-śakti, the Power of Freedom. This poweris “meta” because it provides the context for the operation of the other five.In other words, the Divine exercises its five powers as an expression of itsinnate freedom and total autonomy.These six Powers pervade all reality, and nothing exists separate from them. NŚTinvites us to recognize the Powers as our own. The experiential realization thatwe are truly not different from God is triggered by the recognition that thefive Powers and five Acts of God (see below) also comprise the totality of ourindividual experience of embodiment.We have already discussed that the Power of Consciousness (cit-śakti, pronouncedchit, like all c’s in Sanskrit) is the foundation of all reality, the onlyfactor present in any experience whatsoever. The only question is whether it ispredominant in any given experience. That is, at any given moment, either we arepredominantly aware of some particular contracted reality, some particularobject of consciousness, or we are predominantly aware of our subjectivity, ofourselves as conscious beings, of the fact of consciousness itself. In thelatter case, contraction may still be present; it is simply subordinated in ourawareness. For example, you may be experiencing something difficult orenjoyable, such as a painfully stubbed toe or an exquisite sunset, andenveloping that is the feeling-sense “I am a conscious being experiencingsuch-and-such a vibration in my awareness.” This perspective can be predominantin such a way that you are not any less present with the sunset or the stubbedtoe. When you are predominantly aware of consciousness itself, you do notexperience any form of contraction (such as a thought, pain, or pleasure) as alimitation. Whereas if you are predominantly aware of the contraction, you willnecessarily be limited by identification with the body, mind, prāṇa, etc.—thatis, with whichever layer of your being is predominant in the given experience.As Lord Kṣemarāja teaches us in his sublime text The Heart of the Doctrine ofRecognition (Pratyabhijñā-hṛdayam), being predominantly aware of our Awarenesscomes about either spontaneously or through a spiritual practice. We do havespontaneous experiences of this expansive Self-awareness from time to timebecause it is our true nature. Perhaps you have felt it walking silently innature. Perhaps connecting deeply with a friend while still being centered inyourself. Perhaps at a profound crossroads in your life, wondering which path totake. Perhaps realizing that you are falling in love. In these moments, we feelexpanded, our awareness is intensified, and our surroundings may seem morevivid, more sharply real (or sometimes more dream-like) than usual. Thesemoments feel charged with meaning and with power, even if there is nothingspecifically happening on the outside. They are tiny intimations of our innerpotency. They hint at the experience of reality we may have if we invest incultivating Awareness.We cultivate Awareness through meditation-focused spiritual practice, by whichwe progress in stages toward the state of constant awareness of our real nature,with our powers and potencies fully expanded—an awareness that is ever arising,ever new, ever refreshing itself (nityodita). Now, it is important to note thatin the context of NŚT, the practice of meditation is primarily destructive innature—that is, it allows you to strip away all your false limited notions aboutwhat you are, revealing your true nature, the core of being that is all you haveever been. As Abhinava Gupta teaches, if the false mental constructs aboutourselves are destabilized then dissolved, the Heart will stand revealed in itsfullness. Since you are already That, nothing need be added to make you perfect,though it is also the case that most of us will need to strengthen ourcapacities through exercising them if we wish to maintain our connection to ourinnate perfection. The process of uncovering the core reality of your being isvery different from the kind of therapy aimed at making you feel better. Forsome, it can be very difficult, even searingly painful, to surrender theself-images in which so much energy has been invested; but it will inevitablyresult in a far vaster joy. The central tool in this process of dissolution,which is simultaneously the process of Self-revelation, is the practice ofdiscernment (tarka), for it is what allows us to distinguish between reality andthe mental constructs (vikalpas) that we project onto it. Through discernment,we examine and discard ever more refined conceptualizations of reality, untilfinally we come up with one that is so refined that when it falls away we areface-to-face with reality itself without any intermediate conceptualization. Interms of the six Powers above, this is simply Consciousness exercising its Powerof Knowing in order to access its Powers of Bliss and Freedom. For when we seethings as they really are, we are naturally suffused with bliss and a sense ofour freedom to choose how to experience them.Let us then define the second of these Powers more precisely. When we are ableto activate, intensify, and expand our Power of Consciousness, to groundourselves in the very center of it, and then repose in that center, even justfor a few moments, we naturally access the fullness of ānanda-śakti, the Powerof Bliss. Bliss inheres in Consciousness like heat in fire. Now, we must becareful to distinguish Bliss (ānanda) from ordinary happiness or pleasurablefeeling (sukha). Ordinary happiness arises only when our needs are met, onlywhen the circumstances are just so; otherwise we experience its opposite,dissatisfaction or misery (duḥkha). By contrast, ānanda designates a way ofexperiencing and loving reality that is completely independent of circumstance.Therefore it is difficult to translate into English—but we get close if wedescribe it as a state of absolute contentment, acceptance, and quiet yetsublime joy: the peace that passeth all understanding. This state, which is farmore fulfilling than ordinary happiness, can exist in any circumstance. Forexample, you could be feeling intense grief or pain and still experience ānanda.We begin to tap into our Power of Bliss when we simply become fully aware ofwhat we are feeling in this moment and accept it totally, resisting no part ofit. The more we practice this loving self-awareness, the more complete is theexperience of ānanda that arises through it.Common sense says there are many possible sources of happiness. However, when itcomes to the experience of true Bliss that we all seek, of which happiness is amere shadow, NŚT argues that it has one and only one cause. To understand this,reflect for a moment on the times in your life when you have felt totally freeand contented, cut loose from all your cares and worries, when all seemed rightwith the world, and you fit perfectly into it—in other words, when you feltānanda. You might think that each such moment had a different cause: in one casethe beauty of nature, in another the applause of your peers, or the perfect skislope, or the perfect lovemaking, or an awesome band, or the kindness of afriend, and so on. Is it the case that many different causes can bring aboutprecisely the same result, that same joyous fullness, or do all theseexperiences have something in common? Upon reflection, you will see that allthose moments did have one common element: you allowed yourself to be fullypresent and aware—you gave yourself over to the reality of the present momentand opened to its beauty. But there was nothing intrinsically more beautifulabout that moment than any other, as others present will attest (otherwise,everyone would have had the same experience as you). It was just that you openedand connected with reality, rather than a concept of reality. In other words,the Power of Consciousness was activated and expanded, accurately connecting youwith the universe of which you are a part. This openness, this consciousPresence, is the sole means of unveiling your innate Bliss. We disempowerourselves when we believe the cause of our greatest joy is something outside ofourselves, such as another person or a particular circumstance. Those externalthings can (at best) trigger an expanded and intensified awareness, which itselfis the cause of the bliss.Consider that most of us dwell in a world of our own thoughts, concepts, andprojections; we are not fully connected with reality and thus are less likely totap into the innate power and beauty of reality. Usually we are not fullypresent either because we fear the vulnerability entailed by such engagementwith reality or because we find the present boring compared to our fantasyworld. This explains why it is only when circumstances are either safe enough(for example, when we are sure of the love and good opinion of those around us)or exciting enough (for example, peak experiences in nature or at a festival)that we fully connect with the present moment. This leads us to the natural butfalse conclusion that such experiences are only possible in those conditions.The spiritual path teaches us how to open in other circumstances and thusdiscover that it is being open and aware that gives rise to true bliss, andnothing else.Developing this crucial insight helps us understand that to access that bliss,we need only become more conscious. To achieve that end, we can adopt any one ofa number of tools. These tools are always available to us! This realizationempowers us by rescuing us from falsely fixating on a particular person or thingas the source of our joy. In fact, the whole spiritual path can be characterizedas the development of internal triggers for this blissful awareness, so that webecome totally free of the need for external circumstances to be anything otherthan what they are.Abhinava Gupta teaches that Bliss arises naturally and spontaneously when werepose in Consciousness. The Sanskrit word viśrānti, repose, is quite beautiful.It means to rest in the peaceful ground of being, that state of realconnectedness, which is as refreshing and delightful as the cooling rays of themoon after a scorching day. The first step toward this repose, in any situation,is to take a deep, long, slow breath. You can greatly increase the effect of thedeep breath by imagining the cooling, silvery-white, lunar in-breath(apāna-vāyu) flowing into the space of the Heart and landing you there in aplace of exquisite rest. After several such in-breaths, remain centered in yourHeart while extending your awareness out with a warming solar out-breath thatconnects you to the reality of your current situation. This can become apowerful meditation: to use the in-breath to release everything but the sense ofcoming to rest in the space of the Heart, and the out-breath to illuminate yourtotal environment with intensified awareness. With practice, ānanda will ariseand flood your whole being.The third of the Powers is icchā-śakti, the Power of Will. In ordinary usage,the word icchā can mean desire; but one can only desire something after knowingabout it, and in the context of NŚT icchā is defined as a precognitive creativeurge toward self-expression. It is the impulse behind the manifestation of auniverse and behind all artistic expression that is done for its own sake. It iscontingent on the first two Powers because it is precisely when Consciousnessreposes in blissful self-awareness that the dynamic impulse towardself-expression arises. As a microcosm of God/dess, you too can tap into thePower of divine Will, a source of the infinite energy behind all creation. Inorder to do so, you must repose in Self-awareness. The more we access our realinnate nature, the more we can draw on the unfailing power of the divine Will.The Will seeks self-expression for no reason other than the joy inherent in theact of self-expression. If you are tapping into icchā-śakti in your pursuits inlife, be they dancing or computer repair, you will have a vast reservoir ofenergy to draw on. This is because when you are pursuing an activity as a formof self-expression, it replenishes you instead of draining you. Thus a yogī mustfind a way to express his innate nature through his career and life activities,and if he cannot, he must change them or become desiccated.For icchā-śakti to successfully flow into action, it must first be fused withjñāna-śakti, the Power of Knowing. The inspirational energy of icchā-śakti mustbe poured into the structured patterns of jñāna-śakti if it is to made use of;otherwise the inspiration fizzles out. Jñāna-śakti is the organic patterning ofConsciousness, expressed as the deep structures of reality. Without jñāna-śaktithere would be no consistent laws of physics (for example), no cohesive form tothe universe, no pattern in the interaction of living beings. As a microcosm ofthe Divine, if you wish to express your creative impulse in action, whether as astockbroker or a musician or a chef, you must first equip yourself withknowledge. You cultivate profound understanding of the specific ways in whichenergy flows in your chosen field of activity—i.e., its deep structures and lawsof operation. The seeming paradox is that by submitting yourself to thediscipline of mastering the knowledge of form and structure, you become capableof joyously free expression in that arena. For example, a great jazz musician ormodern dancer is only able to improvise with such consummate virtuosity, withsuch freedom and focused passion, because she or he has mastered the forms andstructures within which music operates and the body moves. It is in submittingourselves to a discipline that we become truly free and capable of realself-expression; otherwise our creative energy is not sufficiently directed toaccomplish anything. Similarly, no matter how much passion you have for walkingthe spiritual path, for that fervor to serve you, you must equip yourself withknowledge about the path, especially drawing on the wisdom of the masters whohave themselves walked the path and successfully navigated its many pitfalls.All of these powers would add up to nothing without kriyā-śakti, the Power ofDivine Action. Nothing would actually come into being in any concrete waywithout kriyā-śakti, for the structures spoken of in the context of jñāna-śaktiabove are purely subtle, the intangible patterns in which energy naturallyflows. Thus kriyā-śakti, though the “lowest” of the Powers, is celebrated as thefinal culmination of the movement of Consciousness into the diverse forms of itsself-expression. Though from the absolute perspective, all activity is a form ofkriyā-śakti, from our limited perspective there is an important distinction tobe made between “kriyā” and “karma.” Both words mean “action,” but karmicactions (defined as volitional actions motivated by an expected result) bind theindividual soul and restrict her freedom, whereas actions that partake ofkriyā-śakti are, like all the śaktis, absolutely free and thus not part of theusual karmic system. In other words, karma is conditioned and conditional actionwhile kriyā is spontaneously arising action that expresses our natural being.What are examples of such actions? Any action done for its own sake, pure andselfless, with no agenda, as a spontaneous expression of your being, is amanifestation of kriyā-śakti and thus does not bind you further into the karmiccycle. One of my teachers says that when anyone wants to do something for him,he cautions them, “Please do this for me only if you can do it with all thedelight of a child feeding a dog, because I don’t want to have to pay for itlater.” That is his way of saying that he wants his relationships with others tobe expressions of kriyā-śakti, not karmic bondage. The spiritual practices,unless they are done in a spirit of grasping after results, are all expressionsof kriyā-śakti. That is why spiritual practice is most successful when you enjoyit for its own sake, experiencing it as a celebration of the Divine rather thanas a means to an end."},{"pageContent":"[image/Nataraja2.jpg]śiva as Lord of the Dance (Naṭarāja)the five acts of godIf the five Powers describe the fundamental nature of God/dess, the five Actsdescribe what S/He does. In this sense they are expressions of the Power ofAction (which of course never operates separately from Will and Knowing).Kṣemarāja, the disciple of Abhinava Gupta, refers to the five Acts in theopening verse to his masterful treatise The Heart of the Doctrine of Recognition(Pratyabhijñā-hṛdayam):Oṃ namaḥ śivāya satataṃ pañca-kṛtya-vidhāyine |cidānanda-ghana-svātma-paramārthāvabhāsine ||Reverence to the Divine, who ceaselessly performs the Five Acts, and who, by sodoing, reveals the ultimate reality of one’s own Self, brimming over with thebliss of Consciousness! (The Heart of Recognition)The five divine Acts (pañca-kṛtya) are not only what God/dess does; in fact,they are all S/He ever does. So, everything that is happening in the universeexpresses one or more of these Acts. They are:❖ Sṛṣṭi—creation, emission, the flowing forth of Self-expression❖ Sthiti—stasis, maintenance, preservation❖ Saṃhāra—dissolution, resorption, retraction❖ Tirodhāna—concealment, occlusion, forgetting❖ Anugraha—revealing, remembering, graceThese Acts take place on all scales: from the grand macrocosmic processes of thecreation and dissolution of this entire universe to the moment-to-momentprocesses that create and dissolve your subtle inner experience of reality.Kṣemarāja teaches us in the above verse that it is the performance of these fiveActs that reveals the ultimate reality of the Self as the pure dynamism ofblissful Consciousness. We will investigate how this is so.We may use the image of Śiva as Lord of the Dance (Naṭarāja) to orient us to thefive Acts, for His four hands and upraised foot express the Acts perfectly. Thefirst of the five is sṛṣṭi, creation, represented by upper right hand, holdingthe ḍāmaru drum. The drum represents the rhythmic pulsation that gives rise tothe whole of reality. Since the universe is nothing but spanda, the dynamicpulsation of interlaced movements of expansion and contraction, the beat of thedrum sets the tone for all that follows. Now, sṛṣṭi is usually translated as“creation,” but in the Tantrik context, it is better rendered as “emission”(which is in fact closer to the root meaning of the word) for the act ofcreation is nothing other than the flowing forth of the Divine into manifestform, the projection of His self-reflection into embodiment.The second Act is sthiti, the maintenance of something that has been created fora specific duration of time. Thus we may also translate it as “stasis.” This actis represented by the lower right hand, held in abhaya-mudrā, the palm-outwardgesture that traditionally indicates, “Do not fear.”The third Act is saṃhāra, usually translated as “dissolution” or even“destruction.” It is represented by Śiva’s upper left hand, holding fire. (Inmainstream Hinduism—which incidentally has almost nothing to do with ŚaivaTantra except that it has sometimes been influenced by the latter—destruction isconsidered the special purview of Śiva when He is placed on par with Viṣṇu andBrahmā. This is because of Śiva’s association with the power of Time (mahākāla),seen as a primarily destructive force.) However, in Śaiva Tantra, saṃhāra isunderstood as “reabsorption” or “retraction”; it is simply the drawing back ofwhat God has created into His unmanifest being. What seems to us destruction istruly reabsorption into the luminous, indescribable ground of pure potentialityinto which all things ultimately dissolve.The fourth Act is tirodhāna, which means “occlusion, concealment.” It isexpressed by the arm that crosses Naṭarāja’s chest, concealing His heart fromview and ending in a poignantly downturned hand. Of all the Acts, this Act ofself-forgetting is the most difficult to understand. The process by whichConsciousness moves from the unmanifest state of absolute potential intomanifest particularity necessarily involves concealment. For in order forConsciousness to manifest itself in one particular form, it must conceal orsuppress all other possible forms. In order for God to fully become you, andthereby embrace Herself as you, She must temporarily forget everything aboutHerself that is not you. Thus the coalescence of Consciousness into embodiedform is necessarily an act of self-limitation—but one that is freely chosen. Themovement from total expansion into contracted embodiment is an “auspicioussqueeze,” to use Sianna Sherman’s felicitous phrase. In the expanded state ofabsolute potential, there is total homogeneity and stillness and thus nopossibility for dynamic action and creative self-expression. Since the latterqualities are potencies that are inherent in divine Consciousness, there was(and is) no possibility of failing to express them. To fail to express any partof Her being would be an act of self-negation on the part of God, and since Hervery nature is love and reverent self-awareness, that would be impossible.Thus the act of creation, of particularization and diversification, isnecessarily also one of concealment. This can be difficult to accept for us,because suffering is one corollary of such self-forgetting on the part of God.When we do not see the whole reality, we suffer, since true bliss is predicatedon seeing things as they really are. Therefore the fourth Act is naturallybalanced and resolved by the fifth, that of anugraha or grace. This Act issymbolized by Śiva Naṭarāja’s upraised foot, because in Indian tradition thefeet of the Guru are the most sacred part of his body and are associated withthe outflow of his grace. Note that Śiva’s hand of concealing points directly atthe upraised foot of grace: one implies the other. Grace, the blessing ofGod/dess, is nothing but the act of remembering or self-revealing that cancelsout the previous act of forgetting or self-concealing; or more accurately, itbrings the latter to fruition by revealing its deeper purpose. Grace isfundamentally an act of reconciliation in this tradition. It is through theblessing of this revelation that an individual, limited manifestation ofGod/dess (such as you) is reconciled with the pattern and purpose of the Whole.Such reconciliation is thus also a reintegration; through it, you experientiallyrealize yourself as a complete and perfect expression of the deep pattern of theone Consciousness which moves and dances in all things. The act of grace isabout showing you who you really are. This revelation does not negate what youalready know of yourself but simply shows it to be the most superficial layer ofyour being.This then is another example of the pattern of contraction as a necessaryprecursor to further expansion. The contractive movement into embodiment thatexpresses the particular facets of the Divine (such as yourself) is completedand consummated by an expansion back into the awareness of the fullness of yourdivine nature. But, and this is crucial, this expansion does not necessarilyinvolve any relinquishment of your individuality; rather, that veryindividuality is experienced as a unique expression of the pattern of the Whole.Such an experience is the result of grace.The use of the word “grace” might trigger the wrong associations for some; forexample, a blessing that must be earned through good works or by being a “goodperson.” The implication that God is one who bestows favor on those who areworthy and withholds it from others, says Abhinava Gupta, is simply the“nonsensical prattling of the dualists.” In a nondualist system, such anunderstanding is impossible. So, what activates the power of grace in anapparently limited individual such as ourselves? It can only be the exquisitelysubtle yet profound movement within us by which we begin to open ourselves to agreater reality. To use a metaphor, as soon as we make space within our hearts,the power of grace moves in to fill the vacuum. When we have had enough of thepleasures and pains of the ordinary existence, we turn toward our finalexpansion and open to divine reality. Then anugraha, divine grace, inexorablyflows into us in proportion to our ability to open to it. The etymology ofanugraha is “that which follows grasping.” I have not yet seen an explanation ofthis in any primary source, but I take it to allude to the experience ofblessedness that follows upon our grasping of our own innate divine potential.When we glimpse, however briefly, the magnificence of our true nature, we beginto inherit our birthright. The gratitude that wells up in response to theinexpressible sweetness of this experience of awakening is such that we can saynothing but “I am so blessed!” This is grace.The five Acts of creation, sustenance, dissolution, concealment, and grace mightseem to be grand cosmological processes, distantly removed from your everydaylife. So, how is it that the performance of all five Acts reveals the ultimatereality of one’s own Self, as Kṣemarāja claims? NŚT teaches that our universeexhibits self-similarity, like a snowflake or a fractal, with the same patternsrepeating on all levels. As above, so below. As without, so within. As here, soelsewhere. Thus the five Acts that are involved in the universal process areprecisely the movements of our individual process as well. Our moment-to-momentexperience of reality can be described in terms of these five. (Things are goingto get a bit more philosophical and dense soon, so feel free to skip a bit ifyou get bogged down. The text gets less philosophical again in the next section[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-10_split_002.xhtml#lessphilosophical].)The Krama school of NŚT teaches that we can observe the divine acts of sṛṣṭi,sthiti, and saṃhāra in the arising and falling away of each and every cognition.Whether the object of awareness is something we are thinking about (a concept)or something we are currently perceiving (a percept), it undergoes the sameprocess. The cognition of it emerges out of an apparently blank or neutral“void” state, persists for a short time, then dissolves again into the void.Most cognitions trigger another related cognition so quickly that we cannotperceive any space between them—but we can perceive it at the end of what wecall a “train of thought.” The dissolution of the last of a connected series ofcognitions gives way to a perceptible space between thoughts, often experiencedas a “coming back to yourself”—a natural return to greater awareness ofourselves and our environment in the present moment, which is simultaneously anexpansion into open possibility. It is in this moment of connecting to reality,which provides an opportunity of self-reflection, that we choose to conceal orreveal to ourselves the fact of our agency in the whole process—that it is notsomething happening to us but a process in which our own consciousness is bothagent and ground. The Krama-influenced Recognition school (Pratyabhijñā) teachesthat this process of cognition, by which the field of our consciousnesscontracts into particular thought-forms and releases them again, something thathappens countless times each day, holds the key to the liberating recognition ofourselves as a microcosmic expression of the whole of divine reality. Let usinvestigate it more fully.ābhāsa theory part one:the status of “external” objectsInvestigating how the Act of creation unfolds within us will take us on a littlejourney. In order to understand how an object of awareness manifests, we mustunderstand the relation between the perceiver and the perceived and the natureof the existence of external objects.The process begins when Consciousness manifests an object of awareness. This isdescribed as a “descent” of Consciousness from a fully expanded state ofabsolute potential—a densification of the energy of Consciousness whereby itbegins to vibrate on the more limited wavelength of the object. In other words,Consciousness coalesces and contracts in conformity with the object to beperceived and thus creates a representation of it in awareness. Now, an objectof awareness could be anything, such as a hovering dragonfly or your memory of aloved one. The traditional examples that are given for an object of awarenessare the color blue and the feeling of happiness. The important thing is that all“objects” of awareness are in fact just particular vibrations of the field ofConsciousness. They all arise out of a state of pure potentiality, the infinitevoid of pure Consciousness, out of which, theoretically, anything couldemerge.37 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en37]The manifestation of an object of awareness necessarily requires themanifestation of a limited subject as well: the perceived implies a particularperceiver. This is what we call “the mind.” What we do not realize, however, isthat the mind and its object are an apparent bifurcation of one principle: theGoddess Consciousness who is the ground of the whole process. It divides intotwo mutually correlated and coordinated contractions, reflections of each otheras it were, manifesting in two spheres that we have labeled as “internal” and“external.” These labels conceal the fact that no “external” reality can beshown to exist that is independent of a corresponding “internal” reality. Thisinvariable concomitance proves that they are aspects of each other. Moderncognitive science can accept that we create a mental image that is arepresentation or reflection of an actual external object; but from theperspective of NŚT, the object is equally a reflection of our cognition. Inother words, it does not have existential priority. But, the objectionerreplies, the object must have priority, because multiple different peopleperceive it and describe it similarly. No, NŚT replies, it need not havepriority if those different perceivers are all aspects of one Perceiver, whichdifferentiates itself precisely in order to view the object from differentperspectives. (For no two people can have precisely the same perspective onanything, literally or figuratively, and this lack of redundancy is, in a sense,precisely what justifies each individual’s existence.)Well, what about the opposite case, the objectioner asks—in cognition of aconcept (as opposed to a percept). Surely then the subject has priority over theobject, since the concept I contemplate is part of my own private reality. Notso, comes the reply: can you think of any concept that you could contemplatethat has not also been contemplated by others? The very creation of a concept isa social act, a collective act of meaning-making, that from the perspective ofNŚT is only possible because the individuals involved are all aspects of onebeing. Furthermore, in this philosophy, not only any concept but equally anyobject known by more than one individual is said to be cocreated by all thosewho perceive it. This explains both why no single individual has completeautonomy in the creation of her reality and why, to experience such unlimitedautonomy, one must subsume one’s individuality in one’s universality (that is,one’s divinity). So, we have shown that the manifestation of the cognition ofany object, however simple, is a process that cannot be separated from themanifestation of an “external” object, and vice versa—the two are aspects ofone, mirroring each other as part of the dialectical process by which divineConsciousness reflects on itself and on the various dimensions of its being.Pondering this truth as a meditative exercise is an example of the Tantrikpractice called bhāvanā, meditation or “creative contemplation.” As it is saidin the sacred Vijñāna-bhairava-tantra:The awareness of the knower and the known is common to all embodied beings; butfor yogīs, this is the difference: they pay careful attention to the connection.|| 106 || (Vijñāna-bhairava-tantra)For the Tantrik yogī, the most fascinating thing to do is observe the process bywhich Consciousness creates reality by dividing itself into three: a perceivedobject (prameya), a perceiver of that object (pramātṛ) whose experience ofherself in that moment is colored by that object, and a process of perceptionthat links those two (pramāṇa). All three are expressed in a simple sentencelike “I see a pot.” By providing three separate terms with distinct grammaticalfunctions, language programs us to believe that the three are separate—butreflection shows they must be part of one continuous process, for not one ofthem can exist without the other two. To be more precise, the limited “I” cannotexist without the other two, but the unlimited divine “I” can, for it is theindescribable ground of all three (more on that later). For a yogī who is fullyaware of all that is entailed in making the statement, “I see a pot” is both aprofound philosophical statement and a spiritual experience.ābhāsa theory: part twomany shinings of the one lightOne more note on the nature of external objects. To fully understand how theymanifest in Consciousness, we much touch on what is called ābhāsa theory. Inthis understanding of reality, all manifestation is a projection or “shining”(ābhāsa) of the one Light of Consciousness. Each object has its variouscharacteristics, such as “tall,” “round,” “blue,” “male,” or “made ofsandalwood.” Each of these various characteristics is called an ābhāsa,literally “a shining” within Consciousness. They are each a vibration of thatone Light. (Note that “shine” and “manifest” are two meanings of the same wordin Sanskrit: √ābhā or √prakāś.) The mind, in this theory, is said to be asynthesizer, for it constructs an object it calls “pot” insofar as it perceivesthe various ābhāsas of “short,” “round,” “blue,” “hard,” and so on as pertainingto a single object.38 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en38]However, there are less tangible ābhāsas that are even more important to ourindividualized perception of an object, and without these we would be nodifferent from a robot. The most important of these “subjective” ābhāsas are 1)how much you like the object, 2) how useful it is to you, and 3) what prioreducation and experience you have concerning it. When we perceive an object, ourmind is synthesizing all of these ābhāsas into a unified “thing.” But there isno such thing as a pot in general; there are only particular pots, each oneunique due to being composed of different ābhāsas. Here we are using the simplerexample of a tangible object; needless to say, the act of synthesizing anexperience of an intangible object (like, say, “justice”) is even morecomplex.39 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en39]The practical application of ābhāsa theory is that it helps you to encounterreality as it is: various vibrations of energy analyzed by the different sensefaculties and synthesized into an object by the mind, and then made the objectof various judgments. Observing this process requires a step back and expansioninto a meta-awareness that is considerably closer to our real nature, allowingus to hold a much bigger yet more subtle and more sensitive picture. I saidcloser to our real nature because ultimately we seek the ability to hold thatbroader perspective without the sense of detachment connoted by “step back.”Indeed, in the Tantra we seek that holistic meta-awareness even while fullyengaged with the world.To conclude our excursus on ābhāsa theory, I want to note that our Westernmaterialistic society (if I may usefully overgeneralize for a moment) grantsgreater reality to the traits of an object that everyone agrees on (such as itsphysical parameters), calling them “objective reality.” Less significance isgiven to our “subjective” experience of an object (actually, all experience issubjective, by definition)—despite the fact that those dimensions are neverabsent from anyone’s experience of the object and are invariably more importantto each real individual experiencer. NŚT implicitly argues that the so-calledsubjective traits (the appeal and utility of the object and so on) are just asmuch a part of the reality of the object as its physical properties, for nobodyexperiences it without those subjective traits, though they vary from person toperson. Why bother to make this point? Because, by focusing attention on theso-called “objective” consensus about a given object, our culture takes the mostsuperficial layer of reality to be the primary one and thus fails to realizethat it is the sum total of the different perspectives on the object thatconstitute its total multidimensional reality. It is the so-called subjectivedimension that we argue over, and even kill each other over, without realizingthat these different experiences of the thing or person or situation in questionare all part of its reality. Acknowledging this, our differences of opinioninvite us into a cooperative process of inquiry by which we come to understandthe way in which Consciousness creates reality.We have taken some time to explore the various facets involved in themanifestation of an object of awareness (and remember, all objects arenecessarily objects of awareness). We have seen that the very act of perceivingor thinking of something implies a whole interconnected theory of the nature ofreality. But let us return to the sequential flow of a simple act of cognition,such as the awareness of the color blue or the feeling of happiness. First, theobject emerges into conscious awareness: we are performing the act of creationor emission. Even if it is a familiar object, you never experience it exactlythe same way twice; thus we are creating it anew each time. Now, the object musthave some duration for it to be experienced as a reality. Thus, we perform theact of stasis (sthiti) when we hold a thought or percept in awareness, howeverbriefly. It may mutate, unfolding as a series of connected ideas or images (eachwith their own mini reiteration of the cyclical flow), but still we stay with aparticular line of thought, sustaining it until we release it.When we feel “done” with that object of awareness, we release it, and itdissolves, merging back into the indescribable ground out of which it came—theGoddess Consciousness in Her fully expanded and all-encompassing form. This isthe act of saṃhāra, dissolution or retraction. As mentioned above, just afterthe moment of dissolution, when we return to the timeless ground of all thought,there is a moment of opportunity. At that moment in which we have, howeverbriefly, been returned to the ground of awareness, we have a choice:self-revealing or self-forgetting. We have the opportunity to recognize thatthis still, expansive, ground state of pure Consciousness in which we rest forbut a moment is our true nature, the inherently blissful and free Self.This is the great secret: we touch down in our fundamental nature many times aday—every single time we have released one thought or experience and before weturn to the next—yet we do not know how to repose in that Śiva-state, to savorits divine rasa (flavor); indeed, we do not even recognize the opportunity.Usually, when confronted with this moment of choice, we do not perform the Actof anugraha (revealing) but rather that of tirodhāna (forgetting or concealing).Instead of surrendering to the opportunity for ineffable self-awareness, weunreflectively initiate another train of thought as soon as possible, one thatoften begins as an evaluation of the previous train of thought. Needless to say,the likelihood of recognizing the opportunity in the moment of choice, themoment of “touchdown,” is greater the longer that moment lasts. Thus the yogīseeks to prolong the space between the thoughts. That’s where a meditationpractice comes in.40 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en40]So, you are performing the five Acts of God within yourself all day, every day.You create thoughts, hold them, dissolve them, and choose to reveal or concealwhat’s really going on and who is really in charge; then create again. You’realways doing one of these five things! Whether you are responding to external orinternal stimuli, you manifest the objects of awareness that create yourspecific experience, you hold onto them, you let them go, and then you choose:to repose in your true nature and thus recognize yourself as the divine authorof the whole process or to overlook your Self and, instead, look to the nextthing that might give you pleasure, in an endless cycle. If you choose theformer, you choose empowerment. To recognize that the space of expandedself-awareness between thoughts is their unchanging ground—to recognize thatthere is one eternal Perceiver of the arising and dissolving of the threefoldcognitive process, and you are It—is supremely empowering and liberating, for inso doing you realize that you are always choosing your experience of reality,and you can also choose differently. You are not and never have been a victim ofcircumstance, for no one else can determine your inner state for you. True,choosing differently can be quite difficult at first because of the power ofyour saṃskāras (subliminal impressions of past experiences that influence how wesee the present). We tend to repeat old familiar patterns rather than making newchoices. Even so, identifying yourself as the ground of the process of thoughtinstead of as your thoughts means that you are no longer at the mercy of thosethoughts. You can choose to alter the way you experience reality, for you arethe only one who creates and dissolves the cognitions through which youexperience that reality.In conclusion, let’s return to the verse that started this whole discussion:Reverence to the Divine, who ceaselessly performs the Five Acts, and who, by sodoing, reveals the ultimate reality of one’s own Self, brimming over with theBliss of Consciousness! (The Heart of Recognition)Kṣemarāja assures us that by accessing our root nature, our core essence, theOne who constantly performs the five Acts—not different from the divine Authorof the whole cosmic process—we will discover a level of awareness which isdensely replete with the bliss of pure Being, the bliss of being conscious, ofbeing embodied Consciousness, of being the absolutely free agent in the creationof our experience of reality."},{"pageContent":"[image/tattva_chart.jpg]the 36 tattvas:principles of realityCentral to Tantrik philosophy and cosmology is the system of the tattvas or“levels of reality.” The tattva system is a kind of map of the conscious being’sexperience of reality. (Please refer to the Tattva Chart to the left) Theearlier non-Tantrik Sānkhya philosophy (followed by Patañjali among others)articulated a system of twenty-five tattvas; when Śaiva Tantra took over andreworked the Sānkhya system, it added eleven more levels of reality on top,which it claimed the Sānkhyas had failed to discover.It’s difficult to define tattva; the Sanskrit word literally means “that-ness.”We often translate it as “principle of reality.” Abhinava Gupta offers atechnical definition that is only helpful if you can understand it: “A tattva isthat which, by virtue of its reality, enables conscious agents to subsume thecategories within it.” It’s easier to understand the concept if you familiarizeyourself with the specific tattvas themselves.The tattvas can be enumerated from the bottom up or the top down. The top downorder (Śiva -> Earth) is the order of creation (sṛṣṭi-krama). The bottom up isthe order of liberation or return to Source (saṃhāra-krama). We’ll examine themin the latter sequence, i.e., from the bottom up.The first five tattvas are the five great elements of materiality, or pañcamahā-bhūtas. Each is accompanied by its traditional Tantrik symbol, used invisualization exercises.TATTVA #36: EARTH (prthvī)Earth, at the bottom of the tattva hierarchy, is not seen by the Tāntrikas asthe “lowest” of the principles, but rather the most complete: that level ofreality in which all the tattvas are fully manifest. In other words, at the topof the tattva hierarchy (Śiva-tattva) all the principles are present inpotential form, while at the bottom all those potentialities inherent in theDivine are fully expressed.Earth element is the principle of solidity, density, resistance, andgroundedness. The exoteric bīja mantra (seed-syllable) commonly used to evokeand activate it is lam.41[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en41] All five senses areengaged in perceiving it.Earth [image/Earth.jpg]TATTVA #35: WATER (āp or āpaḥ)Water is the principle of liquidity. The senses of hearing, touch, sight, andtaste are engaged in perceiving it, especially the latter. The bīja mantracommonly used for it is vam.Water [image/Water.jpg]TATTVA #34: FIRE (tejas)Fire is the principle of combustion and transformation. (Āyurveda speaks of the“digestive fire” as a way of describing the process by which the digestivesystem transforms food into energy.) The senses of hearing, touch, and sight areengaged in perceiving it, especially the latter. The bīja mantra commonly usedfor it is ram.Fire [image/Fire.jpg]TATTVA #33: WIND (vāyu)Wind is the principle of mobility (note that “air” and “wind” are the same wordin Sanskrit, and the latter would be the more accurate translation). The primarycharacteristic of air is the way it moves to fill a partial vacuum, constantlyseeking to even itself out. The senses of hearing and touch are engaged inperceiving it, especially the latter. The bīja mantra commonly used for it isyam.Air [image/Air.jpg]TATTVA #32: SPACE (ākāśa)Space is the principle of vacuity and of extension (three-dimensionality),sometimes mistranslated as “ether” (a concept of the interstellar medium thatwas debunked around a hundred years ago). Space provides the context for themanifestation of all matter/energy. The sense of hearing is engaged inperceiving it, in the sense that sound resonates through space. The bīja mantracommonly used for it is ham.Space [image/Space.jpg]The next five tattvas are the tanmātras or so-called “subtle elements,” that isto say, the properties of things that make them perceptible by our senses.Sentient beings live in worlds that are smellable, tastable, visible, tangible,and audible. By virtue of these qualities, they developed senses correspondingto them (see below).TATTVA #31: ODOR (gandha)TATTVA #30: FLAVOR (rasa)TATTVA #29: APPEARANCE (or form; rūpa)TATTVA #28: TACTILITY (sparśa)TATTVA #27: SOUND VIBRATION (śabda)The next five are the five “action capacities”or karmendriyas. These are thefive fundamental functions of a human being in relation to his or herenvironment.TATTVA #26: EVACUATION (bowels)TATTVA #25: REPRODUCTION (genitals)TATTVA #24: LOCOMOTION (feet)TATTVA #23: MANIPULATION (hand)TATTVA #22: SPEECH (mouth)The next five are the “sense capacities” or jñānendriyas. They are the internalcorrelates of the five “subtle elements” above, the sensory energies that haveevolved in conformity with the manifold sensibility of reality. Since all thatreally exists is a single field of energy, the senses (even touch) areessentially frequency analyzers that translate vibrations into the apparentlytangible and static realities perceived by our brain, such as the visualappearance and sound of something.TATTVA #21: SMELLING (ghrāṇa)TATTVA #20: TASTING (rasana)TATTVA #19: SEEING (cakṣus)TATTVA #18: TOUCHING (tvak, lit. “skin”)TATTVA #17: HEARING “śrotra”The four sets of five that constitute the twenty lower tattvas may be alignedthis way, bringing out their correspondences more clearly:DenseElementsSubtleElementsPerceptiveEnergiesActiveEnergiesEarthOdorSmellingEvacuationWaterFlavorTastingPleasure/ReproductionFireAppearanceSeeingLocomotionWindTouchFeelingManipulatingSpaceSoundHearingSpeechThese alignments may seem common sense, but in fact a correct and completemeeting between the energies of senses and their respective sense objects suchas the Tāntrikas seek is more rare than it seems. That is, most of us live in amental world of our own making to such an extent that we are not well groundedin the sensual world. When we do pay attention to it, it is “through a glass,darkly,” filtering it through that mentally constructed world. This is why theTantra stresses sensual meditations—meditative savoring of food and music, aswell as slowed down and ritualized acts of refined awareness like the Japanesetea ceremony—that allow us to cultivate our ability to allow the senses to meettheir objects fully. In NŚT, this is called “feeding the goddesses of thesenses.” When fed properly, the “goddesses” reward you by suffusing yourawareness with aesthetic rapture, increasing your capacity to experience beauty.The whole world becomes more vivid and real, more radiantly lovely, more full oflife-energy, not the relatively dull and lifeless world perceived by one livingin their own mental world, or the insubstantial shadow world perceived by atranscendentalist meditator (one who takes the transcendent realm of the void as“the Real”). The latter are the worlds of one who starves the goddesses of thesenses.Now we move into the higher and subtler tattvas. The next three are the aspectsof what in the West we generally call “the mind.” The Sanskrit collective termfor these faculties is antaḥ-karaṇa, or “inner instrument.”TATTVA #16: MIND (manas, faculty of attention and sense processing)The manas is the common functional mind, processing and synthesizing the datacollected by the senses. It is also the faculty of attention, and thus it is themanas that needs to be gently trained and lovingly disciplined when learning tomeditate.TATTVA #15: EGO (ahaṅkāra, lit. “identity-constructor”)The ahaṅkāra is the part of mind that identifies what is “me” and “mine.” Itappropriates certain things and experiences, assimilating them into itsconstructed sense of identity. Simply put, it is what you think you are. So, itis the ego that declares, “I am fat,” “I am thin,” “I am clever,” “I am stupid,”“I am independent,” “I am a victim,” and every other “I” statement (egoliterally means “I am” in Latin). The aggregation of all these thoughtsconstitutes the egoic identity. The egoic identity is a fictitious construct,consisting primarily of self-images that persist because they are believed andattached to. Each such self-image is based in a particular moment or moments ofpast experience that generated a mental construct (a “story”) that was taken asa static reality. Thus the ego is essentially a fiction, because all that reallyexists is the flux of phenomena in each present moment. But it seems realbecause you believe in it, and belief shapes experience. Ego, then, is apersistent contraction of awareness in the form of a collection of self-imagesthat causes suffering through artificial self-limitation. Since it is part ofthe inherent dynamism of consciousness to pulsate continually through cycles ofexpansion and contraction, whenever we get “stuck” in one or the other, we losealignment and experience suffering. The ego should be a fluid entity but insteadbecomes a static prison.Many spiritual traditions view the ego as an enemy on the spiritual path becauseits voice seems opposite to the voice of God, our innermost Self. However, inthe Tantrik tradition, an enemy is simply an ally viewed in the wrong way. Thusthe ego is not to be annihilated in Tantrik yoga but rather purified andinfinitely expanded. Since the ego simply means “what you think you are,”expanding it means expanding your sense of self, including more and more in yourself-definition. Ultimately, when the ego expands infinitely, you experience allthings in yourself and yourself in all things. There are no more boundaries toselfhood. When you experience all beings as part of yourself, you naturally actwith compassion and wisdom. This is the state of pūrṇo’ham vimarśa, which can betranslated several ways: “the perfect ‘I’-consciousness,” or “the awareness ‘Iam full and complete’”or “the awareness ‘the real I encompasses everything’.” Itis the state of complete all-inclusive expansion. Just as the mass of any objectaccelerated to the speed of light increases to infinity, in the same way whenthe ego reaches the state of complete expansion, it merges into the ocean ofConsciousness.TATTVA #14: DISCERNING FACULTY (buddhi)This is the most important mental faculty for all schools of yoga philosophy. Itis a key term in the Bhagavad-gītā and in Patañjali’s Yoga-sūtra. The buddhi isthe faculty of reason by which we formulate conceptions and make decisions. Itis the power of imagination. It is, most importantly for yogīs, the faculty ofdiscernment, by which we decide what is beneficial for us and what is not.Abhinava argues that discernment (tarka) is the highest of all the practices ofyoga, and the only one that directly leads to liberation. The most importantform of discernment on the spiritual path, he tells us, is discerning betweenwhat is to be held close (upādeya) and what is to be laid aside (heya)—that is,what is ultimately beneficial for us and what is not.And there’s the rub: what guarantee do we have that the buddhi is accurate inits discernment? In fact, we have ample evidence of its inaccuracy, for manytimes we choose what we think is beneficial, and it turns out not to be so. Ofcourse, this is not as huge a problem as it seems because on the path of Tantrikyoga most “mistakes” become advantages when regarded as growth opportunities.But since the learning from some mistakes is harder and more time-consuming thannecessary, we wish to constantly refine and improve our ability to choose whatis beneficial, and thereby increase our efficiency of movement on the path. Whydoes that seem so difficult?In yoga philosophy, the buddhi is impaired in its function by the presence ofwhat are called saṃskāras, or the subliminal impressions of past experiences. Incommon Sanskrit usage, a saṃskāra is literally an impression, like a footprintin the sand at the beach. Now, if there is a series of deep footprints and otherimpressions in the sand, when the tide comes in and the water flows over them,it will flow differently than if the sand were perfectly smooth. In preciselythe same way, when the energy of reality flows through your mind, it is affectedby the deep impressions of past experiences that are lodged there, and therebyit flows differently. Thus based on our experience of the past, we formulateprojections and make assumptions that too often are misaligned with the realityof the present. Our brains are good at pattern matching—perhaps too good, foreven a superficial resemblance of the current situation to a past situation willcause us to unconsciously assume that the present is like the past in most orall of its details. This act of unconsciously projecting the past onto thepresent is the primary reason we are unable to be aware of the reality of thecurrent situation as it is and, thereby, make good choices.The spiritual path is very much about developing clear vision, about cultivatingthe ability to see things as they really are. In classical yoga philosophy, thepractices of yoga (especially meditation) have the primary purpose of dissolvingthe saṃskāras in order to bring about this clear vision, and the cleardiscernment that results from it. The analogy that is often given is that ofpolishing a dirty mirror. When, through yoga, the mirror of the buddhi becomesclear, it can perfectly reflect the light of the divine Self. Thus, the more wepractice yoga, the more accurate our intuition and discernment become. Sometimespeople think great yoga masters can read minds or have other psychic abilities.In fact, they just see without obstruction, something so rare in our world thatit seems like a magical power. And indeed, knowledge is power—the only kind thatcannot be taken away. A master with a purified buddhi can always see the mostbeneficial course of action in any given situation, giving him or her a greatpower to change situations and uplift human beings.Finally, we should note that in Tantrik philosophy, the buddhi is not localizedin the brain but extends throughout the body. Thus saṃskāras of different kindsare distributed throughout the body and can be released by the physical as wellas the mental practices of yoga. We experience the buddhi on different levels ofthe body; for example, when we speak of “gut instinct,” we refer to an aspect ofthe buddhi’s intentionality associated with very deep, unconscious saṃskāras,subjectively associated with the viscera. However, without the practice of yoga,the gut instinct in which we place so much trust might lead us badly astray.TATTVA #13: SECONDARY MATERIALITY (prakṛti)Prakṛti, sometimes translated as “nature,” sometimes as “materiality,” reallyrefers to the entire physical universe of matter/energy. (Matter and energy wererecognized as aspects of each other by the early Indian philosophers, whereas inthe West the discovery is still so recent (Einstein, 1905) that we don’t have asingle word for matter/energy as Sanskrit does: prakṛti.) In the humanmicrocosm, prakṛti refers to the body/mind field. Just as matter and energy areaspects of each other, the body and mind are not separate, but on a continuum:the mind is the subtlest aspect of body and the body the most tangiblemanifestation of the mind. This is why dis-ease in the mind affects the body,and vice versa.Prakṛti can also refer to the unmanifest field of primordial materiality at thebeginning of the universe, out of which all the lower tattvas are created. Inthis form, prakṛti consists of perfect balance of the three guṇas or qualitiesof nature: sattva, lucidity and lightness; rajas, energy and passion; and tamas,darkness, heaviness, and inertia. These three guṇas recombine in variousproportions to create tattvas 14–36 (above). The field of prakṛti, then, iseverything that can become an object of consciousness; i.e., everything exceptthe following tattvas (1–12 below). However, note that in the Tantra, Prakṛti isdefined as “secondary materiality” because there is a higher principle, Māyā,which is the primary source of the universe (see tattva #6 below).TATTVA #12: INDIVIDUAL “SOUL” (puruṣa, the knowing subject, the Self, thewitness, pure consciousness, the embodied knower of the field; = ātman, jīva,kṣetrajña)The puruṣa sits at the top of the hierarchy of tattvas in the system of Sānkhyaand the classical yoga of Patañjali. For those non-Tantrik systems, it is theultimate principle, a transcendent reality: spirit as opposed to matter/energy.They propose that there are a plurality of divine Souls (each sentient beinghaving his own), that are not part of one overarching conscious entity. ForTantrik philosophy, it naturally follows, the puruṣa is not the highestprinciple for it does not express an all-encompassing View. Rather, puruṣa iscorrectly understood as contracted form of the universal Consciousness. It isindividuated consciousness, defined as Śiva veiled by five types of limitation(see below). In some systems of Indian philosophy, the individual soul is apermanent entity, but in Tantrik Shaivism it is a phase of contraction, andevery contraction gives way to expansion—in this case, the expansion back intothe absolute fullness of unlimited divine Awareness. So, the individual soul isnot permanent: though it may last for thousands of lifetimes, it is still a waveon the ocean of being. But how does Śiva, the absolute Consciousness, manifestitself in the form of an individual like you? By concealing its fullness withfive “veils.”The five Shells or Veils (kañcukas)Though we have been proceeding from the bottom up, it doesn’t make sense todiscuss the kañcukas that way, so we will proceed to tattvas 7 through 11, thenmove on to 6. The five kañcukas unfold directly from Māyā (tattva #6). They areusually discussed as the veils that contract Śiva’s self-awareness into that ofthe limited individual (jīva). However, in the original Tantrik tradition, theunderstanding is this: Prior to manifesting himself as a limited individual,fully expanded Śiva first contracts himself down to a single point of absolutelimitation, shedding his omnipotence, omniscience, and omnipresence completely.Then, in order to manifest as an embodied sentient being, he equips himself withfive limited capacities. These are the kañcukas, and the term literally means“shell” or “armor,” for these are the capacities necessary for experience andaction in the world of duality. However, it is true that kañcuka can also mean“covering,” and the most common way of presenting the kañcukas is as thecoverings that conceal the fullness of divine reality. Thus we can say that Śiva+ kañcukas = jīva (“individual soul”).42[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en42] (Note that when I say“Śiva” above, I really mean “Śiva-Śakti,” but the problem with pronouns makes iteasier to talk about Śiva.) Let us now explore these five kañcukas.TATTVA #7: LIMITED POWER OF ACTION (kalā)This is the fundamental kañcuka; the others all follow from God’s self-imposedlimitation on his power of action, his omnipotence. Note that kalā does not mean“powerlessness” but rather “limited power.” Kalā is in fact that principle whichanimates the individual soul’s capacities to a greater or lesser degree. Each ofthe five kañcukas, far from being a negative force, is the limited form of adivine Power. We seek to cultivate them, expanding them through spiritualpractice. Thus kalā in its fully expanded form is simply the omnipotentkriyā-śakti or the Power of divine Action. Note that kalā also means a sliver ofthe moon, i.e., the amount that the moon grows in a single day. On the spiritualpath, we are waxing from a mere sliver of divine power toward the total fullnessof our capacity to express our innate divinity.TATTVA #8: LIMITED POWER OF KNOWLEDGE (vidyā)The second veil is not ignorance but incomplete knowledge. The problem of thiskañcuka is not that we know nothing but that we know a little bit and think thatthat is all there is to know. The “shell” (kañcuka) of vidyā protects us byallowing us to understand something about our world. But when we believe that weknow what life is like, that we have an understanding that is complete except inthe trivial details, when in fact we are seeing only a small fragment of thetrue reality, we disallow the possibility of divine illumination. As I onceread, “When a man looks at the horizon of his own knowledge and believes he seesthe horizon of knowledge itself, then he is truly lost.” Yet, this very limitedknowledge that binds us to a contracted experience of what reality is, is itselfsimply a limited form of the divine Power of Knowing or jñāna-śakti. Thus, it isusually not the case that what we know about life is wrong but rather that itneeds to be situated in a larger context, integrated into a moreall-encompassing vision. On the spiritual path we seek to ever expand ourunderstanding; this may be why Abhinava Gupta calls this same powerunmeṣa-śakti, the Power of Unfolding. This unfolding is fueled by our intentionand our practice of self-aware reflection, supported by the contemplation of thescriptures and the words of our teachers. But in the expansion of our limitedpower of knowledge, we of course seek to move beyond words to an inner knowing,an embodied experiential knowledge that the word-based understanding of theintellect can only approximate.TATTVA #9: DESIRE (rāga)When the fully expanded Consciousness contracts into the form of an individual,it experiences itself as incomplete or imperfect and therefore desires whateverit thinks it needs for completion. This desire is called rāga, most accuratelytranslated as “the nonspecific craving for worldly experience.”43[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en43] It is nonspecific in thesense that it is a craving for something not quite known that gets rationalizedas a specific desire based on each individual’s life experience, e.g., love,sex, admiration, money, power. But in fact all craving is truly craving for onlyone thing: the fullness of divine Consciousness. Therefore, when any otherdesire gets fulfilled, it is found to be unsatisfactory; the craving stillremains.The literal meaning of the word rāga is “color,” for like dye these desiressaturate and even stain the mind, influencing how we see things and people. Inthe Tantra, however, desire is not a problem but an opportunity, an opportunityto follow that desire back to the source and realize that what we really craveis fullness, wholeness—that we will be satisfied by nothing less than knowing(and being) God. Thus we come to understand that rāga is the limited form of thedivine icchā-śakti or the Power of Will, the deep impulse to express thefullness of our authentic being. From this perspective, desire teaches us aboutthose areas of life in which we may need to expand and express ourselves morefully or authentically. We can choose to activate our icchā-śakti in thoseareas, flowing forth our intentionality from a place of fullness, not of lack.But as long as you are ignorant of the true nature of desire, as long as youbelieve that possessing something outside of yourself (whether tangible orintangible) will somehow permanently or completely fulfill you, you willcontinue to experience an insatiable void, an emptiness that cannot be filled,and an inexplicable angst that will burden you until the last day of your life.It is primarily this rāga, our craving for more, that propels us into anotherbirth and another round of suffering. But again, rāga should not be rejected buttransmuted. In the mythological tales, even Lord Śiva had an addiction togambling and wine, a craving that he transformed into an addiction to“shattering the fear of all beings in all worlds” (Siva-mahimnaḥ Stotram). Thefirst step in such transmutation is tracing desire back to its source andrealizing your longing for divine fullness, letting that longing soften yourheart and compel you to seek true connection to the One.TATTVA #10: TIME (kāla)44[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en44]The fourth of the prerequisites for embodied experience is Time. Instead of thetimeless simultaneity of absolute Consciousness, for which the entire universeis a single complex creation including all times, embodied beings generallyexperience time at the slow crawl of one second per second. This also means thatwe experience time sequentially, with one thing following another in a processof continual change (though some sources tell us that change is mere appearanceand what really happens is that the Goddess Kālī devours the whole universe eachinstant and then recreates it anew in a slightly different form, hundreds oftimes each second).We are often burdened by our awareness of past and future—endless regrets andhopeful expectations, worry and anxiety—yet it is because of that very awarenessthat we can grow. As the great German philosopher Martin Heidegger says, we arebeings who always have our past with us and are always growing toward ourfuture. That is what makes us different from other animals. So, as usual inTantrik philosophy, the very thing that causes us suffering is also the means ofour fulfillment once we shift our attitude toward it and our understanding ofit. We do not seek to be entirely in the present moment the way animals are,with no conscious awareness of past and future. Rather, we seek to be centeredin the present moment, aware of our past behind us and our future ahead of uswhile being free of the four modes of escaping the experience of thenow—guilt/regret, nostalgic reverie, fantasy, and anxiety. This is to transcendtime even while being in time.[image/now_chart.jpg]When you look at the chart, if you’re like most people, you’ll acknowledge thestress and dis-ease caused by guilt and worry but think there is nothing wrongwith nostalgia and fantasy. Yoga psychology challenges this notion, telling usthat losing ourselves in fantasy is as detrimental to us as being obsessed byworry because fantasizing is equally effective in removing us from fullawareness of the present. The present is what is real, and it is what we arecalled to respond to. In fact, the only way your hopes for the future can everbecome a reality in the present is by careful attention to the details ofpresent-moment reality. A more accurate perspective would be to accept thatthere is no future per se but only a constantly flowing present, which, throughclose and reverent attention, reveals its divinity ever more to the yogī. Inthis way we can learn to experience ourselves as a whole being, with our pastand future part of our present, without grasping toward either. In this way wecan become free of the net of Time, entering into eternally flowing simultaneity(nityodita).TATTVA #11: CAUSALITY (niyati)Niyati is the force that binds us to our karmas; it is the law of cause andeffect that ensures we shall reap as we have sown. Because of niyati, you arecertain to experience the results of your own karmic actions, not anyone else’s.A karmic action is a morally charged action motivated by a desire to attain oravoid a particular result. When we learn to perform actions as service orsacrifice, investing in the process but unattached to the final outcome, thoseactions have no karmic charge and therefore do not bind us, whatever the resultmay be. Thus the liberated being is no longer bound by niyati, fate, and is freefrom karma, though he or she may still undergo the fruits of karmas accruedbefore liberation.Niyati is also associated with specific place (deśa), because it is your uniqueset of karmas that determines your location. That is, because of your karmas,you are born on the Earth, living where you do and not in another city, country,or planet. Thus the inverse of niyati, or rather its full expansion, isall-pervasiveness or nonlocality.TATTVA #6: MāyāNow we come to the top of the hierarchy of manifest reality, the highestprinciple that is not the Absolute itself. In other traditions, māyā meansillusion or delusion, but not so in Tantra. Māyā is the “world-source”(jagad-yoni), the Divine’s power to project itself into manifestation. It isalso the power of differentiation by which the One appears as many. Māyā is notgiven a negative valuation in the Tantra, even though it does in a sense deludeus into seeing duality where there is only unity; for seeing dualistically is anecessary part of the process of Self-exploration that the Divine has freelychosen by manifesting a universe in the first place. Māyā is the power theDivine uses in the creative expression of its nature. The paradox of Māyā isthat the power that creates the apparent differentiation that causes so muchtrouble is the very same power God that uses to glorify Himself. Māyā is theform of the Goddess that constitutes all manifest reality, blessing us with theopportunity for the more challenging—and therefore deeper—realization ofunity-in-diversity. Look around you right now and see a flash of the truth:everything that is happening is Her play. Just as we form different ornamentsout of pure gold and call them earrings, necklace, bracelet, anklet, and so on,in the same way all things of this universe are made of one substance, theenergy-body of the Goddess, and differ from one another only in name, form, andfunction, not in essence.THE PURE UNIVERSE (śuddhādhvan)The so-called Pure Universe comprising the top five tattvas is not a place; itis the divine Reality that pervades the whole of the manifest universe. The topfive tattvas are essentially a description of God/dess. Though divided into fivelevels, they are all aspects of the Divine and are referred to as phases ofGod’s awareness. The differences between them are differences of perspective andemphasis. To reach any of the five tattvas of the Pure Universe is to attaincomplete liberation and awakening.TATTVA #5: PURE MANTRA-WISDOM (Śuddha-vidyā)The level of Pure Wisdom is also the level of mantra (besides meaning “wisdom,”vidyā is also the feminine word for “mantra”). The wisdom spoken of here is notany type of intellectual knowledge but rather the various phases of Śiva-Śakti’sself-awareness expressed in the form of the seventy million mantras—all themantras that have ever existed or will ever exist. For the Tantrik tradition,mantras are actually conscious beings, analogous to angels in the Westernreligions. Someone who attains liberation on the level of tattva #5 becomes amantra-being. We know that this doctrine, that mantras are conscious, was takenseriously because the texts tell us that if a guru grants initiation into theTantra to someone who subsequently falls from the path, then that guru mustperform a special ritual to apologize to the mantras for putting them to workneedlessly.It is absolutely crucial to understand that in this tradition a mantra, itsdeity, and its goal are all one and the same. Thus, for example, Lakṣmī’s mantraOṃ śrīṃ mahālakṣmyai namaḥ is the Goddess Lakṣmī in sound form; it is her sonicbody. Nor is her mantra something separate from the goal for which it isrepeated, i.e., to cultivate abundance, for it is the very vibration ofabundance (and, as well, the other qualities of Śrī: elegance, charm, grace,beauty, prosperity, and auspiciousness). So, all the various “deities” of Indianspirituality exist on the level of the Śuddha-vidyā tattva as phases ofŚiva-Śakti’s awareness, the many facets, if you will, of the One jewel. Further,there are countless mantra-beings on the Śuddha-vidyā level that do notcorrespond to known Indian deities; perhaps we can suppose that the deities ofall spiritual traditions exist on this level, insofar as they can be understoodas having sonic forms.One who reaches liberation on this level sees the entire universe as a diversearray of energies, but with a single essence. She sees no static matter,experiencing everything as interacting patterns of vibration. The wonder of thatwhich she sees takes precedence over her I-sense, though there is unity betweenthem: “I am this!” (idam evāham).The divine Power that corresponds to this level is kriyā-śakti, the Power ofAction. This is so because the primary characteristic of mantras is that theyare agents of transformative change, i.e., of action.TATTVA #4: THE LORD (Īśvara)This is the level of the personal God, God as a being with specific qualities,that is, the Deity that can be named in various languages (whether the name beKriṣhṇa, Allāh, Avalokiteśvara, YHWH, etc.) This is the level of reality thatmost monotheistic religions presume to be the highest. Īśvara is a generic,nonsectarian term for God (also found in Patañjali’s Yoga-sūtra).This level is associated with jñāna-śakti, the Power of Knowing, for Īśvaraholds within His being the knowledge of the subtle pattern that will be used inthe creation of the universe. He empowers His regents on tattva #5 (who arereally aspects of Himself) to stimulate the primordial homogenous world-source(Māyā, tattva #6) with this pattern, “churning” her so that she begins toproduce the differentiation of the lower tattvas, starting with the contractionscalled the kañcukas (#7 and below, see “the five shells[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-11_split_000.xhtml#fiveshells]”).At the level of Īśvara there is a balanced equality and identity between God andHis incipient creation. The Sanskrit phrase said to express the experience ofreality at this level is aham idam idam aham, or “I am This; This am I.”45[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en45] There is a fascinatingand purely “coincidental” parallel here with the self-declaration of the God ofthe Hebrew Bible, who when asked for His name (at Exodus 3:14), replied simply,ehyeh Asher ehyeh, “I am That I am.”In Śaiva Tantra, it is not only God who exists at this level; so do any beingswho have reached that same awareness. Thus the difference between Īśvara andother beings abiding at tattva #4 is one of office, not of nature.TATTVA #3: THE EVER-BENEVOLENT ONE (Sadāśiva)The word “God” is no longer applicable here, for this level transcends any formof a Deity with identifiable names or attributes. This is the level on whichonly the slightest subtle differentiation has just begun to emerge between theabsolute Deity and the idea of the universe, the universe that S/he will createout of Him/Herself. Thus, it is the level of icchā-śakti, the divine Will Power,the creative urge or primal impulse toward Self-expression. The Sanskrit phrasesaid to express the experience of reality at this level is aham idam, “I amthis,” or “This incipient totality is my own Self,” where there is identitybetween the Divine and the embryonic universe held within it. The sense of “I”has clear priority, wholly enveloping the “this”; so all beings who attainunity-consciousness with emphasis on the “I” pole abide at this level.The Sadāśiva-tattva is the first movement into differentiation, for at the levelof tattvas #1 and 2, there is absolute nonduality. Abhinava Gupta tells us thatthe Divine at this level is called Sadāśiva, “eternally Śiva,” to remind us thateven as a universe begins to come into being through the power of the Will, theAbsolute loses none of its divinity, it is “still Śiva,” which of course alsomeans “still blessed.”Historically, Sadāśiva is also the name of the high deity of one form of ŚaivaTantra, a form that was later surpassed by the worship of the conjoined andco-equal pair of Śiva-Śakti. He is also pictured as the form of Śiva thatsprouts the five faces that speak the five streams of sacred scripture. ThusSadāśiva is sometimes considered the first ray of divine compassion.TATTVA #2: POWER / THE GODDESS (Śakti)In the traditional tattva hierarchy, Śakti is #2, but in the nondual schools,care is taken to emphasize that Śiva and Śakti switch places, for they are twosides of the same coin. That is, neither Śiva nor Śakti has priority—it is amatter of which aspect is dominant in any given experience.The word śakti literally means “power, potency, energy, capacity, capability.”In NŚT, all powers are worshipped as goddesses, or rather as forms of theGoddess (Mahādevī). Śakti can no more be separated from Śiva than heat can beseparated from fire. All forms of energy are Śakti, and since matter is energy(as the Tāntrikas well knew), the whole manifest universe is seen as the body ofthe Goddess, and the movements of all forms of energy are Her dance. The variousaspects of Śakti are covered in detail above.The term śakti is often used to specifically denote spiritual energy, or God’stransformative power. In the scriptures, this meaning is often conveyed with thespecial term rudra-śakti, which refers to the primal, awe-inspiring divine Powerthat flows through us in spiritual experience. An infusion of this divine Poweris called rudra-śakti-samāveśa, where samāveśa refers to the spiritualexperience comprising an expansion of consciousness, a dissolution of theboundaries between self and other, a sharing of self-hood with God and/or withthe whole universe, and often an blissful influx of energy.TATTVA #1: THE BENEVOLENT ONE (Śiva)In the context of NŚT, Śiva is not the name of a god. Rather, the word isunderstood to signify the peaceful, quiescent ground of all Reality, theinfinite silence of transcendent Divinity, or, in the poet’s phrase, the “stillpoint at the center of the turning world.” While Śakti is extroversive,immanent, manifest, omniform, and dynamic, Śiva is introversive, transcendent,unmanifest, formless, and still. Śiva is the absolute void of pureConsciousness. (To be more accurate, Consciousness is never absolutely still, soon the level of the Śiva-tattva, there is what Abhinava calls kiṃcit-calana, anextraordinarily subtle movement, an imperceptible and exquisitely sweetundulation.)The word śiva is traditionally interpreted as “that in which all things lie(śī).” Thus Śiva is the ground of being, that which gives reality its coherence.His nature is beyond any qualities and is, therefore, difficult to express inwords, but in Essence of the Tantras, Śiva is described as the coherence andunification of all the various śaktis. Thus, He is called śaktimān, the one whoholds the Powers, or rather “holds space” for their unfolding. However, sinceŚiva is literally nothing without the Powers of Consciousness, Bliss, Will, andso on, it is usually Śakti who is worshipped as the highest principle in NŚT.Śiva is that which grounds and coheres the various powers; He is the Lord of theFamily (kuleśvara), the center axis of the spinning wheel of Powers. As thecoherent force, Śiva hardly has an insignificant function, but as he is not anembodiment of potency himself, he is less likely to attract worship in aspiritual system that is focused primarily on the empowerment of its adherents.The previous paragraph defined Śiva primarily as spaciousness, the hosting spacefor the energy that is Śakti. This space/energy polarity is the one given in aTrika text called Vijñāna-bhairava, among other sources. We should note that inother contexts, the roles are defined differently. For example, the influentialRecognition school (a subset of the Trika) defines Śiva-Śakti as the twocomplementary aspects of one divine Consciousness: Śiva is the Light ofManifestation (prakāśa), also known as the Light of Consciousness (cit-prakāśa),and Śakti is blissful Self-reflective awareness (vimarśa). This pairing issometimes concisely abbreviated as cid-ānanda (Awareness-Bliss). In this way ofunderstanding Śiva-Śakti, He is the illuminative power of Consciousness thatmanifests and shines as all things, and She is the power by which that sameConsciousness folds back on itself and becomes self-aware and thus can enjoyitself. While new students of the Tantra often want a simple, cut-and-drieddefinition of the polarity of Śiva-Śakti, the tradition does not offer one.Indeed, as this paragraph has shown, we get different definitions within thevery same school. These need not be seen as contradictory, however, for theultimate reality of Śiva-Śakti transcends all thought; the diverse explanationsare just varying orientations or angles of approach to that one Reality, servingdifferent students in different contexts.In another schema, that of the radical Krama school, Śiva disappears entirely,for there the two aspects of the One are represented as different facets of oneGoddess: the indescribable Void of absolute potential, the formless ground ofall reality (Śiva’s usual role) is represented as the dark and emaciated,terrifyingly attractive Goddess Kālī, who devours all things and makes them onewith Herself; and the infinite Light that encompasses all things and beings withloving compassion and insight is represented as white and full-bodied GoddessParā, overflowing with boundless nectar. But, Abhinava Gupta stresses, theseapparent opposites (black and white, empty and full) are simply the two forms ofthe one great Goddess. The Krama school simply wishes to avoid the inevitablydualistic implications of the image of Śiva-Śakti as two beings joined together.How to reconcile these different presentations? The answer is simple: they needno reconciliation, for they are each perfectly fitted to the system in whichthey occur; and the absolute Reality beyond words can be represented by any ofthese schemas or by none.It is important to note that the term Śiva or “God” never loses its importancein this tradition. Some might construe the more refined philosophies of NŚT asatheistic because they wholly repudiate the notion of God as a separate person,“a guy in the sky,” or indeed as anything separate from your essence-nature asdynamic free Awareness. Yet it is significant that these very traditionscontinue to use the term “God” and its synonyms (such as maheśvara, “the GreatLord,” and parameśvara, “the Supreme Divinity”). It seems to me that they do notwant to dispense with the love and devotion that is inspired in so many by thispersonalizing of the Absolute. They want a path of intimate relationship. At thesame time, remember that the tradition gives us a beautiful nondual definitionof the word “God,” one worth repeating:...in actuality it is the unbounded Light of Consciousness, reposing in itsinnate Bliss, fully connected to its Powers of Willing, Knowing, and Acting,that we call God. (Essence of the Tantras)It is in the context of this definition that we may understand such scripturalstatements as “Nothing exists that is not God.”46[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en46] But here we areanticipating the next segment: for “beyond” even tattva #1 is that which unfoldsall the tattvas, from 1 to 36, within itself as the expression of its blissfulself-awareness.TATTVA #0: THE HEART (Śiva/Śakti in perfect fusion)This secret tattva, taught only in the esoteric nondual Tantrik sources, is thekey to understanding the whole philosophy of nondual Tantra. It is #0 because itdoes not crown the hierarchy, for as we have seen, the “highest” tattva isabsolutely transcendent Śiva. But the Ultimate Principle (paramārtha), tattva#0, is not transcendent; for to transcend is to go beyond and, thus, to exclude.In nondual understanding, the Ultimate must be that which simultaneouslytranscends and encompasses all things. It is the supreme paradox, for itexpresses itself as the very substance of all things while simultaneously beingsomething more than simply the sum of all perceptible realities. This absoluteprinciple cannot be written in the tattva list, for it pervades the whole as theindefinable essence of all things, manifest or unmanifest. It is absolutelyincomprehensible by the mind. Abhinava says:This whole universe is One Reality—unbroken by time, uncircumscribed by space,unclouded by attributes, unconfined by forms, inexpressible by words, andimpossible to understand with the ordinary means of knowledge. (Essence of theTantras)This all-pervasive and ultimate Reality, subtler than the subtlest, beyond thehighest transcendent Śiva and yet closer to you than your own breath, equallypresent in the most sublime refined pure awareness of infinite openness and inthe scent of the foulest excrement, its radiantly beautiful divine nature nevertainted though it shines equally in the form of all that is called pure andimpure—this is what Abhinava’s lineage calls the Heart (hṛdaya) or the Essence(sāra) of Reality. He also gives it more mysterious names, citing thescriptures: he calls it Visarga, the Absolute Potential, Spanda, the Vibration,Ūrmi, the Wave, Dṛk, the Vision, and Yāmala, the Couple: the perfect fusion ofŚiva and Śakti as one. It is this same ultimate principle that is worshipped inradically nondual Goddess Tantra as Kālī Kāla-sankarṣaṇī: the radiant Dark, theresounding Silence, the Devourer of Time—by which is meant the timeless groundof the cycle of creation, stasis, and dissolution.This is the doctrine of “the higher nonduality” (paramādvaya) which subsumesboth duality and ordinary nonduality. It is all-encompassing, including evenduality as a level within the Real, whereas ordinary nonduality simply negatesduality as wrong or false. But duality is a level of reality, an undeniableexperience, and a meaningful realm of discourse, so no system is complete thatsimply denies it. And just as duality is superseded by the more encompassingtruth of nonduality, that too is superseded, and subsumed, by theall-encompassing truth of the higher nonduality.This Heart, this Vibration, this Essence, is the light by which all things areilluminated, the reality by which all things are real. It is the omnipresentdivinity, manifest equally in all things. Philosophers tend to object to thisarticulation of the nature of reality, saying that if everything is equallydivine, the word “divine” loses its meaning and value, because something hasvalue only in opposition to something else that doesn’t. While this objection isperfectly rational, it is operating on a level of understanding that forTāntrikas is superseded by the immediate mystical experience that initiatesshare—an experience in which everything is indeed perceived as equally suffusedwith beautiful divine radiance, in which the total freedom and joy of beingpermeate the entire sphere of perception, and in which no phenomena whatsoevercan be perceived as anything less than absolutely perfect. This vision ofreality has been labeled “transrational” because of the fact that it cannot befully understood by the ordinary mind, despite the fact that the one who has hadthe experience usually considers it the most intensely real experience of herlife. (Even this experience, though, is merely a pointer to the state of abidingin oneness with the ground of reality, which is not an experience per se, sinceall experiences come and go. Nothing can be said in words about the non-state ofnirvāṇa, permanently abiding in the Heart of reality.)This is not to say that in this expanded mode of perception, everything isconsidered the same. In fact, diversity is very much a part of this aestheticmode, as this way of seeing celebrates all things as different expressions ofone reality. In fact, every thing is beautiful to the Tāntrika precisely becauseit expresses the One principle differently. Every sentient being is worthy ofreverence because she expresses her Godhood in a unique manner, never seenbefore and never to be seen again.The spiritual experience of one Divinity pulsating joyously in all that exists,as well as paradoxically present in the repose in the non-state of completestillness and emptiness, is considered a gift of divine grace. Yet it can onlybe fully understood, cultivated, and firmly rooted as abiding realizationthrough spiritual practice.the three impurities(with an excursus on thedescent of power)Though the tattva schema purports to be a complete account of all the principlesof reality, there are three important principles not enumerated in that list.(Some consider them as aspects of māyā-tattva; others suggest they are not inthe list because they are not truly real.) These are the three malas, or“impurities” (not to be confused with mālā, which is a garland or rosary). Thethree malas constitute our experience of bondage. From the nondual viewpoint,they are not truly stains; they are simply ignorance, or rather limitedperception, which Consciousness has taken on in order to become a finiteindividual, and which it can choose to relinquish at any time. The first andmost basic of the three is the āṇava-mala or “Impurity of Individuality”; thesecond is the māyīya-mala or “Impurity of Differentiation”, and the third is thekārma-mala or “Impurity of Action”, We will look at each in turn.the impurity of individualityThe Impurity of Individuality is fundamental because the other two Impuritiescould not exist without it and also because it constitutes the very basis of thelimitation that makes us finite beings. This is the fundamental form ofignorance. It consists of the deep unconscious belief that you are incompleteand imperfect, a tiny insignificant creature, certainly not the Divine. It isthe belief that you are limited and powerless, unworthy and meaningless. Evenmore basically, it is the belief that something is missing or else deeply wrongwith you, a belief that prevents you from knowing and revering yourself asdivine. I called it an unconscious belief, but it is more accurate to say it ispreconscious for it informs all our thoughts and perceptions; it is a way ofseeing reality held at the deepest level of our individual being. Āṇava-mala isthe primary cause of our suffering, the ignorance (= skewed or partial view)from which all other errors of perception stem. Remember that in this system, tohold a vision of reality that is not in alignment with the actual nature ofreality is the only cause of suffering. Believing that we are incomplete andimperfect and separate from God, which is the most untrue thing that we couldbelieve, causes us terrible suffering for precisely that reason: it does notallow us to experience reality, that is, to access the universal Consciousnessthat is always already flowing in us and in all things and whose nature isfreedom and bliss.Here I’m using the word “belief.” But we must take care not to misunderstand.This is not a matter of correcting an intellectual misapprehension or adheringto the correct doctrine. For āṇava-mala is not a mental construct programmedinto us by society. It is the limited sense of individuality that makes possiblethe whole process of the formation of dualistic thought-forms. Thus, it cannotbe countered by merely attempting to believe the opposite. You must have theactual experience of pūrṇatā—of fullness, completeness, divine perfection—deepwithin your own being, and you must have it so frequently or powerfully that itdisplaces āṇava-mala and becomes your basic reference point for who you are.As you might expect, in Tantrik philosophy the very condition of contractedindividuality contains within it the seed of the possibility for expanding backinto our natural state of absolute fullness. Everyone has āṇava-mala, so as soonas they are self-aware, everyone has the feeling that “something’s missing” or“something’s not quite right” or “there’s more to life, more to me, than this!”That mala-driven perception points to a real truth: you are not accuratelyperceiving the whole of your real nature. For most of us, the spiritual pathbegins when we perceive that something is missing, and also we realize that itis not romance or money or power or fame that will be able to fill the voidwithin. We become seekers on the path when we feel this acutely and realize thatit will only be addressed by a fundamental shift in our very experience ofreality. When we begin to feel that there is a reality beyond what we have knownor even suspected, beyond what we have been taught to believe—something vast andall-encompassing and deeply real—then we open ourselves to that greater reality.In other words, the process of contraction comes to an end when we no longerbelieve, way deep down, that our limited experience of reality is all there isto know. At that moment, we begin turning toward expansion, initiating a new arcin the movement of our soul, an arc that will necessarily terminate in theall-encompassing fullness of being that alone can satiate the hunger ofConsciousness.Though it is absolutely true that your belief that there is something wrong withyou as you are—or that you are missing something to be complete—is the deepestform of ignorance, it is nonetheless real. You cannot simply be convinced out ofit. Otherwise, just reading this book would be all you needed to do. Since thisignorance is not intellectual but rather is the very organizing principle ofyour limited individuality, only a powerful revelation can begin to dislodge it.This initiatory experience is called śakti-pāta, or the Descent of Power (alsotranslated as “the Descent of Grace”). It is your initial awakening to your realnature. Without it the āṇava-mala holds sway over your experience of life, andwithout it the practices of yoga cannot bear their real fruit.śaktipāta: the descent of powerThe scriptures clarify that the Descent of Power is not a literal descent ofenergy from heaven or some higher place, though for some it can feel like that;rather, it is an awakening of the divine Power (śakti) within you that will leadyou to your ultimate liberation. It is in fact more like an ascent than adescent; but the term śaktipāta is used both because it is inherited fromearlier Śaiva tradition and because the word “pāta” (“descent”) has theconnotation of a sudden, forceful fall, a startling experience that comes out ofthe blue, as it were. Śaktipāta is unprecedented, a primordial opening to adeeper level of being. Furthermore, the language of descent (or ascent) connotesthat the awakening in question is truly a vertical movement, because it takes usout of the endless fruitless horizontal circling of our “normal” life, openingus to the greater reality.As mentioned above, there comes a moment in the existence of an embodied soul(perhaps after many lifetimes) when it is done with the phase of contraction andbegins to turn toward its own expansion. This turning may take place deep insideyour being; you may not even be aware of it at first. But things that seemedexciting or fulfilling before—like gaining wealth, having lots of friends,getting wasted, making sexual conquests, being praised by others—no longer seemto do it for you. For most this “world-weariness” is a necessary step in openingto a deeper reality. The longer the gap of time between the subtle turn inward,toward expansion and the occurrence of śaktipāta or sudden awakening, the moreintensely felt that awakening is. So, some people receive a very intenseśaktipāta, consisting often of a mystical experience of their oneness with allreality, or of their true nature as unborn, uncreated, eternal Essence, or ofall reality bathed in unitary light of compassionate love, or of energy shootingup their spine and exploding in their head, or of waves of bliss surging intheir body, and so on. Others receive a śaktipāta so subtle that it is almostimperceptible. The difference between these two is not that the former person ismore blessed than the latter. It is simply that that person waited longer fortheir śaktipāta, and thus their longing (whether conscious or unconscious)became ever more intense and thereby, when the conditions were right, triggereda more intense awakening. (It’s just like firewood—the longer it dries out, themore quickly and completely it catches fire when a flame comes near.) But theawakening is the same in both cases in the sense that it sets the personirrevocably on the path to total integration with divine reality. The personwith the imperceptible śaktipāta also has her life transformed as a result; butbecause she didn’t wait as long for it, her belief that worldly enjoyments mightfulfill her is stronger, and thus she draws a less intense śaktipāta to her.(Note that this doctrine corrects the false view that those with more intenseśaktipātas are more spiritual or special or worthy.) The important thing,however, is that the awakening has occurred.If you’ve had an imperceptible śaktipāta, you might wonder whether it hashappened at all. The most significant thing about it, again, is not theexperience but its effect on your life. I will briefly describe some signs andsymptoms of this awakening. One of the most important signs is subtle butsignificant: when you close your eyes, take some slow, deep breaths, and turnyour attention within, there is immediately a sense of presence, a sweetness injust being with your inner self. Those who have not received śaktipāta havelittle patience for turning within; they don’t see the point, for they don’tsense the Divine there. Furthermore, those who have received the Descent ofPower manifest substantial changes in their lives, including some or all ofthese:❖ You find worldly forms of “fun” are less satisfying.❖ You are fascinated by spiritual teachings, even if you don’t understand them.❖ You find yourself drawn to eat healthier food or otherwise honor your body.❖ You feel respect or reverence towards spiritual teachers or those who havededicated themselves to the path.❖ Tears of joy or gratitude well up spontaneously, especially when witnessingacts of compassion or devotion.❖ Your creative capacity is unleashed.❖ Mantras are effective for you.❖ Yogic practices, especially meditation, yield a significant benefit, even ifthey are challenging.❖ You experience yourself as more vulnerable and sensitive, yet somehow morestrong.❖ You find it harder (for a time) to relate to friends who have no apparentspiritual sensitivity.❖ When you read the words of a great spiritual master, they resonate on a deeplevel of your being, and you “get” them, even if you can’t explain them.❖ When you get quiet and turn within, you feel a subtle “presence.”The experience of śaktipāta, when it is medium or strong grade, gives a taste ofwhat the final state is like. It is a temporary immersion—whether for a fewmoments or days—into our true nature. From this perspective we see things asthey really are: one infinite Light of Consciousness vibrating at differentwavelengths in a joyous interconnected dance. Often it takes the form ofexperiencing oneself as profoundly connected to the Divine in some way. Peoplewho receive a strong śaktipāta of this variety often make the mistake ofbelieving that they are now enlightened, that the beginning of their path is infact the end. This mistake can be very hard on the person’s loved ones, and ifs/he clings to it, it can even occasionally bring about a psychotic break thattakes some time to heal. It is important to see the value of what you havereceived while retaining the humility of realizing that this gift of grace issimply to show that the fully expanded state is real and worth striving for; itis not the final attainment. For a more detailed explanation of śaktipāta, seepart 3.the unfolding of one’s awakeningIn fact, you need to be shown that the goal is worth striving for preciselybecause of how challenging the path can be. In order to complete the process ofexpanding back into the fullness of your divine nature, you will have to let goof everything you think you are. You will have to let go of every image or ideayou have of yourself, the “positive” ones as well as the “negative” ones. Whyshould this be the case? Because the state of all-encompassing fullness andwholeness (pūrṇatā) that is the goal of the path—your already existent ultimatenature—is by definition one in which you experience that the pattern of thewhole of reality exists within you and that your identity is not defined by onepart more than by any other. In other words, to experience identity with theall-encompassing divine Absolute, you must necessarily relinquish identificationwith some limited aspect of it—that aspect you habitually call “me.” It is yourclinging to your limited identity that is precisely what prevents you fromexperiencing the Whole within yourself.When I say that you will have to let go of “positive” self-images as well asnegative ones, I do not mean to imply that you discard your positive virtues;rather, you let go of the story about yourself that is based on those virtues.This is necessary because the self-image that you are a “good person” carrieswith it a raft of “shoulds” that ironically prevents you from expressing yourinnate virtue in a way that is organically responsive to the actuality of thepresent situation. Your real virtue is not based on a story about yourself; itis a natural expression of your essence-nature.Nor does this process of letting go of everything you think yourself to beentail abandoning your roles and responsibilities in life. For what is at issueis not whether you are a wife, or mother, or doctor, but whether you identifyyourself as that and that alone—and thus define and limit and circumscribe yourexperience of reality through those identifications. In other words, you don’tneed to run away from all those responsibilities to attain liberation, becauseliberation in the Tantrik sense means going from the experience of being trappedin your life situation to the experience of continuously perceiving that you arethe infinite creative Light of divine Presence, joyously playing the role of awife, or mother, or doctor, and doing so in service to all beings. The metaphorof the actor and his role is perfect here: Does an actor feel miserable playinga role on stage, even the part of a tragic figure? No, because he knows that hewill relinquish the role, that he is not bound by it, and that he will return towhat he has never forgotten: his real identity. In fact, even as on one levelthe actor does experience the misery of his character, on a deeper level heexperiences great joy in playing his part well! Imagine what your life would belike if you had that experience of joy in all your roles, if you retained awordless awareness of your fundamental expansive, all-encompassing, complete,and perfect nature even as you went about performing the most mundane of tasks.So, the whole process of sādhanā, walking the spiritual path, is the process ofremoving the āṇava-mala, the Impurity of Individuality, of limited identity andlack of wholeness. Its final removal is the state of liberation. Though it isthe primary “stain” or obscuration of the transparent light of our being,preventing our clear vision, it is also the beneficial nagging sense of missingsomething important that prompts us to seek and find the Truth. So, as always inTantra, nothing is downright bad; everything, even the āṇava-mala, serves adivine purpose.the impurity of differentiationThe Impurity of Differentiation is that form of ignorance that causes us toperceive dualistically, that is, to see differences but not the underlyingunity. It is the māyīya-mala that causes us to feel separate from all otherbeings, and from that which we perceive. The fundamental form of the māyīya-malais subject-object differentiation. This means that you perceive the objects ofyour awareness as something separate and different from yourself. This wrongview leads either to a sense of the world as a persecuting threat or as a sourceof things to acquire. This is ignorance, for as we have seen, anything thatexists within your consciousness is necessarily already an aspect of yourself.True seeing is seeing all beings within yourself and yourself within all beings.Only when we are focused on the most superficial layer of reality doesdifference seem to be the most fundamental reality.Imagine, if you will, a massive continent with many mountains, mostly submergedunder an ocean but with many of the mountain peaks poking above the surface ofthe water. A person who had never gone below the surface would see thosemountains as separate unconnected islands. But someone who had made the effortto explore the inner depths of the ocean would realize that there was only onelandmass, extruding at various points into the air. In the same way, allmanifest, conscious beings are extrusions into the tangible world of thesingular, continuous Being that alone exists. This analogy is imperfect (as allare) because, in truth, that one Being has become the ocean of the tangible,perceptible world as well. The analogy often used in the original tradition isthat all perceptibles constitute the single body of that one Being, and allperceivers constitute its one soul.A person who is not aware of this truth will see an object of her perception assomething separate from her. But in reality, anything you perceive is nothingother than a vibration of conscious energy within your awareness. Theconsequences of not realizing this are tremendous. When you perceive otherbeings as different and separate from you, you do not bother to understandthings from their point of view, failing to realize that to do so would alsogive you insight into yourself. In an us-versus-them view of things, you mighteven consider the other an enemy and feel justified in killing him if he opposesyour interests. (You might say, “Oh, but I would never kill anyone”—yet thegovernment that acts on your behalf does just that.) By contrast, when you arein the process of overcoming māyīya-mala, you realize that another human being,even one whose actions you condemn, is no different from you, only withdifferent pressures, programs, and life circumstances. You might have done thesame thing in his shoes. Seeing this truth, condemnation gives way tocompassion. When you begin to see through māyīya-mala, you see all beings asholding up a mirror to yourself. The initial awakening of your innate divinitydescribed as śaktipāta above makes it far easier to break through the falseus-versus-other dichotomy engendered by māyīya-mala.If you are having a hard time seeing the other as yourself in another form, thatsimply means that you must expand your sense of self and take hold of therealization that the capacity to do both wonderful and terrible things existswithin you and the other person in exactly the same degree. Overcomingmāyīya-mala does not mean believing that all people are the same or that all areequally good. It means seeing the reality that all entities are different formsof the same thing, each subject to unique conditions. You can stay grounded inthe Real by grasping that though there is only one substance to reality, it canmanifest in an infinite variety of different forms. Of course, though all beingsare God, some are highly contracted forms of God, expressing the divine Power ofself-concealment by perpetuating ignorance and suffering. Seeing all beings asequally Divine does not mean equally approving the actions and viewpoints of allbeings. It is vital that this particular point be understood with crystalclarity.Ultimately, releasing the ignorance of māyīya-mala means seeing thatdifferentiation is not and never was a problem. For Tāntrikas, seeing differencein the context of a greater unity does not mean devaluing difference but rathercelebrating it as the very source of beauty itself. The power of Māyā is finallyexperienced as the power by which divine Consciousness loves itself in theparticular manifest form of you.the impurity of actionThe Impurity of Action or kārma-mala refers to the bondage of karma. As long asthe first two malas are active, you will see yourself as a limited, separatebeing who must strive to give yourself every advantage at any cost. Thisviewpoint naturally gives rise to volitional actions with repercussions thatwill further enmesh the actor in bondage. The cycle of action that is motivatedby ignorance and corresponding reactions is called karma. Only those actionsperformed out of ignorance and grasping create karmic repercussions.The primary forms of that ignorance are attachment and aversion. Attachment isthe conviction that we need something outside ourselves (success, a partner, theright job, approval, etc.) to be fulfilled. Aversion is the same vibration, onlyinverted: the conviction that we cannot be fulfilled until certain things areeliminated or avoided. When we are driven by attachment and aversion, wenaturally commit divisive actions that can cause suffering for ourselves andothers. The more overcome we are by a particular attachment or aversion, themore extreme our actions become (as in the case of someone who believes “I can’tlive without him!”). The more extreme the beliefs motivating our actions, thegreater the karmic repercussions. Only actions that arise spontaneously as anexpression of our essence-nature, without personal motive of gain or loss, haveno binding karmic repercussion.Karma can seem a very heavy doctrine: since we have committed so many karmicactions in the past and continue to do so in the present, how can we possiblyovercome the burden of their consequences? The masters of Śaiva Tantra saw thatworry about the enormous burden of past-life karmas was a real barrier inpeople’s spiritual practice. So, they devised an initiation ceremony (calleddīkṣā) that was said to purify people of all their past-life karma destined tobear fruit in future lives, leaving only the karma of this life intact. Whateverthe reality of this metaphysical claim might be, the psychological effect ofthis ceremony is undeniable: it makes people feel that liberation within thisvery life is within reach—and, because Consciousness creates reality, it becameso. The simple fact is that if you had to heal and process every karmic tracewithin your being in order to reach the goal, liberation would be impossiblydistant. Therefore, there is only one viable solution in the Tantrik View: stopbeing the person to whom those karmas apply. Once you fully relinquish theidentity of the one who generated the karmas and to whom they tenaciously stick,you are free. Such a solution is not a shortcut on the path, because from thespiritual point of view, you only need to go through as many karmas as youpersonally need to go through in order to reach the point of fully dedicatingyourself to the process of dissolving your limited self back into God. That isto say, this is not a system in which you need to be punished for every “bad”thing you’ve ever done; for if you truly stop being the person who performedthose sorts of actions, the karmas no longer apply to you.The best way to overcome kārma-mala is to address the root from which it arises:become thoroughly convinced that there is nothing outside yourself that need beadded to make you complete nor is there anything that need be subtracted to makeyou pure. This state of profound love and respect for your own being will, ifachieved even in part, make it easier for you to perform actions without anyselfish grasping motive and thus you will be free of karma. It should be notedhere that an action can make you feel good and still be without selfish motive;the question is whether it spontaneously wells up from your Heart as a naturalexpression of your authentic nature. (So, an action can be Self-ish and notselfish, if you get my meaning.) It is the root, not the fruit, of an actionthat makes it selfish or not. Needless to say, if you are able to undermine anddestabilize māyīya-mala, the belief in yourself as separate from other beingsand objects, then kārma-mala will naturally start to fall away as well. Only ifyou see others as separate from you could you consider your own needs withoutconsidering theirs. So, the long and short of the Tantrik view on this is this:Don’t worry about karma. Focus on the more fundamental malas, and karma willtake care of itself.Finally, everything comes back to āṇava-mala. Only if you are experiencingyourself as cut off from the Divine—unworthy, incomplete, and imperfect—can theother two malas operate. If a being manages, through much effort, to removemāyīya- and kārma-mala without removing āṇava-, then he is called a Vijñānākala,one who is nearly liberated but remains stuck on the threshold of trueliberation, unable to surrender his limited identity. Vijñānākala literallymeans “one who is free of the limitation of two malas by means of his owninsight” but who, denying the grace of an even greater divine power than hisindividual soul, remains bound by the final Impurity. Such a one transcends Māyābut remains, as it were, forever at the gates of heaven, barred from the entrypermitted for those who cast aside identification with their limited self, whorealize that only one Being has ever existed, and who know their embodied formwas merely a temporary part He played, a dance She danced."},{"pageContent":"vāk: the four levels of the word(& the six-fold path)The form in which the highest divinity is worshipped in one school of NŚT (theTrika) is the Goddess called Parāvāk, “the Supreme Word,” or simply Parā. Parāis the Tantrik equivalent of the mainstream deity Sarasvatī, except that She isrevered in the Trika as the highest principle of reality: She is also calledAnuttarā, “the feminine Absolute.” In the Trika, the totality of existence isunderstood as an expression of the Supreme Word, and thus all beings are “theWord made flesh,” as it were. This concept is parallel to Greek thought (and thebeginning of the Gospel of John) where “the Word” is the English translation oflogos, denoting the deep structure of reality, the harmonic animating principleof the universe. In this view, everything is a harmonic vibration of the oneWord.Parāvāk, then, is both the power of inspiration and the organizing intelligenceof embodied consciousness: the subtle patterning in Awareness that shapes boththe world of things and the corresponding world of ideation and representation.The Word manifests in two different ways, and these mirror each other:signifiers and that which they signify. That is, the Word becomes both thesymbolic units of language and the objects of experience to which they refer.These are the internalized and externalized dimensions of one Consciousness, theGoddess Parā (who is understood to be Mahādevī, i.e., the feminine aspect ofŚiva). When we do not see the common root of both external objects of experienceand the internal ideas that reflect them, we fail to realize theirinterdependence. For example, we erroneously believe that “external” realityshapes our inner world but not the other way around; whereas in fact, bothaspects are constantly shaping and reshaping each other in a two-way dialecticalprocess.The two sides of this process are described in Śaiva Tantra as each having threeaspects, thus giving us the so-called Sixfold Path of Reality (ṣaḍ-adhvan),presented below. (Note that the “outer Path” on the right is the prakāśa aspect,and the “inner Path” on the left is the vimarśa aspect in the Pratyabhijñāanalysis; see the relevant section[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-10_split_000.xhtml#reflection].)[image/tunningfork.jpg]Signifier (vācaka),the inner PathSignified (vācya),the outer Path1. varṇa (phonemes, subtle pulsations)4. kalā (5 major divisions of reality)2. mantra (morphemes, thought-units)5. tattva (36 principles of reality)3. pada (words and phrases)6. bhuvana (118 planes of reality)This listing moves from the subtler at the top to the more tangible and concreteat the bottom (sūkṣma -> sthūla). This process is simply the densification ofthe singular energy of Consciousness. We should also note that the division into“internal” and “external” makes sense only from the perspective of theindividuated conscious being. From the Absolute perspective, of course, nothingat all is external to Awareness.This Sixfold Path is a pan-Śaiva doctrine, not just found in the Trika. However,it is the Trika that explores and builds a theology around the inner Path of theSignifier. It is this theology that I mean when I refer to the “linguisticmysticism” of the Trika.Now, you may have already noticed an apparent problem with this picture ofthings, which is this: if the so-called inner Path of ideas and language and theouter Path of things and worlds have a common origin and mirror one another, whydo they not correspond perfectly? Why do we as individuals often hold ideas thatare not in alignment with the nature of our external reality? The answer lies inthe fact that Consciousness, the ground of reality, is by its very natureabsolutely free and autonomous—so free, in fact, that it is free to constructany picture it likes of reality, to build up any discourse about reality that itlikes, even one that is very much at odds with the deep structures and patternsof nature. In other words, Consciousness in its contracted form is subject tolimited knowledge, and when, because of its contracted awareness, it takes itslimited knowledge of reality as being complete, it builds up a picture ofreality on that basis that is in fact skewed and distorted, however many truthsthat picture may contain. And of course, this skewed picture of things doescorrespond to a reality: the reality of the limitation in our perception. So,all thought-forms do correspond to some aspect of reality—just not usually inthe way that we think they do.From this point of view, the whole process of sādhanā is nothing but the processof carefully and slowly aligning our internal mental constructs of reality(vikalpas) with the actual patterns of reality itself, and of discarding thosethat cannot be so aligned. (Note that in the fully expanded mode of awareness,this process happens effortlessly of its own accord.) Putting it another way,sādhanā consists of learning how to cast aside our presumptions, to carefullyobserve what is happening around and within us, and then to surrender ourvarious skewed stories about reality to Reality itself. (This is nonduallanguage for what many religions call “submitting to the will of God.”) At somepoint, the effort involved in this process gives way to an epiphany, a deep andprofound insight into the deep structures of Consciousness, into “the mind ofGod,” if you will, as a result of which the process of alignment unfolds more orless spontaneously.The Trika articulates a doctrine of four levels of the Word in order to help usunderstand the inner Path, the process by which we each construct a particularexperience of reality. Understanding all of this is crucial for those who wishto open themselves to the real nature of things and surrender mind-createdsuffering. We will investigate the four levels here. We have already mentionedthe highest level, Parā; now we will start from the lowest level and come fullcircle. We start, as usual, from the “lowest” level because that is the mostconcrete and obvious, the most familiar to us. We always start from where weare.The chart below will make sense as you read through the discussion.NameTranslationPredominant aspect of consciousnessPredominant ŚaktiSphere of perception4. VaikharīCorporealobjectActionduality3. MadhyamāIntermediateprocessKnowledgesynthesis2. PaśyantīVisionarysubjectWillnonduality1. ParāSupremetranscendental subjectFreedomsupreme nondualityvaikharī vāk:the corporeal level of the wordIf we start from the most concrete, the first of the four levels is Vaikharī,the level of ordinary everyday articulate speech. Vaikharī functions on thelevel of duality, and in it, object-awareness is predominant. Human language isinherently dualistic, for each word achieves a particular meaning only bynegating all other possible meanings. Further, spoken language is oriented tothe objects of consciousness, and it operates analytically—that is to say, ithelps our minds divide reality into discrete chunks and then sort and categorizethem. This creates a problem, for if we believe that language reflects realityaccurately, we will necessarily see reality dualistically. That is, we willperceive a world carved up into different chunks of differing values, a world ofseparate entities acting on (and often against) one another, instead of acontinuum of unity in dynamically balanced interrelationship.Indian philosophy has long articulated a powerful critique of the (usually)unconscious process by which we take a linguistic concept, which is really justa convenient shorthand designation for a complex process or set of factors, andbelieve that that term denotes a given static reality. That is to say, wemistake a linguistic symbol for a fact.47[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en47] This may not seem a bigdeal—mere philosophizing, you might say—but the consequences of this cognitiveact of “reifying” a linguistic symbol are serious. In the realm of religion, wecall it fundamentalism (which basically means believing that your religious textis literally true rather than symbolically true), and as we know, this has beenresponsible for some of the most vitriolic hatred and horrific bloodshed of thelast hundred years. So, this is not “mere philosophy.” There are seriousreal-world consequences to these subtle processes by which we build up ourpicture of reality. Therefore we must try to understand them.To help us penetrate to a deeper level of reality than dualistic perception, theTrika doctrine shows us that the world of articulated human language is actuallythe most superficial and gross level of the Word, and investigating its deeper,subtler layers helps us see reality more accurately. The top-level “corporeal”discourse in which we engage every day is, in this philosophy, like the surfaceof the ocean—it gives little indication of what’s happening underwater. Yourordinary speech is constantly informed by deeper levels of discourse and canpoint you toward those deeper realities. In other words, ordinary speech(Vaikharī) is shaped by how you think (Madhyamā); how you think is shaped byyour deep unconscious convictions about reality (Paśyantī); and those in turnare partial articulations of the singular divine Awareness (Parā) that freelychooses to express itself in a rhythm of contracted and expanded forms. In lightof this, the way you speak expresses something of the underlying pattern of yourconsciousness. If change is desirable, then, on the Tantrik path we do not seekthat transformation in terms of superficial programmatic adjustments of ourwords to conform more successfully to social sanction (even the sanction of avery spiritual community). Rather, we seek shifts on the deepest levels of ourawareness that then express themselves naturally through the spontaneous play ofour thoughts and words. So, words do matter, not in terms of themselves but interms of what they signify, what they point to or reveal about the way we areencountering and understanding our world. Additionally, words are importantbecause they are forms of action, by which we affect (or inflict) change on theworld around us. Our words are patterns of energy that powerfully shape otherpeople’s experience of reality and our own, and therefore must be used withcare.madhyamā vāk:the intermediate level of the wordThe second level of the Word is Madhyamā, the level of thought or “internaldiscourse.” On this level, the process of knowing is more predominant than thethings known (see the chart above). Language on this level is not like thatwhich we speak; it is what some call “mentalese”—the language with which themind thinks to itself: a mixture of words, images, fragmented phrases, andhalf-formed ideas. The Madhyamā level is the substrate for the formation ofpersistent dualistic thought-structures called vikalpas; in other words, this isthe arena in which the mind formulates its thought-constructs—the forms ofverbal symbolization that it then superimposes on reality. Vikalpas areessentially the distorted and oversimplified stories that we tell ourselvesabout reality and that we then reify or take as fact. The ability to distinguishthat a vikalpa is a representation of reality—and possibly a faulty one—ratherthan reality itself is a crucial skill for the Tantrik yogī; some say thecrucial skill.Yet this level of discourse is closer to the essential nature of Awareness thanthe previous one, for by its very nature, it operates not within the realm ofduality (bheda) but within the sphere of synthesis or unity-in-diversity(bhedābheda). All the various concepts, contradictory though they may be, areunified by the field of individual consciousness.The inner discourse of the Madhyamā level operates through the three aspects ofthe mental instrument (see the relevant section[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-11_split_000.xhtml#mind16]). In theintellect (buddhi), it takes the form of deliberation, contemplation, orjudgment; in the manas, it manifests as imagination and dreams; in the ego, asself-referentiality. Some of these, like contemplation and imagination, areexpansive forms of inner discourse that can be tools in moving closer to ournatural state of freedom and presence. For this reason, there are Tantrikpractices that are performed on the Madhyamā level, purifying and aligning it,such as the practices of visualization (dhyāna), deity-yoga, meditation, andcreative contemplation (bhāvanā). These are like āsanas (yogic postures) for themind.The proverb that typifies Tantrik practice is “We rise by the support of thesame ground that trips us.” It is important to note that our thought-constructs,our vikalpas, limit the range of possibilities for how we experience any givenreality, yet cultivating purified thought-constructs—those aligned with theorganic patterning of awakened consciousness—can by the same token expand ourrange of possibilities. (This will be explored further.)paśyantī vāk:the visionary level of the wordThe cultivation of purified thought-constructs is very difficult to accomplishif we are not also working down into the third level, the Paśyantī or“visionary” level. This is a level beyond ordinary discourse, where thevibrations of thought and feeling seem entirely wordless. It is the level ofprecognitive Will (icchā śakti), the initial impulse of Consciousness towardexpression. On this level of the Word there is no differentiation of space andtime, and sound and light as well are synesthetically fused. The Word is verymuch active here, though in a compacted and concealed form. This is the plane ofso-called nirvikalpa awareness: in this context that term does not mean “withoutthought,” but rather that the vikalpas (differential thought-constructs) havebecome converted into pure energy in very subtle forms. Because these are sodeeply internalized, they have more power to influence us—for good or ill.On this level, subjective awareness is dominant; that is, the subject-objectsplit is scarcely operative for the various objects of experience have collapsedinto the subject. We perceive the impressions of the various experiences as partof ourselves (again, with good or ill results, depending on the impressions).So, this is the level of our precognitive (that means prior to cognition,limiting the range of possible cognitions and shaping their character), deeplyheld beliefs about reality, woven into our sense of self, and all the strongerfor being wordless. This level is called “visionary” because the pattern heldhere powerfully shapes our vision of reality, structuring our thoughts on theMadhyamā level and our words on the Vaikharī level. The subliminal impressionsof past experiences (saṃskāras) held here constantly provide the template forour mental and physical engagement with reality. Hence, if our yoga does notreach to this level, lasting change is impossible. This is the level of deephealing, where our goal is to create a pattern in the deepest level ofindividual awareness that perfectly aligns with the cosmic divine pattern.The model of the four levels of the Word helps us understand why it can be sohard to tell the difference between a “hunch” that expresses deep intuitiveinsight and one that expresses deep subconscious programming. We feel bothviscerally, but while the former is completely reliable, the latter is onlysporadically so. The difficulty in telling them apart is that both bear the markof the Paśyantī level: the former rises from the fundamental level of the Word(see below) and passes through the Paśyantī level to reach the mind, while thelatter rises from saṃskāras (subconscious impressions), which have beenimprinted on the Paśyantī level.[image/intuitive_insight.jpg]We must therefore be skeptical of our hunches and investigate their real nature.One way to tell the difference between the arising of true intuitive insight(from the Parā level) and the arising of deep conditioning (from the Paśyantīlevel) is this: when we question the hunch, if it comes from saṃskāras, the mindwill defend and justify it, arguing for its validity and pointing to the“evidence” that seems to corroborate it. By contrast, when we question a realintuition, it remains silent. The insight does not justify or explain itself,but offers itself as a gift. It takes practice to listen to the voice that isquieter than the mind.The more our yoga progresses, the more our intuition becomes accurately alignedwith the deeper pattern (the Parā level). To facilitate the deep healing andclearing that makes this possible, we must allow our spiritual work to penetrateto the Paśyantī level, where our subliminal impressions are lodged.There are three methods to penetrate to this level. The first is to repeatedlycultivate purified thought-constructs on the Madhyamā level of consciousthought, until that patterning of awareness becomes strong enough to spill overand shape the unconscious pattern on the Paśyantī level. This method isbeautifully explained by Abhinava Gupta in chapter 4 of his work Essence of theTantras (more on this later).The second method is a type of mindfulness meditation, which is oriented to thePaśyantī or visionary level. By accessing the all-accepting WitnessConsciousness that also dwells on this level, we create a healing space ofawareness in which old saṃskāras are automatically released. To be clear, inthis type of meditation, instead of focusing on a mantra or the breath for thewhole time, you spend some time sitting in a space of complete openness, neitherseeking nor pushing away thoughts but simply watching nonjudgmentally whateverarises. This is the most effective method of meditation for healing saṃskāras.The third method is mantra repetition. This practice begins on the Vaikharīlevel (simply speaking or singing a mantra), where not much benefit isexperienced, relatively speaking. If sufficiently practiced, however, the mantrabecomes subtler and subtler until it purifies all three levels of speech. Towork with this method, recite your primary mantra with faith and loving,full-hearted awareness, both in meditation and throughout the day, and in timeit will naturally transition from an articulate form to a rhythmic pulsation inwhich the words are no longer distinct but their vibration is still present.When this pulsation starts to arise spontaneously (that is, with no consciousvolition) and blissfully, the mantra has successfully penetrated to the Paśyantīlevel. When the Paśyantī level is purified, whether by the method of purifyingthought-constructs, mindfulness meditation, or subtle mantra repetition, thenthe unobstructed light of divine Will Power directs you to awakening—to therealization of your ultimate nature.parā vāk: the supreme level of the wordThat ultimate nature is the Supreme Word. It is totally beyond the distinctionof the three planes described above and yet constitutes the deepest identity ofeach of them, the vibration from which they all arise. It is the realm of highernonduality. That means it is a reality that coincides with no single plane, yetis that from which the various planes derive the capacity of performing theirrespective functions. Unlike the other three planes, it cannot be measured interms of greater or lesser degrees of contraction for it embodies the verydivine Freedom that presides over the appearance of contraction in its variousforms and degrees. It is called the Supreme Word because, though beyond allverbalization, it constitutes the power of verbalization and symbolization. Thatis, it is the very essence of self-reflective awareness (vimarśa), the power bywhich Consciousness represents itself to itself in various forms, that it mayknow itself fully.48 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en48]The fundamental vibratory essence from which all language, thought, feeling, andperception arise, Parā is a divine mystery, for despite being the highestprinciple of reality, we all experience Her every day in the form of our ownself-awareness. She is not some mystical state stowed away in a void, but ratherthe singular all-encompassing vibration by which all things move and sing.Abhinava Gupta describes Parā Vāk in this way:She is the primordial, uncreated Word, the very essence of the highest reality,pervading all things and eternally in creative motion: She is simply luminouspure Consciousness, vibrating with the greatest subtlety (as the ground of allBeing). (An Exposition of the Thirty Verses of Parā)He goes on to say that everything—stones, trees, birds, human beings, gods, anddemons—is a harmonic vibration of that one supreme Word. Her dominant powers aresvātantrya-śakti, the Power of absolute Freedom, and vimarśa-śakti, the Power ofSelf-awareness. She is most fully expressed in human experience in the state ofchamatkāra, the state of fully self-aware expansive wonder, where Consciousnessis suffused with the sudden rapture of great beauty, vibrating with awestruckjoy. This state, beyond words, transcendent yet completely engaged with thereality present in awareness, reveals to us how the Goddess Parā can besimultaneously the transcendent source of all things yet completely immanent inall things. She suggests to us, then, that ultimately we can experienceexquisite beauty in each aspect of human existence: in stillness and change, indeath and birth, in growth and decay, in pain and joy.the five states of awarenessAs you might imagine in a spiritual culture so preoccupied with the nature ofconsciousness, attention is given to the various states of awareness that eachof us moves through every day: waking, dreaming, deep sleep, and so on. Ofcourse, as usual, the Tantra has an argument to make about how many states ofawareness there actually are. Many people not familiar with spiritual practicewould say there are three. Meditators who have experienced samādhi (deepmeditation) think there are four. Nondual Śaiva Tantra argues that there arefive.As the great American philosopher William James wrote at the turn of the 20thcentury,Our normal waking consciousness is but one special type of consciousness, whileall about it parted from it by the filmiest of screens there lie potential formsof consciousness entirely different. We may go through life without suspectingtheir existence, but apply the requisite stimulus and at a touch they are therein all their completeness. No account of the universe in its totality can befinal which leaves these other forms of consciousness quite disregarded.The five basic states or phases of awareness are presented in tabular formbelow, followed by a discussion of each and how they interpenetrate each other.StateBodyAssociatedBreathPredominant aspect of ConsciousnessPredominant sphere of perceptionWakingPhysicalOut-breathObjectDualityDreamingSubtleIn-breathObject-impressionsUnity-in-diversityDeep SleepCausalSamānaSubjectNonduality(unaware)The FourthSupracausalUdānaSubjectNonduality(aware)Beyond the FourthAll/noneVyānaTransindividual subjectivitySupremenondualityjāgrat: the waking stateThe ordinary waking state is one in which we tend to perceive ourselvesprimarily in terms of the physical body. In this state we are focused on (evenlost in) the objects of perception, perceiving them in terms of their mutualdifferentiation and our resultant preferences. Though we call this “the wakingstate” to differentiate it from sleep and dreams, from the spiritual perspectiveit is the most unawake of all the states. As scholar Mark Dyczkowski haswritten, “[In this state, a person is] completely unconscious of his ownsubjective nature, [and] he never asks himself who he is. Whenever he sees anobject, he immediately identifies with it and totally forgets himself as theperceiver.”49 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en49] This iswhy Abhinava Gupta calls this state “the unawakened.” Most people move throughtheir waking life as if in a dream. Thus the Bhagavad-gītā says (I paraphrase),“What is day to most people is night to the person of wisdom, and vice versa.”Within the waking state, we also experience the other states, for the first fourstates all interpenetrate each other. Dreaming-in-waking is the state we calldaydream, reverie, or fantasy, in which we are lost in our mental impressionsand almost unaware of our physical surroundings. Deep sleep-in-waking is amoment of completely blanking out, a spontaneously thought-free state in whichone stares off into space. It is rare in adults but often observed in childrenor teens. It is a state of unity-consciousness, but we are not aware of it assuch. (If we are aware, then it is really the following.) The Fourth-in-wakingis a moment of spontaneous meditation, a thought-free state in whichself-awareness is primary, even while perceiving the “external” world. This iscalled “true wakefulness” by Abhinava Gupta.svapna: the dream stateIn the dream state, we occupy our subtle body (sometimes called the “energybody,” it is composed of the prāṇa, subtle elements, and mental faculties),50[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en50] and we roam in the worldof the impressions of our various experiences, exercising our capacity forimaginative mental representation. In this state there is unity-in-diversity(bhedābheda), for all the various elements of the dream state are unified bybeing aspects of a single mind. The dream world is not a creation of randomfirings in the brain but can tell us about our subconscious world. Therefore,there is the possibility of doing “dream yoga,” a topic addressed by AbhinavaGupta in chapter 10 of his Light on the Tantra. As he says there, “Wise onesexperience dream as a form of inner knowing, which operates on known entities inwhatever way it wants, independently of their external existence.” In otherwords, through dream yoga we can make inner shifts, rewrite our past, and havenew insights.Waking-in-dream, commonly called lucid dreaming, is an important part of dreamyoga; for to make conscious choices in the dream world, you must learn how towake up in it and realize you are dreaming. Otherwise lucidity in the dreamstate will come and go at random. Some people never experience this; but if youhave, you can cultivate it. Dreaming-in-dream is the ordinary kind of dreaming,in which awareness is scattered and self-reflection is difficult. Deepsleep-in-dream is said to be a state in which one has greater self-awareness inthe dream (because deep sleep is associated with subjectivity; see the chartabove [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-11_split_001.xhtml#seethechart]).Finally, the most important is the state of the Fourth-in-dream, that is to say,fully focused awareness while dreaming. It is said that if you can learn topractice meditation in the dream state, it bears fruit more rapidly than in thewaking state.sushupti: the deep sleep stateIn deep sleep we are immersed in pure subjectivity but without self-awareness.Entering this state every night is necessary for mental and physical health. Inthis state, we are temporarily free of our waking thoughts and our subconsciousimpressions, both of which can be taxing on our systems. From the yogic point ofview, it is precisely because the deep sleep state is so close to puresubjectivity, the innermost Self, that it is refreshing and rejuvenating. Thehuman being cannot survive long without deep sleep or meditation.Waking-in-deep sleep is a state where some trace of awareness emerges, by virtueof which, when we wake up, we are able to say, “I slept well,” or, “I slept along time.” Dreaming-in-deep sleep is an expansive state in which one isunconscious but still receiving impressions: for example, some people in comasare in this state, and though unconscious, when they come out of the coma, theyhave some sense of who was with them during that time. By contrast, in thepeaceful state of deep sleep-in-deep sleep, one is aware of nothing whatsoever,and upon waking, has no notion of how much time has passed, but wakes feelingdeeply refreshed. Finally, the Fourth-in-deep sleep is an extremely rare stateof becoming conscious of the absolute void of pure subjectivity during one’ssleep period, and meditating there spontaneously.turya: the fourth,or transcendental stateThe transcendental state of meditation, commonly known as samādhi, consists ofaccessing the state of total subjectivity, the void of pure consciousness—withthe usual objects of awareness (including thoughts) absent, the senses quieted,and even the subliminal impressions temporarily quelled. Simply, it is a statein which one accesses the level of deep sleep while completely awake and aware.Put another way, it is nondual awareness of pure subjectivity or “I-ness,” onthe level of the individual Self (puruṣa, ātman), not the all-encompassinguniversal Self.Samādhi literally means “absorption,” because in classical yoga the most commonmethod of achieving this state was to quiet the mind by focusing itone-pointedly on any object (a candle flame, the breath, etc.,) until the mindmerged with the object of meditation and thus dissolved. In this state, theobject alone shines forth, suffused with consciousness, yet free of anyassociations, interpretations, or cognitions. One skilled in this techniqueeventually learns to attain it even without an object of meditation (nirbījasamādhi).For many Indian (and Asian) spiritual traditions, this is the highest state.They regard it as the only state untainted by the messy and limitedmanifestations of nature. Such schools of thought are “transcendentalist” inthat they seek transcendence as their goal. But in the tradition of Śaiva Tantracalled “Supreme Nondualism” (paramādvaya), which is the focus of this book, itis taught that we can exist in the stainless clear Light of Consciousness evenin the midst of worldly activity. This is the condition known as turyātīta,“beyond the Fourth.”turyātīta: beyond the fourthAs you might expect if you are starting to understand the pattern of reality inthis philosophy, this state is not called “the Fifth” because it does not top ahierarchy; it is not comprehensible in hierarchical terms. Referred to as thatstate “beyond the Fourth,” Turyātīta is best described as the completepermeation of the first three states by the Fourth. It expresses the fundamentalmovement of the self-liberating autonomous consciousness: transcendence followedby pervasion of the mundane by the transcendent. Thus it is final liberation andfull awakening, as the Tāntrikas conceive it, under another name. This is whatis referred to by Śiva-sūtra 1.7–11.In other words, the nondual Tāntrikas assert that it is possible to experiencethe supreme Light of the Divine in the midst of any and all worldly activities,and even in the midst of any and all moods or states of mind. To be moreaccurate, in this state we do not experience the Light in spite of our mood orcondition or activity but as the very substance of those. The successfulestablishment of this state is Turyātīta, the liberation beyond that of thetranscendentalists. As it is taught in the Stanzas on the Recognition of theLord:One whose self is the universe, knowing fully that “All this is my ownexpansion,” experiences the divine state even in the flow of differentialcognitions. (Stanzas on the Recognition of the Lord)Once again, then, the ultimate Reality is simultaneously transcendent andimmanent, constituting the very substance of your moment-to-moment experienceyet inexpressibly more than that: the timeless ground upon which it all unfolds.the innate structure of realitythe trika-krama synthesis of abhinava guptaWe have explored many of the basic concepts and principles of nondual Tantrikthought. It is important to realize that much of the cohesiveness andorganization of classical Tantrik philosophy is due largely to the work of twogeniuses, two masterful scholar-sages of 10th-century Kashmīr: Utpala Deva andAbhinava Gupta. The first, Utpala, was an accomplished intellectual philosopher,one of the finest India ever produced; he was also a great-hearted passionatepoet and lover of God, so he serves as a perfect example of the totalintegration and expansion of all the levels of one’s being that the Tantrik pathpromises. The second, Abhinava, was also a great philosopher and theologian, andhe was an accomplished yogī as well, expert in the wide range of spiritualpractices found in the Tantrik scriptures. You will learn more about both ofthese siddha gurus in the history section of the book.In this section we will briefly explore Abhinava’s theological vision and why itwas so important to the Tantrik tradition. First we must realize that by theyear 950 CE, hundreds of Tantrik scriptures had already been produced. Each wasfollowed by a different lineage: some scriptures were fairly obscure productionsof small marginal groups, others vast and detailed works commanding manyfollowers in multiple lineages. In this body of scripture there are sharedthemes, practices, and vocabulary, but not much doctrinal agreement, coherence,or systematic thinking can be found. Near the end of the 10th century, AbhinavaGupta wrote his magnum opus, Light on the Tantras (Tantrāloka), and in this andother associated works he created the theological structure that makes sense outof the vast and diverse scriptural corpus of the Tantrik tradition. Throughextensive quoting of nearly a hundred scriptural sources and careful explanationand creative exegesis of these same sources, he demonstrated that there is asingle, coherent View of reality that can be derived from them. To articulate itfrom Abhinava’s perspective, this is the View that Lord Śiva intended us torealize through His scriptural revelation. Thus we may compare the place ofAbhinava Gupta in the Tantrik tradition to that of Thomas Aquinas in theChristian tradition, whose Summa Theologica forms an interesting parallel to theTantrāloka, not in content of course but in form, function, and influence.51[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en51]Not only did Abhinava organize and make sense out of a vast and diverse body ofmaterials, he also innovated by creating a philosophical structure for theteachings that was designed to lead the practitioner, inevitably, to the highestand most complete realization. Though his writing is extremely sophisticated anddetailed, we can summarize his unique contribution through the organizingprinciple of the “3 + 1” model. Almost everything of importance to Abhinava canbe understood in light of this model. And this is not surprising, for the modelis provided by the very name of the school of Tantra with which Abhinava is mostassociated: the Trika or “Trinity,” whose central teaching is that the triad ofthe individual soul, Śakti, and Śiva are, in reality, three expressions of anundifferentiated unity, the timeless ground of all reality, known as the Heartof Being.This is what Abhinava means when he states that the Trika is the one revelationwithin which the entire tradition is grounded; indeed, it is the ground of allreligion. He quotes a beautiful scriptural passage that states,[This truth] resides within [all] the scriptures like the scent in a flower, theoil in a sesame seed, the soul in the body, or nectar in water. (Tantrāloka35.30–34)The analogies given point to the notion that the innate truth of the 3 + 1teaching constitutes the very essence of the scriptures. Like the scent of aflower or the consciousness that animates the body, this essence is ever-presentand obvious, even though it is not graspable as an object.Let us investigate the forms in which the supreme truth of the 3 + 1 pattern ofreality manifests in the Tantrik teaching of Abhinava Gupta.In every experience, there are three factors: the thing known or perceived, themeans by which it is known, and the knower. These three are expressed in everysentence that articulates conscious experience, even the most basic, such as “Isee a pot.” But the three factors of experience are, upon deeper investigation,realized as three aspects of a single dynamic process by which Consciousnessreflects on itself in the form of the apparently different and distinct objectsof awareness. They are three flowering buds of a single root, as it were, and itis language that fools us into thinking that there are really three separatethings. This is why spiritual practice must go beyond the realm of language andthe mind, since that realm conditions us to experience dualistically.Similarly, the three primary powers of Consciousness-in-form, those of Willing(icchā), Knowing (jñāna), and Acting (kriyā), are to be understood as theexpressions of the fundamental ground in which they inhere, which is—toapproximate it in words—formless, autonomous Consciousness, blissful throughreposing in itself (cidānanda). This ultimate ground is your ever-present truenature, the Deity-Self revealed by the scriptures, whose primary purpose is topoint you to its realization. Abhinava’s powerful articulation of this ultimatetruth was stunningly captured by Professor Sanderson (the foremost expert inAbhinava’s work), when he wrote that the Deity-Self is defined as,The absolute autonomy of a nonindividual consciousness which alone exists,containing the whole of reality within the bliss of a dynamic “I”-nature,projecting space, time, and the interrelating fluxes of subjective and objectivephenomena as its content and form, manifesting itself in this spontaneousextroversion through precognitive impulse (icchā), cognition (jñāna), and action(kriyā) as the three radical modes of an infinite power.52[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en52]We again see the same pattern in the presentation of the three Means toLiberation, the upāyas, which form the subject of the last part of this book.These three different means—focused on body, heart-mind, and spiritrespectively—bring one to the realization of precisely the same ultimate realitybecause they derive from and are rooted in that very reality, the namelessFourth, which simultaneously transcends them and yet is present in them,constituting their essence. By the way, in case you haven’t realized it, inevery example of the 3 + 1 pattern the +1 is the same: it is the One that givesrise to all the triads.In the same way, Abhinava notes that Śaiva Tantra consists of three (+1) basicorders or lineage groupings (santānas), founded by three ancient sages plus thedaughter of one of the three. Since describing these here would be confusing(until you have read the history section), they are described in this endnote.53[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en53]The 3 + 1 pattern is also seen in Abhinava’s interpretation of the Spandadoctrine. The Spanda is a lineage of teachings (described in part 2), which areso profound and powerful they merit a whole other book. (In fact two such bookshave been written by Mark Dyczkowski, The Doctrine of Vibration and Stanzas onVibration, which while excellent are difficult for the nonscholar.) Suffice tosay here that the term spanda refers to the innate dynamism or vibrancy ofConsciousness. It is the dynamic core of the Light of Consciousness, whichcreates the pulsating appearance of movement in the ultimately motionless. Bymeditating on the spanda, one penetrates through the Śakti state to the nondualground (+1) in which the triad of Nara (individuated consciousness), Śakti, andŚiva coincide in undifferentiated unity.54[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en54] Abhinava alludes tothree phases of spanda experience in chapter 5 of his Light on the Tantras. Inthe first phase, individuality is predominant and the vibration of consciousnessis focused on the objects of its experience. In the second, the śakti level ofunity-consciousness, one has the awareness, “Whatever exists is nothing butmyself.” In the third, there is only the One, the universal “I.” All three ofthese modes, though, are expressions of the nondual ground, the nameless Fourth.Finally, and most importantly for the development of the theology of thetradition, we see the same 3 + 1 pattern in Abhinava’s doctrine of the ultimatenature of reality. Some see reality as inherently dualistic, in other words thatdistinction is ultimately real (the bheda view). They do good works and worshipa separate almighty God that they hope will bless them with his grace. Otherssee distinctions that are subsumed within a greater unity, with distinction andunity having equal weight in experience (the bhedābheda view). They cultivatespiritual knowledge and relish beautiful things as a vibration of consciousness.Still others see completely nondualistically, that is, seeing difference asunreal or only very superficially real, with unity absolutely dominant inexperience (the abheda or advaita view). They reject all practice, subtle andgross, and dwell in the immediate intuitive insight of the transcendent“I”-nature. So, where does the +1 come in? This is the key to understanding theultimate consummation of Tantrik philosophy. You see, the nondual view justmentioned excludes the dualistic view, seeing it as simply wrong. It is not anall-inclusive nonduality, and it lends itself to transcendentalism, a majorpitfall on the spiritual path. Therefore Abhinava Gupta presented a View hecalled paramādvaya, “the supreme nonduality,” which was alluded to above in thecategories section. This View includes both duality and nonduality as validexperiences and levels of perception. Nonduality transcends duality, but the“supreme nonduality” transcends the transcendent. How to understand this seemingparadox? The supremely nondual nameless Fourth is simultaneously transcendentand immanent: it englobes, includes, emanates as all these different views. Itis the all-inclusive Heart of reality, the dynamic power of Consciousness(cidānanda), which articulates every possibility, becomes everything, and yet isno-thing.From this perspective, then, Lord Śiva has compassionately revealed dualisticscriptures for the benefit of those who see reality that way; and even in thesetexts, He has concealed hints and clues that point toward nondual awareness sothat those in the dualist path may, when they are ready, “graduate” to a moreinclusive nondual awareness. And lest they then become stuck in nondualrejection of dualistic modes, there is the teaching about the “highernonduality” that includes all possible modes as the levels of emanation of theOne.Now, since all this might be seen by some as rarefied philosophizing, let usexamine the real-world implications of this 3 + 1 vision of reality. AbhinavaGupta discusses this in chapter 4 of Light on the Tantras, showing how thedoctrine of supreme nonduality resolves the disputes between the dualists andthe nondualists. He writes,In the dualistic Orthodoxy [the Siddhānta sect], worship of the liṅga [the stoneidol representing Śiva] is taught, with the intention of coming to see it asembodying the whole universe; but in the Kula and similar systems, liṅga-worshipis forbidden, so that one may come to see the universe in one’s own body. Buthere in the all-inclusive [way of supreme nonduality] what reason could there beeither for requiring the ritual or forbidding it?55[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en55] (Light on the Tantras)He goes on to discuss other practices: mimetic rites of impersonating the deity(with one’s dress, behavior, and so on) in order to acquire Her power, ritesrejected by nondualists who seek to realize Her as formless and all-embodying;pilgrimage to sacred sites, denigrated by nondualists who seek to realize thatthe Self is found everywhere and is all-encompassing; and the wearing ofsectarian marks and the following of lineage rules, forbidden by nondualists whoseek to see Reality as undivided.56[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en56] Then he says:In our way, none of this is enjoined or prohibited. No practice is specificallyenjoined, because it is not a guaranteed means of access to Śiva [for a givenindividual], and no practice [even a dualistic one] is specifically prohibited,because it can do nothing to divide or diminish that [divine] Reality. For theLord is all-encompassing, so injunction and prohibition are merely differentialconstructs within his nature. They cannot compromise that nature itself.(Tantrāloka 4.271–2)This is not a doctrine of “anything goes,” as it might appear to a Westerner. Itis rather arguing that no single practice can be universally enjoined orprohibited for all practitioners. Each person must have a committed practice,but each practice must be carefully tailored to that person’s constitution,psychology, and desired goal. Here Abhinava is following a rather extraordinarypassage found in his primary source scripture (The Final Triumph of the GoddessGarlanded by the Letters or Mālinīvijayottara-tantra). This passage is, in thecontext of any body of premodern religious literature, unusual for its radicalopenness of mind. It reads:Here [i.e., on this “level” of practice] there is no purity and no impurity, nodualism nor nondualism, no ritual nor its rejection, no renunciation and nopossession…all the observances, rules and regulations [found in other Tantras]are neither enjoined nor prohibited in this way. Or, everything is enjoined, andeverything forbidden here! In fact, there is but one commandment on this [higherpath], O Queen of the Gods: the yogī is to make every effort to steady hisawareness on reality. He must practice whatever makes that possible for him.57[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en57](Mālinīvijayottara-tantra Chapter 18)The truly radical nature of this passage is mostly lost on 21st-centuryindividuals who take its message for granted. In the context of a highlyrule-bound tradition, it is an astonishing example of liberated awareness. Buteven in the modern world, there are so many who could benefit from thisteaching. On the other hand, it is not a teaching given to beginners on thepath, because the basic foundational practices are largely the same foreveryone, and this teaching can be used by the deluded as a pretext for skippingthose practices.We have seen how the 3 + 1 pattern applies to the phenomenology of experience,to the primary powers of Consciousness, the methodology of practice, the primarylineages, Spanda practice, the nature of reality, and we’ve gotten a hint of howit plays out in real-world application. If we closely study Abhinava’s theology,we discover that he has a powerful motivation for articulating this pattern: itis, in essence, the fruit of synthesizing the two primary traditions that heinherited, the Trika and the Krama. Initiated into the radically nondual Kramaas a young man but attaining the final goal through the grace of a master of theTrika, he was obviously compelled to integrate the teachings of both in agreater harmony. He was not the first to do so, and there are even scripturesthat teach this uniquely powerful synthesis.We can conclude this section with a consideration of the theology of theTrika/Krama synthesis as an instantiation of the 3 + 1 pattern. There are threegoddesses of the Trika (as will be discussed later) that embody the threeaspects of experience, Knower, Knowing, and Known (they also embody the powersof Willing, Knowing, and Acting, which correspond to those three). These threeare seen, in the Trika/Krama synthesis, as emanations of the Supreme Goddess,sometimes known as Mātṛsadbhāva, which means both “the essence of all mothers”and “the essence of all knowers.” She is also identified by Abhinava as KālīSankarṣaṇī, and this is the name of the high Goddess of the Krama tradition. Sheis the Nameless, the timeless ground, the ultimate all-consuming Power ofAwareness into which dissolution itself dissolves. She is called the Fourth, forShe is the ground of the threefold process of Creation, Stasis, and Dissolutionthat applies to all things. She is the ultimate emptiness, the no-thing-nessthat is simultaneously complete fullness. Integrating Her into the theology ofthe Trika provides the +1 of the 3 + 1 pattern.Abhinava goes further. Central to the Krama is the worship of the phases ofAwareness in the form of the twelve Kālikās or emanations of Kālī. Abhinavaargues that these twelve goddesses arise through the confluence of the threeaspects of experience (= the three Trika goddesses) with the four phases of theKrama, i.e., Creation, Stasis, Dissolution, and the Nameless ground (3 x 4 =12). As he puts it, “These Powers spontaneously tremble in emission, persistenceand retraction, and so become the twelve.” The twelve Kālīs are thus the nodalpoints and troughs of the complex interference pattern set up by the confluenceof the energies of the Trika goddesses with the Krama’s Kālī Sankarṣaṇī in herfour aspects.58 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en58]To put it in simpler terms, we are multiplying the three aspects of experienceby the four sequential phases (krama means “phase”). For example, the first ofthe twelve Kālīs is Sṛṣṭikālī, and her essence expresses the creation (or ratheremission) of the object of experience. The second is Raktakālī, the persistenceof the object of experience. And so it goes, all the way to the twelfth Kālī,who is the Nameless ground into which the Knower dissolves. Thus the series oftwelve also constitutes a map for the involution of consciousness to its finalresting place, the mind’s faculties having been withdrawn into the individualsubject, the individual subject having been withdrawn into the transcendentalSubject, and that having been within into non-subjective indescribable pureAwareness (= the twelfth Kālī).The names for the twelve Kālīs preexisted Abhinava’s analysis; since for themost part they fit well the map he provides, it lends weight to his argumentthat he is not making this up, but rather illuminating the hidden pattern ofultimate reality that is the self-revelation of the Absolute in the form of thebody of scripture, which is thus seen as a kind of encoded energy, a cipher ofthe deep structure of reality. Thus Abhinava actually considers the twelve Kālīsto be the primary circuit of power (śakti-cakra) in the analysis of Awareness’innate power of self-expression. All other circuits of deities are to be seen ascondensations or amplifications of this primary circuit.59[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en59]The reader who finds this teaching difficult will probably wish for greaterexplanation or at least a chart of the twelve Kālīs. But this teaching isconsidered highly secret by the tradition, and is not to be given out casually.Following Abhinava’s cue in Essence of the Tantras chapter 4, I am here alludingto this key teaching without presenting it in full. Those who truly wish tolearn it will find a way to do so.Abhinava’s teaching on the Trika/Krama synthesis was so successful that itinfluenced much of the later tradition. His disciple Kṣemarāja produced the mostcondensed transmission of this combined Trika/Krama view in his seminal text intwenty sūtras and commentary, The Heart of the Doctrine of Recognition, which Ihave translated."},{"pageContent":"2The Historyof Śaiva TantraIn Part 1 we explored the spiritual philosophy of nondual Tantra, whichconstitutes just a part of the total Tantrik literature. In Part 2 I willpresent a condensed history and overview of the entire tradition of ŚaivaTantra, in all its various permutations. I say condensed, because to write thecomplete history of this tradition would run to many volumes. A start has beenmade in that direction by the world’s foremost scholar of Shaivism, ProfessorAlexis Sanderson of Oxford University, who has published over 1,400 pages ofrigorous academic monographs largely focused on the history of Śaiva Tantra,which will serve as a foundation for the next hundred years of research on thesubject. This section could not have been written without his work and that ofhis students.[image/timeline.jpg]early historyframing the tradition in time and spaceTantra originated as a distinctly Indian religious phenomenon, though in time itdiffused through many Asian cultures. Our first certain evidence of it datesfrom 1,500 years ago in North India. This was a turbulent time in Indianhistory, for the great Gupta empire had crumbled, leaving numerous petty warringkingdoms. The uncertainty of life was at an all-time peak: there was no suresecurity of home, livelihood, or even one’s life. At such times people cravemodes of empowerment, and it was to fill this need that the Tantra arose,offering new, more effective technologies for the transformation of mind, body,and environment. Though the Tantra did promise worldly advantages to some, whatit ultimately had to offer was the greatest empowerment of all: the power todetermine your own inner state, regardless of external circumstance.Scholars have been debating for some time now about the precise origins ofTantra as a spiritual movement, a religious aesthetic, and a new way ofperforming yogic and ritual practice. Some say its beginnings are irrevocablylost in the mists of time. Some believe it derived from tribal or shamanisticpractices far outside the brāhminical heartland of India. (Called Āryāvarta,this is the area of north-central India where mainstream Indian religionprevailed, a religion largely controlled by the priestly caste of the brāhmins.They included some brilliant thinkers but were usually paid ritual functionarieswhose outlook was deeply conservative.) It is difficult to be sure about thebeginnings of Tantra, because the only early evidence we have consists of acouple of manuscripts and inscriptions carved on temple walls. However, throughthe mammoth efforts of Professor Sanderson, we now can draw some firmconclusions about Tantra’s origins. He has recently shown (with several hundredpages of evidence and argument) that Tantra was a spiritual movement thatoriginally arose entirely within the religion of Shaivism and from there passedinto Buddhism and Vaishnavism, propagating throughout the Indian subcontinentand into East Asia, Southeast Asia, and Indonesia.60[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en60]the social context of shaivismBy definition, those members of the Śaiva religion who were not formallyinitiated were not practicing the Tantra. Remember that Tantra constitutes themystical, initiatory, and esoteric dimension of whatever religion it is foundin. Nevertheless, briefly examining the world of these uninitiateddevotees—known as Śiva-bhaktas or upāsakas*—gives us a much richer picture ofthe social context of Shaivism, as well as its social conscience. These devoteesalso constituted the primary base from which initiates would be drawn; for anyof these devotees who was favored with a Descent of Power (śaktipāta)—aspiritual awakening that could come to a person of any caste or gender—couldseek initiation into the Tantrik form of the religion.Uninitiated devotees focused primarily on the discipline of devotion(bhakti-yoga), as opposed to the ritual-, yogic-, and knowledge-based path ofthe initiate. Their practice is described in a text called the Śiva-dharma,which means “the religion of Śiva” or “the way of life aligned with Śiva’steachings.” The Śiva-dharma teaches:Unswerving devotion to God is the essence of the religion of Śiva. He has saidthat its eight aspects are to be practiced diligently and incessantly. The Lordsaid:1. Show affection towards My devotees, like that of a cow for her calf;2. Practice your worship with devotion;3. Rejoice in others’ worship;4. Offer selfless service to Me;5. Be devoted to listening to My tales;6. Cultivate a devotion so strong that you are affected in voice, eye, and limb;7. Remember Me; and8. Do not live off My revenues.One who practices this eight-fold devotion, even a foreigner, is [as good as] aforemost brāhmin, a venerable sage, an ascetic, and a scholar. (Śiva-dharma)These “eight commandments” give us a picture of the religious life of themajority of people at this time, and perhaps illustrate the type of practicethat might have been considered a prerequisite for Tantrik initiation, though weknow initiates could theoretically come from any background.61[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en61]Lay devotees would also participate in grand and beautiful devotional festivals,called utsavas or mahās. These, the Śiva-dharma tells us, involved an all-nightcelebration or “night vigil,” which featured singing of devotional songs, sacreddancing, telling stories of Śiva and Pārvatī, chanting, theatrical performances,and swings and games for the children. The next day, a sacred scripture ofShaivism would be paraded through the city on a three-tiered shrine atop anelephant, with scented water, flowers, and rice scattered wherever it went. Thecitizenry wore white and flew colored banners from their rooftops, also throwingflower petals and rice. The king forbade all violence for the duration of thefestival (even toward plants!), and granted amnesty to prisoners.62[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en62]This sort of celebration would take place only in a town with a consecratedtemple of Śiva. The temple complex was an important part of life not only fordevotees but all the citizenry, for it owned large tracts of land, employedlarge numbers of people, and was the center of civic and cultural life (otherthan that of the king’s court), commissioning architects, sculptors, painters,dancers, musicians, and scholars. One such Śaiva temple in South India, built atthe peak of the Tantrik period, boasted more than two thousand resident dancers(all women), with one thousand servants devoted their care. (This is theBṛhadīśvara temple in Thanjavur, completed in the 11th century; a lengthyinscription on its base tells about temple life one thousand years ago.) Thetemple complex always centered on a shrine of Śiva in the form of a liṅga (seethe image below), in which Śiva’s presence had been invoked and installed in theform of his living mantras. The deity was treated as a living presence, even alegal entity: it was Śiva who was the owner of the lands and employer of thetemple staff.[image/Lingam.jpg]Śiva-liṅgaThe temple complex increased its social significance through its variousancillary institutions, which often included welfare facilities such as anĀyurvedic medical clinic, a maternity ward, and a food dispensary. The templecomplex nearly always included a maṭha or āśrama, a monastery where full-timeinitiated practitioners would live with a guru or ācārya (which is sort of likesomeone with a Ph.D. in the Tantra, requiring many years of study and practice).The āśrama environment was ideal for those who wished to dedicate some years oftheir life to the full-time study and practice of the path. It was sometimesconnected to something like a full-fledged spiritual university, as at theonce-famous Śaiva Tantrik sites of Mattamayūra and Golagī. These were majorcenters of learning, literary production, debate, and practice, housing largenumbers of scholar-practitioners, comparable to the Buddhist university atNālandā. (These institutions were generally managed by authorities of theright-current Siddhānta, which was more institutionalized than the left-current.More about these distinctions later.) Unfortunately, like Nālandā, they weredestroyed in the Muslim invasions.The world of public worship and celebration centered on the temple contrastsstrongly with the initiate’s world of private worship and meditation, whichcentered on his home and that of his guru. The initiate’s practice was largelyinteriorized and needed few external elements, most commonly a small portableliṅga and an akṣa-sūtra or rosary. In terms of lifestyle, in their probationaryperiod the younger initiates (samayins) would actually live with the guru in hishome and receive frequent instruction. Full initiates would generally be marriedand have their own homes but would attend periodic gatherings with their guru.These gatherings or satsangs, for initiates only, would usually include a ritual(pūjā), teaching (upadeśa), and a communal feast. The kula gatherings of theKaulas of the far left would sometimes have a very sensual, even orgiasticquality. These gatherings were called melāpas, and in them ordinary cultural andpsychological boundaries would be temporarily dissolved in an attempt to throwoff mental constructs and trigger a raw, immediate, intense experience ofconsciousness, saturated with the blissful perception of beauty in all things.Though many Westerners imagine this is what Tantra was all about, these sorts ofgatherings were not common and were considered well outside the mainstream ofthe Tantrik religion.the origins of the tantraThe earliest texts and inscriptions that we may call Tantrik date from the 5thto the 7th centuries ce. They appeared roughly around the same time withinShaivism and Buddhism, the two religions that subsequently became the dominantTantrik traditions of the Middle Ages. Therefore, there has been muchcontroversy about which of these two religions originated the Tantra. Thiscontroversy can now be dispelled. Let’s briefly and simply review the evidence.Around 600 ce, we see the great Buddhist philosopher Dharmakīrti (who was not aTāntrika) criticizing an early form of Śaiva Tantra. Given Dharmakīrti’s status,he would not have bothered to articulate this critique had Śaiva Tantra notalready achieved considerable success. Nor does he mention any Tantrik practiceswithin Buddhism, which he would have been likely to criticize had he been awareof them.There is also much broader evidence of the priority of the Śaiva form of Tantra.The first Śaiva Tantrik text to present a complete and detailed system ofpractice (granting both spiritual liberation and worldly powers) is, by currentdating, a full century earlier than the first Buddhist Tantrik text to do so(early 6th and early 7th century respectively).63[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en63] Earlier texts that somemight wish to assign to the Buddhist Tantra are essentially minor manuals ofpractical magic that present neither a complete system of spiritual practice norany doctrinal View or cosmology. By contrast the earliest Śaiva Tantrik text(which we will discuss later) is large, complex, relatively sophisticated, anddemonstrates by its content the existence of a new and distinct esoteric Tantrikreligion, with its own unique doctrines, clearly related to and yet differentfrom the earlier non-tantrik Shaivism.Furthermore, the early Buddhist tantras defend themselves against accusations oftaking rituals and mantras from Shaivism. One text does so by proclaiming thatin fact it was the Buddhist bodhisattva named Mañjuśrī who taught “everythingthat the inhabitants of earth without exception refer to as the teaching ofŚiva.”64 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en64] There areseveral other Buddhist examples of this, including texts that teach explicitlyŚaiva mantras, but there are no counterexamples of Śaiva texts presentingBuddhist material (at least not until half a millennium later). Recentscholarship in this area has sealed the deal on the origin of Tantra withinShaivism, though this is not yet general knowledge.connections with pre-tantrik shaivismThe case that the Tantra as a movement began within Shaivism is strengthened bythe fact that it has many defining features in common with pre-Tantrik Shaivismthat are not shared with any other documented tradition. This earlier,non-Tantrik form of Shaivism was called the Atimārga, or “the Higher Path”(because it saw itself as transcending ordinary religion and society). Itexisted for at least four centuries before Tantrik Shaivism burst onto thescene. Unlike the Tantra, it was limited to male brāhmin renunciates, did notembrace worldly aims, and did not emphasize spiritual community (among otherdifferences). Nonetheless, it also had much in common with the later Tantra. Forexample, in the Atimārga, practitioners sought to transcend the ego, attachmentto the body, and fear of death. They did this through solitary meditation nearcremation grounds, using the five brahma-mantras that also appear later in theTantra. (These five mantras constitute one of the very few links between theVedic and Tantrik traditions. They correspond to the five faces of Śiva. Themost well-known of the five today is the Rudra gāyatrī mantra, Om tatpuruṣāyavidmahe | mahādevāya dhīmahi | tannorudraḥ prachodayāt, corresponding to theEastern face of Lord Śiva.) Some of these ascetics—worshippers of Bhairava, thefierce form of Śiva—sought this transcendence by enacting the so-called “GreatVow” (mahā-vrata) in which one imitated Bhairava by wandering naked, smearedwith ash, begging one’s food in a bowl made from a human skull, meditating inthe cremation ground, and sometimes pretending to be insane. Amazingly, theseascetics voluntarily adopted the behavior and markings of the most rejectedmembers of society.65 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en65]This was all part of a carefully designed strategy to throw off socialprogramming, inflated pride, and bad karma while simultaneously overcoming fearof death and ultimately attaining a divine state. Their religious life,including its sometimes unconventional behavior, was detailed in a thoroughlylaid out path to transcendence described in a scripture called thePāśupata-sūtra, from whence they took their name (the Pāśupatas).We see similar antinomian or purposefully socially deviant behavior in some ofthe more radical branches of nondual Tantra, though since the practitioners ofthe latter were usually householders rather than ascetics, it generally tookplace in private rituals, not public settings. We may also note that Bhairava isthe name under which the divine Absolute is most frequently evoked in nondualŚaiva Tantra. So there are a number of points of continuity between(pre-Tantrik) Shaivism and the Tantra that cannot be found in other Indianreligions.Additionally, there are similar points of doctrine. Śaivas of the Atimārga werecomplete monotheists, some of the earliest monotheists in Indian religion. Likethe later Śaiva Tāntrikas, they believed in one supreme Deity, whom they calledŚiva (hence the name of the religion, Shaivism). Some of them also believed thatŚiva had many lower emanations, called the Rudras, divine beings that ruled thevarious dimensions of reality. Their cosmological vision of a hierarchy of otherplanes of existence was important for their practice, because they believed thatattaining knowledge of each of these planes, they would be able to ascend to thehighest level of reality, that of Śiva himself, when they left the body. This isvery similar to a part of the Tantrik View.So the Atimārga influenced the development of the Tantra in at least three ways:❖ the practice of yoga (= meditation) as a means to liberation,❖ the doctrine of liberation through rising through the planes of reality tobecome identical with the deity, and❖ the transcending of karma through certain antinomian forms of behavior itadvocated as spiritual practice.Additionally, the Atimārgins worked with mantras that would be used in laterTantrik practice (the brahma-mantras) and had nascent ideas about theinternalization of sacred geography that were developed into the pan-Tantrikteaching of the body as microcosm of the sacred universe.Anyone who cares to investigate in an unbiased manner will discover moredoctrinal, cultural, and aesthetic similarities between Tantra and AtimārgicShaivism than with any other contemporaneous Indian religion; therefore, themost likely conclusion is that the one grew organically out of the other.early śaiva tantra:before sectarian developmentsWe know very little about the early history of the Tantra. Śaiva Tantra proper,with nearly all the characteristics we listed in the introduction, probablybegan around the mid-5th century (this estimation is based on the textualevidence; the oral tradition would like to date the beginning of Tantra farearlier). Around 500–550 ce, we get the first indisputably Tantrik text, theNiśvāsa-tattva-saṃhitā, which means something like “the collection of principlesexhaled by God.” This voluminous text is so lengthy and detailed in itscosmology that it suggests the existence of an earlier oral tradition of atleast a century or two. In its hierarchy of worlds it clearly draws on theAtimārga teachings of Shaivism, again implying that the Tantra probably evolvedfrom that religion. The Niśvāsa was composed somewhere in North India, and theonly surviving manuscript is in Nepāl.This scripture nominally belongs to the first of the nine sects of the Tantradetailed later (i.e., the Siddhānta); in fact it is sometimes considered theroot-text of that school, and yet it also exhibits some features that wouldlater be associated with very different (transgressive goddess-worshipping)groups. This suggests that in the earliest phase of the Tantra, the traditionhad not yet differentiated into the two primary currents discussed below (theSiddhānta and the Kaula).The Niśvāsa contains the earliest chapter available to us on Tantrik Yoga(defined as spiritual practice with features unique to the Tantrik scripturalcorpus). This chapter is found in the portion of the text called “Aphorisms onthe Way” (Naya-sūtra). I offer here a brief but fascinating quote from thischapter:66 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en66]The Goddess said: “How does union [yoga] with the Independent Deity [NirālambaŚiva] come about? Having experienced the ‘One Taste’, how further is the stateof [abiding in] Divinity obtained?”The Lord said: “That which may be seen by the eye, that which is within therealm of speech, those things which the mind thinks and which the imaginationimagines, are made aspects of ‘I’ [i.e., appropriated by ego], as is whateverhas a specific form; [therefore] one should search for the place in one’s ownbody where there is no such form. (Nayasūtra 4.11–13)Scholarship in this area is still in its early days, but the above passage showsus an apparent overlap with Buddhist ideas, for we are enjoined to find a placewithin ourselves that is formless and that cannot be appropriated by the ego (orthe “self-image manufacturer,” as the Tāntrikas call it). But actually, as laterscriptures show, the idea of an innate ground of being that is formless andindescribable is just as much a part of Śaiva Tantra as Buddhist.early śaiva tantra: two streamsLet’s take a step back now and sketch the most general features of the emerginglandscape of Śaiva Tantra in its first few centuries (especially 700–1000 ce).It is a tradition of two primary streams. On one side, sometimes called the“right current,” we have a dualistic tradition that❖ emphasized worship of Śiva without Śakti,❖ believed that liberation was solely the result of a powerful ritual initiationand subsequent ritual practice, and❖ did not wish to challenge the social norms prescribed by the brāhmin priestsof Vedic society, but rather sought their acceptance.This current is called the Śaiva Siddhānta (siddhānta means “the establisheddoctrine” or “the orthodoxy”). Its adherents were called Saiddhāntikas. TheŚaiva Siddhānta was the first of the Tantrik groups to come out with a coherentbody of scriptural texts and commentary, and this group also held sway over theorganized religious institutions of Shaivism, like temples and monasteries.I noted above that the Saiddhāntikas were dualistic. That means they held thedoctrine that there are three eternally separate principles of reality: God, themanifest universe, and the individual soul. Here, the universe is seen as thesource of bondage. God frees your soul—whose Godlike quality is concealed by itsembodiment—from bondage by bestowing His grace on you, causing you to seek aguru for initiation. The mantras of that initiation ritual, revealed by God forthat purpose, destroy most of your karma and guarantee that you will beliberated from saṃsāra (the cycle of suffering and repeated death) when youleave your current body. That means your innate divinity will fully manifest,and you will be completely equal to God, but still separate. Now, you may bethinking, “These Saiddhāntika guys don’t sound very Tantrik to me.” That isbecause you are influenced by the common misconception that the other primarystream of Tantra, the “left current” (which we will soon discuss), is the wholeinstead of just a part. But whether you like the Siddhānta or not, it is part ofthe Tantra, because the Saiddhāntikas drew on explicitly Tantrik scriptures,they used Tantrik mantras, and they created forms of Tantrik Yoga that wereinfluential across the entire tradition. Even the nondualists of the leftcurrent acknowledged that the Saiddhāntikas were part of the sametradition—though they argued heavily against their dualistic interpretations ofit. By analogy, the fact that the nondual teachings of the Christian mystics areso different from the Christian mainstream wouldn’t lead you to argue that theyweren’t part of the same religious tradition.The left current of Śaiva Tantra—whose philosophy we referred to as “NŚT”throughout the first half of the book—was a primarily nondualistic group oflineages that are harder to pin down because they were less homogenized andinstitutionalized.67 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en67] Ingeneral, the left current❖ emphasized worship of female divinities and fierce deities,❖ taught that liberation could be attained in this life (not merely at its end)as the result of powerful spiritual experiences attained through the cultivationof insight and yoga, and❖ chose to challenge the traditional social order in various ways, such as byempowering women and performing rituals with transgressive elements (more onthis later).These groups went by a variety of different names, but eventually tended todesignate themselves with the term “Kaula,” which means “from the family(kula),” meaning the family of esoteric Tantrik goddesses. Though it issomething of an anachronistic oversimplification, we may designate the wholeleft current as Kaula.68 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en68]It is interesting to note here that the Kaulas generally did not call themselvesTantriks (or, in Sanskrit, Tāntrika); they reserved that term for the non-Kaulafollowers of the Tantrik scriptures. So we find ourselves in a state of someterminological confusion: the part of the tradition that Westerners refer towhen they say “Tantric” is the Kaula tradition, ironically the very ones thatdid not prefer to use that term. This was partially because “Tāntrika” can meana ritualist, and while the Kaulas also performed ritual ceremonies, they sawthemselves as transcending the necessity for ritual. However, we will continueto follow current usage and use “Tantrik” as a general overarching termreferring to all that derives from the scriptures known as tantras.Lastly, we should note that there were some schools in between these two mainstreams that advocated a kind of middle path, incorporating elements from both.This was not really a middle path of reasonable moderation between two extremeviews, but rather a philosophically vague compromise between transgressive andnon-transgressive practice alternatives. While culturally and aestheticallyrich, the middle ground was philosophically noncommittal and thus did notarticulate a vigorous theology. Though the middle ground was popular, it is lessimportant in a history of ideas. Having said that, the primary text of this“middle ground” tradition, the Svacchanda-tantra, is incredibly rich incosmology and yogic practices, and very much deserves to be mined for its manyhidden gems. It was sufficiently influential that sections of it wereincorporated by a later text of the Trika.the common core doctrines of śaiva tantraSo what did the two streams have in common? They both adhered to the most basicdoctrines of Śaiva Tantra, which we will summarize here. The individual soul isinnately divine, that is, of the same nature as God, but exists in a veiledstate, so that you are ignorant of your own true nature. Therefore, you suffer.Out of His compassion, the Lord has revealed scriptures that explain how thesoul can be liberated from this bound state. These scriptures teach a ceremonyof initiation called dīkṣā, in which powerful mantras (that are in fact aspectsof Śiva’s own consciousness) burn away all the karma that would otherwisedestine you to take birth many more times, thereby granting you the capacity toattain spiritual perfection and freedom during, or at the conclusion of, thisvery life.Anyone who was fit could be initiated, including women and lower-class people.(Nor were you required to become a renunciate after initiation.) You wereconsidered fit if you had received something called “the Descent of Grace” orśakti-pāta. This was considered a private, interior spiritual event in which Godawakens your longing for liberation by infusing you with His spiritual energy(śakti). This awakening causes you to seek out a guru for initiation. The guruthen examines you for the “signs” by which he may infer that the Descent hastaken place. That is the sole qualification for initiation (along with yourdakṣiṇā or financial offering). Once approved, you undergo the dīkṣā ceremony,either alone or with several other people. The guru performs the dīkṣā as avehicle of the Lord, who is the true initiator. The ceremony lasts at least twodays and often had a powerful impact on initiates. Initiation is thought toremove some of the mala or impurity that clouds your perception and limits yourscope of activity. Initiation also empowers you to undertake a daily practiceaimed at bringing about both spiritual liberation and success in worldly goals.the key differencesThe above account of the common doctrinal core obscures how different the twostreams actually were. The right-current Saiddhāntikas believed that mala orimpurity is an actual psychic substance that mars the soul and that only ritualaction can cleanse the soul (similar to the view of some Catholics). Theycompared mala to a cataract on the eye that obscures your vision and that can beremoved only by skilled surgical intervention. By contrast, those of the leftcurrent (= NŚT) argued that mala is actually nothing but ignorance, and thatignorance (of our ever-existent true nature) is the only cause of bondage andsuffering, and that therefore only insight into the true nature of things canliberate us. This difference between the two streams is the necessary result oftheir respective dualist and nondualist doctrines. The nondualists taught thatthe soul has in fact never been separate from God, for the Divine is all thatexists. Therefore liberation is merely having a complete and permanentrealization of how things really are and have always been. There is no problem,and there has never been any problem—other than fact that you think there’s aproblem: the flawed human understanding from which all suffering springs.These contrasting views resulted also in different forms of practice, with thedualists’ emphasizing ritual and the nondualists’ emphasizing the acquisition ofexperiential knowledge, whether through contemplation, meditation, or otherpractices. For the nondualists, even ritual could be a vehicle for this wisdomand, indeed, was only valuable to the extent that it was such.These views also corresponded to differing views regarding the role of the guru.The Saiddhāntikas viewed the guru as primarily a ritual officiant, and neitherrequired nor expected him to be an enlightened master. The Kaulas preferred theliberated, charismatic type of guru, because only that type could transmit thepower and experiential wisdom that was the central element of their practice.(To be clear, the mystic transmission from the guru was not the only way toattain liberating insight in the left current, but it is a way not available tothose in the right current.)differences in the social sphereThere were also social differences between the right and left streams. Theright-current Saiddhāntikas initiated low-caste people, but as part of theirconformist stance regarding the norms of Indian society, they continued toacknowledge caste divisions in their initiation names and by requiringseparation by caste at their gatherings. By contrast, the Kaulas declared thatall initiates formed a single “caste,” that of the lovers of God, within whichall were equal. While they allowed initiates to observe caste in their dailylives, there was to be no acknowledgment of caste in gatherings of the kula(initiated community). Such acknowledgment was in fact grounds for removal fromthe group. Some of the Kaulas went further, initiating even the lowest-statusoutcastes or “untouchables,” who were considered almost like another species,absolutely beyond the pale of proper Indian society. These extreme followers ofthe Kaula left current argued that the whole notion of caste was merely acultural construct, not a fact of nature, and therefore must be whollytranscended.While Saiddhāntikas did initiate women, they did not in general allow them toundertake a daily practice. As you might have guessed, the Kaulas both initiatedwomen and encouraged them to practice. The most extreme Kaula group, known asthe Krama or Mahānaya (the Great Way), even consecrated women as full-statusgurus. These attitudes to human women were paralleled in each group’s ritualrelations with goddesses. Saiddhāntikas barely acknowledged Śiva’s femalecounterpart, Śakti, in their worship. The Kaula groups worshipped pantheons ofgoddesses, which were pictured as increasingly dominant over the male deitiesthe further “left” the group was (see the chart below). The Krama was the onlygroup to worship the Goddess exclusively.early shamanistic rootsand their kaula re-interpretationWhile the right-current Siddhānta modeled their religion on the Vedic prototypethat had been dominant in earlier elite Indian religion (especially 1000 bce–400ce), the left-current Kaula path emerged out of an equally old but more“populist” stratum of Indian religion, a fascinating and strange shamanisticvisionary world of propitiation of nature goddesses and animal-headed yoginīs.This is an area of Indian religion that is not well documented because it waslargely illiterate, though we see many signs of its influence on literatereligion. This shamanistic world, which was the older cultural background of theKaula stream and thus provided its aesthetic template, involved rituals andpower-seeking rites that might seem disturbing, unbelievable, or even abhorrentto us. The sādhaka or ascetic practitioner performed these rites in frighteningplaces such as cremation grounds, using mortuary elements like human skulls andash from the funeral pyre. The rites invoked groups of wild and fiercegoddesses, often envisioned as nature spirits (sometimes called ḍākinīs oryoginīs), led by a chief Goddess or by the fierce form of Śiva called Bhairavaas a kind of “Lord of the Hunt.” If the sādhaka’s practice was successful, thedeities appeared to him, at which point he would make a blood offering, usuallyof his own blood. If he successfully resisted the pull into fear and confusion,staying steady in his devotion, he would be accepted by the goddesses and wouldrise into the sky with them, becoming the leader of their wild band—in otherwords becoming exactly like Bhairava. Or so the narrative goes.69[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en69]Now, before you get scared off, let me be clear—this picture of things does notdescribe the type of practice undertaken by the Kaulas of the nondual Tantra inthe era with which we are concerned. Rather, it forms a part of their ancientcultural background, the wild and weird popular religion that was inherited bythe Kaula tradition. By the late 9th century the Kaulas often were highlyeducated* people and refined aesthetes (lovers of art and beauty) and sometimeswere connected to the royal court. Still, they had to deal with an earlierscriptural tradition that at times emphasized these otherworldly magical rites,some of which were offensive to educated society. You see, ancient India was adeeply traditional society in which there was no possibility of simply rejectingan earlier layer of one’s own tradition. If the earlier tradition did not fitthe current paradigm, it had to be reinterpreted. This is precisely what themore sophisticated Kaulas of classical Tantra did. They did not take theshamanistic rite described above literally; rather, they argued (and no doubtbelieved) that the wild goddesses were expressions of the various energies ofthe human mind and body. The mortuary symbols were taken to representtranscendence of the ego and the attachment to body-based identity. When the egois suspended, they taught, external objects lose their otherness and shinewithin consciousness as the flavors of pure aesthetic experience. The goddessesof the sense-energies are gratified by this offering of “nectar” and therebyconverge, fusing with the practitioner’s radiant and expansive awareness. Hethereby experiences himself as a single mass of blissful consciousness. Finallythen, flying through the sky as Bhairava himself was taken to indicate anawe-inspiring divine state in which the liberated practitioner flies free in thesky of pure awareness, unbound by ordinary limiting cognitions but stillembodied, i.e., still possessed of his senses and faculties (the band ofgoddesses).70 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en70]This process of reinterpretation (sometimes called “hermeneutics”) is central toall religions. The important thing to understand is that from inside thereligion, it has no quality of artificiality. Rather, the interpreters believethat they are simply drawing out the real, deeper meaning of the earlyscriptures, the meaning that God had always intended. (This is not to say thatthe sophisticated Kaula interpreters totally rejected those ascetics who choseto pursue cremation-ground ritual and power-seeking; such ascetics, who hadbecome the minority, were benignly tolerated as something like an eccentric andsocially inappropriate cousin, embarrassing at times but still part of thefamily.)So the sophisticated and literate expression of left-current nondual ŚaivaTantra “purified” the shocking or repellent elements of early goddess worship,not by rejecting them but by reinterpreting them as the elements of interiorspiritual experience. These Kaulas were great aesthetes, especially in Kashmīr,where the left current flourished. For them, the highest state of consciousnesswas that of camatkāra, that is, wonder or aesthetic rapture, the experience ofamazement at the raw and vivid beauty of embodied existence. Their“aestheticization” of earlier tradition fit in well with their nondualistbeliefs, for now they could confront even the apparently horrific states ofdeath and so-called impurity as aspects of their own divine inner being, aspectsof the total beauty of existence. You may see this perspective in certainvarieties of Tantrik art that still survive, depicting fierce yet benevolentdeities, such as that of the Newars of the Kāthmāndu Valley.71[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en71] Fierce deities are anexclusive characteristic of the nondual type of Tantra.the nine main sects ofśaiva tantraAbove we have examined Śaiva Tantra in terms of two streams. The truth is therewas a spectrum of groups, as the diagram below indicates. The further left onthe spectrum a group is, the more it emphasizes the following features:nondualism, worship of the feminine, inclusion of women, transgression of socialnorms, occasional mortuary symbolism, and charismatic gurus.72[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en72] As we’ve just discussed,there is a near-total absence of these on the far right. 73[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en73][image/emphasis_chart.jpg]Now we will look at the nine main sects of Śaiva Tantra, in more or lesschronological order. The development of these groups spans about five hundredyears (600–1100 ce), with their literature slowly increasing in sophisticationin over this period. We also see gradual shifts toward a householder rather thanascetic audience, more teachings on liberation rather than worldly attainments,and increasing attention to the goddess-centered nondualist groups. Thegeographical reach of the Tantra in this period is the entire Indiansubcontinent, comprising modern India, Pakistān, Nepāl, Bhutan, Tibet, andBangladesh, as well as parts of Cambodia, Vietnam, and Indonesia. (Below you cansee a map of the Indian subcontinent indicating some of the key Tantrik sites.)[image/map.jpg]For each of the nine original Tantrik sects, I will list the form of the Deityworshipped, the principal mantra, and the principal scripture. (For a morecomprehensive list of the key texts associated with each sect, see appendix 3.)These are the three features that most clearly distinguish one Tantrik groupfrom another, for in traditional India practice was more definitive thandoctrine. For example, people of different religious groups would ask each othernot “What do you believe?” but rather “What do you practice?” or “Whom do youworship?”Since many of the sects are accompanied by an illustration of the deity-formworshipped by that sect, we should pause for a moment to consider the role ofimages in this tradition. Some people, influenced by the Judeo-Christian-Islamictraditions, are put off by images of the Divine and consider worship of them asidolatry or at least a lower form of religion. In the Tantra, images are bestdescribed as “icons of essence”—that is, they are to be seen as expressive ofthe “vibration” of the deity in question, whose true nature is a kind ofenergy-signature or flavor of divine Consciousness. So images are symbols thatpoint toward that essence, and they are never confused with the essence itself.Because the original purpose of these images is to convey something of theenergy-signature of the deity, the artist74[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en74] engaged to create theextraordinary deity images in this book has depicted his subjects with greatfidelity to the original sources and, at the same time, has utilized conventionsof Western art that allow readers to more easily connect with these images.A note on correct terminology: the word “sect” is associated in the minds ofmany with the sectarian history of religion in Europe, which consists ofschisms, hatred, and violent struggle. This is not the case here; though thereis evidence of competition and debate, there is in fact no evidence whatsoeverof violence or open animosity amongst these groups. There was rather aconsiderable amount of sharing; so rather than the word “sect,” we can use amuch nicer Sanskrit word, sampradāya, which means something like “lineage group,specific tradition, practice tradition,” and “school of thought” combined. Letus now turn to sample the flavor of the nine Śaiva Tantrik sampradāyas.the nine sampradāyas oforiginal śiva-śakti tantra❖ Śaiva Siddhānta – the Orthodox Doctrine❖ Vāma – the Feminine❖ Yāmala – the Couple❖ Mantrapīṭha – the Throne of Mantras❖ Amṛteśvara – the Lord of Nectar❖ Trika – the Trinity❖ Kālīkula – the Family of Kālī❖ Kaubjika – Kubjikā’s Tradition❖ Śrīvidyā – the Goddess of Auspicious Wisdom[image/Sadashiva.jpg]Tatra siṃhāsane devaṃ śuddha-sphaṭika-nirmalam |pañcāsyaṃ daśadordaṇḍaṃ prativaktraṃ trilocanam ||jaṭā-mukuṭa-śobhāḍhyaṃ sphuraccandrārdha-śekharam |Sadāśivaṃ nyasen mūrtiṃ śivaśaktyantagocarām ||sampradāya 1:Saiva [image/saiva.gif]Deity: SadāśivaVisualization: white-bodied, five-faced, three-eyed, and ten-armed, in theposture of a meditating yogī.Mantra: HAUṂPrincipal Texts: Kiraṇa-tantra, Parākhya-tantra, KālottaraThe first sampradāya is that of the Siddhānta, which we have already discussedabove. We will not spend much more time on it, for it is not the focus of thisbook, despite its crucial historical significance. Before moving on, however, itis important to stress the relationship between the Saiddhāntika and Kaulascriptures.The Siddhānta was considered by most initiated Śaivas as the broad base of thetradition, the general revelation, while the Kaula texts were considered (bytheir adherents, at least) the specialized revelation. Thus, the Kaula textsassumed knowledge of much that was contained in the Siddhānta-tantras,inflecting or refining or transcending that knowledge in various ways. Afterdescribing all the differences between the two, this relationship may seemsurprising. But remember that there are many commonalities between them, such asbelief in the innate divinity of the soul, its obscuration, the importance ofinitiation, and so on. Furthermore, we should note that practice was, on thewhole, much more important than doctrine in Śaiva Tantra, and between the rightand left currents there were even more commonalities in practice than indoctrine. So you see, the Kaula scriptures were “specialized” in the sense thatthey needed only to include information on what differentiated them from thebroad base of the orthodox Siddhānta.The other important distinction to mention in this regard is how the two groupssaw each other. The Siddhānta regarded the Kaula teachings critically, seeingthem either as invalid or as specialized techniques for the attainment ofparticular powers. Of course, the Saiddhāntikas did not believe that the Kaulateachings gave any special advantage in the attainment of liberation, and theydenied that the nondualist interpretation of the scriptures was correct. Bycontrast, while the nondualist Kaula Śaivas saw their teachings as transcendingthe Siddhānta, they did not deny the truth of many of the Saiddhāntikadoctrines. This may seem surprising. But recall that NŚT had an inclusivistview, in which it posited a “hierarchy of revelation.” According to this view,if we move from the exoteric to the esoteric, everything in scripture A is trueexcept what conflicts with scripture B which overrides the former and is itselfoverriden by the more esoteric and more specialized scripture C, and so on. Sofrom the perspective of the nondual Kaulas, the Siddhānta simply constituted alower revelation, revealed by Śiva for the benefit of those who were not yetready to embrace nondualism. As you can see, the argument for a hierarchy ofrevelation corresponds to an argument for a hierarchy of truth as well. Lowertruths are valid in their own domain but can be superseded by a higher truthwhen the practitioner attains perception of a higher level of reality. Thenondualists practiced what they preached by trying to avoid any exclusion. Whilesome might see the hierarchical structure as condescending to those ranked low,it really is the only way to have a coherent nonrelativist yet nonexclusivistsystem.75 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en75][image/cone_chart.jpg]As the diagram above shows, the way in which the Kaulas saw themselves astranscending the exoteric Śaiva Siddhānta differed in the domain of practiceversus doctrine. In the latter domain, the higher (increasingly nondual) viewswere also more all-encompassing and all-inclusive (right cone in the diagram).By contrast, at least in terms of a visual metaphor, the higher forms ofpractice added to the broad base of the tradition while also entailing theoption of dropping the lower forms, since the higher forms—though simpler andmore gnostic than ritualistic—were thought to incorporate the lower incompressed form by virtue of that very gnostic power of all-encompassing insight(left cone in the diagram).It is important to note that much of the powerful yogic technology developedwithin the Tantra had its origins in the Siddhānta. Other groups borrowedextensively from the large Saiddhāntika repertoire of yogic practices (i.e.,meditation techniques, prānāyāmas, subtle body practices linked with mantras,and so on). The Kaulas often came up with simpler, easier and more directtechniques of awarenesscultivation, but these were often modifications of the standard Saiddhāntikaforms. Furthermore, the Siddhānta tantras contained some quite beautiful andthought-provoking passages on the nature and practice of yoga, such as:Yoga is the means of revealing the infinitely radiant light of the divinesoul.76 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en76](Matanga-pārameśvara)So we would be foolish indeed to discount the Siddhānta’s crucial contributionsimply because their theologians adhered to a dualistic view.The last point to be made here about the Siddhānta concerns its laterdevelopment into an important tradition that survives in South India to thepresent day. Like all of the Śaiva Tantrik traditions, the Siddhānta wasoriginally pan-Indian. As time went on, it became particularly successful in theSouth, especially the Tamiḷ region, supported by and connected to the strongŚaiva devotional (bhakti) movement there. Under the influence of the growingsuccess of another Indian philosophy called Advaita Vedānta, the Siddhānta madea fundamental shift in its philosophical position in the period after the 12thcentury: it became nondualist. Eventually, the Siddhānta survived only in TamiḷNāḍu, where it shaped the pattern of ritual in the temple culture. Today, mostpractitioners and even many scholars of the Tamiḷ Śaiva Siddhānta do not realizethat it is a direct descendent of the earlier dualistic Tantrik tradition thatwe have been discussing. This is not surprising, because it has changed a lotdoctrinally over the centuries (to the extent that its philosophy can no longerbe called Tantrik, though its practice still is). That the later southernnondualistic Siddhānta is a direct descendent of the earlier pan-Indiandualistic Siddhānta has been indisputably proven by Alexis Sanderson and one ofhis foremost students Dominic Goodall, who specializes in this area.We will conclude this section on the Śaiva Siddhānta with a brief sample passagefrom its literature. This will serve the important function of demonstratingthat the yoga taught in the Saiddhāntika texts is integral to the Tantra as awhole. You may be surprised to recognize terms in this passage; this is because,as we will see, Śaiva Tantrik Yoga went on to influence if not give rise to thehaṭha-yoga tradition.Since this is the History section of the book, we will not explain each samplepassage fully. But note that in the quite early (c. 7th century) passage below,Kuṇḍalinī is visualized in the region of the heart, after being summoned therefrom her home in the crown of the head, where she dwells eternally with Śiva.77[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en77] The Goddess-energy, herecalled the Primordial Power, is summoned to the heart center and fixed there bya fusion of the vital energies, breath, mantric resonance, and concentration ofmind. This yogic practice activates her potential as Kuṇḍalinī, so that she cansurge upward toward the highest spiritual center, bringing the soul (contractedindividuated consciousness) with her.A lotus with eight petals dwells within the center of the space of the heart.Inside its pericarp, there are four Powers, shining with the radiance of thesun, the moon, fire, and gold. The primordial Power of God moves above thesefour. The soul [individuated consciousness] is concealed there, like a bee, inthe heart-lotus with its fourfold power.The Primordial Power is Kuṇḍalinī [when] fused with the sun [piṅgalā channel],moon [iḍā channel], and fire [suṣumnā channel]. She is to be visualized andexperienced in the region of the heart, abiding there in the form of a tongue offlame.78 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en78](Sārdha-triśati-kālottara: 350 Verses on the Transcendence of Time)"},{"pageContent":"SAMPRADĀYA 2:Vama [image/vama.gif]Deities: the four sister-goddesses Jayā, Vijayā, Jayantī and Aparājitā, withtheir brother Tumburu-bhairavaPrincipal text: Vīṇāśikhā (only surviving text)This tradition was widespread in the early period (it was mentioned even by theBuddhist scholar Dharmakīrti in 600 ce, and one of its scriptures was discoveredfar from India, in the Dunhuang caves in China); it had all but died out wellbefore the peak of Tantrik culture. It does not concern us much, as itsinfluence was minimal, but it must be mentioned as one of the nine originalsampradāyas. Though we know little about the Vāma sampradāya, we can see that itwas significant as one of the earliest goddess-worshipping traditions to emergein the previously highly masculine-oriented religious culture of India. It isalso one of the earliest transgressive traditions, where power accrues to theworshipper in part through the breaking of social norms and their associatedthought-structures. Its system was adopted by one of the earliest Buddhisttantras, the Mañjuśriya-mūla-kalpa.The Vīṇāśikhā-tantra tells us that the four goddesses, whose names indicate thatthey were probably originally worshipped in order to secure victory in battle,are visualized as white, red, golden, and black respectively. Their vehiclesare, respectively, a corpse, an owl, a horse, and a flying car. Their four-facedbrother Tumburu (the name indicates a non-Sanskritic derivation) is visualizedas a composite of his four sisters.

Picu-mataThe Yāmala tradition is attested early on (for it is mentioned in a 6th-centurymythological text, the Skanda-purāṇa), though as far as we can tell, it did notsurvive much into the classical period (900–1100 ce). It is positioned on thespectrum just to the left of the Mantrapīṭha tradition (see next section), andthus the female deity is slightly emphasized over the male. The Yāmala does notfit neatly into the spectrum, however, for it features some of the most intensemortuary imagery and transgressive cremation ground practices of any of thesects.In the ancient Yāmala tradition, which is aimed primarily at the power-seekingascetic, we are deep in the shamanistic roots of Tantra described earlier[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-12.xhtml#earlyshaman]: a world ofmagical powers and arcane rituals performed in the cremation ground on a newmoon night, using human skulls and summoning spirit powers. The primary text ofthis tradition that has come down to us, the Brahma-yāmala, is primarilyconcerned with ritual, and contains a huge amount of material on the magicaltechnologies wielded by Tāntrikas: mantric incantations, special hand gestures(mudrā), mystic diagrams, and so on.79[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en79] Now, the fact that theBrahma-yāmala is quoted a number of times by the later sophisticated Kaulawriter and spiritual genius Abhinava Gupta in his Light on the Tantras shows ussomething important about the development of the classical tradition. ThoughAbhinava Gupta was not at all in accord with the type of Tantra presented inmuch of the Brahma-yāmala—for example, he preached against grasping aftermagical powers, seeing them as antithetical to spiritual liberation—he still can(and does) cite the text in support of his teachings on supreme nondualism(paramādvaya). This is possible because of an important doctrine found in thenondual tradition: that in His mysterious wisdom, Śiva has hidden nuggets of theTruth even in the dualistic and power-obsessed scriptures, nuggets that revealthemselves when the given text is “bathed in nondual awareness” by the reader.Thus an author like Abhinava can cite a text like the Brahma-yāmala withoutcondoning everything that is found in it. This is important because it is atheology of scripture that is quite different from the one most Westerners areused to (in which all of the passages in a book like the Bible or Qur’ān areequally authoritative and divine). The guru is (as Brooks has argued) a kind of“living canon.” This means that if Abhinava were your guru, the parts of theBrahma-yāmala that he cites would be scripture for you, and not any other parts.The following sample passage from the Brahma-yāmala might be an example of oneof these “truth-nuggets.” I should note that selecting this passage reflects myown preferences, for it is not at all representative of the text, which containsvery little in the way of theology or philosophy. Indeed (from what I’ve seen),this passage is the sole View teaching (darśana) given in the text. Given itsoriginal context, the beauty of the passage is, however, especiallyremarkable.80 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en80]The One described as “beyond conception” is Śiva, the supreme cause, yet withoutname and unchanging, all-pervasive and quiescent. He is without an inherentnature [for he becomes everything], O great Goddess; He is devoid of action andcause, undifferentiated, un-graspable through mental constructs, formless, freefrom the three Guṇas, beyond notions of “I” and “mine,” and situated in thestate of non-duality. Yogīs [alone] may approach Him through meditation, for hisnature is wisdom. Abiding in the state beyond normative action, that HighestLord is nothing but Consciousness. He, the bestower of grace for all, has theform of unparalleled Light, and is pervasive, unmanifest, beyond mind, andgreat.His Śakti arises by Her own nature, not produced [from him]. Her nature is likethat of the refreshing and delightful moonlight, with crystalline rays. She ishis Will Power, emerging in the form of pure insight yet transcending the mind,and without semblance: she is called Avadhūtā (she who has cast off all form andlimitation). She, the Infinite One, awakens the supreme Point [bindu] and thesupreme Sound [nāda] instantaneously. Shaped like a coil, she exists in thesounds of the syllabary, beginning with the vowels . . . . Thus, the KuṇḍalinīŚakti exists [as a cakra] with the sixteen vowels.

Its central text, a vast work called theSvacchanda-tantra, tells us much about Tantrik practice and cosmology but littleabout philosophy. The Mantrapīṭha tradition occupied a kind of middle groundbetween the Siddhānta and Kaula traditions we have discussed at some length;that is, it had some goddess-worship and some mildly transgressive elements (forexample, wine or rice-beer would be offered to the deity but not consumed by thepractitioner). The Mantrapīṭha did not have a clearly defined philosophy orView, thus, in a probable attempt to win adherents from this very popularschool, both the Saiddhāntikas and the Kaulas produced commentaries on theSvacchanda-tantra, interpreting it in light of their own doctrines. We may inferthat the nondualists won this debate, as their commentary is preserved whilethat from the Siddhānta is not. I am referring to the Kaula commentary calledthe Svacchanda-tantra-uddyota (Illumination of the Tantra of the IndependentBhairava) written by the great scholar-sage Kṣemarāja of the Trika school (seesampradāya #6). We can only hope that someone translates this important textsoon, though at least there exists a major dissertation in English on it.81[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en81]The Mantrapīṭha’s success can also be measured by the fact thatSvacchanda-Bhairava received worship in Kashmīr and Nepāl all the way down tothe 20th century. The deity provides an interesting balance of the playful andthe intensely powerful, as can be seen by the illustration. Both qualitiesrelate to His essence-nature of radical autonomy.The following sample passage emphasizes the egalitarian nature of the kula(spiritual community) that prevailed in the Bhairava- and Goddess-focusedgroups. It stresses that cultivating equal vision is part of the path tofreedom.All those who have been initiated by this ritual are of equal nature, whetherthey be brāhmins . . . or outcastes. They have been brought into a state offusion with the nature of Śiva. [In assembly] they may not sit according to thedivisions of their former castes; [for] they are said to form but a single casteof Bhairava, auspicious and eternal. Once a person has taken up this Tantriksystem, he may never mention his former caste. . . . O Empress of the Gods, itis through [this] freedom from discrimination that one will certainly attainboth siddhi and liberation.82[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en82] (Svacchanda-tantra)In Abhinava Gupta’s esoteric writings, sampradāyas #2 and 4, the Vāma and theMantrapīṭha, which he calls the Left and Right schools, are correlated to twoaspects of the Tantra that we have discussed: on the one hand, those ofpreoccupation with sensual beauty and, on the other, mortuary imagery aimed atthe transcendence of death. They are also correlated with the two lateralchannels of the subtle body. To spell out his correlations:Vāma Mantrapīṭha Feminine Masculine Sensual Mortuary Creation DissolutionKnowing Acting Left channel Right channel Inhale ExhaleThe purpose of making these correlations, which he justifies with reference tothe scriptures, is to argue for the Kaula Trika (sampradāya #6) as the middlepath into which these streams feed and which constitutes the balance point ofthe two extremes. Thus the Kaula tradition, which harmoniously fuses elementsfrom both columns above, corresponds to the central channel and the power ofpure Impulse (icchā). And the Kaula Trika is pictured as the summit and fusionpoint of these channels, the undifferentiated Bliss of Consciousness, whichthrough its dynamic oscillations creates these polarities.83[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en83] (In this schema, theYāmala, sampradāya #3, is situated just below the Kaula Trika, before theperfect fusion of the three streams.) For more on the Trika, see the relevantsection [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-19.xhtml].Note that the correlations in the above columns are commonly found throughoutthe tradition; Abhinava’s innovation here is to connect them with the Vāma andMantrapīṭha sects."},{"pageContent":"[image/Amriteshvara.jpg]māmānandayase deva prasannenaiva cakṣuṣā |amṛtākāravac chubhraṃ jagadāpyāyakārakam ||"},{"pageContent":"SAMPRADĀYA 5:Amrtesvara [image/amrtesvara.gif]Deity: Amṛteśvara (Lord of Nectar)Visualization: white, one-faced, and four-armed, with his consort LakṣhmīMantra: OṂ JUṂ SAḤPrincipal text: Netra-tantra (The Scripture of the Eye)This tradition did not command the exclusive devotion of a substantial group offollowers like the others named here, but was influential nevertheless,especially in Kashmīr. This influence was possibly due to its unusuallybroad-minded and nonsectarian attitude: its central text teaches that theAmṛteśvara mantra may be used in the worship of any form of the deity withoutdistinction, whether Viṣṇu, Gaṇesh, etc., and including even the Buddha (this ismost unusual in the given cultural context). In other words, whatever form ofthe Divine you want to honor, you can preface your obeisance with the Amṛteśvaramantra. In so doing, you are acknowledging that all deities are emanations ofthe one Divine, the Lord of Nectar, whose nature is to bestow nectareanblessings on all His devotees. For example, if you were bowing to the Buddha,you would say Oṃ juṃ saḥ buddhāya namaḥ, thus honoring the Buddha as a form ofthe Lord of Nectar. (Of course, many Buddhists would likely disagree with thenotion that the Buddha is an emanation of Śiva.) In its eighth chapter theNetra-tantra says:Though One, He can be meditated upon in many forms, all of which will bestowtheir fruit. He can be worshipped alone or with His consort, as expressingduality, nonduality, or both, using any of the methods described in thescriptures; all will bear their fruit (when combined with Amṛteśvara’s mantra).(Netra-tantra 8.56–7)Furthermore, the scripture suggests that the Amṛteśvara mantra can be used toenliven old mantras from lineages no longer extant, and that have therefore losttheir potency.Kṣemarāja wrote a full commentary on this text as well. Following the lead ofhis teacher Abhinava Gupta, Kṣemarāja uses his commentary to introduce nondualteachings, as in his analysis of the visualization of Amṛteśvara. The latter isto be visualized, we are told in chapter 3, as brilliant white, one-faced,three-eyed, wide-eyed, and four-armed, sitting on the lunar disc in the centerof a white lotus. In two of His four hands He holds a jar of nectar and a fullmoon. The other two display the gestures of boon-granting (varada-mudrā) andprotection (abhaya-mudrā, though note that this mudrā is hidden behind Hisconsort; or perhaps, she is the emanation of the protective mudrā). Kṣemarājacomments on this as follows:When the scripture says “one should visualize the Lord of gods in His own form”or essential nature, it means you should contemplate your own form as white andtranslucent, as the pure, joyful light of unlimited consciousness, delightfulbecause it manifests the entire universe on its own canvas through the power ofits autonomy. The deity is described as “one-faced” because He is one with theextraordinary Power of Freedom; and He is “three-eyed” because He is united withthe three Powers of Willing, Knowing, and Acting, which are manifested throughthe greatness of that freedom. He is “wide-eyed” to express the fact that theuniverse manifests from these three powers. His four hands display the gesturesof boon-granting and protection and hold the jar of nectar and the full moon toindicate respectively that the Divine bestows worldly success, uproots all fear,and unfolds the true nature of the Self as consisting of the divine powers ofKnowing and Acting.84 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en84](Commentary on Netra-tantra 3.17–22)Thus Kṣemarāja translates the visualized features of the deity to the variouspowers and capacities of the individual, who is an embodiment of that deity. Wesee this strategy of micro-macrocosmic correlation again and again on the partof the nondualists. In other words, whatever features are present in the natureof the Divine are also present in each individual, and the Tāntrikas areinterested in mapping those features in detail and realizing each of theminternally.Take note that since it is the deity that is primary in these systematiccorrelations, we are not seeing a deification of the human personality so muchas an overwriting of the latter with the Divine personality that is its truenature and ground. That is, the central Tantrik teaching “you are God” shouldnot be taken to indicate a kind of anthropocentric narcissism but somethingclose to its opposite: that your real self is not what you think, is not yoursocially and psychologically constructed persona at all, but rather is theinfinite Light of Consciousness, in which your whole personality and lifehistory constitute a kind of fleeting thought, a moment of self-reflection.[image/Para.jpg]naumi cit-pratibhāṃ devīṃ parāṃ bhairava-yoginīm |mātṛ-māna-prameyāṃśa-śūlāmbuja-kṛtāspadām ||"},{"pageContent":"SAMPRADĀYA 6:trika [image/trika.gif]Deities: the three goddesses Parā, Parāparā, and AparāVisualization (of Parā): white, radiant, two- or four-armed, displayingcin-mudrā, a manuscript, a mālā, and a tridentMantra: SAUḤ; also HRĪṂPrincipal text: Mālinī-vijaya-uttara-tantra; Vijñāna-bhairava-tantraIf you hear the term “Kashmīr Shaivism,” it is generally referring to thephilosophy of the Trika school of Śaiva Tantra. The Trika school is oftenassociated with Kashmīr because its greatest exponent, Abhinava Gupta, was fromŚrīnagar in the Kashmīr Valley. In fact, though, the Trika was pan-Indian, likemost of the Śaiva groups. We have evidence of this from an early period in bothOrissa and Mahārāṣṭra, and it seems that the latter may have been its homeland.It is certainly the case that Abhinava Gupta’s guru’s guru came from Mahārāṣṭra(in west-central India). The founder of the Trika is said to be a sage namedTryambaka, who might have been associated with Tryambakeshwar, a beautifulpower-site in rural Mahārāṣṭra where there is a temple still in operation today.The Trika (Trinity) was an unusual sampradāya because, in its later phase, itsdoctrine encompassed duality, nonduality, and the inexpressible teaching beyondboth duality and nonduality. This is why the great master Abhinava Gupta madethe Trika the fulcrum of his summation and explanation of the whole tradition ofŚaiva Tantra.[image/Trika_Triptych_pageadjustment.jpg]Parā (top), Parāparā (left), and Aparā (right)Abhinava embraced the more strongly nondualist version of the Trika known as the“Kaula Trika,” which is said to have been founded by Tryambaka’s daughter,making it the only major lineage to have been founded by a woman. Briefly, theKaula Trika is an essentialized, interiorized, and aestheticized version of theTrika, and is thus considered a higher, more esoteric expression.Adherents of the Trika worshipped three goddesses: the sweet and gentleParā-devī (Supreme Goddess), flanked by Her two lower, fierce Kālī-likeemanations, called Parāparā and Aparā (see the illustration). These three areunderstood as the embodiments of the following principles:Parā Parāparā Aparā Knower Knowledge Known Willing Knowing Acting UnityUnity-in-diversity Diversity Emission Stasis ReabsorptionAparā, the third goddess, is depicted as utterly terrifying because the world ofduality and karmically-charged action is terrifying. However, through thespiritual practices of the Trika, you are to realize that she is nothing but anemanation of the nectar-sweet, beautiful, and soothing Parā, the Goddess ofunity and creative impulse (icchā-śakti). With this realization, Aparā becomesunterrifying (aghorī) and her fierceness is seen as your own heroic power in thesphere of action, now properly grounded in its source, the transcendentalGoddess. Finally, then, the second goddess Parāparā is depicted as midwaybetween the other two, sharing both their qualities.85[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en85][image/Trika_Mandala_FINAL.png]These three Goddesses are to be visualized on lotus-thrones positioned on thetips of a trident (a symbol of Śiva), the staff of which is visualized ascoextensive with the meditator’s spine (see the illustration). With this image,an icon of essence which visually depicts the Deity-Self revealed by thescriptural transmission, we are invited to contemplate the entire map of sacredreality within our own bodies. All thirty-six tattvas are contained in this map.The swelling at the base of the staff represents the five fundamental elements(pañca-mahābhūtas), the staff constitutes the tattvas up to Māyā, the knot ofthe banner at the level of the palate is Māyā-tattva, the plinth at the level ofthe third eye is Śuddhavidyā-tattva, the lotus above that is Īśvara-tattva, andlying on the lotus in śavāsana is Sadāśiva, gazing upward to the higher light ofthe Trika above him. The trident itself emerges from the practitioner’sfontanelle (which is coterminous with Sadāśiva’s navel) and expresses Śiva-Śaktiin three aspects: the All-pervasive Power (vyāpinī), the Equalizing Power(samanā), and the Transmental Power (unmanā). With this last Power, the level ofthe three white lotuses on the tips of the trident (and above), we have left theuniverse behind; that is, we are “outside” time and space. The Transmental iswhat remains after the whole of manifest reality dissolves: the ultimate “groundof being.” On this level, the meditator is to see the three Powers representedby the three goddesses abandoning their differences and fusing into the Heart ofhis own consciousness. This Heart, the invisible Fourth Power, is the secretdoctrine of the Trika (trika-rahasya). It is the point of repose within the pureautonomy of the Self, the point that finally reabsorbs the distinction betweenPower and “I” as the holder of Power (śakti and śaktimān), between theworshipped and the worshipper.86[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en86]So the three goddesses of the Trika are actually expressions of one GreatGoddess, Mātṛsadbhāva, yet another name for tattva #0. She is the transcendentyet all-encompassing Power of cidānanda, blissfully self-aware Consciousness (orwe could translate, “Consciousness in love with itself”). It is from thiscidānanda, the fundamental, ever-existent, essential nature of reality, that thethree Powers mentioned above arise. Mātṛsadbhāva is understood to be the higheror inner nature of Parā, so I will continue to use the latter name for Her.87[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en87]Parā is also short for Parā-vāk, “the Supreme Word.” She is the deep structureof reality, the organic patterning of Consciousness. She is characterized withthe word pratibhā, a word with no English equivalent: it simultaneously means“intuitive insight,” “creative inspiration,” and “natural instinct.” Thisidentity, plus her iconography, indicates that she is none other than theTantrik manifestation of the popular deity Sarasvatī, goddess of speech,knowledge, art, learning, and creative inspiration. Actually, to put it moreaccurately, Sarasvatī is the exoteric, non-Tantrik, popular expression of Parā.Unlike Sarasvatī, Parā is venerated as the Supreme Divinity, not as a member ofa pantheon of gods.This points us toward the most unique feature of the Trika’s doctrine andpractice: a complex and beautiful system of linguistic mysticism, whereby thephonemes of human speech (especially Sanskrit, the paradigmatic language) arethought to be concretizations of patterned vibrations of divine energy that arethe foundation for all human thought and, simultaneously, the building blocks ofthe entire manifest universe. That is to say, on this view, the apparentlydualistic division of words and objects (signifier versus signified) isultimately grounded in a single nondual matrix of subtle vibration. That iscalled the Supreme Word, embodied as the Goddess Parā.Parā has two main mantras, one of creation and one of dissolution. The first isthe seed-syllable (bīja-mantra) sauḥ, which sounds very much like a contentedsigh; we might say it expresses the Goddess breathing forth Her revelation. Theother mantra is highly secret; it is a seed-syllable central to the Kālīkula(see sampradāya #7), one of many indications of a special connection between thetwo groups.[image/Saraswati_Lines_Only_POSTER.jpg]SarasvatīThe Trika is the first group we have encountered that initiated women as fullpractitioners. We are now getting into the sects that practiced various forms ofsocial transgression from within society; empowering women to pursue their ownspiritual liberation (instead of accruing merit by proxy from their husband’spractice) was extremely transgressive in traditional Indian society. Indeed, theearliest text of the Trika (the Siddha-yogeśvarī-mata, “Doctrine of thePerfected Yoginīs,” c. 7th century) even specifies that its most powerful mantra(called the yoginī’s heart mantra, identical to the secret saṃhāra-bījamentioned in the previous paragraph) is specially intended for women, havingbeen handed down orally from woman to woman.88[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en88]the vijñāna-bhairava tantraAnother scripture of the Trika, probably the most unusual of all the ŚaivaTantra scriptures of the early period, is called the Vijñāna-bhairava-tantra or“Scripture of the Wisdom-Bhairava.”89[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en89] This text teaches anesoteric form of the Trika in which a practitioner of high adhikāra (aptitudeand qualification) cultivates deceptively simple methods for directly accessingluminous expanded Consciousness—in other words, methods for becoming perfectlycentered in the absolute fullness of the natural state of awareness that resultsfrom dissolving all thought-constructs into their ground. Like nearly allTantrik scriptures, the text takes the form of a dialogue between Śiva andŚakti. It begins with the Goddess asking Bhairava the Big Question:O Lord, I have heard the entire teaching of the Trika that has arisen from ourunion, in scriptures of ever-greater essentiality, but my doubts have not yetdissolved. What is the true nature of Reality, O Lord? Is it...(Vijñāna-bhairava-tantra verses 1–2)and She proceeds to name a variety of esoteric technical terms from the higheryogas taught in the scriptures (verses 2–4). Śakti argues that if Parā is to bevisualized with a particular color and form, then She cannot really be Absolute(para) and entreats Bhairava to clear up the confusion (verses 5–7a). I shouldmention here that in the literary device of the tantras, the Goddess pretendsconfusion or lack of knowledge for our sake, knowing that we are overhearing Herdialogue with Her Beloved. (In the Krama texts, their position is reversed, withŚiva asking the questions.)Bhairava replies,Bravo! Bravo, my dear one. You have asked about the very essence of the Tantra.Know that the forms of the Divine I have taught in the scriptures are not thereal essence, O Goddess. They are like magical dreams, or palaces in the sky,taught only to help focus the meditation of those men who are debilitated bydualistic thought, their minds confused, entangled in the details of ritualaction. In reality God is not... (Vijñāna-bhairava-tantra verses 7–11)and he reiterates the various technical terms she has already introduced. Hegoes on:These were taught to help unenlightened people make progress on the path, like amother uses sweets and threats to tempt her children. Know that in reality, theone pure universe-filling”form” of Bhairava is that absolutely full state called[Goddess] Bhairavī: beyond reckoning in space or time, without direction orlocality, impossible to indicate, ultimately indescribable, a field free ofmental constructs, blissful with the experience of the innermost Self. When thisis the ultimate Reality [para-tattva], who is to be worshipped, who gratified?This experience of the awe-inspiring Absolute is supreme; it is Parā Devī in Herultimate nature. (Vijñāna-bhairava-tantra verses 13–17)It is important to situate this teaching in its proper context. It was notintended as an excuse to shortcut the process of real spiritual work. Rather,being given to an intermediate or advanced practitioner who had already madeefforts in disciplining the mind and attaining clarity of heart throughmeditation and ritual, this teaching would come as a profound revelation,empowering her to begin to focus on what triggers that Bhairavī state in lifeapart from the spiritual practices with which she was already familiar. For thatis the topic of much of the text: though it imparts a number of specific yogicexercises of breath, visualization, and subtle-body awareness (none of whichhave yet been adequately explained by the published translations), it alsofocuses on unconventional techniques for entering into expanded states ofconsciousness. These include:❖ gazing at a blank wall, a vast open space, or the clear blue sky,❖ spinning around and around and falling down,❖ becoming aware of the space between thoughts or between breaths,❖ gazing at the pattern of sunlight on the floor,❖ meditating on the liminal state between waking and sleeping,❖ accessing intensified awareness through pain of a piercing,❖ contemplating that the sky is in your head,❖ just repeating the vowel “a”, and❖ simply sitting and doing “nothing” (nonconceptual meditation).Additionally, there are meditations on pure thoughts, such as simply repeating(and feeling into the vibration of) phrases like “All this is Her play,”“Everything I think I know is a fabrication,” “I am the same as the HighestDivinity,” and “What is inside, is outside; what is outside, is inside.” Some ofthe teachings of this peculiar scripture cannot even truly be called techniques;rather, the text invites us to notice daily-life opportunities for accessingthat expanded state that we might otherwise let slip by:❖ the feeling of wonder from watching a magic show,❖ the aftermath of an orgasm,❖ following desire back to its source,❖ listening to the vibration of live instrumental music or becoming one with thejoyous feeling of a song,❖ the arising of inner delight when savoring fine food and drink,❖ the repetitive gentle motion of a swing or a carriage, and❖ the energy of sharpened and heightened consciousness in any intenseexperience.Actually, there is a subtle technique here, for in all of these experiences, weare to turn our awareness within toward the vibration of a specific feeling, notfocus on an external object as we usually do. You can begin to see how the textpresupposes a strong meditation practice.The text seems to exhibit a strong Buddhist influence, for one of the mostcommon themes is meditating on the “voidness” (śūnya) of things: the inside ofthe body as empty space; the space of the heart; the senses as voids; the wholeuniverse as a pure, open, spacious, expansive void. Yet this is not syncretism,for the scripture maintains throughout a theology of Śiva-Śakti, where Śiva isunbounded spaciousness and Śakti is energy. Either one can be the means ofaccessing the other, for they are inseparable, like fire and its heat (verses18–19). The Śiva practices clarify the energy work; the Śakti practices vitalizethe spacious states. But it is easier for most to access the nonconceptual spaceof Śiva through the energy of Śakti than to go the other way around. TheVijñāna-bhairava frequently stresses that the state it describes is wide-openand free of any mental constructs, even if a mental construct was used to getthere.We have dwelt on this text at some length because, though it is atypical, it isalso seminal, for it laid the groundwork for a “gnostic” version of the Trika,in which traditional ritual could be infused with profound inner meaning, ordispensed with altogether by those (and only by those) who were ready to makeall of life a spiritual practice.Despite its aesthetic appeal and fascination for us, the Trika was not adominant school of the Tantra in its time. Yet Abhinava Gupta made it famous asthe foundation of his Tantrik encyclopedia, Light on the Tantras, such thatteachings from the Trika continued to be cited centuries after the activeworship of its three goddesses had died out, indeed, all the way down to the20th century (the 20th century Kashmīrī guru Lakṣman Jū was a teacher of theTrika’s philosophy, but not its rituals or yoga).Our final sample passage for the Trika comes from its root-text, theMālinī-vijaya-uttara-tantra or “Latter Scripture on the Triumph of the PhoneticGoddess.” It describes the fully liberated and awakened guru who can transmitdirect awareness of one’s essence-nature, listing five signs by which one mayknow such an extraordinary master.The Lord said: One who knows all the Principles of Reality [tattvas] exactly asthey are, is said to be a Guru, equal to Me, revealing the potency of mantras.Those people whom he sees, converses with, or touches, [if he is] pleased withthem, are released from [the karma of] evil deeds of the past seven births. Yetgreater are those living beings who, impelled by Śiva to seek out such a Guru,are initiated by him. Having obtained whatever [they] desire, they then go tothe highest state. The state of being infused with divine Power is alwayspresent in him [the Guru].When that state [of Rudraśakti-samāveśa] is present, the following are the signsthat one may observe. This then is the first sign: steady devotion to God. Thesecond is successful attainment through mantra, giving immediate evidence of itsefficacy. It is said that the third mark is awareness of all the levels ofreality. The fourth sign is the accomplishment of whatever tasks that are begun.The fifth is the ability to spontaneously compose enchanting poetry, and knowingthe essential matters taught in all the scriptures (without having to readthem).

To be clear, we are notspeaking of the later Bengālī version of Kālī, the so-called “goddess ofdestruction” whose image is well known today. The Kālī worshipped by theKālīkula was the all-encompassing Highest Divinity, the ground of being itself,ultimate Consciousness.One of the groups of the Kālīkula rose to prominence and eclipsed all theothers: it was called the Krama, which means “the Process,” “the Cycle,” or “theSequence.”90 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en90] It was sonamed because its initiates worshipped the phases of the cognitive process(whether analyzed as five, twelve, or seventeen) as forms of the Goddess. Thefollowers of the Krama viewed Kālī as the Supreme Divinity whose ultimate natureis formless—the insatiable void in the Heart of Consciousness, which the limitedself cannot enter and survive.91[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en91] The Krama wasunequivocally the most radical, transgressive, feminine-oriented, andnondualistic of all the Śaiva Tantrik groups. It was the Kaula path parexcellence, for unlike the other sampradāyas it had no non-Kaula variant. TheKrama was also (in its post-scriptural phase) the most sophisticated and subtleof them all in terms of its thinking, especially in the careful way itassimilated philosophical ideas with ritual practice, its determined attempt tomake the latter truly meaningful. Thus, the Krama includes some of the mostrefined spiritual thinking in the same sphere as some of the most transgressivepractice, a seeming paradox that fits well in a system that thinks of the Divineas precisely that which can meaningfully subsume all paradoxes within itself.The Krama, despite its serious challenges to the social order, rose to a placeof prominence in Kashmīr, counting many highly placed people (such as royalministers) amongst its initiates. It influenced the Trika, which adopted someKrama doctrines, and the two schools finally became fused in the theology ofAbhinava Gupta, who essentially propagated an esoteric Kaula Trika with a Kramacore.Having said all this about the significance of the Krama, it may come as asurprise to hear that there are no translations of Krama texts and very littlepublished work on the subject. Virtually no one realized the Krama’s historicalsignificance, or the stunning power of its ideas and its poetry, beforeSanderson’s pioneering 2007 study, “The Śaiva Exegesis of Kashmir,” which Iquote frequently in this section. Even Buddhist scholars will (it is hoped) takenote, for the Krama’s teachings are strikingly similar to the most refined formsof Tantrik Buddhism.The documented history of the Krama begins with the story of a devoted spiritualpractitioner and seeker of the Truth, probably from Kashmīr, who in the mid-9thcentury made a pilgrimage to the small kingdom of Uḍḍiyāna, in the far northwestof the Indian cultural region, a site later considered one of the four mostimportant Tantrik centers. (Uḍḍiyāna was located in the extremely beautiful SwātValley, now in the sadly war-torn northwest province of Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistān.Note that this is also said to be the homeland of Padmasambhava, who broughtTantrik Buddhism to Tibet around this same time—probably not a coincidence!)There he journeyed to a town called Mangalapura (Modern Mingora ), in the heartof Uḍḍiyāna, where it is said nearly everyone at that time was a practicingTāntrika. Situated next to the town was a sacred power-center (śakti-pīṭha), thegreat cremation ground called Karavīra. This cremation ground is said to be thedwelling place of the Goddess Maṅgalā (Goodness, Auspiciousness), a benevolentform of Kālī, together with the sixty-four Yoginīs or Tantrik goddesses thatmade up her retinue.There this pilgrim took up residence, propitiating and meditating on the Goddessuntil She revealed Herself to him in an awesome epiphany, granting him divineinsight. Thereafter this siddha (“perfected master”), now called JñānanetraNātha (the Lord of the Eye of Wisdom) became the first guru of the Krama lineageand the transmitter of the principal Krama scriptures. An account in OldKashmīrī says:The Nātha, after being taught in the sacred site where Oṃ resonates [Uḍḍiyāna],was filled with compassion for living beings, and as the Promulgator [he]emitted the internal and external silence of ultimate Reality as the corpus ofthe Krama.92 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en92] (OldKashmīrī Mahānaya-prakāśa)The tradition records that Jñānanetra was a fully awakened master. A later textcalled Hymn to the Five Voids lauds his greatness; it purports to have been anoral transmission from all the yoginīs of Uḍḍiyāna. The yoginīs, in a greatassembly, sang the praises of Jñānanetra with these words:Lord Jñānanetra has merged with the level where all experience is one! He is thesolitary Hero of that beyond essence, in whom all phenomena have been brought tosilence, radiant with the vision of his gnosis, who has realized the ultimateReality, who has attained the bliss of understanding, and who has relished thehighest awakening.93 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en93](Hymn to the Five Voids)Aside from the Krama scriptures, which like all scriptures have no authorialvoice, we have only one work by Jñānanetra, the Kālikā-stotra or “Hymn to theDivine Mother,” a beautiful text that subtly alludes to the phases of Kramaworship. Here we will quote the first three verses and the last two, which havesome autobiographical hints. Jñānanetra exultantly sings his experience of theDivine in these words:O Goddess! Supreme is Your nature, which is formless yet has the form of allthree worlds. It is prior to all limitations, impossible to grasp throughdualistic categories such as “existent” versus “nonexistent,” and attainablethrough the purest Consciousness. || 1 ||Supreme is Your completely pure nondual form: One, yet existing in many guises,pervading the universe that is flowing forth within You yet entirely free fromchange—it is known as the integral nature of Awareness. || 2 ||Supreme too is Your extraordinary act of taking on embodiment—surging up withinthrough Your own pure Will, and expressing the Light of Consciousness in itsunsurpassable and spontaneous essentiality. || 3 ||Through Your grace, O Mother, may the whole world abide as the essence of theGoddess within the transcendent Śiva, just as She was experienced by myself inthe Great Cremation Ground. || 19 ||Thus, this hymn of essence-nature is sung by myself, Śiva, through the force ofthe state of complete immersion [samāveśa]. O Goddess named Maṅgalā(Beneficent), may it be a blessing [śiva] to the whole world that is itselfmyself. || 20 || (Kālikā-stotra: Hymn to the Divine Mother)The full poem and many others by Krama masters will be published (incollaboration with other scholars) under the title Tantric Hymns ofEnlightenment.Jñānanetra began a lineage which successfully preserved the transmission of fullawakening through at least nine generations, a rare feat in the history ofreligion. We can see the success of the transmission in the consistently highlevel of insight, joy, and gratitude in the poems of the Krama masters, whichare positively aflame with awakened consciousness. Jñānanetra directly initiatedseventeen disciples. His three primary disciples were women, including hissuccessor, the siddhā yoginī named Keyūravatī (“she who wears a bracelet”),informally yet respectfully known simply as “the Goddess K.” (The Krama is theonly pre-modern Indian tradition to grant women the full status of Guruhood.)Unfortunately, we have no works from Keyūravatī, though some of the oralteachings of the Krama tradition recorded in Old Kashmīrī may be hers.Her foremost disciple was a fascinating figure named Hrasva Nātha, a.k.a.Vāmana, a.k.a. Vīranātha. Two of his three names indicate that he was extremelyshort of stature, though his charisma apparently more than made up for that. Hewas the minister of war and peace under King Yaśaskara in mid-10th-centuryKashmīr. He wrote a work that has come down to us called The Efflorescence [ofTechniques] for the Arising of One’s Innate Awakening (Svabodhodaya-mañjarī).94[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en94] This exquisitemeditation manual, possibly influenced by the Vijñāna-bhairava, teaches a “newand easy method” (a phrase that characterizes the Krama) for attaining the Blissof Consciousness. Hrasva Nātha clarifies his project while explicitly settinghimself against the earlier yoga of Patañjali, writing:The nature of the mind is unsteady, being inundated by the subliminalimpressions arising from false mental constructs; realizing this, one sets outto dissolve it. This process of dissolution [nirodha] was taught by the ancientsas being due to the yoga of renunciation and repetitive practice. Here I willteach dissolution through the release of effort. (Svabodhodaya-mañjarī)Sanderson writes with his usual precision about Hrasva Nātha’s method asfollows: “[The text offers subtle] practices to bring about liberation-in-lifethrough the dissolution of contracted awareness by means of insight into theemptiness of [all] objective and mental phenomena and reversion into theuncontracted inner ground [of Consciousness] by observing the process of thearising and dying away of cognition, especially where the latter is particularlyintense, as in the perception of the beautiful [or] meditation on the sensationof orgasm.”95[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en95](“Emptiness” here means“lack of separate objective reality.”) To put it simply, like all yogīs, HrasvaNātha acknowledged the need to dissolve the contracted mind in order to be inPresence, but instead of doing so through cultivating distaste for the worldlyexperiences that the mind becomes attached to, his uniquely Tantrik “easymethod” was to allow yourself to become totally absorbed in a beautiful sensualobject that naturally dissolves or fades away. The more complete your absorptionin the object, the more complete the dissolution of mind you would achieve.These verses of the Svabodhodaya-mañjarī may serve as clarifying examples:Whatever captivating sound that comes into one’s hearing [such as a gong orrumbling thunder], one should become one-pointed on it, until, dissolving, themind dissolves with it. . . . One should not think on what has dissolved, [butremain] full of the intensified sense of one’s own being. || 15–16 ||One should cast one’s mind into the point between the navel and the sex organ[i.e., the kanda] at end [of the climax] of good sex;96[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en96] as the bliss oflovemaking dies away, one may become waveless [i.e., the mind becomes still] ina moment. || 38 ||Keep a delicious confection on the tip of your tongue; when the pleasure of theflavor fades away, liberation arises. || 42 || (Svabodhodaya-mañjarī)The text also includes other methods, from hovering on the edge of sleep totrying to find the location of the mind to asking gently and repeatedly, “Who(or what) am I?” For the practitioner who is ready for these methods, they doindeed constitute a far easier path to successful centering in one’s awakenednature. Like the Vijñāna-bhairava, the Svabodhodaya also contains some teachingson esoteric yoga that require extensive training to interpret correctly.Hrasva Nātha’s primary disciple and successor was his nephew Cakrabhānu, adreadlocked Kāpālika who bore the five transgressive marks of the cremationground, such as wearing ornaments of human bone and eating out of a bowl madefrom the top of a human skull. Such practitioners were deliberately provocative,challenging the norms of appearance and conduct in mainstream society. (For thisreason, some of the “reform” Kaulas forbade the Kāpālika observance or thewearing of sect-marks.) An interesting story about Cakrabhānu is found in theold historical records of Kashmīr. It seems that he regularly presided at eventscalled cakra-melāpas or “circle gatherings.” These were lengthy group Kramarituals of an orgiastic character that began with great ritual solemnity andbecame. . . well, pretty wild. As the presiding guru, Cakrabhānu would receive adakṣiṇā or donation from each of the participants. It seems that the kingdisapproved strongly of respectable members of society spending their money onthis sort of event, for he punished Cakrabhānu harshly by branding him on theforehead with the mark of a dog’s foot, a punishment reserved for grand theft.97[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en97] Prevented fromparticipating in his favorite practice, he wrote, “When may I [again] follow thepath of the Devī-kula in the company of proud Heroes at the onset of night, mymind made blissful through dissolution [of contracted thought-forms]?”98[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en98]Before we judge Cakrabhānu as nothing more than a debauched libertine, we shouldknow that he became a highly regarded guru in his own right, initiating eightkey disciples, three of whom became renowned gurus: Īśānī (a female Kāpālika);Prabodha the Ascetic, who headed a lineage of some wonderful writers and poets;and Bhūtirāja, who became the Krama guru of both Abhinava Gupta and his father(see the chart below).[image/gurulineage.jpg]All these earlier Krama masters eventually became so revered that in the latertradition, the teachers of this lineage (up to and including Cakrabhānu’s eightdisciples) were worshipped as the paramparā or succession of masters embodying asingle awakened consciousness. We see this teaching, for example, in theKaula-sūtra’s first three aphorisms:1. There is but one Guru, the unbroken transmission of the rays [of awakenedconsciousness] passed on to us through the initiatory lineage.2. There is but one God: the Reality that they have perceived.3. The singular power of [its] Consciousness is identical with the state oftheir innate self-awareness.99[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en99] (Kaula-sūtra)This teaching that the Guru is not a series of personalities but a powertransmitted through a properly maintained lineage is central to the Krama, andwe can feel something of its truth, for the writings of the Krama masters overthe course of nine generations are imbued with the same flavor—the samenectarean ecstasy wedded to piercing insight.We have one text from Cakrabhānu’s disciple Bhūtirāja, the Attainment of One’sOwn Awareness (Svabodha-siddhi), a sophisticated and well-written philosophicalpoem, from which we here quote:I venerate the supreme Śiva located in the self, who can be known only inself-experience, who is devoid of the mental torment of fixation on any specificdoctrine. I bow to the Benevolent One, the destroyer of the flood of conceptualconstructs, free of the snare of the mind’s imaginings, transcending [even] thelevel of the highest bliss. || 2–3 ||The method of attaining the goal is to be constantly awake to one’s ownawareness. By this means the sage achieves the state free of differentiation.There is no method other than staying with [awareness of] one’s own being.Closely maintaining awareness of this alone, the yogī will become joyful,resting in the self.100 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en100]|| 9–10 || (Svabodha-siddhi)These teachings are clearly influenced by Bhūtirāja’s guru’s guru, Hrasva Nātha.However, Bhūtirāja’s primary historical importance, as we will see later, restson the fact that he initiated Abhinava Gupta into the Krama.Cakrabhānu began three different productive lineages, as the lineage chart aboveshows. Bhūtirāja’s coinitiate, Prabodha the Ascetic, was (to judge from hiswriting) a profoundly realized master. I love these sayings of his:[O Mother,] Whatever form I conceive, however transcendent, is lower than You!Yet nor can I conceive of anything, however low, in which You are not completelypresent! (Prabodha the Ascetic)The verse is clever in that though he does not name Her, we know he is thinkingof Goddess Kālī because of the uncommon verb he uses for “conceive,” √kal, whichis also the root for Kālī’s name.Speaking of the power that remembering the divine has to get us out of our egoicself, Prabodha wrote:By mere remembrance of You, we make into a humble servant this demon called “I”,that thirsts for the blood that is the fortitude of men, ripping them apart withits treacherous fangs called “mine.”101[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en101]Two of Prabodha’s verses are particularly special because they have survived thedemise of Śaiva Tantra in Kashmīr and have been reverently recited all the waydown to the present day. They are probably the only two verses from the entireKrama tradition still preserved amongst a substantial segment of people, thoughtheir author and the Krama itself is long forgotten. They now form theconclusion of the Bahurūpa-garbha-stotra or “Hymn to the Multiform Womb [ofReality],” recited by many Kashmīrī brāhmins down to the present day.You, I praise, the unborn beloved of Śiva in the lotus of my heart, seated indeepest consciousness [on your throne that is] full of the radiance created byall the Causes.You, I praise, who are ever eager to drink the honey-wine exuded by thelotus-maṇḍala in the innermost awareness of all living creatures, hidden withinthe pervasive power that is the variety of phonemes, rending the snare of boundexistence.102 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en102](Bahurūpa-garbha-stotra: Hymn to the Multiform Womb)The next major author from whom we have writings is Nāga, three generationslater, at which point the lineage’s enthusiasm and enlightenment remainundimmed. Nāga is indeed one of the finest Krama poet-sages; for sample verses,see the next section. Nāga’s main disciple was Arṇasiṃha, which leads us intothe discussion of the last phase of the Krama.the mahārtha:the final phase of the kramaAfter the 10th century, the teachings of the Krama were primarily transmittedunder the name of Mahārtha or Mahānaya, “the Great Teaching” or “the GreatWay.”103 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en103] In the 11thand 12th centuries, three texts were composed by different authors on theteachings of the Mahārtha, all with the same title: Illumination of the GreatWay (Mahānaya-prakāśa). All three are masterpieces of spiritual philosophy. Noneof them, unfortunately, exists in an English translation as of yet. The firstIllumination of the Great Way was by a sage called Arṇasiṃha (active c.1050–1075), who was fortunate to receive transmission from two Krama gurus inCakrabhānu’s lineage, one of whom was the poet Nāga. His text explains how thestructure of Krama worship reflects and embodies the core structures ofConsciousness itself (see Appendix 2).The second Illumination is in two parts: the root-text and the commentary. Theroot-text is remarkable because it was not written in Sanskrit but in the commonlanguage of the Kashmīrī people at that time; a Sanskrit commentary by a mannamed Śitikaṇṭha, of unknown lineage, was appended to explain it. The textcontains some unique features, such as detailed instructions on a nine-dayintensive course of training in Krama worship. It also innovates by reading thestructures of worship not only in terms of the natural flow of cognition, butalso mapping them onto the flow of energy within the human body. Here is a briefsample of the text:The body—termed kula, the sacred site, the holy field, the first letter (a), theFive-cluster mantra, and the Praṇava (oṃ)—is the temple of the Self, being thesupport of the awareness, identified with the [pure] I-sense, whose nature isthat it manifests all [that appears to it].104[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en104] (Old KashmīrīIllumination of the Great Way)The third Illumination was anonymously authored. It must have been influential,for though it was written in Kashmīr, the one surviving manuscript we have ofthe text was found in Trivandrum, Kerala, near the southern tip of India. Of allthree, this is the most sophisticated Illumination, and the one that mostclearly shows the influence of Abhinava Gupta, as well as earlier gurus likeUtpala Deva and Hrasva Nātha. The text presents an extremely subtle andsophisticated explanation of Krama worship, presenting it as “embodying aprocess of the unfolding of sudden enlightenment in which Consciousness devoursits own content and subjectivity to burst forth into the mind and senses as atransfigured mundane experience in which the polarity of liberation and bondageis obliterated.”105 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en105] Inother words, in this process of spontaneous realization, Consciousness, as itwere, takes hold of its own strength, realizing that all the concrete elementsof experience are expressions of the One energy that is itself, and thus whatbefore seemed ordinary appears as an extraordinary revelation, and mundane lifebecomes a source of wonder, unveiling its ever-present radiant freedom.The anonymous Illumination also analyzes the process of each and every cognitiveact (whether of an awakened or unawakened person) in terms of the veneration ofits phases as the five Flow Goddesses of the Krama. Finally, it also presents aninnovative take on the relationship between God and Goddess (Śiva and Śakti),whereby the latter is defined as the central core of the former, the absolutecenter-point within Śiva (i.e., Consciousness) that He Himself cannot make anobject of perception, for it is the point of ultimate groundedness from whichall seeing is done. Here is that passage, which I think you’ll agree is quiteextraordinary:The Great Lord’s repose within himself is the highest state of self-awareness.But by the finest of distinctions there shines a state even higher than that.This is the Goddess-ground [devī-dhāma], in which even the Lord cannot see hisway.Being and non-being reach their ground in the Light of Consciousness [prakāśa],and that [reaches its ground] in the aesthetic rapture of awareness [camatkāra]free of all need and requirement, which in turns comes to rest spontaneously inthe limit of the supreme [state of] repose [para-viśrānti], far from the woundsof the impressions made [on the psyche] by judgements of “higher” and “lower.”What we mean by “the Goddess” is that unsurpassable Ground [viśrāntir anuttarā]that remains when it has devoured even the subtlest traces [saṃskāras] of thewounds of these impressions, positive, negative, and both, which can persisteven in the state of repose in the supreme Light of Consciousness.The nature of the Supreme Lord is the self-groundedness [viśrānti] that devourstime [and all forms of limited awareness]. We define the nature of the Goddessto be the point in which That itself comes to rest. Thus though the two SupremeLords [Śiva and Śakti] are one and the same, a subtle experiential differencebetween them has been [here] revealed. || 3.104–111 || (Anonymous, Illuminationof the Great Way)Clearly this passage begs for explanation and exploration. This is, however, thehistory section in which tastes of all the branches of the Tantrik revelationare given and where there is not room to explore any one of them in detail.However, just such an exploration is perfect for live teaching environments,where we can also discuss how these seemingly esoteric teachings are immediatelyrelevant to the unfolding of our spiritual growth.the mahārtha moves southIn the centuries after the peak of Tantrik thought in Kashmīr, the heart of thetradition transferred to the far South of India, Tamiḷ and Keralan country.Nondualist authors there, while not as productive of original thought as theKashmīrīs, became very learned in the literature of the Krama and Trika, as wellas the Kaubjika and Śrīvidyā traditions that we have yet to discuss. We haveseen that one of the Illumination texts was preserved only in Kerala. But thepreservation of the Krama in the deep South can best be seen in the figure ofMaheśvarānanda, a great guru who lived and wrote around 1300 in Chidambaram (thename means “the Sky of Consciousness”), the sacred site that houses the originaltemple to Śiva Naṭarāja, the Lord of the Cosmic Dance. Maheśvarānanda wasinitiated into both the Krama and the Śrīvidyā (at least), receiving instructionfrom a guru whose lineage contained some extremely accomplished masters.One night, after performing his worship of the Goddess, Maheśvarānanda wasdozing in a state of contented intoxication when he had a powerful vision of theGoddess as a mighty yoginī. Maheśvarānanda fumbled to make her an offering, andshe waved her hand dismissively and signaled the number seven with her fingers.By turns gentle and stern, she spoke the ultimate Truth to him in the beautifulliterary language of Māhārāṣṭrī. Upon awakening, we are told, he visited histeacher, who told Maheśvarānanda to write down her transmission as seventyverses in the Māhārāṣṭrī language. He also composed a Sanskrit commentary on theverses. The verses he called The Efflorescence of the Great Teaching(Mahārtha-mañjarī), and his lengthy commentary The Fragrance of. . .(-parimala).The verses of the Efflorescence itself are presented as poetic scripture,obliquely attributed to the Goddess. The Fragrance commentary is morephilosophical and argumentative. In it, he shows a wide command of many dozensof Tantrik sources, and he cites the Kashmīrī masters frequently and reverently.Thus he preserved the tradition, but was not afraid to innovate as well, showingit was still in his time a living tradition. We may consider the Efflorescence,a vigorous and profound work, as the final flowering of the tradition of theMahārtha, and one of the last pieces of truly original writing of nondual ŚaivaTantra. Though it is not yet published in English, scholars are beginning towork on the text.106 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en106]Here are a couple of sample verses:Within the range of Paramaśiva and Earth—which is all ultimately the one Lightof Consciousness [prakāśa]—mutual distinction is nothing other than the heart’sunfolding of its infinite capacity for Self-reflection [vimarśa]. || 12 ||The single fusion of thousands of Powers that can be seen in different ways iscalled Śiva, supremely free, the upsurge of one’s own Heart. || 13 ||(Mahārtha-mañjarī: The Efflorescence of the Great Teaching)It is not surprising that the Krama did not survive, for its liberated ethosrepresented a tremendous challenge to the conservative, patriarchal, xenophobic,and deeply inhibited mainstream brāhminical culture.107[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en107] More than any otherreligious sect in premodern Indian history, the Krama repudiated hierarchiesbased on caste, class, or gender. Furthermore, its frank acceptance of sexualityand inclusion of that and other sensual elements in spiritual practice was atodds with the values of both the brāhmins and their Muslim conquerors, whobrought North India under their sway in the 12th and 13th centuries. Anadditional factor undermining the survival of the Krama and related Kaula groupswas the existence of plentiful false gurus, who used the teachings oftransgressive nondual Tantra as an excuse for sexual exploitation and alcoholicoverindulgence. We have evidence that the Krama responded to this behavior withsarcastic criticism, showing that teachers of this tradition were aware that itsteachings could be quoted accurately by those with no real understanding ofthem:Adopting misconduct they make love to others’ wives, declaring constantly thatit is wrong to impede the inclination of the powers [of consciousness]. They aredeluded in their constant relish of the objects of the senses, saying that thegoddesses of their faculties are [thus] filling the Lord that is consciousnesswith the objects of their enjoyment. (One Hundred Verses on the Unity ofTeaching and Practice)This passage seems significant to me, for it shows us clearly that understandingthe teachings on a mental level does not in any way require a person tounderstand the real inner state that they point to. This difference is preciselywhat makes the Krama an esoteric tradition—it embodies an understanding that,while it can be pointed to, cannot in fact ever be properly conveyed in words.There will always be those who are unable to grasp its real purport, and whoeven doubt there is such a level to be grasped, though they may be able toarticulate well the ideas that point to it.the teachings ofthe krama lineageSince there are not yet any publications for the nonscholar that convey theteachings of the Krama, we will explore them in a brief way here. The explicitgoal of Krama practice was liberation in this life through a radical and abidingawakening of blissfully free, expansively open autonomous awareness. Thisawakening was brought about through one of three methods:❖ direct transmission (saṅkramaṇam),❖ oral instruction (kathanam), and❖ ritual worship with nondual awareness (pūjanam).Direct transmission was thought to consist of an encounter with a fully awakenedMaster in which the disciple’s awareness, ripe for expansion, spontaneouslyfuses with that of the Guru in a moment of revelation that triggers a deepopening, a permanent shift. The Guru’s glance is the most commonly cited exampleof this transmission, though there are other forms as well. This method ofrealization was, of course, considered the rarest and quickest of the three.Second is the method of oral instruction (kathanam), which in the Krama is alsoa kind of transmission of transformative power, in the form of condensedstatements on the nature of ultimate reality called chummās, thought to havebeen revealed in by the divine Yoginīs of Uḍḍiyāna and passed down by the womenof the tradition in the vernacular Kashmīrī language. The way to approach theseesoteric teachings is through intuition rather than intellection, holding theirvibration in awareness until the inner meaning spontaneously unfolds in awordless state of realization. The first four of the chummās are:108[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en108]LINGU ABHIJÑĀNU: The point of fusion is the means of recognition.ARAṆI-SAMUDĀYU: It arises from the [two] kindling sticks.CAKREŚĪ-MELAKU: The goddesses of the circle merge.KĀLA-GRĀSU: Time is devoured. (Chummā-saṅketa-prakāśa)But most chummās are so cryptic that they yield no meaning without someexplanation. When the chummās came to be written down, they received a Sanskritcommentary that explained them. I will give two examples of chummās withcommentary.RAMI EKĀYANU: The One Ground plays.The Sanskrit commentary explains the meaning thus:He who is the One Ground, complete and all-pervading, plays without falling fromhis nature as he performs every action of every kind throughout the universe.109[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en109]We know from context that the One “plays” by taking on every kind of embodimentand subjecting itself to every kind of experience; that is, He enacts the totalrange of possibilities within his being as a divine play. The second chummāreads:MACCĪ UMACCĪ : Wild, then tamed [or: Mad, then free of madness].The commentary explains:Because Consciousness surges up with innate autonomy she becomes reckless,taking on ever-new forms and [then] dissolving them all. She gives no thought towhat is proper or improper, being constantly in motion. But when this same[Goddess Consciousness] is sated, she completely transcends this madness. Whenshe catches sight of the highest Śiva [i.e., the quiescent ground ofconsciousness], he tames her recklessness. For this reason Consciousness, whonever deviates from Her [inner] nature for those blessed [to know Her], has beencalled “mad, then free from madness”.110[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en110]We have an example of a master who attained his realization throughcontemplating these oral teachings: the figure of Śrī Nāga, the disciple of thedisciple of Prabodha the Ascetic, mentioned above. Nāga, from whom we have twotexts of staggering power and beauty, writes with exultant gratitude about whathe received from his guru:By great good fortune I stand today overflowing with the blissful relish[camatkāra] of the nectar of the unlocated Consciousness that surges up from itsunbound stainless ground. I am astonished by the fruition of the instruction inthe inexpressible practice that I obtained from the heart of my sadguru’s oralteaching.111 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en111] (Nāga’sThirty Verses on Contentment of Mind)As we will see when we come to the section on practice (part 3), this method ofkathanam, relying exclusively on accessing the vibrational essence of powerfulspiritual teachings, corresponds to Abhinava Gupta’s category of the śākta-upāyaor the Empowered Means.The third category of Krama practice, then, is pūjanam or worship. The Kramacarefully set itself apart from other Tantrik systems by creating a system ofritual worship that expressed its philosophical and metaphysical stance on thenature of Consciousness. Thus the worshipper makes offerings to goddesses thatembody the powers of his or her own body, senses, mind, and awareness. Thepractitioner is required to understand the inner significance of ritual actionthat it may blossom into full nondual awareness—a requirement not found in theother Tantrik schools. In this way, the nature of Consciousness is unveiledthrough a meditation-in-action on the cyclical flow of cognition.The structure of Krama ritual worship is complex, but for those who want to knowthe details of how the sequence of worship of circuits of arcane goddesses—onthe subtle level, vortex wheels of pulsating energies—map the flow of thearising and subsiding of every cognitive event whatsoever, appendix 2 provides asummary of that map.the teaching of the manuscriptThe final Krama teaching that we will examine is the Teaching of the Manuscript.We find in the Krama an interesting tension regarding the role of knowledge andlearning in the spiritual life. On the one hand, the Krama is a very textuallyproductive lineage, with many scriptures, hymns, poems, and commentaries; on theother hand, its masters warn us repeatedly about the “snare of learning” and thedanger of getting lost in mere intellectual understanding of the doctrine. Thesymbol of the manuscript is a central one, yet the recurrent theme is one of“breaking open the boards” of the manuscript to reveal the transmentalexperiential reality that exists between the polarities that the two boardsrepresent. (Sanskrit manuscripts consist of sheaves of palm leaf or birch barkprotected by two wooden boards and bound by two cords.)We see this theme in the frame story of the text of the aphoristic chummāsmentioned earlier. The author of the commentary on the chummās, NiṣkriyānandaNātha, claims to have received them in a visionary transmission from oneSiddhanātha. The impactful glance of this guru gives Niṣkriya an overwhelmingexperience of essence-nature beyond the mind, beyond time and space, even beyondBliss. When Niṣkriya recovers, he asks how this awakening may become an abidingone, and Siddhanātha (who never speaks) casts a glance into the depths of thesky. Through its power, the Supreme Word (parā vāk) that is one with Śiva,Bhairavī Herself, emerges from the highest space. She is said to be theembodiment of fusion with the lights of extraordinary Consciousness. She says toNiṣkriya,Why are you so proud? What is [the value of] this snare of learning? Still youhave not shaken off your delusion. Behold this manuscript in the hand ofSiddhanātha. O you who have mastered the Krama, know that its tightly boundfive-hood [knot] is the power embodied in the five sense-faculties and that itstwo encircling rings are waking and dreaming. Learn in brief the nature of theseits two boards. (Chummā-saṅketa-prakāśa) (Translation Sanderson)She then gives the teaching of the two boards, which represent two apparentlyopposite aspects of the Goddess:Upper boardLower boardoutgoing breathingoing breathimmanencetranscendenceimmersion into extroversive expansionimmersion into introversive expansionall-encompassing Fullnessall-devouring Emptinessfull-figured sweet Goddessemaciated fierce GoddessShe then commands Niṣkriya: “Break open the two boards and behold the greatspaciousness beyond the void!” This spaciousness is the convergence of all theabove polarities, the paradoxical superposition of both aspects of divinity. Itis said to be unlocatable, free of both the transient and the eternal,unmanifest yet always present in everything, the devourer of Time and itsprocesses: and it has as its sphere one’s very own Self. It is youressence-nature (svasvarūpa).As a result of this teaching, Niṣkriya experienced directly the ultimate Realityand went forever beyond the snare of knowledge. Siddhanātha, filled with lovingcompassion, then bestowed on him the teaching of the chummās, that is “hard tounderstand for even the greatest of yogīs.” As a result, Niṣkriyānanda Nāthabecame a fully Awakened One (suprabuddha).112[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en112][image/Kubjika_FINAL.jpg] Kubjikā with Navātma-bhairava"},{"pageContent":"SAMPRADĀYA 8:kaubjika [image/kaubjika.gif]Deity: Kubjikā (the Crooked Goddess)Visualization: dark blue, twelve-armed, and six-faced, including the faces ofParā, Kālī, and TripurāMantra: AIṂ HRĪṂ ŚRĪṂ PHREṂ HSAUṂPrincipal texts: Kubjikā-mata-tantra; Manthāna-bhairava-tantraThe Kaubjika tradition is named for the Goddess Kubjikā, a complex figure whoincorporates features of earlier Tantrik deities. Like Svacchanda-bhairava, sheis simultaneously fiercely intense and sweetly benevolent.113[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en113] She is sometimes viewedas an emanation of Parā, connecting her with the Trika sampradāya, and indeedmuch of the root-text of the Kaubjika is adapted from the scriptures of theTrika. On the other hand, one of Kubjikā’s emanations is that of Tripurā,connecting her closely with the Śrīvidyā sampradāya discussed next. For modernpractitioners the primary significance of Kubjikā’s tradition lies in the factthat her scriptures are the main source for the theory and practice ofkuṇḍalinī-yoga114 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en114](including its six-cakra system) which later appeared in the texts of haṭha-yogaas well as through oral transmission all the way down to the present day. Moreon this soon.Kubjikā’s myth of origin is sufficiently interesting to be summarized here,drawing on the Kubjikā-mata-tantra. Once upon a time (before Time), Bhairava,the awe-inspiring form of Śiva, visited the residence of the god of theHimālaya, where he meets the Daughter of the Mountain, usually called Pārvatībut here named as Kālikā (Little Kālī). Quite taken with her, Bhairava gives hera vision of the universe blazing with the bliss of the Empowering Transmission(ājñā, a key term of this sect), a vision that profoundly awakens her. He tellsher she must attain her essence-nature beyond all qualities, and then hedisappears. She is confused and disoriented (as are many after their initialawakening) and in a state of wonder asks, “Who are you, and what am I doing?”After deliberation, she travels to the Mountain of the Moon in the West to lookfor Bhairava. Here, in a paradise filled with all manner of exquisitelybeautiful birds, bees, and flowering plants, where the power of passionate loveresides, she comes upon a magical stone. She mounts the stone and enters a yogictrance, having received the energy of the Empowering Transmission. She becomesthe “female liṅga,” a fusion of masculine and feminine principles. In this formshe is independently blissful and is thus sometimes depicted as doubled over andlicking her own vulva, which is one reason she is called “the Hunchback”(kubjikā). This is symbolic not of narcissism but of the introversiveself-savoring of the divine Absolute when it experiences the fullness of itsbeing, inclusive of all polarities. Bhairava appears and praises her in thisandrogynous form of the female liṅga, thereby arousing the goddess from herintroverted contemplation, and she bursts forth into the form in which she isworshipped, said to be “beautiful and ugly and multifaceted.” Bhairava asks herfor the Empowering Transmission (signalling that she is now in the dominantrole), and she bends over with embarrassment, for she knows it must be giventhrough conjugal union: that she must actualize in the external world herinternal realization. This posture of bending over in embarrassment is anothermythological explanation for her name. Ultimately, though, the explanation ofkubjikā that would become dominant is that she is a personification ofkuṇḍalinī, the “coiled power,” the liberative and integrative goddess-power thatexists, usually in a partly dormant state, in all embodied sentient beings.115[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en115]The union of Śiva and Śakti (in their sexual embodied essence) gives rise to theimmortal Point of Ultimacy, a singularity “blazing with the light of ten millionsuns.”116 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en116] The explosionof this Point through the Goddess’s empowering command (ājñā) generates theuniverse in a series of emanations. (I need hardly bring up the parallel withthe Big Bang theory of modern physics.) But we should note that in the Kaubjikatradition, there is a higher Divinity than the sexually conjoined pair of Śivaand Śakti, and this is the point of their absolute fusion: the Power of Blisscalled the Neuter, which is the potential, unmanifest state, the timeless Voidof Consciousness, which is what exists “before” the manifestation of the Point,and “after” it, and pervades the universe that manifests out of it.In the first stage of the emanation of the Point (the first microsecond oftime), it expands out into the triangular generative yoni, its three points thepowers of Willing, Knowing, and Acting. (This is the same pattern seen in theŚrīvidyā as well: see the next sampradāya.) We do not have space in thisoverview to explore the successive stages.In the following sample passage, we have a clear example of the influence of theKrama on the Kaubjika, since we see specific Krama technical terms being used.Here Kubjikā is, like Kālī, the seemingly terrifying radiant Void underlying allthings that awakens the aspirant to reality, after which he sees all form as anexpression of the imperishable formlessness. This Void is paradoxicallyexperienced as flowing even as it is the place of supreme rest.In the Center is the ground of perfect repose [viśrānti]; it is the experienceof flowing Presence, the realization of which constitutes one’s own spiritualauthority [adhikāra].The power of bliss is melted between the exhale and the inhale; in the center ofthe staff of space [i.e., the central channel], She pervades the energy ofconsciousness of the individual soul. The limbs of her slender [i.e.,transcendent] body are variegated by time and tide; dissolved in the levelbeyond bliss, imperishable and terrifying, She awakens one to reality.(Manthāna-bhairava-tantra)We will close this section with an important historical note based on newresearch. There is some evidence that Kubjikā’s tradition arose in the westernHimālayas in the late 10th century, but if so, its base soon moved to the cityof Candrapura (modern Chandor) in the kingdom of Konkana (modern Goa), fromwhich locale it was transmitted to the far South. In the South, an alternateform of the Kaubjika flourished, called the Śāmbhavānanda lineage, in whichworship of Kubjikā’s partner Navātma-śiva (or the worship of them as a couple)prevailed. The Śāmbhavānanda lineage was syncretistic in that it incorporatedthe Śrīvidyā worship of Tripurā as well (see the discussion that follows). TheŚāmbhavānanda is of crucial significance for the history of yoga because it is aprobable source for the haṭha-yoga system that came after the decline ofclassical Tantra. Recent scholarship has been done on a scripture that istransitional between Tantra and haṭha-yoga, a 13th-century text called theCompendium of Matsyendra that is associated with the Śāmbhavānanda lineage.117[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en117]We see evidence for the connection of the Śāmbhavānanda with early haṭha-yoga inthe archaeological site of the caves of Panhāle-Kājī (originally Praṇālaka),found in the Sindhudurg district of Mahārāṣṭra, just north of Goa. In thesecaves, also dated to the 13th century, we find a wealth of images of the Nāthas,a lineage that, as we shall see, was the primary holder of the haṭha-yogatradition in its first few centuries. Cave 29 contains images of eighty-fourNātha siddhas. The caves, which also contain images of Tripurā, are located nearthe heartland of the Kaubjika sect in Goa. These caves may be the site describedin the Compendium of Matsyendra as the place where Gorakṣa, after wanderingaround India in search of his teacher Matsyendra Nātha118[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en118] (whom he had brieflymet in the Tamil country), finally found him and received his initiation.Scholar Mark Dyczkowski has recently published a twelve-volume study on theManthāna-bhairava-tantra, an 11th-century scripture of the Kaubjika sampradāya.We can only hope that this will draw the attention of scholars and laypeople andthat, as a result, more people will realize that the elements of kuṇḍalinī-yogaso popular in the West (e.g., the widely known cakra system) derive directlyfrom Śaiva Tantra. This would benefit everyone because the tradition is vast andthe scholars working with the original sources are few, and there is so muchmore to be done.[image/Sundari.jpg] Lalitā Tripurasundarī"},{"pageContent":"SAMPRADĀYA 9:srividya [image/srividya.gif]Deity: Tripurasundarī, a.k.a.

This theme comes to its fruition in the ninth and lastsampradāya of classical Śaiva Tantra, known as the Traipura and better known asŚrī-vidyā, which means both “Auspicious Wisdom” and “the Sacred Goddess Mantra.”The Goddess is here pictured as the young and beautiful Lalitā (the Coquette,the Playful One) or Kāmeśvarī (the Goddess of Erotic Desire), Her skin the redcolor of passion. She is pictured seated atop the meditating Śiva prostrate inśavāsana, signalling that in this sect the embodied experience of passionatedesire trumps the quiescent introversive meditative state, though that is stillpresent as the ultimate ground of “pure” desire (that is, desire that arises asa spontaneous expression of embodied Consciousness instead of fromconditioning). From the perspective of the Śrī-vidyā, desire (icchā) is themotive force of the universe, since without it nothing would arise and divineConsciousness would remain static. The work of the spiritual practitioner, then,is to first release her judgments concerning her own desires, judgments thatcause a contraction of Consciousness, and secondly to merge her limited desireinto the greater pattern of divine Will. This does not mean giving up desire butrather learning to want passionately what the Goddess wants, which necessitatesbecoming one with Her. What the Goddess wants is simply to flow in relationalpatterns of ever-greater harmony, and we naturally fall into that dance when ourconditioned desires that arise from a false sense of lack have fallen away. Butthis cannot happen as long as we are judging or condemning them instead ofseeing that they are the same energy as divine Will constrained by our ignorancefrom expressing themselves in maximum harmony.The Śrīvidyā arose out of an older cult of love-magic (called the Nityā cult),which sought to develop rituals to secure the affections of a prospective sexualpartner.119 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en119] Under theinfluence of the Tantrik movement, this rapidly developed into a full-blown pathto liberation through worshipping the beautiful feminine radiance (Śrī) thatembodies the very nectar of human life. It is Śrī that brings beauty and goodfortune to any home, vivifying the otherwise static patterns of inertia that themasculine otherwise falls into. In time, the Śrīvidyā developed rituals ofworshipping Śrī as a young girl (kumārī) and as a fertile married woman (strī),the source of auspiciousness. The last to develop, the Śrīvidyā is also the onlysect of original Śaiva Tantra to survive intact to the present day, though thecost of doing so was the loss of its independence, it being assimilated and“sanitized” by the conservative brāhmins of the Tamiḷ South and practiced todayexclusively by them. It nonetheless kept some of its doctrines and many of itsrituals intact (though the transgressive elements were excised). The Śrīvidyāentered into the non-Tantrik Vedānta tradition and “tantricized” it to theextent that the highest authorities of Vedānta in the South began practicing theworship of the Śrī Yantra, and still do so today.120[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en120]The most salient feature of the Śrīvidyā is the threefold form of its centralgoddess, Tripurā or Tripura-sundarī (Beautiful in the Form of the ThreeCitadels). The first of the three “citadels” is her coarse (sthūla) form, thatis, her iconographic depiction as a sixteen-year-old woman just come into hersexual power, bare-breasted or (in the later tradition) wearing a red sārī,symbolic of passion. Tripurā’s second, subtle (sūkṣma) form is that of the ŚrīCakra or Śrī Yantra, the most popularly known mystic diagram of the Tantriktradition (see the illustration below).[image/sri-lines.jpg]This yantra (= diagram for working with the energies of life) is also a cakra (=circuit of deities) depicting the sequences of the emanation of reality from acentral Point of Ultimacy (bindu), which contains them all in unmanifest form.In other words, when you look at the Śrī Cakra, you are seeing the energies ofcreation pulsing out from the singularity at the center. This map also enablesus to trace our way back to the source, finding the point of maximumcenteredness from which all the energies of creation (and resorption) areexperienced as pulsing out from (and returning to) one’s own Self, the radiantHeart of Consciousness. Thus the Śrī Cakra is simultaneously a dynamic map ofreality, a substrate for ritual, and a focal point for meditation.The third and most subtle (ati-sūkṣma) form of this Goddess is Her mantra, givenabove. Because it has sixteen syllables, She is also known as Ṣoḍaśī, whichmeans “sixteen.” Tripurā’s mantra itself subdivides into three parts, which eachexpress one of three goddesses, whose combined essences make up Tripurā (notethe strong structural parallel with the Trika). Not counting oṃ, the first fivesyllables are said to express the Power of Insight (jñāna-śakti), are associatedwith Vāgīśvarī (= Parā-vāk), and bring about liberation; the second five expressthe Power of Action (kriyā-śakti), are associated with Kāmeśvarī, and bringabout the attainment of one’s romantic and sexual desires; and the third set offive express the Power of the Will or Creative Urge (icchā-śakti), are alsoassociated with Parā, and remove obstacles. It is the second of these threeaspects that is most prominent in the root-text of this sect.The Śrīvidyā became very successful and widespread throughout India, fromKāshmīr to Tamiḷ Nāḍu, though it survives today only in the latter region. Itwas more attractive to some royal patrons than other Tantrik sects, partiallybecause it focused on enhancing the pleasures of life, not the cremation groundimagery focused on conquering death. The Śrīvidyā came to eclipse the traditionsthat nurtured its development, the Trika and the Kubjikā sects. The Trikaflourished for a time in the South side by side with the Śrīvidyā, and when iteventually disappeared, it nonetheless survived there through the incorporationof the principle mantra of Parā-devī (sauḥ) into the core of the Śrīvidyāliturgy. The Trika Goddess Parā was preserved as the heart-mantra of Tripurā.This is appropriate, given the profound influence of the Trika’s doctrine,practice, and philosophy on the Śrīvidyā.In the following brief sample passage from The Heart of the Yoginī(Yoginī-hṛdaya), we see in play some of the ideas I’ve just hinted at. Here, theCakra refers both to the mystic diagram and the manifest universe that itrepresents. As in the Kaubjika teaching given in the previous discussion(remember the strong connection between these two schools in some areas), theuniverse is born when the infinite Void of Consciousness manifests as the Point,the all-containing singularity from which everything flows forth. This Void isnot of course a void of empty space, but rather is analogized to an ocean oflight (Śiva), through which undulate waves of pulsation (Śakti). When thisConsciousness recognizes itself (using metaphor to point to something beyondwords), the Point bursts forth in waves of emanation, beginning with thethreefold Goddess who is icchā, jñāna, and kriyā as well as knower, knowing, andknown.When one perceives the Supreme Power—who assumes the form of the whole ofreality by Her own free will—as the pulsating radiance of one’s own Self, thenthe Cakra arises from the Point of Ultimacy, the vibrating Consciousness, thestate of Absolute Potential in the form of the Void. Because that ultimatereality is the Light of Consciousness, and because it is wedded to the waves ofpulsation, the foundation of the waves of manifest reality flows forth: theTriad of Mothers [i.e., the tripartite Śrīvidyā mantra and the three mainPowers]. . . . This great bindu-born Cakra of nine yonis and many mantras isreplete with the Bliss of Consciousness. (The Heart of the Yoginī)the structure of the śaiva canonHaving examined the nine sampradāyas, we may consider briefly their relationshipto one another. For, though they were presented as nine separate traditions,they are in fact all part of one whole. There is plenty of evidence to suggestthat the adherents of Śaiva Tantra saw the tradition in this way. The primarysuch evidence is the teaching that the entire body of Tantrik scriptures is tobe seen as a single complex utterance, a vast interrelated patterning ofConsciousness flowing forth from the five faces of the one Śiva.The canon is gradated into a kind of hierarchy of revelation. The followingdiagram, adapted from Sanderson’s pioneering 1988 study, illustrates thishierarchy. It preserves the left/right distinction we have addressed earlierwhile also presenting a vertical axis.[image/canon.jpg]To reiterate, the further to the left, the more transgressive, goddess-oriented,and nondualist a group tends to be. On the vertical axis, whatever is lower downis a more general revelation, whose scriptures are considered universally validexcept where superseded by the instructions of a group higher up. (Thus, asnoted above, the Siddhānta is seen as the lowest in the sense of being the base,for it is the most universal in its prescriptions, at least in the domain ofpractice.)Here we see that the most basic division of the tradition (at the bottom) isbetween the Siddhānta-tantras and the Bhairava-tantras. The latter subdividesagain, one of its three divisions being the Vidyā-pīṭha (Throne ofWisdom-goddess-mantras), a designation for the branch of the tradition in whichthe divine feminine is predominant. This subdivides into three of the groupsdescribed above. The Kaubjika and Traipura sampradāyas are not included here,because they are later, because they don’t fit neatly into these axes, andbecause we are presenting the hierarchy from Abhinava Gupta’s point of view, formore than anyone he articulated the theology of scripture for the Tantriktradition. Quite beautiful and complex mystical teachings on the Śaiva hierarchyof revelation as the natural embodiment of God’s self-awareness are given in hisMālinī-vijaya-vārttika, published as Abhinavagupta’s Philosophy of Revelation.kashmir shaivismthe refinement of the tradition in its post-scriptural phaseWe have already alluded to the fact that while Śaiva Tantra was pan-Indian, itparticularly flourished in the valley of Kashmīr to the far north. Kashmīr is onthe border of the geographical regions of Central Asia and South Asia, and wasclose to the routes of the Silk Road, and thus enjoyed a kind of cosmopolitanmulticulturalism not seen in the Indian subcontinent. The Kashmīr Valley isprotected by mountains on three sides, creating a perfect site for the capitalof the little kingdom. This ancient city, situated by a large lake, was (andstill is) named Śrīnagar (the Blessed City, the Goddess’ City). This exquisitelybeautiful site was called the tilak (sacred forehead mark) of Mother India. Allthe Indian religions flourished there, especially the Śaiva, Śākta, Bauddha,Vaiṣṇava, and Saura traditions—that is, those devoted to the teachings of Śiva,Śakti, the Buddha, Viṣṇu, and Sūrya (the Sun-god) respectively. Furthermore, thekings of Kashmīr in the early Middle Ages were patrons of philosophy and thearts, allowing for the development of sophisticated philosophical schools sideby side with a flourishing literary tradition of plays, ornate poetry, wittysocial satire, and carefully thought-out aesthetic theories.It was in this environment that a crucially important post-scriptural orexegetical phase of Śaiva Tantra developed, a phase that would eventually makeits influence felt all the way down to the tip of the subcontinent. “Exegesis”means explanation and interpretation of scriptural materials. So here we arebroadly contrasting two chronologically successive and distinct phases of theŚaiva Tantrik tradition. The first is that of the nine sampradāyas detailedabove, as revealed in anonymously written scriptures that claimed to be spokenby Śiva Himself (or, in the case of the Krama, Śakti Herself). These texts wereoften mysterious, elliptically worded, and focused on practice rather thanphilosophy. The second phase, then, consists of texts authored by namedindividuals, often highly educated people, who composed in a very differentstyle of Sanskrit. Though their works were intended to explain the scriptures,either they are highly philosophical or they present a sophisticated theology.These authors show knowledge of the prevalent pan-Indian theories of knowledgeand logic. Their arguments concerning the nature of reality are built on threelevels: through reason, through appeal to the scriptures, and through appeal topersonal experience. These three methods of discourse corresponded to threespheres of discourse: the first method could be used in debate with Buddhistsand other non-Śaivas, the second in debate with Śaivas of schools other thanthat of the author, and all three in instruction of the author’s own disciples.We are now concerned with the second phase, the exegetical writings of the ŚaivaTantrik masters from Kashmīr. It is this body of literature that has been called“Kashmīr Shaivism” since the early 20th century and taught in the West underthat name but entirely disassociated from the full context of Śaiva Tantra andits scriptures, which have just been outlined in detail. This happened because,though much of the Tantrik tradition had been forgetten, in the early 20thcentury some scholars started reading the philosophical texts in isolation fromtheir context and published on them in English, coining the phrase KashmīrShaivism in the process. These publications, which continued sporadicallythrough the rest of the 20th century, showed little to no knowledge of thepowerful practices of the tradition. Even today, there are still no accuratetranslations of the original Sanskrit sources on kuṇḍalinī and the subtle-bodypractices so crucial to the classical tradition. Furthermore, 20th centurywritings on Śaiva philosophy often present it as rarefied and esotericspeculation on the ultimate nature of Reality little connected to “real life.”And yet the primary concern of the original Tantrik authors was to give anaccounting of how Consciousness creates the reality of our moment-to-momentexperience of life.To return to our main topic: the ancient exegetical writers of Kashmīr, inspiredby the scriptures, created coherent and elegant systems of thought not found inthe earlier period. This spiritual thinking, it should be emphasized, was neverdivorced from practice, even at its most esoteric. We will now briefly reviewthe key lineages of the exegetical period (900–1050 CE).In the 9th century, the Trika and the Krama rose to prominence in Kashmīr, notamong the masses, but in a circle of individuals with connections to the royalcourt. These two sampradāyas counted amongst their initiates extremely learnedindividuals, even geniuses. They composed works that gave these two groups muchgreater philosophical sophistication and respectability. More importantly,several of these authors were, according to the tradition, fully liberated andawakened spiritual masters, whose words vibrate with the full power of theirattainment, giving us the most direct insight into the nature of realitypossible through words. Therefore, their writings came in time to be revered asequivalent to scripture.121[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en121]the spanda lineageThe masters of the Spanda (Vibration) lineage drew on both the Trika and theKrama in the composition of their works, furthering a synthesis that had begunin the scriptures themselves. The first and most original of these masterphilosophers was Vasugupta (c. 825–875 CE). He revealed the text known as TheAphorisms of Śiva (Śiva-sūtra). The unusual innovation of this text, whichcannot be easily tied to any known school of Śaiva Tantra, was explained througha story related several generations later by Kṣemarāja:Once the Supreme Lord, desiring to benefit mankind by preventing the esoterictradition [of nonduality] from dying out in a society that was almost completelypermeated by the dualistic doctrine, graced Vasugupta in a dream and revealed tohim that there was an esoteric teaching [written] on a huge rock on thatmountain [Mt. Mahādeva] and that he was to learn it and reveal it to thosecapable of receiving grace. When he awoke, he looked for that great stone and,turning it over by a mere touch of his hand, saw that it confirmed his dream. Hethen acquired from it these Aphorisms of Śiva, which are the epitome of thesecret teachings of Śiva.122[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en122] (Śiva-sūtra-vimarśinī:Reflection on the Aphorisms of Śiva)This story was intended to elevate the Śiva-sūtra to the status of scripture. Itis also reported by multiple sources that the Śiva-sūtra is based on otherwiseunrecorded oral teachings from numerous male and female adepts of the Tantra(siddhas and yoginīs) from whom Vasugupta received transmission.Much of the Śiva-sūtra is very difficult to understand, and the commentaries wehave are from six generations later, though their value is enhanced by the factthat the lineage was unbroken throughout that time. Here is a small sample fromthe text, sūtras 6–11 out of 77 total:6. When one absorbs the circle of Powers, the universe is withdrawn.7. [Then] arises the expansion of the Fourth into the divisions of the wakingstate, dream, and deep sleep.8. The “waking state” is cognitive activity.9. “Dream” means mental constructs.10. “Deep sleep” means non-discernment, concealment.11. One who experiences these three [as the Fourth] is the Lord of Heroes, [theembodied form of the Divine]. (Śiva-sūtra: the Aphorisms of Śiva)The Śiva-sūtra received two important commentaries, by Bhāskara and Kṣemarāja,six and seven generations after Vasugupta respectively.123[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en123]Vasugupta’s disciple was named Kallaṭa (c. 850–900 CE). His great work is theStanzas on Vibration (Spanda-kārikās). In it, he expanded on his Guru’steachings and added to them, drawing more on texts of the Kālīkula, though theStanzas also maintained a sect-neutral—but clearly nondualistic—philosophicalstance. The central concept of this work of great beauty and spiritual power isthat God is nothing but the vibrant pulsation of Consciousness, moving throughsuccessive phases of expansion and contraction. The Stanzas received no fewerthan seven commentaries, one by the author himself and two others of note byKṣemarāja and Rājānaka Rāma, a disciple of Utpala Deva (of whom more will besaid).the pratyabhijñā lineageApproximately two generations after Kallaṭa, another lineage was born, this oneconsisting of masters initiated into the Trika but again writing in a languagethat transcended sectarian boundaries. Its first guru was Somānanda (c.900–950), who wrote The Vision of Śiva (Śiva-dṛṣṭi). In the first verse of thiswork, he implies that his ability to author it arose from a state of onenesswith the Divine. Usually the author of a spiritual treatise begins with a homageto God, to invoke divine blessings and remove obstacles to the completion of thework. But since Somānanda felt no separation between himself and God, he prayedrather that the Divine should simply honor itself through him (after warding offany obstacles, that as a nondualist, he also saw as being nothing but God):asmad-rūpa-samāviṣṭaḥ svātmanātma-nivāraṇeśivaḥ karotu nijayā namaḥ śaktyā tatātmane || 1.1 ||May Śiva, who has completely permeated my embodied form, himself ward off [theobstacles which are] himself, and by his own Power [śakti] bow to his greaterSelf. (The Vision of Śiva)Lest we regard this unusual invocation as a sign of the author’s delusions ofgrandeur, Somānanda goes on in the second verse to teach that the Divineconstitutes the essential identity of all beings, and that all forms ofmanifestation and dynamic change are expressions of His powers:The Lord Śiva of contented awareness is the very Self vibrating in all things,His will flowing freely and His knowledge and action expanding everywhere. ||1.2 ||Somānanda here alludes to the six principal Powers of the Divine: Awareness(cit-śakti), Bliss (ānanda-śakti) Autonomy (svātantrya-śakti), Will(icchā-śakti), Knowledge (jñāna-śakti), and Action (kriyā-śakti), which are theprincipal powers of the embodied being as well.Somānanda’s disciple was the great siddha master Utpala Deva (c. 925–975), whosimultaneously possessed one of the greatest intellects and one of the mostpassionately devotional hearts in the whole documented history of nondual ŚaivaTantra. Utpala wrote many works, but is best known and remembered for tworemarkable books. The first of these is the Stanzas on the Recognition of[Oneself as] the Lord or Īśvara-pratyabhijñā-kārikās.It is from this work that the Pratyabhijñā or “Recognition” school gets itsname. It is a dense, intellectually challenging, richly philosophical work thatalso includes some remarkable mystical passages in its last quarter. One suchverse shows Utpala’s indebtedness to the teaching of his Guru:There is only one Great Divinity, and it is the very inner Self of allcreatures. It embodies itself as all things, full of unbroken awareness of threekinds: “I”, “this”, and “I am this.” (The Recognition of the Lord)A number of commentaries on the Stanzas on Recognition have survived, attestingto its importance.Utpala also authored a great number of devotional hymns and verses, which werelater collected as the Garland of Hymns to Śiva (Śiva-stotrāvalī). Theseextraordinary verses show that awakened beings like Utpala are multifaceted andcannot be easily pigeonholed. For while the Stanzas on Recognition shows us atowering intellect with a profound grasp of the most subtle and complexphilosophical issues of his time, the Garland shows us a heart overflowing withlove, longing, and devotion. Without becoming overly autobiographical, the hymnsdepict Utpala’s feelings and experiences with an intimacy unusual for a Sanskritwriter. We see Utpala in a variety of modes in the hymns: anguished andself-doubting, full of sweet longing, exultant with the ecstatic experience ofthe Divine, confused as to how to recapture it, and blissfully awakened to thepresence of his Lord in himself and all the situations of his everyday life. Letus quote a few verses here to capture something of the flavor of the work,verses that beautifully express the Tantra’s unique vision of spirituality inthe world:May I aspire to liberation by worshipping You, without withdrawing fromexperience and the world, and without even seeking dominion, but becomingintoxicated with the abundant liquor of devotion. || 15.4 ||Dwelling in the midst of the sea of supreme nectar, with my heart-mind immersedsolely in the worship of You, may I attend to all the common occupations of man,savoring the ineffable in every thing. || 18.13 ||Making Yourself radiantly manifest, You make all things unfold; contemplatingYour own form, You contemplate the universe. As You whirl in intoxication withthe juice of the aesthetic rapture of Your own nature, the entire circle ofexistent things dances/radiates forth into manifestation. || 13.15 ||(Śiva-stotrāvalī: Garland of Hymns to Śiva)Utpala’s disciple was Lakṣmaṇa Gupta, whose writings, if any, have not survived.The latter’s disciple was the great Abhinava Gupta, the most prolific author ofthe lineage. We will return to him in detail, for he was the inheritor ofseveral lineages; here we will just note that he highlighted the importance ofUtpala’s Stanzas on Recognition by writing not one but two major commentaries onthat work. His second and longer commentary, running to several volumes in theoriginal Sanskrit, was probably his last work (completed, he tells us, on a darkDecember night in the year 1015). It is a masterwork, and the only book of histhat can rival his Tantrāloka.Abhinava Gupta’s disciple Kṣemarāja was nearly as prolific as his teacher,writing commentaries from a nondual perspective on the major Śaiva scriptures ofthe time as well as a number of independent works. While not quite as brilliantor charismatic as his teacher, Kṣemarāja did great service to the Pratyabhijñālineage by writing a short work—twenty sūtras plus his own commentary—thatclearly and beautifully summarized the Recognition teachings, as he put it, forreaders who are spiritually inclined but not trained in the rigorous disciplineof logical philosophy. This is the Pratyabhijñā-hṛdayam or The Heart of theDoctrine of Recognition. It accomplished its goal admirably, for this textcontinued to be taught by Kashmīrī Śaiva masters nearly down to the presentday.124 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en124] Here are just afew sūtras to get a taste of the teachings of this great work:Awareness, free and independent, is the cause of the performance of everything.|| 1 ||She unfolds the universe through Her own will and on Her own canvas. || 2 ||It becomes diverse by its division into mutually adapting subjects and objects.|| 3 ||The individual conscious being, as a condensation of universal Awareness,embodies the entire universe in a microcosmic form. || 4 ||(Pratyabhijñā-hṛdayam: The Heart of the Doctrine of Recognition)abhinava gupta: polymath, scholar, aesthete, poet, and mahāsiddhaWhen studying the writings of the nondual Śaiva Tāntrikas of Kashmīr, there isone figure who appears as the lynchpin of this branch of the tradition, theconvergence point of much that had come before and the source of much that wasto come after: the unparalleled master Abhinava Gupta (c. 975–1025 CE).Abhinava’s parents were advanced Tantrik practitioners who conceived him inKaula ritual. He was thus said to be yoginī-bhū, “born of a yoginī,” and therebypossessing a special capacity for liberation. Abhinava alludes to his parentageand conception in his signature verse, found at the beginning of five of hismajor works. This verse has double entendre, a double meaning, for its primarymeaning is praise of God and Goddess (Śiva and Śakti) and celebration of thepulsing energy of their unified nature that is the source of the universe andthe very Heart of all beings; the secondary meaning is the autobiographical one.vimala-kalāśrayābhinava-sṛṣṭi-mahā jananībharita-tanuś ca pañca-mukha-gupta-rucir janakaḥ |tad-ubhaya-yāmala-sphurita-bhāva-visarga-mayaṃhṛdayam anuttarāmṛta-kulaṃ mama saṃsphuratāt || 1 ||Meaning 1: The Mother is She who is the ground of pure power, radiant withever-new genesis. The Father is He who is filled [with all the śaktis],maintaining His Light through His five faces. May my Heart, one with the diversecreation flowing forth from the fusion of these two, embodying the nectar of theAbsolute, shine forth!Meaning 2: My mother Vimalā is she for whom the birth of Abhinava was a festivalof joy; my father is renowned as Siṃhagupta, full [of the state of Śiva]. May myheart, formed from the emissions of the ecstatic state of their union, embodyingthe nectar of the Absolute, shine forth! (Tantrāloka: Light on the Tantras)This extraordinary verse is analyzed at length in Sanderson’s “Commentary on theOpening Verses of the Tantrasāra of Abhinavagupta,” his finest article onAbhinavaguptan theology. I will therefore make just a few observations here. Theverse serves as a kind of nexus point for the whole of Abhinava’s teaching aswell as his personal history, and in this, it perfectly expresses an idea thatis central to his theology: that the Divine is the transcendent source of allthings and, simultaneously, completely immanent as all things—and mostespecially as self-aware embodied beings. These two modes interpenetrate inbalanced dynamism, eternally unified yet arising fresh in every moment ofexperience. Thus every procreative sexual act of two humans in dynamic balancerecapitulates the divine act of the creation (and eternally arising re-creation)of the universe. The difference in the case of Abhinava’s parents is that theywere fully aware of this truth and fully embodying it at the moment of hisconception (or so he tells us). Thus the two different meanings of the verse areactually expressing one truth in expanded and contracted modes that are reflexesof each other. This alludes to the Spanda and Pratyabhijñā doctrines.The other central and key teachings that are embedded in the verse are thesefive:❖ All that exists expresses the nature of the Goddess, who is the stainlessground of absolute Power from which all specific forms of power and energyemanate and into which they return.❖ All things and states are aspects of the one Light of Consciousness thatcontinually arises in a dynamic play which expresses the creative intuition ofthat Light in its self-aware mode.❖ God is that which gives unity and cohesion to all the diverse powers (śaktis),providing structure for the free-flowing dynamism of the Goddess.❖ The ultimate Deity, the ultimate Reality, is the fusion of these two as theparadoxical two-in-one (yāmala), the reality known as the Heart (hṛdaya) or theEssence, for all creation flows forth from it.❖ This Heart, when penetrating and pervading every level of our embodiment, isexperienced as unsurpassed nectar-sweet joy and eternal life.Thus we see that Abhinava Gupta has managed to impregnate much of what he willteach in many thousands of verses of writing into this one verse, which therebyserves as a seed to the five major works that it begins. That he has done sowhile simultaneously honoring the specific circumstances of his own embodiment,bowing to the siddha and yoginī who conceived him, makes this verse one of themost extraordinary literary achievements of the tradition.The death of Abhinava’s mother, Vimalā, at a relatively young age may havecontributed to his passion for spirituality. He learned Sanskrit from hisfather, Narasiṃha Gupta (commonly known as Cukhulaka), and received initiationinto the Krama lineage at an early age from his father’s Krama Guru, Bhūtirāja,who had been a direct disciple of the famous Cakrabhānu. In his early twenties,he wrote his first work, a hymn to the goddess powers of the Krama, which is nowunfortunately lost. Then he wrote a commentary on the Bhagavad-Gītā, which we dohave, a work that shows the young Abhinava as learned but still callow, hiswords lacking the power, precision, and mature wisdom of his later works. Inthis commentary, he alludes to his knowledge of esoteric Krama teachings butdoes not reveal them; so those readers looking to this commentary for a Tantrikinterpretation of the Gītā will mostly be disappointed.In time, Abhinava studied with many gurus—around seventeen in total—and receiveddirect transmission in the Trika, Pratyabhijñā, Krama, and Saiddhāntikalineages, lacking only a direct transmission of the Spanda, the works of whichhe nevertheless studied carefully. He described himself as a bee, going fromflower to flower, collecting the nectar of each of these branches of thetradition in order to make them all into the sweetest honey. But it was notuntil he met his true master (sadguru) that he had an experiential realizationof all that he had studied. This meeting was like that of Rumi and Shams, forAbhinava was already an expert scholar of the scriptures and not lacking inspiritual experience. Yet something was missing: the final descent of grace(śaktipāta), triggering the complete and permanent expansion intoall-encompassing blissful nondual awareness, expressed and grounded inembodiment. It was said in the Kaula tradition that this state could only begranted by a guru who had attained it. This guru, for Abhinava, was a man namedŚambhu Nātha. He came to Kashmīr from the great śakti-pīṭha or holy place ofJālandhara, in the Puñjab. Śambhu was a master of both forms of the Trika (Kaulaand non-Kaula), having been taught by a guru from Mahārāṣṭra, the probablebirthplace of the Trika lineage. It was to this master that Abhinava attributedhis Self-realization, and thus he praised him before all his other teachers. Forexample, introducing both his two major works on Tantrik philosophy and practice(Tantrāloka 1.21 and Tantrasāra 1.3), he invites the reader to study the text bysaying:As an act of divine worship, may all contemplate the lotus of the heart ofAbhinava Gupta, < its blossom opened by the light falling from the rays of thesun, || its contraction forever banished by the wisdom descending from the feetof the illuminator, > [my master] Śambhu Nātha. (Tantrāloka)There is a kind of double entendre in this verse, too, though here it is not twoseparate meanings conveyed but rather a single meaning conveyed through therules of metaphor. Thus I have translated one phrase twice, the metaphor andwhat he means by it, separated by the symbol ||.Having come fully into his attainment, Abhinava then wrote his mature works. Allof these are written from the perspective of the Trika, which was his primaryreference point due to the influence of his sadguru Śambhu Nātha. However,Abhinava maintained his commitment to the teachings of the Krama, incorporatingthese as the esoteric core of his theology. His primary works include hisCommentary on the Mālinīvijaya, notable for its mystical explanation of theorigin and nature of the Śaiva Tantrik canon; his commentary called Unfoldingthe Thirty Verses of Parā (Parātriṃśika-vivaraṇa);125[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en125] and most notable ofall, his magnum opus, to which the next section is devoted.light on the tantrasThe Tantrāloka is a monumental explication of Tantrik practice and philosophy inover 5,800 verses. It is encyclopedic in its scope though not organized like anencyclopedia, for instead of just enumerating theories and practices, it bringsthem all into a coherent framework in which everything has its place andeverything makes sense in relation to the whole. It is, then, an awesome work ofsynthesis, which presents to the reader a vision of Śaiva Tantra as a unifiedsystem: far-reaching in its scope, powerful in its cohesion, and complex yetclear in its interrelations. To accomplish this synthesis, of course, he has toexplain apparent contradictions amongst the scriptures, which were originallyaddressed to differing audiences in varying periods. He does so by creating ahierarchy of understanding. For example, he explains that dualism is a validview of reality at one level of understanding and development and that,therefore, God compassionately revealed the dualistic scriptures for those whocould not yet comprehend or relate to nondualism. Nondualism, then, is both ahigher understanding and a higher experience that one can progress to. Beyond itthere an even higher teaching: paramādvaya, or “supreme nondualism.” This is theview that simultaneously encompasses and subsumes both dualism and nondualism,the view that goes completely beyond the notion of “levels of understanding.” Itis the inexpressible experience of the totality of reality in which noperspective is excluded, for each is seen as fitting into the pattern of agreater whole. However, it is very clear that in Abhinava’s viewpoint, one mustcarefully ascend through ever more refined levels of understanding in order toreach that all-inclusive state of no-levels. One cannot attempt to leap straightto that realm, lest all understanding decay into incoherent relativism.Abhinava lived in the cosmopolitan capital city of Śrīnagar. When his disciplesand friends entreated him to write Tantrāloka, he agreed and decided to move outof the capital to a quieter village in the valley, a village where all theinhabitants were faithful devotees of Shaivism. In this unnamed location, in ahouse provided by a former government minister who had retired to devote himselfto religion, Abhinava composed his great work. Because of its profoundsignificance to the tradition and widespread curiosity about it, we will outlineits contents here.contents of the tantrālokaChapter 1 sets out the fundamentals: the nature of bondage and liberation, therole of insight, and the four means to liberation (which we will later discussat length).Chapter 2 explains the first of the four means, that of anupāya or suddenrealization based on a single teaching-transmission from a realized master.Chapter 3 covers the second means, the method of nondiscursive, direct intuitioncalled śāmbhava-upāya or “the Divine Means,” together with a lengthy meditationon the metaphysical basis of the Sanskrit alphabet.Chapter 4 is on liberation through knowledge, i.e., cultivating thought-patternsin alignment with the nature of reality; this is the third means, which iscalled śākta-upāya or “the Empowered Means.” The chapter also includes anexcursus on the gradations of guru-hood.Chapter 5 expounds the methods of meditation, visualization, and breath practicecollectively called āṇava-upāya or “the Embodied Means,” which is the fourth andfinal means to liberation.Almost everything in the text after chapter 5 can be understood as acontinuation of the explanation of the “Embodied Means,” for methods emphasizingthe use of body (and the subtle body) constitute the great majority of allspiritual practices. This large corpus of techniques can be roughly divided intotwo basic interrelated categories: yoga and kriyā (ritual). Chapters 6 and 7cover the yoga of time: * Chapter 6 explains how the cycles of time correlate to the flow of the vital energy in the body, how to meditate on those cycles, and how to transcend time altogether. * Chapter 7 shows how the sequences of various mantras are to be mastered by contemplative repetition within the cyclical flow of the breath.Chapters 8 through 11 address the dimensions of space, all of which have bothcosmic and microcosmic aspects (the latter being within the subtle body of thepractitioner); thus they are used in both ritual and yoga. * In chapter 8 the hierarchy of “worlds” or dimensions of existence (bhuvanas) are detailed. * Chapter 9 treats the hierarchy of the tattvas or 36 Principles of Reality, along with an excursus on causality. * In chapter 10 the seven layers of consciousness or types of conscious beings are discussed, along with an excursus on objectivity. * In chapter 11 we learn about the five cosmic divisions/primordial creative powers (kalā), which are also the five constituents of the subtle body.Chapter 12 culminates and summarizes these discussions by treating the sixdistinct paths to liberation (the adhvans), three of which he has alreadytreated in detail (kalā, tattva, and bhuvana).Chapter 13 discusses the Descent of Power (śaktipāta) or grace by which embodiedConsciousness liberates itself, either directly or (more commonly) throughinitiation.Chapter 14 covers the opposite force, the power of occlusion by whichConsciousness binds itself.Chapters 15 through 33 cover ritual and its various elements. * Chapter 15: the longest, covers the nondualist understanding of ritual, the basic type of ritual initiation, and the rules of discipline for initiates138 * Chapters 16 and 17: The full form of liberating initiation (nirvāṇa-dīkṣā) * Chapter 18: Abbreviated initiation * Chapter 19: Initiation for those close to death * Chapter 20: The ritual called scales initiation * Chapter 21: Initiation for those who have just left the body * Chapter 22: Initiation after conversion from another faith * Chapter 23: Ritual consecration of gurus * Chapter 24: Cremation rites * Chapter 25: The ritual of making offerings to the ancestors * Chapter 26: The daily Tantrik ritual of worship * Chapter 27: Consecration of substrates of personal worship (statues, etc.) * Chapter 28: Miscellaneous rites, including worship of Yoginīs (in human form), rites preceding the teaching of scripture, and worship of the person of the guru, plus an excursus on the nature of death and the pathways of the soul after death * Chapter 29: Rites of the Kaula Trika, including Kaula initiation and the Kaula sexual ritual (ādi-yāga or “primal worship”) * Chapter 30: Mantras * Chapter 31: Maṇḍalas * Chapter 32: Mudrās or “seals,” configurations of body, prāṇa, and awareness to achieve particular states * Chapter 33: Ancillary deities of the Trika * Chapter 34: The relationship among the three means to liberation described in chapters 1–5 * Chapter 35: The canon of scripture and hierarchy of revelation * Chapter 36: The transmission of the key Trika scriptures, The Doctrine of the Perfected Yoginīs (Siddha-yogeśvarī-mata) and The Latter Triumph of the Alphabet Goddess (Mālinī-vijaya-uttara) * Chapter 37: Why the study of Tantrāloka is valuable; and an account of Abhinava’s family line, his gurus and spiritual history (in brief), and acknowledgment of his close disciples This table of contents shows us that by Abhinava’s time, the Tantra had extendedits reach into the domain of exoteric religion. Yet ever faithful to hisesoteric goals, Abhinava works to prevent the decay into routine and mindlessadherence to rule that such involvement usually implies. He teaches that themantras, meditations, and rituals of the Tantra are living embodiments of theDivine, and that they have no real use if separated from the energy that is fulland complete Consciousness. Once they have lost their power through thepractitioner’s lack of understanding, faith, or awareness, they become like deadbodies that can only be brought back to life through contact with a guru forwhom they are still vibrating with life-energy, imbued with śakti. Thus Abhinavaallows the Tantra to encompass the domain of religion as well as spirituality,but ever labors to infuse the potency of the esoteric realm of the latter intothe exoteric realm of the former. This, after all, is the real goal of theTantra: to experience the Divine not just in rarefied “spiritual” environmentsbut in every aspect of mundane life.The Tantrāloka is such a significant work that Abhinava chose to rewrite ittwice, for the benefit of those who were less highly educated in thecomplexities of Indian philosophy. The first rewrite was Essence of the Tantras(Tantrasāra), a work mostly in prose with key summary verses at the end of eachchapter. The main purpose of the Tantrasāra is to summarize the Tantrāloka, butthe ever-fresh Abhinava also adds some new material. I would argue that theTantrasāra is a more important work for those with a practical interest in theTantra, for by mostly leaving aside the discourse of intellectual/logical debatethat we see in the Tantrāloka, Abhinava was able to write in a more tightlyfocused and powerful manner, with every phrase resonating with Truth. The toneof the work is precisely what one would expect if, having discovered that theTantrāloka was too difficult for most people, Abhinava thought to himself,“Okay, let’s get serious and get down to the essence (sāra) of what reallymatters.” The result feels more like a transmission than a dissertation. Thefirst half of the Tantrasāra will be published in my own translation in the nearfuture.Following the Tantrasāra, Abhinava composed the shortest recension of thismaterial by taking just the summary verses of the Tantrasāra and giving a shortcommentary on each. This work is called the Tantroccaya. None of these works isavailable yet in English, but the first five chapters of the Tantrāloka arepublished in French and the whole work in Italian, albeit in a flawedtranslation.Abhinava’s final major works of Tantrik philosophy were his commentaries onUtpala Deva’s Stanzas on the Recognition of the Lord mentioned earlier. Abhinavaalso composed a number of exquisite devotional-cum-philosophical poems, such asthe Hymn to Bhairava and Fifteen Verses on Awakening. Finally, we should notethat Abhinava was quite a renowned philosopher of aesthetics, writing a numberof works on what makes art beautiful and affecting, works that were (for themost part) separate from his spiritual writings. He specialized in the study ofpoetry, and his most important work in that area was his commentary on Light onthe Theory of Suggestion (Dhvanyāloka), an earlier work of profound significancein the study of aesthetics. In Abhinava’s erudite and thoughtful commentary, heanalyzes the nature of aesthetic experience in terms of how it comes about, whatit signifies, and what are its various dimensions. His exposition of the ninerasas or “flavors of aesthetic experience” has become quite famous. Indeed, hiswork in this area is better known amongst academic Sanskritists than is hisspiritual material.One of my teachers, the masterful scholar Somadeva Vasudeva, explained rasatheory perfectly when he wrote,Rasa is the experience one has viewing artwork; it refers to the experienceitself. Therefore what we call rasa is not located in the work but in theviewer. Rasa does not refer to the everyday, worldly emotions of love, sorrow,humor etc., but to their transformation into aesthetic sentiment. Thetransformation of worldly emotion into aesthetic sentiment occurs when we becomekeenly aware of the worldly emotion in our own hearts. This very act ofawareness, in which we witness the arising of one basic emotion (love, sorrow,laughter, etc.), entails its transformation into aesthetic sentiment. This actof awareness and synchronous transformation is rasa.This is thought to be an experience that (people who are not spiritualpractitioners) can obtain only through experiencing art, because it is only withart that we allow ourselves to become detached enough to become witnesses to ouremotional states.The nine rasas are: the erotic (śṛṅgāra), the comic (hāsya), the wrathful(raudra), the compassionate (kāruṇya), the disgusting (bībhatsa), the terrifying(bhayānaka), the heroic or inspiring (vīrya), the astonishing (adbhuta), and thepeaceful (śānta). What is so interesting about this list is that all of theseare experiences brought about by art, therefore they are all to be understood asexperiences of beauty. We can easily find examples of all of these in (say)contemporary film, though whether any given example constitutes “art” is open todebate; and in the context of rasa theory, that debate would center on whetherthe film was successful in transforming emotion into real aesthetic sentiment.In rasa theory we can find spiritual principles: The first is that the functionof art is to center us in ourselves, savoring the vibration of awarenessflavored by the particular rasa that the art has evoked. The second is the factthat art allows for the transformation of unpleasant emotions into theexperience of beauty, for example lust is transformed into the erotic rasa,sadness into the compassionate rasa, anger into the wrathful rasa, andworld-weariness into the peaceful rasa.The influence of Abhinava Gupta, while not widespread, went deep. The KaulaTrika/Krama synthesis he presented, was compelling enough to have been adoptedby a number of other lineages. Not only that, other Śaiva schools, like that ofthe Śrī-vidyā, formulated their thought along the lines of Abhinava and hisdisciples. This influence was felt even in other religions: the Tantrik Vaiṣṇavascripture called the Lakṣmī Tantra clearly borrowed ideas from The Heart of theDoctrine of Recognition by Abhinava’s disciple Kṣemarāja.The teachings of Abhinava’s lineage continued to be transmitted for centuries intwo primary locations: in their native Kashmīr (where the lineages preservingthese teachings became increasingly diminished after Muslim conquest in 1300),and in the far south of the subcontinent, another place that was a spiritualheartland for many centuries. It seems that a native of Madurai, an ancient cityof the Tamiḷ country, came 2,000 miles to receive initiation from Abhinava. Thisman, named Madhurāja, wrote a beautiful description of Abhinava as part of a setof verses he composed for meditation on his guru. The stylized nature of this“pen-portrait” has led scholars to question whether or not Madhurāja really metAbhinava; but I would argue that following standard literary forms in his paeanto Abhinava hardly disproves that an actual meeting took place. And we do knowfor certain that Abhinava’s teachings were known in the Tamiḷ region shortlyafter his passing. Madhurāja’s description of Abhinava follows, in PaulMuller-Ortega’s translation:Out of his deep compassion, [Śiva] has taken a new bodily form as Abhinava Guptaand come to Kashmīr. He sits in the middle of a garden of grapes, inside apavilion [adorned with] crystal and filled with beautiful paintings [of nature].The room smells wonderful because of flower garlands, incense sticks, and oillamps. It is constantly resounding with musical instruments, with songs, andwith dancing. There are crowds of yogīs and yoginīs, realized beings, andsiddhas. . . . In the center of the room there is a golden seat from whichpearls are hanging. It has a soft awning stretched over it as a canopy. Heresits Abhinava Gupta attended by all his numerous students, with Kṣemarāja attheir head, who are writing down everything he says. . . . Abhinava Gupta’s[half-closed] eyes are trembling in ecstasy. In the middle of his forehead is aconspicuous tilaka made of sacred ashes. He has a rudrākṣa bead hanging from hisear. His long hair is held by a garland of flowers. He has a long beard andreddish-brown skin. His neck is dark and glistening with musk and sandalwoodpaste. Two dūtīs stand at his side holding refreshments [wine etc.]. . . . Hewears a silken cloth as a dhoti, white as moonbeams, and he sits in the yogicposture known as vīrāsana. One hand is held on his knee holding a japa-mālā andhis fingers make the mudrā that signifies his knowledge of the highest Śiva. Heplays on a resonating lute [ektār] with the tips of his quivering fingers of hislotus-like left hand. (Gurunātha-parāmarśa of Madhurāja)Even if it is not a factual historical description, this pen-portrait tells ushow near-contemporaries of Abhinava thought about him. What we notice most ofall about it is its strong emphasis on refined sensual beauty, as befits adescription of a Tantrik master."},{"pageContent":"the kaula lineagesTo close our history of the classical Tantrik tradition, I will offer thebriefest of glimpses into the formation of the Kaula lineage. Earlier I referredto the whole left side of Śaiva Tantra, the nondual Goddess-worshipping side, as“Kaula.” But within that general rubric, there was also a specific lineagegrouping called “Kula” or “Kaula,” the lineage that was the original source ofthe more general term. It is headed by the semi-historical, semi-legendaryfigure of Macchanda Nātha (a.k.a. Matsyendra), “Lord Fisherman,” possibly of the8th century. Macchanda is one of the most highly revered masters of the Tantra,considered a mahāsiddha in both Śaiva and Buddhist camps and has even been madeinto a deity in Nepāl’s Kāthmāndu valley, which still celebrates an annualfestival in his honor, though they have long since forgotten his teachings. Inthe original sources, he is revered as the avatār or revealer of the Truth inthe fourth and current age, i.e., the kali-yuga, the “age of discord”; the termhas no relation to the Goddess Kālī. He was from Kāmarūpa (modern Assam) in thefar east, but must have traveled widely, for we know that his partner andconsort was nicknamed Konkanāmbā, “the Mother from Konkan,” a place on thewestern coast, south of modern Mumbai (Bombay). (See the map[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-12.xhtml#mapofindia].) Unfortunately,her name is not as well-remembered as her partner’s, even though the two wereoriginally praised as a pair of awakened masters. They worshipped Śiva and Śaktias a conjugal pair, under the names Kuleśvara and Kuleśvarī (Lord and Lady ofthe Family). Later practitioners influenced by Kaulism often used these namesfor whatever specific forms of Śiva and Śakti they worshipped.Macchanda and Konkanāmbā are said to have had twelve sons. Six became celibateascetics, and six became married householders. It was the latter six whomMacchanda and Konkanāmbā initiated, transmitting to them their wisdom-teachings.Interestingly, the names of these six sons are not Sanskrit, but rather areassociated with tribes beyond the pale of normal Indian society, thus alludingto the early shamanic origins of the Kaula teachings. These six sons became(together with their consorts) the heads of six lineages, called ovallis. Thelineages developed into specific clans, which maintained networks of lodges nearsacred sites around the subcontinent and had special hand-signals so memberscould recognize each other. The names of these six clans were Ānanda, Bodhi,Āvali, Prabhu, Pāda, and Yogī, and their members, accordingly, had names endingin one of the six clan-names.This Kaula lineage group originated by Macchanda and Konkanāmbā was not includedamongst the nine main schools we discussed earlier because it was not a separateschool in the same sense, with its own sectarian doctrines and specific cult ofworship. It was rather a particular way of practicing the Tantra (i.e., withgreater emphasis on the sensual), and its real significance lay in the profoundinfluence it exerted on some of the left-current schools, so that in time twovariants of some sects were acknowledged, for example the regular Trika and theKaula Trika. One group, the Krama, only had a Kaula form, arising as it didunder strong Kaula influence. This influence served to counter thetranscendentalist emphasis seen in some parts of the tradition, for whatcharacterized the Kaula above all was its emphasis on the primacy of the bodyand on the immanent aspect of the Divine. A totally practice-based lineage, ittaught the use of sensual experience as a springboard into divine Presence.Therefore it is solely within the Kaula-influenced lineages that sexual riteswere practiced and that transgressive substances were both offered to God andconsumed by the offerer (as is considered necessary in a nondual view that“walks the talk”). The only source we have for the details of Tantrik sexualritual (kula-yāga), chapter 29 of Abhinava’s Tantrāloka, presents the rite inthe context of Kaula initiation. One the primary purposes of the rite asdescribed there is to produce the sacramental substances to be used in that typeof initiation, which may further imply that in Abhinava’s view the kula-yāgaought only to be practiced by qualified gurus."},{"pageContent":"post-classical tantraand the advent of hatha-yogaIn these final parts of the history section, I will give a brief overview of thehistory of the tradition’s ramifications in the centuries after its classicalperiod (800–1200 CE). After the dissolution of the institutional base for ŚaivaTantra with the coming of Islam, it was the Kaula-influenced lineages, withtheir grassroots noninstitutionalized structure, that survived best. At the sametime, the word “Kaula” increased in ambiguity as it became a kind offree-floating signifier associated with a wide variety of transgressive andbodily practices that proliferated in this post-classical period of lateTantrism (roughly 1300 onward). One of the results of the loss of theinstitutional base for the Tantra (both Śaiva and Buddhist) in this period, andthe evaporation of huge amounts of funding that base formerly attracted, is thatthe householder tradition which had been dominant in the classical period beganto contract and disappear, slowly making the wandering ascetic Tantrik yogīs themain holders of the tradition. This was problematic in that, though these yogīswere supported by the general public (with food and sometimes shelter), theywere also feared and regarded with suspicion, since so many of them were knownto pursue supernatural powers. It was also a problem because these oftenilliterate or partially literate wandering sādhus did not systematicallydocument their yogic discoveries. Furthermore, some of these Tantrik yogīs madea living by performing magical rituals on behalf of clients who wanted wealth, awoman, or to hurt an enemy.This, then, was the beginning of the process by which the Tantra acquired a badname during the late medieval and early modern period. In my opinion, thesubstantial decline in the number of female practitioners during this shift froma householder base to a wandering ascetic base partially accounts for the lossof balance that allowed seeking of worldly power to come back to the forefrontof the tradition, as it had been more than five hundred years previously.126[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en126] Of course, there werestill many practitioners pursuing liberation in a sober and dedicated manner,but they were an ever-dwindling minority.We will briefly chart the development (some would say decline) of the Tantrainto what, in the post-classical period, came to be called haṭha-yoga. Much moreresearch is called for into this subject, but very recent work done by Europeanscholars has shed some much-needed light. In the 12th to 13th centuries, theSouth Indian Śāmbhavānanda lineage of Śaiva Tantra (see sampradāyas #8 and 9)featured a yogic practice centered on the ascent of kuṇḍalinī energy through sixsubtle centers called cakras. This is precisely the system we find in the laterhaṭha-yoga texts. The bridge text between this Śāmbhavānanda lineage of ŚaivaTantra and the later haṭha-yoga is Matsyendra’s Compendium recently translatedby European scholar Csaba Kiss. It tells the story of Matsyendra and his chiefdisciple, the man credited with founding the practice tradition of haṭha-yoga.According to the account in Matsyendra’s Compendium in the 13th century a manfrom the royal family of the Chola kingdom (present-day Tamiḷ Nāḍu) who wouldlater be called Gorakṣa Nātha met a master named Matsyendra (clearly named afterthe founder of Kaulism from five centuries earlier). This meeting so impressedGorakṣa that he wandered India for two years looking for Matsyendra, finallyfinding him in the Western country. Matsyendra was cavorting with wine andwomen, and when Gorakṣa humbly approached him with no indication of a judgmentof such conduct, he passed the test and received initiation from the master.Gorakṣa is now considered by many to be the founder of the haṭha-yoga system,and though he did not use that exact term, there is probably some truth to this.It seems that Gorakṣa travelled widely, teaching practices such as bodilypurification; postures called bandhas, karaṇas, and mudrās; āsanas; subtle bodyvisualizations; and meditations—all designed to awaken the inner meditationenergy called kuṇḍalinī, leading to a state of union with the Divine. He is theprobable author of some of the earliest texts associated with haṭha-yoga, suchas The Sun of Discernment (Viveka-mārtaṇḍa) and The Hundred Verses of Gorakṣa.These texts, along with the Attainment of Nectar by Virūpākṣa Nātha,127[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en127] would be adopted by alineage group that became known as the Nāth Yogīs, who looked back to GorakṣaNātha (a.k.a. Gorakh Nāth) as their founder and Matsyendra Nātha (a.k.a.Macchendra Nāth) as their patron saint.The Nāths were quasi-Tantrik ascetic yogīs who propagated non-brāhminicalpractices enshrined in texts with a nondual view but lacking a substantialphilosophical component. They venerated nine nāthas or masters, beginning withMatsyendra and Gorakṣa Nātha. The most important text (probably) produced by theNāth Yogī lineage group is the 15th-century Haṭha-[yoga]-pradīpikā. This text,the first haṭha-yoga text to include a wide range of postures that it calledāsanas, was hugely important for it became the most-cited text on haṭha-yogaafter the 15th century. The Haṭha-pradīpikā is not original but rather acompilation of earlier works, citing more than twenty of the scriptures thatcame before it. Curiously, after the 16th century, the Nāth Yogīs stoppedpracticing yoga, but their practices were preserved by other lineages, notablythe Dasnāmī Sannyāsins, who are still active today as the most high-profileyogic lineage group of modern India.128[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en128]But before we come to modern yoga, let’s clarify a little more the relationshipbetween haṭha-yoga, the forerunner of modern yoga, and Śaiva Tantra. Compared tothe latter, the haṭha-yoga texts have a marked lack of View teachings(“philosophy”), probably due to the loss of the patronage that made suchprofound learning possible in the period of classical Tantra. They also jettisonthe complex mantra system that largely defined classical Tantrik practice. Yetmost of the practices found in the haṭha-yoga texts are simplified from those ofclassical Tantra, as we shall see. Thus these texts can be seen as an attempt tocapture the most essential Tantrik practices, especially those of the subtlebody, in the face of the dissolution of the classical tradition. This explainswhy the language of these texts is relatively simple: they wanted to beunderstood by people who could not undertake the years of education required bythe classical Tantrik systems.evidence of the tantrik roots of hatha-yogaSince there is a widespread misunderstanding today that haṭha-yoga derives fromor relates to the yoga of Patañjali (some modern postural yogīs even chant aninvocation to him before beginning practice), it will be useful to brieflypresent some evidence from the primary haṭha-yoga sources that demonstrate thatthey were (and saw themselves as) inheritors of the Tantrik tradition and noother. Yoga scholar Christopher Tompkins has done a groundbreaking study inwhich he documents dozens of passages in The Hundred Verses of Gorakṣa that aredrawn from a much earlier scriptures of Tantrik Yoga (specifically, theinfluential Transcendence of Time).129[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en129] Material currentlythought by some scholars (and the general public) to originate in haṭha-yogathat Tompkins proves comes from Tantrik yoga includes the following:Teachings in the haṭha-yoga texts that are sourced directly from Tantrikscriptures❖ the subtle body physiology of 72,000 channels (nāḍīs) with 10 primarychannels, of which three are most important;❖ the analogizing of those three primary channels to the three radiances of sun,moon, and fire;❖ explanation of the functions of the ten vital energies (prāṇa-vāyus);❖ installation and activation of mantras in the subtle centers of the body;❖ the mantra of the “recitation of the Self” (haṃsa, so’ham) occurring naturally21,600 times per day;❖ the opening of the heart center analogized to a blossoming lotus;❖ ascension of the soul through the central channel (suṣumnā nāḍī) by means ofprāṇāyāma, dhāraṇā, and dhyāna;❖ description of the primal Goddess who effects this process as the “coiledpower” (kuṇḍalinī); and❖ the fructification of yoga-sādhanā known as the experience of “nectarpervasion.”All of these concepts are taken by Gorakṣa direct from The Transcendence of Timeor from an intermediate source that faithfully transmitted them. As we haveseen, the Kubjikā tantras are clearly another source that he used.To put it as plainly as possible, then, there is no direct connection betweenPatañjali’s pre-Tantrik yoga and the discipline of haṭha-yoga, whose respectiveperiods of ascendency are separated by well over a thousand years. In fact, manyof the texts of the haṭha-yoga tradition explicitly see themselves as inheritingpractices from the Tantrik tradition. The Tantra itself had absorbed Patañjali’spractice teachings early on (while rejecting his philosophical dualism). Thoughquotes from the Yoga-sūtra are very rare in Tantrik literature, none of thetechniques the Yoga-sūtra taught were forgotten by the Tantrik tradition. Thepart of the Yoga-sūtra that appears again and again in the medieval period isits formulation of the eight primary practices of yoga (aṣṭānga-yoga). All eightwere absorbed by the Tantra and passed on to haṭha-yoga.130[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en130]In an early modern Sanskrit source, we see clearly that authorities of that timedid not think of aṣṭānga-yoga (“the yoga of eight components”) as somethingdifferent from haṭha-yoga. In fact, they see haṭha-yoga as a Tantrikamplification of the aṣṭānga-yoga. We see this in the 18th-century presentationof a yoga of fifteen components in which nearly all the additional components(aṅgas) come from Tantrik sources.131[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en131] The bolded items on thelist below constitute the aṣṭānga-yoga of Patañjali. Explanations of thepractices given in brackets are particular to this early modern text, whichunderstands many of them differently from Patañjali.1. the five yamas [= those of Patañjali]2. the five niyamas [= those of Patañjali]2a. The ten niyamas of the Haṭha-pradīpikā3. tyāga, renunciation [the nonattachment of mind and body to worldly things]4. mauna, silence [speaking only the truth if one has to speak at all]5. deśa, the place for practice6. kāla, time [auspicious astrological moment]7. mūlabandha, the root lock [presented in conjunction with āsana]8. āsana, posture9. prāṇāyāma, breath control [understood as purification of the nāḍī-cakra]10. deha-sāmya, equanimity of the body11. dṛk-sthiti, fixed gazeAdditional aṅgas [optional]:• ṣaṭkarma, the six purifications• aṣṭa-kumbhaka, eight subtypes of breath retention• nāḍī-śuddhi, purification of bodily channels• Kuṇḍalinī• Khecarī mudrā [here=raising the energy to the third eye and dissolving it inmeditation]12. pratyāhāra, sense-withdrawal13. dhāraṇā, fixation of attention13a. dissolving the mind in the turya-pada, the state of the fourth14. dhyāna, visualization of Paramaśiva or the Self15. samādhi, absorption15a. nāda, sonic experiences in samādhi15b. unmanī, transmental state15c. mukti, liberationA number of the Sanskrit terms in the list above originate in Tantrik sources.Examining this evidence and that presented below forces us to the conclusionthat to present the Yoga-sūtra separately from the Tantra is to engage in anartificial revivalism divorced from the organic history of the yoga tradition.Yet somehow, with more than a hundred English translations of the Yoga-sūtrapublished over the last 120 years and a segment on the Yoga-sūtra required innearly every modern yoga teacher training, the realization is still notwidespread that the yoga that text describes bears little resemblance to ourmodern practice of the same name. For example, there are only two sentences onposture in the entire Yoga-sūtra. (I should note, however, that the intrinsicvalue of the text is quite high for anyone practicing meditation.) This is theoverlooked elephant in the room of modern yoga curricula.132[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en132]By contrast, when we turn to the primary sources of haṭha-yoga in Sanskrit,there we find many of the practices given in modern yoga. And as already noted,these very texts link themselves to the Tantrik tradition from which they drawmany of their teachings. For example, the Śiva-saṃhitā (c. 1500 CE) calls itselfa tantra and presents itself as a dialogue between Śiva and Śakti, the classicalform for a Tantrik scripture. The Gheraṇḍa-saṃhitā (c. 1700 CE), while notclaiming scriptural authority, presents itself as the teachings of a haṭha-yogīnamed Gheraṇḍa to his student Chaṇḍa Kāpāli, “the Fierce Skull-bearer,” anexplicitly Tantrik name. Furthermore, it describes its key teachings as secretspreviously concealed in the Tantrik scriptures. For example, the practice ofinversion (viparīta-karaṇī), commonly practiced in yoga today, is said in verse3.30 to have been “concealed in all the Tantras.” Indeed, this phrase is almosta cliché in these texts.The general organizing principle in the classic (i.e., most influential)haṭha-yoga texts is the concept of the rise of the latent innate Goddess Power,or kuṇḍalinī-śakti. This term, and the subtle body physiology that it implies,is quintessentially Tantrik. It is found described in the Tantrik scripturesunder that and alternate names, such as kula-kuṇḍalī and kaulikī-śakti, termsthat allude to the definition of kuṇḍalinī as the fundamental organizingintelligence of embodied Consciousness. We see a prototypical example ofhaṭha-yoga’s appropriation of these teachings in the Gheraṇḍa-saṃhitā, astranslated by one of the finest current scholars of haṭha-yoga, Sir JamesMallinson:Sitting in siddhāsana, having drawn in Prāṇa with repeated applications ofkākī-mudrā, he should then join it with apāna and meditate on the six cakras insuccession. Using the mantras huṃ and haṃsa, the wise yogī should bring thesleeping serpent Goddess to consciousness and raise her, together with the jīva[= soul], to the highest lotus. Having himself now become made of Śakti, heshould visualize supreme union with Śiva, as well as various pleasures,enjoyments, and ultimate bliss. As a result of the union of Śiva and Śakti, hewill experience the ultimate goal [while] on earth. (Gheraṇḍa-saṃhitā)I hardly need point out that this passage is entirely Tantrik in its language,tone, and tenor.To conclude this section on haṭha-yoga, I wish to draw attention to a text thatprovides evidence that haṭha-yoga continued as a textually-productive, livingtradition right into the modern period. The Ornament of Yoga (Yoga-karṇikā), ayoga scripture not yet known to the public, was probably written in Vārānasī inthe 18th or 19th century. This text corroborates my argument about the roots ofhaṭha-yoga, for it presents Tantrik practices and uses Tantrik mantras. It alsodemonstrates that the haṭha-yoga tradition had an increasing interest inphysical postures (āsanas) even before the influence of the internationalphysical culturemovement on India (to which we will come). Though this text presents itself asscripture, it is also an explicit compilation, for it topically organizes andcompares the practice instructions of earlier haṭha-yoga texts.other elements of post-classical tantrismThe haṭha-yoga tradition was not the only late medieval tradition to preservesome of the teachings of classical Tantra. In fact, there were many such, eachpreserving a different piece of the original whole. Tantrik ritual was practicedand studied in the South, especially in the form of the Śrīvidyā, which came intime to be incorporated into the practice of followers of the increasinglysuccessful Vedānta philosophy. (Note that the Śiva-saṃhitā mentioned earliershows both Śrīvidyā and Vedānta influence.) The Śrīvidyā’s influence was soextensive that its practice was taken up even by the most orthodoxrepresentatives of the Vedānta, the Śaṅkarācāryas of the major South Indianmonasteries at Śringeri and Kāncīpuram—figures equivalent to an archbishop inChristianity. One of these wrote a famous text called the Saundarya-laharī(Billows of Beauty), which again combines Vedānta with Śrīvidyā, though the viewand aesthetic of the latter is dominant.Manuscript evidence attests to the post-classical study and practice of Tantrain Kerala, in Andhra, in Orissa, and in Nepāl, where it especially flourishedthroughout the entire second millennium. There were Śaiva Tantrik āshrams inRājasthān (where haṭha-yoga also flourished) almost up to the present day. Weknow that in the 19th century, for example, a king of that region was initiatedinto the Tantra; and it was there, oral accounts attest, that SwāmīSatyānanda—probably the most knowledgeable 20th-century exponent of thepractices of Śaiva Tantra—learned at least some of what he knew about thesubject.Post-classical Tantra certainly flourished in Bengal, where goddess worship wasespecially strong. It was in this eastern region that the tradition of thedaśa-mahā-vidyās or “Ten Mantra Goddesses” developed.The Ten Mahāvidyās❖ Kālī (The Dark Goddess)❖ Tārā (She Who Saves)❖ Tripurasundarī (Beautiful in the Three Worlds)❖ Bhuvaneśvarī (She Whose Body Is the Earth)❖ Chinnamastā (the Self-Decapitated Goddess)❖ Bhairavī (the Fierce Goddess)❖ Dhūmāvatī (the Smoke-Colored Widow)❖ Bagalamukhī (the Paralyzer of Demons)❖ Mātangī (the Outcaste Goddess)❖ Kamalā (the Lotus Goddess)This set of ten, still popular today, represents a synthesis of originallyseparate Tantrik schools, as some of their names indicate: Kālī (from theKālīkula traditions); Tārā and Chinnamastā (from Buddhist Tantra);Tripura-sundarī, a.k.a. Ṣoḍaśī (from the Śrīvidyā); and Bhairavī (probably fromthe Trika). Note that the usage of the word vidyā to mean “a goddess embodied ina mantra” is exclusively Tantrik. For more on this set of ten, see DavidKinsley’s fine book on the subject (Tantric Visions of the Divine Feminine: TheTen Mahāvidyās from University of California Press).A variety of texts from the far south and also from the far east of Indiadocument this syncretistic and largely philosophy-free phase of late Tantra(1400–1800), which almost exclusively emphasized undertaking the sādhanā(meaning practice with mantra, yantra, and visualization) of a particular deityin order to come to embody that deity and activate her powers within oneself(something also found in the classical tradition, but here the deity is oftennot understood as the one overarching Divinity, since s/he is invoked for theattainment of specific worldly goals). A number of these later Tantrik textshave been studied by scholar Gudrun Bühnemann, whose published works may beconsulted for a reliable accounting of them.Finally we may consider the case of Kashmīr. There, though the traditioncontracted considerably under Muslim rule, a body of teachings continued to betransmitted concerning the attainment of liberation through three primary means:ritual, meditation, and mystical knowledge (karma, yoga, jñāna). Abundanttextual evidence from the early modern period (16th–18th centuries) in Kashmīrshows that the form of yogic meditation then preferred was a variety ofkuṇḍalinī-yoga directly taken over from the Śaiva Tantrik sources. In thispractice, one is said to attain identity with Śiva by withdrawing the vitalenergy into the central channel through breath regulation (prāṇāyāma) whilementally repeating Oṃ, thereby raising kuṇḍalinī to the crown of the head,penetrating the six cakras along the way.133[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en133] Furthermore, theliberating mystical knowledge (jñāna) taught here is based on that of AbhinavaGupta. Thus 20th-century Kashmīrī gurus of Śaiva Tantra, such as Swāmī LakṣhmanJū, could claim a continuous transmission back to the classical period, thoughby the nature of Indian guruhood, they were not able to acknowledge how much waslost over that period. Lakṣman Jū, frequently cited as the last living master ofthe Trika lineage, is discussed in the conclusion.modern postural yogaThe person mostly responsible for the creation of what scholars call “modernpostural yoga,” as practiced in some form today by more than 20 million peoplein the West, drew heavily on haṭha-yoga teachings. His name was Kriṣhṇamācārya,and his school of yoga founded in Mysore, South India, in the 1930s was thearena for the constitution of the modern discipline. As commonly practicedtoday, modern postural yoga (MPY) is a form of exercise that often bears only aslight resemblance to the haṭha-yoga tradition that inspired it. Though most ofits postures are of a twentieth-century coinage, at least eighty of them can bedocumented as deriving from premodern haṭha-yoga, in addition to thenon-postural elements, which all derive from that source. Scholar MarkSingleton’s work has shown us that despite claims to the contrary, MPY is aproduct of modern globalization, having early 20th-century European and Americanexercise forms (such as “harmonial gymnastics”) as its other influences.134[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en134]Kriṣhṇamācārya wished to emphasize the traditional roots of MPY and thus claimedto have received a direct transmission of sacred knowledge from a disembodiedsiddha he called Nātha-muni (note the connection to the Nāths mentioned above).He documented this transmission in a Sanskrit text he called The Secret of Yoga(Yoga-rahasya), which he evidently intended to be the scriptural authority forthe modern instantiation of yoga. This is of course a perfectly valid claimwithin the tradition, which possesses an “open canon” that can theoretically beadded to at any time—and transmission from disembodied beings in dreams andvisions is well-attested, as we have seen.So speaking in the broadest possible terms, we may say that if Kriṣhṇamācārya isthe father of modern postural yoga, its grandfather was Gorakṣa, a Nāth in aKaula-influenced lineage, which makes Matsyendra, the originator of thatlineage, its great-grandfather. (Remember that Gorakṣa’s guru was named afterthe original Matsyendra and may even have been a literary invention based on himwith the purpose of strengthening the ties between the new discipline ofhaṭha-yoga and the Śaiva Tantra from which it derived.) SinceMatsyendra/Macchanda was a guru of Śaiva Tantra, I think it is legitimate toargue that when modern yoga teachers seek to re-embed postural yoga practice ina spiritual context and further seek to align themselves with the ancient systemof thought that fits most harmoniously with that practice—thereby empowering andenhancing it—then the system that makes most sense to align with is the very onethat modern yoga can ultimately be traced back to: that of classical ŚaivaTantra.135 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en135]This brings to an end our survey of the history of Śaiva Tantra and its keyfigures. Next we turn to a survey of the classical teachings on Tantrikpractice, which we have thus far only touched on."},{"pageContent":"3An Introductionto the Practiceof Śaiva TantraThis portion of the book will be devoted to a relatively brief examination ofthe various practices that were performed in the context of classical ŚaivaTantra, nearly all of which have survived in some form down to the present day,though they are not commonly known. We will also give some substantial attentionto the theory of practice found in NŚT as well as the prerequisites for it.the context of practice:śaktipāta and dīksāAs mentioned in the history section, to practice the Tantra, to have access toits scriptures, and to have access to a guru, the prospective student mustundergo initiation. Historically, initiation was open to anyone who reallywanted it and whose sincere longing was demonstrated through reverent and loyaldevotion to the tradition (bhakti), offerings of selfless service (sevā), andfinancial offerings proportionate to one’s income (dāna, dakṣinā136[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en136]). The longing forinitiation was thought to be a direct result of a spiritual awakening calledśakti-pāta, the “Descent of Grace” or “Influx of God’s Power.”The Descent of Grace might be called a conversion experience because it is anawakening that brings a person to the spiritual path, regardless of whether thatperson previously had any spiritual inclinations whatsoever. Such an awakeningis a part of every spiritual tradition, but it is given especial prominence inŚaiva Tantra, for a person could not be initiated unless the initiating guru hadgood reason to believe that the applicant had experienced the śaktipātaawakening. That is to say, from the perspective of the dualist branch of thetradition, a guru had to believe that Śiva wanted that person to be initiatedand therefore would look for signs that s/he had received śaktipāta, signs wewill examine below. (The issue is more subtle on the nondualist side, as we willsee.)The doctrine of śaktipāta survives into the present day, in lineages such asthat of Swāmī Viṣhṇu Tīrth and Swāmī Muktānanda (who was very much influenced bythe former). These 20th-century gurus take śaktipāta to be synonymous with theawakening of kuṇḍalinī-śakti, arguing that the latter is brought about by theagency of a realized master. By contrast, classical Tantra typically picturesśaktipāta as occurring spontaneously; it is said to impel the recipient to beginsearching for such a guru.Inspired by my comparative study of religion, I take śaktipāta to be one namefor a real, universal, culturally-independent human experience, a shift inconsciousness that is a biological potentiality in all humans. If we strip awaythe cultural and religious ideas that are usually immediately attached to thisexperience, we find remarkably similar features of the experiencecross-culturally. Śaktipāta, whatever we call it, is a transformative directexperience of what some call “God,” others call “the inner Self,” and stillothers call “Buddha-nature”; an experience that consecrates one to the spiritualpath. Some people experience two such transmissions of grace: one, usuallymilder, that initiates their seeking for a path or a teacher, and another, morepowerful one, when they have found that path or teacher.Whether one’s śaktipāta is subjectively weak or strong, it has the same effect:it is a life-changing experience, forever altering how one sees reality, thoughsuch alteration is immediate in the case of a strong śaktipāta and gradual inthe case of a weak one. It is such a profound “game-changer” that those who havenot had this awakening often find it hard to believe such a thing could be realand suppose it to be the product of wishful thinking, an overactive imagination,or a diseased mind. But those who have had it never doubt that they have beengiven a glimpse of the hidden order of things, of something much more real andmeaningful than that which most people call reality.My own experience of śaktipāta occurred at the age of sixteen through meeting apowerful and loving meditation master. It was not the product of wishfulthinking because I didn’t even want to be there, at least on the level of theconscious mind. My mother had persuaded me to take a two-day meditation retreatand I had acceded because I wanted the reward she was offering me; I had neitherexpectation nor hope that anything particularly magical would happen. Andindeed, the whole thing was fairly boring, though in the final meditation of theweekend, I did make a grudging effort to be fully present in the warm, darkstillness of the meditation room. It was nice, but nothing special, until Iopened my eyes and walked outside. I was astonished to discover that the wholeworld had apparently changed. Everything was more vivid and real, and almostsparkling. Not only that, I was feeling an incredible energy in my heart, and itwas flowing palpably between my heart and the hearts of everyone else I couldsee. I call it “energy” for lack of a better word; it was a tangible power orforce, not a passive feeling, and it had the nature of exquisitely pure love. Itwas connecting the hearts of all the people around me, coursing freely in a kindof web or grid of power, entirely independent of whether these people liked eachother or not. Then I noticed it was really everywhere; the very air around meseemed thick with it; it was undoubtedly the most “real” thing in reality,though not perceptible with any of the five senses! It was astonishing, and Iwas never the same, now that I knew this power, this love beyond anything I hadever imagined, was a real possibility in human life. I continue to cultivate anddeepen that experience, hold that perspective, and try to live from that place.The experience initiated the unfolding of a process that I have in turnfacilitated and resisted, but since then there has never been a possibility ofplaying any other game in life.Śaktipāta is referred to with the word “grace” because this awakening is notearned by being a “good person” and can come to anyone at any time. As AbhinavaGupta says, “Śaktipāta and devotion to the Divine are independent of family,caste, body, actions (karma), age, religious practices, and wealth.” Thispowerful infusion of grace is commonly experienced by those who come intocontact with a fully awakened being, such as a meditation master. However, weshould note here that the modern notion that śaktipāta is something given by aguru is not what we find in the ancient tradition, where the understanding isthat śaktipāta always comes from God, and the guru is simply one possibleconduit for it. The confusion on this issue is due to the conflation of the twoterms śaktipāta and dīkṣā (initiation): while śaktipāta is spontaneous and canflow through virtually any conduit, initiation is always given by a guru.(Though śaktipāta can of course spontaneously occur during an initiation.) Moreon this to come.Since it transcends individual will, there is nothing that can be done totrigger śaktipāta, other than ardently praying for it and trying to be as openas possible toward it. As you might have intuited by now, to reserve initiationonly for those who had had this awakening experience was an attempt to createauthentic spiritual community, groups of people for whom religion was not civicor cultural or political but a deeply felt experiential reality. Of course, howoften this ideal was actually fulfilled in practice, we have no way of knowing.Still, it is clear that the idea was widespread in the tradition that allinitiates should have received this infusion of divine grace. Let’s look at someof the signs of śaktipāta described in the scriptures.Those embodied souls on whom Śakti descends, for the cessation of their bondage,show these signs: eagerness for liberation; aversion to remaining in the mundaneworld of delusion and suffering [saṃsāra]; devotion toward the devotees of God;faith in their teacher and rites. (Mṛgendra-tantra)The Descent of Power erodes the impurity (of one’s separate individuality),which is the cause of the cycle of suffering. When that has waned, the desire togo to the highest, unsurpassed beatitude arises. Having obtained a guide [=guru], who cuts his bonds by initiation, he attains identity with God, free fromimpurity and affliction. (Svayambhuva-sūtra- sangraha)These passages represent the tradition’s mainstream view of śaktipāta, in whichit is more or less conceived of as “getting religion.” The nondualist textsdescribe śaktipāta more in terms of a powerful mystical experience: waves ofbliss, a feeling of oneness, spontaneous tears, trembling of the body, and soon. That is, the nondualists looked for more substantial signs of a realinfusion of divine energy, a greater inner shift than might be connoted bymerely becoming interested in the religious life.In his two masterworks, Light on the Tantras and Essence of the Tantras,Abhinava Gupta makes a sustained argument for understanding śaktipātanondualistically. In the latter he writes:In our tradition that holds to the View of the nonduality of the autonomousHighest Divinity, it occurs in this way: the Highest Divinity, as a play ofhiding His true nature, becomes a bound soul, an individual, a contracted being,and yet there is no contradiction of His true nature in manifesting within thecircumscribed divisions of space, time, and a particular form. As anothercomplementary expression of the same play, when bringing to an end theconcealment of his true nature, and experiencing a return to that true natureinstantly or gradually, He is called an individual soul that is a fit vessel forśaktipāta. And He is Supreme Śiva throughout this whole process, whose essenceis simply His total autonomy: the one who causes Power to descend. (Tantrasāra:ch. 11)In this beautiful passage, Abhinava argues that “the Highest Divinity” and “thecontracted individual soul” are just different names for one Consciousness intwo different states or phases. Thus, though śaktipāta remains here an act ofgrace, it is in fact an act of gracing yourself because in your ultimate natureyou are that grace-bestowing power of God. Śaktipāta is a profound moment ofturning a corner at the deepest level of your being: a choice made by yourŚiva-self to begin to bring the contracted phase of existence to an end byinitiating the process of expanding back into the fullness of your true nature.In a parallel passage in Light on the Tantras Abhinava writes, in reference to astatement from the dualists that God “waits for the right time” to bestow hisgrace on someone who is “fit”:The “particular time” [kāla] that is referred to is that of a particularactivity [kalanā], consisting of awareness, directed toward one’s own nature.The “fitness” is in our philosophy said to be the quality of being finally readyfor the spiritual process [yoga] of identification with the Divine. Thus thequestion “Why did it happen only then, why not before?” is not appropriate. Forthere is no occasion whatsoever for the manifestation of the Descent of Poweraside from this. But when his Power does shine forth in this way, due to hisautonomy, the power of time cannot contradict this expansion, it being simply aform of his majesty, arising within God. (Tantrāloka: 13.204–7)The dualists suggest that one may earn śaktipāta through religious actions andgood works, an idea to which Abhinava is fiercely opposed. Śaktipāta cannot, forhim, be an issue of merit, because otherwise we relegate it to the world ofkarma, not of divine grace. He writes:“But surely,” an objectioner might say, “those who attain the state ofliberation do so through worship [pūjā], mantra repetition [japa], meditation,zealous service of God [sevā], and so on. How then can their attainment beindependent of actions?” It is not like this, we [nondualists] say. Let us beginfirst by investigating why in the first place such people engage in things suchas mantra repetition, meditation on the transcendent Divine, and so on. . . . Ifyou say the cause is the Lord’s Will, then the one and only form of that causeis the Descent of Power [śaktipāta]. (Tantrāloka: 13.259–62)Thus Abhinava makes the interesting argument that rather than “good works”drawing God’s grace, it is only through grace in the form of śaktipāta that onecan have any real capacity for, or sustained interest in, such spiritualpractices. This accords with his view that śaktipāta marks the beginning of thetrue spiritual path, not some point of merit reached along the way. Further, allactivities on that path are an expression of divine Power, and thus are not partof the normal karmic set-up. This is because their purpose is, according to him,to bring about identification with one’s true nature and not to produce changewithin the matrix of ordinary reality as normal actions are intended to do. Heexplains,Mantra repetition and the other practices are expressions of the divine Power ofAction [kriyā-śakti], not karma. For “karma” in general usage is that whichgrants lower forms of experience and obscures the true nature of theexperiencer. (Tantrāloka: 13.262–3)In both works we have been quoting, Abhinava outlines nine types of śaktipāta,from the most to the least intense. We will briefly review these here,paraphrasing the account in Essence of the Tantras. Lest there be anymisunderstanding, I should perhaps note here that śaktipāta is not a generalterm to be used for any infusion of divine power (the general term would besamāveśa) but something that happens once or twice in one’s life.The strongest grade of śaktipāta is so powerful it brings about immediateliberation, a fierce and total awakening, with the unfortunate side effect thatthe intensity of the experience causes the body to drop (i.e., physical death).Needless to say, this is extremely rare. The second grade, also very rare,causes a spontaneous arising of intuitive insight, naturally leading to fullawakening. When this intuitive knowledge arises, if it rapidly grows tocompletion of its own accord, the recipient is said to be a “Self-revealedguru,” a giver of both enjoyment and liberation, displaying the six signs ofcompletion. On the other hand, if the intuitive insight is unsteady orincomplete, then s/he will need the scriptures and a teacher to confirm andstrengthen it. Depending on the steadiness or shakiness of one’s intuition,Abhinava says, one must perform self-refinement through the sacred vow ofdisciplined yoga practice, either by himself or as directed by a guru.The third grade is much more common and is the weakest grade of śaktipāta thatstill permits one to attain liberation in the same lifetime. One who hasreceived it experiences a strong desire to approach a true guru and has theintuition necessary to recognize such a teacher. In the recipient of the thirdgrade, the burning questions, “What is the Truth? Who knows that Truth?” leadone, through intuition or the company of spiritual friends, to develop thelonging to meet a master (Tantrāloka 13.222). If this desire is strong enough,says Abhinava, the longing will inevitably be fulfilled. Having met such amaster, attainment of insight into things as they are follows rapidly,culminating in living liberation.Abhinava notes that this is also the type of śaktipāta that helps one to leave afalse guru and approach a true master. He writes, “One thing alone marks a Guru:wisdom that is expertly put into practice” (Tantrāloka 13.333). A true guru(sadguru) is an awakened being of perfect integrity who can give transmission byany one of a number of means. Though a physically embodied guru is by far themost effective, if such is not to be found, then one can invoke a meeting with aguru in the dream-world or become a disciple of a master who has left his body,but only if that master is actually alive for you. That is to say, a fondnessfor the inspiring words of a deceased guru is insufficient—that guru must cometo you as a living force in dreams and visions, giving transmissions andchallenging you in your practice. In other words, the only way a relationshipwith a disembodied guru can be effective, according to the Tantra, is if thatperson is just as palpably present to you as a an embodied guru would be.Is a guru absolutely necessary? According to the Tantra, if you have notreceived the strongest grades of śaktipāta (#1 or #2), yes. Even though the guruultimately empowers you to a be a guru unto yourself, and that inner guru isyour final refuge, most of us are way too confused and disoriented to find thatrefuge on our own. According to the Kaula tradition, we all need the clarifyingempowerment of the guru’s transmission, some of us just once, others many times.The means of this transmission are hearing the guru’s words, being in his/hercompany, receiving his compassionate glance, reading scripture with him,practicing with him, receiving a mantra from him, seeing him perform a ritual,or direct transmission of energy; or some other, secret, means (Tantrāloka13.227-28). Note that these means of initiation can only be given by aself-realized guru and need not be given through the guru’s conscious intent. Ifyour karma has ripened and thus your “kindling” is dry, it will catch fire bymere proximity. Nor is it true that such a guru needs to know who you are on thesurface level (your history, psychology, etc.).The fourth grade of śaktipāta leads a person to take initiation, though hisperception of the divinity of his real Self is not as firm as a third-graderecipient, because it is difficult for him to break through his conditionedconvictions and mental constructs of reality. Nonetheless, through the gradualripening of his insight through practice, the fourth-grade recipient merges withthe Divine upon leaving the body. This and the following grades account for themajority of people on the path. (By “the path” I do mean to imply that there isreally only one path of spiritual transformation, regardless of what name it isgiven or which religion or culture it is articulated within.) The fifth andsixth grades are received by those who are ready for the spiritual life but whoalso have a strong desire for worldly enjoyment and prosperity. They thus seek,and find, a teacher who can support them in both endeavors. They practice a yogathat leads them to enjoyment and then to liberation, at the time of leaving thebody or shortly thereafter.The three lowest grades of śaktipāta are received by one whose desire forenjoyments is stronger than for liberation. These grades of awakening grant oneaccess to the path to enjoyment through yoga, culminating in liberation in afuture life. These grades are not given much attention in the texts, but it isimportant to note here that what grade of śaktipāta you receive is not due tohow “worthy” you are but to how intense your longing for awakening is inrelation to your longing to enjoy “the good life.” Though the latter isdescribed as the slower path, it is not denigrated by the Tantrik tradition. Infact, integrating your desire for abundance with your spiritual practice insteadof keeping it separate helps ensure that, in time, you will indeed attain thefinal goal. Abhinava writes:Because a yogī’s desire for enjoyment is fulfilled by means of the mantras andyoga of Śiva, that desire necessarily eventually culminates in liberation. Thuswe can still say such a one receives śaktipāta. So drawing divine grace in theform of the Descent of Power is most important even for those who desireenjoyments. (Tantrasāra: ch. 11)We turn now to examine the second, and closely related, prerequisite for thepractice of the Tantra: that of dīkṣā, or initiation."},{"pageContent":"dīkṣā:the rite of initiation and its effectsInitiation was the central rite of all forms of Tantra throughout most of itshistory. It served a crucial role in the psychology of the religion, for itaddressed the deep-seated cultural belief in karma, or the repercussion ofactions performed in past lives. Since the number of previous incarnations washeld to be incalculable, one’s storehouse of karma was vast, far more than couldbe resolved in a single life. This oppressive belief made the goal of radicalfreedom (mokṣa), the power to determine one’s own inner state, seem unreachablyremote. One of the most significant features of the new Tantrik teaching, then,was that the ceremony of initiation (dīkṣā)—or rather the divinely revealedmantras employed during that ceremony—liberated one from all karma destined tobear fruit in future lives, thereby bringing the goal of the path within thereach of a single lifetime. We need not concern ourselves with the metaphysicalquestion of whether this doctrine was “true,” since the empowering psychologicaleffect of the ceremony is clear enough—recipients of initiation believed that itworked, and thus they opened to the possibility of liberation in this life(jīvanmukti). The historical record attests that many did indeed attain thatgoal.In traditional Indian society, rites of passage were only given to those withthe proper adhikāra, which means something like “entitlement” or“qualification.” Adhikāra for initiation into Vedic study was determinedentirely by the caste and gender of one’s birth, so the Tantrik teaching thatcandidates for initiation were accepted on the basis of the evidence of theirśaktipāta alone (as adjudged by a qualified guru or ācārya), without referenceto other factors such as caste, class, gender, or ethnicity, was a radicaldeparture from the norm. (Initiates were expected to offer a substantialpercentage of their income as an acknowledgment of the inestimable value ofinitiation; if this rule of percentage-based offering was applied properly,however, it did not necessarily bar those of low income from initiation.)Receipt of initiation granted adhikāra in a slightly different sense: theprivilege and the obligation to study the scriptures.There were two levels of initiation: the samaya-dīkṣā, or probationaryinitiation for novices, and the full nirvāṇa-dīkṣā, or initiation that placedone on the irrevocable path to liberation (nirvāṇa). This elaborate two-dayceremony was sometimes dispensed with in the more radical Kaula branch of thetradition, in which (as we have seen) initiation could be granted by a fullyawakened master with a word, a glance, a touch, or a thought. The nondualistsbelieved that initiation, to be effective, must trigger a second śaktipāta,observable in the degree to which the initiate was affected by the ceremony.The first form of initiation, the samaya-dīkṣā, granted the initiate the rightand obligation to study the scriptures and begin a daily practice. Samayins, asthey were called, were required to take a vow that they would follow a strictcode of conduct (or samaya), a code set out in this endnote.137[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en137] Unmarried samayinswould usually live in the home of the guru to receive instruction, and also tobe observed during their probationary period. After some time (probably one tofive years), if they felt ready and were judged to be ready, they would take thefull initiation.The nirvāṇa-dīkṣā was the central rite of Śaiva Tantra in all its forms, acrossIndia and Southeast Asia. It was adopted with little change by the TantrikBuddhists, and we can see some elements of it preserved today in TibetanBuddhism. If the performance of nirvāṇa-dīkṣā is our primary measure of thesurvival of the Śaiva Tantrik tradition, then we must say that the traditionfinally died out in the early 20th century, when the last real nirvāṇa-dīkṣāswere performed. However, since Shaivism by that time existed also in puregnostic forms (insight-based instead of ritual-based), this rite need not be ourprimary measure of the tradition’s survival. (See the conclusion for discussionon this.) Because the ceremonial dīkṣā was so central to the tradition for solong, and because it is very beautiful, we will describe it briefly here. Thefirst of the two days of the ritual was performed for all students, whether theywere taking either the basic samaya-dīkṣā or the full nirvāṇa-dīkṣā; the secondday is only for those taking the latter.In preparation, the guru and his or her assistants created a sacred spacecentered on the initiatory maṇḍala (or sacred diagram) of that lineage. Themaṇḍala, anywhere from 12 to 35 feet in length, was carefully drawn with chalkand filled in with various colored powders, much like Tibetan Buddhist maṇḍalasstill seen today (which were originally derived from Shaivism in their basicdesign).A white canopy was suspended over the maṇḍala, with curtains of multicoloredcloth hanging from it on all four sides, concealing the maṇḍala from view andcreating a container for the energy to be generated. The inner side of thecurtain-walls was decorated with flags, pennants, and mirrors as well asgarlands of flowers, strings of little bells, and protective threads in fivecolors. Ghee-burning lamps were arranged around the perimeter of the space, thedozens of flames casting a warm glow. Also placed at various points around themaṇḍala were parasols, yak-tail whisks, and sacred bronze vases; the lattercontained a gold coin, were filled with water and flowers, and were decoratedwith a cloth belt and a flower garland.138[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en138][image/Tritrishulabjamandala.jpg]At the appropriate points on the maṇḍala the guru installed the energies of thedeities (considered as aspects of the one Deity by the nondualists), in the formof their mantras, thus enlivening the sacred diagram. These sonic or “mantric”forms of the Divine are, paradoxically, both the primary instruments of worshipand that which receives the worship being offered. This worship takes the formof recitation of the mantras, concentration on their visualized forms, andelemental offerings of flowers, fire, incense, bell, and water. The guruperforming the rite first meditates on his identity with Deity, who will performthe initiation through him.Traditionally, between one and five initiands gathered for the ceremony.Standing outside the canopied sacred space, the initiand(s) were consecratedwith mantras, holy water, sacred ash, and darbha grass. Then they wereblindfolded and led into the sacred space, where they each threw a flower ontothe maṇḍala. The section of the maṇḍala that the flower lands on determineswhich form of the Deity the initiand will subsequently worship and alsodetermines which initiation-name the initiand will be given. After receiving thename, the initiand’s blindfold was removed and s/he saw the secret maṇḍala forthe first time, glowing with the mantra-powers that had been installed into it,at the center of the exquisitely prepared sacred space. This point in theceremony was such a magical moment, we are told, that many initiands would burstinto tears of joy and others tremble, laugh, or faint. Abhinava says that atthis moment the mantra-powers of the maṇḍala enter the body of the disciple,protecting and empowering her.139[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en139]The next key element of the ritual is the Śiva-hasta-vidhi, the rite of layingon a mantra-empowered hand. The guru or ācārya installs the mantras in his righthand, worships them, and when he feels his hand vibrating with energy, he placesit upon the initiand’s head. This powerful moment begins the process of thestudent’s becoming one with the mantric powers of her divine identity. Next,offerings were made to the initiand as an embodiment of the Divine and to aconsecrated sacred fire; these included offerings that removed the caste of theinitiand (a radical idea, since many in Indian culture believed that caste was apermanent inherited trait) and gave him a status equal to that of the highestcaste, regardless of his background. Of course, Indian society in general wouldnot acknowledge this change, but it must have had a strong psychological impacton the initiate, creating a sense of an inner, truer, secret identity within thesocially constructed persona.The guru then performed an elaborate meditative visualization in which he fusedthe central channel (suṣumnā) of his subtle body with the central channel of theinitiand. Then, through meditative visualization and special mudrās, the gurufused his own consciousness—his soul if you will—with that of the initiand andraised it through his own central channel, passing through the stations of thedeities (cakras), thus elevating it to a higher state before infusing thispurified and elevated consciousness back into the initiand’s body. This yogicprocess concluded the first day; those undergoing the full nirvāna-dīkṣā laydown to sleep and dream in the sacred space.The next morning, after discussion with the guru about the dreams the initiandhad, the primary fire-ritual began. This consisted of a ritual process thatincinerates all the disciple’s karmas, or effects of past actions, destined tobear fruit in future incarnations. This was done so that the disciple would beable to attain liberation in the current lifetime. Of course, karma destined tobear fruit in the current lifetime is left untouched. How are the other karmasburned? Through a complex process of visualization, mantra, fire-offerings, and(for lack of a better phrase) the manipulation of consciousness. To give anexample of the technicalia of this ritual, at one point the guru vividlyimagines the the endless wombs in which this soul is destined to be incarnated,then summons the Goddess of the Supreme Word (Vāgīśī, Parāvāk), visualizing Heras pervading those wombs, then enters the initiand’s body through his (theguru’s) outbreath, separates the initiand’s consciousness from his/her heart,draws it out through the top of his/her head with the ankuśa-mudrā, breathes itdown into his own heart with the saṃhāra-mudrā, holds kumbhaka breath whilemeditating on the principal mantra, raises it to the dvādaśānta point above hishead, takes hold of it and with the gesture of throwing forward from theupturned fist (bhava-mudrā), incarnates it simultaneously in all those wombs.Then, with fire-offerings, he rapidly fast-forwards through the lives of allthose incarnations simultaneously, performing their life-cycle rituals, causingtheir karmas to fructify and then dissolve harmlessly.140[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en140] This is, in fact, agreatly simplified and abbreviated description.The guru then separated the soul of the initiand from the bonds of āṇava-mala,māyīya-mala, and kārma-mala, and offered up the eight elements of his/her subtlebody to the five Cause-deities.141[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en141] Finally, theculmination of the ritual arrived, the rite of fusing the initiand’sconsciousness with the Divine Absolute (śiva-yojanikā). No details of this willbe given here; suffice to say that on one level it centers on successfullyraising the soul (i.e., the locus of individual awareness) up the centralchannel to the dvādaśānta, the level of the Absolute at the upper limit of one’ssubtle body. The resultant experience, if it is perceptible to the initiand (nowan initiate), is merely a taste of the final liberation s/he will experience.Whether the experience is perceptible is dependent on the strength of theśaktipāta triggered by this climactic act of fusion with the Divine,142[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en142] but the effect in anycase is thought to be the same, which is that the initiate is now a potentiallocus for the manifestation of divinity; or to put it another way, the barriersto liberation in this life have been removed.Since the two key elements of the nirvāṇa-dīkṣā are destruction of the threeprimary bonds and (momentary) fusion of the soul with the Divine, when theKaula-influenced lineages claim that a powerful and charismatic guru caninitiate with simply a look, a word, or a touch, they are claiming that thoseacts can transmit sufficient spiritual power to accomplish both aspects ofinitiation.In an intriguing passage of the remarkable essay that appears at the end of hiscommentary on chapter 5 of the Svacchanda-tantra, Rājānaka143[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en143] Kṣemarāja addressescriticisms of the Śaiva doctrine of liberating initiation. The opponent argues,“Even after initiation, we see that character faults, together with thesaṃskāras [subtle karmic impressions] that give rise to them, are unaffected inthe initiate. So what have the mantras (of initiation) really done for him?”Kṣemarāja responds,Just as manipulative mantras can bring a heavenly beauty under the control of anugly man without getting rid of his ugliness, similarly the liberating mantras[of initiation] undo the power of the three bonds, but they do not necessarilyquell attachment, aversion, and their products. (Svacchanda-tantra-uddyota)For that, he implies, spiritual practice is necessary. He goes on to say,And also, we have seen, on hundreds of occasions, that there is a quelling ofattachment and aversion immediately after initiation for those who have beenpurified by an intense śaktipāta.Kṣemarāja here testifies that in his lineage, real transformation often isobserved after initiation, and he links that shift to the strength of theśaktipāta, not to the initiation ritual itself. Kṣemarāja answers the objectionthat some initiations are given in which the initiate feels nothing. He writes,If the objection is, “Why does this manifestation of divinity due to initiationnot take place at that very time?” Then we reply: In fact, we do see thatmanifestation occurring, countless times, in the case of those initiationsperformed by those Gurus possessed of the highest insight.The only factor that can influence the effectiveness of initiation apart fromthe initiand’s ripeness is the guru’s degree of access to the energy of trueinsight. Perhaps this is why the Kaula lineages emphasize the transmission ofpower from the perfected guru that triggers śaktipāta as the “trueinitiation.”144 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en144] A finalquote from Kṣemarāja, from the same source, aptly sums up our discussion of therelated concepts of śaktipāta and dīkṣā:Therefore, purification of the self—destroying the bonds of āṇava and so on andbestowing capability for the manifestation of Divinity—is achieved throughinitiation, which is accomplished following the Descent of Power [śaktipāta],which is inferred by observing the disciple’s devotion, their spontaneous desireto approach a guru, and so on. This is taught in the sacred tradition with thisverse:“The essence of insight [into one’s true nature] is given; the saṃskāras ofbeing a bound soul are destroyed. Therefore, [because] it involves giving [dī]and destroying [kṣi], it is known in our system as dīkṣā.”The question of whether someone today could take up a Tantrik practice, or thepractice of yoga in a Tantrik mode, without śaktipāta or dīkṣā is addressed inthe conclusion. Here I will only mention that the practices are said to bemarkedly less effective without śaktipāta (for example, mantras have little tono potency). If you have had some success in sādhanā and then receive śaktipāta,it’s like getting an injection of rocket fuel. If you have not yet experiencedthis profound awakening, this powerful infusion of divine grace (rudra-śakti),though there is nothing you can do to make it happen, you can greatly increaseits likelihood by ardently praying for it, stoking the fire of your longing, andpracticing being as open to it as possible. If the spiritual path is thedominant feature of your life and you can palpably feel the effects of the yogicpractices and mantras, then you have received śaktipāta and just didn’t have thename for it.In the case of dīkṣā the issue is more complex; some type of initiation, or aceremony that has the same effect, would seem to be required for authenticTantra. And that ceremony cannot be an exact replication of the originalnirvāṇa-dīkṣā, for reasons that will be addressed in the conclusion.the role of the guruWestern sentiments about the figure of the guru are often highly charged andpolarized, with strong feelings for and against. Though the Indian tradition hasalso expressed a wide range of opinions over the centuries, the centrality ofthe guru in every kind of Tantra cannot be denied. As far as the originaltradition is concerned, you must have a living guru to be a Tāntrika, though theextent of the direct involvement of that guru in your spiritual life might vary.One model that was probably followed quite a lot was that of taking samaya-dīkṣāat a relatively young age, for example between sixteen and twenty-four, andliving for a period in the guru’s home (guru-kula) with other samayins. Thisallowed the initiate to receive a thorough grounding in the system while beingobserved in this probationary period as to suitability for the fullnirvāṇa-dīkṣā. Usually, after receiving the latter, the initiate would become anindependent householder. As a householder, s/he would take turns with otherdisciples of the guru in sponsoring regular gatherings at the guru’s home forritual, satsang, eating together, and receiving the guru’s teachings. Asmentioned, this is one model of how a community of co-initiates (guru-kula)would function. There were probably others.We have alluded to the difference between the right-current’s picture of theguru as priest and teacher of the doctrine (= ācārya) and the Kaulaleft-current’s picture of the guru as liberated master who can transmit theactual experience of one’s essence-nature. Practitioners undoubtedly had verydifferent relationships with these two different types of gurus. For example,Abhinava Gupta tells us that he had a number of different gurus and studied invarious lineage traditions, but it was not until he found his sadguru that hefinally attained the highest state, through opening his heart totally to theembodied wisdom of his Master. In Tantrāloka 1.16 he describes his own state asbodha-ujjvala, “aflame with awakened Consciousness,” a state he says is due todevotion both to his guru Śambhunātha and the latter’s consort, a devotion which“removed the poison of the bonds that [cause the perception that] anything isother than that Consciousness.” He further praises the guru-disciplerelationship in a beautiful verse we have already cited:May all contemplate the lotus of the heart of Abhinava Gupta, < its blossomopened by the light falling from the rays of the sun, || its contraction foreverbanished by the wisdom descending from the feet of the illuminator, > [my guru]Śambhunātha. (Tantrāloka 1.21)There was in principle nothing stopping a person from taking initiation frommore than one guru, provided that each subsequent initiation is a higher one(i.e., you could not go to another guru for the same kind of initiation you hadalready received due to your doubts about its efficacy). As Abhinava describes,some people thus progressed through a series of initiations, each one higher,more specialized, and more secret than the last.In time, the disciple could progress to the role of guru, though this was nevera self-appointed role. In order to take up the office of guru, you must havereceived a consecration (called abhiṣeka) from your own guru. Contrary to whatWesterners might expect, there was not a particular level of spiritualattainment that qualified you for this role. You would be consecrated basedsolely on whether your guru thought you capable of initiating and instructingothers. Thus, the title of “guru” was no guarantee of a particular spiritualattainment—which seems to me a very intelligent system, since it requiresdevotees to exercise their own discernment in assessing this.guru-yogaAs we see in the rules for samayins (see endnote 137), the figure of the guruwas treated with special reverence. You were to practice seeing your guru asLord Śiva made flesh,145[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en145] either when s/he wasengaged in ritual practice and formal teaching (right current) or all the time(left current). This was of course done for the spiritual benefit of thedevotee, not the guru. In time a practice of guru-yoga developed in the Tantriktradition, in which one’s guru is contemplated in inner meditation as identicalwith Supreme Śiva. This sort of thing makes the Western mind, attached as it isto the value of independent self-determination, quite nervous. Many I’ve talkedto criticize the practice of guru-yoga, and all paths that recommend it, becauseof the various abuses perpetuated by fraudulent gurus over the years. But thisonly indicates a misunderstanding of the practice. One does not in fact need torelinquish one’s self-determination, or at any rate not to another human being.There is simply nothing in the practice of guru-yoga that indicates the discipleought to give up her capacity for independent critical thinking. Though thismight seem very strange, the practice of seeing one’s guru as Lord Śiva does notrequire one to actually believe he is Śiva. That is, in this practice, one isnot engaging with the guru as human being at all but as divine Essence. One doesnot, therefore, need to “divinize” his personality or convince oneself that hishumanity fits an abstract ideal of perfect conduct that in fact no one can everachieve. Indians seem to understand this principle instinctively and canpractice guru-yoga assiduously without necessarily paying attention to anythingtheir guru says that is not coming from a very deep place. Not understandingthis has been responsible for some tragic self-brainwashing on the part ofWestern disciples of gurus, and some of these gurus have, unfortunately, beenhappy to go along with it (though if the gurus were Indian, they may not evenhave realized the delusive psychological state the Western devotee was in). Inthe end, according to this tradition, it is up to individuals to keep their witsabout them and exercise discernment; and if they fail to do so, and are taken bya fraudulent guru, they have no one to blame but themselves.Having said this, a few more words on the practice of guru-yoga. Though it maybe attended by all kinds of visualization exercises and inner or outer rituals,what is at root is the simple practice of using your guru as an “icon ofessence,”146 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en146] projectingonto him and seeing in him the Absolute light of divine Consciousness. Thislight exists in everyone; but it is only through a resolute practice that onecan come to see it in anyone. The principle here is “Love one personcompletely—love the whole universe.”147 This practice does not entail debasingoneself in any way; paradoxically, you must have great self-respect to undertakeguru-yoga, for it is a means of actualizing the guru’s own state in yourself.Thus the sense the disciple has is one of equality between his guru and himself,although the two sides of the equation are expressed potential and unexpressedpotential respectively, an understanding that keeps the disciple humble.Now, I have implied that this practice has everything to do with the disciple’sown efforts and nothing to do with the guru. However, the more perfectlyintegrated the guru actually is with the Absolute, the less difficult it is forthe devotee to practice guru-yoga. That is, it is easier to follow the sādhanāof seeing the guru as divine if his state of union with the Divine is more orless complete and his conduct is, therefore, not much of a bar to thatsādhanā.147 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en147] Thus, weare met with the (to the Western mind) bizarre paradox that the less evolved theguru is, the more perfect must be one’s devotion to him. And if you have thekarmic misfortune to be working with a false guru, your devotion must beabsolutely sublimely perfect for the guru-yoga to work (of course, if youactually realize that is the situation, you will probably choose to move on).This might sound dangerous to you, unless you remember that guru-yoga is notnecessarily about doing everything your guru tells you—discernment must alwaysbe operative in that dimension, for you cannot shortcut your individual processof realization. The practice of seeing the guru as divine in spite of his humanflaws—in other words, of having unconditional love for him—is preparatory toextending that sentiment to all other beings. There is further discussion ofthis in this endnote148 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en148]and in the conclusion.We turn now to the specific practices of Śaiva Tantra.upāya: the three skillful means to liberationOne of the key teachings of the great master Abhinava Gupta, which influencedmuch of the rest of the Tantrik tradition, was that of the three upāyas, orSkillful Means to Liberation. These are three different modes of cultivatingliberating spiritual insight; though they are distinct, they all lead to thesame goal, that of samāveśa, or continuous immersion into divine Reality. Thegoal can be reached, says Abhinava, through śāmbhava-upāya, the method ofaccessing Consciousness through direct intuition; through śākta-upāya, themethod that emphasizes working with the energy of thought-constructs and thefeelings they produce; through āṇava-upāya, the method that emphasizes thephysical body, breath, and imagination; or through all three, simultaneously orsequentially. The three upāyas are shown in tabular form below.In our presentation of the categories of Tantrik philosophy, we nearly alwayshave proceeded through the given map of reality from the “bottom up” (e.g., fromEarth to Śiva in the tattvas). In the presentation of the upāyas, however, weproceed from the “top down,” because in the domain of practice we always startfrom the highest. In part this is because it is possible that some aspirantswill “get it” right away through the most direct means of intuitive insight, andtherefore we want to offer them that opportunity. The vast majority, however,will need to resort to the various body-based practices to create the openingthat makes such insight possible. Indeed, it is almost always the case thatthose for whom the most direct method (śāmbhava-upāya) succeeds immediately havealready worked to create a clear, aligned, and open body-mind.Method(upāya)OperativePowerLevel ofExperienceCenterProcessThe Divine Means Śāmbhava-upāyaWillingicchā-śaktiUnityabhedaspirit/intuitionnonsequentialakramaThe Empowered Means Śākta-upāyaKnowing jñāna-śaktiUnity-in-Diversitybhedābhedaheart-mind/energysequential-cum-nonsequentialkramākramaThe Individual Means Āṇava-upāyaActingkriyā-śaktiPluralitybhedabodysequentialkramaSince Tantrik practice seeks nothing less than a total integration of our being,the realization of ourselves as an undivided, unitary mass of awakenedconsciousness, it makes sense that Abhinava discusses Tantrik sādhanā assomething that must function on all three levels of body, heart-mind, andspirit.149 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en149] Even if weprimarily pursue one of the three modalities, it must necessarily come to entailthe other two in order to achieve its perfection. Thus, as we progress inpractice, these three distinct parts of ourselves (body-mind-spirit) start toseem less and less distinct, until, as Abhinava says, the nectar of blissfulself-awareness floods and overflows the internal dams that divide us, dissolvingall distinctions. Then we experience ourselves as one united whole, a mass ofblissfully self-aware Consciousness (cidānanda-ghana), spontaneously respondingwith the whole of our being to each moment of experience.an-upāya: the “non-means”Before we discuss the three upāyas proper, let us look first to what AbhinavaGupta calls the “non-means.” This applies only in the very rarest of cases; itconsists of a śaktipāta awakening so intense that one single teaching from atrue guru is enough to stabilize that awakening permanently. For such a one,there is no need for practice at all, unless we count the brief period in whichs/he ponders on the teaching of the guru, absorbing it successfully into everylevel of her being.Teaching this an-upāya level can be dangerous, for often someone who has had avery powerful awakening mistakes it for final liberation and believes themselvesabove and beyond any need for sādhanā. Such a mistake is tragic, for if believedfor too long, it cannot be rectified in the same lifetime, in which case thegreat śaktipāta that person received, which could have been for the benefit ofall beings, is wasted. Though it may be surprising to hear, even very powerfuland very pure awakenings can turn into delusions if misunderstood. Worse, ifsuch an individual appoints themselves a guru, they incur extremely seriouskarmic repercussions by deluding others as well. Be warned: such a person mayhave the powers and charisma of a minor god and still be deluded and dangerous.How can you tell? By a careful and sober assessment of the real spiritualattainment of his community of followers. Note that the anecdotal evidence ofone or two followers of a guru whom you know is insufficient; to have anadequate sample size for evaluation, you must spend a little time in that guru’scommunity.Having said that, there are upon very rare occasions, beings that attaineverything in a very short time without any formal spiritual practice. A20th-century example is that of Bhagavān Nityānanda, who was established in thehighest state by age eighteen without doing any formal sādhanā. Such beings aresaid to have done extremely dedicated sādhanā in previous lives.Abhinava Gupta gives an example of the sort of teaching that, when pondered andassimilated by such a one, is all that is necessary to take him or her to thehighest state: I translate it below. This is an example of a completeteaching—if only you truly understood and thoroughly felt it, if only you couldallow its implications to ramify through every level of your being, it wouldliberate you forever. However, if you are like 99.9% of human beings, it willhave no such effect, in which case you must do spiritual practice, removing thevarious veils of ignorance until the same Truth you’ve heard a hundred or athousand times before finally bursts fully into vibrant life in every cell ofyour being.Take a deep breath now, center yourself, and see if you can feel just a littlebit of the power of a pure Truth-statement (śuddha-vikalpa). Abhinava heredescribes the spontaneous unfolding of wisdom in one who has heard andunderstood his guru’s declaration of Tat-tvam-asi, “You are that Reality.”This very Highest Divinity, the self-manifest Light of Consciousness, is alwaysalready my very own Being—when that is the case, what could any method ofpractice achieve? Not the attainment of my true nature, because that iseternally present; not making that nature apparent, because it is constantlyilluminating itself; not the removal of veils, because no “veil” whatsoeverexists; not the penetration into That, because nothing other than It exists toenter It. What method can there be here, when there is an impossibility ofanything separate from That?Therefore, this whole existence is One reality: Consciousness alone—unbroken bytime, uncircumscribed by space, unclouded by attributes, unconfined by forms,unexpressed by words, and unaccounted for by the ordinary means of knowledge.For it is the cause, through its own Will alone, by which all these sources oflimitation—from time to the ordinary means of knowledge—attain their ownnatures. This Reality is free and independent, a mass of bliss, and That aloneam I; thus the entire universe is held as a reflection within me. (Tantrasāra:ch. 2)Though represented here in words, this an-upāya experience is usually entirelywordless; it could unfold in a few seconds or over the course of several weeks.There is no need for one who has had it to self-identify as one who has had it(indeed, that would be proof otherwise), for confirmation will come in time fromone’s guru and from the evidence that the revelation of the nature of Realityhas taken root and is abiding."},{"pageContent":"śāmbhava-upāyathe divine meansThe subtlest—that is, the most refined, direct, and difficult to grasp—of thethree upāyas is that called śāmbhava. Though it is a method, there are nopractices as such at this level, at least none that can be explained in ordinarywords, for this level transcends all conceptual thought. I will summarize thesalient features of the “Divine Means,” then we will unpack them. As you can seein the chart above, śāmbhava works with and requires only the Power of pure Will(icchā-śakti), the spontaneous creative upsurge of Consciousness, as well as themetapower of Autonomy (svātantrya-śakti). It is the direct intuition we can haveof pure Being by bringing attention to the upsurge of the dynamic flow ofConsciousness’ will to perceive (totally independent of what is perceived). Suchintuition (pratibhā) results in wordless insights into some facet of the truththat blossom spontaneously and in an instant. It emphasizes subjectiveawareness, not objective, especially the transcendental unity of the subjectwith all he perceives. It accesses the spacious and expansive sky of pureConsciousness (cidākāśa). This level of awareness functions “within theundivided realm of Śiva’s pure Consciousness, which, free of allthought-constructs, [constitutes] the universal subject who contains withinhimself all objectivity.”150[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en150] In other words, theśāmbhava level is the level of total unity-consciousness into which all apparentduality is subsumed. But it reaches beyond unity-consciousness as well, forultimately it accesses the infinitely vast stainless void of the Mind of Śivathat transcends both existence and non-existence—containing within it all thatis and all that is not.In teaching the “practice” of śāmbhava-upāya, we can emphasize three primaryaspects. The first is that this upāya is a way of grace. The practice of itconsists primarily of opening to grace in every moment. One who is truly readyto practice on this level sees no distinction between the spiritual and themundane and moves through the world expecting (and therefore finding) divineteachings and learnings around every corner. She sees the guru not just in herteacher but in all beings. She realizes and feels that grace is being offeredconstantly and, therefore, ceaselessly opens to receive it. She sees the divineLight in all people and situations. Though not yet constant, that is herbaseline. (As you might have noticed, on the śāmbhava level path and goal arenot sharply distinguished.) Working the śāmbhava-upāya involves the way you movethrough the world; it touches all the moments of life in which you are not doingformal spiritual practices. If you are always just “going about your business,”believing you know who you are and what you are doing, you will miss many of thesubtle unexpected movements of grace that are constantly being offered to you.Hence you cultivate a kind of divine unknowing here, for not knowing can be astate of openness and aliveness. This upāya invites you to explore the delicateand expansive joy of hovering on the knife-edge of divine uncertainty.The second aspect of the practice of śāmbhava is the Spanda teaching of“catching hold of the first moment of perception,” or rather “bringing attentionto the initial arising of an energy state” (different ways of translatingunmeṣa-daśā-niṣevaṇa). In this practice, you tune in to the will to perceive thearising of each new experience, before the analytical and labeling mind getsinvolved. You can learn, through moment-to-moment nonanalytical awareness ofyour energy state, to become sensitive to the arising throughout the day of anymood, state, or feeling. Rather than leap to the thought, “This is hunger,” or“This is sadness,” or “This is contentment,” you simply notice the initialsubtle shift and rest in what that particular vibration feels like. If yourinterpretations of experience follow too closely upon the arising of experience,as they do for most people, you may not be ready to practice this subtle upāya.But for those whose minds have slowed down sufficiently (usually throughmeditation) to parse the phases of cognition, there is the possibility of“catching hold” of the initial burgeoning of a perception and dwelling in thesimple flowing of awareness itself, prior to any application of mentalunderstanding. As Abhinava writes in Light on the Tantras,That which shines forth and is directly grasped in the first moment ofself-aware perception, the single ground free of differentialthought-constructs, is said to be the pure Impulse [to directly perceiveConsciousness]. Just as an object appears directly to one whose eyes are openwithout the intervention of any determinate cognition, so for some does Śiva’snature.151 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en151] (Tantrāloka1.146–7)Such a practice is virtually impossible in the lifestyle of the averageAmerican, bombarded as it is with stimuli of all kinds. The “noise floor” issimply too high. But if you have created sufficient space and silence in yourlife to simply be aware of the subtle movement of energy as each new state ofthe body-mind arises, several times each day, it becomes a fantastic opportunityto fall into easeful harmony with what is. There is of course no question hereof trying to change what arises, for such a desire comes into being only afterthe mind has labelled what is arising as bad or undesirable; and this practiceis about the movement into vikalpa-free perception.For help in understanding the śāmbhava-upāya (although, of course, the onlypurpose to an intellectual understanding of it is to get the mind on board withthe process of its own negation), we may turn again to theVijñāna-bhairava-tantra. Though in general śāmbhava-upāya cannot be explained,and there are therefore few attempts to do so, this atypical scripture includesa number of Zen-like techniques that are labelled as śāmbhava-upāya byAbhinava’s disciple Kṣemarāja.152[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en152] These techniques entaildirectly accessing the space of pure consciousness with no support other thanone’s immediate perception of an object or state. For example, inVijñāna-bhairava verse 59, one simply allows one’s awareness to be absorbed inthe space within a jar or pot; in verse 60, one gazes at a vast open space or ablank wall; in verse 84, one looks up at the sky and allows one’s mind to becomelike it; in verse 89, one uses sensory deprivation to perceive the inner void;in verse 101, one focuses one-pointedly on the burgeoning of any intenseemotion. No instructions are given in the text: simply perceive and becomeabsorbed, allow the mind to dissolve, and entry into Śiva-consciousnessspontaneously occurs.Now, if you think this is easy, then you are probably mistaking a trance statefor this Śiva-state. Entering into trance states is not what is meant here, butsomething much more difficult for most people to attain: clear wakeful presence,effortlessly free of all thought-constructs. By contrast, a trance state isdull, numb, or sometimes pleasantly luminous but hazy, without sharp wakefulclarity. Even dwelling in the real Śiva-state for a few moments is a successfulbeginning to śāmbhava-upāya practice. However, if effort is involved, other thanthe subtle act of simply giving yourself into flowing presence, then you are notat śāmbhava-upāya level but rather āṇava-upāya. Śāmbhava feels more likesurrendering and opening than focusing. Finally, the practitioner of śāmbhavamust do regular contemplative inquiry into whether s/he is accessing trulynir-vikalpa states when practicing non-conceptual meditation or rather dwellingin a subtle vikalpa of meditation. (It’s okay if that doesn’t make sense yet.)If the latter is the case, more work at śākta and āṇava levels is needed.The third and final aspect of śāmbhava practice, an aspect that is veryimportant in the Trika, is working with mantras on nonconceptual levels.Nonconceptual mantras are ones that have no semantic value, no specific meaning,but are considered to be vibrations of the Divine (like oṃ, aiṃ, and hrīṃ). Inthis practice, the subtle (i.e., inaudible) phonetic units of the mantra areexperienced within, taking on their essential nature as modes of Śiva’sawareness. The practitioner directly accesses these modes of expandedconsciousness, which express fundamental potencies of the Divine, by means ofthe Sanskrit syllables that embody them. If engaged as a technique (e.g.,mantra-uccāra), this is in fact āṇava-upāya, and if engaged as a contemplation,it is śākta-upāya. However, there is a way to engage mantra practice as pureśāmbhava-upāya, in a little-understood technique by which you access icchā-śaktiby focusing on a given phoneme without its vowel component—an unpronounceableletter like a “vowelless k.” This is a kind of hovering on the edge of theimpulse to articulate. It’s like the feeling you have when you are about to dosomething, but you’ve forgotten what—except that instead of trying hard toremember, you simply remain on the leading edge of that “about to do” state.Since there is no way to explain śāmbhava in purely śāmbhava terms, it beingbeyond the mind, Abhinava resorts to a rather arcane presentation of the Trikadoctrine of linguistic mysticism in the chapter of the Tantrāloka that is meantto be devoted to śāmbhava-upāya (#3), a strategy that has confused many modernreaders of his text. One of the few scholars in the world who has workedsuccessfully to comprehend the material on linguistic mysticism is PaulMuller-Ortega, a scholar-practitioner and specialist in Abhinava Gupta. I offerhere a sample of Paul’s writing where he is mirroring Abhinava’s method (anddrawing also on the language of quantum mechanics) by providing a refinedśākta-upāya contemplation of a śāmbhava-upāya process.The process of parāmarśa, of setting up separate cognitions that will give riseto the phenomenal universe of everyday experience, is spelled out [by Abhinava]in terms of the coagulation or thickening of realities around interferencepatterns set up in the fundamentally unbroken and waveless Shiva. The vocalicorder of phonemes represents this order of powers that arise as two masses orcurrents of consciousness collide. In this way disturbances in the perfectsynchrony of the undivided self-referential consciousness arise and interferencepatterns occur. These disturbances are areas of patterned vibratory activitythat result from the merging of the śaktis. They could be understood toconstitute the generative matrices that give rise to finite objects and may beseen as discrete event areas.Reading the third chapter of Tantrāloka (or the corresponding account in theTantrasāra), which most people find extremely intellectual and difficult, givesa clue to the subtlety of access to the śāmbhava-upāya of linguistic mysticism.For in actuality, it is not a subject of intellectual philosophy but rather oneof direct nonconceptual experience of the phonemic energies of pureŚiva-consciousness. Thus, I argue, Abhinava’s account is meant to be understoodintuitively and through meditative insight, not at all intellectually.Śāmbhava-upāya is, to sum up, the immediate intuitive apprehension of the totalflow of reality as it is, free of thought-constructs, dawning within awarenessalready whole and complete (pūrṇa), even if momentary. The key concepts forunderstanding this upāya are 1) icchā, the precognitive impulse of consciousnesstoward self-awareness within a given perception, prior to any language,excepting that on the level of 2) paśyantī, the visionary stage of language,where phonemes vibrate in their pure essences as the building blocks of bothlanguage and manifest reality; 3) abheda, the unity of subjective awareness,enveloping all object-awareness; and 4) pratyakṣa, the direct perception of theground of Being as manifest in every moment of awareness, even the awareness ofnothing.In his summary verse for Essence of the Tantras, chapter 3, Abhinava Guptasings:The entire universe shines here within the Self, just as a complex creationappears in a single mirror. However, awake Awareness consciously articulates theuniverse as an expression of the nectarean sweetness of its ownself-awareness—no mirror can do that.153[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en153] || (Tantrasāra)This verse suggests that Abhinava’s focus on linguistic mysticism in hisdiscussion of śāmbhava-upāya is due to the fact that he sees articulation as thenatural result of the recursive quality within Consciousness by which it becomesaware of itself. Indeed, he uses the same word—parāmarśa—for both “phoneme” and“self-awareness.” Since the phonemes represent the building blocks of reality,we are to see the entire universe as consisting of varied expressions of theloving self-awareness of the Absolute."},{"pageContent":"śākta-upāyathe empowered meansThe Empowered Means focuses on shedding mental constructs that are not inalignment with reality (aśuddha-vikalpas) and the cultivation of wisdom, thatis, modes of understanding that are in alignment with reality (śuddha-vikalpas).The process of the cultivation of wisdom is precisely analogous to the practiceof yoga āsanas, for it challenges us to stretch our understanding by adoptingpostures of awareness. In adopting these postures, we seek to discover thealignments that create both greater strength and stability and greater ease andflow. We allow these postures to supplant old ways of holding ourselves and ourworld, ways that are not in alignment and thus create dis-ease. We will explorethis profoundly empowering process in depth.In śākta-upāya, it is the Power of Knowing (jñāna-śakti) that is predominant.Since this upāya does not utilize external supports, but rather emphasizes theprocess of cognition over objects cognized, it is appropriate for those who wishto work directly with the heart-mind. In Abhinava’s formulation, śākta-upāyaprimarily consists of refining, purifying, polishing, and perfecting our mentalrepresentations of reality (vikalpas) until they are fully aligned with thedivine order, the true nature of things. In simpler terms, we replace our“negative” or misaligned stories with “positive” or aligned stories. When ourmental representations become fully aligned with reality, they fall away, for wedon’t need them anymore. We can experience the beauty of reality without anystory at all. Thus śākta-upāya naturally terminates in śāmbhava-upāya, whereinthere is immediate intuitive apprehension of Reality without the intervention ofthe thinking mind.This means is related to the Goddess (śakti), for it focuses on energy(śakti)—primarily the energy that inheres in thoughts and the emotions that areinextricably linked to them. Now, one of the most fascinating critiques ofpopular Western notions of self that Indian philosophy can offer is this: “mind”and “heart” are two different names for one and the same thing; they merelyemphasize different aspects of that entity. That is to say, the Indian traditionholds that the locus of emotion and the locus of thought are one and the same,and therefore subconscious thoughts frequently manifest as emotions, andsubconscious emotions as thoughts.It takes a few minutes (or years) to fully assimilate the implications of this.For one thing, it thoroughly undermines the American tendency to privilegefeeling over thought or vice versa. A couple generations ago, people were taughtto trust their reason over and against their wayward, irrational emotions.Emotion was seen as an unreliable guide to action. Nowadays, by contrast, we aretold, “Listen to your heart,” which unfortunately often really means, “Get intouch with your deeper programming.” We are told, “Follow your heart,” whichunfortunately often is taken to mean, “Do what you want, putting aside reason,regardless of the consequences.” If you watch television interviews as a sample,it seems that no one asks for reasoned opinions anymore: “What’s your feeling onthat?” “I really feel that. . . ” which is usually just a way of giving anunthinking opinion that the person won’t be obliged to defend because, afterall, it is his feeling. I am critiquing this side of things more sharply becauseit is the current trend, but of course the other side is just as dangerous. Weall know someone who is extremely rational and intelligent, and whose failure tobe in touch with his human feelings enables him to perform actions that seeminhumanly insensitive.By contrast, a yogī seeking to make a wise decision will carefully and soberlyconsult all aspects of his being—thought, feeling, intuition, instinct—andbalance them all with the input of his teacher(s) and trusted friends. Heprivileges no one source over the others. To do so on a consistent basis, heknows, is to move ever further into dis-integration.background to this viewLet us investigate a bit further the implications of the fact that the Sanskritlanguage does not have two separate words for “mind” and “heart.” Both are usedto translate the word citta. (Of course, the essence or core of our being isalso sometimes called Heart [hṛdaya], but this is not at all the emotional heartthat is the realm of psychology and valentines.) Nor does Sanskrit have distinctterms for “thought” and “emotion.” Both are citta-vṛttis, “vibrations of themind-stuff” or “movements in the heart.” A little investigation will show thatthe ancient sages were absolutely right, and it is only through lack ofreflection that we picture ourselves as having two separate centers, one ofwhich can be privileged over the other. The implications of this are crucial onthe yogic path.First, it means that emotional states are often linked to a subconscious thoughtor thought-pattern. Whenever we are pulled from our natural state into acontracted state, we are almost always engaged in thinking about reality in away that gives rise to that particular mood. Disliking the mood, or dislikingyourself for having the mood—even if it is black depression, horrendousjealousy, or what have you—is missing the mark, for the mood expresses ournatural embodied intelligence and signals that self-reflection is needed. Naturenever acts without reason, and therefore every form of disease invitesreflection. (This should not of course be taken to mean that whatever terriblestate you find yourself in is “deserved.” That kind of thinking is nothing morethan a subtle form of self-hatred. Nor does it mean, “The universe is trying toshow me something.” That is often just the Judeo-Christian god of judgment underanother name.) When we investigate, being ruthlessly honest and radicallysincere with ourselves, we usually find that our “bad day” (or week, or month)was sparked by a negative thought-pattern, perhaps barely noticed at the time,which we believed and spun into a story, a picture of how reality is, one thatis untrue and is disempowering to us. Nothing can drain us of our life-forceenergy (prāṇa-śakti) faster and more effectively than a well-spun story(vikalpa) that is not in alignment with reality. The problem is, we are oftennot even aware of our stories. Specifically, the more the current story fits inwith our generalized picture of reality (our fears about how reality “reallyis”), the less it stands out in our awareness. It must be ferreted out withself-reflection. Most of the time, the stories that rob us of our natural stateare variations on the fundamental story that keeps us from Presence. Forexample, let’s say that early in the day you make a minor mistake that creates aproblem for someone. They get annoyed, but then see that the problem is not somajor, and they forgive you. As far as they are concerned, it’s done. Initiallyyou feel better, but then you go on to have a rotten day in which nothing seemsto go very well, and you are in a mild-to-severe bad mood until you get home andhave a beer or watch TV, buffering your current state rather than enquiring intoit. What has happened is simple but perhaps not obvious: the incident early inthe day reignited your persistent subconscious story that you “just aren’t goodenough,” or “always screw things up,” or whatever. Since you believe thatvikalpa at a fairly deep level, giving it just a little energy can make itsimmer away beneath your threshold of consciousness, shaping your experience ofreality all day long. Once this negative or cynical thought has been activated,you find more evidence to confirm it because now you are seeing reality fromthat perspective. This keeps the vikalpa stewing, and thus your day seems to gopoorly (which is really just a pointer to the fact that something inside isbeing projected outward). We often feel we need some counter to this simmeringnegative story, like a critical mass of praise from our Facebook friends, totemporarily douse it. But until we finally digest and dissolve that vikalpa,something else will always heat it up again . . . and again . . . . Does thissound at all familiar? It is the nature of the cyclical stew we call saṃsāra. Infact, it’s often called the ocean of saṃsāra, which means it’s a very big stew.After a lot of work in the śākta-upāya realm (which I will describe furtherbelow), I thought I was mostly free of vikalpas, those stories about realitythat remove us from natural flowing Presence. But, still, I had bad days. If youare really free of vikalpas, you will never have a “bad day” again. Painfulmoments, sure, maybe even a whole bunch of them in a row, but a whole day (orweek, or month) can only be “bad” with the help of stories. Knowing that, I hadto reflect. And I realized that I still had this subtle story going on: if a fewthings in a row went well, if things were just clicking into place, it triggeredthe vikalpa “I am blessed, I am specially favored, everything’s coming together,my life keeps getting better.” Well, what’s wrong with that, you might say. Theproblem is that a vikalpa exists in necessary relationship with its opposite. Aslong as we are caught in any pair of opposites, we move between the poles. Wecan’t ever just stay on one side. So, if a few things in a row went poorly forme, especially early in the day, the opposite vikalpa would get triggered:“Nothing’s going right, my life isn’t really going anywhere, nothing reallycomes together for me,” and I would get depressed, even though I wasn’tconsciously aware of the story. Though I’m able to state this plainly now, atthe time it was quite subtle. I wouldn’t really know why I was depressed until Idid self-enquiry, a self-enquiry whose ability to pierce through to reality wasgreatly aided by radical honesty—the kind of honesty that comes only when I dropany sense of shame to be thinking anything so absurd as what I had beenthinking.This is a good illustration of why we must eventually become free of vikalpasaltogether. For then we discover that having the wordless experience of “I amblessed” as the base reference point for our existence is very different frommerely having the vikalpa of it; a state of being need not give way to itsopposite, for it is not a construct. It has become reality.A popular misunderstanding, one that must be corrected here, is that if you areexperiencing a “negative” emotion, this is evidence that something is “wrong” orthat you are out of alignment with reality. While it is often true that holdinga view of things that is not in alignment will give rise to emotional states ormoods that we (or others) find unpleasant, if we articulate it as the previoussentence did, we are in danger of saddling ourselves with a sin/guilt paradigmin disguise. A Tāntrika strives to see every state of mind, every mood andfeeling, as a gift of the Goddess. The Tāntrika has two modes of learning abouther true nature: learning from states of expansion, and learning from states ofcontraction. It is an absolutely false view to think that one mode is betterthan the other, or to measure your worth as a human being or competence as ayogī on the basis of how much time you spend in an expanded state and how muchin a contracted one. True expansion into the fullness of your divine naturebegins when you radically relinquish all such dualistic judgments. Such trueexpansion takes little or no effort to maintain, for it means entering into ourtrue nature, whereas the dualistic type of expanded state takes effort tomaintain, for we are still caught in the pairs of opposites—and every pole musteventually give way to its opposite. It is the natural law.All states of mind, all emotions or moods, are vibrations of the śakti,manifestations of the one Goddess/power. Therefore, the Tāntrika experiencinganger, or fear, or desire, acknowledges that this is a vibration of energy, thatall energy is a manifestation of the Goddess, and therefore bows to her ownemotion (whatever it is) with heartfelt gratitude, saying “O Goddess, thank youfor coming in this form. What do you have to teach me?” Note how very differentthis posture is from the anxiety-ridden self-censorship of the so-called yogīwho believes he has fallen from grace or is out of touch with God because he isexperiencing a “negative” emotion. Such a person will not learn what thatemotion has to teach if his only goal is to get back to feeling good as soon aspossible. For such a person, the emotion will visit again and again, since hehas failed to open to it as a teacher and, thus, has failed to integrate itsenergy. There is an enormous amount of energy locked in “negative” emotions thatwe cannot avail ourselves of without this basic self-acceptance. When we riseabove self-condemnation and accept ourselves and what we are feeling, thatenergy naturally reveals its beneficial quality by pointing us to a deeperexperience of our authentic nature. So let us drop this term “negative emotions”altogether, since it usually means “emotions we should not be having.” On thispath, there is no such thing. Practicing on the śākta-upāya level means castingaside forever the notion that one state of mind is “better” than another, andthat you “should” be feeling this way or that. We accept what is. We work withwhat comes; we do our sādhanā on the basis of reality. Tāntrikas must not fearpain or intense feeling of any kind or think it ungodly, or they cut themselvesoff from a huge source of life-energy. Tāntrikas are sometimes called vīras,“heroes” or “adepts,” because it takes heroic courage to look clearly at ourpain and not push it away, saying, “That’s not me,” but rather embrace itspower. All emotions are energy, and all energy (śakti) can empower us.We should also note the flip side of the above paradigm: that thoughts are oftenlinked to hidden emotions. I was trained as an academic, and in the world ofacademia, we are taught to be “objective.” So academics and other intellectualstend to express their intellectual interests as though those interests exist ina vacuum, divorced from their feelings and humanity. But nothing exists in avacuum, and once you get to know an academic (especially in my field ofreligious and cultural studies), you discover that their specific intellectualprojects are in fact closely linked to their life history, psychology, andemotional landscape. By not acknowledging these forces that affect what point ofview we argue for, we are actually making ourselves less objective by virtue ofour lack of transparency. This hypocrisy or pretense in the academic world hasbeen painful for me as a scholar-practitioner who has, until now, been “in thecloset.” This book, which seeks to integrate my academic and spiritual life, isin part my own personal “cry in the wilderness” against the compartmentalizationof my humanity demanded by the culture of modern academia.If you are a “heady” person, not fully in touch with your feelings, you have atool in your hands now that you understand the link between thoughts andemotions that we have discussed. Note which opinions and views you holdstrongly, if seemingly dispassionately, and trace them to a place in your beingwhere they exist as pure emotion. For example, you may have strong opinionsabout what constitutes “justice” or “fairness.” I’ll wager that if you tracethese abstract views to your emotions, you might discover suppressed anger aboutthe time(s) when you were wronged. Seek it out and unlock its power.154[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en154]And when you do this, you are not so much moving from one center to another(such as from intellectual “mind” to emotional “heart”) as much as uncoveringthe hidden threads of energetic structures that are larger than you realized.Once again, thoughts and feelings exist as a continuum, where the “thought” endis defined by its wordiness, its rationalization, and partial suppression of thefull charge of the bhāva (“feeling, state of heart-mind”) in question, and the“feeling” end is defined by its lack of wordiness and appearance of the fullcharge of energy in the given bhāva. When we discover the feeling component of athought, or the thought hidden behind a feeling, we are bringing into fullawareness the totality of the condensed energetic structure, which helps revealits real nature and its effect on our reality.śākta-upāya in practiceOriented in this way, let us then investigate the method of śākta-upāya that theTantrik master Abhinava Gupta offers us in chapter 4 of his Tantrāloka andTantrasāra. As indicated above, he distinguishes between śuddha-vikalpa,thought-constructs (or “stories”) that are in alignment with the nature ofreality, and aśuddha-vikalpa, those that are not in alignment. Of course, novikalpa can express reality directly (i.e., nothing that can be articulated inwords is completely or permanently true), so we are freed from needless debateabout which propositions are “true” and which “false” and instead can focus onwhich are effective in bringing about direct experience of reality and which arenot. This, then, is the key difference between the two types of vikalpa: thenonaligned ones generate an endless series of further thought-constructs, asterile snake biting its own tail, whereas the aligned ones naturally lead youto (and then dissolve in) the wordless, storyless direct experience of reality:totally open, sharply real, and absolutely free. Have you ever had an argumentwith a loved one that went round and round in circles, until you got tired andfinally just forgave each other, without arriving anywhere or reaching any realunderstanding? When, by luck or discernment or help from your teacher, you lightupon a śuddha-vikalpa, it brings you to a point of profound touching-down in theexperience of reality as it is. Speaking such a truth brings about that momentwhen the heart begins to soften and melt, when your eyes start with tears, whenyou drop into deep connection with the other person in the conversation,regardless of who articulated the truth.The characteristic of ordinary vikalpas is that they create artificial mentaldivisions in the fullness of the one Consciousness that manifests as both selfand world. By contrast, purified and refined vikalpas that are highly distilled,carefully contemplated, lucid, precise, and that conform to the true nature ofreality help to bring about a liberative realization of that reality in itsfullness. In other words, these purified vikalpas have the unique feature ofpointing us beyond themselves to the raw, unmediated, nonconceptual experienceof the real. (aśuddha-vikalpa -> śuddha-vikalpa -> nirvikalpa.155[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en155]) How does this happen?Vikalpas are, for the most part, like programs downloaded from the Internet thataffect how your computer operates. We download programs from parents, teachers,television, and so on, from before the moment we can understand language onward.Some we are aware of; others manage to download themselves under our radar. Allthese programs get installed on the “hard drives” of our brains, and can evenrewrite the code of our operating systems. If we download and install a “virus”,it can take over completely, forming a limited view that seems impossible toescape. We start to work with śākta-upāya when we become aware that the way wesee and experience reality is largely (in some cases, entirely) dictated by thenetwork of programs that have been installed and that there are yet entirelydifferent ways of experiencing reality unavailable to us until we do somereprogramming. Studying and internalizing spiritual philosophy is indeed“brain-washing” ourselves in the literal sense; we’re cleansing ourselves ofprograms not in alignment with ultimate Reality. Such a process is express ofyour svātantriya-śakti or power of autonomy, for now you are consciouslydirecting the writing of the code instead of automatically installing whateveris presented to you, as you did as a child. You are reprogramming yourself withthe truth, for you know the result is freedom, connection, appropriate responseto your situation, and self-determination. Sometimes, though, we encounterserious resistance in this process of challenging everything we thought we knewas the old programs violently reassert themselves. You might go through a phaseof seeing your teacher as a self-righteous, self-satisfied manipulator; theteachings as bullshit; and your spiritual community as full of fakes. It isnatural for episodes of cognitive dissonance to arise in this process. When youconnect to your Core, you know you are in the right place, doing the necessarywork, so you can ride out such episodes.Having explained things in this way, an objection may arise, especially in theminds of those familiar with some postmodern thinking. How do we know that thenew program we are calling “truth” really bears a more intimate and accuraterelation to reality than the old one? Haven’t we merely replaced a program thatmade us miserable with one that makes us happier in life? That in itself ishardly a guarantee that it is more aligned with the nature of reality. And if wepresent the counter-argument that these śuddha-vikalpas take us past words anddissolve in wordless experience, the objectioner will reply that may be true ofany vikalpa sufficiently deeply rooted. That is, any program installed on the“root drive” (the paśyantī level) shapes our experience of reality infundamental ways without our conscious awareness. In reply to this objection, wemay first say that even if the objection is correct, we could do worse than toimpose upon the so-called formless, meaningless chaos of reality a view thatmakes us joyous and fills us with love for all living beings. From thatperspective, we need hardly bother with the refutation. But, out of compassionfor the objectioner’s intellect-identified and suffering soul, Abhinava refutesit anyway.He argues that the experience of reality grounded in differential mentalconstructs can be undermined, destabilized, and eventually obliterated throughthe cultivation of thought-forms that are purified, refined, and aligned—but notthe other way around. That is, the true experience of the world, made possibleby spiritual practice integrated in body, mind, and spirit and empowered byright View, cannot be undermined or destabilized by any dualisticthought-construct. That is because the experience of Reality-as-it-is is notcontingent upon thought-constructs; in fact, no thought-construct can help itmanifest or undermine it any way. “What?” the objectioner responds. “I thoughtyou just said that these purified thought-forms can help it manifest?” No,Abhinava replies; what actually happens is that the śuddha-vikalpas serve todestroy the aśuddha-vikalpas that are the substratum of the false experience ofduality as the ultimately real. When these are destroyed, the purifiedthought-forms naturally dissolve, their work done, and we simply see things asthey truly are. Such true seeing can never be supplanted. Without theimpositions of the programmed mind, we see that which is always right in frontof our faces, because Reality is eternally self-manifest and needs no vikalpa tomanifest it. The source of all light does not need to be illumined; it isself-luminous.This teaching gives you a great test to determine whether you are experiencingReality or just a mental construct of reality (for if the construct issufficiently refined, it can be very difficult to discern its presence). Ifsomeone else’s opinion or argument or words in any form can rob you of thefeeling or power or integrity of your spiritual experience, even a little bit,then your so-called “experience” either is or has become a vikalpa, not (yet)rooted all the way into Reality (which is not to say it has no benefit). This iswhy gurus with wisdom will send their disciples back home to their families at acertain point or tell them to get a job. Living in the bubble of spiritualcommunity, or around others who all more or less agree with your values, you maythink you have attained a high level. Around those who think you are a freak orweirdo for practicing this path at all, let alone agree with its principles, youwill see your real attainment and come into your real situation. As my teacherssay, when the rubber meets the road, you will find out what you really have.Humbled, you may have to begin again, but this time the beginning will be a realbeginning. You have seen that living in a vikalpa (mental construct) of thespiritual life is not the goal. The goal is direct experience of reality,unmediated by vikalpas. With clear seeing, you can get real results in yourpractice.It is hard to imagine the experience of nirvikalpa perception, clear seeingwithout the mediating presence of mental constructs, until you’ve actually hadit. It is especially hard for those postmodern intellectuals I alluded toearlier; so hard, they don’t believe such a thing is possible. Suffice to say,however, that those who have experienced nirvikalpa perception will never doubtits reality, since it is an entirely different order of experience from anymediated by vikalpas. To use words that only approximate it, it is luminous andclear, sharp and vivid, totally present and connected, ineffably beautiful,inexpressibly real. It can implode into awareness in a moment, gently orviolently, effortlessly sweeping away all that the mind can think. You feel asvulnerable and raw as if your soul has been laid bare, yet invincibly strong.And all these words come only afterward, when you try to explain it. But do nottry too hard, lest you objectify the experience; if it becomes another vikalpa,you will no longer have access to the power of the experience, it will just beanother memory appropriated by your ego.Let’s turn to the exact words of the master. Abhinava writes,When a person chooses to gradually purify and refine his mental constructs ofreality, as the means for attaining experiential realization of the true natureof things, then he employs a process of contemplation [bhāvanā] that presupposessound reasoning [sat-tarka], true scriptures [sad-āgama], and instruction by atrue Guru [sad-guru]. (Tantrasāra: ch. 4)For total stability in this process, we need a threefold support, and thattripod consists of sat-tarka, sad-āgama, and sad-guru. The scriptures (whichare, of course, śuddha-vikalpa) need the explanation of a true teacher (whosewords are also śuddha-vikalpa), which together support and empower thedevelopment of our own śuddha-vikalpas along sound lines when we use properdiscernment. “True scriptures” are those that have successfully helped beings tofinal liberation and have been handed down in lineage transmission. A “trueteacher” is one who has a well-contemplated understanding based on his ownexperience and who speaks for the benefit of all beings (accepting benefit tohimself as a mere side effect). A sadguru, then, is not a teacher of mereinformation but a transmitter of the power of experiential understanding. Whenany teacher speaks a truth that she has full experience of, with clarity andheartfelt conviction, in that moment she embodies the sadguru. (However, to be a“full-time” guru, one must have received authorization and empowerment from herown guru to serve in that role.) Abhinava continues,Due solely to the power of differential mental constructs, sentient beingsimagine themselves bound, and this very egoic conception is the cause of therepetitive bondage of the cycle of worldly suffering. Hence, when a mentalconstruct that opposes that conception has arisen and become established, itcrushes that mental construct that is the cause of saṃsāra; thus it [indirectly]causes salvation. (Tantrasāra: ch. 4)Just as the man who thinks intensely that he is a sinner becomes such, just soone who thinks himself to be Śiva, and none other than He, becomes Śiva. Thiscertainty, which penetrates and affirms itself in our thoughts, coincides withan awareness free of thought-constructs engendered by a series of [refined andpurified] differentiated mental representations, the object of which is ouridentity with Śiva.156 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en156](Tantrāloka: ch. 15)Abhinava then goes on to present an example of a purified thought-form, which ifcultivated and deeply internalized, has the power to crush dualistic vikalpas.In reading his words, note that viśva, here translated as “the universe” alsomeans “all things.”That pure unlimited Consciousness—transcending all principles of reality thatare limited by nature, from Earth to Śiva—alone is the supreme reality. That isthe ground for the establishment of all things. That is the vital essence [ojas]of the universe. By That the universe lives and breathes, and That alone am I.Thus I embody the universe and yet transcend the universe.157[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en157] (Tantrasāra: ch. 4)Now, if we read this passage just to feel good about ourselves, as an“affirmation,” we are cheating ourselves of the power of the practice ofvikalpa-saṃskāra. Instead, we must take it—or any other passage we wish to workwith in this way—through the following steps. This is the bhāvanā-krama orstages of contemplation. This could all happen in one day or over many days. 1. Ensure that the passage resonates with you. If not, massage the wording until it does, or find another passage that does. 2. Look up any words that you don’t know well; become very comfortable with the meaning of the passage on the vaikharī level, the level of the literal words. Traditionally, you would memorize the passage in this stage. 3. Ponder its meaning more deeply; allow your mind to roam through associated ideas. Ask yourself, “How would I experience the world if I felt the truth of this statement fully?” Imagine how you might move through the world if you were living the statement fully. (This is the madhyamā level.) 4. When you reach a point where you start to become slightly bored with your passage, and think you understand it thoroughly, sit with it (or part of it, such as the final sentence in the above passage) and meditate. Let it be a mantra. Invoke the power of grace, and ask for deeper understanding than can be gotten through the intellect. Then allow whatever arises to arise. If the meditation becomes stagnant, ask the deeper wisdom, “Is there anything more?” and sit and wait quietly. (This is the paśyantī level.) 5. For a few days, go to sleep with the passage, wake up with the passage, and revisit it several times throughout the day. In self-reflection, examine any resistance you have to receiving its wisdom on the deepest level of your being and inquire into the causes. 6. Then let it go, but observe how the wisdom you have internalized shows up in daily life experience.I could add more stages, but at this point the process becomes highly organicand individual. One may begin the process again with another passage. If thispractice, which is sometimes called “insight meditation,” is done correctly, itresults in the teaching becoming fully assimilated at the deepest level. Youknow this has happened because you can explain the teaching clearly usinglanguage wholly different from that in which you learned it (for example, to afriend or family member who doesn’t have a spiritual practice like yours anddoesn’t know the jargon). As one of my teachers used to say, “If you can’t showit, you don’t really know it!” If you have deeply assimilated a teaching, yourecognize its “energy signature” and can therefore spot the same teaching whenit appears in a different religious tradition that uses different language forit. But most significantly of all, an assimilated teaching is a living reality:without having to remember the teaching mentally, it is a pulsing power withinyou, a power of grace that can open you to experiencing the divinity of anygiven moment. It is an ally, like a mantra or a deity.Once you have done the process with a few teachings from this book, trycomposing your own śuddha-vikalpa. Abhinava Gupta teaches us to replace animpure (untrue) vikalpa with its opposite. Again, an impure vikalpa is one that,if believed, separates us from our essence-nature. To engage the process ofremoving these vikalpas in the way Abhinava recommends, first identify one ofyour negative messages or “tapes” that you tend to run when you’ve donesomething “wrong” or “bad.” For example, when I thought I’d screwed up, I usedto punish myself by saying (and believing), “I’m so stupid!” Then one of myteachers said to me, “That’s a good way to ensure you keep repeating thebehavior.” I said, “What? Why?” I thought if I made myself feel badly enough forit, surely I would stop behaving that way. This was in retrospect clearly theinternalization of the punishment technique of parenting (which, by the way, iswholly ineffective—virtually everyone uses it, and look at the world we have).My teacher said, “If you convince yourself that you’re stupid, then you willobviously keep doing the things that ‘stupid’ people do. Remember that the ego’spriority is to maintain its self-image. It would rather be right than happy, andif you keep repeating the ‘stupid’ behavior, the ego will have thatsatisfaction.” (Of course, this teaching about relinquishing self-judgmentshould not be construed to mean that we may thereby relinquish discernment aboutwhat constitutes skillful versus unskillful action.)We all believe things about ourselves that our loved ones find absurd, but wecling to them nonetheless because we believe we have plenty of evidence forthem. But our thinking is wrong-headed: it is because we believe the self-imagethat we see the world in such a way that confirms our view. When we askourselves, “Would I rather be happy or right?” we take a leap of faith. If wewait for enough “evidence” to come in before changing our self-image, we willwait forever, and grow old and petrified in our views in the meantime. Soidentify one of your negative self-messages now, and compose an antidote for itas Abhinava suggests. Now if, for example, mine is “I’m so stupid,” I mightthink the antidote is “I’m actually really smart!” Unfortunately, such a feeblerejoinder will not be successful in displacing an impure thought-form that hastaken deep root and plagued you for years. As Abhinava teaches, the new purifiedthought-form 1) must be very powerful and 2) must terminate in the ultimateReality. The only way to make it do that is to take it all the way to God. Forexample, instead of “I’m actually really smart,” I might say, “The divineintelligence that created this whole universe dwells within me as me, and bycontacting it, I can understand anything I truly need to know in this life.” Nowthat’s something with power that I can work with, and it is a vikalpa that cantake me beyond itself, which if you recall is one definition of aśuddha-vikalpa.If you succeed in finding a true antidote to your negative self-message, youwill know because you will probably be uncomfortable repeating it. You mightfeel silly saying it, or you might start to cry. A student of mine, when workingwith this technique, identified the negative self-message of “I’m a bad mother.”When she came up with the feeble antidote of “I’m a good mother,” I challengedher to root her śuddha-vikalpa in God. She said, “I am a manifestation of theDivine Mother,” and burst into tears. Then she said, “But I don’t really believeit.” We realized it had to be authentic for her, so we modified the statement to“I am a manifestation of the Divine Mother in the process of realizing andembodying my true nature.” You might try something similar so that it challengesyou but also rings true for you. Then you might take the ultimate challenge: goto the mirror and look yourself right in the eye and repeat your śuddha-vikalpa,no matter how silly you feel, until you get past the point of feeling silly. Youmay be amazed at what happens. (If the mirror doesn’t work for you, you couldtry using a loved one as your “mirror.”)At the end of chapter 4 of Essence of the Tantras, Abhinava offers the followingtrenchant verses on the practice I have been describing. You might think, by theway, that this practice is startlingly modern in its awareness of humanpsychology, given that it was taught a thousand years ago in the very differentculture of medieval Kashmīr. We may perhaps take it as evidence that the fullyawakened and integrated consciousness of a mahāsiddha really does transcend itscultural confines, even as it must express itself using the language of thatvery culture. Abhinava writes,A bound soul has convictions such as “I am only inert matter; I am completelybound by my karma; I am impure; I am a victim.” When he succeeds in attainingthe firmly rooted conviction of the opposite of these views, he immediatelybecomes the Lord whose body is the whole universe and whose soul isConsciousness. ||In whatever manner such a conviction may be attained, a superior yogī mustcultivate it at all times. He should not be led into doubt by the mass offoolish teachings in the world; i.e., by any viewpoint not grounded in the realnature of things. || (Tantrasāra: ch. 4)He then adds two beautiful, poetic verses, writing not in Sanskrit but rather inthe Prākṛt language, which was much closer to the language of the common people:“I am a filthy sinner,” “I am a bound creature,” “I am separate from all otherbeings,” or even “I transcend all things”158[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en158]—when such firm beliefsare innate stains on the heart, how indeed for such a person can the vision ofsupreme reality flash forth? ||In the heart-lotus of consciousness that has blossomed due to an intense Descentof a ray of light from the sun of the Highest Divinity, the phases of awarenessemit the exquisite fragrance of the Self, revealing its secret nature: there thebee of Self-Awareness vibrates, cherishing the experience of its own radiantcore, humming “I am the divine Lord, overflowing with the reality of allbeings!” ||The last verse alludes to the other major teaching given under the heading ofśākta-upāya: the worship of the subtle phases of cognition as twelve aspects ofthe Goddess Kālī. We will not be examining this secret doctrine of the Kramahere. Instead, we will conclude by looking at what Abhinava says about thepractices of yoga and kriyā in the context of śākta-upāya. None of the limbs ofyoga (meditation, ritual, the yamas and niyamas, etc.) can be considered adirect means to liberation, he argues; they have spiritual value only insofar asthey contribute to the one and only direct means, which is true insight intoreality (sat-tarka), an insight that manifests Pure Wisdom (śuddha-vidyā). Inlight of this, he presents the inner, śākta-upāya meaning and significance ofthe most common āṇava-upāya practices. In so doing, he means to imply that 1)these are the understandings that can empower those external practices andindeed constitute their very essence for the liberation-seeker, and 2) if theseunderstandings are fully assimilated, we do not necessarily need the externalpractices (though again, it is a rare being that can do without the externalsupports).Abhinava proceeds to list the traditional Indian spiritual practices, describingtheir significance in a sādhanā of Consciousness.pūjā: Worship is the offering of all existent things and states of being[bhāvas] into the Highest Divinity, in order to attain the firm understandingthat they all subsist within the Highest Divinity alone, and there is nothingother than That.Because they are pleasing to the Heart, we begin by offering those things thattend to spontaneously dissolve into blissful awareness and are thus easefullyoffered to God. For this reason, we are taught [in scripture] to use in externalpractice those things that delight the aesthetic senses, such as flowers,libations of fragrant wine, and scented unguents.159[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en159] (Tantrasāra: ch. 4)What does it mean to offer something into the Highest Divinity? It means todissolve your perception of it as being something other than the one divineAwareness. It means to melt away the thought-constructs by which you see youroffering as anything other than God. Now, since some things are easier to see asdivine than others, Abhinava suggests that, in the context of ritual, we startby offering objects that are pleasing to the aesthetic sense. When seeing,smelling, tasting, and touching that which is beautiful, it takes little to noeffort to repose in awareness. We might take the example of a poem that strikesus as very beautiful: the moment the poem ends, we do not immediately dissectits meaning; rather, for at least a few seconds, we simply rest in the rasa orflavor of awareness created by the poem. This repose within innate awareness iscalled viśrānti and is very important in Abhinava’s teaching. If the repose isexpanded by aesthetic rapture and includes a measure of loving self-awareness,it is called ānanda, commonly translated as bliss but actually connotingsomething much more subtle than excitement or even ecstasy.In the state of ānanda, one does not differentiate the object of awareness fromoneself, and so by loving it, one is loving oneself, one is loving the verypower of awareness that is God. So the practice of pūjā begins with those thingsone finds beautiful, so that one can observe what it is like to repose (even fora moment) in a state in which there is no differentiation between the object,one’s awareness of it, and the divine Power that makes all awarenesspossible—with the whole experience englobed by a love for the sheer fact ofbeing aware. Notice that when someone smells a sublime scent or tastes sublimefood, they close their eyes for a moment; they are savoring consciousnessitself, not dwelling on so-called objective reality. This is a tiny kernel ofthe aesthetic rapture that Abhinava invites us to cultivate.However, he tells us to offer all things into the Highest Divinity, not just theones we most like. This tells us that the aesthetically pleasing pūjā is just atraining ground for a more difficult practice. The principle at work here isthat of overspill—that is, when you cultivate the experience of beauty, youexpand your capacity to experience the beautiful. When you cultivate theexperience of love, you expand your capacity to love. It’s as if you get a kindof momentum of love going, and then it spills over and you find yourself able tolove people who previously challenged you. Consciously allowing this overspillis crucial if we wish to become free of our enslavement to the preferences ofthe mind.Therefore, after practicing reposing in the sweetness of beauty-flavoredconsciousness at your altar of worship for some time, begin trying it with otherexperiences. To do this practice, when you are aware of something that repulsesor frightens or bores or amuses you, try bringing your awareness to the fact ofyour own subjectivity—to consciousness itself, flavored by its object, ratherthan the illusion of subject-object duality. Become fascinated by the “texture,”“color,” and “flavor” of a consciousness temporarily imbued with the object inquestion. Then relish and give thanks for the fact that you are aware at all. Inthis way, go beyond your superficial like or dislike of the object, and becomeabsorbed by the miracle of consciousness itself. Finally, remember to offer allstates of mind and heart into God, by contemplating that they are vibrations ofthe one energy and realizing their non-difference from That.Now we may proceed to look at the inner meaning of fire-offerings.homa: All existent things and states consist of the radiant energy [tejas] ofthe Highest Divinity. It is to attain a firm understanding of this fact that onemakes fire-offerings [homa], which are the dissolution of all existent thingsand states into the effulgent energy of the Fire of Consciousness that is theHighest Divinity—which longs for the aesthetic rapture of “devouring” allexistent things and states—such that all that remains is that energy.(Tantrasāra: ch. 4)The same teaching as above, that everything is a form of God, is given here in adifferent way (it being, after all, Abhinava’s central teaching). The keydifference is that in the previous practice, there was a remainder of objectiveawareness; one worked with consciousness flavored by its object. Here, theobject is completely devoured in the sense that there is no longer anyperception of it as being anything other than the one energy. In this practicethen, one does not maintain awareness of difference but rather experienceseverything as having the same substance and essence (sāmarasya), the blazingeffulgence of the all-consuming divine Fire of Consciousness. Thus the previouspractice emphasized creation, the Goddess Parā, whereas this one emphasizesdissolution, the Goddess Kālī. (These two goddesses are of course both aspectsof each other.) The next practice turns awareness to the ground of both creationand dissolution.japa: In the same way, mantra repetition has the purpose of giving rise to thestate of awareness that underlies both [the creating and dissolving functions ofConsciousness]. It consists of having the inner awareness: “The supreme Realitythat exists as my own innermost essence remains just as it is, unaffected by thedifferentiated entities or states that constitute the various objects ofconsciousness, whether internal or external.”160[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en160] (Tantrasāra: ch. 4)Here the practitioner affirms the understanding that is the true mantra (notethat the interpretive etymology of mantra is “that which protects the one whothinks it”). Even as consciousness is flavored by its objects, there is alwaysan aspect of it that is utterly transcendent, uncontracted by any perception.Affirming this repeatedly with deep conviction can increase our capacity to beconnected with that level. As Abhinava says,Though the ultimate reality that constitutes one’s own innate nature does notdepend upon any vikalpa, it may shine forth by means of the variousconceptualizations (described above) that are aspects of Pure Wisdom[śuddha-vidyā].Lastly, Abhinava offers us an intriguing and, as far as I know, uniquedefinition of yoga.yoga: In this context, yoga is a special kind of vikalpa that is in essence aninvestigation into the true nature of That [Reality], in order to attain nothingless than its constant and uniform manifestation.Since “yoga” nearly always denotes a psycho-physical practice aimed atdissolving the mind as we understand it, it is surprising that Abhinavadescribes it as a “special kind of vikalpa.” I take him to mean here that yogaentails a particular frame of mind that allows us to experientially enquireinto, and realize unity with, the true nature of things. This is the Tantrikparadox: adopting a yogic frame of mind frees us from the belief that we arenothing but the mind. The important point here is that just as physical yogaentails the reconditioning of the body, every spiritual practice, even thetransmental ones, must entail the reconditioning of the mind in order to conformit to the deep structure of reality, the innate patterning of Consciousness.While we might suspect that Abhinava is working to advance his own agenda hereby overcoding his mystical gnostic interpretation of these practices, I want topoint out that he does in fact have a scriptural basis for this mode ofinterpretation: the Vijñāna-bhairava-tantra. Let us turn to the last verses ofthat text, where an esoteric reading of ritual and yoga is given that, whilemuch more compressed, parallels Abhinava’s quite closely.The revered Goddess said: “If, O Lord, this is the true form of Parā [theSupreme Goddess], how can there be mantra or its repetition in the [nondual]state you have taught? What would be visualized, what worshipped and gratified?And who is there to receive offerings?” The revered Bhairava said: “In this[higher way], O doe-eyed one, external procedures are considered coarse[sthūla]. Here ‘japa’ is the ever-greater meditative absorption [bhāvanā] intothe supreme state; and the ‘mantra’ to be repeated is the spontaneously arisingresonance [of inner experience] which aligns with that. As for ‘meditativevisualization,’ [dhyāna] it is a mind that has become motionless, free of forms,and supportless, not imagining a deity with a body, eyes, face, and so on. Pūjāis likewise not the offering of flowers and so on. A mind made firm, whichthrough careful attention dissolves into the thought-free ultimate Void [of pureAwareness]: that is pūjā.161[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en161](Vijñāna-bhairava-tantra)Such esoteric interpretations serve their function best when they interiorizeand deepen already acquired forms of exoteric practice.While śāmbhava-upāya is nonsequential (akrama) direct insight, and āṇava-upāyainvolves a process (krama) that unfolds in specific stages, śākta-upāya isdescribed as “sequential-yet-nonsequential” (kramākrama) because it involvesgradual cultivation of understanding punctuated by sudden leaps of insight.These leaps take place when the understanding or mental construct we are workingwith becomes sufficiently close to reality that it suddenly collapses intoreality, dissolving into direct (nonconceptual) experience. Just as the āsanasof modern postural yoga challenge our bodies, stretching them in new ways,repatterning and creating over time a whole new body, in śākta-upāya we holdexpanded understandings, “postures of the mind,” that function to reshape ourconsciousness, creating a whole new mind. This mind is fresher, more open andmore luminous, with a greater capacity for childlike wonder coupled with maturewisdom. It is also much more flexible and adaptable, responding appropriately toall kinds of situations. It is clear and strong, free of unneeded detritus. Toattain this mind, saturate it with the nectarean words of the masters and sages.But do not be content with understanding those words; work them into the verytissues of your being until your whole being vibrates with them!That comment brings us to the other aspect of śākta-upāya work. Once you haveworked extensively with the energy (śakti) of your own thoughts and feelings,you can tune in more and more effectively to “the powers operating in all oflife’s activities as particular pulsations (viśeṣa-spanda) in the universalrhythm (sāmānya-spanda) of the Power of Consciousness.”162[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en162] This practice cannot bedescribed in a step-by-step method, for it consists of a deep and groundedattentiveness to the subtle patterns of energy moving in and as all things,patterns that consist both of repeating universals and of unique-to-that-momentparticulars. Suffice to say that this practice begins to unfold spontaneouslywhen you have heightened your awareness and slowed down the pace of your lifeenough to look deeper than the surface of things. When you no longer areprojecting your mind-world onto everything, you naturally start to notice therhythmic dance of life-energy all around you. This integration into the deeperpattern can give rise to astonishing synchronicities, even a sense of magic, asseeing how everything fits with everything else allows your own life to flowmore effortlessly.This whole chapter has itself been an exercise in śākta-upāya practice. If youread the words as more than mere information, you are probably not the sameperson you were at the beginning—and you are now ready to begin again and doyour spiritual work with renewed intensity, joy, and faith.āṇava-upāya:the individual, embodied meansAny spiritual practice that an external observer can see and identify fallsunder the heading of “the Embodied Means,” which thereby covers the greatmajority of religious acts. For the majority of practitioners, especially thosewho are just beginning a spiritual practice, āṇava-upāya is the most appropriatemethod. The word āṇava (“individual”) derives from aṇu, a term that refers to anindividual embodied soul (= jīva), a contracted form of Consciousness. Soāṇava-upāya, the individual/embodied means, is the appropriate starting placefor those who experience themselves in that way: as individuals for whomplurality appears as the most “real” level of reality. In other words, those whosee things as concretely differentiated most of the time, i.e., nearly all ofus. Āṇava-upāya is thus the method that emphasizes objects of awareness (ratherthan focusing on awareness itself), primarily the body, breath, and centers ofthe subtle body. It primarily utilizes the Power of Action (kriyā-śakti).Therefore, it is the easiest of the three means to understand and practice. Ithelps to refine awareness, making it more subtle, such that the other two meansbecome more accessible.The techniques of āṇava-upāya, conceived generally, are all those usuallygrouped under the headings of yoga and kriyā: meditation, prāṇāyāma,visualization, mantra repetition, activation of the subtle centers, bodilypostures, and meditative ritual performance. Nearly all of these weretransmitted into the haṭha-yoga tradition (except the last, which wastransmitted into Hindu temple culture) and from there into modern yoga. Sonearly all of the practices taught under the name of yoga today would beconsidered āṇava-upāya. Since āṇava works in the realm of plurality, there is adiverse array of such practices, and the practitioner needs to decide which onesare most effective for her (though traditionally, a guru would assign a practiceto a neophyte practitioner, discerning more accurately what will be effectivethan she can herself). Since these yogic practices are well known, I will notdwell on their basic forms here. Suffice to say that any yogic practice, whenperformed as an integrated part of a Tantrik sādhanā grounded in a Tantrik View,automatically becomes a Tantrik practice.Since you are already familiar with many of the practices of yoga that havesurvived down to the present, let’s look at how these practices are presented inthe mature classical Tantra, with reference to Abhinava Gupta’s Light on theTantras and Essence of the Tantras. There we find much more subtle versions ofthe commonly known practices. He describes these techniques: * meditative visualization of the flow of the powers of consciousness through the sense-faculties (dhyāna); * meditation on the flow of the vital energies (prāṇa-uccāra); * meditation on empowered seed-syllables, subtle mantras that are synchronized with the breath (varṇa-uccāra); * performing yogic postures (karaṇa); * performing ritual worship (pūjā), in which the divine energy worshipped can be installed in internal substrates, such as the breath, or (more commonly) external substrates, such as maṇḍalas and deity images.We will briefly describe some of these practices. Although Abhinava subordinatesthem to the higher yoga of the mind, he nevertheless argues that, whenapproached correctly, they lead to precisely the same result. That is to say, heholds the view that to take any practice to its ultimate conclusion, we musteventually entail and entrain every part of ourselves in the process. (Entrainmeans to “incorporate and sweep along in its flow” or “cause [something] togradually fall into sync,” an uncommon but very yogic word.) So theoretically,any one practice, thoroughly understood and mastered, could take us all the wayto our goal. Most of us, however, are at a distinct advantage if we incorporatea variety of modalities in our spiritual journey. Abhinava writes:The Individual Means [āṇava-upāya] is that which is applied in the spheres ofimagination, prāṇa, the body, and external things. There is absolutely nodifference among these methods in that the practice of any of them may yield thesupreme fruit. (Tantrasāra: ch. 5)dhyānaLet’s explore some of the practices Abhinava describes under the heading ofāṇava-upāya in his book Essence of the Tantras (composed in Sanskrit around theyear 1010, here appearing in my translation). The first is a practice ofmeditative visualization (dhyāna) of a kind typical of classical Tantra, thoughhere encoded with deeper spiritual meaning than is commonly found. In thispractice, the instrument of imagination (buddhi) is predominant. The summaryverses that Abhinava composed to describe the practice concisely and poeticallyare as follows:Having internalized the triad of knower, knowing, and known, one should meditateon it as the self-luminous Reality that is all, abiding within the radiant abodeof bliss in the heart. ||One should meditate on that all-pervasive reality in the form of the Fire-Wheelthat is Bhairava—with rays of light that are the twelve great Powers ofConsciousness—issuing forth from an opening of the body toward an externalobject, becoming its creation, stasis, and dissolution. ||The yogī should thus contemplate the totality of all external objects and theirinternal impressions as absorbed into that Wheel, coming to rest in himself asits ground. Thus his real nature will be revealed. || (Tantrasāra: ch. 5)Of course, the practice needs be described in more practical detail in order tobe doable. First I will present a bullet-point summary of the steps, thenexplain them in detail.Tantrik dhyāna (meditative visualization)as described in Essence of the Tantras 1. Center your awareness in the space of the Heart, remembering that therein dwells the divine Light that is the essential nature of all things. 2. Visualize your body as a body of light, focusing your visualization vividly on the three primary subtle channels (nāḍīs), breathing out of the solar channel (pingalā), breathing into the lunar (iḍā), and holding the breath in the central channel (suṣumnā) until the three “fuse” in the heart center. 3. Visualize the fused energy as the radiant light of the Deity in the form of a twelve-spoked wheel of fire, rising from the heart, flowing out of one of the sense-apertures, and coming to rest on an external object (actually present or imagined). 4. As the fire-wheel spins, resting on this object, contemplate that the object is created by consciousness alone, that consciousness alone maintains it, and that consciousness dissolves it back into itself. 5. After the object has dissolved into the fire-wheel, withdraw it back into yourself, reposing in the dynamic stillness of the Absolute ground of the whole process. 6. The process repeats, except now the object is the subliminal impression (saṃskāra) of the prior object.Now that you have an overview, let’s explore these steps and the informationnecessary to apply them. As with all the practices Abhinava offers, you begin bycentering your awareness in your heart, which serves as a locus for thecontemplation of the ultimate Heart, which is the core of your total being, theone unchanging aspect of yourself: autonomous Consciousness. So bringingattention to “the space of the Heart,” to use Abhinava’s phrase, does not meanbecoming more aware of your feelings. Rather, it is bringing awareness to thefact of awareness itself—the field within which vibrates whatever thoughts orfeelings happen to be arising. Abhinava asks us to begin this dhyāna practice by“meditating on the self-revealing Light of Consciousness that inheres within allaspects of reality as the power of awareness that is one’s own Heart.” Thissounds terribly lofty but actually points toward something as simple asreminding yourself of that special secret place inside you where you feel themost you, that place where you feel the sheer delight of being you, doing yourthing. It is the part of you that has remained constant in all experiencesthroughout your life: the place where you are just yourself, without any effort,beyond any specific thoughts or feelings about yourself. It is the place whereyou feel the very you-ness of “you.” We might describe it as the sense ofpresent and loving self-awareness independent of any specific content. I say“loving,” but it’s not really as active as that verb implies. It’s a place ofdeep acceptance of what is, simply because it is. I am using words here to pointto something that words cannot capture, hoping that you will look to where thewords point and intuit what they refer to. You already know this inner place I’mtalking about, but perhaps you haven’t brought as much attention to it as youare now learning to do; or perhaps you have let certain concepts be overlaidupon it and now need to discern the pure essence of it. It is your Heart, whichis and always has been an expression of the universal Heart.The second step in the dhyāna involves a technique central to Tantrik sādhanā,that of subtle-body visualization. Abhinava asks us to visualize the “triad offire, sun, and moon,” known throughout Tantrik literature as the “three lights”or the “triple radiance” (tri-dhāman). These terms refer to the threefundamental structures of the subtle body: the central, right, and left channelsrespectively. The channels or nāḍīs of the subtle body are arteries in whichprāṇa, life-force energy, is said to flow (Note that the word prāṇa can refer tothe vital energy in general, or to that of the exhale in particular.). There aresaid to be 72,000 of these channels, but this seems to be hyperbole, for only afew dozen of them (at most) were described or drawn in pre-20th century images.Of these, by far the most important are the three we have mentioned, which arepresented in tabular form below.NameMeaningLightLocationBreathCognitive aspectsuṣumnā“graceful”FireCentral (spine)udāna (rising)knowerpingalā“reddish”SunRight-dominantprāṇa (exhale)knowingiḍā“refreshing”MoonLeft-dominantapāna (inhale)known[image/Trika_Chakras.jpg]Note that this image depicts the classical Trika system of five cakras, whichcorrespond to the five primary elements. The triangles at the bottom and topsignify the Lower and Upper Kuṇḍalinī; we also see the kanda (bulb), the heartlotus with its “sprout of flame,” and the palate cakra, surrounded by the sixblack dots of the wind element.The lateral pingalā and iḍā nāḍīs undulate back and forth, crossing the centralchannel in a caduceus-type pattern. The pingalā, which is dominant on the rightside, carries the energy of the exhale. It is identified with the sun because(in this yoga of self-awareness) as the breath flows out, consciousness movesoutward toward external objects, illuminating them. Just as the sun makesobjects manifest to our vision, the Light of Consciousness makes objectsmanifest in our experience. Therefore the outward-moving warm “solar” breath isidentified by Abhinava with the process of cognition, which has its locus in thesenses. The idea in the ancient tradition was that consciousness moves outthrough the various channels of the senses in order to grasp its objects (asopposed to our modern view of the senses as passive recipients of the constantlyinflowing data of sense-experience). Understanding this helps the variousassociations made here make more sense.The iḍā nāḍī, which is dominant on the left side, carries the energy of theinhalation. It is identified with the moon because as the breath flows in,consciousness moves inward, bringing the vibration of the object with it to besavored internally. Just as the moon reflects the light of the sun, but with avery different quality than direct sunlight, the objects of our experiencereflect back to us the fact of our consciousness, colored by the particularitiesof the object doing the reflecting. Additionally, in Indian literature the moonis always thought of as cool, refreshing, and delightful; a blessed relief afterthe heat of the day. Thus the inward-moving breath is “lunar” both because it isliterally cooling, and because it is associated with the internalization of thesense-objects that produces enjoyment.Note that prāṇa is the exhale and apāna is the inhale in all the classicalTantrik sources, whereas many modern yoga teachers teach the reverse. Yet theearlier tradition must be regarded as more coherent and logical in itsterminology. Pra + āna literally means “breathing forth” in Sanskrit and ap +āna “breathing down.” The inhale is obviously the breath that moves down. Butnote that this does not necessarily contradict modern yoga teaching that has thebody rise up with the inhale—in fact it makes perfect sense to have the bodyrise up while the prāṇa moves down.We are left, then, with the central channel or suṣumnā nāḍī. It is visualized asextending from the pelvic floor to the crown of the head. It is visualizedvariously as a glowing golden column of light or as cobalt blue and the width ofan arrow shaft. The central channel is associated with “the knower” or agent ofconsciousness. This is a mystical channel, in the sense that when prāṇa moveswithin it, it is solely for the purpose of our spiritual liberation. Originally,this form of prāṇa was associated with udāna-vāyu, the upward-moving vitalenergy. The later Tantrik and haṭha-yoga traditions call it by the special nameof kuṇḍalī or kuṇḍalinī. The relevant question here is what causes the prāṇa tomove up the suṣumnā nāḍī instead of its usual path of exhalation? To separatethe flow of the vital energy from the physical breath to which it is closelylinked is not easy. Our vital energy can enter the central channel, says NŚT,because of a yogic practice or a gnostic insight. (“Gnostic insight” refers to adirect realization of some aspect of the nature of reality that is sufficientlypowerful to immediately manifest experientially.) The yogic practice in questionis alluded to in many primary sources but is little known or understood today,despite its relative simplicity. When you practice for a long time the basic butpowerful prāṇāyāma of lengthening the breaths and making them equal in durationand quality, and retaining the breath after each inhale (for as long as iscomfortable), eventually prāṇa and apāna come into perfect balance. If thebreath retention (kumbhaka) is done at the same time as vibrating a specialseed-mantra (the kuṇḍalinī-bīja) in the Heart-space, then something remarkableand mysterious happens. In one of those moments of profound kumbhaka-stasis, theenergy of the breaths is said to spontaneously “fuse” in a moment of timelesssimultaneity and then suddenly surge up the central channel. This is the momentfor which the yogī devoutly wishes and practices, for if the prāṇa reaches thecrown of the head and merges there completely, he has reached the end of hisjourney.163 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en163]The gnostic insight that can accomplish the same thing is this: the profoundrealization that an object known in any cognition—whether it is an external orinternal phenomenon—is simply an aspect of your own being, utterly inseparablefrom the light of your consciousness, which illumines that object, vibrates insympathy with it, then dissolves it into itself. That is to say, if we truly,experientially realize that the knower, the means of knowing, and the thingknown are but three aspects of one dynamic reality, we have accomplished thefusion of the three corresponding subtle channels and breaths by another means.This is what Abhinava means in step 2 of the dhyāna instructions when he says,“One should visualize in the Heart the fusion of the triad of fire, sun, andmoon, which are forms of the knower, means of knowing, and object knownrespectively.” So, we can take either of two approaches: 1) manipulating theenergies of the subtle body to trigger a liberative spiritual experience thatresults in understanding, or 2) generating an understanding so powerful and socomplete that it brings the energies of the subtle body into alignment with it.Both approaches presume a mind-body unity, for the belief that mind and body arebut aspects of one another is the driving force of all yogic practices.So in step 2, if we take the yogic approach, we visualize the three channels ofthe subtle body vividly while practicing breath extension (prāṇāyāma). Imaginingthat the breath is entering at the third eye or the crown of the head and thenmoving down toward the base of the heart, you can breathe in to the pearly-whiteleft-dominant lunar channel, seeing it glowing as the prāṇa flows along it. Themoon sets in the heart center (in the area of the sternum or the xiphoidprocess), and the breath pauses just before “dawn” in a kumbhaka (breathretention), while you experience absolute centeredness. Then the sun rises fromthe heart center and the prāṇa flows up along the reddish right-dominant solarchannel and exits out the top of the head. Continue this, gently increasing thetime of the pause between the breaths, feeling it as a holding of the solar andlunar vibrations in perfect balance, until a palpable energy (for example, heator pressure or vibration) arises in the heart center. This is the Fire ofMahābhairava, the one energy that expresses in the three aspects describedabove. The more you practice the technique, the more powerful it becomes.Another way of doing this practice, which I discovered through the translationwork of Chris Tompkins, is through the following visualization. Vividly imaginethe sun rising in the base of the heart center, and slowly exhale it up thecentral channel until it emerges from the crown of the head. Then visualize thefull moon above the head, inhale it down the central channel until it sets inthe base of the heart, and hold kumbhaka. Then visualize the sun rising onceagain in the same location. Continue this breath/visualization practice untilthere comes a kumbhaka in which the setting moon and the rising sun are bothfully present at the base of the heart in perfect equilibrium; their energiesfuse into the Fire of Mahābhairava (white moon + red sun = orange fire).The 12-spoked Wheel of Fire[image/Fire_Wheel_BIG.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"Now give this energy a form by visualizing it as a Wheel of Fire with twelvespokes representing the twelve śaktis. Let the wheel pulse and spin in yourheart, then invite it to flow along one of the channels leading to the eye orear or any other bodily aperture. Visualize it issuing forth from your body andcoming to rest on an external object corresponding to the channel it flowed outof—for example, a visual object for the eye, a sound for the ear, a smell forthe nose, and so on. (As a beginner, you will have to consciously select anobject first, then have the Fire-wheel flow out the corresponding channel; laterit will happen more spontaneously.) Work with the sense-field that is strongestfor you until you are more experienced. If your imagination is sufficientlyvivid, you can work with an object not physically present as well.In the fourth step, as you visualize the spinning or pulsing Fire-wheel restingon the object of awareness, feel that you are filling the latter with divineenergy as you simultaneously contemplate that the object is in fact emitted byyour own consciousness. Then hold the object in a state of illumination, inwhich its true nature as a vibration of energy is manifest. Finally, dissolvethe object completely into the Fire-wheel, which then re-enters the body throughthe relevant aperture and rises along the central channel to dissolve in theVoid at the crown of the head with a long exhale.In the fifth step, which occurs when the Fire-wheel has risen to the crown ofthe head and subsided into the profound silence of the vast space of the crowncakra, you simply repose there in the perfect stillness of the Absolute groundof the whole process, which is perfect emptiness.In the sixth and final step, you repeat the whole process, but this time theFire-wheel does not leave the body but rather rests on the subliminal impression(saṃskāra) of the object that you worked with in steps 1 to 5, which for thepurposes of this practice simply means using the memory of the object as themeditational focus.As with any Tantrik practice, full mastery of this brings about liberation. AsAbhinava writes,One who meditates thus repeatedly discovers that the cycles of creation, stasis,and dissolution are—in terms of the highest reality—solely one’s ownconsciousness, and thus discovers that the ultimate nature of one’s ownconsciousness is its free and independent exercise of these powers. At the verymoment of the full realization of this, he becomes God. So through repeatedpractice come all desired powers and attainments, as well as liberation.(Tantrasāra: ch. 5)Now go back and read the summary verses for the dhyāna practice[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-30_split_000.xhtml#vis], and theyshould make perfect sense.uccāraNow we will explore the second practice Abhinava gives under the heading ofāṇava-upāya. It is called uccāra, which can be translated both as “enunciation”and “elevation.” In this practice the prāṇa is primary. Before we discussAbhinava’s version of uccāra, however, we must look at the form this practicetakes in the wider Tantrik tradition. In the classical period, uccāra played acrucial role in the daily yoga sādhanā practiced by nearly all Tāntrikas. Thecore of uccāra, as its name implies, is the raising of an empoweredseed-syllable up the central channel of the practitioner to the crown of thehead. Though the most common elements of Tantrik practice—mantra, mudrā, andvisualization—are present in this practice, the prāṇa is nonetheless primary, aswe will see.Let’s take the example of the seed-syllable hrīṃ. When raising this bīja up thecentral channel, the elements of the mantra are arranged along its axis. So, onemakes the appropriate mudrā at the mūlādhāra (which is located, according to thesystem in question, at the base of the spine, at the perineum or four fingersbelow the navel) and begins with the enunciation of h, barely audible, raisingit (along with the mudrā and visualization of a point of brilliant light) to thenavel, where the r sound kicks in; which is then raised to the level of the baseof the heart, where it crossfades into the ī vowel; which is raised to the levelof the throat, where the vowel starts becoming increasingly nasalized. At thelevel of the palate, it becomes a pure nasal, slightly colored by the precedingvowel (ī), and vibrates there intensely with a sound similar to that of a swarmof bees. Then it rises still farther, the audible sound tapering off as thesubtle vibration continues to rise to the crown of the head and beyond. Thewhole process is done with a single breath, repeated 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, or 108times. It may be done with any bīja-mantra, such as hauṃ (in which case the hsound rises from the base, the vowel a kicks in at the base of the heart, u atthe base of the throat, and the nasal at the palate).This, then, is the standard form of uccāra, in its most basic outline.164[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en164] Note that you areunlikely to practice this successfully without guidance from a teacher. However,in his Essence of the Tantras, Abhinava Gupta separates uccāra into twopractices, one that is more focused on the flow of the prāṇa and does notexplicitly require mantra, and another (called varṇa-uccāra) which does requiremantra. We will consider the first of these here, since the second cannot betaught in a book. Abhinava’s prāṇa-uccāra is different from mainstream Tantrikuccāra in two important respects. First, it utilizes all five of the prāṇa-vāyus(aspects of the vital energy), not just the exhale, and second, it isgnostically overcoded, which means it is interpreted in terms of liberativespiritual concepts. It is this form of uccāra, developed within the so-calledgnostic Trika (which became the most long-lived form of Tantra in Kashmīr), thatwe will explore now.Uccāraas Described in Essence of the TantrasThis practice might seem conceptually similar to the Fire-wheel dhyāna givenabove, and it is, for it is meant to accomplish the same goal: the realizationof any and every object of experience as a vibration of divine Consciousness,which is identical with your innate awareness. However, in the dhyāna,visualization is primary, while in this uccāra, the sensation of the rhythmicflow of the breaths is central. For some, this will be easier and more effectiveto practice, while for more visual people, the dhyāna might prove moreappealing.Abhinava gives six steps in his uccāra practice, corresponding to the fiveprāṇa-vāyus plus an initial step of centering and opening to grace. I will quotehis exact words, explaining where necessary.1. In this practice, one who wants to cause the vital energy to rise firstreposes in the space of the Heart.See the relevant section[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-30_split_000.xhtml#theheart] for adiscussion of the notion of centering in the Heart-space.2. Then, due to exhaling [prāṇa], awareness flows through the sense-facultiesand rests on an external object.The first step of the practice proper is flowing your awareness outward throughthe “solar” exhale that illuminates a specific object. Beginners should use anexternal physical object, such as an item on your altar, while more advancedpractitioners can use a subtle one. As you direct your exhale toward the object,feel the energy of your consciousness flowing out through your sense-channelsand manifesting the object before you.3. Then, filling himself with the “moon” that is inhalation [apāna], bringingwith it the object, he sees himself in all things and thus becomes free from anydesire for the other.On the “lunar” inhale, allow the vibration or “energy signature” of the objectto ride on the breath and enter into your heart center. Experience the inhale asrefreshing, carrying with it the realization that the object is and always was apart of you. This is why Abhinava says the practitioner sees himself in allthings and thus becomes free from any desire for the other—for you cannot graspafter something unless you see it as separate from you. So in this practice, yourealize any object as a manifestation of your true essence-nature. It iswonderful to do this practice with beautiful symbolic objects on your altar,including deity forms. However, once you have the hang of that, you can graduateto the more challenging practice of doing this type of prāṇa-flow meditationwith objects that symbolize a challenging person or situation in your life. Byrealizing that person as a manifestation of your own essence-nature, you canshift the relationship in a more positive (i.e., productive) direction.Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the vibration of the object feels fully internalized.4. Next, due to the emergence of the equalizing vital energy [samāna] in theheart, one experiences repose in the unity.The practice of step 4 is one that is central to Tantrik yoga: extending,balancing, and equalizing the in- and out-breaths, while doing breath retentionbetween them. In its simplest form, this means lengthening the two breaths to(say) nine counts each, making them the same in terms of rate and smoothness offlow, and pausing in between, holding the breath for just as long as iscomfortable. An intermediate form would be holding the breath for as many countsas the inhale and exhale (e.g., 9-9-9). Advanced forms include adding an exhalepause (e.g., 9-9-9-9) or using a 1-4-2 ratio (for example, 4 count on theinhale, 16 on retention, and 8 on the exhale). But please do not practice theseprāṇāyāmas on the basis of this paragraph alone; you will need the guidance of aqualified teacher.The point of this is that if practiced long enough, the two breaths (prāṇa andapāna) will spontaneously fuse into samāna. You will know when this has happenedbecause, without any conscious effort on your part, the breath will become verysubtle, as if it is barely moving, then spontaneously become still for atimeless moment of eternity in which there are no thought-forms. This is whatAbhinava calls repose in the unity. All the Tantrik and haṭha-yoga texts referto the “unification” of the in- and out-breaths, suggesting the significance ofthis attainment. When breathing continues, after this it is effortlesslybalanced and even. Note that step 4 says that samāna emerges in the heart; if weunderstand that term to mean the “core,” it could be in the region of the navelas well as the physical heart.5. Then, when the fire of the up-breath [udāna] rises, he absorbs the operationsof the perceiver, the perceived, and the process of perception.There are two ways of practicing step 5. Following the moment of spontaneousstilling of the breath and mind described above, you can visualize the prāṇarising up the central channel on an exhale, hoping to trigger its actual risethrough the power of focused awareness and vivid imagination (which will work,if they are sufficiently developed). Or you can wait until it happensspontaneously of its own accord. That is, when the samāna fusion is perfected,the prāṇa-śakti will suddenly (and often forcefully) rise up the central channelin the form of the udāna, later called kundalinī-śakti.165[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en165] In this moment,Abhinava says, the three aspects of the dynamic flow of consciousness—theknower, act of knowing, and the known—collapse into unity, dissolving into thefire of the Supreme Knower, the ground of all three. This is why there is aspontaneous ascension toward the highest spiritual center, where Śiva eternallydwells.6. When the fire absorbing them subsides and the pervasive vital energy [vyāna]emerges, then one shines/vibrates, free of all limitations.The final stage of prāṇa-uccāra cannot be practiced, only experienced. As thefire of reabsorption rises up the central channel, it reaches the Sky ofConsciousness (cidākāśa) in the crown center, identical with transcendent Śiva.There the fire dies out (for lack of oxygen, as it were) in the vast space oflimitless stillness, which is nonetheless pregnant with infinite potentialenergy. If your practice is sufficiently developed, and you do not becomeunconscious (i.e., sleepy or numb) in this infinite Void, then the vyāna orpervasive vital energy spills forth from the crown center, infusing the blissfulnectar of the Absolute into every layer and level of your being, pervading everycell, flowing forth from every pore, and permeating the whole of reality withits coruscating incandescent light. What was previously experienced only as thetranscendent Core of your own identity now reveals itself as the totality of allthings. Sphurati, Abhinava says—he vibrates and shines (for the Sanskrit wordmeans both), free of all limitations, for he has become all things. Thestabilization of this state, called Mahāvyāpti or the Great Pervasion (alsoknown as turyātīta), is of course liberation and final awakening.However, if your saṃskāras of contracted existence are sufficiently strong, thenthis experience of the “nectar-pervasion” is incomplete or impermanent and mustbe returned to again and again through practice until it has obliterated thesaṃskāras that keep dragging you back into the unawakened state of being.Abhinava writes:Having reposed in these levels of uccāra, practicing them one by one, in sets oftwo, or all together, one reaches that Supreme Reality of grounded and centeredawareness, beyond the body, prāṇa, mind, and void. (Tantrasāra: ch. 5)The uccāra can also be practiced with bīja-mantras or seed-syllables, asAbhinava’s next words suggest:That is precisely the secret of performing uccāra with the seed-syllables ofcreation and dissolution; synthesizing them with the breath, one will refine,purify, and perfect one’s mental constructs until they are perfectly alignedwith, and thereby dissolve into, the highest nondual nature of reality.The seed-syllables in question are the Trika’s key mantras, associated with Parāand Kālī respectively; they will not be given here. We can conclude thisdiscussion of Abhinava’s nondual gnostic uccāra practice by quoting his summaryverses for the practice:Reposing first in self-awareness and next on an object, one should completelyfill [oneself with] that object. One rests here in the expanded state; thenrapidly dissolves the distinction of Knower and Known. Then one reposes in theall-pervasive state. ||These five levels of the uccāra method—six if including [the first step] thespace of the heart—are the five prāṇas from the out-breath to thediffuse-breath, which are associated with the states of consciousness: waking,dream, deep sleep, the Fourth, and Beyond the Fourth. ||One who is committed to this practice quickly ascends to the radiant abode ofthe awareness of both creation and dissolution. ||karana: postures of the body and awarenessThe final type of yogic practice listed under the heading of the āṇava-upāya orIndividual/Embodied Means is that of karaṇa or postures. We have little evidenceof precisely what this term referred to in classical Tantra, apart from a fewexamples. We will explore these briefly here.In modern times, the term āsana is used to denote all sorts of physical posturesintended to stretch and condition the body (and ideally, to help us have anintegrated experience of our embodiment). This usage of the term dates from the18th century. From the point of view of tradition, it is something of amisappropriation of the term. The central meaning of the term āsana in Tantra isthat of “throne,” specifically the throne of the Deity in one’s visualizationpractice. The type of throne visualized is usually a padmāsana or lotus throne.By extension, āsana came to mean “seat,” and any seated posture for meditationcan be called an āsana, such as siddhāsana or padmāsana (a sitting posture namedafter the deity’s lotus throne). However, the general term for posture in thetradition is karaṇa, which can indicate inversions, dance poses, and subtleinternal adjustments as well as “postures of awareness.”What kind of karaṇas do we find in the Tantras? I have not done a thoroughexamination of the topic, but I will mention a few points of interest. Certainlythe most important karaṇa described in the Tantras is called the divya-karaṇa or“divine posture.” This subtle posture of the head, neck, and face is consideredcrucial for successful meditation. My meditation posture instructions, includingthe divya-karaṇa, go like this:Sit on a cushion that elevates the hips so that they are at least as high as theknees. Leaning forward, pull back on the flesh of the buttocks and upper thighsand then sit straight again, creating a gentle rotation in the hips that allowsthe spine to elongate upward more easily. Let the sit bones ground down firmly,while the crown of the head rises up, creating an elongation in the spine. Letthe head float at the top of the spine like a waterlily floating on the surfaceof a pond. [Divya-karaṇa:] Let the back of the neck be long and let the chindrop gently, unclenching the teeth and releasing the jaw. Let all the muscles ofthe face soften and release (you may wish to use your knuckles to massage youreyebrow ridges and jaw hinge to help them release). Let the eyes sink back inthe eye sockets. Finally, gently curl the tongue upward a bit and let its tippoint toward the crown of the head. All the other muscles of the face and headshould be slack.166 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en166]This simple but significant karaṇa can have a profound impact on your ability tolet go into meditation. As for the other karaṇas, we know that in the massiveTantrik compendium the Jayadratha-yāmala-tantra, there are dance forms calledkaraṇas that are prescribed for those who are doing a sādhanā of Goddess worshipthat includes dressing as and imitating whichever form of the Goddess is thefocus of their devotion. These passages have never been translated. We mightalso note that one of the modern-day yoga poses retains this ancient name,specifically the viparīta-karaṇī, the simple but powerfully restorativeinversion described in classic haṭha-yoga texts.In chapter 32 of his Tantrāloka, Abhinava Gupta implies that the words karaṇaand mudrā are nearly synonymous. For Abhinava (as for the haṭha-yoga manuals),mudrā means not just “hand gesture” but any posture of the hands, body, orawareness that arises spontaneously in profound meditation or mysticalexperience (samāveśa). In this definition, Abhinava alludes to the literalmeaning of mudrā as “seal” or “sign.” So, a mudrā is a sign of awakenedconsciousness, and Abhinava advocates that those who wish to awaken adopt andpractice the mudrās that kuṇḍalinī-śakti has revealed in advanced meditators.Just as a spontaneous mudrā is a sign of attainment, one can use a mudrā to sealthe experience of awakened consciousness. To put it another way, usingAbhinava’s language, a mudrā is both a reflection of an inner state and a meansof realizing that state (depending on whether the trajectory is outward orinward respectively).The most important mudrā for Abhinava is that called khecarī, which literallymeans “moving in the sky [of consciousness].” The real nature of this mudrā hadbeen forgotten by the time of the haṭha-yoga texts, which describe a verydifferent (and rather bizarre) procedure under that name.167[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en167] Abhinava devotes mostof chapter 32 to the khecarī-mudrā, which is essentially a name for a procedureof intensifying the “central energy” (a name for kuṇḍalinī-śakti) at the base ofthe spine and raising it to the crown of the head, achieving a higher state ofconsciousness thereby. As with all forms of Tantrik yoga, this is achieved by acombination of breath control, visualization, and mantra.Having abandoned the state of the void [ākāśa], he attains pure Being. Heabides, having unified the Trident [of Powers], like liquid dissolving intoliquid. Experiencing the Trident as a single staff [of energy], rising throughthe [three] spaces, O Beloved, he adopts the Khecarī Mudrā, meditating onhimself as Bhairava, embraced by the [Yoginīs] of the Khecarī circle.(Tantrāloka: 32.18–20)pūjā: ceremony of worshipThe final practice of Abhinava’s āṇava-upāya classification is that of pūjā,ritual worship, which Abhinava prefers to call sthāna-prakalpana, which hedefines as “visualizing [and worshipping] internal structures in externalsubstrates.” Though it is specialized, this definition of pūjā points us towardthe key element of Tantrik worship for all Tāntrikas: it consists in the main ofa procedure for summoning the energy of a particular deity into a form that cantemporarily house it, then worshipping that energy, that particular vibration ofthe one Consciousness, never confusing it with the form or image in which it ishoused. Though the worship is, of course, the consummation of the rite, the bulkof the pūjā ritual is concerned with the purifications and “divinizations” thatmake it possible to summon the energy of the deity. This makes sense, since itis only our karmic obstacles and contracted perception that hinder us fromexperiencing the divine power that is in reality present every moment. It isthese technologies of divinizing and summoning that are Tantra’s uniquecontribution in the arena of Indian ritual (though the summoning rite is nodoubt linked to much older, undocumented forms of shamanism).excursus on gods, spirits, andthe traditional worldviewIn articulating these technologies, the Tantra brought about a paradigm shift inIndian religions, integrating forms of popular religion into a sophisticatedyogic practice. You see, by the time of the beginning of the Tantrik movement(c. 5th century), the older Vedic religion had become so mechanized in itsritual that its own authorities believed that the deities named in these ritualshad no reality apart from their names. Though their names were mantras, theywere not seen by the ritualists as having mystical properties. In fact, at thattime the most conservative Vedic authorities were staunchly atheistic.Furthermore, they taught that one must perform the Vedic ritual for no reasonother than that the Veda tells you to do so. Nor did these authorities see anytruth in the myths and stories of the Veda, which, they said, have the solepurpose of inspiring impressionable people to perform the rituals. All this isvery different from the Tantrik View, which is closer to that of folk religionin that it sees the whole world as filled with energies, some of which might becalled “spirits,” and contends that these spirits can be contacted through thesound vibration of their mantras.Let us take a moment to explore this often misunderstood view. First, it isimportant to note that the questions that Westerners have when encountering sucha traditional worldview are not necessarily the questions asked by those in thetradition. For example, since the dominant belief system of the modern West ispsychology, Westerners want to know if the spirits of the traditional view arethought to have independent agency, because if not, they can be explained inpsychological terms as aspects of our own mind—which makes most Westerners quitecomfortable and prompts them to nod their heads wisely in understanding andagreement. We love to hear information that confirms and elaborates what we havealready decided (or been programmed to believe) is true. Westerners feel verycomfortable, if a bit lonely, in their entrenched belief that we humans are theonly self-aware beings around and that there certainly are no conscious beingsthat cannot be perceived with the usual five senses. However, before dismissingall other possibilities, we should first ponder the fact that no traditionalsociety that has ever existed agrees with this view. Further, we should notethat only modern technological societies that are no longer intimately connectedto nature hold this view. For the traditional human being, living in nature, theworld is absolutely full of seen and unseen beings with whom she must live in adelicate and respectful balance. They form a vast maṇḍala-hierarchy of consciouspower of which we are only a part. Some of these spirits are seen as theessences of tangible features of nature, such as tree-spirits (yakṣas) andsnake-spirits (nāgas). Others are not connected to a particular natural feature.Now, we are not overly distorting the traditional Indian view if we see thesespirits as energies, patterned flows of life-force energy. Though it is truethat most traditional people view spirits and gods as having agency (consciousvolition), they are instinctively less dualistic than we are. That is, thoughtheir ritual interactions with the spirits can look to us like a businessnegotiation with an independent unseen entity, the people performing the ritualssee them as simply part of their role in the natural pattern—their organicresponse to how the energy flows in their environment. This is substantiated bythe fact that Indian villagers who do not believe in the spirits as independententities perform the same rituals as those who do.The question of the existence and independence of spirit entities seemssignificant to Westerners because if the ancient Tāntrikas really believed that“superstitious nonsense,” we are tempted to dismiss their worldview altogether.It is also a question of fear—that is, Western materialists often becometerribly frightened when confronted with any evidence of the supernatural, which(probably due to the influence of rationalist Christianity) is instinctivelyseen as menacing and malevolent. However, the traditional Indian perspective onghosts and the like is quite matter-of-fact: these unseen spirits are just onemore challenge to negotiate in life and are often nothing to be particularlyfrightened of. If you are in respectful accord with the unseen beings, theydon’t mess with you. The unseen beings are really just like human beings: a feware benevolent, a few are malevolent, and the great majority couldn’t care lessabout you.Now that we have touched on the traditional view, let us address the view of anondualist Tāntrika regarding the unseen world. Being a nondualist, he is alsonaturally a monotheist—that is, he holds that there are not really many gods,but only One. In the Indian context, this does not mean that he worships Deityunder only one name (which is what it means for the Western monotheists).Rather, he pays homage to many deities as expressions of that One. (Knowingthis, you can see how it is easier for an Indian to believe that we are allequally the son of God, all divine incarnations.) The deity that is summoned andworshipped in pūjā ritual, then, is always an aspect of the Highest Divinity(parameśvara), but since it possesses its own unique character and qualities, itis propitiated for a purpose and in a manner unique to it.In his discussion of ritual matters, Abhinava Gupta often emphasizes thenondualist understanding because ritual can seem so dualistic. For example,since Deity—in any of its many forms—is all-pervasive and omnipresent, what isusually called “summoning” is correctly understood as “evoking awareness” of thepresence of that form of the Deity. Since performance of a daily ritual was,historically, the most prominent and visible aspect of Tantrik practice, let usinvestigate this topic more thoroughly, starting with the nondualist theory ofritual.only god can worship god:tantrik ritual theoryWhen we investigate Tantrik practices of yoga and ritual, the divisions andirreconcilable differences that seemed so clear on the level of doctrine—such asdualism versus nondualism—frequently dissolve. Thus, even though doctrinally theSaiddhāntika dualists hold that the individual soul and God are eternallyseparate, they also hold, along with the nondualists, that only God can worshipGod and that, therefore, one must transform oneself into a Śiva in order toworship Śiva. The difference between becoming “a” Śiva versus meditating on yourinnate universal Śiva-nature, while of importance to philosophers, is likely toseem academic to practitioners, especially when in both cases the forms of theritual are more or less identical. Remember that the whole Tantrik traditionshares the same ritual structure and types of yogic practice, regardless ofdoctrine.168 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en168] Whatdefines your lineage as opposed to someone else’s is primarily the specificmantra you are initiated into, the form of the Deity to which it corresponds,and that form’s retinue of related mantra-deities. Secondarily, whatdifferentiates you is the understanding that underlies and fuels your practice.I say secondarily from the perspective of the practice manuals; but in fact theview you hold of and in ritual performance ends up being crucial, for it directsthe energy of your efforts toward one goal or another, to spiritual liberationor to something less.Here is where the dualists and nondualists really part ways in the ritual arena:the former don’t believe that it matters whether ritual brings about an innerexperience, whereas the latter hold that ritual is only meaningful and effectiveto the extent that it successfully brings about an inner experience. In otherwords, the nondualists rigorously resisted the tendency toward routinization andmechanization that exists in every religion. This is discussed in the masterfuland seminal article by Alexis Sanderson, “Meaning in Tantric Ritual.” There heexplains that ritual can be meaningless, meaningful in a weak sense, ormeaningful in a strong sense. It is meaningful in a weak sense if the ritualperformer has an intellectual understanding of the symbolic meaning of theritual and its purpose. It is meaningful in a strong sense, however, if theritual expresses and evokes in him a liberating awareness of reality as heperforms it.169 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en169] Makingthis liberating awareness possible for the practitioner is precisely Abhinava’sgoal in the presentation of ritual theory he gives in chapter 15 of his Light onthe Tantras, which we will discuss below.First we must understand that for Abhinava, all acts of worship are modes ofsamāveśa, that is, methods of enacting and experiencing the immersion intodivine Reality that is both path and goal. The method by which ritual worshipaccomplishes this immersion, surprisingly, is the same method by whichmeditative contemplation of the ultimate Truth accomplishes it, that is, throughvikalpa-saṃskāra, which means “refinement and purification of thought-constructsto bring them into alignment with the nature of reality.” (See the previoussection on śākta-upāya.) It may not seem like that is what is happening with allthis ritual paraphernalia. But for a nondualist like Abhinava, for whom thebasic impurity (mala) is not a substance but simply ignorance, ritual must be aform of vikalpa-saṃskāra if it is even to be included in his system. And hecould not dispense with the daily ritual, since that was the mostwell-established form of Tantrik practice, the very base of the tradition.Nonetheless, he did risk controversy by arguing that some rare beings have theaptitude to attain full realization through the power of awareness alone,without recourse to action of any kind, and thus need not perform the practicesof yoga and kriyā (ritual). This is why Abhinava presents the other upāyasbefore āṇava-upāya: there is a slim possibility that you will attain fullliberation and awakening through them, without the need for āṇava practices. Butagain, note that other authorities argue that body-based practices are necessaryfor everyone, and if even if they are not, it could be hazardous to yourpractice to assume that you are one of the few that can attain completeliberation through reflection and intuition alone. What is certain is that 1)everyone benefits from the foundational practices (which include purificationand alignment of mind and body), and yet 2) no one attains complete liberationdue to those practices unless the practice comes to entrain all the levels ofbeing.Even if you believe that you are one of the rare ones who don’t need it, a dailyyoga and kriyā practice can only benefit you, since it will stabilize,integrate, and enhance the spontaneous realizations of Truth that you have had.If, like me, you have ever had a wonderful spiritual experience and thought thatyou would certainly dwell forevermore in the awareness it brought, yet found itslipping away in the ensuing days and weeks, that is because you had aninsufficient daily practice. You could not hold the energy of the experiencebecause your vessel was weak and leaky. Practice strengthens the vessel andplugs its leaks. The master Abhinava Gupta certainly didn’t need a dailyyoga/kriyā practice, but he did one all the same, either for the joy of it or,perhaps, because even the state of final awakening, which is not static,requires ongoing nourishment. (If you seek a path with a goal of completecessation, a point at which you can finally just stop, Tantra is not your path.)Let us return now to the notion of meaningful ritual and what sort ofunderstanding we can cultivate through ritual. (I should mention here that Ifrequently associate yoga and ritual because they are closely associated. AllTantrik ritual contains yogic elements, and all Tantrik yoga is to some extentritualized.) In Sanderson’s other major article on Tantrik ritual, “Maṇḍala andĀgamic Identity,” he explains the way in which ritual performance, properlyunderstood, can be a form of vikalpa-saṃskāra. In the performance of his dailyrites, the Tāntrika is in effect rehearsing the liberating intuition that histrue self is the undifferentiated Deity-ground that contains the divine Powersof Consciousness in blissful fusion (cidānanda-sanghaṭṭa). Through the internalmonologue of the ritual, Sanderson argues, the practitioner erodes his identityin the world of mutually exclusive subjects and objects and uses the mirror ofhis maṇḍala to project the vision of his true identity, an all-containing Selfthat includes not only the ordinary “I” but all “I”s and also the world ofobjects and values by which they believe themselves to be conditioned. Thus hisritual and his meditation serve to create a domain of awareness in which theboundaries that hem in his lower, public self are absent. Through constantrepetition (abhyāsa), they transform this visionary projection and creativecontemplation (bhāvanā) into his fundamental identity, experienced in everymoment. Sanderson concludes: “Thus the scriptural Word-essence which entered himthrough his initiation speaks with ever increasing clarity and consistency asthe continuum of his ritual and meditation until at last it falls silent inunquestioning self-knowledge.”170[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en170]Now that we have Sanderson’s beautifully written explanation as a framework toguide our understanding, let us consider Abhinava Gupta’s writing on thissubject in the middle of Tantrāloka, chapter 15, which I was fortunate enough tostudy with Sanderson himself at Oxford. Abhinava says that in NŚT, ritualworship brings about “a state of identity of all the factors of action withŚiva,” (Tantrāloka 15.147).The factors of action are the ritual agent, the object of his worship, theinstrument(s) of that worship, the purpose of the worship, the point from whichthe worship proceeds, and the locus of the worship (these correspond to thedifferent grammatical cases of the Sanskrit language). So in other words,Abhinava is saying that the correct understanding that ought to be cultivated inritual performance is this: “I, God, worship God, by means of God, on God, fromGod, and for the sake of God alone.”171[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en171] This is called “thenonduality of the factors of action.” It is the realization that all thesedifferent elements—cause, effect, agent, instrument, and discursive purpose—areonly different from the perspective of the mind. In fact, they are allConsciousness, the one white light diffracting itself as it were into a spectrumof colors to make beautiful art. This viewpoint presents ritual as play, donefor no other reason than to express and embody our innate divinity. Not only isthis the only possible view for a nondualist to have of ritual, it is a crucialunderstanding to have if we wish to avoid the strengthening of the āṇava-malathat is caused by ritual performed with the false view “I, a helpless patheticcreature, petition a separate deity for his favor, that I might be blessed withsome advantage.” Not only is it false view for the obvious reason, but alsobecause the goal of liberation will never be reached by the accumulation ofadvantages. This view is spiritual materialism, an insidious impostormasquerading as the true spiritual life.Abhinava teaches that ritual with nondual understanding is a practice ground, arehearsal space for experiencing nonduality in daily life. Ritual worship is aparadigm to be actualized and embodied in one’s daily activities. He writes:Just as a well-trained horse when loosed from the reins keeps the discipline ofhis training even in the midst of chaotic battle, in the same way, one for whomall the factors of action have become God through repeated practice of the actof worship dispels the duality of the factors of action even in everyday acts.(Tantrāloka 15.149–150)That is to say, by practicing nondual awareness within the intensified andcontrolled context of ritual action, we pave the way for spontaneously arisingnondual awareness in all our mundane activities. In other words, by the“overspill” principle, once we experience the nonduality of the factors ofaction intensely enough in the context of ritual or yoga, then we start tospontaneously experience the same in everyday life. Washing the dishes orwalking down the street, taking care of the children or carrying the laundry:all become the beautiful play of God, the one Actor, the one Light diffractingitself into these various colors. Without duality of action (the mind-world of“I need to get this done; if I give this to that person then this will happen;he did this to me and now I have to do this;” etc.) we relax into natural easeand flow, listening to and serving the organic movements of the deeper patternand surrendering doership. (This sounds like a very high attainment to some, butin fact it is your natural state, revealed when your mental constructs aboutaction are dissolved.) And indeed, if this overspill into everyday life does nottake place, you are maintaining the artificial divide between spiritual andworldly life characteristic of dualistic religions. If you notice such a divide,then the Tantra challenges you to erase those artificial boundaries, because thespiritual life is not serving its real purpose if it remains confined to theyoga studio or temple or meditation room.Abhinava culminates this fascinating and crucial discussion with one of myall-time favorite passages, soaked in the joy of his fully awakenedconsciousness:For one who is dedicated to the constant practice of unity in this way, thiswhole universe will powerfully explode into life, revealing itself as [it reallyis:] dancing ecstatically in the intense animation of its all-encompassing andperfect divinity.172 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en172]As my Guru’s Guru has said in his Hymn of Worship, “Ah! The extraordinaryfestival that is worship of God, full of sweet nectar, in which the activationof all thirty-six levels of reality fully unfolds.”173[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en173]Those who offer worship of this kind, only to attain this state in which theybecome immersed in the experience of the universe as the perfect fullness ofGod, are themselves Divine. What goal remains for those who are alreadyperfectly full?174 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en174](Tantrāloka 15.151ff)Perhaps inspired by this passage, we find a similar sentiment in Nāga’s hymn,Thirty Verses on True Worship, a Krama hymn that argues that a rite of worshipdevoid of spiritual experience hardly deserves the name:175[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en175]What kind of worship is it in which one does not let go of the travails of one’sworldly life, gazing at the fullness that, beautiful with the unfolding of theHeart, pervades the Sky of Consciousness as the cycle of its five flows?What kind of worship is it in which one does not discover the upsurge ofexpanded consciousness within each and every movement of awareness, takingrefuge in sudden meditation [sāhasa-samādhi], flooded with vibrating pureawareness? (Nāga’s Thirty Verses on True Worship)So it is clear that for some lineages of NŚT, ritual worship (pūjā) was a modeof bringing about awakened consciousness, just as all the other practices were.the structure of tantrik ritualNow that we have a good sense of why ritual is performed in NŚT, and theattitude to be cultivated in doing it, let us turn to what Tantrik ritualactually looks like. Note that I use the present tense, for this is the facet ofTantra that has most obviously survived the vicissitudes of time and foreignconquest. The forms of ritual preserved in Śaiva and Śākta temples today arethoroughly imbued by the Tantrik model, even though the performers of theserituals may be unaware of this fact.However, the heart of Tantrik ritual practice in the classical period hadnothing to do with temples and public religion. Instead, it was the rite thatinitiates performed every day in private with their own small, personalconsecrated image as the foundation of Tantrik ritual. When we look at themainstream of Tantra throughout the era of its flourishing, we see that to be aTāntrika meant, first and foremost, to be an initiate into the veneration of aspecific Tantrik mantra-deity and to do worship of that deity every day.What are these “deities” (devas) really? The answer to that question varieswidely depending on which sect we are looking at. For some, they are consideredactual “persons,” incomprehensibly powerful beings whom we can enter intorelationship with, and who are empowered by our worship even as we are blessedby them. For others, the deities are simply particular vibrations of the Light(deva actually means “shining one”), harmonic frequencies as it were of the Oneenergy, experienced by us as distinct flavors of exalted Consciousness. What Ifind interesting is that Tāntrikas on both ends of the spectrum just describedagree that the primary mantra of a deity is that deity in sound form. Thus,unlike in some other religions, you can (and must) have direct contact with yourdeity every day: by reciting their mantra, you are caressing their “sonic body”with your very tongue. Of course, you must be initiated into their mantra for itto be alive (caitanya) for you (though on rare occasions, a mantra canspontaneously come to life for someone—if this has ever happened to you, youwill not have to ask whether it has). A dead or inert (jaḍa) mantra is just aword.Thus, when we enquire into the nature of a Tantrik deity, we find four aspectsin play, three “bodies” (mūrti) and one essence (svabhāva). From coarse tosubtle, less essential to more essential, we have 1) the anthropomorphic,iconographic image of the deity (having so many arms, holding certain symbolicimplements, etc.); 2) the maṇḍala or mystic diagram of the deity (nowadays alsocalled yantra176 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en176]); 3)the mantra of the deity; and 4) the essence-nature or energy of the deity, whichmay or may not inhabit any of the previous three bodies. The mantra is the mostessential of the three bodies because the deity’s energy always inheres in it ifyou received it in an alive state, that is, if you were initiated into it by aqualified guru or ācārya for whom it is fully alive. By contrast, the deity mustbe summoned into the first two bodies on every occasion of worship. This is whywe use the phrase “mantra-deity” to refer to the fundamental form of energy thatan initiate works with in ritual. Remember that in the classical period ŚaivaTantra’s own name for itself was Mantra-mārga, “the Way of Mantras.” Now you arebeginning to see why.A practitioner may summon the energy of the deity into other prescribedsubstrates as well (any of which can serve as body #1 above). The classical listfollows: a smooth, mirror-like surface; a liṅga; a rosary (mālā); a skull-cup; askull-staff (khaṭvānga); a statue of Himālayan cedar, gold, or of fired andpainted clay; a sword; a mirror; a Tantrik scripture; a painting of the deity oncloth; or an image incised on a human skull.177[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en177]Ritual Images [image/fourimages.jpg]It is crucial to note here that the energy of the deity can equally well besummoned into an internal substrate (such as a visualization) as well as anexternal one (such as a statue, image, or mystic diagram). Indeed, the innerrite is primary, for the external rite cannot be performed without the innerone, but the reverse is not true.outline of tantrik ritual based onthe original sources178 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en178]Daily Tantrik ritual has these three basic components:I. Worship of the door-guardians and removal of obstaclesII. Five types of purification/divinization (pañca-śuddhi) and inner worship(antar-yāga)III. External worshipExternal worship can sometimes be omitted (according to some authorities),indicating that the inner worship is the indispensible feature of the dailypractice. Even those omitting external worship will always perform it on thedays (or nights) sacred to the tradition, such as the eighth and fourteenthnights of each lunar cycle. The second and third items above stand for a complexarray of procedures that may be summarized as follows:II. Five types of purification/divinization (pañca-śuddhi):1. Purification of the site2. Purification of one’s body and subtle body, followed by a procedure of innerworship (antar-yāga) and meditation on oneself as a manifestation of the deity(śiva-karaṇa)3. Purification of the materials for worship4. Purification of the mantras5. Purification of the liṅga or iconIII. External worship1. Worship of the deity’s throne (āsana)2. Installation of the deity’s substrate or seed-form (mūrti)3. Summoning the energy of the deitya. āvāhana (invoking)b. sthāpana (establishing)c. sannidhāna (fixing)4. Installation of the deity’s “limbs” and retinue (as mantras)5. Worship: offerings ofa. water for foot-washing and mouth-rinsingb. arghya (a mixture of water, herbal leaves andfragrant substances)c. flowers (puṣpa)d. incense (dhūpa)e. flame (dīpa)f. food (naivedya)6. Showing the mudrā7. Japa (repetition of the deity’s mantras), offering of the japa8. Circumambulation (pradakṣiṇa), prostration9. Fire-offerings (homa)—optional according to some10. Offering up of the ritual and its fruit (karma-nivedana)11. Dissolving the maṇḍala (visarjana)This 16-step outline is somewhat abbreviated, but it gives some sense of thecomplexity of Tantrik ritual. An elaborated version can take almost three hoursto perform; a streamlined version, a third of that time. It is a ritual that islayered with meaning, though the ritual agent need not understand the specificmeaning and function of each given act in order to be moved by the power of thewhole. Let’s discuss some of the salient points; note that this is far from acomplete treatment.i. worship of the door-guardians and removal of obstaclesIn the ancient Indian view, all kinds of beings are drawn to power-centers, likewild animals to a water hole, and not all of them are benevolent to yourpractice. Thus the ritual space must be cleared and protected with mantras andvisualizations. One of the first things one does, before entering the sacredspace (yāga-gṛham), is to infuse one’s weapon-mantra into a flower and cast itinto the sanctum. This functions as a kind of flower-grenade, driving out allthe various spirits floating around. As we have already seen, this is done evenif you don’t believe in these vighnas, beings that can impede your worship; foryou certainly believe in the “hinderers of yoga”: laziness, illness, negligence,apathy, uncertainty, lack of concentration, lack of confidence, depression,distraction, inhibition, and, first among them all, carelessness. Now, thesestates of mind are denoted by the same word in Sanskrit as the impeding spirits,vighna, which tells us that the former are really the embodiments of the latter.The traditional mind did not see a significant difference between the two usesof the word; and if you do, it is perhaps not so very important. Vighnas ofwhatever kind must be removed before proceeding, and this is why we honorGanesh, also known as Vighneśvara, at the beginning of any undertaking. Notealso that making namas (activating the feeling of devotion with a reverent bow)itself helps to dispel such obstacles.179[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en179]ii. five types of purification/divinizationHaving dispelled obstacles and impeders, the space is consecrated andenergetically sealed. This is done, like all actions in Tantrik ritual, by asynchronous combination of mantras, mudrās (hand gestures), and visualization.This integration of the faculties of body, mind, and spirit in a single actionis also crucial for determining how the ritual impacts our being.In the dualist camp, prior to the ritual one must perform purification ofoneself, the site, the ritual implements, the mantras, and the image orsubstrate. The nondualist performs the same actions but understands themdifferently. He is purifying his awareness of these things, that is, activatinghis understanding that they are nothing but divine Consciousness, that they arenon-different from Śiva. Even though they were just as divine before such“purification,” from our non-enlightened perspective this is experienced as aninfusion of energy that sanctifies and divinizes the things in question.The second of these “purifications,” called ātma-śuddhi or self-divinization, isthe most important. It takes quite a bit more time than the other steps, for itincludes the all-important meditative contemplation called “inner worship.” Thisconsists of the following steps: 1. Elimination of one’s conception of the body as gross matter, and also one’s identification with it, by incinerating it with psychic fire and blowing away the ashes that represent the subtle impressions of body-identification (= deha-śuddhi, also called tattva-śuddhi or bhūta-śuddhi if one purifies the body in the sequence of the five great elements) 2. Creation of a divine energy-body or body of radiant light through the installation and activation of the mantras of the deity and her retinue of emanations 3. Worship of oneself as a manifestation of one’s deity, using visualized offeringsAfter these steps of self-divinization, one proceeds with the inner worship,which is also three steps. 1. Installation of the deity’s throne in one’s life-force energy (e.g., for the Trika, this would be the trident with three surmounted white lotuses, installed along the central channel of prāṇa) 2. Installation of deity and retinue as mantras and visualizations 3. Worship of the deity’s power in the form of this visualized three-dimensional deity-maṇḍala made of light and soundiii. external worshipThen, having consecrated water (or, in left-hand ritual, wine) and havingsprinkled it on the image, the ritual implements, and so on, one proceeds toexternal worship. Summoning the energy of the deity into the external substrateand fixing it there (using, again, mantra-mudrā-visualization), one installs thefull retinue of emanations and guardians (the deity’s yāga) and then offersworship in the form of offerings of elemental substances (water, fire, etc.) inthe forms that are presented to an honored guest or king. Tantrik pūjā is ofcourse highly sensual: beautiful flowers in abundance, sweet water or wine,herbs, sublime scents of incense and sandalwood paste, bright flames, anddelicious food all serve to gratify the goddesses of the senses to repletion.After all the offerings, there is “showing the mudrā,” which in the very ancienttradition consisted of imitating the deity in ways that would strike us asbizarre, frightening, amusing, or perhaps “primitive.” Sometimes this could takethe form of possession-dance. In the mature classical Tantra, however, showingthe mudrā was entirely internal, a posture (karaṇa) of Consciousness. A simpleexample of this is śāmbhavī mudrā, whereby your eyes are kept wide open (likethe deity Bhairava) but your awareness is entirely directed within. In theTrika, this step of the ritual consisted of performing khecarī mudrā, which aswe have seen, means raising the kuṇḍalinī energy up the spine.After ritually circling the sacred space and bowing, there are fire-offerings tobe made on special occasions (such as, for Śaivas, the eighth and fourteenthdays of each lunar cycle) before one proceeds to offer the fruit of the rite forthe benefit of all beings and finally dissolves the maṇḍala, releasing theenergies that have been bound into the sacred space.This brings us to the end of our discussion of āṇava-upāya, the method thatemphasizes the Power of Action, relies on techniques taught in the scriptures,and utilizes external supports for the development of consciousness, andtherefore is appropriate for those who perceive primarily in terms ofsubject-object duality. Remember that we have only touched on those āṇava-upāyapractices that are not already well understood; there are of course many morethat are commonly taught as yoga today, if by yoga we mean not only what iscommonly taught in yoga studios but also what is taught under trademarks likeIntegral Yoga, Siddha Yoga, Bihar Yoga, and Adi-yoga. The latter school teachesthe largest number of Tantrik practices of any modern school I am aware of.This also concludes our presentation of the upāyas, or means to liberation, andof the practice section of the book."},{"pageContent":"Conclusionundertaking a tantrik sādhanā inthe modern worldHaving learned in detail about the incredibly rich and powerful array of Tantrikteachings and practices, some are naturally drawn to undertake a Tantrikpractice or at least incorporate elements of it into their existing yogapractice. But this is problematic and cannot be done without careful reflectionon the various caveats that naturally emerge from a study of the originalcontext of these practices. Indeed, European scholars of the Tantra areincredulous and bemused when they learn of Americans’ desire to engage in thepractice of this spiritual tradition. This incredulity is not without reason,for they are aware of some of the obstacles that face a Westerner approachingthe tradition with this intent. Given that some readers of this book will wantto undertake the practice, and given my own belief that a revival of a practicetradition of nondual Śaiva Tantra would be of benefit to all beings, I will hereaddress some of these challenges and how they might be overcome. Even if youdisagree that the issues addressed below constitute real hurdles, you are alwayswell served by tempering headlong enthusiasm into careful, responsible, devotedengagement.First is the problem of access. Most of the Tantrik lineages have died out, mostof the scriptures are unpublished, nearly all of them exist only in Sanskrit,and many of them exist in such a linguistically corrupted condition that onlythe best European scholars can repair them (there are virtually no Americanscholars with adequate linguistic training to do this).The issue of access is linked to that of secrecy; the tradition has alwaysprotected itself from dilution by giving out powerful teachings sparingly andonly to those who prove their dedication. Those few remaining Indian Tantrikteachers from India, Nepāl, and Tibet are reluctant to impart their higherteachings to Westerners, and with good reason: talk to any traditional teacherin India—of music, of Sanskrit, of cooking, whatever—and they will tell you thatperhaps one percent of their Western students stay long enough to master thediscipline. Westerners simply do not (in general) exhibit the patience andstaying power these traditions require. Now, this book helps mitigate theproblem of access and of secrecy but introduces a further problem: some who readit will believe that they are qualified to undertake the practice by the veryfact of having read it. In fact, the tradition is unanimous in declaring thatmantras and practices obtained from a book are inert and useless unlessactivated in relationship with a qualified teacher. Believing otherwise can leadyou astray.The problem of the role of the guru, discussed briefly above, is also partiallya problem of access. We are faced with the choice between Asian masters whoseEnglish is frequently not fluent enough for us to determine whether it is theirunderstanding or just their vocabulary that lacks nuance and depth, and Westernteachers who are often charismatic and eloquent but grossly premature in theirdecision to take up the mantle of guru. Given the situation, I personallyrecommend that the interested student of the Tantra follow Abhinava’s suggestionand fly like a bee from flower to flower, gathering sweet nectar from all butstill always seeking the one flower (teacher) that seems to offer aninexhaustible wellspring of nectar and thus merits a prolonged stay. Later inthis section I name a variety of teachers with whom one might engage thisprocess. Note that it is sitting with teachers in person that I am referring to,not just reading their books. The blueprint of a house is not a house.Another issue in the potential revival of Śaiva Tantra is the problem of itsconnection to the culture in which it finds itself. This requires someexplanation. Historically, Shaivism spread only to those regions of the world inwhich the orthodox brāhminical culture of India preceded it—specifically,Southeast Asia and Indonesia. This was because Śaiva Tantra was for the mostpart inextricably linked to the Vedic religion that it transcended. That is, theinitiation ritual that was so central to the Tantra was carefully calibrated toeradicate the sense of egoic identity that was constructed by brāhminicalsociety. You have no doubt gathered by now that the dissolution of self-imagesor identity constructs is central to the liberative process of Tantrik practice,and this is encoded in its initiation rituals. Now, if these rituals were to beperformed in (say) the Judeo-Christian United States, they would have to berewritten to eradicate the specific identity constructs that are notVeda-determined but Bible-determined (where “Veda” and “Bible” include all therules, programs, and narratives about reality sanctioned by the orthodoxy ofthose particular communities).Now, what is particularly interesting about the Tantra is that in this processit did not seek to condemn or repudiate the religious culture it liberated theinitiate from. Quite the opposite. A Tāntrika was supposed to maintain hisrespectable outer civic and religious identity, if only as a kind of costume toconceal an empowered “Tantrik Self” free of all socially-constructeddeterminants and compulsions. It is this latter Self that the Tāntrika sees asher real identity, so she does not feel bound by the role she plays in normalsociety (what one Tantrik scholar calls the Clark Kent/Superman paradigm). TheTāntrika was not to see the socially sanctioned civic religion as having anyspiritual value whatsoever, except where it pointed toward the esoteric Tantrikrevelation that alone could lift one out of social and egoic constructs ofidentity (since actualizing the Tantrik Self was not the mere replacement of onereligious identity with another, but rather meant realizing one’s essence as theabsolutely indescribable, transindividual, transmental, all-encompassing andunlimited Light of Consciousness itself). Thus, a faithful revival of originalTantra would have to be tailored to the specific culture that it transcends.This makes sense if we understand that freedom is not attained by merelyasserting it—one must thoroughly see and understand that which is transcended,or the transcendence is illusory, whereby one has merely replaced one identityconstruct with another, and is therefore equally limited. To live in a vikalpaof the Truth is far distant from living in the Truth, though it may feel goodrelative to one’s previous identity.Śaiva Tantra as traditionally conceived could not exist without the base of thetranscended, that is, the specific civic cultural and religious identity that itexpands out of. To put it another way, there is a strange but true paradox inoperation here: you must first have a strong and healthy ego in order to gobeyond all ego. There must be a specific identity for you to transcend,otherwise your process of transformation is not sufficiently rooted in the real.In medieval India, that identity was highly Veda-determined, and thus everyonehad more or less the same set of hang-ups. This is not the case in the diversemodern West. This hurdle could be overcome if the guru designed an initiationritual specific to each individual, but this presupposes that he has a cleargrasp of each individual’s psychology. You begin to see the problem: in modernAmerica (or England, France, etc.) since traditional societies are nownonexistent, everyone has a more or less unique set of psychological programs tobe overcome. Hence the original purpose of the dīkṣā ritual, absolutely centralto Tantra, is negated. The enormous challenge that faces the modern Tantrikteacher, then, consists in part of helping students to find ways to releasetheir self-images without knowing what all those self-images are.The next problem I wish to address is the public perception of Tantra asprimarily connected with sex. With regard to the Indian tradition, as we haveseen, this is manifestly untrue: none of the scriptural sources of Śaiva Tantrateach a sexual ritual or sexual techniques of any kind.180 One of thepost-scriptural sources does teach a sexual ritual drawn from the Kaulatradition: this is chapter 29 of Abhinava Gupta’s Tantrāloka. But this is notthe source for modern American neo-tantra, since a) it has never beentranslated, and b) the meditative rite it describes is almost wholly unlike whatis taught in “Tantric sex” workshops. What, then, is the source of the latter?Though it remains mysterious, it is likely that all teaching of so-called“Tantric sex” in North America can ultimately be traced back to Pierre Bernard,a.k.a. “Oom the Omnipotent,” who taught a bizarre and idiosyncratic version ofyoga and tantra beginning in San Francisco in 1905. (See The Subtle Body byStephanie Syman, The Great Oom by Robert Love, and Hugh Urban’s detailed article[http://www.esoteric.msu.edu/VolumeIII/HTML/Oom.html].) He was the first“spiritual teacher” in America to use Tantrik teachings to satisfy hisprodigious sexual cravings (the beginning of a long and sordid history). Hereceived his information from a Bengali immigrant who moved to his native Iowa(Bengal is the only part of India where Tantra with a sexual dimension survivedto the modern period).For centuries, the Western imagination has been titillated by its image of the“exotic Orient” and fascinated by apparent evidence of a much more advancedsexual culture, as exemplified by everything from Japanese geishas to the IndianKāma-sūtra. This helps explain why early Western interest in Tantra focused onrumors of a strange sexual rite. Some, disgusted by the notion, proffered it asevidence of the moral degeneration of India; others, profoundly attracted by thesame notion, thought it might be the key to bringing sex out of the realm ofsin. But virtually none had any direct experience of the reality behind therumors. People like Pierre Bernard and Aleister Crowley, lacking access to theoriginal sources, simply invented their own “sex magick” rites, inspired by thelittle they knew of Tantra, and these have now evolved for over a hundred years.Though there is no direct connection between modern “Tantric sex” and the sexualritual of original Śaiva Tantra, we will take a moment to describe the latter sothat we can see how different it really is. First, this ritual did not havepleasure as its purpose: it was primarily a means to transcend the contractedbrāhminical notions around purity and impurity, which were specific to Indianculture. There were two versions of the transgressive ritual. One versionfocused on the “five jewels,” transgressive substances to be used in worship andingested by the worshipper: these were semen, menses, urine, feces, and phlegm.Small quantities of these substances were used, made palatable by being immersedin a generous portion of wine. These were the most “impure” substances known toIndian culture; their consumption, therefore, was considered proof that thepractitioner had gone beyond the petty dualistic notion that some things arepurer or more divine than others. The second version of the transgressive ritualentailed the use of the “three M’s”: meat (māṃsa), wine (madya), andextramarital intercourse (maithuna).181 You may be thinking, that sounds morelike neo-tantra. But this second version of the rite is not fundamentallydissimilar from the first, for both were designed to confront the practitionerwith substances and acts that were, in that cultural environment, regarded witha horror that a modern “free-thinking” person can scarcely imagine. Thisconfrontation was essentially a challenge to “walk the talk” of the nondualteachings; for after all, these substances in actuality are manifestations ofthe same divine Light that exists in lovely flowers, puppies, and babies. But ifyou recoil at the “five jewels,” that is taken as evidence that you do notreally believe in your heart and gut that all things equally partake of the samedivine Light. (If you protest here, saying your concern is merely hygienic, theKaula Tāntrikas answer that a strong energy body can digest anything withoutharm to itself.)The ritual of the “three M’s” seems more pleasant than that of the “fivejewels,” and indeed it was constituted along Kaula lines with the concern forsensual aesthetic beauty central to that lineage. But the real nail in thecoffin for those who fantasize about so-called “Tantric sex” is this: asspecified clearly in Tantrāloka chapter 29, one’s partner in the sexual ritualmust be someone that you are not attracted to, lest the drive of ordinary sexualdesire take over, which would spoil the liberative purpose of the ritual. (Thisis why a partner other than one’s spouse is assumed as the default.)Furthermore, if the practitioner is high-caste, the partner (dūtī) should below-caste so as to challenge him to overcome the cultural construct thatdifferentiates caste and social status—since the rite requires him to perceivehis partner as an incarnation of the Divine. But first and foremost, forAbhinava, the kula-yāga or sexual ritual is a form of meditation. Indeed, heargues that for the advanced and lust-free practitioner, the kula-yāga can be adirect means to liberation.Now you can see that a re-creation of the transgressive ritual would have to betailored to the culture of the one doing the practice. For example, a student ofmine joked, a Californian super-green new age-type person would have to eat aMcDonald’s hamburger while seeing it as a manifestation of divine Consciousness.While humorous, this is along the lines that we must be thinking if we areserious about the spiritual work that the transgressive ritual represents.The next problem I will deal with in this section is one that will not concernevery reader but still seems worth addressing. This is the problem of whetherthe tradition itself sanctions the initiation of foreigners or non-Indian“barbarians” (mlecchas) into the Tantrik mysteries. After all (assuming you arenot Groucho Marx), would you want to be a member of a religion that doesn’t wantyou? Any Westerner who has been turned away from a Hindu temple on the basis ofthe color of his skin will realize this is a significant concern. (BuddhistTantra, as the extension of a proselytizing religion, did not have thisproblem.) However, we find that, in fact, the Śaiva Tantrik scriptures doapprove of the initiation of foreigners in the context of their assertionsregarding the nonreality of caste. The primary sources argue, in a manner thatis startlingly modern in its critique, that caste is nothing but a culturalconstruct (kalpanā) without basis in fact, and that therefore all devotees ofGod (Śiva) form a single community regardless of birth. The scripture calledPauṣkara-pārameśvara further argues:There is only one caste, that of human beings. No “caste” was ordained for them,nor color such as white. All arise from the union of a linga and a yoni, andthus all souls are one and the same. One who has the eye of wisdom sees God inall of them.182 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en182](Pauṣkara-pārameśvara)Though this concept must seem obvious to a modern Western reader, being afundamental value for us, I cannot begin to communicate how unusual it is toread a statement like this in an ancient Indian source. Seeing it in theoriginal Sanskrit is like recognizing the signature of someone who has travelledback in time from our era. This repudiation of caste was only fully embraced inpractice by the left current, in which referring to (let alone disparaging) theformer caste of a fellow initiate merited expulsion from the spiritualcommunity. This egalitarianism was remarkably transgressive behavior in thecontext of medieval India (and, in the end, it was not tolerated). Further, wehave two commentators on record saying that it would be better to initiate asincere foreigner than an insincere brāhmin, supporting my earlier comments thatinitiation was based, above all, on the sincere longing of the candidate. Sinceit was the left-current Kaula-influenced lineages that argued this, they wouldbe the most appropriate for Westerners to practice in. A happy coincidence,then, since these are the lineages whose teachings I find Westerners mostresonating with.Lastly, there is the problem of how modern Westerners would like to practicetheir Tantra. The problem is this: for most of the history of the tradition, thecentral element of being a Tāntrika was the performance of a fairly involveddaily ritual practice and a variety of additional duties modern Westerners wouldlikely find onerous. Fortunately, however, the tradition has provided for avariety of possibilities better suited to the 21st century (which is not to saythere would be no benefit to such a major practice commitment; indeed, the moreobstacles there are to a practice, the greater fruit it is thought to bear). Forexample, in lieu of the involved and expensive dīkṣā initiation ritual, Abhinavaprovides in chapter 30 of Light on the Tantras a simple form of Kaulainitiation, empowering the recipient with the three Wisdom-Goddess mantras thatare thought to be so powerful that recitation of them every day can substitutefor a ritual practice.The Krama tradition, while providing for a detailed ritual life, does notrequire it, allowing for a practice centering solely on the contemplation andinternalization of the compressed power-statements called chummās that containrevelatory teachings in seed-form, if these are properly received from aqualified teacher and worked with in the context of a community of initiates.This option makes the Krama the logical school of choice for modern Westernpractitioners to align themselves with, along with the fact that, as the schoolthat most successfully freed itself from dominant cultural programs we wouldprobably call sexist and racist, it was naturally the most empowering to womenand the most likely to initiate non-Indians. I would argue that the Krama is theTantrik school par excellence, the consummation of the tradition, in that ittakes dimensions of Tantrik thought that are nascent or partially inhibited inother schools and allows them to come to full development. In other words, ofall the Tantrik traditions, the Krama is the most transcendent of the culturalframework that birthed it. Furthermore, it is the most sophisticated in itsanalysis of Consciousness, articulating a meditation on the process of cognitionthat is universal, applying as it does to all sentient beings. And finally, itis the Śaiva school most closely aligned with certain Buddhist Tantrik lineagesthat are still alive today (i.e., Dzogchen and Mahāmudrā), which constitute anallied sister tradition to the Krama. For these reasons and more, to be exploredin another publication, the Kaula Krama or Mahārtha presents itself as theschool of nondual Śaiva Tantra that 21st century Westerners could practice mostauthentically.afterwordmodern survivals of śaiva tantra; or, “where can i learn more?”Though Śaiva Tantra is the oldest documented type of Tantra, from which theothers clearly derive, it almost did not survive to the present. It is quiteamazing that Shaivism, once the dominant religion of all of the Indiansubcontinent and much of Southeast Asia and Indonesia, is very nearly forgottentoday, despite its enormous influence on whole cultures (like Nepāl and Tibet)and despite the fact that millions still see its beautiful edifices (likeBṛhadīśvara temple in Tamiḷ Nāḍu or Angkor Wat in Cambodia), thousands seeversions of its rituals (in temples in Nepāl as well as in the far South and farEast of India), and millions in the West know its basic doctrines, if only asclichés—for the influential ’60s idea that “it’s all one Consciousness” can betraced to spiritual teachers influenced by Tantrik ideas (whether they knew itor not).Yet Shaivism has passed through the eye of the needle, the point at which it wasalmost lost and has been regaining ground ever since. That point was themid-20th century. The last proper Śaiva Tantrik dīkṣā ceremonies were performedin Kashmīr in the 1920s, and their purpose had been forgotten well before that.Yet at precisely that time, the Mahārāja of Kashmīr, a Hindu king of an almostentirely Muslim region, saw fit to commission the publication (in the originalSanskrit) of all the major Tantrik texts still existing in the region, whichturned out to be quite a lot. And thank God he did—the publication of thehundred-odd volumes of the “Kashmīr Series of Texts and Studies” was the mostcrucial 20th-century event for the preservation of original Tantra. Wonderingwhat to do with all these books that virtually no one in their own country caredto read, the Kashmīr government gave sets of them to Western universitylibraries, none of which had the slightest idea initially of what they hadreceived. But some European scholars began to read these texts, and in the 1960sand ’70s a few of them (including Alexis Sanderson) trickled into Kashmīr to sitwith the last remaining teacher of this philosophy in the region, Swāmī LakṣmanJū of Śrīnagar. He taught them, as well as the young people who were alsoshowing up seeking spiritual understanding in the mysterious East. Lakṣman Jūwas familiar with many concepts of Tantrik philosophy, though the rituals andyoga and more transgressive teachings had all been forgotten. By contrast, atthe other end of India (in the far South), the rituals and yoga had beenpartially preserved, while the specific Tantrik View teachings were forgotten.Lakṣman Jū’s Western students, and a small handful of Indian scholars connectedwith him (e.g., Rāmeshwar Jha), began nursing the knowledge of this traditionback to health. For a long time, no one even realized that the gnostic TrikaShaivism of Kashmīr and the ritualized Śaiva Siddhānta of Tamiḷ Nāḍu were twoattenuated forms of one and the same tradition, the ancient religion of ŚaivaTantra. Today, a few dozen scholars are laboring intensively to document theoriginal teachings and practices, though they are sorely overburdened: literallyhundreds of key texts are unpublished and untranslated, and of the half-dozenthat have been translated, none (!) exists in a version that would suit thegeneral public. (Probably the best English translation of a Śaiva Tantrikscripture available is Lakṣman Jū’s Shiva Sutras: The Supreme Awakening. Myforthcoming translation of The Recognition Sūtras is also worthy of note.) Thestudy of classical Tantra is still a very young field, and one that is in direneed of more scholars. Take heed, young people reading this book! Our need formore dedicated scholars studying Śaiva Tantra is severe.Though scholarly writing is often difficult and dry, if you are of an academicbent, take note of this list of the few really fine scholars of Śaiva Tantra inNorth America: Loriliai Biernacki (University of Colorado); John Nemec(University of Virginia); Shaman Hatley (Concordia University, Canada); GudrunBühnemann (University of Wisconsin at Madison); Whitney Cox (University ofChicago); and David Peter Lawrence (University of North Dakota). Since theUniversity of Virginia boasts not only John Nemec but also David Germano, ascholar of Tibetan Buddhist Tantra and Dzogchen (see below), it is currently thebest place in the United States to study the Tantra academically, along with theUniversity of Chicago.It is my hunch, however, that academic study would not “do it” for most readersof this book, who I presume are interested in the actual practice and experienceof the Tantrik teachings. If you have been captivated by the subject matter ofthis book, it’s natural to ask how you can learn more, and who among thecontemporary teachers of Tantra and Tantrik yoga are “the real deal.”First, as noted in the introduction, we must confront the sad fact that, in somequarters at least, the word “Tantra” has become almost wholly severed from itsoriginal meaning. It is safe to assume that when the word “Tantra” is used inconnection with sex and partner work on the New Age and alternative spiritualityscene, in almost every case that teacher or workshop has no connection to theoriginal tradition. (If you feel like testing them, you can ask them whichtantra [i.e., scripture] they follow.) By making a distinction between somethinglike “original” or “classical” Indian Tantra and what we may call “modernWestern neo-Tantra” I do not intend to suggest that the latter is useless orillegitimate. It may be very helpful for some people in improving their qualityof life. What I would like to challenge is the historical claim some of theseteachers make that what they teach is linked in some way—or in any way—to theIndian tradition and the contents of these mostly unpublished Sanskrit texts.183[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en183] If what they teach isvaluable and effective, no such historical claim is necessary. If it is not, nosuch claim can render their teaching otherwise.As we shall see, there are a few modern spiritual teachers who accuratelypresent some of the teachings and practices of Śaiva Tantra, having receivedthem from a living lineage. It is certainly true that Tantra is still a livingtradition, though it is also true that what has survived into the present day isa highly attenuated form of the original tradition. If we seek Tantra’ssurvivors, we must look not to sex manuals but rather to those contemporaryspiritual lineages that have studied, practiced, and preserved the originalteachings and transmitted those teachings in some form to the West. In noparticular order, below I list some teachers that belong to such lineages. Notewell that this should not be taken to constitute a list of recommended teachers,although I think some benefit could accrue from studying with any of them. If Iam presented with evidence of a teaching lineage of NŚT that I previously wasunaware of, it will be included in the next edition of this book. But do nothold me responsible if you have a bad experience with anyone listed here. I tendtoward skepticism, and for your safety, I recommend you do the same. Eachindividual must decide for herself on the basis of her direct experience,ignoring whatever rhetoric is proffered by the promotional literature of a givenorganization. “The proof is in the pudding” must be our watchword, and we mustbe very honest with ourselves in assessing the real results we have obtainedfrom following a particular practice. What makes this difficult is the fact thatyou must give spiritual practice a chance to work, and depending on your levelof development, it is hard to be sure that a given practice is not working foryou in less than six months. But human psychology being what it is, when youhave invested as much as six months into a particular path, you might convinceyourself that it is working better for you than it actually is because you havebecome attached to it as part of your identity and don’t want to feel that youhave chosen wrongly. So what I recommend is this: do some research and use yourdiscernment to choose a practice that is likely to have some benefit for you,and after six to twelve months take a break from that practice, a break in whichyou engage in radically honest reflection about how far you’ve come. As part ofthis reflection, to compensate for your own self-denigration orself-aggrandizement you must solicit the input of those who are close to you andcan see your changes. Positive changes should be showing up in your day-to-dayreal life. If you are not getting the results you want, look for anotherpractice and/or teacher.When you are doing your research, remember that the Internet is, in general, theworst research tool you can use to investigate a spiritual teacher ororganization. I can’t stress this enough. The nature of the Internet is thatmisinformation is mixed with information in unknown proportions at all times.Even Wikipedia, which has become reliable for certain topics, is so atrocious oneverything related to Indian religions that I forbid its use to my universitystudents. And people love to read about scandals on the Internet, so there areendless stories about the misconduct of gurus. Though some may be true, they areno substitute for firsthand experience. For researching gurus, the only thingthe Internet offers that is of potential benefit is video clips. But even herewe must remember that we can only feel the real “energy field” of a human beingin his or her physical presence. And unlike with teachers of mere knowledge likeuniversity professors, the energy field really matters with a guru.Therefore, you must go to the teacher’s āshram or meditation center or retreatyourself. Get a feel for the teacher (without first prejudicing yourself withInternet stories), and most importantly, talk to as many of their students asyou can. If a good percentage of a teacher’s students are grounded and clear andcan relate what they have attained and what shifts they have undergone withoutglamorizing them, that is your best evidence for a sound path. Don’t assume it’sa cult based on the use of jargon; after all, look at how many Sanskrit wordsare in this book. Your evaluation should be based on to what extent thepractitioners in that community interact with you in a warm, genuine,down-to-earth manner.In the Guru-gītā, there is a verse that says, “One God, one religion, one faithis the highest austerity. There is nothing higher than the Guru.” Should yougather wisdom-teachings and practices from as many gurus as possible to give youthe best chance of attaining the goal? The traditional view is that withouthaving a “root-Guru,” this would be spiritually disabling, since, not having aclear outline of the big picture, you will not know how to correctly fittogether what various teachers give you. People who “guru-shop” do not go deepwith any one system, and thus end up like the proverbial man who dug a dozenholes three feet deep and thus never struck water, as he would have had he dugjust one thirty-foot well. Such dilettantish spiritual materialism will not setyou firmly on the path. Rather, having gotten a full download from onetrustworthy teacher that orients you thoroughly, you may then go to othersteachers for unfolding and enhancement of what you have received (not out of anysense of the inadequacy of your root-Guru). This is very different, for you arenot sampling different paths, but seeking different ways of understanding theone path to which you have given your heart. On this perspective, you are doingthe practice of seeing all authentic gurus as forms of your root-Guru.The exception to the general rule against spiritual promiscuity is if theteachers you are going to are all in the same order or school, using the samemantras and drawing on the same set of scriptures. Even then, eventually youwill have to settle on one of them as your root-Guru if you want to get serious.This, at least, is the traditional view.select list of teachers oforiginal śaiva tantra*NameLocationWebsiteSwāmī ShankarānandaAustraliawww.shivayoga.orgPaul Muller-OrtegaUnited Stateswww.bluethroatyoga.comSwāmī NiranjanānandaIndiawww.yogavision.netSwāmī JanakānandaSwedenwww.yogameditation.comDharmabodhi SarasvatīThailandUnited Stateswww.dharmainc.orgPaṇḍit Rajmani TigunaitUnited Stateswww.himalayanistitute.orgSwāmī ChetanānandaUnited Stateswww.themovementcenter.comChristopher TompkinsUnited Stateswww.shaivayoga.comSwāmī KhecaranāthaUnited Stateswww.rudramandir.comChristopher WallisUnited Stateswww.mattamayura.orgwww.christopherwallis.org*This list does not pretend to be complete. It simply seeks to make the readeraware of some learning resources available through teachers that have studiedŚaiva Tantra and are more or less aligned with the concepts presented in thisbook.My TeachersMy Teachers [image/myteachers.jpg]dzogchen: the tantrik yoga of thenyingmapas and bönposAs long as we are discussing practice gurus, it would be remiss of me to notreturn to the topic of the similarity to nondual Śaiva Tantra of one of the mostremarkable of the Buddhist traditions—that is, Dzogchen. If you have resonatedstrongly with the teachings in this book, especially those of the Krama, but aremore drawn to the aesthetic and culture of Buddhism than that of any of theabove practice teachers, then you will feel very much at home with a goodDzogchen teacher. Note that Dzogchen defies easy categorization as BuddhistTantra, since it declares itself as being “beyond Tantra” and since it holdsviews that are not so clearly Buddhist—because they are so close to Śaiva views,and because Dzogchen is taught just as frequently by adherents of the othermajor Tibetan religion, Bön.Let’s look for a moment at the core Dzogchen teaching, so you can see howsimilar it really is. It is said that the first to propagate Dzogchen teachingsin Tibet was Padma-sambhava himself (c. 8th century), who went there fromUḍḍiyāna. This small kingdom is also, probably not coincidentally, thebirthplace of the Krama tradition. Dzogchen, which means “the Great Perfection,”teaches that everything is Consciousness. The word in Tibetan is rigpa, derivedfrom the Sanskrit vidyā (as in śuddha-vidyā), but closer in meaning to Sanskritcit or citi. Rigpa can be translated as awareness, seeing, knowing, the Knower,pure presence, wakefulness, the nondual ultimate nature of mind. Confusion mayarise from the occasional translation of rigpa as “mind,” however, a littleinvestigation reveals that rigpa is indeed what the Śaiva nondualists callConsciousness (cit) or Awareness (saṃvit).Dzogchen teaches that all phenomena arise within consciousness, and thus thereis nothing other than consciousness, yet it is itself empty of anything that canbe named: it is openness beyond concept.This rigpa, though formless andabsolute, possesses qualities—namely indestructibility, incorruptible purity,nondiscriminating openness, flawless clarity, profound simplicity, all-pervadingpresence, and equality within all beings. It is unconditioned, not originatedfrom causes or conditions, and blissful.184[Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en184] This is all exactly asin NŚT. In fact, I have not yet been able to identify a significant differencebetween the two schools (though this may be due to my relative ignorance ofDzogchen), despite the fact that they supposedly belong to two separatereligions. Thus we see more evidence that Tantra was and is a spiritualphenomenon that is transreligious.Though I have no direct experience of them, you might want to check out thefollowing Dzogchen teachers, who trusted friends of mine praise highly: TsoknyiRinpoche (www.pundarika.org); Tsultrim Allione, a female lama of Western birth,ordained by the Karmapa (www.taramandala.org); Sogyal Rinpoche (www.rigpa.org);Namkhai Norbu, Lopon Trinley Nyima, and Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche (of the Böntradition); and B.

Ablaze with the awakening arising from adorationof that [lineage-transmission], Abhinavagupta performs this work.appendix two:the structure of krama worshipA central text of the Krama explains:…the nature of the Self dawns through the method of worshipping the goddesses ofcognition that shine forth in every state of mundane experience, flowingoutwards and inwards with each successive object of awareness, their contractiondissolved as they merge with the Great Void. (Mahānaya-prakāśa 1.22-23)(Translation Sanderson)This passage simultaneously refers to two important doctrines: First, that theopportunity to realize the nature of the Divine, and oneself as a condensedexpression thereof, exists in every single perception and cognition—for eachcognition reproduces in microcosm the pattern by which divine Consciousnesscreates all reality, and then comes to rest in the one ground of all reality(called “the Great Void” above). Secondly, if one is not able to grasp thisrealization through a contemplation of the flow of cognition itself, one shouldworship the goddesses that embody the phases of cognition through externalritual, until such patterned action is sufficiently ingrained to make possible adeep insight into the nature of reality.Exactly what form, then, did this esoteric Krama worship take? There were twoprimary cycles of worship. The first was articulated as ten stages, divided intotwo sets of five, with an additional preliminary stage at the beginning. Here isan outline of these phases of worship:0. Worship of the SACRED SITE, i.e., Uḍḍiyāna, the origin place of the Kramarevelation; the site and its deities (ḍākinīs and so on) are worshipped in themicrocosm of one’s one body, thus this phase is also consecration of theworshipper’s body.1. Worship of the circle of THE FIVE FLOW GODDESSES:1) She Who Emits the Void (Vyomavāmeśvarī), understood as the inner ground ofpure potential before the arising of object-cognition;2) She Who Moves in the Sky (Khecarī);3) She Who Moves in All Directions (Dikcarī);4) She Who Devours Dissolution (Saṃhārabhakṣiṇī); and5) the Fierce Goddess (Raudreśvarī).The first of these is especially emphasized, for Vyomavāmeśvarī is the ground ofthe following process; thus the worship of the other four here is aforeshadowing of that process.2. Worship of the circle of ILLUMINATION (consisting of 12 goddesses, understoodto be aspects of Khecarī and embodying the five sense-capacities, the fiveaction-capacities, and the mind’s faculties of attention and discernment). Thisis the phase of the sense faculties reaching out to the object of awareness andthus illuminating it; it is associated also, therefore, with the exhale and thesun.3. Worship of the circle of BLISS (16 goddesses, understood to be expressions ofDikcarī, embodying the 10 capacities, the mind’s faculty of attention, and the 5subtle elements). This is the phase in which the sense faculties incorporate theobject of awareness; associated also, therefore, with the inhale and the moon.4. Worship of the circle of EMBODIMENT (17 goddesses, understood to beexpressions of Saṃhārabhakṣiṇī, embodying the 10 capacities, the subtleelements, and the mind’s faculties of discernment and identity-construction).This is the phase of subjective awareness of self as perceiver.5. Worship of the circle of the MULTITUDE, also called the CELESTIAL ORDER (the64 Yoginīs with their leader, the supreme Goddess Mangalā). In this stage theYoginīs dissolve the subtle traces of the preceding process, and self-awarenessreverts fully to its enlightened core. This phase subdivides into six asfollows, with worship of 1. the 16 Yoginīs who dissolve the subtle traces (saṃskāras)remaining from phase 4, 2. the 24 Yoginīs who dissolve the saṃskāras of phase 3, 3. the 12 Yoginīs who penetrate the field of consciousness with pure nondiscursive awareness, 4. the 8 Yoginīs who purify the traces of the eightfold subtle body, 5. the 4 Yoginīs who purify the impression of the sensation of contact of the three aspects of mind with the object of cognition, and 6. Mangalā as the nonrelational ground of the 64 Yoginīs Pristine consciousness follows.The foregoing is the iteration of the process on the introversive level. Thenthe worshipper explores a similar pattern extroversively; or, to put it anotherway, the five Flow Goddesses express a similarly patterned pulsation of energyon the extroversive level. This phase involves worship of6. the GURU-LINEAGE as embodiments of the realization of the foregoingprocess185 [Tantra_Illuminated_2nd_Edition_ebook_cc-32.xhtml#en185]7. the circle of CREATION (of a cognition)8. the circle of STASIS9. the circle of WITHDRAWAL10. the circle of the NAMELESS—in this final phase, perfect interpenetration andbalance of the inner and outer states is fully realizedThe circle of the Nameless constitutes the final iteration of the process ofcognition plus its ineffable ground. This is worshipped as twelve forms of thegoddess Kālī, plus a thirteenth, who embodies the unity of the other twelve. Thetwelve Kālīs are discussed at the end of part 1 of the book.The complexity of the foregoing compressed outline might seem intimidating.Remember that none of this was necessary for those who could have a direct,non-discursive, intuitive insight into the nature of reality triggered by atransmission of power from the guru or sparked by one of the revealed teachingsthat, though seemingly partial, mystically point to the whole pattern. Forothers, though, this process of worship was considered necessary to imprint thebrain with the pattern of the deep structures of both consciousness and manifestreality (for they are of course the same in this nondualist system).

If any scholar or student of the tradition wishes to contactme for precise textual references, I will attempt to answer all such requests.More adequately referenced writing is available on my website,christopherwallis.org. Of course, any beginning student of Śaiva Tantra mustbecome acquainted with Sanderson’s work, beginning with the easier introductorypieces: “Shaivism and the Tantric Traditions,” “Power and Purity among theBrahmins of Kashmir,” and “EPHE Lectures: Long Summary,” all available onalexissanderson.com.1. See especially his Nothing Exists That is Not Śiva and Secret of the Siddhas.2. I will substantiate this claim with reference to the three books that mightappear to challenge it. Georg Feuerstein’s Tantra: The Path of Ecstasy presentsus with an overview not of the unique philosophical system of classical Tantra,but rather of those elements of Tantra that were incorporated into Hinduism.Thus his book may be seen as a good introduction to the post-classical HinduTantra of the 13th century onward. As you will discover, the classical Tantrikphilosophy presented here is related, but considerably different. The secondbook I am thinking of is Kamalakar Mishra’s Kashmir Shaivism: The CentralPhilosophy of Tantrism. This covers much classical Tantrik philosophy but doesnot cover the history and social context of the religion which gave rise to it.So Mishra perpetuates the now almost century-old misunderstanding that thistradition was a phenomenon of the region of Kashmīr, whereas as we shall see, itwas a pan-Indian (and eventually pan-Asian) spiritual movement. Thirdly, we haveSwāmī Shankarānanda’s book Consciousness is Everything: The Yoga of KashmirShaivism. This is a fine book for contemplative practitioners, however, as theauthor himself admits, not being able to read Sanskrit has limited him to thehandful of Tantrik texts translated into English, none of which are translatedall that well.3. Philip Goldberg’s American Veda (2010) identifies the following as theforemost doctrine of the Vedānta philosophy acquired by the U.S.: “Ultimatereality is both transcendent and immanent, both one and many…” This is a keyteaching of the Tantra, but not at all a doctrine of Vedānta, except the highlysyncretic version of Vedānta taught in the last two centuries—a version verymuch influenced by Tantra. Another teaching Goldberg gives in the same list thatis not at all Vedāntic but very Tantrik: “Individuals can awaken to their divinenature through any number of pathways and practices; no single one is right foreveryone.” This misunderstanding whereby Tantrik teachings are credited to otherschools is widespread.4. In other words, Buddhist Tantra is essentially Mahāyāna Buddhism remodeledalong Tantrik Śaiva lines. This is bound to be a controversial claim in somequarters: many Buddhist scholars and practicing Buddhists will immediately denyit, since new scholarly findings that go against what has been generallyaccepted are always denied at first, however sound the evidence. But thatevidence has been amassed in incredible quantity and detail by Professor AlexisSanderson, primarily in his 300-page masterpiece, “The Śaiva Age,” published inGenesis and Development of Early Tantrism and available from his website. For animportant and much briefer presentation of evidence, download Sanderson’s GondaLecture, as well as the handout “How Buddhist is the Herukābhidhāna-tantra?” Forthose readers who ask why the historical priority (and predominance) of ŚaivaTantra over all other forms of Tantra was not previously common knowledge, theanswer is that in previous generations of scholars there were many scholars ofBuddhism and virtually none of Śaivism.5. In other words, though this is a simplification, where Buddhist Tantraarticulates a philosophy distinct from the Mahāyāna, that philosophy correspondsclosely to nondual Śaivism, especially that of the mature Krama school (whichis, as we shall see, far distant from the Veda-congruent Śaiva orthodoxy). Thisnear identity of the Śaiva philosophy of the far left (this term is explainedlater) with the Dzogchen and Mahāmudrā lineages of Buddhism will become moreclear when scholars have correctly transposed the relevent technical terms fromTibetan to Sanskrit and vice versa. (A start in this direction has been made byscholar David Germano.) As I point out, unlike in the case of the Tantrikpractices, scholars are not yet proposing a direction of transmission for thisphilosophy, which for the present we may regard as coming out of the sharedmilieu of nondualist thought in the Himālayan region.6. This can also be seen in the fact that Dzogchen is not only a Buddhistphenomenon but equally belongs to the Bön religion of Tibet.7. Cabezón, José. “The Discipline and Its Other: the Dialectic of Alterity inthe Study of Religion,” Journal of the American Academy of Religion, 74:1, 2006.8. As we will see, the widespread notion in both the modern West and India thatmodern yoga came from (or is even connected to) the pre-Tantrik tradition ofPatañjali’s Yoga-sūtra is false. That text give nearly no specifics of practice(except for concentrative meditation), as opposed to the vast literature onyogic practices in the Tantrik tradition. Apart from the 20th-century revival ofPatañjali, it is safe to say that whatever of his thought we find in thehaṭha-yoga tradition was transmitted there through the Tantrik tradition. Morewill be said on this.9. Unfortunately, this cannot be taken to imply that all effective practicessurvive. Due to historical discontinuities (such as the Muslim conquest) manypowerful teachings are lost. This contraction of tradition is particularlytragic in the Indian case, because due to cultural attitudes around thetransmission of knowledge, it will not generally be admitted that something hasbeen lost. This explains why virtually no effort is being made by modern Indiato recover one of the most extensive, beautiful, and effective spiritualtraditions of its long history, that of Śaiva Tantra.10. Though it is true that black holes cannot be seen in the visible spectrum,their existence can be proved by the orbits of nearby stars in a binary systemor by their radiation of x-rays.11. To give one brief example, however, we may cite the fact that AlexisSanderson, based on the model of Shaivism he had evolved, predicted that goddessworship must have been a part of the pre-Tantrik Śaiva tradition, though therewas no known evidence of it. Such evidence did indeed come to light, in the formof newly discovered inscriptions and manuscripts.12. Tanoti vipulān arthān tattva-mantra-samanvitān | trāṇaṃ ca kurute yasmāttantram ity abhidhīyate ||13. That is, my teacher Somadeva Vasudeva (Columbia University), who broughtthis passage to my attention.14. Sārdhatriśati-kālottara-vṛtti, p. 5. This is necessarily a paraphrase, asthe formal and culturally-specific style of the Sanskrit bars a literaltranslation here. Note that this definition can be equally well applied toBuddhist Tantra, if we replace the word “God” with “the Bodhisattva(s).” Theoriginal Sanskrit reads: tantraṃ ca—parāpara-puruṣārthādhikāriṇāṃviśiṣṭa-saṃskāra-pratipādana-pūrva[ka]m īśvarārādhanāya niyata-vidhi-niṣedhaṃtadājñātmakaṃ vākya-jātam.15. With the exception of the Vijñāna-Bhairava Tantra, which is the onlyoriginal Tantrik scripture from the Śaiva tradition in general circulation inEnglish, and even then not in quite correct translations. Though theVijñāna-Bhairava is a remarkable text, it should be noted that its contents areatypical of Tantrik scriptures. There are other scriptures available in partialEnglish translation, though they are extremely scholarly and quite difficult toget hold of. Examples are the Mālinī-vijayottara Tantra (trans. S. Vasudeva) theKiraṇa Tantra and the Parākhya Tantra (trans. D. Goodall), all published by theEcole Française d’Extreme Orient / Institut Français de Pondichéry in India.16. This naturally suggests to us the possibility that there could be a Tantrikversion of other religions, for example a Tantrik inflection of Christianity, inwhich the mantras and visualizations would pertain to Christian forms of Deity.A start has been made in this direction by former Jesuit John Dupuche, whorecently published Towards a Christian Tantra. This is possible because Tantrikpractice can be conceived of as a “way of doing religion”: a structure that cancontain any content. As we shall see, the content is the energy of Deity inwhichever flavor is evoked by the sect in question.17. Of this list, the first four are the indigenous Indian religions. They areeach named after either their founder or their central deity (i.e., the primaryname they use for God). Thus the names of the religions are derived from Śiva,the Buddha, Viṣṇu, and the Jina (a.k.a. Mahāvīra). The second and fourth haveboth atheistic and polytheistic forms. The first and third have bothpolytheistic and monotheistic forms. These two, Shaivism and Vaishnavism, aretoday part of what is called “Hinduism.” This misnomer will be explained below.There was also another thoroughly Tantrik religion, that of Shāktism (namedafter the Goddess or Śakti), which I am here treating as part of Shaivism, eventhough it later developed forms that are separate. For evidence that Tantrainfiltrated even Islām in India, see Shaman Hatley’s article “Mapping theEsoteric Body in the Islamic Yoga of Bengal.”18. This fact remains not commonly known even amongst scholars, though asmentioned in an earlier endnote, more than enough evidence to substantiate ithas been presented by Prof. Alexis Sanderson in a number of articles.19. Williams, Paul and Anthony Tribe, Buddhist Thought, pp. 197–202.20. This discussion is necessarily a simplification. In fact, not only Europeansbut also early Muslim and Chinese sources used the term Hindu. The term waswidespread because it was originally a geographical one, referring to all thepeople living in the area of the river Sindhu and east of there. While the term‘Hindoo’ is first documented in the early 1600s, ‘Hindooism’ only followed inthe late 1700s, though the derogatory reductionism of all indigenous Indiantraditions to a single category (e.g., “idolatry”) began with the usage of theearlier term.

The Indian tradition did not prefer the suffix –ism (or the Sanskritequivalent -tva) for its religious traditions. Their indigenous names are:Vaidika-dharma, Śaiva-dharma, Śākta-, Vaiṣṇava-, Bauddha-, and Jaina-dharma,where the word “dharma” (= religion, code of conduct, and way of life) couldalso be replaced in the compound by the word “śāsana” (= teaching), as inBauddha-śāsana, the teachings of the Buddhist way. Note also that there werethree nonindigenous religions in India from an early period, represented insmall numbers: Christians, Jews, and Parsīs or Zoroastrians.22. It is not a coincidence that the first documented Indian to use the termHinduism was Western-educated and Westernized, and furthermore (with the best ofintentions) he created a new “sanitized” version of Indian religion that won theapproval of his European rulers. His name was Rammohun Roy (1772–1833), and hisnew sect was the Brahmo Samāj.23. I speak here of classical Shaivism, i.e., before 1300. After that time,Shaivism increasingly adapted itself to Brāhmanism, giving rise to Vedic-Tantriksyncretism.24. This process, which also has included a massive reduction of the complexityof Indian religious culture, especially in its intellectual dimension, islargely the result of the loss of state patronage for indigenous Indianreligions. That is to say, the complex and detailed teachings and practices ofthe Indian religions were sustained by monasteries, educational institutions,and thousands of dedicated full-time teachers that were only possible with largeamounts of funding. When the Muslims conquered north India (beginning around the13th century and complete by the 16th), this funding evaporated, causing thetotal disappearance of Buddhism from India as well as the simplification andmerger of the remaining traditions. It was really the arrival of the Muslim“others” that created the specifically Hindu identity—the earliest uses of theterm “Hindu” as a self-designation (among the Vaiṣṇavas of eastern India, 16thcen.) are specifically in contrast to “Muslim”. This modern Hindu identitycenters on the devotionalism, temple culture, and the simplified reproductionstemple rites in Hindu homes.25. Though I would be remiss if I failed to note that historically, if onewished to receive Tantrik initiation after having made vows of commitment in anyother religious tradition, one first had to undergo a ritual to remove thatearlier religious identity. This ceremony (called the liṅgoddhāra) was notdeemed necessary in the case of the one who grew up in a particular religiouscontext but never committed to its practice (like someone from a Catholic familywho never received confirmation).26. We find the first point made in one of the earliest Śaiva scriptures, theNiśvāsa-kārikā (12.161–67) and the second made by early commentators Vāladhārinand Jayaratha. See Sanderson, “The Śaiva Age,” note 691.27. Note that many Śaiva Tantrik lineages, especially of the dualistic schools,would not have been willing to initiate non-Indians (i.e., people withoutcaste). However, the lineages we are most concerned with here were willing toinitiate anyone with a sincere and sustained interest.28. For this see the recent work of Mark Singleton, the first scholar tosuccessfully identify the forces at work in the formation of modern yoga,revealing it to be definitively a product of globalization. The indigenousIndian element in its formation was haṭha-yoga; the primary synthesizers of themodern discipline were three men working in the 1920s and ’30s, Kuvalayānandaand Śrī Yogendra of the greater Bombay area, and Kṛṣṇamāchārya of Mysore.29. Some philosophers argue that no experience is immediate (= unmediated), thatall religious experiences are mediated to us (= shaped and determined) bylanguage and culture. To put it simply, Śaiva Tantra’s viewpoint is that whilelanguage shapes our experience of reality, it cannot create an artificialexperience. The fact that tools such as language are used to bring about anexperience does not thereby invalidate it. The important question is whichaspect of reality do you wish to experience? How do you want to experience it?You can use divine language to bring about an authentic divine experience. Thisviewpoint is further rooted in the Tantrik notion that the structures oflanguage express (on a superficial level) the structures of reality itself.Therefore, you are not so much using religious language to construct anexperience of reality but rather to access an aspect of reality previouslyunavailable to you. Finally, Shaivism argues, you are firmly anchored in theknowledge that your experience expresses a transpersonal reality (rather than,say, solipsistic delusion) by the fact that it corresponds to divinely revealedscripture.30. This definition is partially inspired by the definition of Tantra as ageneral category offered by David White in his introduction to the book Tantrain Practice: “Tantra is that body of beliefs and practices which, working fromthe principle that the material universe is nothing other than the concretemanifestation of the divine energy of the godhead that creates and maintainsthat universe, seeks to appropriate and channel that energy, within the humanmicrocosm, in creative and emancipatory ways.” This definition in fact onlyholds for nondual Śaiva Tantra, not Tantra in general, but in that contextserves well, though it is perhaps too broad. It emphasizes Tantra as a ritualtechnology that allows us to access śakti (divine power) and use it to attainthe twin goals of Tantra mentioned earlier in the main text.31. I am paraphrasing a remarkable passage from Spencer Brown’s Laws of Form,already noticed by Ken Wilber in the latter’s early work.32. ātmā prakāśa-vapur eṣa śivaḥ svatantraḥ | svātantrya-narma-rabhasena nijaṃsvarūpam | saṃchādya yat punar api prathayeta pūrṇaṃ.33. ajñānaṃ kila bandha-hetur uditaḥ śāstre malaṃ tat smṛtaṃ |pūrṇa-jñāna-kalodaye tad akhilaṃ nirmūlatāṃ gacchati |dhvastāśeṣa-malātma-saṃvid-udaye mokṣaś ca tenāmunā.34. Consciousness does not really count as a “layer,” for reasons we will cometo, which explains why some sources call this the four-layered self. Note thatthis schema is similar yet different to the the “sheaths” [kośa] of Vedāntaphilosophy.35. mukhyatvaṃ kartṛtāyās tu bodhasya ca cid-ātmanaḥ / śūnyādau tad-guṇe jñānaṃtat-samāveśa-lakṣaṇam || Īśvara-pratyabhijñā-kārikā 3.2336. To be more precise, all the layers except the Void are ever-changing, butthe changeless Void cannot be your ultimate identity because it is whollytranscendent.37. We may draw a parallel to a concept in quantum physics, in which an electronis said to not so much have a specific location as a “probability waveform”: ifmeasured, the electron could turn out to be in any one of a number of locations,and it doesn’t bother to have a location until it is measured. Though theprobability is low, it is theoretically possible for an electron attached to anatom in your body one moment to be hundreds of miles away in the next. In thesame way, though anything could arise out of the infinite field of pureConsciousness within, it is most likely that thought-forms will arise that arerepetitions or slight variations on previous thought-forms (which is calledconditioning).38. We see in Dr. Oliver Sacks’ famous essay “The Man Who Mistook His Wife for aHat” (in the book of the same name) the bizarre result of a failure of thisprocess by which the mind synthesizes an object out of various ābhāsas (Dr.Sacks, of course, does not use that language—the reader will have to decide forherself whether I am correct in identifying the neurological deficit hedescribes in this way).39. I give the example “justice,” but of course there is no such thing as anobject of awareness that is purely abstract such as the concept of “justice” ingeneral. All concepts used by real individuals are highly specific, such as,say, the specific concept of justice in the mind of Felix Frankfurter when hewrote his analysis of the Sacco-Vanzetti case, which was unique to him and thatmoment in history. That specific concept of justice may be analyzed in terms ofthe various ābhāsas that comprise it; but an abstract concept like “justice ingeneral” may not, for it does not really exist except as a linguistic construct.40. Though this teaching is explicitly given in the original sources, myunderstanding of it is influenced by the writing of a great meditator SwāmīAnantānanda in his book What’s on My Mind?, published by the SYDA Foundation.41. The astute reader will have noticed that I say “commonly used” as if thereare other, more esoteric or accurate bīja mantras for the five great elements.There are; the commonly known bījas are, it turns out, simplifications orpossibly even erroneous misreadings of the original Tantrik mantras. This hasbeen confirmed by the pioneering work of Christopher Tompkins in this field, andI will leave it to his forthcoming publication to reveal what the Tantrikmantras for the five great elements are.42. More accurately, the formula is: Śiva – all powers + kañcukas = jīva.43. Sanderson’s translation.44. In some accounts of the kañcukas, the order of #10 and 11 is reversed(niyati then kāla). In other (very early) accounts, they are not found at all,the first three kañcukas being the important ones. The fact that our scripturalsources are not all in agreement supports the notion that they are evolved outof the contemplated spiritual experience of real men and women, whosearticulation of their insights—descending to the approximate level of the spokenword—will never be in perfect accord.45. I here follow the Pratyabhijñā-hṛdayam, which differs from the earlierĪśvara-pratyabhijñā-kārikā in placing the level of equal apposition onĪśvara-tattva rather than Śuddhavidyā-tattva. In the -hṛdayam’s schema, there isa neater progression from the embryonic germ of universe held within Sadāśiva,to equal apposition with Īśvara, to full expression (as a pattern of energy, notyet physical matter) on the level of Śuddhavidyā.46. Literally, “He exists in every sphere, and in all objects of the senses:wherever one may look, that which is not God is found nowhere.” viṣayeṣu casarveṣu indriyārtheṣu ca sthitaḥ | yatra yatra nirūpyeta nāśivaṃ vidyate kvacit|| Svacchanda-tantra 4.314 || We could also translate śiva in its common meaningas “auspicious” or “blessed,” yielding the meaning “nothing that is not ablessing can be found.”47. As far as the Trika tradition is concerned, one of the most importantexamples of this is the reification of the simple phrase “I see a pot.” That isto say, since the linguistic construction contains three separate elements (afirst-person agent, a verb denoting perceptive process initiated by that agent,and a direct object of that verb) we believe that there are three separatethings: a person who sees, the act of seeing, and an object seen. However,careful reflection reveals that there is one unified process with three aspects.The perception “pot” is simply a particular vibration within consciousness,inseparable from the observer, who is inseparable from the process by whichobjects of consciousness are created (in this case, seeing). If there reallywere three separate and distinct things, they could never be meaningfullyrelated in such a way as to give rise to any valid form of knowledge.48. The language of this paragraph (and certain other points throughout thissection) draws on the excellent article by Italian scholar Rafaelle Torellacalled “The Word in Abhinavagupta’s Bṛhad-vimarśinī.”49. The Aphorisms of Śiva, p. 33.50. When we occasionally enter the waking state while still occupying the subtlebody, we find that we are paralyzed for a few moments before we can transitawareness to the physical body. This is known in the West as “sleep paralysis.”51. If we are making comparisons, note that though Abhinava the theologian canbe compared to Thomas Aquinas, Abhinava the philosopher must be compared toHegel and Kant, not only in significance and influence but even in some of thecontent of his thinking.52. From “Maṇḍala and Āgamic Identity,” p. 170.53. The Order of Āmardaka = the Śaiva Siddhānta, described in the next sectionof the book; the Order of Śrī is an ancient lineage that is the forerunner ofthe Krama, also detailed later; the Order of Tryambaka = the Trika; and theOrder of the Half-Tryambaka (or the Three-and-a-half), founded by Tryambaka’sdaughter, is the Kaula Trika, that is, the Trika incorporating the nonsectarianspiritual tradition of Kaulism, revealed in the present age by Lord Macchanda.54. Thanks to Sanderson’s article on “The Doctrine of theMālinīvijayottaratantra” for this phrasing (p. 295)55. The translation is a modified version of Sanderson’s, from his “Commentaryon the Opening Verses of the Tantrasāra.”56. Abhinavagupta’s commentator Jayaratha adds, “He means that in the Kula orKaula system, there is a prohibition of wearing matted locks, ashes, and therest, as taught [in the scripture that says]: ‘He should not associate in act,thought or speech with anyone who wears such insignia as matted locks and ashes,the banner, the [human bone] ornaments of the Kāpālika observance, the tridentand the terrible skull-staff. For in this [nondual system] is taught a method ofrealizing one’s identity with Śiva easily, without effort, even while one isimmersed in [the experience of] the objects of the senses, as taught in [theSvabodhodaya-mañjarī of Hrasvanātha]: “The ancients taught cessation [ofcontracted awareness] by means of yogic practice and detachment. But I teach nowthat this cessation may come about effortlessly.”’” (Trans. Sanderson, slightlymodified) Here we see the tension that the doctrine of Supreme Nonduality seeksto resolve.57. I first read this passage with Somdev Vasudeva, and my translation (like allthose in this section) is indebted to him and Prof. Sanderson.58. Learn more about the physical properties of waves and the beautiful patternsthat they create when they combine (“interfere” in physics language) by going tohttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_(wave_propagation). “Constructiveinterference” is the Parā aspect of the supreme Goddess; “destructiveinterference” is the Kālī aspect. Note that the dark places in the interferencepatterns are not a lack of energy (śakti) but rather the product of energy wavescombining to create space.59. My understanding of this teaching is deeply indebted to Sanderson’s “Meaningin Tantric Ritual” and Paul Muller-Ortega’s unpublished work on the 12 Kālīs.60. To get a complete picture of this dissemination, one would have to readseveral hundred pages of very dense academic prose including many citations inSanskrit. However, I encourage the dedicated reader to obtain copies of “TheŚaiva Age” and “History through Textual Criticism” (both showing how BuddhistTantra derives from Śaiva sources), as well as “The Lākulas” (on the connectionsbetween pre-Tantrik and Tantrik Śaivism), and “Śaivism among the Khmers” (on itspropagation in Southeast Asia, especially the Śaiva kingdom of Angkor Wat), allavailable from alexissanderson.com. You can also find there some more readableintroductory articles, such as “Śaivism and the Tantrik Traditions” and “Powerand Purity among the Brahmans of Kashmīr”.61. Though if they came from the background of another religion, they would haveto go through a ritual that stripped them of their (attachment to their)previous religious identity. Note that those whose background was Brāhmanism didnot have to undergo this ritual, which shows that Śaivas did not considerBrāhmanism a religion as much as a culture (similar to some forms of Hinduismtoday).62. This description is drawn from Sanderson, Religion and the State: Initiatingthe Monarch in Śaivism and the Buddhist Way of Mantras, p. 9.63. The first complete Buddhist tantra is the Mahāvairocanābhisaṃbodhi-tantra,dating from the 7th century. The dates of the Buddhist texts can be ascertainedquite precisely by their Chinese translations; the dates of the Śaiva textscannot. However, the early 6th century date for first Śaiva Tantrik text, theNiśvāsa (see below), was arrived at by the most careful scholars and skilledSanskritists in the field.64. Mañjuśriyamūla-kalpa 47:53–54, translation by Sanderson, p. 130 of “TheŚaiva Age.”65. That is, this appearance and these accoutrements are reserved in the lawbooks for anyone convicted of murdering a brāhmin priest. These murderers wereforced to wander in this way, announcing their abhorrent presence with theringing of a bell. Yet these Atimārga ascetics called Kāpālikas, innocent of anycrime, voluntarily adopted this mode of conduct in their seeking oftranscendence. This is especially impressive when you remember that as theythemselves were brāhmins, they were voluntarily casting themselves down from themost respected position in society to the least. It strikes me as anunparalleled act of courage.66. I was fortunate to read this passage with a master scholar specializing inthis very early Tantrik literature, Dominic Goodall of the French Institute inPondicherry, Tamiḷ Nāḍu.67. If we continue with the Christian parallel, the NŚT groups are similar towhat we might imagine the 2nd and 3rd century Gnostic Christians might have beenlike if they had survived to become more successful. I am thinking of thelatter’s nondualist teachings, their anti-institutional emphasis of personalmystical experience, their empowerment of women, etc.68. The complexities of the sectarian relations of the various groups of theleft current are beyond the scope of this book. It is not entirely accurate forall periods to use the term Kaula so broadly, but it does allow us to name anddistinguish the dominant streams of the tradition, and it is true that “Kaula”can be used as a synonym for Śākta (Goddess-worshipper). By the end of theclassical period, the word Kaula had a very broad semantic reach. I tend to sayKaula when focusing on the practice and culture of the left current, and NŚT(nondual Śaiva Tantra) when focusing more on the philosophy, because ittranscends sectarian affliation (though its primary authors were allKaula-influenced if not Kaula initiates).69. See, e.g., Sanderson’s “Purity and Power among the Brahmans of Kashmir,” pp.201–202.70. Several sentences in this paragraph are paraphrased from Sanderson 1988:680.71. See www.tantricart.net. This website features the work of the last livinglineage of authentic Tantrik artists (as far as I am aware), members of theNewārī clan of the Kāthmandu valley. They are to be congratulated, in my view,for incorporating Western artistic advances (such as perspective andthree-dimensionality) without in the least compromising the traditional natureof their subject. One of the extremely talented artists on the website, DineshShreṣṭha, is a teacher of this book’s artist, Ekabhūmi Ellik, for whom seeendnote 74 below.72. By “charismatic” gurus, I mean those who possess an impressive degree ofpersonal power and attainment, mere contact with whom can trigger an awakeningor bring on the next stage in one’s spiritual development. Charismatic gurus area fascinating and problematic feature of Indian religions (and religion ingeneral), for on the one association with them speeds up one’s processconsiderably, but on the other hand, their personal power can translate to acult of personality which poses many dangers to the seeker. For more on the roleof the guru, see Part 3 of the book.73. The doctrine of nonduality in a coherent and fully explicit form is foundonly in the furthest left groups. Though it would seem to us that professingduality or nonduality must be an either/or proposition, there are some (usuallyearly) texts on the spectrum that mix dualist and nondualist elements in a waythat is logically incoherent but not necessarily ritually incoherent (e.g., theSvacchanda-tantra of the Dakṣiṇa school, the Mālinīvijayottara-tantra, etc.).74. Charles Ekabhūmi Ellik is an artist of singular talent, who has studied bothWestern and Indian (especially Himālayan) artistic conventions extensively. Heis, in my experience, able to discern something of the energy of each deity anddepict them accordingly. It is a matter of good fortune for lovers of Tantrikart that he is available for hire. Love for the tradition is his primary motive,infusing all his work. You can find out more about him at www.ekabhumi.com.75. Relativism is the idea that everyone’s point of view is equally valid, andno one viewpoint can negate any other. It sounds very nice and tolerant: theonly problem is it is totally incoherent. The only way every point of view canbe equally valid is if none of them have any truth-value, so popular relativismis just nihilism in disguise. This is why I say we must have a hierarchy oftruth if we wish to avoid relativism; but it can be an inclusivist hierarchy,one that allows lower (provisional) truths their own sphere of validity. Sincethey are true as far as they go, there is no need to intolerantly force theiradherents to give them up, since if those seekers proceed in their inquiry, theywill necessarily eventually come to see that there are “higher,” i.e., moreall-encompassing, truths.76. Mataṅga-pārameśvara-tantra, Yoga section, 1.12; following Sanderson’sunpublished translation.77. This discovery was made by Christopher Tompkins, a colleague of mine andscholar of early Śaiva Tantrik Yoga. Note the major difference between thisteaching and that of the later Haṭha-yoga tradition: here kuṇḍalinī does not liedormant at the base of the spine. Rather, she must be summoned from her naturalhome at the crown of the head in order to rescue the individual soul (jīva).Hence she is brought to the heart, or whatever center individuated awareness isoccupying; there she begins to feel a longing (as it were) to be reunited withŚiva at the crown. The soul is able (with practice) to cling to her coattails(as it were) when she surges back up the central channel to her Beloved. This,at least, is my understanding of the explanation given to me by Tompkins basedon the Kālottara and related sources.78. Translation by Christopher Tompkins, modified slightly by myself.79. Due partially to its antiquity, the text is extremely corrupted, which meansfilled with scribal errors, indicating to us that it was transmitted for aunknown number of generations beyond the point that its practice was followed(for, if the scribes copying it understood what they were reading, they wouldnot have made so many errors). Much meaning can still be extracted by the astutelinguist, however, and this work has been done by two scholars of myacquaintance. One of them, Shaman Hatley (of Concordia University), has writtena remarkable dissertation on the Brahma-yāmala. The translation here followsthat of Shaman Hatley in his Ph.D. dissertation.80. The translation here follows that of Shaman Hatley in his Ph.D.dissertation.81. That of William Arraj from the University of Chicago, 1988.82. Translation Sanderson, “The Śaiva Age,” pp. 293–94.83. This explanation of Abhinava’s schema is simplified from Sanderson’s“Maṇḍala and Āgamic Identity.”84. Translation based on that of Sanderson, “Meaning in Tantric Ritual,” p. 65.85. In some accounts; in others she is depicted as exactly the same as theterrifying Aparā, though with a reddish body rather than a red-black body as thesole difference. See Sanderson’s “Visualisation of the Deities of the Trika.”86. Here I use phrases from Sanderson’s masterful article “Maṇḍala and ĀgamicIdentity,” (pp. 192–193) which I have been contemplating for many years andstill have not learned everything it has to offer.87. Abhinava Gupta, Essence of the Tantras chapter four: “The whole of realityis encompassed by three basic Powers. She by whom the Highest Divinity supports,perceives, and manifests all this—from Śiva down to Earth—as pureundifferentiated Consciousness, is his sacred Transcendent Power, the SupremeGoddess [Śrī Parā-śakti]. She by whom [he supports, perceives, and manifestsall] as diversity within unity is his sacred Intermediate Power [ŚrīParāparā-śakti]. She by whom [he supports, perceives, and manifests all] asentirely differentiated, characterized by [apparent] mutual separation, is hissacred Lower Power [Śrī Aparā-śakti]. She by whom he devours this three-foldprocess, embracing it to himself alone as unitary awareness, is simply hisBlessed Goddess Śrī Parā [in her higher all-encompassing form], denoted by othernames [in the scriptures], such as Mātṛsadbhāva ‘Mother Existence/The Essence ofKnowers], Kālakarṣiṇī [The Projector and Withdrawer of Time] or Vāmeśvarī [TheGoddess who Emits Reality].”88. Thanks to Judit Törzsök for providing this reference, which is toSiddha-yogeśvarī-mata 28.41–42.89. Note that the book published by Lorin Roche under the name The RadianceSutras cannot claim in any sense to be a translation of the Vijñāna-bhairava, oreven a rendering, since Roche does not read Sanskrit at all. It is, rather,poetry inspired by a rendering of a translation, and thus is at several removesfrom the original. This of course has nothing to do with the quality of thepoetry.90. This long section on the Krama is even more indebted to Sanderson’s workthan other sections of the book, because no one really understood anything aboutthe Krama before his work (despite the publication of a poor and confusing studyby N. Rastogi called The Krama Tantricism of Kashmir). Thus this section drawsheavily on materials in Sanderson’s magnum opus, “The Śaiva Exegesis ofKashmir.”91. Parapharased from Sanderson 1988:675.92. Translated by Sanderson from the Old Kashmīrī Mahānaya-prakāśa (“ŚaivaExegesis,” p. 265).93. Sanderson’s translation from “Śaiva Exegesis,” p. 322, except that I havereplaced “enlightenment” with the more literal “awakening” (bodha).94. It has been translated by Rafaelle Torella and by Christopher Tompkins,though the former’s is difficult to find and the latter’s is unpublished.95. “Śaiva Exegesis,” p. 277, emphasis mine. The reader may notice a similarityto Buddhist language here, and indeed the Krama is the most “Buddhistic” of theŚaiva schools, though it is more accurate to say that they both emerged out ofthe same Himālayan cultural milieu, which fostered an interest in nondualistmeditation in this period.96. Following Sanderson’s emendation of surata from the manuscript’s svarata. Ifthe latter reading is correct, it would imply self-pleasuring instead oflovemaking.97. Note that the King did not give him the punishment for sexual misconduct,which would have been the brand of a vulva. We can therefore suppose that he didnot disapprove of that aspect of the “circle gathering.” See “Śaiva Exegesis,”p. 281.98. Closely following Sanderson, “Śaiva Exegesis,” p. 291.99.

Its original source islost. See “Śaiva Exegesis” pp. 294-5.102. Translation Sanderson, “Śaiva Exegesis,” pp. 293–4.103. In fact the later Krama went by many names: those meaning “the Kramateaching, viewpoint, or way,” i.e., krama-śāsana, kramārtha, krama-darśana, andkrama-naya; those meaning “the Great teaching, way, or tradition,” mahārtha,mahānaya, mahāmnāya, and mahā-śāsana; those meaning “the way of the Goddess orthe way of Kālī,” kālī-naya, kālikā-krama, devatā-naya, and devī-naya; onemeaning “the tradition of the Ecstatic Gathering,” melāpa-darśana; and finallyone meaning “the secret (or esoteric) tradition”: rahasyāmnāya.104.

Abhinavagupta and Kṣemarāja both criticize Brāhminical culture for itsśaṅkā or paralyzing inhibition that results from belief in hierarchical puritylaws.

This whole passage comes from the original unpublished Sanskrit manuscriptof the Chummā-saṅketa-prakāśa kindly furnished to me by Prof. Sanderson; and myexplanation, as with everything in the Krama chapter, draws on his detailedanalysis in “The Śaiva Exegesis of Kashmir”.113. Indeed, the Newars of the Kāthmāndu valley sometimes worshipSvacchandabhairava as a consort of Kubjikā. See Mark Dyczkowski’s A Journey inthe World of the Tantras, chapter 6, “The Cult of the Goddess Kubjikā.”114. In the world of modern (Western) postural yoga, the term kuṇḍalinī-yoga hasunfortunately become associated in the minds of many with a system of practicepropounded by the Sikh entrepeneur Harbhajan Singh Puri, known as “Yogi Bhajan.”The original forms of kuṇḍalinī-yoga were not concerned with physical posturesor movements at all but rather with visualizations and energy practices of thesubtle body utilizing secret Tantrik mantras and prāṇāyāmas quite unlike thecollection of practices presented by Yogi Bhajan, who, evidently lacking accessto the original sources, appears to have fabricated a number of unprecedentedtechniques intended to arouse the kuṇḍalinī. That does not in itself imply thathis techniques have no intrinsic merit.115. For the myth of Kubjikā, see Mark Dyczkowski’s “Kubjikā, the AndrogynousGoddess” in A Journey in the World of the Tantras.116. Kularatnoddyota (“Illuminating the Jewel of the Kula”) 1.78–79.117.

This Matsyendra must be different from the much earlier Macchanda (a.k.a.Matsyendra), the founder of Kaulism, but is clearly a figure modelled on thelatter.119. As clearly seen in the Nityākaula text discovered by Sanderson; see “TheŚaiva Age.”120. Two important works of this Vedānta/Tantra hybrid were produced in the lateMiddle Ages, the Saundarya-laharī and Ānanda-laharī (“Waves of Beauty” and“Waves of Bliss”), still much studied and recited today. They are not, ofcourse, authored by the original Śaṅkara, who does not exhibit any Tantrikinfluence.121. After the Muslim conquest of Kashmīr (1339), when Shaivism lost itsinstitutional base, the tradition began to contract, and study of the originalscriptures slowly disappeared, leaving a gnostically-oriented and trimmed-downversion of Śaiva Tantra based on the exegetical writings referred to here. For amore complete explanation of this process, see Sanderson’s “Swāmī Lakshman Jooand his Place in the Kashmīrīan Tradition.”122. My translation follows that of Sanderson in “Śaiva Exegesis,” p. 404.123. The former commentary has been translated by Mark Dyczkowski, the latter bySwāmī Lakṣman Jū.124. The last great Kashmīrī Guru of Śaivism, Swāmī Lakṣhman Jū, left his bodyin 1991. His Western disciples have continued to publish his work, including hiscommentary on the Śiva-sūtras and on the Vijñāna-bhairava, which are currentlythe best available translations of those works. Published in an imperfect butuseful translation by Jaidev Singh, under the title A Trident of Wisdom; notethat Singh’s other translations are not useful and not recommended, having allbeen superseded by substantially superior work.125.

Popular American scholar David White would have us believe thatpower-seeking sinister yogis were always the majority and argues this thesis inhis recent book Sinister Yogis. That book, like Kiss of the Yoginī, suffers fromthe serious scholarly defect of “confirmation bias,” research carried out with apredetermined thesis in mind (the more time-consuming and accurate method ofresearch is reading a wide and diverse range of sources without any specificidea of what one will find). For evidence that White’s work suffers from theskewed perspective generated by confirmation bias, see James Mallinson’s newreview of Sinister Yogis.127. James Mallinson wrote to me in an email in May 2011, “I’m not certain thatthe Amṛtasiddhi was a ‘Nāth’ text. It may be more closely connected to the[Śaiva] Kālamukha lineages found at Shringeri/Vijayanagara, the latter havingVirūpākṣa as its tutelary deity.”128. It is important to note that there was another major branch of thehaṭha-yoga tradition, a Vaiṣṇava branch that paralleled its Śaiva counterpart(because it was based in Tantrik teachings that ultimate derive from Śaivasources). The progression of this branch goes like this: the first text to teachsomething explicitly named haṭha-yoga is the 13th-century Dattātreya-yoga-śāstraor Scripture on Yoga by Lord Dattātreya. Dattātreya was said to be an avatāra(incarnation of God) who was claimed by both the Śaiva Dasnāmīs and theVaiṣṇavas, though he eventually become more associated with the latter. From theDattātreya-yoga-śāstra flowed a series of haṭha-yoga treatises that were copiedthroughout India. The practices taught in these texts influenced the Rāmānandīlineage (which survives to the present) and the Śrī-vaiṣṇava lineage (atradition with its roots in Vaiṣṇava Tantra; note that one of the latter’s11th-century scriptures, the Vimānārcanākalpa, is the first text to teachnon-seated āsanas). So it is important to note that the founder of modernpostural yoga, Śrī Krishnamāchārya, was a member of the Śrī-vaiṣṇava lineage(see p. 319 for more on him).129. To be more accurate, we cannot be sure that Gorakṣa’s source is theSārdhatriśati-kālottara, since that text was copied and paraphrased by severalother Tantrik scriptures, such as the Svacchanda-tantra. What Tompkins hasproven is that the author of The Hundred Verses of Gorakṣa had some Tantriktexts in front of him (or in his head) while writing, and the earliest knownsource for many of these specific ideas is the Sārdhatriśati-kālottara.130. To complicate the picture, there were other classifications of yogapractice that were more popular in the Tantrik scriptures than the aṣṭāṅga-yoga,such as the ṣaḍaṅga-yoga or six-limbed yoga that we see also in the MaitrīUpaniṣad.131. In a provocative and impeccably researched article in the Journal of IndianPhilosophy (“Haṃsamiṭṭhu: ‘Pātañjalayoga is Nonsense’”), my teacher SomdevVasudeva traces the various sources of the additional aṅgas presented in thisschema. The importance of the 18th-century writing of Haṃsa-miṭṭhu is that itshows both that Patañjali was known and cited in early modern India (prior toWestern interest in the text) and that Tantrik sources were cited more often andin the same context. For example, Haṃsa-miṭṭhu says that the value ofPatañjali’s yoga of eight limbs is that it frees one from karma, and then hecites as evidence not the Yogasūtra but rather the Kulārṇava-tantra! Then hegoes on to present the 15-aṅga yoga listed here. This implies to us that theaṣṭāṅga-yoga did not survive separately from the Tantrik yoga that had absorbedit.132. You can study the Yogasūtra in an engaging format of short videopresentations by going to my website learnyogasutras.com. The interpretation ofeach sūtra is inspired by the Tantra without diverging too much from Patañjali’soriginal intention.133. See Sanderson, “Swāmī Lakshman Joo and his Place in the KashmīrīanTradition,” pp. 118–19.134. See his groundbreaking book Yoga Body: The Origins of Modern PosturePractice from Oxford University Press.135. Since View and practice must be in alignment to bear their fruit, yogicpractice cannot be arbitrarily joined with any philosophy. From a traditionalperspective, then, the View that is taught in conjunction with yogic practicemust be one that was evolved in direct organic connection to yogic practice.136. The difference between these two terms is that dāna refers to a regular(e.g., monthly) donation to a temple, āshram, or guru, while dakṣiṇā refers to afinancial offering made in exchange for the guru’s teaching or ceremonialperformance. Today these two terms are more or less interchangeable.137. Here are the primary rules of the code of conduct (samaya) that Samayinswould adopt, using the samaya code of the Kaula Trika as an example (source:Tantrasāra 13):1. The initiate should be devoted and loyal, with his whole being, to his guru,the teachings, the form of the Deity s/he has been linked to, and thecorresponding mantra with which s/he has been initiated.2. S/he should nonjudgmentally turn away from those people who are opposed tothese four [guru, teachings, deity, and mantra].3. Just as he venerates the guru, he should venerate those “sons” of the guruwho have been initiated before him (i.e., senior guru-brothers and -sisters),his kin through the tie of wisdom (vidyā). He should also venerate the family ofthe guru, not because they have special status, but in order to pay tribute tohim.4. Women must be treated with reverence. The initiate must avoid any actionwhich might cause him to feel disgust for a woman.5. The name of his Deity, his guru, or his mantra should not be uttered incasual conversationbut only at the time of worship.6. The initiate should not look on anyone in the world as superior to himselfexcept for his guru.7. He should honor the lunar days on which special worship is required (e.g.,the full moon, the new moon, and the 8th and 14th lunar days).8. If members of his kula (spiritual community) visit his home, he shouldpractice with them to the best of his ability.9. He should avoid excessive social contact with followers of other traditionsduring this probationary period; if he becomes the pupil of someone from anothertradition, out of curiosity to learn his doctrine, he must give up that teacheras soon as the instruction is complete.10. He should honor sādhus (homeless mendicants), but not practice with them.11. He must give up all inhibitions, anxieties, and doubts (concerning castedifferences, purity laws, what is proper to eat, etc.).12. The only temple or pilgrimage site he may reverence is that of his own body.13. He should maintain awareness of the Heart-mantra as much as possible.138. This is drawn almost verbatim from a description was written by my teacherProf. Sanderson, drawing on accounts in the Netra-tantra (ch. 18), theHara-carita-cintāmaṇi (ch. 31), the Jayadratha-yāmala, and theSiddhānta-sāra-paddhati, one of the most important ritual manuals of the Śaivatradition. These sources are not published in English.139. I have read the Sanskrit sources that give us this information, but Ishould note that my understanding was greatly enhanced by Prof. Sanderson’sunpublished summaries of the relevant data in the Tantrāloka, Mṛgendra-tantra,and Siddhānta-sāra-paddhati.140. This section draws almost verbatim on unpublished writings by andconversations with Prof. Sanderson, whose expertise in the area of Śaiva ritualis far beyond mine, and due to whom I know what little I do of this ritualworld. However, I should note that my knowledge has more recently been augmentedby the work of my colleague Christopher Tompkins, who has been translatingsections of the Siddhānta-sāra-paddhati, which was also Sanderson’s source.141. Sound and sensation are offered to Brahmā, taste is offered to Viṣṇu,vision and odor are offered to Rudra, intellect and ego to Īśvara, and mind toSadāśiva. These are the eight parts of the eightfold subtle body thattransmigrates from one life to another.142. The dualistic Saiddhāntikas admit that there is often no perceptible effectof fusing the soul with Śiva; while the nondual Kaulas or Kaula-influencedlineages claim that their initiation frequently triggers a strong śaktipāta.143. Some confusion has arisen due to the use of the term “Rājānaka” by DouglasBrooks to denote his body of teachings. There is not any documented lineagecalled Rājānaka; in the original sources it simply denoted a Kashmīrī Tantrikscholar who had received official recognition and/or an endowment from the king,much like a knighthood in England. In time the title became hereditary. I havenot yet seen it used in non-Kashmīrī sources.144. In modern lineages influenced by Śaiva Tantra, such as that of Siddha Yoga,the concepts of śaktipāta and dīkṣā have fully merged, and the phraseśaktipāt-dīkṣā is used.145. See Sanderson’s “Commentary on the Opening Verses of the Tantrasāra,” p.84, where he explains that the Guru lineage is to be seen as a single state ofbeing, identical with the Deity, in which individual identities are irrelevant.146. I owe this phrase to my friend Dharmabodhi Sarasvatī, whose explanation ofGuru-yoga made all that I had previously learned about it finally click intoplace.147. This fact is complicated by the avadhūta type of Guru, who exists inperfect union with the divine but whose behavior takes no account of the rulesof propriety of the society in which he lives. A classic 20th-century example isthat of Bhagavān Nityānanda of Gaṇeshpurī.148. There is a strange misconception held by many of the students I have workedwith in regard to the concept of unconditional love. When exhorted to cultivateunconditional love for all beings, especially the actual people in one’s life,students often object, “But then I will be taken advantage of!” or “I don’t wantto be a doormat!” When I hear this, I am just flabbergasted. There is simply nological reason to suppose that having unconditional love for someone means thatyou do everything they tell you do, or fail to voice your own opinion, or failto maintain your independence in any way. Though I do not yet understand whyWesterners think otherwise, there is clearly a connection between this way ofthinking and the total fiasco of guru-disciple relationships that we have seenin recent history when Westerners are the disciples. From the traditionalperspective, you practice seeing and treating your Guru as God, and maintaincommitment to that practice regardless of what he does or says, all the way upuntil you abandon him if you have decided that his conduct is sufficiently inconflict with your beliefs that you will likely not be successful in yourguru-yoga. Then you would simply walk away and never look back. You do not spendyears bemoaning how wronged you were on the Internet. You simply find anotherguru whose conduct is not such a bar to the guru-yoga, and if you are verylucky, that person has an attainment that will make your guru-yoga relativelyeasy (though it’s never easy). After all, the whole reason guru-yoga can workregardless of the guru’s “level” is because he—and everyone—really is God! And,finally, nothing says that you have to practice guru-yoga at all. But forsomeone who really gets it, it’s one of the most efficient means to liberation.149. These three levels or centers are not immediately comprehensible to theWesterner who is likely to divide up the human being differently. As discussedearlier in the book, the Western dichotomy of heart versus mind is not operativein the Asian context, which views thoughts and emotions as inextricablylinked—“heart” and “mind” are the same word in Sanskrit (e.g., citta). Theheart-mind center is also the hub of the subtle body, and thus it is sometimesreferred to as the “energy” center. The issue of correctly indentifying thesecenters in English is further confused by the fact that the highest center, herecalled “spirit,” is named as Mind in some Buddhist sources. Both “spirit” and“higher Mind” refer to the spacious clarity of pure Awareness.150. Dyczkowski, Mark. The Doctrine of Vibration. SUNY Press, 1987, p. 172.151. TĀ 1.146–7; translation follows Dyczkowski 1987:180.152. Note that Zen—which derives from Ch’an Buddhism, which derives in part fromBuddhist Tantra—emphasizes śāmbhava-upāya to the extent that it sometimesexcludes the other upāyas entirely, which is precisely why it is onlyappropriate and effective for a certain type of practitioner.153. My translation of this verse was improved by Professor Sanderson, and thewording of the last phrase is his.154. Here I am arguing that all stories have their roots in conditioning, butnote that it does not follow that everything about a person’s individual makeupcan be explained in terms of psychology and their past history. In fact,sometimes we experience what might be called existential fear, anger, or joythat is not linked to our psychology but is spontaneously arising as a naturalexpression of embodied consciousness that cannot and need not be interpreted orexplained. These existential emotions may (or may not) be a manifestation ofyour connection to the “collective unconscious”; at any rate, they are not aproblem to be solved.155. Nirvikalpa does not here mean having no thoughts, but rather that thoughtsare not in the slightest degree taken to be reality, and therefore they nolonger interpose themselves and filter reality to the experiencer.156. Tantrāloka 15.269–71a; translated by Dyczkowski (1987:192).157. The last phrase, viśvottīrṇo viśvātmā cāham could be used as a mantra. Itadmits of several translations, specifically in its second word. viśvātmā canmean “I am one with the universe,” “I embody the universe,” “I am one with allthings,” “I embody all things,” or “I am the essence of the universe.” Thisconnects to the teaching given in Śiva-sūtra 1.13, dṛśyaṃ śarīram, “All that isperceptible is my body.”158. This alternate translation of the third phrase was suggested by Prof.Sanderson; the statement is delusional because of its implied dualism.159. In the parallel passage in Tantrāloka, Abhinava makes the unorthodox moveof arguing that anything can be used in worship if it elevates and expandsawareness, not only the prescribed substances:Therefore, whatever in this world evokes heightened awareness, even a littlebit, because it is graced by consciousness, it is enlivened and thus completelysuitable for worship in our system. ||164c-5b||Whatever effectively causes one’s submerged consciousness to emerge is suitablefor an offering, because it is this emergence of Awareness that is called bliss[ānanda]. ||167c-8b||This is the basis of his argument in favor of the use, by qualifiedpractitioners, of the sexual fluids for worship. These are considered powersubstances with semimagical properties in the Kaula Trika, but Abhinava reveresthem because they are produced only in heightened states of consciousness. Andif one’s sexuality has itself become a spiritual practice, as he teaches inchapter 29, the substances produced thereby are very sacred and powerful. One isthus to offer them in divine worship, not caste them away as waste products. Ifone cannot see sexual fluids as completely pure and divine, one is not a vīra,an adept ready for this level of practice. But this is just one specialapplication of the theory. It is equally unorthodox (from the perspective ofconservative Śaivas) to suggest that you can improvise in your pūjā and utilizewhatever heightens your awareness and gives you a sense of the sacred. But thisis of course the norm in a spiritual culture that has no orthodoxy, such asAmerican alternative spirituality.160. My understanding of the Sanskrit of this passage is due to Prof.Sanderson’s assistance.161. My translation in some places follows that of Sanderson’s: see“Visualization of the Deities of the Trika,” pp. 74–76.162. Dyczkowski, Mark. The Doctrine of Vibration. SUNY Press, 1987, p. 190.163. The clarity and precision of this description is very much due to therecent scholarly work of Christopher Tompkins, who is specializing in the yogicpractices of Śaiva Tantra. The brief description given here is of greatsignificance, for the commonly known haṭha-yoga materials that treat thissubject (using the later kuṇḍalinī terminology) can now be seen to haveclassical Śaiva Tantra as their source and antecedent.164. My understanding of uccāra is primarily due to the work of ChristopherTompkins and to a lesser extent that of Richard Davis (see his Ritual in anOscillating Universe).165. We should note that the functions of the five prāṇa-vāyus as described herein the context of mystical yoga practice are distinct from the functionsdescribed in the context of the medical liturature. There, for example, samānagoverns balance and digestion, udāna governs coughing, vomiting, and speaking,and vyāna governs distribution of nutrients, movement of the limbs, andsensation in extremities. The medical functions are certainly known to theTantras. They are linked to the mystical functions in certain ways; for example,udāna is associated with speech, and the power of speech derives from Parā-vāk,the Goddess of the Supreme Word, who is identical with kuṇḍalinī-śakti,universally identified as a “phonemic” or mantric power in the earliest sources.Eventually kuṇḍalinī-śakti comes to designate the innate intelligence ofembodied consciousness. However, we should note that in none of the Tantriksources is kuṇḍalinī-śakti described as lying dormant at the base of the spine.This idea, found in haṭha-yoga sources, would have been absurd to the Tāntrikas,for if kuṇḍalinī was dormant, you would be in a coma. Rather, in the Tantriksources, kuṇḍalinī dwells in the crown of the head, for the Goddess is eternallyinseparable from her other half. In Tantrik yoga-sādhanā, she is invited todescend to the relevant cakra (often the heart, sometimes the kanda), creating arubber-band like tension that then can be used to catapult the soul (individualconsciousness) up to the highest center. This revolutionary scholarly discoverymade by Christopher Tompkins was obvious to all initiates of classical Tantra,but since forgotten.166. I first learned about divya-karaṇa from my teacher Dr. Somdev Vāsudeva(Columbia University), and my knowledge of it was recently enhanced byChristopher Tompkins.167. I refer to the mechanical stretching of the tongue and severing of thefrenulum in order to insert the tongue tip into the pharynx and up into thenasal cavity. This is done in imitation of a spontaneous (involuntary) kriyāthat can happen as a result of kumbhaka (breath retention) practice, in whichthe tongue turns back and enters the pharynx and the practitioner tastes “divinenectar.” Though its occurance is well documented among yogīs (and evenoccasionally among long-distance swimmers), there is not yet scientificunderstanding of how it happens.168. One of my graduate school professors, Śrī Padmanabh Jaini, liked to compareIndia with the West with the words, “In India everyone can think differently aslong as they all act the same, whereas in the West everyone is free to actdifferently as long as they all think the same.”169. Sanderson, “Meaning in Tantric Ritual,” (1995), pp. 24–25.170. Paraphase of “Maṇḍala and Āgamic Identity,” pp. 171–2 and quote from p.173.171. This reminds me of the beautiful teaching of the early Sūfī woman saintRābi’a of Basra. She was seen walking through town carrying a torch and a bucketof water. The people asked her why, and she replied, “I am going to burn downheaven and extinguish the fires of hell so that people will worship God for thesake of God alone!”172. tathaikyābhyāsa-niṣṭhasyākramād viśvam idaṃ haṭhāt |saṃpūrṇa-śivatā-kṣobha-narīnartad iva sphuret || 15.151My translation is of course influenced by Sanderson, and I would not haveunderstood the sense of the word kṣobha (which usually means “agitation,“ heretranslated [following him] as “intense animation“) without his aid.173. Abhinava is here quoting from Utpaladeva’s Śivastotrāvalī, hymn 17. Thefact that he seems to be quoting from memory corroborates my vision of thepresent passage as being dictated while in an exalted state.174. tadetādṛk-pūrṇa-śiva-viśvāveśāya ye ’rcanam | kurvanti te śivā eva tānpūrṇān prati kiṃ phalam || We could also translate pūrṇa-śiva-viśva as “theuniverse as Śiva in his fullest expansion” following Sanderson. The phrase “thisstate in which they enter into and become immersed in the experience…”translates the various nuances of the single word āveśa.175. My translation closely follows that of Sanderson, Śaiva Exegesis, p. 295.The term sāhasa-samādhi is unique to the Krama and means something like “asudden and intense plunge into a mystical state of consciousness.” Sandersontranslates “the trance of sudden enlightenment” or “sudden immersion in thedynamic purity of consciousness.” The word sāhasa usually means an aggressive,violent assault (!).176. Originally maṇḍala meant a temporary large-scale Tantrik diagram used formeditation and initiation rites, and yantra meant a small magical diagram orsymbol for controlling energy, sometimes written on a scroll and buried orplaced in a locket for protection. Now the terms are used almostinterchangeably.177. See “Maṇḍala and Āgamic Identity,” p. 170, note 3. The list comes fromTantrāloka chapter 27.178. Adapted from the authoritative 11th century manual, theSomaśambhu-paddhati. This book, written by the equivalent of an archbishop ofŚaivism named Somaśambhu, has been translated into French by the late HeleneBrunner.179. For more information on this subject, see the first few pages ofSanderson’s “A Commentary on the Opening Verses of the Tantrasāra,” especiallynote 7, and also page p. 174 of “Maṇḍala and Āgamic Identity.”180. There is one sexual rite recorded in the literature, of a very differentcharacter. This is the “Razor’s Edge Observance” recorded in chapter 39 of theBrahmayāmala (see p. 223–5). Here an otherwise celibate homeless Śākta Śaivaascetic obtains a beautiful girl “eager for good sex,” giving her as muchjewelry as he can afford, and couples with her every day for one to six monthswithout ejaculating in order to obtain special powers through this Herculeaneffort, said to be “hard to practice even for gods.” If he ejaculatesaccidentally (e.g., at night or because she makes him), he must do 10,000repetitions of his mantra; if he does so on purpose, he must start all over.Clearly, this also bears no real resemblence to American “Tantric sex,” thoughrefraining from ejaculation also appears as a theme there, though this probablyderives from the influence of the so-called “Taoist sexuality” taught by MantakChia and others, not from awareness of the unpublished Brahmayāmala.181. People familiar with the extant popular literature on Tantra will haveheard of the “five M’s” rather than the three. This is because thepost-classical Tantra of east India is better known than classical HimālayanTantra. The Bengalis, being great fish-lovers, added matsya to the list, butthen needed a fifth because four is not a sacred number, so they cast about andadded mudrā, fried grains, despite the fact that it is not a transgressivesubstance. This has led to comical speculations by under-informed Westernscholars that perhaps the grain in question had a psychedelic mold growing on it(!).182. Manuṣya-jātir ekaiva…na jātir vihitā tatra varṇam vāpi sitādikam,yoni-liṅgodbhavāḥ sarve jīva ekaḥ samaḥ sthitaḥ. Tatra sarvagato Devo dṛśyatejñāna-cakṣuṣā.183. A few teachers of American neo-Tantra have now become acquainted with oneor two of the published texts, such as the Vijñāna-Bhairava Tantra, and use themin their teaching. While this attempt to connect to the original tradition iscommendable, to my mind it in no way substitutes for a thorough and sustainedengagement with a wide range of primary sources and published material byaccomplished scholars on the philosophy and development of the Tantriktraditions. Only such an engagement, in my view, qualifies a teacher to claim torepresent an ancient tradition accurately, especially when that tradition isrooted in such a different cultural matrix as medieval India.184. See Unbounded Wholeness: Dzogchen, Bön, and the Logic of the Nonconceptualin the Bibliography. For more on Dzogchen, especially as interpreted within Bön,see Namkhai Norbu, Samten Karmay, Per Kvaerne, and David Snellgrove.185. With one exception: the sexual rite taught as the “Razor’s Edge Observance”in chapter 39 of the Brahmayāmala (see p. 223). Here, an otherwise celibatehomeless Śākta Śaiva ascetic obtains a beautiful girl “eager for good sex,”giving her as much jewelry as he can afford, and couples with her every day forone to six months without ejaculating in order to obtain special powers throughthis Herculean effort, said to be “hard to practice even for gods.” If heejaculates accidentally (e.g., at night or because she makes him), he must do10,000 repetitions of his mantra; if he does so on purpose, he must start allover. The explicit purpose of this rite is to gain magical powers. Clearly, thisbears no real resemblance to American “Tantric sex,” since its purpose isneither increasing intimacy nor maximizing pleasure. Refraining from ejaculationdoes sometimes appear as a theme in American neo-tantra; this probably derivesfrom the influence of the so-called “Taoist sexuality” taught by Mantak Chia andothers, not from awareness of the unpublished Brahmayāmala."},{"pageContent":"BIBLIOGRAPHYBooksAlper, Harvey, ed.
