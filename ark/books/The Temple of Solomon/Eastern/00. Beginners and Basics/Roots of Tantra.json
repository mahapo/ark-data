This book is aninitial study addressing origins in that it attempts to seek out and understand someof the nascent forms and sources of Tantrism in ancient India. The volume grewout of two conferences held in the greater Los Angeles area in October 1989 andMarch 1995 that were devoted specifically to fleshing out the meager evidence onearly Tantrism. It is a matter of great satisfaction that so many scholars haveworked to address questions concerning the origins and have shaped careful anddetailed responses, particularly given the paucity of material remnants, both ar-chaeological and textual, known at this time. The reader will encounter variousapproaches to the general topic concerning roots and origins; the diversity is theresult of specific disciplines and backgrounds, each scholar bringing unique in-sights to the general topic. By no means does this volume attempt to be com-prehensive; the problems involved in uncovering inchoate elements giving rise toTantrism and its early manifestations are far too broad to be bound in a singlevolume. What we hope to accomplish is to pose a body of new questions andstimulate new dialogue and research in the field of Tantric studies.The editors wish to thank the many participants for their excellent con-tributions and their great patience. In addition, we would like to thank the Societyfor Tantric Studies, Loyola Marymount University and the University of Califor-nia at Los Angeles for various forms of support along the way.—Katherine Anne Harper"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"This page intentionally left blank."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"1IntroductionRobert L. BrownStella’s personal spiritual teacher was a wandering ́Saivite Tantric monkwho belonged to the Aghori orders . . . He tested her through a drastic ́Saiva experience in which she was to follow him to the Kalighat temple,where he had her ascend a funeral pyre and sit on a corpse that wasabout to be cremated.... Then he told her to gather the ashes, takethem home, and rub them on her body.—Barbara Stoler Miller, Exploring India’s Sacred ArtBarbara Miller describes an experience in the life of Stella Kramrisch that tookplace sometime in the 1920s or 1930s in Calcutta. A pioneer in Indian art history,her volumes on the Hindu temple and studies of ́Siva have defined the field. Millergoes on to say, “Throughout the entire happening she [Stella] had implicit faith inits validity as a ritual that confirmed her in her fearlessness and let her understandlife with a lightened heart.”1 I bring up this incident because it appears ratheroutside the bounds of Tantric research and scholarship. It is so highly idiosyncraticand unusual2 that it causes one to wonder if it actually happened. It fits, however,with the individualistic and personalized nature of Tantric practices. No onewould find it hard to identify the episode as Tantric, despite difficulty in associat-ing it with a specific ritual or text. What Kramrisch derived from the experiencewas a sense of power and a feeling of well-being, both Tantric goals.Almost every study of Tantrism begins by apologizing. Scholars say it is littleunderstood, that it cannot be easily or precisely defined and that it lacks a coherentstructure. Andr ́e Padoux in his article in this volume (What do we Mean byTantrism?) outlines some of what makes defining Tantrism so difficult. First, it is aterm, in fact a notion, that is Western. It is not a concept that comes from withinthe religious system itself, although it is generally recognized internally as differentfrom the Vedic tradition. This immediately makes it suspect as an independentcategory.Second, Tantrism is not a coherent system; it is an accumulation of practicesand ideas from various sources distributed unevenly in different times, places, andsects and among individuals. While the pieces of Tantrism (doctrines and prac-tices) can be listed, none is exclusively Tantric, and all are components of other"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"2Robert L. Brownreligious systems. Rather, one might see them as cumulative, with some systemshaving more components being weighted toward the Tantric. Thus there are levelsor degrees of Tantrism.Third, Tantric pieces can be mixed easily with other non-Tantric aspects,such as bhakti (devotional) worship being used alongside Tantric approaches tothe deity.3 For one who worships the deity in multiple ways, can we say he or she isat one point a Tantric practitioner, and not at another point? Thus, even to arguewhat it is by saying what it is not is not entirely successful.Rather than a system, cult, or religion Andr ́e Padoux speaks of a “Tantricvision” and includes among its characteristics the use of ritual, manipulation ofpower, transgression of norms, use of the mundane to reach the supramundane,and identification of the microcosm with the macrocosm. The reader may want aswell to refer to the list of eighteen constituents of Tantrism in Teun Goundriaan’sintroduction to Hindu Tantrism.4Unfortunately for the topic of this book, what is or is not Tantric is ofimportance. The articles in the book came from two conferences focused on thequestion, what were the roots of Tantrism? Scholars were asked to explore how,when, and where Tantrism began. What were the sources for Tantrism and whencan we begin to speak of Tantrism as an independent religious tradition? Whatwere the causes, historical and religious? While these questions are not answeredfully in the papers of this volume, they are carefully and extensively explored froma variety of viewpoints, methodologies, and approaches. One of the book’sstrengths is that the questions are pursued not only from a textual viewpoint, butfrom art historical and historical approaches as well.It was decided to focus on Hindu Tantrism. While Buddhist Tantrism isdiscussed in some papers, it is not given equal weight in the volume. This is notbecause we felt Buddhist Tantrism was less important or that it could not beexplored for Tantra’s roots, but that it would require another book.Before turning to the papers, I want to propose a way of viewing Tantrism interms of process rather than as a static structure of characteristics. Emphasis onprocess points out that Tantrism is predominantly action, either physical or men-tal, with less stress on belief, doctrine, or theology. It also allows identification ofwhat is and is not Tantric in terms of application rather than in terms of thequalities and characteristics themselves. I will present the model in a diagram, andthen make some comments on it:ProcessesAccomplished byGuided byGoalsvisualizationritual (kriya)teacher/guruenlightenmentverbalizationyoga, the body,deitymuktiidentificationma ̧n ̧dala, cakra,worldly powerinternalizationmantra, yantra,bhukticoncretizationp ̄uj ̄a, icontransformation"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"3IntroductionStarting with the goals first,both enlightenment and worldly success areexpected. These goals are frequently separated in religions, including Indian re-ligions, with two different sets of activities expected to achieve them. Enlighten-ment, often seen as a difficult process of endless rebirths achievable only byadvanced religious specialists, can be reached in Tantrism during one lifetimewhile the practitioner is still alive. On the other hand, worldly power, even of themost mundane kind, for example success in love, is also achievable at the sametime as enlightenment; they are intertwined. Success in this world need not beshunned to achieve enlightenment, a position held by ́srama ̃nic (mendicant) Bud-dhists, Jains, and the Brahmanic tradition of the Hindus. For non-Tantric Bud-dhists, Jains, and Hindus, the life of a householder is a serious impediment for fullspiritual accomplishment; instead the ascetic life is needed to move forward.The way for Tantric practitioners to reach dual goals comes by connectingthemselves to a power that flows through the world, including their own bodies, apower usually visualized as female. Tantrins identify the power, locate it, activateit, and use it for their own desires. The process brings into play the other threecategories of the chart above: a guide, a set of tools, and various transformationalactions. The guide is above all the teacher (the guru) who is simultaneously thedeity and ultimately the student as well. Indeed, the collapsing and overlappingidentities of the teacher is one illustration of the transformational processes socentral to Tantrism that involve the movement both toward a unity, an essence, acenter, and a monism while simultaneously breaking into dualities and multiplesthat replicate (often in numbered ranks) toward the periphery.The importance of the guru cannot be overstated, as she/he is the only wayfor a student to learn Tantric practice. The oft-stated idea that Tantrism is esotericbecause a secret tradition is passed between teacher and student is not unfounded.It helps to explain the individual approach to worship, the lack of a temple ormonastery, and less focus on a loving relationship with a deity (all characteristics oftheistic Hinduism). It also brings into question the use of written texts in theTantric tradition, the primary source for scholars of Tantrism. Is it like attemptingto understand the art of auto mechanics by reading through the auto partscatalogs? We may know a great deal about the components, but how they cometogether and work is known only by hands-on experience.The tools used by the teacher and student listed in the second column arenot intended to be inclusive. They share, however, certain characteristics: they areall “things” or involve the manipulation of “things.” I have put the word things inquotation marks because they can be visualized or imagined, and they can beinternalized so that they are placed within the body. There is often a hierarchyimposed on them as well, so that, for example, the drawing of a physical yantra isof a lower spiritual power than one drawn in the heart of the practitioner. Thespiritual scale going from the concrete to the more abstract is found in all Indicreligions.The tools in Tantrism are less doctrines and beliefs than concrete things that"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"4Robert L. Brownthe practitioner learns to manipulate in certain specific ways, sequences, andpatterns. This involves actions and processes with things being taken through timeand space. Indeed, the ultimate tool in Tantra is the human body, both the outsideand the inside, both the anatomical body of arms, hands, tongue, heart, genitals,and mind, and the yogic anatomy of cakras and n ̄a ̧d ̄ıs. It is control of the body as atool used to actuate processes that connects the practitioner with the universalpower to reach his goals.I have listed six processes, again not intending to be comprehensive, that thetools are used to bring about. They can be seen as paired. The first two, visualiza-tion and verbalization, involve seeing and speaking the power into being. Theimportance of seeing (dar ́sana) in approaching the deity has often been noted inIndian religions and it is used in Tantric practice as well, but often is interiorizedor envisaged rather than directed toward an icon. One of the abilities of a Tantricworshiper is to create visions of the deities (and other signs) in his mind’s eye.Verbalization is of the greatest importance in Tantric worship as the recitation ofsounds (mantras).Mantras are learned from the teacher and are conceived assounds, not as written word; and, just as visualizing brings about the deities andthe powers they manifest, so does the use of mantra.The paired processes of identification and internalization indicate actionsthat make the worshiper divine, the realization of which is needed to gain access tothe universal power. An example of identification has already been mentionedabove, when the teacher and the deity are identified as one. Such telescoping ofidentities is needed to pull everything into the body of the worshiper so that theultimate identification can be made of the deity with the worshiper. The impor-tance of internalizing the concrete “thing” as a mental image is central to beingable to create within the body what is outside it. Tantric ritual seems to be set up asa pairing of doing something involving manipulating a thing (like drawing ayantra) and then imagining it within through a mental image.The last pairing consists of concretization and transformation, two seem-ingly opposite procedures. Once internalization is achieved, it does not mean thatthe process is unidirectional as the ritual always involves arranging, moving, andchanging real things, even when internalization has taken place; the processes areintertwined and occilating. By concretization I mean that, for the Tantric practi-tioner, things (including such things as sounds or deities) have a reality that takesform in the world, cannot be abandoned, and must be used. The final process,transformation, can be applied to all the processes, as it seems to me the mostessential of them all, as all involve one thing changing into another. Indeed, theability to change one reality through ritual manipulation of things into anothertruer, more powerful reality may be one definition of Tantrism.Finally, what aspects of Indian religions (Pur ̄a ̧nic Hinduism and Buddhism,for example) are less stressed by this Tantric view? Immediately, there are prob-lems; to separate Hinduism and Buddhism from Tantric practices is, as notedabove, difficult. Andr ́e Padoux’s observation that “for a thousand years, most"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"5IntroductionHinduism has been either Tantric or Tantricized”5 underlines the futility inattempting to categorize and divide what is and is not Tantric in current Hindupractices. Still, if we say we are talking about emphasis, not difference, we cansuggest several areas less emphasized in Tantric practice than in certain other Indicreligions. I will suggest five: less stress on mythology and narrative stories ofdeities, less stress on love for god, less stress on moral action (for Buddhism), lessstress on temple worship and priests, and less stress on patronage of art, temples,and good works (on merit and therefore on karma). To expand and explain thesewould take us too far afield, but I ask the reader to keep them in mind whilereading through the articles in this book. Evidence in support of this less-stressedlist (and it can certainly be lengthened) is seen in part from observing that thetopics are not important aspects of the discussions in the articles in this book.The very brief and simple introduction to Tantrism given above is intendedto orient the reader, particularly one who comes to the topic without muchbackground, as discussions of Tantrism can become fairly complex and technical.The book’s twelve papers are divided into five sections with the first including twopapers that give overviews of Tantrism while focusing on the issues of beginningsand relationships.OverviewsThe first essay by Andr ́e Padoux sets up for us (as mentioned already) some of theoverall questions regarding Tantrism and why these questions have not beenanswered, demonstrating why the search for Tantra’s roots will not be easy. Inaddition, Padoux points out a source of confusion—and one that is particularlyimportant for us—between Tantric practice and its sources, what might be calledits mimetic nature. Again and again, Tantrism appears to replicate or copy eitherpre-Tantric or local practices. The question is whether the relationship is in termsof sources or of parallel but independent origins. Padoux mentions as examplesmicro-macrocosmic correspondences, magic use of power, power in terms ofviolence and transgression, and feminine aspect of the deity, all characteristic ofTantrism but all found in either pre-Tantric or autochthonous local religion. Arethese roots or merely parallel branches from the same trunk?Padoux ends his essay by proposing two possible definitions of Tantrismthat might focus its seemingly amorphous nature, both of which, however, heultimately rejects.One is to confine Tantrism to the “hard core” practitioners: a system ofobservances (often transgressive in nature) that are given meaning by a moreor less power-oriented vision of man and the cosmos, a system where poweris manipulated, where micro-macrocosmic correspondences play an essen-tial role. Also, there is usually a high degree of esotericism (the higher, themore esoteric, the more “Tantric”) together with a particular type of pan-"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"6Robert L. Browntheon (not necessarily sexually differentiated however), and a particular andvery developed type of ritual. Outside these qualifications, there may exist avarying number and proportion of Tantric traits, but not Tantrism as such.The second definition is one frequently applied to Tantrism, “to stress its ritualaspect without omitting entirely the ideological side, but subordinating it toritual.” Padoux rejects both approaches and ends his essay saying, “I fear we stillhave to toil to find a solution to the problem of Tantrism.”The second essay by David N. Lorenzen, “Early Evidence for Tantric Re-ligion,” is a straightforward review of the historical evidence for the appearance ofTantrism, serving as an excellent pendant to Padoux’s thematic article. Lorenzensuggests that there are two ways to define Tantrism, one is “a narrow definition[that] considers as Tantric only religious phenomena directly associated with theTantras, Sa ̧mhit ̄as and ̄Agamas,” that is texts written in Sanskrit and thus directedtoward an elite. The second broader definition adds “an ample range of popular‘magical’ beliefs and practices, including much of ́S ̄akta and Ha ̧tha Yoga tradi-tions,” traditions that use predominantly vernacular languages. Lorenzen choosesthe second as a definition, and then proceeds to sort through historical, textual,and epigraphical sources to locate in time and geography the beginnings of Tantr-ism. He concludes that Tantrism begins to be discerned in the fifth century ..and is clearly seen by the seventh. By the ninth it was fully manifested in bothHinduism and Buddhism. He finds its beginnings to be “primarily a northernphenomena,” with its centers in Bihar, Bengal, Assam, Kashmir, Nepal, Tibet, thePunjab, and Rajasthan. While these dates and localities may seem rather conserva-tive to some, Lorenzen’s historical evidence supports them. He does not deny thatthere are characteristics of Tantrism that can be traced to a much earlier time. Hispoint is that Tantrism as such (“the complex as a whole”) cannot be earlier.The History and Development of TantraMost of the book’s essays deal in some way with developments of Tantrismthrough time, but the three included in this section demonstrate three distinctlydifferent approaches to understanding development and change. The most com-prehensive is M. C. Joshi’s “Historical and Iconographic Aspects of ́S ̄akta Tantr-ism,” which traces goddess worship in India from the Upper Paleolithic throughthe thirteenth century .. Joshi uses as evidence texts, inscriptions, and art tooutline the major shifts and changes in the worship of goddesses, and the essayserves as an excellent survey of the historical points at which Tantric-flavoredimagery and practices were added. Joshi assumes that goddess worship is, in someway, Tantric by nature, stating at the beginning that “ ́S ̄akta Tantrism has its rootsin prehistoric concepts of a fertile mother goddess and ancient systems for herworship.” He does not suggest any one point in time or change in iconography"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"7Introductionthat divides ancient goddesses from Tantric goddesses, nor contemporary non-Tantric goddesses from Tantric ones. The advantage of this is that he is neverforced to propose a confining and monolithic definition of Tantrism, but outlinesa continuous, cumulative development. Nor does he attempt to show why thechanges he notes have taken place. In other words, he assumes that Tantrism existsin some form from the beginning of religion in India, that it is connected togoddess worship, and that the way the goddesses developed over time is in itself ahistory of Tantrism.A very different approach to ́S ̄akta Tantrism is given in Douglas RenfrewBrooks’s article “Auspicious Fragments and Uncertain Wisdom: The Roots of ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a ́S ̄akta Tantrism in South India.” Rather than a historical survey of prac-tices, Brooks’s study is a detailed look at a particular text, the Tirumantiram,written in Tamil by the seventh century saint Tirum ̄ular. Brooks finds thatTirum ̄ular knew aspects of a highly detailed and organized form of Tantric god-dess worship, the ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a. What he is able to show is that Tirum ̄ular—while a ́Saivite and not a Tantric worshiper—knew and used essential aspects, particularlythe ́sr ̄ıvidy ̄a mantra, of the ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a system. Since the ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a system developed innorth India, probably in Kashmir, and takes form in Sanskrit texts only in theninth century, Brooks demonstrates that “the structure of ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a ideology musthave been in place perhaps as long as two centuries before its crystallization inSanskrit texts.” Furthermore, that Tirum ̄ular was familiar with this ideology andcould incorporate it into his own religious system, argues for a surprisingly earlyIndia-wide awareness of “Tantric” thought that existed outside of texts and tem-ples. Brooks’s paper suggests there was a shared Tantric ideology in India thatexisted before codification in Sanskrit texts and that was not yet restricted tospecific groups.The third paper in this section, Thomas B. Coburn’s “The Structural Inter-play of Tantra, Ved ̄anta, and Bhakti: Nondualist Commentary on the Goddess,”focuses the discussion on a single passage from the sixth-century Dev ̄ı-M ̄ah ̄atmya.Coburn’s approach to the passage is to compare the analysis of two eighteenth-century Indian commentators, N ̄agoji Bha ̧t ̧ta and Bh ̄askarar ̄aya, the first an Ad-vaita Ved ̄antin and the second a Tantric follower of ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a (the system men-tioned by Brooks). Coburn finds that the two use similar references, and both areinvolved in attempts to apply a monistic or nondual reading of the passage and ofreality. But whereas N ̄agoji Bha ̧t ̧ta must ultimately say that even the goddess mustbe subordinate to a more ultimate reality (“Brahman-without-qualities”), theTantric Bh ̄askarar ̄aya is:unwilling to ascribe secondary status to the physical world, or to the senses,or to the manifest diversity of the Goddess’s form. The way in which [heavoids] epistemological dualism is not philosophically, but ritually—through the esoteric, experiential transformation of the world.... What"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"8Robert L. Browndifferentiates the two nondualisms, then, is that one—Advaita Ved ̄anta—isof a public and profoundly philosophical sort, while the other—Tantra—inclines toward a private and ritualized experience of oneness.Each of the authors in this section—Joshi, Brooks, and Coburn—hasfocused on the goddess and the development of ́S ̄akta Tantrism, but each hasaddressed them very differently, demonstrating the advantages and disadvantagesof going from a broad historical survey to a focused and highly detailed analysis ofa single moment.The Art History and Archaeology of TantraThe first paper in this section, that by Thomas McEvilley entitled “The SpinalSerpent,” may at first appear to be neither art historical nor archeological, but I amusing McEvilley’s own use of the term archaeology that he introduced in his article“The Archeology of Yoga” in 1981.6 His article in this volume can be seen as anextension of his earlier article where he argues for yogic practices in the IndusValley culture (ca. 2800–1700...), using as evidence six seals showing figuresinm ̄ul ̄abandh ̄asana, a Ha ̧tha yoga posture used to activate the ku ̧n ̧dalin ̄ı and thatimplies the existence of the three channels (n ̄a ̧d ̄ıs) of yogic physiology (su ̧sum ̧na,i ̧d ̄a, and pi ̇ngala). In “The Spinal Serpent” McEvilley points out, for the first time,the startling parallels between “the Hindu doctrine of the ku ̧n ̧dalin ̄ı [and] Plato’sdoctrine in the Timaeus.” These correlations are so complete—even to the twosubtle channels that flank the spine, the need to retain the “soul-stuff ” or sperm inthe head rather than expend it through ejaculation, and the visualization of thispower as a serpent—that McEvilley undertakes to search for connections betweenGreece, India and even China. He concludes that the Tantric physiology is notexclusively an Asian element, and that “a diffusion situation probably involvingsome of the factors just reviewed was involved in its presence in India as well as inGreece.” The roots of Tantra, according to McEvilley, seem here “to direct ourgaze into the darkest depths of human prehistory.”Katherine Anne Harper argues in the next paper “The Warring ́Saktis: AParadigm for Gupta Conquests” that the Tantric notion of female power ( ́sakti)was applied to a preexisting group of goddesses, the seven mothers or Sap-tam ̄at ̧rk ̄ as, an association that brought the mothers into the mainstream of Hindureligion. She pinpoints this at ca. 400 .., during the Gupta Dynasty, making itamong the earliest evidence we have for fully developed Tantric images, and longbefore we have actual Tantric texts (ca. ninth century). The association of ́saktiwith the mothers was, Harper feels, done in a structured, purposeful manner byVaidika Tantrins who:devised rituals meant to strengthen the king’s power and protect the estab-lished order. Their reformation of older religious symbols resulted in elevat-"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"9Introductioning a female septad from its shadowy past and relocating it centrally in theHindu pantheon. At the same time, the reformers provided the newlyevolved deities with attributes . . . that signified martial and spiritual em-powerment, particularly for the king.Thus, the mothers and their Tantric powers were used by the Gupta kings, apolitical use of Tantrism rarely argued by scholars. Her suggestion provides a newexplanation for the popularization of Tantrism. Harper relies on texts, epigraphy,and art for her evidence.The third paper in this section, Dennis Hudson’s “Early Evidence of theP ̄a ̃ncar ̄atra ̄Agama,” also relies on texts, inscriptions, and art to argue that theBh ̄aghavata (K ̧r ̧s ̧na) tradition was a coherent religious system from the first cen-tury ... or earlier: “I shall discuss early evidence for the P ̄a ̃ncar ̄atra ̄Agama. Theevidence places the ̄Agama in the first three or four centuries ... and connects itwith a consistent ritual and theological tradition that centers on V ̄asudeva K ̧r ̧s ̧na.”Taking as a model the Vaiku ̧n ̧tha Perum ̄al Temple at Kanchipuram for the organi-zation and identification of manifestations of V ̄asudeva, Hudson applies theschema to a reinterpretation of numerous sculptures, particularly from Mathuradating to the Kushan period (first to third centuries ..). Furthermore, he appliesthe model to the exegesis of texts as well, including the Bhagavad G ̄ıt ̄a. The resultis a new interpretation of an early Hindu religious system, one that displays a seriesof overlaps with both Vedic and Tantric rituals and practices, and one in which tosearch for Tantra’s roots.The Vedas and TantraThe next two essays deal with the relationships between the Vedic and the Tantrictraditions. Teun Goudriaan in “Imagery of the Self from Veda to Tantra” showsthat Tantrism relied on previously existing concepts and images, those found inthe Vedas and the Upani ̧sads, rather than producing new symbolic systems, andthus he stresses continuity over disjuncture. He focuses on the concept of the“self ” or ̄Atman, identifying five categories in Indian thought of metaphoricalimagery used to discuss the ̄Atman (soul or self ): self as a person—literally a littleman—in the heart; self as part of a family; self as a ruler and enjoyer; self as amover (often as a bird); and self as the sun. This imagery forms relationshipsbetween concepts of spirituality and of the world of appearances. Tantric interpre-tations tend toward concretization, often with a theistic interpretation, so that theself becomes less the individual ̄Atman and more identified with God. Goudriaanwrites:they [the Tantric practitioners] applied the images, which in the olderUpani ̧sads and some later texts referred to the undivided or individual self,to their conceptions of a Supreme Self, which they experienced as insepara-"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"10Robert L. Brownble form the Supreme Godhead worshiped by their school or sect. We couldspeak of a theistic reorientation of the old auto-mystical tradition, entailinga tendency to loss of authority for the individual self.Thus, Goudriaan demonstrates shifts in Tantric ideology but using older imagery.A second paper that analyzes the relationship between Tantric and Vedictraditions is Richard K. Payne’s “Tongues of Flame: Homologies in the TantricHoma.” Payne is arguing, as did Goudriaan, for continuity between the Vedic andTantric traditions. He looks to homa rituals (“votive ritual in which offerings aremade into a fire”), tracing three groups of relationships: characteristics of the ritualuse of fire, identification of the fire with people, and identification of the fire withgods. His evidence includes the Shingon tradition of Japan, Tantric Buddhismthat dates from the beginning of the ninth century, as well as the traditions ofIndia. He identifies many continuities between Vedic and Tantric homa, with ashift from three fires to one, and then the identification of the fire with both thedeity and the practitioner, as indicative of Tantric differences. He concludes that“the Tantras appear to be much more firmly rooted in the Vedas than is usuallysuggested.”The Texts and TantraThe final two papers bring us to firm ground with discussions of full-fledgedTantric texts. Paul E. Muller-Ortega in “Becoming Bhairava: Meditative Vision inAbhinavagupta’sPar ̄atr ̄ı ́sik ̄a-laghuv ̧rtti,” hopes:that this exploration of the meaning of Bhairava [in the text] will contributeto an understanding of an important ideological shift in the development ofearly Hindu Tantra. The intent of this essay, therefore, is not so muchhistoriographical as it is patently hermeneutic. If we are to understand theroots of the Hindu Tantra, we need to uncover the radical and crucialinterpretive shifts that contribute to its successful ideological consolidation.One of the shifts he identifies in Abhinavagupta’s texts is from Bhairava seen as anexternal anthropomorphic but fierce deity to the embodiment of all-encompassingreality. Muller-Ortega also stresses the importance of the interplay between ritualand meditation, along with the concomitant oscillation between external andinternal Tantric practices. He ends by saying Abhinavagupta’s writings (of thetenth century) show:that this early Hindu Tantra rejects the dry vistas of traditional philosophi-cal debate, which seek only the representation of the Ultimate throughconceptual truths. It rejects as well the self-enclosing renunciation of tradi-tional Indian monasticism, which protectively seeks to isolate the monk"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"11Introductionfrom the imagined stain of worldliness. Transcending the dualities anddistinctions of conventional thought and morality, the Tantra demonstratesan outward gesture of embracing delight in all of reality. The Tantric heropushes outward into adventurous, spiritual exploration, into savoring anddelighting the experience of so many varieties of blissful ekarasa, the unitarytaste of consciousness.Perhaps a more positive and eloquent statement of Tantrism’s goals could not bemade, particularly when they have been so darkly painted by many other scholars.The final paper in the book is Lina Gupta’s “Tantric Incantation in the Dev ̄ıPur ̄a ̧na: the Padam ̄al ̄a Mantra Vidy ̄a.” This paper will leave the reader with a tasteof Tantric ritual. The Dev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧na, while difficult to date, is one of the earlier ofthePur ̄a ̧nic texts, and may date to around the sixth century .. It is in praise ofthe goddess, and Gupta gives a full exploration of the important mantra (thePadam ̄al ̄a Mantra Vidy ̄a) in the text that ́Siva uses to invoke the goddess. Whenthe worshiper recites the mantra, he or she “changes internally as well as externally. . . The ultimate goal of human life, according to Tantrism, is to internalize thecosmos and unify the inner vibrations with the outer.” Gupta discusses the ritualperformance of the mantra, specifying what are its prerequisites, preparations,procedures, and performance.Lina Gupta’s paper leads, finally, to my brief conclusion. Gupta discusses aword used in the Padam ̄al ̄a Mantra Vidy ̄a:“kap ̄alamathana,” which means skull(kap ̄ala) churning (mathana). She says that the kap ̄ala or skull cup, an essentialimplement for Tantric ritual, refers to when ́Siva cut off one of Brahm ̄a’s heads,only to be forced to wander in penance with the skull attached to his hand, using itto beg alms, until finally having it drop when he reached Varanasi. Gupta also tellshow skulls were used in rituals, such as drinking wine from them (this is, in fact,the point of the word churning-skull, as it involved stirring the wine in the skullcup). Finally, she speaks of the use of skulls to predict the future by tapping onthem (kap ̄alako ̧tani), specifically by Atharvavedic Brahmins and Tantrins, one ofwhom (Va ̧ng ̄ısa) is mentioned in a Buddhist text and whom she feels may havelived in Bengal.There are a series of reliefs from Gandhara, an area in present-day Pakistan,that date from as early as ca. 100 .. that actually show skull tappers. The reliefshave been discussed in an article by Maurizio Taddei,7 one of which I illustratehere (Figure 1). The Buddha sits in the center, flanked by two skull tappers, bothof whom hold a skull. The figure on his left is identified as a Buddhist monk,8while the right-side figure, who has his head wrapped with a cloth, is a Brahmin,identified by his hair knot showing over his forehead. Buddhist texts that discussthis story9 tell how Va ̧ng ̄ısa was able to tell from a skull what the future rebirth ofthe dead person would be. Called before the Buddha, he told future births of allwhose skulls were given to him except for that of a Buddhist arhat, one who, inother words, was not reborn having reached enlightenment."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Figure 1Buddha flanked by skull tappers.

We have evidence that skull tappers wereknown by the first century .. Taddei argues that the story “is the reflection of theusual controversies between Buddhists and Brahmans,”10 and while he may becorrect, it appears to me that the Buddha actually accepts the effectiveness of skulltapping, in fact using it to prove that an arhat could, indeed, remove himself fromthe round of endless rebirths. In other words, the roots of Tantra are very old andprobably from the beginning predominantly nonsectarian, points made by severalof the authors in this book as well.The second reference in Gupta’s paper is to the v ̄ıra state (v ̄ıra is the Tantrichero of Muller-Ortega’s quotation above, an advanced Tantric practitioner).Gupta says that:Thev ̄ıra state is one that requires great moral effort and the courage toconfront endangering situations and steadfast pursuit of spiritual success(siddhi). One of the most grueling of the V ̄am ̄ac ̄ara ́S ̄akta practices per-formed by the v ̄ıra s ̄adhaka is the nilasadhana. On a special night, thes ̄adhaka must sit on a corpse in a deserted location such as a cremationground, riverbank, or pond and offer an oblation of consecrated flesh(mah ̄am ̄a ̧msa) to the fire deity. Through successful completion of the rite, hetranscends to the highest state where he/she is united with the deity.This, of course, brings us back to the beginning of the Introduction, to StellaKramrisch sitting on a corpse in Calcutta on orders from her Tantric guru. We donot know whether Kramrisch was united with ́Siva, or transcended to the higheststate. But it is difficult to argue that her action was somehow not “truly” Tantric. Itis a cautionary note, that whatever template we create for what is or is not Tantric,ultimately what a Tantric practitioner does is by one definition “Tantric.”NOTESNote: Standard diacritical marks are used for Sanskrit words.

Is not thisdifficulty due to the fact that we see and try to define an entity that does not reallyexist as such? Even if we do not go that far, even if we do not endorse H.V.Guenther’s remark that Tantrism is “probably one of the haziest notions andmisconceptions the Western mind has evolved,”2 the fact remains that Tantrism is,to a large extent, “a category of discourse in the West,” and not, strictly speaking,an Indian one. As a category, Tantrism is not—or at any rate was not until ourdays—an entity in the minds of those inside. It is a category in the minds ofobservers from outside. To use the fashionable jargon of today: it is an etic, not anemic, entity.The term Tantrism was coined by Western Indologists of the latter part ofthe nineteenth century whose knowledge of India was limited and who could notrealize the real nature, let alone the extent, of the Tantric phenomenon. Theybelieved that the practices and notions they discovered in Hindu and Buddhisttexts named Tantra (hence Tantrism) were something very particular, exceptional,and limited, contrasting sharply with the general, respectable, field of Indianphilosophy and religion, a particular domain one could easily circumscribe. Butwith the progress of studies in these fields one came to realize that, far from being alimited phenomenon, Tantrism was in fact something vast, diffuse, diverse andvery difficult to define satisfactorily. Mircea Eliade was perhaps the first to point itout, when he wrote in a book published in 1948 that, after the fifth century ..,Tantrism became a pervasive Indian “fashion” (une “mode” pan-indienne).3 Nei-ther in traditional India nor in Sanskrit texts is there a term for Tantrism; nodescription or definition of such a category is to be found anywhere. We know alsothat, more often than not, Tantric texts are not called Tantra.As evidence that Tantrism was not considered a particular philosophicalsystem, one may see that M ̄adhava’sSarvadar ́sanasa ̧mgraha, a fourteenth centurytext, does not mention Tantra as one of the fifteendar ́sanas (schools of worship) itdescribes, although this work dates to a time usually considered as that of thefullest expansion of Tantric notions and practices. There are, of course, Tantric"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"18Andr ́e Padouxelements in M ̄adhava’s description of the ́Saiva dar ́sana where he quotes from suchTantric authors as Utpaladeva or Abhinavagupta, but Tantra as such is not men-tioned. P.V. Kane explains this by saying that M ̄adhava deliberately ignored Tantrabecause it was too scandalous. But it is more likely that it was, by that time, sopervasive that it was not regarded as being a distinct system.The usual reference to the Indian use of the term t ̄antrika derives fromKull ̄uka Bha ̧t ̧ta’s formula when commenting on the M ̄anavadharma ́s ̄astra 2.1,where he juxtaposes vaidika/t ̄antrika as two forms of revelation ( ́sruti ́s ca dvidvidh ̄avaidik ̄ı t ̄antrik ̄ı ca) and, consequently, two different approaches to the ultimatereality (the first based formally on the Veda and the Brahmanic tradition and thesecond on other texts). The distinction has remained a basic one throughoutIndian thought, but without a particular category of “Tantrism” evolving.We may note here the use by Kull ̄uka of the term ́sruti. Even outside Tantriccircles, apparently, the Tantric tradition could be considered as ́sruti, that is, as arevelation valid in its own sphere. In fact, Kull ̄uka’s formula shows on the onehand that, even though there is no inside definition of Tantrism, Tantrism was atleast perceived by Indians outside it as different from the Vedic tradition. Itevidently was similarly perceived by those inside who deprecated Vedic rites andnotions. On the other hand, the quotation tends to show that the vaidika/t ̄antrikarelationship was not a clear-cut one since both could be called ́sruti. Such ambigu-ity, in fact, goes very far because Vedic and Tantric traditions, as time passed,tended to permeate each other in ritual, in concepts, and in scriptural references.Not only are elements from the Atharva Veda important in some local Tantrictraditions (in Orissa, for instance), but many Tantric authors quote freely from ́sruti. The assimilation went so far that, in Kashmir, some Va ̧ıs ̧nava T ̄antrikas ofthe P ̄a ̃ncaratra declared their scriptures to be the Vedic ́s ̄akh ̄a (school), theEk ̄anaya ́s ̄akh ̄a.Concerning the Indian textual use of the term t ̄antrika, we should also takenote of the fact that, in ́Saiva Tantric texts, t ̄antrika often is used instead of kaula torefer to the more exoteric texts and practices and as a way to distinguish from theesoterickaula ones. Thus, those texts and practices called Tantric are the lessTantric ones. India, it appears, far from providing us with a definition of Tantrismas something specific, rather accumulates evidence showing the interpenetration,in Hindu thought and practice, of Tantric and non-Tantric elements.A number of traits have been listed by authors writing on Tantrism as beingconstituent elements. Teun Goudriaan, for instance, in his Hindu Tantrism, listseighteen such traits as “some constituents of Tantrism (in its wider sense).”4 Thetrouble, however, with such lists is, first of all, that there is no consensus amongscholars about these elements and, second, that there are no groups or texts usuallyconsidered Tantric where all these elements are to be found; also, some, if notmost, of them can be found in non-Tantric contexts. This is not surprising because“Tantrism in its wider sense” is a hazy and ill-defined sort of notion; it can cover, in"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"19What Do We Mean by Tantrism?fact, so vast a field as to include almost all of Hinduism. Let us, however, examinesome of these traits, limiting ourselves to those I believe to be the most obvious.The first aspect to be examined, that is, a particular Tantric ideology, Ibelieve is important. I differ with those who consider Tantrism to be, in JeanFilliozat’s words, “merely the ritual and technical aspect of Hinduism.”5 This view,however, is not to be dismissed too hastily since ritual, when the technical aspect isadded to it, can go a long way toward characterizing Tantrism if you take it as ageneral Hindu phenomenon. Indeed, ritual may well provide one of the mostpractical, but surely minimal, overall definitions of Tantrism. I shall refer again tothis subject later on.The ideological aspect of the Tantric vision is the cosmos as permeated bypower (or powers), a vision wherein energy ( ́sakti) is both cosmic and human andwhere microcosm and macrocosm correspond and interact. The ideology is im-portant because it explains such Tantric features as the concept and practice ofku ̧n ̧dalin ̄ı, as well as a number of yogic and ritual practices for the use and controlof that power. It also explains some aspects of the speculations and practicesconcerning the power of the word (v ̄ac), especially the nature and power ofmantras, and so forth. This ideology not only colors, but orientates and organizes,and gives meaning to all Tantric practices and observances. Such an ideology isevident in the Bharirava Tantras, in those of K ̄al ̄ı, in such systems as the Kramaand the Trika (all of the ́Saiva or ́S ̄akta texts), in the esoteric Buddhist Yo g ̄anuttara-tantras and in the Sahajiy ̄a traditions. It is subdued, toned down, in other tradi-tions normally considered Tantric, such as the P ̄a ̃ncaratra, or ̄Agamic ́Saivasid-dh ̄anta. And, you would hardly find it among some dualist ́Saiva authors(Sadyojyoti, for instance) even though the mantras and rituals used by these adeptsare Tantric.On the other hand, micro-macrocosmic correspondences are found in an-cient, pre-Tantric texts; for example, they are fundamental in the Upani ̧sads. Themagical use of power is apparent in the Atharvaveda too and, later on, the Tantricvision permeated the Pur ̄a ̧nas and seeped into most of Hinduism. We must add thatthe ideology of power, with its aspect of violence and transgression, is essential to thecults of the feminine aspect of the divinity, cults that cannot always be considered asTantric. In south India, for instance, the cults of local goddesses are surely auto-chthonous Dravidian and originally pre-Tantric. The ancient Indian practices oftapas (internal heat) and mastery of sexual energy (v ̄ırya) for gaining supernaturalpowers also are examples of controlled uses of the power that are not Tantric.In all these non-Tantric domains, there are elements identical or akin tothose constituting the Tantric vision. We can say, therefore, that in the domain ofideology or doctrine, we find the same situation as in the case of the other Tantrictraits. Characteristics found clearly and fully in a few groups or in some texts onlyare found in a wide area. Furthermore, the origin or the seeds of many traits,ideological or otherwise, can be traced back to ancient, pre-Tantric, times."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"20Andr ́e PadouxAnother element generally considered characteristic or constituent of Tantr-ism is the use of means pertaining to this world for supramundane ends, be itmukti (liberation) or the lesser rewards or enjoyments classified as bhoga. There isthe attempt in Tantric traditions to achieve liberation and to gain supernaturalpowers, not by renunciation of all worldly desires or pleasures, but, to useMadeleine Biardeau’s words, “by harnessing desire—k ̄ama [desire] in all themeanings of that word and with all its related values—to the service of libera-tion,”6 a liberation that is usually j ̄ıvanmukti (liberation while living), a transcen-dental condition of unity with the deity—total freedom from the world, but alsotriumphal plentitude and demiurgic power.But liberation in a Tantric context is not necessarily j ̄ıvanmukti. Even insuch a completely Tantric work as Abhinavagupta’sTantr ̄aloka, the best and high-est adept, who benefits from the most intense grace of ́Siva (t ̄ıvra ́saktip ̄ata), isinstantly liberated and dies: a condition considered higher than j ̄ıvanmukti. Thetypical Tantric j ̄ıvanmukta, totally free of a world he dominates and transcends, isto be found in some Tantras only—for example, in the Bhairava or K ̄al ̄ı Tantras,in Sahajiy ̄a Vai ̧s ̧navism or in Buddhism too—that can be viewed as “hard core”Tantrism. In the more staid Saiddh ̄antika ̄Agamas where the term j ̄ıvanmuktiseldom occurs, the liberated adept acquires ́sivatva, the condition of ́Siva, a condi-tion of similarity (s ̄amant ̄a) with ́Siva, not one of total fusion (ekatva). Thispermits the liberated soul to go on loving God. It is evidently still more so in theP ̄a ̃ncaratra, where devotion (bhakti) is essential.Since I mention bhakti, I may note here that, gaining liberation while activein this world, being in this world but not of it, being entirely dedicated to God, isthe basic teaching of bhakti from the Bhagavad-G ̄ıt ̄a onward. Since, however, thelove of God and the essential role of God’s grace to gain liberation are insistedupon in such Tantric works as those of Abhinavagupta, where does bhakti end andTantra begin? There is a problematical relationship between Tantrism and bhakti.A particular Tantric way of making use of this world for supramundane endsis the ritual and soteriological use of things that are normally forbidden, that is, thetransgression of norms. The main reason for this antinomian behavior appears tobe the wish, by so doing, to participate in the dark, chaotic, undisciplined, andvery powerful forces that are normally repressed and kept outside the pure, orderly,circumscribed world of the Brahmin. This wish, incidentally, implies a belief in aworld pervaded by power, a power supposedly at its utmost in that outside world.Such transgressive practices include the transgressive ritual use of sex.The use of sex is not found in all Tantric traditions. It is not prevalent, butpresent nonetheless, in the ́Saiva and ́S ̄akta groups that have a K ̄ap ̄alika origin orbackground and that have kept, if only symbolically, the K ̄ap ̄alika culture of thecremation ground with its cult of the Yogin ̄ıs and its erotico-mystic rites andnotions. It is also found in Sahajiy ̄a circles, Hindu and Buddhist. But, all this isconspicuously absent from the less intensely Tantric traditions, whether ́Saiva or"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"21What Do We Mean by Tantrism?Va i ̧s ̧nava. Transgression is characteristic of “hard core” Tantrism only. On theother hand, transgression is a universal category of human behavior. In India it isolder than Tantrism, as proved, for instance, by the P ̄a ́supatas and L ̄akulas. Eroticrites and sexo-yogic practices surely antedate Tantra. Here again, we see elementseither not found in all Tantric groups or texts, or that exist outside Tantrism andhave existed before it. For instance, the conception of the body as a structuredreceptacle of power and animated by that power and the somato-cosmic visionupon which these practices are based are certainly pre-Tantric or extra-Tantric.The same thing can be said about most, if not of all, of the other elementsconsidered characteristic or constituent of Tantrism. The ubiquitous use of man-tras, for instance, together with all the notions concerning the power of the word(v ̄ac) and with the relevant practices (ny ̄asa, japa, mantras ̄adhana) is so typicallyTantric that mantra ́sastra is often taken as synonymous with tantra ́sastra; however,Tantric mantras are used in non-Tantric rites. Some Vai ̧s ̧nana Sa ̧mhitas, the ritualof which is Tantric, nevertheless, consider the Vedic mantras as higher than theTantric ones. In a similar fashion ritual diagrams (ma ̧n ̧dalas, yantras, cakras) orritual gestures (mudr ̄as) are to be found variously used in and outside Tantrism. Ifone looks at the Tantric ritual (p ̄uj ̄a or d ̄ık ̧s ̄a), one would notice some of theconstitiuent elements as deriving from groups outside Tantrism also. The sameapplies to another element considered typically Tantric, namely the polarization ofthe godhead into a male pole (usually higher, but inactive) and a female one( ́sakti), which is active but theologically lower except in some ́S ̄akta traditions.Such polarization is not stressed equally everywhere. The role of ́sakti is limitednot only in Vai ̧s ̧nava Sa ̧mhit ̄as, but in the Siddh ̄anta ́Saiv ̄agamas. There are,futhermore, ́Saiva pantheons that are either entirely male or entirely female.It is thus very difficult to gather traits that are both typically Tantric andfound in most Tantric traditions, but not found outside these traditions when welimit ourselves to Hinduism. The difficulty becomes even greater—indeed, itbecomes an impossibility—if we wish to include Tantric Buddhism as it de-veloped in India and spread to China, Tibet, or Japan.We could try to bypass the difficulty by choosing from among those constit-uent elements only a few that, when present in a text, in the practice or doctrine ofa given group, would suffice for us to declare that text or group as Tantric. But,which elements ought we to choose—ideological, ritual, or practical ones? Shouldwe limit those elements to observances (vrata) or cult ritual (Tantric p ̄uj ̄a)? Com-plicating the picture is that Tantric ritual is not always exclusive of a Vedicpractice. Several texts or authors prescribe or admit both types of ritual. A Vedicpublic behavior may hide a Tantric domestic or secret practice. Furthermore,within the same tradition there are levels of esotericism and exclusivism, there areprogressive, ascending levels of specificity (uttarottaravai ́si ̧s ̧tyam) and of “Tan-tricity.” Usually the more specific and esoteric the level of the Tantra, the moreTantric it is. It is clear that there are degrees in Tantrism."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"22Andr ́e PadouxA number of other elements could be adduced to show the uncertainty ofthe criteria we can use to define Tantrism, the diversity within Tantric traditionsand the problematic nature of the relationship of Tantrism with non-Tantric,“orthodox” Hinduism. On this last point, the judgment passed by each group onthe other goes from utter condemnation to the admission of the validity of theother’s scriptures within their own field and for their particular purpose. TheSarv ̄agamapram ̄a ̧nyav ̄ada, for instance, was upheld by such authors as Y ̄amu-n ̄ac ̄ arya. This being so, how can we concur on the definition of Tantrism?Like Hinduism, “Tantrism” is made up of a number of groups, traditions,and texts sharing some common elements, especially ritual ones, and having somecommon beliefs and notions; the total of these elements or beliefs somehowdifferentiate Tantric from non-Tantric Hinduism. Tantrism, however, includespractices or beliefs found in non-Tantric Hinduism too. Hence, we are faced withthe uncertainty of the limits of Tantrism, its elusive nature, and if we take itcomprehensively, its apparent pervasiveness. If it is pervasive, does it not loose itsidentity as something specific? If, therefore, we wish to keep the notion of Tantr-ism, we must take it as something specific and sufficiently distinguishable in spiteof its uncertain limits. If so, we can consider as Tantric those groups or texts onlywhere the main Tantric constituent elements previously mentioned are found.This would limit the category of Tantrism to a few groups of people or oftexts, mainly the ́Saiva- ́S ̄akta traditions with a K ̄ap ̄alika background, some of theN ̄atha, the Sahajiy ̄a Vai ̧s ̧navas, and, of course, the obvious Tantric forms of Ma-h ̄ay ̄ ana Buddhism. In such “hard core” Tantrism, we find a system of observances(often transgressive in nature) that are given meaning by a more or less power-oriented vision of man and the cosmos, a system where power is manipulated,where micro-macrocosmic correspondences play an essential role. Also, there isusually a high degree of esotericism (the higher, the more esoteric, the more“Tantric”) together with a particular type of pantheon (not necessarily sexuallydifferentiated however), and a particular and very developed type of ritual. Out-side these qualifications, there may exist a varying number and proportion ofTantric traits, but not Tantrism as such.With such a definition, could we include the P ̄a ̃ncar ̄atra? Possibly we couldinclude the P ̄a ̃ncar ̄atra of some of the older Sa ̧mhit ̄as and the Lak ̧smitantra, ofcourse, since it is heavily influenced by ́Saivism. Surely, we would not include theKashmiri P ̄a ̃ncar ̄atrins who insisted they were a Vedic ́s ̄akha, nor the more recentSr ̄ ıvai ̧s ̧navas. But how much of ́Saivism should we include apart from the Bhaira-v ̄agamas? Is the ̄Agamic ́Saivasiddh ̄anta really Tantric? Yes, it is, but mostly owingto its ritual aspect and because it is the Sam ̄anya ́s ̄astra of the followers of theBhairav ̄agamas. What about the modern “Vedantized” ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a of South Indiawhich traces its gurupara ̧mpara to ́Sa ̇ nkaracarya and whose Tantric conceptionsare so toned down in order to fit into orthodox Brahmin circles that it is hardlyTantric anymore?"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"23What Do We Mean by Tantrism?Another approach to Tantrism and to its definition might be to stress itsritual aspect without omitting entirely the ideological side, but subordinating it toritual. One would underline the particular and proliferating nature of the ritual,and its conjunction with speculations and practices concerning the power of theword (mantras, etc.). Ritual also involves the manipulation of power and a patternthat combines the assertion of the identity or fusion of worshiper and worshiped(n ̄adevo devam arcayet) together with an ensemble of offerings and obeisances(upac ̄ara) to the deity (or Buddhist entity), who is treated as an honored guest. It isimportant to stress that such rituals entail an intense inner participation—body,mind, and word—of the worshiper in the ritual he carries out. The main merit ofan essentially ritual approach to the definition of Tantrism is that it applies equallywell to Hindu and to Buddhist Tantrism and that it can apply not only to Indian-Himalayan-Tibetan, but to Chinese Buddhism also. Its drawback is that ritual isnot only that of the cult. It includes other aspects of the Tantric adept’s life andobservances. Furthermore, Tantric and non-Tantric rites are often not only per-formed by the same person (in different circumstances), but also sometimesduring the same ritual. We cannot, therefore, content ourselves with the ritualapproach to Tantrism.But are we not facing a sea of troubles simply because we want to definesomething that does not exist except in our minds? Having coined the termTantrism, we want it to mean something specific. Those in India or elsewhere,whose observances were Tantric, never used the term Tantrism nor did they givethe term Tantric the same meaning as we do. Some would not even describethemselves as t ̄antrika. They simply followed the beliefs and practices that werecurrent in their times in their own social groups. What were these? Simply theywere the various forms taken by Hinduism and Buddhism as they evolved over thecourse of centuries, mainly under the influence of the Indian, Tibetan, or Chinesespheres and/or by a process of internal transformation.Tantrism, thus, would be quite simply the various forms taken over thecourse of time by large sections of Hinduism or Buddhism. Depending upon thebackground, the origins, and the local influences, the evolution was more or lessmarked by a rejection of the orthodox Vedic rules and notions; it included more orless local autochthonous cults and beliefs, local religious behaviors, and magicaland/or other practices. All of this resulted in the more or less “Tantric” character ofthe different groups concerned. But, whatever the case, the variety of Tantra thatbaffles us might very well be nothing more than some of the ways in whichHinduism or Buddhism were actually understood, believed, and practiced byIndian, Tibetan, and Chinese practicioners during the last two millennia. Thesevarious religious forms we may decide to call Tantric in order to differentiate themfrom older or different forms of the same religions, but we ought not try to setthem apart as a particular religious entity that we choose to call Tantrism, an entitythat probably never existed as such."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"24Andr ́e PadouxWe would thus be rid of the difficult notion of Tantrism.

LorenzenThe history of early Tantric religion is not easy to write. Although manuscriptlibraries contain hundreds, even thousands of different Tantric texts, both Hinduand Buddhist, no manuscript bearing a date before the mid-ninth century hasbeen found, a date long after the initial rise of this movement. Relevant contempo-rary inscriptions, a key element in any chronological and geographical reconstruc-tion of the early stages of Tantric religion, are unfortunately very few in number.Another problem is that the range of phenomena covered by the term “Tantricreligion” has been subject to different interpretations. In spite of all this, muchheadway has already been made in overcoming these problems and, today, scholarscan speak with some assurance about at least the broad outlines of the early historyof the movement. The present essay attempts to give an overview of the conclu-sions historians have so far reached in this field.1The first problem is that of definition. Does the term “Tantric religion”cover only those cults directly associated with the Sanskrit texts known as Tantras,Sa ̧mhit ̄as and ̄Agamas, or does it also include a wide range of “popular” religiousphenomena that can be broadly classified as being “magical” in character? Are thetexts and followers of Ha ̧tha Yoga tradition, especially the N ̄atha or K ̄anapha ̧t ̄ayog ̄ıs, to be considered as Tantric? Are all, or nearly all, of the Hindu and Buddhistreligious traditions dedicated to female deities Tantric?2Differences of opinion about these questions exist for the simple reason thattwo different definitions of Tantric religion are possible and indeed both are used.A narrow definition considers as Tantric only religious phenomena directly associ-ated with the Tantras, Sa ̧mhit ̄as and ̄Agamas. Since these texts are almost allwritten in Sanskrit, it can be assumed that the social base of Tantric religionnarrowly defined in this way has been mostly literate, upper caste, and resident inor near towns and cities.A wide definition of Tantric religion adds to the religion based on theseSanskrit texts an ample range of popular “magical” beliefs and practices includingmuch of ́S ̄akta and Ha ̧tha Yoga traditions. To the extent that these popularreligions are literate, many of their texts are written in vernacular languages. Themain social base of this more widely defined Tantric religion can be assumed to"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"26David N. Lorenzenhave been less well-educated, lower caste, and generally more rural than its moreSanskritic counterpart.In this essay I will accept a wide definition of Tantric religion, but this dualcharacter of the movement remains a significant problem. Stated somewhatdifferently, there is a clear sense that the more elitist and Sanskritized manifesta-tions of Tantric religion are more Tantric than those that are more popular andmagical in character.Even if we use a wide definition of Tantric religion, however, the epigraphicevidence for its existence is quite limited. This makes a close determination of itsgeographic spread and its historical chronology quite difficult. As for geography,we know that Tantric religion was primarily a northern phenomena, although italso had some following in parts of the South. Its chief centers of influence havebeen eastern north India (Bihar, Bengal, and Assam), Kashmir, Nepal, and Tibet,and perhaps the Punjab and Rajasthan (depending in part on whether one countsthe N ̄ath tradition as Tantric). As for chronology, the earliest clear and datableevidence of full-blown Tantric religion appears in four literary texts written inSanskrit of the seventh century ..: B ̄a ̧nabha ̧t ̧ta’sK ̄adambar ̄ı and Har ̧sacartita,Mahendravarman’sMattavil ̄asa, and Da ̧n ̧din’sDa ́sakum ̄aracarita. The survivingTantric texts themselves seem to nearly all date from a slightly or considerably laterperiod, from approximately the eighth to the eighteenth centuries.These two facts—the northern and medieval provenance of Tantrictradition—make the recovery of its history particularly difficult since the northernregion was under the direct control of the Muslim rulers from about the beginningof the twelfth century. With the curious exception of the patronage given byseveral of the Mughal emperors, including both Akbar and Aurangzeb, to the N ̄athyogis of Jakhbar in the Punjab,3 none of the Muslim rulers of India is known tohave been a supporter of Tantric religious cults. An unknown number of Tantriccenters, most notably the Buddhist monastaries at Nalanda and Vikramasila, weremost probably destroyed by Mulsim armies. In any case, royal patronage for allnon-Muslim religions, except at the level of minor vassals and zamindars (landowners), evidently mostly dried up in the regions dominated by Muslim overlords.For most of the period from 1200 to 1800 .., this included most of the Indiansubcontinent.4A third major problem concerns the nature of the social institutions ofTantric religion. Surviving early epigraphs relating to religious institutions almostall register donations of land and/or money and other goods and services totemples, monasteries, and Brahmin agrah ̄ara (landgrant) villages. It is known thatmany Tantric ascetics organized themselves into “sects,” “orders,” or “preceptoriallines” such as those of the Kaulas, K ̄ap ̄alikas, and N ̄aths. It also seems to be thecase that only a few of these sects and orders established large temples or monas-teries. There has always been something secretive, individualistic, and counter-cultural about Tantric religion, rather like Gnostic Christianity in Europe andNorth Africa, and this has tended to discourage the creation of Tantric temples"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"27Early Evidence for Tantric Religionand monasteries, although Buddhist monasteries under Tantric influence such asthose at Nalanda and Vikramasila, not to mention many in Nepal and Tibet,represent an obvious exception to this rule.Most of the sources that document the early stages of Tantric religion arereasonably well known. The discussion that follows will represent a didactic reviewof these sources, treating separately each of the different constituent componentsof the wide and loosely organized complex that comes to be known as “Tantricreligion.” This procedure should clearly illustrate that while some components arequite ancient, the complex as a whole cannot be documented before the fifth orsixth centuries .. The existence of a specific Hindu Tantric sect, that of theK ̄ap ̄ alikas, is also first documented about that time. By about the seventh century,Tantric Buddhism seems to have been flourishing in several monasteries of Bihar.The basic categories of documentation, each relating to a major component ofbroadly defined Tantric religion, can be conveniently arranged as follows: (1)sources relating to shamanic and yogic beliefs and practices; (2) those relating to ́S ̄akta worship, especially worship of the M ̄at ̧rk ̄ as and demon-killing forms ofHindu and Buddhist goddesses; (3) those relating to specific schools of Tantricreligion such as the K ̄ap ̄alikas and Kaulas; (4) the Tantric texts themselves. When-ever possible, emphasis will be given to epigraphic documentation.The earliest sources relating to shamanic and yogic beliefs and practices inIndia are mostly literary and are ancient, abundant, and widespread. This is hardlysurprising since such beliefs and practices—those that aim at control over themind, the body, and the physical world—are a virtual universal of human be-havior. The most striking early evidence for shamanic-yogic practices in India isfound in the famous “wildmuni” (seer) hymn of the ̧Rg Veda (10.136), probablydating from about the beginning of the first millennium before the Common Era.In this hymn, the munis are described as having ecstatic, altered states of con-sciousness and also the magical ability to fly on the wind.What is perhaps more surprising than the evidence of this Vedic hymn,however, is the quite early development of a systematized set of yogic beliefs andpractices that eventually became codified in the classical Yoga-s ̄utras of Pata ̃njal ̄ıand in later Ha ̧tha Yoga texts such as the Ha ̧tha Yoga Prad ̄ıpik ̄a of Sv ̄atmar ̄ama.These beliefs and practices are already clearly in evidence in the Ch ̄andogyaUpani ̧sad (8.6.6) and the ́Svet ̄a ́svatara Upani ̧s ̄ad (2.8–13), texts dating respectivelyfrom about the early and middle first millennium before the Common Era. TheCh ̄andogya refers to the mystical anatomy of n ̄a ̧d ̄ıs (veins or nerves), while the ́Svet ̄a ́svatara describes the basic meditative posture and techniques of sense andbreath control. These beliefs and practices were expounded in more systematicform in Pata ̃njal ̄ı’sYoga-s ̄utras, possibly about the beginning of the Common Era.Although Pata ̃njal ̄ı’s text is not usually considered to be Tantric in character,the transition to the more Tantric Ha ̧tha Yoga involves more a shift in emphasisthan a basic change in the nature of yogic beliefs and practices. Specifically, Ha ̧thaYoga emphasizes the development of the psychic control over the natural processes"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"28David N. Lorenzenof aging and death (already a significant aim of Yoga in the Yoga-s ̄utras and theBhagavad-g ̄ıt ̄a), control over the sexual organs through such practices as the vajrol ̄ımudr ̄a (retention of bodily fluids), and the interior visualization of and controlover the mystical anatomy of n ̄a ̧d ̄ıs and cakras. This control over the mysticalanatomy is also thought to lead to knowledge of and control over themicrocosmic-macrocosmic links between this anatomy and the external world ofnature. This in turn leads to the acquisition of the supernatural powers known(siddhis). Ha ̧tha Yoga adepts also invoke the supposed magical power of sacred oralformulas (mantras) and sacred diagrams (yantras and ma ̧n ̧dalas). Even these for-mulas and diagrams, however, have a history going back to Vedic times.This shamanic-yogic component of Tantrism first appears in a more clearlyTantric form in the seventh century texts of B ̄a ̧nabha ̧t ̧ta and Da ̧n ̧din. In B ̄a ̧na’sHar ̧sacarita, a “great ́Saiva” (mah ̄a ́saiva) ascetic from the southern Deccan namedBhairav ̄ac ̄arya is said to have befriended Har ̧sa’s ancestor Pu ̧spabh ̄uti. Pu ̧spabh ̄utiassists Bhairav ̄ac ̄arya in the realization of a powerful spell (mah ̄amantra) called theMah ̄ak ̄alah ̧rdaya. The object of the spell is to subdue a zombie (vet ̄ala). Bhaira-v ̄ac ̄ arya is said to reside near an old temple of the Mothers (m ̄at ̧rs). The ceremonyitself takes place at “an empty building near a great cremation ground on thefourteenth night of the dark fortnight” and involves the celebration of a fire rite inthe mouth of a corpse. B ̄a ̧na’s portrait of a Tantric ascetic from southern India inK ̄adambar ̄ı is more comic in tone but similar in content. Da ̧n ̧din’sDa ́sakum ̄aracarita, on the other hand, describes its Tantric ascetic as an evil siddha(one with supranormal powers). Another seventh century text, Mahendravarman’sMattavil ̄asa features a Tantric K ̄ap ̄alika ascetic, but he is portrayed more as ahedonistic clown than as a shamanic yogi. After the seventh century, Tantricascetics are frequently mentioned in Sanskrit literature.5A second major component of Tantric religion is the worship of femaledeities, particularly those who manifest a fierce character. Like the shamanic-yogiccomponent of Tantrism, the worship of female deities has a long history in Indiaand may be regarded as a near universal characteristic of human societies. TheVedic antecedents of goddess worship appear in a series of hymns dedicated to thegoddess of the dawn, U ̧sas, and a number of hymns dedicated in whole or part toriver goddesses, to the goddess of speech, V ̄ac, or to other minor female deities.None of these hymns, however, negates the obvious fact that Vedic religion isdecidedly patriarchal in character. Early hymns to the Great Goddess, the Goddessof whom all individual goddesses are merely forms or aspects, are found in theMah ̄abh ̄arata and Hariva ̧m ́sa, the Dev ̄ı M ̄ah ̄atmya section of the M ̄arka ̧n ̧deyaPur ̄a ̧na, the Ca ̧n ̧di- ́sataka attributed (probably falsely) to B ̄a ̧nabha ̧t ̧ta, and theGa ̄u ̧davaho of V ̄akpati.6 All these texts refer to the fierce, demon-killing forms ofthe Goddess, most prominently the form named Mahi ̧samardin ̄ı, the destroyer ofthe buffalo demon Mahi ̧sa. The battle between this Goddess, often identified as aform of Durg ̄a-P ̄arvati, and Mahi ́sa is mentioned in all these sources (except"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"29Early Evidence for Tantric Religionperhaps the Hariva ̧m ́sa) and is recounted in detail in the Dev ̄ı M ̄ah ̄atmya and theCa ̧n ̧di- ́sataka.Sculptural representations of Mahi ́samardin ̄ı have been found that date tothe Gupta period 7 and the earlier Kushan period.8 The earliest epigraphic men-tion of this goddess is probably that found in a late sixth century .. NagarjuniHill (Gaya District) cave inscription of Anatavarman of the Maukhari Dynasty.May the Devi’s foot, its gleaming nails emitting a mass of rays, point the wayto the abode of riches. Her foot challenges with its splendor the full beautyof a blossomed lotus. With its twinkling anklet it contemptuously rests onthe head of Mahi ̧s ̄asura. It rewards your condition as petitioner that suits theexpression of firm devotion.9The same inscription mentions Katyayani and Bh ̄avan ̄ı as the alternate names ofthis same Great Goddess. This inscription and the hymns to the Great Goddess inthe above-mentioned texts illustrate the relatively early development of mature ́S ̄akta religion and its increasing association with fierce, demon-killing forms of theGoddess, forms that can said to be Tantric-flavored, if not necessarily fully Tantric.Goddess worship seems to have become more definitely Tantric in characterin connection with the rise of a group of seven (or more) goddesses known asmothers or M ̄at ̧rk ̄ as. They are mentioned in the Mah ̄abh ̄arata as well as earlyPuranic literature, B ̧rhatsa ̧mhit ̄a and other relatively ancient texts. In B ̄a ̧nabha ̧t ̧ta’sHar ̧sacarita, the Tantric ascetic Bhairav ̄ac ̄arya is said to stay near an old templededicated to the M ̄at ̧rk ̄ as. Bh ̄asa’sC ̄arudatta, ́S ̄udraka’sM ̧rcchaka ̧tika, andB ̄a ̧nabha ̧t ̧ta’sK ̄adambar ̄ı also refer to these goddesses especially in connection withofferings made at crossroads.10In the present text, however, more important is a reference to these god-desses in the stone inscription of Vi ́svavarman, found at Gangadhar in Rajasthanand dated in 423 ..11 This is often identified as the earliest epigraphic evidencefor Tantric religion.12 Two other important early epigraphic references to thesegoddesses appear in the Bihar stone pillar inscription of Skanda Gupta or P ̄uruGupta (fifth century ..)13 and the rock inscription of Sv ̄amibha ̧ta (sixth century.. ?) from Deogarh in Jhansi District.14 The M ̄at ̧rk ̄ as are also regularly invokedin the preambles of the inscriptions of the Kadambas and Early Calukyas from themid-fifth century onward.15The description of the M ̄at ̧rk ̄ as found in the Gangadhar inscription meritssome discussion. The passage that refers to them in this record has been given asomewhat different interpretation by J. F. Fleet16 and by A. L. Basham.17 Versetwenty-three states:For the sake of religious merit, the king’s minister had them construct thisterrifying home of the Mothers, filled full of female demons ( ̧d ̄akin ̄ı) . . ."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"30David N. Lorenzenthese Mothers impel the great booming of the rain clouds and rouse theocean with the mighty wind that arises from the Tantras.18In this passage from the Gangadhar inscription, the words ̧d ̄akin ̄ı and tantraboth clearly suggest an association with Tantric religion. According to Monier-Williams, the ̧d ̄akin ̄ıs are said to feed on human flesh. It is, I think, quite probablethat the word tantra here refers to the Tantras themselves, but, as Basham pointsout,19 the word has several other meanings including “a drug” and “a spell(mantra).” One must reluctantly agree with Basham that here “we must leave thequestion [of the meaning of the word tantra] open, recognizing that this inscrip-tion gives no proof of the existence of a developed literature of Tantrism in thefifth century ..”20The classic description of the M ̄at ̧rk ̄ as is found in the Dev ̄ı M ̄ah ̄atmya, a texttraditionally included as a part of the M ̄arka ̧n ̧deya Pur ̄a ̧na.21 It is generally ac-cepted as the earliest and most important text of ́S ̄akta religion. Most portions ofthis text can be said with some confidence to have been written “before the close ofthe sixth century ..”22 The text describes the M ̄at ̧rk ̄ as as being created from the“energies” ( ́saktis) of the gods Brahma, ́Siva, Skanda, Visnu (the ́saktis Va i ̧s ̧nav ̄ı,V ̄ar ̄ah ̄ı, and N ̄arasi ̧mh ̄ı) Indra, and Ca ̧n ̧dika in order to help the Goddess destroythe armies of the demons Sumbha and Nisumba.23An interesting Kalacuri inscription from Pujaripali, near Sarangarh, Chhat-tisgarh, praises several of these and other demon-killing goddesses in verses thatare evidently directly inspired by the Dev ̄ı M ̄ah ̄atmya. The inscription is datedeither in about 1150 .. or in 1088 .. It clearly shows that, by this time, theDev ̄ı M ̄ah ̄atmya was accepted as a basic source of ́S ̄akta religion.The early evidence for the existence of specific sects and vows of Tantricreligion pertains mostly to the K ̄ap ̄alikas, sometimes identified as Somasiddh ̄atinsor Mah ̄avratins. They are first mentioned in several literary sources includingdubious references in the Maitr ̄aya ̧n ̄ıya Upani ̧sad and the Ya j ̃navalkya sm ̧rti and amore credible reference in Hala’sG ̄atha-saptasat ̄ı (third to fifth century ..) and intwo texts of the astronomer-mathematician Var ̄ahamihira (c. 500–575..).Starting with Mahendravaman’s early seventh century farce, the Mattavil ̄asa, liter-ary references to K ̄ap ̄alikas become quite common.24 As far as epigraphs areconcerned, there are in fact only three or four that have been clearly identified asregistering donations to or from K ̄ap ̄alika ascetics. These are the following: (1) anIgatpuri (Nasik district) copper plate inscription of the early C ̄alukya kingN ̄agavardhana (seventh century ..) that registers a donation to a K ̄ap ̄ale ́svaratemple and the Mah ̄avratin ascetics residing in it; (2) a Tilakwada (Baroda District)copper plate inscription (1047 ..) of a subordinate of the Par ̄amara king Bhojathat registers a donation to “themuni Dinkara, a Mah ̄avrata-dhara who was like theK ̄ap ̄alin ́Sa ̇ nkara in bodily form”; (3) the Kalanupaka (Nalgonda District, A.P.)inscription 1050 .. that registers a land grant made by a K ̄ap ̄alika ascetic namedSomibha ̧t ̧t ̄araka to an individual named Ca ̧n ̧damayya; and (4) a sixth century .."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"31Early Evidence for Tantric Religioninscription from Bangalore District that registers a land grant by a king Durvin ̄ıta toa Brahman named K ̄ap ̄ali ́sarman (who may or may not be K ̄ap ̄alika). In addition, aclear reference to a Somasiddh ̄antin ascetic named V ̄agi ́sa Bha ̧t ̧ta is found in a 1171.. inscription from Tiruvorriyur (Chingleput District, Tamilnadu).25The 1050 .. inscription of the K ̄ap ̄alika Somibha ̧t ̧taraka is particularlyimportant since it includes a physical description of this ascetic and his vestmentsthat agrees remarkably well with the descriptions of the K ̄ap ̄alika vestments intexts by the Vai ̧s ̧nava theologians Y ̄amun ̄ac ̄arya and R ̄am ̄anuja, even to commonuse of the term ̧sa ̧nmudr ̄a (six insignia) to identify the key items.26 The same twotheologians also identify the K ̄al ̄amukhas as being Tantric ascetics, but this at-tribution of a Tantric character to them was probably willfully mistaken.27 Thenumerous inscriptions registering donations to K ̄al ̄amukha ascetics and templesclearly show them to belong to a non-Tantric South Indian sect descended fromthe P ̄a ́supatas. Whatever the case may be, the earliest epigraphs refer to theK ̄al ̄ amukhas, dated 806 and 810 .., were found at Nandi Hill in Kolar Districtat Karnataka.28 Another early record, the undated Tandikonda grant of the easternC ̄alukya king Ammaraja II (946–970..), registers a donation to a group ofK ̄al ̄ amukhas located at a temple at Vijayawada (Bezwada) about sixty miles fromthe mouth of the Krishna River. Also worth mentioning is a short inscriptionfound at Anaji in Dharwar District that records a gift of land to a temple con-nected with the K ̄al ̄amukha ́S ̄akti-p ̄ari ̧sad.29Epigraphic references to other Tantric sects such as the Kaulas are appar-ently quite rare, but systematic research on this question remains to be done. MarkDyczkowski has, however, made considerable progress in sorting out the Kaulaaffiliation of many Tantric texts.30 Also relevant in this context is a Cambodianinscription of about 1052 .. that tells how “king Jayavarman II’s court priest ́Sivalakaivalya at the beginning of the ninth century (.. 802?) installed a royalcult based upon the four Tantric books brought from elsewhere . . . The texts inquestion are the ́Sira ́scheda, Nayottara, Sammohana, and V ̄ı ̧n ̄a ́sikha.”31 Althoughthese texts may not be specifically Kaula, they belong to the tradition of v ̄ama (left)Tantras, some of which are associated directly with the Kaulas.When we turn to the earliest evidence for the existence of Tantric Bud-dhism, we find that this consists primarily of sculptures of fierce deities such asTrailokyavijaya, Cu ̧n ̧da, and Sa ̧mvara and of sexually engaged (yuganaddha) maleand female deities.32 The principal monasteries where such Tantric sculptureshave been found are those at Nalanda in Patna District, at Antichak in BhagaipurDistrict (often identified with ancient Vikramasila), at Paharpur in RajshahiDistrict, and in other sites in the northeastern region.33 Nalanda seems to be theoldest of these monastic sites. Its foundation has been dated to the mid-fifthcentury .. It is unclear, however, whether the Tantric images found at this sitebelong to the earliest stages of its development.34Finally, we come to the question of the dates of the earliest specificallyTantric texts, especially the Tantras, Sa ̧mhit ̄as, and ̄Agamas belonging to different"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"32David N. LorenzenTantric sects or schools. Apart from the somewhat dubious reference to tantra inthe Gangadhar inscription of 423 .., the earliest clear reference to Tantric textsseems to occur in B ̄a ̧nabha ̧t ̧ta’sK ̄adambar ̄ı. In his description of a South IndianTantric ascetic, B ̄a ̧nabha ̧t ̧ta says that “he had made a collection of manuscripts ofjugglery, Tantras, and mantras (which were written) in letters of red lac on palmleaves (tinged with) smoke.”35According to D. C. Sircar,36 Buddhist tradition claims that “Padmavajra,author of the Hevajra Tantra, was the preceptor of Anagavajra, a son of kingGop ̄ala who founded the P ̄ala dynasty in Bengal about the middle of the eighthcentury ..” Sircar also notes that some scholars date the composition of this textas early as “shortly before 693 ..” D. L. Snellgrove similarly estimates that “theHevajra-Tantra [was] existing in its present form towards the end of the eightcentury.”37 On the other hand, Alex Wayman has ascribed another early BuddhistTantra, the Guhyasam ̄ajatantra,“on a purely tentative basis, . . . to the fourthcentury ..”38 His reason for suggesting this early date does not bear scrutiny.Hindu Tantrism is probably slightly older than its Buddhist counterpart,but early Hindu Tantras cannot be dated with any precision. Some earlier P ̄a ̃n-caratra texts, insofar as these are Tantric in character, may date from the fifthcentury .., but these dates are highly speculative.39 Much the same commentscan be made about the ́Saiva ̄Agamas preserved mostly in southern India.40Goudriaan claims that the oldest surviving Tantric manuscript known, acopy of the P ̄arame ́svaramata, bears a ninth century date equivalent to 858 or 859..41 He also notes, however, that the mention of many other Tantric texts “asvenerable authorities” in Abhinavagupta’s great Tantr ̄aloka, written sometimearound 1000 ..,“renders it at least probable that Tantric literature existedalready two or more centuries before....”42In terms of its philosophical sophistication, Kashmiri ́Saiva tradition repre-sents the richest development of Tantric literature. In recent years there has been averitable flood of scholarly publications in this field.43 Its greatest traditionalscholar, Abhinavagupta, wrote such Tantric works as Tantr ̄aloka, Tantr ̄asara andPar ̄atri ̧msik ̄avivara ̧na in about the early middle part of the eleventh century.44 Afair amount about the earlier history of Kashmiri ́Saivism is known, above all fromthe discussions of Abhinavagupta’sTantr ̄aloka. Nonetheless, few if any of theearlier sources, except for some of the ́Saiva ̄Agamas themselves can be dated beforethe eighth or ninth centuries.One interesting Buddhist Tantric school is represented by the BuddhistSiddha authors of the Cary ̄ag ̄ıtiko ̧sa, a collection of religious songs written in alanguage most scholars regard as an early form of Bengali. These songs, in factrepresent the oldest examples of Tantric literature written in an early form of amodern vernacular language. D. L. Snellgrove45 and Per Kvaerne46 place most ofthese songs in about the eleventh century.

None can besafely dated before the tenth century .., however, the legendary founders of thesect, Gorakhn ̄ath and his teacher Matsyendra, probably did not live much earlierthan a century or two before this date.49 It is notable, however, that this traditionspread throughout India in the medieval period, including even in the Southwhere it is represented by the Tamil Siddhas. Basing himself on Zvelebil,50Goudriaan claims that: “the oldest Tamil Siddha, Tirumular, perhaps flourished inthe seventh century ..; the apogee of the Tamil Siddha literature, however, lastedfrom the tenth to the fifteenth century.”51The N ̄ath tradition seems to have historical connections with the earlierK ̄ap ̄alikas,52 but this is too poorly documented to be of much help in dating thebeginnings of N ̄ath tradition. The main influence of this tradition was in northernIndia during the later medieval period. During the early nineteenth century itbecame a virtual state religion in the kingdom of M ̄an Singh in Jodhpur, Ra-jasthan.53 It also had a strong historical influence on the devotional V ̄arakar ̄ıtradition of Maharashtra (through the preceptorial line of J ̃nane ́svar), and laterKab ̄ır, Raid ̄as, Gur ̄u, N ̄anak, D ̄ad ̄u and others.In summary, it can be said that Tantric religion as a recognizable complex ofbeliefs and practices is first documented, in very sketchy fashion, in the fifthcentury .. and relatively rapidly increased its influence in succeeding centurieswithin both Hinduism and Buddhism. It became particularly strong in NorthIndia (excepting perhaps the state of Uttar Pradesh, but including Bangladesh andparts of Pakistan), in Nepal and Tibet, and in parts of southern India. By the ninthor tenth centuries, Tantric religion, both Hindu and Buddhist, had become ex-tremely influential, perhaps even dominant, in many of these areas.Buddhist Tantrism together with other forms of Buddhism, died out inIndia by the late twelfth and thirteenth centuries. It has survived in Nepal andTibet but has lost influence in Tibet since Chinese occupation and the introduc-tion of modern secular education. Hindu Tantrism remained popular during allthe medieval period, but it seems to have lost most of its popular and intellectualsupport during the nineteenth century, largely as a result of the efforts of Indianreformers, both liberals and conservatives, to “purify” Hindu tradition. Non-ethelss, Tantrism continued to have an active presence in at least the Benaresregion until the early decades of the twentieth century.54 Today it no longer existsas a significant organized force in India or other countries (with the possibleexceptions of Bali, Bhutan, Tibet, and Nepal). Nonetheless, many of its beliefs andpractices are now well-integrated within more mainstream Hinduism and Bud-dhism. In at least this assimilated form, Tantric religion remains alive and well."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"34David N. LorenzenNOTES1.

C. JoshiThe Sanskrit term tantra derives from the verb tan meaning to expand, and thus, itliterally denotes anything that can be stretched or extended like threads on aloom.1 In its developed form, Tantra refers to a complex of cultic practices, rituals,mysticism, and secret rites that are based on a philosophy and deep spiritualdevotion centering on the concept of Supreme Power. That power, called ́S ̄akti,has diverse manifestations. According to traditional beliefs, the Tantras, whetherassociated with ́S ̄aktism or other sectarian orders of Indian origin, evolved inremote antiquity and were interwoven with an intricate mythology. Assessment ofthe available data, both literary and archaeological, provides information on theorigin and growth of ́S ̄akta Tantrism and other similar systems. ́S ̄akta Tantrism hasits roots in prehistoric concepts of a fertile mother goddess and ancient systems forher worship. Scores of her representations dating to the Upper Paleolithic, if notearlier, attest to her primary importance in India’s most ancient culture.The earliest example of an Indian mother goddess figurine dates to theUpper Paleolithic. Found in the Belan Valley near Allahabad in Uttar Pradesh bythe late G. R. Sharma, the image is made of bone and is carved in the round; inshape it resembles a harpoon. On the basis of carbon 14 determinations, it hasbeen dated between 23,840 (plus or minus 830 years) B.C. E. and 17,765 (plus orminus 340 years).2 Also dating to the Upper Paleolithic are colorful stones markedwith natural triangles. Sharma found the first of these stones resting on an area ofraised ground at Baghor in Son Valley, near Mirzapur in Uttar Pradesh. Accordingto Sharma, several similar stones now have been found in that same area; theypresently are under worship as Argarimai or Mother-Fire.3 These stones withtriangles, Sharma claims, are related to a primitive mother goddess. They also maydemonstrate connections to the later Tantric use of yantras in which trianglesmanifest a vital symbolism connected with fertility. While we have no specificcomments to offer on Sharma’s hypothesis, it should be noted that it is difficult totrace a direct link between the archaeological evidence from Belan and Baghor andthose goddess figurines that have been found in later Neolithic and Chalcolithicexcavations."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"40M. C. JoshiOf the interesting Mother Goddess figurines brought to light in recenttimes in Pakistan mention should be made of specimens found at Sheri KhanTarakai in the Bannu District and Mehargarh-Nausharo. The former site, datedbetween 4500 and 3000 ... by the excavators, has yielded several femalefigurines, both plain and painted; the various examples can be placed into threebroad classes: (1) examples with a pinched nose and wearing a headdress withcurled horns; (2) examples with a black spot showing affiliations with a snakegoddess; (3) examples showing exaggerated genitalia. Of the three groups, themost significant is the third, in which figurines with one enlarged female organhave traces of a male genital above. Excavators have identified this rare type asbeing hermaphroditic.4 Related to this group is a protohistoric female fertilityfigure from Periano Ghundai, Pakistan, in which only the lower half is markedwith a yoni.Most of the protohistoric Mother Goddess figurines are executed in a primi-tive style with conventionalized features; those found at Harappa and Nausharo inPakistan, however, are somewhat more refined.5 Mother Goddess figures fromHarappa and Mohenjo Daro demonstrate a variety of styles; the diversity mayindicate the existence of different craft or religious traditions in Harappan culture.Two Harappan sites in India, Lothal in Gujarat and Banawali in Haryana, haveyielded Goddess images that may indicate religious diversity in the Harappanpopulation of the subcontinent as well. Representation of female deities on theIndus seals and sealings include indications of rituals involving animal sacrifice.Cultic forms of a fertility goddess appear on seals showing a female figure standingin the branches of the pipal tree. It is likely that the Mother Goddesses representedin terra-cotta and the female deities carved on seals represented two types of beliefspertaining to worship of goddesses in at least two levels of the society that werelocated in the same settlement; in other words, an authoritarian class and acommon class may have had two distinct modes of worship. Given our currentknowledge, we are unable to understand fully the position of a Mother Goddess asa fertility deity or, for that matter, the role of other female divinities in the religiousfabric of the protohistoric societies of India. It is uncertain if the Harappanpopulation had any idea of a single supreme Goddess with or without a malecounterpart or if they were governed by magician-priests or even if they had ahighly developed religion.6From the later Chalcolithic culture, a tiny clay figurine of a headless goddessis worthy of mention. Found in a small container at Ingamgaon in Maharashtra,the image was buried under the floor of a house (1300 ... to 1000 ...).7 Theheadless figures has a parallel in the medieval form of the Tantric Devi known asChinnamasta.The oldest literary works in India, the Vedas, preserve some interestingelements of ́S ̄akta Tantrism. Of the Vedic female divinities, the most significant forthe historical development of ́S ̄aktism are Aditi (Universal Mother), U ̧sa (Dawn),R ̄atr ̄ı (Night), Sarasvat ̄ı (Supreme Mother and the River), V ̄ac (Speech), and"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"41Historical and Iconographic Aspects of ́S ̄akta TantrismP ̧rthiv ̄ı (Earth) who together with Dyaus (Sky) represented the elements of univer-sal parenthood as did ́S ̄akti and ́Siva of later times. Sarasvat ̄ı also is called Bh ̄arat ̄ı, aname that later became a synonym for language and speech.Important to the growth of ́S ̄aktism was the Vedic V ̄ac who represented thefirst perception of infinite, incomprehensible and invisible Energy in the form ofsound. In fact, V ̄ac had four stages—the subtle state called Par ̄a V ̄ac, the internalvibrant stage called Pa ́ syant ̄ı, the more developed vibrant form called Madhyam ̄aV ̄ac, and the externally audible sound called Vaikhar ̄ı. Par ̄a and Pa ́ syant ̄ı repre-sented the higher stages of perception; but, according to tradition, the realizationofmantras as divine words was possible only in the state of Madhyam ̄a V ̄ac. Thus,in the Atharva Veda (19–71–1), V ̄ac was called Veda M ̄at ̄a or the Mother of theVedas (Stut ̄amay ̄a sahit ̄a Vedam ̄at ̄a). Similarly, the later Tantras call the Goddess ́Sabd ̄an ̄am Janan ̄ı, that is, Creator of Words.8 In our search for the roots of ́S ̄aktism, we cite the important Vedic hymn called the V ̄agambh ̧rni S ̄ukta from the ̧Rg Veda (10.125). The hymn, was composed by V ̄ac, the daughter of the sageAmbh ̧rna. In the hymn, V ̄ac refers to herself as the female energy that is SupremePower, the upholder of sovereignty and the controller of various deities such asVasu, Soma, Tvast ̄a, the Rudras, and the ̄Adityas. She also is called a source oftreasures, sustainer of nature’s forces, and bestower of favors. Without doubt, thehymn preserves a strong elements of monotheistic thought that forms the verybasis of historical ́S ̄aktism.Important among the later Vedic female deities is ́Sr ̄ ı Lak ́sm ̄ı or ́Sr ̄ ım ̄a whois mentioned for the first time in the ́Sr ̄ ı S ̄ukta, a supplementary hymn in the ̧RgVeda. As the goddess of prosperity, wealth, fortune, and vegetation, she is identi-fied as a golden doe (hira ̧nyavar ̧n ̄a ̧m hari ̧n ̄ı ̧m) decked with gold and silver threads,as a column of pleasant golden light-bearing lotus garlands; she is a royal divinityseated within a golden enclosure who derives joy from the presence of trumpetingelephants (hastin ̄ada pramodin ̄ı ̧m). Subsequently, a common symbolic formamong Buddhists, Jains, and Hindus represented Lak ̧sm ̄ı flanked by elephants.She also was incorporated into the Tantric pantheon as one of the ten Mah ̄avidy ̄as.Even now, the ́Sr ̄ı S ̄ukta is recited in ́S ̄akta Tantric rituals, especially during theceremonial bath of the Goddess. The ́Sr ̄ı S ̄ukta, addressed to Jatavedas or Fire,9demonstrates that the Goddess originally was invoked for the performance of theyaj ̃na (fire sacrifice). One verse of the ́Sr ̄ı S ̄ukta refers to Jye ̧s ̧th ̄a or Alaka ̧sm ̄ı, thegoddess of poverty and misfortune, who is identical to the Mah ̄avidy ̄a Dh ̄um ̄avat ̄ıof later Tantric tradition. In the B ̧rhad ̄ara ̧nyaka Upani ̧sad 7.4, there is an impor-tant reference associating V ̄ac with such ritualistic terminology that formed theelementary components of the mantras of ́S ̄akta Tantrism.By the middle of the first millennium ..., certain names and forms of thegoddess, such as Um ̄a-Haimavat ̄ı, Ambik ̄a, Durg ̄a, Varocan ̄ı, Sarv ̄a ̧n ̄ı, Bhav ̄an ̄ı,were known. In connection with the construction of forts, the Artha ́s ̄astra ofKau ̧tilya referred to the worship of the goddesses Aparajit ̄a and Madir ̄a, both ofwhom were recognized later in the medieval Tantric tradition. Aparajit ̄a (Invinc-"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"42M. C. Joshiible) might have been an Indianized representation of the Greek Goddess Nike.Madir ̄a (the Goddess of Wine) also was known as Sudh ̄a or Sur ̄adev ̄ı in Tantricrituals. In Tantric texts, she is described as a lustful young damsel of sixteen yearswith three eyes, wearing ornaments and red clothing.10 According to the Pur ̄a ̧nictradition, Madir ̄a or Sudh ̄adev ̄ı, like Lak ̧sm ̄ı, had her birth in the churning of theocean. What is more interesting in Kau ̧tilya’sArtha ́s ̄astra (14.117.1), there is asacrificial chant (mantra) invoking Aditi and Sarasvat ̄ı and other gods for thepreservation of a fort. Kau ̧tilya also identifies the diverse types of fires used insacrifices, that is, the kilns of potters or smiths, funeral pyres, houses of fallen anddevoted wives, or c ̄a ̧n ̧dal ̄as (outcastes). He also mentions offerings of animal fatand flesh as being part of the magical, religious practices. He indicates too thatcertain mantras with non-Sanskritic expressions should be used for the sacrifices.11Certainly some of the components of the magical religious rituals and practicesderived from the ́S ̄abara or other aboriginal tradition of the Tantras.The growth of the cult of the Goddess between the third century ... andthe first century ... is verified by a number of beautifully carved ring stones thathave been found in various urban sites ranging from Taxila to Patna, by a stonetablet from Rajgir and by terra-cotta and metal images recovered from varioushistorical sites. The ring stones have minute carvings of various geometric designs,scrolls, animals, birds, vegetation motifs, and palm trees in conjunction withimages of goddesses (Figure 2).12 Some of the goddesses are fixed on the points of atriangle. One ring-stone from Ropar in the Punjab is carved with the image of thegoddess, a devotee, a hut-shaped temple, a priest, and perhaps another devotee(Figure 3).While most ring stones were fashioned with a hole in the center, a few wereformed as a flat disk. V. S. Agrawala called these carved stones ́sr ̄ıyantras13 (mysti-cal diagram of the Goddess) and they, in fact, seem to be the earliest knownyantras. It is possible that they may have been used by a specific group of ́S ̄aktadevotees. The existence of a cult of the Mother Goddess around the third century... is suggested also by a plaque from Rajgir that depicts a Mother Goddess invarious poses and a priest or devotee who holds a wine cup (Figure 4). Also, theexistence of a fertility cult is confirmed in part by pots that are decorated withhuman figures displaying conspicuous genitalia; these were found in ́Su ̧nga andKushan excavations at Mathura, Purana Qila in New Delhi, and Bhita nearAllahabad. ́S ̄akta Tantrism entered a more conspicuous phase of development after thebeginning of the Common Era, perhaps as the result of the increasing interactionbetween India and West Asia, the rise of Mah ̄ay ̄ana Buddhism and the growth ofP ̄a ́ supata ́Saivism and other Brahmanical sects. Some non-Indian goddesses suchas Cybele, Ardoxsho, and Nana gradually were incorporated into Brahmanism asBhadrak ̄al ̄ı (then Dhum ̄a?), Mah ̄alak ̧sm ̄ı and Durg ̄a Si ̇mhav ̄ahin ̄ı. Possibly theGreek Goddess Artemis was modified into Vana Durg ̄a who subsequently wasidentified with Bhilli or Kirat ̄ı in the Indian aboriginal tradition.

Joshiof non-Indian goddesses into south Asia is verified by a sliver plaque excavatedfrom Ai-Khanoum in Afghanistan depicting Cybele on a chariot drawn by lionsand accompanied by Nike and priests crossing hilly terrain. In conjunction withthis, we cite the Chhoti Sadari epigraph dated 491 .. describing an angry Dev ̄ıwho rides on a chariot drawn by fierce lions.14During the Kushan Period, Durg ̄a became known as Mahi ́samardin ̄ı andKaty ̄ayan ̄ı; she was depicted as being seated on a lion and was associated withK ̧r ̧s ̧na at Mathura. In the popular tradition, she was regarded as the daughter ofNanda and Ya ́sod ̄a, the foster parents of K ̧r ̧s ̧n.15 It is possible that followers of ́S ̄aktism, during the early centuries of the Christian era, borrowed certain ideasfrom the P ̄a ́supatas, particularly the concept of p ̄a ́su or animal (equated in Tantricterminology with an uninitiated human beings) and p ̄a ́sa (bondage to materialattachments and existence). Having incorporated such ideological notions, ́S ̄ak-tism required a long line of gurus with pedigrees relating back to the first master-teacher ́Siva or ̄Adin ̄atha himself. An inscription by Candragupta II found atMathura gives evidence that a tradition of gurus already existed among theLakul ̄ı ́sa-P ̄a ́supatas cult at Mathura. The ́S ̄aktas also adopted the idea of un-bounded compassion (as if emanating from the Mother Eternal) and the term ́sunya from the philosophy of the M ̄ah ̄ayana Buddhism. Images of the M ̄at ̧rk ̄ as,Sa ̧s ̧th ̄ ı and Durg ̄a Mahi ̧samardin ̄ı produced at Mathura may indicate that the sitewas a center for followers of Neo- ́S ̄aktism. One notable sculpture from this periodfrom Mathura is of Sarasvat ̄ı as a Jain deity; apparently the Jains regarded her asthe personification of the teachings of Jina. The image is dated to c.132 .. In hertwo hands, she carries a manuscript and the ak ́sam ̄al ̄a (rosary) that symbolizesrecorded and unrecorded knowledge. Although the image is Jaina, it is carved inaccordance with iconographic prescriptions of ́S ̄akta thought. The ak ̧sam ̄al ̄a heldby this image is the earliest known sculpted example; it signifies the Sanskritalphabet from the first letter A to the last letter k ́sa.16 The string of letters A to k ̧sahas profound meaning in the Tantric tradition. The ak ̧sam ̄al ̄a held by this repre-sentation of Sarasvat ̄ı signifies sound/speech or Vac, the first and ancient form of ́S ̄akta conceptions. The Jain Sarasvat ̄ı from Mathura, thus, embodies the person-ified form of the teachings of the Jaina or Tirtha ̧nkara as stated by Vappabha ̧t ̧ti (c.eighth century ..) in his ́S ̄arad ̄astotra.17The growth of Tantr ̄ac ̄ara (practice of the Tantra) is evidenced by certainreferences in the Divy ̄avad ̄ana ̧m, a collection of Buddhist stories datable to thesecond or third century .. Particularly relevant is the story of ̄Ananda, a closeassociate of the historical Buddha. While roaming near ́Sr ̄ avast ̄ı, Prak ̧rti thedaughter of a C ̄a ̧n ̧d ̄ala (M ̄ata ̧nga), fell in love with ̄Ananda at first glance. Realiz-ing that the fulfillment of her desire to have him was not possible, she enlisted helpfrom her mother, a mah ̄avidhy ̄adhar ̄ı (an expert in magical and religious for-mulas). The mother prepared a sacrificial altar and offered oblations of 108 arflowers and recited a mantra to the Goddess Amal ̄a V ̄ımal ̄a.18 The mantra appearsto be part of the aboriginal ́Sabara M ̄ata ̧nga tradition; it is composed in a mixture"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"47Historical and Iconographic Aspects of ́S ̄akta Tantrismof Prakrit and Sanskrit. Under the spell of this mantra, according to the text, ̄Ananda lost control of himself and became highly disturbed. Thereupon, theBuddha gave him a mantra called Sad ̄aksar ̄ı Vidy ̄a to counteract the Goddess’smagic. Afterward, the Buddha explained to ̄Ananda the importance of the mantra;furthermore, he related that the mantra should be used in conjunction with anamuletic cord that is tied to the arm for protection. The language of the hymn isvery primitive and cannot be understood fully today. It can be determined, at least,that the mantra is the product of a pre-Buddhist tradition and that such practiceswere incorporated by early Sarv ̄astiv ̄ada teachers in order to popularize Buddhism.Because the mantras invoke only female deities such as Amal ̄a, V ̄ımal ̄a, andKu ̇nkum ̄a, they seem to have specific relevance to ́S ̄aktism.Certainly one important milestone in the development of Tantrism was theemergence of the iconographic form of K ̄al ̄ı, the pre-eminent form of ́S ̄akti,sometime between the Kushan and Gupta periods. The earliest reference to her isas one of the seven flames of Agni in the Mu ̧n ̧daka Upani ̧sad (2.4). ButAsvaghosha, the Buddhist author of the Buddhacarita ̧m and the Saundrar ̄ananda,described her as a terrifying woman (divinity?) holding a skull (kap ̄ala) who, as amember of M ̄ara’s army, attempted to disturb the Buddha from his meditations.The verse indicates a somewhat prejudicial Buddhist view toward the GoddessK ̄al ̄ ı; but it is, nonetheless, a very early reference associating the kap ̄ala with K ̄al ̄ı.The well known Sanskrit poet K ̄alid ̄asa refers to K ̄al ̄ı in the Kum ̄arasambhava ̧m;she attended the marriage of ́Siva and P ̄arvat ̄ı wearing ornaments made of skulls.TheDev ̄ı-M ̄ah ̄atmya, the most outstanding ́S ̄akta Tantric text, also refers to K ̄al ̄ı asC ̄amu ̧n ̧d ̄a (7.18) as well as Mah ̄ak ̄al ̄ı (12.37); in these forms, she represents thedreadful and destructive aspects of Supreme Power.TheDev ̄ı M ̄ah ̄atmya, also called Candip ̄a ̧tha or Durg ̄a Saptasati, is vitallyimportant for assessing the growth of ́S ̄aktism in the context of Indian history. Itgenerally has been dated between the fifth and seventh centuries .., but theabsence of any references to Ga ̧ne ́sa or Ga ̧ne ́san ̄ı suggests that it was composedduring a time when Brahma did not recognize Ga ̧ne ́sa as a Bramanical deity.Other Brahmanical gods like ́Siva, Vi ̧s ̧nu, and Skanda are mentioned in the text,but Ga ̧ne ́sa had not yet been admitted into the orthodox fold; therefore, the textshould be dated before the fifth century .., either in the early fourth or even thirdcentury .. There is no doubt that the Dev ̄ı M ̄ah ̄atmya has all the major Tantriccharacteristics—total devotion to the Goddess, fire sacrifices in her honor, asystem of japa (mystical chants), offerings that include the flesh of the devotee andreferences to material enjoyment (bhukti) and liberation (mukti). The text men-tions the triple forms of Supreme Power that symbolically are based on threeelements; they are tama (darkness), raja (brilliance), and sattva (purity) and theyare represented respectively by her aspects called Tamas ̄ı or Yoganidr ̄a, Mahi- ̧samardin ̄ı, and Sarasvat ̄ı. These forms mentioned in the Dev ̄ı M ̄ah ̄atmya symbol-ize the inner movement of the devotee from the darkness of ignorance to the lightof knowledge."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"48M. C. JoshiFrom the Gupta Period, fifth and sixth centuries .., one image portrays anepisode from the first chapter of the Dev ̄ı M ̄ah ̄atmya; the terra-cotta plaque fromBhitargaon and now in the Indian Museum in Calcutta depicts the killing of thetwin demons Madhu and Kaitabha (Figure 5).19 Vi ̧s ̧nu, who sleeps on the snakeAnanta, and Brahma are shown with the two demons. In this sculpture, the Guptaartist meant to convey the idea that Vi ̧s ̧nu was able to kill the twin demons onlythrough the grace of the Goddess.20 The Dev ̄ı M ̄ah ̄atmya also contains referencesto M ̄at ̧rk ̄ as and other forms of the goddesses such as ́S ̄akambhar ̄ı, ́Sivadut ̄ı, andBrahm ̄a ̧n ̄ı. Elements of the monotheistic philosophy of the ́S ̄akta Tantras and theconcept of bindu (focal point for meditation) are apparent as well. ́S ̄akti worship and its connection to Tantrism are attested to by an inscrip-tion found at Gangadhar in Rajasthan; the inscription, dated .. 423– 424,preserves a distinct reference to Tantric practices. It records the construction of ashrine to the Goddess and M ̄at ̧rk ̄ as by a local minister. It refers also to a Tantricritual (tantrodbhuta) which perhaps is based on a left-handed system of Tantrism(V ̄am ̄ac ̄ara) because it mentions ̧d ̄akin ̄ıs and calls the temple ugrave ́sma (powerfultemple where all wishes are fulfilled).21 The somewhat obliterated inscriptionappears to employ the terms ku ̧napa (corpse) and mu ̧n ̧da, suggesting that it isreferring to a shrine dedicated to the Goddess C ̄amu ̧n ̧d ̄a and the M ̄at ̧rk ̄ as andattended by ̧d ̄akin ̄ıs. We, therefore, propose that the damaged section of theinscription mentions chanting the mantras for C ̄amu ̧n ̧d ̄a with her corpse that wererevealed to the ̧d ̄akin ̄ıs. It is quite likely that the unknown author of this inscrip-tion wanted to indicate that, during the daily p ̄uj ̄a (worship), in accordance withTantric rites bali (offering of grain) was offered in the temple of the ̧d ̄akin ̄ıs whichthey accepted with great joy; their presence was felt in a gust of wind. That thetemple’s Tantric rituals are efficacious is made clear by use of the term ve ́ s-matyugra ̧m (most powerful or effective shrine where desires are accomplishedeasily). Fleet’s translation of the term as “terrible abode” does not seem to be quiteappropriate.22 It is apparent that, in the Gupta Period, the goddess Durg ̄a orK ̄aty ̄ayan ̄ı was worshiped in various aspects. The Chhoti Sadari epigraph alsoassociates ́Siva’s Ardhan ̄ar ̄ı ́svara form with ́S ̄aktism and thus the inscriptionalinformation conforms to later ́S ̄akta worship; such notions, in fact, appear to haveserved as the base for the growth of the concept of K ̄amakal ̄a (the triad of ́S ̄akti, ́Siva and N ̄ada-Brahm ̄a).For an understanding of early Tantric practices passages from theHar ̧sacarita of B ̄a ̧na are useful. The work describes ́S ̄akta rites performed for KingPabhakaravatdhana who was gravely ill. Worship included the use of them ̄at ̧rma ̧n ̧dala or yantra by Kulaputras and offering of human or animal heads tothe God Amardaka (Rudra) as Mah ̄abhairava, prayers to the Goddess Ca ̧n ̧dik ̄a(ten-handed Durg ̄a) by a priest from Andhra country and the burning of guggula(incense) on the devotee’s head in order to propitiate Mah ̄ak ̄ala. B ̄a ̧na’s descriptionfocuses on the performance by priests of a special anusthana (ritual) to please theGoddess, the M ̄at ̧rk ̄ as, Bhairava, and Mah ̄ak ̄ala as a means of curing the king.

Joshisignificant feature of this special ́S ̄akta ritual was the offering of the worshiper’sown flesh to the Goddess which, according to ́S ̄akta tradition, is a great sacrifice.TheHar ̧sacarita also preserves some notable references to a secret ritual connectedwith some kind of ́sava (vet ̄ala or zombie); the rite was performed by a Mah ̄a ́saivaBhair ̄av ̄acarya who was South Indian by birth. At the end of the s ̄adhana,Bhairav ̄ac ̄arya became a vidyadhara and King Prabhakaravardhana was granted aboon by the Goddess Lak ̧sm ̄ı (Rajya-Lak ̧sm ̄ı). The Har ̧sacarita also refers to theM ̄ulamantra, a secret initiation which, according to the ́Saiva system, requiredsacrificing a buffalo on Mahanavami (the ninth day of A ́svin) and the Tantric ́Sr ̄ ıparvata cult. Thus, the Har ̧sacarita clearly indicates that, by the seventh cen-tury, ́S ̄akta Tantr ̄ac ̄ara was well established. This kind of religious developmentpresupposes a much earlier beginning for Tantra. Therefore, the reference toTantric rites in the Gangadhar inscription is quite meaningfulIndia’s medieval period is regarded as the golden age of Tantrism, particu-larly for ́S ̄aktas and Buddhists. The employment of the Pa ̃ nca Mak ̄aras (sometimesreferred to as the five M’s—madya (wine), maithuna (sex), mudr ̄a (ritual gestures),matsya (consumption of fish), and m ̄a ̧msa (consumption of flesh) in the Tantricrituals became popular. References in such works as the Mattavil ̄asa Prahasana byMahendravarman and Kaip ̄ura Ma ̃njari by Rajasekhara inform us of the wide-spread awareness of such rites. In addition, alchemy was practiced by some Tantricascetics and teachers in order to turn base metals into gold and to attain a long andhealthy life. During this period, highly developed yantras and ma ̧n ̧dalas wereintroduced to serve as the symbolic abodes of particular aspects of the Goddess.Additional goddesses such as Tripur ̄a, T ̄ar ̄a, ́Sarad ̄a, Bhilli or Kirat ̄ı, M ̄ata ̇ng ̄ıPadm ̄avat ̄ı as well as Nity ̄as and Yogin ̄ıs were introduced. Yantras were regarded assuperior to images because they represented the subtle (s ̄uk ̧sma) and gross (sth ̄ula)forms of Dev ̄ı. Tantric tradition regards the goddess as formless, but she mayassume a form at will.The ́S ̄akta Tantras also incorporated Ku ̧n ̧dalin ̄ı Yoga into their system some-time before the eighth century. The basic concept of Ku ̧n ̧dalin ̄ı Yoga recognizesthat the Supreme Power of the universe exisits in the human body where it lies in astatic or dormant state. The sole aim of Tantrins is to awaken the ku ̧n ̧dalin ̄ı andmake it rise in the body through various practices. Such notions are clearlyindicated in the Dev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧n ̄a (10.9.7–8), ́Sa ̃ nkar ̄acarya’sSaundarayalahar ̄ı (9.10)and Bhavabhuti’sM ̄alat ̄ı M ̄adhava (5.1). This last work also refers to the system ofny ̄asa (purification of the body through the recitation of mantras) (5.21).23The most significantyantra in the ́S ̄akta Tantric tradition is the ́Sr ̄ıyantra(Figure 6) which is first referred to in an Indonesian inscription dating to theseventh century ..24 We can assume then that in India, the country of origin, the ́Sr ̄ıyantra must have existed long before the time of its introduction to Indonesia.Likewise, we can be certain that the cultic deity ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a, the goddess associatedwith the ́Sr ̄ıyantra, predated the seventh century inscription; her cult, however,became popular in India after the eleventh century. The Goddess ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a oc-"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Figure 6 ́Sr ̄ıyantra"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"52M. C. Joshicupies an important position in ́S ̄akta Tantrism. The two principal divisions of ́S ̄akta Tantra are the K ̄al ̄ıkulas and the ́Sr ̄ ıkulas; each has a complicated system ofd ̄ık ̧s ̄as (rites),and s ̄adhanas (meditations) involving a principal deity and relateddivinities who emerge from the ultimate source, that is, the Primordial Energy. Asis evident from the names, the K ̄al ̄ıkulas are associated with the goddesses K ̄al ̄ı anddestruction (samhara); the ́Sr ̄ ıkulas are connected to ́Sr ̄ ı or ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a and creation( ̧s ̧r ̧s ̧ti). The complex form of these sects seems to have been developed sometimeafter the ninth century.What is most significant for students of iconography is the symbolism of thegoddesses with their various attributes. We are concerned here primarily with ́Sr ̄ ıor ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a, a creative force whose highest form is represented by the goddessMah ̄atripura Sundar ̄ı or So ̧da ́si. Her other forms are Lalit ̄a, Tripur ̄a Bhairav ̄ı,Bhuvane ́svar ̄ı, Bala Tripur ̄a-Sundar ̄ı, R ̄ajar ̄aje ́svar ̄ı and others. M ̄ata ̇ng ̄ı, Bagal ̄aand Kamal ̄a who also are connected with creative aspects of ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a are includedby the ́Sr ̄ ıkulas. According to Tantric tradition, ́Sr ̄ ı or ́Sr ̄ ı Vidy ̄a emerged fromMah ̄ak ̄amakal ̄a, that is union of Mah ̄akal ̄a ( ́Siva) and ̄Ady ̄a (K ̄al ̄ı) in a state ofsupreme bliss. The same idea is described in the Lalit ̄asahasran ̄aman wherein theGoddess ́Sr ̄ ı took her birth from the fire of consciousness (Cid ̄agniku ̧n ̧da-Sambh ̄ut ̄a). Thus, ́Sr ̄ ı or ́Sr ̄ ı Vidy ̄a is a creative energy responsible for the expan-sion of creation. The primary forms, attributes, and colors of the principal god-desses of the ́Sr ̄ ıkulas are earthbound—red, vermilion, or yellow, which turn whiteor blue in specific conceptual contexts or in connection with the ideal goal ofmukti. The goddesses of the ́Sr ̄ ıkulas are described as beautiful, young, and charm-ing; they carry in their hands attributes such as the noose, goad, sugarcane bowand arrow, rosary, and book. Other hands assume meaningful mudr ̄as. The noose,goad, and bow and arrow that are held by the Goddess Tripur ̄a are symbols ofworldly attachment, material desires, and things causing worldly attraction.TheLalit ̄asahasran ̄ama explains the symbolism of the attributes of Lalit ̄a or ́Sr ̄ ı; she holds the noose that symbolizes material attachment (r ̄aga), the goad thatrepresents wrath (aha ̧mk ̄ara), and the sugarcane bow that characterizes a mind fullof desires. Because the bow and five arrows are weapons of K ̄amadeva, theysymbolize the five basic human faculties. Other attributes such as the rosary andbook that are held by the divine female deities have significance. The rosaryrepresents the Sanskrit alphabet from A to k ̧sa and is the same as the varnam ̄al ̄a(universal creative energy in the form of sound); the book symbolizes all kinds ofcodified knowledge including dharma (righteous law) and adharma (unrighteouslaw),vair ̄agya (detachment), and avair ̄agya (non-detachment), j ̃n ̄ana (knowledge)andaj ̃ n ̄ana (ignorance).The ́Sr ̄ ıkulas who are the sectarian family of the Goddess ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a placegreat significance on the ́Sr ̄ıyantra ( the mystical diagram of ́Sr ̄ ı) to which theearliest reference occurs in the Saundarya-Lahari. As the abode of the goddess ́Sr ̄ ı,it consists of a central point (bindu) five inverted and four upward triangles withineight and sixteen petaled lotuses that are surrounded by three circles (v ̧rtta). The"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"53Historical and Iconographic Aspects of ́S ̄akta Tantrismwhole is enclosed in a square (bh ̄upara) that is marked with a projection on eachside to mark the entrances to the interior. Although the ́Sr ̄ıyantra, has beeninterpreted by scholars in metaphysical terms, it also has tangible symbolic associa-tions, particularly its outer enclosing perimeters (bh ̄upura) which signify city ortemple walls with four portals, its central pavilion formed of jewels (ratnama ̧n ̧dapa), and its lion throne symbolized by the central point (bindu). Thelocation of ́Sr ̄ ı or Tripur ̄a in the ́Sr ̄ıyantra is likened to that of a great queen(Mah ̄araj ̃n ̄ı) who rules over a country or city called ́Sr ̄ ıpura. That place, accordingto the Tripur ̄a Mahimanstotra, is similar to the mundane world (Sa ̧ms ̄aracak-r ̄amaka ̧m). For this reason perhaps, ́Sr ̄ ı is worshiped in royal form with theaccessories (angas), attributes ( ̄ayudh ̄as), vehicle (v ̄ahana), and family (parivara)that befit her royal status. The Lalit ̄asahasran ̄ama Stotram identifies ́Sr ̄ ı, Tripur ̄a orLalit ̄a as R ̄ajar ̄aje ́svar ̄ı (Empress) and as one who enjoys absolute power(anula ̧mghita- ́S ̄asana).In this context, we need to discuss the Goddess K ̄al ̄ı or Dak ̧sinak ̄al ̄ı. She isrepresented as standing naked with disheveled hair on the corpse of ́Siva. K ̄al ̄ ı is ofthe color of a dark cloud, has three eyes and wears earrings of the dead bodies ofbabies and a garland of skulls. She carries a sword and a human head in two hands;the other two hands signify welcome and blessings. Her blue-black color symbol-izes the limitlessness of cosmic energy or her mahanirgu ̧na-r ̄upa (purest formlessform) that is space itself. Her blue-black complexion also characterizes her assarvatattvatmik ̄a (all elements and colors). She is without clothing because she isabove all illusion; she is K ̄al ̄ı because she governs and creates time. The dead andpowerless ́Siva below her feet represents the Nirgu ̧na-Br ̄ahman (beyond qualitiesor attributes). Her three eyes characterize a trio of light, that is, the sun, moon, andfire. Her grisly earrings represent dharma and adharma and her garland of skullsrepresents the fifty letters in the Sanskrit alphabet (var ̧nam ̄al ̄a), which is symbolicofSabdabr ̄ahman (union leading to ultimate peace). The girdle of severed humanarms around her waist indicates the loss of karma or the end of all action. Shegrants protection and boons with the word of knowledge held in the upper lefthand and kills animal instincts as symbolized by the severed human head in thelower left hand. The weapons held by ́S ̄akta deities including T ̄ar ̄a symbolizeliberation (mukti) in that they remove all fetters of attachment (p ̄a ́sa). BecauseK ̄al ̄ ı is the embodiment of destruction, her yantra has only ́S ̄akti triangles ortriangles with the apex pointing downward (Figure 7). Her yantra has no ́Sivatriangles (apex upward) because she does not symbolize creation. In contrast, the ́Sr ̄ıyantra has five ́S ̄aktitrikonas (triangles) and four ́Siva trikonas (triangles) toindicate creation.The last notable development in Tantric ́S ̄aktism was systematizing theimportant Goddesses into the ten Mah ̄avidy ̄as.

Sundaramoorthy, and others haveproceeded with similar caution, careful to emphasize the difference between factsand speculation when discussing the genesis of Tantric ideology and practice.2While there is little reason to challenge Padoux or to be sanguine about thepossibility of discovering new evidence, there is much to be gained by reconstruct-ing and re-imagining the significance of materials already known and by exploit-ing the potential of underutilized materials that have long laid dormant. Whilethis will lead to more specialized and localized studies, it should not prevent usfrom drawing broader conclusions.Indisputable evidence pertaining to authorship and the origins of Tantrictexts and traditions is usually wanting; what must be inferred leads to the un-satisfactory conclusion that much will never be known. Rather than search forTantrism’s historical primordium, it will be more useful to consider evidence thatillumines specific instances and applications of Tantric thought. Like all studies inreligion, Hindu Tantrism becomes important when texts and traditions are treatedcontextually and comparatively.3In this essay Sanskrit and Tamil materials from texts and traditions arecompared in order to revise our understanding of the development of ́S ̄aktaTantrism. The comparison of Sanskrit and vernacular sources remains one of thegreat untapped resources for Tantric studies. While scholars are aware of thepotential of such sources, few have treated them systematically or comparatively. 4TheTirumantiram, a work of extraordinary breath and poetic value at-tributed to the seventh century cittar (Sanskrit: siddha) saint Tirumular, is theearliest representation of Tantric thought and practice among the Tamil cittars.TheTirumantiram also establishes connections with important Sanskrit-basedcults and textual canons. Although unambiguously committed to a distinctive"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"58Douglas Renfrew Brooksform of Tamil ́Saivism, the author of the Tirumantiram is knowledgeable about atleast one Sanskrit-based ́S ̄akta Tantric cult, the ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a. The Tirumantiram ap-parently understands ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a to be compatible with its own brand of ́Saivismeven though it has little in common with it. Why has the Tirumantiram takennote of ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a and what can be concluded from it?My objective in this essay is twofold. First, I will demonstrate beyond anydoubt that the Tirumantiram is familiar with important aspects of systematic ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a, which in its Sanskritic forms appears rooted in Kashmiri traditions.References suggest that ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a had become significant enough in South India byperhaps as early as the seventh century to warrant mention in a work that expressesonly limited interest in Tantric Saktism. To understand the implications of thesereferences to ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a it is necessary to contextualize them within the Tiruman-tiram and to compare them in light of the historical development of Sanskrit textson ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a. This discussion calls into question ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a’s origins as a pan-Indian ́S ̄akta Tantric cult and in regard to its ideological roots.Second, I will show that the evidence of the Tirumantiram compels us toreassess the relationship between ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a and ́Saivism. The mature ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a pre-sented in the Sanskrit Tantras, which may date from the same period as theTirumantiram, relies almost entirely on materials originating in Kashmiri ́Saivism.While there is much about South India between the seventh and eleventh cen-turies that suggests a context for ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a’s growth, the evidence implies that ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a did not depend on a Kashmiri environment—be it intellectual, social, orgeographic—in order to sustain and advance itself as an autonomous ́S ̄akta cult.Between the seventh and eleventh centuries, ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a became part of a completelydifferent cultural and religious milieu in South India. This situation may cause usto revise our understanding of ́S ̄akta Tantrism’s origins in light of various types of ́Saivism.The evidence suggests that by the time of the Tirumantiram (seventh toeleventh centuries) certain segments within ́S ̄akta Tantrism were quasi-independent from any particular ́Saivism. The ́S ̄aktas’ cultic autonomy may berecognized in fragments of ideology or ritual liturgy that becomes part of the textsand culture of non-Tantrics or of Tantrics who do not represent themselves asinitiates of the cult.In the larger sense, the Tirumantiram provides an unusual opportunity toexamine the relationship between Tamil influences on Tantrism and pan-IndianSanskrit Tantras and to consider relations among different Tantric cults, texts andideologies. This investigation also provides an opportunity to consider some of thecontents of the Tirumantiram.Among the ́S ̄akta Tantric traditions described in the ́Sr ̄ ıkula and K ̄al ̄ıkulaTantras, the cult of Tripur ̄a or the ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a is arguably the most systematic andelaborately depicted. ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a literature identifies its subjects with uncharacteristicclarity and with attention to the details of its distinctive ritual and ideology."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"59Auspicious Fragments and Uncertain WisdomFurther, ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a is also among a handful of Tantric cults that have becomeimportant to those who do not regard themselves initiates.5We identify ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a by a combination of elements, ideologies, and practicesthat cluster together and reflect the pattern of generic characteristics that definethe category “ ́S ̄akta Tantrism.”6 The presence of only one of ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a’s featuresisolated from others will not demonstrate beyond doubt that the author is aware ofits systematic presentation in the Sanskrit Tantras. However, if certain particular ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a elements are present, as they were in the Tirumantiram, then one canmake a compelling case for its cultic presence despite the absence of a largerintellectual or ritual context. In the Tirumantiram, it is the presence of ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a’sdistinctive mantra, the ́sr ̄ıvidy ̄a mantra, and more particularly, its mode of presen-tation that suggest the author has more than a passing familiarity with itsteachings. ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a is centered on the goddess Lalit ̄a Tripur ̄a Sundar ̄ı, who is worshipedin iconic form, as the ́sr ̄ıvidy ̄a mantra, and as the visually striking yantra known asthe ́sr ̄ıcakra or ́sr ̄ıyantra. Although the anthropomorphic or physical deity(sth ̄ular ̄upa) commonly called Lalit ̄a or Tripur ̄a may be secondary to advancedforms of cultic worship, she is essential to ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a’s self-definition. The combina-tion of the mythic goddess with the ́sr ̄ıvidy ̄a mantra and ́sr ̄ıcakra provides thecritical theological triad defining ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a.As her name, “Three Cities,” implies, Tripur ̄a Sundar ̄ı’s cult advances atriadic conception of divinity and the universe. Within the canon of SanskritTantras, the cult of Tripur ̄a, which some adepts call the Saubhagya Sampradaya orLineage of Prosperity, is a first cousin of the Kaula traditions of Kashmiri ́Saivism.Virtually the entire store of Kashmir ́Saiva speculation and vocabulary is adoptedand adapted to suit ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a’s ́S ̄akta focus. For example, speculation about thetriadic nature of mantras is adopted into ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a with little modification; preciselywhichmantras are considered superior and most powerful becomes a means bywhich to distinguish ́S ̄aktas from ́Saivas and ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a from other traditions.7As Madhu Khanna has shown, the earliest Sanskrit expositions of ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄aare likely Kashmiri in origin and share a common intellectual idiom.8 TheseKashmiri-rooted texts, commentators, and concepts do not appear to take writtenforms until at least the ninth century. Our study suggests that the structure of ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a ideology was likely to have been in place perhaps two centuries before itscrystallization in Sanskrit texts.Literally, “auspicious ( ́sr ̄ı) wisdom (vidy ̄a)” or “the wisdom of [the goddess] ́Sr ̄ ı,” ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a embraces the pantheon of Hindu goddesses as aspects of the greatgoddess (mah ̄adev ̄ı). Clearly, the cult is focused on ́Sr ̄ ı as the benign (saumya)consort of ́Siva. Although ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a’s ́Sr ̄ ı subsumes Vi ̧s ̧nu’s consort and even identi-fies one of her roles as Vi ̧s ̧nu’s ́Sr ̄ ı, she is a goddess whose identity is rooted in the ́Saivite traditions. ́Sr ̄ ı then is symbolic of Lalit ̄a’s particular character and func-tions. Her embodiment as auspiciousness ( ́sr ̄ı) suggests she is an intrinsically"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"60Douglas Renfrew Brooksbeneficent deity whose dispositional power is both self-controlled and capable ofcontrolling others.As the supreme deity in the form of the ́S ̄akti (para ́s ̄akti), she is the autono-mous great goddess (mah ̄adev ̄ı), and yet she accepts the empowering and some-times subservient role of wife to ́Siva. In turn, ́Siva cannot even stir without her.9The goddess’s quasi-autonomy and power to subsume all other deities, including ́Siva, should be seen in the larger context of ́S ̄aktism in which goddesses retainindissoluble links to the male figures in the Hindu pantheon.10 ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a’s Lalit ̄a Tripur ̄a Sundar ̄ı is best known as Dev ̄ı extolled in theThousand Names of Lalit ̄a (Lalit ̄asahasran ̄ama) and as the subject of theLalitop ̄akhy ̄ana, both texts of likely South Indian origins traditionally appended totheBrahm ̄a ̧n ̧da Pur ̄a ̧na.11 In the Lalitop ̄akhy ̄ana, Lalit ̄a’s myth is established onpatterns reminiscent of Durg ̄a and other great goddesses.12 She is called upon todestroy the demon Ba ̧n ̧d ̄asura and creates out of herself the weaponry and thearmy of lesser ́s ̄aktis necessary to complete the task. At the conclusion of the ordeal,Lalit ̄a once again assumes the beneficent and empowering roles of mother andwife.In the mythic sense Lalit ̄a achieves a stature comparable to that of Durg ̄a orK ̄al ̄ ı; she must be feared as well as adored. But unlike these horrific aspects of thegoddess, Lalit ̄a’s power is never beyond her own control. In sum, Lalit ̄a Tripur ̄aSundar ̄ı is recognizable as a great goddess inasmuch as she fulfills normativeexpectations and yet she is distinguished by her own myth and character. By theperiod of the Lalit ̄asahasran ̄ama—certainly not much later than the ninthcentury—Lalit ̄a becomes the most clearly articulated complement to the figures ofDurg ̄a and K ̄al ̄ı: as the beneficent great goddess of the Sanskritic tradition she isthen identified with regional figures.While the Lalit ̄asahasran ̄ama suggests that the goddess was well known tocertain Sanskritized elements of society in the region by the ninth century, theimportance of the Lalit ̄a/Tripur ̄a cult in the larger society is hardly clear. Instead,Lalit ̄a becomes a Sanskritic paradigm with whom the benign local goddesses, suchas K ̄amaks ̄ı of Kanchipuram or ́Sivak ̄amasundar ̄ı of Chidambaram, are identified,usually by association with the ́sr ̄ıcakra.The worship of Lalit ̄a in any form or situational context is an issue bestdistinguished from textual presentations. Sanskrit texts critical for understandinggoddess traditions in South India form only one part of the picture. Burton Steinargued that prior to the thirteenth century separate shrines to Pur ̄a ̧nic goddesses inTamilnadu were rare, although images of goddesses within temples became com-mon from at least the eighth century.13 Thus, before the thirteenth century theworship of Lalit ̄a or any goddess established within temples would appear limitedto Brahmanical centers, such as Kanchipuram, Chidambaram, or Tiruvorriyur.14While Lalit ̄a/Tripur ̄a is apparently important to Brahmins in the textual sense, herworship does not appear to be significant in these places either before or in theimmediate centuries after the composition of the Lalit ̄asahasran ̄ama. However, her"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"61Auspicious Fragments and Uncertain Wisdomimagery and worship is perpetuated within samprad ̄ayas (sects) that are not part ofthe cult of quasi-public temple. The Lalit ̄a/Tripur ̄a cult at this time remainsessentially private in practice and rooted in texts that make only ideologicalconnections to local figures.The earliest epigraphy from South India supports this view: Durg ̄a, Jye ̧s ̧th ̄a,the fearsome sister of the benign Lak ̧sm ̄ı, and the Seven Mothers (Saptam ̄at ̧rk ̄ a)are the favored deities in temples.15 It is unclear whether any connection can bemade between the worship of these goddesses in South India and their northerncounterparts. A. L. Basham’s observation that the Gangadhar Inscription dated VS480 (423 ..) is an unambiguous reference to a building constructed for theworship of the Seven Mothers confirms the suspicion that goddesses were en-shrined at this time but should not be taken as evidence of comparable activity inSouth India.16 By the seventh century, Durg ̄a shrines can be identified at Ma-habalipuram, and by 850 at Tanjavur. After the eleventh century, however, whenattentions turn toward Amman and more benign goddesses the populartiy of theearlier terrifying godesses is eclipsed. By the thirteenth century, most ́Siva templesin Tamil country have a goddess shrine while, at the same time, there is a post-Chola resurgence of folk goddess worship within temples.17 ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a appears tomake its presence felt in temples—particularly in Kanchipuram and Chidam-baram—only during this period.Prior to the thirteenth century, ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a as a non-temple based tradition ofTantric goddess worship was likely perpetuated within the large Brahmin settle-ments that pervaded Tamilnadu and were supported by the peasantry. As Stein hasargued, the support extended to these Brahmin communities over time produced ahomogeneous high culture centered on the Vedic gods and Sanskrit learning.18 Itis within this larger framework, I believe, that ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a becomes widely known as a ́S ̄akta cult; Lalit ̄a’s ubiquitous power and consuming character permit her to beidentified with indigenous goddesses with little effect on the local figures’ distinc-tive mythic characters.While ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a’s anthropomorphic goddess eventually is made a part of thelargerbhakti movement in South India, her worship as a Tantric deity centers onhermantra and yantra forms. Since the mantra is not often represented visually orwritten explicitly, it serves as a kind of template that distinguishes ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a’sdistinctive presence in the world of South Indian goddesses and their culticworship. Unlike the yantra whose presence or description does not prove its ritualworship, the mantra is more emblematic of ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a as a personal s ̄adhana re-stricted by the rules of initiated transmission. In other words, the mantra, unlikethe image of Lalit ̄a/Tripur ̄a or the ́sr ̄ıcakra, is the element least likely to be knownto noninitiates and most likely to suggest the discourse of initiates.Lalit ̄a Tripur ̄a Sundar ̄ı’s ́sr ̄ıvidy ̄a mantra appears in a number of variations—too numerous to detail here—but principally two forms usually consisting offifteen syllables. The two pa ̃ncada ́sak ̧sar ̄ıs (fifteen syllables) that are the subject oftextual exegeses are the K ̄amar ̄ajavidy ̄a, revealed by ́Siva K ̄amar ̄aja and known as"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"62Douglas Renfrew Brooksk ̄adi because it begins with the syllable ka, and the mantra revealed by the femalesage Lop ̄amudr ̄a, commonly called h ̄adi or beginning with ha.19 Both versions arethen divided into three parts called a kuta or peak; each peak is named and givenits own significance. ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a’s reliance on triadic symbolism is nowhere moreevident than in its mantra. The mantra’s structure is as follows:Thek ̄adividy ̄a of K ̄amar ̄aja:The h ̄adividy ̄a of Lop ̄amudr ̄a:ka e ̄ı la hr ̄ımha sa ka la hr ̄ım [v ̄agbhavak ̄u ̧ta]ha sa ka ha la hr ̄ımha sa ja ha la hr ̄ım [k ̄amar ̄aj ̄ak ̄u ̧ta]sa ka la hr ̄ımsa ka la hr ̄ım [ ́s ̄aktik ̄u ̧ta]Not only is the mantra’s triadic structure consistent with the patterns ofTripur ̄a Sundar ̄ı’s symbolism, its description in this particular way becomes anormative feature of the cult’s self representation. In addition to her subtle mantra,theyantra or cakra is added. ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a’s ́sr ̄ıyantra or ́sr ̄ıcakra also sustains the essential triadic symbolism.Despite the important variation, the ́sr ̄ıcakra’s basic structure of nine interlockingtriangles surrounded by two sets of eight and sixteen lotus petals remains consis-tent (see figure 6). The smaller triangles created out of the intersection of ninetriangles plus two sets of lotus petals and three outer lines of the rectangularperimeter are treated as nine discreet circuits. Thus, the interpretation of both thewhole and its parts is seen in light of triadic structures. (The nine major trianglesform forty-three smaller triangles that are taken in circuit sets of fourteen, ten, ten,eight, and one. Taking the eight and sixteen lotus petals and the outer rectangles asthree separate circuits there is a total of nine circuits.) The ́sr ̄ıcakra according to theso-called Kaula ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a is its most recognizable form. By combining the mantra,theyantra and the anthropomorphic aspects of divinity with forms of yogic ritualdiscipline, ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a creates a model for a systematic and detailed Tantric cult.To identify ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a’s presence as a Tantric cult would require confirmationof these theological elements in a ritual context. Texts usually give a clear indica-tion of these contexts by the presuming other elements of Tantric s ̄adhana. With-out the supporting context, the most we can say is that elements of ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄asuggest the cult’s instantiation.The connections between the goddess’s triadic forms are not always possibleto verify in a given context. We may see images withouth the ́sr ̄ıyantra and ́sr ̄ıyantra with images. However, the ́sr ̄ıvidy ̄a mantra is least frequently appropri-ated by those who do not worship in the context of Tantric ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄as ̄adhana.Interestingly, the first mention of ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a’smantra in its familiar form and struc-ture is likely not in the Sanskrit texts in which it is clearly part of systematics ̄adhana but in the Tirumantiram.TheTirumantiram (or ́Sr ̄ımantra, in Sanskrit) has yet to receive thoroughand systematic study.20 Consideration of the Tirumantiram has thus far focusedon portions of the text most indicative of dualist ́Saiva theology and the interests of"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"63Auspicious Fragments and Uncertain Wisdom ́Saiva Siddh ̄antins who claim him as one of their own.21 In Tirum ̄ular’s case, theconnection between words attributed to him and his reputed behaviors remainsunclear, let alone his sectarian religious identity. The connection between Tirum ̄u-lar and the dualist non-Tantric ́Saiva traditions that followed him deserves furtherscrutiny.Tirum ̄ular’s legacy associates his ideas about yoga with the devotionalism(bhakti) of incipient ́Saiva Siddh ̄anta. There is nothing within his work to suggestthat he viewed himself a Tantric. Furthermore, those who claim Tirum ̄ular as aspiritual preceptor do not regard him a Tantric. South Indian Tantrics, including ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a’s adepts, do not assign Tirum ̄ular a place in their lineages (parampar ̄a),give no special attention to his work, and create no mythological connections tosignify his contribution to their tradition. In short, as George Hart has observed, itappears that Tantric sources and South Indian devotionalism (bhakti) very likelystem from separate sources.22 At the same time, there is little doubt that much intheTirumantiram also appears as part of Tantric ideology and practice. This isquite different from asserting that Tirumantiram is a Tantric text. Rather, it wouldbe more accurate to say that Tirumantiram shares features that are characteristic ofSanskrit texts. It would appear that the Tirumantiram has connections with, or atthe very least knowledge of, persons who were engaged inTantric behaviors andbeliefs.Before examining the fragments of ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a that appear in the Tiruman-tiram, it is worth considering those features most characteristic of Tamil siddhasthat suggest at least conceptual ties to Tantric thought and practice. KamilZvelebil’s groundbreaking work has contributed much to the general discussion ofthe Tamil cittar movement and needs not be repeated here. The Tirumantiram is aprimary source for the system of ́Saiva Siddh ̄anta, being the tenth book of itscanon. The historical relationship between the Tirumantiram and ́Saiva Siddh ̄antashould not detain us. Tirum ̄ular’s notions of cosmic and ethical order (that is,Sanskrit dharma, Tamil aram) and his devotion to ́Siva are important issues tolater ́Saiva Siddh ̄antins.23 Tirum ̄ular is apparently the first to distinguish andcompare the terms siddh ̄antam (versed in siddha) and ved ̄antam (versed in Vedas)as well as to explicate the theological importance of the triad pati (Lord), pacu(literally, cow, but here soul), and p ̄acam (bondage).24 Furthermore, he details thethirty-six tattvas or principles, the three conditions (avastha), and their cause, thefive impurities (mala), all of which are basic elements of ́Saiva Siddh ̄anta. There islittle about these particular aspects of the work to suggest a cultic Tantrism.Tirum ̄ular and later ́Saiva Siddh ̄anta share much in common with certainstrands of Tantrism—especially Trika ́Saivism and ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a—but no more aTantric movement or sect than Pata ̃njali’s Yoga or S ̄ankhya philosophy because oflater Tantric assimilations. Tantrism, we should keep in mind, is created as syn-thetic traditions borrow, adapt, and reinterpret ideas and practices often withoutexplicit or self-conscious efforts to claim rights of ownership or originality.TheTirumantiram’s major interest in any systematic tradition or canon"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"64Douglas Renfrew Brooksinvolves the so-called ̄Agamas, by which is meant the twenty-eight texts ́Sivarevealed to the twenty-eight celestials.25 Also mentioned are the nine ̄Agamas onwhich arrange the nine chapters (tantiram) of the Tirumantiram.26 The Tiruman-tiram’s reference to ̄Agamic ideas seems indisputable, especially when one considersthe fifth chapter’s discussion of the four paths (c ̄ary ̄a or observe vows, kriy ̄a oraction, yoga and j ̃n ̄ana or knowledge) and four mechanisms for the dispensationof grace (sattinip ̄adam) which are characteristics of ̄Agamic thought.27The term ̄Agama is often used to gloss the term Tantra in Sanskrit texts andis sometimes used interchangeably in the titles of texts. However, the subjects andcategories discussed in the twenty-eight ̄Agama’s are not characteristic of typicalTantra, which eschews the ̄Agama’s interest in temples and public worship.28What is more important here is that the ̄Agamas are sectarian ́Saiva texts; while theTirumantiram’s ̄Agamic-based ́Saivism includes a place for ́S ̄akti, it is clearly not ́S ̄akta in any way comparable to the ́S ̄akta Tantras.TheTirumantiram’s references to the ̄Agamas and use of names of ̄Agamas aschapter headings is somewhat confusing when compared to texts that form theheart of the ́Saiva Siddh ̄anta canon.29 For example, the so-called Kalottar ̄agamadoes not appear in the canon. In addition, the twenty-eight ̄Agamas refer only tothe doctrines of ́Saiva Siddh ̄anta although the verse cites the K ̄amik ̄agama andKaran ̄agama, which are primarily texts on sculpture.30 In short, it seems unclearprecisely which ̄Agamas the Tirumantiram has in mind or which texts it wishes toexclude from the larger canon of Tantras and ̄Agamas. It makes no mention of the ́Sr ̄ ıkula Tantras in which ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a is a primary subject and which stands apart fromthe canon of ́Saiva ̄Agamas.31 Yet, unlike the staunchly sectarian and rather anti-Vedic ́Saiv ̄agamas, the Tirumantiram’s is not hostile to the teachings of the Veda orVe d ̄anta. Rather, it treats the Vedic traditions as distinct and implies that they areinferior to ́Saiva Siddh ̄anta.TheTirumantiram does evince interest in subjects characteristic of theTantras that are not central to the ́Saiva ̄Agamas. This is particularly evident inchapter three where some of the esoteric and individually oriented practices in-volve Ha ̧tha Yoga, such as withholding the semen ( ̄urdvaretasam), the arresting ofurine and the acquisition of the eight great perfections (mah ̄asiddhi).32 Whilethese interests constitute only a small portion of the text, they reveal much abouttheTirumantiram’s worldview and a familiarity with traditions beyond exoteric ́Saivism.Perhaps best known as the principal exponent of yoga in Tamil, Tirum ̄ularequates unqualified love (anpu) of ́Siva with knowledge (kalvi) of him.33 Putdifferently, ́Siva is both love and knowledge; any differences are purely superficial.Fools say: Love and God are different things. Nobody knows that God islove. When they realize that God is love, they repose in the oneness of loveand God.34"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"65Auspicious Fragments and Uncertain WisdomLove consummates the individual’s unmediated experience of ́Siva in thisworld, thus distinguishing the siddha as one who has achieved perfection throughdivine light ( ̧oli), power (catti, Sanskrit ́sakti), and the yogic concentration (sa-madhi).35 Yoga is the method for achieving a relationship with ́Siva that grantsimmortality and provides the means for obtaining the freedom to act as ́Siva acts.As part of this yoga, Tirum ̄ular endorses the possibility of bodily perfection, assertsthat one can attain complete control over bodily functions, and specific techniquesachieve the four stages of liberation preliminary to final liberation. All of thesenotions are in consonance with ideologies and practices advanced in the ́S ̄aktaTantras, although none are exclusively Tantric.In the fourth chapter of the Tirumantiram, the author extols the excellenceand power of the five-letter mantra of ́Siva, civayanama. Clearly, Tirumantiram is atext about mantras as well as other forms of devotion directed primarily at ́Siva.Later, in the sixth and seventh chapters, ́Saivism is extolled as the path to immor-tality and the worship of the li ̧nga as ́Siva’s principal form. Whether Tirum ̄ular’sadvocacy of li ̧nga worship reflects the situation within temples is unclear. K. R.Srinivasan has suggested that it was not until about 800 .. that modes of worshipat ́Siva shrines shifted from the anthropomorphic ́Siva images to the aniconicli ̧nga.36 It was also during this time that female as well as male deities withinshrines became increasingly important for emergent popular bhakti movements—both ́Saiva and Vai ̧s ̧nava. Tirum ̄ular’s influential position as a vernacular poet withlinks to Sanskritized Brahmanical religion may have contributed to this focusingon the ́Siva li ̧nga as the primary image and, by association, his relationship to thegoddess.From the number and content of his remarks about yoga-oriented ́Saivism,theTirumantiram’s concern for gods other than ́Siva is secondary. While we hear ofthe sage Akattiyar (Sanskrit, Agastya) and special attention is paid to Murukan(Sanskrit, Skanda), the text places them in the larger framework of ́Saivism. Yet,unlike some of the other cittar works, the Tirumantiram seems decidedly lessinterested in evangelism and the cause of denominationalism.Perhaps more interesting is that the Tirumantiram is not only about man-tras, but is itself a handbook of mantras. Some portions of the text do not fit intothe mold of devotional poetry nor do they advance the exposition of ́Saivadoctrines and practices.37 Many verses are little more than obscure, mysticalexpressions of transcendence that appear in the form of mantras. Tirum ̄ular’srelatively simple Tamil syntax belies a strong penchant for esoterism, which, incertain instances, suggests a deliberate effort to push issues of semantic meaning tothe periphery. These more obscure mantras are rendered into a cryptic, poeticalTamil evincing strong Sanskritic influences.Whether Tirum ̄ular deliberately intended the verses to function as mantrasin addition to whatever literal or poetical meanings they may possess is uncertain.Nayanar poet-saints who followed after him, such as Sundaramurti, clearly viewed"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"66Douglas Renfrew BrookstheTirumantiram as mantra, that is, as sounds that in themselves are a source ofpower and serve as forms of divine revelation. At issue is the relationship createdbetween discursive speech and mantras. It is in this context we should also considerhis references to the goddess in the form of a mantra.TheTirumantiram passage cited here is the first verse of the twelfth chapterof the fourth book; it begins the section entitled bhuvan ̄apati cakkaram (Sanskrit,bhuvan ̄apati cakra), that is, the cakra of Bhuvan ̄apati.kakar ̄ati yoraintun kan ̄ıya po ̧nmaiakar ̄ati yorararattame pol ̄umcakarar ̄ati yornankun tancutta v ̄enmaikakarati muittai kam ̄ıya muttiye38Provided this verse is not an especially late interpolation—and there isnothing to suggest that it is—its reference is quite extraordinary inasmuch as it hasnothing to do with Tirum ̄ular’s ́Saivism. Although there is no reason to considerthis verse any more a mantra than the others that bear obscure semantic meanings,a familiarity with Tantra mantra ́sastra makes clear its reference. It might betranslated:The letter ka and [all the] five letters are golden colored.The letter a [that is, ha] and [all] the six are red in color.The four letters beginning with ca [that is, sa] are pure white.The three vidy ̄as [that is, k ̄utas or peaks] beginning with ka give desiredliberation.The verse refers to the k ̄adi version of the fifteen syllable principal mantra(mulamantra) of ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a.39 Apparent here is the tripartite structure of the ́sr ̄ı-vidy ̄a, the division of its fifteen syllables into three sets of five, six, and four letters.To these k ̄u ̧tas of letters, which are called vidy ̄as, another word for mantras, areattached a color symbolism.While Sanskrit sources usually encode the mantra’s syllables in order toconceal them from the uninitiated and prevent unwanted articulation beyond theconfines of the ritual, the Tirumantiram seems not to have shared this penchantfor secrecy; neither are all of the mantra’s syllables listed explicitly.40 Instead,familiarity with the mantra is presumed to such an extent that its configurationand relationship to the goddess are neither concealed nor explained.While no further reference to the ́sr ̄ıvidy ̄a mantra is made in the Tiruman-tiram, the Tamil rendering of the mantra should not mislead us. Although inSanskrit the second k ̄uta of the ́sr ̄ıvidy ̄a mantra begins with the syllable ha ratherthana, as the second line of Tamil verse begins, this is a result of the substitution inliterary Tamil of a for ha. Ha is not part of literary Tamil. In the third line of theverse, the Tamil ca is the common letter used for all three forms of the Sanskritsibilant and refers to the first Sanskrit sa."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"67Auspicious Fragments and Uncertain WisdomAware of both its fifteen syllable form and triadic structure, the text focuseson a pattern of color symbolism that may be related to cittar ideology. While therecan be no doubt that it is ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a’s most important and distinctive mantramentioned here, the symbolic description curiously fails to reappear in otherTamil texts on mantras or in Sanskrit ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a texts. Contemporary adepts withwhom I have had contact are either completely unaware of the verse or are unableto decipher the Tirumantiram’s symbolism.In the first line of the verse—in clear reference to the five syllables of thek ̄adi mantra’s v ̄agbhava k ̄u ̧ta—the five letters appear gold (po ̧n) in color, the sixletters of the k ̄am ̄araja k ̄u ̧ta are red and the four of the ́sakti k ̄u ̧ta are “pure white.”Elsewhere in the Tirumantiram, Zvelebil tells us that Tirum ̄ular uses words forcolors (and substances) to refer to alchemical and theological concepts with well-understood symbolic meanings in Tamil; these meanings are in consonance withpan-Indian Tantric traditions.41 It is possible then that Tirum ̄ular wants to con-nect the meanings of these technical alchemical terms to the ́sr ̄ıvidy ̄a mantra.Thus, the v ̄agbhava k ̄u ̧ta which signifies in Sanskrit ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a texts “the essence ofspeech,” is, according to Tirum ̄ular, po ̧n or gold; in symbolic cittar terminology,this color refers to the combination of menstrual flow and semen, that is, thepowerful confluence of ́S ̄akti and ́Siva. If Tirum ̄ular, in fact, does mean to say thatthev ̄agbhava k ̄u ̧ta is symbolic of ́Siva and ́S ̄akti’s joining, later ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a sourceswould concur. Since the v ̄agbhava k ̄u ̧ta begins with the syllable ka, which accord-ing to later sources signifies ́Siva (since it is derived according to the principles ofesoteric etymology from the Sanskrit verbal root kan, meaning to illumine, one of ́Siva’s principal qualities) and ends with hr ̄ım, the traditional seed-syllable (b ̄ı-j ̄ak ̧sara) of the goddess Bhuvane ́svar ̄ı, it is possible that Tirum ̄ular understands thefirst line of the ́sr ̄ıvidy ̄a mantra as a reference to the joining of ́Siva and ́Sakti.42Such an interpretation is in general agreement with the traditions of mantrainterpretation offered by the important later-day ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a writer Bh ̄askarar ̄aya.43We should note, however, that Tirum ̄ular makes no reference to the ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄aesoteric etymology.In ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a texts, the syllables of the k ̄amar ̄aja k ̄u ̧ta are traditionally under-stood to signify the essence or nature of ́Siva in the form of Lord (or King) of desireor K ̄amar ̄aja. Following the line of reasoning suggested above, one would suspectthat Tirum ̄ular means to signify ́Siva by his reference to these syllables as red incolor. Perhaps Tirum ̄ular means that because desire is signified by red, so ́Siva’sk ̄amar ̄aja k ̄u ̧ta is likewise red. Red, however, in both Tantric traditions and incittar vocabulary usually refers to ́Sakti because it is the color of activity, blood, andthe essence of the goddess; it is usually contrasted with the colors white or silver,which signify passivity, semen, the moon, and the essence of ́Siva.44 In the Tiru-mantiram’s verse the six letters of the k ̄amar ̄aja k ̄u ̧ta are ́Sakti’s color, red, while thefour letters of the ́sakti k ̄u ̧ta, which represent the essence of the goddess, are ́Siva’scolor, white. There may be inverted symbolic meaning here—a situation that isnot without precedent in ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a circles.45 In other words for the sake of identify-"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"68Douglas Renfrew Brooksing ́Siva with ́Sakti and vice versa, the author has resorted to this inversion ofsymbolic meanings. However, it seems equally plausible that he has something inmind that we do not understand fully and that his references to color with respectto the sections of the mantra may not be related to the other symbolic schemesemployed in the Tirumantiram. We may never know exactly what Tirum ̄ularmeans by assigning colors to the three k ̄u ̧tas of the ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄amantra.More important is that Tirum ̄ular has an interest in and apparently asophisticated knowledge of a mantra critical to the definition of a sectarian form of ́S ̄akta Tantrism. Zvelebil has noted that Tirumantiram, unlike later works of ́Saivite bhakti, exhibits no preference for any cultic deity or temple cult.46 Butclearly Zvelebil cannot mean that the text exhibits no knowledge of such ́Saiva or ́S ̄akta sectarian traditions. Rather, such observations about the worship of the godsin temples and in various forms, whether mantra and yantra or anthropomorphicimage, advance the interests of ́Saivite sectarianism. Tirum ̄ular’s staunch ́Saivismshould not be construed as a narrow chauvinism. While the overwhelming major-ity of his references are to ́Siva, the goddess and the Tamil deity Murukan are alsoimportant members of his pantheon.Tirumantiram verses 1021–1050 describe the goddess Tripur ̄a and a Tri-pur ̄acakra that is the seat of ́Sakt ̄ı.47 The figure of Tripur ̄a described here appearsto be the familiar aspect of the goddess emerging in full form in the later Lali-top ̄akhy ̄ana and the Lalit ̄ahasran ̄ama. In other words, this appears to be thegoddess of the ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a cult. There is no explicit connection made between theimage of Tripur ̄a described here and the ́sr ̄ıvidy ̄a mantra as mentioned in verse1282; nor does he link Tripur ̄a to the ́sr ̄ıcakra. Instead he describes a separateTripur ̄acakra without a connection to the ́sr ̄ıcakra. The Tripur ̄acakra he describesis not part of later ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a tradition nor does it emerge again in any Tantricliterature in Sanskrit of which I am aware. Like many of the specifics in theTirumantiram, this particular Tripur ̄acakra may have faded into obscurity byvirtue of a more explicit identification of Tripur ̄a with the ́sr ̄ıcakra.We can conclude from the verses describing the Tripur ̄acakra that Tripur ̄ain her inveterate anthropomorphic form is identified with Para ́sakti, the supremedeity, and that her worship is popularly known in South India by the time theTirumantiram was completed. She was associated with a Tripur ̄acakra but not, atleast in the Tirumantiram, with the ́sr ̄ıcakra. On the basis of this evidence it issimply not possible to say if there are connections between the Tripur ̄a the god-dess, the Tripur ̄acakra, and the ́sr ̄ıvidy ̄a in the Tirumantiram. Nonetheless, Tri-pur ̄a’s status as an important deity is remarkable considering the text’s overwhelm-ing ́Saiva orientation.48Another tentative connection between South India and ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a may bemade in a section of the Tirumantiram in which seven varieties of ́Siva’scakras aredescribed. Here the text refers to the cultic worship of Na ̧tar ̄aja in the form of ayantra that has links to ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a’s ́sr ̄ıcakra. The Tirumantiram does not espouse orendorse a separate cult of Na ̧tar ̄aja; neither does it assert any explicit connection"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"69Auspicious Fragments and Uncertain Wisdombetween the siddha and the worship of Na ̧tar ̄aja in Chidambaram. While theNa ̧tar ̄aja cult’s connections with goddess worship in Tamilnadu can be confirmedonly in later sources, Tirum ̄ular’s reference may offer an earlier connection be-tween the ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄as and the worship in the Chidambaram temple, a contention ofcertain contemporary ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a adepts.Verses 894 –978 of the Tirumantiram make possible reference to a Na ̧tar ̄ajayantra in Chidambaram. In particular, contemporary adepts maintain that hisreference is to a portion of the so-called sammelana cakra also known as the secret(rahasya) of Chidambaram. The yantra, because it is a combination (sammelana)of ́Siva and ́S ̄akticakras, is also known as the cidd ̄ak ̄a ́sarahasya (secret of consciousspace), which is identified today inside Na ̧tar ̄aja’s shrine. The present-day yantra iscovered with embossed golden bilva leaves and attached to the wall beside the freestanding image of Na ̧tar ̄aja. Beneath these bilva leaves, according to the priestsand ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a adepts, resides the actual sammelana cakra. The connection be-tween Na ̧tar ̄aja’ssammelana cakra and ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a’s ́sr ̄ıcakra is tenuous but curi-ous when considering Tirum ̄ular’sTirumantiram and works of a later writer,Um ̄apati ́siv ̄ac ̄arya.49There are, however, several problems in making connections between ́Sr ̄ ı-vidy ̄a and the Na ̧tar ̄aja temple in Chidambaram and Tirum ̄ular’s reference to thisparticular yantra. First, the portion of the temple in which the sammelana cakratoday resides almost certainly did not exist in Tirum ̄ular’s day, that is the seventhcentury. The kanaka sabha or golden roofed sanctum that today forms the centerof the temple’s worship of Na ̧tar ̄aja may have undergone significant renovationduring the reign of R ̄ajakesari Kulottu ̇nga II (1130–1150), who was responsiblefor expanding the importance of the goddess cult within the temple by building aseparate shrine for the goddess ́Sivak ̄amasundar ̄ı called the tirukkamako ̧t ̧tam.50Traditionalists assert that the portion of the temple with Na ̧tar ̄aja’s secret sam-melana cakra, is pre–seventh century and that the yantra on the wall is the one towhich Tirum ̄ular refers. This assertion is not based on any historical evidence.From the paintings in chamber nine of the R ̄ajar ̄aje ́svaram Temple in Tan-javur, which depict an overview of the Na ̧tar ̄aja temple at Chidambaram, we cansurmise that, by the time of R ̄ajar ̄aja I (985–1014), the Na ̧tar ̄aja temple alreadyincluded some kind of a kanaka sabh ̄a (golden hall) as well as a cit sabh ̄a (con-sciousness hall).51 It is unclear whether the reference to Tirum ̄ular refers to eitherof these structures and, thus, it is impossible to verify if the reference to a tiruvam-balam cakkaram. He may simply be referring to a ́Siva cakra that is associated withChidambaram.If the ́Siva yantra that the Tirumantiram describes in sammelana cakra canbe linked to the ́sr ̄ıcakra, then there would be strong evidence suggesting thepresence of all three critical elements of ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a—the goddess Tripur ̄a, the ́sr ̄ı-vidy ̄a mantra, and the ́sr ̄ıcakra—in Tamilnadu from as early as the seventh centuryand no later than the twelfth. Further, such a link would suggest the presence ofthe ́sr ̄ıcakra inside an established ́Saiva temple. Unfortunately, the connection"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"70Douglas Renfrew Brooksbetween Tirum ̄ular’stiruvambalam cakkaram and the sammelana cakra is unveri-fiable. Evidence suggesting a relationship between Na ̧tar ̄aja’ssammelana cakra andthe ́sr ̄ıcakra comes only in the thirteenth century work of Um ̄apati ́siv ̄ac ̄arya.52According to contemporary ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a adepts, Tirum ̄ular describes only the ́Siva portion of the combination (sammelana)cakra.53 The information he offersabout the identity of the tiruvambalam cakkaram is not particularly helpful. Hemakes no explicit connection between his ́Siva cakra and the ́Siva portion of thesammelana cakra. In verse 928, he says that the author of the tiruvambalamcakkaram is ́Siva himself and, in v. 930, that the totality of creation in the form ofthebrahm ̄a ̧n ̧da is nothing other than the tiruvambalam. In verse 884, he supplies adescription of the ́Siva cakra that is either the tiruvambalam cakkaram or someportion of it.Draw six lines vertically and six horizontally, thus you create five squares byfive and within these are written the syllables of the ́Siva mantra.54The connection between this ́Siva cakra and the ́sr ̄ıcakra is just as uncertainas the relationship between Tirum ̄ular’stiruvambalam cakkaram and the sam-melana cakra. There is no apparent connection between Tirum ̄ular’syantra andthe so-called ́Siva portions of the ́sr ̄ıcakra, that is, the four upward facing majortriangles that intersect with the five downward facing ́Sakti triangles. This discre-pancy does not prevent contemporary traditionalists from asserting that the sam-melana cakra is actually two distinct yantras—one representing ́Siva and onerepresenting ́Sakti—which are overlain or connected with one another. They basetheir claim on Um ̄apati ́siv ̄ac ̄arya’s description in his Ku ̃nchit ̄a ̧nghristava of the ́Sakti cakra as the ́sr ̄ıcakra and Tirum ̄ular’stiruvambalam cakkaram as the ́Sivacakra.55 Unfortunately, there is no way to verify independently either claim. Todaythesammelana cakra is concealed by golden bilva leaves.In sum, little can be said with certainty about the tiruvambalam cakkaramother than that the Tirumantiram’s interest in the use of yantras in the worship of ́Siva was somehow linked to activities or deities related to Chidambaram. Theevidence presented here is more important for the study of contemporary per-ceptions of ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a’s history than it is useful for the reconstructing the his-torical events surrounding Tirum ̄ular’s life and the theological milieu of theTirumantiram.The first Sanskrit Tantra to offer a detailed exposition of the ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a cult isthought to be the V ̄amake ́svara Tantra, which combines two distinct texts, theNitya ̧so ̧da ́sik ̄ar ̧nava and the Yogin ̄ıh ̧rdaya.56 It is also generally agreed that theNity ̄a ̧so ̧da ́sik ̄ar ̧nava is the earlier of the two halves of the Tantra and that the firstextant commentary on this portion of the text belongs to the twelfth centuryJayaratha, best known for his exposition of Abhinavagupta’sTantr ̄aloka.57 Jay-aratha states that the ninth-century ̄I ́svara ́siva wrote the ́Sr ̄ırasamahodahi, whichaccording to Dviveda was a commentary on the V ̄amake ́svara Tantra.58 Provided"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"71Auspicious Fragments and Uncertain Wisdomone accepts the ninth century as the time of ̄I ́svara ́siva, then surely the V ̄ama-ke ́ svara Tantra comes from an earlier period. Furthermore, the text’s mature andsophisticated portrayal of Tantric ritual may indicate that the tradition underwentits incipient and formative development before the text’s written composition.Interestingly, ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a’s earliest Sanskrit sources offer no suggestions abouthow the tradition began ideologically or ritually. Instead, the Sanskrit Tantraspresent the reader with a full-grown adult, as it were, one whose patterns ofdevelopment are embedded in genealogy that was neither recorded nor consideredimportant enough to rehearse. From the record of Sanskrit texts, it remainsunclear precisely how old the V ̄amake ́svara Tantra might be or what sort of ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a may have preceded it. This situation makes the Tirumantiram’s referenceto the ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄amantra all the more interesting and important.If the V ̄amake ́svara Tantra is any indication of the regional origins of ́Sr ̄ ı-vidy ̄a, then it would appear that the cult of Tripur ̄a that involved the use of thefifteen-syllablemantra and the ́sr ̄ıcakra is Kashmiri, or at least North Indian, inorigin. This idea is supported by recent work done by Madhu Khanna on ́Siv ̄a-nanda’s trilogy.59 If Khanna’s theory of Kashmiri origins is correct, then theappearance of the ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a in the Tirumantiram suggests that the tradition, orsome fragment of it, had migrated south perhaps as early as these Sanskrit sources.One can conclude certainly from the Tirumantiram’s reference to the mantrathat a necessary piece of ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a was known and was present in Tamilnadu duringthe seventh century. Given the text’s general interest in mantra ́s ̄astra, it is certainlyplausible that it is aware of the mantra without knowing about the cult of Tripur ̄aor ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a. But that the text knows enough about this mantra to describe apattern of symbolism associated with it suggests that the form, structure, andmeaning of the mantra had undergone significant interpretation. It also seemsplausible that the Tirumantiram does indeed know more about the mantra than itsays here and that some form of systematic ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a was being practiced in Tam-ilnadu by the time of its composition.While the Tirumantiram does not suggest that ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a’s roots are in SouthIndia, it does advance our understanding of the intellectual and historical milieuin Tamilnadu at the time of the emergent Tantras. Our most important conclu-sions about ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a in Tamilnadu are two. First, at least one portion of ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a,itsmantra—one of its most advanced concepts—is understood to be congenialwith Tirum ̄ular’scittar ́Saivism. Mantras like the ́sr ̄ıcakra appear not to have beenrestricted to those whose primary allegiance is to the great goddess or morespecifically, to Lalit ̄atipurasundar ̄ı. Different forms of ́Saivism create environmentsin which ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a can sustain itself and even flourish. Second, it appears that ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a established itself in a cultic sense in South India as a quasi-autonomousform of ́S ̄aktism that did not require a specifically Kashmiri ́Saiva context. How-ever woven into the ideological fabric of Kashmiri ́Saivism ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a may be in theSanskrit ́S ̄akta Tantras, its life as a mantra appears independent of this particularcanon."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"72Douglas Renfrew BrooksFurther suggestions about the cult of the goddess Tripur ̄a or about ́sr ̄ıcakrain the temple cult of Na ̧tar ̄aja are far less certain. At this point, the story of thecult’s development, either in terms of individual elements or as a systematic formof Tantric s ̄adhana, shifts to texts in Sanskrit. If, in fact, ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a sources do comefrom a period before or concurrent with Tirum ̄ular’s seventh century date—anissue still not settled—then our understanding of the chronology of the HinduTantras must be revised. If the sources of the so-called K ̄al ̄ıkula, that is, thosecentered on aspects of K ̄al ̄ı rather than ́Sr ̄ ı, are composed, as Teun Goudriaanmaintains, well before ́Sr ̄ıkula texts which include ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a, then these too will beaffected by the evidence in the Tirumantiram. This evidence not only corroboratesGoudriaan’s point, but suggests the presence of a mature form of ́S ̄akta Tantrismwell before references to the first commentaries on the Sanskrit texts.With the evidence of the Tirumantiram, we can now conclude that portionsof ́S ̄akta Tantrism may have been codified and disseminated orally at least twocenturiesbefore they are committed to written Sanskrit. While admittedly frag-mentary in nature, evidence of ́Sr ̄ ıvidy ̄a in the Tirumantiram provides a beginningfor contextualizing Tantrism in the history of Indian religions and establishes thepresence of a form of pan-Indian ́S ̄akta Tantrism in early medieval India.60NOTES1.

CoburnOne of the abiding problems for scholars of South Asian religion is how best toconceptualize the relationship between the different strands of the traditions weare trying to understand. Even if one factors out the minority traditions of thesubcontinent, the problem of an adequate approach to the remainder—conventionally called “Hinduism”—looms large. The persistence of the problemis suggested by the widespread attention it has received of late, not just in scholarlycircles, as a result of the convergence of religion and politics in apparently newforms. How much of the agenda of the Bharatiya Janata Party and the VisvaHindu Parishad is an expression of traditional religious sentiment, how much is afunction of that sentiment in distinctly twentieth-century guise, and how much ispurely political opportunism? How much truth lies in the quip that the Indianshave been religious for millennia, but “Hinduism” was born in the nineteenthcentury? Answers to such questions are not simple nor easy to come by.Nowhere is the problem of conceptualizing Indian religion more vexingthan in trying to determine the status of Tantra and its relation to non-TantricHinduism. Recently we have begun to make progress on the long-standing defini-tional problem, and for my purposes in this article, the definition of Andr ́e Padouxwill suffice:Tantrism [is] a practical path to supernatural powers and to liberation,consisting in the use of specific practices and techniques—ritual, bodily,mental—that are always associated with a particular doctrine. These prac-tices are intrinsically grounded in the doctrine that gives them their aim andmeaning and organizes them into a pattern. Elements of the doctrine mayalso be associated and welded into a practical worldview, Tantrism is there.1This definition acknowledges that Tantra cuts across both Buddhist and Hindutraditions, but it leaves open such unresolved questions as the historical antiquityor the social or geographic provenance of Tantrism. Opinions on these mattersremain very diverse. The dominant scholarly view, of course, is that Tantrismbegins in the early centuries of the Christian era and becomes a dominant feature"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"78Thomas B. Coburnof the Hindu landscape over the course of the next millennium. We are accus-tomed to thinking of Hinduism in partially overlapping historical stages—theVedic, the epic, the Pur ̄a ̧nic, and then the Tantric—but we often hear an alterna-tive voice, usually from Indian scholars, claiming much greater antiquity forTantra. On the contemporary scene, Madeleine Biardeau indicates how verycomplex the situation is:Although tantric theory clearly distinguishes itself in its most general aspectsfrom bhakti, and although it seeks to deepen this cleavage through a reversalof brahmanic values in practice as well as in a broad range of its religiousliterature, the gap is in fact a very small one. We find tantric themes in thePur ̄a ̧nas, and references to the Pur ̄a ̧nas in the Tantras as well as authors whowrite commentaries in both bodies of literature. The great Pur ̄a ̧nas are readin temples in which the ritual is said to be tantric, but in which the majorityof worshipers are mainstream Hindus who come to the temple with a vaguenotion of the meaning of ritual . . . and who would never dream of takinginitiation into a tantric sect.2As a modest contribution to understanding further the relationship betweenthese concepts or texts or worldviews, I should like here to look at a particularpassage from the Pur ̄a ̧nas and how it is interpreted by two commentators, one aTantric of the ́Sr ̄ ı Vidy ̄a school, one a Ved ̄antin, both of whom are philosophicaladvaitins (nondualists). The passage comes from the famous sixth-century ́S ̄aktatext, the Dev ̄ı-M ̄ah ̄atmya or Durg ̄a-Saptasati, which comprises thirteen chapters intheM ̄arka ̧n ̧deya Pur ̄a ̧na. The commentators are two eighteenth-century figures,N ̄agoji Bha ̧t ̧ta or N ̄age ́sa the Ved ̄antin, and Bh ̄askarar ̄aya the Tantrin. In a recentmonograph, I have explored the nature of the text and the relationship of thesecommentators to it in some detail.3 What I should like to do here is look closely ata specific passage—whose discussion in my monograph is limited to one footnotebecause of the complexity of the commentaries on the passage—as a lens forviewing the larger conceptual issues. I leave to one side my discussion elsewhere ofthe commentator’s biographies and of the nature and structure of their commen-taries. I simply note in passing that the primary concern of both Bh ̄askarar ̄aya andN ̄agoji Bha ̧t ̧ta is the proper division of the verses of the Dev ̄ı-M ̄ah ̄atmya into 700mantras for recitation and the proper technique for reciting them. In other words,they consider it chiefly a ritual text, whose verbal power is to be controlled andthen released, not a philosophical text, whose meaning is to be understood. It is allthe more noteworthy, then, that both commentators do take pains to understandthe meaning of this particular passage. The reasons for this are not hard to find, forit is indeed a puzzling passage, as we shall now see.The passage comes at the very beginning of the third of the Dev ̄ı-M ̄ah ̄atmya’s three episodes (caritas). The Goddess has previously promised to assistthe gods whenever they find themselves in difficulty. The fifth chapter begins:"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"79The Structural Interplay of Tantra, Ved ̄anta, and BhaktiOnce upon a time, the two demons, ́Sumbha and Ni ́sumbha . . .

[and] Ni ́sumbha . . . ”5.40 Since Ambik ̄a came forth from the body sheath [ko ́sa] of P ̄arvat ̄ı, Sheis sung of in all the worlds as “Kau ́sik ̄ı.”5.41 When she had come forth, P ̄arvat ̄ı became black (k ̧r ̧s ̧na). Known as“K ̄alik ̄a,” she makes her abode in the Him ̄alayas.5The figure who is here called Ambik ̄a and Kau ́sik ̄ı remains the central object ofand the central agent in the rest of the Dev ̄ı-M ̄ah ̄atmya, throughout all theproliferation of divine forms in battle. She is understood as commensurate withthe Goddess with a capital G who has been described earlier in the text, who is alsocalled Ambik ̄a in her defeat of the demon Mahi ̧sa. However, of P ̄arvat ̄ı, “the blackone” (K ̄alik ̄a,k ̧r ̧s ̧na), who abides in the Himalayas, we hear not a word morethroughout the rest of the text. She is, quite simply, not mentioned at all.Elsewhere I have suggested that this mysterious treatment of the forms ofthe Goddess is consistent with the overall spirit and apparent intention of the text.It is a bhakti (devotional) text. Its concern is to portray the Goddess as thefundament of the universe, to describe three of her salvific interventions in theworld in some detail, and then to glorify her kaleidoscopic metamorphic potential.Like many other Pur ̄a ̧nic texts, the Dev ̄ı-M ̄ah ̄atmya is not interested in delineatingwith precision how various divine forms are related to one another. Its concern isto praise, not to analyze. Indication of this is found in two facts: first, throughoutthe course of the narrative, the text applies over two hundred different names tothe Goddess, and second, contrary to the dominant Hindu conceptualization, onone occasion the text describes ́sakti or female power as coming forth from theGoddess herself, not just from the male deities who are on the scene.

If anything, they enhance the wonder she evokes inher devotees.6Thirteen hundred years later, however, the relationship between the severalforms of the Goddess, and their bearing on pressing matters of religious truth, wasthe concern of our commentators. It was incumbent upon them, therefore, todilate upon the substance of this passage. Both N ̄agoji Bha ̧t ̧ta and Bh ̄askarar ̄ayabring to their analysis of this passage two kinds of hermeneutical methods. Theyare in agreement that both of these approaches are relevant to understanding thepassage, but they apply them in different ways. One is the rudimentary philosophyspelled out in the three Rahasyas or “secrets” that have been appended to the Dev ̄ı-M ̄ah ̄atmya since at least the fourth century. The other is a cluster of passages drawnfrom the ́Siva Pur ̄a ̧na. Let us look briefly at both of these.The Rahasyas together amount to some ninety-three verses and constitute akind of appendix to the Dev ̄ı-M ̄ah ̄atmya.7 They are placed in the mouths of thesame interlocutors as those in the Dev ̄ı-M ̄ah ̄atmya. They begin with the kingsaying to the seer: “You have told me all about the Goddess’savat ̄ars. Now pleasetell me about their material nature (prak ̧rti), their primary form (pradh ̄ana), theGoddess’s very own form (svar ̄upa), and how she is to be worshiped.” The seerthen proceeds to provide what one of my Indian colleagues has called “the earliestsystematic statement of ́S ̄akta philosophy.”8 Charts 5.1 and 5.2 provide the im-portant relationships in this philosophy, which is conveyed in mythological lan-guage. The important affirmations are these. The foundation of the universe isMah ̄alak ̧sm ̄ı, whose own form is both with and without characteristic marks. Sheis constituted of three qualities (trigu ̧na) and pervades everything. She has fourarms. On seeing the universal void, she took on two other forms, in each of whomthere is a predominance of one of the three qualities (gu ̧nas) that are formallyassociated with S ̄a ̧mkhya philosophy, but that have pervaded Indian cosmologicalthinking since the time of the Bhagavad G ̄ıt ̄a. In the form named Mah ̄ak ̄al ̄ı, thereis a predominance of tamas gu ̧na (quality of darkness), while in the one namedMah ̄asarasvat ̄ı there is a predominance of sattva gu ̧na (power of light, knowledge,and purity). Each of the three goddesses then produced a set of twins, one male,the other female. Mah ̄alak ̧sm ̄ı proceeded to arrange three marriages—betweenBrahm ̄a and Sarasvat ̄ı, between Vi ̧s ̧nu and Laksm ̄ı, and between Rudra andGaur ̄ı—and each couple was given one of the three cosmic functions of creation,preservation, and destruction. Though Mah ̄alak ̧sm ̄ı has three qualities (trigu ̧na),she has an implicit predominance of the gu ̧na of rajas (dynamic energy) by virtueof having assigned the other gu ̧nas to her other two forms. All of this activity, weshould note, takes place within the realm of the unmanifest (avy ̄ak ̧rt ̄ a), as a kind ofinternal life of the Godhead or, more properly, the Goddesshead.At the level of the manifest world (vik ̧rti), the Goddess also has three chiefforms, “immanent” forms, if you will, with the same names as, but slightlydifferent iconography from, their “transcendent” (avy ̄ak ̧rt ̄ a) counterparts.

Coburnthese forms is understood to preside over one of the three episodes (caritas) of theDev ̄ı-M ̄ah ̄atmya, according to the pattern indicated in Chart 2. Moreover, each ofthe four hymns of the Dev ̄ı-M ̄ah ̄atmya, which are widely agreed to constitute thedevotional core of the text, is understood to be directed to a manifestation of theGoddess. There is one hymn in each of the first two episodes that is straightfor-ward enough: the hymns are directed to the two vik ̧rti forms of the Goddess thatpreside respectively over those two episodes. Of the two hymns in the thirdepisode, the one in chapter 11 is directed to the vik ̧rti form of Mah ̄asarasvat ̄ı,while the one in chapter 5—the hymn that we have just seen precedes ourpuzzling passage—is directed to the highest form of Mah ̄alak ̧sm ̄ı, her avy ̄ak ̧rt ̄ a or“transcendent” form. The origin of the hermeneutical apparatus that the Rahasyasprovide remains a mystery. For our purposes, it is enough to note that bothBh ̄askarar ̄aya and N ̄agoji Bha ̧t ̧ta take the assimilation of the Rahasyas to the textfor granted, and one of their fellow commentators goes so far as to allege that thereal reason R ̄ama slew R ̄ava ̧na was because the demon recited the Dev ̄ı-M ̄ah ̄atmyawithout the Rahasyas!9All of the passages that N ̄agoji Bha ̧t ̧ta and Bh ̄askarar ̄aya cite from the ́SivaPur ̄a ̧na, the second of the templates they use for understanding our passage, comefrom the first part of the seventh book, the V ̄ayu Sa ̇Mhit ̄a, from chapters 24, 25, or27.10 In three cases, the commentators cite exactly the same passage. In two cases,they cite very similar passages, where the differences are likely mere textual vari-ants, a common Pur ̄a ̧nic phenomenon. N ̄agoji Bha ̧t ̧ta then cites one furtherpassage. There is, in other words, a common pool of passages that both commen-tators cite, though they do not cite them in the same order or to the same purpose.The relevant chapters in the ́Siva Pur ̄a ̧na recount the events that follow inthe wake of the destruction of Dak ̧sa’s sacrifice, and they tell a reasonably coherentstory. ́Siva and his consort, called ́Siva or dev ̄ı, the Goddess, who has earlier beencalled P ̄arvat ̄ı (7.23.15), settle down to enjoy themselves on Mount Mandara.After several years two demon brothers, named ́Sumbha and Ni ́sumbha, are bornand through tapas (internal heat) gain from Brahm ̄a the boon that they cannot beslain by a man. “Rather, let us be slain in battle by a woman with whom we havefallen in love, an invincible maiden, who has not taken delight in the touch of aman, not born from a womb, but produced from a fragment (a ̇m ́sa) of Ambik ̄a”(7.24.26). When the demons have subsequently vanquished all the gods, Brahm ̄aasks ́Siva to anger or tease the Goddess so that a ́sakti (power), a maiden utterlydevoid of passion, may be born from the sheath (ko ́sa) that has her bodily color(7.24.26–30). So ́Siva playfully teased the Goddess by calling her K ̄al ̄ı, “the blackone,” whereupon she grew angry, reviling him for apparently only pretending tolove her, and reviling herself for apparently having given displeasure to her hus-band. ́Siva apologizes, indicating that his remarks had been made in jest and thattheir purpose will eventually become evident. The Goddess will have none of this,saying it must be her non-lustrous form (agauram vapu ̧h) that had prompted himto call her black; she will rectify the situation by practicing tapas, winning a boon"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"83The Structural Interplay of Tantra, Ved ̄anta, and Bhaktifrom Brahma, and becoming lustrous (gaur ̄ı: 7.24.53). She retreats to the Hima-layas and performs fierce austerities, even taming a tiger that comes to devour her.Brahm ̄a, pressured again by the gods for relief from ́Sumbha and Ni ́sumbha, hashis attention caught by the power generated by the Goddess’s practice of tapas.Approaching her and learning of her desire to shed her blackness, he is puzzled,for, as the Goddess, she can have anything she wants just for the asking. But hethen chooses to make use of the power ( ́sakti) she has built up, for the purpose ofdestroying the demons. Upon request then, “the Goddess, casting off the sheath ofher skin (tvakko ́sa), became golden (gaur ̄ı). A Black (k ̄al ̄ı) maiden with the lustreof a thundercloud, was born from the skin-sheath and called ‘Kau ́sik ̄ı’ ” (7.25.38–39). This power ( ́sakti), called Vi ̧s ̧nu’s yogic slumber (yoganidr ̄a), whose nature ism ̄ay ̄a (illusion) (7.25.40), bows to Brahm ̄a and to Gaur ̄ı, who is called her mother,and immediately goes off to slay the demons. When Gaur ̄ı returns to ́Siva’s abode(7.27), ́Siva asks if her anger has passed, says that he loves her whether she is k ̄al ̄ı orany other color, and points out the many ways in which they are mutuallyinterdependent. He repeats that it was just to assist the gods in getting rid of thedemons that he teased her. The Goddess ignores this flattery, but asks if he hasseen the maiden Kau ́sik ̄ı, whose like has never been nor will be known. Brahm ̄awill provide him with details of that maiden’s battle with the demons, she says.The faithful tiger is then installed as guardian of the household and the text moveson to other, very different concerns.This account is of intrinsic interest for a number of reasons. It clearlyunderstands the relationship between ́Siva and Dev ̄ı as a much more symbioticone, as Ardhan ̄ar ̄ı ́svara (see 7.15), than does the parallel passage in the Dev ̄ı-M ̄ah ̄atmya, where the Goddess reigns virtually supreme. It is concerned to explainthe relationship between the various forms of the Goddess with greater precisionthan is in our text, and it has a more fully developed concept of ́sakti. I suspect itwas composed a good deal later than the sixth-century Dev ̄ı-M ̄ah ̄atmya. Mostintriguingly, the ́Siva Pur ̄a ̧na account reverses the emphasis of the name and thecolor of the form called “Kau ́sik ̄ı.” The Dev ̄ı-M ̄ah ̄atmya, as we have seen, has aluminous form named Ambik ̄a arising from the ko ́sa of P ̄arvat ̄ı, whence Ambik ̄agets the designation “Kau ́sik ̄ı.” It is P ̄arvat ̄ı who becomes black and retires to theHimalayas, leaving Ambik ̄a/Kau ́sik ̄ı at center stage. The ́Siva Pur ̄a ̧na, however,sees the figure who arises from the ko ́sa, who is therefore named Kau ́sik ̄ı, to takethe color from the ko ́sa, which is black. It is she who makes the quick exit, to dobattle, leaving the luminous (gaur ̄ı) P ̄arvat ̄ı, who has earlier been called Ambik ̄a, asthe dominant presence in the text. All of this, however we now leave to one side, aswe turn to exploring how N ̄agoji Bha ̧t ̧ta and Bh ̄askarar ̄aya bring citations fromthis account, and from the Rahasyas, to bear on our puzzling passage.N ̄agoji Bha ̧t ̧ta’s position is a good deal easier to understand thanBh ̄askarar ̄aya’s, in part because it is more familiar to Western scholarship, in partbecause he has less at stake here religiously. So let us start with N ̄agoji Bha ̧t ̧ta.11 Ihave suggested above, and elsewhere, that he may be understood as an Advaita"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"84Thomas B. CoburnVe d ̄antin.12 Nowhere, in either his Dev ̄ı-M ̄ah ̄atmya commentary or elsewhere,have I found him giving a systematic exposition of his view, but general evidencefor my suggestion is that his chief claim to fame is as a grammarian, a field which,in the eighteenth century, was steeped in the culture of ́Sa ̇ nkara’s school. Morespecifically, we find him using revealing terminology throughout his commentaryon the Dev ̄ı-M ̄ah ̄atmya. Thus, when at the end of the final battle, the Goddessresumes all the diverse forms into herself, N ̄agoji says that Ambik ̄a then stoodentirely alone “because of the lack of differentiation within the m ̄ula- ́sakti (primalpower)” (10.4). Elsewhere (4.6) he calls her the m ̄ula-prak ̧rti (primordial sub-stance). Similarly, it is in the form of ignorance that she causes sams ̄ara (rebirth),but in the form of knowledge (vidy ̄a) that she brings it all to an end (5.11). M ̄ay ̄aitself is to be understood as ignorance (avidy ̄a: 11.4). Most telling is N ̄agoji’s claimthat what makes the terribleness of the Goddess so great is that it cannot be“sublated” (atirikta) by anything other than knowledge of Brahm ̄an, for he is hereusing one of the specific master concepts of Advaita Ved ̄anta.If we grant then that N ̄agoji appears to be an Advaita Ved ̄antin, certainconclusions follow.13 Adopting a dualistic epistemology, he assumes that there is a“lower” sphere of conventional knowledge (vy ̄avah ̄arika), and a “higher” realm ofultimate truth (p ̄aram ̄arthika). What the Dev ̄ı-M ̄ah ̄atmya presents, with its mythsand hymns and devotional fervor, belongs entirely to the former realm. It offers apowerful and temporarily valid understanding of the universe, but it is not finallytrue, for it is sublated, or surpassed, or transcended by knowledge of a non-dualBrahm ̄an. What N ̄agoji Bha ̧t ̧ta is about in his commentary, then, is simply thesetting in order of fragments of truth, the rearrangement of approximately accu-rate formulations.This turns out to be exactly what is on N ̄agoji Bha ̧t ̧ta’s mind in his commen-tary on our puzzling passage. It is too glib to imagine him saying—“Well, it’s nowonder the passage is puzzling: what can you expect from myths and otherdetritus from the vy ̄avah ̄arika (ordinary) realm!”—for his search for intelligibilityruns deeper than that. But he does appropriate, almost mechanically, a particularway of explaining the dynamics of the vy ̄avah ̄arika realm in general and of thispassage in particular. What he alights on is the three-gu ̧na theory of the Sa ̇mkhyaschool, often used by Advaita Ved ̄anta to explain the ordinary world and, as wehave seen, introduced in the Rahasyas in association with the different forms ofMah ̄alak ̧sm ̄ı. The problem for N ̄agoji Bha ̧t ̧ta here and throughout the thirdepisode, is as follows. In the first episode of the Dev ̄ı-M ̄ah ̄atmya, the association ofkilling with Mah ̄ak ̄al ̄ı, in whom tamas predominates is comprehensible: ignoranceandm ̄ay ̄a are part of Mah ̄ak ̄al ̄ı’s power, and she uses them to delude the demonsMadhu and Kai ̧tabha into challenging Vi ̧s ̧nu in this episode. Similarly, in thesecond episode, the association of Mah ̄alak ̧sm ̄ı and rajas is necessary to kill thebuffalo demon Mahi ̧sa. But how can the power of sattva, which logically belongsto Mah ̄asarasvat ̄ı in the third episode, be used to justify any killing? Goodnessalone does not kill, so how can Mah ̄asarasvat ̄ı do so? This is the hermeneutical"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"85The Structural Interplay of Tantra, Ved ̄anta, and Bhaktiproblem for N ̄agoji Bha ̧t ̧ta. The passage with which we are concerned has greatpotential for solving this problem and demonstrating how the distribution of theforms and qualities of the Goddess works. What is the characterization of Ambik ̄a/Kau ́sik ̄ı as ́Siva, auspicious, indicates, says N ̄agoji (comm. on 5.38), is that she is aportion (a ̇m ́sa) of the Dev ̄ı in whom the gu ̧na of sattva predominates. Hence theexpectation that sattva dominates in this episode is met. Beyond that, however,because of the close connection (sahodaritva) between the two forms that thispassage demonstrates, it is legitimate to expect that the tamasic qualities of theblack K ̄alik ̄a/P ̄arvat ̄ı, who retires to the mountains, will spill over into the formand actions of Ambik ̄a, enabling her to do battle with the demons (comm. on5.41). It makes good sense for N ̄agoji to quote the ́Siva-Pur ̄a ̧na in this regard, for,as we have seen, the reversed emphasis in that text invites us to blur the distinctionbetween light and dark forms in just the way that N ̄agoji wants us to. The passageis indeed troubling, but N ̄agoji makes a virtue of necessity and shows how there isindeed a logic to the forms of the Goddess that are active within the vy ̄avah ̄arikarealm. This passage demonstrates that logic by identifying the activity of the sattvagu ̧na form of the Goddess.Bh ̄askarar ̄aya’s commentary on this passage proceeds in quite a differentfashion, for while he too is a nondualist, his nondualism is of a Tantric sort,specifically of the ́Sr ̄ ı Vidy ̄a school.14 He therefore does not accept the epistemo-logical dualism of Ved ̄anta; his philosophy points toward the ritual actualization ofthe power of the unmanifest Mah ̄alak ̧sm ̄ı, which is ontologically connected to,and accessible in, the mantras of the Dev ̄ı-M ̄ah ̄atmya. He knows the power thatinheres the ritual recitation of the text and he is concerned to show how that powersprings from the very foundation of the universe.There are three chief points that Bh ̄askarar ̄aya makes in his commentary onthe verses of our passage. In typical scholastic fashion, he pays careful attention todiction and grammar, so let us meet him on his own terms with a similar kind ofanalysis.His first point is that there is a kind of interchangability between the twoforms of the Goddess in this passage, K ̄al ̄ı (ka) and P ̄arvat ̄ı, which is a secret(marmatva: comm. on 5.38). In support of this, he cites the relevant passages fromthe ́Siva Pur ̄a ̧na account and says that the dark maiden who emerges from the ko ́saafter P ̄arvat ̄ı’stapas in the ́Siva Pur ̄a ̧na was the vibh ̄uti of P ̄arvat ̄ı. The word vibh ̄utiis a pregnant term, with a range of meanings from “beauty” and “prosperity” to“what is most important about something,” its “essence.” Daniel Ingalls hassuggested it means something like Eliade’s concept of hierophany.15 In the Dev ̄ı-M ̄ah ̄atmya itself this is the term that is used at the end of the last combat, when ́Sumbha accuses the Goddess of false pride for relying on the power of the otherdeities, and she responds: “’I alone exist here in the world; what second, other thanI, is there? O wicked one, behold these my vibh ̄utis entering back into me!’Thereupon, all the goddesses . . . went to their resting place in the body of theGoddess, then there was just Ambik ̄a, alone” (10. 3– 4). Thus, like N ̄agoji Bha ̧t ̧ta,"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"86Thomas B. CoburnBh ̄askarar ̄aya asks us to blur the distinction between the two forms, but he does so,not to justify the correspondence of the Goddess’s forms with the theory of thethree gu ̧nas, but to emphasize that there is, in fact , only one Goddess, one reality,no matter how many different names or labels we may apply to her.Bh ̄askarar ̄aya’s second and third points depend on the interpretation of acrucial half line, so let me cite again the last two verses of our passage:5.40 Since Ambik ̄a came forth from the ko ́sa of P ̄arvat ̄ıShe is sung of in all the worlds as “Kau ́sik ̄ı.”5.41 When she had come forth, P ̄arvat ̄ı became black.Known as “K ̄alik ̄a.” she makes her abode in the Him ̄alayas.The Sanskrit for the first half of the last verse is tasy ̄am vinirgat ̄ay ̄am tu k ̧r ̧s ̧nabhuts ̄api p ̄arvat ̄ı. The clear sense, on which all other commentaries that I have seenagree, is that the first half of the line is a locative absolute, and that the “she” refersto Ambik ̄a/Kau ́sik ̄ı who has just “come forth” from P ̄arvat ̄ı. Bh ̄askarar ̄aya, how-ever, prefers a variant reading for the first half of this line tasy ̄avinirgat ̄a y ̄a tu,which he glosses as tasy ̄a vinirgat ̄a y ̄a tu, yielding the translation “The one who hadcome forth from her, P ̄arvat ̄ı, became black.” That is, tasy ̄a( ̧h) is a feminineablative, joined in false sa ̇mdhi to vinirgat ̄a, and designating the unnamed sourcefrom which P ̄arvat ̄ı came. P ̄arvat ̄ı came forth from “her,” but we do not yet knowwho “she” is. Moreover Bh ̄askarar ̄aya then goes on at great length to explain whatthe verb vinirgam,“to come forth,” can and cannot mean. Just what isBh ̄askarar ̄aya up to, and what seems to be at stake here for our commentator?The key to answering these questions lies in returning to the rudimentary ́S ̄akta philosophy sketched out in the Rahasyas. As noted in passing above,Bh ̄askarar ̄aya rejects the epistemological dualism of Advaita Ved ̄anta, but it iscomparably important to note that, for him, all the different forms of Mah ̄alak ̧sm ̄ıdo not designate ontologically different deities. He remains a monist. The variousforms for Bh ̄askarar ̄aya are simply different manifestations of the same reality.That reality can admittedly be spoken about in different ways, but the differencesare not of major consequence. When ultimate reality is spoken of in its aggregate(sama ̧s ̧ti) form, it is named Mah ̄alak ̧sm ̄ı, or Ca ̧n ̧d ̄ı, or Brahman. One of the firstlines of his commentary declares “the deity named Ca ̧n ̧d ̄ı is the highest Brahman,”who is (quoting Saundaryalahar ̄ı 98) “the queen through whom the crown isinherited.” But when this same reality is spoken of in its separate (vya ̧s ̧ti) forms, itis named Mah ̄alak ̧sm ̄ı, Mah ̄ak ̄al ̄ı and Mah ̄asarasvat ̄ı.16 What is crucial forBh ̄askarar ̄aya is that the shifting from sama ̧s ̧ti to vya ̧s ̧ti forms of Mah ̄alak ̧sm ̄ı, thatis, from aggregate to separate, or moving from the “level” of the unmanifest(avy ̄ak ̧rt ̄ a) to that of the manifest (vik ̧rti), or from the Pr ̄adh ̄anika to the Vaik ̧rtikaRasasya, we are not moving to a secondary or diminished form of reality. Theultimate is still ultimate. The ontological connection is still utter, for reality is avirtually seamless web.

Butthe variant reading that he accepts for this crucial verse provides him with animportant piece of evidence. It gives him a specific reference to the avy ̄ak ̧rt ̄ a formof Mah ̄alak ̧sm ̄ı. She is the one whom Bh ̄askarar ̄aya understands to be referred toby the ablative case “her.” In his own words, the form that is designated K ̄alik ̄a,who is essentially the same as P ̄arvat ̄ı (a matter to which we shall return in amoment), this very form “came forth from the presence of the highest deity(paradevat ̄a: comm. on 5.41),” that is from the unspecified “her” in the variantreading. She is the transcendent Goddess who looms behind all specific activity,who forms the backdrop and underpinning of all particular existence. Elsewhere,using a term that is deliberately reminiscent of Gau ̧dap ̄ada’s famous K ̄arik ̄a on theM ̄a ̧n ̧d ̄ukya Upani ̧sad, Bh ̄askarar ̄aya calls this foundational sama ̧s ̧ti Mah ̄alak ̧sm ̄ıtur ̄ıy ̄a,“the fourth.”17 In developing this point, Bh ̄askarar ̄aya maintains that theverb vinirgam, to go forth, can be used either in the mundane fashion, as in “goingforth to bathe,” or metaphysically, to describe the relationship between the highestavy ̄ak ̧rt ̄ a form of Mah ̄alak ̧sm ̄ı and her several other vik ̧rti forms. But it cannot beused, he says, with the highest form of Mah ̄alak ̧sm ̄ı as the subject of the verbbecause it is improper to impute action to the highest deity, just as it is improper toimpute color to her. Following this line of thinking on the word vibh ̄uti that wenoted above, he argues that this verb cannot be used to describe the relationshipbetween Kau ́sik ̄ı/Ambik ̄a and the P ̄arvat ̄ı from whom she sprang because there isno essential difference between them. They are, as it were, on a par with eachother, virtually interchangeable vik ̧rti forms. What they have in common out-weighs by far the contrast in which they both stand to the transcendent Ma-h ̄alak ̧sm ̄ı from whom they have “come forth.”Let me conclude by suggesting that this admittedly technical discussion mayhelp in understanding the relationship between the different strands of Hindutradition, in particular, the strands of bhakti, philosophy (dar ́sana) as representedby Advaita Ved ̄anta, and the Tantra. Let me do so in heuristic fashion, with adiagram that points toward an aphorism.The diagram asks us to think of the Hindu tradition as a conversation inwhich there are three participants, visualized structurally as a triangle with threevertices. At one vertex is the great mythology of popular Hinduism, as found inthe Pur ̄a ̧nas. Its animating spirit is bhakti, devotion, and its narratives moveunselfconsciously and unsystematically through a variety of philosophical views.Casually informed by ́Sa ̇ mkhya terminology, the accounts are more or less dualis-tic in their ontologies, and in their understanding of the relationship betweenmale and female deities (R ̄adh ̄a and K ̧r ̧s ̧na, P ̄arvat ̄ı and ́Siva, ́Sakti and ́Siva). Theyare also casually dualistic in their varied understandings of the relationship be-tween male and female deities and human beings and of the relationship between"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"88Thomas B. Coburnboth of these and the material world. While Pur ̄a ̧nic myths may invoke theconcept of m ̄ay ̄a in a narrative (not philosophical) sort of way, they basically affirma single epistemology: the commonsense world, though slippery, is more or lessknowable as it is presented to us. The point throughout the Pur ̄a ̧nas is nurturanceand expression of the devotional spirit, glorification of God, or of Goddess, or ofboth. Although the Dev ̄ı-M ̄ah ̄atmya is distinctive in its effort to place the Goddessat center stage, it is nicely representative of this Pur ̄a ̧nic devotional spirit, where, asthe great Bengali bhakta R ̄ampras ̄ad, would have said it, the goal is to taste thesugar of the divine, not to become it.18 The other two partners in the conversation,occupying the other two vertices, are concerned to resolve the tensions and philo-sophical problems inherent in the casually dualistic myths and hymns of devo-tional fervor. What we have met in the commentaries on the Dev ̄ı-M ̄ah ̄atmya aretwo such efforts. Both of them move toward nondualism, but they do so in quitedifferent ways, and so each occupies a different vertex of the triangle.Advaita Ved ̄anta, as represented by N ̄agoji Bha ̧t ̧ta, can “make sense” of theDev ̄ı-M ̄ah ̄atmya, including the puzzling passage we has been considering, byaffirming an ontological monism. But it can do so only by affirming as well anepistemological dualism. Ultimately, the Goddess and her activity and the text arerelegated to the realm of ordinary, less-than-ultimate knowledge. Only Brahm ̄an-without-qualities is finally real.Tantrics as represented by Bh ̄askarar ̄aya, can also “make sense” of the Dev ̄ı-M ̄ah ̄atmya as a whole, and of our puzzling passage, and they, too, adopt a monisticposition. But they are unwilling to ascribe secondary status to the physical world,or to the senses, or to the manifest diversity of the Goddess’s forms. The way inwhich they avoid epistemological dualism is not philosophically, but ritually—through the esoteric, experiential transformation of the world. This is surely onereason for Bh ̄askarar ̄aya’s preoccupation elsewhere in his commentary with theproper ritual use of the text. What differentiates the two nondualisms, then, is thatone—Advaita Ved ̄anta—is of a public and profoundly philosophical sort, whilethe other—Tantra—inclines toward a private and ritualized experience ofoneness.19My aphorism, which I offer by way of summarizing our discussion, is this:Pur ̄a ̧nicbhakti, reflecting S ̄a ̇mkhya, affirms an ontological dualism and so isable to affirm a single epistemology. Nondual Ved ̄anta affirms an ontologicalmonism, but the price it pays for this is epistemological dualism. Tantric nondual-ism also affirms a monistic ontology, but relies on the esoteric, ritualized, experien-tial transformation of the material world in order to avoid a dualistic epistemology.NOTESCharts 5.1 and 5.2 are reproduced with permission from Thomas B.

Somewhat surprisingly, he does notcount sexual desire as among the appetites of the lower soul, but as a degenerateform of higher soul activity. The higher soul desires only to be reunited with theWorld Soul; this, Plato says, is the true and pure form of eros. When, however, theembodied soul becomes subject to external influences through the channels of thesenses, a degenerate form of desire for the One, and for immortality in the One,arises. This is, on the one hand, desire of the individual to merge with the species,which, through the bewilderment of existing in time, the soul now mistakenly seesas the One, and on the other hand, desire to attain immortality through offspring.Other factors enter also, such as seeing, in a sex object, the shadow of the Idea ofBeauty, and mistakenly seeking the Idea in the shadow that stimulated memory ofit. Thus the true eros—desire for supreme knowledge, freedom, and eternality—istemporarily replaced by a false eros—sexual desire.Plato proceeds to describe the physiology of sex (Timaeus 73b ff., 91a ff.).Soul power, he says, resides in a moist substance whose true home is in the brain,the seat of the higher soul. The brain is connected with the penis, and along theway, with the heart, by a channel that passes through the center of the spine andconnects with the urethra. Under the stimulus of false eros the soul fluid in thebrain is drawn down the spinal passage and ejaculated from the penis in the formof sperm, which is able to produce new living creatures precisely because it is soul-stuff. It may be inferred, though Plato does not speak directly to this point, thatthe practice of philosophy (which requires celibacy except for begetting children)involves keeping the soul-stuff located in the brain, that is, preventing it fromflowing downward through the spinal channel. This inference is implicit in thePlatonic doctrine, which holds that the philosopher gets beyond false eros to thetrue celestial eros. Since the false eros draws the seminal fluid down the spinalchannel, the transcendence of false eros must end this downward flowing.What will be obvious at once (though it has never been remarked on in anytext that I have seen) is that this description applies to the Hindu doctrine of theku ̧n ̧dalin ̄ı as well as to Plato’s doctrine in the Timaeus. In the Hindu version too,"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"94Thomas McEvilleythe natural or proper place of the ku ̧n ̧dalin ̄ı (soul-power) is at the very top of thebrain; when it is in this position the yogin is in the state of union with the divine(quite as Plato said of the philosopher). In an unpurified person, however, theku ̧n ̧dalin ̄ı descends through the spinal channel and expresses itself, not as divineunion, but as the drive to sexual union: it is expended through the penis inejaculation. The practice of yoga causes the descended ku ̧n ̧dalin ̄ı power to bedrawn back upward through a channel in the center of the spine. There are sevenseats, or cakras, which the ku ̧n ̧dalin ̄ı may occupy, that at the base of the spine, thatat the top of the brain, and five in between, while Plato mentioned only two, thethroat and heart. As in Plato’s version, the ku ̧n ̧dalin ̄ı power is especially embodiedin semen, and descends in semen from the brain to the penis through the spinalchannel. Various practices are recommended for forcing the semen upwardthrough the spinal channel until it resides in the brain again;2 there its life-givingforce can express itself through giving spiritual life rather than physical.3This correspondence is already so remarkable as to invite interpretation; butthere is more. The Indian texts distinguish many “subtle” channels in the body.The foremost is the channel through which the ku ̧n ̧dalin ̄ı passes up and down thespine (su ̧sumn ̄a-n ̄a ̧d ̄ı); nearly as important are two channels that pass along thespine but outside it (i ̧d ̄a and pi ̇ngala). These two surrounding channels conformthemselves to the icon of the entwined serpents. Between their origin in the upperbrain and their termination at the base of the spine they cross one another fivetimes, that to the right passing to the left, and vice versa; their points of intersec-tion are the five intermediary cakras. Plato also, in the Timaeus (77c. ff.), knows ofthese two veins (which physical anatomists cannot find) that pass along the sides ofthe spinal column and cross one another an unknown number of times (Platomentions only the crossing at the throat). In Plato, as in the Indian texts, thesesubsidiary veins are secondary carriers of the soul-power. Finally, the parallelextends to the imagery of the serpent. The spinal marrow was associated with theserpent by Aelian (de Natura Animalium I.51) and others, as in the ku ̧n ̧dalin ̄ıtradition. There the ku ̧n ̧dalin ̄ı power is described as a serpent that, when awak-ened, slithers up the spine; according to Aelian, the spinal marrow of a man leaveshis body as a serpent when he dies.That these ideas which neither the study of cadavers nor mere theorizingwould arrive at should occur in both Greece and India demands special investiga-tion. A rudimentary form of this occult physiology is attested in India as early astheCh ̄andogya Upani ̧sad, which says (VIII.6.6): “A hundred and one are thearteries of the heart, one of them leads up to the crown of the head. Going upwardthrough that, one becomes immortal.”4 (And compare B ̧rhad ̄ara ̧nyaka Upani ̧sadIV.2.3.) The somewhat later Maitri Upani ̧sad specifies (IV.21) that the name ofthis channel is su ̧sumn ̄a, and that the goal of yoga is to cause the pr ̄a ̧na (spirit-energy) to rise through that channel to the crown of the head. (And comparePra ́sna Upani ̧sad III.6.) The much later Brahma Upani ̧sad asserts that there arefour seats of pr ̄a ̧na, then appears to relate two different traditions, first naming"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"95The Spinal Serpentnavel, heart, throat and head, then eye, throat, heart, and head.5 The Ha ̧nsaUpani ̧sad mentions a full list, loins, belly, navel, heart, neck, and eyebrows.6 It isnotable, however, that none of these passages mentions the spine, and those thatrefer to a channel or vein rising from the heart seem to mean the heart itself, notthe heart level of the spine.The ́S ̄andilya and Dhy ̄anabindu Upani ̧sads describe the central channel andthe two subsidiary channels, and mention the anus and navel cakras.7 The Ha ̧thaYoga Prad ̄ıpik ̄a knows of the arrangement of the three channels, and mentions thethroat and brain cakras (III.50, IV,75, 79).8 Matsyendra, in his Kaulaj ̃n ̄ananir- ̧naya, summarizes the system, giving anus, gentials, navel, heart, throat, spot-between-the-eyes, and crown of the head as the cakra points.9 The ́Siva Sa ̇mhit ̄aspells out the entire system of the three channels and seven cakras (V.56–103).10The relative chronology of these texts is not certain, but may be more or less in theorder in which I have mentioned them. If so, then the pattern with which thesystem emerges into articulation suggests, though it does not require, that thedoctrine either entered India in stages or that it underwent indigenous develop-ment in a series of stages there. Of course, all of these texts contain materials fromdifferent ages, so no conclusion on these matters is available at present. It is equallypossible that there were different versions of the system extant or that differentteachers purveyed it with different emphases.The Greek belief in the Timaeus can be traced to a period before Plato; thetrail leads to the Sicilian and South Italian schools of medicine, which wereconnected with the Pythagorean and Orphic presences in the same area. Theseschools taught that semen comes from the brain and is of one substance with thespinal marrow, by way of which it travels to the genital organ through the spinalchannel, called “the holy tube.”11 This was explicitly taught by Alcmaeon ofCroton (DK 14A13). Croton, of course, was the center of the Pythagorean broth-erhood, and though Alcmeon seems not to have been a member, he shared manyviews with the Pythagoreans.12 In fact, the doctrine of the sperm descendingthrough the spinal channel seems to have a special connection with thePythagorean tradition; it is found in Alcmaeon, in Plato’s most Pythagorean work,theTimaeus, and in Hippo of Samos (DK 38A3 and 10) in the fifth century ...,probably also a Pythagorean.The association of the spinal marrow with the word aion,“life” or “life-span,” in a fragment of the (at least partly) Orphic poet Pindar, affirms theOrphic, as well as the Pythagorean, associations of the teaching. Pindar wasinfluenced by West Greek mystery cults, and Aion, according to later writers, wasan Orphic name for Dionysus, the divine element expressed as sexual power.13Heraclitus, himself very influenced by Orphism, seems also to have taught theretention of semen and a qualified sexual abstinence.14 Diogenes of Apollonia(DK 64B6), living probably on the Black Sea in the fifth century ..., had thedoctrine of the spinal channel with the two surrounding “veins” and of theconnection between the spinal channel and the testicles.15 Plato, as we have seen,"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"96Thomas McEvilleyspoke not only of the three channels but also of the heart and throat cakras, whichin fact he mentions earlier than any extant Indian text. Aristotle also had thedoctrine of the connection between sperm and spinal fluid, and regarded thetesticles not as sources of semen, but as receptacles whose purpose is to retard and“steady” its flow.16There would seem to be some connection between the Indian and the Greekdoctrines of the identity of spinal fluid, brain fluid, and sperm, the spinal channelconnecting the brain and the penis, the surrounding channels that cross oneanother, the cakras where they cross, the value judgment that prefers the highestcakra as the location of the sperm-marrow-soul, the association of the marrowwith a serpent, and so on.One account would focus on the diffusion of elements of Pre-Socratic loreinto Greece from India during the period, roughly the late sixth century ...,when both Northwest India and Eastern Greece were within the Persian Empire.Heraclitus expressed doctrines learned directly or indirectly from an Upani ̧sadicsource—and in fact doctrines related to those under consideration here.17 If theTantric physiology was a part of this wave of Indian influence, then it must haveentered Greece after about 540 ... The type of situation that would provide aconcrete means of transmission is shown by the story of the physician Democedesof Croton. Democedes, according to tradition a contemporary of Pythagoras,spent years at the Persian court, where he met and exchanged opinions withdoctors from various parts of the empire, including India, and then returned toGreece, no doubt full of foreign lore, perhaps including the physiology of thespinal channel. In fact Democedes returned specifically to Croton, where suchideas would have fed directly into the Pythagorean tradition whence, probably,Plato got them. One could hardly ask for a nicer model of a diffusion mechanism.The main problem with this reconstruction is that Homer already has theidea that the cerebro-spinal fluid (which he calls engkephalos) was the container oflife power. Whether he equated it with sperm is unknown, but is implied both bythe fundamental idea that the engkephalos was life power, and because at least asearly as Democritus (KD 68B32) the engkephalos was believed to issue forth insexual intercourse. The connection of the spinal fluid with sperm seems present inHesiod too, well before any known opportunity for Indian influence on Greekthought. The importation of this doctrine into the Greek tradition in the sixthcentury ..., is unlikely, though it may have been highlighted and reinforced bymaterial imported at that time. (The detail of the crossing secondary veins, forexample, may have been passed later than the doctrine of the central channel.)The doctrine of the engkephalos is not only present in the Homeric texts butseems well established there, where it is taken for granted, or treated as a given; itmay, then, go back even to the Homeric tradition, which is known to containelements at least as early as the fifteenth century ... In fact, there is someevidence that the serpent-marrow-seed-soul identity was already in place in theMinoan-Mycenean period.18 Scholars desire some source that is earlier than"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"97The Spinal SerpentDemocedes’ stay in Persia, a source that could have influenced both Homer andthe early Upani ̧sads.A second hypothesis is that the doctrine may have survived into the Greekand Indian traditions from proto-Indo-European times. It is indeed widespreadamong Indo-European traditions. “The head,” R. B. Onians says, “was believedby the early Romans to contain, to be the source of, the seed,”19 and Pliny(Naturalis Historia XI.37.178) describes the spinal marrow as “descending fromthe brain.” There are hints of the doctrine in Germanic and Slavic lore,20 andremnants of it in Shakespeare’s line, “Spending his manly marrow in her arms”(All’s Well That Ends Well, II.3.298) and in Edmund Spenser’s assertion thatsexuality “rotts the marrow and consumes the brain” (The Faerie Queene, I.4.26).But at the same time, there are signs of this idea system in ancient Semitictexts. In various passages of the Old Testament (in Job, Psalms, Ezekial, and Isiah)and of Rabbinic literature, spirit is equated with bone marrow, with brain liquid,and with sperm, implying a system of conduits to carry it among those areas.21Elsewhere in the Near Eastern area, there are also suggestions of the doctrine. Ithas been proposed, for example, that the priests of Attis and Cybele, who castratedthemselves, may have been attempting to interrupt the channel from spine togenitals and thus prevent the sperm from leaving the body and the body, conse-quently, from aging.22 Similarly, Epiphanius (Panarion 1, 2, 9, 26), writing of theGnostic tradition, says: “They believe the power in both the menstrual fluid andthe semen to be the soul, which, gathering up, they eat.”23There is an Egyptian antecedent for the idea of attaining salvation orenlightenment through passing up the spine in the myth in which Osiris ascendsto heaven over the spinal column of his mother, the goddess Nut, the vertebraebeing used as the rungs of a ladder.24 Onians proposes that the djed column,representing the spine of Osiris and worshiped “as an amulet of life,” indicates thesame idea.25 The fact that the spine and phallus of Osiris were found together atMendes in the myth of the dismemberment again implies the channel and theconnection. “The vital fluid,” Onians notes, “is repeatedly shown [in Egyptianiconography] as transmitted by laying the hand on the top of the spine or passingit down the spine.”26 It has also been argued that there are hints of the doctrine inSumerian iconography, specifically in the icon of the entwined serpents and theupright figure surrounded by intertwined serpents, much as in the Tantriciconography of the “serpent power.”27 There is a strong argument for the likeli-hood of this doctrine occurring in the Indus Valley culture also.28 Finally, thefundamental physiological model behind the ku ̧n ̧dalin ̄ı doctrine—the spinal link-age between the brain and the urethra, and the fundamental identity of the brainfluid, the spinal marrow, and the semen—seems to have been extremely wide-spread in the ancient world, though only the Tantric and Platonic texts speak ofthe two subsidiary channels surrounding the spine.This distribution does not seem to me to invite the proto-Indo-Europeanhypothesis; in fact, it is very problematic if the Egyptian and Indus Valley occur-"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"98Thomas McEvilleyrences of the physiology are accepted. In this case, it is possible only on thehypothesis of early Indo-European migrations proposed by Renfrew, with thecorollary of the Indus Valley being regarded as an Indo-European culture.29Since the theme of causing the semen to rise to the brain is found in bothancient India and ancient China—cultures between which important diffusiontransactions occurred early in the Common Era—suggests the possibility of diffu-sion in this case too. But the chronolgy would hardly allow diffusion from Indiainto China. The theme of upwardization is mentioned in two Han Dynasty texts(though the full system of channels and movements is not spelled out until theSung Dynasty), somewhat earlier than current estimates of the diffusion of Bud-dhism from India into China. Indeed, many scholars have proposed the oppositeview: that the sexual elements of Tantra came into India from China, where theyhad been contextualized with Taoism.30But the introduction of the Greek material into the duscussion changes thissituation. The Greek and Indian forms of the physiology both involve the centralchannel up the spine and the two subsidiary channels that run beside the spineand cross over one another periodically, creating the caduceus configuration that isfundamental to Tantric iconography. But the Chinese version lacks this configura-tion. In that model, the so-called Tu channel runs from the perineum up the spine,likesu ̧sumn ̄a-n ̄a ̧d ̄ı—but, instead of the flanking and criss-crossing i ̧d ̄a and pi ̇ngala,another chanel (Jen) runs down the front of the body, joining with the Tu channelat top and bottom. In light of this difference, it does not seem possible that thedoctrine went from China into India; if Indians had received it in the Chineseconfiguration, it is unlikely in the extreme that they would have adapted it into thesame configuration that Plato had—and with the same references to the serpent,which also are lacking in the Chinese version. The third possibility—diffusion ofthe doctrine from Greece into India and China (or into India whence it passedinto China where they adapted the form) is chronologically possible and couldconceivably turn out to have been the case; it nevertheless seems unlikely to be apopular choice, as the Indian version, at present the most complete and whole ofthe three, seems to many to express its parent culture most appropriately, while theGreek version still seems what Erwin Rohde, a century ago, called “a drop of alienblood.”31The remaining possibilty is that some fourth ancient culture diffused thedoctrine into Greece, India, and China (where it was adapted into another form)or into Greece and India, whence it may have passed into China and beenadapted. There seems no other possibility. And there is in fact an ancient culturethat offers exactly the elements needed: one that has the caduceus icon, thatassociates it with the serpent motif, and that is known to have diffused otherelements into Greece, India, and China.Heinrich Zimmer argued that the iconography of the serpent power com-plex was diffused from Mesopotamia into India. This diffusion, if it happened,would have occurred in a number of waves, beginning with Sumerian input into"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"99The Spinal Serpentthe Indus Valley culture and ending with the fall of Persepolis, when many NearEastern craftsmen carrying Mesopotamian traditions came into India. Indeed, itcannot be denied that certain Sumerian and Indus Valley icons are the same iconsin different instantiations. A few examples will make the point.The heraldic flanking composition is perhaps the most characteristic of allSumerian visual trademarks. Where it occurs in Old Kingdom Egypt it is com-monly attributed to Sumerian influence. Several cases in the Indus Valley imagerysimply cannot be explained at present except through Sumer-Indus influence,whichever direction it may be presumed to have gone in, and however mediatedby other cultures it might have been. An Indus seal shows, for example, an eagleheraldically flanked by serpents;32 both the eagle and serpent motif and theheraldic flanking format uniting them are distinctively Sumerian elements. AnIndus seal portraying a ritual of a tree goddess33 shows clearly in the lower lefthand corner the motif, common in Sumerian cylinder seals,34 of a mountain orhillock flanked by two goats with their front feet on it and a tree or pole of somekind rising from its top (Figures 8 and 9). One face of a triangular seal formMohenjo-Daro35 shows this motif again, identical in form to many Sumerianicons. Numerous other Indus examples of this iconograph have survived.36 SeveralIndus seals37 show another of the most characteristic of Sumerian iconographs,often called the dompteur or Gilgamesh: a male hero standing between two lionswho symmetrically flank him and whom he is holding in a gesture of mastery(Figures 10 and 11). A burial urn from cemetery H at Harappa38 shows twodompteurs, each mastering two bulls. They have long hair and seem to be naked,like their Sumerian counterparts (some consider cemetery H to be post-Harappan,others as the final Harappan stratum). In addition, the bull-lion combat, a com-monplace of Sumerian iconography,39 occurs in the Indus Valley,40 (Figures 12and 13) as does the goddess in the tree41 (Figures 14 and 15), a centrally impor-tant icon in both Egypt and Sumer.These icons—the eagle and serpents, the mountain flanked by goats, thehero mastering lions, the lion-bull combat, the goddess and the tree—are amongthe central icons of Sumerian religion. Their presence in the Indus Valley city ofMohenjo-Daro in the strata that indicate Sumerian trade was active suggests thatsignificant cultural exchanges were going on in the Bronze Age between Meso-potamia and the Indus Valley. On presently accepted chronologies, which tend toput the Sumerian flowering of civilization somewhat earlier than that in the IndusValley, it would seem that both iconographical and conceptual elements of Sume-rian religion had been assimilated in Bronze Age India. That Elamite, or someother, intermediaries might have been involved does not alter the significance ofthis chronology.It must be granted, however, that this conclusion seems less certain todaythan it did a generation or so ago when there was a widespread scholarly consensusabout Sumerian influence on the Indus Valley culture.

What was the role of Elam, and what were the connections between theElamite and Dravidian languages? Were the Indo-Europeans on the scene in Indiayet?This revisionist impetus attacks the clich ́ed and long-held assumption of the“nuclear” Near East, especially in its Sumero-centric form. But little has actuallychanged in the evidence. And the revisionists have not yet accounted for theiconographic parallels.Perhaps the key icon involved is the entwined serpents that are central to theTantric iconography of the spinal column with its subsidiary veins. This is firstencountered in Sumerian iconography, for example, in the famous Gudea Vase(Figure 16), where it seems to be the symbol of Gudea’s personal deity, Ningizzida.It is not encountered in the Indus Valley iconography as presently known and, infact, is not encountered in India at all until after the fall of Persepolis. In any case,whether this icon came with a certain doctrinal content or as an emptied vessel tobe refilled is not known.48It is of course possible that a complex diffusion situation obtained, parts ofthe doctrine descending into both Greece and India from some earlier source,other parts being passed from one of these cultures to another at a later time. Butwhat is clear, and what should enter the general discussion of the topic, is that theTantric physiology is not exclusively an Asian element, and that a diffusion situa-tion probably involving some of the factors just reviewed was involved in itspresence in India as well as in Greece. But there may be a still more ancient worldinvolved.In an essay called “An Archeology of Yoga,” I investigated six mysteriousIndus Valley seal images often, whether rightly or wrongly, called “ ́Siva.” I arguedthat all the figures on these seals, without exception, are in a posture known inHa ̧tha yoga as m ̄ul ̄abandh ̄asana, or the closely related utkat ̄asana or bhaddakon ̄asana, three variants of the same yogic function (Figures 17, 18, 19).49 The"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Figure 16Babylonian seal showing entwined serpent pair homologized to human body. ca. 2000...

Specifically, the function of these ̄asanas is, by pressing theheels against the perineum, to drive the sperm-marrow-soul fluid up the spinalchannel. There is then some cogency to the view that where this ̄asana is foundthat physiology may well have been present also. It does not in fact occur in any ofthe places that have from time to time been suggested as providing analogues ofthe ̄asanas—in Egyptian sculptures of scribes, for example, or the Gundestrupcauldron,50 or pre-Columbian seated figures. Some Sumerian cylinder seal im-pressions of the so-called Displayed Female are close, but the crucial element ofthe joined heels is never precisely found in them. This posture can, however, beobserved in ethnographic photographs of Australian aboriginal rituals (Figure20).51 Of course, there may be no connection, but there are so few known cases inall the world’s record of words and images that perhaps it is permissible to reflectupon the possibility of a connection. The obvious candidate is that this yogicposition, perhaps along with certain other proto-yogic elements, may have sur-vived from the proto-Australoid stratum of Indian prehistory.I have said that the physiology of the spinal channel seems, in Indiancultural history at least, syntactically related to the heels-joined squatting posture.Of course, syntax varies and whether the connection would hold for earlier cul-tures is a guess. Still, it is plausible that the physiology of the spinal channel mayalso be extremely ancient and have been diffused widely at an early level of humanculture—perhaps even by that hypothetical wave of migration that brought theancestors of the proto-Australoid peoples out of Africa. The ethnographer LornaMarshall, in her article “Kung Bushmen Religious Beliefs,”52 writes of an occultphysiological power called ntum that is aroused by trance dancing, which bringsthentum to a boil. “The men, “ Marshall writes, “say it boils up their spinalcolumns into their heads, and is so strong when it does this that it overcomes themand they lose their senses.” Indeed, when we reflect briefly on the antiquity ofmarrow cults, known as early as Homo Erectus, this Greek-Indian parallel seemsto direct our gaze into the darkest depths of human prehistory.NOTES1.

Tantrism traditionally has been defined in terms of specific texts calledTantras, the earliest of which cannot be dated much before the medieval period.The Tantras are systematized compilations of elaborate mixtures of psycho-experimental speculation1 and intricate mysterious ritual. In these meticulouslydetailed works, we can recognize older religious ideas and practices that had beenevolving over many centuries. Scholars have dated the emergence of Tantrism asearly as the fifth century .. and reason that it was a pan-Indian movement by thesixth century.2 Such popularity indicates that there was widespread acceptance ofTantrism long before any specific Tantras were written. This inquiry seeks tounderstand how Tantrism gained acceptance in Hinduism and by what meanswere Tantric notions promulgated. In search of inchoate manifestations of Tantr-ism, this study examines the Saptam ̄at ̧rk ̄ as (Seven Mothers) who were the ́Saktis ofvarious Hindu gods.Elsewhere I have demonstrated that the Saptam ̄at ̧rk ̄ as emerged into themainstream of Hindu religion as Tantric deities.3 I contend that these Tantricgoddesses were sanctioned as part of the orthodox Hindu system no later than thebeginning of the fifth century .. The purpose of the current study is threefold:(1) to review images of the Saptam ̄at ̧rk ̄ as dating to the fifth and sixth centuries ..as well as coeval textual and epigraphic references in an attempt to understand whyorthodox sanctioning occurred; (2) to demonstrate that the Saptam ̄at ̧rk ̄ as’ accep-tance into the orthodox Hindu pantheon was the result of notions of kingship asestablished by Gupta sovereigns and that the Saptam ̄at ̧rk ̄ as were religio-politicalsymbols that ensured the success of the kings’ imperial program to establishr ̄ajadharma (righteous rule) in territories controlled for centuries by foreign in-vaders; (3) to identify the banners or staffs held by the Saptam ̄at ̧rk ̄ as in their earlyimagery as essential tools for the establishment of the kings’ victories againstmlecca (barbarian) powers and their subsequent dominion over their lands.Before investigating these materials, however, it is useful for determining"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"116Katherine Anne Harperour parameters to define Tantrism. To paraphrase Tuen Goudriaan, the Tantrasare scriptures that expound non-Vedic doctrine and practices, especially of the ́S ̄akta denomination.4 Tantric stands for a collection of practices and symbolsritualistic, sometimes magical, in character . . . applied as means of reachingspiritual emancipation (mukti) and/or realization of mundane aims, chieflydomination (bhukti) . . . by means of Ku ̧n ̧dalin ̄ıyoga and other psychosomaticexperiences.5 It can be characterized as the worship of ́Sakti or the universal andall-embracing dynamic that manifests itself in human experience as a femaledivinity.6 Both the goals, bhukti and mukti, are conferred by the goddess(es). ́Sivaand Vi ̧s ̧nu have the power to confer only mukti. To quote C. Mackenzie Brown,“. . . in popular sentiment . . . the Bhagavad G ̄ıt ̄a yields only mukti, while theDev ̄ı M ̄ah ̄atmya yields both mukti and bhukti.”7 It is the goddesses’ bestowal ofthese two blessings that is the key to understanding Saptam ̄at ̧rk ̄ a imagery as areligio-political instrument.The central position of the cult of the Goddess and the primacy of theconcept of ́sakti as the ultimate and moving force of the gods in Tantric spheres isundeniable. The antiquity of goddess worship in India, of course, is remote, andthere remains today no evidence to distinguish if the ancient forms of the goddessembodied any notion of ́sakti as energy or power. Even with the emergence of agoddess cult in the early centuries of the Common Era, the evidence for theconcept of ́sakti is not readily apparent. Occasional references to a Goddess named ́Sakti are found in the Mah ̄abh ̄arata,8 but it cannot be determined if she fulfills therole of an all-embracing dynamis. When ́saktifinally was regarded as the solepower of the universe, it most often found its symbolic expression, both literaryand visual, in the form of a divine female septad called ́Saktis or Saptam ̄at ̧rk ̄ as.India had a remote history involving groups of seven goddesses in both theVedic and the indigenous traditions. In many instances, the female septads wereassociated with the constellation Pleiades (K ̧rttik ̄as). The Vedic K ̧rttik ̄as func-tioned as an agrarian symbol of yearly and universal renewal while village femaleseptads either inflicted disease or bestowed blessings.9 Many M ̄at ̧rk ̄ as appeared intheMah ̄abh ̄arata, usually as amorphous bands associated with Skanda. Theirappearance in the epic marked a point in time in which aboriginal mothergoddesses were being adopted into the Hindu fold, but they were without anyclear definition or link to the concept of ́sakti. To date, there is no evidence todemonstrate that an evolved concept of ́sakti as an all-powerful dynamis or aformula for representing the Saptam ̄at ̧rk ̄ as had crystallized during the KushanPeriod, that is, by the close of the third century. By the close of the fourth centuryor certainly no later than the early fifth century, however, the Saptam ̄at ̧rk ̄ as hadmade their official entry into the Hindu pantheon as the ́Saktis of the gods.Coincidental to the group’s formation, the mature concept of ́sakti as femininepower had evolved.

Also the Dev ̄ı divided her bodyinto two halves, releasing the dark goddess K ̄alik ̄a; K ̄alik ̄a was renamed C ̄amu ̧n ̧dalater in the story.11 Although the Dev ̄ı M ̄ah ̄atmya was the first text to haveidentified the M ̄at ̧rk ̄ as, those goddesses who were listed did not conform entirelyto those found in the standard Saptam ̄at ̧rk ̄ a iconic ensemble. Such groups, fromthe beginning of fifth century on, normally included six Deva- ́Saktis (Energies ofthe Gods) and C ̄amu ̧n ̧da; K ̄alik ̄a-C ̄amu ̧n ̧da, according to the text, was not theenergy of any god, but rather part of the essence of the Dev ̄ı herself.In the Dev ̄ı M ̄ah ̄atmya, the Great Goddess grants wealth and power (bhukti)and the liberation (mukti) only after the shedding of blood.12 Passages in the textcontain information about the concurrent state of iconic representation of thesegoddesses including description of vehicles and attributes. The literary depictionsare so precise in fact that they seem to recount characteristics already fully con-ceived in art. The Tantric character of the text is indisputable, yet the Dev ̄ıM ̄ah ̄atmya stood at the very center of orthodox Hinduism.13 A second work, theDev ̄ı Purana, a text of unequivocal Tantric inspiration, was compiled in presentform no later than the sixth or seventh centuries .. R. C. Hazra points out thatthe text’s peculiar hybrid Sanskrit may date as early as the first centuries of theCommon Era or even earlier.14 In the text, M ̄at ̧rk ̄ as or Deva ́Saktis are mentionedin several places in groups of seven or more. In particular, it is emphasized that theM ̄at ̧rk ̄ as should be worshiped by kings.15 According to the text, those who desiredliberation (mukti) would be successful in all endeavors if they worshiped themothers with the prescribed rites.These two texts provide the terminus ad quem of our search for a fullydeveloped concept of sakti and a mythological structure for the Saptam ̄at ̧rk ̄ as.Archaeological evidence indicates that the emergence of the Saptam ̄at ̧rk ̄ as in artpredated the compilation of the surviving texts.

Positioned at thebeginning of each of the three M ̄at ̧rk ̄ a panels is a large image of Skanda, the Godof War, identifiable by his banner displaying his emblem, the cock. The fragmen-tary Udayagiri panels affirm that, by the beginning of the fifth century, M ̄at ̧rk ̄ aiconography had evolved into a standardized group of seven goddesses and thattheir seating order had been formalized.In order to understand the reasons why orthodox sanctioning of the god-desses occurred, we need to consider what the new Saptam ̄at ̧rk ̄ as symbolized andwhy their inclusion was deemed necessary at Udayagiri, a site that had royalpatronage. An inscription states that the King Candragupta II came in person withV ̄ırasena, his Minister of Peace and War, to Udayagiri in the year 401– 402 inorder to build a shrine to Lord ́Sambhu ( ́Siva); the M ̄at ̧rk ̄ a panels, adjacent to the ́Saivite caves, were part of the original shrine mentioned in the inscription.17 Thepanels of Saptam ̄at ̧rk ̄ as are an important part of the iconography of the ́Saivitecaves. The inclusion of Skanda with the Saptam ̄at ̧rk ̄ a underscored their martialassociations; their weapons leave no doubt that they were conceived as warriors, afunction that derived in part from an ancient association of powerful femaleseptads placed at village boundaries to ward off peril.18 The M ̄at ̧rk ̄ as’ victoryagainst the demons of myth was viewed as a paradigm for vanquishing earthlyenemies. Inscriptional information confirmed that kings sought the favor of theM ̄at ̧rk ̄ as in military matters; for example, the fourth century Talagunda inscrip-tion of the Brahmin Kadamba King May ̄ura ́sarman claimed allegiance to Skandaand the M ̄at ̧rk ̄ as who aided him in defeating his enemies.19 His successors in theregion, the C ̄alukyas, stated in several inscriptions that they were protected by theSeven Mothers.20 The Dev ̄ı M ̄ah ̄atmya declared that all the enemies of those whoworshiped the Goddess perished;21 thus symbolizing their martial aspect, Sap-tam ̄at ̧rk ̄ a icons brandished weapons.That the Saptam ̄at ̧rk ̄ as emerged into the mainstream of Hindu tradition asseemingly violent Tantric deities was supported by paleographic evidence. TheGangadhar inscription from Western Malwa, dated 423– 425.., explained thata minister of a Gupta monarch built a temple for the divine Mothers who, withtheir companions the ̧D ̄akin ̄ıs, stirred up the oceans with the terrible winds risingfrom magic Tantric rites (tantrobhuta).22 Another inscription from the PatnaDistrict of Bihar dated to 455– 467.. was written on a sacrificial post (yupa)erected for a bloody ceremony involving the worship of the Divine Mothers.23 It isworthy of mention also that the inscription was recorded by a member of the royalfamily, the brother-in-law of the king Skandagupta.Worship of the Saptam ̄at ̧rk ̄ as as Tantric deities had both exoteric and eso-teric implications. Recalling the promises of the Dev ̄ı M ̄ah ̄atmya and the Dev ̄ıPur ̄a ̧na that the ́Saktis conferred both bhukti, an exoteric aim, and mukti, anesoteric aim, artistic renderings of the goddesses give clues about how these goalswere actualized. The Goddesses’ conferment of mukti synthesized the ancient,primary function—life-giver/mother—and added to it esoteric symbolism with"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"122Katherine Anne Harpertranscendental applications. The Saptam ̄at ̧rk ̄ as were worshiped for personal andspiritual renewal, that is, birth on an entirely different plane of existence, that ofnonexistence (mukti); they liberated devotees from the endless cycles of rebirth. Afuller exploration of their liberating function is available elsewhere;24 here we areconcerned with the Saptam ̄at ̧rk ̄ a’s other function, that is, to fulfill the human urgeto control and to aspire to power (bhukti).As noted previously, inscriptional and textual evidence verified that patron-age of the warring goddesses was sought by kings. In turning to supernaturalforces, they sought positive reinforcement for secular and communal interests aswell as assurances of victory. As part of their sacerdotal responsibilities, priests whoserved as advisers to the king cultivated foolproof methods to ensure victory.Undoubtedly, such a motive contributed to the development of the magical com-ponent of Tantrism and the inclusion of Tantric images among those of a moreorthodox nature. State ministers who were vedic-oriented Brahmins (VaidikaTantrins),25 authenticated the Saptam ̄at ̧rk ̄ as for royal empowerment in responseto state exigencies. Goudriaan elaborates on this matter; he reasons that the publicresponsibilities of advisory Brahmans must have induced them to search for evernewer and stronger methods of safeguarding the welfare of the ruler, the subjects,and as a matter of consequence, also themselves. “Such intellectuals were active insystematizing originally unconnected rituals and designing new methods of exist-ing traditions. Those with mystical leanings who were in contact with yogins—orwho served aristocrats of that type—came to develop interiorized variants ofexternal rituals by a process not unlike that which led to the speculations recordedin the Upani ̧sads...”26In considering the Saptam ̄at ̧rk ̄ as and their relationship to the desire fordomination, let us regard the Guptas, the earliest known dynasty of kings tosanction their worship in iconic form. As I have stated, at Udayagiri, there arethree prominent panels of Saptam ̄at ̧rk ̄ as. Nowhere in India do we find so manyexamples in such close proximity; indeed, they are very conspicuous deities, morecommon than Durg ̄a and as common as Vi ̧s ̧nu and ́Siva. It is also a place wherethey made an emphatic statement by bursting upon the scene with all the powersone would expect of warring ́Saktis. While we may take for granted the goddesses’ability to influence the tides of mortal battles, how they affected for better or worsethe dynastic ambitions of their Gupta petitioners merits scrutiny.The beginning of the Gupta Empire traditionally has been assigned to theyear 320 .. when Candragupta I took control of a small kingdom somewherepossibly in Bihar or Bengal. It is thought that his marriage to the Licch ̄avi princessKum ̄aradev ̄ı strengthened his position and increased his land holdings; perhaps,after this territorial extension, he assumed the imperial title Mah ̄araj ̄adhir ̄aja forhimself and his successors. His son, Samudragupta, in addition, adopted theimperial ideal of Dhar ̧n ̄ıbandha or Digvijaya—the conquest in all directions tobind the country as a single unit.27 The notion of unifying the geography ofBh ̄arata had been established by A ́soka Maurya more than 600 years before. The"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"123The Warring ́Saktisfounders of the Mauryan and Gupta lines shared the same name, Candragupta,and ruled from the same capital, Pataliputra. There is evidence to suggest that theGupta concept of empire was directly inspired by the Mauryas.28 During his reignof forty-five years, Samudragupta made great strides in fulfilling the dynasticaspiration to unite the land of Bh ̄arata. The Allahabad pillar inscription (whichcoincidentally was carved on an old A ́sokan column) related that the king broughtunder his control tracts of land reaching from modern-day Assam and Bangladeshin the east to the border of the present Punjab State in the north and subjugatedtwelve kings in the Deccan.29 He died, however, before the conquest of the westwas completed; the ́Sakas still controlled Malwa, Gujarat, and Kathiawar nearly300 years after their original invasion of India.It was Samudragupta’s successor, Candragupta II, who finally realized theimperial dream to exterminate ́Saka rule in the west and extend the empire fromsea to sea, as had his predecessor Candragupta Maurya centuries earlier. There isevery reason to believe that Chandragupta II sought to exploit any visionaryconnotations engendered by association with the historical accomplishments ofthe first Mauyran king. An allegorical play written during the reign of Candra-gupta II enumerated the merits of the earlier king and his able minister Kau ̧tilya,writer of the Artha ́s ̄astra. The play, Mudr ̄ar ̄ak ́sasa, was written by Vi ́s ̄akhadatta, aminister of Candragupta II30 who, in literary disguise, equated the victories of thetwo kings against mlecca invaders. Reconquest of western India, land crossed bythe major trade routes, meant increased revenues, particularly through possessionof important ports and harbors connecting India with the outside world. Also thelong-held city of Ujjayini in western Malwa was so strategic to trade thatCandragupta later designated it as his second capital after he conquered theregion.31Perhaps an even more important reason for the expulsion of foreign rulemeant the establishment of dominion by a righteous king. The Artha ́s ̄astra, Man-usm ̧rti, Yaj ̃navalkyasm ̧rti and Kamandakiya’sN ̄ıtis ̄ara, four ancient texts on gover-nance, set down the ideal standards for sovereigns and designated that conquestand the extension of territories were primary obligations of a king. The Manusm ̧rtiinstructed that a king should strive for gain with his army and bestow the bountyof conquest on the worthy32 and that the king’s special duty was conquest.33 TheYa j ̃navalkyasm ̧rti emphasized a monarch’s duty to preserve the purity and theintegrity of Hindu society and culture: “The king is the master of all, with theexception of the Brahmanas . . . He shall protect the classes and shall lead orders[sic.] in accordance with justice.”34 The N ̄ıtis ̄ara, dated to the close of the fourthcentury .., was written by a Brahman adviser for Candragupta II.35 The textspecifically stated that those who desecrated gods and Brahmins and foreigninvaders were to be overthrown by a righteous king.36 Gupta kings sought toextend the empire of Bh ̄arata and, at the same time, responded to a divinemandate to ensure the purity of Bh ̄arata as well as uphold the caste system.37Certainly verification of the Guptas’ commitment to establishment of a Hindu"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"124Katherine Anne Harperorder was the celebration of a ́svamedha sacrifices. Such rituals, as well as the lawtexts, affirmed that royal domination was subordinated to the concept of thewelfare of the people and dharma. The king’s duty to safeguard the commonwealwas accomplished in different ways, notably diplomacy, warfare, or any number ofdevious means.Centuries before, Kau ̧tilya in his Artha ́sastra laid the groundwork regardingthe methods for conquest of one’s enemies, either through direct combat orthrough subversive and/or magical means. In fact, he expounded at length on thedelusive contrivances used to terrorize, confuse, defeat, and kill the enemy. A longlist of spells, potions, medicines, and mantras was provided to aid in subjugatingenemies.38 That such a discussion occurred in the text attests to an early andwidespread acceptance of manipulative means for domination; the descriptions infact may be viewed as an early form of bhukti. Actual implementation of magic wasthe particular purview of the king’s Imperial Chancellor (mantri pari ̧sad); the titleitself indicated that, at least originally, the advice given by him to the king had amagico-religious aspect. J. Gonda reminds us that mantrin was the one who “knewthose sacred or potent formulas which were called mantras: apart from the rhyth-mic parts of the Vedas, the sacrificial, mystical or magical formulas, the termincluded also charms and incantations, secret plans and designs, hence mantrin- inthe sense of ‘enchanter’ or ‘conjurer’.”39 The Ya j ̃navalkyasm ̧rti advised that en-emies were to be injured or destroyed by incantation.40 The N ̄ıtis ̄ara actuallypraised Candragupta himself for his power in using magical spells to decimate theenemy.41 Moreover, the text advised use of rahasyakaran—spells with malevolentintent, including the Marana ceremony for destruction of enemies,42 and theNir ̄ajana rite for expulsion of enemies.43 References to sorcery for the purposes ofrighteous governance abound in the text; while there was no specific mention ofthe word bhukti, the implementation of magic as a device for royal dominationwas unmistakably validated.That Tantric goals and practices were acceptable in royal and orthodoxcircles by the end of the fourth century .. was made eminently clear by the writerof the N ̄ıtis ̄ara. His legal text used the word tantra to mean royal prerogative orroyal authority 44 and tantrakusala to mean the science of polity.45 By implicationthese two reference connote bhukti. Furthermore, the writer addressed Candra-gupta as Lord of the Earth, the one who ruled by virtue of his three “ ́Saktis” orregal powers46 and explained that the king, “swelling with the ́Saktis,” marchedinto battle.47 Of these powers, mantra ́sakti (power of charms) was superior to theother two powers, prabhu ́sakti (preeminent position of the king himself ) andutsaha ́sakti (strength of will) because, according to myth, B ̧rhaspati used mantra ́sakti alone to overcome the ruler of the asura (demons).48 Given these references,one cannot dispute the primacy of Tantrism in its relationship to kingship amongGupta monarchy. Apparent likewise was the relationship of the king to femalepower ( ́sakti). Let us return now to the mute stone ́Saktis at Udayagiri with an eyetoward reading more clearly any remaining signs of religio-political portent."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"125The Warring ́SaktisIt is important to acknowledge that the selection of the site of Udayagiri andthe selection of the deities placed there were not random acts. The cave templeswith their icons and their location had religious as well as political importance.The Udayagiri inscription indicated that Candragupta II, “who was seeking toconquer the whole world” embarked upon his campaign against the foreignenemies to the west from this very spot.49 With their base camp located in thevicinity, Candragupta’s forces battled for nearly a decade to overcome ́Sakas adver-saries who controlled the stategic city of Ujjaini and the lands beyond. Lendingsupport at the army’s rear flank were the images of the Saptam ̄at ̧rk ̄ as with theiraccompanying icons of the War God Skanda. In post-Vedic literature, Skandagradually replaced Indra as the divine Commander in Chief. That he was particu-larly important to the martial ambitions of the Guptas is evinced by the namesSkanda and Kumara given to two great Gupta kings. Skanda’s affiliation with theDivine Mothers was affirmed also by the Bihar Stone Pillar inscription.50 Each ofthe three large Skanda icons at Udayagiri, like the adjacent M ̄at ̧rk ̄ as, carried asignifying banner standard. Critical to understanding the power of Skanda and theSaptam ̄at ̧rk ̄ as to confer bhukti are the emblematic standards they carry.Divine or royal battle standards (dhvaja-dana or jarajara) had a distinctivehistory in ancient India and were of the greatest significance in ensuring a king’svictory and the well-being of his country; they gave evidence of the alliancebetween the conception of sacredness and political authority.51 Such staffs werecharged with holy powers. Originally given by Indra to an earthly king, the warbanner was an attribute essential for validating the authority of a ruler; in addition,it was an invigorating device by which he thwarted malevolent forces. The confer-ring of the banner (Indramahotasava ceremony) was an important rite, celebratedby monarchs from the Vedic period on. For the celebration, a special tree wasselected, felled, purified, removed to the capital city, decorated, and worshiped.The king fasted, bathed, and recited auspicious stanzas that ensured his subjects ofcontentment, plentiful food, and freedom from danger and illness.52One story in the Mah ̄abh ̄arata is particularly instructive. Indra gave KingVasu a bamboo pole that was to be driven into the ground, decorated, andworshiped to honor the God. So pleased was Indra with Vasu’s pious veneration ofthe pole that he made Vasu “an invincible universal monarch.”53 When Skandaassumed Indra’s title as Commander in Chief of the Gods, he inherited Indra’sthrone and duties.54 Indra also gave Skanda his blood red war banners.55 Kau ̧tilyarecommended that a king’s war banners should be smeared with a magical potionfor protection.56 So important were war banners that the B ̧rhatsa ̧mhit ̄a devoted anentire chapter to the subject; the author claimed that Indra originally received thebanner from Vi ̧s ̧nu to help trounce on demons.57 Erection of the battle standardwas tantamount to the destruction of enemies. As part of the Indramahotsavaseven minor banners were made of strong and unbroken wood and ornamented.The additional banners, called Indra’s Sisters, were presented with emblematicofferings which the B ̧rhatsa ̧mit ̄a equated with the different gods presenting gar-"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"126Katherine Anne Harperments, ornaments, and weapons to the Goddesses who was created to fight theasuras in the Dev ̄ı M ̄ah ̄atmya. Thus, the equation linked the old Vedic ceremonyto a revised rite that included the ́Saktis and, thereby, extended the ancientparadigm to embrace certain features of the Tantric milieu.58 Although the Dev ̄ıM ̄ah ̄atmya was silent on the subject of the war banners, the Dev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧na furnishedvital information including elaborate descriptions of the Indramahotsava cere-mony and the seven minor banners (in this text they are called Indra’s Daugh-ters).59 In addition, this same text contributed additional information on theconnection of M ̄at ̧rk ̄ as to war banners including instructions for their making,specifications for their insignia, and methods for their proper worship by kings:The king who joins in the meditation obtained through p ̄uj ̄a shall knowneither fear of his enemies nor illness. Through Dev ̄ıp ̄uj ̄a he will not bedestroyed and there will be no arising of sorrow. Slaughter of his troops willbe held in abeyance. There will be no destruction from enemy weapons.There will be no destruction of good, auspiciousness or happiness. Alldanger will be destroyed.60Subsequent verses provided information on the boons and types of protectionafforded the king who possessed the seven banners of the Goddesses:The king who has the banner with the lion of Um ̄a shall know no fear of hisenemies. For one who has the banner with the monkey king, his enemieswill be destroyed and his best desires will be fulfilled. The purpose of theswan banner is to bestow knowledge, pleasure, and progeny on the king. Alldisease will be destroyed for the king who has the Garuda banner. The kingwho has the banner with the tri ́sula of the destroyer of the demon Mahi ̧saaccomplishes all deeds. The banner with the lotus confers dharma, k ̄ama,artha and mok ́sa. The banner with the symbol of the skeleton will beeternally free of fear from animals.61Additional verses instructed that the king who worshiped Indra and Dev ̄ı andpossessed their banners had an increase in fortune and pleasures; also the king wascertain to possess the rightful symbols of kingship.62 It is obvious that the poweronce invested solely in the Vedic Indra to influence a king’s fate later was shared ortransferred to the Goddess. Another chapter of the Dev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧na reiterated nearlyidentical information; however, the emblems on the seven banners were the swan,bull, peacock, conch, discus, elephant, and skeleton. The text, furthermore,stressed that a king who desired power should install the banners and institute theproper ritual for worship of the Goddesses. By doing so, he received fulfillment ofall earthly desires (bhukti) and liberation (mukti).63"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"127The Warring ́SaktisDiscrepancies between the two lists of appropriate attributes need not con-cern us in that a number of variable emblems were assigned to each ́Sakti. Whatdoes warrant notice, however, is that the banners were vitally important attributesof the Saptam ̄at ̧rk ̄ as. Considering these references and the concurrence of theliterary and archaeological data, it stands to reason that, sometime in the fourthcentury .., revisionist Vaidika Tantrins who were connected with the ruling classrealized the a priori significance attached to powerful female septads in ancientIndia and also the weighty authority of Indra’s war banners. They synthesized theolder symbols and imbued them with new significance in an effort to create evermore potent devices to rid the world of unworthy rulers. The importance of warbanners in Gupta society was corroborated by an inscription made by an official ofCandragupta II who boasted that he “acquired banners of victory and fame inmany battles.”64The significance of emblematic staffs or banners held by the M ̄at ̧rk ̄ as andSkanda at Udayagiri now comes into focus. Their political implication was greatin that they connoted divine authority invested in the king; they were symbols ofstate and ownership and they were the conduit for the divine powers needed todecimate enemies. That at least some stone icons had political import to theGuptas has been argued convincingly by two scholars recently, both of whomidentify the giant Var ̄aha image at Udayagiri as an allegorical figure representingCandragupta II after his final conquest of the ́Sakas and the political unification ofIndia north of the Vindhya mountain range and from ocean to ocean.65 Similarly,the Gupta Saptm ̄at ̧rk ̄ as played an important role in ́Saka extermination andrestoration of a righteous empire, but they were more than allegorical figures. Notonly did their victories against demons have paradigmatic consequence, but the ́Saktis were a means by which the mandate of the Gupta monarchs to establishr ̄ajadharma was accomplished. The king’s regal powers, as stated in the N ̄ıtis ̄ara,were his ́Saktis; the M ̄at ̧rk ̄ as were his ́Saktis realized in tangible forms. Theiremblematic banners were visual confirmation that Indra’s or Skanda’s ominousmight had been transferred through the goddesses to the king. For the king to goto war or to rule without these banners was unthinkable; to do so was to invitecatastrophe. A king who was forced to relinquish banners in battle concededdefeat; collecting enemy banners meant subjugation and appropriation of theopponent’s powers. As symbols of the sovereign state, they were the very tools ofskillful manipulation and control.Recall that the Dev ̄ı M ̄ah ̄atmya states that the Goddess confers both bhuktiandmukti; it is important to discuss the latter within the context of a royalmandate. Both the Dev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧na and the N ̄ıtis ̄ara stressed that a sovereign, for thewelfare of all, must embody a fourfold ideal (caturvarga) which included mukti.66Specifically the king had to be so accomplished in his religious duties that heachieved liberation. The ideal demanded the king’s realization of the quintessen-tial spiritual state; to achieve mukti in actuality, however, would have created adifficult a paradox for the king, given the demands of ruling a vast empire"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"128Katherine Anne Harperparticularly while launching large-scale wars. To achieve liberation, normally, onehad to renounce all earthly connections and obligations; however, the Sap-tam ̄at ̧rk ̄ as conferred liberation on the king and in doing so, circumvented theparadox. Candragupta realized his spiritual goal, if even symbolically, as witnessedby his title “great royal sage among kings” (r ̄aj ̄adhir ̄aja ̧r ̧si) given in the Udayagiriinscription; in other words the “king’s spiritual power was equal to his martialstrength and moral superiority.”67Thus, the answers to the questions why and by what means did Tantrismgain acceptance in an orthodox Hindu context are linked, at least in part, to theGupta quest to establish righteous order in Bh ̄arata. They did so by emulating amodel set down originally by Candragupta Maurya and formulated by Kau ̧tilya.The Gupta empire not only attempted to rival the earlier Mauryan empire in itsgeographical expanse, but elaborated upon Kau ̧tilya’s methods to gain and main-tain control over enemies by subversive means. Certainly one resonant note in theparallel between the two empires was the desire to eradicate foreign rulers inBh ̄arata by any expedient means. Building on older models, royal advisers whowere Vaidika Tantrins devised rituals meant to strengthen the king’s powers andprotect the established order. Their reformation of older religious symbols resultedin elevating a female septad from its shadowy past and relocating it centrally in theHindu pantheon. At the same time, the reformers provided the newly evolveddeities with attributes that signified martial and spiritual empowerment, particu-larly for the king. The path to understanding the sophisticated and polyvalentsymbolism of the Saptam ̄at ̧rk ̄ as is circuitous indeed; however, the scarcity ofarchaeological and literary evidence is not necessarily caused by loss, but rather theTantric character of the goddesses themselves. Securing the favor of such enig-matic divinties undoubtedly was guarded vigilantly. Their rites were shrouded insecrecy, obscure mimetic magic, and cryptic language passed on in weighty oraltraditions.68 Only by use of such camouflage could astute rulers and royal advisersprotect the empire from abuse of the M ̄at ̧rk ̄ as’ magical powers by the unworthy.Once the Saptam ̄at ̧rk ̄ as found a place in the Hindu pantheon and the formula fortheir worship was established by the Vaidika Tantrins, icons of the beguilingdeities were located in ́Saivite temples as a matter of course. In later artisticrenderings, the goddesses did not always carry banners; but by then the efficacy ofthe deities in promoting the welfare of the state was taken for granted with orwithout banners. Thus, Hindu kings in succeeding centuries sought the sponsor-ship of the Saptam ̄at ̧rk ̄ as for conquest, control, and liberation.NOTES1.

Other works includePur ̄a ̧nas such as the Vi ̧s ̧nu and the whole corpus of Veda and its culmination in theUpani ̧sads of the Ved ̄anta. Bh ̄agavata liturgical texts consist of Veda as interpretedby the ̄Agamas. Among the schools of the ̄Agamas, the P ̄a ̃ncar ̄atra describes itself asusing a mixture of Vedic and Tantric elements. H. Daniel Smith has summarizedthe P ̄a ̃ncar ̄atra texts (sa ̧mhit ̄as)1 and Sanjukta Gupta has discussed them.2In this essay, I shall discuss early evidence for the P ̄a ̃ncar ̄atra ̄Agama. Theevidence places the ̄Agama in the first three or four centuries ... and connects itwith a consistent ritual and theological tradition that centers on V ̄asudeva K ̧r ̧s ̧na.Bh ̄agavatas believe that, K ̧r ̧s ̧na, together with his kinsmen, is the full manifestationof the Bhagav ̄an known in differing contexts as the supreme Person (puru ̧sa-uttama) named N ̄ar ̄ayana and V ̄asudeva. My discussion will focus on data con-tained in two admirable studies by Doris Meth Srinivansan, “Early Vai ̧s ̧navaImagery: Caturvy ̄uha and Variant Forms”3 and “Vai ̧s ̧nava Art and Iconography atMathur ̄a.”4 Srinivansan’s aesthetic and historical analyses of the early evidence forthe crucial P ̄a ̃ncar ̄atra doctrine of the vy ̄uhas (formations) are subtle and rich. HereI want to build on her thinking.I will do so, however, with two different assumptions. One is that this earlyevidence reveals a consistent Bh ̄agavata system of thought and practice from thebeginning, and not, as she and others have assumed, a gradual synthesis of differ-ing streams (Vi ̧s ̧nu of the Veda, V ̧r ̧s ̧ni heroes of the Bh ̄agavatas, and N ̄ar ̄ayana ofthe Br ̄ahma ̧nas and ̄Ara ̧nyakas).5 The other is that the paradigmatic orientationfor the four-vy ̄uha form (or ma ̧n ̧dala) has V ̄asudeva facing the west, not the east asis usually assumed. I will argue from an eighth century model, admitting thedanger of imposing later developments onto the past. Yet I think the explanatorypower of the model will justify the risk. The Bh ̄agavata tradition itself believes ithas always been a coherent whole and it is worth taking that claim seriously tointerpret the data we have."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"134Dennis HudsonThe following discussion is based upon my recent analysis of the Vaiku ̧n ̧thaPerum ̄al Temple at Kanchipuram.6 The temple was completed about 770 .. asthe imperial Vi ̧s ̧nu-house for the Pallava emperor, Nandivarman II Pallavamalla(731–796). It was constructed according to the P ̄a ̃ncar ̄atra ̄Agama and illustratedtheBh ̄agavata Pur ̄a ̧na in the form it was then known. Its connection to Pal-lavamalla’s imperial (rather than kingly) status, which he gained in 745–746, isexpressed by the temple’s original name recorded in inscriptions and in a Tamilpoem: “the Vi ̧s ̧nu-house of the Supreme Lord [who is King of Kings].” Among theimportant things revealed by that monument, the following are relevant to thisexploration.First, the Vaiku ̧n ̧tha Perum ̄al Temple faces west as do all the Vi ̧s ̧nu-housesbuilt by the Pallavas in their capital, Kanchipuram. In contrast, the shrines theybuilt for ́Siva face east.7 The west-facing direction of a garbhag ̧rha (inner sanctum)and of a standing or sitting icon inside it, means that worshipers face east. Such anorientation has important Vedic precedence. In the ́Satapatha Br ̄ahma ̧na 1.2.5 oftheYajur Veda, the sacrifice of the new and full moon is portrayed as Vi ̧s ̧nu in theform of a dwarf (V ̄amana). With that dwarf, the gods wrested the earth from theasuras (demons). Signifying the rescued earth, the dwarf became the sacrificialground (vedi) oriented east-west with the fire for offerings ( ̄ahavan ̄ıya) on the east.The east side of the vedi signified the realm of the devas (gods), the north side therealm of humans, and the south side the realm of deceased ancestors. Asuras wereleft with the west side. In case of an asura victory, the devas transferred animperishable place of sacrifice to the moon where they could flee to regain power, aplace now seen as the moon’s black spots in the shape of a hare ( ́sa ́sa).8In ́srauta (Vedic) rites, that eastern fire was in the square raised altar (uttaravedi) that represented heaven. If the deity to whom the oblation was offered by apriest on the northwest facing east were to be depicted by a sculpted figure, thefigure would be facing west. That west-facing heavenly fire contrasted the domes-tic fire (g ̄arhapatya) in the round altar on the west side of the sacrificial arena thatrepresented earth, and contrasted the fire in the half-circle altar to the south(dak ̧si ̧na) that represented the atmosphere between heaven and earth.A figure important for our later discussion is the man who played the role ofthe supervising Br ̄ahmin during ́srauta rites.9 According to H. G. Ranade, in ̧RgVeda ritual he was apparently a purohita (priest) to the king or to a poet. He laterappeared as the fourth of the original three priests (the Hot ̧r of the ̧Rg Veda, theUdg ̄at ̧r of the ́Sama Veda, and the Adhv ̄aryu of the Yajur Veda) and was connectedwith the Atharva Veda. Ranade summarized the elements of his duties relevant toour discussion as follows: (1) he sits to the south of the fireplace during thesacrificial performance and supervises silently the performance of other priests; (2)he gives consent to proceed with particular rites; (3) he offers expiatory oblationson the three sacred fires and makes up for any losses caused by faulty performance;(4) he occasionally recites certain ̧rcs (praises) and stomabh ̄agas (soma sacrificial"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"135Early Evidence of the P ̄a ̃ncar ̄atra ̄Agamaverses) and even chants particular s ̄amans (praises); (5) he has to participate in thephilosophical dialogues (brahmodya) that take place during the sacrificial perfor-mance.10 Interestingly, he made his offerings into the fire from the northwest,facing east, and addressed mantras to Vi ̧s ̧nu as the primary authority for therites.11In my opinion, if we coalesce the Brahmin on the south with the dwarf formof Vi ̧s ̧nu as the sacrifice that takes over the whole earth, and both with the fullmoon ( ́sa ́si), we have the ̄ac ̄arya (spiritual guide) of the P ̄a ̃ncar ̄atra ̄Agama. Bh ̄aga-vatas traced their narrative and liturgical lineage from Brahm ̄a through the LunarDynasty, signified by Soma the moon, made of deathlessness (am ̧rtamaya).12 Inthe Vaiku ̧n ̧tha Perum ̄al Temple, that Lunar lineage was connected with the southside of the vim ̄ana (temple).As I understand P ̄a ̃ncar ̄atra thought and practice, during consecration rites(d ̄ık ̧s ̄a), the ̄ac ̄arya“took over” the initiate as refugee (prapanna) and made him orher a “slave” to V ̄asudeva K ̧r ̧s ̧na, the “black man” of the Lunar Dynasty. Therelationship of master to slave was illustrated narratively by the relationship ofK ̧r ̧s ̧na to members of the Lunar Dynasty, beginning with the Vai ́sya caste cow-herds in Gokula, then moving to the K ́satriyas (warrior caste) in Mathura, andending with the P ̄a ̧n ̧davas and Kauravas.The paradigmatic Bh ̄agavata “slave” appears to have been the ruler, as wasthe case with Pallavamalla. The relevance of P ̄a ̃ncar ̄atra ̄ac ̄aryas as the purohitas ofkings is found in their powerful d ̄ık ̧s ̄as by which they could purify any properlymotivated person of any caste. Once purified, they could be initiated into ̄Agamicrites and through them be linked to Veda. Many kings were either classified as ́S ̄udras or barbarians (mlecca), something that made P ̄a ̃ncar ̄atra ̄ac ̄aryas quiterelevant to kingship. The Guptas and Pallavas, for example, had low ritual statusyet were great builders of ̄Agamic temples. Evidence indicates that they usedBh ̄agavata rites in their kingship and represented their ̄ac ̄aryas with the figure ofV ̄amana Trivikrama.Second, the emperor Pallavamalla appears to have built the Vaiku ̧n ̧thaPerum ̄al Temple as an architectural and liturgical summa theologica of the P ̄a ̃n-car ̄atra ̄Agama of the Bh ̄agavatas. Although oriented east-west, the vim ̄ana and itssurrounding prak ̄ara form a ma ̧n ̧dala. The meanings of the ma ̧n ̧dala are revealedby the central mountainous tower (vim ̄ana) which is divided between exoteric andesoteric dimensions.The exoteric dimension is the vim ̄ana’s sculpted outer wall at its bottom, thewestern side of which has been extended to form a porch (ardhama ̧n ̧dapa). Thetemple sculptures face outward toward the surrounding wall (prak ̄ara) thatdelimits the temple area. Among other things, the temple sculptures signify thegeographical and chronological elements of space-time (brahm ̄a ̧n ̧da). They facesculpted panels on the inside of the prak ̄ara that depict Pallava history. The figureson the vim ̄ana’s four sides gaze at the sculpted Pallavas across a surrounding drain"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"136Dennis Hudsonthat appears to have served as a moat. The vim ̄ana surrounded by the moatrepresents White Island ( ́Sveta dv ̄ıpa) in the Ocean of Milk. The Pallava kings ontheprak ̄ara facing it represent the initiated slaves of the Bhagav ̄an who resides inand on the mountainous White Island.The esoteric dimension of the vim ̄ana is hidden by its outer bottom wall.Inside, it consists of three garbhag ̧rhas arranged vertically (Chart 8.1). The bottomgarbhag ̧rha reveals the connection of each side of the ma ̧n ̧dala with a formation(vy ̄uha) of glories within himself that the Bhagav ̄an brings about in order to makespace-time exist. Each vy ̄uha corresponds to K ̧r ̧s ̧na or to one of his kinsmen (Chart8.2). Sitting inside the garbhag ̧rha, facing west, is a black stone icon (arca) of theBhagav ̄an in his complete vy ̄uha form, V ̄asudeva, who once descended into space-time as the dark blue or black man, K ̧r ̧s ̧na. On the outer north garbhag ̧rha wallgazing through a window in the enclosing vim ̄ana wall is a seated figure of thevy ̄uha Sa ̧mkar ̧sa ̧na, slightly inebriated; a five-headed cobra rises behind his head.He once descended as K ̧r ̧s ̧na’s elder brother, the white-bodied Balar ̄ama fond ofChart 8.1Elevation of the Vaiku ̧n ̧tha Permum ̄al Temple"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"Chart 8.2Garbhag ̧rha on the Middle Floor: The Six Glories (Bhaga) and Twelve M ̄urtis"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"138Dennis Hudsondrink. Seated figures of the other vy ̄uhas similarly face outward from the othersides of the garbhag ̧rha, Pradyumna on the east and Aniruddha on the south.Pradyumna, “the pre-eminently mighty one,” is the origin of K ̄ama among thedevas. He descended as K ̧r ̧s ̧na’s son by Rukmin ̄ı, also called Pradyumna. Anirud-dha, “the unobstructed,” descended as K ̧r ̧s ̧na’s grandson by Pradyumna, also calledAniruddha. The vy ̄uha sculptures of the bottom garbhag ̧rha thus identify theprimary meanings of the ma ̧n ̧dala’s sides: V ̄asudeva faces west (toward the asuras),Sa ̧mkar ̧sa ̧na faces north (toward humans), Pradyumna faces east (toward devas),and Aniruddha faces south (toward dead ancestors).Third, following the P ̄a ̃ncar ̄atra ̄Agama, the six glories (bhaga) identifiedwith those four vy ̄uhas are likewise matched directionally (Chart 8.2). All sixglories are represented by V ̄asudeva facing west, who is the “possessor of all theglories” (bhagav ̄an). Moving from the north in a clockwise direction, they arepaired: omniscient knowledge (j ̃n ̄ana) and its indefatigable conquering power(bala) as Sa ̧mkar ̧sa ̧na; sovereignty (ai ́svarya) and its ability to act without beingaffected by the action (v ̄ırya) as Pradyumna on the east; the potency of mantra( ́sakti) and its brilliant conquering power (tejas) on the south as Aniruddha.Fourth, the garbhag ̧rha on the floor above reveals other associations with thevy ̄uhas on the ma ̧n ̧dala’s four sides. Inside that shrine is an icon of Bhagav ̄andepicted as Aniruddha reclining on the snake Sa ̧mkar ̧sa ̧na. He is pervaded byPradyumna’s desires while absorbed in the “sleep of unified consciousness”(yoganidr ̄a). That transformation of the three vy ̄uhas exists as a fetus within thedark placental waters of consciousness fused with matter; the fetus reclines in thewomb of the primordial and absolute Person (parama puru ̧sa) seated below in thebottomgarbhag ̧rha. The middle garbhag ̧rha represents the womb (yoni) that K ̧r ̧s ̧nacalled the transcendent Brahm ̄an (mahad brahm ̄a) into which V ̄asudeva plants theembryo (garbha) from which all created beings arise (Bhagavad G ̄ıt ̄a 14.3– 4 and ́Sr ̄ ımad Bh ̄agavata 3.26.1–31). V ̄asudeva is the father of all forms (murtaya ̧h),which arise from the womb that is the transcendent Brahman. The reclining scenedepicts the fetal son of the father imagining those forms before they actually comeinto being from within himself. The sculpted panels on the outer sides of thegarbhag ̧rha portray some of what “Puru ̧sa the son” imagines, his mind propelledby Pradyumna’s desiring force (Chart 8.3). Those events take place only when heawakes to birth by emanating space-time at his lotus-navel. That realm, which is areorganization of the newly born son, is represented by the garbhag ̧rha above. (Thelotus-navel signifies the fire-pot of the sacrificial altar in the east uttara vedi. Space-time develops within that “lotus of fire,” or womb.)13 The west and north sidessymbolize the span of nighttime, from sunset at the southwest corner to sunrise atthe northeast corner. Daytime is illustrated by the east and south sides (Chart 8.4).The west side of the middle garbhag ̧rha, the side facing the asuras in thedarkness of night, depicts themes of nighttime and of purification and refuge.Nighttime and rule of the asuras represent the condition of human life in the K ̄al ̄ıYuga (Dark Age).

Appropriately, it depictsthemes relating to the initiate’s sovereignty (ai ́svarya) and nonclinging action(v ̄ırya).The south side faces Yama’s realm of dead ancestors and corresponds to theperiod from noon to sunset in the west, when shadows lengthen and “language inthe manner of twilight” is appropriate.14 Its sculptures depict the use of mantra todestroy polluting enemies as nighttime approaches. Notable are the portrayals ofthecakra (wheel) as a weapon of brilliant conquering power (tejas) and thedepiction of mantra’s potency ( ́sakti). Sculptures on the vim ̄ana outer wall belowmake other apsects of Aniruddha’s south side clear. A sculpture of a Boar holdingthe Earth signifies the Bh ̄agavata ruler’s potency ( ́sakti) for “rescuing” and protect-ing his realm through rites guided by his ̄ac ̄arya. Next to it, Mohini, Vi ̧s ̧nu’s femaleform, holds the vessel of am ̧rta that she has taken back from the asuras by playingon their erotic lust.In the discussion that follows, two sets of connections are important: (1) thelion, snake and drunkenness to consecration (d ̄ık ̧s ̄a) into omniscient knowledgeand its power on the north; (2) the boar, the cakra, and the vessel of am ̧rta held byMohin ̄ı to the initiate’s application (prayoga) of mantraic knowledge on the south.We may also keep in mind that the Brahmin assigned the south side of the firesacrifice (the direction of dead ancestors) corresponds directly to the ruler’s ̄ac ̄aryawho performed mantraic rites to manifest the power (tejas) needed to defeat theruler’s enemies and to keep the vessel of deathlessness (am ̧rta) in his possession. Asnoted by Frederique Apffel Marglin, in certain later temple rites at the Jagann ̄athaTemple in Puri, the king’s ̄ac ̄arya dressed as Mohin ̄ı when dealing with tejas in thenight.15 If the middle floorgarbhag ̧rha represented the raised altar (uttara vedi)and the firepot within it, the southern side would indeed be the side related to theruler’spurohita, his ̄ac ̄arya.16Fifth, the top garbhag ̧rha that once contained a standing icon facing westreveals that in his entirety the Bhagav ̄an V ̄asudeva entered into the space-time hecreated at his fiery lotus-navel in his K ̧r ̧s ̧na avatar. The standing K ̧r ̧s ̧na on the top isthe erotic and heroic mode of V ̄asudeva sitting on the bottom. The watery placen-tal realm represented by the shrine in the middle mediates between the two. Thosethree garbhag ̧rhas standing above one another in the middle of a ma ̧n ̧dala expand-ing in all directions replicate the complete body of God. It is a three-dimensionalyantra through that one can walk all around and by which one can employ thesenses of the body to see the Param ̄atman, the Puru ̧sa N ̄ar ̄ayana, the Bhagav ̄anV ̄asudeva K ̧r ̧s ̧na, as he truly is: “The Supreme Self, the Person (puru ̧sa) who is theabode or refuge (aya ̧na) of men (n ̄ara), the possessor of glories (bhagav ̄an) who isthe shining one (deva) dwelling in all things (vasu) and in whom all thingsdwell (vasu), the blessed one (bhagav ̄an) who is a black man (k ̧r ̧s ̧na), the son ofV ̄asudeva.”17"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"142Dennis HudsonTo sum up the meaning of the ma ̧n ̧dala, we may diagram it this way:NORTHSa ̧mkar ̧sa ̧na/Balar ̄amaPredawnJ ̃n ̄ana/BalaInitiationWaking upLionWESTEASTV ̄asudeva K ̧r ̧s ̧naPradyumnaNighttimeMorningSix gloriesAi ́svarya/V ̄ıryaPurificationNonclinging actionRefugeSOUTHAniruddhaAfternoon ́Sakti/TejasSudar ́sana-cakraMantraic RitesBoarIn her article of 1979, Doris Srinivasan discussed a stone sculpture illustrat-ing the four vy ̄uhas of the P ̄a ̃ncar ̄atra ̄Agama. A tall sculpture (167cm), it wasfound in Bhita, Uttar Pradesh. She dated it to the ́Su ̇ nga Period, perhaps as early asthe first quarter of the second century ... The dominant figure is a four-armedcrowned male figure with a decorated body. To his right, facing in the nextcardinal direction, is a standing male figure with a seated lion between his legs. Tohis right, facing in the next cardinal direction and opposite the crowned figure, is astanding male figure without a decorated body and holding what may have been aflask; he appears to be an ascetic. To his right, facing in the last cardinal direction,is a standing male figure with a boar facing toward the dominant crowned figure.As we now find it, that four-sided sculpture is outside the cultic context for whichit was created. There is no external evidence to indicate its intended orientation.Srinivasan assumed that the crowned four-armed figure faced east and she citedthe later Vi ̧s ̧nudharmottara Pur ̄a ̧na 3.44.9–12 as evidence.To my mind, use of that Sanskrit text to identify the orientation of an iconfound out of its cultic context poses a problem because the words it uses for thecardinal directions depend on the perspective of the subject. As commonly inter-preted, they represent the point of view of a person facing east: dak ̧si ̧na means to"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"143Early Evidence of the P ̄a ̃ncar ̄atra ̄Agamathe right and south; uttara means to the left and north; p ̄urva means before andeast; and pa ́scima means behind and west. If, however, the perspective is that of afigure facing west (such as the deity worshiped by someone facing east), then theright is to the north (uttara) and the left is to the south (dak ̧si ̧na); the west is infront (p ̄urva) and the east is behind (pa ́scina). The Dharmottara Pur ̄a ̧na text tellsus that the vy ̄uhas move to the right (pradak ̧si ̧na) in relation to each other, but itdoes not necessarily tell us their orientation.18If, however, we apply the model provided by the west-facing Vaiku ̧n ̧thaPerum ̄al Temple, the meaning of the four sides of the Bhita sculpture is clear. Thedominant crowned figure is the Bhagav ̄an V ̄asudeva K ̧r ̧s ̧na facing west. The maleto his right with the lion facing north is Sa ̧mkar ̧sa ̧na Balar ̄ama. The ascetic malefacing east is Pradyumna. The male facing south with the standing boar is Anirud-dha. According to the model, the north is associated with the lion, with j ̃n ̄ana andbala, and with Sa ̧mkar ̧sa ̧na Balar ̄ama. The south is associated with the boarrescuing the Earth and with the ́sakti and tejas of rites guided by the ̄ac ̄arya. In theVaiku ̧n ̧tha Perum ̄al Temple, the east is not represented by an ascetic, yet themeaning is appropriate and the west-facing Vi ̧s ̧nu temple at Deogarh used theascetics N ̄ar ̄ayana and Nara to signify Pradyumna.19 Furthermore, the modelmakes sense of a variant arrangement that Srinivasan described (her figure 14). Amale figure stands with the lion emerging at his left shoulder and the boaremerging at his right shoulder. The two back arms that usually hold the cakra (left)andgad ̄a or club (right) instead hang to his sides and connect to standing figuresthat personify those weapons. The two hands of the natural arms rest at the hips,but are broken.Again, the intended orientation of the sculpture is not known. Yet, accord-ing to our model, the figure is probably Pradyumna. Since Pradyumna faces east,the north and lion are to his left and the south and boar are to his right. Theinactive positioning of the cakra and gad ̄a and the graceful pose suggest thedetached and nonclinging posture of Pradyumna coupled with his desirable anddesiring nature. In that context, the inactive cakra and gad ̄a may have specificmeanings. Because the basic mantra is generated from the cakra-ma ̧n ̧dala, theinactive cakra on his left and to the north suggests that the d ̄ık ̧sa (of the north) hasbeen completed. Since the gad ̄a signifies power put into action, the inactive gad ̄aon his right and to the south suggests that the practical application of mantra (ofthe south) is suspended. Among the devas whom he faces in the east, Pradyumnarepresents K ̄ama. Other examples of that placement of the lion and boar in latercenturies may also be interpreted as the Pradyumna vy ̄uha of the Bhagav ̄an facingeast.20Similarly, the model explains a fragmentary four vy ̄uhafigure from Mathuradated to the Ku ̧s ̄a ̧na period, discussed by Doris Srinivasan and by T. S. Maxwell.21Although found out of its cultic context and pieced together, it appears to havebeen intended for frontal viewing, which explains its mode of depicting thevy ̄uhas. A crowned male figure with four arms faces directly forward with one right"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"144Dennis Hudsonhand resting on a mace. He is V ̄asudeva K ̧r ̧s ̧na. From his right shoulder emerges asmaller figure with a canopy of snake heads and holding a drinking cup. He isSa ̧mkar ̧sa ̧na Balar ̄ama. From behind the central figure’s crown emerges anothermale, whose head is broken, but as T. S. Maxwell has suggested, it resembles aKu ̧s ̄a ̧na Bodhisattva figure: “the robe over the left shoulder and arm, the waterflask held at waist level, and the raised right hand are all features derived fromcontemporary Buddhist iconography.”22 It is designed so as to appear as if it“stands within, or rises from the interior of the principal god below it.”23 He isPradyumna who is the form-imagining consciousness inside the reclining Anirud-dha sleeping on Sa ̧mkar ̧sa ̧na. His portrayal in the manner of a Bodhisattva with aflask suggests Pradyumna’s non-clinging relationship to forms and echoes theascetic figure that represents him on the Bhita sculpture. As noted, Pradyumna wassimilarly represented by the ascetics N ̄ar ̄ayana and Nara in the early sixth centuryin Deogarh. From his left shoulder another figure emerged, but it is missing. Nodoubt it was Aniruddha.24 With such an arrangement, the devotee did not need towalk around the sculpture to trace out the clockwise sequence of vy ̄uhas; theycould be viewed simultaneously and still keep their relationship to one another.Let us turn to another early piece of evidence that Doris Srinivasan hasbrought to our attention. It is a group of six coins issued by the Indo-Bactrian kingAgathocles, who ruled 180–165...25 They are rectangular and are made ofbronze. On the obverse, a legend in Greek reads basileos to the right and aga-tokleous to the left. It appears to mean either the coin of the king Agathocles, or thecoin of the king of Agathocles. In the middle is a standing male, holding in hisright hand a club and in his left a plow. That figure corresponds to Sa ̧mkar ̧sa ̧naBalar ̄ama, the representative of j ̃n ̄ana and bala. The club may signify his indefatig-able conquering power (bala), because the plough appears to signify his omnis-cient knowledge (j ̃n ̄ana) in the following way. Sa ̧mkar ̧sa ̧na means the act ofdrawing together, contracting, attracting, ploughing, furrowing. Balar ̄ama meansthe power (bala) that is pleasing (r ̄ama). The Bhagav ̄an’s omniscienct knowledge(j ̃n ̄ana) must voluntarily obscure itself if the world based on ignorance is to exist.That obscuration is signified by the liquor that Sa ̧mkar ̧sa ̧na drinks, representedelsewhere by a cup. Sa ̧mkar ̧sa ̧na Balar ̄ama signifies the Bhagav ̄an’s pleasing andindefatigable power of omniscient knowledge that ploughs the field during thepleasure of drinking liquor. The agricultural metaphor is used to describe sexualpleasure, which in turn signifies the primoridial conception of everything withinthe Bhagav ̄an’s omniscient knowledge based on self-imposed delusion. K ̧r ̧s ̧namade those ideas perfectly clear in the Bhagavad G ̄ıt ̄a 13, 14, and 15. V ̄asudeva isthe knower of the field and the field is his transcendent womb. Into it he plants theseed that grows into space-time and all beings within it.

That reading suggests that thefigures on both sides represent the Bhagav ̄an whom the barbarian (mlecca)Agathocles served as an initiated slave (d ̄asa). As far as I know, the only Bh ̄agavatarites that could clean up a mlecca for Bh ̄agavata initiations were those of theP ̄a ̃ncar ̄atra ̄Agama, notably the Man-lion consecration (Narasi ̧mha d ̄ık ̧s ̄a).26 Amale figure standing between the two words is identical to the figure on theobverse except that he holds in his right hand a pear-shaped vase (ma ̧n ̧dala) and alargecakra in the left. The cakra is interesting for numerical reasons; it possesseseight spokes and five knobs that emanate from one half of its rim. What the knobsare is not clear; the numbers, however, can be interpreted plausibly accordingto ̄Agamic ideas. The cakra is a version of the Sudar ́sana-cakra called theN ̄ar ̄ayana-cakra yantra in the Ahirbudhnya-sa ̧mhit ̄a 22.27 Its eight spokes no doubtmean many things, among which are the eight syllables of the basic Bh ̄agavatasmantra (Om namo n ̄ar ̄aya ̧n ̄aya), which literally means, “Om, veneration to theabode (and refuge) of man.” Sudar ́sana, the text says, should be worshiped espe-cially by kings because it signifies both desire (icch ̄a) and the ability to accomplishends (kriy ̄a), and from it come the mantras that infuse the weapons of the king’sarmy. The yantra form of the cakra concentrates the mantra’s verbal and spellbind-ing protective power. In other words, the cakra signifies the potency ( ́sakti) ofmantraic rites to produce brilliant conquering power (tejas) characteristic ofAniruddha on the south side. It appears then that this figure does not representV ̄asudeva K ̧r ̧s ̧na, as has been assumed, but the Bhagav ̄an as the vy ̄uha Aniruddha.In that light, it is perhaps significant that the vy ̄uhas Sa ̧mkar ̧sa ̧na and Aniruddhaare on opposite sides of the same coin, just as they are on the opposite north andsouth sides of the model ma ̧n ̧dala.What about the five knobs? That number points toward the five in theteaching known as “that which has come down ( ̄agama) [to us] regarding the ritesof the five (pa ̃nca) nights (r ̄atri),” the P ̄a ̃ncar ̄atra ̄Agama. There are various sets offive that could be intended, particularly the Bhagav ̄an’s five modes of being rele-vant to humans: the transcendent mode (para); the vy ̄uha through which thesupreme develops space-time and everything within it; the incarnations he takeswithin space-time (vibhava); the iconic embodiments for worship (arc ̄a); and theform he takes as the Self dwelling in the self of each conscious being (antary ̄amin).The list makes clear what ̄Agama means by V ̄asudeva, that is, the shining indwellerof all beings who dwell within him. The five could signify also the categories ofworship that initiates were expected to perform, most of which took place fromthe predawn time (brahmamuh ̄urta) until noon. They spent the afternoon andevening in study and in various disciplined devotional practices (yoga).28 Fivemight also refer to the five central chapters of the Bhagavad G ̄ıt ̄a. But let usconsider them later.As an initiated king, what would Agathocles have done as a Bh ̄agavata? In alllikelihood, he probably followed Arjuna’s model and took refuge in the Bhagav ̄anrather than attempt the ritual and yoga that led to the fully awake status of the"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"146Dennis Hudsonman of true being (sat) described in Bhagavad G ̄ıt ̄a 14 and elsewhere. He no doubthad an ̄ac ̄arya who served as his purohita and performed the rites necessary for theBhagav ̄an to protect his rule. He also no doubt engaged in devotional acts befittinga Bh ̄agavata possessing kingship, including patronizing ̄ac ̄aryas, building Vi ̧s ̧nutemples and sponsoring festivals for forms of the Bhagav ̄an, especially K ̧r ̧s ̧na. AsSrinivasan noted, we know from P ̄a ̧nini and from Pata ̃njali’s commentary onP ̄a ̧nini that, in the fourth-second century ..., such worship of K ̧r ̧s ̧na tookplace.29 We know about the events celebrated then from the ́Srimad Bh ̄agavata,the Pur ̄a ̧na “pertaining to the slave of the Bhagav ̄an who possesses kingship.”Evidence for the type of religious activity Agathocles engaged in also is found inepigraphy and in the Pur ̄a ̧nas. We know from epigraphy that the Bh ̄agavataHeliodorus, the son of Dion, was sent by the king Antialkidas of Taxila as theYavana ambassador to the ruler at Vidisa in central India. Sometime in the secondcentury ..., he sponsored the creation of a Garu ̧da-dhvaja (flagpole) for V ̄as-udeva, the God of gods.30 According to M. D. Khare, the flagpole with Garu ̧da ontop was one of eight in front of the V ̄asudeva temple,31 which faced east on anortheast-southwest axis. The pillar is octagonal, a smaller portion above dividedinto sixteen facets and then an even smaller portion divided into thirty-two facets,the pillar ended in a rounded top.The eight facets ending after multiplication in a Garu ̧da image may tell uswhat the pole signified for Heliodorus. K ̧r ̧s ̧na explicitly identified himself with thenumber eight in Bhagavad G ̄ıt ̄a 7.4 when he drew Arjuna’s attention to himself asthe human form of V ̄asudeva. Eight represents the eight modes of matter (prak ̧rti)that make up the Bhagav ̄an’s gross body (sth ̄ula ́sar ̄ıra), which is our universe(brahm ̄a ̧n ̧da); and they make up the essential elements of our inividual embodi-ment within that universe: earth, water, fire, wind, space, mind, intelligence, andthe sense of I.Then, in 10.30, K ̧r ̧s ̧na identified himself with Garu ̧da, in a set of identifica-tions that matched the “unclean” yet purified status of the Yavana donor at thetime of his unction (abhi ̧seka) as ruler: “Of the daityas [demons] I am Prahl ̄ada[saved by Man-lion], of those who seize the K ̄al ̄ı die [in the unction rites], I amTime, and of wild animals I am the Indra of beasts [the lion], and of birds I am theson of Vinat ̄a [Garu ̧da].” In light of Srimad Bh ̄agavata and Mah ̄abh ̄arata lore,32that sequence suggests the purification and unction of an unclean devotee:Prahl ̄ada represents the devout rebirth of the demonic ego covered with gold(Hira ̧nyak ́sipu) that knowledge finally rips apart; Time decides who loses the ritualdice game during the royal unction ceremonies; the lion’s roar represents theauthority of the ̄ac ̄arya to teach the initiated ruler; and Garu ̧da, made of vedichymns, released his mother Vinat ̄a from slavery to snake-like darkness by stealingdeathlessness (am ̧rta) from Indra—a symbol of the ruler’s protected status as aBh ̄agavata.33Perhaps, then, the multiplication of the number eight upward to Garu ̧dasignified the movement of Heliodorus’ consciousness in consecration from his"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"147Early Evidence of the P ̄a ̃ncar ̄atra ̄Agamagross physical body (sth ̄ula ́sar ̄ıra) signified by the number eight, to his unmanifestphysical body (s ̄uk ̧sma ́sar ̄ıra) signified by the number sixteen, to his causal un-manifest body (k ̄ara ̧na s ̄uk ̧sma ́sar ̄ıra) signified by the number thirty-two, to thefourth (tur ̄ıya) represented by the rounded end topped by Garu ̧da. In P ̄a ̃ncar ̄atraBh ̄agavata thought, however, the fourth is, like Garu ̧da, the servant of theBhagav ̄an, because V ̄asudeva is beyond the fourth (tur ̄ıya at ̄ıta). He is the tran-scendent fifth, the absolute supreme Person, the God of gods residing inside thegarbhag ̧rha before which this pillar stood.Another inscription, from the second half of the first century ..., suggeststhe coherence of the Bh ̄agavata religion into which the mlecca Yavanas, Agathoclesand Heliodorus, had been initiated. An inscription from Ghosundi in Rajasthantells us that the Bh ̄agavata king Sarvat ̄ata performed a horse sacrifice and built “theN ̄ar ̄aya ̧na enclosure as a stone surrounding wall for the worship (p ̄uj ̄a) of theuntouched (anihata) dual lords of all, the Bhagav ̄ans Sa ̧mkar ̧sa ̧na V ̄asudeva.”34The contrast of p ̄uj ̄a as the mode of worship in which priests touch the iconic bodyof God (arc ̄a) to the Bhagav ̄an’s “untouched” status was probably intended, indi-cating an ̄Agamic concern for the purity of the iconic lords of all and of the priestswho served them. The stone wall called the N ̄ar ̄aya ̧na enclosure preserved thatpurity for the p ̄uj ̄a, and its name (the abode of man) plays upon the humankinship relations of the elder and younger brothers housed within it. They werethe human modes of the abode of man (N ̄ar ̄aya ̧na) depicted as dwelling withinthat womblike abode (just as the Vaiku ̧n ̧tha Perum ̄al Temple’s top floor standingicon depicted K ̧r ̧s ̧na dwelling within space-time inside the womb of the sittingicon on the bottom floor).Srinivasan noted that Sa ̧mkar ̧sa ̧na is mentioned first suggesting that thekinship relationship of Sa ̧mkar ̧sa ̧na Balar ̄ama and V ̄asudeva K ̧r ̧s ̧na was the focus ofthe resident icons, rather than their metaphysical relationship as vy ̄uhas, whichwould have reversed the sequence. It means, we may presume, that the representa-tion of Balar ̄ama stood to the right of K ̧r ̧s ̧na. Those two brothers implied the otherkinsmen that make up the five V ̧r ̧s ̧ni heroes (the half-brothers Pradyumna andS ̄amba, and Pradyumna’s son, Aniruddha) who may or may not have been ex-plicitly represented.Representing Balar ̄ama and K ̧r ̧s ̧na as brothers, however, is also a way ofrepresenting the vy ̄uhas Sa ̧mkar ̧sa ̧na and V ̄asudeva. Balar ̄ama standing to K ̧r ̧s ̧na’sright replicates Sa ̧mkar ̧sa ̧na’s emanation in the direction of pradak ̧si ̧na (circumam-bulation) from V ̄asudeva as the firstvy ̄uha to escape ( ̄adi ́se ̧sa). Rather than assumeas Srinivasan did, that the V ̧r ̧s ̧ni heroes fused with a vy ̄uha doctrine from anothertradition (that of N ̄ar ̄aya ̧na), the evidence suggests instead that the story of theV ̧r ̧s ̧ni heroes, K ̧r ̧s ̧na and his kinsmen, illustrated the vy ̄uha doctrine. Their narra-tive represents the manner in which the vy ̄uhas operate in the lives of the initiated(s ̄adhakas). Let me point out only one example of this interpretation, one from thestory of their birth.The story of Sa ̧mkar ̧sa ̧na’s and K ̧r ̧s ̧na’s birth as humans by means of V ̄as-"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"148Dennis Hudsonudeva and Devak ̄ı ( ́Sr ̄ımad Bh ̄agavata 10) may be read as illustrating the processesthat take place within a devotee when receiving mantras from an ̄ac ̄arya. The ego-centered sense of I (aha ̧mk ̄ara) that dominates waking consciousness is representedby Ka ̧msa. It vehemently opposes the Bhagav ̄an’s takeover of the initiate until it iskilled by him. The white Sa ̧mkar ̧sa ̧na Balar ̄ama was the first to escape ( ̄adi ́se ̧sa)from that threatened I’s imprisonment of V ̄asudeva and Devak ̄ı. Transferred em-bryonically across the Yamun ̄a River to Gokula, he prepared the way for the laterarrival of V ̄asudeva K ̧r ̧s ̧na. In that way, he was elder in birth to V ̄asudeva K ̧r ̧s ̧na as akinsman, yet was subordinate to the vy ̄uha V ̄asudeva as the first of the three thatmanifest the pairs of his six glories.In ritual terms, Sa ̧mkar ̧sa ̧na Balar ̄ama’s embryonic transfer signifies the ̄ac ̄arya’s preparation of the initiate’s causal body (k ̄ara ̧na s ̄uk ̧sma ́sar ̄ıra) by using thepower (bala) of omniscient knowledge (j ̃n ̄ana). The causal body is represented byGokula and the Vaisya population of cowherds. Once that domain of the initiatewas prepared, the ̄ac ̄arya imparted the complete mantraic form of the Bhagav ̄anthrough waking consciousness into that deepest level of embodied consciousness.The dark bodied K ̧r ̧s ̧na represented that primary mantra, probably the eight-syllableO ̧m namo n ̄ar ̄aya ̧naya. It first had to cross the raging waters of conscious-ness that separate the gross body from the subtle, represented by the Yamun ̄aRiver. Once in Gokula, however, that embodied mantra began to take over thes ̄adhaka completely. The remainder of the story depicts the dynamics of thattakeover, ending with the slaying of the deluded sense of I (Ka ̧msa) and theestablishment of the embodied mantra at the doorway (Dv ̄arak ̄a) in the ocean ofwaking consciousness. That doorway probably corresponds to the place on theforehead where the subtle body links to the gross body when the s ̄adhaka is awake.According to this reading, the stories about K ̧r ̧s ̧na and his family based inDv ̄arak ̄a depict the processes by which the Bhagav ̄an protects the devout sadhaka.K ̧r ̧s ̧na’s two sons by different wives, for example, illustrate the vy ̄uha Pradyumna,whose glories have to do with sovereign nonclinging action. Pradyumna, thepreeminently mighty one, the son of the chief queen Rukmin ̄ı, and S ̄amba (aweapon), K ̧r ̧s ̧na’s son by Jamb ̄avati, illustrate the answer to Arjuna’s question in theBhagavad G ̄ıt ̄a 3.36: “By what, then, is a person impelled to do evil (p ̄apam) eventhough unwilling, o son of V ̧r ̧s ̧ni, is he driven as if by force?” The cause, K ̧r ̧s ̧nasaid, is desire (k ̄ama) and anger (krodha), which arise from the material thread ofrajas (passion) woven into one’s bodies (3.37).According to the ́Sr ̄ımad Bh ̄agavata 3.1.28–30, K ̧r ̧s ̧na’s son Pradyumna wasthe rebirth of K ̄ama (desire), and his son S ̄amba was the rebirth of Skanda (anger).S ̄amba’s (and Skanda’s) secondary status reflects anger’s secondary yet useful status,because it is the frustration of desire that produces anger. Yet anger may be usefulto the Bhagav ̄an, and through S ̄amba the entire V ̧r ̧s ̧ni clan was destroyed.35 S ̄amba(or Skanda) was not forgotten by Bh ̄agavatas, merely implied by Pradyumna,because anger is under the control of the sovereign lord of desire. (In the direc-tionalma ̧n ̧dala explained to Arjuna by K ̧r ̧s ̧na in the Bhagavad G ̄ıt ̄a 10.21–24,"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"149Early Evidence of the P ̄a ̃ncar ̄atra ̄AgamaSkanda is in the west, the direction of the asuras, and opposite Pradyumna of theeast, the direction of the devas). In the eighth century, Pradyumna and S ̄amba weresculpted together at the southeast corner of the Vaiku ̧n ̧tha Perum ̄alvim ̄ana, and inthe ninth century the Tamil poet A ̧n ̧tal invoked both in her poetry.36The Yavana Bh ̄agavata evidence reveals that at least by the second century..., barbarians received d ̄ık ̧s ̄a, probably by means of the P ̄a ̃ncar ̄atra ̄Agama.Evidence from early Tamil literature indicates that the same was true among theTamils, who according to the Laws of Manu (10.44) had the same ritual status asYavanas: Dr ̄avi ̧das and Yavanas were among those dynasties born of K ̧satriyas whohad fallen to the status of ́S ̄udras because they had given up the sacred rites ofVeda.The ́Sr ̄ ımad Bh ̄agavata provides the narrative explanation for such mleccaconversions and illustrates the purification that converts underwent. Significantly,the story is directly connected to the establishment of the doorway (Dv ̄arak ̄a)discussed above and to the theme of refuge taught in the eighteenth chapter of theBhagavad G ̄ıt ̄a. The Yavana Bh ̄agavata king Agathocles, we noted, was probablysuch a refugee (prapanna).According to the story, after Ka ̧msa was slain, Jar ̄asa ̧mdha (joined by oldage) waged eighteen battles against K ̧r ̧s ̧na and Sa ̧mkar ̧sa ̧na at Mathura whereUgrasena ruled over the Yadus. Just before Jar ̄asa ̧mdha’s eighteenth attack, how-ever, a Yavana hero entered the scene.37 He had learned from N ̄arada that theY ̄adus were equal to him in battle and so he attacked Mathura with three and one-half crores of mlecca troops. That prompted K ̧r ̧s ̧na and Sa ̧mkar ̧sa ̧na to move theirpeople into an impregnable fortress (durga) they called Dv ̄arak ̄a in the ocean tothe west (the direction of Skanda and anger).K ̧r ̧s ̧na then left Dv ̄arak ̄a on foot without weapons but wearing a garland oflotuses. When the Yavana saw him walking, stunningly beautiful with his darkcolor and four arms, he recognized him from N ̄arada’s description and decided tofollow him, likewise on foot and without weapons. K ̧r ̧s ̧na, whom even yoginscannot capture in their minds, appeared to run away from him and to avert hisface. By keeping himself just out of grasp, K ̧r ̧s ̧na led the Yavana to a distantmountain cave, and all the while the Yavana hero berated him for his unheroicbehavior. K ̧r ̧s ̧na then hid himself inside the cave. When the Yavana entered he sawa man sleeping. Thinking him to be K ̧r ̧s ̧na pretending to be asleep, he kicked him.The sleeper awoke, opened his eyes, saw the Yavana standing there, and with hisangry look emitted a flame of fire from his body that burned the Yavana to ashes.38The sleeper was named Mucukunda, a son of M ̄andh ̄at ̄a from long ago inthe Ik ̧sv ̄aku lineage (of R ̄ama and of the ́S ̄akyamuni Buddha). Because Mucu-kunda had been devoted to Brahmans and to truth, Indra and the devas had askedhim to protect them from the asuras, which he did, but after Skanda was born tobe their protector, Mucukunda was allowed to leave that position. In the mean-time, Time had eaten up his family and kingdom and he had nothing to which toreturn, so the devas granted him any boon except that pertaining to the absolute"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"150Dennis Hudson(kaivalya), which only the Bhagav ̄an Vi ̧s ̧nu can grant. Choosing sleep, he entered acave where the devas gave him the boon that anyone interrupting him would bereduced to ash by his gaze. Now, however, he was awake in the cave and K ̧r ̧s ̧namade his beautiful form visible to him.39 Mucukunda recognized him as the bullof men among the three devas of devas, the trim ̄urti named Brahm ̄a, Vi ̧s ̧nu, ́Siva.He saw his brillant form dispelling the darkness of the cave and knew that whoeverhad awakened him was now ash because of his own vileness (p ̄apman).40After identifying himself as V ̄asudeva, K ̧r ̧s ̧na explained that Ka ̧msa andothers were now dead and that because Mucukunda had adored him in the past,he had made himself visible to him. He offered Mucukunda a boon. BecauseMucukunda had once learned about the deva N ̄ar ̄ayana, he now recognized theson of V ̄asudeva to be him and was joyous.41 He confessed that, infatuated byM ̄ay ̄ a, he had forgotten the Bhagav ̄an, and that immersed in the householder lifeof a king he had become subject to the Bhagav ̄an as Time. Yet he was able todetach himself from the royal life and now desired to serve his feet. He renouncedall things bound up with the sattva, rajas, and tamas gu ̧nas and sought shelter withhim, the Person beyond the gu ̃nas.42 In response, K ̧r ̧s ̧na told him to go into theworld with his mind absorbed in him, for he would have unwavering devotion.Yet, as a K ́satriya, he had committed sins not connected with his dharma (duty), sohe should now purify himself through tapas and submission, and in another birthhe would be born a twice-born male, compassionate toward all beings, and then hewould attain the absolute (kevalam).43Mucukunda left the cave and saw that people, animals, trees, and plantswere all smaller than when he had gone to sleep; he concluded that the K ̄al ̄ı Yugawas near. He walked northward to the Gandamadana mountain, “austere, full offaith, having the senses under control and the mind concentrated on K ̧r ̧s ̧na.”44There he halted in Badri at the dwelling place of N ̄ar ̄ayana and Nara and wor-shiped Hari, pacified in the face of all dualities.45The story, it appears, is about a single person with two identities, like theYavana Bh ̄agavata king Agatocles. His Yavana identity, entranced by K ̧r ̧s ̧na, wasburned up in the cave of his innermost consciousness and his older and trueridentity as Mucukunda was revealed. His long sleep represented a fall from thestatus of K ̧satriya to that of ́S ̄udra when rites had been forsaken. The fact that theYavana was a king reflected his inherently K ̧satriya nature, but his ritual status asmlecca reflected his fall or sleep. Now that the K ̄al ̄ı Yuga was near, he was qualifiedto become a refugee and required only one more birth before he could attain theabsolute.The position of that story before the eighteenth and final battle that K ̧r ̧s ̧nawaged with Joined-by-old-age connects it explicitly with the teaching K ̧r ̧s ̧na gaveArjuna in the the Bhagavad G ̄ıt ̄a (18.65–66) as he was about to start fighting:Focus your mind on me, be devoted to me, sacrifice to me, perform venera-tion of me, and so you will come to me, I promise you truly, for you are dear"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"151Early Evidence of the P ̄a ̃ncar ̄atra ̄Agamato me.

The Yavana’s connection to the number eigh-teen is paralleled by a Tamil king’s connection to the number eighteen, also in abattle context where other connections are made to the number eighteen.46 Fur-thermore, Mucukunda was not only embodied by a Yavana king, but also a Tamilking. According to the Cilappatik ̄aram, Mucukunda had been a C ̄o ̧la king inPuh ̄ar who had left to protect Indra’s realm while he was absent. That identifiesMucukunda with a non- ̄Aryan who was like the Yavana.47 It seems, then, that themeeting of the Yavana with the sleeping Mucukunda inside the cave where he hadbeen led by K ̧r ̧s ̧na is a metaphor for the process by which non-Aryan rulers becameBh ̄agavatas. It is a story about mleccas discovering their true inner selves. Conver-sion was merely awakening to the remembrance of what had been known allalong, a knowledge dimly signaled by one’s fascination with K ̧r ̧s ̧na, even as anenemy.Let us return to the plough, cakra,flask, and conch. In her second article,Doris Srinivasan analyzed a wide range of damaged sculptures from the Mathuraregion of the Ku ̧s ̄a ̧na period (c.105–173..), with a few from earlier centuries. Asshe noted, over three-quarters of the icons she discussed are clearly Bh ̄agavata,which suggests that Vai ̧s ̧nava as a label for sculptures may need to be refined. Itmay be, in fact, that in these early centuries, iconographically speaking, Vai ̧s ̧nava isBh ̄agavata. I would like to discuss some of her findings, arguing again that acoherent Bh ̄agavata tradition explains them.Among the pre-Ku ̧s ̄a ̧na sculptures, Srinivasan discussed “the earliest knownmulti-armed Vai ̧s ̧nava image,” from Malhar in Madhya Pradesh.48 It depicts afour-armed male holding a cakra in the upper left hand and a club (gad ̄a) in theupper right, on the shaft of which is a first century ... inscription. The naturalhands hold a conchlike object close to the chest. A long sword hangs from the lefthip. She suggests that it could represent a Vai ̧s ̧nava hero (v ̄ıra) and perhaps wasconnected to Mathura’s cult of ancestral V ̧r ̧s ̧ni hero-gods, although, as she noted,in Mathura no pre-Ku ̧s ̄a ̧na V ̧r ̧s ̧ni hero icon can be identified with certainty.49If we apply the model from the Vaiku ̧n ̧tha Perum ̄al Temple, however, itappears that the figure depicts the vy ̄uha Aniruddha. Indeed, its cakra in the lefthand and the conch-like object held close to the chest, together with the warrioridentity of the sword, resembles the attributes of Aniruddha on the obverse of theAgathocles coin, dated a century or so earlier. As Srinivasan later discussed, theconch-like object and the flask seem to represent the same thing and the concheventually replaced the flask altogether.The combination of flask and conch is also found on the south (Aniruddha)side of the Vaiku ̧n ̧tha Perum ̄alvim ̄ana. Mohin ̄ı holds the vessel containingdeathlessness (am ̧rta) and, as we noted earlier, rites in the Jagann ̄atha Temple in"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"152Dennis HudsonPuri, as discussed by F. A. Marglin, revealed that her distribution of am ̧rta to thedevas implied the ritual use of the conch in the darkness of night—it served as thebody of K ̄al ̄ı for her worship in rites of tejas performed by the king’spurohitadressed as the courtesan, Mohin ̄ı. (That is surely ritual language “in the manner oftwilight” appropriate to Aniruddha on the ma ̧n ̧dala’s south side.) The ́Sr ̄ımadBh ̄agavata tells us that K ̧r ̧s ̧na’s conch represents the principle of water (ap ̄amtattvam) (12.11.14) and signifies his lordship over the righteous administration ofYama, lord of the ancestral dead and supervisor of the purgatorial watery realms ofthe south (10.45.36–50). In other words, in a southern context, the conch sig-nifies the deathlessness of a prosperous life of one hundred years, if the Bhagav ̄anwills it for his slaves. The Sudar ́sanacakra in the upper left hand represents theprinciple of tejas (12.11.14) that expresses itself through mantraic rites to ensurethe possession of deathlessness.The Pur ̄a ̧na also tells us that the club (gad ̄a) represents “thepr ̄a ̧na, the vitalenergy, which includes the strength of the senses, mind and body.”50 Followingthe pattern established by the first century ... multi-armed image just dis-cussed, it is held in the upper right hand throughout the Ku ̧s ̄a ̧na sculpturesSrinivasan described. As she observed:The most frequently represented Vai ̧s ̧nava deity [within the Ku ̧s ̄a ̧na periodin Mathura] is a four-armed standing male who holds a gad ̄a and cakra inthe extra raised right and left hands, respectively. . . . The natural right is inabhaya mudra and the natural left may hold either a flask (kama ̧n ̧dalu) orthe conch ( ́sa ̧nkha).... This type is also found on a series of kinship triadsrecently studied. Within the context of the kinship triads, this figure can beidentified as V ̄asudeva-K ̧r ̧s ̧na; as such, he is always shown as the last memberof a group representing three deified V ̧r ̧s ̧ni ancestors, that is, V ̄asudeva-K ̧r ̧s ̧na stands to the left of his older sister Ek ̄anam ́s ̄a and to her right standsthe older brother, Sa ̧mkar ̧sa ̧na/Balar ̄ama.This placement affirms genealogi-cal rather than theological status. Theologically, V ̄asudeva-K ̧r ̧s ̧na is the mostimportant of the three deities, yet in these triads his terminal position orlesser height than Sa ̧mkar ̧sa ̧na/Balar ̄ama emphasizes his status as the youn-ger brother. To date, certainly five, perhaps six kinship triads are known.51The kinship triad, she also observed, correlates with the basic features of ́sr ̄addharites performed for dead ancestors.The main object of worship, however, was a single four-armed figure Sri-nivasan identified as V ̄asudeva-K ̧r ̧s ̧na, of which over thirty representations areknown, apart from depictions of him as part of a group. She writes:In these single representations, as in the kinship triads, V ̄asudeva-K ̧r ̧s ̧naepitomizes a deified ancestral hero. The gad ̄a and cakra bespeak of a war-rior’s strength and power, as does the conch which is used for signalling in"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"153Early Evidence of the P ̄a ̃ncar ̄atra ̄Agamabattle. No halo surrounds him; the lak ̧sa ̧nas [holy marks] of a Cakrav ̄artin ora Mah ̄apuru ̧sa hardly ever occur. Instead he stands garlanded, crowned andornamented. He is also shown with the multiplicity convention, reservedfor some special Hindu deities alone.52Without discussing each of the items Srinivasan describes, I suggest that, inthose cases where the male figure holds a club in a right hand and a cakra in theleft, accompanied by a flask or a conch, we think of it as V ̄asudeva K ̧r ̧s ̧na manifest-ing the ́sakti and tejas of Aniruddha. The theological basis for that is the vy ̄uhadoctrine, that the Bhagav ̄an contains within himself all three pairs of glories. Thenarrative and kinship basis is that before K ̧r ̧s ̧na gave birth to Pradyumna and,through him, to Aniruddha, he contained them hidden within his dark (k ̧r ̧s ̧na)body. Their later births merely made exoteric what had all along been esotericallywithin him. As a Cowherd, after all, he was both the desirable lord of desire(Pradyumna) and the hero of brilliant conquering power (Aniruddha). Thatmeans then, that in the kinship triad, Ek ̄anam ́s ̄a is flanked by Balar ̄ama to herright and by K ̧r ̧s ̧na as Aniruddha to her left, a pairing that matches our discussionof Agathocles’ coin. It expresses the north-south axis of the model ma ̧n ̧dala; andN ̄ar ̄ayana’s ́Sakti, Ek ̄anam ́s ̄a, unites the two. Accordingly, Ek ̄anam ́s ̄a, “she who issingle or portionless,” appears to represent the Bhagav ̄an facing west; hidden byher, then, is Pradyumna facing east. If the ma ̧n ̧dala were fully depicted, Pra-dyumna might emerge from the top of her head, as in the sculpture discussedearlier.53 Ek ̄anam ́s ̄a, then, suggests Mohin ̄ı. The connection of the kinship triad tothe theme of death rites for the ancestors appears to confirm this identification.The kinship triad signifies the d ̄ık ̧sa and rites that preserve deathlessness even inthe face of Death’s legitimate authority.It is reasonable that much sculptural attention would have been given toBalar ̄ama and Aniruddha together, because the former signifies initiation (d ̄ık ̧sa)and the latter the practical application (prayoga) of it. The practical use of mantraicrites for the sake of prosperous longevity (am ̧rta) no doubt has been the concern ofmost Bh ̄agavatas throughout the religion’s history. The P ̄a ̃ncar ̄atra ̄Agama makesthose concerns legitimate, even if they are not the ideal goal of the fully awakedevotee of true being (sat), always a virtuoso at any time in India’s religious history.It is notable that some of the depictions of Sa ̧mkar ̧sa ̧na Balar ̄ama discussedby Doris Srinivasan explicitly bring the lion and Sa ̧mkar ̧sa ̧na’s plow together,revealing that they do indeed signify his omniscient knowledge (j ̃n ̄ana). Describ-ing his appearance in a kinship relief, Srinivasan wrote, “The god has four arms.He holds a mace in the upper right and a plough surmounted by a small lion in theupper left hand. The natural right is in abhaya and the natural left hand rests at thewaist.” In another portrayal, “Wearing the triple crested turban and single earring,the god is shown resting his extra right hand on top of a heavy mace. To his left isseen a plough surmounted by a small lion.”In yet a third, a two-armed portrayal, “The right hand is . . . raised in front"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"154Dennis Hudsonof the protective serpent hood. The left hand holds an object, probably a gobletclose to the chest. To the right is a mace; on the left is a staff crowned with aminiature lion.”54 Here we have a full statement of the P ̄a ̃ncar ̄atra theology aboutthej ̃n ̄ana and bala he represents. The snake hood identifies him as ̄A ̧di ́Se ̧sa, thefirst [vy ̄uha] to escape from V ̄asudeva and the self-deluding basis (couch or bed) forall subsequent self-transformations. From that primordial snake come the individ-ual snakes (like K ̄aliya) in each person’s pool of consciousness. The mace signifiesthe power (bala) of his omniscient knowledge in the s ̄adhaka when effectedthrough d ̄ık ̧s ̄a. The j ̃n ̄ana itself is represented by the staff crowned by the minia-ture lion; and in other examples, the staff is a plough, which refers to the meaningofsa ̧mka ̧rsa ̧na and alludes to the Bhagavad G ̄ıt ̄a 13–14, as noted earlier.One final architectural fragment is worth discussing from the vantage of ourmodel: The relief shows two figures: a small, possibly crowned male kneel-ing before a much larger god who has four arms and wears a broad, floralgarland. The gad ̄a rests on its narrow base and is supported by the extraright hand placed on top. The cakra is held by the extra left hand which issuspended downward. The natural left holds the sa ̇nkha at the waist, whilethe natural right hand extends downward in a gesture approximating varad ̄amudr ̄a. The dhoti clad deity displays neither nimbus nor headgear. The hairis worn in snail-shell curls, usually seen on the Buddha and Jinas. Thisfeature, together with the suspended left hand and kneeling devotee areunique to Ku ̧s ̄a ̧na Vai ̧s ̧nava iconography. That this fragment may be a lateKu ̧s ̄a ̧na piece is indicated by the treatment of the hair, the suspended handsand the appearance of the varad ̄a mudr ̄a.55Srinivasan included this in her discussion of avatars from the Mathura region,noting that N. P. Joshi suggested it might depict Trivikrama, the dwarf (vam ̄ana)as thrice-strider. I suggest instead that it depicts the Bhagav ̄an as the avadh ̄uta(radical renouncer) Datt ̄atreya with K ̧r ̧s ̧na’s ancestor, King Yadu. The club may infact be the da ̧n ̧da (sceptre) characteric of avadh ̄utas, which was sometimes com-posed of three pieces of bamboo.56On the south side of the Vaiku ̧n ̧tha Perum ̄alvim ̄ana, the side of twilight,dead ancestors and deathlessness, two panels portray K ̧r ̧s ̧na’s instruction to hisfriend Uddhava before K ̧r ̧s ̧na went off to die. The story is the major portion of the ́Sr ̄ ımad Bh ̄agavata 11, and K ̧r ̧s ̧na’s instruction, called “The Summary of theDoctrine of Brahman” is among other things a commentary on the Bhagavad G ̄ıt ̄a12–18. Among its teachings is the use of normally adharmic (unrighteous) acts asmeans to the highest goal, a method appropriate to the twilight concerns of thesouth side. K ̧r ̧s ̧na in fact concluded the Summary by stating the perspective of suchadharmic rites concisely: “This is the perception of the intelligent and of theprudent, that here one attains true being by means of the unlawful, and by meansof the body that will die attains the righteousness that is me.”57"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"155Early Evidence of the P ̄a ̃ncar ̄atra ̄AgamaThe first panel depicts K ̧r ̧s ̧na teaching Uddhava the Summary. The otherpanel depicts the first teaching of The Summary, the story of K ̧r ̧s ̧na’s ancestor,King Yadu, when he encountered the avadh ̄uta Datt ̄atreya in the forest.58 Theavadhuta represents the radical renunciants that K ̧r ̧s ̧na introduced and then setaside in the Bhagavad G ̄ıt ̄a 12, because K ̧r ̧s ̧na’s chief concern in that text was withthe religious life of householders. Nevertheless, Datt ̄atreya’s appearance on thesouth side in the context of tejas was relevant because Datt ̄atreya is elsewhereconnected with the tejas generated by sexual rites. The am ̧rta of those rites isrepresented on the same south wall by Mohin ̄ı holding the vessel of am ̧rta, andperhaps in this Ku ̧s ̄a ̧na figure by the conch held at the waist. According to H. S.Joshi, accounts of the avadh ̄uta Datt ̄atreya describe him as attached to wine andwomen yet not defiled by them, indicating that he represented Tantric rites of theleft hand (v ̄am ̄ac ̄ara) that use the drinking of wine and sexual intercourse asmethods of transcendence. The woman, he suggested, symbolizes self-experienceand wine the pleasure arising out of it.59Significantly, the Vaiku ̧n ̧tha Perum ̄al portrayal depicts Datt ̄atreya tonsuredin a manner that suggests a Buddha or Jina. Like the Ku ̧s ̄a ̧na image, his right handextends downward toward Yadu in a gesture of giving. That gesture apparentlyrefers to his name, “Given (datta) by means of Atri (atreya)” which, in the mannerof twilight, alludes both to the Bhagav ̄an’s self-giving and to the giving (d ̄ana) ofpeople who are themselves given to (like mendicants and avadh ̄utas). It may alsoallude to the important Buddhist story of Vi ́sva ̧mtara or Vessantara (who gaveeverything away), the last birth of the Bodhisattva before he became ́S ̄akyamuniBuddha. His perfection of giving led directly to his complete awakening as theBuddha.60 It may also allude to the non-Buddhist version, T ̄aravaloka (Starlightor Light of She Who Carries Across),61 which may have appeared already inGu ̧n ̄adhya’s first century Pai ́s ̄aci version of “The Great Romance.”62 Because thelate Ku ̧s ̄a ̧na image the left hand holding the cakra hangs down in a manner thathides it suggests that the figure represents just what K ̧r ̧s ̧na taught about suchradical renunciants, who move beyond the ma ̧n ̧dala-, image-, and temple-centeredrites signified by the Sudar ́sanacakra. In R. C. Zaehner’s translation, when askedabout those who seek the Imperishable Unmanifest, K ̧r ̧s ̧na said:. . . those who revere the indeterminate Imperishable Unmanifest, unthink-able though coursing everywhere, sublime, aloof, unmoving, firm, who holdin check the complex of the senses, in all things equal-minded, takingpleasure in the weal of all contingent beings, these too attain to Me.63In discussing the origin of the vy ̄uha doctrine, Srinivasan rightly turned ourattention to two references to N ̄ar ̄ayana in the ́Satapatha Br ̄ahma ̧na.64 Let usconsider each in light of Bh ̄agavata thought. In 12.3.4, N ̄ar ̄ayana appears asPuru ̧sa N ̄ar ̄aya ̧na, which literally means, the person who is the abode and refuge ofman. Praj ̄apati, the lord of progeny, told him to offer sacrifice. Having done so, he"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"156Dennis Hudsonsaid, “All the worlds have I placed within mine own self, and mine own self have Iplaced within all the worlds,” with the same pattern repeated for the gods, theVedas, and the vital airs.65 The worlds, the gods, the Vedas, and the vital airsthereby were made imperishable, as was “the All.” Whoever knows that, the storyends, “passes from the imperishable unto the imperishable, conquers recurrentdeath, and attains the full measure of life.”That story illustrates a portion of the important “Hymn to the Person”(Puru ̧sa-S ̄ukta), ̧Rg Veda 10.90, notably the portion from the fifth stanza to theconcluding sixteenth. The first four stanzas describe the Person as absolute. Thefifth stanza records the absolute Person’s transformation of himself to produce thelimited realm of directional space whose time is measured by the sun and moon.He did it by inseminating his own womb, Vir ̄aj, thereby giving birth to himself ashis son. The son then served as the victim who was sacrificed and turned intospace-time and its components. In Zaehner’s translation, the fifth stanza reads:“From [Puru ̧sa] was Vir ̄aj born, from Vir ̄aj [Puru ̧sa] again: once born,—behind,before, he reached beyond the earth.”66 The sixteenth stanza concludes, “Withsacrifice the gods made sacrifice to sacrifice: These were the first religious rites(dharma), to the firmament these powers went up where dwell the ancient S ̄adhyagods.”Returning to the ́Satapatha Br ̄ahma ̧na story, several important ideas connectit with the Bhagavad G ̄ıt ̄a. First, it says that by understanding the rite properly, thepatron (yajam ̄ana) who plays the role of Puru ̧sa becomes like the absolute Puru ̧saand is transcendent to the changing processes of space-time even while participat-ing in them. He will live a full measure of life, which presumably matches thelifetime of the absolute imperishable Puru ̧sa, who is simultaneously the sacrificialprocess, the victim sacrificed, and the person to whom sacrifice is offered. Second,that teaching is the content of K ̧r ̧s ̧na’s most secret (guhyatama) teaching abouthimself in Bhagavad G ̄ıt ̄a 9. There he described himself as the absolute Puru ̧sawho repeatedly impregnates his own womb (prak ̧rti, vir ̄aj) watching the resultingprocesses with indifference, unlimited by them in the way that the absolute Puru ̧sais unlimited by the sacrificial transformation of himself as his son. K ̧r ̧s ̧na repeatedthat secret teaching again in Bhagavad G ̄ıt ̄a 14. Moreover, K ̧r ̧s ̧na said, he is theabsolute Puru ̧sa who has entered as a human into the space-time to which he hasgiven birth, and they are fools who do not believe it (9.11). K ̧r ̧s ̧na, in other words,illustrated the teaching of the ́Satapatha Br ̄ahma ̧na about the Person who is theabode of man. (We note in passing that in the most secret realm of the Vaiku ̧n ̧thaPerum ̄alvim ̄ana, the sitting icon in the bottom garbhag ̧rha represents the absolutePuru ̧sa; the reclining icon in the middle garbhag ̧rha represents the womb in whichhe has planted his seed as embryo; and the standing icon in the top garbhag ̧rharepresents the human form of the absolute Person whom fools refuse to recognize.)Third, the story illustrates the meaning of the name V ̄asudeva, the shining one(deva) who dwells (vasu) in all things and in whom all things dwell. It also"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"157Early Evidence of the P ̄a ̃ncar ̄atra ̄Agamaillustrates the meaning of Vi ̧s ̧nu, the pervading actor. K ̧r ̧s ̧na identified himselfwith both names and their meanings when he taught Arjuna.In the Bhagavad G ̄ıt ̄a, where he first drew Arjuna’s attention away fromfamily concerns and to himself as ̄ac ̄arya, K ̧r ̧s ̧na said, “At the end of many births,he who has omniscient knowledge (j ̃n ̄ana) takes refuge in me, saying ‘V ̄asudeva iseverything,’ [and] he is a great Self hard to obtain” (7.19). K ̧r ̧s ̧na then describedV ̄asudeva, who is not only the unmanifest reality beyond this realm of space-time,but is the Unmanifest beyond that unmanifest. In terms of the Puru ̧su-s ̄ukta,V ̄asudeva is the absolute Person who is the unknowable Unmanifest, his wombVir ̄aj is the unmanifest matter (prak ̧rti) that he inseminates, and this realm ofspace-time (brahm ̄a ̧n ̧da) is the transformed son born of it. Into this manifest realmof the son, the Father entered as K ̧r ̧s ̧na, son of V ̄asudeva and Devak ̄ı.K ̧r ̧s ̧na then identified himself three times with Vi ̧s ̧nu ( pervading actor). Hedid so first in chapter ten, at the beginning of his identification with elements thatmake up our manifest realm of space-time, apparently following the guide of ama ̧n ̧dala. In 10.21 he said, “Of the sons of ̄Aditi I am the pervading actor (Vi ̧s ̧nu),of the radiant lights I am the sun (ravi), of the Maruts I am the ray of light(mar ̄ıci), of the constellations I am the moon ( ́sa ́si).” Those elements describe thenorth side of the ma ̧n ̧dala.67 They all suggest the breaking light of the predawnbrahmamuh ̄urta concluding the night of the full moon, and they bring togethersnake and lion with the Brahmin supervisor of the sacrifice: Vi ̧s ̧nu the ̄ac ̄arya islike a lion waking and roaring in the mountains to the north,68 while the sun’sradiant light dimly emerges in the east, the Maruts shine in the mountains withthe brilliance of serpents,69 and the full moon, whose spots signify the sacrifice,moves toward the west.Vi ̧s ̧nu’s identity as a son of ̄Aditi (aditya) is telling. On the one hand itconnects him to the sun emerging in the east, who was an ̄Aditya. On the other, itconnects him to the sacrifice represented by the dwarf (v ̄amana) who took all threerealms of the universe relevant to humans (earth, atmosphere, heaven) away fromtheasuras in the west. In the ́Sr ̄ımad Bh ̄agavata, that dwarf form of Vi ̧s ̧nu isdescribed as the son of ̄Aditi (8.16–23), and he appears to represent the ̄ac ̄arya.TheBhagavad G ̄ıt ̄a stanza (10.21) thus begins with the dwarf and ends withthe moon, replicating the beginning and the ending of ́Satapatha Br ̄ahma ̧na 1.2.5,where the preparation of the sacrificial arena (vedi) is described. The supervisor ofthose preparations, we recall, was the Brahmin who sat to the south and facednorth, a purohita whom I suggested appears as the P ̄a ̃ncar ̄atra ̄ac ̄arya. By identify-ing himself with the pervading actor, son of ̄Aditi, right at the beginning, K ̧r ̧s ̧nasuggested that he was that Brahmin priest/purohita/ ̄ac ̄arya. Like the dwarf, the ̄ac ̄arya held within himself, by means of mantra, the entirety of the sacrifice.The other two uses of Vi ̧s ̧nu occur in the next chapter, when, with a divineeye, Arjuna perceived the all-consuming nature of the Puru ̧sa. In terms of thePuru ̧sa-s ̄ukta and the ́Satapatha Brahmana story, he saw the Person who is the"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"158Dennis Hudsonabode of man (pur ̄usa n ̄ar ̄aya ̧na) as Time, the sacrificial process eating up what hehad begotten. Twice Arjuna named that terrifying process Vi ̧s ̧nu, the pervadingactor (11.24 and 11.30).Let us now turn to the second appearance of Puru ̧sa N ̄ar ̄ayana in the ́Satapatha Br ̄ahama ̧na. In 13.6.1–2, we are told that Puru ̧sa N ̄ar ̄ayana wanted topass over all beings and alone be everything in the universe. He did it by means ofa five-day sacrifice called the Puru ̧samedha. In it, the Puru ̧sa is the victim (medha),who is born from a forty-day rite identified with Vir ̄aj. The five-day ceremony,then, illustrates Puru ̧sa-s ̄ukta 5–16. Throughout the discussion of the rites, thenumber five controls the symbolism (13.6.1.7) and alludes to the crucial fifthstanza of the Puru ̧sa-s ̄ukta. We may assume that the five days of the ceremony aredetermined by the phases of the moon, so that five nights (p ̄anca r ̄atri) determinethe five days. On the middle day, when victims are sacrificed, the rites take place allnight (atir ̄atri). The five-fold sequence of the Puru ̧samedha thus appears to con-stitute the source of that regarding the five nights (p ̄a ̃ncar ̄atra) which has comedown to us ( ̄agama). The meaning of Puru ̧samedha, the text explains, is that thePuru ̧sa who dwells within this universe eats whatever is here as its food (medha).Moreover, since the five-fold sequence symbolically sacrifices humans (puru ̧sa)that are fit victims (medha) on the middle day, it is also called the Puru ̧samedha(13.6.2.1–2). The five days are arranged like a barley-corn, it says, with the largestsacrifice occurring in the middle (the all-night Atir ̄atra); the less complex Ukthyasacrifices occur on the day before and the day after it; and the even less complexAgni ̧s ̧toma sacrifices occur at the beginning and at the end.70The emergent pattern important here is this: The first and fifth days sharethe same theme; the second and fourth days share the same theme; and the mostimportant third day is unique, extends through the night, and involves a litanycalled the Puru ̧sa N ̄ar ̄ayana. The pattern is two plus two plus one. Four is tran-scended by a fifth and that fifth is the center. P ̄a ̃ncar ̄atra, then, may refer specifi-cally to that unique fifth night, and the P ̄a ̃ncar ̄atra ̄Agama may then be understoodas that which has come down to us regarding the fifth night (that is the center).On that central day, the Brahmin sitting on the south praises the four menwho have been bound to the sacrificial stakes as the victims. (Later in the cere-mony they are replaced by animals.) They represent the four classes (var ̧na) thatemerged from the head, shoulders, abdomen, and feet of the newly born Puru ̧sawhen he was sacrificed. The Brahmin praises them with the Puru ̧sa N ̄ar ̄ayana, alitany consisting of the Puru ̧sa-s ̄ukta ( ̧Rg Veda 10.90) and the Uttara N ̄ar ̄ayana(Taittir ̄ıya Ara ̧nyaka 3.13). The patron will also use the latter at the end of the fivedays.71Significantly, after the five days of rites were complete, if the patron was aBrahmin, he had two choices. He could place the two fires of the ́srauta rites intohis own self, worship the sun with the Uttara N ̄ar ̄ayana, and go off to the forestwithout looking back. He then became a radical renunciant, a sanny ̄asin, no longerattached to Vedic rites. Or, he could stay in the village, place the two fires back into"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"159Early Evidence of the P ̄a ̃ncar ̄atra ̄Agamahis churning sticks, and after worshipping the sun with the Uttara N ̄ar ̄ayana, liveat home and offer whatever sacrifices he could afford (13.6.2.20). In both cases,the patron passed over all beings and became everything in the universe. Presum-ably, he lived with the faith that he now possessed the lifetime of the absolutePuru ̧sa and was ultimately beyond the many deaths signified by the movements ofthe sun and moon within directional space.When we apply the information from that account of Puru ̧sa N ̄ar ̄ayana totheBhagavad G ̄ıt ̄a, important patterns emerge in that text. Let me suggest whatsome of them are. In chapters 7 and 8, K ̧r ̧s ̧na (the ̄ac ̄arya) drew his discipleArjuna’s attention to himself and his own identity as V ̄asudeva who is Puru ̧saN ̄ar ̄ayana, the Shining One who indwells all things and in whom all things dwell,the Person who is the abode (and refuge) of man. In chapters 10 and 11, K ̧r ̧s ̧nabegan to instruct Arjuna in the mysteries of the Bhagav ̄an (apparently) by reveal-ing the various meanings of the cakra ma ̧n ̧dala, among which were the directionsand realms of space-time within himself. Then he enabled the initiate to seePuru ̧sa N ̄ar ̄ayana as Puru ̧samedha, the Person who eats his own creations, thePerson who eats humans. Awestruck by that preparation, the disciple Arjuna wasnow prepared for the central teachings of the Bh ̄agavata religion. Those centralteachings consist of the next five chapters, 12–16. At the beginning of chapter 12,K ̧r ̧s ̧na discussed two alternatives with which the five-part Puru ̧samedha ends, thatof the radical renunciant and that of the householder. The teachings that followcorrespond in pattern to the five-fold sequence of the Puru ̧samedha ceremony,chapter 14 matching the all-night sacrifice and its Puru ̧sa N ̄ar ̄ayana litany.Indeed, at the beginning of chapter 14, K ̧r ̧s ̧na told Arjuna that he wouldnow tell him the highest knowledge of omniscient knowledge that leads itsknowers to a mode of being equivalent to his own; as K ̧r ̧s ̧na said in stanzas one andtwo:Further, I shall proclaim the supreme, the highest knowledge of omniscientknowledge, knowing which, all sages passed to the supreme attainment.Taking refuge in this knowledge, they reached a rank equal to mine, and inthe emanation they are not born and in the dissolution they are notdistressed.In other words, what he taught here corresponds to the content of thePuru ̧sa N ̄ar ̄ayana litany and leads to the goal promised by both accounts of Puru ̧saN ̄ar ̄ayana in the ́Satapatha Br ̄ahma ̧na. The sages had become free of the son andhad become like the father, the absolute Person. Not surprisingly, then, in the nexttwo stanzas of the central chapter 14, K ̧r ̧s ̧na turned immediately to the meaning ofthe crucial fifth stanza of the Puru ̧sa-Sukta, where Vir ̄aj is the Person’s womb.Here, K ̧r ̧s ̧na called that Vir ̄aj “my womb, transcendent Brahman” (mama yonirmahad brahma):"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"160Dennis HudsonMy womb is the Great Brahman and I plant the embryo in it: the origin ofall living beings arises from that, O son of Bh ̄arata. In all wombs, O son ofKunt ̄ı, whatever forms originate, of them the Great Brahman is the womband I am the father who gives the seed.Consistent with the five-fold Puru ̧samedha barley-corn pattern, the chapters sur-rounding chapter 14 share themes in the following way: The immediately enclos-ing chapters 13 and 15 treat the theme of the knower of the field and the field heknows (13), and then of the cosmic tree that grows from his planting the seed inthat field (15). K ̧r ̧s ̧na told Arjuna to cut it at its root with the ax of nonclinging.The outer encompassing chapters 12 and 16 treat the theme of differing kinds ofpeople, the sons of light (daiva) (12) and the sons of darkness (asuras) (16).Let us consider how these patterns relate to phases of the moon and to themodelma ̧n ̧dala. We assume that the crucial middle sacrifice of the Puru ̧samedhawent through the night because that was the night of the full moon. The ritesbegan on the day of the fourteenth moon and continued throughout the appear-ance of the full moon, ending with the beginning of the next day’s rites beforesunrise, those of the full moon and fifteenth day. That most important sacrificecorresponding to the full moon was signified by the moon itself: It bore the marksof sacrifice ( ́sa ́si) that could be seen when the moon was full. Following that lead,we can see that the discussion of the sons of darkness in the sixteenth chapter fallson the first day of the dark half (k ̧r ̧s ̧na pak ̧sa) of the month, which is the sixteenthmoon. Moreover, the important transition of the eleventh chapter corresponds tothe important ritual role that the eleventh (ekada ́si) day plays in the monthlycalendar of Bh ̄agavatas. Furthermore, the first chapter of the Bhagavad G ̄ıt ̄a corre-sponds to the day after the new moon night, while the ending of householderissues with the sixth chapter corresponds to ́Sa ̧s ̧thi (the Sixth), a day and a goddessconcerned with progeny and Skanda’s birth and maturation.When we apply the ma ̧n ̧dala model of the Vaiku ̧n ̧tha Perum ̄al to thesecrucial chapters of the Bhagavad G ̄ıt ̄a, we see the following. The teachings on thehouseholder fire in chapters 1–6 took place in the west, because that was thelocation of the g ̄arhapatyafire in the sacrificial arena. In chapters 7–11, whenK ̧r ̧s ̧na (the ̄ac ̄arya) began teaching Arjuna about V ̄asudeva, they likewise remainedon the west side of the ma ̧n ̧dala that represented the eastern raised altar (uttaravedi), focussed on a cakra-ma ̧n ̧dala that generated the fundamental mantra, OmNamo N ̄ar ̄aya ̧naya.In chapter 12, K ̧r ̧s ̧na the ̄ac ̄arya began the teachings regarding the five nightsor regarding the fifth night (p ̄a ̃ncar ̄atra) that explain the four-vy ̄uha ma ̧n ̧dala. Inchapter 13, he deepened those teachings referring still to the west side and thevy ̄uha V ̄asudeva, the possessor of glories. Those two chapters corresponded to thefirst two days of the Puru ̧samedha sequence.In chapter 14, K ̧r ̧s ̧na explained the north side.

There theinitiate’sai ́svarya and v ̄ırya, expressing Pradyumna, are represented by the morn-ing between sunrise and noon, by the s ̄adhaka’s liturgical activity (karma) ad-dressed to the Devas, and by a nonclinging relation to their fruits. It correspondedto the fourth day of the Puru ̧samedha.In chapter 16, K ̧r ̧s ̧na explained the south side where the ́sakti of Aniruddhamay be used to generate tejas under the guidance of the supervising ̄ac ̄arya(Brahmin of the ́srauta sacrifices).Tejas would be used to keep deathlessness(am ̧rta) on the side of the s ̄adhaka, a son of light (daiva) in danger of beingoverwhelmed by the sons of darkness (asuras) as twilight turns to night. The guidefor that son of light, K ̧r ̧s ̧na said, is ́s ̄astra (scripture) (16.23–24). Its prescriptionscounter the whims of desire (kama). Included in that sastra, presumably, would bethe type of rites found in such P ̄a ̃ncar ̄atra texts as the Jay ̄akhy ̄a Sa ̧mhit ̄a, Ahir-budhnya Sa ̧mhit ̄a and the P ̄adma Sa ̧mhit ̄a, which are alluded to in panels on thesouth side of the Vaiku ̧n ̧tha Perum ̄al Temple. It corresponded to the fifth and finalday of the Puru ̧samedha sequence.In chapter 17, K ̧r ̧s ̧na returned to the west side. With the central mysteriesnow revealed, he addressed issues posed to initiated Bh ̄agavatas who live in thewestern darkness of nighttime where asuras dominate. Accordingly, Arjuna askedK ̧r ̧s ̧na about religious people who rejected ́s ̄astra yet performed acts resemblingthose of Bh ̄agavatas. How were they to be understood? K ̧r ̧s ̧na explained that itdepended on the nature of their faith ( ́sraddh ̄a). Among them were householdersdominated by sattva gu ̧na who sacrificed to the Devas, householders dominated byrajas gu ̧na who sacrificed to the yak ̧sas (local gods) and r ̄ak ̧sasas (demons), andhouseholders dominated by tamas gu ̧na who sacrificed to the dead and to gather-ings of the living. There were also people who mortified themselves savagelyagainst the rules of ́s ̄astra (17.4 –6). They all practiced religious rites relating tofood, sacrifice,tapas, and giving, he explained. Interestingly, in each case, thepractices of those dominated by tamas in K ̧r ̧s ̧na’s explanation appear to correspondto those of the householder patrons of the ́srama ̧nas (ascetics). They worshipeddead heroes (pret ̄an) in funeral mounds (st ̄upas) and sacrificed to gatherings of theliving (bh ̄uta ga ̧n ̄am) through alms given to bhik ̧sus.72 In Bh ̄agavata thought, theBuddhist, Jaina, and ̄Ajivikabhik ̧sus were judged to be sons of darkness deluded bythe Bhagav ̄an himself. K ̧r ̧s ̧na concluded by instructing Arjuna in the mantraBh ̄agavatas recited when performing rites of food, sacrifice,tapas, and giving. Thatmantra (O ̧m tat sat) states that the faith ( ́sraddh ̄a) from which the act arose is trueand therefore the act is true, even though it resembles the acts of others whoworship the Devas, yak ̧sas, r ̄ak ̧sasas and dead and living people (17.23–28).In chapter 18, K ̧r ̧s ̧na returned to the theme of chapter 12, the alternativeswith which the Puru ̧samedha story had concluded: The performer of the five-day"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"162Dennis Hudsonceremony who placed the fires within himself and went out into the forest (san-ny ̄asin) had renounced all ritual acts based on desires, while the performer whostayed in the village as a householder and performed whatever sacrifices he couldafford had surrendered all their fruits. K ̧r ̧s ̧na urged Arjuna to follow the house-holder. He then launched into a discussion of metaphysics that suggests thephilosophical dialogue that the Brahmin priest was to participate in during the ́srauta rites. First he discussed the three-fold nature of the surrendering of fruits(18.1–12), then the five-fold causes by which all ritual acts performed by such ahouseholder succeed, and then the role of the gu ̧nas in that action (18.13– 48).Next he described how such a householder lives and becomes Brahma and attainsV ̄asudeva (the absolute Puru ̧sa N ̄ar ̄ayana as in the ́Satapatha Br ̄ahma ̧na) (18.49–56). Finally, he brought Arjuna back to his immediate situation, the one withwhich the Bhagavad-G ̄ıt ̄a began: Arjuna must act now. Since he had to act, K ̧r ̧s ̧natold Arjuna to love V ̄asudeva, to take refuge in him, to give up all dharmas, andV ̄asudeva would free him from all evils (p ̄apam) (18.57–66). The dharmas he wasto give up, we note, correspond to the dharmas with which the Puru ̧sa ́S ̄ukta endsin stanza 16, the religious rites on which space-time depends.In other words, K ̧r ̧s ̧na, who embodied V ̄asudeva, embodied the Puru ̧saN ̄ar ̄ayana and he took reponsibility for the dharmas that uphold and move space-time born from his body. He was in charge. Arjuna’s task was not to attain thestatus of Puru ̧sa N ̄ar ̄ayana, as the patron of the Puru ̧samedha would have (and asthe sages in 14.1). Instead Arjuna relied on the potency of the man who alreadyhad that status, V ̄asudeva K ̧r ̧s ̧na his ̄ac ̄arya. Any ̄ac ̄arya who, through mantra,embodied K ̧r ̧s ̧na embodied that Puru ̧sa N ̄ar ̄ayana and was a similar source ofrefuge. It seems likely that the Yavana Bh ̄agavata Agathocles had taken refuge insuch an ̄ac ̄arya.One last query may be addressed. How reliable is the ́Sr ̄ımad Bh ̄agavataPur ̄a ̧na for understanding Bh ̄agavata tradition in the centuries ... if it took theshape it now has only in the eighth century ..? We cannot answer that questionhere, but an answer will need to consider two points. First, as J. A. B. van Buitenenonce wrote, the Bh ̄agavata Pur ̄a ̧na is unusual among Pur ̄a ̧nas for the archaic natureof its Sanskrit.73 He conjectured that its writers purposely imitated an archaic stylein order to give it authority. While it is true that the text as we know it is compiledfrom various sources and has been added to over time, the archaism of its languagemay in fact express the archaic nature of its lore. It may in fact be lore aboutBh ̄agavatas that dates to the time when the Mah ̄abh ̄arata was being formulated,and perhaps earlier. Second, in its use of the Bh ̄agavata Pur ̄a ̧na, the Vaiku ̧n ̧thaPerum ̄al Temple reveals the text’s exoteric and esoteric structure. With few excep-tions, the panels on the bottom floorvim ̄ana depict material from Books 1–6 and11–12. As we noted, those panels face the exoteric realm of the temple ma ̧n ̧dala.With few exceptions, the panels on the middle floorgarbhag ̧rha, within theesoteric realm of the ma ̧n ̧dala, depict material from Books 7–10. Given thatorganization, “the Pur ̄a ̧na of the Bh ̄agavata possessing Kingship” ( ́Sr ̄ımad Bh ̄a-"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"163Early Evidence of the P ̄a ̃ncar ̄atra ̄Agamagavata Pur ̄a ̧na) may indeed possess esoteric lore (Books 7–10) relevant to aBh ̄agavata ruler encompassed by more publically available lore (Books 1–6, 11–12).Those esoteric teachings relating to the s ̄adhaka as king may explain whysuch ancient teachings did not come into public currency until quite late. Theymay also explain why the lore was illustrated elaborately on the imperial Vi ̧s ̧nu-house of a Bh ̄agavata emperor in a dynastic lineage judged to be ́S ̄udra. That, inturn, may exemplify the need for the powerful mantras and d ̄ık ̧s ̄as of the mixedVedic and Tantric rites of the P ̄a ̃ncar ̄atra in the centuries ... when monarchybecame the paradigm for government and the monarchs were not K ̧satriyas.It is significant, finally, that at the center of the Puru ̧samedha (the third dayand night), at the center of the Bhagavad G ̄ıt ̄a (chapter 14), and at the center ofthe Vaiku ̧n ̧tha Perum ̄alvim ̄ana (the bottom floorgarbhag ̧rha), there is an absolutePerson, the primordial Father and Mother, who inseminates his own womb. Theuse of ma ̧n ̧dala, mantra, and dhy ̄ana to identify the human body with that primor-dial androgynous Person—a goal characteristic of ̄Agama or Tantra—appears tobe very old indeed.NOTESChart 8.1 is an adaptation by A.

He begins the ma ̧n ̧dala exposition withthe spatial directions in heaven. Starting in the center and then in the clockwise directionfrom north, east, south, and west, he describes the elements relevant to life and the rites ofrefuge and initiation by the ̄ac ̄arya in the west (20–31). Then in the counterclockwisedirection (prasavya), he relates the ̄ac ̄arya’s explantion of the ma ̧n ̧dala beginning on the westand ending with the seed in the center (32–39). That prasavya movement anticipates thevision of Time as destroyer in chapter 11.

Nor couldthis be expected, since the self, this innermost spiritual core of the person, is heldto be beyond the reach of mind or reason. True spirituality cannot be described,only directly experienced in blissful consciousness, such is the prevailing Hinduposition.Indian religious leaders and philosophers themselves had different ideasabout the self ’s status, characteristics, stages of development, destination, size, orquantity (unique cosmic ̄Atman or plurality of separate self monads?). Also theterminology is multiform and the mutual distinctions are of a subtle nature andnot always clear. To my knowledge, no satisfactory encompassing monographabout the Hindu tradition of the self (in philosophy as well as religion and art) hasyet appeared, despite the existence of useful introductory studies such as those byEmil Abegg in 1945 and Troy W. Organ in 1964. Here lies a real challenge,because insight into the self has been expressed to be the real purpose of life,1 the“goal of the internal quest.”2It is not my intention to add to the existing literature on the philosophicalinterpretations of the self. Instead, I shall concentrate (on a less technical level) onselected aspects of the verbal imagery by which religious teachers, philosophersand poets have built up a “multiple denomination” in the course of their attemptsto give expression to the inexpressible. Surprisingly, these varied approaches to atypology of the self have also not been made the topic of a comprehensive study.The mystery of the self has been approached and obliquely referred to withremarkable variety and insistence, also with consistence, in Indian literature, inSanskrit as well as in the rich traditions of the vernaculars. In the following pages, Ishall restrict myself to some illustrative examples in Sanskrit literature from theVedas onward, with special reference to some Upani ̧sads and early Tantric sources.The Upani ̧sads most often referred to are the B ̧rhad ̄ara ̧nyaka (B ̄AUp), the Ch ̄an-dogya (ChUp) and the Maitr ̄aya ̧n ̄ıya (MaiUp), the latter being of a later date thanthe first two; the Tantric or literature with a Tantric orientation is rather varied,but some emphasis is laid upon the Lak ̧sm ̄ı Tantra (LT; Pa ̃ncar ̄atra, that is,"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"172Teun GoudriaanVa i ̧s ̧nava), the Tantrasadbh ̄ava (Tsb; Northern ́Saiva), and the Kul ̄alik ̄amnaya orKubjik ̄amata (KMT; ́S ̄akta), all three are dated to the early medieval period. Anintermediate stage is represented by the Mah ̄abh ̄arata (Mbh). As a deep cleft seemsto exist between the findings and the theorizations of modern psychology and theclassical Hindu tradition, all attempts at comparison between the two will beavoided at this stage.3 It is also beyond the scope of this paper to try to demons-trate the existence of points of contact in this sphere between the Indian traditionand early Western esotericism.Being unfamiliar with modern theoretical developments in the field ofsemiotics or science of literature, I shall not try to keep up with this discussion.There are different types of verbal imagery, for which I use the terms metaphor,simile, and allegory. For practical reasons, a metaphor may here be understood as aword or expression applied (with preservation of its conventional meaning) toanother object for the purpose of elucidating or suggesting a particular aspect ofthat object’s nature. Very often, the metaphor or simile will serve to realize aprocess of concretization, exteriorization, or even personification, in order tofacilitate human understanding of abstract notions. The use of a metaphor toexpress an aspect of spirituality implies a kind of paradox: the spiritual is present asthe concrete although it is not identical with it; the identification evokes a certaintension, this in contradistinction to the simile, where such an identification isavoided.4 In our context, there is, however, an important countertendency towardabstraction of originally concrete, archaic concepts such as puru ̧sa“(little) man”(see below).Certain types of metaphor (in most cases those derived from visionary ordream experience) or simile may develop into allegory, that is, a literary structurein which, in the words of H. E.Taylor, “all statements or expressions [which areconstitutive toward that structure] are intended to carry, beside their palpablemeaning, another which is veiled and more spiritual.... “5 The allegory mayserve as a suitable tool to express “dynamic” psychagogic aspects of mysticalrealization that concern the self ’s soteriological history. Instances of allegorical set-up, however, will not feature prominently in the present article. It must be empha-sized that, in a context like ours, the scope of literature and the literary cannot berestricted to the aesthetic sphere, but extends to the psychagogic; still MonroeBeardsley’s well-known definition of literature as “a discourse with importantimplicit meaning”6 continues to serve our purpose.In attempting a survey of the literary imagery of the self, we must be awarethat the different themes occur independent of entirely different socioeconomic,cultural, and religious contexts, literary genres, and the ritual, soteriological, ethi-cal, or poetical aims of the author or transmitter. Beside the trend toward concre-tization there occurs, as noted above, a tendency toward sophistication, speculativeabstraction, and spiritual reinterpretation of older conceptions.The imagery may be based on one of the following thematic clusters:1. Archaic or primitive: especially in Vedic literature we find a number of"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"173Imagery of the Self from Veda to Tantracoexisting ideas about a plurality of selves or souls such as asu (life force), pr ̄a ̧na(breath), j ̄ıva (life principle) or puru ̧sa (man or soul being). A matter of specialconcern for Vedic man was the question of how to imagine that entity that leavesthe body in the process of dying, and how this entity would find its way toward itsdestination, wherever that might be. On the other hand, one asked oneself howthe same entity entered the unborn babe and from where it came (such questionsare asked in the Pra ́sna Upani ̧sad 3.1).2. Body or senses: in late Vedic sources (especially the Upani ̧sads) where anonmaterial, controlling self has made its appearance, images come to the fore thattry to denote the relation of this self (whether called ̄atman, puru ̧sa or otherwise) tothe bodily and sensorial functions.3. Estrangement: several images are expressive of the self ’s essential dif-ference from the body and the mental functions. They interpret the self ’s incarna-tion in terms of an estrangement, a captivity or a banishment and try to outlinethe way by which it may succeed to return to its original and real abode anddestination. Here, similes or metaphors tend to develop into allegorical tales suchas that of the lost king7 or the banished prince (known from the S ̄a ̧mkhyas ̄utras).8One can also compare visual symbols such as the labyrinth.9 As a special variety ofthis type, we may consider the allegorical descriptions of the plight of deserted andlonely maidens, cowherdesses, or princesses.4. Purity: certain similes or metaphors are expressive of the recognition bythe self of its own purity, or its return toward its pristine state, such as recognizingone’s pure self in a cleaned mirror ( ́Svet ̄a ́svatara Upani ̧sad 2, 14; LT 7, 18)10 or theyemphasize the self ’s innate freedom, for instance, the bird metaphor discussedbelow.5. Experience: the last group of images conveys a philosophical or religiousmessage based upon direct experience of the self ’s real nature. It is sometimesdifficult to distinguish here between the simile (type: the self is like . . .) and whatone might call the identive metaphorical statement directly expressive of theauthor’s insight concerning the inner self (type: the self is . . .; or: one shouldmeditate on the self as . . .). We must also be aware that such images may refer tothe Universal Self, the individual self, or to a nonspecified conception. In thetheistic milieu (to which the majority of Tantric sources belongs), the relationbetween these two selves generally is expressed not unlike that between the souland God. In principle, the following instances refer primarily to the individualself, unless otherwise indicated.The range of subjects with which the self has been compared or by means ofwhich its nature has been denoted is nearly infinite. Several such comparisons(such as that with a king) have been applied in subtly different ways. A tentativesurvey according to subject headings might include the representation of the selfas:1. a man (“little man,” family man, king, actor, charioteer, etc.)"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"174Teun Goudriaan2. a woman (princess, bride, etc.)3. a god or goddess;4. an animal (bird, fish, sacrificial animal, beast of prey, etc.)5. a grain or plant (seeds, lotus, etc.)6. an inanimate object (crystal or pearl, gold, etc.)7. a primary element (fire, sun, space, etc.)8. a sound or mantraOnly some of these items testify to a direct continuation of Vedic imageryinto Tantric literature; others have come up, to our knowledge, only after theVedic period. In general, however, the incidence is amply sufficient to show thatmany Tantric gurus relied on the older Sanskritic tradition (orally transmitted orstudied by means of written texts) to express their conceptions of spirituality andits relation to the world of appearances.The way in which this process went on in practice is outlined below bymeans of a few selected instances.An interesting instance of development from a concrete toward an abstractconception is furnished by the image of the self (or soul) as a “little man.” Themost famous literary presentation of this idea is the legend of S ̄avitr ̄ı and Satyav ̄anin the Mah ̄abh ̄arata (3.281.17).11 We read how the God Yama forcibly extractsfrom Satyav ̄an’s body the puru ̧sa with the help of a noose (which proves the puru ̧sa’smaterial character). This little being is the size of a thumb: a clear reference to lateVedic statements such as in the ́Svet ̄a ́svatara Upani ̧sad 5.8, in the last instancegoing back to a primitive concept.12 In fact, the idea of a self of small or minutesize has become an ever-recurring and constantly varied feature of the Indianmystical tradition. It is also very often represented in religious literature influencedby Tantrism. In the ChUp (8.12.4), a text that in several respects presents evidenceof what may be somewhat one-sidedly called “proto-Tantric” ideas, the little manis localized in the (right) eye;13 he is not “the person with the eye.”14 However, theusual location of the self is in the heart, often conceived as the “space of theheart”15 or, metaphorically the “heart-lotus” in one of the later Upani ̧sads.16 Thatthe heart is the usual residence of the “thinking soul” in archaic cultures wasargued with many illustrative references by Ernst Windisch.17It is stated also by means of a simile that the real Puru ̧sa is invisible andcannot be found even if one were to dissect the body.Just as nobody who takes an axe (and dissects a log of wood) will see smokeor fire within the log, in the same way those who dissect a body, hands orfeet, observe nothing else than that.18Apart from denying the material nature of the self, the simile also suggests a certainrelation in the nature between the self and fire. It may be remarked also that SriAurobindo, in his allegorical epic S ̄avitr ̄ı, abstracted the appearance of Satyav ̄an’s"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"175Imagery of the Self from Veda to Tantrasoul in his own way by saying that “. . . another luminous Satyav ̄an arose . . . thesilent marvel stood between mortal man and god.”19A remarkable use of the concept of the “soul-man” in the Tantras is the“man of evil” (papapuru ̧sa) that should be burned by the worshiping priest in thecourse of his meditative ritual of bh ̄uta ́suddhi“purification of the elements,” anecessary precondition for his obtaining a pure and divine nature with which hecan worship God. According to the Sanskrit commentary to the Arcanakha ̧n ̧da, aritual guide to the Vai ̧s ̧nava (professedly non-Tantric) Vaikh ̄anasa community oftemple priests, the “man of evil” is present in the navel. He should first be driedout by enclosing him with a ma ̧n ̧dala of V ̄ayu while reciting a ̧Rg Vedic stanza(10.137.3) and afterward burned up by means of the seed syllable of the fire godAgni. The “man of evil” has the following form: his head consists of brahmin-murder, his arms of theft, his heart of alcoholism, his hips of violation of theteacher’s bed (consorting with the teacher’s wife), his feet of the combination ofthese four deadly sins. His other limbs consist of minor sins, he has a red beard andred eyes; he is, in short, a little devil who implicitly is assumed to live in everyperson whose karma has not been exhausted. The older Vaikh ̄anasa ̄Agamas,relatively free of Tantric influences, do not mention him.The image of the self as “family man” can be classified as an aspect of therepresentation of the self as a male human being, as mentioned above. Theexpression of the self ’s situation in terms of a family relationship might seemparadoxical from the viewpoint of Advaita or S ̄a ̧mkhya because these schools insistupon its uniqueness or isolation. However that may be, there is no such contradic-tion in the early Upani ̧sadic occurrence of this image. It gives us a realistic image ofthe ̄Atman, to be meditated upon by the adept (especially the Vedic sacrificer) whostrives for completeness in the present life and the hereafter.Thelocus classicus is B ̄AUp 1.4.7: “ ̄atmaivedam agra ̄as ̄ıd eka eva / so ‘k ̄a-mayata: j ̄ay ̄a sy ̄ad atha praj ̄ayey ̄atha vitta ̧m me sy ̄ad atha karma kurv ̄ıya,’” that is,“The self only existed here in the beginning, all alone. He desired: ‘may there be awife (for me), that I may beget offspring, and may there be possessions for me, thatI may perform activities’.” Here the self quite frankly is stated to be still un-satisfied, a position that is unthinkable in classical texts. But, the text itself givesalready an exegetical turn to the image. Admittedly, the self ’s inner urges areexpressed “in bodily terms”20 or, I would prefer, in terms of male patriarchal self-realization; but the author proceeds by explaining that one should consider the ̄Atman as one’s mind (manas, here corresponding to the “psyche“), his wife as one’sspeech, his child as one’s breath, and his possessions as the sensorial faculties; thesetogether make up one’s completeness. Thus, one’s status as a successful house-holder is projected, so to say, onto the mystical plane of interiority by way ofexplicit allegory. No distinction is made between cosmic and individual planes; thewhole “spiritual family” can be realized in the here and now. A little further(B ̄AUp 1.5.7), the family relation is rendered in even more homely terms—mindis presented as the father, speech as the mother and breath as the child. A cosmic"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"176Teun Goudriaandimension is added, however, in the B ̄AUp (1.5.11–13) where mind, speech, andbreath have as their respective bodies: heaven, earth and water, and sun, fire(earthly representation of the sun) and moon as their “luminous forms.” The onlychild, breath, has according to the B ̄AUp (1.5.12) a secret other name, viz. Indra.Thus, the “king of the gods” plays a role in mystic speculation that correspondswith that of the individual self in an earlier tradition (see below).This spiritual allegory of the self expressed in terms of a family relationalready contains what one might call “proto-Tantric features” and has counter-parts in several Tantric passages. One might even think of it as the prototype of thelater development of the term kula“(spiritual) family” in all its implications,which plays such an important role in Tantric religion. There, however, hasoccurred an important shift in the “allegorical sense” as a consequence of thedeveloping distinction between the cosmic and the individual self; in the Tantricview, the former is now designated by the “father” (who stands somewhat alooffrom the pettiness of ordinary family life), the latter by the “child.” The mother’srole is occupied by the cosmic ́Sakti. The blissful togetherness of the little familyalso is realized by the Tantric adept in the course of his meditation. In the firststanza of his Tantr ̄aloka, Abhinavagupta adroitly refers to this mystical truth whilehe pays honor to his own parents on the surface level; the mother obtains theepithets ̧r ̧s ̧timah ̄a ̧h“whose greatness is occasion,” the father is guptaruci“of hiddenglow,” while his own heart or spiritual core is denoted as their “emission” (visarga).From the monastic point of view, this situation which suggests a conscious-ness of separation should be transcended in a realization of cosmic unity. On anallegorical level, this may be represented by the ascetic ideal (implying internalself-realization) versus the “external” existence as a householder, as is suggested intheTantrasadbh ̄ava:Representation is of (the nature of ) living in Sa ̧msar ̄awhich is a house; the self of representationbecomes a householder; the One who is inside itdoes not possess a family.21Actually, some texts give prominence to the mental and/or real separation fromfamily ties as a prerequisite for the s ̄adhaka (initiate) who is to actualize hisprogress towards final release.22 Already the B ̄AUp (4.4.22) states: “knowingthis..., the wise men of old did not wish progeny (asking themselves): ‘Whatshall we do with progeny when the self is this our world?’ ”It is clear that this interpretation of the time-honored image of the house-holder fits easily into a theistic worldview, as exemplified by the Li ̇ nga Pur ̄a ̧na2.9.55; “Having made one syllable O ̧M your lamp, search for the Master of thehouse, the Subtle One Who resides in the interior . . . behold the Gracious One( ́Siva) residing in the body.”23 The eternal desire for self-expression and the reversedirection toward the original unity is formulated in Kaula in the Siddhsiddh ̄an-"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"177Imagery of the Self from Veda to Tantratapaddhati (4.11.9)24 ascribed to Gorak ̧san ̄atha; “the Single takes to himself thefamily (kula), the family desires the Single,” which is explained in the text in thisway, that “( ́Siva) of unique form, possessing immeasurable power, although abid-ing in his own blissful state, enjoys a state of plurality, but (afterward) of His owninitiative again assumes His former base.”The status of the ruler is allotted to the ̄Atman in a variety of images andmetaphorical expressions. Usually they function in a context where the self ’srelation to lower mental and bodily functions is discussed. According to a well-known expression, the self “rules by means of his ruling powers” ( ̄ısata ̄ısanibhih,B ̄AUp 1.4.11); and “ruler” ( ̄ısana) is given as the appellation of the ̄Atman (B ̄AUp4.4.15 and 4.4.22); “he is present in the hollow space of the heart, master of all,ruler of all, Lord of all,” he is “Lord and king of all beings” (B ̄AUp 2.5.15). Alsothe MaiUp (6.8) knows the term “ruler” as one of the epithets of the self. TheB ̄AUp (2.1.18ff.) depicts a specific situation in which this rulership is effectuated:during dream experience, the self can wander about in full freedom everywhere itlikes. In this capacity, it is compared to a king who, on an inspection tour throughhis empire takes his officials and servants with him (the officials are pr ̄a ̧nas, herethe vital functions).25These activities of the self, experienced in dream, are essentially false, as ́Sa ̇ nkara points out in his commentary.They are lingering impressions (v ̄asan ̄a)that mirror earlier experiences under the influence of desire and karma. However,in the next stage of interiorization, that of deep sleep (B ̄AUp 2.1.19), the self isagain compared to a king (also to a child and a stately brahmin). This time, theking is inactive and has retreated, as it were, to his inner apartments where heenjoys the highest bliss. Because the details of this passage involve intricatedifficulties, their discussion can be better postponed to another occasion.The royal image is taken up again in the B ̄AUp 4.37–38 and connectedthere with the phenomena of birth and death.When the self has decided to inhabita body, the vital functions are said to await it eagerly, just as the impending visit ofa king is awaited eagerly by several local functionaries such as the head of police.And, when it is about to depart, all these vital functions gather around it, just asthe functionaries gather around the king at the end of his official visit. Weconclude that the images of the “royal self ” are polyvalent in the Upani ̧sads; it canbe applied in different situations and by means of different subtypes.TheMah ̄abh ̄arata uses exactly the same imagery:Just as several councilors of a king,enjoined (by him) proclaim their separate decrees—in the same way (do) the five (senses) in the bodies;He is superior to them, the sole repository of insight.26The idea is that the king is the only person who can make real political decisionsbecause only he surveys the whole situation. In a similar fashion, the fundamental"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"178Teun Goudriaantext of the S ̄a ̧mkhya school, the S ̄a ̧mkhyakarika states that the ten senses, themind, and the ego, like lamps, illumine objects for the self ’s benefit and thendeposit them in front of the Buddhi (intelligence or reason).27 As is usual inS ̄a ̧mkhya, the self is here called Puru ̧sa. The commentator M ̄a ̧thara clarifies thatthe relation between the self and the functions is like that between a king and hisdignitaries with the Buddhi acting as chief minister. The earlier commentaryS ̄a ̧mkhyatattvakamud ̄ı even specifies that this psychic process can be compared to asystem of gradual taxation. The image is not unknown to Tantric literature. TheLak ̧sm ̄ ı Tantra gives a similar description; although complicated by the addition ofthree spheres of application (divine, psychic, and material), here it is the Buddhithat offers the impressions of the senses to the self (called K ̧setraj ̃na).28 TheBuddhi is supervised (adhi ̧s ̧thit ̄a) by the self (LT 7.32); in the same way the self iscalled the supervisor (adhi ̧s ̧that ̧r) of the vital functions in ̄Adi ́se ̧sa’sParam ̄ar-thas ̄ara.29 Although Tantric literature in general is perhaps less concerned withdescribing the relations between the various psychic and sensory functions, thelordly nature of the self is often emphasized. Thus, the Jay ̄akhya Sa ̧mhit ̄a, perhapsthe oldest P ̄a ̃ncar ̄atra ̄Agama, in the context of the worshiper’s self purification,states:He beholds in the space of the heartthat unmoving (self ), of solar brilliance,permeated by flashing splendor,the lord, the supreme Pervader30This seems to refer to the individual self (j ̄ıv ̄atman, cf. 59d j ̄ıvam ̄atm ̄anam), butsimilar descriptions in related sources are applied to Vi ̧s ̧nu/N ̄ar ̄aya ̧na who ispresent in the human heart as Supreme Self and inner controller (antary ̄amin),also according to the JS itself (4.106). Another instance is found in the Vaikh ̄anasaritual text Sam ̄urt ̄arcan ̄adhikara ̧na (Treatise on Worship by Means of an Image)ascribed to the sage Atri (31.33ff.). A more detailed treatment can be found inMaric ̄ı’sVim ̄an ̄arcanakalpa (Guide to Temple Worship, ch. 84).31Such statements about God’s presence in the heart or about the divinenature of the self give expression to a theistic reorientation of the ̄Atmanic tradi-tion in most of the schools with Tantric orientation. In the passage from the LT(7.33) discussed above, the self is said to be the “divine sphere” (adhidaivatam) forthe Buddhi. The ́Saiva or ́Sakta sources generally hold that the individual self is ́Siva (or a ́Siva, in dualistic tradition) who is fettered within a body.32 For theKul ̄ar ̧nava, one of the most authoritative of the Kaula Tantras, “the body is atemple, and the soul (j ̄ıva) is God Sad ̄a ́siva.”33 The dedication of one’s own beingto this divine self is a popular theme in Tantric as well as bhakti (devotional)sources; it long has been elaborated in allegorical guise in the well-known stanza ̄Atm ̄a tvam, which describes human activity as a continuous act of worship to ́Siva:"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"179Imagery of the Self from Veda to TantraThou art my self, the Mountain’s Daughter my mind,Thy retinue of gods my vital breaths, my body Thy mansion;enjoyment of sense-objects is mere worship of Thee,in sleep I abide in sam ̄adhi (profound meditation).Walking by foot in circumambulation,my words are all songs of praise;whatever I do, O Gracious LordIt is all adoration to Thee.34Similarly, we read in the Prapa ̃ncas ̄ara Tantra:The activities of mind, speech and bodyshould be meditation, praise and acts of worship;O Lord of gods, all my work should be adoration of Thee.35The divine self ’s residence is described in typically Tantric fashion in the Tsb.(1.49c–51a): in the region of the heart, a lotus should be imagined with eightpetals and a sixteen-fold filament.Within it, a pericarp “like Mount Meru” restingupon a quadrangle. “In its center, the self abides blissfully like ́Siva; pure, ofminute size like the hundredth part of a hair’s tip. This is the Supreme Self in thebody...”36 In the so-called Kashmir ́Saiva tradition, the illuminated self isrepresented by the god Bhairava, the “Lord of all” (vi ́sve ́svara).37 In Tantrism, awidely known allegorizing image is that of the “Isle of Gems,” where the Goddessis enthroned in the worshiper’s heart.38 The divine representation of the self in thebody dates already from the Upani ̧sadic period, although it is by no meansprominent there. In MaiUp, a passage of strikingly proto-Tantric character, Indrais identified with the Puru ̧sa who resides in the right eye (see above), and hisunnamed wife resides in the left eye; their union finds place within the hollow ofthe heart.39 This is, at the same time, one of the earliest and clearest instances ofthe realization of the self ’s bisexuality.The lordly ̄Atman or Puru ̧sa is often said to reside in a stronghold (p ̄ur,pura). The B ̄AUp (2.5.18) plays upon the similarity of the words puru ̧sa and pura:the Puru ̧sa is said to bear this name because, formerly (puras), he entered thestrongholds in winged form and continues to abide in them. But, the idea of a“mystic stronghold of brahman” (brahmapura) is found already in the AtharvavedaSa ̧mhit ̄a (10.2.18ff.); also here, an etymological connection is established with theword puru ̧sa.Of eight rings and nine doorsis the gods’ invincible stronghold;within it, a golden treasure-roomreaching the sky, surrounded by splendor.Within that golden treasure-room"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"180Teun Goudriaanof the three beams and threefold base—the self-possessing appearance within it,that only the knower of Brahman knows.40In this famous passage, the self is described as a strange, “self-possessing,” presum-ably dwarfish being (Ya k ̧sa), a “monster,” that lies hidden in a kind of goldencage.41 A variant of the second stanza occurs in AV 10.8.43:A lotus of nine doors, covered by three strands;the self-possessing appearance within it,that only the Brahman-knowers know.The Kaula Tantric Kubjik ̄a school possesses a still unedited Kubjik ̄a Upani ̧sad thatvery clearly attaches itself to the Atharva Veda tradition. Notwithstanding itsnotably apocryphal character, it quotes an astonishing number of stanzas from theAtharva Veda, among them the present stanza, which is an oblique reference to the“royal yantra” of Kubje ́svara, Goddess Kubjik ̄a’s male partner. The “lotus” is notinterpreted as the body, but is said to be an eight-petaled lotus ma ̧n ̧dala ofconventional type; the “nine doors” are not the nine apertures of the body, but afigure of nine angles (navako ̧nam); and the “three strands,” which Whitney sur-mises to be the three temperaments, are three circles (vrttatrayam). The Yak ̧sa is, inthis exegesis, a binducakra (which suggests that the ̄Atman is possessed by thebindu or central dot that plays such a prominent role in Tantric ma ̧n ̧dalas); thewhole is characterized as a Brahmacakra (cakra here representing pura). This iscertainly an interesting instance of “abstractive” Veda-exegesis; several more re-lated cases are found in the Kubjik ̄a Upani ̧sad.42The idea of a stronghold is continued in the well-known term pury ̧s ̧taka“theeight-fold stronghold,” which usually denotes, in Hindu tradition, the five objectsof the senses, together with the mind, ego function and reason. It is also frequentin Tantric literature, such as the LT (7.23) and Bha ̧t ̧ta N ̄ar ̄ayana’s commentary ontheM ̧rgendra ̄Agama.43From the above remarks, one should not conclude that the individual self ismotionless. On the contrary, many references and descriptions, especially in Tan-tric texts, testify to its all-pervasive nature, its innate pulsation, or its capacity ofmovement. A passage translated above, the JS (10.60) refers to the self ’s quality as“supreme pervader.” The Tsb (1.50ff.) distinguishes two states of the inner self,that is, pervasive (vy ̄apin) and nonpervasive. The latter state, says the text, is that ofpa ́su (sacrificial animal), in accordance with the usual ́Saiva terminology; in thisstate, the self ’s innate freedom is blocked and bound to the wheel of rebirth. Thepervasive state, we can conclude, is a function of the self ’s ethereal nature which isoften proclaimed.44 Of similar intention is the insistence on the self ’s beingminute in size as well as immeasurably large.45 The minute size tends to beassociated with the j ̄ıvatman and pervasiveness with the Supreme Self;46 the"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"181Imagery of the Self from Veda to TantraLak ̧sm ̄ ı Tantra considers the minute size as one of the defects of the unredeemedsoul.47 Also, according to the ́Saiva Siddh ̄anta, the state of being a ̧nu“minute”inheres the pa ́su.This self or soul of small size can be set into motion by the meditatorthrough yogic practices. One of these procedures is generally known as ku ̧n ̧da-lin ̄ıyoga, but mutually differing descriptions occur. An interesting Vai ̧s ̧nava prac-tice, during which the self is led upward from a fiery ma ̧n ̧dala in the abdomentoward a lunar ma ̧n ̧dala in the head, is described in the Mar ̄ıcisa ̧mhit ̄a.48 Animportant application is the redemptive manipulation during a ́Saiva d ̄ık ̧s ̄aceremony of the initiate’s self by the guru who has identified himself with ́Siva; werefer to Brunner’s interpretation.49 There is clearly a widespread conviction of theindividual self ’s mobility in the sectarian ritual traditions with Tantric orienta-tions; and its passiveness and liability to manipulation stands in remarkable con-trast to the all-powerful ̄Atman that was proclaimed in the earlier Upani ̧sads.However, also in these Upani ̧sads the “moving self ” is well known; thus, accordingto the B ̄AUp (2.1.18), as noted above, the self in the dream situation performsinternal journeys. Birth and death are the occasions of the self ’s arrival into andexit from the body; the same text (4.4.2) describes how the ̄Atman leaves the bodythough a beam of light issuing upward from the tip of the heart,50 through theeyes, the fontanel, or by another way. This is followed in the text by the famoussimile in which the contracting and leaving of the self is compared to a caterpillarthat moves from the tip of one leaf toward another.Very frequent is the representation of the bodiless, moving self as a bird.This may be a continuation of the very old conception of the bird soul,51 butIndian culture has developed a rich imagery of its own, usually expressive of thecentral principle of unbound freedom as the soul’s natural and pristine privilege.In the Atharva Veda, we find, in a magical context (counteracting jealousy), aremarkable reference to that which is “nestled within the heart, the little wingedspirit” (manaska ̧m patayi ̧s ̧nukam); here manas has its old meaning of “spirit-power.”52 As Abegg notes, birds that approach the sacrificial ground may representthe ancestors’ souls.53 The Vedic sacrificer is said to be a bird who flies upward toheaven.54 These time-honored conceptions are then connected in the Upani ̧sadswith the developing views on the self. In winged form, the self (puru ̧sa) entered thebody, says the B ̄AUp. The self ’s contraction into its own essence during sleep iscompared to the return toward its nest of “a hawk or eagle after its flight, tired andputting together its wings.”55 In a related image in Pra ́snaUp (4.1.7), the sensescoming to rest in the self are compared to birds who return to their nest. Adifferent association is evoked by two stanzas in the B ̄AUp:Putting off the bodily (cage) by dream,not sleeping, it observes the sleeping (functions).Taking the bright (essence) along, it returns to its abode,the golden self, the unique swan."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"182Teun GoudriaanBy means of breath protecting its lower nest,immortal, it roams outside it;it goes along at will, out of the reach of death,that golden self, the unique swan.56From the early Upani ̧sads onward, the conception of the ha ̧msa or “swan soul” hasremained in vogue. It is, to my knowledge, generally presented as a metaphoricalexpression, not as a simile, and it always evokes the freely moving, emancipatedself that “has emerged from the cage of the material elements” (ni ̧hs ̧rtam bh ̄utapa ̃n-jar ̄at).57 This does not mean, however, that freedom is always realized in practice:“he binds himself like a bird by a net,” says the MaiUp (3.2 and 6.30), withoutactually using the term ha ̧msa. An early theistic instance of this imagery is SvetUp(1.6) where the ha ̧msa is said to wander in the “circle of Brahman” (probably theround of existences; the commentator Upani ̧sadbrahmayogin interprets the circleof Brahman as n ̄an ̄ayoni ̧su (through several rebirths), in a misconception ofdifference between itself and the divine cause that sets it into motion; it needsGod’s grace to enter immortality.In the yogic tradition, the idea of ha ̧msa obtained another dimension associ-ated with the etymological analysis of the word ha ̧msa as I (ham) and He (sa),which was understood to express, by its very linguistic form, the unity of theindividual and the universal self. In addition, these two aspects were connectedwith the outgoing and the ingoing breath, respectively. The syllables ham and sa,thus, came to represent a continuous mantra uttered by each living being throughrespiration and was stated in clear terms in one of the earlier Upani ̧sads, theDhy ̄anabindu Upani ̧sad:By the syllable ha he leaves, by sa he enters again;“ha ̧msa, ha ̧msa,” this mantra the soul recites continually58Theha ̧msa symbolism is further enriched by the Tantric doctrine of the identity ofthe phonetic system with divine emanation. Thus, in the Jn ̄an ̄ar ̧nava Tantra, wefind:The syllable ha, O Goddess, is the formal representationof the Void, eternally undecaying;the syllable sa, being the form of ́Sakti,denotes the Supreme in combination with the visarga;She is called ́Sakti because She is the cause of creation .O Fair One, yoga enables (the yogin) to behold the selfby means of the utterance “He am I” (so ’ham).59In this way, the original archaic conception of the self as a bird developed into amystically loaded metaphor, overlaid in the Tantric phase with yogic and mantric"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"183Imagery of the Self from Veda to Tantraesoterism.

The KMT offers a threefoldinterpretation of ha ̧msa as “the supreme seminal sound that is present in theheart.”Ha ̧msa contains the three conscious principles of ́Siva, ́Sakti, and the(individual) ̄Atman, appearing as “separation” (viyoga), union (sa ̧myoga), andsound (n ̄ada; produced by the union).60 The terms “separation” and “union”suggest the principles of akula and kula mentioned above. Divine ha ̧msa, says thetext, is worshiped by the (realization of ) communion between these three princi-ples. The ̄Atman exists in the middle between “contraction” (in-breath, ́Sakti) and“expansion” (vik ̄asa, ́Siva). The union between the latter two is formulated in theritual-sexual terminology as “friction” (mathana) in the naval, that is, the Ma ̃nip-ura center and its product as the self as well as the “fire of wisdom” (j ̃n ̄an ̄agni) ofunknown brilliance and accompanied by supreme happiness. We are remindedhere of Vedic descriptions of the Puru ̧sa as the God Agni Vai ́sv ̄anara in the belly.61The kindling of the “fire of wisdom” is a clear reminiscence of the ritual kindlingof the sacrificial fire, remembered by these Tantric gurus as a powerful store ofspiritual imagery.62 There is another old element in the description of the mysticalha ̧msa in the KMT: the friction of ́Siva and ́Sakti also creates am ̧rta (Water-of-Life), in which one should imagine the self as bathing (as a swan bathes in lakeM ̄anasa, a well-known image for the bliss of spiritual freedom).63The discussion of the ha ̧msa brings us to another type of imagery in which itis difficult to distinguish between metaphorism and the application of the naturalsimile, on the one hand, and description of mystical reality on the other. Thestatement that the self is a sun or like the sun may be considered a metaphor orsimile, but such an enunciation at the same time serves as a direct pointer to theself ’s fiery and universally pervasive nature. An immediate connection with solarimagery was already met with in a quotation from the B ̄AUp (4.3.11–12) thatmentions the “golden self ”; gold has an ancient association with the sun.64 Acombination of “bird,” “gold” and “sun” is presented in MaiUp:The bird of golden hue, established in the heartand in the sun; diver and swan, the glow of heat, a bull;he is in this fire, (him) we worship.65The self that abides in the heart is “like a blazing fire, multiform” (MaiUp 7.7),but it is also “the fire which has its abode in heaven, solar, called Time” (MaiUp6.2). There are numerous statements about the self ’s fiery nature that we cannotdeal with here. According to Erich Frauwallner, this fiery nature was imaginedoriginally in a literal fashion, but afterward this idea was abandoned. Instead, a“spiritualization of the concept of the soul” (“Vergeistigung des Seelenbegriffs”)occurred, which led to the recognition of knowledge (vij ̃ n ̄anam) as the soul’scharacteristic.66 Such an interpretation, although essentially right, is somewhatsimplistic. The conception of the soul or self as an entity of fiery nature with solarassociations has held its ground right into Tantric culture, notwithstanding the"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"184Teun Goudriaantension which may have existed between it and the doctrine of the soul’s imma-teriality. It must not be forgotten that such concretizing images were also meant asmeditational aids, but still they served as approaches to the essence of what wasbeing meditated upon.The sun, the cosmic representative or repository of the all-powerful con-suming and re-creating force that is fire, is often referred to in images of the self.The sun itself is described as the “ ̄Atman of all that moves and stands” in abeautiful stanza of the ̧Rg Veda.67 According to the Jaimin ̄ıya Br ̄ahma ̧na, the sun isthe secret repository and destination of the sacrificer’s self.68 The thumb-sized selfis equal in form to the sun (a ̧ngu ̧s ̧tham ̄atro ravitulyar ̄upa ̧h), says the SvetUp (5.8).In the Tantric Tsb (1.50), the internal movement of what it calls the “SupremeSelf ” is compared to the daily movement of the solar orb (bhramate s ̄uryabim-bavat). The solar image is applied several times in relevant images, for instance:Just as this world of beings after sunriseperforms its works, without these being donenor caused to be done by the sun itself, just sothe self also (remains inactive and aloof ).69In preceding sections, the relation between the self and the vital functions was saidto be expressed in the older Upani ̧sads in terms of a householder and his family, ora ruler and his functionaries or subjects. When the self is compared to fire or sun,the minor functions obtain the status of emissions of fire or light, spread out by thecentral source of power; in this way, the images emphasize the fundamental unityof what has evolved and the source:Just as from fire the sparks, and from the sun the rays,likewise of him, the breath and other (functions) ever againemerge outwards from him, in due arrangement.70The same image is applied still more explicitly in a passage of the Pra ́sna Upani ̧sad(4.1.2): “to him, he (Pippal ̄ada) said: ‘Just as, G ̄argya, the rays (mar ̄ıcaya ̧h) of thesun which approach the place of his setting all unite within that circle of fire, andtime and again come forth when he rises; in the same way, this whole (system ofthe senses) unites within the chief power (pare deve), the mind, and that is thereason why the Puru ̧sa (during deep sleep) does not hear . . . (nor executes theother functions).” The central repository in this typical instance of older Up-ani ̧sadic psychology is the manas, which acts as the self ’s immediate associate andis equated (in 4.1.4) with the sacrificer.71The teachings of Bh ̄ı ̧sma in the twelfth book of the Mah ̄abh ̄arata containseveral instances of the same image, but applied with minor variations:As shafts of fire, impetuous gales of wind,"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"185Imagery of the Self from Veda to Tantrarays of the sun, and currents riverinerole forward and return in streams continuous;likewise the bodies of embodied (selves).72Although the activities inaugurated by the self are expressed in these instances inthe form of similes, the underlying suggestion is nevertheless that these similescontain a transference in the concreteness of the self ’s very nature, which is one ofpotential powerful movement (an idea very close to the Tantric conception of theSupreme). The active nature of the senses (cf. also the “metaphoric” term in-driyara ́smi (the sensorial rays) in the Mbh. (12.197.14) is also brought forward inthe interpretation by the Nyaya school of visual perception as nayanara ́smi“a rayof fire atoms which proceeds from the eyeball.”73 And similarly, the Gau ̧da-p ̄adak ̄arik ̄as (1,6cd) teach us: “the Pr ̄a ̧na generates all things. The Spirit [gener-ates] the rays of intelligence as separate...”74At the same time we can observe the tendency to reserve the solar positionfor a Supreme Self distinguished from the embodied self. Already according to theMaiUp (6.1), the “external self ” is located in the sun, as a “golden Puru ̧sa;” a stillearlier instance of the line of thinking, intimately connected with archaic experi-ence, was mentioned above (Jaimin ̄ıya Br ̄ahma ̧na, 1.17f ). In the sectarian sourcesunder Tantric influence, the tendency has developed into theistic imagery. Thus,in Sadyojyoti’sMok ̧sak ̄arik ̄a, the metaphorical expressions are “ ́Siva-sun: and“ ́Sakti-splendor”:By the ́Sakti-ray of the ́Siva-sunits eye of consciousness is realized, and thusthe self, its cover gone, beholdsGod ́Siva, with His Powers manifold.75In the Lak ̧sm ̄ı Tantra (14.35), the pure essence of the Goddess, abstracted from herexecutive powers, and realized without accessories within the space of the heart, iscompared to the brilliant sun that rises in the clear sky.Tantric sources often make mention of the rays (most often mar ̄ıci) emittedby the Supreme; as a rule, they are concretized as goddesses. Thus, when theYogin ̄ıh ̧rdaya (2.81) uses the term mar ̄ıcaya ̧h, the commentator Amrtananda para-phrases the kulam ̄atara ̧h“the Mothers of the (spiritual) Family.” K ̧semar ̄aja, theeleventh-century theoretician of nondualistic ́Saivism, explains the word m ̄at ̧r ̧h(the Mothers) occurring in the Svacchanda Tantra (1.36) as referring to the SevenMothers Br ̄ahm ̄ı, etc., taking the shape of “Bhairava’s ray” in different directionsin the sky. The surrounding deities ( ̄avara ̧ndevat ̄a ̧h) of the Tantric Goddess ́Sr ̄ ı(Lalit ̄a) symbolized by the ́sr ̄ıcakra are likewise designated as her rays.76 In themonastic view, the sensorial process should be meditated upon as nothing elsethan the emission by the ́Siva-self of the circle of rays (mar ̄ıcicakram) that presidesover the activities of the sense organs.77"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"186Teun GoudriaanThe “rays” are the means by which the self, statically existing as unspecifiedpure consciousness, concretizes or condenses its essence into powerful activity, orrenders it imaginable and approachable. Already the Atharva Veda refers to protec-tion afforded by Indra’s beams (aktu).78 Divine favor is felt and evoked as blessingsunshine. But the rays in the proto-theistic view, also establish contact with, andrealize ascension toward, the supreme deity in heaven (Mbh 12.290.70); in anearly and somewhat different image, the subsidiary powers as seasons act as doorguardians who lead the sacrificer, released from the bonds of time, to the sun as afinal abode.79 The contact between the Puru ̧sa in the eye and its counterpart in thesun is established through rays (ra ́ smibhi ̧h) according to the B ̄AUp (5.5.2); whenthe person is dying, this contact has become unnecessary because of the leaving ofthe internal Puru ̧sa, and that is why one at the moment sees the pure solar orbwithout rays. This latter specification has found its way into traditional prog-nostications of impending death. We find, for example, exactly the same stipula-tion in the KMT (23.19), with the only difference in interpretation being thatdeath is to be expected only after two years.But the rays also fulfil a more aggressive function. In the MaiUp (2.6 and6.31), five vital faculties are characterized as the rays by which the self consumesthe objects of the senses (just as we may presume, the sun by its rays consumes themoisture of the earth); verse 6.31 implicitly gives an “etymological” connectionbetween ̄Atman and atti“he eats” (the connection was missed by Van Buitenen inhis translation). The consumption of the sense objects by the pure mind isexpressed from the non-dualistic Tantric viewpoint in the Tantrasadbh ̄ava:Just as the water on the surface of a stoneis soon reduced to naught by solar rays—(how strange!) Nobody drank it yet it disappeared—And found no more; thus (stilled) is the enlightened mind.80This is the Bhairava state, in which the all-producing and all-consuming Self hasmade an end to all appearance of pluriformity. Again, the KMT (23.13) presentsthe same image in a less sophisticated context of impending death (k ̧rt ̄ anta ̧h;identical twin with Time) “soon takes toward himself the water which is life, anddries it up incessantly, acting by moonbeams and solar rays”; the passage needs acontextual discussion which we cannot pursue here. The drinking of moisture bythe solar rays is beautifully expressed by Bh ̄aravi in his Kir ̄at ̄arjun ̄ıya (9.3):By means of rays as hands, extremely thirsty,he tasted the brim the sweet draught born of flowers;and as in drunkenness to the earth approaching,his countenance all red—thus was the setting sun.81In the KMT, the Mar ̄ıcis are practically identical with the Yogin ̄ıs in their functionas guardian deities, and their fear-inspiring, consumptive nature is emphasized."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"187Imagery of the Self from Veda to TantraImpelled by the guru’s wrath, they burn the aspirant who irritates his guru (3.57);the self-willed person who modifies a mantra given him by the guru becomes anobject of their hate (7.26). We are told that anyone who goes against the guru’swishes or breaks secrets, will be eaten by the Yogin ̄ıs. The adept who is ripe forimmediate release might (really or symbolically) offer his being to the Mar ̄ıcis,according to a ritual described with mantras in the KMT (23130ff ). The cere-mony, characteristically, also can be performed with variations for gaining magicalpowers.82 These goddesses are also called Yogin ̄ıs (23.143). They consist of agroup of six, headed by ̧D ̄akin ̄ı (in principle identical with the presiding goddessof the six cakras described in Avalon’sSerpent Power), and a seventh leading deitycalled Kusmam ̄alin ̄ı (the Flower-garlanded), who here replaces Kubjik ̄a as therepresentation of the all-consuming Self. At the end of the KMT (25.196), how-ever, the rays once more appear in their benign nature; the adept who conducts theworship of the Kubjik ̄a tradition in the right way, will be worshiped by them inreturn.At the end of this rapid survey of some ways of imagining the self in selectedSanskrit sources, it might be useful to reformulate a few inferences. These arepreliminary only because of the limited material studied and the restricted periodinvolved in the preparation of this article.1. The self is described by means of a varied imagery divisible according toa number of traditional themes. Within these themes, a remarkable degree ofmultifunctionality has sometimes been realized over the centuries.2. The selections from the texts of Tantric character make it abundantlyclear that the formulators of this literature knew the earlier revelation (especiallythe important Upani ̧sads) very well; in many ways, they continued and developedthe time-honored imagery. Some of them eagerly took up and expanded the Vedictendency toward linguistic speculation.3. In many cases, they applied the images, which in the older Upani ̧sadsand some later texts referred to the undivided or individual self, to their concep-tions of a Supreme Self, which they experienced as inseparable from the SupremeGodhead worshiped by their school or sect. We could speak of a theistic reorienta-tion of the old auto-mystical tradition, entailing a tendency to loss of authority forthe individual self. Although it would be wrong to consider Tantrism as a mono-lithic block, most of the very different schools or movements seem to have thistendency in common. The adepts of the monastic ́Saiva school, however, tried toharmonize the “auto mystical” and the “theistic” traditions.4. Many of the similes and allegories, and especially the metaphors, seem tohave been applied in the religious context not merely as literary devices, but in amore or less “identive” function as a means to approach the suprasensual, as guidesto contemplation and enlightenment.5. The didactic or psychagogic applications of figurative expression in re-ligious or philosophical contexts deserve close attention from specialists within thecontext of the modern theory of literature."},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"188Teun Goudriaan6.

PayneJapan has been described as “the extreme eastern limit of Indian cultural diffu-sion.”1 Part of that diffusion is the Shingon tradition, which is a Buddhist form ofTantra. Shingon was formally established in Japan at the beginning of the ninthcentury by the monk K ̄ukai (K ̄ob ̄o Daishi). He reports that during his journey toChina (804 to 806), he received initiation into the two main ritual lineages ofTantric Buddhism that were at that time present in China.2 One of these isassociated with the Vajradh ̄atu Ma ̧n ̧dala, while the other is associated with theMah ̄akarunagarbha Ma ̧n ̧dala. K ̄ukai consciously worked to create a new synthesis,based on an integration of these two ritual lineages.3There is a great distance then, both geographic and cultural, between Shin-gon and the Hindu forms of Tantra. Examination of the ritual practices of Shin-gon, however, reveals a number of significant similarities with Hindu Tantra.Indeed, ritual themes, such as the use of fire, can be traced back to the Vedic ritualtradition.4 Some ritual themes can be traced even farther back to Indo-Europeanforms of ritual practice.This essay will focus on the homa (Jap.: goma), a votive ritual in whichofferings are made into a fire. The homa plays a very important part in Shingonand is widely performed in contemporary Japan. It was brought to Japan alongwith many other Tantric rituals as part of the Shingon ritual corpus.5 The Shingonhoma is important to the study of the roots of Tantra because it is found in bothBuddhist and Hindu Tantra and because it has Vedic and Indo-European antece-dents. The Shingon tradition in Japan is a living tradition, having a voluminousbody of literature, including detailed ritual manuals and both classical and con-temporary exegeses of the rituals. As such Shingon provides an important body ofmaterials for the search for the roots of Tantra.In the Shingon tradition a three-way identification is made as part of thehoma ritual. The three terms of the identification are (1) the altar, hearth, and fire;(2) the deities evoked in the ritual; (3) the practitioner himself. The mouth of thehearth is at the same time the mouth of the deity6 and the practitioner’s ownmouth. The various offerings placed in the fire are identified with the deity and"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"194Richard K. Paynewith the practitioner’s delusions.7 Just as the fire transforms the various physicalofferings, the visualized offerings are transformed within the body of the deity intolimitless offerings made to all deities. At the same time the practitioner’s delusionsare purified into the fundamentally pure consciousness that is inherently thepractitioner’s own. Given this three way identification, the practitioner feedshimself, offering aspects of himself to himself, and transforms himself through thepower of his own flaming wisdom. The tongues of flame rising from the hearth areat the same time the deity’s tongue and his own.Thehoma and the three-fold identification provide a means for elucidatingthe continuities between the Shingon ritual tradition, the Vedic ritual traditionand the Indo-European roots of Vedic ritual culture. The continuities examinedhere can be grouped under three rubrics: (1) characteristics of the ritual use of fire;(2) identification of the ritual fire with people; (3) identification of the ritual firewith the gods.Across the range of Indo-European, Vedic and Tantric ritual use of fire, oneof the continuities is the significance given to the shape of the hearth upon whichthe fire is built. Georges Dum ́ezil has elucidated the structural similarities betweenthe Roman fires and the Vedic. The Vedic ritual tradition typically uses three fires,one built on a circular hearth, one built on a square hearth, and one built on ademilune hearth.8 The circular g ̄arhapatiya (domestic fire) hearth corresponds tothe householder and to the earth. Its fire must be kept burning at all times. If itgoes out, it can only be lit again “from a fire produced by friction, saved from anearlier sacrificial fire, or taken, regardless of the rank of the sacrificer, from thehouse of a vai ́sya.”9 Similarly, in Rome the fire of Vesta is kept on a circular hearth,is maintained perpetually, and if extinguished, may be lit again only from afriction-born fire.10 Rather than the earthly existence of some individual house-holder, it is the earthly existence of Rome as a social unity to which the circular fireof Vesta corresponds.11In the Vedic ritual enclosure, the g ̄arhapatya is at the western end of an east-west axis, while the ̄ahavan ̄ıya (seat of the deity) is at the eastern end of this axis.The ̄ahavan ̄ıya is lit from the g ̄arhapatya and is kept on a square hearth andcorresponds to the heavenly realm of the gods, for “it is this fire whose smoke bearsthe gifts of men from this world to the gods.”12 In some instances the fires devotedto various deities were temporary, rather than perpetual fires, and they were litbefore square (or at least quadrangular) temples. The function of these fires is thesame as the ̄ahavan ̄ıya, for their purpose “is only to carry the offering to itsinvisible recipient.”13The third, the dak ̧sin ̄agni (southern fire), of the Vedic complex correspondsto the fires of the Roman god Volcanus. The function of the dak ̧sin ̄agni is toprotect the ritual performance from demonic influences. The association with thesouthern direction has been explained by reference to the geopolitics of the Indo-European nomads’ movement from west to east across north India.14 The southwas the direction of the indigenous, non-Aryanized population; the southerly"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"195Tongues of Flamedirection continues to have an inauspicious association in present-day Hinduism.“The Roman god Volcanus . . . is the fire which, for good or evil, devours anddestroys. Thus, useful and dangerous at the same time, he has his temple outsidethe walls.”15 Dum ́ezil thus finds the dak ̧sin ̄agnifire and the fires of Volcanus canbe equated both by function and by location.Just as the fire of Vesta served to represent the unified whole of Rome, so,according to Walter Burkert, the “ever burning hearth in the temple at Delphi wassometimes seen as the communal hearth for the whole of Greece.”16 Hestia isambiguous, being an anthropomorphized deity, while at the same time Hestia “isthe normal word for hearth, the centre of house and family.... The hearth is anoffering place for libations and small gifts of food.”17 The same ambiguity ispresent in the figure of Agni as well, for he is both a deity and the fire itself.Staal has pointed out the structural similarities between Vedic and Iranianritual practices: “The Iranian fire ritual is in many respects similar to the Vedic.Fires are installed on three altars. The domestic altar is circular, the offering altar,square . . . In Iran, fires were also transported.”18 One example of movement ofthe fires in the Vedic context is in the complex series of rites of the Agnicayana.During the first twelve days of the Agnicayana the ritual fire is first transportedfrom the home of the yajam ̄ana (sacrificer) to the ritual enclosure and is thenmoved from one hearth to another during the course of the ensuing ritual.19The use of differently shaped hearths continues into the Tantric Buddhisttradition. There are five kinds of rituals known to the Shingon tradition, and thereis a form of the homa found in each of these five categories. The five categories ofrites are the ́s ̄antika for “stopping calamities,” the pau ̧s ̧tika for “increasing meritand obtaining prosperity,” the ̄abhic ̄araka for “subduing devils and adversaries,”theva ́ s ̄ıkarana for “achieving love and respect from others,” and the a ̇nku ́sa for“’summoning” sentient beings to enable them to attain higher states of exis-tence.”20 The altar hearth for the ́s ̄antika homa (Jap.: soku sai) is circular; that forthepau ̧s ̧tika homa (Jap.: zo yaku) is square; that for the ̄abhic ̄araka (Jap.: go buku) istriangular; that for the va ́ s ̄ıkarana (J: kei ai) is shaped like an eight-petaled lotus;and that for the a ̇nku ́sa (Jap.: ko sho) is either a demilune or vajra shape.21Another set of homologies with the shape of the hearth is discussed byWayman in his work on the Guhyasam ̄aja Tantra, a Tantra that seems to countfour types of homa, in contrast to the five employed in the Shingon tradition.Wayman has asserted that the shape of the hearths is also the shape of the cakrasvisualized within the body of the practitioner: “the fire-disk at the throat (or neck)is shaped like a bow [that is, demilune, R.K.P.]; the water-disk at the heart iscircular in shape; the wind disk at the navel is triangular; and the earth disk in thesacral place is square.”22 In addition, they are also linked to the four elements and“the shapes of the four continents of Pur ̄a ̧nic mythology.”23There is continuity from the Indo-European tradition, through the Vedic tothe Tantric concerning the significance of the shape of the altar-hearth. What isless clearly continuous, however, is the specific meaning attributed to individual"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"196Richard K. Payneshapes. As indicated by Wayman’s comments, further exploration of this may wellrequire the introduction of many other kinds of homologies.In addition to the significance given to the shape of the hearth upon whichthe ritual fire is built, Indo-European, Vedic, and Tantric traditions also share theimage of fire as being that which conveys the offerings from the world of men tothe world of the gods and ancestors, while at the same time purifying thoseofferings. A. L. Basham has described succinctly this aspect of the Indo-Europeanritual use of fire, noting the well-known Vedic tradition that “It is through Agnithat the sacrificial offerings are brought to the gods, and as an intermediarybetween gods and men he has a very important function.”24 As mentioned pre-viously, Dum ́ezil sees a functional unity between the Vedic ̄ahavan ̄ıya and theRoman offering fires that were lit temporarily for various gods. The former is the“fire whose smoke bears the gifts of men from this world to the gods,”25 and thelatter functions “only to carry the offering to its invisible recipient.”26In the Vedic tradition one of the epithets of Agni is Vahni, the “Conveyer.”While Agni is all kinds of fire, he is most important as the sacrificial fire that,consuming the offerings, conveys them to their recipients. It is this which makesAgni so central to the Vedic ritual tradition. Agni retains this primacy of place inthe Shingon homa. The tradition has known homas organized into as many as ninesets of offerings, or as few as one. The first set of offerings is invariably made toAgni or, if there is only one set of offerings, it is made to him. Although Agni is byno means a figure of veneration in the popular cult, he is recognized to be anessential part of the ritual process.At the same time that Agni as the ritual fire conveys the offerings, he alsopurifies those offerings. A well-known expression of this dual function of Agni asboth conveying and purifying the sacrificial offerings is found in the Vi ̧s ̧nu Pur ̄a ̧na:Legend relates that one day Bhrigu cursed Agni. A woman named Pulomawas betrothed to a demon, and Bhrigu seeing that she was beautiful fell inlove with her and, after marrying her according to the Vedic rites, secretlyabducted her. But thanks to Agni’s information, the demon discovered theplace where the woman promised to him was hidden, and brought her backto his dwelling. Furious with Agni for helping the demon, Bhrigu cursedhim, saying: “Henceforth thou shalt eat of all things.” Agni demanded ofBhrigu the reason for this curse since he had only told the demon the truth.He pointed out that if a man is questioned and tells a lie he is cast into hell,along with seven generations of his ancestors and seven generations of hischildren. Moreover, the man who fails to give information is equally guilty.And Agni went on to say: “I too can hurl curses, but I respect the Brahmansand I control my anger. In truth I am the mouth of the ancestors. Whenclarified butter is offered them, they receive it thanks to me, their mouth, sohow can you tell me to eat all things?” Hearing these words, Bhrigu agreed"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"197Tongues of Flameto change his curse and said: “As the sun purifies all Nature with his lightand heat, so Agni shall purify everything which enters his flames.”27There is continuity in the Indo-European ritual tradition, and Vedic andTantric ritual traditions in the use of fire as the means by which offerings are made;this continuity includes the shape of the hearth. As might be expected, specificcorrelation between the shape of the altar-hearth and the symbolic value attributedto that shape converge the closer the traditions are to one another. While the useand meaning of fire and altars in Roman religion are only loosely linked to those inTantric religions, within the Tantric traditions themselves, such as between theBuddhist Tantric practices in Tibet and Japan, they are much more closely related.Also, the way in which fire is conceived to function in the ritual process within thesouth Asian religious context shows continuity over an extended period. In partic-ular, the Vedic and Pur ̄a ̧nic conceptions of Agni as both conveyer and purifier ofofferings seems to explain a great deal concerning the continuing centrality ofAgni in the ritual semantics of both Hindu and Buddhist Tantric homa.In addition to the function fulfilled by fire in Vedic and Tantric rituals, thereis another complex of themes clustering around the identification of fire withpeople. These themes include the ideas of fire as having sexuality, of fire beingassociated with digestion, of the Brahmin filled with tapas (internal heat) as beingequal to a ritual fire, of the sacrificer as identical with the ritual fire, of the sacrificerhimself as the offerings that are made into the fire, and of the funerary fire inwhich the sacrificer’s breathing is identified with the ritual fire.The sexual qualities of fire were expressed by the ancient Greeks when theyreferred to the hearth as the goddess Hestia. While the hearth is feminine, theGreeks identified the fire as a phallic force.28 This relation at the same time recallsthe masculine fire deity Agni and later the relation between li ̇nga and yoni in the ́Saivite tradition. The motif of masculine fire and feminine hearth is explicitly usedin Tantric rituals as well; and in Tantrism, the offerings have seminal symbolism.Wendy O’Flaherty finds the origin of attributing sexuality to the ritual firein the technology of fire production: “Springing from the natural physiologicalanalogy, the tie between Agni and Kama was supported by the Vedic symbolism ofthe two fire-sticks, the upper one male and the lower one female, whose friction isdescribed in anthropomorphic terms.”29 Given this context, we are able to con-nect ritual tapas with k ̄ama (desire).The Upani ̧sads also identify ritual with sex. The B ̧rhad ̄ara ̧nyaka Upani ̧sad30states for example:A woman’s lower part is the (sacrificial) altar: (her) hairs the (sacrificial)grass, her skin the soma-press. The two labia of the vulva are the fire in themiddle. Verily, as great as is the world of him who performs the Vajrapeyasacrifice (so great is the world of him) who, knowing this, practices sexual"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"198Richard K. Payneintercourse; he turns the good deeds of the woman into himself but he, whowithout knowing this, practices sexual intercourse, his good deeds womenturn into themselves.One of the characteristics of identifications, or homologies, of this kind is that theidentification seems to run in both directions. As described above, the body of awoman and sexual intercourse is identified with the altar and the sacrificial ritual.Elsewhere in the B ̧rhad ̄ara ̧nyaka Upani ̧sad31 the sacrificial fire is identified withthe sexual organs of a man’s wife.If a man’s wife has a lover and he hates him (wishes to injure him), let himput fire in an unbaked earthen vessel, spread out a layer of reed arrows in aninverse order, and let him offer (in sacrifice) in inverse order these reedarrows soaked in clarified butter (saying), “You have sacrificed in my fire, Itake away your in-breath, and out-breath, you so and so. You have sacrificedin my fire, I take away your sons and your cattle, you so and so. You havesacrificed in my fire, I take away your sacrifices and meritorious deeds, youso and so. You have sacrificed in my fire, I take away your hope andexpectation, you so and so. Verily, he departs from this world impotent anddevoid of merit, he whom a Brahmana who knows this curses. Thereforeone should not wish to play with the wife of one who is learned in the Vedas,who knows this, for indeed he who knows this becomes preeminent.Similarly, in another place the same Upani ̧sad, while discussing the five fires thatconstitute the round of rebirth, says that:The woman, verily, Gautama, is fire. The sexual organ itself is its fuel; thehairs the smoke, the vulva the flame, when one inserts, the coals; thepleasurable feelings the sparks; in this fire the gods offer semen. Out of thisoffering a person arises.32The equation of sacrificial fire and sex continues into the Pur ̄a ̧nas as well.Vettam Mani quotes the following description of a sacrificial fire pit from the AgniPur ̄a ̧na:On the western side is a yoni (receptacle) 10 x 15 a ̧mgulas should be made.Its depth should gradually decrease in the descending order of 6, 4, 2a ̧mgulas. In shape the yoni will be of the shape of the peepal leaf. The priestperforms the rites, himself seated to the west of the yoni and his head turnedto the east.33Mani goes on to make the symbolism explicit: “Yoni is that of ́Sakti; the Ku ̧n ̧da isher stomach. The conception about ́Sakti is that of a woman lying on her back,"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"199Tongues of Flamehead towards the east.” In other words, the priest is seated between the woman’slegs and faces toward her vagina, into which he makes offerings.Similar symbolism is found in the Hindu Tantras as well. In the Tantra ofGreat Liberation, there are instructions for the construction of an altar that in-cludes drawing a yoni yantra. A fire is lit outside the yantra and the s ̄adhaka(petitioner) is to:. . . take some fire in both palms, and wave it thrice in a circle over thesthandila [symbolizing ́Siva’s erect phallus, R.K.P] from right to left. Thenwith both knees on the ground, and meditating on Fire as the male seed of ́Siva, the worshipper should place it into that portion of the Yoni yantrawhich is nearest him.34The symbolism of impregnation is continued in the Tantric fire rituals ofBali through the symbols of pregnancy and childbirth. The text of a fire ritualtranslated by Christiaan Hooykaas says that the goddess’s “pregnancy has a seriousmeaning; this is called Homa.”35 In this case it is the birth of a son which isidentified with the kindling of the fire, referred to as the ́Siva fire. Other sexual andreproductive symbols are used elsewhere in the ritual as well.In addition to identifying ritual fire with sexual energy, digestion is alsounderstood as a kind of fire, particularly the digestion of those invested with tapas,that is, the Brahmins. In the section on the responsibilities of a householder, theLaws of Manu equates the ritual fire with the Brahmins. For example, “An offeringin the mouth-fire of Brahmanas rich in sacred learning and austerities saves frommisfortunes and from great guilt.”36 In the Shingon homa, the imagery of diges-tive fire is explicitly employed, that is in the equation of the three mouths. InIndia, being filled with tapas, not only is the digestive fire of a Brahmin equal to aritual fire, but the whole person becomes identified with the fire. According to theLaws of Manu, a Brahmin may substitute for a ritual fire: “If no (sacred) fire(is available), he shall place (the offerings) into the hand of a Brahmana; forBrahmanas who know the sacred texts declare, ‘What fire is, even such is aBrahmana.’ ”37 In Book 4 of the Laws, the same strictures concerning certainkinds of behavior are applied equally to fires and Brahmins. One is neither todefecate nor urinate while looking at either a fire or a Brahmin.38 Similarly, onewho is impure must touch neither a fire nor a Brahmin.39The Brahmin “rich in sacred learning” is one who knows the Vedas as aresult of the tapas40 generated by his own initiatory austerities. Walter O. Kaeblerpoints out that, “Relatedly, the Brahmanas continually inform us that the entirecorpus of revelation and sacred knowledge, namely the Veda, rests upon a founda-tion of tapas.”41 The tapas that forms the base of the Vedas and is the source of theBrahmin’s knowledge, is also central to Agni. “Agni, the personified and ritual fire,helps generate wisdom, vision, and knowledge for those who toil devotedly in hispresence. As noted so often, tapas is inherent in Agni’s very nature. He both"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"200Richard K. Paynepossesses and radiates tapas; he is clearly a tapasvin.”42 While Kaebler has takentapas as the center point for his examination, the homology is one that intercon-nectstapas, the transformative, experiential knowledge of the Vedas, the ritual fire,Agni, and the initiatory transformation of the Brahmins. It is this homology thatallows for a Brahmin to substitute for a ritual fire, and which leads to the require-ment that they be treated in the same fashion.Not only is the class of Brahmins identified with the ritual fire, but theconsecrated sacrificer is also identified with the fire as well. In discussing theinitiation ceremony (d ̄ık ̧s ̄a) of the Agnicayana, Ian Gonda cites the following: “Inlike manner (that is, as the gods who strode the Vi ̧s ̧nu strides through theseworlds);”43“the fire is the sacrificer’s divine body;”44 and “thed ̄ık ̧sita is Agni.”45In the same fashion, the Shingon practitioner is to identify himself with thefire. At the very beginning of the offering sequences the practitioner is to performthe following meditative identification:The heart of the Tath ̄agata is identical with ultimate reality; ultimate realityis identical with the fire of wisdom; the hearth is identical with the body ofthe Tath ̄agata; the fire is identical with the Dharmak ̄aya fire of wisdom; themouth of the hearth is identical with the mouth of the Tath ̄agata; the fire isidentical with the wisdom inside the practitioner’s body. Thus, the mouth ofthe Tath ̄agata’s body are all three identical with one another.46In addition to being identified with the fire itself, the practitioner may beidentified with various aspects of the offering ritual. In the Vedic ritual, thesacrificer and the victim of the sacrifice are identified with one another, the victimsubstituting for the sacrificer. The identification is not total, however. As explainedby Charles Malamoud, “the sacrificer seeks to show that he is at once identical to,and different from the victim. By offering up the victim, it is himself he wishesboth to offer and avoid offering. Victim and sacrificer are united nidanena,‘byesoteric identification’.”47Thematically, the practitioner as sacrifice parallels the significance given thematerial offerings made in the Shingon homa, though given here new significanceconsonant with Tantric soteriology. Each of the offerings is identified with thepractitioner’s own delusions. Just as the offerings are purified by the fire, so thedelusions are purified. Concerning this aspect of the Shingon homa, TaikoYamasaki states that, during the sacrifice, the practitioner visualizes delusionsentering the Buddha’s wisdom-flame, where they immediately reveal their essentialnature as the fuel of wisdom.48The idea of oneself as the sacrifice becomes especially concretized in thefunerary uses of fire sacrifice. Richard H. Davis, speaking of the traditional Vedicconceptions of cremation of the dead, suggests that, “If death sets in motion apassage to the realm of the ancestors, cremation is a sacrifice that conveys onethere. The funerary fire Agni is the divine power that releases the spirit, the"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"201Tongues of Flamesacrificial offering, from its earthly body and begins to transport it to the heavenlydomain of gods and ancestors.”49 Here again we find the dual function of Agni asboth purifying the offering and transporting it to the realm of the deities.Citing Madeleine Biardeau, Davis calls attention to cremation as “the onlysacrifice where the sacrificer himself becomes the victim physically consumed inthe fire.”50 This is true not only in the Vedic context, but also for contemporary ́Saiva initiates: “The ́Saivas, like the Vedic ritualists, consider the incineration ofthe physical body as a large scale oblation in the sacrificial fire.”51In the Buddhist Sarvadurgatipari ́sodhana Tantra there are two sections deal-ing with homa rites. In the first it is stated that if the practitioner uses the “flesh,bones, hair, ashes” or other similar items from the body of the deceased as a part ofthe ́s ̄antika homa (the homa for “pacification”), then the deceased “becomes freedfrom every sin.”52 More dramatically, one section gives a set of directions forperforming a homa using the entire corpse of the deceased. “In order to eliminateevil rebirths,” the practitioner places the corpse “on a mat in the center of thehearth. Then the mantrin should cover it with a cloth blessed with the mantras.Kindling the Consumer of Offerings and summoning Agni, whose body blazeswith thousands of flames and who resembles the white moon, tranquil and limit-less, he should arrange the offerings.”53Another form of identification of the practitioner with the ritual fire takesplace in the pr ̄a ̧n ̄agnihotra, a Vedic ritual in which the practitioner’s breaths areidentified with the fires of the agnihotra rite. There is a reversal of identificationsbetween the agnihotra and the pr ̄a ̧n ̄agnihotra, just as in the case of the identifica-tion of sex and fire. Through one sequence of identifications the twice-dailyperformance of the agnihotra came to be equated with breathing. This identifica-tion reaches the point that knowledge of this identity becomes a key aspect ofreestablishing the fires, should they become extinguished.54 The pr ̄a ̧n ̄agnihotra isan ever-present sacrifice that can substitute for the daily performance of theagnihotra rite itself. The reversal takes place when the agnihotra is explained asbeing concerned with the maintenance of the sacrificer and his continuousbreathing of the pr ̄a ̧n ̄agnihotra.55The internal quality of the pr ̄a ̧n ̄agnihotra recalls the interior homa of theShingon Tantric tradition. According to Bodewitz, “The connection between thepr ̄a ̧n ̄agnihotra and some forms of Tantric p ̄uj ̄a is based on the fact that bothrepresent an interiorization (of the Vedic rites and of the external p ̄uj ̄a).”56 Forexample, in his commentary on the Mah ̄avairocana S ̄utra, the Chinese monkI-Hsing asserts that “in general the meaning of Homa is with the fire of wisdom toburn the kindling of the kle ́sas until all are entirely consumed.”57 The develop-ment of the pr ̄a ̧n ̄agnihotra involves an interiorization of the agnihotra offering thatis at least thematically similar to the relation between the inner homa and the outerhoma. However, Bodewitz has noted: “In using the term ‘interiorization’ oneshould be aware of the fact that several disconnected phenomena are covered bythis rather vague word.”58"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"202Richard K. PayneBeyond what the two rites share concerning the interiorization of ritual, inboth cases this interiorization does not involve the rejection of ritual per se.Summarizing I-Hsing’s instructions concerning the homa, Michael Strickmannsays: “If one is able to provide the requisite offerings, it should be carried out inconjunction with the meditative rite. Otherwise, the Inner Homa may be per-formed by itself. Yet it is illicit solely to realize Homa in the heart if one doeshave the wherewithal to accomplish the outer rite.”59 In connection with thepr ̄a ̧n ̄agnihotra Bodewitz has said, “The development is not (exclusively) fromVedic ritualism to non-Vedic or post-Vedic non-ritualism and anti-ritualism. Theritualism generally remains in one or other form. Its object and consequently itsperformance and external features change.”60 Bodewitz’s conclusions concerningthe continuation of ritualism make the ritualism of the Tantras appear less as acurious regression than a part of an ongoing, developing ritual tradition.Thus, in a variety of ways people are identified with the ritual fire. Sex anddigestion,tapas-filled Brahmins and tapas-filled consecrated sacrificers, the practi-tioner as an offering and the practitioner’s corpse as an offering, and finally thepractitioner’s breath have all been equated with the ritual fire.Perhaps the very oldest of the components found in the Tantric homa is theview of fire as a god. Such a notion may be both prehistoric and universal since fireis such a great transformative force. The existential significance of fire is so greatthat it may be the origin of religion itself. The sacrificial use of fire is knownthroughout the entire range of Indo-European religions and in the Vedic traditionfire is known by the name Agni, which is clearly reflected in many Indo-Europeancognate words.61 As mentioned previously, Agni is ambiguously both a deity andelemental fire. Fritz Staal says:Though considered a god, he is never disconnected from his element, fire,until later Hindu mythology, where he appears in more anthropomorphicterms. In the ̧Rgveda, Agni is brilliant, golden, has flaming hair and beard,three or seven tongues, his face is light, his eyes shine, he has sharp teeth, hemakes a cracking noise, and leaves a black trail behind. He is fond ofclarified butter..., but he also eats wood and devours the forest. In fact,he eats everything (vi ̧sva-ad). He is in particular a destroyer of demons and aslayer of enemies.62The centrality of Agni to Vedic ritual is well-known. From the simplest, theAgnihotra, in which libations are made into fire twice daily, to the most complex,the Agnicayana, which after weeks of preparation requires twelve days and theservices of seventeen priests to perform, the making of offerings into fire forms aconsistent theme. This practice continues in the homa of the Tantric traditions,both Hindu and Buddhist, and the figure of Agni himself retains his importancein both traditions as well. In the Shingon homa the first set of offerings is made toAgni. The Fire Deity is invited to receive the offerings, and to manifest in the"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"203Tongues of Flameflames of the hearth. Placing a flower on top of the burning wood in the hearth,the practitioner makes a meditation mudr ̄a and visualizes the flower going to thecenter of the hearth. The visualization continues with the flower transforming intoa lotus seat for the deity. Above the seat the syllable ra ̧m is visualized in Siddhamscript. The syllable ra ̧m changes into a wish-fulfilling jar and then the wish-fulfilling jar changes into the four-armed form of Agni. “His first right hand formsthemudr ̄a of fearlessness, in the second is held a rosary, in his first left hand isgrasped a sage’s staff, in the second is grasped a water bottle (ku ̧n ̧dik ̄a). Surround-ing his body is a blaze of flames.”63Agni takes similar place of primacy in the homa of the ́Saiva tradition ofsouth India. At the beginning of the homa described in the Soma ́sambhupaddhatithe following directions are given:IV. 10. The officiant then completes the union of the three fires; the fire ofthe stomach, the fire of the Bindu, and the terrestrial fire; then he places(into the fire) the consciousness of Vahni, by means of the b ̄ıj ̄a of Vahni(HRUM): “Om Hrum, before the consciousness of Vahni I bow!”64Here Agni is addressed by his epithet Vahni, the Conveyer.65 However, beyond thesimple continuity provided by the presence of Agni in his role as Conveyer ofOfferings in this ́Saivite Tantric homa, we find a similar threefold identification asin the performance of the Shingon homa. The ritual identification of the practi-tioner with the deity involves the union of the three fires, that of the fire of thestomach, the fire of the bindhu (ritual dot), and that of the ritual fire, referred to inthe text as the terrestrial fire. Following this threefold identification, Agni is madepresent in the ritual fire. According to H ́el`ene Brunner-Lachaux, it is this whichchanges the fire from an “inert fire” into a “divine fire.”66 The importance ofprojecting the consciousness of Agni into the ritual fire following the visualizedunion of the three fires is that it makes the fire actually effective, Agni is present,ready to transmit the offerings. The importance of the inner homa mentionedpreviously is much the same in the Shingon tradition. I-Hsing says that if one wereto perform only the outer homa and not the inner, then “One would simply beburning the kindling and vainly using up the offerings. Not only would one becommitting a profane act, but moreover it would be devoid of efficacy.”67Not only is Agni made present in the flames of the ritual fire, but so aremany other deities. In other words, the fire may be the physical body in which adeity temporarily abides. A classic and dramatic example of a deity becomingpresent in the body of a ritual fire is found in the opening of the R ̄am ̄aya ̧na. Thisoccurs when king Da ́saratha is sacrificing in order to gain an heir. V ̄alm ̄ıki tells us:. . . as he sacrificed, there arose from the sacred fire a great being of incom-parable radiance, enormous power, and immense might. He was black andclothed in red. His mouth was red, and his voice was like the sound of a"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"204Richard K. Paynekettledrum. The hair of his body, head, and beard were as glossy as that of ayellow-eyed lion. He bore auspicious marks and was adorned with celestialornaments. His height was that of a mountain peak, and his gait that of ahaughty tiger. His appearance was like that of the sun, and he looked like aflame of blazing fire.68This theme of the fire as the physical form through which a deity manifestshimself continues into the homa practiced in Shingon. Not only are Bodhisattvas,guardian deities, celestial deities, and earthly deities invited to the altar-hearth, butthe body of the fire is identified with that of the deity. Taiko Yamasaki gives analternate description of the ritual process for evoking Agni (Jap.: Ka-ten) alreadydiscussed above:The practitioner visualizes the wisdom-flame as a syllable that changes intoa triangular flame, which then becomes the figure of Ka-ten [lit. “fire god,”that is, Agni; R.K.P.]. White in color, with four arms, the body of Ka-ten iscosmic flame. Placing a “floral tassel” on the burning fuel, the practitionervisualizes above it a throne surmounted by a syllable that first transformsinto a ritual vase and then into the figure of Ka-ten, forming the mudr ̄a offearlessness, holding a rosary, a wand, and a vase in his several hands, hisbody filled with flame. Performing the mudr ̄a and mantra of summons, thepractitioner visualizes Ka-ten being drawn into the hearth, and recites versesof invocation and welcome. The offerings then begin . . . The practitionerperforms the mudr ̄a and mantra of universal offering to transform theofferings into the universal dimension, and empowers them by reciting theverse of the three universal powers. The mouth of the hearth [which is alsosimultaneously the mouth of Agni and the mouth of the practitioner,R.K.P.] is rinsed again, and a “floral tassel” tossed into a corner of the hearthto serve as the vehicle of Ka-ten’s return to his essential realm. With themudr ̄a and mantra of dispatching the deity, Ka-ten is visualized departingfrom the hearth.69The same kind of ritual procedure is followed for each deity evoked in the flames.Within this same basic structure, the only significant modifications are in themantra employed and, in some cases, the kinds of offerings made.Divining the presence of a deity from the character of the fire would seemrelated to the idea that the deity is physically present in the fire. The Vedictradition maintains specific guidelines for interpreting the significance of fires thatappear differently from one another. In relation to the twice daily Agnihotra ritual,theKathakasa ̧mihita70 says “The flame which has a golden colour is sacred toB ̧rhaspati. When it is neither golden nor red, then it is sacred to Mitra. When it isred, then it is sacred to Varu ̧na. When it is enveloped in smoke, then it is sacred toVa r u ̧na. When it is enveloped in smoke, then it is sacred to All-gods . . . Where"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"205Tongues of Flamethe flame flickers as it were in the coals, that is his (Agni’s) mouth, Avi by name.That is Brahman. Therein should be offered.”71 Note here the motif of the fire asthe mouth of the deity as well as discerning which deity the fire is sacred toaccording to the fire’s color.According to the Mah ̄avairocana S ̄utra, one of the two texts central to theShingon tradition, there are twelve acceptable fires. Drawing some examples fromStrickmann’s summary of this section of the Mah ̄avairocana S ̄utra, the first is“named Mahendra, dignified and golden, of increasing awesomeness, coifed withflames and in a state of sam ̄adhi [deep meditation], manifesting the plenitude ofwisdom.” The second is identified as “Fullness of Action” and it “sends forth itsrays like the autumn moon, is surrounded by an auspicious wheel, and wears apearl adorned chignon and a pure white garment.” The sixth is named “Furious”and is described as “squint-eyed, fog-colored, with an upright shock of hair and anearth-shaking bellow, powerful, and displaying four fangs in his mouth.”72 Al-though it is not clear if the descriptions given in the Mah ̄avairocana S ̄utra areintended for divinatory purposes or not, the descriptions certainly do representpersonified forms of deities as different kinds of fires. Thus, not only is the ritualfire identified with Agni, but it serves as the physical body by which many otherdeities are manifest. In some cases the character of the fire itself is examined todetermine which deity is present.Several themes have been explored here that demonstrate continuity fromthe Indo-European through the Vedic to the Tantric ritual tradition. The shape ofthe hearth is symbolically significant, though the specific significance givenchanges, perhaps as a result of the differences between the various soteriologicalconceptions. A second factor affecting the change of symbolic value is change inritual practice, such as the movement from the Indo-European and Vedic threefires to the Tantric single fire. The idea of fire as both conveying and purifying theofferings carries across from the Vedic to the Tantric, while the imagery of fire asboth sexual and digestive continues as well. Fire is identified with people in avariety of ways—those filled with tapas are identical with the ritual fire, while thesacrificer may be identified with the offerings made into the flames. At the ex-treme, the corpse as a whole is an offering. While the physical body may be anoffering, the life force of the breath (pr ̄a ̧na) is homologized with the ritual fire.Deities are identified with the fire as well, the most important being Agni.Agni is central to the ritual semantics in his dual role as conveyer and purifier ofthe offerings. In addition, the body of the fire may become the temporary abode ofmany different deities, the mouth of the hearth being identified with the mouth ofthe deity, the flames within the hearth being identified with the digestive fires ofthe deity.The identification of the deity evoked with the fire is compounded by athird identification, that of the practitioner himself with both the fire and thedeity. This threefold identification occurs both in the Shingon Tantric Buddhisttradition of Japan and in the ́Saivite Tantric tradition of South India. It appears to"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"206Richard K. Paynebe the case that this threefold identification marks the division of the Tantric ritualtradition from the Indo-European and Vedic traditions. The Indo-European andVedic sacrificial offerings into fire are votive in character; the ritual logic of thisrelationship leads to the identification of the practitioner with the deity, and hencethe ritual logic of the homa leads to the threefold identification of the fire withboth the deity and the practitioner.A final point that has emerged from this examination of the practice ofmaking offerings into fires in the Vedic and Tantric traditions is the reversal ofidentifications. Once identification is made from one thing to another, the reverseidentification also becomes possible. This is the case with the sexual fires, thedigestive fires, and the breath fires.In conclusion, it can be determined that the roots of the Shingon homaritual are traceable back through China to the early medieval formation of Tantrain India. While many elements of the homa can be traced farther back to Indo-European ritual practices, the Tantric homa seems specifically to develop out ofVedic ritual and the meta-ritualistic speculations of the Br ̄ahma ̧nas, that is, theTantras appear to be much more firmly rooted in the Vedas than is usuallysuggested.Perhaps because of the long-standing tendency in Western scholarship tointerpret the Upani ̧sads as a radical break from the Br ̄ahma ̧nas, the connectionbetween the ritual speculations of the Br ̄ahma ̧nas and the philosophic speculationsof the Upani ̧sads has been overlooked. As Brian K. Smith has said:It is a remarkable fact about the Western reconstruction of the Vedic religionthat whereas the great identities of the Vedantic Upani ̧sads (linking themicrocosmic true self to the macrocosmic One in and expression of mysticalunity) have always seemed to inspire admiration, statements of equivalencein the ritualistic Br ̄ahma ̧nas are often scorned and disdained as so muchmumbo jumbo from the imagination of priests.73One begins to suspect a hostility toward ritual per se as the cause of distinctionsbetween the Br ̄ahma ̧nas and the Upani ̧sads. However, the continuities betweenthe Br ̄ahma ̧nas and the Upani ̧sads seem to be part of the larger continuity betweenthe Vedic and the Tantric tradition.Some scholars have suggested that the Tantras represent a resurgence of pre- ̄Aryan religion. This seems to be what Snellgrove is suggesting, for example, whenhe asserts that Tantra should not be seen as a decadent form of Buddhism. Rather,“One might even claim that these new elements far from issuing in a degenerationbrought about a rejuvenation, nourished in the hidden well-springs of Indianreligious life.”74 Kvaerne, citing Eliade, is more explicit, suggesting that the posi-tive evaluation of women found in Tantra is “an aspect of a general resurgence ofthe non- ̄Aryan religious substratum, manifested in the Tantric movement, Hindu"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"207Tongues of Flameas well as Buddhist, that is, a resurgence of a religious universe in which the role ofthe female creative force, manifested in every woman, comes to the fore.”75While it may well be that some or many of the important elements of Tantracan be traced back to pre- ̄Aryan, indigenous forms, two problems remain. First,there are many other important Tantric elements that can be traced back to Vedicsources. Concerning one of the most important elements, interiorization, was pre-Vedic.”76 Thus, Tantra as a self-conscious movement cannot simply be seen as aresurgence of pre- ̄Aryan, indigenous religious forms. Second, so little is knowndefinitely about pre- ̄Aryan, indigenous religion that it seems to approach thequality of an inkblot—the meaning found there is drawn from the observer ratherthan from the object. There is a danger in attributing the meaning of objects andpractices that are known from a later period to objects and practices from an earlierperiod that appear to be similar.Perhaps the suggestions that Tantra arises from a resurgence of pre- ̄Aryanreligion—rather than seeing it simply as a development within Indian religiousculture—result in part from the actual history. Once periods are identified, theyseem to cry out for characterization. How the religious traditions of periods arecharacterized is all too vulnerable to the subtle influence of our own expectations.Then again, once a tradition at a given point in time is identified and charac-terized, the “problem” arises of how to explain its transition into another period.Thus, the Vedic period is typically described as ritualistic, while the period of theUpani ̧sads, Buddhism, and Jainism are characterized as non- or anti-ritualistic.The challenge then is how to explain such an apparent transition. Similarly, theperiod of the Upani ̧sads, Buddhism, and Jainism is characterized as philosophicand meditative, while the Tantric period, both Buddhist and Hindu, is charac-terized as superstitious, decadent, and ritualistic. How can one then explain thistransition? Such problems may in fact be only the appearance of a problem, apseudo-problem resulting more from the way in which the traditions and periodshave been characterized, than from what is revealed by a detailed examination ofthe continuities. While we may not be able to escape from periods and theircharacteristics, I suspect that the vast majority of them are only heuristic inquality—useful devices whose conventional character must be kept in mind.Within Buddhism one of the metaphors for the teachings of the tradition is that ofa raft. Having reached the shore, one should leave the raft at the water’s edge.Although as scholars our task is different from that of the individual seekingenlightenment, the cautionary note of the tale may prove a useful device for us aswell.The Tantric homa demonstrates a relatively high degree of continuity withearlier ritual practices. The rich complex of homologies, which serves as thecognitive base for much religious practice in India, seems to provide ample re-sources for the development of the threefold identification of the Tantric homa outof the existing tradition, once the catalyst of the identification of the practitionerand the deity is added. In the absence of clear evidence that such a soteriological"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"208Richard K. Payneconcept is to be found in pre-Indo-European Indus civilizations, the uniquethreefold identification of the Tantric homa is perhaps best understood to be anovel creation.NOTES1.

In this essay, I explore tworelated, though separable, symbolic contexts for the Hindu Tantric deity Bhairava,as well as the interaction between two varieties of s ̄adhana for achieving deificationas Bhairava. The exploration of what is involved in “becoming Bhairava” in thesetwo contexts not only reveals an important shift in the meaning of “Bhairava,” italso allows an approach to the very rich notion of the khecar ̄ı or bhairav ̄ımudr ̄a(ritual gestures). I hope that this exploration of the meaning of Bhairava willcontribute to an understanding of an important ideological shift in the develop-ment of the early Hindu Tantra.The intent in this essay is not so much historiographical as it is patentlyhermeneutic. To understand the roots of the Hindu Tantra, we must uncover theradical and crucial interpretive shifts that contribute to its successful ideologicalconsolidation. Thus it is useful to examine the symbolism of the Tantric deity,Bhairava, a figure who straddles two domains in early Hindu Tantra. On onehand, the symbolism of Bhairava is connected to ̄ave ́sa-s ̄adhana, that is, thecremation-ground culture of possession by hordes of demonic female deities led bythe frightful, fanged deity known as Rudra-Bhairava.2 On the other hand, andespecially in the hands of the brilliant early expositor of Hindu Tantra, theKashmiri ́Saiva teacher Abhinavagupta (tenth century ..), Bhairava is rein-terpreted in terms of what could be called the sam ̄ave ́sa-s ̄adhana, the Tantric-yogicexploration of the nondual consciousness.3 Here, Bhairava comes to mean theunencompassable and exquisitely blissful light of consciousness that is to bediscovered as the practitioner’s true inner identity.These two aspects of Bhairava may be examined using as a locus text inwhich the boundary between these two domains is clearly discernible.

Muller-Ortegaverses were deemed sufficiently important by Abhinavagupta that he commentedon them twice, once in his Par ̄atr ̄ı ́sik ̄a-laghuv ̧rtti (PTlv) and once in his PTv.5 Infact, it is in these commentaries that we find important evidence for the process bywhich what we are calling the ̄ave ́sa-s ̄adhana mutates into what may be termed thesam ̄ave ́sa-s ̄adhana. In this process, the demonic figure of Bhairava mutates andexpands to include the apparently benign philosophical concept of a Tantricabsolute reality. The attempt here will be to exploit selectively the thematicrichness of a passage drawn from this work to explore several important symbolicthemes related to this absolutizing transformation. Moreover, the exploration ofthis passage and the sequence of development within the early Hindu Tantra thatit typifies illustrate aspects of the complex and problematic interplay between thedomain of ritual techniques and the realm of meditative practices.A standard scholarly gambit attempts to drive useful interpretive wedges inthe gap between a text and its commentaries. It is, however, quite difficult toexploit these interstices when the only context we have for a text is its commentary.An example of this in the study of dar ́sana (viewing) is the attempt to read theYoga-s ̄utras outside of Vy ̄asa’sYoga-bh ̄a ̧sya and other subcommentaries. If theseattempts have shown us anything, it is that it is difficult to do so in anything morethan a speculative fashion.6 In the case of the PT verses, we have even less to go onthan the Yoga-s ̄utras.It is even more difficult to explore this gap when such a commentaryestablishes a new and subsuming paradigm that encompasses the original text in aplausible way. Such is the case with Abhinavagupta’s commentary entitled TheShort Gloss on the PT (Par ̄a-tr ̄ı ́sik ̄a-laghuv ̧rtti ).7 Here, the seamless continuity ofAbhinavagupta’s encompassing commentary on the PT verses tends to obscure theoriginal ritual and experiential context of these verses. With ingenuity, Ab-hinavagupta overlays a doctrine of non-dual consciousness on the original andmuch less clearly doctrinal ̄Agamic text. In his synthetic Trika-Kaula elaborationof the doctrine of Recognition (that Abhinavagupta inherited from his pre-decessor, Utpaladeva), he doubles back to the PT verses to weave them into asophisticated system. Thus, he embeds them in the complex ideology of the Heartwith its related notions of the kula or Embodied Cosmos, the vi ̧sarga- ́sakti orEmissional Power of the continuous cosmogony, and the esoteric language phi-losophy of the m ̄at ̧rk ̄ a (sound).The PT verses relay the secret teaching of a particular mantra (verse or ́sloka9), the so-called Heart-mantra (H ̧rdayab ̄ıja), SAU ̧H. They then describe in thenext seven verses, the visionary engulfing of the consciousness of the practitionerby the ́saktis (powers) that the s ̄adhaka courts. Having received the impelling andinitiatory descent of energy ( ́saktip ̄ata)8 from the Guru, the s ̄adhaka who diligentlyremembers the mantra, S-AU- ̧H, progressively penetrates into a condition ofmeditative absorption (sam ̄ave ́sa) in which he comes face to face with a host ofdivinized beings: the Mothers (M ̄at ̧rs), the Mistresses of Yoga (Yoge ́svar ̄ıs), theHeroes perfected by the practice of the secret ritual (V ̄ıras), the Lords of the Heroes"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"215Becoming Bhairava(V ̄ıre ́svaras), the powerful Siddhas, and the ́S ̄akin ̄ıs, such as the Khecar ̄ıs. Thesebeings are experienced as inhabiting the s ̄adhaka’s body and appearing before himready to do his bidding, to foretell the future, reveal the past, or grant any desire.9In his commentary on the verses, Abhinavagupta states that when medita-tive absorption is sufficiently strong, the meditator achieves a vision of the deity hedesires by placing the mantra connected with this deity in his Heart conscious-ness.10 Thus, for Abhinavagupta, meditative vision constitutes a process of draw-ing near ( ̄a-k ̧r) or attracting the divine beings already resident in the body of thes ̄adhaka by coalescing their form or shape ( ̄ak ̧rti) out of consciousness through theuse of a mantra. Attracted in this way, the deity will appear before the s ̄adhaka,drawn there by the Powers of Rudra, and will become identical with the practi-tioner’s own body.11Abhinavagupta clarifies that the divine beings reveal themselves because thes ̄adhaka has become Bhairava, the Lord of the Wheel of Powers ( ́sakticakre ́svara),thekule ́svara, the Lord of the Embodied Cosmos. The s ̄adhaka becomes identicalto Bhairava who is at once the supreme consciousness and the naked beggar. Thisdual identity of Bhairava as both anthropomorphic and non-anthropomorphic oras both sakala (the composite form of the personified deity) and ni ̧skala (thetranscendent form of nondual consciousness) circumscribes the complex andambiguous nature of the meaning of deification for this Tantric environment.12In Abhinavagupta’s formulation which emphasized the ni ̧skala but does notexclude the sakala, this intense form of meditative s ̄adhana represents an inte-riorized ritual of worship that centers on the production of the blissful nectar(ekarasa) of nonduality, and combines a method for liberation with the achieve-ment of supernatural powers. At the core of this method is the notion of remem-bering (sm ̧r): the recognitional process of anamnesis by which the s ̄adhak ̄a recupe-rates the essential and preexistent identity with ́Siva-Bhairava.13A key term that underscores the apparent exegetical divergence of thecommentary from the text is the notion of ̄ave ́sa (verse 11), which in the originaltext seems to mean something like demonic possession. In Abhinavagupta’s com-mentary, ̄ave ́sa appears to be reinterpreted to mean a state of yogic and meditativeabsorption, that is, sam ̄ave ́sa. Thus, in the shift from text to commentary, twolevels seem to be discernible—in the original PT verses, the s ̄adhana of possessionemphasizing the encounter with external anthropomorphic deities separate fromthes ̄adhaka and, in terms of Abhinavagupta’s gloss, the s ̄adhana of Recognition,centering on the phenomenology of non-dual consciousness. Let us examine thesenotions in further detail.In the PT, it is Bhairava who instructs the Goddess in the secret of the Heartand its all-powerful mantra, SAU ̧H. Bhairava is the form of ́Siva encountered inthePT and in many of the other revealed texts in nondual Kashmiri ́Saivism. Theterm Bhairava derives from the root bh ̄ı (to be afraid) and the related adjectivebh ̄ıru (fearful, timid).14 By a curious process of inversion, Bhairava comes to meanthat which is terrifying and frightful. Depictions of him show a sinister, fanged"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"216Paul E. Muller-Ortegaface often surmounted by writhing and venomous serpents that convey the fury ofthe god of death who is also, paradoxically, the god of transformation andrelease.15The myth tells us that ́Siva punishes the creator god, Brahm ̄a, for his sin ofarrogance by cutting off one of his heads with the nail of his left thumb. Nowguilty of the sin of Brahminicide, ́Siva as Bhairava Bhik ̧s ̄atana is condemned towander, begging for alms and carrying Brahm ̄a’s skull, which remains attached tohis hand. The naked skull bearer of K ̄ap ̄alika, carrying the trident, draped insinuous serpents, and accompanied by dogs, serves as the expiatory of ́Siva’s sin.The skull finally drops off when Bhairava atones for his sin by entering theprecincts of the holy city of Benares.16Many powerful Tantric themes are packed into the figure of Bhairava. Thisskull-bearing transgressor who is fearful and terrible resonates with the asceticcremation-ground culture of heterodox and transgressive groups who soughtpower through control of and possession by hordes of frightening goddesses.17The figure of Rudra-Bhairava, especially when he is connected with the Yogin ̄ıs, ́S ̄akin ̄ıs, or M ̄at ̧rk ̄ as, alerts us to the deeply transgressive tradition that the PTverses inherit. With roots that go at least as far back as the early P ̄a ́supatas andK ̄ap ̄alikas,18 this cremation-ground culture then flourishes in the cult of theYogin ̄ıs, powerful ́saktis (energies) who came to inhabit actual women through astate of possession and with whom the male initiates ritually copulated in order toproduce the commingled sexual fluids of the sacrificial liquid (argha orku ̧n ̧dagolaka)19 offered back to these deities. Moreover, children born from therituals were said to be “born from the yogin ̄ı” (the phrase occurs in ́sloka 10).Abhinavagupta himself was said to be “born of the yogin ̄ı” that is, conceivedduring his parents’ practice of a later form of this very same sexual ritual.20The examination of these eroto-mystical or sexo-yogic elements takes usbeyond our current scope. It is important to note that in the move from text tocommentary—in the shift from ̄ave ́sa s ̄adhana to sam ̄ave ́sa s ̄adhana—these power-ful ritual themes are in no way eradicated by the superimposition on them of theideology of nondual consciousness. This is clearly evident from the coded descrip-tions of the kula-yag ̄a or secret ritual given by Abhinagagupta in the chapter 29 oftheTantr ̄aloka (TA).21 Here, elaborating on his own left-handed ritual, one en-counters the same theme of imbibing of the fluids that emerge from the mouth oftheyogin ̄ı,22 a multivalent sexual reference with important alchemicalcomponents.Thus, as a result of the interpretive strategies of Abhinavagupta, the termBhairava (or bhairavat ̄a, or bhairavasvar ̄upa) expands beyond its mythic and per-sonified identity and comes to stand for the Ultimate itself, the huge abyss of theunbounded and uncontainable light of consciousness. To attain Bhairava in thisyogic sense is to enter into the experience of the all-encompassing and nondualreality of ultimate consciousness. In the hands of this authoritative expositor of theTantra, the older ritually embedded conceptions become the synthetic Trika-"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"217Becoming BhairavaKaula which, permeated with nondualism, transforms these older cults of posses-sion into a yogic of left-handed Tantra. Dominated by an overarching inquiry intothe power of Ultimate consciousness—of Bhairava conjoined with the Goddess—Abhinavagupta’s commentaries transmute the external goddesses into the frenziedenergies that emanate from the absolute reality and the secret ritual into anoccasion for the s ̄adhaka’s recognition of Bhairava as constituting the true inneridentity.Here I would like to explore two themes in which unfold the meaning ofAbhinavagupta’s formulation of what we are calling the sam ̄ave ́sa s ̄adhana. Essen-tially, the sam ̄ave ́sa s ̄adhana may be said to occur in two phases. In the first, thepractitioner progresses in the absorption into Bhairava. By pronunciating themantra, the s ̄adhaka experiences progressive interiorization that finally reveals thereality of the nondual consciousness in the state of tur ̄ıy ̄a (highest state) or theinwardly enclosed samadhi (profound meditation). As this state is continuouslypursued and assiduously consolidated, there is a second phase of the sam ̄ave ́sas ̄adhana. In an apparent directional reversal, Bhairava—as the ultimate un-bounded consciousness—begins to be absorbed into the finite levels of the mind,senses, and body of the practitioner. In the first phase, the nondual consciousnessis located within the deepest layer of being as the transcendent principle, thesupreme Bhairava beyond the sequence of the thirty-six tattvas (principles ofmatter)—beyond the vibratory matrix, beyond the emergent kula (body)-explicate23 of relative reality. In the second phase, the entire display of thirty-sixprinciples, the whole vibratory field, the kula-explicate, is invaded by the nondualconsciousness to such a degree that it comes to be experienced as floating non-differently within the ocean of nondual consciousness. Let us look at these twoaspects.In ́sloka 11 of the PT, the centrality of pronuncing of the mantra is an-nounced. It says, “When the mantra has been ‘pronounced,’ the entire greatmultitudes of mantras and mudr ̄as appear immediately before him, characterizedby absorption in his own body.”24 Crucial to understanding the process of sa-m ̄ave ́sa through pronunciation (ucc ̄ara) of the mantra are ideas surrounding the ́Saivite notion of spanda (pulsating life) that view reality as composed of aninfinitely complex vibratory web.25 Tantric ́Saivism insists that the vibratoryenergies that compose physical reality are themselves condensed manifestations ofultimate consciousness. ́Saivite tradition also suggests a unifying continuity be-tween the realms of physical reality, the activities of sense perception, and all formsof interior awareness. All are seen as phenomenal manifestations of the ultimateconsciousness that exists enmeshed in a complex vibratory matrix.26Within the anuttara (supreme), there occurs continuously a subtle pulsationthat does not alter the stillness of the absolute. This is the spanda that animates theultimate consciousness. Employing a variety of metaphors, the tradition glossesspanda by the term sphuratt ̄a, the scintillating pulse of the supreme light thatcontinuously trembles with its own innate incandescence. In sonic terms, the"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"218Paul E. Muller-Ortegaspanda is glossed as the n ̄a ̧da (tone vibration), the subtle but powerful resonanceechoing through the supreme. In an important metaphoric shift, supreme con-sciousness is likened to the ocean of Soma (am ̧rta), the nectar of immortalityflowing in liquid streams or waves.27In cosmogonic terms, it is the primordial spanda that continuously man-ifests the emergence of space and time and all visible universes. The supremespanda releases a vibrating spectrum of energies that originate within the supreme(anuttara). As the infinitely fast vibration of the anuttara systematically coalescesand condenses into progressively slower and thicker vibrations, tangible, percep-tible forms emerge from the void and formlessness of the ultimate consciousness.These apparently solid appearances are called cognitions (par ̄amar ́sa) and they areunderstood as complex interference patterns that arise in the intermerging cross-whirl of energies created by the interaction of vibratory consciousness within itself.Indeed, in the first part of the PTlv, Abhinavagupta takes up the explication of thesonic vibratory matrix in terms of the phonemic structure of Sanskrit. It is pre-cisely within this ideology of vibratory matrices that Abhinavagupta interprets theoriginal ́s ̄aktis—them ̄at ̧rk ̄ as—as “the mighty troop of the ́S ̄akin ̄ıs” ( ́sloka 15, PT).Thusspanda, which is the very life to the supreme light of the unitary conscious-ness, animates and discloses the unfolding multiplicity of phenomena that arecontained within the infinite potentiality of that light.28At the same time, spanda unifies and encompasses all that has emergedwithin its primordial embrace and reenfolds endlessly the manifested totality backinto the supreme light of consciousness. The unfolding/enfolding reality is theh ̧rdaya, the expanding and contracting Heart of consciousness from which allthings ebb and flow. In describing the Heart, Abhinavagupta makes the funda-mental equation of his exegetical transformation of the concept of Bhairava; hesays:The Heart is the subtle vibration of the triangle which consists of theincessant expansion and contraction of the three powers, and it is the placeof repose, the place of supreme bliss. This very Heart is the Self of Bhairava,of that which is the essence of Bhairava, and of the Blessed Supreme God-dess who is inseparable and non-different from Him.29Far removed from the original fanged deity of the earlier ritual conceptions,Bhairava thus emerges as the all-encompassing reality, the absolute thateffortlesslycontains all manifestational realities.Implicit within Tantric ́Saivism there are a variety of spatial metaphorsindicating the relative positioning attention within this vibratory matrix: aboveandwithin indicate the subtler forms of vibration that correspond to inwardlyabsorbed awareness; below and outside point to the cruder and more condensedforms of the physical world. From the innermost subtle above, the outer forms are"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"219Becoming Bhairavanourished and sustained, rooted to the primordial source-vibration. Connectingthe outer forms to the formless, ultimate consciousness, there stands the branchingvibratory matrix, the web of pulsating light, or resonant sound, or liquidly flowingenergies, and it is these that make up the extended body of the s ̄adhaka’s con-sciousness.30 Thus, from the relatively superficial activities of sense perception tothe progressively subtler forms of inner awareness, there spans a unified spectrumof levels of the spanda that lead inward until the most delicate and powerfultendrils of individuality merge with the infinitely fast vibration of the ultimateconsciousness.All of these ideas inform the notion of the pronunciation of the mantra,which leads to the great vision of the ́saktis and the recognition of Bhairava. Topronounce the mantra, then, is to begin the great inward traverse of this spectrumof vibratory frequencies that will lead the s ̄adhaka deeper into the absorption thatreveals the interior presence of the multitude of powers, and that finally disclosedBhairava—the supreme, undifferentiated consciousness—as the deepest and mostauthentic identity of the practitioner.In this way, in the traditional progression of s ̄adhana, Bhairava first becomesaccessible in the enstatic state of t ̄uriya, which the advanced yogin stabilizes bygaining proficiency in the nim ̄ılana or closed-eyed sam ̄adhi. However, contrary toearlier yogic notions, for the Tantrin the journey of consciousness does not termi-nate in this introvertive condition; indeed, the practitioner attempts to entice theabsolute consciousness from its self-enclosed state. The s ̄adhaka wishes to activatea dancing blissfulness within the initial, flat voidness of pure, contentless con-sciousness. It is clear that Abhinabagupta’s commentary on the PT verses is in-formed by, for example, the teachings of the Vij ̃n ̄ana-bhairava-tantra (VBh),which prescribes the secret and subtle gestures of awareness that will unfold andmagically expand the experience of this enclosed sam ̄adhi.31TheVBh urges the yogin to be alert during everyday situations—listening tothe notes of a song, observing the flow of the breath or powerful emotions (e.g.,fear, anger, or great happiness) or when waking yields to sleep; there may occur asudden, flashing expansion, a surging efflorescence of consciousness that is themanifestation of Bhairava.32 As the ́Siva S ̄utras state (I.5), udyamo bhairava ̧h(Bhairava is the surging expansion).33 Thus, in his commentary Abhinavaguptaaddresses the advanced yogin who has cultivated an inward and enclosed sam ̄adhiand urges him to a more daring stance of openness to the hidden presence ofBhairava flashing forth from the most unexpected of places. The openness willinitiate the second phase of the sam ̄ave ́sa s ̄adhana. Here the practitioner cultivatesthe open-eyed sam ̄adhi that will mature into the bhairav ̄ımudr ̄a in which the yoginbathes in all moments in the perception of unbounded consciousness.34Thus, the sam ̄ave ́sa s ̄adhana advises an alternation of introvertive states—inwhich Bhairava is discovered as concealed in the innermost depths—with extro-vertive conditions that reveal the discovery of the omnipresence of Bhairava. In"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"220Paul E. Muller-Ortegathis way, the s ̄adhaka is said to emulate the essential pulsation of the rudray ̄amala,of the expansion and contraction of the Rudra-dyad as they embrace in the Heartof reality.35The body becomes the abode of all divinities, the text tells us. All themantras and mudr ̄as come to dwell within the body of the one who pronounces theHeart mantra. Thus, in this usage the notion of the body embraces much morethan the physical body; it expands to contain the array of the subtle energies ofspeech, mind, and vital breath that connect the physical body to the absoluteconsciousness.In the first two verses of the PT, the Goddess implores Bhairava to reveal thegreat secret of the power that abides in the Heart. His statement of the secretreveals the famous khecar ̄ımudr ̄a or bhairav ̄ımudr ̄a, the condition of moving in thevoid of pure consciousness, the undifferentiated consciousness that is Bhairava.While the term mudr ̄a ordinarily refers to certain symbolic hand gestures, it isclear that in this context it is more properly translated as a “state of consciousness:”amudr ̄a in this sense is an inner gesture expressive of a state of consciousness.Thus, the practitioner attains the highest and most unimpeded state of conscious-ness in which all movement occurs solely within the field of the absolute.36In his commentary on this section, Abhinavagupta employs an importantalchemical metaphor to explain a second meaning of the term sam ̄ave ́sa. SaysAbhinavagupta:It has been said that if the principle of consciousness obtains the state ofbeing the Heart, then the condition of being free while still alive ensues.Whenever a flowing form is produced by the condition of practice, due tothe heating up of the vessel of awareness whose nature is the Heart, thatflowing by a regular absorption (sam ̄ave ́sa) the levels of body breath andmind, just like quicksilver (siddharasa) penetrating into metal, negates theinsentiency of breath and mind.37There are interesting links here to traditions of Indian alchemy (ras ̄ayana), butwhat is clearly at stake is an inner alchemy connected to the flow of the transfor-mative power of consciousness liberated by the practice of sam ̄ave ́sa. This passageilluminates the invasive absorption of nondual consciousness into the apparentlyseparate individuality of the practitioner. Just as the activated quicksilver trans-forms base metal into precious substance, so too the outward flowing form ofconsciousness overtakes the relative body-mind apparatus and works magicaltransformation upon it. This new status reflects itself not only in terms of atransformed vision of the Self and of the phenomenal universe, but also in theattainment of a divinized condition of physical embodiment. Here, the flowingform of Bhairava increasingly overwhelms the finite self with its limitless powerand brings about a progressively and increasingly effortless immersion (nimaj-jana), or reposing (vi ́sr ̄anti) in the abyss of the Heart of Bhairava."},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"221Becoming BhairavaAbhinavagupta tells us that the “great entanglement of the sport of exis-tence”38 arises as part of the astonishment experienced in the supreme conscious-ness, an astonishment, in this case, that there should be anything at all differentfrom the infinite Self. This great entanglement is filled up with Bhairava, with thedirectly experienced perception of the Self as the all-pervasive reality both inter-nally and externally. One of the terms that is often encountered in this regard is thenotion of appropriation (sv ̄ıkartavya). Abhinavagupta explains, “This cognition ofthe Heart must be appropriated, made one’s own, as a reality that is empty ofdifferences, whose nature is that it appears all at once, devoid of time.”39 By meansof this transformative appropriation of all things to Bhairava, the practitioner issaid to directly transform the field of experience from night into day. Describingthe culmination of this process, Abhinavagupta says:When the absorption into the Heart is maintained for four periods of forty-eight minutes, then the totality, whose nature is essentially light, attains thecondition of day, and the contraction of the night of m ̄ay ̄a is destroyed.Then the practitioner with this very body becomes omniscient likeBhairava.40The night of m ̄ay ̄a (illusion) is the contraction that has given rise to the greatentanglement of existence. This night is to be dispelled by the clarifying andexpansive absorption into the reality of the Heart of Bhairava that is essentiallylight. Activated by practice of the mantra, the gleaming light of the Heart seversthe knots of limitation and contraction to reveal the illuminating vision. Oncereleased, however, this light can in no way be held back: it is unconcealable andunbounded. As it continues to emanate from the inner reality of the Heart, itinvades the entire structure of finiteness, transforming its inertness and insen-tience into the vibrancy and liveliness of the absolute:This is the tetrad, the moon and its three parts, the Heart, which, beingpresent and being reposed in one’s own Heart whose form is a consciousnessof the self, must be projected within oneself in order to obtain an absorption(sam ̄ave ́sa) whose nature is that it appropriates the levels of mind, breath,and body. One should place the entire group (kula), consisting of the mind,breath, body and senses, so that its one essence is resting on that tetrad, withits inert character having been dissolved, whose principal part is the cogni-tion of the form of that tetrad. Because of the expansion of its light, one willarrive at a state where the kula becomes light. In this way the absorption ofthe tetrad of the emissional power in the levels of body, breath, and so onhas been shown.41The “moon and its three parts,” the tetrad, refer here to the knower, process ofknowing, and the known object all encompassed within the moon, the wholeness"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"222Paul E. Muller-Ortegaof consciousness. The kula becomes light, says Abhinavagupta. The opaque andlimiting structure of body, breath, and senses is invaded by the expanding light ofthe Heart. Animated and transformed by the quickening essence of consciousness(the new meaning of the sacrificial liquid offered to the Goddesses), the liberatedone becomes Bhairava incarnate in whom even the activities of the senses and thebody are radically awakened and divinized.Thus, in Abhinavagupta’s interpretation, sam ̄ave ́sa refers to the inner grasp-ing of the ́sakti which opens the s ̄adhaka to a state of identity with Bhairava. Byuniting with the Goddess, the s ̄adhaka is said to be “born of the Yogin ̄ıs Heart,”that is, to be reborn as Bhairava. Caught up in a series of macranthropic experi-ences, the s ̄adhaka truly comes to embody the cosmos. In such a state, the capacityto experience finite objects is not lost; instead, objects are now correctly perceivedas “luminous with the play that bestows the fragrance of the Self.”42 The astonish-ment of this experience involves discovery of Bhairava as the true inner identityand the bewildering perception that this nondifferentiated consciousness is simul-taneously at play as a luminosity inherent within all external objects. In this way,thej ̄ıvanmukta (liberated one) “moves in the Heart,” “moves in the void,” andexperiences all things as having their being within the omnipresent reality of theHeart of Bhairava. The awakened one is surrounded by Bhairava on all sides.What were formerly perceived and improperly evaluated as separate, finite objects(including the body, senses, and mind) have now revealed their true status asBhairava itself. Fulfilling the meaning of both bhukti (enjoyment) and mukti(liberation), the siddha (one with supranormal powers) dwells in this blissful stateof the englobing and all encompassing nondual consciousness.In the movement from the ̄ave ́sa s ̄adhana to the sam ̄ave ́sa s ̄adhana, thereoccurs an important revalorization of the place of ritual. The direct, meditativeabsorption in the Heart is said to fulfill the purpose of any ritual.43 Indeed, theentrance into the Heart constitutes initiation, even if the actual ritual of initiationhas not been performed.44 Moreover, as a result of the direct knowledge of theultimate reality of the Heart, the practitioner gains essential knowledge about allrituals, even if he does not know their specific rules.45 The practitioner who hasbeen born of the yogin ̄ı becomes automatically an expert in the rituals of allschools, not necessarily because he has come to know the ritual regulations of eachof the schools in detail, but rather because he comes to know the so-called Methodof the Ultimate (anuttara-vidhi).46 Says Abhinavagupta, “with respect to theUltimate, which is only consciousness, all other things are extraneous.”47These are curious statements that seem to indicate a movement in thedirection of the transcendence of the need for elaborate ritual. In this particularcontext, at least, the need for exacting and the complex ritual of the Hindu Tantraseems to be obviated.48 Nevertheless, in the PTlv itself an entire section of thecommentary is devoted to a description of ritual procedures (vidhi), includingsacrifice (y ̄aga, yajana), adoration (p ̄uj ̄a), and oblation (homa). In his comment onthis passage, Abhinavagupta concentrates almost exclusively on the notion of"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"223Becoming Bhairavaappropriation (sv ̄ıkara ̧na). For him, the significance of the ritual is that it involvesa process of reducing the external constituents of the ritual to a state of identitywith the ultimate reality of the Heart.But one may ask: how should he sacrifice properly? With the highest devo-tion, with reverence and with great faith, all of which grant him absorption.This great devotion consists in effecting the subordination of the finite levelsof the body, the vital breath and the subtle body. This subordination con-sists in accomplishing a state of humble devotion, whose nature is animmersion into the essence of that which results in the removal of thosefinite levels and the establishment of the superiority of the supreme con-sciousness, whose nature is the divinity which has been described and is tobe sacrificed to.49This passage resonates with the alchemical metaphor explored above. Tantricritual is here revealed as a mechanism for stimulating the production of theflowing form of consciousness that overtakes the finite levels and transforms theminto what they already in essence are—the supreme consciousness. In order toaccomplish this esoteric purpose of ritual, the Tantric hero (v ̄ıra) must havereceived already the initiatory ́saktip ̄ata that decontracts his consciousness.50 Ab-hinavagupta affirms that only when the contraction of the finite self (anu) hasceased is the v ̄ıra fully qualified to perform, in its truest sense, the ritual. Thus, in ageneral sense, these rituals serve the v ̄ıra as a stage extending his inner vision of theunity of all things within Bhairava-who-is-consciousness. It is precisely by appro-priating all things to the Heart that the vision of inner unity is extended outward.In these rituals, the v ̄ırafinds an arena for solidifying the unitive vision acquiredduring meditative absorption and for extending and expanding this inner vision ofunity to include all of the external constituents of the ritual. Ritual serves as acontext within which the v ̄ıra will eventually attain the advanced form of medita-tive realization known as the extrovertive sam ̄adhi (unm ̄ılana sam ̄adhi).As a result, in the Tantric s ̄adhana described by Abhinavagupta, the relation-ship of meditation and ritual seems to be one of symbiotic interdependence. Thesuccessful practice of one deepens and enhances the performance of the other.Synergistically feeding one upon the other, the two wings of external and internalTantric practice advance the v ̄ıra along the path of s ̄adhana. In so doing, ritual andmeditation converge, to merge one with the other, until the boundary between thetwo categories fades and the distinction between outer practices and inner attain-ments blurs.In the Tantr ̄aloka, Abhinavagupta describes a meditation using terms andimages drawn from a fire ritual. The two fire-sticks are rubbed together in order toinflame the sacred fire-pit of Bhairava. The meditation essentially consists invisualizing the entire universe reduced to the wheel of pure consciousness, andthen rehearsing the process by which the entire universe once again emerges.The"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"224Paul E.

Thelight, the freedom, whose essential nature is consciousness contains within itall principles, realities, things. This light abides in the Heart. It has beendescribed in this way in the Tr i ́siro-mata:The knower of truth sees that reality within the Heart is like a flower withinwhich are all external and internal things, a flower shaped like a plantainbloom. He should meditate with undistracted mind on the union there inthe Heart of the sun, moon, and fire. From this meditation, as from theagitation caused by two firesticks, one comes to experience the oblation fireof the great Bhairava which expands and flames violently in the great firepitknown as the Heart. Having arrived at the effulgence of Bhairava, which isthe possessor of the powers and full of the powers, one should contemplateits identity with the abode of the knowing subject, the means of knowledge,and the known object.51To achieve the condition of Bhairava, the siddha employs ritualized medita-tions and meditative rituals that serve as arenas for manifesting the state ofidentification with Bhairava. These practices become the context within which thesiddha exercises and tests the authenticity of the attainment of the powers ofmanifestation, maintenance, and reabsorbtion of the universe.Thus, Abhinavagupta describes the practice of a subtle two-phased absorp-tion that consists of a repeated alternation between a swallowing contraction of themanifested universe into the silent witnessing consciousness and the releasingexpansion of the universe once again from this void of consciousness. Describingthe essential structure of the Tantric s ̄adhana and the posture of the one whoabides in Bhairava, the bhairav ̄ımudr ̄a, Abhinavagupta says:In this way, the whole multitude of paths is effortlessly dissolved in the greatwheel of Bhairava which is contained in consciousness. Then—even whenall this has come to an end and all that is left are latent impressions—oneshould meditate on the great wheel which revolves and is the overflowing ofthe true Self. Because of the dissolution of all that could be burned, andbecause of the destruction of even the remaining latent impressions, thepractitioner should meditate on that wheel as becoming calm, then aspacified, then as tranquil quietude itself. By this method of meditation, theentire universe is dissolved in the wheel, in that consciousness. Conscious-ness then shines alone, free of objects. Then, because of the essential natureof consciousness, manifestation occurs once again. That consciousness is the"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"225Becoming Bhairavagreat Goddess. Continually causing the universe to become absorbed in hisown consciousness, and continually emitting it again, the practitionerwould become the perpetual Bhairava.52Thus, it is in the dialectical relationship between meditation and ritual, in therepeated alternation between the inner and outer practices, that the sam ̄ave ́sas ̄adhana moves toward its unifying goal.The Hindu Tantra generates and functions within numerous and powerfuloppositions: purity and impurity; popular and elite; high and low; inner andouter; form and formlessness; ritual and meditation; possession and yogic absorp-tion;dharma and adharma; covertly transgressive and overtly conformist; thepursuit of bhukti and mukti; the pursuit of k ̄ama and mok ̧sa; the states of order anddisorder; to name just a few. The condition of embodied divinity, the deified stateof the bhairav ̄ımudr ̄a seeks precisely to overcome these manifold oppositions.The one who experiences embodied enlightenment is said to dwell in theuniversal bliss (jagad ̄ananda) as she/he abides in the spiritual posture in whichconsciousness is both completely introverted and completely extroverted. Theposture describes the state one who achieves embodied enlightenment, the j ̄ıvan-mukta. It describes the tasting of the nectar of the bliss of Bhairava that isdiscovered by the j ̄ıvanmukta at the innermost depths and in the outermost limitsof sensory experience. Indeed, the bhairav ̄ımudr ̄a is important because it repre-sents the fullest possible stretch of awareness. In this condition, what the j ̄ıvan-mukta tastes in the innermost depths of consciousness is identical to that which isfound as the essence of all the sensory experiences of the so-called objective world.Using the methods of the Tantra, the practitioner finds a way to entice the divinepulsation of consciousness into revealing itself at all times, in all experiences, andunder all circumstances. Abhinavagupta ecstatically sings the praises of this state inthePTv:That in which everything shines and which shines everywhere, O awakenedones, is the one brilliant quivering gleam, the Supreme Heart. That which isthe abode of the origin of his own world, expanding and contracting at thesame time, he rejoices in his own Heart. He should worship the vibratingHeart which appears as cosmic manifestation; thus the Heart should beworshiped in the heart, in the su ̧sum ̧na passage where one will encounter thegreat bliss of the pair of ́Siva and ́S ̄akti.53Like the serpent wound around the li ̧nga, the spiraling embrace of consciousnesswith itself, always first implodes centripetally into the dark star, the great void atthe Heart of all things. Here nothing that is not infinity itself can gain a foothold.Here all limitations and identifying characteristics of individuality are be-wilderingly and fiercely stripped away. Who dares to enter into this abyss—theabode of the deepest embrace of Bhairava and of the ́Sakti—must truly be a"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"226Paul E. Muller-Ortegarenunciate, must have courageously abandoned all things to a sacrificial yieldinginto the all-consuming fire of Bhairava.Yet the Heart is also the illuminating, perpetual supernova always joyfullyexploding outward. At the highest level, it does so through the all-encompassingand illuminating vibration of the supreme mantra of consciousness, the great O ̧M,which is also the great mantra AHA ̧M. In this primordial cry, Bhairava- ́Sivaperpetually announces the realization of recognition “I am ́Siva” or a “It is ́Sivathat is the great I AM, the great ‘I’ consciousness of reality” ( ́Sivo’ham). This greatmantra then fractures itself in the three successive levels of speech, reducing andcongealing the hyperfluidity of the vibrating light as it approaches ever closer tohuman knowabilty. The interplay of the titanic forces that perpetually dwell at theHeart of things is the true domain of this early Hindu Tantra. The perennialintent of the Tantric practitioner is the fascinated emulation of this great play ofBhairava and the Goddess.ThePT invites the practitioner to discover the continuous occurrence ofthis play at the intimate core of life. It prescribes the methods by which thes ̄adhaka comes to embody the paradoxical totality of these unimpeded forceswithin a transformed human life. The text is thought to arise as part of the play,the great dialogue, the blissful intercourse of this divine pair. Bhairava, the hor-rific, skull-bearing god, sweetly instructs the Great Mother of the Universe in themany and utterly secret (atirahasya) methods of the Hindu Tantra. These methodsallow the practitioner to validate experientially the otherwise theoretical teachingof the omnipresence of Bhairava.It is by these developments that this early Hindu Tantra rejects the dry vistasof traditional philosophical debate that seek only the representation of the Ulti-mate through conceptual truths. It rejects also the renunciation of traditionalIndian monasticism, which protectively seeks to isolate the monk from the stain ofworldliness. Transcending the dualities of conventional thought and morality, theTantra demonstrates an outward gesture of embracing delight in all of reality. TheTantric hero pushes outward into spiritual exploration, into savoring the experi-ence of so many varieties of the blissful ekarasa, the unitary taste of consciousness.In this way, the Tantric hero delights in all, even the suffering of the ordinaryworld. In this way she/he becomes the great dancer, the one who in all experiencesand at all times relishes the nectar, the taste of the ́sivan ̄andarasa. Says Ab-hinavagupta, describing the experience of Bhairava:That in which there is no division or limitation, for it flashes forth all round;in which the consciousness is intact—in which consciousness alone ex-presses itself, whether as knower, means of knowledge, or as known; thatwhich increases and expands by the nectar of divine joy, of absolute sov-ereignty in which there is no need for imagination or meditation. ́Sambhutold me that is the universal bliss, jagad ̄ananda.54"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"227Becoming BhairavaT 1 ́sloka 9 O beautiful One, the Heart of the Self of Bhairava is the third brahman.

In this paper, I discuss the Dev ̄ıPur ̄a ̧na and particularly its use of the Padam ̄al ̄a Mantra Vidy ̄a, a Tantric mantravidy ̄a (incantation of mystical knowledge) that is central to the V ̄am ̄ac ̄ara ́S ̄aktaTantra tradition. Although the Padam ̄al ̄a Mantra Vidy ̄a seems to be one of thelater interpolations added to the core text of the Dev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧na, it nonethelessinstructs us in our search for the roots of Tantra. The Dev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧na1 is an ancientand authenticated text belonging to the body of work called the Upapur ̄a ̧nas. Therenowned scholar R. C. Hazra notes that the Dev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧na is not mentioned in theeighteen Mah ̄apur ̄a ̧nas; however, the Ek ̄ amra Pur ̄a ̧na includes it as one of theeighteen Upapur ̄a ̧nas.2 Raghunandan in his Malam ̄asatattva also identified theDev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧na as one of the eighteen Upapur ̄a ̧nas.3 The text offers discussions on awide range of subjects including cosmography, astronomy, astrology, divination,and medicine, to name a few. It also furnishes information about the differentincarnations of the Dev ̄ı, her original or essential nature, her various manifesta-tions, her functions and activities, her connections with ́Siva and other deities.Dev ̄ı is, however, the primary focus of the text along with the sixty-four vidy ̄as(types of knowledge) that she confers on devotees. While references to Dev ̄ı or ́Sakti abound in the Mah ̄apur ̄a ̧nas and Upapur ̄a ̧nas, in no other text is the su-premacy of the Dev ̄ı so firmly established as it is in the Dev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧na. The work wascomposed specifically in the V ̄am ̄ac ̄ara ́S ̄akta tradition because it focuses on theworship of Dev ̄ı in her most terrifying forms as K ̄al ̄ı, Durg ̄a, C ̄amu ̧n ̧da, et al.V ̄am ̄ac ̄ara ́S ̄akta rituals follow sacred codified texts that contain secret Tantric rites.The other branch of ́S ̄aktas, the Dak ̧si ̧n ̄ac ̄aras, worship the tranquil goddessesSarasvat ̄ı, Lak ̧sm ̄ı, and a pacified form of Durg ̄a.Most of the ́S ̄akta Pur ̄a ̧nas are believed to have been written in the south-eastern part of Bengal and Assam, particularly in Kamarupa and Kamakhya. TheDev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧na contains a large number of Bengali words and grammatical pecu-liarities of the Bengali language; for this reason, Bengal seems likely as the place oforigin. The text, however, is a compilation of work by many people of various"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"232Lina Guptaperiods and possibly from other regions. Its various compilers seem to have beenfamiliar with different parts of India, e.g., Kamarupa, Kashmir, Simhala, etc.Despite the difficulties presented to the reader of this text, one recognizesthe significance of the work for worshiping the goddess. Although considered anUpapur ̄a ̧na, it, nonetheless, is recognized as an important text for the correctperformance of many Vedic rituals as well as Tantric ceremonies. The authority ofthe text was confirmed by writers such as ́Sa ̇ nkar ̄ac ̄arya (seventh century ..) andthe astronomer Bh ̄askarac ̄arya (tenth century ..), who consulted the Dev ̄ıPur ̄a ̧na on various matters. Vall ̄alasena, in his D ̄anas ̄agara (twelfth century ..),commented on the influence of the Dev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧na’s Tantric injunctions on Hindureligion as did the Sm ̄arta Raghunandan, a devotee of Lord Gaur ̄a ̧nga, in thefifteenth century .. Most important, the Dev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧na is recognized for itscontributions to the ritual worship of Durg ̄a;4 it is used for the most importantpart of Durg ̄a P ̄uj ̄a, the ritual that is performed on the the penultimate night of theNava R ̄atri celebration.Worship of the goddess is not unique to the Dev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧na. Certainly, Vedictexts mentioned the names of several goddesses and referred to their powers; butthe central deity of the Dev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧na is not like the seemingly benign goddesses ofthe Vedas. In contrast, she is a fierce and dangerous divinity who fights anddestroys her enemies. She is also, unlike the Vedic goddesses, viewed as thesupreme universal power or ́Sakti; she is second to none.The Goddess of the Dev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧na clearly exhibits two distinct origins: she isboth non-Vedic and Vedic. Her non-Vedic character is evinced by the location ofher home in the Vindhya Mountains, an area where the Pulindas, ́Savaras, Kir ̄atas,Varvaras, and K ̄ap ̄alins, aboriginal and immigrant tribes who lived on roots anddressed in bark, made human sacrifices to female deities.5 It is the fiercesome tribalaspect of the Dev ̄ı that is central in the Dev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧na and that became prevalent inIndia’s classical period. Classical references to her aboriginal origins abound in thelyrical compositions of many famous poets and writers. For example, K ̄alid ̄asa inhisKum ̄arasambhava and Raghuva ̇m ́sa writes of the frightening Saptam ̄at ̧rk ̄ as andC ̄amu ̧n ̧da. B ̄a ̧nabha ̧t ̧ta in his Har ̧sacarita informs us that as Durg ̄a she is wor-shiped in a forest temple under the control of a Dravidian hermit and, in hisK ̄adambar ̄ı, he tells of the goddess of the ́Savaras as one who is worshiped withhuman sacrifice. Da ̧n ̧din in his Da ́sakum ̄aracarita speaks of the Goddess Ca ̧n ̧dikawho is worshiped in a temple where the hunters ( ́Savaras) sacrifice boys in order togain sorceric powers. Subandhu writes of the bloodthirsty K ̄aty ̄ayan ̄ı in his V ̄as-avadatta Dev ̄ı. In the Kath ̄asarits ̄agara, Somadeva tells the story of J ̄ım ̄utav ̄ahanawho was captured by thugs who then took him to a ́Savara village in order tosacrifice him to Durg ̄a.When was the Dev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧na written? It is difficult to determine the exactdate of the text; but, from the internal evidence, it may be said that the book post-dated the early Buddhist period because the text identifies Buddha as one of theten incarnations of Vi ̧s ̧nu and refers to the Jainas as a heretical sect. Var ̄ahamihira"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"233Tantric Incantation in the Dev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧naof sixth century .. cited the contents of the Dev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧na in his B ̧rhatsa ̇mhita;thus, we can postulate that the main body of the text must have been formulatedafter the sixth century ... and before the sixth century ..The question is, when did the initial compilation of the materials in theDev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧na begin? In the seventy-third chapter, the Dev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧na employs twowords, hor ̄a and drekk ̄a ̧na, in relation to a discussion on the hours and days. TheP ̄ar ̄ a ́sar ̄a Hor ̄a which was written between the twelfth and tenth centuries ...discusses the same two words, as does Var ̄ahamihira, centuries later, in theB ̧rhatsa ̇mhit ̄a. In addition, the Dev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧na refers to various other customs, ritesand practices that were neither prevalent in Pur ̄a ̧nic times nor acknowledged inother Pur ̄a ̧nas. In other words, the textual evidence contains antique words andrefers to customs that had been abandoned by the time of writing the otherPur ̄a ̧nas. Thus, the evidence suggests that the core of the Dev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧na was writtenbefore the compilation of the other Pur ̄a ̧nas.In the first chapter, the Dev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧na refers to itself as being “Ve d ̄anta-tattva-sahit ̄a;”6 a phrase claiming that the text contains the Vedic truth and the essentialmeaning of the Vedas. In addition, Vedic influence is obvious in its injunctions,Ny ̄asa, mudr ̄a,7mantra, homa, and ku ̧n ̧das.8 In particular, the Padam ̄al ̄a MantraVidy ̄a incantation is referred to as “Vedasiddh ̄antakarma Pratip ̄adan ̄ı,” that is, itconforms to the injunctions of Vedic laws and principles.9 Such characterizationsassert attempts at synchronized realizations of the Brahman, the Ultimate Reality,in the form of the Goddess.Throughout the text and integrated with the Vedic elements are irrefutableTantric components such as particular rites, customs, oblations, invocations, in-cantations, utterance of mystic syllables, and applications of sorcery. Some of therites may have originated in part in the Vedic-Br ̄ahma ̧nic tradition. It seemsobvious that the Dev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧na relied on the Vedas to a certain extent, yet gravitatedtoward Tantrism as a way to assert power by way of magical ritualistic acts.According to the Dev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧na, performance of the vidy ̄as bestows magical powerssuch as the Tantric eight powers (a ̧s ̧ta siddhi) on the s ̄adhaka.10It is possible to postulate a tentative framework for the origination of thetext; germination possibly was based on the religious practices of the pre-Vedicaboriginal tribes, both indigenous and immigrant. Dev ̄ı worship as found in thefirst three Vedas might have inspired redaction of an early section of the Dev ̄ıPur ̄a ̧na sometime in the first few centuries ... through which the aboriginalmaterial was reinterpreted. Subsequently, various topics from the Atharva Vedawere integrated into the work; in fact, the Dev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧na recognizes the AtharvaVeda as authoritative and as its guiding source.11 Various interpolations andadditions augmented the text during the next few centuries as Tantrism spread andwas sanctioned throughout India. The final redaction of the Dev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧na, whichby this time was encyclopedic in scope, must have occurred about the time ofVa r ̄ahamihira’sB ̧rhatsa ̇mhit ̄a in the sixth century ..TheDev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧na speaks of sixty-five types of vidy ̄a, the most important"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"234Lina Guptabeing the K ̄amik ̄a, Padam ̄al ̄a, Apar ̄ajit ̄a, Mohin ̄ı, M ̧rtyu ̃njaya, Pu ̧spaka, Kha ̧dga,M ̄ala, A ̇ngana, and Gu ̧tika. Any one of these vidy ̄as, when successfully performedand practiced, can confer magical powers on the s ̄adhaka and bring liberation fromearthly bondage. Here, we will focus only on the Padam ̄al ̄a Mantra Vidy ̄a, whichalso is known by various other names in the Dev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧na (Atibhairava Padam ̄al ̄a,12Bhairava Vidy ̄a,13Padam ̄al ̄a Mah ̄a Vidy ̄a,14Padam ̄al ̄a,15Mantram ̄al ̄a or Man-trapada,16Naravimohine Vidy ̄a and C ̄amu ̧n ̧da Padam ̄aline Mah ̄a Vidy ̄a17).Here we are concerned particularly with the Padam ̄al ̄a Mantra Vidy ̄a,18 amagical spell used by ́Siva to invoke the Dev ̄ı so that she might engage in thelegendary destruction of the demon Ghora. The text relates that the incantation isAtharvavedic in origin and that it was revealed in ten hundred thousand verses toVi ̧s ̧nu by ́Siva. It eventually was transmitted to the sage Agastya who narrated thestory of its divine origin to King N ̧rpav ̄ahana.19 The Padam ̄al ̄a Mantra Vidy ̄aconsists of thirty-two mantras that are used to invoke the presiding deity C ̄amu ̧n ̧d ̄aand to obtain the s ̄adhaka’s goals. Because the exceedingly powerful thirty-twogerm-syllables (b ̄ıja mantras) have been deliberately excluded by the editor, onlyexplanations of the purposes and effects of performing each incantation are pro-vided.20 They are as follows:1.

The thirty-second mantra bestows power on the s ̄adhaka to purge alltypes of fevers (sarvajvar ̄ave ́sakaranam).These are the merits of the Padam ̄al ̄a Mantra Vidy ̄a provided they areuttered according to the directions specified in the Dev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧na. Sitting in thecremation ground, wearing a black garment and a black garland, a s ̄adhaka repeatseach one of the thirty-two mantras eight thousand times while performing properoblations and other ritual requirements. As a result, he/she is able to create aunique verbal charm or spell to produce the desired effects.In addition to the thirty-two specific achievements of the PamadamalaMantra Vidy ̄a, the Dev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧na mentions an additional one hundred eight goalsattainable through chanting the powerful incantation. For example, the sin ofBrahmanicide can be nullified by a single utterance of the incantation and,whether chanting or listening to the mantras, one is assured of receiving meritequivalent to a bath in the holy river or equal to the performance of all rituals.21 Infact, all ailments and harmful situations are remedied by the Padam ̄al ̄a MantraVidy ̄a when uttered with utmost devotion and according to prescription.TheDev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧na tells us that the vidy ̄a is not limited to any particular groupof people, but the text cautions that agnostics or those without reverence for theDev ̄ı and, most important, those who lack control over the senses should not begiven this incantation.22 The text emphasizes that this vidy ̄a is the Mah ̄avidy ̄a, theSupreme Knowledge, the sum and substance of all mantras and Tantras; as such itempowers material and spiritual success, that is, bhukti and mukti. Each part of themantra is uniquely and individually powerful. When parts of the mantra arechanted separately, a s ̄adhaka is rewarded with a specific earthly goals (bhukti);when rendered in full, the Padam ̄al ̄a Mantra Vidy ̄a leads to mukti. To understandthe connection between the individual and combined effects of the mantra, it isnecessary to recognize that, with completion of each section, the reciter changesinternally as well as externally. With each attainment of a material nature, causedby uttering one section of the Padam ̄al ̄a Mantra Vidy ̄a, one gains added insightinto one’s own being and the nature of reality. The unified power of the thirty-twomantras surpasses the limited power of the individual mantra and liberates theaspirant from all ignorance. The significance of the full mantra becomes clearer asone understands the importance of sound within the Tantric paradigm in whichthe human body is a microcosm of the material universal macrocosm; both areproduced by the power of the original sound called n ̄ada, which eternally perme-ates and pulsates throughout the cosmos. The ultimate goal of human life, accord-ing to Tantrism, is to internalize the cosmos and unify the inner vibrations withthe outer. That is, to be self-realized is to internalize one’s own being by traveling"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"237Tantric Incantation in the Dev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧naback to the original sound; thus, emphasis is placed upon sound and the efficacy ofmantra. When macrocosm and microcosm become one through repetitions ofmantras or intensified thought in the form of sound, the adept becomesempowered.One can better understand the nature and origin of the Padam ̄al ̄a MantraVidy ̄a by recognizing the resemblance of some of the mantras to certain rites andpractices addressed in Vedic literature. Two hymns of the ̧Rg Veda describe a ritethat is efficacious in getting rid of a co-wife or controlling a husband.23 Otherreferences in the ̧Rg Veda pertain to healing24 and destruction.25 Both the Tait-tir ̄ ıya Sa ̇mhit ̄a26 and Taittir ̄ıya Br ̄ahma ̧na27 refer to practices to win someone’s loveor favor. Without doubt, the precursors of many later Tantric incantations andspells can be found in the Vr ̄atya Book of Atharva Veda.28 In this chapter, myste-rious hymns praise Brahman as the heavenly Vr ̄atya who is none other than thegreat God (Mah ̄adeva) Rudra ( ̄I ́sana); the heavenly Vr ̄atya is the macrocosmiccounterpart of the microcosmic earthly Vr ̄atyas, who belonged to certain aborigi-nal tribes. The special cult of the Vr ̄atyas29 practiced mystical spells, incantations,prayers, sorcery, and necromantic practices.30 Possibly in the eighth century..., the Atharvavedic A ̇ngirasa were involved in practices that in a later timewould be called Tantric. In the fifth century ..., the Buddha encounteredAtharvavedic Brahmins engrossed in spells, charms, and rituals; he called themAtharvanikas because of their preoccupation with sorcery.31 By the time of Em-peror A ́soka, cross-cultural relationships and contacts had greatly expanded andthe Atharvavedic cult was enriched by the further contributions from the Vr ̄atyasand indigenous tribes and influences from immigrant Hu ̧n ̄as, P ̄a ̧sa ̧n ̧dins andothers.While we need to exercise caution in postulating direct influences, there aresimilarities among the specified functions of Padam ̄al ̄a Mantra Vidy ̄a and certainVedic mantras. However, the Dev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧na specifies that the Padam ̄al ̄a MantraVidy ̄a is “Atharvavedokta,”32 meaning that it conforms to injunctions in theAtharva Veda or enables one to perform a significant number of rituals prescribedin the text.33 Many of the mantras of the Padam ̄al ̄a Mantra Vidy ̄a closely resemblepassages from the Atharva Veda Sa ̇mhit ̄a. Specific correspondences are as follows:Padam ̄al ̄a Mantra Vidy ̄aAtharva VedaVerse 2 V, 20–21 4III, 1–6 11III, 1–6; V, 20, 21 14III, 25 20VII, 4 32VI, 9; XXIX, 5While certain passages from the Atharva Veda may have inspired somesections of the Padam ̄al ̄a Mantra Vidy ̄a, there can be no doubt that the mantras are"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"238Lina Guptacredited with the type of inordinate potency that is attributable only to Tantrism.TheDev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧na asserts that the Padam ̄al ̄a Mantra Vidy ̄a is a mah ̄avidy ̄a thatguarantees success in all actions. Its power is singular because it contains theessence of all the texts and scriptures disclosed by ́Siva in the m ̄ulatantra (root ofTantra).34 It seems likely that many of the thirty-two separate mantras of thePadam ̄al ̄a Mantra Vidy ̄a have been influenced by Vedic texts and mantras, particu-larly the Atharva Veda; but, as noted above, the Padam ̄al ̄a Mantra Vidy ̄a alsocontains non-Vedic elements.Two words used in the Padam ̄al ̄a Mantra Vidy ̄a paticularly clarify the con-nection between Tantric mantras and rituals as well as illuminate the antiquity ofsome Tantric practices; they are kapal ̄amathana and mady ̄akar ̧sa ̧na. Kap ̄a-lamathana is a compound of two words kap ̄ala (skull) and mathana (churning).Thekap ̄ala or skull cup is an essential implement for Tantric ritual. An explana-tion of its importance is provided in the fifthskandha of the Dev ̄ı BhagavataPur ̄a ̧na wherein ́Siva, having become angry with Brahm ̄a for telling a lie, cuts offhis head. Part of his penance for the sin of Brahm ̄anicide required that ́Siva useBrahm ̄a’s skull (kapala) for alms. Reenacting the myth, the K ̄ap ̄alikas and thefollowers of V ̄am ̄ac ̄ara ́S ̄akta Tantra schools use a skull cup for alms. The samemyth also informs us that ́Siva is the origin of the Tantrism.35 Later K ̄ap ̄alikas andV ̄am ̄ac ̄aras practiced sitting in a cremation ground and using wine-filled skulls foroblations. Drinking the spiritual wine (k ̄ara ̧na-v ̄ari), it was believed, destroyedearthly bondage (m ̄ay ̄a) and the eight hindrances (a ̧s ̧tap ̄a ́sa) to liberation. Thehistorical Buddha noted Atharvavedic Brahmins who where engrossed in ritualsutilizing skulls (cavasisa manta)36 and, particularly, those who predicted the futureby tapping on skulls (kap ̄ala kotani).37 He specifically referred to a contemporaryAtharvavedic Brahmin, a possible native of Bengal named Va ̇ngisa, who was adeptat skull tapping.38 Such references leave little doubt that the ritual use of skulls wasknown in both the Atharva Veda and in the Tantric tradition. The skull-tappingritual was a practice particularly prevalent in Bengal and upper Assam, the regionwhere most of the V ̄am ̄ac ̄ara texts have been found.The word mady ̄akar ̧sa ̧na is the compound of madya (wine) and ̄akar ̧sa ̧na (toattract). These two compound words explain the ritual acts that correspond to thetwelfth incantation. In order to receive the Dev ̄ı’s blessing, the aspirant must offerher a skull filled with wine. Churning the wine in the skull combined withrepeated utterance transforms the ordinary physical wine into spiritual liquor, anoblation suitable for the Dev ̄ı. Like the nectar of the gods, this spiritual liquorbecomes a source of immortality for the s ̄adhaka. After offering the wine to theGoddess, the aspirant drinks it, and thereby is able to transcend the tamasic to thesattvic state and remain in an eternally blissful condition.39 The Kul ̄arnava Tantrainforms us that this ritual awakens the serpent power (kulaku ̧n ̧dalin ̄ı) that remainsdormant in the pelvic center (m ̄ul ̄adh ̄ara cakra).40 The awakened power rises upthe spinal cord, piercing the remaining cakras of the spinal cord including the finalbrahmarandhra cakra that is controlled by the pineal gland (candra granthi). Once"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"239Tantric Incantation in the Dev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧nathe serpent power reaches this cakra, a secretion called am ̧rta (nectar) is released.The nectar then flows from the brain to the aspirant’s tongue and, once imbibed,thes ̄adhaka is absorbed in ecstasy ( ̄anandasudh ̄ap ̄anarato nara ̧h).The wine in the skull cup has a vital role in Tantric ritual because it helpsstimulate the experience of Ku ̧n ̧dalin ̄ı. Once important in early Vedic ritual, theuse of wine was abandoned at a later time and, thus, was absent from all Hinduritual with the exception of the V ̄am ̄ac ̄ara ́S ̄akta practices. For the V ̄am ̄ac ̄ara ́S ̄aktas, wine was one of the five necessary ritual ingredients (pa ̃ncatattva or pa ̃n-camak ̄ara). In Tantra, madya is a mah ̄ad ̄ana or a great gift that generates the stateof ́Siva, the equivalent of mok ̧sa. Madya symbolically removes a ̧s ̧tap ̄a ́sa, the eightafflictions of bondage, and opens the path to liberation. By imbibing ritual wine,one symbolically consumes the entire universe, an expression not to be takenliterally, but one that is a metaphor for becoming so spiritually extended that theentire universe can be contained within the self.41 Also, madya is described sym-bolically as the nectar essence of the union of ́Siva- ́Sakti flowing into the highestcerebral region.42In each of the thirty-two different mantras of the Padam ̄al ̄a Mantra Vidy ̄a,Dev ̄ı is addressed by a different name.43 Each indicates the way in which she isperceived by her devotees when performing the concomitant rituals. The namesrefer to Dev ̄ı’s appearance and identities when she destroys the demons. Altogetherthe thirty-two names portray the presiding deity C ̄amu ̧n ̧da as she embodies theessence of Padam ̄al ̄a Mantra Vidy ̄a or vice versa.

In the thirty-second mantra, Dev ̄ı is addressed as Rak ̧t ̄ak ̧si P ̄ur ̧namay ̄aor one who has blood shot eyes.Whether used separately or together, these thirty-two epithets depict a fierceand abhorrent vision of the goddess, she who is the presiding deity of the Pada-m ̄al ̄ a Mantra Vidy ̄a. According to the description of her physical features, she is asbeautiful as lightning (and possibly as swift and unpredictable) and, at the sametime, hideous and frightening like an owl with a sunken face, a profile suitable toher wrathful countenance on the battlefield. Her complexion is tawny or black;she has squinting bloodshot eyes, a broken nose, pendulous lips, a lolling restlesstongue, and dreadful teeth, features attributable to the goddess C ̄amu ̧n ̧da. Theshining sharp teeth are indicative of her aggressive and dangerous nature. Her hairis either matted or spiked and is decorated with a crescent moon, an attribute thatconnects her with ́Siva. Her adornments enhance her violent image, that is, agarland of skulls and a snake. Her methods of transportation are appropriate forher fearsome role: she is mounted on ghosts and moves about on some sort offlying conveyance. Her violent nature is characterized by a bellowing voice androaring laughter. She is prepared for the ultimate battle against demons and thus isarrayed with a full range of frightful characteristics. War is horrifying and herappearance merely mirrors the situation; it is meant to instill fear in her opponent.Suitably paralyzed from horror, her opponent loses the battle.With the hu ̇m of theb ̄ıja mantra, she energizes herself for war. Normally beautiful when she grantsboons to adepts, the exigencies of war require that she takes on an abhorrentappearance.Three of Dev ̄ı’s names given in the Padam ̄al ̄a Mantra Vidy ̄a are particularlyevocative, that is, K ̄alar ̄atri, Kha ̧tv ̄ a ̇nga, and Kap ̄alahaste. In the sixth incantation,she is K ̄alar ̄atri, an epithet used to indicate her awful appearance and terrifyingdisposition. The first part of the word, k ̄ala, is a masculine noun denoting time.Time, as perceived by Vedic seers, is where everything takes place; in fact, it is theframework in which all of creation unfolds. Vedic seers conceived of k ̄ala as being apowerful deity; the deified K ̄ala was the creator and sustainer of the universe.44Everything that is created and preserved also must be destroyed by and in time;thus the Vedic image of K ̄ala as the devourer of all things is significant and wassyncretized with Rudra, the Vedic god of destruction.45 Ultimately K ̄ala becameMah ̄ak ̄ ala and Rudra became ́Siva and the two were fused in the Pur ̄a ̧nic andTantra literature.46 According to the Mah ̄anirv ̄a ̧na Tantra, during the dissolution"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"242Lina Guptaof the universe, K ̄ala or Mah ̄ak ̄ala devours the entire universe, but the supremegoddess who is the spouse of Mah ̄ak ̄ala or ́Siva even engulfs K ̄ala and hence isknown as K ̄al ̄ı.In the Dev ̄ı M ̄ah ̄atmyam,47 K ̄al ̄ ı is called C ̄amu ̧n ̧da, the goddess of thePadam ̄al ̄a Mantra Vidy ̄a, the terrifying deity associated with the ultimate dissolu-tion and destruction of the demon Ghora. The word is a feminine noun referringto the darkness after sunset. According to the R ̄atris ̄ukta of the ̧Rg Veda,48 the sageKu ́sika while absorbed in meditation realized the enveloping power of darknessand invoked R ̄atri as the all-powerful goddess. Thus, the darkness after sunset wasdeified and was invoked by sages to deliver mortals from all fears and earthlybondage. Later she was identified with various goddesses; in the Atharva Veda,R ̄atridev ̄ı is called ́Siva or Durg ̄a, the consort of ́Siva.49 In the B ̧rhad Devat ̄a,V ̄agdev ̄ı was identified with Sarasvat ̄ı;50 but, elsewhere the name R ̄atri identifiedSarasvat ̄ı, goddess of knowledge and wisdom who delivers the ignorant frombondage.51 In the Pur ̄a ̧nas, K ̄alar ̄atri signifies Raudr ̄ı, the goddess who kills thedemon Ruru and K ̄al ̄ı-C ̄amu ̧n ̧da who kills the demons Ca ̧n ̧da and Mu ̧n ̧da.52R ̄atr ̄ı, then, was the agent of destruction and eliminator of oppressive forces andignorance.Addressing the Dev ̄ı as K ̄alar ̄atri in the Padam ̄al ̄a Mantra Vidy ̄a serves twopurposes: (1) to invoke the appropriate deity for the task at hand; and (2) toempower the s ̄adhaka with the devouring quality of K ̄ala and the all-consumingquality of R ̄atri. Thus, the presiding deity of the mantra will eliminate all obstaclesand grant success to the devotee. In addition, the word k ̄alar ̄atri in Tantra refers tothe darkness of night, a state normally frightening to ordinary individuals butbeneficial to worshipers of the Supreme Goddess. Here the word K ̄alar ̄atri doesnot refer to the entire night but rather to different hours of darkness. Each time ofnight, according to Tantric tradition, is under the sway of a particular terrifyinggoddess who grants a particular desire to the aspirant.53 When K ̄alar ̄atri is invokedin the sixth mantra of the Padam ̄al ̄a ritual, the s ̄adhaka seeks the power to vanishand reappear at will, an ability that removes one of the eight afflictions calleda ̧s ̧tap ̄a ́sa in Tantra.Similarly, Dev ̄ı’s names in the third mantra of the Padam ̄al ̄a Mantra Vidy ̄a,Kha ̧tv ̄ a ̇nga and Kap ̄alahaste, grant the power to cut through the spells inflicted byothers. The ramifications of these two names can be understood in light of a mythnarrated in the Ram ̄ay ̄a ̧na in which Dev ̄ı appeared as Rakte ́svar ̄ı, a wrathful formof the Supreme Goddess, to destroy the demon V ̄ırasena in response to the prayersof King Dilipa (also called Kha ̧tv ̄ a ̇nga). Having killed the demon, Dev ̄ı drank hisblood from his severed head.54 While the word kha ̧tv ̄ a ̇nga ordinarily refers to theleg of a bed, in Hindu myth it also signifies a skull attached to a rib bone; as such itis a menacing, deadly weapon. In a story from the Ram ̄ay ̄a ̧na, it was used as analternate name for King Dilipa and possibly it referred to one of his accoutrementsof war. The V ̄ama ̧na Pur ̄a ̧na relates that K ̄al ̄ı, dressed in a tiger skin and adornedwith a garland of human skulls, holds a khatv ̄a ̇nga.55 The khatv ̄a ̇nga appears in"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"243Tantric Incantation in the Dev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧namyths in which K ̄al ̄ı is called upon to save humans from a peril that only she caneliminate.Likewise, Kap ̄alahaste, the third name of interest here, refers to one whoholds a kap ̄ala or skull. In this invocation, C ̄amu ̧n ̧da is identified with the deityRakte ́svar ̄ı of the Ram ̄ay ̄a ̧na. In the Dev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧na, ́Siva intones the Padam ̄al ̄aMantra Vidy ̄a so that the Goddess will come forth to destroy the virtually invul-nerable demon Ghora. Addressing her as Kap ̄alahaste and Kha ̧tv ̄ a ̇nga, he callsforth her deadliest form. Ontologically the s ̄adhaka, by ritually uttering the twonames, also evokes Dev ̄ı’s most powerful aspect, that which obliterates obstacles tothe attainment of bhukti and mukti.According to the Dev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧na, mere recitation of the mantras is ineffectualwithout performing the proper ritual (siddhis ̄adhana) with its regulations andrestrictions (bidhi), repeated muttering (japa), loud chanting (k ̄ırtana), and silentutterance of the mystical germ-syllables (b ̄ıja mantra). The thirty-two mantras areperformed along with special invocations and concentration on the particulardeity at a specified time and at a particular location. Specifically, Dev ̄ı worshipmust occur on the fourth (caturth ̄ı), fifth (pa ̃ncam ̄ı), eighth (a ̧s ̧tami), ninth(navam ̄ı), eleventh (ek ̄ada ́s ̄ı) days of the full moon and full moon days. Ritualsperformed on the eighth, (called Mah ̄a ̧s ̧tam ̄ı) and the ninth (called Mah ̄anavam ̄ı)days of the full moon are particularly efficacious. Their designation as mah ̄a,meaning great, indicates their status as the holiest times for worship. In additionand as prescribed by the Dev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧na, the Goddess is worshiped on the first day(pratipada tithi) of the month of ̄A ́svina (sixth month of the Hindu calendar) fornine days, in the month of Caitra (March 14 to April 13) and, on the ninth day ofthe lunar fortnight, various animals are sacrificed and devotees offer their ownblood for attainment of specific goals. Sacrifices of flesh and blood also should bemade on the ninth day of lunar fortnight of Jyai ̧s ̧tha (16 May to15 June). Dev ̄ıC ̄amu ̧n ̧da is not worshiped at the home altar or even in a temple; rather worship isperformed in a cemetery or a cremation ground. As is typical in Tantrism, theritual performance of the Padam ̄al ̄a Mantra Vidy ̄a exhibits a distinct structure thatcan be grouped into the following categories: (1) the prerequisites, (2) the prepara-tion, (3) the procedure, and (4) the performance. The very specific and controlledritual is as dynamic as it is complex; its delineation in the Dev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧na offersunique insight into the heart of the Tantric tradition.Proper initiation (d ̄ık ̧s ̄a) by a competent guru is the primary and inviolablerequirement for performance of the Padam ̄al ̄a Mantra Vidy ̄a; its success, in fact, iscontingent on an initiation. Tantric scriptures designate that a ́si ̧sya (aspirant),before performing rituals, must undergo initiation. ́S ̄akta teachings, in particular,are transmitted directly from guru to disciple because secret knowledge may beheard, deciphered, and retained only by the competent and dedicated.According to ́S ̄akta tradition, no ritual can be performed without the b ̄ıjamantra. Because b ̄ıja mantras are never written or disclosed in public, they canonly be learned directly from a guru. Conforming to this tradition, no edition of"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"244Lina GuptatheDev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧na provides the b ̄ıja mantras for any one of the sixty-five vidy ̄asdiscussed in the text. Such potent secret information can be revealed only to onewho has been properly prepared. The Rudray ̄amala clarifies the significance ofinitiation; in a conversation between ́Siva and the Goddess, ́Siva explains that anuninitiated aspirant neither achieves success (siddhi) in Tantra performances norliberation.56 The Dev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧na asserts that, without proper d ̄ık ̧s ̄a, all efforts arefutile and, unless both the guru and initiate are competent, all mantras are fruit-less.57 Furthermore, both the guru and ́si ̧sya are cautioned about their mutualselection of each other. The guru must have full mastery, that is, have the ability toadvise on various types of vidy ̄as, a judicious temperament, and most important,the capacity to remove the disciple’s doubts. The Kul ̄ar ̧nava Tantra adds that acompetentguru is one who is actively involved in the unbroken tradition ofTantra, that is, that which originated with ́Siva and has been handed down fromgeneration to generation; it also affirms that a competent guru is well versed in themantras and is one who guards the traditional doctrine.58 Because the guru issuccessor to the divinely originated knowledge, the disciple regards the guru not asan ordinary human, but as a deity. If the guru is a male, he is worshiped as ́Siva; iffemale, she is adored as ́Sakti. As one who confers divine knowledge, the gururestrains or removes the darkness of bondage from the devotee; thus, the deepersignificance of a guru does not refer merely to the ability to teach, direct, andguide, but also to the capacity to cause the disciple to internalize his/her identity,purpose, and meaning of life. Thus, a person with the power to remove another’sbondage is no ordinary human.As to the initiate ( ́si ̧sya) of the Padam ̄al ̄a Mantra Vidy ̄a, the Dev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧naasserts that there are no gender or caste specifications; the knowledge is accessibleto anyone who adores the goddess, but success depends on the student’s prepara-tion through initiation. A disciple must rely solely on the guru and be prepared tosurrender everything to the guru.In Tantric d ̄ık ̧s ̄as, the guru confers divine knowledge and, as a consequence,destroys the initiate’s ignorance or sin. The purpose of the d ̄ık ̧s ̄a then relates to thetwo roots da (to give) and k ̧sa (to destroy). Tantric initiation, regardless of the sect,is a complicated procedure. Some aspects of Tantric initiations appear to be greatlyelaborated versions of tribal initiation rites that still prevail in parts of India. Suchrites traditionally were a rite of passage and a symbolic rebirth wherein an experi-enced elder led the young into adulthood. The lack of caste and gender require-ments for Tantric initiation is distinct from Vedic initiation, which is limited tothe first three castes; such liberalism may underscore the Tantric connection totribal practices.A second prerequisite for participation in the Padam ̄al ̄a Mantra Vidy ̄a ritualis internal and external preparation. Internal preparation begins with specificmental and physical practices (aparih ̄arya pr ̄arambhik) involving cleansing themind of negative impulses and inclinations of a debasing nature. The Dev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧naspecifications are typically Tantric in that the s ̄adhaka must prepare mentally"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"245Tantric Incantation in the Dev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧na(bh ̄ava) in order to grasp the significance of Tantric regulations (vidhe), performritualistic practices and strenuous physical exercises and utter germ-syllables (b ̄ıjamantra).59 External preparation involves living on alms (bhik ̧s ̄anna bh ̧ ̄ojana),following specific religious rules and taboos in relation to food habits, behavior,time and space (pura ́scara ̧na). Also the Dev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧na specifies that preparation forthePadam ̄al ̄a Mantra Vidy ̄a requires the ́si ̧sya to make a vow called v ̄ıravrata(literally hero’s vow). Ordinarily the word v ̄ıra refers to someone who iscourageous, but within the context of Tantrism, the term indicates a being whothrough discipline and mental preparation (bh ̄ava) has evolved beyond the af-flicted state of ordinary humans (pa ́su). Only by following strictly prescribedprocedures including control of the senses, cleansing the self of negative inclina-tions, meditation, penance, and following the ways of justice and truth can aperson transcend the pa ́su state to become a v ̄ıra. Having taken the vow, the seekerthen becomes a v ̄ıra s ̄adhaka. The term v ̄ıra is derived from v ̄ı (freedom from) andra (passion or desire).60 While in the state of v ̄ıra, the seeker must be devoid ofdesires, ignorance, and worldly activities; perform the required Tantric rites; andconform to the scriptural injunctions.61 The v ̄ıra state is one that requires greatmoral effort and the courage to confront endangering situations and steadfastpursuit of spiritual success (siddhi). One of the most grueling of the V ̄am ̄ac ̄ara ́S ̄akta practices performed by the v ̄ıra s ̄adhaka is the nilasadhana. On a specialnight, the s ̄adhaka must sit on a corpse in a deserted location such as a cremationground, riverbank, or pond and offer an oblation of consecrated flesh (ma-h ̄am ̄a ̇msa) to the fire deity. Through successful completion of the rite, he tran-scends to the highest state wherein he/she is united with the deity.According to the Dev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧na, the s ̄adhaka must perform the Padam ̄al ̄aMantra Vidy ̄a only when wearing black clothing (k ̧r ̧s ̧na vastra) and a black garland,a string of black beads for chanting mantras. He/she also must be anointed with aspecial black paste (k ̧r ̧s ̧na anulepanan) on the forehead and body. The black pastemade from the residual ash of sacrificial alters and clarified butter. Special types ofhoney and black sesame are to be used for the oblations. At the end of the ritual,thes ̄adhaka eats the consecrated meat that has been offered to the Dev ̄ı. Ingre-dients used in the performance of the Padam ̄al ̄a Mantra Vidy ̄a are those typical ofV ̄am ̄ac ̄ara ́S ̄akta Tantric rituals. In particular, two types of specially preparedhoney are required. Preparation begins with extracting the juice directly fromvarious flowers and canes; the juices are fermented, mixed together, and kept insealed containers for an extended period of fermentation. Honey thus prepared iscarefully combined in three specific ways and is categorized as spiritual liquor(k ̄ara ̧nav ̄ari) which has sattvic, rajasic, and tamasic natures.Another of the requirements for performing the Padam ̄al ̄a Mantra Vidy ̄a isthe offering of consecrated flesh or mah ̄am ̄a ̇msa. The sacrifice is prepared fromeight types of meat sacred to the goddess—human, cow, ram, horse, buffalo, boar,goat, and deer. After offering the mah ̄am ̄a ̧msa to the goddess, the s ̄adhaka isrequired to eat it. Vedic texts mention sages who, in their ritualistic performances,"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"246Lina Guptaused certain animal meats for oblations and afterward ate the meat as a blessingfrom the divine.62 But it is only the V ̄am ̄ac ̄ara ́S ̄akta rituals that require offeringmah ̄am ̄a ̧msa to the deity. In Tantrism, the spiritual liquor represents ́Sakti, theGoddess as energy, and the meat represents ́Siva. When taken together, radiantbliss and mok ̧sa are realized by the s ̄adhaka while in a living state.63The actual performance of the Padam ̄al ̄a Mantra Vidy ̄a ritual consists ofthree parts—ritual offerings, physical actions or movements, and vocal aspects.Various oblations include offerings of the mah ̄am ̄a ̧msa, black sesame seeds(kau ̧n ̧d ̄agni homa), spiritual water (k ̄ara ̧nav ̄ari tarpa ̧na), clarified butter, and thethree special types of honey (trimadhu tarpa ̧na). The physical actions are com-prised of visualization of the presiding deities on different parts of the body(ny ̄asa), drawing special diagrams on a birch leaf (yantra ma ̧n ̧dala on bhurja patra),carrying a talisman that includes the deity’s name or a particular mantra (kavaca),practicing hand or finger gestures needed for spiritual attainment (mudr ̄a), andpracticing breathing exercises (pr ̄a ̧n ̄ay ̄ama). Simultaneously, the s ̄adhaka mustfulfill the vocal requirements of the ritual, that is, chant spells (mantrocc ̄arana),utter germ syllables (japa) and repeat the thirty-two mantras eight thousand timesin fulfillment of what is known as the pura ́scara ̧na.Thepura ́scara ̧na primarily refers to the repetition of mantras. Although inHinduism there are various types of pura ́scara ̧na, in Tantric s ̄adhana it is theforemost act. The success of the Padam ̄al ̄a Mantra Vidhya rests on the specificnumber of repetitions of the mantras; particularly efficacious, repetition ensuresthe likelihood of attaining the goal. Although normally mantras are repeated topropitiate a deity, in this ritualistic context, the repetitions call forth the appropri-ate aspect of the deity. The five stages of pura ́scara ̧na are: (1) muttering the japagerm syllables and repeating mantras; (2) homa (oblations to the ceremonial fire);(3)tarpa ̧na (offering spiritual water or liquor to the deity); (4) abhi ̧seka (ablutionand consecration of the deity; (5) virprabhojana giving Brahmins the food offeredto the deity. In addition, there are elaborate rules and restrictions for performingthepura ́scara ̧na. In general, twelve injunctions (dv ̄adasaite dharma ̧h) are followedto achieve success in muttering mantras (mantrasiddhidan).64 Thus not only is thes ̄adhaka required to chant the thirty-two mantras of the Padam ̄al ̄a Mantra Vidy ̄a,but he must do so according to the pura ́scara ̧na requirements as well.TheDev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧na, while not considered a full-fledged Pur ̄a ̧na, is, nonethe-less, a work of great authority on the worship of Dev ̄ı. Steeped in Tantric lore, richin incantations and ceremonial hymns, and filled with ritual prescriptions, the textis invaluable. Certainly the work provides fertile ground for the study of theorigins of Tantrism in general and more specifically the origins of ́S ̄akta Tantrism.Many of the features of its myths and rituals harken back to an antiquity rooted innon-Vedic aboriginal rites, as well as the Vedas, notably the Atharva Veda. We maydeduce from various sources that worship of goddesses as described in the firstthree Vedas inspired the initial compilers of the Dev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧na to compose thenuclear portion in the early centuries ...; and toward the end of the first"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"247Tantric Incantation in the Dev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧nacentury ..., elaboration and interpolations on the Atharva Veda augmented theoriginal core. When Tantrism emerged as a distinct religious path in the late Epicperiod, the Dev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧na was expanded and became the authoritative Pur ̄a ̧naconcerning worship of the Goddess in her most dreadful Tantric manifestation.The completed encyclopedic work, replete with intricate Tantric rituals must havebeen completed about the time of Var ̄ahamihira (sixth century ..) or soonthereafter. Central to its Tantric character is the Dev ̄ı Pur ̄a ̧na’s inclusion of thesixty-four types of vidy ̄as, the most powerful of which is the Padam ̄al ̄a MantraVidy ̄a. It is the master ritual for the attainment of the highest spiritual goals andone that demands the utmost seriousness and dedication from its performers.NOTES1.
