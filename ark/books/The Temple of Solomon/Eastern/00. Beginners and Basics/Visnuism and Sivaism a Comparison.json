On closer inspection it becomes clear however, first that many features of Hinduism have their roots in the Vedic past, and in the second place that it has been a few main currents which, from the very beginning up to the present' day, have come into prominence and have largely determined the character of that many-sided and all-enfolding culture which we in the West have chosen to call Hinduism. There can be no doubt whatever that these currents must, when viewed from their doctrinal and philosophical aspects be considered first and foremost soteriologies, and that they also present many aspects which make them worth studying from the angles of philosophy and sociologyvThis does not however prevent us from calling Visnuism and Sivaism as they presented, and still present, themselves to their adherents, religions. It will, in this series of lectures, be my endeavour to institute a comparison between these two Indian religions, Sivaism and Visnuism. That is not to say that I shall overlook the fact that neither current is in itself a unity. There is, within Visnuism, a considerable difference between, for instance, the theories and the ritualism of the Vaikhänasas in the South and the devotionalism of the followers of Caitanya in Bengal, and Viracivisni, flourishing in Karnätaka, has rejected the traditional brahmanical rites which the Saiva-Siddhänta has, in many respects, retained. Nevertheless, there is a Sivaism and there is a Visnuism and it will be part of my task— while comparing these religions and drawing attention to parallel or divergent developments, to the common heri­tage and interrelations— to bring out what is common to all forms of each of the two great religious currents."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Considering myself absolved from the obligation to give a regular account of the main relevant facts such'as those relating to the history of Visnu and Siva worship from the earliest times, the mythological concepts to which their figures have given rise, their iconography in plastic arts and the philosophical and theological doctrines developed in the communities of their worshippers,1 I would like to make an attempt at instituting, in a scries of more or less condensed studies, a somewhat detailed comparison between those aspects of both religious currents which in the last years have attracted my special attention. Since it cannot even be my purpose to treat all 'important questions or to deal adequately with all periods of the religious history of India, I intend to dwell especially upon some significant points which have perhaps not been sufficiently stressed in the publications of my pre­decessors. I hope that a certain personal preference for definite problems and definite periods or phases in the development of Saivism and Vaisna- vism will not be beyond forgiveness.It may be true that in our oldest document, the Rgveda, Visnu occu­pies but a subordinate position, his personality— to use this term in this connection—is at the same time not only more important there than would appear from the number of the occurrences of his name in this text, but is also in its striking features sufficiently clean-cut and, moreover, in remarkable harmony with the god’s image as given by the later sources.2 Rudra also has from the very beginning a character and even a position of his own3 and some important features in the later Siva can likewise be said to emerge from the Vcdic texts with all clearness desirable.It is therefore interesting to compare the most important traits of character of both gods as far as they appear from the Vedic samhitäs.4 It has long ago been observed5 that the only anthropomorphic traits of Visnu are his often-mentioned three strides and his being a youth (RV. I, 155, 6). These essential features of his character, to which he owes epithets such as ‘swift’ and ‘wide-striding’, make him known to us as the immense (RV. 7,99,1 ; 2) god of far-extending motion who— for man in distress, to make his existence possible6— penetrates and traverses the spaces, whereas his highest step or abode is beyond mortal ken, in his dear and highest resort, the bright realm of heaven. While all beings dwell in these three strides or footsteps (RV. 1, 154, 2), the highest is the place of a well of honey, where rejoice the gods and those men who turn to the gods. O f Rudra, the terrible, dreadful one, on the2 CHARACTER OF VISNU AND RUDRA-SIVA"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"other hand, quite a number of physical features are recorded: arms, hand, limbs, lip, eyes, mouth, tongue, etc.; he wears braided hair (i, 114, 1; 5), his colour is brown (e.g. 2, 33, 5), his belly black and his back red.7 Frequent mention is made of his weapons, and these are weapons of offence. On Visnu’s disk and club the oldest texts are, however, silent. Rudra is clothed in a skin8 and haunts and dwells in mountains, an abode also attributed to Visnu. But while the passage VS. 16, 2-4 in which this feature is emphasized tries to induce Siva to show his auspicious aspect and to prevent him from injuring men, and while forests, mountains and wilderness are the sphere of his destructive activities, Visnu’s association with the mountains, where he is said to have been born and of which he is the ruler, impresses us as beneficial to human interests:9 the defeat of Vrta is, for instance, re­peatedly said to have taken place in the mountains, which, however, seem to be an clement of the scenery of the ‘ Urzeit’.Visnu is benevolent, never inimical (RV. 1,186,10), and a friend and ally of Indra whom he assists in slaying the great fiend and antagonist Vrtra, the representative of chaos, and in spreading out the spaces between heaven and earth (RV. 6, 69, 5). Both gods are sometimes so intimately associated as to form a sort of dual deity, Indrävisnü, and to participate in each other’s qualities and activities. Rudra, on the other hand, has no special friend among the gods. Only once he appears associated with Soma (RV. 6, 74), not directly because of his formidable nature10 but because he is supposed to be able to avert illness, destruction and other manifestations of evil. And he enjoys this reputation owing to his dreadful power of sending and causing fever, evil and disaster, to his fierceness, malevolence and destructiveness. However much the poets try to deprecate his wrath— impending also when there is no offence— they do not hesitate to mention his bad points : he is a cheat, deceiver and lord of robbers, and most statements of his power occur in appeals for mercy.Their relation to the demoniac powers and the Maruts is in this connection of special interest. Wheras Visnu is engaged in vanquishing the demons, Rudra does not come into conflict with them. As to the not-individualized group of the Maruts, as Indra’s brilliant allies and attendants they enter into association with Visnu, but Rudra, who is repeatedly said to be their father, is never drawn into the warlike activities of these deities who, though occasionally showing the mal­evolent traits of their father, are on the whole benefactors of man andCHARACTER OF VISNU AND RUDRA-SIVA 3"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"world. Rudra is, on the contrary, the chief of an indefinite host of partial manifestations of his own nature which, like this god (in the singular) himself may make their numinous presence felt everywhere and at any time. He moreover maintains intimate relations with the great mass of demoniac beings. In this connection it is interesting to notice also that, whereas Visnu— although he may assume various forms11— is so to say one single individual, Rudra has in these ancient texts some doubles, which arc sometimes identical with him— thus Sarva and Bhava in VS. 16,18; 28— sometimes are described as distinct from him.There is one god with whom both Rudra (e.g. AV. 7, 87, t) and Visnu (e.g. RV. 2, 1, 3) are identified. But here also the difference is obvious. Rudra is said to bç, i.e. to manifest himself in, or as, fire:12 ‘Agni is Rudra; just as a tiger stands in anger, so he also (stands)’ (TS. 5, 5, 7, 4)— Visnu’s relations with the god of fire are co-operative and complementary in nature: they are for instance invoked conjointly and both of them are, in a brähmana, it is true (AiB. 1, 4, 10), lords and guardians of the consecration, which they confer on man. Besides, Agni is the sacrificial fire and Visnu the sacrifice (TS. 2, 29,1), and both gods rejoice in the sacrificial butter (AV. 7, 29).Extending our inquiries to the later parts of Vedic literature we see that Rudra’s malevolence is still more prominent. He houses in forests and jungles, in places where man falls a victim to fright and terror. He is the lord of the wild animals, which are said to be a manifestation of his cruel nature (ÉB. 12, 7, 3, 20), and the patron of those who hold aloof from the Aryan society and its way of living. In contradistinction to the other gods who are believed to live in the East, Rudra dwells in the North, the region of dangerous mountains. His isolated position is emphasized by the myth according to which he remained behind when the other gods succeeded in attaining heaven by ritual means (ÉB. I, 7, 3, 1). He is indeed excluded from the normal soma cult, but receives informal balis (offerings of food thrown on the ground), often also the remainders of oblations, or what is injured in the sacrifice (ÉB. I, 7, 4> 9)'> besides, he has some sacrificial rites of his own. His cult requires precaution and he is appeased (RV. 2, 33, 5, etc.), that is to say one gives him offerings in order to get rid of him. The benevolent or rather merciful aspects of his ambivalent nature find on the other hand expression in some epithets such as Sambhu ‘the beneficent or kind one’ and Siva:(KS. 3, 59; 63) ‘Siva is thy name; thou art a healing4 CHARACTER OF VISNU AND RUDRA-SlVA"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"5medicine, forbear to do me harm’. This epithet— which is already given to him at RV. io, 92, 9— is however also applied to other gods, without being peculiar to any particular figure.With regard to Visnu it is important to notice that in the brähmanas his relations with the sacrifice arc evident and of special practical consequence for the Vcdic worshipper: he is the sacrifice itself (c.g. ÉB. 14, I, I, 6) and the sacrificer who imitates his great cosmic act, by which he obtained for the gods the ability to manifest their power everywhere, viz. his three strides, gains, whilst identifying himself with the god, the three provinces of the universe to attain heaven (&B. 1,9, 3, 9f.; 15).I shall not repeat here what has in many books and articles been said on the so-called original character of these gods, or rather what has a bearing on the kernel of the Rudra and Visnu conceptions. Let it suffice to say that in my opinion the essence of the former was, in the minds of Vcdic men, the power of the uncultivated and unconquercd, dangerous, unreliable, unpredictable, hence much to be feared nature, experienced as a divinity. His very character lent itself admirably to splitting up into partial manifestations as well as to assimilation of divine or demoniac powers of cognate nature, were they Aryan or non-Aryan. It hardly needs saying that the class poetry of the Rgveda does not show us the whole Rudra and that the later Veda has recorded more popular traits ; the conclusion that those features which are foreign to the earliest corpus did not exist at the time of its compilation is, I am convinced, inadmissible.13The solution of the much debated and often wrongly posed question as to the so-called origin of the Visnu conception— we had better inquire after the core and essence of the god’s nature as understood by Vedic man— has very often on too onesidedly naturalistic lines of argument been supposed to lie in an interpretation as a solar deity. Yaska (Mr. 12, 19) cited already an authority who identified the god’s striding with the diurnal course of the sun. I must confess that in the course of time my own ideas of this question have considerably evolved. Although I am still inclined to assume that there is much truth in the time-honoured interpretation of the god’s character as representing pervasiveness and spatial extensiveness, and especially that pervasiveness which is essential to the establishment and maintenance of our cosmos and beneficial to the interests of men and gods, I would now hesitate to add that ‘the general idea originally .underlying this central mythicalCHARACTER OF VISNU AND RUDRA-SIVA"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"6act seems to have been the eternal phenomenon of the pervading and omnipresent, mighty and blessing stream of celestial light, warmth, and energy’.14 At the moment I would lay greater emphasis upon the pervasiveness as such which was believed to manifest itself in a great variety of phenomena and on the god’s relations to the axis timidi.15This is not to say that I am convinced by that interpretation o f the function and significance of the god which was some years ago pro­posed by my esteemed colleague and compatriot Kuipcr,16 who, focussing his readers’ attention almost exclusively on the Rgveda there to find the truest image of the god’s character and on his supposedly principal cosmogonic significance, regards him as the ambiguous mythological figure which, occuping the central place in the cosmic classificatory system and thus standing between the two parties o f the Vrtra-fight, nevertheless turned the scale in favour of Indra. It is true that Visnu is closely associated with the dhruva dik— which is not the nadir, but the fixed or central quarter, that is the central place on the earth under the zenith17— but one does not see in the texts that the relation between Indra in the South (AV. 3, 27, 2),18 Varuna, the great asura— who however plays no part in the Vrtra combat— in the West and Visnu in the centre19 is developed into a coherent system or has any significance in Indra’s great cosmogonic achievement and the ensuing organisation of our cosmos. I am rather inclined to suppose that Visnu’s undeniable relations with the centre may be interpreted otherwise. Although I am20 disposed to admit that the centre represents ‘the totality of the parts distributed over the four quarters ’, I do not think that this is its full import. We now know that from the point of view of archaic religions this centre or navel (o/x^ccAds-)21 is the place in which the axis mundi, the central pillar or frame of creation,22 reaches the earth, putting the cosmic levels into communication and constituting a means of ‘travelling to’ heaven as well as a canal through which the heavenly blessings may penetrate into the abode of men. Visnu may even be considered as representing this cosmic pillar23 itself: he is for instance (RV. 7, 99, 2) explicitly said to sustain the upper component of the universe, a well-known function of that pillar. His vertical pervasiveness is moreover illustrated by the fact that the yiipa— the sacrificial post which in definite rites is mounted by the sacrificer to reach heaven24 and which may be considered a representative of this axis25— belongs to him and that he lives in the mountains,26 another manifestation of the axis27 and a place where heaven and earth meet.28CHARACTER OF VISNU AND RUDRA-$IVA"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Nor is it clear to me why Visnu should be the ‘unity of the two an­tagonistic parties, upper world and nether world’,29 standing in, and being of each of these two worlds, and belonging consequently also to the gods of the nether world,30 whom he could not fight, as Indra did, ‘because’— I quote Kuiper— ‘these two were part of his essence’. But even the Rgveda describes him as destroying demons (7, 99, 4 f.)31 and states (1,155,6) that Visnu goes to war, that accompanied by Indra he forces open the cattle-shed of Vaia, the mythological duplicate of Vrtra32 (1,156,4).33 As far as I am able to see there is no textual evidence of Visnu’s arising from the nether world and subsequent standing on the mountain or mountains.34 I would rather say that Vcdic man con­sidered him to be present in any part of the cosmic axis: his is, at the lower end, the yüpa, and the brahmans constantly identify him with the sacrifice which is located in the navel of the earth ;35 at the upper end is his high domain or ‘protectorate’;36 as the god of three seats (fri— wdhastha : 1, 156, 5) he manifests himself also in the middle.37 Hence also, I would suppose, Visnu’s relations— sometimes even matri­monial relations— with Aditi,38 whose womb he protects;39 this womb, which is explicitly identified with the navel of the earth (VS. 1,11), but which is more than that, namely the ‘place of universal creation’, because Aditi— whose name in all probability means ‘Freedom’— manifests her nature not only in the earth but in any broad and wide expanse in the generative and life-sustaining nature, in any expansion of phenomenal life. Visnu on the other hand, far from being a static representative of the axis,' creates, while striding widely and traversing the universe, the room, which is indispensable to that expansion.40If it be permitted to prolong this digression for a moment, I would repeat that I am unable to read in the texts that Visnu rose up from the nether world to which he originally belonged at the very moment when the dual world was, by Indra’s great achievement, created.41 It is Indra who called on his companion and associate42 for co-operation, asking him to stride, for him, Indra, over a great distance,43 or as the Brhaddcvatä (6, 122 f.) has it: ‘Going to Visnu Indra said: “ I wish to slay Vrtra. Stride forth to-day and stand at my side. Heaven must make room for my outstretched bolt.” Saying “ Yes”, Visnu did so.. . .’ So Visnu’s activity44 preceded Indra’s fight with Vrtra45 which in its turn made the organization of our world possible.It is also in this connection that mention is (RV. 8, 12, 27) made of three strides, the well-known and obviously most important featureCHARACTER OF VISNU AND RUDRA-SIVA 7"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"in Visnu’s traversing movement. From the Rgvedic references to this activity it does not however emerge that the first step, or only the first step, was taken in the nether world or corresponds to it. O h the con­trary, the poets do not omit stating that Visnu has taken his strides from the same place as the Maruts who exert their influence in the higher atmosphere (RV. 5, 87, 4) and from that place from which the gods are expected to promote mans interests (1, 22, 16)46. Although the poets do not indeed lay much stress on the exact places where the steps were taken, they are quite explicit in describing them as establishing the broad dimensional actuality of the earthly space,47 or in stating that the god strode out on the earth (AV. 12,1,10). There is no doubt much truth in the explication of the number three as expressing the idea of totality and therefore referring to the expansion of the whole earth or even of the whole universe,48 but it is very doubtful whether the rele­vant texts may be supposed to point to an ascending movement o f the god.49 Yet one of the poets (RV. 7, 99, 1) makes a distinction between ‘both terrestrial spaces’ of the god known to men— which has been righdy explained as earth and atmosphere50— and the highest, o f which Visnu himself has knowledge. The texts do not say that the third step represents all three movements,51 they state that there is a highest step, station or abode of Visnu— the term padani admits of all these translations—which5* may be seen for ever by the successful sacrificers (RV. I, 22, 20), and is also called his dear domain or protectorate; there is a spring of honey, i.e. the draught of immortality (1, 154, 5) and there is the god’s banditti, which means that the god who is active in the universe is closely and mysteriously connected with that ‘place’, which is practically ‘heaven’.53 There is nothing to prevent us from assuming that there is the ‘place beyond space’ (7, 100, 5),54 where the god is said to reside.As is well known there has been a tendency, even since the oldest Yajurvedic texts and the pre-Yâska interpreters of the Rgveda, to connect Visnu’s strides with the triple division of the universe (sky or heaven, earth and what is between them). It is however doubtful whether this interpretation can be called a merely naturalistic one. And it may, on the other hand, be true that the poets of the R-gveda, in connection with these strides, never refer to this triple division,55 it is dangerous to rely on the argumentum e silentio and to isolate the Rgveda too much from the other Vedic literature.We should moreover always be aware of the fact that the Rgveda is first and foremost a religious8 CHARACTER OF VISNU AND RUDRA-SlVA"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"9document56 and that the cosmographie and cosmogonic details con­tained in it arc not represented with a view to describe the universe or to explain its origin in a scientific or philosophical way.57 What was relevant was to know if the Great Pervader has really pervaded the whole universe in which he is worshipped and if men also were safe in these three steps (FS. 23, 49 f; cf. RV. 1, 154, 2), that is, in this world, as it was relevant to know for certain that out of the primordial chaos Indra— I do not mention other gods whose names are sometimes recorded in this connection— with Visnu’s help produced and organized this cosmos.58 This fact must always be commemorated and celebrated because thus man substantially contributes to the maintenance, renewal and reproduction of the creation of this god59 who always remains, hic et nunc, an active promoter of positive values and beneficial processes in this world.60In a similar way Visnu’s activity for the welfare of gods and men is celebrated in the hope that he will continue to create safety and room to live in for the latter61 and to win vibranti,62 i.c. the power to display their beneficent activities for the former. Moreover, as the traversing and pervading god par excellence Visnu docs not only make room for man’s sacrifice to reach the powers of heaven (RV. 7, 99, 4),63 but also helps the sacrificcr (1, 156, 5), brings him wealth and other valu­ables64 and conducts him along undangerous paths to a state of safety (6, 69, I ; 8, 77, io).65 He is also often allied with that important power of life which circulates in the universe, is the main clement of the sacrifice and imparts divine life, that is to say, with the soma.66 He is therefore on the one hand implored to fill his hands from the sky, the earth and the vast wide atmosphere, and to bestow objects of value from the right and from the left (AV. 7, 26, 8)67— his traversing movement was no doubt supposed to expand also on the horizontal plane68— and on the other expected to lead, as the sacrifice— or simply as the traverser— , man upwards so as to rescue him from all evil.69 For last but not least Visnu is the god who acquired for the sacrificer that all-pervading power which is characteristic of his own nature: by ritually imitating the god’s strides the sacrificer gains the earth, the aerial expanse, and heaven, to reach ‘the goal, the safe foundation (pratisthä), the highest light’.70 The sacrificer, duly consecrated and taking these strides, is Visnu71 and the strides lead him to the highest goal.72 Although in this connection these three strides may impress us as symbolizing an analysis for ritual purposes of the totality expressed by the three strides,73 they arc in my2—v.s.CHARACTER OF VISNU AND RUDRA-SIVA"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"opinion not exactly coordinated with the three parts of the visible universe, because the third stride does not lead to the firmament, but into heaven.74 That that highest step or place is also described as being extended like the eye in heaven (RV. i, 22, 20)75 is of course no counter­argument.76As far as I can see now, the power complex experienced by Vcdic man as the presence and the activity of a divine personality called Visnu may, to sum up, best be described as the ‘idea’ of universal penetration or pervasiveness, as the axis mundi and otherwise, of the omnipresence of a mighty and beneficent energy, in which all beings abide and which essentially contributes to the maintenance of those conditions and those processes in the universe on which man’s life and subsistence depend. Among these are also the processes connected with fertility and procreation which I have not stressed in the foregoing.77Let us continue our exposition of the main facts relating to the de­velopment of both divine figures in the following centuries.As to Rudra the tendency to adopt this outsider by emphasizing his benevolent aspects and putting him on a par with other gods continues. Already in the Rgveda a deprecation, a request not to send disease but to approach kindly, may combine with the expression of his sovereign might, which enables him to come into contact with the race of the celestial powers (RV. 7,46, 2). Whilst, in the Pravargya ritual, the formula ‘Hail to Rudra’ is, even without offering, pronounced, Test the god should do harm’ ($B. 14, 2, 2, 38), in the ritual of the royal consecration Rudra Pasupati is beside Agni Grhapati, Soma Vanaspati, Brhaspati Väk, Mitra Satya, etc., one of the recipients of oblations (ÉB. 5, 3, 3,1 ff.).78 The frequent appeal to him for help in case of disease — of which he may be the originator79— may have contributed much to his gaining access, as the god who grants remedies, to a circle o f honourable deities who preside over other spheres of human interest: one must, for instance, sacrifice to Agni, the despoiler, if one finds a forest-fire in one’s way; to Pusan, the pathmaker, if one is to undertake a journey; to Rudra, if there is a multitude of diseases, etc.80 In the morning litany he should (according to the Sänkhayana-Srautasutra, 6, 3,4) be addressed, together with Soma, as the regent of the North, on an equal footing with Mitra and Varuna, the regents of the West, Indra and Brhaspati and other powers who are besought to grant their protection in the other regions of the universe. Moreover, as the leader of a host of minor deities Rudra is, according to theio CHARACTER OF VISNÜ AND RUDRA-SIVA"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Satapatha-Brähmana, to be considered a chief, ksatrah.81 In some im­portant brähmanas82 his figure indeed appears to have acquired special importance and a reality different from that of many other members of the pantheon. Later on, the author of the Brhadäranyaka-Upanisad (i, 4, n) regards him as one of the ksaträh among the gods, his col­leagues being Indra, Varuna, Soma, Parjanya, Yama, Mrtyu and Isäna.83 These gods, it is said, represent ksatram, ruling power, which is called “an excellent manifestation’. Elsewhere in the same text Parjanya, Äditya and Indra admit him as a partner (2, 2, 2).84 An important factor in the process of Rudra’s growth— which should not however be one- sidedly emphasized85— is his identification with the mighty god of fire, Agni,86 and which may, in a sense, point to a process analogous to Visnu’s appropriating part of the greatness of Indra.87 In a later upanisad (PrU. 2, 9) the god is together with Indra, Sürya and other gods said to be an aspect of the universal life or vital power,88 the most essential of all powers, on which everything is firmly estab­lished (2, 6), whereas another upanisadic author, discussing the nature of the Atman— that is the Supreme universal Soul, identical with Brahman, of which every intelligent being is a partial individuation— equates him with a considerable number of divine powers, among whom are not only Indra and Savitar, but also Isäna, Bhava and Sambhu— aspects or partial manifestations of Rudra’s nature— Prajäpati, Visnu and Näräyana (MaiU. 6, 8; 7, 7). Meanwhile this development had culminated in those particular circles which produced the Svetäsva- tara-Upanisad. This work will claim our special attention in the next lecture.At the same period, in which Rudra-Siva was gradually reaching the supreme rank, the Visnu of our texts had likewise been advanced to a higher position. His relations, or community of interests, with Prajä­pati,89 which date already from Rgvedic times, arc intensified. Whereas the oldest upanisads added nothing important to his history, those of the second period which possibly were, roughly speaking, compiled about the same time as the Bhagavadgïtâ90 or somewhat later, begin to recognize him as a supreme monotheistic God. In the Maitrâyanïya- Upanisad he is not only one of the chief ‘ bodies’ of Prajäpati or a mani­festation of that one overlord who is the totality (sarvah kascit prabhuh), but is also called the Supreme Light, which is unmoving, free from death, unwavering and stable, pure griefless bliss.91 One place is of special interest, because it contains a stanza which with slight variationCHARACTER OF VISNU AND RUDRA-SlVA II"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"occurs also in the Brhadäranyaka:92: ‘The face of the True-and-Real is covered with a golden vessel; uncover it, O Püsan, in order to see him whose (that of which the) normal behaviour-and-observance is the True-and-Real.’ Instead of the last words (satyadharmäya drstaye) the Maitrayanlya reads satyadharmäya visnave which must mean ‘in order to (establish contact with) Visnu whose normal and fundamental con­duct consists in being the True-and-Real Satyadharman, in the Rgvcda an epithet of Agni, Varuna, Savitar, is, in the Mahäbhärata, among the thousand names of Visnu.93 Nevertheless it is quite true that many phases in the long process of Visnu’s rise to the highest position have completely disappeared from our sight.94 That his ancient functions, known to us from a regrettably limited number of references in the samhitäs, have, in their totality and as a whole, contributed much to this process seems indisputable.There would be little sense in repeating what may be read in every History of Hinduism on these gods as they present themselves to us in the epic period. Suffice it to say that both Visnu and Siva are, in the epics, ambiguous figures, being on the one hand deities with heroic traits of character and, on the other, rising to supramundane dignity, representing or tending to represent the Supreme Being. Not rarely it is not at all clear whether they are to be regarded as devas or as the supreme God,95 whether, for instance, Siva’s protection is to be sought because he is the boon-giving Lord, the omnipresent soul and creator of the universe and the embodiment of its three divisions or because he is the great deva of frightful aspects who has now also become a con­queror of demoniac power.96 Both gods are now endowed with all divine qualities imaginable and have become the central characters in mythical tales which will enthral the minds of many generations to come. Both are adored by other gods, Visnu also by his fellow Ädityas of whom he is the youngest and in accordance with the well-known ‘youngest-smartest’ motif of mythical tales also the greatest.97 Neither of them had however, in the last centuries before and the first centuries after the beginning of our era, ascended to the zenith of his power and dignity. Leaving Krsna and the other doubles of his personality out of consideration Visnu plays, in his own name, a less important part in the epics than his rival who— although mention is still, but rarely, made of a distinct deity Rudra— is now almost generally known as Siva, notwithstanding, it is true, his ‘doubles’ or partial manifestations continue to be distinguished: ‘To Pasupati, to 3iva, to Samkara.’9812 CHARACTER OF VISNU AND RUDRA-SlVA"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"13Both of them retain striking features which they possessed already in thè Vedic past,\" but absorb, as supramundane figures, other divine beings. Those who adore the Sun are for instance said actually to wor­ship Siva100 and Visnu has now taken over Indra’s task101 to fight demons and perform heroic deeds. Becoming the typical fighter for the gods it is he who after recovering the amrta from the asuras defeated them with his discus.102 The idea of avatäras— incarnations in order to rehabilitate the world— is in course of development,103 but his benevo­lence is rarely in doubt and he essentially remains actively interested in the welfare and prosperity of man and the world. Siva, uncamiy, wrathful and incalculable,104 not rarely terrible, fierce and impetuous, famous for his preponderantly destructive energy,105 is still a much- feared author of mischief. That certain circles continued to regard him as an outsider standing apart from the other gods may appear from the popular story of Daksa’s sacrifice.106 But he is an ambivalent god: the early epic recognizes him as an ascetic, rapt in the contemplation of his own unfathomable being, who, though performing terrific austerities, is also often willing to grant boons and to confer favours upon his worshippers.107 His phallic aspect, attesting to his ability for unlimited production, which archaeological finds show us to have existed already in the 1st century B.C.,108 is not unknown to the Mahäbhärata.109 In the Rämäyana references to his divine power and greatness are not wanting, but most of these occur in similes referring to his destructive activities in battle, etc. ; in any case they do not indicate that he was regarded as supreme. In short Visnu is, generally speaking, a friend nearer to man, Siva a lord and master, ambivalent and manv- sided.110The Indians were always inclined to father religious, philosophical or sociological doctrine upon superhuman authorities. In the great epic it is not only Krsna who himself preaches his religion and soterio- logy, but also Visnu who, appearing, after a sacrifice, in the form of Indra, expounded the dharma of the ksatriyas,111 resolving the doubts of the kings about the application of the dandnmti. Sivaite parallels are not wanting : Siva is described as promulgating the Pâsupata doctrine and the science of dandamti, the administration of justice.112Part of the events narrated in connection with these gods is to explain epithets or traits of their character and these tales are of special interest because— though as a rule etymologically or historically wrong— they are a welcome source of information on the beliefs and convictions ofCHARACTER OF VISNU AND RUDRA-SIVA"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"those who invented and divulged them. Thus §iva is also called Ni- lakantha because he swallowed the poison kälaktlta, or, according to a variant tale explaining the colour of his neck, Sitikantha because Naräyana seized him by the throat which became dark.113 Part of these explanations actually are reinterpretations: thus his name Sthänu— which characterizes him as the motionless one and is often connected with his ascetic performances114— is also attributed to his ithyphallic character,115 and his name Tryambaka to his love for three goddesses, viz. the sky, the waters and the earth.116The names and epithets attributed to these two figures are indeed especially instructive. W e may, to begin with, distinguish between those names which are of more or less frequent occurrence and those which are only rarely given to them. As to the former category it strikes us that only a few names of a very general character and applicable to any divine being of rank are given to both figures: Aja ‘the unborn One, i.e. the Eternal’; Ananta ‘the infinite One’ ; the untranslatable117 Bhagavat; Devasrestha ‘the best of the gods’; Tsana ‘the Lord’ (mostly, it is true, of Siva); Mahesvara ‘the great Lord’; Yogesvara; Satya, i.e. he who is and acts in conformity with the true and real.118 To those other names which are really distinctive belong in the first place some that are old and traditional: Bhava, Pasupati, Rudra, Sankara, Sarva in the case of Siva, Hari, and Vaikuntha119 in the case of Visnu, and for the most part these originally belonged to doubles or Teilivesen- heiten of the gods or to manifestations of divine power120 which in the course of time came to fuse with them. In Siva’s case some pre-epic (originally adjectival) names reveal to us121 various aspects of his nature; Ugra ‘the Powerful’; Bhima ‘the Formidable’; Hara ‘the Scizer’, but also Midhvas ‘the Bountiful’. Interestingly enough, authorities observe that names such as Brahman, Paramatman and Bhagavan, when applied to Visnu, do not refer to three persons but to one divine person in different aspects.122 Other names are indicative of their relations with other gods: thus Visnu is Indränuja ‘Indra’s younger brother’, Siva Bhutapati ‘ the lord of divine and demoniac beings of lower rank ’ ; of their outward appearance: Siva, the ascetic, wears matted locks, braided or tufted hair and is therefore called Jatila, Kapardin, Sikhin; is naked: Digvasas or clad in skins: Krttivasas; he has three eyes: Tryaksa. Visnu has four arms: Caturbhuja; is lotus-eyed: Padmalocana and from his navel he produces the lotus from which arose the creator Brahma:123 Padmanäbha. The names may be related to their weapons14 CHARACTER OF VISNU AND RUDRA-SlVA"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"or attributes: Siva is armed with the trident or his peculiar weapon called pinäka, hence his being Sülabhrt, Sülapäni, etc., Pinäkin, etc. (also Dhanvin ‘the one with the bow’), Visnu with the discus: Cakra- päni, etc. Siva is also, and frequently, Vrsabhadhvaja ‘ the one who has a bull on his banner’ or Vrsabhavähana ‘the one who has a bull as his vehicle’, or Nandisvara ‘ the master of the bull Nandin’, Visnu however is only once called Garudadhvaja. Part of their names are connected with their deeds or achievements, thus Siva is the destroyer of Tripura, the triple city of the asuras, and hence called Tripuraghna etc., and Visnu is known as Janârdana, because, an epic poet says (Mbh. 5, 68, 6), he strikes terror into the demons, or as the killer of Madhu: Madhuhan. Siva is also called after the divine woman with whom he now has en­tered into a regular alliance: Umâpati, Gaurïsa, and Visnu is in his epithets variously associated with Sri. Interestingly enough Visnu, not Siva is, in the great epic, known as Acintya ‘the Inconceivable’, Anädi ‘the Eternal’, Vibhu ‘the one whose might and sovereignty extend far and pervade all’, a term applied in the Mundaka-Upanisad (1, I, 6) to the imperishable source of all existence, the substantive vibhüti coming into use for Visnu’s divine and universal power and dignity, and as Acyuta which characterizes him as the Inmovable and Unwavering One.124 Siva is on the other hand often known as the great god or lord : Mahädeva, Mahesvara, and, incidentally, Mahäghora, Mahäkarman, etc., etc., although epic authors give these names sometimes also to Visnu-Krsna.A well-known literary and liturgical form of praise, adoration and magnification of a god consists in pronouncing his names and epithets. This is at the same time a device for meditatively identifying oneself with aspects of the god’s nature; Visnu is even supposed to grant final emancipation to him who mentally recites his names.125 Shorter or longer enumerations are found already in the Veda. The names may, as in the Vedic Satarudriya hymn,126 be embedded in prayers, homage and references to the god’s might, or consist, like the largely stereo­typed sahasranämastotras of Hinduism,127 of a sort of general description of the god’s character or of a mere enumeration of names and epithets.128 In many circles this ‘prayer of names’ came to be one of the most characteristic expressions of devotion, its mental recitation being an excellent protective against evil which however easily degenerated into verbal magic.129 What strikes us in these enumerations of ‘a thousand130 names’ is that both gods have only a comparatively smallCHARACTER OF VISNU AND RUDRA-$IVA 15"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"number— about eighty131— of epithets and surnames in common. Some of these belong to well-known ancient deities who are equated to the two representatives of the Highest (Väyu, Yama, Dhätar), or are ancient epithets of other exalted beings (Sahasraksa ‘ with a thousand eyes’), some are divine titles of a more general character expressing aspects of divinity or superiority (Ananta, Ugra, Bhänu, Bhävana, Santa, Srestha, Käla, Danda, Dhruva, Guru, Gopati, Guha, Gambhïra, Sarva, Sthira, Sthavira, Varada, Bhü, Bhütâtman, Märga, Ksobhana, and of course Deva, Prabhu, ïsâna, Isvara) ; there is a honorific epithet such as Sumukha ‘fair-faced’ or a philosophical term such as Karana ‘the one who causes’ : both gods arc sometimes equated with brahman, and elsewhere Visnu bears the names Rudra, Sarva and Siva, which traditionally belong to his colleague, a point worth investigating in full detail. The other names, those which are exclusively given to one god, help us again to understand the ideas fostered by the worshippers and the qualities attributed by them to the object of their adoration. Thus the number of negated nouns assigned in the great epic to Visnu exceeds that used in connection with Siva; as the privative prefix often serves to emphasize the idea opposite to that expressed by the second member of the compound132 the former god was obviously believed to be firm and reliable (Acala ‘immovable’), happy and one who causes happiness (Afoka ‘free from sorrow’ and so a resort for those; who are unhappy), humble and modest (Amänin). Other names do not fail to inspire trust and confidence: Jie is a physician (Bliisaj), and medicine (Bhesaja).133Thus it is not surprising that Asvatthäman in order to obtain Siva’s aid in entering the camp of the enemy does not find difficulty in com­bining, in his prayer, a series of typically Sivaite names and epithets with a selected variety of appropriate references to the god’s readiness to grant boons, to his protective and destructive power and irresisti­bility as well as to his ability to assume many forms— the god will indeed manifest himself—-and his being the chief of large hosts of minor deities who in fact are not long in appearing.134 Yudhisthira, on the other hand, whilst extolling in a hymn of adoration Visnu- Krsna as the author of his success, the recovery of his kingdom— which he ascribes to the god’s grace, prudence and force, intelligence and pervasive energy— addresses him not only appositely as ‘destroyer of enemies’ or Jisnu ‘the victorious one’, but also as Purusa, the True- and-Real (Satya), the universal sovereign (Vibhu Samräj), and he does16 CHARACTER OF VISNU AND RUDRA-$IVA"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"not forget to add a considerable number of the god’s traditional epithets and to identify him with powerful deities and important concepts with whom he, the origin and dissolution cf the universe, in the course of time has become intimately allied.135W e must confine ourselves to these instances and to the remark that this nomenclature could suggest the headings under which to arrange the data relative to the gods’ nature and deeds. Not only the epics but, to mention only these, also the works of the great classical authors admit of the conclusion that the names and attributes which are pre­ferentially assigned to these gods bring out the main aspects of their powerful and venerable character.136 The great diversity of names and epithets was a welcome means of throwing light, in a particular context, on some one or other side of a god’s activity or of voicing the feelings or conceptions of the authors with regard to his character. The pre­ference of particular 3aiva or Vaisnava schools or communities for one of the many names of their god— for instance, of the Pasupati-Saivas for Pasupati, reinterpreted as ‘Lord of the (cattle-like) souls’, and of many Vaisnavas for Hari,— is as illustrative of important trends of Indian religious life as the aversion of, for instance, exclusive Vaisnavas to using the most representative name, Siva, of their God’s rival.CHARACTER OF VISNU AND RUDRA-$IVA 17"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"IIThe Gods’ Rise to SuperiorityLet us now return to the Svetäsvatara-Upanisad and consider it more closely. Coming chronologically after the Brhadaranyaka and Chändogya, but preceding the Bhagavadgîtâ this important work— which is generally thought to have been compiled by the Vth or IVth centuries B.C.— represents, in my opinion,1 a stage of development in Indian thought, in which the germs which had lain in the preceding centuries and from which the various philosophical views or meta­physical doctrines of the future generations were to develop, had already reached the first stage of growth without differentiating in any con­siderable degree. That is to say, the differentiation between the doc­trines about the essence and foundation of the universe, the soul and the material world had not yet made so great progress as five or six centuries later when the streams of Sämkhya and Vedanta thought had found their own beds. Leaving, however, the philosophical aspects of the Svetäsvatara undiscusscd we see, on the one hand, that for the compiler— as also for those authors who lived before and after him— the ultimate goal of all speculation was to show a way of escape from the samsara, that is victory over death, and, further, that the desire to identify and to know the Real, the foundation of all existence— which is almost from the beginning a consistent and conspicuous characteristic of Indian thought— has continued unaltered. It is, on the other hand, evident that the relations between microcosmos and macrocosmos, between individual and universe, between ätman and brahman are now more complicated and problematic than they were considered to be in the preceding period.This appears already from the opening stanza which, quoting those who discourse on brahman, inquires after the ultimate cause or origin of our existence: Ts brahma the cause?2 What is our origin? By what do we live, and on what are we firmly established?’ (It may be re­membered that the search for a pratisthä, a firm foundation, on which for instance our own existence is established, was among those im­portant problems which engaged the attention of the authors of the"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"brähmanas).3 ‘Presided over by whom’, the stanza continues, ‘do we live our different condition in pleasures and pains . . .?’ The author obviously belonged to those circles of meditative ascetics (6, 21) to whom he owed the insight that the ultimate foundation of all existence and the origin and ruler or governor of all life is the sole eternal (4, 21 ; 5, 13) Lord who bears both the perishable and die imperishable, the manifest and unmanifest (1, 8; 1, 10). It is in this connection worth noticing that the text significantly uses the verb isate ‘he rules’ and the noun tsah ‘the Lord’ to express the supreme ruling of a Lord who is characterized as immortal and imperishable, as the One, the Supreme Being emanating and withdrawing the world, the goal of that identi- ficatory ‘meditation’ which leads to complete cessation from all phenomenal existence and Who therefore is the last cause of bondage and liberation (1, 10 f.). That means that here some of the most salient features in the character of the post-Vcdic ïsvara are indicated with all distinctness desirable.It is the author’s main endeavour to establish the existence of this Highest Being. Quoting, integrating, and reinterpreting in what we might call a monotheistic sense numerous passages from Vedic texts4 he suggests that Agni,5 Savitar,6 the universal instigator and originator of all movement, and other gods, including the great lord of (biological) creation Prajapati (4, 2), the divine architect Visvakarman7 as well as the impersonal brahman (3, 7) actually are the Great Lord, who also created Hiranyagarbha,8 the Golden Germ of Rgveda 10, 121: according to this text the One, in the beginning, became the Golden Germ, which supporting heaven and earth was to be the sole Lord (patih) of creation. These divine figures attested, already in the later parts of the Rgvcdic corpus, to the growing tendency to extol one god as the greatest and highest of all, in short as the Supreme Lord and Ori­ginator. Time-honoured images, metaphors9 and terminology are quoted, not only to illustrate this identification but especially to corroborate the thesis that Rudra-Siva is this Supreme Being, that it is He, who is meant by the Vedic texts when they describe the creator whose eyes and faces, arms and feet are everywhere.10 Being beyond day and night, beyond being and ‘non-being’,11 Rudra-^iva is the ‘imperishable’ (aksaram)12 and ‘the desirable (splendour) of Savitar’ mentioned in the Sâvitrï stanza RV. 3, 62, io.13 This Sole Being stands like a tree firmly fixed in heaven (3, 9),14 penetrates the All, that is the totality of existence (3, 11), and the author does not hesitate toTHE GODS’ RISE TO SUPERIORITY 19"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"compare his God to a fire with fuel burnt15 and to consider him the best bridge to immortality (6, 19).16It is therefore not surprising that he also adopts that principle which is coextensive with the universe while penetrating ic completely, to wit the Purusa of the famous Rgvedic hymn 10, 90, to which we shall have to .revert in connection with the development of Visnuite theology (3, 14 £), and that he introduces the relative quotation by a positive answer to a question raised in the beginning of the upanisad (1, 2): ‘Is perhaps the Purusa to be considered the ultimate cause?’ : ‘I know this great Primeval Person, by whom this All is filled, who is a mighty universal ruler, who is omnipresent, Siva’ (3, 8 ff.). One should re­member that the equation Rudra = the All = the Purusa occurs for instance in the Taittinya-Âranyaka (10, 16, 1; 17, 1). This conception of the Supreme as a Primeval and omnipresent Person who is the All, whatever has come into existence and what is to be,17 is, however, at the same time elaborated with reference to the microcosmos, to ani­mate nature: He dwells in the hidden interior (i.e. the ‘heart’) of all beings and is their antarätman, their inner Self (3, 11 ; 6, 11). W ith regard to men this God, who ‘has been bom and will be born’ (2, 16), shows three aspects of his nature: He has created all beings, protects them, and at the end of time, He absorbs them completely (3, 2). To denote this Supreme Being, the sovereign position and absolute charac­ter of which are described in the last chapter of his exposition, the author resorts to a great variety of epithets and characterizations: ‘Him who is the Supreme Lord of lords, and who is the supreme deity of deities and the supreme master of masters, transcendent, him let us know as God, the lord of the world, the adorable’ (6, 7). But, I already had the opportunity to say that one term, Uätia, and its relatives fia and mahdvara ‘the one who has power, who rules or is the Master’, come decidedly to the fore.18Yet this important attempt at harmonizing in a great synthesis the main themes and theories connected with the divine essence under­lying the phenomenal world— Purusa, Brahman, Prajapati, etc.19— this teaching of a personal god who is the creator, preserver and de­stroyer of all phenomenal existence does not preach a God who is above the world of myth. This Isvara might be an abstract idea or figure hardly accessible to the hearts and the minds of the masses, the author could ill afford to do without the imagery, popular belief20 and mythical thought of his Sivaite tradition, and his God plays a part in20 THE GODS’ RISE TO SUPERIORITY"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"mythology, though on a more exalted level.21 God is not only the Lord, but— despite his being the origin of the devas (3, 4)— also a deva himself (4, 13; 16; 6, 7; 11) and, moreover, that particular god who in the popular worship was traditionally known as Hara, Rudra, Siva,22 that is to say, though higher,23 He is at the same time a god who bears a proper name and is characterized by functions and attributes of his own,24 a deity whose wrath is feared and averted by a prayer borrowed from Vcdic texts: ‘Do not injure us in life and offspring, do not slay our men in anger!’25It is time now to institute a summary comparison between this oldest document of rising Sivaism and that famous ancient Gospel of Visnuism, the Bhagavadgïtâ.261 need not, to begin with, dwell on the well-known fact that both poems must have been compiled in those circles which, finding no satisfaction in Vedic ritualism,27 sought after bliss and sal­vation through the help of a personal God. Both poems also agree in their ideas of the Highest Being28 and in the conviction that God’s help can only be obtained by him who knows Him truly, that is who mentally and spiritually realizes his identity with Him: says the Svetasvatara (1, 11): ‘By knowing God there is a falling off of all fetters’ (i, 11):29 ‘only by knowing him one passes over death’ (6, 15) and the Gita: ‘as a knower of Brahman established in Brahman’ (5, 20) and ‘having come to know Me (Krsna) in truth, one forthwith enters into M e’ (18, 55), that means: ‘one is not bom again’ (4, 9).30 Both works are also agreed that in this world nobody, or hardly any­one, knows God, who himself knows what is to be known.31Mere knowledge, however, does not suffice.32 In a stanza which Svetasvatara’s discourse has in common with two other ancient works it is expressly stated that only through the grace (jprasäda) of the creator one sees the Lord and His majesty and becomes free from sorrow.33 The views of the Gita are clearly expressed in its last chapter: ‘In Him alone seek refuge with all your being; by His grace you will win peace supreme, the eternal “ abode” ’ 34 But there are some conditions for receiving Svetasvatara’s doctrine, and one of these is that the adept must be a man of extreme love-and-devotion35 for God and for his spiritual teacher as for God (6, 23). The term bhakti itself,36 denoting an affective ‘participation’ of the soul in the divine, occurs, probably,37 here for the first time, and it is certainly not permissible to view its context through the spectacles of the adherents of the bhakti move­ments of later times, when the idea had been widely propagated andTHE GODS’ RISE TO SUPERIORITY 21"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"had come to manifest itself in various aspects. Nor can wc, relying on the argumentum e silentio, be sure that the idea and the religious attitude for which the term stands are non-Vedic in origin.38 W e should rather consider the probability of the existence of bhakti39-\\ikc currents o f religiosity within the fold of Aryan antiquity and of their failing, for a long time, to receive the recognition of those leading brahmans who preferred to perfect and to systematize the ritual aspects of ancient Aryan religion.40 It cannot be denied that every cult of a personal god may involve some form of bhakti and we are certainly justified in searching41 Vedic literature for anticipations of post-Vedic devotion- alism.Dismissing, however, this question of origin it must be emphasized that the bhakti idea, though emerging in Svctäsvatara’s poem, occupies a much more important place in the Bhagavadgïtâ. Bhakti is, in the Gita, one of the three ways to salvation and it is, moreover, the way for which the author feels a growing sympathy. By undivided de­votion God can be known, seen and ‘entered into’,42 but here also a prospect of variant ways to the goal is held out: the emergence of the identificatory knowledge of God’s nature may also precede the de­votion and make it possible.43 Or jiïâna and bhakti may have the same effect, viz. the annihilation of all karman44 and the obtainment of eternal peace.45 Anyhow it is clear that then already— that is, about the Illrd or Und century B.C.—bhakti was better adapted to a Visnuite back­ground, of which it was to remain a very distinctive feature, no doubt because in the Gita the central position of Krsna himself as the teacher and his continual references to his divinity and to his willingness to help and save those who approach him devotedly were much more fitted to appeal to the hearer’s emotions and to sustain the bhakti conceptions than the more abstract and impersonal teaching of Svctäs- vatara.For whereas Rudra-Siva is esoterically preached and his nature explained by an author who in a learned and elaborate argument tries to show that that god— whose figure remains invisible ($v U. 4, 20)— is the Supreme Being meant by the Vedic authorities,46 Krsna, de­claring that the Veda is no longer necessary for him who has attained the wisdom of the Supreme47 and revealing that by his pervasive power he is the most prominent representative of all concrete objects and phenomena,48 the light of the sun, the vital power of animate nature, appears— notwithstanding his identity with the impersonal Brahman4922 THE GODS’ RISE TO SUPERIORITY"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"— in the flesh and shows, in the famous epiphany of canto XI, his supreme form as Lord. Whereas, moreover, Svetäsvatara’s ascetic audience arc supposed to have in their relations with God almost no personal interests outside the victory over death, or the final release of all fetters, Krsna, professing the wide catholicity of his religion which is open to everybody,50 teaches several ways toward salvation adapted to various types of men,51 but emphasizes that the most preferable way consists in a combination of disinterested performance of one’s personal, social and religious duties52 in this world and faithful de­votion to God: ‘ He who does his work for Me (as a sacrifice to Me), who looks upon Me as his goal, who devotedly worships Me, free from attachment and from enmity to all creatures, he comes to Me.’53 This very phrase,54 which is repeated, suggests the possibility of com­munion with a loving personal God, to whom, according to Krsna’s own words (7, 17; 12, 20), his devotee is dear, and who, though beyond definition, unborn and eternal,55 supreme and all-pervading,56 though the incomprehensible transcendent origin and supporter of the universe as well as its dissolution,57 is easy of access; an object of rev­erence, impartial and ready to grant even the desires of those who worship other divine beings;58 a God who, while pre-eminently exalted, resides in the hearts of men and is willing to appear in an adorable human form which may even be the object of piijâ.59 A god, who, far from being inactive like Svetäsvatara’s ïsvara (ÉvU. 6, 19), to destroy the wicked and to protect the good assumes— through his own incomprehensible divine creative power, tnâyâ, an exhibition of this faculty, foreign to the Svetäsvatara60— a visible body from age to age, whenever there is a decline of dharma and rise of adharma:61 the first formulation of the avatära doctrine which has been an important source of Visnuite power and influence, enabling the faithful to combine a firm belief in Visnu, the personal aspect of Brahman, and worship of a saviour, and putting by its historical or supposedly historical occur­rences God’s love of the world and of mankind beyond doubt.62By demanding that his worshippers fulfil their duties and observe the general rules of moral conduct disinterestedly Lord Krsna success­fully bridged over the chasm between that ascetic morality, which for instance was propagated by the Buddhists, and Svetäsvatara’s one-sided accentuation of the ideal of final emancipation on the one hand and the exigencies of daily life63 on the other. To those who wished, or were obliged, to lead a socially and religiously normal life and whoTHE GODS* RISE TO SUPERIORITY 2]"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"had, for the sake of the maintenance of our human society (3, 20), to be active in this world, he gave a moral, a philosophy of life, and a pros­pect of final liberation. He also founded on the basis of Vaisnava religion what may be called social ethics, a subject foreign to the Svetâs- vatara: since God is, as their physical and psychical substratum, in all beings, sages see no difference between them; like God himself, one should be impartial and the same to friends and foes.64 Significantly enough, the devotee who, friendly and compassionate, and without ill will to any being, lives up to this ideal while fixing his mind on God is said to be most perfect in yoga.65 In contradistinction to the al­most classic type of yoga proclaimed by Svetäsvatara66 who emphasizes its technical aspects and automatic effects, Krsna, while stressing con­tinuous vigilance over body and mind and concentration on God or the Self as essential elements,67 preaches the karmayoga, which is a per­formance of duty characterized by self-control, balance of mind, and the abandonment of all attachment and desire of results.68Thus the Bhagavadgïtâ, while continuing and developing the doc­trine of an Isvara who is the goal of those seeking final emancipation,69 at the same time met the wishes of the masses which demanded a per­sonal God to worship. Unfortunately we possess no ancient records showing us in a pure form the development of popular religion, which the Gita presupposes and which was distinct from the more abstract and speculative thought of the early upanisads. This lacuna is the more regrettable as in the centuries preceding this document various cults and beliefs, presumably tending towards some more or less distinct form of monotheism, must have contributed to the rise of Visnuism. For whereas in the Svetäsvatara-Upanisad God, the Lord, is Rudra, also called Siva, who as such attracts a considerable part of the compiler’s attention, in comparable ancient works belonging to the Visnuite tradition— the MahäNäräyana Upanisad and the Bhagavadgïtâ— Visnu himself is only passingly mentioned, the divine persons occu­pying, especially in the latter text, a central position being Näräyana and Krsna, who only in the course of time came to fuse with the Vcdic Visnu.70 How these cults of Näräyana and that of the ill all probability tribal hero and deity Krsna-Väsudeva came to combine with that religious current which succeeded in raising Vcdic Visnu to the rank of the supreme deity is for lack of textual evidence not clear.71 Recently the opinion was expressed in connection with this insoluble problem72 that the three great figures were, due to fortuitous circumstances,24 THE gods’ rise to superiority"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"25raised to that high position and that ‘ thus as a matter of course they were equalized by a mysterious process of religious syncretism’. This how­ever leaves us where we were.Yet it would appear to me that a few factors in this process may, by way of hypothesis, be recovered, if only we would consider more closely some characteristics of early Visnuism which have not yet attracted the attention they deserve. These are in the first place the tendency to identify the various ideas of the Highest, which I propose to illustrate with the part played by the Purusa concept and, further, the functions of the god and the use and signification of some names and epithets attributed to him in pre-epic texts. As to the former, it is well known that in Rgvcda io, 9073 the phenomenally evolved universe is described as having issued from a primeval Person, Man (Purusa), whose origin is left unexplained and who, being co-extensive with the earth and even larger than that, is this All; one fourth of his is all beings and three quarters arc what is immortal in heaven.74 From this Person, the ultimate reality,— in whom God and matter are one, and who is the universe and transcends it— Viräj— grammatically feminine and literally the idea o f‘extending and ruling far and wide’— was bom, and from Viräj, being the hypostatization of the conception of the universe as a whole,75 as evolving, expanding and creative, and as such the inter­mediate between the primeval Purusa and the evolved Purusa— arose again the Purusa. This is no doubt a variant of the well-known idea of the bisexual primeval being. Then this Person became the victim or oblation in a primeval— and hence exemplary— sacrifice, performed by the gods. From his dissected body arose the particular elements of the phenomenal creation. The closing stanza76 under­lines, by way of resume, the fundamental ideas of the poem : the rite and the victim on the one hand and the one worshipped on the other are identical; this sacrifice is an opus operans and an opus operatimi;76 the powers which were generated in this way reach heaven.We must now dwell for a moment upon the use made in the course of time by teachers and other authorities of this Purusasiikta, which is the first expression of the idea that creation is the self-limitation of the transcendent Person manifesting himself in the realm of our experience. It is, to begin with, incorporated in those Vcdic texts which deal with the Purusamedha or human sacrifice.77 In contradistinction to other texts, which give this rite the character of a real human sacrifice, by which the sacrificer can reach that which is not reached by the horse3—v.s.THE GODS* RISE TO SUPERIORITY"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"sacrifice (ÉÉS. 16, io, i), the White Yajurveda, enjoining that the victims be released, describes it as a so-called symbolic rite (ÉB. 13,6, 2, 13).78 The author of the Satapatha-Brähmana extends the idea of the sükta (13, 6, 1, 1). Purusa, then already called Näräyana— who according to the ancient tradition79 is the inspired poet of the sükta— desired: ‘Would that I surpassed all beings! would that I alone were this All (idam sarvarn: the totality)’ ‘He beheld’, the text continues, ‘this five-days’ (päncarätram) sacrificial rite, the Purusamedha, and after having performed it, he surpassed all beings and became the Totality. The man who knowing this performs the Purusamedha, or who just knows this, surpasses all beings and becomes, i.e. realizes his identity with, the Totality of existence (idam sarvam)’. These ideas were not however completely new: the Purusa-Näräyana litany (as it is called ÉB. 13, 6, 2, 12) was also in other rites recited during the per­formance of acts intended to make the sacrificer attain a higher state of existence or to bring about his reintegration.80 Thus it is recited over the sacrificer of the Asvamedha81— which may have been the model of the Purusamedha82— at the moment of his unction, a ritual act in­tended to disintegrate and reintegrate the sacrificer and to mark his ‘rebirdi’ out of the sacrifice and his identification with the Cosmic Man.83 The sheet of gold which as part of this rite is placed on his head helps to make him surpass the normal human condition.84 The number of the stanzas of the sükta, sixteen, is essential, because Totality is, like Purusa himself, (ÉÉS. 16, 14, 16), sixteenfold (&B. 13, 6, 2, 12).85 For our subject the closing paragraph of this chapter of the Satapatha- Brähmana is not devoid of interest: the sacrificer should, after having placed his sacrificial fires into his own self— an act to be performed when one desired to embrace the career of an ascetic who no longer needs his fires— worship the sun with the Uttara-Näräyana litany, which in the Vajasaneyï-Samhitâ follows immediately on the Purusasükta,85 and then go to the forest not to return home. In this connection the com­mentary on the Kätyäyana-Srautasütra (21, 1, 17) speaks of an entrance into another stage of life : that means that the sacrificer now becomes a samnyäsin. The author of the Satapatha-Brähmana ends by saying that one should not impart the knowledge of this obviously esoteric ‘symbolical’ sacrifice to anyone, but only to one who is known and dear to the teacher and who is versed in the Veda. A much later docu­ment, the Mudgala-Upanisad, after explaining the Purusasükta, goes into more details: one should teach this secret knowledge only under26 THE gods’ RISE TO SUPERIORITY"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"27auspicious circumstances and to him who is a pupil. When one does so, the student as well as the teacher realize already in this existence their identity with the Purusa.A cosmogony is, in archaic thought, the exemplary model for crea­tion of every kind.87 The Purusasükta was for instance prescribed in a rite for obtaining a son,88 in bathing practices for that renewal which is called purification, and in the ceremonies performed in founding a temple which is constructed in the likeness of the Purusa.89 The text was intelligibly enough also repeated at sräddhas, rites for the benefit of the deceased. Part of our sources assert that after death the soul as­sumes what is called an ätiuähika sarïra consisting of only three of the five elements (viz. fire, wind and space) which enabled it, if the relative rites were duly performed, to bridge over the space between death and the formation of a new gross body in the following incarnation, which as appears from the use of this sükta was considered a renewal. The same virtue and potency of the text explains why it was deemed to purify a person of sins and why it was— and often still is— to be pronounced at the time of bathing: in both cases it was likewise to renew the person concerned, a fact in the latter case also underlined by the obligatory change of clothes. It is therefore perfectly clear that already at an early date and throughout the ages this text was, in religious practice not only an account of the creation but also an instrument of rising above one’s present state of existence. By identifying oneself with the mythical Purusa90 and by ritually repeating the mythical event and so re­activating its inherent power for the benefit of oneself and with a view to one’s own reintegration one believed oneself to achieve one’s own ‘rebirth’.91 The Purusa is, moreover, immolated and the sükta em­braces also the institution of sacrifice, which in the view of the Vedic ritualists is the counterpart and re-enactment of the great cosmic drama of integration and disintegration.92 In performing the sacrifice— which in the myth is the power or technique starting the process of creation— the priests set in motion the cosmic processes for the benefit of the sacrificer; and this benefit may even consist in a rebirth.There is much truth in Renou’s remark93 that this theme of the Purusa constitutes the principal link between the subject-matter of the Rgveda and that of the Atharvaveda in that most cosmological poems of the latter corpus contain some allusion to it. Not only was the Purusasükta, as 19, 6,94 incorporated in the Atharvaveda-Samhitâ, there is another hymn, likewise traditionally ascribed to Näräyana,95 viz. 10, 2, which.THE GODS’ RISE TO SUPERIORITY"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"28THE GODS RISE TO SUPERIORITYwhile describing the wonderful structure of the human body, actually deals also with the Purusa,96 with the important addition that this ‘body’ is the stronghold of Brahman (neuter) which has established heaven, earth and atmosphere. This same Brahman, ‘which governs both what is and what is to be, and the All and whose alone is heaven’ (AVÉ. io, 8, i) and which is also said to be in man (io, 7, 17) impresses us here as being another name or aspect of the frame of creation, the skambha or axis mundi,97 in which everything is contained. This frame, in which the creator god (10, 7, 8) Prajäpati fixed and sustained all the worlds and which with part of its being has entered creation (10, 7, 7 f.), is in its turn identical with the Purusa (10, 7, 15), and tends, in this same context, to fuse with that creator god,98 who is moreover said to be the lord of immortality (RV. 10, 9, 2; AV. 19, 6, 4: Jsuara) so that here the way is paved for that synthesis which was to be of fundamental importance for later Indian philosophical and theological thought.99Visnu docs not appear on the scene here, but it is worth recalling that the Satapatha-Brähmana is quite explicit in stating that Prajäpati in order to create offspring and the world imitated, that is identified himself with, Visnu, making this god’s three strides which we know to be a variant of the all-pervading idea expressed by the skambha.100 It is further, in the same brähmana, asserted that it is the Purusa who became Prajäpati,101 who is therefore with reference to Rgveda 10, 90, substituted for the former as the primeval victim offered by the gods (10, 2, 2, I f.). And we should, finally, remember that the same work — probably through the well-known process of identification of an historical or legendary founder of a religious movement with the god he preaches— gives the Purusa the name Näräyana.102This process is repeated. When, toward the close of the period represented by the brähmanas, thinkers and teachers were no longer satisfied with these speculations and attempted to formulate theories of their own with regard to the ulterior source of mundane life and existence, they were likewise inclined to defend the thesis that the personal God whom they wanted to regard as the Supreme Being or the idea they chose to be the world ground,103 was identical with the Purusa,104 the primeval Person, the adumbration of whose nature found in the Purusasükta is now expanded and developed.105 An in­teresting example is furnished by Svetäsvatara. It may be repeated here.106 After making (1, 2) the enquiry whether for instance time,"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"nature, destiny, chance or Purusa should be the cause of the universe107 and implying a negative answer in the following stanzas which inti­mate that the sole cause and power is a personal God, who is one and who appears to be identical with the Highest Brahman, the author declares that he knows that great Purusa who turns out to be the same as his god Rudra-Siva (3, 8 ff.). The same identification occurs— in a striking minority of cases, it is true— in the Mahäbhärata:108 ‘Thou art the Purusa, and Thou reSidest in the heart of everything.’ Turning now to those currents of thought which are collectively known as Visnuite the first document to arrest our attention is the Mahä-Näräyana-Upanisad,109 a breviary for samnyäsins incorporating a considerable number of quotations from older works. This âranyaka- like manual, which may have been compiled approximately in the Illrd century B.C.,110 can be considered an attempt at harmonizing the ascetic and the ritual way of religious life and a device for receiving the anchorites into the fold of the brahmanical, so-called orthodox com­munity. In its central section (st. 201-269) it praises Näräyana as the Absolute. The origin of this figure, whose name we have already had occasion to mention several times, is shrouded in mystery.111 It would be an attractive, but unwarranted supposition to regard the picture of his asceticism and his hermitage on the Ganges112 as reminiscent of historical facts.113 Be that as it may, the upanisad under consideration114 glorifies him as the Supreme Lord of the Universe, Brahman, the Eternal, Prajäpati, the Highest Light, which on the other hand is also Visnu. He is also the Purusa,115 who fills the whole universe, is in the brilliant light of the sun, is identical with Order (rtam), Reality- and-truth (satyam), the highest Brahman and may assume every form. From tliis Purusa116 have arisen all divisions of time, setofids; minutes, hours, days and nights, seasons and year, and it is He, who produces water, space and the heavens. It is not possible to see, grasp or control him.117 Besides, the Purusa is not different from the Ätman and is compared to a tree which is fixed in heaven, that is, no doubt, again, the skambha.118 This Purusa is also addressed as if he were a divine person, given epithets elsewhere applied to deities, and implored to deliver those speaking from every impurity, pride and latent conditions or affections of the soul.119 Those who, like the author himself, know him become immortal,120 and the only way leading to this knowledge of the Highest, which is the only mode of access to immortality, is that of vision and introspection.

The first words of this eulogy ‘He is eternal, undecaying, imperishable, immeasurable, omnipresent’ are explained by the commentator Nilakantha as follows: ‘He is the Purusa, because of the attribute of fulness; eternal, because he has neither beginning nor end; undecaying, because there is no change in him; imperishable, because he has no body which may be subject to30 THE GODS* RISE TO SUPERIORITY"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"31decay; immeasurable, because mind and speech cannot conceive of him in his fulness; omnipresent, because he is the material cause of all.’137Dismissing for a moment Nârâyana we now come to Krsna. The most seminal of all Visnuite scriptures, the Bhagavadgita— in harmony with its central doctrine, viz. the identity of Krsna-Vasudeva with the All (sarvam, i.e. Totality: 7, 19) implying that he is Brahman— does not omit to emphasize that Krsna is the Isvara138 and one with the Purusa.139 The man who seeks final emancipation must meditatively know Krsna to be the supreme celestial Person and through this know­ledge and exclusive bhakti realize his identity with that Person, by which the All is pervaded and supported and in which all beings abide.140 This is another soteriological application of the ancient idea: spiritual identification with the Primeval Being which is the ultimate reality means the attainment of a new ‘ birth’ in casa final liberation. The identi­fication of ideas and aspects of the indescribable continues. Although in no place does Krsna himself explicitly claim to be Visnu, all the rsis are quoted as declaring him to be ‘ the Highest Brahman, the supreme manifestation of divine essence, the purifying power par excellence, the eternal celestial Purusa, the unborn universal ruler.. .’,141 and for all practical purposes that Purusa is one with Krsna’s highest dilaniati, i.e. with God’s very Presence to which the devout worshipper may go without returning.142 Other places in the Mahäbhärata agree with the Gita in considering Krsna the eternal Purusa, the ungenerated self- existent One (Svayambhti).143Interestingly enough the same identification takes place with regard to Visnu, and the same phrases which, in expressing the identity, are used in connection with Krsna may apply to him: the (high) Purusa of olden times,144 pur anali Purusah, etc. Thus Visnu is the primeval Purusa,145 and as such he is also the eternal and omnipresent Brahman, sat and asat, and above sat and asat. And now the conclusion is drawn that Krsna is the unborn primal god Visnu Purusa.146 Visnu with the thousand heads (the initial epithet of the Purusasukta) is incarnate as Krsna,147 who is described as bearing the conch-shell, the discus and the club.148It is indeed not surprising that this representative of the All was already at a much earlier date associated with the pervader of the universe, that other representative of the Totality, Visnu. At a given moment of the Asvamedha rites some of the priests engage in a conversation of theTHE GODS’ RISE TO SUPERIORITY"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"32 the gods’ rise to superioritybrahmedya type, that is they propound to each other, as part o f the rite, riddles on cosmogonic, cosmologie, metaphysical and ritualistic subjects, a well-known device to penetrate the mysteries of the un­known and thus to generate and liberate power and to get a hold on the potencies which are the subject of the riddles.149 Among the ques­tions posed are, in close succession: ‘Has Visnu entered the whole universe?’150 and ‘Into what has the Purusa entered— the same verb (<âvivesa) is used— and what is established in the Purusa ?’ This very idea of ‘entering the All’, that is of being the Totality, sh'rcd by both Visnu and the Purusa, and the strong appeal made by the idea o f rein­tegration and hence emancipation through sacrifice151 has no doubt largely contributed to the fact that in the course of time the Visnuites came to emphasize that which their god and the Purusa had in com­mon and to transfer to the former what the Veda ascribed to the latter: according to a puränic account of the creation of the universe152 it was Visnu who emanated Viräj, and Viräj who produced the Purusa.Thus this summary study of the Purusa concept153— which could be followed up by investigations into the history of other ideas, names and epithets which eventually came to merge in the great figure of Visnu154 — reveals to us part of the gradual and intricate processes by which Krsna, Näräyana and other representatives of the Supreme Being came to draw near to each other and to Visnu. The Mahäbhärata does not show us the last stage of this development. Though pervading this epic as a general attitude in an ever-shifting manner, Visnuism is not yet a well-defined religious doctrine; the term Vaisnava is not em­ployed, but Visnu himself is becoming the powerful, yet benevolent loving and lovable deity, the centre of personal worship and devotion, the extemalization of religious and philosophical ideas also contained in myths and legends. The Rämäyana, while giving us important information, not on the growth of Visnuism as a whole, but rather on that aspect of it which may be called Rämaism,155 likewise insists on declaring the Purusa one with Visnu. Thus queen Kausalyä is stated to have meditated on the Purusa who was Janärdana,155 a name already in the other epic very often given to Krsna (Visnu-Janärdana).It may be added that the content of the Purusasükta which, in the course of time, was, so to say, made the foundation stone of Visnuite philosophy, continued to engage the attention of its exponents,157 although it must— to avoid misunderstanding— be added that the Sivaite tradition continued quoting this text also.158 Thus— to mention"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"33some random examples159— when in the Xth century, Yamuna made an attempt to prove the supremacy of Visnu he also asserted his identity with the Mahäpurusa of the Purusasükta, the essence of the Vedas.160 Quotations from this hymn are regularly found in arguments to explain the nature of the Supreme Being and to assure adherents of the possi­bility of attaining the Supreme Place, the firmament where are the gods, of RV. io, 90, 16, and which is regarded as identical with Visnu’s highest place.161In their sütra text— a late document, dating perhaps from the IVth century A.D.— the Visnuite Vaikhänasas— according to whom Närä- yana is the Highest Brahman to be reached by meditation and concen­tration162— prescribe the use of the sukta in a bali offering to that deity who is explicitly called the god with a thousand heads, the highest Purusa, the highest Brahman (parata brahma), etc. and the cause of all, whose soul (attuati) is the sacrifice (10, 10).

There were religious practices and the ideas of God fostered by the masses and by the learned; there were the peculiar traditions and convictions with regard to the Highest Being of Sivaites and Visnuites; there were, already in the beginning of the Christian era, the composite figures of Visnu and Siva themselves with their aspects and manifestations, their relations and attendants, there were cults and religions which came to fuse with the two great currents; there were the philosophical schools, which, tending to differentiate and growing in importance, explained the relation between the One and the many or the structure and evolution of the world and taught a way of salvation; there also was the innate Indian desire for systematiza­tion. Both communities shouldered the task and faced its risks and difficulties, both undertook to establish a system, a theology, an explanation of the world and a coherent and acceptable account of man’s relations with God. Both, however, proceeded on their own lines, clinging to their own traditions and emphasizing their own particular beliefs and doctrines. It will be relevant to survey here some"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"THEOLOGYof their theories to compare the outcome of their endeavour as it was incorporated in the purânas.Puränic Sivaism2 is, to begin with, characterized by the doctrines of God’s five manifestations or so-called faces (pancavaktra) and that of his eight forms or embodiments (astamiirti). The five manifestations are ïsâna, Tatpurusa, Aghora, Vamadeva, Sadyojäta. His eight embodi­ments are the five elements, sun, moon and sacrificer, to each of which corresponds one of his traditional names, Sarva, Bhava, and so on.Now there is one point which is too obvious to be left out of further consideration. It concerns the name ïsâna which is the only one which occurs among the eight mürtis as well as the five ‘faces’. This is not all. ïsâna is also one of the eight lokapälas or dikpâîas, the regents or guar­dians of the quarters of the sky or, rather, regions of the universe. It may be remembered that the participle ïsâna ‘ the ruling one, the master’ was already in early times, in the Rgveda, often used to denote the one who has authority,3 who is mighty or wields power4 over, for instance, wealth, the world, ‘immortality’. At first this word was as a charac­terization applied to various gods (Indra, Varuna, Mitra, Dhâtar, etc.), but from the Atharvaveda-Samhitâ (15, 5, 2) and the Taittiriya- Brâhmana (1, 5, 5, 2) it regularly appears also without a genitive to qualify as a substantive an individual god: ‘the Lord, the Master’.5 The compiler of the Brhadâranyaka-Upanisad6 interestingly enough uses it, on the one hand, to indicate the supreme Lord of what has come into existence and what is to be, by knowing whom one becomes immortal, who is the maker and the creator, whose is the world and who is the world, and on the other hand, as the last of a group of eight to which belong also Indra, Varuna, Soma, Rudra, Parjanya, Yama and Mrtyu. In the Buddhist canon7 ïsâna is, together with Indra, Soma, Varuna, Prajâpati, Brahmä, Mahiddhi8 and Yama, mentioned again as one of the chief devas. The name was adopted by the author of the Svetâsvatara-Upanisad to characterize the Supreme God,9 that is Rudra-Siva, as the Lord, the universal authority (prabhu), and the firm refuge (saranam bfhat) of all, the goal of those who seek final emanci­pation. Although the name was, for instance in the Mahâbhârata,10 given to Visnu or to the Supreme Being in general, it became especially favourite in Sivaite circles to designate their God.11 It may paren­thetically be recalled that the title bhagavän, i.e. ‘the one who is rich in bhaga “ dignity, excellence, majesty, loveliness, etc.” ’, translated by ‘the Holy or Adorable One, the Blessed Lord’, though sometimes used35"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"THEOLOGYin connection with Siva,12 was very often preferred by the Visnuites— in the Visnu-Purâna, for instance, Bhagavân is always Krsna-Visnu— to be constantly employed in later days by the adherents of the school of bhakti to describe the Supreme God of their devotion.13 ïsâna— whose name may often have been used for reasons of taboo or euphe­mism— must, in the Sivaite sphere it is true, have led also a semi-inde­pendent existence, because he was, as we shall see further on, with two other figures of Sivaite affiliation, regarded as his wife and, probably, his son, the object of a popular rite described in the Âpastambïya- Grhyasütra.14 Judging from the infrequency of his iconic representa­tions15 he does not however seem to have played in Hinduism an important part as an individual god.It is not clear whether, or how far, the above groups of eight gods were, or could be, associated with the regions of the universe. There is on the other hand no doubt whatever that these regions were in pre- purânic times also believed to be under the protection of a group of eight (or ten) gods which did not include ïsâna; in a description o f the Vedic rites connected with the building of a house (västusamana) mention is, for instance, made of ‘ ten ^//-offerings to be given to the regents of the ten regions (disah), namely Indra (in the East), Vayu, Yama, the Pitarah, Varuna, Maharaja, Soma, Mahendra (North-East), Väsuki (the nadir) and Brahma (in the zenith)’.16 In Manu 5, 96 these gods are17 Indra, the Wind, Yama, the Sun, Agni, Varuna, the Moon, Ruberà.18 Anyhow, the group of these great devas of the early epic literature was open to variation19 and in the well-developed puranic mythology Nirrti or Virüpäksa and ïsâna are substituted for Sürya and Candra. However, the name ïsâna may also be replaced by Siva’s other names Rudra or Sankara.20 The increasing popularity of this god has no doubt enabled his aspect ïsâna to oust one of the old devas from that quarter of the universe which is next to his traditional region, the North.The lokapâla ïsâna, the regent of the North-East, is an ambiguous figure. Sometimes he is with lois colleagues represented as a worshipper of Siva: ‘Thou that, in every quarter of the sky, art worshipped by Yama, Agni, Rudra ( = ïsâna) and so on’21 and in various rites he is, like the other ritually very important22 guardians of the regions, in­voked and adored with flowers and incense.23 Ritualists, monographers and theologians did not on the other hand lose sight of his identity with the Great God himself and so they gave him diva’s bull as a36"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"THEOLOGY37mount,24 endowed him with such iconographie features as the three eyes, the matted hair, the tiger-skin garment, the trident25 and the alms-bowl,26 or described his image as Gaurl-Sarva, that is Siva Ardhanârïsvara.27 His identity with Siva is also apparent from the occasional presence of Visnu on the left and Brahma on the right side of his image,28 or, as already observed, from the occasional inter­changeability of his name and other names of the god, Sambhu, Rudra, Isvara, etc.29 It is interesting to recall that the younger version of the mantras pronounced in adoring the lokapälas is modelled upon the ancient30 so-called Rudragâyatrï (tatpurusäya vidmahe, madädeväya dhtmahi, tan no rudrah pracodayät). The mantra addressed to ïsâna, to mention only this, runs as follows: sarvesvaräya vidmahe, sülahastäya dliimahi, tan no rudrah pracodayät,31 which may approximately be trans­lated ‘We know the Great Lord, we meditate on him who has the trident in hand, that Rudra (will) inspire (stimulate) us !’32It remained however always possible to group these deities— usually in the same order, beginning with Indra (in the East)— together without express mention of the fact that they are regarded as lokapälas.33 ïsâna might, moreover, also in later times belong to other groups of gods. He probably owed this honour to a certain continuing popularity34 which may also account for his occurrence in a number of myths in which— being distinct from Siva— he is said to join other gpds, for instance in praising new-born Nandin, Siva’s bull, in accompanying Siva marching against Tripura, in being Virabhadra’s victim on the occasion of Daksa’s sacrifice.35 That he plays, in these tales, a subordi­nate part docs not prove that he was in religious practice a pale and insignificant figure.36 The other gods (Yama, Agni, Kubera, etc.) do not play, in these narratives, a more prominent part.37Hence, no doubt, also the possibility of substituting in certain rites part of the lokapälas by other manifestations of Siva. Thus the Linga- Puräna describing the jayäbhiseka or ‘unction for victory’38 mentions a series of oblations, successively destined, not for Indra, Yama, Varuna, Kubera, but for Siva’s five manifestations.Now, ïsâna belonged already in the Atharvaveda to a group of obviously popular divinities which may be regarded as embodiments,39 or rather doubles,40 of Rudra, or as partial manifestations of his essence.41 In any case the statement (15, 5, 1, etc.) that neither Sarva, nor Bhava, nor ïsâna injures the man, his cattle or his fellows, who has acquired a certain knowledge impresses us as a reference to a distribution of"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"THEOLOGYidentical or similar divine power over three manifestations:42 as is well known, many ancient texts are, according to the views prevailing in a definite context, to the predominant religious convictions or to the exigences of some ritual argumentation, inclined to what might be called either synthetic or analytic representation of the same divine reality or power complex. Interestingly enough the same Atharvanic text does not only mention more aspects of this divine concept, but also correlates them with the regions of the universe: Bhava with the East, Sarva with the South— notice that the sequence o f the regions is in the pradaksina-order43— Pasupati with the West, Ugra44 with the North, Rudra with the dhruvä dik, i.e. the fixed central region,45 Mahädeva with the upward quarter, and ïsâna with all the quarters. Here already, ïsâna is the last and obviously the most important of the group because representing all the regions he seems to unite in himself the functions of his ‘colleagues’.46 The text under consideration ex­hibits one of those well-known sequences of the quarters o f the sky which— whether or not in connection with deities47— play a very important part in religious practice.48 The man who duly pronounces a sequence of stanzas addressed to the quarters while performing a pradaksina ensures their protection either for himself or for some ob­ject.49 An invocation of the quarters— which in their totality represent the whole of the universe— may also induce them to co-operate in propitiation, homage or reverential salutation:50 they are in a way made submissive to the person speaking or the officiant and willing to guarantee him, so to say, an unlimited ‘horizon’ or expanse. The sacri- ficer may also win them in order to master the whole of the universe with respect to space.51There is no point in entering into more particulars. The importance of the regions and their relevance to our theme are immediately ap­parent.52 I for me am inclined to consider the tetradic organization of the universe to have been, in the Indian classificatory systems under consideration, of fundamental significance, in any case more funda­mental than a system of principal colours to which Willibald Kirfel was inclined to attach, in this connection, greater importance.53However, there are in the Veda groupings of divine names in which the points of the compass play no part whatever. An interesting passage in the Kausîtaki-Brâhmana (6, 1 ff.), dealing with the creative activity of Prajâpati, a new-born divine being— of a thousand eyes and a thousand feet, and arisen from the seed of Prajâpati’s children Agni,38"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"theologyVäyu, Äditya and Candramas— is eight times— notice this number !— in succession given a name and these names are every time correlated with one of the provinces of nature or other important entities. The first name given is Bhava, and the waters are said to be Bhava, the second Sarva and the fire is Sarva; in a similar way are paired Pasupati — again another name of Rudra-Siva— and the wind (Väyu), Ugra and the vegetable kingdom,54 Mahan Deva (‘the Great God’) and the sun (Äditya), Rudra and the moon, Tsana and food, Asani (the Flash of lightning) and Indra. The closing words of the pcricope are especially interesting : This is the great god of eight names, distributed eightfold.55 And as this system of correlations and identifications pursues a prac­tical purpose, the author assures his audience that the offspring of the man who knows and understands what has been said will up to the eighth generation be secure from lack of food. A similar statement was contained in each of the preceding paragraphs: Bhava, Sarva, etc., will not do harm. The coincidence of the possession of food in the last paragraph and the identity of Tsana and food are anyway remarkable. This passage puts the belief, of definite ritualistic circles of about 400 B.C. or perhaps earlier,56 in the eightfold character and eightfold dis­tribution of the divine complex called Rudra-Siva beyond question. I cannot suppress the occurrence of a parallel version in the Satapatha57 in which not only the order of the names, but also all identifications are different.58 Here Tsana, being the sun, ‘who rules over this All’, is the last of the group.59 Besides, the text speaks of the eight forms of Agni, who obviously is identified with Rudra.60This is not the only enumeration of the god’s eight aspects.61 In a description of the Siilagava a series of invocations is addressed to Bhava, Rudra, Sarva, Tsana, Pasupati, Ugra, Bhlma and the Mahän Deva (sic), ‘the Great God’.62 Another grhyasütra63 however furnishes us in this connection with twelve names, adding that six formulas, or even one, viz. rudrâya svâhâ, may suffice. The names, followed by the exclamation suähä are: Hara, Mrda, Sarva, Siva, Bhava, Mahädeva, Ugra, Bhlma, Pasupati, Rudra, Sankara, Tsana. Six names (Bhava, Sarva, Tsana, Tsvara, Pasupati, Adhipati) are mentioned in the sutra of the Käthakas.64 Another authority, Päraskara,65 however enjoins those who perform this so-called spit-ox sacrifice to offer to nine mani­festations of Rudra-Siva, the first of which is Agni,66 the last again Tsana; Bhima of the list of eight names is now— as in the Satapatha- Brähmana— replaced by Asani.67 As Päraskara’s list differs from that39"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"THEOLOGYoccurring in the Satapatha only in having Agni at the beginning,68 this sequence may have enjoyed a certain popularity in those circles which followed the White Yajurveda.69Three points are worth noticing. First, the name of Isäna is in these invocations never omitted. In the second place: the different version of the rite handed down by the Äpastambins70 comprises an oblation to Tsäna and Ksetrapati ‘the lord of the field, i.e. the tutelary deity of the soil’ and special acts of worship of these two gods.71 Lastly, the name Tsana72 is more than other names of the god connected with this rite because it is also called Tsänabali,73 that means an offering or propi­tiatory oblation of portions of food of a popular character in honour of Tsäna.74 These facts corroborate us in our view that Tsana must have been a figure of no mean importance in popular religion. He was al­ready at an early date the object of a cult which then already was characterized by some ‘Hinduist’ features,75 but succeeded in gaining admittance to the ritual handbooks of the brahmans. The sülagava is even described in the Sänkhäyana-Srautasütra,76 where the series of divine names accompanying the oblations is interestingly enough identical with the name given, according to the allied brähmana, by Prajäpati to the young god who had arisen from the seed of Agni, etc.77 Whereas we may78 to a certain extent explain the occurrence of the rite in this sütr,a from the incorporation of the names in the brähmana, it seems on the other hand warranted to suppose that the author of the brähmana had borrowed these names and the order in which they occur from an eightfold rite.The eight names of Siva and their correlations with some elements, sun, moon, etc.79 moreover, recur— not without some variation, it is true— in the epic and puränic systems of Siva astamiirti to which we shall turn now.80 In the Linga-Puräna the order of the god’s embodiments usually is: earth, water, fire, wind (i.e. the air), space, sun, moon and sacrificer, the last being also called diksita (‘the consecrated one’), ätnum, or otherwise.81 When his eight names are correlated with these manifestations, the earth usually82 goes with £arva, water with Bhava, fire with Rudra, the air with Ugra, space with Bhima, the sun with Tsana, the moon with Mahädeva, the yajamâna with Pasupati ; that means that this puranic system has only one identification (Bhava = water) in common with the Kausïtaki-Brâhmana, but four with the Sata­patha : Rudra is fire, Ugra is air or wind, Mahädeva is the moon, Tsana the sun.40"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"THEOLOGY41I cannot discuss the other identifications and systematizations added to and grafted upon these names and embodiments by Sivaite specula­tion. Let it suffice to say that the five elements as names and embodiments of the god arc also held to compose the different coverings of the huge egg (brahmända) which is our universe83 and that these five are com­pleted with three other concepts which according to the Sämkhya theory have not only a share in the evolution84 of the universe but also in its constitution: ahamkära, i.e. Mahesvara, buddhi, i.e. Isa (Isäna), and Paramcsvara who, taking Pasupati’s place, obviously represents the prakrti (also ananta or tnahad avyakta) which constitutes the outermost sheath.85 As Astamiirti— the occurrence in the Mahäbhärata 3, 46, 26 is only a variant of slight importance— Siva fulfils all functions which belong to these eight realities or constituents. The world is a product of his eight forms, it consists of them, and can only exist and fulfil its task because these forms co-operate.86 Since also the microcosmos of our own body is composed of the same five elements and the three other realities the god Siva is believed to make up, in eightfold manifesta­tion, the corporeal frame and the psychical organism of every living being.87 Any being is identical with God,88 who as Sarva is his bones, etc., as Rudra is the light of his eyes which is connected with the sun, as Mahädcva his manas (‘mind’ or, rather, the co-ordinating and directive central organ) which is related to the moon: no doubt a reminiscence of the Purusa myth: the moon arose from his manas, the sun from his eye.89 The eighth constituent is the attuati which, being the sacrificer, is as indispensable ah element as the seven other constituents:90 the cosmic processes are indeed performed by the gods who really are Siva’s faculties (his vibliütis or divine powers), and these gods are sus­tained by the divine rites as plants by regular watering.91It is, to conclude with, sufficiently clear that Sivaite speculation, utilizing elements of an ancient cosmogonical myth and guided by the influential Sämkhya theory of the evolution of the world and the cos­mic processes, had remodelled the ancient idea of God’s eight aspects distributed over the whole universe into a system of His eightfold manifestation, presence and activity which at the same time expressed the fundamental truth that God and the world are one. In mytho­logical imagery the puränic tale92 of the divine boy who being bom to Prajäpati’s successor Brahma, cries93 because he wants to have a name and then after having been called Rudra receives seven other names in addition may be regarded as the parallel continuation of this theory.4—v.s."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"THEOLOGYBrahma gave him also stations94 for these eight aspects of his being, viz. sun, water, earth, etc., and, in addition to these, wives and sons.95The quarters of the universe are no clement of this puränic system of correlations. Nor does the astamürti play a prominent part in the cult. These two facts may be put in relation with each other.96 In a little known rite, the ‘Gift of the eight Rudras’,97 these manifestations of Siva are, in order to receive the oblations accruing to them, placed in a square to the East, South-East, South, etc., of Brahma who occupies the central place. That there also was a tendency to amplify the cor­relative system may appear from the adaptation to which the ancient mantras handed down in Hiranyakesin’s Grhyasütra98 were subjected: to the Vedic formulas bhaväya deväya svähä correspond in the Linga- Purâna:99 Om bhava jalam me gopäya jihväyäm rasant, bhaväya deväya bhuvo tiarnah ‘Om, Bhava, protect for me the water, the taste in my tongue; adoration to the god Bhava, bhuvah adoration’.100 (As is well known, water is supposed to convey the flavour of things.101Siva’s five ‘faces’102 are, unlike the eight embodiments, of great ritual significance. Attention should first be paid to the names o f these five aspects: Sadyojâta, Vamadcva, Aghora, Tatpurusa and, again as the last, ïsâna whose special importance is notable in this assemblage of divine figures also. It is true that their origin is wrapped in darkness, that they do not occur in the Mahäbhärata and that their oldest occurrence in the tenth book of the Taittiriya-Äranyaka, that is the Mahâ-Nârâyana-Upanisad,103 is of uncertain date (Illrd century B.C.).104 Yet it is sufficiently clear that this oldest occurrence constitutes a series of formulas addressed, in a fixed order, to Siva. In later times these were called the panca suvaktramanträh ‘the formulas of (Siva’s) five auspicious faces’.105 They are to be pronounced in a low voice in order to promote a devotee’s meditation and to produce (higher) knowledge.106In the first formula the devotee takes refuge with Sadyojâta ‘ the New-born’,107 paying homage to him who is the origin o f all existence.108 This Sadyojâta109 mantra occurs110 also in Atharvavcda- Parisista 20, 6, 1 as a part of a collection of formulas to accompany a ceremony in honour of Skanda. It is immediately followed by a stanza mentioning the names Skanda and Kumâra.111 According to the Linga-Purâna Siva (also called Vamadcva) was as a boy (Kumâra) in each world-age born from Brahmâ.112 Is it too bold an assumption that the Sadyojâta originally was a boy god, or even the boy god42"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"THEOLOGYSkanda Kumära who is already mentioned in the Chändogya-Upanisad (7, 26, 2),113 and who is the embodiment of one of the characteristic traits of Siva himself, accordingly to become, in the course of time, the great god’s son ?It is difficult to decide whether the second person is historically re­lated to the r?i Vamadeva who is credited with the authorship of the fourth mandala of the Rgveda.114 It seems in any case worth recalling that the name of this seer is in the Vedic tradition not only connected with Vedic stanzas115 or with the origin of definite elements of the ritual,116 but also with the supernormal vision of so-called worlds (loka).117 He is moreover related to have possessed knowledge before birth:118 ‘Being yet in embryo, I knew well all the births (origins, races) of these gods’,119 and to have become awakened to the insight that he was Brahman and, hence, the All,120 and so to have started a poem: ‘I was Manu and the Sun’.121 O f greater interest is that he is associated with the southern region from which he is invited to protect a definite sacrifice;122 that he was believed to be able to protect ‘all this’ from evil,123 the gods calling him who is life-breath Vamadeva, and further that he is explicitly identified with Prajâpati.124 If these facts might suffice to found the hypothesis that this figure was, under circumstances hidden from us, sivaized or adopted by Sivaite circles, the in itself not insurmountable difficulty remains that the Mahä- bhärata knows him as a rsi who has wonderful swift steeds and appears in Indra’s palace,125 and that in the Rämäyana he functions at Rama’s court.126 In the Matsya-Puräna Vamadeva appears as Brahma’s son and as the author of the four classes of society, taking the place of the Purusa of Rgveda 10, 90,127 but here he is doubtless identical with Siva.128 Generally speaking the puränas continue to distinguish one or several ancient sages of this name from Vamadeva who is Siva.129O f the five figures composing the Pancavaktra Aghora is the most distinct and independent.130 His character manifests the uncanny traits of Siva’s nature: evil, diseases, death, punishment of sinful behaviour, and magical practices, but also their opposites, viz. fertility, recovery from illness, and deliverance of sins and evil are his main fields of activity.131 His figure also— though left unmentioned by the poets of the Mahäbhärata— may have arisen at a rather early date, probably as a hypostatization of that side of the god’s character which led the Indians also to prefer his name Siva. The adjective aghora indeed denotes the absence of, and restraint in, awful, terrific and violent action43"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"THEOLOGYand attitude and, hence, friendliness.132 In the Veda the god is, in the beginning of the Satarudriya litany, requested to look auspiciously on those praying with his kindly (siva), friendly or reassuring (aghora) body (tanu) which is most potent to heal.133 As is well known the noun tanti was used to denote a manifestation of a divinity, the self or idea of a divine person or sacred object conceived of as corporeal,134 and not rarely, in the plural, a god’s more or less hypostatized powers, faculties or qualities; a god may have a friendly and a terrific a Uva and a ghora, taml.135 The Vedic stanza referred to occurs also in the Svetäsvatara-Upanisad (3, 5) and may therefore be considered to have held the continuous attention of Sivaitc communities.136 It is worth observing that the third formula of the panca suvaktramanträh is properly speaking not addressed to the divine personality Aghora but to the reassuring and awful forms or manifestations of the god.137The curious name of Siva's fourth face Tatpurusa seems to owe its existence to a reinterpretation of a Sivaite138 variant of the Gâyatrî, viz. tat purusäya vidmahe tnahädeväya dhltuahi / tan no rudrah pracodayät139 which, amalgamating a reminiscence of the Purusa with the sacredness of that stanza and stating the devotee’s knowledge of the Purusa, expresses the intention to meditate on the Great God and the hope of divine inspiration and instigation. Apprehended as a compound the term may be translated by ‘Soul of the Universe’.140Now God’s five ‘faces’ were in the course of time made the central element of a comprehensive classificatory system. The five manifesta­tions were identified with parts of His body,141 with ontological prin­ciples, organs of sense and action, the subtle and gross elements,142 etc. Thus this system is an attempt at explaining Siva’s being the All, the universe, and the universe’s being exclusively composed of sides and manifestations of Siva. That means that each of Siva’s five faces cor­responds to, or is identical with, one of the components of the five groups which, in the Samkhyâ school of thought, constitute the twenty- five tattvas (principles or basic categories).143 In his fivefold nature Siva is therefore identical with the five times five elements of reality.144However, the idea underlying this system was not new. A brähmana already spoke of the five forms (tanti) of Prajäpati which are the hair on his face, the skin, the flesh, the bone, and the marrow; and the five which are mind (tnanas), voice, vital air, eye and ear; elsewhere it is observed that Prajäpati’s tanüs constitute the whole of this god,14544"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"THEOLOGY45who elsewhere is explicitly styled ‘fivefold’.146 This view of the creator god’s nature was also of great ritual significance. It provided the Vedic ritualists with a theoretical basis for the important and complicated Agnicayana rite, the so-called construction of the fire-place,147 which, consisting of the construction of five layers, is periodically to re-inte­grate Prajäpati, so that he will be able to continue his creative activity. It is expressly stated148 that the five tamis of the god are these five layers, and that, when the five layers are built up, the god himself is built up by those bodily parts. Moreover, Prajäpati being the All, and hence Totality with respect to time, is at the same time, as the year, built up with the five seasons, and these are in their turn identical with the five regions of the universe, so that the god is also built up with the regions. The system of correlations and identifications is extended by the incorporation of the five provinces of the universe (earth, atmos­phere, heaven and the two ‘intermediate regions’149 and the different parts of the body.Here the question arises why such a prominent place should, not only in this connection,150 have been given to the number five. A survey of the relevant Vedic texts cannot, in my opinion, fail to show, as already observed, the fundamental importance of the regions of the universe. The five directions— which in archaic thought means: the totality of the fourfold division of the universe151— are explicitly said to be distributed over all the gods,152 that is to say over the represen­tatives of the provinces and forces of the cosmos. It is the five direc­tions153 which are invoked to make a man king and an essential element in the ritual of the royal consecration is articulated on this number: the royal sacrificcr has to step in each of the five directions in order to appropriate the whole universe,154 and these directions are here again co-ordinated with other fivefold systems (the Vedic metres, the seasons, etc.). In short, the five regions, which constitute the world,155 may be supposed to have induced the ancient Indians to speak of the five parts of the earth and the ‘five peoples’156 to indicate the totality of the human communities distributed over the earth. Basing themselves on a principle of so-called numerical ‘symbolism’ the authors of these texts grouped and articulated not only the divisions of space157 and time (the quarters of the seasons,158 but also divine159 and ritual powers (metres, victims,160 gifts, arts, utensils or functionaries161 and the forces constituting the ‘social cosmos’162 on the number five.163 Part of these groups164 were already at an early date associated165 or even"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"THEOLOGYco-ordinated with each other.166 Such a co-ordination was explicitly- regarded as a union,167 or as an identity;166 or the identity in number implied transference of the characteristic nature of one of the groups of five169 to another. Very often a basic group of five170 in nature (regions, seasons) was to motivate or explain a ritual act or element characterized by the same number.171A complete survey of all relevant places would fill many pages; let it suffice to add that Vedic and upanisadic authors refer to a fivefold ritual address,172 to five prayers for prosperity,173 to five questions posed in succession174 and to an esoteric doctrine expounded under five heads;175 that they make mention of five openings for the gods in the heart correlating to sun, moon, fire, rain, space and functioning as the doorkeepers of the world of heaven.176 They assumed that Prajä- pati entered in the creatures which he had produced as five in number, viz. as the five vital breaths.177 They prescribed rites of a fivefold character and ritual acts to be executed five times in succession,178 consisting of five parallel acts accompanied by five similar mantras. And so they arrived, on the strength of the considerations that man’s completeness consists in his being fivefold— for man is composed of mind, speech, breath, eye and ear— and that sacrifice and cattle and the ‘person’ (purusa) are likewise fivefold, at the conclusion that ‘this All, whatever there is, is fivefold’.179 They also established a parallelism between the fivefold nature of the macrocosmos and the corresponding fivefold nature of the microcosmos: ‘Earth, atmosphere, heaven, the (main) quarters and the intermediate quarters ; fire, air, sun, moon and stars; water, plants, trees, space and the body, thus with regard to material existence; and with regard to the individual: the five vital breaths;180 sight, hearing, ‘mind’, speech, touch; skin, flesh, muscle, bone, marrow. Fivefold indeed, is this All, with the (individual) fivefold does one win the (cosmic) fivefold (i.e. the All).’181 W e should indeed be always aware of the fact that the ultimate aim of all these speculations was practical: ‘The pankti (a Vedic metre) is five-fold, the sacrifice .consists of five; so one reaches thereby (i.e. by the five-day’s rite) all what is fivefold, with regard to the deity and with regard to one’s self’;182 ‘He who knows (this doctrine of) these five fires thus is not stained with evil, even though consorting with those (wicked) people; he who knows this becomes pure, clean, possessor of a pure sphere of safety or state of bliss (loka)’.183 One might feel fortified in this view of the significance of the number five by the fact that some46"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"THEOLOGY47important categories in nature and in the human body— for instance, the ‘elements’, the sensory organs— are, or may be taken as, fivefold.184It is therefore easily intelligible that the author of the Svetäsvatara- Upanisad, whose influence upon the development of Sivaitc ideas is unmistakable, describes the Highest Being as a river of five streams, from five sources, whose waves are the five vital breaths, whose original source is fivefold perception-and-intelligcnce (huddhi), which has five whirlpools, an impetuous flood of fivefold misery, divided into five distresses and five joints. According to the traditional explanation the streams arc the five senses; the sources, the five elements; the waves, the five organs of action (or the five pränasi) ; the whirlpools, the ob­jects of sense; the fivefold misery, the successive painful stages of development: embryo, birth, old age, illness, death; the five distresses, the so-called kleêas, i.e. ignorance, egotism, desire, aversion, tenacity of mundane existences, the five joints being left unexplained. The simile speaks for itself : it is highly illustrative of a view of God and the world which considers prakrti (undifferentiated primordial material) to be the very nature of God and ascribes the categories and processes which characterize psycho-physical reality to Him who is at the same time believed to have brought forth the world substance out of His own being (6, io).It is therefore not surprising that pentads play also an important part in Sivaism185 and— as we shall see instantly— Visnuism.186 Thus Siva’s body consists, in a way which is beyond human intelligence, of the five mantras, the so-called panca brahmani ofTaittirïya-Âranyaka io, 43 ff.187 These mantras are in a vaiiety of ritual ceremonies used to accompany fivefold ritual acts. They may correspond to parts of God’s body which they by the very invocation create or evoke.188 Thus the Tsanamantra, in Hindu practice Horn ïiânamürdhne namahy correlates to His head, the Tatpurusamantra Hem Tatpurusavakträya uamah to his face, etc.189 They may correspond' to the five directions or also accompany a sequence of acts which do not seem to be related to God’s body or to the quarters of the universe.190 The five faces are moreover put in relation with five colours, Tsana being white or colourless,19 and, what is especially interesting, with God’s five functions.192 With his creative function, by which he provokes the evolution of the possibilities of the causa materialis of the universe, is in this system associated Sadyojäta; he maintains the world as Vamadeva, he re-absorbs it as Aghora; his power of obscuration— by which the souls are concealed in the"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"THEOLOGYphenomena of the samsara— is associated with Tatpurusa and he bestows his grace which leads to final emancipation as ïsâna.193These five functions'194 are an emanation from the Niskala, i.e. the formless or unmanifesting Siva who is the Highest Brahman of the Vedäntins. The identifications and co-ordinations do not indeed end here. The five faces are also known individually as Mahädeva (in the East), Bhairava (in the South), Nandivaktra (in the West), Umävaktra (in the North) and Sadasiva195 (also ïsâna, the fifth who is ‘on the top’).196 With the ‘five faces’, the firsf of which is ïsâna (isätiädayah) and which are collectively also known as the Pancabrahmas197 are, moreover, associated the five so-called Sâdâkhyas198 which have evolved from God’s fivefold sakti.199 In these Sâdâkhyas ‘dwells’ God in his aspect called Sadâsiva. I cannot dwell upon other pentads,200 for instance upon God’s attributes in the five right and five left hands of his Pancavaktra figure201 and upon the fivefold origin, in five diff­erent colours— ïsâna is omni-coloured— of the highly important Gâ- yatri mantra from this form of the god. I must also refrain from sur­veying those texts in which this doctrine is elaborated and, for instance, Bâna is described as urging on all divine powers and as the Lord of past and future and of all gods.202This doctrine of the five manifestations of Siva, who according to his worshippers is first and foremost the Great Lord,203 expresses the belief that he is the All (in German, das Allwesen), the Highest and the Unique who embraces and comprises the universe and all beings and of whom they are composed. Like the astamürti concept, to which it, so to say, forms a complement, it emphasizes— now clearly in its static aspect— God’s identity with the Universe and the universe’s identity with God who is omnipresent and manifests Himself and His activity always and everywhere.204 Both doctrines are ingenious attempts at explaining the omnipotence and omnipresence of God, the Force which rules, absorbs and reproduces the universe and in performing one of these acts necessarily performs the others. They give no picture of the ideal to which saints may aspire nor of heroic and selfless acts for the benefit of mankind.It is time now to turn to the Visnuists and to focus our attention on their attempts to explain the relation between God, who is Brahman, and the universe and to assign to the manifestations of God’s essence a place in a harmonious theological and philosophical system. Unlike the eightfold and fivefold Sivaite systems the Visnuite doctrine o f the48"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"THEOLOGYvyûhas— successive emanations from God and at the same time part of His essential nature— emphasizes the evolutional aspect of the relation between the One and the many. Unlike these doctrines it did not, in a developed form, gain access to the traditional orthodoxy of the puränas.205 It is true that in the comparatively late Bhägavata-Puräna God is often spoken of as having the four forms of Väsudeva, Sam- karsana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha, but what this means, what God is or does in or with these four forms is hardly elaborated. Only once206 homage is paid ‘to the Universal Soul from whose navel springs a lotus, who is Vasudeva (and as such) is tranquil, unchangeable, luminous with his own light, (who is) Samkarsana (and as such) subtle, the infinite, the end-maker, (who is) Pradyumna (and as such) the all-wakening, the internal ‘soul’, (who is) Aniruddha, (and as such) Hrsikesa207 whose âtman consists of the organs of sense’. The text however continues: ‘(who is) the Paramahamsa (and as such is) the abundant, the one of passionless nature’, and so on, showing that the former four figures do not here constitute a separate group.Scholars are, it is true, agreed that the Vyüha doctrine is one of the foremost tenets of the earlier Päncarätra school of thought, but are at a loss to explain its origin and the exact historical relations between the Krsnaism or Bhägavatism of the Bhagavadgïtâ and the fully developed Päncarätra. religion.208 It does not however seem too bold an assump­tion that the Päncarätrins,209 whose monotheistic doctrines, sometimes attributed to the reputed Sämkhya-Yoga authority Pancasikha,210 are referred to in the Näräyanlya211 section of the Great Epic and who adored Väsudeva as the Highest Being, were only secondarily ab­sorbed by the broad current of Visnuism.212 Although this process involved the replacement of Väsudeva by Visnu, they were, because of their attachment to the non-Vedic tenets of their scriptures, the Samhitäs, and in spite of their own insistence upon their orthodoxy,213 stamped as deviating from Vedic truth and tradition.Being philosophically allied with the Sämkhya schools of thought214 by the doctrine of the eternity of prakfti and the three gunas, their theory of the fourfold form of the Highest Being constitutes a modi­fication of theism peculiar to themselves. This Vyüha doctrine may indeed be considered another attempt at maintaining the fundamental monotheistic starting-point whilst incorporating a number of adorable manifestations and doubles of God, and at assigning to them positions and functions in a systematic explanation of the universe and its origin,49"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"THEOLOGYan attempt at conceiving God as the unaffected and unchanging One who nevertheless is the cause of all change215— for God and his vytlhas are identical216— an attempt also at harmonizing theology with mythology and elements of evolutionist philosophy.217The term vytlha has not always been adequately translated. It is not exactly an ‘expansion’,218 or ‘emanation’,219 still less a ‘form ’220 or a ‘conglomeration’.221 In the technical vocabulary of the Vedic ritualists the verb vy-tlh- and the noun vytlha are often used to express the idea of an effective arranging, taking or pushing asunder the parts of a coherent whole.222 Thus a twelve days’ sacrifice can be performed according to the normal schema; then it is called samtldhachandas, that means: its metres (or rather its stotras and sastras) are ‘regularly ar­ranged, settled, or restored to their normal order’. When however the proper order of the ritual acts is changed and the cups of soma arc disarranged (vy-tlh-) the different arrangements of the hymns and recitations involved characterizes the performance as vyildhachatidas.223 The dislocation of the soma pressings is afterwards rectified by dis­posing the various cups in their normal order. The author of the Ai- tareya-Brähmana says224 that this transposition (vytlha) of the ritual acts225 was instituted by Prajäpati and that by doing so one also avoids exhaustion or impairment of the inherent force, or rather one makes the rite efficient226 so that one will attain all desires and will be success­ful.227 One indeed ‘pushes away’ evil which is imminent on all sides.228 The division of a definite chant of fifteen stanzas— which are identified with a thunderbolt (vajra)— is in a similar way considered as resulting in appeasement of evil (fäntyai), for then the stanzas are no longer a thunderbolt.229 By pushing asunder the gâyatrî ‘five syllables in front and three behind’, the gods protected the sacrifice and the sacrificer.230That by pushing asimder parts of a coherent whole one may also obtain a centrai place which is a position of safety appears from another brähmana passage:231 Indra after having pushed twenty-four syllables of the anustubh stanza (which ordinarily consists of thirty- two syllables) entered the eight syllables in the middle which were left as his home. By imitating this act one enters Indra’s home and defeats one’s rivals.The verb vy-tlh— which is also applied to the sun spreading its rays232— is not infrequently used in connection with a sacrificial cake which is broken from west to east or transversely; thereupon both parts are pushed asunder with the thumb and ringftnger.233 The cake may50"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"THEOLOGY51also be separated into four quarters and it is expressly stated234 that in doing so one finds support in the regions of the universe. There is another unmistakable relation to these four regions in the ritual sep­aration235 of the Ähavaniya fire which in the Räjasüya rite is divided into four parts in the directions of the points of the compass, another piece of fire-wood being placed in the middle. The accompanying formulas are addressed to Agni and other gods residing in the East, to Yama and others residing in the South and so on, the last one being directed to the gods in the centre, namely those who dwell above and Brhaspati. By pushing the pieces of fire-wood together towards the central one one destroys, with the collaboration of these gods, the demoniac power. To a similar process the primeval waters were subjected by Agni who shoved them asunder, upwards and downwards.236 By ritually pushing asunder the sacrificial grass a central place is formed which is regarded as the navel of the earth.237 The terms under discussion are however also applicable to a division of brahman which is identical with the gâyatrï into eight parts238 and to one of the twenty-four ‘arrange­ments’239 into which Prajäpati, after having divided his ‘body’ into two, three, four, etc., separated himself.240So the conclusion may— as already intimated— be that already in Vedic ritualism the idea of vyiiha implied an effective arrangement of the parts of a coherent whole. In this connection the number four again appears to have been of cosmic significance.It seems on the other hand fairly certain that the reference to the five worshipful heroes, pancavlras, of the Vrsnis in the fragmentary Mora inscription241 combined with the piece of information furnished by the Brahmända- and Väyu-Puränas242 which, in connection with the avatäras of Visnu, make mention of five gods of human origin, well known as the great men of their race (family),243 proves the exis­tence, in the Mathura region about the beginning of the Christian era, of a cult of deified ‘heroes’ bearing the title bhagavat and belonging to the Vrsnis, that is the famous epic tribe of the Yädava people, whose most prominent scion was Krsna. Their names were Samkarsana, Väsudeva, Pradyumna, Aniruddha and Samba.244 The last-mentioned soon fell in the estimation of the worshippers,245 but the others were deified,246 the first of them being identical with Krsna Väsudeva’s elder brother Bälaräma, the others being his elder son247 and grandson.

Krsna himself and his relations are indeed well-known central figures of many epic and puränic narratives.249 W e have no sufficient informa­tion definitely to answer the question as to whether, or how far, the three other vyühas ever were independent, more or less divine figures and the object of cults of their own. Nor should we draw unfounded con­clusions from the connections, relations and functions attributed to them in the Mahäbhärata and the puränas, which are no doubt largely due to a tendency to harmonization, systematization and the desire to express religious truths in the form of mythological imagery. Sam- karsana250 evinces, not only in his name which may be explained as ‘the ploughing one’, but also in his characteristic emblems, a plough­share and sometimes a pestle used in pounding corn, traits of character which are usually proper to a bucolic or harvest deity.251 If so, are we right in supposing that his personality became indistinguishably united with that of a legendary figure, well-known to the epic poets, Balaräma or Baladeva, called Halâyudha, ‘the one who has a plough for his weapon’ ?252 That this Baladeva was, with Väsudeva, among many deities and other beings who were the object of a comparatively early cult appears from a passage in a Buddhist text,253 the Niddesa. Pra- dyumna, whose name does not appear in the older literature, is in the epos, which generally knows him as a hero, regarded as identical with or an incarnation of Brahma’s son, the rsi Sanatkumära,254 the one who is ‘always a youth’, and elsewhere is identified with Skanda255 or also with Varuna.256 These facts neither corroborate nor contradict the hypothesis that he once was not Krsna’s son.As to Aniruddha,257 this name often given to Visnu does not appear in the older Vedic literature either and it is not known when, where and by whom it was first applied to this High God. So much seems however clear that the name Aniruddha in itself could have been preferred to characterize Visnu as the divine power which can function freely, whose activities, influence and movements are unobstructed and un­hampered and who can manifest itself at will.258 Srï-Laksmï’s irresis­tible immanent power which pervades everything is indeed said to be known under this name.259 Anyhow, Aniruddha is in the epos not only a royal person but also a manifestation of the Supreme God,26052"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"THEOLOGYthe Lord (Isäna) himself,261 or a high figure of independently creative power who, known as being the eternal Visnu, even produced Brahmä- Prajäpati and the five elements.262 Is there sufficient room for the supposition that the name before being associated with Visnu was borne by a more or less distinct individual, a more or less deified person who was believed to have creative power and to be immune and safe from any form of restraint or frustration? Or was a legendary person of this name in the course of time identified with creative divine figures and important cosmogonic and philosophical principles and thanks to his relations with Krsna introduced into Visnuism?263It is, further, part of the doctrines of the Päncarätrins— and of the Sri-Vaisnavas— that each vyilha has two activities, a creative and pre­servative one and an ethical one, by which they lend assistance to those devotees who seek to attain the ultimate emancipation.264 Samkarsana is responsible for the evolution of the universe and teaches the true monotheistic religion; Pradyumna is concerned with the appearance of the duality of purusa and prakrti and the translation of the religious precepts into practice, i.e. the teaching of the dharma; Aniruddha with the creation of souls, the maintenance and government of the world and the promulgation of the good results of the observance of the dharma, i.e. the way to liberation; he proclaims the Päncarätra religion.265 This doctrine again seems to be an elaboration and systematization of ancient tendencies. Prajäpati. from whom, when he was alone, are the three worlds,266 gives advice to the gods,267 exhorts Purusa Näräyana to sacrifice,268 inspires devotion269 and assigns the conditions of life, etc., to the creatures.270 Considering that all existing things are in the threefold Vedic lore he made himself that lore271 I need not recall the famous figure of Krsna who reveals and preaches his religion while proclaiming himself Brahman and the Isvara.272There is no reference to the vyûhas in the monotheistic (ekänta) doctrine of the Bhagavadgita but it may be observed that its introduc­tion was in a way facilitated by the theory of God’s ‘natures’ (prakrti).27Z God’s lower nature is eightfold divided into the five elements and the three principles of Sämkhya psychology manas, buddln and ahamkâra,274 but distinct from this is his higher nature, which is the very life by which the universe is upheld.275 Although eternal, He moreover comes into existence by an act of his will with regard to his own prakfti and by means of his marvellous creative power (tnäyä),276 and resting on his own nature he sends forth (or ‘creates’) again and again all beings.27753"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"THEOLOGYBesides, the hero element played an important part in the evolution of the bhakti cult which is so prominent in the Gita.278The vyüha doctrine must indeed have taken a long time to attain its fully developed form.279 The earliest sources mentioning it give neither a consistent account nor all the ‘biographical’ particulars which we find in some puränas. It appears however that it was traditionally connected with Krsna’s revelation communicated in the Gita,280 that Näräyana explains the Sätvata religion of Vasudeva and his three other forms whilst identifying himself with him; that there were different forms or even schools teaching one, two, three or four vyühns,281 a way to beatitude by passing through the sun entering into the Aniruddha form and, becoming manas, into the Pradyunma form and the Samkarsana form (i.e.jtva, the individual soul) finally to attain to Vasudeva, the omnipresent Supreme Soul;282 or also the possibility of reaching the goal, i.e. of attaining to Hari, who is the final and absolute reality, without passing through the three stages of Aniruddha, Pradyumna and Samkarsana.283We would go too far afield if we tried to examine also the variant forms of the vyüha doctrine and the successive emanation in three stages of the universe which is another characteristic of the Pän- carätrins.284 One example may suffice. The Märkandcya-Puräna,285 describing the lord of the gods, the universal soul (purusa), the eternal and changeless as existing in four forms (caturvyûhâtman), that is (as) the adorable Naräyana who, pervading all things, lives in a quadruple form, argues that his first form (murti) is inscrutable, transcendent, the acme of perfection to devotees; when called Vasudeva his shape, etc., can only be conceived mentally. His second form is Sesa, who sup­ports the earth and is characterized by the tamoguna. His third form is active, devoted to the preservation of the creatures and characterized by the predominance of the sattvaguna; it creates itself in avatäras and is called Pradyumna. His fourth form, characterized by the rajoguna, abides on a serpent as its bed in the waters, and is always creative.286Nor can I enter here into a discussion of the sub-vyühas287 and vibha- vas (manifestations) or avatäras (descents or incarnations)288 of God or His vyühas. Among the thirty-nine vibhavas or ‘special existencies* assumed by the Ahirbudhnya Samhitä289 are beside Kapila, Dharma, Nara, Näräyana and others some of the well-known ‘classical' avatäras: Varäha, Krsna, both Rämas and Kalkin.290 The belief in the existence of Krsna Väsudcva, who as Para Väsudcva is the Highest54"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"THEOLOGY55Being, as an avatära led to the conclusion that in his latter aspect he was only a partial incarnation of the Supreme Krsna.291 The distinction between these different forms of the divine essence is however not without practical interest. In accordance with the different degrees of His grace God qualifies those who have fully realized the truth to understand His highest self; those who are incompletely successful are allowed to approach the vyüha forms ; the unsuccessful may adore the vibhavas.292Although Päncarätra ideas were largely absorbed by post-epic Visnuism, the doctrine of the essentially cosmic and emanativc vyûhas receded into the background when the intramundane incamatory saviours, the avatäras, came to enjoy general popularity.293 In contra­distinction to the Älvärs, whose passionate belief in and love of God prevented them from showing any interest in cosmology, Ramanuja and the Srl-Vaisnavas were however prepared to accept it;294 ‘out of affection for those who resort to Him, the Highest Brahman called Vasudeva out of his own free will exists in fourfold form in order to become (more easily) accessible to them’.295 For them Vasudeva, like Sadäsiva of the Sivaites, was the Para-Brahman of the Vcdantic schools of thought, which assumed the forms called vytlhas out of tenderness to its devotees and for purposes of worship.296 By the successive wor­ship of the manifestations (avatäras) and the vyûhas one attains to the ‘Subtle’ called Vasudeva, that is the Highest Brahman.297One of the tenets of Päncarätra Visnuism concerns the six ideal gums (component attributes) which, being apräkrta (‘not belonging to nature’, because nature docs in this phase not exist as yet)298 make up, in their totality, the ‘body’ of the highest personal God as well as that of LaksmI. In this form God is usually called Väsudcva.299 These six gunas arc the instruments or material of pure creation, but their evolu­tion docs not affect God’s being or essence. It is merely concerned with His ‘becoming’, that is, with His Sakti, His efficacious power by which He is able to produce something which cannot be accounted for by empirical methods,300 and with which a god could, already in Rgvedic times, fill the universe301 and perform creative deeds.302 The process of emanation which therefore leaves the source of the product un­changed is enacted by the six gttuas in their totality and by pairs, and the very appearance of these pairs denotes the beginning of the process. The first beings which come into existence as a result of the chain of emanations which is started in this way are the vytlhas. The pair of"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"THEOLOGYgunas which becomes manifest in Samkarsana is jiiäna (‘ omniscience’) and baia (‘force’)— it may be remembered that this figure is also called Baladeva ‘god of force’— , that becoming manifest in Pradyumna aiêvarya (‘activity based on independent lordship’) and virya (‘virility, unaffectedness’), that relating to Aniruddha sakti (‘potency, ability’) and tejas (‘brilliant energy, self-sufficiency’).303Now, although this theory is proper to this school of religious thought it makes use of some well-known older ideas. The coupling in pairs, self-evident as it is when there is a question of creation, cannot in my opinion be disconnected from the Vedic maxim that a pair (dvandvam) means strength and a productive copulation.304 The greater part of the six gunas are moreover power concepts of considerable occurrence in earlier literature so as to enter into combinations with other entities of the same class.305 Thus baia ‘strength’— defined by the Päncarätrins as ‘indefatigability in connection with the production of the world’ or ‘power to sustain all things’— combines, in brähmana contexts, with virya306— explained by the Päncarätrins as ‘being free from al­teration’— , with ojas ‘creative and inaugurative power’,307 or with varcas ‘lustrous energy’.308 Just as, moreover, the six gunas compose the ‘body’ of Vasudeva, the goddess Sri is in a brähmana309 said, by implication and in a more mythological sphere, to consist of ten power substances among which are baia, brahmavarcasa (tentatively trans­latable by ‘holiness’ or ‘sanctity’), bhaga (’good fortune; distinction’), pusti (‘prosperity’),310 and Indra is stated to be his own special energy.311 The conception that nothing exists or happens without the great god who is (a) firm ground and in whom all energies unite is expressed already in the Rgveda.312 Elsewhere313 Prajäpati, one of the ‘prede­cessors’ of the Visnuite Lord, is said to have strengthened himself with the two energies, tejas and indriyam viryam, which are Agni and Indra. One of the combinations assumed by the Päncarätrins, viz. jtläna and baia, occurs as a compound in a stanza of the Svetäsvatara-Upanisad,314 describing God as being without work to be done (effect to be reached) and without organ: ‘His highest power (sakti) is described as manifold, the activity of his knowledge and strength belongs to his nature’. It is interesting to add that in later times an authority such as Rämä- nuja315 was inclined to interpret the occurrence of one of those terms as referring, by implication, to all sixgunas; for instance, virya ascribed, in the Bhagavadgitä, to the Lord, as really meaning that He is a treasure of boundless knowledge, power, force and so on.56"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"THEOLOGY57It would carry us too far to give an exposition of variant forms of this theory which is subscribed to by definite Visnuite circles, for in­stance of the belief that Näräyana, the Highest God and Supreme Brah­man, being caturätman (that is comprising four divine persons) takes, for the sake of creation, two gums and appears as the trinity, Brahma, Visnu and Hara.316The theory of the six ideal gums and the vyühas proceeding from them may impress us as an elaboration of what Schrader317 tentatively con­sidered the Päncarätra solution of the old Indian problem of God becoming the world without sharing its imperfections. Whether or not this scholar was right in taking what he considers ‘the original worship, proved by archaeology and the Buddhist318 scripture’, of only Väsudeva and Baladeva-Samkarsana to signify nothing else than that by ‘the original Päncarätrins’ Krsna-Väsudcva was revered and adored as the transcendent High God and His brother as His immanent aspect, the addition of two more, probably less popular, it is true,319 ‘members of Krsna’s family’ may safely be regarded as an attempt to harmonize their non-orthodox views with the Vcdic doctrine of the fourfold Purusa.One of the documents attesting to this process of penetration of Vedic and originally unorthodox ‘Visnuite’ doctrines, the Mudgala- Upanisad,320 enunciates the rather uncomplicated theory that one fourth of the full Brahman, the Infinite One, Purusa Näräyana, viz. Aniruddha Näräyana,321 orders Brahma to create the universe by means of self-immolation and emanation. A more complicated ex­planation of the first five stanzas of the Purusa-siikta is found in the Ahirbudhnya-Samhitä of the Päncarätrins.322 It is taught that the first half of the initial stanza refers to Väsudeva whose connection with SrI-LaksmI, the purusas, and prakrti respectively is expressed by the epithets ‘with a thousand heads, a thousand eyes, a thousand feet’. The third quarter of the stanza ‘having covered the earth (blmmim) on all sides’, is interpreted as a reference to the Matter aspect of Laksmï as the material cause of the universe,323 the fourth, ‘he extended beyond it the length of ten fingers’, as indicating the infinity of the cause324 as compared with its products. Whereas according to the Mudgala- Upanisad the second stanza (‘The Purusa is this All, What has been and is to be; and he is the lord of immortality, which he grows beyond through food’) expresses God’s universal pervasion with respect to time, the Ahirbudhnya-Samhitä takes it as a reference to Samkarsana who5—v.s."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"THEOLOGYis the lord of immortality with whose help the soul through the material universe reaches liberation. The third stanza is said to state that Pradyumna’s service is still greater because he is the creator of purusa and prakrti. The Mudgalopanisad on the other hand considers it to express Hari’s high-power-and-greatness (vaibhavam) and, alter­natively, his being the One of four vytlhas: ‘Such is his greatness and more than that is Purusa. A fourth of him is all beings, three-fourths of him the immortal in heaven’.Both explanations agree in identifying the fourth quarter mentioned in the next stanza (‘With three quarters Purusa rose upward; one quarter of him here came into being again. . . ’325 with Aniruddha, the Inner Ruler (antaryämin326 of all beings, who pervades the animate and inanimate nature. The fifth stanza (‘From him Viräj was born, from Viräj Purusa . . .’) refers, according to the Samhitä, to the first Purusa, who is Aniruddha327 and the second Purusa, i.c. Brahma, the Viräj being the Highest prakrti, the matter in the form o f an egg out of which the demiurge produced the world. The upanisad is however of the opinion that the poet deals with the origin of prakrti and purusa from Päda Näräyana, who really is Hari.328It may in this connection be remembered that a belief in a fourfold division of the Supreme Reality329 is also apparent in other Visnuite contexts.330 ‘In the epoch of Manu Svayambhü the eternal Näräyana was’— according to an epic passage331— ‘born as the son ofDharma in a quadruple form, namely, Nara, Näräyana, Hari and Krsna.’ According to the well-known account of the Rämäyana332 Räma and his three brothers were incarnations of Visnu. Fourfoldness is in a way also characteristic of the epic Visnu, among whose thousand names is Caturvyüha.333 The author of the Visnu-Puräna asserts that the Highest Being, Visnu-Väsudeva, is in four forms, viz. pradhäna (in­discrete primal matter), purusa (spirit), vyakta (the manifested) and käla (time) the cause of production, preservation and absorption.334 It is therefore not surprising to find, also in Päncarätric and other Visnuite texts, many correlations of God and his sakti with the four regions of the universe.335It may be worth while to dwell for a moment on the elaboration of the concept of the composite God in which the vytlhas were merged into One.336 The idea o f‘One in Four’ is for instance illustrated by the four-faced early medieval Visnu images from Northern India, mostly Kashmir.337 Laying much emphasis on the ideology behind the58"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"THEOLOGY59images of the gods, which they regard as the consecrated symbols of these divine powers, iconographical texts inform us that Visnu’s eight arms stand for the four cardinal and intermediate points' of the compass, that his four faces, illustrating the concept of the unified vytlhas, typify the ideal gunas bala,jtïâna, aisvarya and sakti which, being associated with the four vytlhas, are in this connection, interestingly enough, reduced to four.338 The four faces are allocated as follows: the front or eastern (human) face is that of Vasudeva, the southern (lion) face belongs to Samkarsana, the northern (boar) face to Pradyumna and the back or western one, the fierce (raudra), to Aniruddha.339 It may be asked340 whether the last figure is here the representative of destruction,341 a function elsewhere342 attributed to Samkarsana.343It remains briefly to revert to the important part played by Laksmî, God’s ialiti. Whereas in his supreme state Visnu and his ialiti are said to be always associated with one another344 and to constitute one Paramätman, the Supreme Brahman345 without distinction,346— hence the use of the compound Laksmï-Nârâyana347— in the first stage of primary creation the latter ‘awakes’ in her two aspects kriyä and. bhüti, ‘action’ and ‘becoming’. That means that she is the causa Instrumentalis and the causa materialis of the universe.348 Then she mani­fests the six ideal gunas which together constitute Vasudeva and Laksmî. Here again it is of some interest to remember that bhüti ‘becoming, thriving, development’349 is an old term which already in the Rgveda conveyed the meaning ‘coming into being, genesis’.350 Vrtra, the fiend, who does not wish the constitution of an inhabitable world is said to keep us from bhüti.351 The term352 sometimes occurs in the same context as in, which as the name of the goddess is in the course of time to fuse with Laksmî, God’s Sakti: thus the Earth is353 requested ‘ to set the person praying in well-being and development (prosperity) ’. In the ideal condition of humanity sketched in the closing stanza of the Bhagavadgïtâ354 fri, triumph, bhüti and morality will be sure. Bhüti is also adored as a divine person,355 and then is one of the goddesses who are invoked together with Srî to promote the welfare of the creatures.356 In the Great Epic this figure is not only identified with Sri357 but also with Visnu himself.358 The idea that a divine being starts creating with an aspect of itself—as is asserted by the Visnuites in Lak- smi’s case— had already been expressed in connection with Prajäpati who in order to develop and to become manifold359 differentiated himself into sixteen aspects.360 After that he started creating.

In the second stage of primary creation it is her biniti aspect which is manifested in the grosser forms of the aggregate of the individual souls365 and the mäyä sakti, the energy which is the immaterial source of the universe. Hence the belief that this metaphysical complement of the Lord assumes also, not only the forms of the hktis of the vytlhas and of His manifestations, but alsq the functions ordinarily ascribed to the great gods who supervise all origin, maintenance and rcabsorp- tion in the universe. It is therefore LaksmI, the ultimate supreme power into which all other powers resolve themselves and mythologically, the queen of the Highest Heaven,366 who is also called Brahma, Visnu and Siva. It is LaksmI who is creatively active,367 while taking into consideration the accumulated karman of the living beings368 and who manifests her nature in other goddesses such as Durgâ, Kâli and so on, who is MahalaksmI because she stamps (laksayati) mundane existence as merit and demerit; who is Bhadrä in her beneficial form and Kali as the destroyer of the wicked.369 It is LaksmI, mythologically God’s wife,370 and always intent on delivering, by her favour and compassion (anugraha), the incarnated souls out of the misery of mun­dane existence,371 who, identified with Visnu’s highest location or manifestation ('parant dhäma or paramani padani372) is the highest goal of the devotees— whose souls are parts or rather ‘contractions’373 of the Goddess; it is she into whom enter the emancipated.

It is the Sakti of the sacrificer which is believed to induce Indra to approach, but also the latter’s Sakti which is gracious and salutary (bhadrâ) for the former.374 Indra is requested to intercede for men and Agni said to fill heaven and earth with their Saktis375 It may be recalled that the epithet Sacipati ‘lord of energy’ is in the Veda often given to Indra in passages men­tioning his heroic deeds which made the world an inhabitable cosmos and his readiness to help and assist man.376 The possession of Sakti was also an essential requirement of those who wanted to reach heaven.377 In the Päncarätric view of God’s Sakti Srî-Laksmï has spontaneously and by virtue of her own power differentiated herself from God for the sake of the liberation of all souls.378These few remarks may help to explain why the goddess— whether she is conceived as Visnu’s spouse or as a really metaphysical principle— should have been become the central figure in the expositions of some Päncarätra authorities."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"IVRitualBefore embarking upon a study of the ritual and ceremonial aspects of Saivism and Vaisnavism we should be aware of the fact that despite their enormous and long-established significance in literature, both gods and the typical rites of their religions do not nowadays, and in all probability did not for many centuries, play the same prominent role in the daily religious practice of the masses. Worshipped by part of the population as the Supreme Being, oiva and Visnu belong in the first place also to a group of major and remote divine figures, who appear prominently in literature and in the religion of the higher classes which are concerned with the acquisition of good fortune or religious merit which is expected to determine the devotee’s fate after death. These higher deities are objects of a cult practised in temples or in shrines in private houses, where their images are installed. They are also generally iconographically represented and, as they are presumed to be the purest and most respectable group of higher beings, they are worshipped only after the devotee has ritually purified himself. Their worship is performed regularly and at least once a year they are honoured with special celebrations. Although their devotees sometimes invoke their aid and favour, they are above manipulation and cannot be forced to comply with man’s requests. They are generally not sup­posed to cause, like the lower deities, misfortune, but rather to with­hold their favour in case some evil should befall the worshipper. They are on the other hand concerned with the weal and woe of the uni­verse and with the ultimate fate of the individual’s soul.1A discussion of the cult of Visnu2 and Siva3 must in the second place be prefaced by the remark that, although generally speaking all Hindus know of these gods,4 and have a notion of their main functions, their daily concern in the workaday world is rather with a host of minor deities whose special business it is to regulate matters of im­mediate personal interest.5 This fact is, on the side of Visnu and 6iva, in harmony with a certain lack of prominence in ancient and traditional popular belief, for instance in astronomical and cosmological systems6"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"RITUALwhere they arc put on a par with many colleagues, and in works dealing with portents and prognostication, in which these two gods do it is true occur, but mainly act like Indra, Vayu, Yama and other parochial deities.7 Their increasing significance as high gods8 led, on the other hand, to their introduction into ever new situations and provinces of religious life.9A closely connected preliminary observation concerns the relations between these two gods of the so-called Great, that is Sanskritic and philosophical, tradition10 on the one hand and the powers and deities of the Little, that is the popular, on the whole regional, tradition in­cluding innumerable religious observances not described in Sanskrit literature— a distinction which is largely similar to that between tran­scendental and pragmatic complexes. The relations between general Hindu religious and philosophical doctrines on one hand and village practice on the other is a subtle and complicated topic which we cannot tackle here. The centuries-old, ever continuing process of mutual ‘osmosis’ and penetration of these two traditions involves also the adoption of popular and local deities into the pantheon recognized by the Sanskrit-writing authorities and their occasional identification with Hindu gods.11 Thus Visnu— whose worshippers were already at an early date inclined to include other gods in their faith— , after identi­fying himself with Krsna and Näräyana, absorbed local divinities into himself, such as Vcnkatesa and Tirupati in the South and Vithoba of Mahärästra. Visnuite authors also adopted, to mention another instance, Vindhyavâsinï, the most prominent among the female deities of the Vindhya mountains, and connected her with Visnu by taking her to be an incarnation of his Yoganîdrâ or Yogamäyä. The question however arises why the goddesses of the villages,12 when they make their appearance also in the big temples of the Hindu gods should, in the South and elsewhere, be more often regarded as consorts of Siva than as allied with Visnu, and how we are to account for the fact that ‘the differentiation between Saivas and Vaisnavas is maintained a long way out among the so-called village gods’.13 The explanation that the strong trend to connect the village deities with Siva was because he was the more popular is unlikely.14 W e should rather think of his special character and his special affinity with the popular deities. The god who in Vcdic times was the ruler of a host of Rudras and whose spouse, Durgä, maintains close relations with the uncivilized part of the Indian world, may on the contrary have won the sympathy of63"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"RITUALmany uneducated countrymen because his ambivalent and incalculable character could strongly appeal to their feelings and easily chime in with their conceptions of divinity.As soon as a religious community tends to split up into a number of members who are inclined to ‘leave the world’ and a group of devotees which are not, or not yet, able or willing to take this step, the former group may assume the character of an ‘inner circle’ or ‘order’ which seeking a life of devotion, retains, adopts, or develops a common cult, particular vows and observances and a form of initiation. Whereas Hindus, generally speaking, are free, mainly from individual motives, to join such an inner circle, once they have joined they have to submit to its rites and way of living. I first select for a short discussion the diksä,15 initiation or consecration, which, involving a transformation of the aspirant’s personality, bears a greater resemblance to the traditional upanayana— the pupilage and ‘second birth’ of a twice-born boy— 16 than to the Vedic diksä of the sacrificer— with which it however is functionally related17— and which in milieux aspiring to a more per­manent state of sanctity was regarded as a complement to, or even a valuable substitute for, a previous upanayana. Ancient and widespread ideas and customs in connection with initiation were gradually put into practice in the framework of Hindu ritual and embedded in Visnuite or Sivaite patterns of Hinduism. Both religions feeling the need of this institution very strongly, Visnuism emphasized its character as an initiation to a life of devotion, as an entrance into closer contact with God,18 although freedom from karma and samsara are, besides happiness, prosperity, knowledge, a long life and other ambitions, among the ideals to be realized through this rite.19 Sivaism,20 on the other hand, urges the absolute necessity of faivi diksä, initiation into a Saiva ‘order’, performed in accordance with the Saiva ritual, for anyone who wishes to attain to final liberation. All -religious schools are agreed21 that the one who has the authority to initiate others is the qualified guru,22 as a rule a brahman23— but among the Saivas24 and in some Vaisnava communities also members of the other ranks— who has received the special gurudiksä, and whom Saivas as well as Vaisnavas often regard as representing God himself.25 The Sri- Vaisnavas even believe him to be a visible partial incarnation of God; for them, as for all Vaisnavas, the guru is indeed more than a teacher, and even more than a mediator between God and men; in the Saiva conviction every initiate is considered a manifestation of Siva himself,64"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"several schools emphasizing that guru and aspirant are brought into contact through divine grace.26It is the opinion of both religions that the main object of dïkçâ is purification.27 Whereas the Visnuites assert that this is a prerequisite to admission to a religious order or community because the soul needs purification before it can become God-conscious, the Saivas hold that the dïksâ imparted by a guru, who represents God himself and who after the initiation continues to assist the initiate, destroys the original impurity (ânava-mala)28 and paves the way for removing ‘animality’ (pafatva) and for attaining the state of being Siva (livatva). Päncarätra Visnuites commit the postulant to a confession— a well-known sort of purification— and a probationary period;29 the Vîrasaivas combine it with ethical preachings and yoga mysticism.30 It would carry us too far to survey all diksä ceremonies recognized as duty and custom by the various communities. Mention may only be made here of the samaya- dïksâ,31 by which a person is admitted into the fold of Saivism and becomes entitled32 to perform rites (with the exception of the fire ritual).33 It may be said to correspond to the pancasamskâra ceremony, ‘the fivefold sacraments’, of the Sri-Vaisnavas. The latter consists of the distinct sacral acts of branding the symbols of God on the postu­lant’s shoulders (tapa, a custom known also to the Saivas34), the appli­cation of the distinctive mark on the forehead (pundra), the reception, by the initiate, of a devotional name (1naman) and of the distinctive holy formulas of the community (mantra) and, finally, the presenting of an image of God for worshipping (yäga, yajana).35The mantra is of special importance. The Sudarsana mantra imparted to a Päncarätra novice should, to mention only this, on no account be used for trifling objects or mundane purposes, only for welfare, never for destruction. The Sivaites are likewise convinced that the mantra is a form or representative of God himself,36 the phenomenal world being the materialization of the mantras, without which no cult is possible. After the ceremony of branding the Vaisnava postulant often requests to be initiated into one of the sacred scriptures of Visnuism, to catch the real spirit of which he now becomes prepared. In Vaisnava practice, moreover, dïksâ for admission into the ‘inner circle’ is, in accordance with the four classes of men, fourfold. If the candidate is a k$atriya or a vaiêya he must renounce his customary way of life.37 The Saivas on the other hand, convinced that God does not manifest Himself to all souls in the same way, recognize different methods ofRITUAL 65"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"RITUALinitiation varying with the recipients. Some of them need oral instruc­tion, others an introduction into asceticism and yoga, or instruction through religious symbols, etc. In this they agree with the Tantrists who are of the opinion that the mode of initiation has to vary accord­ing to the disciple’s disposition and competency.38 A certain propensity to Tantrist practices39 is however not foreign to definite Visnuite communities either. Admitting no less than four procedures, one of which40 follows the directions of the Päncarätra authorities, they may also initiate a candidate in accordance with the nyäsa practice, i.e. the imposition of so-called mystic syllables on his body in order to unite him with spiritual qualities,41 and with the penetrating (vedhamayi) procedure42 consisting in teaching how to penetrate into the six circles assumed by the Yoga doctrine to exist in the human body.The ascetic (sâdhu) usually wears some distinctive mark (puttdra) on his forehead and often carries some symbol of his religion. If he recog­nizes Visnu as the Supreme Being he may possess a discus and a conch shell (fankha), replicas of God’s invincible flaming weapon, through which its owner is superior to men, gods and demons, and of His instrument of beneficent power and protection against evil which, penetrating the universe, symbolizes his omnipresent power.43 In addition to these he has a sälagräma stone44 or a tulasï plant45 which are representatives of Visnu’s own essence and of that of his consort LaksmI. If he is a Saiva he will, impersonating his God himself, carry a trident46 which denotes empire and the irresistible force of transcendental reality, wear a small linga47 and possess a human skull48 which shows his being above the terror inspired by worldly transitoriness of which it is reminiscent, and a damaru drum,49 which symbolizes God’s creative power, and a tiger skin, his well-known garment. In imitation o f his god he may have his body smeared with white ashes and he will set up the litiga— from which all life in the universe has issued— for wor­ship50 wherever he settles. All communities agree that the sacredness of these emblems— like that of images— is due to the fact that the presence of God, when invoked by mantras, is felt to be in them so that they enable the devotee to worship the Invisible through the visible.That the opposition between the two great religious currents re­lated to their socio-ritual differences rather than the theoretic sides of their religion, theology and philosophical foundations, is only a special case of the general Hindu conviction that it is the dhartna— an untrans­latable term51 implying inter alia the whole of the socio-religious norms66"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"RITUALand duties, the being in harmony with the right order, the traditional Hindu way of life implying morality as well as right and virtuous con­duct— that really matters and not the mata, i.e. the opinions, beliefs and doctrines, regarding which one may to a considerable extent use one’s own discretion,52 because, while freedom of opinion obtains to an exceptional degree, the dharma, maintained and observed, supports the structure of society, upholds the regular and harmonious progress of the cosmic processes and is essential to the continuity of all pheno­mena in the universe.53 It becomes, then, intelligible that also in matters of cults and rites right and correct behaviour is viewed as an important personal duty and responsibility: Visnuites are averse to taking part in Sivaite ritual performances, to observing Sivaite practices, to pronounce Sivaite mantras. A mantra containing the name of a god— for instance namali êivâya— is indeed regarded as embodying the energy of the god which is activated by pronouncing the formula. The knowledge of, and meditation on, a mantra enables the adept to exert influence upon the god, to exercise power over the potencies manifesting in it, to estab­lish connections between the divinity and himself, or to realize his identity with that divinity. The idea expressed by means of a mantra which is characteristic of, and handed down in, a definite religious community, and by being informed of which one is received into membership, is described as ‘the sum of all spiritual truth’, as the concentrated essence of divine reality, etc. Such a formula becomes so to say the ‘watch-word’54 of a community or the ‘hallmark’ of the correct ritual behaviour of the one who pronounces it. Using strange mantras means following strange gods and dissociating oneself from the traditions of one’s group, and this implies a serious infraction of the dharma.55 In this connection it is interesting to notice that not only the most important Gâyatrï mantra (RV. 3, 62, 10) was in various religious communities subjected to variation so as to make it more adapted to their particular purposes, but even the ancient syllable Om was dif­ferently interpreted, Saivas regarding it as an equivalent to the five syllables of their mantra namah siväya and Päncarätrins believing it to represent the three vyülias of Aniruddha, Pradyumna and Samkar- sana.56The masses being bound up with external observances and the main form of their religious activity being ritual and ceremonial, the tra­ditional Hindu is convinced that, in view of the fundamental oneness of the universe, an harmonious co-operation of men in ceremonial67"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"RITUALactivities57 is necessary for the harmonious functioning o f the world. All must co-operate if the crops are to be good, and if the life of the village is to be happy. Constituting, in the sphere of the hic et nunc, a repetition and representation of timeless mythological events of uni­versal significance and expressing at selected or critical moments— which may be dangerous or beneficent— man’s feeling of oneness with higher power, their celebration carries him beyond the critical moment. In practice, they serve multiple ends: the collective experience of the nearness and the stimulation of power on high-days, purification, protection, honouring of deities. They are a source of pleasure and recreation, nourish spiritual life and, moreover, provide the principal occasion on which most villages may engage in concerted symbolic activities.58 Although the great gods play, in many festivities, no impor­tant part, it would carry us too far to enter into a detailed survey of the main Visnuite and Sivaite high-days.59 Let it suffice to recall that, speak­ing quite generally, the Sivaite festivals are less strictly vegetarian and non-alcoholic60 than the Visnuite; that one and the same festival may comprise the worship of either god; that there is no hesitation in partaking of the food offered to Visnu, but much aversion to eating that which even nominally remains of an oblation, presented to Siva ; that particular elements of the rites and festivities are traditionally associated with the characters of these divine figures or find their motivation in Visnuite or Sivaite mythology;61 that the same cere­monies may be known to both communities but be practised differently; that Visnu is not only often represented by one of his avatäras62 but also associated with other gods, who then are also adored by Saivas, whereas the festivals for Durgä cannot be disconnected from her matri­monial relations with Siva ; that in this point also, the gods may, to a certain extent, be said to complement each other, the fifth month of Hindu year being, for instance, sacred to Visnu, the tenth to Siva.I must however pay some attention to the matutinal ritual. This very important part of the duties of the traditional Indian householder, which— in spite of some insertions and modifications— is mainly Vedic in character63 and is elaborately described in the dharma lit­erature,64 is in Saiva and Vaisnava circles much the same.65 The prin­cipal topics mentioned under the head ‘daily duties and ceremonies’ (ähtiika) are the following: getting up from bed, care of the bodily purity (éaued), brushing the teeth (dantadhävana),66 bath (stiano), worship in the morning and evening twilight (samdhyä), offering water68"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"RITUALto gods, sages and deceased ancestors (1tarpana),67 the five so-called mahäyajnas (i.e. offering, in fire, to the gods; offering to the Fathers; presenting a Wi-oblation to demons and spirits; giving food to brah­mans or honouring guests; study of the Veda),68 attending the fire, the midday meal, professional duties, gifts, performing sacrifices at certain times, going to bed.69 The rules of ritual conduct and routine and the objectives recognized in both religions— which in this respect also do not conform exactly to the same principles— are different only in details. The ritual leads to bhukti (mundane results) and mukti (final liberation), but the Vaisnavas70 attach much value to what is called the sättvika tyäga, which, being regarded as the climax of their observances, consists in renouncing any kind of fruit or benefit and in performing them only to please Lord Visnu.71 Emphasizing that it is the end and aim of man’s life to attain final liberation (moksa) and that this end is best gained by the continual service of God, they perform the daily rites in order to preserve the state of corporeal and mental purity which is an absolute requirement and to adore God while realizing their entire dependence on Him.72 It may further be recalled that the Vis- nuites, who are also known as Bhâgavatas, Sâttvikas, etc., adore their god in many manifestations and under different names.73The preparatory acts executed in purification and sanctification of the worshipper himself give no occasion for many remarks.74 Those Sivaite manuals which are to a considerable extent influenced by Tantrist practices pay attention to the dedication of the worshipper’s daily inhalations and exhalations to the deities residing in the seven cakras, i.e. power centres, in his body,75 and the subsequent prâna- pratisthä, i.e. the establishment of God’s life-breath into the person of the worshipper.76 That other Sivaite manuals insert, after the teeth- cleaning,77 a prayer to Bhairava at bathing time is not surprising. The complex of rites connected with bathing78 comprises, inter alia, the recitation of the mülamantra, that is the basic or principal mantra of a religious community, viz. namah éivâya for the Saivas, Om namo näräyanäya79 for a SrI-Vaisnava, etc. In addition to this other mantras and formularized prayers are muttered, the Visnuites being enjoined exclusively to think of the service of God, urging Him to be pleased with the most auspicious materials for worship.80 While under water the devotee should imagine that his head is below the feet of God and he should repeat the eight-syllabled mantra as many times as he possibly can.

Wrapping them round his head he prays with TA. 7, 4, 1 f.84 for prosperity, clothes, cows, food, drink and good fortune. Finally85 he concentrates his thoughts on God as effulgent with innumerable suns and carrying conch, disk, club and lotus in his four hands.Instead of these acts and formulas Sivaite texts enjoin the worshipper to pronounce the non-Vedic astra-mantra (asträya nomali or Ont hah asträya hum phat)86 which is a protection against evil influences, to consecrate the mud with which his body is to be rubbed87 with the three likewise non-Vedic tattva-mantras honouring the representatives of the three groups of principles ätnian, vidyä (‘wisdom’) and Siva,88 to practise a definite ritual finger position (ntudrä)89 and to perform the elaborate astra-sänti. This is a rite of appeasement and propitiation90 consisting of, inter alia, a meditation on God’s astradevatä, i.e. his deified trident,91 which may be followed92 by a Tantric rite to control the vital forces of the body (pranäyäma),93 a technique which paves the way for mental stability, concentration and ‘unification’ of consciousness.94 Finally the worshipper has to bathe while pronouncing several mantras and performing various acts for fortifying himself against evil,95 and sip— of course also in the prescribed ritual way— water. The latter act (äcamana)96 is to wipe out all traces of preceding acts97 so that the worshipper is, ‘as a new man’, able to pass on to another stage of his (ritual) performances. An additional Sivaite rite to be mentioned in this connection is the purification and powdering of the body by means of sacred ashes, remaining after burning cow-dung98 which being intrinsically pure needs only a consecration, no purification.99One of the other elements of the ritual, the offering to the gods, fsis and Fathers (tarpana),100 is performed by the Sri-Vaisnavas in the consciousness of their being integral parts (amia) of God’s nature.101 In contradistinction to the Vedic grhyasütras,102 which recognize the rite as an appendage103 of the early morning bath, Sri-Vaisnava authorities do not insist on the names of the gods, etc. being mentioned70"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"RITUAL71individually,104 but prescribe a comprehensive formula of the type allowed by later authorities on dharnta if the worshipper has no time for the lengthy enumeration of names.105 The Vaikhanasas,106 accord­ing a place of honour to Narayana, steer a middle course, enumerating the names of many gods, but limiting those of the rsis to the most prominent. The Saivas, besides the use of other mantras introduced by the Vedic vyahrtis (Ohi bhur bhuvah svah),107 recognize additional ritual acts which are partly Tantric in character.108The next act, if the devotee is a Saiva,109 is the application of the sacred ashes in the tripundra form (three horizontal lines),110 if he is a Vaisnava, the putting on of the urdhvapundra, that is of the perpen­dicular mark on the forehead, characteristic of the adherents of his religion. Both worshippers put the consecrated material— the Vaisnava uses a kind of white clay and turmeric powder— in their left111 hand, pronounce mantras and proceed to apply them, not only to the forehead but also to other parts of the body.112 The Sri-Vaisnava has, here again, ancient mantras, e.g. stanza of the Srisukta RVKh. 5, 87113 T .invoke here that Sri, who is perceptible through her odour, who is irresistible, always well supplied (with nourishment), abounding in dung, the ruler of all creatures’. It may be remembered114 that §ri, the goddess of welfare and prosperity, and Visnu’s spouse, makes her presence felt also in dung, abundant food and in the fertile soil, hence also in the clay applied by the Visnuite to his body.115 The function of both substances, clay and ashes, is indeed lustral and fortifying; the marks themselves, though in daily practice largely serving as means of identifying the bearer’s caste or religious group, are considered to ex­press or ‘symbolize’ his living in connection with divine power.116 Other mantras to be pronounced— in addition to the mula-mantra, etc.— by a Sri-Vaisnava are RV. i, 154, 1 the first stanza of the Visnu- sukta: T will now proclaim the heroic deeds of Visnu, who has measured out the terrestrial regions; who established the upper abode having, wide-paced, strode out triply*117 and a series of short formulas which, being identical with a series of Vedic mantras used, in another ritual context, together with RV. 1, 154, 1 and other formulas, are to consecrate the dedication of some parts of the worshipper’s body to God.118 This stanza is immediately followed by two stanzas and a half (five lines) which would be almost completely identical with a passage in the Tattiriya-Aranyaka, 10, that is the Maha-Narayana-Upanisad, but that the order of the padas is different.119 In the upanisad these formulas"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"72RITUALare to consecrate a lump of clay with which an ascetic who has re­nounced all earthly concerns has to smear his body before taking a bath:120 an indication of historical connections between these Vis- nuites and ancient ascetic circles.121Then the worshipper puts the marks on the forehead and eleven other places of the body while repeating in definite order twelve names of Visnu: Ont kesavaya natnah, etc. This act is followed by the likewise twelvefold application, with a mixture of Srï-Laksmï’s turmeric, of marks of krïcürna (i.e. ‘sacred powder’) in the middle of the other marks;122 while doing so twelve similar mantras are addressed to Sri: sriyai namah, amftodbhavaya tiamah, etc. Thereupon the marks are touched while repeating twelve longer mantras in which the same names of Visnu return in the same order.123 These expressions of ho­mage and humility124 are non-Vedic but the order of the names,125 occurring already in Baudhayana’s dharmasastra,126 is traditional.127 While pronouncing these formulas one presses the hands together and moves them in the correct order to the respective marks.128 Nowadays most Sri-Vaisnavas perform the complete ceremony only on festival days, limiting themselves usually to two pundras (and the relative mantras), one in the face and the other at the back of the neck.129 Finally a number of Sanskrit (and in the South also Tamil) formulas and verses are quoted in praise of the acaryas, the highly honoured ‘fathers of the church’.The Saivas have of course mantras of their own,130 one consecratory formula in which the elements and everything, including the organs of sense, etc., is stated to be equivalent to the sacred ashes and the water with which they are mixed with light, life-juice, uinrta, Brahma, the three divisions of the universe and the mystic syllable Ont, and another to worship Siva, the giver of strength and final emancipation. The identification of the ashes with amrta, the draught of immortality,131 is especially interesting because one of the Saiva rites of a Tantric charac­ter performed in this connection and frequently also in other ritual contexts is the aniftikarana,132 the making of amrtay transmutation of water into the draught of life and immortality.133 In performing the rites connected with the sacred ashes Saivas appear to attach much value to a meditation (dhyana) consisting in picturing mentally the icono­graphie representation of their God in order to achieve the realization of their identity with Him.An element of the daily rites performed after the application of the"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"RITUAL73pimdra and, though Tantric in character, adopted by members of both communities is nyäsa, the assignment, by means of mantras and the simultaneous imposition of fingers, of various divine powers to parts of the body.134 According to Saiva authorities the divinities in different parts of the body represent the five aspects or faces o f Siva, Isäna residing in the head, Tatpurusa in the mouth, etc.135 The accompanying for­mulas which occur already in the Mahä-Narayana-Upanisad, are traditional.136 At the end of this part of the rites the worshipper has realized his identity with God.Now he is fully qualified to perform the ritual acts of worship and meditative concentration for the morning (and, if he should perform these also,137 midday and evening) samdhyäs.138 The sanidhya, an im­portant complex ritual act without which one is impure and unfit for further rites, mainly consists, with variations in detail, in an adoration of, and presentation of offerings (water, sesame, flowers, etc.) to, the sun.139 Here is room for the observation that the Saiva, after a com­plex ritual of breath control, mudräs, mantras, etc., proceeds to meditate, first on the aspects of the samdhi— morning-twilight, noon, evening- twilight, considered to be goddesses and the éaktis of the three great gods140— and after the indispensable märjana, a kind of self-baptism,141 performed by Siva— the worshipper is Siva— on himself, continues to meditate on the sun and on Sadäsiva in the centre of the sun’s orb, praising him with a long formula. After another tarpana ceremony and some other acts he reduces the holy water, called Sivattrtha, to its original elements and makes Siva return to his sun-form. Finally he goes to a sacred spot to repeat the mulamantra.Now we should remember that sanidhya (crepuscular) adorations were already prescribed by ancient authorities on Vedic ritual142 and dharma,143 some of whom being of the opinion that the first oblation in the morning should be made to Sürya, or to Sürya and Prajäpati,144 and most of them stating that the recitation of the Sävitri- stanza addressed to the Sun: W e hope to obtain that desirable bright­ness of Savitar who is expected to stimulate our visions’145 is the principal element in this rite.146 This rite, including praise and confirm­ation of his glory and power,147 was on the one hand to fortify Sürya against the powers of darkness148 and on the other to secure inspiration and, in general, the stimulant and salutary contact with the source of all light.149 Add to this that the ritual comprised also bathing and the use of other mantras and practices,150 and that the belief obtained that the6—v.s."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"RITUALgod called Äditya represented by, or present in, the orb o f the sun was identical with Brahman,151 it became clear that Saiva and Vaisnava communities, whose God was no other than Prajapati or Brahman,152 could easily adopt the ancient rites while changing some details153 and incorporating other suitable acts and formulas.154I say Saivas and Vaisnavas, because the Vaisnava variant of the crepuscular ceremonies is in substance similar, the insci and inno­vations tending, of course, to be Visnuite in character.

Thus the formula aniftopastaranam asi156 ‘you are the layer for amrta , which in Vedic rites is to accompany the preparation of a layer for the cup containing the madhuparka, i.e. the mixture of honey and milk to be offered to an honoured guest,157 or the sipping, by that guest, of water,158— whereas the Gopatha-Brähmana mentions it in the section on the acatnana, the ritual act of rinsing the mouth159— is in Vaisnava practice pronounced to consecrate the drinking of a little of the tïrtha, i.e. sacred water. Thereupon the worshipper cats some prasada, that is food that had been offered to God and hence is sacred and believed to bring salvation.160 Another formula which is to accom­pany the preceding act, the repeated sprinkling of water, is satyam tvartenaparisincami ‘With rta (Order and Truth) I sprinkle round Thee, the true’. Here we have a reminiscence of the Vedic Agnihotra rite, the morning and evening attendance on, and oblation of milk to, Agni,161 which the important Hinduist samdhyä rites, while borrowing from it, have replaced. Whereas in the Vedic rite these consecrating words are to accompany the sprinkling, in the morning, round the sacrificial fires,162 they are now pronounced while water is sprinkled round the plate on which prasada is served.There is no need to quote further examples of ancient mantras163 or to dwell on the typically Visnuite formulation of the intention ([sain- kalpa). Let it suffice to add that a Sn-Vaisnava should not see, while performing these rites, wicked people, hidras and those who worship other deities. If he cannot avoid seeing these spreaders of ritual im­purity who would nullify his efforts he should see the sun after them.164 As to the upasthana, the prayer to that luminary— that is, according to Vaisnava belief, to God being in its disk165— , this is performed with the hand in the position of prayer, a pradaksitia (a clockwise74"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"RITUAL75circumambulation) and three successive stanzas addressed to Mitra, which go back to the Yajurveda, and are in Vedic ritual used in con­nection with the worship of the ritual fire.166It is time now to pass on to temple worship167 which reveals a religious life considerably different from that recommended in the Veda.168From the point of view of construction there is no more difference between Saiva and Vaisnava temples than there has always been in the purposes of those erecting and visiting them.169 Temple worship obviously originated when the main religious communities had not yet considerably differentiated and it continued to develop along similar lines: while the sanctuaries are dedicated to different deities, the struc­ture of the buildings as well as the daily practices performed in them follow a common pattem.170 There are, it is true, differences in the symbols or image in the centre,171 the images on the walls, the symbol fixed on the fmial of the top172 and, likewise, in the vahanas before the entrance, etc., as well as in the mythical motivation of the sacredness of a place. Siva temples have not rarely been built in consequence of the miraculous appearance or ancient worship of the litiga.173 Sacred to Durga are fifty-one places on which parts of her body fell on the earth after she had been cut to pieces by Visnu when Siva carried her dead body through the world,174 to Visnu localities of special prominence in the hagiography of his avatäras115 For, although the gods may mani­fest themselves wherever they please they have certain favourite abodes on earth and these have acquired sanctity through the permanence of their presence.176Among the many factors to be considered in erecting the temple is its place in relation to the dwellings of men. According to the most com­prehensive manual on architecture, etc., the Mänasära Silpasästra (9, 255 ff), sanctuaries of Visnu and Laksmi in their benevolent aspects should face the village, no doubt in order to allow these deities to radiate their beneficial power throughout its houses. A temple of Narasimha, Visnu’s fierce lion-man aspect, should however face away from a village ; then it will ward off demons and disease. Other authorities are of the opinion that Siva’s temple should be situated in the region sacred to him, that is in the North-East177— according to Visnuites,178 with the god’s back towards the village, because ‘Hara’s (Siva’s) back brings fortune’— Visnu’s shrine in the West, facing the village, because ‘ Hari’s (Visnu’s) look brings fortune’ ; but Kautilya, while describing the"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"RITUALlayout of a town, speaks of temples of Siva, Sri and other deities in the centre.179 According to Saiva authorities, the litiga may be placed anywhere, but the blessings radiated by it vary with every point of the compass: in the East it will confer royal dignity, in the South a long term of life, etc.180On entering a temple, one passes in the precincts, when the sacred complex is dedicated to Siva, his bull Nandin, when it is Visnuite, the bird Garuda.181 Mythologically the gods’ vältanas, vehicles and atten­dants, these animals are, in the eyes of a student of religion, thcrio- morph duplicate manifestations or representations of Siva’s and Visnu’s nature and energy.182 Nandin represents the fertility and procreation aspect of the god who already in the Rgveda (2, 33, 8) was described as a bull. Whatever the much debated ‘original nature’ of Garuda,183 if it is true that Visnu was the god who pervades the sphere surrounding the earth in order to maintain the communication with the celestial regions, a mighty bird, an eagle with outstretched wings, poised motionless in mid-heaven, was a felicitous expression of his columnar nature as the pillar of the universe and of his sustaining, pervasive power.184Proceeding now to the temple ritual,185 I may, to begin with, repeat a statement made by several authors: the daily pursuits of an officiant186 in one temple is on the whole similar to that in others; the rites and ceremonies take place on much the same lines, but with certain dif­ferences due to for instance the fact that Siva is very often adored in an aniconic form,187 this litiga worship being however also a pure ritualistic temple cult. The devapüjä as performed in public for the ‘well-being of the world’188 is moreover, though somewhat more elaborate, largely identical with that executed, for his personal interest, by an initiated and otherwise qualified Hindu. On closer investigation there however appear to exist many differences in details, not only between Saivas and Vaisnavas and, to mention these also, worshippers of other gods, but also between the various Saiva and Vaisnava persuasions among themselves.189 Thus the ritual of the Vaikhänasas is essentially based on the domestic worship as described in their late Vedic grhyasütra (which may date back to the Illrd century A.D.),190 a fact which is in perfect accordance with the conservative character of this community which, in contradistinction to the Päncaratrins, only reluctantly incorporated non-Vedic elements.191 We must even go further; there are, within the same community, interesting regional differences192 and we can be7 6"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"RITUAL77sure that the rites and ceremonies have, everywhere and in almost all communities, been subject, in the course of time, to omissions and additions, to change and transformation.193 The study of these rituals has, moreover, up to recent time been much neglected and the relative texts,194 of which there exists, in India, an abundance, hardly attracted the attention of Sanskrit scholars195 before the last decades. Hence it is clear that the following observations on this point will— like those made on the domestic rites— be eclectic and far from definitive.The Hindu dcvapiijä originally and essentially is an invocation, re­ception and entertainment of God as a royal guest. It normally con­sists of sixteen ‘attendances’ (upacara).196 Despite an unmistakable similarity due to the tendency to conform to this traditional schema there are, as already intimated, interesting differences, even between co-religionists.197 Generally speaking the Sivaite communities were at an earlier date and on a larger scale open to foreign elements and inclined to adopt yoga techniques and Tantrist elements and among the Visnuites it was the Päncarätrins who in this respect put into practice rather advanced ideas.198 That Visnuite tradition which, accepting the Päncarätra views, was between about 900 and 1130 inaugurated by Näthamuni, Yamuna and especially by Ramanuja,199 and which is known as the Sri-Vaisnavas,200 introduced the songs of the Dravidian poets, the Älvärs,201 in their temple ceremonies, holding, up to the present day, these poets and the äcaryas, the great thinkers and teachers, in special veneration. Considering them to be atnias of God they often worship their images in their temples.202 It was also Rämänuja ( ± roso­li 37) who, being convinced that the Visnuite religion and the tra­ditional ritual of the ‘aristocratic orthodoxy’ should be united in perfect harmony, emphasized the preparatory and purificatory signifi­cance of the ritual in addition to meritorious works, devotion (bhakti) and a cheerful disinterested discharge of duties.203 The Southern Sivaites on the other hand consider the collection of the works of their Dravidian poets204 equivalent to the Veda, singing them at home, in the temples and during processions. It was they who in their cult admitted to a much larger scale the dances executed, in honour and support of their dancing god, by the devadâsïs.205As to the language used during the rites, that is the language of the mantras, there have been, in both religions, communities which cling to the traditional Sanskrit and others who use also other languages.206 Generally speaking, the origin and nature of the mantras is either Vedic"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"with or without modifications or Hindu and in the latter case often of unknown origin and very frequently of the Tantric type. An instance of the latter is the Saiva liänamantra : Horn ïsâna-mürdhne namah. In the course of time the bhakti movements changed over to the use of ver­naculars in their preaching and congregational services. The South- Indian Saiva-Siddhänta, on the other hand, presents a case of extreme Tamilization.20?Although numerous acts performed by the arcakas (those qualified for temple worship) are common to many religious groups,208 their motivation does not seem to be the same in every particular tradition.209 Whereas the first phase of the cult, the reverential opening of the temple door and the adoration of the powers presiding over it,210 is, according to Saivas, to secure the building’s protection, the Vaikhänasas take up the keys to destroy thwarting demoniac power and emphasize that the opening of the door211 is equivalent to the opening of heaven, because the temple is God’s abode.212 Man cannot indeed enter into the presence of the Supreme which is established in the cella (garbhagrha) ; he has to undergo a transmutation or regeneration, and this process is promoted by the divine powers carved in the door-jambs, for instance river goddesses, or (often in Visnuite buildings) serpents.213 Several descriptions published so far make mention of the sounding of a bell and of clasping the hands after entering214 the temple in order to chase away the evil powers215 and to draw the god’s attention to his wor­ship.216 After that the arcaka should express his intention to worship and ask God for His consent.217 At this ceremony and all those which are to follow no congregation is present, but devotees may desire to have a dadana, that is to experience, as spectators, the fortifying and benedictive influence radiating from the sacred acts.Turning now to the central ritual acts I begin with the Vai­khänasas, whose sütra text already comprised a form of regular worship of Visnu to take place after an obligatory fire sacrifice.218 In accordance with their doctrine of Visnu’s two forms, the niskala one, i.e. the pri­meval and indivisible form which is unperceivable even by Brahma, and the sakala one, the divisible, emanated and movable,219 they dis­tinguish, inter alia, two cult images, the large immovable220 one which representing God’s niskala form is ritually placed in a sanctuary and elaborately consecrated, and a movable one221 which represents God’s movable form underlying his manifestations. Worship can be per­formed with either image.222 A person who has temporal and eternal78 RITUAL"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"RITUALresults in view should worship with both; if he exclusively strives after eternal results, with an immovable only.223 Before the worship proper he should, moreover, abandon his normal human consciousness and identify himself, in the brahmanyäsa— a combination of medi­tation and nyäsa practice224— with Visnu. Having prepared (that is also, purified) himself and surrendered himself to God and his five manifestations,225 he places the movable image on the bathing pedes­tal226 and proceeds to bathe it elaborately. Then it is considered pre­pared for receiving, by immediate contact by means of a connecting string, the presence of God.227 The accompanying mantra states that now the imperishable origin of All is connected with the perishable and that the Self, knowing God, is released from all evils. All deities who are believed to be present are honoured with flowers.228The invocation229 comprises also the recitation, by the worshipper, of the Ätmasükta, a special Vaikhlnasa hymn of nine stanzas230 in which the identity of his body with the cosmos is emphasized, and the meditation on the analysable Highest Self (sakalaparamätmä),231 the indispensable complement of the concentration on Visnu’s unanalysable (niskala) aspect as Brahman which has preceded. These elements of the rite are to request God to take, in His analysable aspect, His abode in the movable image, so that the world, represented by the worshipper (officiant), will be able to converse with Him. Thereupon the worshipper invokes God to enter without leaving the immovable image, first the pranidhi vessel containing ritually prepared water232 and then, leaving this, the movable image, from which He will, at the end of the cere­mony, be dismissed again into the immovable image.233 This act should be performed with special devotion; then God will descend out of compassion for His devotees.234 The worship proper consists of a püjä ceremony, during which God is honoured as a royal guest, followed by a fire offering (homa) and a bali offering. The object presented may be visible, touchable, audible or eatable.235 An im­portant element of the observances is the preparation and offering of cooked food {havis), God’s principal meal. The purpose of this burnt offering appears from one of the mantras: ‘May I attain that beloved protectorate of His, where men who strive for the divine are exul­ting . .., the source of honey in His highest step (place)’.236 The homa (offering into the fire) which, being of Vedic origin, has, curiously enough, been retained in nearly all extended püjä ceremonies,237 is79"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"8oRITUALstrictly speaking an interruption.238 After that the offered food is taken away to be eaten by the worshipper and distributed among those who might be present (prasada), the site is cleaned, a bali consist­ing of cooked rice sprinkled with butter is offered to God himself239 and a circumambulation240 executed round the temple. At the end of the ceremonies the officiant and his assistants bow to Visnu’s image while pronouncing the Visnusükta, i.c. RV. i, 154.241 After the dakfinä has been given Visnu is, according to the Vaikhänasa-Smärta- sütra (4, il) to be meditated upon as the personal manifestation of the sacrifice— a piece of Vedic belief not repeated in the later treatises of this community— , and to be praised with the Purusasükta.242 Finally a handful of flowers (puspâiijali) is offered to God’s image243 and the temple-door is closed.Turning now to some characteristics of the devapûjâ as performed by the Srî-Vaisnavas, I draw attention to the elaborate purificatory rites to be observed by the arcaka,244 the numerous mantras o f the Hinduist (Tantric) type accompanying its many elements and the so- called sätvikatyäga, a sort of confession in which God is said to be the master of all, the creator, who induces man to'perform ptlja and to offer Him objects created by Him so as to satisfy Him.245 In the course of time this community also adopted the Tantric belief, to which the Vaikhanasas have always been averse, that God comes, during the ptlja ceremonies, also out of the worshipper’s heart.246 The latter’s soul (jiva) is moreover held to leave his body— which as it were has been burnt— and to reach God’s feet in heaven, to descend from there into a new, pure body which is meditatively created. Then he must by a similar procedure mentally put Visnu’s attributes, the club, etc., into his hands. Now247 the arcaka has identified himself with Visnu- Näräyana and is fit to worship. Concentrating himself exclusively on God, he mentally invites Him to occupy the seat on which He is to be bathed and likewise mentally receives and honours Him as a respected guest, and after other nyäsa gestures praises Him, thereupon to purify and so to say to re-create the utensils for the ptlja service. Next, after worshipping the vessels, etc., he proceeds to perform, while concen­trating on the ritual acts and pronouncing mantras,248 the ptljâ proper. He invokes God to approach (ävähana),249 who is supposed to enter a definite vessel (here called ävähanapätra), and is requested to be present till the end of the worship (here known as ärädhana).250 Then he makes the image of Visnu and those of other deities (Srï, BhüdevI) the object"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"RITUAL8lof that worship and meditation afterwards elaborately to attend upon the first, to pray to Him and to bring the piijâ to a close.251The temple worship of Visnu-Vithoba in Pandharpür, Mahârastra,252 though essentially similar, has some characteristics of its own: the rites are performed by a number of specialized ministrants; the daily ceremonies are divided into five services, beginning at three before noon and ending at ten in the evening, each service consisting of a certain piijâ and of several âratïs, that is the devotional waving of various lamps in front of the image. It is the task of one of the ministrants, the haridàsa, to sing suitable hymns. The many pilgrims attracted by the holiness of the temple throw flowers at the image and receive the ttrtha (holy water) and prasäda (holy food) as well as the flowers of the faded garlands and the water used for washing God’s feet.253The temple cult of the Mädhvas, Visnuite in character but much influenced by Sivaite elements,254 likewise deserves a passing notice. Regarding Siva and Visnu as identical they recite the thousand names of the former as well as those of the latter, but show a certain preference for Visnu in that they follow the doctrines of the Bhagavata-Puräna, mark their foreheads with the same symbol as the Bhâgavatas, and attach much value to fasting on the eleventh of every fortnight, the hobest days of the month.255 Their temple ceremonies are characterized by special cleanness and accuracy. The ritual removal of any impurity is the first of the nine elements constituting the daily worship. Visnu shares the homage paid to him with other gods who are regarded as subordinate to him and as pervaded by lois divine being. Hence the presence of Siva, Durgâ, Skanda, GaneSa and others, embodied in their idols, in Visnu’s temples. The true devotee however forgets that it is but an idol to which every honour and every homage conceivable is paid, day after day, with tireless patience and obeisance.256 He rises above all trivialities of daily life and feels himself admitted to the divine Presence and enabled to come, through the image, into spiritual contact with God himself.In order to give an impression of the observances prevailing among other Visnuite communities I may recall that the ritual of the very numerous Krsnaites has likewise developed from Päncarätra origins,257 which in its turn, though adopting many non-Vedic258 elements, had not severed its connections with the Vedic rites.259 No adorer of ^rl-Krsna can begin his daily worship of God in his image260 without a previous application of a tilaka (a distinctive mark) on twelve places"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"82RITUALof his body.261 The material used is gopïcandana, that is a sort o f white clay to be brought from Krsna’s residence Dvaraka.262 The twelve mantras to be pronounced meanwhile combine with a meditation on the same number of God’s aspects.263 The two perpendicular lines on both sides of a point on the forehead are considered to be Krsna’s temple, housing Brahma and Siva at either side o f God who occupies the middle.264 Before and after265 entering the temple the worshipper has to adore God’s associates or attendants (parsada) among whom are Laksmi, Garuda, and again the lord of the site. Authorities disagree with regard to the material of which the sacrificial vessels arc made, some of them rejecting all metals and others holding out prospects of very desirable results if gold or silver is used.266 In any case water poured from a conch is generally preferred.267 The water, mixed in the usual way with sesame seed,268 flowers, rice, etc., which is used in washing God’s feet, in making Him drink, rinse out His mouth, etc., is protected by a special imposition of hands, known as cakramudrä.269The theory and practice of the nyasas has under the influence o f yoga been much elaborated. There is a mätfkanyäsa consisting in the intro­duction of the six parts of God’s body270 into those of the worshipper by means of fifty nasalized sounds corresponding to the petals o f lotus flowers believed to be present in these parts of the image. There is, further, a Kesavanyâsa performed to invoke and introduce the fifty-one aspects of God and the corresponding aspects of His Sakti.271 The very important and indispensable tattvanyäsa,272 to be executed with man­tras beginning with the nasalized sounds of the language and letters of the alphabet in inverse order,273 is to assign soul, life, intelligence, the senses, the elements, etc. and lastly, Vasudeva, Samkarsana, Pradyumna, Aniruddha and Nârâyana to one’s body.According to some authorities274 the adoration of the conch is an essential element of the worship. It is, in a triangular place to the left of the devotee, put on a support, purified with the mantra asträya phat275 which destroys all thwarting influences, filled with water, covered with flowers and sandal and consecrated with mantras. Then fire is adored on the support and sun and moon in the conch. After having invited the holy water (Ganga, Yamunä, etc.) to leave the orb of the sun and Krsna to cease to reside in the heart, the water in the conch is through gazing, imposition of hands and mantras transformed into anifta. This holy liquid is then utilized in adoring Krsna and wash-"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"RITUALing his image.276 After the ablution sandal, flowers, incense and food are offered to Him.277 Other remarkable observances are a meditation on the light which shining forth from God’s face enters the food, a mrajana ceremony (lustration278) consisting in making circles of light before the image, a repeated circumambulation (pradaksina), a pro­stration (pranama) before the image. Finally the holy water is distri­buted among the devotees who drink of it and sprinkle a few drops on their heads.At tills point a Sivaite variety of devapuja calls for closer attention.279 The temple worship in the Tamil speaking South consists of four sandhya celebrations— the last at midnight— and two intermediary services. The ritual for Siva is repeated for his spouse. In each celebration one may distinguish between the image worship which is mainly Tantric in character (the puja proper), fire cult (homa), and ‘festivals’ (1nityot- sava). It would take too long even to mention the numerous elements of the puja and the different stages of its performance. After entering the sanctuary the temple priest (acarpa)280 performs a long series of purificatory and otherwise preparatory281 ritual acts, at the end of which he has transformed himself into Siva,282 because the scriptures say that ‘One should become Siva in order to be able to worship Siva’.283 Some authorities now enjoin a mental worship284 and a sacrifice into the interior fire285 without which the ‘exterior’ rites are senseless. Thereupon the officiant prepares and consecrates the water which is to be offered to God,286 smears the floor in front of God with cow-dung and consecrates a mixture of the five products of the cow (milk, sour milk, butter and the liquid and solid excreta). He also makes amrta287— I have already referred to this curious rite— , invokes Siva to be present in the middle one of five pots (avahana) filled with a mixture of milk, fruit, honey, etc., invites other gods, worships the litiga in the central part of the sanctuary288 with the five products of the cow, the five ‘nectars’ contained in the other pots and the sacred bathing water. When everything is ready for the daily worship to begin the sun (Surya), whose orb is permeated by Sadasiva,289 is, according to many autho­rities to be adored first,290 the relative nyasa rites and mantras transforming the acarpa into that luminary, which is, moreover, invoked to be present and to accept offerings and prayers. ‘The Sun indeed is God’s sahala aspect, Siva being niskala; therefore the wise adore first the corporeal one, then God (that is, His83"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"84RITUALPassing over the following items of ritual (worship of Ganesa,292 cleaning the litiga, etc.293) I only mention the special piijä to the ädhärasakti,294 the power supporting the universe residing in the prime­val tortoise,295 here represented by the tortoise-like stone bottom of the pedestal on which the litiga, ‘God’s crystalline form’,296 is fixed;29/ and the worship of Siva’s lion-seat298 or throne,299 on which the worshipper must, in his mind, install300 God pure like crystal, that is in His highest crystalline, that is formless, aspect of Sadäsiva, after having, in a complicated rite, invocated Him. Commentators301 observe that the process is not inconsistent with God’s omnipresence: God is not absent, and the ävähana is only to make Him direct His special attention to the worshipper.302 Then the worshipper, declaring that he belongs to God makes— again by a tundra— sure of God’s uninterrupted pre­sence,303 which is nothing else but God’s accepting of this act of self­surrender.304 Thereupon the acarya executes the rite of sakali-karatia305 with regard to God’s manifestation, that is, he assigns by means of mantras— which are divine— and imposition of hands divinity to it. Siva, being meditated upon as a form of light, is then as Sadäsiva to appear306 above the litiga. He is given water for washing his feet, etc., and made the object of a very elaborate ablution (abhiseka) with the five products of the cow, the five ‘nectars’ and the water mixed with bael flowers (which are sacred to him), etc.307 Among the other rites which must, or may, be performed are the adoration of God’s limbs in four directions;308 offering of food (naivedya)309— which is not con­sidered fit to be eaten by the worshippers— and drinking-water (toya) to God and His retinue; the fivefold worship of the gods housed in the precincts surrounding the central shrine; the worship of the twenty- five ‘realities’ or ‘real principles’ (tattvärcanä),310 followed by the muttering or recitation of the ttullamantra, which is to be repeated one hundred and eight times and to be accompanied by offerings and prayers for the attainment of the objects desired by the performer of the rite.311The fire ritual (nityahoma) which is to follow is a very detailed cere­mony of distinct character held to be obligatory for those who wish to attain to final emancipation.312 Carrying the vessel with arghya water313 the worshipper makes for the fireplace,314 which is carefully— and of course ritually— prepared to receive Agni.

Fire is procured in accordance with the prescripts,316 worshipped with the mulamantra and ‘united’ with the fire of the mulädhara, i.e. the lowermost power centre (cakra)317 and with that of the bitidu in the forehead.318 Thus the worshipper enacts his unification with the fire in which now Agni’s spirit (caitanya) is introduced. The fire is thereupon transformed into antrta,319 worshipped and regarded as Siva’s seed, and then emitted by Vagïsvara into Vagïsvarï’s womb.After the firc-in-the-womb has been adored and various measures have been taken to protect it the so-called sacraments (samskaras)320 to be performed for the unborn and young child in order to fortify it and to make it fit to enter the next stage in its development,321 are executed through symbolic actions. When the fire child, which is thus completely treated as an embryo, is in the tenth month considered to have been born, and the defilements of birth have been removed322 it is, after several other ritual acts,323 meditated upon. Now the wor­shipper, soul and mind, shares in the process which is taking place. While considering himself identical with Brahma, Visnu and Rudra successively, and simultaneously performing the three ceremonies of establishing the fire, putting on the vessel and dismissal, he purifies and consecrates sacrificial butter324 and sprinkles with it the faces of young Agni, who then receives the name of Sivägni. His parents, Vâgïsvarï and Vagïsvara, are honourably dismissed, and Siva is invoked to be present in the heart of the fire, seated on his throne, brilliant and supreme, worshipped and offered food. After that the worshipper must unite the arteries of his (yogic) body (nòdi)325 with those of Siva-of-the- tcmplc and of Siva-of-thc-firc, creating a sort of luminous circuit between these and proceed to perform the fire sacrifice (homa), con­sisting of oblations of ghee, and accompanied by offerings of fried rice grain, sugar-cane, flowers, etc. Finally he installs Siva-of-the-fire326 in his own heart and after some other observances returns to the temple to implore God to accept the püjä, the homa and the merit produced by these.327Although the ritual manuals are not quite explicit on this point,328 the meaning of the performance is clear. It is, by means of techniques partly Vedic, partly purânic and partly Tantric, the enactment,329 in a gradual process of development, of the realization of the unity of the worshipper’s soul,330 the place and material for worship and God, who is the only recipient of worship, who can be worshipped only by85"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"86RITUALthose who realize their identity with Him, and to whom therefore accrue not only the homage and the oblations, but also the merit earned by them, which is, as a deposit entrusted to His keeping for the sake of His worshipper.331 For bliss and heaven, if not emancipation,332 is the ultimate aim of those who perform the ritual.333"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"VThe Mutual Relations of the Two ReligionsIn instituting a comparison between Visnuism and Sivaism which since the beginning of our era arc, in India, the two most prominent religious currents and communities,1 it docs not seem to be out of place briefly to recall also their interrelations, the interchange of ideas, their friendly and unfriendly contacts, the opinions they fostered of each other.It is, to begin with, interesting to notice that in the Rgveda Rudra and Visnu, excepting two eases one of which is insignificant, maintained no direct relations with each other. No mention is made of Visnu in the hymns addressed to Rudra, no reference to Rudra found in the texts dedicated to Visnu.2 Only once the outsider god, ‘conscious of his greatness as Rudra’, seems, as also on other occasions, to be sent away with an oblation, after or during an offering presented to Visnu,3 but this coincidence docs not point to intimate relations. In other celebrations of the Visvc Devah the two gods, sharing the eulogies with several other divinities are not mentioned in the same stanza,4 or their mere names occur in collective invocations of a number of gods.5 In a hymn dedicated to the Maruts, the sons of Rudra6 (5, 87),7 these deities are, it is true, described as being the satellites of Visnu— like this deity these storm gods dwell in the mountains8 and traverse the spaces— but more important is Rgveda 4, 3, 7, expressing an op­position between Visnu, the god of the seed (retali), that is of generation, and the firm missile weapon of Rudra, who, being here identical with Agni, represents destruction.9About the other Vcdic samhitäs there is in this connection nothing to be said.10 Nor do I remember any passage in the brähmanas worth mentioning unless we would discuss also the insertion of a stanza addressed to Rudra after the recitation of a hymn containing the names of Visnu and other gods.11 Let us not be misled by this practice which is continued in later times, when in definite milieus one god has risen"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"to prominence. The adoration of Näräyana as the Highest Being, the conviction that only through the grace of this god it is possible to realize one’s oneness with Brahman and to gain immortality docs not exclude the invocation of deities considered to be of minor rank and position, for instance Rudra, whose assistance and co-operation may be deemed necessary.12 Another point which is perhaps not always suffi­ciently stressed is this: a preacher or a visionary who has gone into ec­stasies over the indescribable glory of the Highest Being, feeling himself unable to choose between several divine names, designates the source and creator of All-at. Visnu, Siva, Brahma, etc.:13 the Highest Being is more than each individual god who is no more than one of the manifestations of His omnipotence. This does not mean that the author wavers between Saivism, Vaisnavism or other religions.It is not before the beginning of the Christian era, or what may broadly speaking be called epic times, that Sivaism— which as a definite religious group with its own tenets and theology can hardly be shown to have existed before that period14— and Visnuism— some components of which must have adopted the character of religious communities in at least the Und century B.C.15— definitely became, at least in our sources, more prominent than other cults and might be said to have entered into more or less distinct and definite relations which led to more or less regular forms of co-existence. In studying these relations it should always be borne in mind that, however prominently these two religions were to figure in the so-called epic and early puränic periods, they were not alone in satisfying the religious needs, interests and aspirations of the Indian people at large. The Vedic gods were not forgotten within the space of a few centuries16 and Vedic rituals con­tinued to be performed by a section of the people. The propagation of Visnuite and Sivaite beliefs did not prevent the mass of smärta Hindus17 from worshipping, or meditating on, other deities regarded as their equals, together with the two great gods.18 In addition to this form of Hinduism there existed some other cults,19 whether or not allied with Vedic gods or derived from Vedic forms of worship, the whole constituting an interesting medley of cults and beliefs which defies any systematic classification.20 It is also worth noticing that even the names of Siva and Visnu are far from being regularly included in epic lists of divine names, invocations or references to gods.21 One should not rashly explain22 such facts integrally from a tendency intentionally to exclude the god worshipped by another religious88 MUTUAL RELATIONS OF THE TWO RELIGIONS"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"group, resulting— after a Visnuite and a Sivaite recast of the same text— in the absence of both deities. There always were real social and regional differences23 and changes in religious conditions, and the spread of Visnuism and Sivaism, though steady and constant, must have been slow and gradual.In view of my present purpose another point is, however, of special relevance. Although the Bombay edition of the Rämäyana contains many references to Siva and Visnu, these gods are not invoked to­gether. This may, to a certain extent, be a reflection of reality: how­ever many gods were worshipped conjointly, there is, in this work also, unmistakable evidence of trends in religious practice which at a later date were to culminate in the existence of distinct and fully developed Visnuite and Sivaite communities and religions.As to the world of the great epic— I intentionally refrain from saying : epic times— Hopkins’24 recapitulation of the relevant facts may, in general, be subscribed to. Both Siva and Visnu are, alternatively and within the discretion of the authors, recognized as chief gods;25 both eventually represent God. As such, as the All, Visnu may also act as the destroyer. Siva’s character remains essentially true to that of the ancient Rudra, but he receives new fame and features which are illustrated by various narrative episodes. His appearances are, it is true, rare, but when he docs, in the Mahabharata, appear on the scene, Krsna, when present, invariably seems to recede from the first place: together with Arjuna he visits and praises Siva who gives Arjuna the pähipata weapon; Krsna gratifies him at the tîrtha Badari and declares him to be the creator of all.26 After having practised, in the Himalayas, severe austerities Näräyana, realizing his identity with Brahman, obtained a vision of Siva, the master and origin of the universe, the supreme deity, smaller than the smallest and larger than the largest, Rudra, Hara, Sambhu, the infuser of life in every form and the all-destroyer, the source of immortality, whose body is the universe, who can only be seen, with their mind’s eye, by brahmans of pure conduct and cleansed from sins. Näräyana, after having obtained this vision, became filled with delight and proceeded to praise and worship that divine Lord.27 Elsewhere in the same epic (13, a. 14) it is Krsna, who after going through a dikfä ceremony and severe austerities, succeeds in the sixth month in obtaining a vision of Siva surrounded by all the gods, among whom were Indra and Visnu. Krsna praises him as the supreme deity and receives eight boons of the god and eight more of Urna.28 One of these7—v.s.MUTUAL RELATIONS OF THE TWO RELIGIONS 89"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"boons is, curiously enough, the close proximity o f Siva. Nevertheless, the compilers of the great epic have been largely instrumental in propa­gating Visnuism and Krsnaism. In the Ramayana Siva, designated by several names and, here also, the performer o f some well-known feats, is as a rule not regarded as higher than the devas.29Yet there does not seem to exist some special antagonism between the two religions. ‘Theological animus, lacking political aims, appears to be in abeyance.’ For, although Kaurava adherents of Sivaism scorn the claims of Krsna to be regarded as God,30 the eternal Visnu himself, this attitude seems to be dictated by what may, broadly speaking, be called political reasons.31 Draupadi, while eulogizing Krsna as the Highest Principle and complaining of the contumely offered to her by the Kauravas, expresses the opinion that Krsna plays with Siva and other gods as with a toy: an obvious comparison o f might and influence of both gods (Mbit. 3, a. 13). Even when Sudyumna, as a result of the wrath of Lord Siva, was transformed into a woman, the rsis wishing to restore him to his sex, prayed to Visnu, who granted their request.32 The king of the Yavanas, who according to the puranic legend, advanced with many barbarians against Krsna and Mathura, was bom after his father had succeeded in propitiating Siva.33In a similar way, the epic combatants, generally speaking, appear to have different faiths.34 It is certainly not due to mere chance that in the Uttarakânda of the Ramayana— which in its enlarged form has been called35 ‘the first of all Visnuite scriptures’— Ravana is depicted as a devotee of Siva,36 taking with him a golden litiga which lie worshipped with flowers and incense. ‘Thus the rdksasa paid homage to it which was the highest, the giver of boons, and the destroyer of the sufferings of people of correct behaviour.’37 That, on the other hand, Kausalyä paid also homage to Siva and that Rama’s brahmin arc said to have worshipped this god38 on the occasion of the performance of the Asvamedha rite, may be a reflection of the reality known to the author of these passages.39The same form of antagonism is apparent from legends about sup­porters and opponents of the two religions. In these £iva, living up to his reputation, sometimes sides with the demons, whereas Visnu acts as the champion of the gods.40 Already in the Mahäbhärata reference is made to the asura Bana, the son of Bali, a follower of Rudra and an enemy of Visnu who eventually killed him in battle.41 In the Visnu- Purâna— which in any case is one of the oldest compositions of this90 MUTUAL RELATIONS OF THE TW O RELIGIONS"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"M UTUAL RELATIONS OF THE TWO RELIGIONS91genre, dating back to, perhaps, the IVth century A.D.— the story is told in full detail, that is, probably, enriched with Visnuite material.42 Through the agency of the goddess Pârvatï43 Bäna’s daughter Osa fell in love with Aniruddha, the grandson of Krsna, and had him con­veyed to her by magic art. In the meantime Bòna solicited Siva for war, because he felt depressed by having a thousand arms in a prolonged state of peace. His wish was fulfilled, because prince Aniruddha, whose presence in the palace was discovered, slew Bäna’s servants, sent to arrest him. As he was unable to subdue him by prowess, Bäna succeeded in capturing the youth with his mäyä, that is his supernormal deceptive faculty. Being informed of these events Krsna, his brother Baladeva and his son Pradyumna set off for Bäna’s city, but on their approach they were opposed by a mighty Mahcsvara, i.e. an emanation from Siva-, called Fever, who however was defeated by a Counter- Fever engendered by Krsna himself. After some other heroic feats Bäna appears to have received the assistance of Siva and his son Skanda, the general of the gods. A fierce combat ensued between Hari-Visnu and Sankara-^iva; the denizens of heaven felt that the end of the uni­verse was drawing near. O f the vicissitudes of the battle pictured in absorbing particulars I only mention Krsna’s use of the weapon of yawning with which he disabled Siva, overcome with incessant gaping. When, after several other feats of heroism, Krsna was about to put Bäna to death with his discus Sudarsana and had already lopped off his arms, Siva approached him to solicit a suspension of hostilities, ad­dressing him as the lord of the world and highest Purusa, and asking him to be propitious because he, Siva, had given Bäna, his old devotee, assurance of safety. Thereupon Krsna, dismissing his resentment against the asura, looked graciously on his antagonist and said: ‘Since you, Sankara, have given a boon to Bäna, let him live; from respect to your promises my discus is arrested. The assurance of safety granted by you is granted also by me. You are fit to apprehend that you are not distinct from me. W e are identical with each other as is the whole world with us. Only because they are stupified by ignorance men contemplate distinctions.’ Having spoken thus, Krsna freed his grandson from his fetters and returned home, together with his brother, son, grandson and Osa.There can be little doubt that Wilson44 was in the main right in surmising that this narrative— which in various degrees of detail is also found in several other puränas45— reflects, as far as its general tendency"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"is concerned, historical reality. I would not however say that it de­scribes a definite serious struggle between both persuasions, but rather that it attests to the existence of antagonism and animosity in those circles which invented and reproduced the story.46 W e can indeed be sure that historical reality did not always answer to the mild catho­licity often prevailing in epic literature or to the eulogistic descriptions of royal impartiality which, being a favourite topic o f kävya authors, is not infrequently attested to by epigraphic and iconographie sources.47Hinduism has often been described as very tolerant, and there is from certain points of view and in comparison with other civiliza­tions, for instance European history, a considerable clement of truth in this judgement. Yet there is some room for reserve. W e should admit that there have been exceptions; we should not mistake the theories of the dharma books and their doctrine that the king should be impartial and well-disposed towards all denominations, even to the heretics,48 with the daily practice of the population in general.49 W e should also distinguish between doctrinal and practical tolerance. As to the latter an answer to the question as to how far Indians of different creeds were, in different times and regions, inclined to tolerate, and show forbearance to, opinions and forms of worship which they did not share themselves, can be given only with reserve and many delicate distinctions.50 It is for instance worth noticing that the rules of ritual purity to be observed with respect to contact with those who repudiate the authority of the Veda were sometimes also applied to the Sivaitc Päsupatas, who seem to have been the oldest form of Sivaism prevalent in North India. If, for instance, a man touched Buddhists, Jainas, materialists, südras, and Päsupatas he should, in order to purify himself, bathe with his clothes on.51 This discrimination against the Päsupatas52 shows that they were suspect because of their ritual practices, and, in general, of their particular manners and customs. In an interpolated epic passage53 they are described as defying54 the dharma of the varnas and âéramas (the social classes and the stages in life), although in a very few cases they agree with it; their way of living and some of their ritual customs obviously gave offence to people of other persuasions.55 Some authorities went so far as to prescribe purificatory rites after touching 6aivas in general and after entering Buddhist or Sivaite sanctuaries.56 Others even included other Saiva groups— Bhairavas, Käpälikas, Vämas— among the censurable and blameworthy, their92 MUTUAL RELATIONS OF THE TWO RELIGIONS"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"MUTUAL RELATIONS OF THE TWO RELIGIONS93books being meant for deluding the world.57 The outbursts of aver­sion58 were especially borne towards the Käpälikas59 whose dress and manners were, in the eyes of the differently minded, very repulsive. Puränic stories were invented to warn people against violating the rules of the varnäsramadharma:60 ‘Käpälikas and various others holding themselves followers of some deva or other will’, according to descrip­tions of the Kali age,61 ‘corrupt the dharma’,62 and work the ruin of man and world. The Visnuite Päilcarätras, of whom the Päsupatas— for a certain period probably their most formidable rivals— are assumed to be the Sivaite counterpart,63 are likewise added to the list of those who falsely pretend to be traditional Hindus (päsandas).64 Even caste­less Visnuites rank in the view of these exponents of pure Hinduism higher than non-Visnuite brahmans.65With regard to their attitude towards the other great religious com­munity we find, generally speaking, a characteristic trend on both sides. In social intercourse Visnuism tends to be passively intolerant,66 that means: a Vaisnava should avoid direct contact with the Saivas but not injure them or prejudice their rights. An adherent of Visnu should consider the others unworthy to perform rites; he should not ritually behave like a Saiva; he should purify himself and subject himself to an atonement for receiving a non-Vaisnava priest as a guest, eating with him, honouring him, or employing him, because such a man is contemptible everywhere. A true Vaisnava should be ekäntin, i.e. ‘devoted to only one goal or god’67 and disinclined to permit the cult of another god beside Visnu. This attitude o f‘exclusivism’ (ekantibhava) is strongly opposed by the Saivas68 who sometimes go so far as to hold out a prospect of hell to those who exclude Siva from divine honours. But the Vaisnava who recites a mantra received from a non-Vaisnava guru will likewise for millions of years be cooked in the fire of hell.69 In daily practice this attitude often entails attempts to consider Siva a great deity of secondary importance and to subordinate him to Visnu. This explains why in an avowedly Visnuite book70 an exposition is made also of the worship of Siva, Durgä and other deities, although they rank below Visnu: they are represented as his attendants.One should indeed have no scruples about the divine personality of Siva, but one should avoid adoring him as a greaty deity in his own right. Attaching an obvious meaning to name-giving exclusive Vis­nuites of higher rank and station do not like to call the god who com­petes with Visnu for the highest position by his principal name §iva,"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"but prefer Rudra, Sankara, or one o f his other names.71 This aversion is not rarely mutual: brahmans belonging to some Saiva or Vaisnava communities would not even mutter the names of each other's gods.72 It would not however be warranted to assume that also on the Vis- nuite side there has never been malice and hard-handedness. The lower in the social scale did not miss the opportunity from time to time to come to fisticuffs. In an XVIIIth-century Tamil work describing an altercation of the wives of a low caste man, one being a Vaisnava and the other a Saiva, both gods are dragged into the quarrel in a most unseemly way.73 The French priest Dubois,74 who in the first quarter of the XIXth century lived for over thirty years in Pondicherry, even speaks of numerous troops of religious mendicants and vagabonds always ready to provoke each other and to hurl gross and obscene abuse75 at each other’s heads. But at the end of his vivid description he adds that their field of battle only rarely is sprinkled with blood.It is, indeed, no wonder that legend and history inform us of various forms of unfriendly contact,76 such as controversial discussion and struggle for superiority, not only between Hindus and outsiders but also between Saivas and Vaisnavas. Both communities, indeed, though largely worshipping their god in the general Hindu way, claimed to revere the true or supreme manifestation of the Highest. Thus Vis- nuite tradition has it that the poet (älvär77) Tirumangai— the same who was miraculously converted78 to Visnuism after hearing a mantra from a man whom he, as a waylayer, had robbed79— was invited by the great Saiva saint Jnänasambandha for a religious discussion, which he accepted with the result that he vanquished his Saiva adversary without difficulty.80 It is on the other hand interesting to see that among the stereotyped features of the Kaliyuga is, in puränic treatises, the defamation of the own god by the rival community.81 This was, obviously, not regarded as good behaviour.Nor is it however surprising that we must except the Päncarätrins, who in many other circles had a doubtful reputation. They showed a sort of tolerance which, with Professor Hacker of Münster, may be called inclusive:82 the worship of other gods is, in their view, to be regarded as an indirect way ultimately leading to their own God. There are, according to their manuals, five recognized systems, namely that of the Veda, the Sämkhya, the Yoga, the Päiupata— i.e. the younger so-called form of agamic Saivism— and the Sättvata or Päflcarätra,94 MUTUAL RELATIONS OF THE TWO RELIGIONS"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"the remaining doctrines of Jainas, Buddhists, etc., being fallacious and founded by gods or brahmarsis in order to spread confusion among the wicked.83In this the Päncarätrins resemble the Saivas who have very often taken, with regard to those who follow other gods, the standpoint which has been characterized as an inclusivism admitting that dissen­tient views are to a greater or lesser extent true. Thus, according to a Sivaite authority,84 Visnu-Krsna is the eternal highest ätman, endowed with the incomprehensible and divine creative power called tttäyä, enjoying everything; nevertheless he worships Siva, believing that the essence of this god is completely contained in his litiga. To §iva he owes his invincibility in the universe.Something more must therefore be said now on this point which is among the most characteristic features of Hinduism. I mean the ten­dency to what has been called inclusivism, a term which should be distinguished from adaptation and syncretism. The Indian adherent of a definite view of life does not as a rule explicitly combat and integrally reject the opinions and institutions of other religious communities. His philosophers may often feel inclined to polemize and to argue against different opinions, the Hindu generally respects these to a cer­tain extent, because they represent a view of, or at least some aspects of, truth and reality, or just because they exist and belong to the traditions of definite groups of people. But he denies that they are as excellent and efficacious as his own doctrine. They may, it is true, suffice for people of a lower social, moral or intellectual standard, but they do not lead himself and his co-religionists to their goal, or not far enough on their way to the goal.85 Thus one does not easily reject a definite unfamiliar form of devotion, or argue that a strange doctrine is fundamentally incorrect; one rather regards them as inadequate and insufficient. When one finds oneself confronted with spiritual currents of prestige one may go further. Since Hindu thinkers often find little difficulty in absorbing almost anything extraneous into their own system and in assimilating ideas that seem to be of value or to have affinity with their own trains of thought, they are even inclined to include and completely to incorporate a foreign system into their own, declaring it to represent the next best doctrine,86 reinterpreting its mythology, symbolism and metaphysics, and accepting its god as a servant or manifestation of their Highest Being.87 On the mythological plane the Sivaite puränas, which were generally speaking inclined to what has been called ‘aM UTUAL RELATIONS OF THE TWO RELIGIONS 95"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"tendency to compromise’,88 could in this way regard Visnu and Brahma as Siva’s servants and allow their cults.89This remarkable tendency has no doubt been promoted by the essen­tially kindred and congenial doctrine of the Trimürti, the triune unity of Brahma, Visnu and Siva as aspects and manifestations of the Highest Being90 which, of course, in Visnuite eyes was Visnu, in Sivaite opinion Siva.91 Thus dominant Saivism was already at an early date able to cover,92 include and adopt, not to reconcile and syncretize, Vaisnavism by accepting Visnu as one of the components of the Trinity and putting him on a par with the other members Brahma and Rudra-Siva.93In illustration of this tendency to adopt foreign gods and cults and to display what might impress us as a conciliatory attitude towards the other great religion attention may be drawn to an interesting sample of puranic theology. The Kürma-Puräna— of uncertain date, but before iooo A.D.— is, despite its title, a Saiva work, in which Visnu, it is true, is occasionally eulogized, but, like Brahma, only as a form of the unique supreme god Siva. One of the most interesting sections of this puräna is the ïsvaragltâ (n, i-i i),94 a Sivaite imitation of the Bhagavadgïtâ,95 which must have been very popular, not only among Sivaites but also among adepts of the Yoga and Sämkhya schools.96 Here it is the Highest Lord, Siva, himself who in the famous hermitage at Badarikä97 expounds his doctrine, of salvation to twelve fsis. This doctrine is a clever attempt at harmonizing, in a spirit of conciliation, Saiva theism, the bhakti theory, yoga, epic Sämkhya philosophy98 and the main tenets of the upanisadic tradition. This spirit of conciliation is especially apparent in the author’s attitude towards the Supreme Being: he adores Siva, but venerates also Visnu. The narrator of the episode, Vyäsa, is requested to expound the doctrine which, dealing exclusively with Brahman, leads to final emancipation as taught previously by Visnu the tortoise, but it is Rudra-Siva to whom he pays obeisance before beginning his expositions. He tells his audience that in the days of yore a party of fsis, after severe austerities, received the favour of a vision of Visnu-Näräyana, the best knower of yoga, the soul of the universe, the eternal ; they asked him, the only knower of the highest secret, to inform them about the origin of the universe, that which is subject to samara, the nature of the ätman and final emancipation, the cause of transmigration and who is the lord who watches everything (i, 26 f.). But before Näräyana could answer Siva-Mahädeva appears who is immediately praised by the fsis and addressed as the soul of the96 MUTUAL RELATIONS OF THE TWO RELIGIONS"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"universe (i, 34). 6 iva embraces Visnu99 and asks him why the f$is have assembled and what he might do for them. Visnu informs him and invites him to expound the divine knowledge, adding that he, Siva, is the only one who is qualified for that task, that is for explaining his own nature and essence. Then a celestial throne comes down on which both gods sit down and Siva, while looking at Visnu,100 begins to speak. It strikes us that also in the episode of Siva’s dance, in which he as the Highest Being displays his divine energies (ch. 5), and which is the counterpart of the famous epiphany of the Bhagavadgltä, Visnu is near to him (5, 2). Further on (5, 15) Indra and Visnu are said to pay homage to him, and in a moment the spectators sec Näräyana, the origin of the world, become one with the Lord (5, 16) who then is described as being Brahma, Visnu and the most excellent Supreme Being and Highest Lord (Paramcsthin, 5, 30; 35).101 That all divine personages arc in reality Siva is not left unmentioned: (5, 33) ‘The sages say that Thou art the unique Rudra, Hari, Agni, the Lord, the eternal Rudra, Air, Äditya . . .’, but the identity of Siva and Visnu is especially emphasized : at the end of his expositions the former, while committing the promulgation of his doctrine to the care of his col­league,102 explicitly declares the latter, Näräyana, identical with him­self,103 adding that the doctrine should be taught (exclusively) to those who are convinced of this identity. ‘M y highest embodiment, which, being gentle and imperishable, resides in all beings and is their attuati, is called Näräyana. Those who regard both gods as different will never obtain final emancipation, but those who believe them to be identical will never be reborn. That is why the eternal Visnu should be honoured and regarded as Siva himself. For emancipation will be given to those who take refuge with Siva without disregarding Visnu.’ And elsewhere (4, 25): ‘Those who are devout worshippers of Hari while propitiating me, they also come to me and do not come back to this world’. And so it is not surprising to read in another chapter (9,9) that that highest divine presence is identical with Visnu’s highest ‘ step ’ or ‘abode’ (vistioh paramani padani).Strange though it at first sight might seem, these great gods did not hesitate to praise and adore each other, or to try to win the other’s favour.104 Thus Visnu is in Sivaite circles related to have offered, every day, a thousand lotus flowers to Siva’s feet; when, one day, he was short by one he extracted one of his lotus-like eyes.105 A Päsupata tradition has it that Visnu-Krsna worshipped §iva for a son,106 but theM UTUAL RELATIONS OF THE TWO RELIGIONS 97"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Pâncarâtras say107 that Siva first adored Nârâyana who, at the former’s prayer, granted the boon that he would worship Siva for a favour. Many passages of this character are indeed obvious attempts at raising one’s own god over the other or at baffling similar attempts of the adversaries rather than attempts at conciliation.108It may therefore, broadly speaking, be observed that— in spite of the tension and competition between the two gods and their worshippers which in the post-epic period there is throughout— the authors of the puränas, whether they were Saivas or Vaisnavas, assigned the rival god a particular and privileged place in the pantheon. Not rarely the order in which statements about a plurality of gods are made, precedence accorded to one of them,109 or numerical relations occurring in this connection provide good ground for ascertaining the author’s esti­mation of their relative importance.110 Thus in the Agni-Puräna (38, 8) it reads: ‘By erecting one sanctuary one goes to heaven; by making three one goes to the world of Brahma; by making five one goes to the world of Sambu (Siva); by making eight one will abide in the region of Hari.’111 An interesting passage112 occurs in the Sivaite Saura-Puräna— which may have been compiled between about 1000 and 1200 A.D. :113 Siva is on the authority of sruti and other scriptures114 the highest god. The man who truly knows the Lord Who is to be known through the Vedanta, the husband of Pârvatï, is Visnu-Vai- kuntha; the man who duly believes Vaikuntha to be the lord is Indra- Puramdara; the man who considers Indra to be the lord of all, is a fsi.115 However, without recognizing Siva as the supreme Lord eman­cipation is impossible. In a similar passage the same purana adds, in answer to the question as to why so many people have fallen away from Saivism to become adorers of Visnu, that Siva himself, pleased with Visnu’s devotion for him, had conceded him the privilege of being the highest god of a minority of men.116 Or we might learn something from the story narrated in the same book (a. 41) : the gods resort to Visnu for help, Visnu praises Siva who, after putting him to the test, grants him the discus and invincibility. Or the relative rank assigned to divine persons may be understood from their successive appearances in a narrative, the success of their activities, etc. In a §ivaite context a monster which is eventually slain by Durgä will, for instance, be given occasion to conquer, among other gods, Visnu.117The higher position or greater power of either god118 or their tem­porary friendly or unfriendly relations are often illustrated by more or98 MUTUAL RELATIONS OF THE TWO RELIGIONS"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"less casual remarks or references, explanations added by an author to an episode of his work, etc. According to an interpolated stanza in the Mahabharata119 Visnu is the only one who is able to see Siva when the latter, blazing like the fire which at the end of a yuga destroys the universe, sports, as Purusa, with Prakrti and nobody, no other god, not even the lotus-born Brahma or Siva, is able to fathom the depth of Visnu’s maya, his inscrutable creative power.120 Elsewhere Rudra is said to appear on Krsna’s breast and Brahma on his forehead, when he, after having burst out into a loud laughter, produced from his body, which resembled a blazing fire, myriads of gods, not bigger than his thumb {Mbh. 5, 129, 4).121One should not however treat all Visnuites and all Sivaites alike. There are nuances and variations in the opinions of, and attitudes towards, the rival persuasions. The Vaisnava school founded by.Madhva (probably 1199-1298)122 is on the one hand of the opinion that the whole Veda is not only Visnu’s revelation but also an explanation of his nature. The undeniable facts that that corpus contains also in­numerable references to other gods and that smrti texts often proclaim Siva the Highest Being are explained away, cither by the application of the principle that all passages which are inconsistent with the doctrine of Visnu’s uniqueness and omnipotence arc to be regarded as lacking the sanction of authority, or by an interpretative method based on the axiom that all authoritative scriptures teach Visnu’s absolute supremacy. The first category of texts has, it is held, been composed, at Visnu’s command, by Siva in order to confuse the minds of men and to draw a distinction between the truly faithful and the adherents of false doctrines.123 Siva is even Visnu’s creature and endowed by him with special destructive power because he has to bring about the periodical reabsorption of the universe.124 It is, on the other hand, Madhva’s contention that Siva, like Brahma and the other gods, is penetrated with Visnu’s essence and therefore is worthy of adoration, provided that the worshipper is conscious of this fact and docs not identify Siva or other gods with Visnu or consider them as equals, because those who nurse these erroneous ideas work their own destruction.125 That is why the Mädhvas accord also worship to Siva and visit his sanctuaries. According to the biography of their founder the god obviously recipro­cated this homage, because Madhva was, on his initiative, splendidly entertained on the occasion of a visit to the sacred place Hrsîkeéa.126 Accordingly, the famous Saiva monastery at Srhgiri in Mysore, whichM UTUAL RELATIONS OF THE TWO RELIGIONS 99"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"was founded by Sankara, and the Mädhva temple of Udipi main­tained friendly relations.127These facts could not however prevent Saiva leaders from engaging in polemics. This may have been their reaction to a piece o f active intolerance on Madhva’s side. This Visnuitc teacher, while promoting the institution of debates between the representatives of different creeds, advised the Vaisnavas present to prevent a dissentient speaker from scoring a triumph; besides, the king was expected to punish an un­successful and non-conforming opponent, who of course never was a Vaisnava.128 In an interesting section of the Sivaitc Saura-Puräna129 we are told that the realm of the ‘orthodox’ king Pratardana was so completely free from all unsocial and anti-traditional people that Yama and other gods felt annoyed, because there were no longer evil­doers to be punished. Reluctantly, it is true, they ordered a kimnara,130 disguised as a Visnuitc, to exterminate the cult of Siva.131 Nobody in the kingdom discovered the imposture and many influential people joined the movement started by the kimnara who preached Siva’s subordination to Visnu and refused to pay homage to those brahmans who wear the distinctive marks of Sivaitc communities: Visnu is the only God proclaimed by the Veda, Siva is a cruel and barbarous deity, the ashen garment and the rosary of his adherents are worthless. The kimnara s scornful description of Siva as a frequenter of places where corpses wait for cremation, as a nudist adorned with ropes of snakes132 elicits the king’s reply that the god has many forms unknown to men. Yet the ruler thinks him a blockhead rather than a deceiver. Meanwhile, as a result of the neglect of Siva’s cult, the hells are filled again and the world is on the point of perishing. Visnu wakes up and is requested by Laksmi to stop the general ruin. He however answers that Siva is his lord and that there are many beings of his own rank. The only un­forgivable sin is contempt for Siva. Then the divine couple goes to Mount Kailäsa to praise Siva, to whom the gods apologize for their fraudulence, and the kimnara is decapitated. The rest of the story is narrated in the form of a prophecy. In the Kali period the illegitimate son of a brahman called Madhu, a notorious hater of Siva, will intro­duce a heresy. Now, illegitimacy, being practically identical with ex- communication, played an important part in these polemics; the South, being for the greater part unaryan and incompletely brahmanized, was an in many respects ritually impure region and Madhva’s name was, probably on purpose, mutilated. The followers of this teacher have only100 MUTUAL RELATIONS OF THE TWO RELIGIONS"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"the outward appearance of human beings, in reality they are on the way to hell. Surrendering themselves to detestable vices and more depraved than Buddhists or Jainas, they defile everybody who comes into contact with them. Studying the scriptures only with a view to detect errors they believe in a system without a sound foundation, viz. the doctrine that there is nothing else but mäyä, and that the samsara is real and essential. This objection and their stigmatization as disguised Cärväkas133 were no doubt based on the author’s interpreta­tion of Madhva’s standpoint that the phenomenal universe is a reality. Opposing these false doctrines with determination the compiler of the Saura-Puràna maintains that all great founders of schools and authori­tative manuals of Hindu philosophy, Jaimini, Kapila, Patanjali, the puränas and itihäsas, despite some mutual contradictions in matters of secondary importance, assign to Siva a rank higher than the highest.Yet the Hindu is inclined to revere the divine whatever its manifesta­tion and so Sivaitcs are nevertheless strongly dissuaded from vilifying Visnu.134 In practice this trait of character may lead to curious forms of compromise and to attempts to consider both deities as complementary powers, whose co-opcration is needed for the progress and prosperity of world and mankind. An almost endless collection of rites and customs could be brought together in which both gods— whether with or with­out the third member of the Trimürti, Brahma135— figure conjointly and indiscriminately. A man who is ill to death must, according to some authorities,136 remember or hear the sacred names of both. In an enumeration of a number of tirthas belonging to all parts of India the author of the Visnusmrti (ch. 85) inserted also some which are sacred to Siva. Places arc not rare in which the worship of both gods is recommended.137 The partly Visnuite, partly Sivaite Agni-Puräna combines in one chapter138 the ordinary form of worship of both deities. It is, however, often difficult to decide whether we are in these cases concerned with neutrality or indifference or with a tendency to compromise or inclusion. Moreover, texts may have been rewritten, compiled or amplified in another milieu.139 But there can be no doubt that these phenomena must be viewed in the light of the syncretistic tendencies which are in the last millennium increasingly forging ahead in Hinduism.First, an instance of compromise.

This anomaly is accounted for by the belief that Visnu-Räma, gratified by Siva’s religious behaviour— for thousands of aeons the god used to mutter Rama’s mantra— had granted him the privilege to effect the final emancipation of everybody who dies in his sacred district at Benares.141 Such a story helps us in understanding how both religions could for long periods co-exist in the same sacred place, for instance at Kancï (Conjeeveram) in the South and how, for instance, Visnu so often figures in Sivaite legends.142There'is, further, indeed a curious trend to represent the two great divine powers as complementary.143 A random example of a prescrip­tion which was to influence the social life of the faithful : Visnu is said to be the tutelary deity of all articles which are given as a present enumerated in a special list, but any articles not mentioned in that list should be regarded as sacred to Siva, and so the formula used in making a donation is: T make this gift composed of such and such articles, respectively sacred to Siva or Visnu. . . .’144 Many traces of these complementary and co-operative functions of both gods survive in popular tales and beliefs. Siva reciting a hymn in praise of the Ganges states that sinners dying, through the grace of God and as a result of their karma, in the waters of that river are relieved from all sins and become his attendants, dwelling by his side, but also that if a dead body of a person falls into these waters, that person will abide with Visnu for many years.145 Sri-Krsna is much pleased with his adorers’ obser­vance of the fast of the Sivaratri146 on the fourteenth day of the dark half of the month Phälguna. According to popular tradition his cult is not efficacious without this observance.147Sometimes a mythological achievement or undertaking of great importance requires the co-operation of both divinities. When the army of the gods was defeated by the asuras, the devas, making Brahmä- Prajäpati their leader, approached Siva and Visnu for help with the result that the goddess Devi, Candikä, the Great Goddess was created from the tejas of the bodies of the gods.148 Mythologizing popular tales even speak of ties of affinity, Visnu having given his sister Devi in marriage to the other great god together with wedding presents.149 Sometimes also both gods are, in more or less popular stories, even said to co-operate for the good of men who are on the wrong track. Thus once Visnu, disguised as a woman,150 accompanied Siva who inten­tionally behaved as a Don Juan in a forest inhabited by ascetics who102 MUTUAL RELATIONS OF THE TWO RELIGIONS"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"without knowing Siva’s true nature worshipped him.151 A more philosophical account of this co-operation on a cosmic level is fur­nished in those puränic passages152 which regard Visnu as an integral part (amia) of Siva, as his iakti not different from himself; the whole universe consists of the essence of these two highest gods, Siva being the purusa and Visnu the prakfti of Sämkhya philosophy.Many puranic legends indeed give evidence of the conviction that the great divine powers complement each other and that they are to co-operate for the well-being of world and mankind. This is for in­stance apparent from part of those numberless popular legends and local traditions which, accounting for the name, origin or holiness of some temple, river or place of pilgrimage, assign a prominent part to one of the chief gods or to both of them. Thus the Kasi-khanda of the Skanda-Puräna, the legendary history of Benares, narrating the origin of the famous Manikarnikä well, says that Visnu dug that well with his discus, and filled it with the perspiration from his own body. When the work was finished he began to practise austerities, no doubt to supply the energy spent in performing the arduous task. Meanwhile Siva-Mahadeva came and looked into the well. Seeing in it the radiance of a hundred million suns, he was so enchanted that he began praising Visnu loudly, and declared that he would give him anything he might ask. Visnu, much gratified, replied that he only desired that Mahädeva should always live there with him. Mahädeva was so pleased with this compliment that his whole body shook with delight, and an ornament called Manikarnika fell from his ear into the well. He then declared that the well should henceforth be known by that name, and that it should be the most efficacious of all the places of pilgrimage.153— When the asura Gaya, who was a devout Vaisnava, endowed with great strength and vigour practised rigorous austerities for many thousands of years, the gods, oppressed and alarmed, repaired to Brahma for aid and protection. Brahma, as usually, took no action himself, but remitted the case for intervention to Siva. This god how­ever referred the devas to Visnu who, being equal to the occasion, proceeded to intervene and found also solutions in the ensuing succes­sion of predicaments.154 In another story Visnu acts as Siva’s teacher: he enters the latter’s heart and gives him insight into the intricacies of creation, preservation and absorption.155 A last example: when Siva, bewildered after Sati’s death, went with her body on his shoulders to the eastern provinces, Brahma, Visnu and other gods, in order toM UTUAL RELATIONS OF THE TWO RELIGIONS 103"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"relieve him of the corpse, cut it into pieces and made these fall at certain places on earth which henceforth were considered sacred.156In particular cases however the historical development of a theme reveals that the motif of co-operation or more or less forced or inclusive co-existence has at a given moment been introduced, and replaced an antagonistic attitude, no doubt as a result of the increasing influence of one of these religions which wanted its god to be concerned in an important mythical event.157There is an interesting puränic story about the Mätrkäs ‘Divine Mothers’ created by Siva to help him in destroying the formidable demon Andhaka.158 When these deities, though sucking the blood of the demon to the point of satiety, did not succeed in acquitting them­selves of their task, Siva had to resort to Visnu for help. Visnu then created a female being Suska-Revati, who in a moment killed all the demons. The troupe of Siva’s Mätrkäs however was not satisfied and wished to devour demons, gods and men all and sundry. In order to prevent these beings from being killed Siva propitiated Visnu-Nara- simha who created another group of Mätrkäs from his own limbs. These mothers were capable of creation as well as destruction, and when they overpowered Siva’s Mätrkäs the latter applied to Narasimha who pointed out to them that their duty was to protect the world. Thus their malevolent nature was changed, their task henceforth being to worship Siva, not to afflict his devotees, to protect those who remember Visnu-Narasimha, to fulfill all the desires of those who offer oblations, and to maintain order. This narrative suggests not only the co-operation of both great gods but also Visnu’s superiority, and especially his bene­volent nature, noble spirit and peaceable disposition.A very instructive example of gradual recast and transformation is furnished by the legend of the son of the däityci Hiranyakasipu, Prahläda, who, while yet a boy, became an ardent devotee of Visnu. This so en­raged mighty Hiranyakasipu, that he ordered the youth to be killed,159 with no success, because his devout love to Krsna and fervent religiosity made him invulnerable. This story of unswerving loyalty against brute hostility and self-exaltation, pathetically narrated in black and white, was a great favourite of many apologists. In the course of time Pra­hläda— who had already in the Bhagavadgità160 been mentioned as a vibhüti or manifestation of Krsna’s power and majesty— even became the principal character of the myth of Visnu’s Man-lion civettarci, to which he originally did not belong. Originally the Man-lion had made104 MUTUAL RELATIONS OF THE TWO RELIGIONS"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"his appearance to punish the king of the daityas for his arrogance and the dethronement of the gods. Later on it was to avenge Prahlada,161 as well as to vindicate his own insulted majesty that Visnu became incarnate as Narasimha and slew Hiranyakasipu.162 The presentation of this legend reached its poetical and theological culminating point in the Visnu- and Bhägavata-Puränas of about the IVth and IXth centuries A.D. In later versions it was on the one hand abridged and revised and, on the other, amalgamated with other material according as the particular theological standpoints of the compilers might require. All these later adaptations have in common a reduction of the philo­sophical content of the legend to the simple form of a popular devo­tional narrative. Among the authors there were not only Visnuites, but, interestingly enough, also Sivaites. As the narratives we owe to them throw much light on the mutual relations between both religions it may be permitted very briefly to summarize here part of the results ensuing from the investigations of Professor Hacker of Münster, who wrote an interesting book on the Prahlada legend.Whereas up to a definite stage of development163 of the story Siva does not play any part in it, this god appears, in the Visnuite Narasimha- Puräna (ch. 40 ff.), on the scene as the leader of the gods who, being alarmed by Hiranyakasipu’s tyranny, proceed on the advice of Brhas- pati,164 to praise Visnu. It is Siva who after adoring Visnu with a hymn, consisting of names and epithets— among which are also his own names Sankara and Mahesvara!— without any formulation of a request for help, induces Visnu to appear and to promise Hiranyakasipu’s ruin in case he should lay violent hands on his son. Quite another role is destined for Siva by the compiler of the sixth book of the Padma- Purana.165 Although he is introduced here as the narrator of the story, the legend is reduced to a specimen of anti-Sivaite propagandism. In one of the many narratives with which the god instructs and entertains his wife Urna he relates that it was due to a boon granted by himself— and not, as in the older versions, by Brahma166— that his fervent adorer Hiranyakasipu had, after millions of years spent in rigorous ascetic discipline, obtained the government of the universe. This role of Siva, whose worshipper is in the course of the story represented as being much impressed by Visnu’s omnipotence, is no doubt due to the author’s wish to proclaim the inferiority of heretical167 Sivaism, which is inculcated here, with the highest authority of Siva himself.168 Another no less tendentious trait of this version is the alternative with whichM UTUAL RELATIONS OF THE TWO RELIGIONS 105"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Prahläda is presented by his father: he should either revere Hira- nyakasipu as the lord of the three worlds, or worship, after the Pâsupata tradition, Siva, the guru of the universe, the lord of the gods, who is the god of the demons and from whom all dominion derives. The priests of the king add that Rudra is the highest god, through whose favour Hiranyakasipu has risen to his royal position.169 Here again it is not the philosophical or theological system of the rival religion which is com­bated and refuted but its socio-ritual practices which provoke the author’s deep-rooted aversion.Turning now to some Sivaite adaptations we first confine our atten­tion to a version contained in the Siva-Puräna,170 which, though de­pendent on the Bhägavata, quite intelligibly lacks those features which the successive generations of Vaisnava devotees had added to the story in order to make its hero a champion of their own faith and, on the other hand, docs not fail to intimate that Narasimha is not quite too powerful, because he needs four milliards of years to conquer the demon. Another version preserved in the same puräna171 gives us a different picture. In reading the story proper one has the impression that it is Visnuitc, but just before the end Sivaization forges ahead. In deviation from other versions the blaze of Narasimha’s fury cannot be quenched before Siva, praised and implored by the gods, transforms himself into a sarabha, a terrible monstrous animal with eight legs which was believed to kill lions.172 As soon as the Man-lion catches sight of this opponent he bids him welcome with respectful benedictions and disappears. In the two Sivaite adaptations with which I must bring the survey to an end, Prahläda is no longer the central figure of the story, because the Saivas, once they had introduced the sarabha, made it ar. avatära of their god which soon became the hero of a new mythical tale, various versions of which occur in Sivaite literature. Thus this tale developed into an element of the theological polemics into which Saivas and Vaisnavas found themselves engaged. In a third passage of the Siva-Puräna, rightly called ‘The story of the sarabha’,173 the tradi­tional Prahläda legend has now been converted to the simple intro­duction to an account of Siva’s intervention. In order to help the gods he sends his own frightful manifestation (bhairavam rupam), called Virabhadra174 and his iarabham rupam, which he normally assumes on the occasion of the reabsorption of the universe. After an unsuccessful attempt at conciliating Narasimha by means of friendly words:—which are only to intensify the lion’s fury and to make him boast of hisIOÓ MUTUAL RELATIONS OF THE TWO RELIGIONS"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"omnipotence— Virabhadra reveals his identity and explodes with a torrent of abuse, saying that the Man-lion sinks into complete insig­nificance beside Siva, finally to drag him along towards heaven. Now, in the power of his antagonist, Narasimha resolves to praise and implore him:175 ‘Whenever I think, my mind defiled by arrogance, “ These arc my commands” I pray Thee, O Lord, to take this inclination away from me/ Finally the monster incorporates Narasimha in the literal sense of the term: he makes him part of his body, declaring that now Visnu is completely included in Siva, like water poured into water.176 Virabhadra tears off the lion’s skin, which is henceforth worn by Siva.177A comparison between this Sivaitc version and the anti-Sivaite form of the story presented by the Padma-Puräna is very instructive. The Saiva author takes the intervention of the Man-lion as arrogance which results in nothing but Siva’s revenge. Whereas the Vaisnava text condemns the cult of the rival religion without engaging in a discussion of its mythological presuppositions, the Saiva makes the mythological imagery of both parties178— which actually is a symbolization of functional aspects of the characters of the two gods— a weapon to combat his rivals without caring for their cult. The last point is worth noticing, because Hinduism in general is inclined to attach, in these questions, more value to the socio-ritual side o f a doctrine or religion than to its theoretical foundation. As long as we have no exact in­formation on the author’s times and milieu we cannot fcc 1 sure that it was his inability to suppress the cult of the rival religion— Professor Hacker’s supposition179— which made him take this stand.180 Whereas, finally, the Vaisnava author does not wish to interfere with Siva’s position of authority provided that he is Visnu’s inferior,181 the Saiva is willing to permit the worship of Visnu-Narasimha, but only on the understanding that actually Visnu is completely identical with Siva.182 Sivaism indeed, though often decidedly inclined to adoptive inclusivism,183 actually contented itself in many particular cases with the recognition of the equality of both gods;184 with the pronounce­ment that by worshipping Visnu, who is ever victorious by the grace of Siva, one delights and satisfies the latter;185 or with the simple state­ment that as compared with Siva, Visnu is, in point of fact, no more than a mirage.186Doctrinal tolerance is, finally, one of the most remarkable aspects of Hinduism. Yet, here also, a distinction should be made.187 TheMUTUAL RELATIONS OF THE TWO RELIGIONS 107"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"systematic philosophical treatises expounding or defending the tenets of a definite school of thought are of course bent on establishing the views of their community, and consequently much inclined to reject dis­sentient views. For those authors who believe in a personal God and in a well-considered doctrine about His nature, attributes and omni­potence it is no matter of indifference whether God is Siva or Visnu. Poets, mystics and other exponents of more emotional forms of religion are, on the other hand, inclined to neglect, notwithstanding their allegiance to cither god, doctrinal distinctions and ritual differences and to emphasize the attainment of the ultimate Oneness into which not only all human, but also all divine persons may ultimately merge.188A few instances of comprehensive broad-mindedness may be re­called here. The exploits of the family of Ragliti, in which those of Rama, who is Visnu, are the most important, open in Kalidasa’s famous poem with an invocation of Paramcsvara (Siva) and Pârvatï, while his other epic, the KGmarasambhava, which is a story of Siva, contains a long and elaborated prayer to Brahma (2, 4 ff). On the whole this poet, despite many sympathetic references to Siva, praises the two other members of the triad so devotedly that he cannot have been a narrow-minded partisan of one of them.189 In later times also Tulsidas begins his poem of the deeds of Visnu in his incarnation as Rama, the Rämacaritamanasa, with a prayer addressed to the other great god of Hinduism. That in spite of metaphyical differences the two religions were in definite times and regions drawing nearer together is also apparent from inscriptional evidence. Temple inscriptions dating from the Xllth century190 open with the invocation of one sacred name and close with the other and pious kings openly profess themselves wor­shippers of both gods. A donation to the Lord Siva may begin with an invocation of Väsudeva.191 A complete collection of all relative legends, literary texts and other documents would no doubt be a welcome addition to our knowledge of interconfessional relations in Hinduism.The two deities— ‘the two highest who are one’192— may even be invoked under the joint title Pradyumna-Isvara,193 that is Hari-Hara, a figure which— whatever inspiration sculptors might derive from it to express the coincidence of opposites mutually supporting each other194— never rose to real importance in religious praxis.195 Both gods are sometimes praised as being, each of them, one half of the highest God, or the original form of God is said to be composed of twoI08 MUTUAL RELATIONS OF THE TWO RELIGIONS"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"‘halves’ known individually as Siva and Visnu.196 In illustration of the difference in attitude between a mystic and a philosopher belonging to the same Visnuitc tradition I may recall197 that, whereas the saint and poet Nammâlvar saw no difference in a so-called sectarian mark on the forehead made with sacred dust and one made, in the Sivaite way, with ashes, the philosopher Vedäntadesika preferred to interpret in the poet’s work the word for ‘ashes’ to mean the dust under Visnu’s feet in order to avoid any thought of ashes.Teachers and preachers, enraptured with their visions of the truth, did not hesitate to identify the Highest Being of every denomination with the Highest Principle of Vedantic monism. The plurality of doctrines and of divine names does not last when the higher insight has dawned or the experience of the Oneness has been realized. ‘May Hari, the ruler of the threefold universe, worshipped by the Sivaites as Siva, by the Vedäntins as Brahman, by the Buddhists as Buddha ... by the Jainas as the liberated . . . grant our prayers.’198 Then it is explicidy taught that the doctrine one adopts and the philosophy one professes are matters of indifference. Avoiding all polemics the author of the Yogaväsistha-Rämäyana199 makes an attempt to recognize the truth of all Hindu traditions, to adopt them and to weld them into something higher. ‘Many names have been given to the Supreme Spirit by the learned for practical purposes such as Order (rtnm), Self (ätmä), the High Brahma, Truth; it is called . . . Brahman by the Vedäntins, . . ., the Void (ßtlnya) by those who proclaim the doctrine of the Void200 .. ., Siva by the worshippers of the god whose ornament is the digit of the moon’.201 Similarly, authorities on Krsnaite bhakti express the opinion that in praising God’s glory and majesty one should not con­sider him, Krsna, different from Siva.202 ‘Just as one substance with many qualities (becomes manifold) through (the apprehension of) the senses working in different ways, even so the Holy One (bhagavän) is conceived of in different ways through the (diversity of the) scrip­tural traditions.’M UTUAL RELATIONS OF THE TWO RELIGIONS 109"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"VISiva and Visnu in Folklore, Myth and LiteratureIt need hardly be said that alter a survey of some main doctrines and of the institutionalized rites of both religions it will not be im­proper now to cast a glance at the customs, convictions, folklore, mythological and literary traditions related to the cult of the two great gods. As however it would lead us too far to review Indian religious folklore as far as it is concerned with Visnu and Siva, I shall limit myself to a few remarks on traditional popular belief, abandon any attempt at examining sources written in languages other than Sanskrit and mainly focus attention on these gods as they appear in the post­epic classical literature, covering the period in which the Hinduism of literate Indians may be said to have consisted mainly of these two religions, Saiva-Säkta and the variants of Visnuism.A phenomenon which has, for many centuries, been of special im­portance in religious practice and which must have played a role in the interrelations of both religions concerns an obvious parallelism in cults and customs, beliefs and ceremonies. Evil is, in India also, averted by the utterance of certain names. When an Indian hears a lizard chirp he may repeat four or five times the name of Krsna, but if his house be pestered with snakes he writes one of Siva’s names on the walls.1 Mention has already been made2 of Siva’s drum and of Visnu s conch,3 and Krsna’s flute is only too well known: it may be added that the Vaisnavas have a predilection for the flute and the cither, leaving the cymbals, drums and bells mostly to the Saivas and Tantrists.4 Since the harp is the preference of Buddhist gods, it is clear that with regard to musical instruments the Indian religions tended to evince a certain partiality. These observations have a wider application. The main annual Visnuite festivals and ceremonies and those in honour of &va cum suis, which are determined by the lunar calendar,5 alternate, so as to constitute some striking cases of correspondence. The great Sivaratn is for instance held on the fourteenth day of the dark fortnight"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"of Phälguna (Fcbruary-March) and Krsna’s and Rädhä’s Dolayâtrâ (Holi) on the full moon day of the same month.Rather than repeat some well-known relations of the great gods with definite animals I would insert here a short account of their associations with the vegetable kingdom. Whereas of course many plants play no role in this connection and other plants and trees seem to waver in their sympathy,6 a number of them are widely sacred to one of these gods or to their wives— that is, they are regarded as representatives or mani­festations of the power complexes for which these divine names stand— and are as a rule worshipped accordingly. Thus the tulasi7 (basil or ocimum sanctum) is all over India an object of veneration for Visnuites, who, for instance, make necklaces of bits of its stem. This most sacred and respected plant which is believed to destroy mosquitoes, diseases and demons, is a great purifier of the atmosphere;8 many Indians are convinced that evil spirits never dare come to a place where a tulasi is planted. Being ‘dear to Hari’ and found before every temple of the god it is married to him on the eleventh day of the bright half of the month of Kärtika, when his image is worshipped with its leaves. In­terestingly enough this plant is believed to be the meeting point of heaven and earth; Brahma and other gods and goddesses reside on its leaves. It grants children to the childless, wealth to the needy and opens the gate of heaven to the devout worshipper. A Visnuite tradition relates that when the chastity of Vrndâvatï— who is sometimes iden­tified with Rädhä— sustained the life and power of her husband, the demon Jalandhara, Krsna however, by deceiving Vrndâvatï in the guise of that demon, succeeded in killing him. When Vrndâvatï came to know of this fact she declared that she would be reborn as the tulasi and cursed Visnu: he would have to bear her leaves on his head for the wrong he had done her. The god, full of remorse, accepted her in the form of that plant to be his permanent companion.According to the Agni-Purana (202, 3 ff.) the malati (jastninutn grandiflorum) heads the list of flowers given in propitiation of the god, while an act of worship made with tatuala flowers grants enjoyment and salvation to the votary himself. A püjä performed with the jasmine called mallikä absolves the worshipper of all sins, etc.9 The tree sacred to Krsna is the kadatnba, under which he dances with the gopis.As Krsna-Visnu is fond of the leaves of the tulasi, so Siva is said to appreciate those of the bilva (bael, bel, wood-apple tree or aegle mar- melos),10 which is mainly associated with Saiva and Sâkta cults.

According to the Sivaite mythical tradition o f its origin12 LaksmI used to worship Siva every day with a thousand lotus flowers. Accidentally, one day two flowers were missing and, pondering over an alternative, she remembered that her husband had casually remarked that her breasts were as beautiful as blooming lotus flowers. Then she decided to offer these parts of her body. When she was cutting them off with a sharp weapon the god appeared, declaring himself satisfied and restraining her from completing what she had begun. One breast however was already cut off; it was, the god said, to be planted and would become one of the most sacred fruits in the world. Among the plants prescribed in the worship of Siva are also the dhustara (thorn- apple) and the ‘magical’ and calamitous arka,13 which elsewhere is said to cause the displeasure of the gods in general.Rice is sacred to LaksmI, the goddess of fortune and prosperity, who already at an early date was closely connected with the yellow ripe com and who up to the present day is, at her festival, represented by a com-basket filled with unhusked rice. She is sometimes even believed to exist or to manifest herself in the shape of seedlings grown in the winnowing-basket.14 Durgä, the goddess of uncultured tribes, is associated with plants of another type. Among the food offered to her is the aphrodisiac pulse which is also given to the spirits of the de­ceased.15 Manifesting her nature in several aspects this goddess is also represented by different sacred trees. One of these— usually nine16— plants is the kadalï (the plantain tree or musa sapientoni) which, repre­senting vegetative power, is the centre of a ritual performed by women in order to have children.17 In the Devi-Mahatmya the goddess is made to say: ‘When rain and water shall fail for a hundred years,I shall, propitiated by the munis, be bom on the earth but not from a womb, support the whole world with the life-sustaining vegetables which will grow out of my own body until the rains set in again.’18 W e are strongly reminded of widespread beliefs and well-known customs related to the Corn-mother.19Generally speaking and barring geographical differences the main fig trees are assigned20 to different gods. The big pipai, asvattha or ficus religiosa, is, for instance in Gujerat, often seen near a shrine of Siva and believed to be the abode of snakes, the god’s pets.

This tree, which is supposed to represent fertility, to give children, and to avert disasters, plays an important part in the ancient cosmological speculations of the In­dians.23 I only recall AV. 5, 4, 3 where it figures as the celestial seat of the gods who there gained the sight of ‘immortality’ (amrtam) and ChU. 8, 5, 3 mentioning a ‘soma-yielding’ (somasavana) fig-tree in the Brahmaloka.24 Although the great epic (Mbit. 13, 135, 101) calls Visnu, that is identifies him with, three species of the ficus, this god was according to a purânical legend cursed to become an afvattha, and Siva to become the banyan or Indian fig tree (nyagrodha),25 which, like the god himself, has phallic associations.26 Not rarely the banyan is indeed said to be a form of Siva, the afvattha a form of Visnu, and the paläsa— i.e. the butea frondosa— a form of Brahma,27 another instance of a threefold assignment28 or distribution in relation with the three members of the Indian trinity.29In studying these relations of the great divine figures one should not forget that there are, in India, very clear examples of plant theophanies attesting to the people’s consciousness of the divinity and the highly important function of the vegetable kingdom. Says Durgä: ‘Then, O Gods, I shall support (nourish) the whole universe with these life- sustaining vegetables which grow from my own body until the rains set in again. I shall then become glorious upon the earth as the ‘Bearer of vegetables’ (Sâkambharï) and then I shall destroy the great asura Durgama (i.e. the personification of drought).’30 Laksmi is adored in, and in the form of, a basket filled with unhusked rice31 or represented by a corn-measure filled with grain and adorned with flowers.32 The belief moreover obtained that worship of the genii of trees and plants— and among these is Siva33— may lead to the position of such a deity in one’s next existence.34Similar instances of what may be called a complementary tendency35 in rites and practices might be collected from other provinces or nature. The Visnuites for instance believe that their god is present in every tälagräma— a black fossil found in the Gandak river— , while the adorers of Siva are convinced that this deity resides in every round white pebble found in the Narmada.36 The Sivaite Lingäyats never part with a small Unga assumed to be the representative of their God, the Visnuite followers of Kabir wear a pearl of fidasi wood or a tufosi collar.FOLKLORE, MYTH AND LITERATURE II3"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"FOLKLORE, MYTH AND LITERATUREIHThese great gods maintain, for instance, relations with those moun­tains which occupy a prominent place in Indian cosmology and mytho­logy, but their preference lies in different directions. Thus Kalidasa often alludes to the Kailäsa, a mountain formed of crystals, as an abode of Siva and Pârvatï37 and the poet’s liking for this mountain may prob­ably be closely bound up with this fact.38 His ‘affection for the Hima­laya’39 is too well known to be recalled here.40 Visnu is on the other hand said to be worshipped on Mount Mandara,41 the mountain which, already in the Great epos, was made the churning staff when the ocean had to yield the amrta,42It would be an endless task to collect all legends connected with sacred mountains, rivers and other places in which Visnu or Siva play a more or less prominent part,43 or current in regions or localities which are considered to have been the scene of their earthly activities. Let it suffice to observe that in these traditions also both gods remain true to their character. Visnu-Madhusudana is said to stay on Mount Mandara in Bhagalpur, keeping his foot placed on it, because this is the mythical mountain of the same name which the god had thrown upon the trunk of the dangerous demon Madhukaitabha44 in order to prevent his bones being a cause of damage.The general public does not hesitate to ascribe to the objects of their veneration thoroughly human qualities and imperfections. Thus the dissatisfaction expressed by Garuda,45 his vallatici, at Visnu’s indifference to the suffering of the plover whose eggs had been stolen (washed away) by the sea and his refusal to convey his master to Amaravati in order to promote the interests of the gods brought the Exalted One to see his error46 and to order the sea to give back the eggs. When on the other hand king Parantaka of Uraiyur in the region of Trichinopoly had omitted to punish a gardener who had appropriated some flowers which were set apart to be offered to Siva, the god became so angry that he destroyed, by means of a dust-cloud, town and royal house with the exception of the queen, for she would give birth to a son who, by Siva’s grace, was to be king in after years.47 It would not be difficult to collect a considerable number of interesting stories of this type, es­pecially from narrative literature and popular traditions. Krsna is known as a trickster48 but his colleague is, if the occasion presents itself, no more averse from pranks and deceit.

When a playwright51 could put an accusation of theft into the vidüsakas mouth against the same god one might feel reminded of those poets who call their god a thief of men’s hearts or say that Krsna has stolen the hearts of the gopis. Elsewhere52 Siva-Paramcsvara is reviled because he had joined an ill-matched pair in marriage.The gods’ main activities gave, quite intelligibly, rise to an endless number of legends and popular tales. Thus a king of South-Indian Madura who took great pains to learn to dance, was very distressed, because Siva at Chidambaram proved to be able to dance without interruption and always on the same foot. As the god did not notice his urgent demands to take a rest or to change, at least, his foot, the king committed suicide; it was only then that Siva condescended to dance on his other foot.53Needless to say that in these tales the exalted superhuman God of philosophers and theologians often hides himself behind His aspect of a mighty and reliable helper of his devotees and punisher of their adversaries, who however in this function is not rarely bound by, and subject to, general norms of dharma or moral or to other limitations which may impress the reader as imperfections or infringements of His omnipotence. Siva is not able to get rid of the blue colour which he contracted in drinking the poison : there arc things which cannot be helped.54 As a good colleague Visnu declares, in a Sivaite context, it is true, that he is unable to remove the calamity which Siva had caused, although Brahma had pronounced another opinion.55 This tendency may result in the idea that even these great gods must atone for transgression of the dharma. Thus Visnu had according to a puränic story56 to incarnate himself— as a result of a curse— seven times on earth for having beheaded a woman, viz. the mother of Bhrgu, with whom the asuras had taken refuge.Nor is there much need to cite many examples of the popular belief in more or less direct intervention of the great gods in mundane events and especially in the vicissitudes of individuals. They may for instance appear in bodily form57 or in dreams and give helpful advice.58 In these tales myth is no less mixed up with legend than in the many compilations and more or less original compositions written in praise of their god by Saiva and Vaisnava devotees who in the course of time developed a very extensive hagiography.59FOLKLORE, MYTH AND LITERATURE II5"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"I make, in passing, mention of the abundant literary and inscrip- tional60 evidence of worship,61 of the great gods being invoked by men in distress and agony,62 by those who observe a vow or entertain a hope or desire, in normal and exceptional circumstances. W e hear of King Puspabhüti, who did not even in dreams take food without worshipping the god whose emblem is a bull, the Lord of beings, the unborn and ageless guru of the immortals, the upholder of the universe, the creator and annihilator of all existence; who was honoured by his vassals and subjects with presents customary in Siva’s worship, and gratified by white bulls, and conceived for a great Saiva saint Bhai- ravacarya a deep affection as towards a second Siva who initiated him in the god’s ritual.63 Definite aspects of cult, piety and adoration come to the fore as circumstances may require. For propitiating Siva with tapas in order to be united with one’s beloved one may go to a temple of Gauri and recall the god’s union with her, his eternal consort.64 Hearing the holy story of the Rämäyana, which relates the heroic deeds of Visnu who had descended to the earth in order to save mankind, was for many centuries to come a dependable way to long life, moral purity and good fortune.65It is generally speaking not by mere chance that an invocation of a god’s protection is not infrequently accompanied by a reference to one of his important aspects or great exploits.66 Siva, who laughs at the memory of his violent but effortless proceedings against Daksa, and Krsna-Visnu, who made the gods happy by slaying Kamsa, will no doubt prove competent and reliable helpers.67 God’s victory indeed brings the victory of His worshippers in its wake,68 and the poets do not omit emphasizing this continued efficacy of the divine activity in the reality of the hic et nunc by resorting to a parallelism in sentence structure: ‘It is Visnu-Kcsava who is victorious after having killed Kcsin ..., it is (our king) Chandragupta who is victorious . . .’69However, references to the cult and adoration of the great gods may in many literary works be frequent, it docs not follow that they often supply us with a wealth of information about little known particulars. Many topics and descriptions arc traditional,70 and not rarely an author confines himself to a bare mention of a name or ceremony which then may serve to insert a simile or to embroider a descriptive passage.71 Yet one of the sources of interest in definite poems or prose works lies in their contribution to our knowledge of popular belief and worship and of the position, character and significance of the gods in theI I6 FOLKLORE, MYTH AND LITERATURE"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"estimation of their adherents. For even the boundless phantasy of the story-tellers can hardly have come into flagrant collision with fixed public opinions about the character and behaviour of these great figures. W e may for instance learn from classical Sanskrit works that Siva was, at least in the eyes of some authors,72 much more interested in the weal and woe of his worshippers than Westerners are often prepared to assume.73 W e hear, in Bäna’s Kädambari which yields pre-eminence to this god, not only of oblations offered to him at cross­roads,74 of a devotee marked with the dust of his feet clasped in her devotion and even bearing on her head these feet marked with the god’s name and fastened with a band of hair;75 of adoration of pictures of the same god which were believed to have been carved on a rock by Pärvatl,76 but also of a shrine dedicated to the service of Durgä77 and of the oblations offered to this goddess. In the Kathasaritsagara Siva, whether he is propitiated78 or not, often intervenes in the course of events/9 bestowing favours and advantages upon his devotees,80 lending them a helping hand,81 and, very often, granting them the birth of a son,82 giving orders83 which appear to be their salvation. He is pleased by their austerities,84 appealed to for advice83 and believed to be (as Bhairava) invisibly present in cemeteries,86 to appear in dreams so as to come into personal contact with his wor­shippers87 and to secure the abodes of his followers against evil powers88 and misfortune.89The pity and love of God for all creatures is especially illustrated by innumerable stories about the great power and wonderful results of bhakti. It is not only the belief of a devotee that his bhakti will result in divine intercession with regard to the consequences of his actions, the performance of a vow with faith and devotion will also lead to the attainment of every power and pleasure, to freedom from pain and disease, and to all other divine graces.90 And, what is more, God’s heart may feel pity even for those whom he is, by the force of circumstances, to punish or to destroy. Did not Siva, after shooting the fatal arrow at Tripura repent his deed, and lament the death and destruction which he had brought about?91 Human sentiments, moral considerations and sympathy with the misfortune of those who have to pass through the successive states of worldly existence are indeed by no means foreign to the great gods.

It is better to die than to lead a miserable existence.’92After the comprehensive characterization of the Indian stotras given by the Indian scholar S.K. De93 it would be needless to expatiate on the general features of this type of devotional literature. Only seldom reach­ing the standard of great religious poetry and therefore almost ignored by many Sanskrit scholars, this very productive genre which in the epics, puränas, tantras and even in kävya works occurs as mere insertions, developed, by the Vllth century A.D., into a distinct form of literature to enter upon its flowering-time together with the medieval cults and denominations. As is only natural, these poems are devotional rather than doctrinal. They are mostly expressions of popular religion and may be appreciated as sources of knowledge of the mentality, the creed and credulity of their authors and those who were edified by them. Although not rarely traditional many effusions, prayers and lamenta­tions are more or less poetic recasts of religious truths. If one dies at Benares Siva gives the knowledge of the highest truth.94 ‘When shall I be a dweller in Käsi? When look back on sorrow from those groves of gladness? With Ganges water and with leaves of bel (bilva) I will worship Siva, my lord. Whether on water or on land it matters not, only let me die away there at Benares and salvation will be mine. She who feeds the world (i.c. Annapurna, a manifestation of Durgä95) is there as queen, that golden one in whom I will take refuge. There will I dance. ’96 However, Siva’s character remains ambiguous, and this fact finds expression in prayers quoted as models o f‘love to a deity’ : ‘When shall I pass my days as a moment, dwelling in Varanasi here on the bank of the divine river (Ganga), wearing (only) a small waist-cloth, holding my hands joined on my head, and crying out: “ O Lord of Gauri, Destroyer of Tripura, three-eyed Sambhu, be pro­pitious” ’:97 the god, though benevolent, remains always capable of mischief on an inconceivable scale.Generally speaking the more popular and edifying literature which is mostly written in the language of the masses, enables us to form a very good idea of the religious experience and the practical piety and devo­tion of the faithful.98 The authors and singers arc in touch with the fundamental tenets of their denominations but do not preach these.

From these it would appear that it docs not only enable man to acquire final emancipation; it is also fruitful in many other ways. There arc puranic stories of men who secured health, wealth and happiness, or a residence in the celestial regions, through the Lord’s grace and one Brahmadatta could through Visnu understand the language of the creatures. It is on the other hand believed that the grace of Siva enables even the perpetrators of diabolical deeds to obtain the highest attainments.102Although I cannot of course pretend to adding anything essential to the images of the central gods of Hinduism as they are present to the mind of every student of Indian history, it may be worth while to institute a brief comparison between those main features of each divine personality which arc over and over again made theme and motif, or condensed into epithets or mere references, in the works of the classical authors. W e have every reason to draw the so-called polite letters also into this comparative survey, because, according to the Indians, poetry and literary composition in general may help a man to attain religious merit. They make his mind receptive to higher ideas and are an important means of self-realization and of unification with the divine essence, ‘for instance through the praise of the lotus- feet of the divine Visnu-Näräyana’,103 and through the re-activation of the power inherent in the divine histories and the myths and legends of the gods and their manifestations.104 The epic poets also told their stories about worldly struggle and worldly pleasure mainly to lead the mind eventually to the Lord.105 It will however appear that it is not"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"always easy to characterize the literary portraits of these two great figures, because the poets, like their adherents in general, will quite naturally emphasize those traits of character which should, on a par­ticular occasion, come to the fore and the same occasions will present themselves to Saivas and Vaisnavas alike, both praying in the same distress for the same divine assistance and both being inclined to attri­bute to their God the same indescribable qualities.106It would to begin with be interesting to contrast the characteriza­tions which the followers of either god give of themselves. A single instance may show that there indeed is a tendency to emphasize different qualities and activities. In the Kriyayogasara which was, probably at a later date, attached to the Padma-Puräna, Visnu himself is (a. 2) said to have enumerated the characteristics of the Vaisnava: he has to look upon Brahma, Visnu and Rudra as equal, to wear gar­lands made of tulasï wood and dhatrl fruits, to mark his limbs with the figures of conch, discus, club and lotus, to bathe regularly in the waters of the Ganges, to study the Bhägavata, to construct new Visnu temples or to repair old ones, to serve cows and superiors, to have no regard for heretics, to be devoted to Siva and to worship Visnu.107 According to another authority,108 the best of the Bhägavatas include those de­voutly worshipping Siva. The faithful servant of God is himself like God,109 and his feet hallow the ground on which he treads. The Sivaite on the other hand should first and foremost worship his spiritual preceptor like Siva himself, follow the path of his God, always meditate on Him, considering Him to be present in himself, and dissociate himself from all opinions which are incompatible with the Sivaite creed.110Homage to Siva111 is not rarely paid in secluded or uninhabited places,112 for instance on the bank of a mountain stream,113 on the fourteenth day of the month.114 This devotion, which may be attended with meat offerings,115 very often consists in the observation of aus­terities (tapas).116 One of the characters of the Kathasaritsagara is said to have, at Benares, remained with his body steeped in the water of the Ganges, worshipping Siva three times a day, performing tapas, like a hermit, by living on roots and fruits, his wife sharing all his devotions and privations.117 The performance of tapas in places sacred to the god118 may of course bring him to special concessions. Siva is moreover believed to appear in his terrible form, as Bhairava, with drawn sword and lolling tongue, making an appalling roar, to punish120 FOLKLORE, MYTH AND LITERATURE"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"breakers of the divine commandments,119 but he may also, pleased and adorable, grant a benevolent vision of himself.120 Visnu is on the other hand, as Rama’s, i.e. Laksmi’s, husband, worshipped with flowers by people who, wishing to purge away the results of their evil deeds, live on fruits and bathe in tanks.121 But it is also Visnu who is credited with the willingness to grant his devotees a boon by which they may, for dishonourable purposes, change their sex at will,122 for Krsna-Visnu, who loves his worshippers more than Brahma, Siva or Sri,123 is not able to resist the call of those who invoke him.124Siva is characterized by several attitudes assumed for the expression of important aspects of his being, that is for the due performance of his functions and duties. It is these poses, which attracted the special atten­tion of the poets who over and over again glorify the great god’s power; he embodies service to the world and mankind; in these he is the prototype of all ascetics,125 the human ascetic boasting of a joy which, like his god and prototype, ‘he has found in being alone in the heart of the infinite’.126 Siva is also the originator of the eternal rhythm of the universe, the destroyer127 and the author of life and regeneration. In his headdress is the crescent moon128 which drips the nectar of ever­lasting life129 and hence is often invoked for protection:130 as is well known, the waxing moon, giving a bath to the fresh shoots of trees and creepers, brings about growth and fruitfulness,131 and so its excellent virtues made it worthy of its high position on Siva’s head.132 The poetess Phalguhastini describes the rise of the crescent, which is just a spot of whiteness in the midst of surrounding darkness as a nail- mark on the hip of Lady Eve, as the smile on the face of Night, as the bow of Kama and as a flower on the dark matted locks of Siva.133 Through the god’s locks flows the heavenly Ganges, Umas sister,134 the sacred and pre-eminently purifying river which as a destroyer of sin and source of prosperity and redemption135 streams in heaven, earth and nether world136 and which the god consented to bear137 lest the earth should be crushed when Ganga was willing to supply her badly needed waters to its inhabitants.138 It is he, the arch-ascetic, seated in splendid isolation on a solitary summit of the Himalayas, who relents at the evil plight of the superhuman saints who by their tapas have succeeded in putting an end to the terrible drought.

As contrasted with the epic and puränic ascetics who lost their self-control and gave up their ascetic ideals under the influence of physiological processes or as victims of tricks and seduction,203 Siva remains, even at this juncture, the highest expression of the poet’s conception of divinity, whose yoga obviously was the necessary preparation for his marriage and fatherhood204 and, when Urna approached him, he discontinued this yoga of his own free will, to restrain his emotions after a short time.205 The same god is in virtue of his descent and the Openness of many of his adherents to Tantrist and Säktist currents of thought not rarely invoked for aid in magical rites.206Visnu on the other hand does not, if I am right, give us the impression of one who is likely to get into a conflict situation.

In another form of this version214 Siva ran, on this occasion, after the female Visnu, establishing out of his semen, which dropped in several places, beautiful shrines of images.Some years ago it was observed215 that the favourite myth of the Indian poets describing Siva’s feats of arms is the destruction of Tripura, the Triple City of the asuras. It was suggested that the popularity of that talc216 was perhaps due to the fact that the demons had themselves chosen their destruction. They had indeed sought and obtained the boon that they might rule the three worlds for a thousand years and that after that period a god would destroy their stronghold.217 It is difficult to judge whether this sentimental motive was so decisive. I would rather suppose that it is the antiquity and signficancc of the theme and its inherent possibilities of reinterpretation and of application in religious practice which made it so attractive. It may be recalled that in the brâhmanas a ‘threefold stronghold’ is an absolutely secure pro­tection and that the asuras, terrified, are said to run away from it.218 Or the gods made three ritual citadels219 and instituted a tripartite sacrificial rite220 called ‘victories’ of the nature of an arrow to over­power the asuras who had made earth, atmosphere and heaven three fortresses.221 Agni, Visnu and Soma were the component parts of that arrow. According to another form of the mythical tale the asuras made three citadels in the three parts of the universe obviously to hold them against the gods,222 but here also the gods succeeded in chasing their enemies away from these places by ritual means. By repeating hic et nunc this divine deed by ritual techniques one will chase away one’s rivals and enemies.223 In another version224 of the same myth the gods did not however succeed in conquering their antagonists and after makingFOLKLORE, MYTH AND LITERATURE 12$"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"a special arrow they invited Rudra, the fierce one, to shoot it. Pro­ceeding to do so this god cleft the strongholds and drove the asuras away from these worlds. As a reward he became the overlord of the animals. The tenor of this myth is evident: by resorting to a ritual technique originating in the divine reality before the beginning of phenomenal time, the man who knows is able, when imitating Rudra’s achievement, that is the destruction of the world-dominion of the demoniac powers, to stimulate the power of the three great gods Agni, Visnu and Soma, into a display of superiority to the wicked designs and malign influences of all inimical beings.225In the Mahäbhärata version,226 reference to which I have already made, the same three gods were transformed into an arrow, but Brahma — who acts as a charioteer— and other important beings and entities co-operated also.227 Shooting his weapon Siva consumed the Triple City together with all its inhabitants. Other sources give different details,228 speaking for instance of subtle assistance lent by Visnu.Two interesting details strike us here: first, before Siva’s success Indra had failed; and in the second place, the demons knew that they would be defeated after having seized the reins of world government for a thousand years. Moreover, the Vedic rite could in later times be replaced by worship of the god who occupies a central position in the mythical event. T pray these flames, bom of the arrow of the Triple City’s seizer, may bum away your ills.’229Now, with what thoughts did the myth inspire the great post-epic poets? Kalidasa mentions it as an important feat commemorated by celestial singers.230 A reference to the god’s victory may however also serve to celebrate, confirm and consolidate his omnipotence and abso­lute superiority: ‘What was the purpose of drum-beating when you wanted to burn up the Three Cities, which were no more than grass to you?’231 However, the repetition hic et nunc of God’s mythical exploit does not fail deeply to affect our own lives. God will continue to destroy all our sins and distress as his arrow burnt away Tripura: ‘Praise to the victor of the Triple City, to the slayer of the sins of man’.232 The practical effect is that the story of destruction becomes not only praise and fortification of the god who destroys our sins and evil, but also a promise of his help in the future: ‘May the dance of the con­queror of Tripura protect you.’233 The terrible god, who appears as Käla, the Time of Death,234 may on the other hand show also softer sides of his character and therefore be expected to have mercy on the126 FOLKLORE, MYTH AND LITERATURE"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"innocent: he indeed let fall the bow from his hand at the pitiable sight of the demon women who were on the verge of death by fire.235However, the scene o f these events is not on our earth,236 it is cosmic and those involved in them are superhuman.237 This contrasts strikingly with the terrestrial scene of Visnu’s great deeds when he descended in the form of an animal or a man in order to help and save mankind. In the stories of the Man-Lion the Dwarf, both Rämas and Krsna the scene is mostly laid in our world, even in India, in regions and places well-known and mentioned by name. They may be full of the wonder­ful and marvellous and embellished by phantasy, the central figures, for all their extremities of vice and virtue, make the impression of human characters ; their actions and reactions are within the limits of our understanding ; the conflict between the brahmans and the arrogant ksatriyas, or that between Rama and the demon Rävana, however heroic and extravagant, remain within earthly proportions. Their immediate causes are very human, struggle for political supremacy and for the possession of a woman. Although Siva is, in his hymnology, not rarely represented as a vital and colourful divine personality, Visnu’s character, as for instance manifested in theliymns of the Älvärs, is more absorbing and more varied, often appearing as the intimate companion of his adherents and the hero of many stories which are likely to touch upon a tender chord or to exhibit a view of humanity.238A side of no mean interest in the images of these gods is their relation to their female partners. Just as the character of an individual man cannot be understood without a thorough knowledge of his social and erotic connections with his natural complement; as an evaluation of a human culture is impossible without an insight into the position of the female half of creation, the being and essence of gods hide from a correct appreciation, when their sexual relations and married life are left out of consideration.Visnu, it is emphasized, is in all his incarnations united with Sri- Laksmi who, like her husband, is eternal and omnipresent.239 Already at an early moment the texts attempt to make clear all theological and philosophical implications of this important union which makes God ‘Lord or husband of Sri’ : he is the creator, she creation, she is the earth, he the support of it, he is one with all male, she with all female beings, etc.240 And the poets never tire of recalling that Visnu’s feet arc graced by the attentions of his spouse Sri-Laksmi.241 If however we peruse the stories of the god’s married life more closely Laksmi,FOLKLORE, MYTH AND LITERATURE 127"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"128FOLKLORE, MYTH AND LITERATUREnotwithstanding her— according to some authorities242 reciprocated— love at first sight and spontaneous embrace as soon as she came forth from the ocean,243 docs not appear to be free from fits o f a very feminine love of teasing and jealousy,244 for which, it is true, her husband with his ‘thousand other loves’ gives just cause.

As to his relations with the different incarnations of his eternal spouse they often are such as to appeal to his devotees for the elements of youthful passion and reckless adventure by which they are characterized, and by the possibilities they offer of viewing human— not rarely but too human— emotions, not only as natural to exalted superhuman beings, but often also as truly divine and hence as eternal and universal, as sanctioned and hallowed.He ravished Rukminï, although she has been intended for Sisupâla,247 whom he beheads with his discus, and in the ensuing slaughter he only spares her brother Rukmin because she intercedes for him. He married her, the Visnu-Puräna observes, in due form, after however first having made her his own in the räksasa way, that is, by violence. Already in the Harivamsa— in which the episode has swelled to an uncommon size248— Rukminï is said to be an incarnation of Sri, destined to marry, as Bhïsmaka’s daughter, the hero Krsna, whom she loves, and in the course of time she is explicitly represented as being his accomplice: she sends to invite Krsna to carry her off and instructs him how to proceed, because she wants to marry him against her brother’s will.?49 I need not repeat here the story of Visnu’s avatara as Rama or expatiate upon the significance of this incarnation as another repetition of the myth of the champion of the cosmos against the demoniac powers,250 nor recall the qualities of character which made Rama— deified by the later poets— the exemplary king and blameless husband— in the ortho­dox Indian sense of the expression— and Sita the type of a faithful and affectionate wife.251And Rädhä, Krsna’s chief mistress when he was a youth among the cowherds,252 described as a typically Indian beauty with solid breasts, a narrow waist and great buttocks253 and the partner in his eternal love-affair, displays all reactions and sentiments to which a human soul may be subject when it has conceived an ardent passion for an equally human beloved, or a fervent devotion for God, feelings inextricably blended in the eyes of Indian exegetes.

Rädhä is the soul which, yearning for God, has found the way to Him and is worthy of His love; Krsna’s overtures arc God’s willingness to extend his kindness and grace; thcgopïs, the less advanced souls which earn their beatitude by witnessing, as sympathizing spec­tators, the divine love-affair; Vrndävana and Gokula, the scene of the romance, the human heart and the paradise in which God and soul fmd each other in supreme love and devotion. In short, the mystery of the union of soul and God is, in this pre-eminently Visnuite cycle, consistently conceived in terms of human love. Hence the poets endeavour faithfully to express the transfigured personalities in their art, and strictly to follow the sequence of the story.256 The constant celebration of God’s love for Rädhä, that is, for the prototype of the human soul, wrought by the post-Caitanya poets into a model of perfection, came to be, beside bhakti and the chanting of songs re­counting God’s deeds, a means of attaining to salvation.257 Hearing the sacred history is indeed the best means of attaining God himself in his paradise Vaikuntha.258 God’s romance, moreover, presented the poets and thinkers with the opportunity for various interpretations.

Urna262 is no ordinary girl, not even a princess, she is of divine descent and no other than the Great Mother herself,263 the exact female likeness of her consort, whose nature and character is reflected in hers. She is the daughter of the greatest, wildest and most unconquered scenery of the world, the Himalayas, and as such the female representative of nature itself. The day o f her birth was a blessing for the universe,264 she herself, as a maiden, the quintessence of all virtue, beauty265 and loveliness, destined to marry Siva and to become the other half of his body.266 On him she waits and him she worships, in compliance with her father’s request, with flowers and with water and holy grass for his service.267 The god accepts her homage, although this is incompatible with the severe asceticism to which he devotes himself in his abode, the classical region for aus­terity, the very Himalaya. No explanation is, in the Kumarasambhava, given of the motive and purpose of the asceticism. It is part of God’s essence. But we have to recollect that he had in a preceding period been insane with grief because of the goddess’s sudden death when she had become his bride as Satl, daughter of Daksa.268 And now as Umâ- Pärvatl she devotes herself, to summon her husband again to demanding austerities, proving herself to be worthy of him.269 Their union— con­sidered a model of conjugal love after a previous period of amorous­ness270— is a necessity for the maintenance of the universe, for they are to procreate the power destined to slay the unconquerable demon Iaraka, who menaces the world with destruction. When Kama approaches the ascetic god new life and love awakes everywhere : the well-known sympathy of nature271 with the weal and woe of one of its fellow-members.272 But despite Siva’s willingness to receive Umä’s homage and to bless her with the prospect of a husband who will never have another wife, despite Kama’s bowshot,273 Umä’s victory cannot be consummated into a union without her ascetic preparation and the test of her steadfastness and without the sanction of the Prä- jäpatva marriage, in which her father is to give her away to her bride­groom No love, in this exemplary myth, without a valid wedding130 FOLKLORE, MYTH AND LITERATURE"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"and this explains also why Kama should be reduced to ashes,274 from which he is to arise when Siva will have taken Urna to spouse.275 The proposal and wedding ceremonies, described with abundance of detail, take place in complete accordance with the traditional rules.276 The poet docs not omit mentioning that after the regular proposal the god is very eager for his marriage and that in view of his feelings it is no great surprise that human beings under the circumstances feel strong emotion (Kum. 6, 95).W e now understand why the frank description of the joys of the newly married pair, so abhorrent to a former generation of Western readers,277 was a necessity. Twenty-five years were like one night, but the god’s thirst for the pleasures of love was not satisfied.278 Kalidasa’s description of this union is modest and moderate as com­pared with the aeon-long periods of love joy which the Indian power of imagination already before his times279 allotted to these ideals of sexual potency.280 This model of conjugal inseparability,281 this most important Indian representation of the idea of the androgynous pri­meval being282 Ardhanârïsvara, ‘ the Lord who is half female (and half man)’, presiding over procreation, which is a development of the upa- nisadic myth of the Ätman ‘ who was as large as a man and a woman closely embraced,’283 has given rise to many mythological talcs,284 part of which show its cosmological relevance.285 It brings about, not only the periodic revival of the moon,286 and the birth of Skanda, the champion of the gods against the asuras but, according to some autho­rities even that of Visnu and other gods.287 Representing the intrin­sically dual nature of the universe and its living inhabitants, Siva and his spouse ‘are reborn on earth in every man and every woman’.288 And so it is Pârvatï— who is never removed from her husband when he shows the friendly sides of his nature— who prevails upon her husband to show his kindly aspects, reducing him so to say to more human dimensions289 and making him an indulgent father. Hence the consequence most consistently realized by the Säktists: ‘Whoever is blissfully embraced by a beloved woman who is Parvatï’s counterpart assumes Siva’s wonderful figure and will, liberated, con­tinue the joys of amorous sport.’290 Up to the present day Indians like to regard the married life of this divine couple as an ideal for mankind, their devotion and asceticism, their constancy and sublime activities being focused on the good of the world and society.291 And yet it is Visnu-Krsna, not Siva who is worshipped as a youth and a lover.FOLKLORE, MYTH AND LITERATURE 131"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"Siva is the king or patron of dancers, actors and musicians and as such lie is still today worshipped in different parts of India.292 Dancing the life-process of the universe and its creatures the god is also their prime and eternal mover. Whatever the origin of his various dances, they are an extremely clear image of his being and function.293 In the beginning of time he once stood on a demon which he held in one of his hands, sounding the world’s first rhythm. The ‘monstrous serpent Vasuki undulates,’ to quote Subandhu, ‘beneath the bond of the mass of the god’s tangled locks’,294 among which the divine river Ganges is commonly represented by the sculptors incidentally to pour to the earth in a powerful cascade.295 According to the tradition handed down in Bharata’s Nätyasästra296 Lord Siva had, before the dawn of history, on seeing, in heaven, one of the newly invented dramatic productions, suggested that dances should be included in stage-plays. The first drama which was performed in the presence of this god was the Amrtaman- thana (‘the Churning (of the ocean) for the amrta’), the second the Tripuradaha (‘the Burning of Tripura’)297 in which Siva himself executed the destructive Tàndava dance which he is, as Bhairava, believed to repeat in crematoria.298 That is to say, when the story of the god’s feat had been recited, he danced and rendered it through this mimetic dance, performed in a very vigorous tempo, stamping his feet and causing the earth to quake.299Nevertheless his wild dance is so graceful that a famous beauty can be said to possess, as it were, ‘his sportful dancing with his quivering serpent’.300 The dance is, quite intelligibly, part of the god’s cult,301 which is to fortify him in the fulfilment of his functions.302 So it is not surprising to read that king Trivikramasena, the hero of the Vctäla tales, after completing his task spent a day in worshipping Siva, in dancing, music and similar enjoyments,303 or that a South-Indian poetess appreciated the dance of the god surrounded by demons so passionately that she identified herself with these uncanny spectators304 and hence was reputed to have changed herself into a demon.305 We also hear of people who, having fled to Siva for protection, danced in front of him,306 not to mention the well-known dancing girls attached to the god’s temples.307However, there is also a tale about a princess who, having attained supreme skill in music, was always singing to the lyre the hymn of Visnu which this god himself had bestowed on her,308 and the nymph Rambhä is in the same collection of stories309 said to have danced a132 FOLKLORE, MYTH AND LITERATURE"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"FOLKLORE, MYTH AND LITERATURE133new piece before that same god.310 Dancing is also in Visnuism a form of cult. ‘Vain is the tongue which does not sing the praise of him, Näräyana, the shelter of mankind. May the god we honour through his love-dance here show mercy on us now, for fear has spread upon our heads.’311 And nothing could of course prevent a playwright from invoking Näräyana as the stage-manager of the main plot, prologue and epilogue of the triple world.312It is largely due \\o the emphasis laid by Sivaism on cosmic structure and processes and on its god’s greatness as natural force and his being the embodiment o f the power of asceticism that it has been less pro­ductive of myths and mythical narratives than Visnuism which was always inclined to give special prominence to God’s interest in hu­manity, in human events and the bodily and spiritual needs of mankind and which worships its God especially in his incarnations part of which did not fail to make a powerful appeal to the emotions and imagination of poets and devotees. Yet it is worth while to examine here also some Saiva ‘legends’ or mythical tales more closely.An important event in the life of the prajäpati Daksa— to which I have already referred313— was his sacrifice. A no doubt comparatively original version of this narrative may be regarded as reflecting Rudra- Siva’s admission to the regular sacrifices of the brahmans. According to this short epic episode314 Daksa315 was engaged in sacrificing when Rudra-Siva, furious and shouting loudly, suddenly and ruthlessly, pierced the sacrifice with an arrow, so that the gods present were alarmed, the sacrifice (in its embodied form) fled away and the whole universe became confounded. No mention is made of his motives. The T5Ì5 made an attempt to appease the angry god, but in vain. He knocked out the teeth of Püsan who was eating an oblation. Finally the gods succeeded in conciliating him: they bowed humbly and ‘apportioned to him a distinguished share in the sacrifice, and through fear resorted to him as their refuge’. Visnu docs not enter on the scene here. When, according to another version contained in the Northern recension of the Mahäbhärata,316 which clearly reflects an existing antagonism between both religions, Daksa, in the days of yore, made arrangements to perform a sacrificial rite on a top of the Himalayas— to attend which all gods with their wives had approached— the rsi Dadhici warned him, saying that the rite was not valid, because Rudra- Siva— whom he by the power of his yoga beheld seated with Umä and Närada— was not invited and adored. Daksa replied that he, it was true,"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"FOLKLORE, MYTH AND LITERATURE134knew the eleven Rudras, but did not know who was this Mahcsvara: an unmistakable model of a man who wishes to keep aloof from ascen­dant Sivaism. In reply to Dadhici’s assurance that as there is no higher deity than Siva, Daksa’s sacrifice would be a failure, the latter even added that it was his intention to offer the whole oblation, duly conse­crated by formulas, on a golden vessel, to Visnu, the omnipresent lord.317 As Urna was very much upset and not content with her husband’s statement that his priests worship him in the sacrifice of true meditative wisdom, where no officiating brahmans are needed, Siva created a terrible being, Virabhadra, a sort of double of his own nature and the living embodiment of his rage, which together with Umä, who assumed her terrible form of Mahâkâlï, and with a number of spirits created from the pores of Rudra’s body, proceeded to destroy the sacrifice and to set fire to everything. Daksa, humiliated, took refuge with the mighty god, whose anger is better than the blessings of other deities and was restored to his favour.The variants of the story told in Sivaite puranas tend to insert refer­ences to Siva’s power and superiority. The version preserved in the Väyu-Puräna mentions, for instance, that the gods, desirous of assisting at Daksa’s rite, respectfully intimated their purpose to Siva-Mahädeva who gave them permission to go. In the Linga-Puräna (ioo, 32) Visnu, who joins battle with Siva, is beheaded and his head is blown, by the wind, into the fire. The moderate-minded compiler of the Kürma-Puräna (15, 68), though a Sai va, makes Brahma interpose between both gods who hadjoined hostilities in which both occasionally prevailed. Visnuitc puränas arc on the other hand inclined to ascribe Daksa’s neglect of Siva to his filthy practices, his going naked, smearing himself with ashes, carrying a skull and behaving as if he were drunk or crazy— allusions of course to the manner of life of Saiva mendi­cants.318 According to another variant tradition Rudra-Siva was present at a former assembly and was there even censured before the other guests by his father-in-law so that he departed in a rage; the company is cursed and it is predicted that all worshippers of Siva will be heretics of impure and detestable habits. In the Harivamsa319 Visnu compels his rival to capitulate after taking him by the throat and nearly strangling him.These observations bring me to broach the subject of another ten­dency which makes its appearance in the literature of Hinduism, to wit what might be called Visnuization or Sivaization of traditional"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"themes. I shall not dwell on those cases in which an ancient theme was remodelled under the influence of the rise of both religions and their mutual antagonism: whereas for instance the story of Daksa’s sacrifice illustrated, in its older vcisions, Rudra’s isolated position among the gods, the puranas emphasize the antagonism between Siva and Visnu. The ancient love-story of mortal Pururavas and the ap- saras UrvasI, which for many centuries had nothing to do with Visnu,320 may rather be quoted as an example. According to the Mahä- bharata321 Pururavas* mother, Ila, was also his father. In later times, in the Visnu-Purana, her sex was changed through the favour of Mitra and Varuna whom she had worshipped, but under a malediction of Siva she, that is the male Sudyumna, was again transformed into a woman. After she had given birth to Pururavas, she again became Sudyumna, but now through the favour of the mighty Visnu.322 According to the Matsya-Purana Pururavas was a devout worshipper of Visnu-Janärdana, whom he propitiated on a top of the Himalayas and to whom he owed his dignity of universal sovereignty. In another chapter the same purana323 informs us that Pururavas, after seeing the erotic sports of the nymphs, worshipped the god of gods Janârdana and had a dream that his desire would be fulfilled. The same god had created out of his thigh the ravishingly beautiful UrvasI in order to enchant Indra, who had attempted, likewise by sending nymphs, to disturb the former’s serenity of mind when he practised austerities. This part of the story is in harmony with Kalidasa’s version:324 all the nymphs who were seducing the sage Näräyana felt ashamed at the sight of this lady who was then produced from his thigh, but in the famous play of the great poet it is Indra who reunited the couple. In his Kathäsaritsägara Soma- deva (Xlth century) introduces Pururavas in the very beginning of the narrative (17,4 ff.) as an earnest worshipper of Visnu who, being worried by the sufferings of his devotees, orders Närada to make Indra give UrvasI to the king, who at the end of the story recovers her, after the painful separation, through Visnu’s help, which the god, propitiated by Pururavas’ tapas, willingly renders to him.It would be most interesting to possess a large collection of instances of this Visnuization or Sivaization which, in Indian religious literature, is a frequent occurrence.325 It would not only show that not rarely one of the new great gods ousted Indra and others from a central place in a legend or narrative but also deepen our insight into the mutual relations between Siva and Visnu themselves.326 I need not recallFOLKLORE, MYTH AND LITERATURE I35"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"the well-known fact that already at an early date Visnu was credited with part of Indra’s achievements :327 in one of the plays attributed to Bhâsa328 Upendra’s, i.e. Visnu’s foot, ‘which is a great treat to all the worlds and which with its slender dark-red nails sent Namtici whirling through the sky’, is invoked to protect the audience: in older texts this deed is Indra’s. Is it however not interesting that Visnu is also in two Sivaite puränas said to have combated Prahläda and the demons Namuci and Sambara, whereas the older version of this story ascribed the latter feat also to Indra?329Attention may for a moment be drawn to similar instances of Sivaization.330 Thus the story of the Täraka battle seems to have shifted, in the course of time, from the Indra mythology to Siva’s sphere. In the Great Epic Indra is credited with the demon’s destruction,331 but once (7, 148, 56) it reads: ‘ as Indra together with Skanda for­merly killed Täraka’. Later on the deed is Skanda’s, and Indra’s share is reduced to that of a mediator who, for instance, seeks the aid of Kama to win Siva’s heart for Urna.332The development of this modification of ancient mythological themes and figures cannot however be reduced to a question of mere chronology. It depends to a considerable extent on the divergent aims of the authors and compilers and on the different characters of their works. The tendency to replace Indra by Visnu and to ascribe to the latter feats which in older texts were performed by the former, is for instance much more pronounced in the Visnu-Purana— which may have been composed between the Illrd and Vth centuries A.D.— than in the Märkandcya which, dating back to about the Illrd century A.D., is not oncsidcdly Visnuitc or Sivaitc.333 Not rarely, moreover, Sivaism proceeded, in this matter, more superficially. Thus the Visnuization of the traditional puränic accounts of the creation of the universe is in the Visnu and Padma Puränas carried through more thoroughly than the Sivaization in Linga, Väyu and Brahmända.334This tendency affects also narratives which, being foreign to the pre- epic literature, originally did not relate with special religious convictions or with the cult of a particular god. A remarkable instance, though chosen at random, is Srlharsa’s (Xllth century) Naisadhacarita. Although this author does not seem to have been a staunch devotee of any deity,335 both great gods arc, in contradistinction to the famous epic episode of Naia and Damayanti, more than once mentioned in his work.

In the Great Epic there is a story about the erratic Durväsas, a reputed incarnation of a portion of Siva,347 who, while given the cold shoulder by everybody else, was invited by the hero Krsna to dwell in his house but made himself guilty of terrible bad conduct finally to bless his host and his wife Rukmin! because they had always subdued their anger: ‘As long as gods and men will like food, so long will everybody cherish the same liking for thee’ (13, 144, 3$). However, this rsi has nothing to do with the churning of the ocean, told in 1, a. 15, 11 ff, which was under­taken, on the advice of Näräyana, by the gods and the asuras in order to obtain the amrta. In the Visnu-Puräna (1, 9) another story of the same eccentric is, by way of introduction, told to explain why it was necessary to acquire that draught. Durväsas wandering and possessed by religious frenzy offered to Indra a garland of celestial flowers which had been presented to him by a nymph. As the god treated the gift disrespectfully, the fsi laid a curse upon him: his dominion over the universe should be whelmed in ruin; to Indra’s excuses and entreaties he remained adamant. From that time Indra himself and the threefold universe lost their vigour, all plants withered and died, and the Daityas and Dänavas, agitated by ambition, overcame the gods in battle. On Brahma’s advice, they repaired, for aid, to Visnu, ‘the god of high and low, the tamer of demons, the unconquerable remover of grief’, who at the end of their long reverential address deigned to show himself 10—v.s.FOLKLORE, MYTH AND LITERATURE I37"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"and enjoined them, in alliance with the demons, to chum the ocean. The gods and asuras, the narrator proceeds, were assigned their stations by Krsna (1, 9, 84), while Hari himself, in the form of a tortoise, served as a pivot for the mountain which was taken for the churning-stick (st. 87). The holder of mace and discus was in other forms present among both parties, assisting to drag the serpent Vasuki (the rope), and in another body he sat, as Kesava, upon the summit of the mountain. Invisible, he, Hari, sustained with part of his tejas the serpent, with another part he supported the gods (st. 90).348 It may be remembered that in the Mahabharata it was Brahma, who, when the gods were tired, prevailed upon Narayana to infuse new strength into them (1, 16, 30). There is another interesting point of difference. Whereas in the Mahabharata (1, 18, 34) Sri is one of the beings and objects which came forth from the ocean and her appearance is described in no more than one line,349 the Visnu-Purana (st. 99 ff.) dwells at great length on her, adding a long passage to give a vivid account of the praise and worship offered to the goddess by the sages and by Indra himself, who seated on his throne eulogized her, the mother of all beings, who abides on the breast of the god of gods, in a long address in which she is identified with the highest ideas and principles. Being gratified by his praise the goddess fulfils Indra’s wishes. The first of these is that the threefold universe may never again be deprived of Sri’s presence, the second, that she will never forsake the man who worships her by repeating the hymn of praise, pronounced by the god. The narrative ends with a list of Sri-Laksmi’s incarnations : when Visnu was Krsna, she was Rukminï, etc.The story was also modified in Sivaite milieus. Durvasas, incensed, because the garland he had presented to Indra fell from the neck of the god’s elephant, uttered the curse that Indra and Kamalâ (Laksmï) would henceforth be separated. Laksmï found, together with the rice, moon, amrta and other precious things at her command, shelter in the ocean, which now was churned by Indra and his colleagues who were much annoyed by her absence. Thus the valuable objects were one by one recovered. When Visnu in the guise of a beautiful woman dis­tributed the amrta among the gods, Siva took offence at the demons being cheated out of their share. He suggested a second churning, but this produced only poison which threatened to consume the universe. Everybody left the place, except Siva, his bull and Hanumat, who had pulled Väsuki’s (the rope’s) tail, and who now advised the god to drink138 FOLKLORE, MYTH AND LITERATURE"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"the poison in order to save the universe. He did so and fell senseless on the ground and was thought to be dead, but then cured by his daughter Manasâ.350A good example o f a theme which obviously is revised more than once and therefore shows Visnuite as well as Sivaite features is fur­nished by the well-known story of the descent of the Ganges. Accord­ing to the Mahäbhärata351 Ganga promised to Bhagiratha to descend in order to purify the ashes of the sixty thousand sons of his ancestor, king Sagara, who had been consumed by the wrath of the sage Rapila. Bhagiratha however gratified Siva, who received the weight of the river when she fell from the sky on his forehead. Greater stress on this point— only Siva could in this way prevent the mass of water from crushing and shattering the surface of the earth— as well as on the miraculous power of the ascetic saint is laid in the Rämäyana ver­sion.352 In a different version preserved in the Väyu-Puräna Ganga is detained amidst the god’s tresses353 because of her arrogance. Or her purificatory power is explicitly ascribed to her intimate contact with the mighty god.354 The Visnu-Puräna355 however makes, in this connection, no mention of Siva, but does not forget to emphasize that the river issues from the nail of the great toe of Visnu’s feet or even from Visnu’s ‘highest abode’ (visnoJj paramani padani).The recast of a theme or narrative and the desire to make it subser­vient to the glorification of either god or the propagation of their religions sometimes entails curious insertions356 and transformations. For instance, Bhavabhüti departs from his sources in making Rävana offer his heads to Siva instead of Brahma.357 The Prahläda story as told in the Siva-Puräna358 begins with Laksmï’s wish to wdtness a fight. Complying with her request Visnu takes the opportunity to intervene whenjaya and Vijaya, the celestial door-keepers, are cursed by the Kumâras, beings belonging to the Sivaite sphere. The god takes part in the ensuing dissensions, those concerned in the conflict descend from heaven, becoming avatäras— a probably Sivaite extension of the avatära idea359— Visnu becoming the Man-Lion, Jaya and Vijaya Hiranyäksa and Hiranyakasipu, one of the Kumäras Prahläda, and so Lak§ml has her fight.I can only touch on those numerous narratives which in post-epic times propagate the superiority of one of the great Hindu gods over the older more or less parochial deities. According to a figurative purânic description360 Indra, after slaying Vrtra, had his residenceFOLKLORE, MYTH AND LITERATURE 139"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"FOLKLORE, MYTH AND LITERATUREI40rebuilt— notice the post-Vedic idea of periodicity!— by Visvakarman. As his demands became ever more exacting the divine craftsman turned to Brahma— himself but an agent of Visnu— for help, with the result that this god, in the guise of a boy, informed Indra of the serious limitations of his power and duration of life and of his being but one in an endless series of Indras.It would not however be out of place in this connection to recall once again the numerous compositions which followed the model of the highly successful and favourite Visnuitc Bhagavadgïtâ,361 imita­tions likewise in the form of dialogues not only written in Sanskrit but also in modern Indian languages.362 These gîtas, regarded as com­pendia of religious doctrine and precepts, recited in a sing-song manner, and often even intended to be memorized, profess to have been revealed by a definite deity and preach the worship of that god or goddess. The authors saw it as their main task to prove and to pro­claim that the Supreme Brahman is identical with the deity of their choice. Some of these works arc even aggressively sectarian. The Devl-Gitä,363 for instance, contends that Brahma, Visnu, Rudra, Isvara and Sadäsiva lie at the feet of the Great Goddess; that means, of course, that the other gods are unworthy of a special independent worship, and that any other cult is only preparatory to the path of salvation through the help of Devi. Another feature of these works which were presumably intended for the general public is the readiness of their gods to perform miracles and so to demonstrate their omni­potence. Some of them imitate, for similar reasons, the famous theo- phany of the Bhagavadgïtâ. The imitation is obvious and beyond doubt in cases such as the Siva-Gïtâ,364 which— being in fact a compendium of Saiva theology— docs not omit to enumerate Siva’s vibhntis (ch. 6) and has chapters corresponding to and bearing the same names as the chapters X and XI of the Bhagavadgïtâ.365 This is not the only point in which that ancient work was in structure and composition taken as an example. Like their great predecessor these authors attempted to synthetize conflicting views and thus to place their own teachings on a firmer basis in the hope that they might be a foundation of a universal cult, and first of all to show what is, in their eyes, the best way to salvation. Thus the Sivaite Dcvigïta speaks, like the Bhagavadgïtâ, of the three paths of jiïâna, karman and bhakti.366 This docs not however alter the fact that these purânic gîtas, the Siva, the Devi, etc., appear, on closer examination, to prefer the jiïâna to the bhakti. None of these"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"works seems to have escaped the influence of the upanisads, and so Siva is, in a Sivaite context, said to be, not only the Brahman of those texts but also that which the Vedas establish, the ultimate reality.367 The same work368 quotes a well-known upanisadic story about Brah­man’s appearing before the gods without being recognized by them. When all the gods were completely at a loss, a celestial form appeared and declared the greatness o f Brahman, which now is known and worshipped by the gods. That this^ïfJ uses this story in order to show the superiority o f Siva who is Brahman369 is not surprising.370It would take too long to discuss here also the frequent instances of minor reminiscences, when a Tamil poet calls Siva the One Who condescends to appear in the heart of His devotee in whatever form the latter might choose to contemplate Him371 or when, in another part of India, a eulogy upon the same god372 teaches that the fruit of every work should be (renounced and) laid down on him.373It may be true that each religion, to a certain extent, impresses us to have been to its own adherents sufficient in itself, yet I am not the first to draw attention to the catholicity and comparative impartiality of many Indian authors in matters of religion. To Kalidasa God takes specially the form of Siva,374 the Great Lord (Mahesvara),375 by whose glory and greatness he is much impressed, but Visnu, the Purusot- tama,376 also, receives his meed of devotion. In the tenth canto of the Raghuvamsa he is extolled in a long devotional outpouring: though unborn, he creates liihiself for the protection of the pious; though free from action he slays enemies; though immersed in yogic sleep, he is watchful and vigilant in the preservadon of his creation; unconquered, he is always victorious, and now he promises to incarnate himself as Rama in order to kill Rävana.377 However much the poet emphasizes, in the Raghuvamsa, the yogic aspects of religion and philosophy, the /sons of Dasaratha, who are reflexes of Visnu himself, embody the four aims of existence, viz. duty, the pursuit of possessions and enjoyment and, as the fourth, release from earthly existence.378 Similar observa­tions might be made in connection with other authors. Judging by several passages in his dramas, Bhavabhuti (VUIth century) had at least strong Sivaite tendencies. Nevertheless he salutes also the Sun, Brahma and invokes Visnu as Varäha.379 That Buddhist authors might evince the same impartiality appears for instance from Vidyäkara’s anthology. After devoting three chapters to his own religion this monk and scholar— who probably lived about noo A.D. at the JàgaddalaFOLKLORE, MYTH AND LITERATURE I4I"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"monastery in Bengal— inserted four other chapters on £iva, Visnu and ?ürya, further on to quote from the poetry of Hinduism.380This tendency to inclusive ‘tolerance’ and what Europeans might name liberality accounts also for the considerable number of places in which both gods are described as associating with one another or as co-operating for the same purpose. Thus the waves of the Ganges are not only present at the feet of Visnu who abides in them, but also on the head of Siva who lives at their tips.381 W e are even informed that intentional amalgamations of mythological traditions, for instance combining of the story of Kali with that of Hari (Visnu) was believed to give strength and merit.382In connection with Sati’s marriage with Siva there exists the tradi­tion383 that once Brahma, in deep meditation, praised the Mother of the World, ‘whose quintessential being is both life-redeeming world- transcending enlightenment, and the world-beguiling life-tormenting ignorance of every creature, the Queen who wants no rest yet remains unmoved for all eternity, the Lady whose body is both the tangibility of the world and the supersensuously subtle material of heavens and hells’. When the goddess at last appeared to him he asked her to beguile Siva, who remains a solitary, because no other woman is capable of ravishing his poised mind. ‘ Should he take no wife, how is the crea­tion of the world to continue in its course ?’ She consents to marry the god. It is however Visnu who advises Siva to constitute such a couple with the goddess as he himself forms with Laksmï and as his colleague, filled with emotions by Kama, readily agrees, dissuades him from killing Brahma who, on seeing Sati’s beauty, falls in love with her: ‘W e are three, but in substance one; and this is why you are not to murder Brahma.’384So, notwithstanding the endless diversity of Indian religious life, notwithstanding the co-existence of a few great religious currents and many sects and denominations, the conception of the fundamental unity of all aspects and manifestations of the divine is not lost and the quest for that unity has, also in the classical period, left an impress upon many passages in Indian literature.142 FOLKLORE, MYTH AND LITERATURE"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"NOTESCH APTER I1.

As Varuria’s opponent (I refer to D ie R elig io n en Indiens, I, p. 81) one might rather expect Indra to be the regent of the East (see c.g. W. Kirfcl, D ie K osm ographie der Inder, Bonn, 1920, p. 34*). Those comparatively few texts which address Vijnu and Varuna conjointly (A. Hillcbrandt, V ed iscltc M y th o lo g ie, II2, Breslau, 1929, pp. 69; 325; Kuiper, op. cit., p. 144) do not in my opinion prove that Visnu belonged also to the other (Varuna’s) moiety (for AV. 7, 25 cf. A sp e cts o f early V isnuism , p. no and W. B. Bollee, $adviipéa B rahm ano, Thesis, Utrecht, 1956, p. 38); nor do they inform us of a special position of Varuna in the cosmic classification.

Jou rn a l, I (1957), pp. 33 ff.) may substantiate this contention.

As is well known Visnu is, in ‘the prayer for a child’ RV. 10, 184, 1 (a text believed to be promotivc of successful conception: A sp ects o f early V ifim ism , p. 18) besought ‘to prepare the womb’; this function of the god in ritual maybe a h ic et nunc reiteration of his mythical concern with Aditi’s womb.40.

Like Visnu Soma is in the navel of the earth (RV. 9, 72, 7), and the pillar of Heaven (9, 86, 46 skam bhó d iv d h; cf. 9, 2, 5; 9, 74, 2, etc.); he was also concerned in the separation of heaven and earth (9, 70, 2); he is the king of the universe (9, 6 6 , 2). It is quite intelli­gible that Vijnu—to whom the soma belongs according to É B . 13, 4, 3, 8; cf. RV. 6, 69, 6) —should press the divine beverage for Indra (see above).67. The stanza recurs, with some variants, V S . 5, 19; T S . 1, 2, 13, 2; M S . 1, 2, 9, etc.; cf. also 3, 5, 3, 22.68. Cf. the well-known story A iB . 6, 15, 11 ; K S . 19, IX.69. J B . 2, 68 (cf.

The formula * Vijnu must lead you up’ is interestingly enough prescribed ( M G S . 1, 11, 18) to accompany, in the wedding ceremonies, the seven steps to be taken by bride and bridegroom. For other ritual appli­cation: /ipSS. 13, 21, 3.70. É B . I, I, 2, 13; I, 9, 3. 9 f. ; 3, 6, 3, 3.

For the idea svargaloka see L o k a , p. 167 s.v. It may be o f interest to observe that the sacrificer, in making the strides, ‘may begin cither with the stride on earth or with that in the sky’ (K â tÉ S . 3, 8, 11, 12; cf. $ B . 1, 9, 3, 11 f.). This fact is not in favour of the supposition that Vijnu moves, in principle, only upwards. Cf. also T S . I, 7, 6, 2.73. It is in my opinion very difficult to say whether definite speculations on Vijnu and the number three (e.g. FS. 9, 31 fi; T S . 1, 7,11,1 associating him with three syllables; Kuiper, op. cit., p. 150, n. 86) are due to later reinterpretation of one single original significance of the number. Being characterized by the number three which expresses totality and hence also completion Visnu’s role is on the other hand intelligible in eases such as J B . I, 180; 181; 2,243 (quoted by Kuiper, pp. 145 £; 149 f.) also when one is dis­inclined to accept Kuiper’s starting-points. The co-ordination of Brhaspati with the devas and the upper world (see e.g. $ B . 5, 1, 1, 4; 5, 3, 1, 2; 5, 5, 1, 12) docs not by itself prove Vijnu’s nature as a representative of the totality. Some importance may however be attached to the repeated statement that the whole of existence (bltttvana: the world and the living beings contained in it) is in the cosmic pillar (AV. 10, 7, 35; io, 8, 2). Compare also my remarks in J . A .O .S . Lxxxvn, p. 425. The number three may also be described as the higher synthesizing unity of which the other two arc individual aspects.74. Cf. RV. I, 153, 3 with Geldncr’s note and LUders, op. cit., pp. 66 ff.75. Cf. also RV. I, 154, 6. AV. 17, 1, 6 f. Vijnu and the sun arc invoked conjointly, the former to arise with splendour, the iattcr to lead those praying to the highest expanse of heavens.76. However, part of the ritualists (Taittiriyas, Kathas) wanted to extend the number of the strides to four (the last one to be made without moving !), the last stride being intended ' to step across the quarters of space ’, which means to master the whole of the universe (cf. J. C. Heesterman, T h e ancient Indian royal consecration, Thesis, Utrecht, 1957, p. 104 f.) ; see e.g. T S . 1, 6, 5 (and the note by A. B. Keith, T h e V ed a o f the B la ck Y a ju s Sch o o l, Cambridge, Mass., 1914, p. 88); 1, 7, 5, 4; Äp^S. 4, 14. 6 ff (and see especially the note by W.

In both cases the successful performer of the rite is convinced to have gone to ‘heaven’ (É B . 1, 9, 3, 14; $ £ S . 4, 12, 7). The theoretical basis of the fourfold ceremony is no doubt the assumption of a tripartite universe consisting of equivalent parts.77. A sp ects o f early V iftiu ism , pp. 11 ff78.

I am afraid this view cannot be substantiated by textual evidence.86.

Even robbers, while unwittingly pronouncing Siva’s name Hara (which also means ‘take away’), acquire, according to popular talcs, much merit.130. The number 1000 (which in fact is not exact) means ‘the All, totality’ (sarvam : e.g. É B . 4, 6, I, 15) and indicates divinity, celestial life, etc. (T o k a , p. 88, n. 70).

Even those who like Edgcrton, T h e Bhagavadgïtâ, p. 31 arc firmly convinced of Krsna’s being, in the Gita, an avatàra or manifestation of Visnu will have to admit that the text itself docs not offer strong proofs. B liG . io, 21 ‘of die Adityas I am Vi$nu, of the celestial luminaries the sun, etc.' only shows that in the agcs_of the author Vi?pu occupied a prominent place among those gods who arc known 3S Ädityas. The vocative visito put into Arjuna’s mouth (10, 24; 30) seems to express the latter's conviction that the divine manifestation of which lie is a witness cannot be but the highest god known to him; in his eyes the epiphany cannot be simply Krsna’s but must be that of a more exalted being. So he suggests Krsna’s being a manifestation of Visnu. Krçna himself is, however, silent on this point.71. I refer to D ie R e lig io n e n In d ien s, 1, pp. 236 ff72. S. C.

S . , Li, pp. 108 ff According to this scholar the hymn (p. 108) ‘contains a number of lexical and mythological integers drawn from the sphere of die related deines Agni, Sürya and Vif nu’, so that ‘it seems probable that Purusa has his chief importance as a blend of these derivate elements, which arc treated with a rudimentary personification, perhaps faintly re-echoing an old folk notion (cf. P. Mus, in H om m age—L . Febvre, n, Paris, 1953. pp. ii ff), and for the nonce posited as the substance offered at the primal cosmo­logical sacrifice’ (p. 113 fi); ‘ Purusa seems, then, to be a blend of characteristics of(i) Agni, as the typical male, as the essence of plants, ... as the lord of immortality, as the lord of the sacrifice and the sacrifice itself; (2) Sürya, as rising above the worlds to the place of immortality; (3) Visnu, as the cncompasscr of earth, air and sky ...’. As the author has been the first to notice that the evidence is not in all respects conclusive and as part of the terminology applied to Purufa and these three gods occurs—in a minority of cases, it is true—also in connection with other deities—whatever, moreover, the advantages of an interpretation based exclusively on Rgvcdic parallels, it involves the risk of relying on argum enta e silen tio—it would be more cautious to say that the poet of this sfikta has largely drawn on the vocabulary known to other Rgvcdic poets and adapted ideas occurring in other hymns with a remarkable predilection for some ideas and expressions which arc comparatively speaking frequently found in connection with Agni, Sürya, and Vispu. I would therefore hesitate unreservedly to subscribe to the author’s conclusion (p. 114)'‘ (Purufa) is a combination of characteristics derived from them, fused in a rather shadowy way in a new unity, with special reference to the sun’, but there seems to be much truth in his observation ‘The emphasis in the hymn is not on the man-like nature of Purufa, but on his qualities of universality and his functioning as the sacrifice, which last is of"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"NOTESC h .

When in the days of yore several gods went to Brahma, two ancient deities (p u rv a d ev a u , st. 5), viz. the rsis Nara and Näräyana, who so to say draw into them­selves the minds and energies of the gods present, left the place without worshipping him. Brahmä explained that they, endued with ascetic merit and illuminating heaven and earth, had come from one lo ka to the other (i.c. from the ‘world’ of men to the ‘world’ of brahman, Nilakantha). Having become mighty through their own asceticism, and being of great strength of character and heroic energy they permanently (dhruvau) contribute to the happiness of the world; worshipped by the gods and the gandharvas they exist only for the destruction of the asuras. As at that time the gods had been much alarmed because of a war with the asuras, Indra, after having gone to the spot where Nara and Näräyana were practising austerities, asked and obtained the boon that they would assist him in the battle. Thereupon lie succeeded in vanquishing, with their aid, the anti-gods. The text continues by stating that Nara (st. 14), i.c. Arjuna (st. 15), slew in battle many enemies of Indra, among whom was the asura Jambha, to state further on (st. 17) that Näräyana also has, in this world, destroyed numberless other anti-gods.114. which is also handed down as the 10th book of the Taittiriya-Äranyaka.115.

The process of identification does not draw to a close here. Among the epic names of Vi$iju-Kr$na js also that of the Vedic Vrivakarman, who, being all-seeing, and having a face, eyes, arms, and feet on every side, produced heaven and earth (RV. 10, 81, 3) and who in the brâhmanas was expressly identified with Prajäpati ($ B . 8, 2, 1, 10, etc.; see also Norman Brown, M a n in the u niverse, Calcutta, 1966, p. 2 5 f., whose remarks on Brahmanaspati should not be regarded as final). Surviving on the other hand as an individual deity, the artificer of the gods, he could also fuse with the Puru$a when viewed as the great architect of the universe {M ättasära, 2 , 2 ff.).

In later handbooks of the same community, which maintain the identity of Vijnu, Brahman, and Puruça, the popularity and great importance attached to this ancient text are much in evidence. On various occasions, for instance the construction of the god’s image (I refer to the K â fy a p a -S a tjih itâ , translated by T. Goudriaan, Thesis, Utrecht, 1965; see esp. ch. 43 (transi, p. 135) ; 46 (p. 140) ; 48 (p. 143) ; 49 (p.145))—which we know to be an object of worship as well as a means of attaining by way of meditative concentration communion with God—it is recited together with the Vi$nusükta and other typically Vi$nuite texts; it is of course to accompany the oblations to be offered to God’s mani­festation as Puru$a, but it also accompanies ritual acts which are to accentuate, and hence to promote, the realization of the identity of the individual and the Universal ‘Self’ (K â ly a p a Sa tjih itâ , ch. 78 (p. 237); ch. 57 (p. 166); compare also ch. 60 (p. 175); ch. 67 (p. 195) ; ch. 73 (p. 215), etc.). Similar prescripts obtaining with regard to the recitation of this ancient text in worship whilst installing a new image, etc., occur in the handbooks of other communities (see e.g. M a tsy a P . 265, 26; B h â g P . 10 , 1, 20).155"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"I5<5NOTESCHAPTER III1.

According to the Sivaitc A th a rva liras-U p an isa d , 57 f., the Lord is called Isäna because He is the One who rules all the worlds with His ruling powers, with His generative powers and His highest energies (cf. É v U . 3, 1) and because He rules the movable and immovable (RV. 7, 32> 22); He is called Bhagavän Mahcsvara because he causes the devout worshippers to par­ticipate in higher knowledge and favours them with it, because He gathers and releases (utters) the Word (of the Veda), because giving up all conditions (states) He is exalted by His knowledge of the Atman and the lordly power of His yoga. There is also a variant version of the latter paragraph; see T h e S a iv a U panisads, edited by Pt. A. Mahadcva Sastri, Adyar, 1950, p. 31. Another definition of bhagavän is: 'He who knows the origin and dissolution (of the world), the coming and going of the beings and knowledge and ig­norance’ (Sankara, on C h U . 7 , 2 6 , 2).14.

I refer to Banerjea, op. cit., p. 573, who adds some iconographical details and their underlying ‘symbolism’. Isäna—who is invisible—is, according to Mandana, quoted by Banerjea (p. 574) to be placed on the top because he stands for the celestial vault or space (vyom an o r â k â îa ). For Sadäsiva see especially Haridas Mitra, ‘Sadäsiva worship in early Bengal’, J o u r n a l an d P ro ceed in g s A sia tic S o c. o f B en g a l, xxix (1933), pp. 171 ff ; M.

Mitra, op. cit., There are, however, some differences among the Säkta tantras, the Agamas and the puränas regarding Sadä- éiva’s position, etc. ; jhe tantras for instance consider him only a manifestation of the Supreme Being, the Ägamas identify him. They agree, however, in identifying him with Isäna. It seems that the worship of this figure—that is this variety of the Sivaite cult— was coeval with the Saivägamas and the tantras. He occupies an important position in tantric cosmogony. Archaeological remains seem (as far as Bengal is concerned) to point to the existence of his worship in the Vlllth-XVth centuries.

Bhagavän Näräyana, the Supreme Soul pervading the entire universe, from whom all acts arc said to spring and who may be seen in all religious systems, is considered the promulgator and preceptor of the Pâiïcarâtra system. He is the sole object of the exposition and the sole object of worship. Those con­versant with this religion will enter Hari ( = Näräyana).

I must refrain from entering here into a detailed examination of the relations between Päncarätra and Sämkhya, which arc e.g. apparent from identifications such as that of Väsudeva with the Paramätman, Samkar§ana with the jïva, Pradyumna with manas and Aniruddha with ahamkära (M b it. 12 , 3 2 6 , 35 ff; 12, 327, 26; cf. e.g. V.

There are also other correlations, for instance between the vyühas (and Näräyana) on the one hand and the ' elements ’—for which see e.g. R.

One might, speaking quite generally and avoiding generalization, say that there are three classes of superhuman beings which largely correspond to the groups of the mainly vegetarian upper classes, the middle classes (mainly Itldras) and the scheduled groups: beside the above gods, the meat-eating partly benevolent and partly malevolent deities, who arc more concerned with man’s daily events, and the lowest group of the spirits, who have no permanent residence and contact with whom should be avoided, because they cause evil and misfortune E. W. Harper, ‘A Hindu village pantheon’, Southwestern Journal o f A n th ro p o lo g y xv (1959), (A lb u q u erq u e, N . M e x .), pp. 227 ff., dealing with a region in the Western Ghats of Mysore, draws attention to a terminological distinction: the term d evan t is applied to the unique High God as well as to the gods of the highest group, the terms devote and devint to the members of the two other groups. Of course ‘informants frequently differ in their opinions as to what or who a particular supernatural is’ (Harper, op. cit., p. 234). One should not underestimate the significance of the cults of, and religious practices connected with, the various classes of divine and ‘demoniac’ beings in traditional Hinduism. Even in modern times religious activities may, in a village of approximately 2000 people in the North, occur on over 300 days of the year, every adult person being drawn into some rites or ceremonies. (For particulars: M. E. Opler, ‘The place of religion in a North Indian village’, Soutln v. Journal o f A nthrop., xv (i959), PP- 219 ff.; A. R. Beals, C o p a lp u r , a S o u th Indian village. New York, 1962, pp. S4 ff; compare c.g. also A. Daniclou, L e p o ly th éism e hindou, Paris i960, pp. 547 ff; E. W. Harper (cd.), R elig io n in S o u th A s ia , Seattle, 1964, passim .)2. It must be borne in mind that the name Vaisnavas often covers worshippers of the avatàras Rama and Krsna. European authors and 13ricish administrators were not rarely inclined to use that term quite broadly ; cf. c.g. H. A. Rose, A glossary o f the tribes and castes o f the P u n ja b and the JVIV . Fron tier p rovin ces, Lahore, 1919, I, p. 366, who even goes so far as to apply the term to any ‘orthodox’ Hindu who does not cat flesh, onions, or garlics and does not drink spirits, with the result that ‘the numbers returned at our census as Vaisnavas exceed greatly the numbers returned under any other sect’. In Sindh and else­where the term V a isln ta v means only a ‘vegetarian’ (U. T. Thakur, Sindhiculture, Bombay, 1959. P- 134).3. It should be emphasized that a worshipper of Siva—who is often known as Mahâdcva —is in a similar way not always a member of a Sivaitc ‘order’ or community, although the term is generally applied to those who arc more or less exclusively devoted to his worship (sec also Thakur, op. cit., pp. 108 ff). Like Visnu, Siva is known by many other names. Thus the Anävils of Surat are, at least in the rural areas, almost all followers of Siva under his name Sankara, but Isvar, Rudra, Hara, Sadâsiva, Mahâdcva arc also current designations of the god whose principal attribute is, here also, the power of destruction (T. 13. Naik, in M. Singer, T ra d ition a l India, Amer. Folklore Soc., 1959, pp. 183 ff. (= Jour­nal A m erican F o lk lo re, lxxi (1958), pp. 389 ff). There may, moreover, exist numerous Sivaitc sanctuaries in a village, and the villagers may regard the god as their guardian deity, this does not necessarily mean that they constitute a Sivaitc community (see c.g. also T. K. Basu, T h e B en g a l peasant fr o m tim e to tim e, Calcutta, 1962, ch. VIII).4. However, the greatest gods and the stories of their epic exploits are not well known in all villages.—It may be recalled that until the thirties of this century there was among the Indian population always a considerable demand for brahmans who, having memorized"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"NOTESI72C h. IVpart of the Veda, bear and hand down the ‘Sanskritic’ Hindu tradition consisting of doctrines, ritual prescriptions, rules of conduct, symbolism, versified texts concerning the ultimate truths, the nature of reality, the afterlife, final emancipation, etc. This tradition is only in part Vcdic in character, other components may be called sästric (resting on the smrti literature and related religions and scientific subject-matter), purànic and more or less esoteric. Elements of this tradition arc known very widely, but as an organized, syste­matic whole it is passed down within special groups or ‘orders’ of ascetics, part of which arc bound together by worship of a particular god.5. See c.g. above, n. 1 and W. Crookc, T h e popular religion and fo lk lo r e o f N orth India, Westminster, 1896 (new edition by R. E. Enthoven, R elig io n and fo lk lo r e o f N orth India, Oxford, 1926); D. C. J. Ibbctson, Report on the . . . settlem ent o f the Panipat T a h sil . . ., Allahabad, 1883, p. 142; H. Whitehead, T h e village gods o f India, Oxford, 1921; L. Du­mont, U ne sous-caste de l ’ Inde du Su d , Paris and The Hague, 1957, pp. 410 ff; O. Lewis. V illage life in N orthern India, Urbana, 1958, p. 235.6. The naksatras arc already in Vcdic texts (K S. 39, 13 etc.) presided over by definite deities (Agni, Prajapati, Maruts, Rudra, Aditi . . . Visnu, etc., cf. W. Kirfel, D ie K o sm o- graphie der Inder, Bonn and Leipzig, 1920, p. 35); Rudra and Visnu arc among those gods who arc supposed to reside on various mountains (ibid., p. 103), etc., although in other contexts the same gods are co-ordinated with only a few prominent deities (Indra, Brhas- pati, p. 101), or Visnu’s avatäras arc, in a similar way, distributed over parts of the world. Compare e.g. also the graha-iânti described in VaikhSmS. 7, 13.7. Some remarks on Varâhamihira’s (f 587) B rhatsatphitâ may be subjoined here in substantiation. Together with Brhaspati, Indra, Agni, and eight other gods Vi$nu is a lord of a lustrum (8, 21; 23; 26); diamonds belong, according to shape and colour, to Yama, Vi$nu, Varuna, etc. (80, 8); names arc said to be equal to synonymous terms of Agni, Vi$nu, Indra, etc. (96, 16); Visnu and Rudra-Siva arc among the lords of the naksatras (98, 4 f.), and the rulers of the lunar days (99, 1); there is a comet and a halo of Rudra- Siva (11, 32; 34, 2); this god is (4, 30) mentioned in connection with the ornament on his head; prayers are, in a ceremony, addressed to Siva, Näräyana and three other gods (48, 77); but in a long and solemn prayer Brahma, Vi$nu and Siva precede the names of many other gods and powers (48, 55), a lustration of horses, etc., is to be performed when lord Viçnu awakes from his cosmic sleep (44, 1), and the same figure is as God and lord of Sri praised by all the deities in order to obtain a powerful ensign, viz. Indra’s banner (43,3 f., cf. 30). For the worship of Vi$nu see also 105, 6; 8, a passage obviously presupposing Visnuitc allegiance on the part of the reader: one should on definite days, for personal benefit, worship Vi$nu and an astcrism. Places such as 87, 22 and 25 (a bird in the South- West, the region of destruction, indicates the approach of a Käpälika, a bird in the North meeting a Vaisnava) arc in harmony with widespread opinions (see Lecture V, p. 93)- Nevcrthclcss, there is an interesting contrast between the evil consequences of a portent appearing at images or emblems of both gods: in the ease of Siva it tends to the destruction of land and ruler; in that ofViçnu, of the ‘worlds’ (loka, i.c. of all positions of safety, etc.: 415, 8 and 11).8. It should however be noted that both Siva and Vi?nu, besides their high qualities and main functions, have many other tasks and duties often corresponding to sub-manifesta­tions of their personalities. This character of the gods imposes curious situations in religious practice. For instance, as no brahman would accept anything in charity in the name of Siva who is known to be also the terrific god of destruction, no Sindhi brahman is willing to act as a temple priest of this god (Thakur, op. cit., p. 109). The terrific and or­giastic character of his religion has on the other hand often been exaggerated and unduly generalized. ‘La voie du rituel saiva (the authoress means the so-called Suddha-saiva sans­kritic tradition of the South) sc présente au contraire comme une voie saine et équilibrée, où les facultés de l’être sont utilisées et dirigées, ses besoins fondamentaux satisfaits et peu à peu transformés' (H. Brunner-Lachaux, L e rituel quotidien dans la tradition iiv a lte de l'In d e du S u d selon Som aìam bhu: Som alam bhupaddhati, 1, Pondicherry, 1963, p. XL).9. There are interesting cases of introduction of, for instance, Vi$nu in an or.ginally non-Vijnuite context. Thus Jagaddeva, Svapnacintâmapi 1, 129 (J. von Ncgclcin, D er Traum schliissel des Jagaddeva, Giessen, 1912, p. 136) ‘who, in a dream, performs an act of worship etc. in connection with an image of the All-knowing one (i.c. Siva) will be for-"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"C h .

The distinction between ‘Sanskritic’ and ‘non-Sanskritic’ tradition(s) prevailing in modern anthropologic literature is not satis­factory so far as it is used to define contemporary phenomena, which should be studied not only from the historical but also from the functional point of view. Compare also V. Raghavan, op. cit., pp. 497 ff.11. Thus for instance marriage ceremonies combine ancient (Vcdic) sacramental rites with popular and local features and even members of the higher classes may, also with respect to religion and philosophy, accept a range of belief from the ‘lowest (worship of plants, village deities, goddesses presiding over dire maladies, etc.) to the ‘highest’ (Vedantic philosophy). ‘The lesser and popular belief is neither discounted nor discarded; rather it is conserved, integrated, refined, and informed by higher philosophy’ (Raghavan, op. cit., p. 502). For the adoption of deities see c.g. R. C. Haïra, Studies in the UpapurSitas, 11, Calcutta, 1963, pp. 25 ff.12. Sec e.g. 'Whitehead, T h e v illa g e go d s o f S o u th In d ia ; W. Th.

This seems to be Whitehead’s (op. cit., pp. 132 ff.) assumption.

For the cosmogonie character of this hour-glass-like musical instrument see Miss Marccl-Dubois, op. cit., p. 9, quoting the medieval Tamil poet of the U nm äi Vilakkam , 36 ‘creation has issued from the drum’ and adding (p. 10) * .. . les tambours rituels sont identifies explicitement avec la divinité et ... le rite permet d’agir sur elle par leur inter­mediaire’ (cf. $ B . 5, i, 5, 6; T B . 1, 3, 6, 2). For the outward form of the instrument see Marccl-Dubois, op. cit., 66 and 67; De Mallmann, op. cit., p. 256.30. The significance attached to symbols and emblems may be illustrated by an epic passage (M b it. 13, 14, 102) where all men are held to be Siva’s creatures because they arc distinguished by genitals and not by disks, lotus flowers or vajras which would stamp them as belonging to Visnu, Brahma or Indra. The Sankaravijaya mentions six communi­ties of Sivaites, recognizable by different symbols: the Raudras, for instance, had the tiident branded on the forehead, the Ugras the dam am branded on the two arms, etc. Some general remarks on emblems and symbols may be found in A. K. Coomaraswamy, Geschichte der indischen u n d in d on esisch en K u n st, Leipzig, 1927, pp. 48 ff.

A paraphrasis such as ‘the divinely ordained norm of good conduct, varying according to class and caste’ (A. L. Basham, T h e wonder that w as In d ia , London, 1954. p. 113) is not incorrect but incomplete.52. The willingness to tolerate another’s opinion on intellectual issues is, in European eyes, often amazing but becomes understandable if we realize that the Indians arc deeply convinced that on the intellectual plane no one of us knows the ultimate truth.53. Hence, no doubt, the term dharm a which belongs to the root dhr- meaning ‘to hold, maintain, preserve’. I would not subscribe to Zaehner’s definition (op. cit., p. 3) ‘ D harm a is . . . the \"form” of things as they arc and the power that keeps them as they arc and not otherwise’, suggested by the untenable etymology of Latin form a, which whatever its origin, can hardly have anything to do with the Sanskrit dh[-.54.

There are of course exceptions which are worth studying. When for instance Siva’s image is washed on the day of the great Sivarâtrî-fcstival worshippers of Sri-Kr?na take part in the ceremony which requires the utterance of the mantra fiväya namah (R. V.

The manuals (see c.g. A jitâgam a, 19, 22 ff.) expatiate upon the bits of wood to be used or avoided, their length (if it has the breadth of eight fingers it may contribute to final liberation) and other qualities.67. Among these gods arc Brahma, Vi$nu, Rudra, Isvara, Sadäsiva, Sarasvatï, Lakjml, etc.; see e.g. A jitägam a, 19, 59 ff.68. The reader may be referred to Kane, op. cit., n, pp. 696 ff.69. A discussion of these topics in the relative handbooks (for which see also Diehl, op. cit., pp. 42 ff. ; Kane, loc. cit.) may be preceded by remarks on .the qualities required of the performer of the ritual : lie must know the scriptures, the acts of worship, bc of P°°d character and conduct, bodily bc of perfect shape, bc married, and in circles of Saiya brahmans, have descended from the gotras of the five ffis (Kausika, Käsyapa, Bhäradväja, Gautama, and Agastya), supposedly born from the five faces of Siva.70. For a description of the ritual of (southern) Vaisnavas see: K. Rangachari, ‘The Sri Vaishnava brahmans', B u lletin o f the M adras G overnm ent M u seu m (Madras) NS. II, 2, (!93i).71. ‘But the sam kalpa (which for practical purposes may bc translated by ‘intention’) is still there and preserves to the karma (ritual act) a character of efficient instrument (the formulation of the ‘intention’ comprises also the result the worshipper has in mind), even if surrendered to the will and pleasure of Vijnu’ (Diehl, op. cit., p. 8$)- See also Stevenson, op. cit., p. 219.72. The day of the ‘orthodox’ (i.c. ‘traditional’) Sri-Vaisnava brahman is usually de­voted to the following five pursuits: the rites for purifying one’s own person (abhigamana); collecting the requisites for worship (upâdâna); worship (ijy,i); study and contemplating the meaning of the sacred books (svädhyäya); and meditative concentration on the Lord’s image (yoga). So important are especially the morning and evening devotions to a brah­man, that one who wilfully neglects them for three days is liable to slip back to the state of a iüdra. It may however bc noted that the exact order of the ritual acts may vary very much, and that the acts themselves may also considerably bc shortened for want of time.73. ‘He appears, for instance, as Nara-Nârâyana at Badrinâth, as Kr$na at Mathura, Vrndâvana, Gokula, and Dvärakä, asjagannâtha at Puri, as Vithoba at Pandharpür, as Srinivasa at Tinipati, as Varadaräjä at Kâneï, and as Raûganâtha at Srirangam’ (Mahadc- van, O u tlin es o f H induism , p. 191).74. It may be observed that the meticulous efforts to purify oneself from every kind of‘sin’ or evil may involve also the observation of a variety of customs etc. with regard to the avoidance of inauspicious occurrences, etc.; see c.g. Stevenson, op. cit., pp. 210 ff. Ritual purity is ‘the first path to dhanna, the resting-place of the Veda, the abode of pros­perity (s'ri), the favourite of the gods, etc.’, Hârïta, quoted by Kane, op. cit., n, p. 651.75.

Although it is often said that by going through the process the nature of the image changes because it becomes a con­tainer of supranormal power (“an image is a storehouse of concentrated energy’, M. Rama- krishna Kavi, Preface to A tr i- S a y h it â , Tirupati, 1943, p. vm), many Indians, especially among the theists, arc convinced that the ceremony essentially serves to ennoble the wor­shipper, to realize God’s presence in the image so that it becomes an effectual means of contact between God and himself.

See also Meyer, op. cit., 1, p. 101.116. Ashes are widely believed to avert evil and promote fertility, to purify and fortify those applying them to their body. ‘ Die Asche gilt ... als mit besonders wirksamen, hcilvollcn Kräften ausgestattet, wohl deshalb, weil sic einerseits an die vernichtende Kraft des dämoncnvcrschcuchcndcn Feuers erinnert, andererseits als Überrest des läuternden Feuers frei von dämonischem Stoff ist’ (J.

Hence also the belief that special ashes, for instance those remaining in the fireplace after a sacrifice, are extraordinarily powerful.

Rangachari, op. cit., p. 56 provides his readers with a paraphrastic translation based on tradition. This stanza is, also with the Vaikhänasas, very favourite and used to accom­pany and consecrate a large variety of ritual acts, for instance in worshipping Vijnu ( V a ik h S S . 3, 13; 4, 12, similarly, R V id h . 1, 25, 4).118.

Hall, T h e V isn u -P tira n a , n London, 1865, pp. 249 ff.) and the V ây u -P u rân a 50, 162 ff. record the belief that râksasas called Mandchas, desirous to devour the sun, assail it every day again; the gods and the brahmans however prevent them from succeeding by throwing at santdhy â -tim e the consecrated water which is of the nature of the vajra (Indra’s weapon).149. It is in view of the variants of the Gâyatrï or Sävitri-stanza interesting to notice that MGS. I, 2, 3 makes mention of three different Sâvitrî-stanzas for the three twice- born classes of society.150. Sec c.g.

From these stanzas it appears that the purification called m ârjana, the worship-of the sun, the Gâyatrï with the vyâhytis (bhûr bhuvah sv a h; cf. also M G S . I, 2, 3a), ‘breath-control’ which arc some of the principal constituents of more recent forms of the ceremony were then already ( + 300 A.D.?) regarded as obligatory.151. S B . 8, 5, 3, 7 *... the Gâyatrï is Brahman, and that Brahman is yonder burning disk’; M a itr. U . 6, 3s.152. Interestingly enough some later authors held a different opinion with regard to the relative significance of the elements of the rite. As to the character of the ceremony in its entirety Mcdhätithi (IXth century) on M a n u 2, 101 observes that it essentially is a contemplation of the god called Äditya represented by the orb of the sun as well of the fact that the same ‘intelligent being’ dwells in one’s own heart. We remember that the Sai va and Vaisnava worshippers have realized their identity with God before proceeding to perform this part of their daily rites. (The expression ‘divine self-worship’ used by Diehl, op. cit., p. 83 may create misunderstanding.)153. Cf. C hange and continuity, p. 364, etc.154. Thus Saiva authorities (c.g. S o m a iP . 1, 51) expressly speak of Saiva-samdhyâ. The Nambüdiri brahmans of Kerala perform the sanidhyâ rites up to the present day in accordance with the Vcdic prescriptions without the ‘Hindu’ elements added by other communities. For some information see K. Ramavarma Raja, ‘The brahmins of Malabar', J .R .A .S . (1910), pp. 625 ff.155.

For reasons of space I cannot discuss also other rites, for instance the so-called ‘sacraments’ (satjtskaras: Rcnou and Filliozat, L 'I n d e classique, 1, p. 582) and the customary rites of various religious communities in case of death.168.

It may in this connection be observed that even the two great gods under discussion have not always a sanctuary in a definite region. See e.g. Thakur, S indlii culture, p. 135.188. This is the so-called p a rä rth a p ü jä , lit. ‘the worship (cult) for the sake of others’ as distinguished from the â tm â rth a p û jâ . Although there exist manuals for cither variety many may serve both purposes. It seems worth recalling that in contradistinction to the Vedic rites these Hindu services may be held by any qualified member of the community. They arc, moreover, obligatory.189. Some particulars will be mentioned further on.190. See W. Caland, V a ikh â n a sa sm â rtasü tram , Calcutta, 1929, p. xv f.191.

The historical development of the total complex of ritual acts known as p iijä may, in the main points, become clear by comparative study of the older handbooks and the younger manuals and commentaries which even in the Vaikhänasa community give a much greater place to practices of a Tantric character.198.

I cannot dwell here on the differences in importance attached, in later times, to the two schools of Sri-Vaisnava thought, the Tengalais who hold a one-sided prapatti view of life and emphasize the devotee’s disposition and state of mind and the more conservative Vadagalais who arc rather inclined to believe in the efficacy of rites, yoga, myths, etc. For these differences in general see A. Govindacharya, in J . R . A . S . (191°)* p. 1103 f. Some ritual particulars are the following: during worship Sanskrit mantras predominate among the Vadagalais, Tamil among the Tengalais. On a frâddha day the former offer food also to the äcäryas and brahmans representing the deceased ancestors, the Tengalais only to God. The Tengalais regard the hearing of a special mantra as equi­valent to prapatti, the others reject this view. (See also Rangachari, op. cit., pp. 45 ff)*204. See e.g. J. N. Farquhar, A n ou tlin e o f th e relig iou s literature o f In d ia , Oxford, 1920, p. 196 f.205. Renou and Filliozat, L ’ In d e classique, 1, p. 577 f.2 0 6 . The Vaikhänasas have not only preserved numerous Vcdic mantras, mostly taken from the Rg- and Yajuh-Samhitäs, but also possess a considerable number of Sanskrit formulas which are their own and not known from elsewhere. These mantras were col­lected and edited: Vaikhänasamantraprasna, V aikhänasagrantham ala, 7, Madras, 1920. (For the often incorrect Sanskrit of the Vaikhänasa texts sec also W. Caland, O n er Uet V aikhanasasutra, Amsterdam Academy, 1926, pp. 1 ff.) The Sri-Vaisnavas use both San­skrit and Tamil (sec the preceding note).207. This has practically resulted in the development of an independent Tamil school of âivaite thought and ritual based on Tamil works based on Sanskrit authorities, the oldest of which date back to the Xllth century.208. The Indian name for such a community transmitting an established doctrine and traditional rites of their own is saippradâya.209. Minor differences in execution should not detain us here.210.

Compare V a ik h S m S . 4» 11 where Caland incorrectly translated sakalam by ‘complete’.232. Sec above, note 299. For the invocation of gods into this vessel see V a ik h S m S .233. In the ease of an immovable image the invitation to come and the dismissal arc omitted (B a u d h G P S . 2, 14). The same rule obtains in places where a permanent Unga has been installed (ibid. 2, 17).234. It is emphasized that the formulas to be pronounced make God comply with the worshipper’s request to enter the movable image. These mantras arc the very frequently used stanza RV. 1, 22, 17 ( T S . 1, 2, 13, 1, etc.) idaip vifitur v i cakram c trcdliâ n i dadlic padam J sam üljiam asya pâinsure ‘Over this Vi§nu strode; thrice did he set down his foot; (all) is gathered in its dust’, which, expressing Vi$nu’s striding (P B . 20, 3, 2), is (P'S. 5, 15; A iB . I, 17, 7; $ B . 3, 5, 3, 13, etc.) in Vcdic ritual to accompany an offering made in the track on the right of the right soma cart, an expiatory ceremony in connection with the Agmhotra (T B . 2 , 7, 14, 2; É B . 12, 4, 1, 4 f.), and other ritual acts (/ïpSS. 2 , 6 , 1; g t if 11; 9, 6, Il etc., É G S . 5, 2, 6), and V M P . 8, 21 àyâtu bhagavân purusas saganas sasainyas salrisahâyas salta devatäbhir anti m anyatäm , used Kîê .J ii. 25 in inviting God’s la k ti to appear; 68 when the officiant causes water which is identical with God’s power to flow on the head of the immovable image in order to consecrate it.235- This part of the ritual which in an elementary form occurs already in the sutra (4, 12) was in the course of time much enlarged; the number of the mantras accompanying each act, in the sutra usually one, increased. For particulars see Goudriaan, D a ily w orship.236. RV. I, 154, 5; T B . 2 , 4, 6, 2, which A iB . 1, 17, 7 occurs together with RV. 1, 22, 17 (see above).237. Even in Tantric and Saktist rites.238. The relations between both types of ritual become clearer, on the one hand from some early descriptions in which the pu jä is included in a regular hoina so as to effect a variety of a fire sacrifice (cf. B a u d h G P S . 3, 7, cf. Harting, op. cit., p. xvm), on the other hand from a survey of the complete ritual as performed in different communities. For the incorporation of the bali see Goudriaan, D a ily w orship.239. According to K i L J i i . 71 ibis oblation should have the shape of a lotus flower in which Visnu is believed to be present; it is made the object of a meditation.240. Compare W. Caland, E en indogcrtnaansch lustratiegebruik, Amsterdam Academy, 1898.241. For particulars see Käs.J n . a. 73 (Goudriaan, K â ly a p a 's B o o k o f w isdom , p. 215).242. With regard to the latter prescript (cf. also V iD h É . 65, 15; V a ik h S m S . 4, 12) the Vaikhânasa authorities arc unanimous, some of them adding other formulas.243. This is already prescribed in the sutra: V a ik h S m S . 4, 12; see also B a u d h G P S . 2, 14. The accompanying mantras are O tp namo näräyanäya and O tp nam o bhagavate väsudevaya.244- I refer to Rangachari, op. cit., pp. 135 ff; V. N. Srinivasa Rao, Tirupati, Madras, 1949. pp. I ff; Diehl, op. cit., pp. 152 ff. The sadanganyâsa to be observed by this com­munity is only to a certain extent similar .to the brahm anyasa o f the Vaikhanasas of which it is the counterpart. For the Sivaite counterpart see Nowotny, op. cit., pp. 115; i33-245. See also Diehl, op. cit., p. 84 f.246. At a certain moment God, who is always in the arcaka’ s heart, is thought to come out through his right nostril. This is one of the views which these Vijpuites have in com­mon with Sivaites (see p. 84 and compare e.g. also Nowotny, op. cit., p. 143).247.

Not infrequently inserted narratives and, especially, short passages or incidental remarks impress us as the result of a recast or secondary addition. Thus when Visnu, in connection with a vrata implying his worship in his manifestation as the naksatra Purusa, is said to be ‘but an incarnation of the divine essence of Siva’ (A g n iP . 196, 8 naksatrapuruso uisntth p u ja m y a h sivatm akah).122.

According to Madhva this appears from texts such as RV. 7, 40, 5; 10, 125, 5. In the next period of the universe a last rebirth awaits Rudra and Urna, thereupon to come to Visnu’s presence.125.

That the supremacy of cither god can assume enormous proportions is in itself not surprising; the conclusion drawn from this that even social and religious unrest, rise of Sivaism and other cults, and apostasy from the Vi$nuite religion, etc. take place on the initiative and authority of Vijnu through the agency of his servant and executor Siva is however another indication of the extreme consistency with which Hinduism likes to follow up a definite line of thought. Some instances are (without references to the original texts !) given in W. Eidlitz, D e r G la u b en u nd die h eilig en Sch riften der lu d er, Olten- Freiburg, i B., 1957, P- 77 £)•132.

The main tenets of the ‘materialists’ called after their founder Cärväka concern the exclusive reality of the phenomenal world, the sole authority of perceptual evidence and the denial of any statement or view with regard to the existence ofa* soul’, survival after death, or the karmic effects of deeds.

In some parts of the D ev t-B h a ga v a ta -P u ra n a Vijnu is glorified as the highest deity (12, 8, 1), elsewhere Siva (5, x, 3; 20 f., etc.).140. Besides, there arc many shrines dedicated to some particular manifestation of the Supreme Isvara.141. R âm ottaralapanïya-U panisad 1; 4 (for a translation sec P.

Origin legends and similar local traditions not rarely lift a tip of the veil hiding the history of the interrelations between both confessions in a definite region. According to a legend, handed down in purâijas and the Kapila-Samhitä, there was, in the beginning, in Bhuvancsvara (Orissa), only a single great mango forest. At a given moment Siva decided to leave his residence in Benares because it had been spoiled for him by throngs of unbelievers, and to move on to that mango forest. However this site, known to only a few initiates, was already a dwelling place of Vi$nu. This god, being honoured by his"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"C h . VNOTES201colleague, gave him permission to settle in the neighbourhood on condition that he should never return to Benares. When Siva explained that, and why, this was impossible, Visnu declared that all the sanctuaries of Benares were also in the sacred mango forest at Bhuva- ncsvara. Being contented Siva moved in and settled down (see Von Glascnapp, H eilige S tä tten , p. 94 f.). The legend clearly reflects the greater antiquity of Vijnuism in that place —it is perhaps warranted to hold (with H. Zimmer, T h e art o f Indian A sia , New York, 1955, p. 272) that the Visnu cult had taken possession of a pre-Aryan tree sanctuary—and of a harmonization of the rival cults emphasizing the importance of the new centre. See also Von Glascnapp, op. cit., p. 122 f. on the Viçnuite elements in Nepalese Siva worship.143. For the special development of this tendency in Indonesia (Bali !) which was doubt­less furthered by indigenous views of the world now see P. Zoctmuldcr, in W. Stöhr and P.

The Linga-Puräna inserts a hymn of praise consisting of Siva’s names and pro­nounced by Narasimha (1, 96, 76 ff).

We arc indeed under the impression that religious quarrels on these points also could flame high.181. Cf. also Râmânuja, V edärthasaipgraha 112 ‘Docs not the Vijnu-Purâna (1, 2, 66} tell us that the members of the Trimurti arc equal ?

Das, É a k ti or d iv in e p o w er, Calcutta, X934, P- 194- It is in this connection interesting to notice that ancient puränic traditions are in several cases more superficially Sivaized than visnuized.185.

Similar statements however occur also in Vi$- nuite works: B h â g P . 4, 7, 16 ff Vi§nu, being propitiated by Daksa after his reconciliation with Siva, received offerings and was praised by all including Rudra, Brahma, and Indra, after which he told Dak$a that he was not different from Siva and Brahma.

I cannoj: attach much value to such explanations of the alleged identity of both great gods as that proposed by Kantawala, op. cit., p. 186 : ‘ Vi$nu represents one of the solar aspects and Siirya and Rudra are connected with each other’, hence the oneness of Visnu and Siva.C ll.

Once Siva arose from a lake, in the form of a U nga, composed of splendid jewels and approaching a woman who had bathed in that lake, gathered lotuses and meditated on him, was worshipped by her, and then she took her lyre and played upon it. . .

S. Thani Nayagam, Landscape and poetry. A stu d y o f nature in classical T a m il po etry, London, 1966, p. 17). Hence statements about the print of Visnu’s feet being worn on Ills devotees’ foreheads in sacred paste (Pcrumäl, op. cit., 5, p a ssim ); Sundaramürti in F. Kingsbury and G. E. Phillips, H y m n s o f the T am il S a iv ite S a in ts , Calcutta, 1921, p. 78 ‘Linked to naught else in life, my mind thinks only of Thy holy feet’. Näräyäna’s foot is said to support the earth (M â rk P . 56, 1). See e.g. also Bankcy Bchari, M in strels o f G o d , I, Bombay, 1956, p. 49. Worship of God’s feet (for which see e.g. W. Kirfcl, S y m b o lik des H in d u ism u s und des Jin ism u s, Stuttgart, 1959, p. 90) may lead to union with Him and therewith to enlightenment and salvation.104. I cannot enter here into a systematic discussion of those works of literary art which deal with epic and other themes connected with the great gods, for instance Bhä- ravi’s K ir â tâ r ju n ïy a describing how Arjuna, after practising asceticism, and being engaged in a conflict with Siva, under the guise of a Kirâta, obtains the weapons which he desires from the god—the recurrence of the name of Lak$ml in the concluding stanza of every canto is no doubt more than mere homage—; or Vâgïsvara’s H aravijaya dealing with the slaying of Andhaka by Siva (sec e.g. A. B. Keith, C la ssica l Sanskrit literature, London, 1927, p. 56 f.). In expanding traditional narratives are often enriched with episodes and digressions which tend to make the gods’ images and the ideas associated with their characters increasingly varied and perfect. The story of the events preceding Skanda’s birth—who after, in the M a h â bh â ra ta I, 60, 20 f., having been Agni’s son, is produced through this god’s intermediary, from Siva’s seed—is made more attractive by the episode of Agni being sent in the guise of a parrot to Siva and Pärvati, by the description of the amorous sports and love-quarrels of that divine couple, and by references to Pârvatî’s severe asceticism for the transformation of her dark complexion into a white one in order to please her husband (cf. M a tsy a P . 158, 21 ff.).105. Compare K. S. Ramaswami Sastri, T h e suprem e epic o f devotion, Tirupati, 1953, P- 20-106. ‘Somewhere in the ocean of Indian religious literature one may find each trait of the one god represented also in the other’ (D.

Neither this relation nor the aim of the ascetic practice is clearly indicated in the poem, but Umä-Pärvat! is a reincarnation of Sati, a daughter of Dak$a (Käl., K u n i: I, 21) and Siva had started his ascetic way of life after his conflict with the latter (cf. I, 54).205. Käl., K u m . 3, 58; 69.206. Some of the relevant passages of the narrative literature arc worth studying. Thus Somadeva (Kss. 71, 127 ff) tells us the story of the wicked Kanakamanjari who would perform with all due rites an incantation for obtaining control over an imp of the fever- demon, who has the power of removing fever, so that she herself might be able to cure those who suffer from that disease. For that purpose she left the women’s apartments, secretly and at night, by a postem-door and, sword in hand, made for a deserted temple of Siva. There she killed a goat and anointed the linga with its blood, making also an offering to it ofits flesh; then she threw the animal’s entrails round it by way of a garland, honoured it by placing on its summit the goat’s heart, fumigated it with the smoke proceeding from the goat’s eyes and presented to it the animal’s head by way of oblation. After having smeared the front of the sacrificial platform with blood and sandalwood she painted on it a lotus with eight leaves, and on its pericarp a representation of the demon of fever— with three feet and three mouths, and with a handful of ashes (which arc believed to con­vey misfortune and are often used in magic rites) by way of weapon—and of his attendant imps, whom she summoned with a spell, to complete this rite with an oblation of human flesh.207.

In portraying all his loves as married women, the story emphasized the supremacy of love over duty and the need of the soul to allow nothing, not even morals, to stand between itself and God’ (and J. C. Ghosh, B en g a li literature, Oxford, 1948, p. 37 f.) ‘Even today there is nothing sweeter to the Indian heart than such images as Krçna playing the flute by the waters of the Yamuna, Kr$na playing games with his friends in the fields and woods, and making love to the milkmaids in the kadam ba groves’. In order to demonstrate the im­portance of the love of God as an incentive of human activity Tulsidas would, in later times, point to such examples as Bharata who, for. the sake of God, left his mother, Prahläda who left his father, the gopis who left their husbands.

It may suffice to draw attention to some quotations from South-Indian poets, the former paralleling the relation between the human soul and God on the one hand with the flower and the source of its life on the other: ‘Like a lotus which refuses to open to any warmth other than that of the sun, his soul will not melt at any influence but VisnuV (Perumäl, T in n ito li 5, 6), the other illus­trating the ambiguous role of nature in divine history: ‘The same sea which tosses its waters as though it were shaking up a mat for Visnu to sleep on lies between Visnu-Räma and his hope to recover Sita’ (cf.

The dance which he executes in the Chidambaram Temple and which forms the well-known motif of the Nataräja images expresses one very fundamental idea. It repre­sents his five activities: emanation or unfolding which arises from the drum held in one of his right hands; preservation or duration, imparted by his other right hand which is uplifted in the sign of safety; destruction or, rather, re-absorption symbolized by the upper left hand which bears a tongue of flame; hiding the transcendental essence behind the garb of apparitions, and the bestowal of grace and release made visible by one foot which is held aloft, and to which the hands are made to point. The other foot, planted on the ground and on which in the well-known images the god balances himself, gives an abode to the tired souls struggling in the samsara.294. Subandhu, V as. 165.295. H.

In a very ingenious stanza (M âlatûuâdhava 5, 23) consisting of four times 54 syllables Bhavabhüti describes Cämundä (a form of Durgä) executing the Tändava dance while having the same appearance and paraphernalia as Siva is associated with when making these rhythmic movements. While dancing the goddess wears an elephant hide with big nails protruding which accidentally pierce through the moon which is on her head with the result that the nectar begins to ooze out falling upon the skulls worn bv the goddess; these skulls begin to live and start a loud laughter; all creatures become afraid and begin to pray the goddess for protection. The black serpents she uses as armlets arc pressed, emit flames of poison so that the goddess tossing her arms comes to displace mountains. The quarters of the universe arc sewn by the circular movement like that of a fire-brand caused by the whirling of her head terrible through the rays from her third eye, the flag attached to her club tossing away the stars in the firmament. The goddess dances so perfectly that all minor deities begin to applaud loudly in appreciation. ‘Near the fair Umâ, who beats the time, you will see £iva dancing in a graveyard the dance of Destruc­tion and the swift dance of Time, the same that he performed with faultless rhythm, at the request of all the gods, when an arrow of fire, guided by his will, destroyed the three flying cities of the Titans’ (Ilangö Adigal, S hilap padikaram , translated by A.

I drew attention to the frequent references in Sanskrit literature to girls playing at ball. In some eases the ritual significance of this en­tertainment is beyond doubt, for instance Dandin, D k c . 6 where a young girl is, at fixed dates, to play at ball in honour of Pârvatî in order to find an excellent husband. In the same work, 4 a princess goes with her girl friends to a forest in order to worship Siva with such a game (madanadam anârâdhanâya nirgatya ... kandukenânukridam ân âm ).303.

Lambert, London, 1967). This ‘poem’ written in a form of rhythmic prose is mainly based on the Bhagavadgltä, but puräpas have supplied the author with a wealth of additive material with which to elaborate and illustrate Ins teachings, the whole work comprising roughly nine thousand stanzas.363.
