IntRoDuCtIonYoGA PoWeRs AnD ReLIGIous tRADItIonsKnut A JacobsenThis book is about a neglected topic in the research on yoga and south Asian meditation traditions: the yoga powers, the extraordinary capacities that, according to many south Asian religious traditions, are gained by the yoga practice of meditation and concentration Yoga powers are forms of extraordinary knowledge, such as awareness of previous rebirths, knowing the minds of others, seeing distant and hidden things, and remarkable abilities such as the power to become invisible, enter others’ bodies, fly through the air, and to become dis-embodied for a period of time, which are traditionally thought to be attained as yogins progress in their practice This is not a minor issue in the textual traditions of yoga A large part of the Yogaśāstra (YŚ), that is, the combined Yogasūtra (Ys) and the Vyāsabhāṣya (VB) (also called Yogabhāṣya), the foundation text of the Yoga system of reli-gious thought (the Yoga darśana or Pātañjala Yoga), is devoted to the yoga powers and one of its four chapters is named after the powers (the third chapter, the Vibhūtipāda) This book started as a panel at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Religion in Chicago in november 2008 1 The purpose of the panel was to compare the yoga powers in different south Asian traditions of yoga and meditation, to investigate the role of the powers in the origin of yoga, their position in the development of different yoga traditions and their influence on the religious traditions in south 1 The contributions of the panelists (Bradley s Clough, David v Fiordalis, Knut A Jacobsen, Lloyd W Pflueger, David Gordon White) have been included in the book several other authors were invited to contribute chapters to the book to expand on Pātañjala Yoga (Christopher Key Chapple, stuart Ray sarbacker) and to cover some of the areas that were not dealt with by the panel such as the yoga powers in the Mahābhārata (Angelika Malinar), in Chinese Buddhist texts (Ryan Richard overbey), in Jainism (Kristi L Wiley), in Haṭha yoga traditions (James Mallinson, sthaneshwar timalsina), in tantric Śaiva traditions (somadeva vasudeva), in hagi-ographies (Patton Burchett, Antonio Rigopoulos) and in some contemporary move-ments and traditions (Ramdas Lamb, Jeffrey J Kripal)"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"knut a

knowledge? to what degree were conceptions of the divine in south Asia influenced by the idea of yoga powers? And to what degree were yoga powers shaped by conceptions of divinity? How were conceptions of the divine shaped by the idea of yoga powers? What is the religious meaning of the pow-ers? How do the yoga powers differ in the various traditions and what are the similarities? Also, how are the yoga powers to be distinguished from other traditions of superhuman powers? When are powers yoga powers and when are they tantric powers? terminologyto attempt to answer some of these questions, attention needs to be paid at the outset to the terminological variety for the yoga powers in the textual traditions several sanskrit terms are used for the yoga powers In the Yogasūtra a number of different sanskrit words are used for the powers attained by yoga practice: jñāna (‘knowledge’ and ‘extraordinary knowledge’), aiśvarya (‘mastery’), siddhi (‘accomplish-ment’, ‘attainment’), and vibhūti (used only as the title of the third chapter; ‘pervading’, ‘omni-presencing’; for this translation, see the chapter by David Gordon White in this volume) Jñāna is the word most commonly used for yoga powers in the Yogasūtra,2 and vibhūti is used in the title of the chapter that deals with the powers Siddhi (in plural siddhayaḥ) is used to refer to yoga powers in the Yogasūtra 4 1 3 In the Mahābhārata, bala (‘power’, ‘might’) is perhaps the word used most often as a designation for yoga powers In haṭhayoga works a term used frequently is guṇa somadeva vasudeva, in his chapter in this book, notes that in some tantric Śaiva textual traditions yoga powers are called guṇāṣṭaka, and in these texts the word siddhi does not denote yoga powers per se In the Indian Buddhist texts the com-mon term for the yoga powers is iddhi (Pāli) (and its Buddhist sanskrit equivalent ṛddhi [‘accomplishment’]), and abhiññā (‘higher knowl-2 Gerald James Larson and Ram shankar Bhattacharya, eds , Yoga: India’s Phi-losophy of Meditation (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass 2008), 124; and chapters in this book by stuart Roy sarbacker, Chris Chapple, and Lloyd Pflueger 3 The word siddhi is also used in a non-technical sense in Yogasūtra 2 43, 2 45, and 3 37 (kāyendrasiddhir, ‘perfection of the body and sense-organs’, samādhisiddhi, ‘perfection of concentration’, and siddhayaḥ ‘perfections’ [of the senses])"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"yoga powers and religious traditions3edge’, abhijñā in sanskrit) In Mahāyāna Buddhism iddhi/ṛddhi is often replaced by adhiṣṭhāna and vikurvaṇa In Jainism, the word ṛddhi is most common in Digambara texts, the word labdhi in Śvetāmbara texts, and the word siddhi is not commonly utilized (see the chapter by Kristi Wiley) Many expressions are used for yoga powers, but it is the word sid-dhi more than any of the others that has become most well known in the english language as the term for superhuman powers, and siddhi is also most often used in academic books on yoga as a general term or synonym for the yoga powers one reason for that might be the cen-tral role the words siddhi, and siddha, especially in the Śaiva and tantra religious traditions in south Asia (see chapters by Ryan Richard overbey, somadeva vasudeva, and James Mallinson in this book) In these traditions the siddhis are sometimes considered goals of religious practice and the siddha is the perfected master In the Buddhist texts, the use of the word ‘siddhi’ to signify the powers shows influence from the Śaiva traditions overbey demonstrates that the appearance of the word siddhi to denote superhuman powers in Chinese Buddhist texts is a function of the popularity of this term in the Śaiva texts He reveals that ṛddhis were treated as different from siddhis in the Buddhist traditions, and that siddhis did not exist as a discrete category of Buddhist practice before the tantric revolution in the seventh or eighth centuries Also, he asks: “Are they both instances of a general south Asian ‘religious substratum,’ or did one tradition borrow from the other? If this was a case of borrowing, does the differ-ence in name take on a new significance?” (p 140) Mallinson illus-trates a similar development in the texts of haṭhayoga of the concept of siddhi entering the haṭhayoga texts due to influence from Śaiva tra-ditions vasudeva notes that when Śaiva religious activities are classi-fied teleologically into those that lead to salvific liberation and those that lead to enjoyment (bhoga, bhukti), the latter goal is often synony-mous with siddhi There is a great variety in the terms used for yoga powers and this terminology should be studied systematically and comparatively, and hopefully the essays in this book can provide a starting point for such a study In the english language, many different terms are used to translate the words for the extraordinary capacities gained by yoga practice The authors of the essays in this book have chosen different transla-tions, such as ‘superhuman power’, ‘supernatural power’, ‘supernatu-ral ability’, ‘extraordinary power’, and ‘superpower’ The translation"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"knut a jacobsen4‘superhuman powers’, indicates that the powers are capacities to accomplish acts and attain knowledge beyond the ability of most peo-ple other translations that emphasize the same are ‘extraordinary capacity’, ‘extraordinary mental and physical abilities’, and ‘extraordi-nary knowledge’ The powers are also called ‘miraculous’ or ‘magical powers’ and these terms, and the translation ‘supernatural’, empha-size their transcendent nature In yoga the powers are perhaps not strictly considered miracles since there is no interference with the laws of nature by an outside power, which is often the definition of miracles From the yoga point of view they are not disruptions of the laws of nature, but show mastery over nature, in that they are part of how nature works to make an analytical distinction between magic and miracle, therefore, does not work well when analyzing yoga pow-ers from the standpoint of the yoga traditions Patton Burchett argues in his chapter of this book that the distinction is part of the Abrahamic traditions and that it was probably the sufis who introduced the dichotomies of miracles and magic and miracle worker and magician to India David Fiordalis points out in his chapter that by the thir-teenth century medieval Christian theologians had begun to distin-guish between ‘miracles’ (miracula) and ‘marvels’ (mirabilia) Marvels were thought to have natural causes that were not understood, while miracles were events produced by God’s supernatural force Fiordalis notes that this led to an ever increasing awareness where wonder could be replaced by knowledge The south Asian religious traditions know many methods to achieve powers other than yoga Hence, superhuman powers are not unique to yoga Yogasūtra 4 1 states that the powers (in this sūtra called siddhis) can be attained not only by yogic concentration (samādhi), but can also be accomplished through the use of herbs (oṣadhi), sacred syllables (mantra), ascetic practices (tapas), and they can also be inborn abilities, that is, attained through birth (janman) (janmauṣadhi-mantra-tapaḥ-samādhi-jāḥ siddhayaḥ) Belief in at- tain ment of superhuman powers by means of herbs, mantras, tapas, and birth is documented in the history of religions of south Asia in literature on mythology, rituals, and asceticism as the powers relate to gods, goddesses, divinities, and central dimensions of religious life 4 4 For introductions to the topic, see teun Goudriaan,

with a single south Asian tradition because they have most likely been part of sev-eral of the early religious traditions and practices The idea that the powers can be attained by yogic concentration (samādhi) links the powers to the yoga traditions Conceptual ContextsDivinityThe yoga powers belong as much to the religion of Mahābhārata and the Purāṇas as to the philosophical systems Yoga powers have been interpreted as signs of divinity and a transformation of human beings from the human state to a divine state, and the followers of a guru who is said to possess yoga powers consider these powers to be undoubt-edly divine There seems in general to be a close relationship between yoga powers and conceptions of divinity in south Asian religious tra-ditions Yoga powers are not limited to traditions of yoga and medita-tion but are at the core of the religious imagination in south Asia Yogins become god-like and some may be worshipped as divine gurus when they attain powers Yogins are supposed to renounce the pow-ers, but the gods are nevertheless perceived as supreme yogins with all the power that implies Śiva is the Great Yogin, Mahāyogin and viṣṇu and Kṛṣṇa are Masters of Yoga, Yogeśvara A whole chapter (chapter 10) of the Bhagavadgītā is devoted to Kṛṣṇa’s powers (vibhūtis) several of the powers of yoga are similar to powers ascribed to gods Yogasūtra 3 49 and the Vyāsabhāṣya commentary on this sūtra describe a stage when the yogin is omniscient and omnipotent and at this point the yogin himself becomes like the supreme god, Īśvara The world creator is explained in the Yogaśāstra as a previously perfected yogin (pūrvasiddha) (Vyāsabhāṣya on Yogasūtra 3 45) That there are limitations to the yoga powers, in that the powers cannot be used to change the fundamental order of the world, is explained to be because the powers cannot go against a previously perfected yogin’s will This yogin is Īśvara The Īśvara of this creation was previously a yogin who was perfect in powers and became merged in prakṛti (prakṛtilaya) because he had attained complete knowledge of prakṛti but not the India (Chicago: university of Chicago Press, 1996); Harvey P Alper,

having become identified with prakṛti, the material cause of creation, he became an omniscient and omnipotent Īśvara of this creation Yoga powers became a successful way to explain the divine The ideas of yoga and yogin were important for how the new gods of Hinduism (in contrast to vedic religion) and their powers were per-ceived, and the ideas of yogin gods (Yogeśvara, Mahāyogin) influ-enced the perception of yoga and yogins The concept of yoga power, argues Malinar in her chapter in this book, helped distinguish a new type of highest, singular god from other gods (and from yogins as well) The understanding of the highest God as a powerful yogin in control of prakṛti and present in the world with his powers became standard in many Hindu religious traditions Yoga powers explained how it was possible for God to intervene in the realm of action with-out there being any karmic repercussions for him God could be free and liberated and at the same time intervene in the world The yogins, according to the sāṃkhya cosmology, gained access to and united with the cosmological categories (tattvas), and this is the basis of the yoga powers ascribed to them In many Hindu texts such as the Bhagavadgītā, these powers are considered only in relation to the yoga aiśvara, the yoga of supremacy, ascribed to the god Kṛṣṇa, and not to human yogins Yoga powers allow the gods to create apparitional bodies, that is, bodies that appear and disappear on earth and, at the same time, the god can remain the ever unseen, immovable, highest self, although some part of him is connected with prakṛti, the cosmic cause of all creation in some invisible state of being (see the chapter by Malinar) Perhaps the centrality of the yoga powers in the Yogaśāstra is due to the new theistic traditions that arose in the centuries around the Common era, exemplified by the vibhūti chapter of the Bhaga-vadgītā, the Purāṇic traditions and the rise of Mahāyāna Buddhism The important stories of the Buddha’s display of superhuman powers perhaps did not enter into the textual traditions until the early or mid-dle centuries of the Common era (see the chapter by Fiordalis in this book), namely, around the same time as the vibhūti chapter of the Bhagavadgītā and the Vibhūtipāda of the Yogasūtra The display of the yoga of supremacy ascribed to Kṛṣṇa is part of his salvific activity, 5

an integral part of their liber-ating activity Salvific Liberationeven if superhuman powers were also thought to be attainable by non-yogic means, the Yogasūtra does not elaborate on these methods The subject of the Yogasūtra is yoga and its main focus is the concen-tration called samādhi and the salvific goal of kaivalya attained ulti-mately by samādhi The aim of this yoga is not attainment of superhuman powers; instead, the acquisition of these powers is seen as an inevitable and unavoidable part of the salvific process of the yogin, and a topic that yogins need to be schooled in as the powers are encountered in their yoga practice The ultimate goal of the yoga of Yogasūtra is mokṣa and not superhuman powers The powers become available as the yogin masters the advanced stages of the practice In yoga the powers are part of a salvific process, part of a reality the yogin experiences as he or she approaches the salvific goal In addition, according to textual traditions of Buddhist meditation, meditation is the primary means to attain the powers, and in Buddhist texts as well powers attained by meditation are contrasted with powers caused by mantras and amulets In the Abhidharmakośabhāṣya we find a very similar list of superhuman powers (ṛddhis) as those mentioned in the Yogasūtra 4 1, which are also said to be brought about by meditation, birth, incantations, drugs, or actions 6 The powers gained by mantras and amulets, called vidyā, are considered worthy of less respect than those gained by meditation some Buddhist traditions distinguished between transmundane powers (abhijñās) attainable only by Buddhists and mundane powers attainable also by non-Buddhists some of the extraordinary knowledge (jñāna) in yoga is part of the salvific process that is unique to the sāṃkhya and Yoga systems, such as the knowledge of the presence of puruṣa (Ys 3 35) and the knowl-edge of the distinction between sattva and puruṣa (Ys 3 52) There seems, therefore, to be a close relationship between yoga powers and salvific liberation Great yogins are traditionally characterized by attainment of yoga powers and a large part of the Yogasūtra is devoted to this topic, but 6 see Abhidharmakośabhāṣya 7 53: avyākṛtaṃ bhāvanājaṃ trividhaṃ tūpa-pattijam / ṛddhir mantrauṣadhābhyāṃ ca karmajā ceti pañcadhā."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"knut a jacobsen8both the Yogasūtra and the traditional commentaries on the text deny that attaining such powers is the goal of yoga, and instead describe their function as an indication that certain yoga practices have been perfected Yoga powers are an essential part of the folklore of yogis and sages in south Asia and many other categories of sacred persons The powers are often understood by devotees to provide proof about divinity, asceticism, and knowledge These powers were attained by many founding figures of religious traditions, they are generally accepted as signs of divinity, and they are central to the descriptions of the progress towards the yogic goal However, in both the yoga and Buddhist traditions, the texts include warnings that these powers are in fact hindrances that can distract from the ultimate salvific goal Yogasūtra 3 37 states that they can be obstructive when the yogin is in samādhi, but valuable in ordinary life (te samādhau upasargā vyutthāne siddhayaḥ) The Mahābhārata, although describing yogis and yoga powers in a favorable way, nevertheless also states that the “Yogin who is set on practicing mastery (aiśvarya-pravṛtta) with a view to worldly results, goes to everlasting hell (niraya) ”7 The caveat against superhuman powers is also strong in Buddhist traditions, and the Buddha warned against them several times According to the Buddhist monastic rules (vinaya), claiming to have superhuman pow-ers that one did not possess (or presumably was not able to display) was one of the four pārājikas, the four most serious crimes punishable by expulsion from the monastic order, which shows that the powers were considered problematic The seriousness of the punishment is perhaps because such bragging would be detrimental to the monastic institution as it could lead to the Buddhist monks being considered bogus ascetics 8 However, the omnipresence of these powers in the 7 e Washburn Hopkins, “Yoga-technique in the Great epic,” Journal of the American Oriental Society 22 (1901): 333–379 Quote on page 344 The sanskrit reads:Athaiśvaryapravṛttaḥ sañjāpakas tatra rajyate, sa eva nirayas tasya nāsau tasmāt pramucyate (Mahābhārata 12 190 7)8 An ancient tradition of asceticism in India, which might be older than yoga, was the tradition of tapas, the goal of which was superhuman powers Powers attained by these ascetics had similarities to those later described as attained by yogins In a religious environment in which superhuman powers were the norm, all traditions had to claim these powers because denying them would weaken one’s position, Johannes Bronkhorst has argued He further argues that ascetics associated with traditions of yoga could not be expected to deny the powers that the ascetics associated with tapas claimed to possess or acquire

yoga and Buddhist meditation suggests that these powers are more central to the teaching than the warnings should suggest Although these statements present critiques of yogins using the yoga powers for personal gains or lying about possessing yoga powers, the realities of the powers are not questioned undoubtedly, in some tra-ditions in south Asia the goal of the ascetic practices has been the attainment of these powers,9 and certainly the images of yogins in India (and worldwide) have been shaped by the superhuman powers yogins are said to possess 10 Power and purity are often understood as opposites in south Asian religious traditions but they are frequently intertwined in the religious practice, as well as in yoga and meditation There are two sides to yoga, appropriation of power and appropria-tion of knowledge, and there can be a conflict between them, as power has to be given up to realize knowledge Power has, nevertheless, been important and the different yoga traditions have tried to deal with this in different ways The yogin gains the ability to break free from matter and attain salvation as well as power over the world by means of his yoga powers 11 Yoga leads not only to control of oneself, but also to control of the world The yogin becomes the master of the world, god-like, but according to yoga traditions, the goal of nirvāṇa, mokṣa or kaivalya also transcends that attainment The yogin passes through passages where the non-vedic ascetic is counseled against the use of these powers” Johannes Bronkhorst, The Two Sources of Indian Asceticism (Delhi: Motilal Banarsi-dass, 1998), 90 9 teun Goudriaan writes that in vedic religion sacrifices to the gods and asceti-cism were seen as two ways to power and success: “The ascetic by his mortifications obtains the mastery of supernatural faculties His goal may be definitely to escape the world’s plights and sorrow but he might also be motivated by the desire after other things like the execution of power over other beings, or the winning over of a beloved (as Pārvatī did when she desired to win Śiva) or the obtaining of a husband (as Draupadī did, Mbh 1,157 6ff) In fact, in Ancient Indian

his teaching transcends the gods and even the gods need to be reborn as humans to realize the truth of nirvāṇa Divinity according to these traditions of meditation is a lower stage, as are the powers, compared to the ultimate goal that can be attained in meditation We can distinguish in the south Asian traditions two attitudes to the superhuman powers, their unintentional (akalpitā) and their intentional (kalpitā) attainment, that is, traditions which accept the powers as an inevitable outcome of meditation and yoga, and tradi-tions that actively and intentionally seek the powers Yoga traditions most often belong to the first of these whereas the second often char-acterizes the tantric traditions The first might be called the mumukṣu attitude, the second the bubhukṣu attitude The tantric tradition cre-ated a different synthesis of powers and purity than in the yoga tradi-tion because perhaps of the strong presence of traditions of magic and sorcery in the tantric synthesis 12 Many of the chapters document that the powers were thought of as an inevitable part of the salvific process They are thought to be realized, even unintentionally, as the yogin progresses towards the salvific goal A basic presupposition seems to be the principle that to have knowledge of something is to also have control over it Knowing therefore gives powers over the objects known Knowing something is to gain mastery over it, and knowledge is the means to attain salvific liberation 13 But since knowledge is part of the salfivic process, this mastery signifies the process of becoming free from the world, that is, the person transcends the limitations of ordinary people and becomes divine Yoga powers contain this ele-ment of freedom and the powers can thus be seen as not opposed to mokṣa but as part of the attainment of mokṣa That they need to be abandoned in the end does not change this In the process, yogins are thought to change themselves from ordinary persons to divine beings, and the powers are a sign and proof of this transcendence In some traditions the yoga powers are understood to demonstrate that reality is inconceivable as a magical illusion David Fiordalis

Buddha at Śrāvastī and sāṅkāśya are understood as acts that all buddhas must perform before they enter nirvāṇa The display of superhuman powers is an integrated part of the liberating activity of the buddhas It is not, therefore, that one attempts to attain the powers as a stage on the way to nirvāṇa, but the powers are attained automatically as one progresses towards nirvāṇa In Mahāyāna the doctrine of magical illusion becomes important for interpreting the powers Here, Buddha’s powers are connected to his realization that everything is an illusion, and, writes Fiordalis, “the miraculous display violates common expectations or fundamental rules regarding the nature of reality” (p 120) According to the Vimalakīrtinirdeśa, the buddhas and bodhisattvas liberate themselves and others not only through their knowledge but also through their demonstration of their superhuman powers to show that the reality is inconceivable, like a magical illusion In the vision of Bhuśuṇḍa, described in the chapter by sthaneshwar timalsina, the powers gained by absorption in prāṇa (prāṇasamādhi) allows him to see the absurdity of time and sequence in a chaotic progression in which randomness seems to be the only law In theological texts such as the Bhagavadgītā, the display of powers is of primary importance and the revelation of viṣṇu-Kṛṣṇa himself to Arjuna is presented as a display of yoga powers (vibhūtis) The natural response of Arjuna to the display of Kṛṣṇa’s powers is submission and devotion (bhakti) The display of powers is also an important issue in the Buddhist tradition In Buddhism, their display can be seen as a valuable means for generating faith (prasāda) The Buddhist texts try to distinguish between display of powers by Buddhist saints and ‘magic tricks’ claimed by rival ascetics, teachers, and followers The emphasis on display in Buddhist texts also means that there are exam-ples in Buddhist texts of skepticism against displaying them The skep-ticism is based on the idea that non-Buddhists also attain these powers, and that they are not in themselves expressions of Buddhism The Buddhist display of powers, however, is connected to the liberating knowledge of the Buddhist teaching and the liberating activity of the buddhas and bodhisattvas one important function of superhuman powers has probably been to demonstrate the superiority of one’s guru or one’s

study of yoga traditions, several researchers had expectations that investigations of the yoga powers would combine with progress in psychological research on several topics, especially hypnosis, a popular theme in the early twentieth century, and expand our knowledge about human capacities in significant ways 14 The rational approach to yoga powers in the yoga traditions themselves perhaps influenced the approach of the research “India,” wrote the French Indologist, Jean Filliozat, “is the country par excellence for the study of the limits of human powers, as much on the physiological

purely quackish, these techniques have hardly begun to be studied scientifi-cally,” Filliozat noted and optimistically hoped “that an accurate study of the conditions they bring about will enable us one day to establish the laws for the production of such phenomena ”17 Charles Rockwell Lanman, having high hopes for the science of hypnotism, which enjoyed some prestige at the time of his writing, asked in a response to Wood’s well-known translation of the Tatt-vavaiśāradī, published in 1917: “Would it not be worth while for some who is conversant not only with the Hindu books, but also with the results of modern investigations in ‘abnormal psychology,’ to try to separate those of these powers which have some basis in scientifically established fact from those which have none?”18 e

was brought to an end when the research in this type of psychical phenomena disappeared from the universities 23 That also meant the end of most of the enthusiasm for research on the rationality of

agree that some of the major textual traditions themselves give rational analyses of the powers, and they analyze rational discourses of the yoga powers in order to give a better understanding of the dialectical relationship between the yoga powers, traditions of rational analysis, and concepts of divinity and salvific liberation The yoga powers are part of several systems of reli-gious thought in south Asia and these systems attempted to provide the powers with a rational foundation The traditions assumed that the powers could be explained rationally, neither considered unreal nor denied as irrational The Pātañjala Yoga system attempted to provide a systematic and rational analysis of meditation and, conse-quently, in this system we encounter a view that a rational under -standing of the yoga powers was possible The yoga system attempted to give an analysis of the complete meditation process leading to sal-vific liberation The analysis included the powers, how they are attained, how they work, and the part they play in the salvific process Many superhuman powers probably preceded the Buddhist and the Yoga systematizations (and perhaps some originated in other tradi-tions than those that believe they can be attained by meditation and concentration), but in these traditions the powers were given a ratio-nal explanation It seems that the powers of yogins have become an integral part of some yoga traditions, not in spite of sāṃkhya philoso-phy, but because of it In her chapter in this book, Angelika Malinar argues that the sāṃkhya understanding of the world in

argues, allows the yogic path-way to be treated as a gradual conquest of the creative powers of prakṛti which are manifest in the Yogin’s own physical and mental apparatus Yoga powers are an integral part of yoga The story of the yogin vyāsa’s son Śuka is significant as a source of early yoga In the description, his concentration on the chosen object “is preceded by certain postures which he assumes according to a fixed sequence while sitting at the lonely place” (p 38), which are references to his yoga practice His most important power is flying through the air The story also teaches that there is only one legitimate occasion for employing the powers and that is as a means for gaining liberation But in the next chapter of the Mahā bhārata, analyzed by Malinar, yoga powers 35 see

Bhagavadgītā chapters of the Mahābhārata are particularly important for the study of yoga powers In Bhagavadgītā, the yogin who has conquered the creation, that is, has become identical with the cause of creation, becomes free from karma by replacing his agency with the agency of brahman/prakṛti, Malinar argues The divinity of Kṛṣṇa is explained by drawing on the concepts of yoga, and yoga powers are an intrinsic element of the the-ology of ‘cosmological monotheism’ of the Bhagavadgītā David Gordon White also tries to identify the earliest descriptions of persons practicing yoga in south Asia He argues that these are found in the Mahābhārata books 12 and 13 He discusses two themes, the ‘self-magnification’ of the yogin and yogic perception White notes that the most salient area of overlap between the earliest narratives of humans or gods practicing yoga and yoga as described in classical texts is the term vibhūti, which he translates as ‘omni-presencing’ Vibhūti is the name of a chapter of Yogasūtra and the name of the yoga that Kṛṣṇa practices when he displays his universal form to Arjuna It is Kṛṣṇa’s ability to embody himself simultaneously in many bodies that makes him a master of yoga, contends White This ‘omni-presencing’ of Kṛṣṇa resembles the practice of human yogis, as depicted in the Mahābhārata White then tries to identify who these yogis were He argues that they are portrayed as practicing yogis when they enter into other people’s bodies (and he states none of them are described as sitting in fixed postures meditating) and that by entering into every being the yogi ultimately “become(s) the one in the many” (p 68) The second theme, yogic perception as a valid means of knowl-edge (pramāṇa) and as a type of perception that is able to see deeply into things as they truly are, is predicated on the presupposition that yogis are able to “move between, inhabit, even create multiple bodies” (p 74), White argues Yoga Powers and BuddhismYoga powers were

Buddhism were not opposed to early Buddhism, but were perhaps even a response to the importance of yoga powers in early Buddhism Mahāyāna tried perhaps to sur- pass other schools of Buddhism and to represent itself as possessing even more powerful extraordinary abilities Yoga powers in Buddhism are attained primarily by meditation, but also other methods are known such as the use of amulets and mantras Three chapters of this book deal with powers in Buddhism The first chapter, by Bradley s Clough, analyzes yoga powers (“extraordinary abilities directly gained from meditation practice”) in the Pāli path manuals of Theravāda Buddhism These abilities are called abhiññas and include physical powers such as multiplication of bodies, disappearing, walking on water, passing through solid objects, flying, the ability to hear sounds from far-off places, knowledge of others’ thoughts, recollections of past lives, and the ability to see very distant objects Added to these was āsava-kkhāya-ñāṇa, ‘knowledge of the destruction of the defile-ments’, which Clough states was probably added to maintain that the highest attainable knowledge is one that directly conduces to libera-tion, nibbāṇa. The addition of the āsava-kkhāya-ñāṇa shows a tension between superhuman powers and liberation Clough’s chapter ana-lyzes the explanations given for these powers in the meditation manu-als The manuals emphasize the production of phenomena outside of the mind by means of the mind and they contain instructions on how they are actually to be attained The association between knowledge and stages of meditation confirms that one basis for the superhuman powers in south Asia is the idea that knowing something is to gain mastery over it Clough also argues that the increasing emphasis on vipassanā-bhāvanā over samatha-bhāvanā has led to an underestima-tion of the importance of the jhānas and abhiññās in early Theravāda Buddhism David v Fiordalis emphasizes the close connection between yoga powers and the doctrines and asks what doctrinal arguments do the yoga powers help illustrate or establish and what doctrines are put for-ward to explain the powers some texts acknowledge that the display of powers is a means for generating faith (prasāda) while other texts criticize such displays However, a large number of events displaying superhuman powers are found in Buddhist texts Fiordalis states that mainstream and Mahāyāna Buddhist miracle stories grew alongside one another and mutually influenced each other A main question, according to Fiordalis, is whether the

displayed with a purpose—the liberating knowledge of the dharma In the text under discussion, the Buddha and vimalakīrti use their powers in the same way as a magician is thought to work creating a magical illusion The metaphor of magical illusion, reasons Fiordalis, is one of the means used to connect the conventional perspective and ultimate truth Ryan Richard overbey analyzes one of the terms for superhuman powers, siddhi, and its appearance in the sources of east Asian Buddhism In Indian Buddhist literature, the word siddhi, in the sense of ‘superhuman power’, is not used before the rise of tantric Buddhist literature in the seventh, eighth, and ninth centuries overbey argues that there is no evidence of the presence of the term siddhi in Chinese Buddhist texts before the eighth century, in spite of several research-ers using the word siddhi when dealing with these texts one mistake, overbey argues, is to use the word siddhi as a general term for attain-ments A more common error is to conflate the term siddhi with the term ṛddhi (Pāli: iddhi) overbey states that such conflation makes it difficult to understand why Buddhist tantric texts began referring to siddhis and not ṛddhis from the seventh century Finally, he analyzes mistakes caused by the misreading of the Chinese texts In the second half of the chapter, overbey investigates the actual appearance of the word siddhi in the Buddhist texts, and this investigation leads him to conclude that siddhi did not exist as a discrete category in Buddhist practice before the emergence of the tantric traditions The frequent use of the word siddhi from this date, overbey suggests, is because the Buddhist texts imported to China from this date were “thoroughly infused with Śaiva language, rituals, and tropes” (p 141) Great care needs to be taken when comparing Asian religious traditions and overbey’s article opens up interesting avenues for research Yoga Powers and JainismIn Jainism, tīrthaṅkaras, Jain

attained The emphasis on karma in Jainism means that the manner in which they are attained has two aspects, the action such as austerity and the karmic consequences that are the efficient causes for transforming the soul itself The terms used for extraordinary abilities in Śvetāmbara and Digambara differ In Śvetāmbara the term used is labdhi, in Digambara ṛddhi Why this is so, Wiley does not explain, but it is an intriguing fact that needs to be further researched A characteristic feature of Jain discussions of powers is the importance of food Fasting (tapas) is frequently mentioned as a means to attain different powers, and the powers mentioned include the power to transform food that is placed in the hand of a muni into milk, ghee, honey or the nectar of immortality (amṛta) The ability to fly is attained in association with fasting Wiley argues that the Digambara text Ṣaṭkhaṇḍāgama sets the pattern of lists found in later Digambara texts In this text, abilities associated with the intellect have the highest spiritual status among the powers, while healing powers and the ability to transform food have the lowest Śvetāmbara shows a similar pattern In Jainism, karma is also discussed in discourses of the powers Interestingly, karma is mentioned in the context of powers of the intellect and sen-sory perception, but not in connection with powers of healing Wiley suggests that this is perhaps because healing was considered an eso-teric aspect of the teaching Yoga Powers and Classical YogaThe term Classical Yoga refers to the Yogasūtra and the Vyāsabhāṣya and

Buddhist vasubandhu, and this critique, sug-gests Larson, “becomes the occasion for the compilation of a system-atic Yoga that reflects the philosophical issues being debated in this new intellectual milieu ”37 Yoga philosophy is a school of sāṃkhya that blended a number of preexisting yoga traditions and Buddhist meditation traditions with sāṃkhya philosophy It is worth noticing that even though the yoga powers can be understood and explained by means of sāṃkhya religious thought, the Sāṃkhyakārikā has a differ-ent view of the siddhis The eight siddhis of sāṃkhya are not superhu-man powers but quite mundane activities The eight siddhis (siddhayo ’ṣṭau), accord ing to Sāṃkhyakārikā 51, are proper reasoning, oral in struction, study, removal of the three kinds of suffering, friendly discussion, and generosity According to the commentaries on Sāṃ-khya kārikā 48, the traditional eight siddhis are relegated to the cate-gory of delusion (moha) (see the chapter by Lloyd Pflueger in this volume) one of the differences between sāṃkhya and Yoga darśanas is, therefore, the view of yoga powers The Yogasūtra is a text of sāṃkhya philosophy and had to give rational sāṃkhya explanations of the traditions of yoga meditation which included yoga powers Without including them, the Yogasūtra would not have explained yoga Three chapters in this book cover yoga powers

a part of magicians’ shows and in India there has been a blending of different kinds of ‘wonder-work-ers’, but the powers can also be interpreted as akin to fantasies uncov-ered by a therapist or as

Lloyd W Pflueger, starts by asking: “Is yoga about power or peace?” He concludes that “purity in yoga is power ” Power, explains Pflueger, proceeds from renunciation, not indulgence, and renunciation means holding on to that which is pure and letting go of that which is not Pflueger’s chap-ter is a creative interpretation using some basic metaphors associated with yoga practice According to Pflueger, mastering the superhuman powers allows the yogin ‘to inhale’ the universe, while the ultimate form of samādhi, asamprajñāta samādhi, allows the yogin “to exhale and let go of himself and the whole of creation he has identified with” (p 259) Yoga Powers, Śaiva Tantric Traditions and HaṭhayogaThe popularization of the term siddhi seems to be due to influence from Śaiva tantra traditions In the Śaiva tantra texts a variety of powers are described and somadeva vasudeva argues in his chapter that many of the Śaiva powers can be traced back to the earliest sur-viving stratum of tantric Śaivism, the archaic Niśvāsa-corpus, origi-nating circa 450–550 ad The powers are classified here into a tri partite scheme of minor, middle, and superior powers and there is a distinc-tion between tantric powers and yoga powers In the Śaiva tantric texts the yoga powers are often called guṇas (guṇāṣṭaka) and are dis-tinguished from the tantric siddhis (compare also the discussions in Mallinson’s chapter on haṭhayoga texts and overbey’s chapter on Chinese Buddhist texts) The method for attainment of siddhis is also different In addition, the motivating factors for the powers sought by tāntrikas are often quite mundane The main method to attain the siddhis is by mantra repetitions (japa), and ever higher powers are won by increasing the number of repetitions Siddhis can also be asked for as favors when the sādhaka has succeeded in summoning a deity According to some texts, the lower powers such as sowing enmity, magical murder, dispelling, rendering ministers and nobles servile, and winning the friendship of all people, are attained after repeating the mantra twenty thousand times The middle powers of subjugation of all beings, terrorizing, favoring (nigrahānugraha), and easily accomplishing whatever one wishes are attained after thirty thousand repetitions The higher powers are the eight yogic powers and union"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"knut a

meant to generate faith in the salvific efficacy of Śaiva initiation A realized yogin cannot desire siddhis vasudeva also investigates the post-human identities implied in the tantric powers and yogic perception which led to the distinction of two different types of yogins; the first has not yet over-come the differentiation between self and other and the second type perceives everything as himself and realizes that the differentiation into self and other is his own fabrication two chapters deal with yoga powers in haṭhayoga sthaneshwar timalsina’s chapter investigates yoga powers in the story of Bhuśuṇḍa in the Yogavāsiṣṭha Bhuśuṇḍa practiced the yoga of prāṇāyāma, breathing exercises, and the goal for his yoga was immortality Libera-tion, therefore, is affirmation of his corporality According to the story of Bhuśuṇḍa, haṭhayogins strive for immortality through the regu-lation of prāṇa by balancing the two channels identified with the sun and the moon Prāṇa refers here to the supreme reality as it sus-tains life and is found within the body Yoga powers are placed in a positive light in this text and are not obstacles to mokṣa but are the ‘living’ aspect of liberation, and the highest yoga power is Bhuśuṇḍa’s self-realization Through his practice of prāṇāyāma, Bhuśuṇḍa’s aware ness of time becomes completely transformed He attains a trans cendence of time, a mind free from the mental construction of time, and a ‘seeing’ of the universe that is free from distinctions In this state he witnesses the word as topsy-turvy and not in any fixed order Here, time is neither linear nor circular, but a chaotic random-ness ‘Living’ liberation together with its power are here attained through the dissolution of the mental imprints (vāsanā) James Mallinson’s chapter investigates the issue of supernormal powers in two haṭhayoga texts, the Amṛtasiddhi (the oldest text of haṭhayoga dating most likely from the twelfth century ce) and the Śivasaṃhitā (one of the younger texts, dating from the fourteenth or fifteenth centuries) one of the texts, Amṛtasiddhi, exemplifies the attitude toward the siddhis of the mumukṣu, the seeker of liberation, and the bubukṣu, the seeker of superhuman powers Yoga in Amṛta-siddhi means mastering the breath which leads to access to the nectar"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"yoga powers and religious traditions25of immortality in the head by which the yogin can live as long as he wants Implicit in the haṭhayoga understanding is the distinction between intentional (kalpitā) and unintentional (akalpitā) siddhis The siddhis arise spontaneously in the second of the four stages (avasthās) of haṭhayoga practice and are said to be obstacles to mahāsiddhi but signs on the path to mokṣa The yogi should not delight in them nor show them to others The attitude is quite similar to that of the Yogasūtra However, in the Yogasūtra detailed instruc-tions of how the supernormal powers are attained are given It is inter-esting that intentional siddhis of this sort are not taught in the mainstream haṭhayoga texts, Mallinson writes He comments on the terminology of yoga powers where siddhi is used most often to mean success while the eight yoga powers, described in Yogasūtra 3 45, are called guṇas or aiśvaryas In contrast to the Amṛtasiddhi, the concept of siddhi takes center stage in the Śivasaṃhitā Mallinson argues that the importance of siddhis in Śivasaṃhitā is due to influences from the Kaula teachers Interestingly, the famous Haṭhayogapradīpikā and early haṭhayoga texts such as Amṛtasiddhi, are less concerned with the yoga powers than the Yogasūtra and Kaula influenced haṭhayoga works such as Śivasaṃhitā Yoga Powers in Sufi and Bhakti Hagiographiestwo chapters cover yoga powers in sufi and bhakti hagiographies Patton Burchett’s chapter deals with a critique of yoga powers Yogis, especially nāthyogis and tāntrikas, were often constructed as the opponents of sufis and bhaktas The Yoga powers of the yogin were understood to come from his yoga practice and therefore inferior to the powers of the sufis and bhaktas, whose powers come from God The power of God and devotion to God are perceived as superior to yoga powers Yoga powers serve only the individual while the power of God serves all Burchett argues that the sufis introduced the dichot-omies of miracle and magic and miracle worker and magician to India and that these dichotomies are at the center of the narratives of dis-play of yoga powers in the sufi and bhakti traditions These dichoto-mies were part of the Abrahamic traditions shared by Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and Burchett argues that the category of ‘mir-acle’ (as the work of an all-powerful God) had no exact counterpart in the Indian sources

in the Mahābhārata and point to important functions of yoga powers Displays of powers are meant to prove the superiority of the truth of the person displaying the powers In the narratives of yogis and bhaktas, miracles are valuable, yoga powers are not Miracles reveal God’s powers, whereas yoga powers reveal only the powers of the individual yogi Display of magical pow-ers are also futile since they are carried out to attain human goals and not for the love of God Burchett concludes that “it was in significant part through the influence of sufism that Indian devotional practices and attitudes—those viewing the divine as the sole source of power—increasingly took on the tenor of the ‘religious’, while tantric and yogic-ascetic modes of practice—those viewing the human being as the primary source of power—increasingly came to be represented as something akin to the ‘magical’ with all that term’s typical negative connotations” (p 376) Antonio Rigopoulos analyzes the understanding of yoga powers in the life and tradition of sāī Bābā of Śirḍī (d 1918) sāī Bābā belonged to the Maharashtrian sufi tradition which accommodated sufism and Hindu devotionalism He advocated an integrative spirituality beyond the orthodoxy of institutionalized religions However, soon after his death a complete ‘Hinduization’ of him and his tradition was accom-plished and sāī Bābā’s shrine became a Hindu temple But even dur-ing his lifetime his sufi background was downplayed or not recognized by the majority of his Hindu devotees The huge expansion of sāī Bābā’s fame started around the 1970s Śirḍī sāī Bābā’s renown was largely due to his powers In this fascinating chapter, Rigopoulos ana-lyzes the descriptions of Śirḍī sāī Bābā as a yogin and incidents which are referred to as yoga practice in the hagiographies written by the Hindu devotees The aim of the hagiographies is to depict him as an exceptional yogin He is understood to have attained all the yoga pow-ers and Rigopoulos studies the descriptions of him entering into nirvi-kalpa samādhi without pulse or breath for three days, performance of khaṇḍayoga (the separation of hands, legs, and so on from the trunk), levitation, and so forth Like the previous chapter, it raises important questions about Hindu and sufi interpretations of yoga powers and the mutual influences of the two traditions Rigopoulos shows how Hindu devotees interpreted sufi practices as yoga practices The Hindu devotees understood that sāī Bābā of Śirḍī did not come from any yoga lineage and assumed yoga came to him through

contemporary tradi-tions Ramdas Lamb discusses yoga powers in the Rāmānandī sampra-dāya and notes that Hindu ascetic orders have recognized the value of having these powers but also warn about the dangers Although the powers themselves can become problematic, he argues that the most dangerous aspect of the powers is that the desire to acquire them can become an addiction Anything that leads to attachment to the body and the material world is counterproductive to the goal of freedom Most vairāgī initiates are taught to renounce both the yoga powers and the quest for them, but Lamb also notes that for those Rāmānandīs who delve more deeply into their sādhanā, yoga powers become prev-alent The sources for the powers and the intention of using the pow-ers become important for the Rāmānandīs They are encouraged to strive for minor powers such as freedom from hunger, freedom from the effects of the weather, the ability to control heart beat, metabolism and blood pressure, knowledge of past and future, the ability to read minds and karmic status of others, the ability to cure most illnesses, and the ability to speak to and control the actions of wild animals The most important of these for the renunciants are those that control bodily needs The Rāmānandīs distinguish between different sources for the yoga powers one source is the internal, which is grounded in the idea that the yoga powers are always present in the body and need only to be awakened Yoga is fundamental for this awakening visua-lization of cakras and use of mudrās, bandhas, and prāṇāyāma are important methods other means to attain powers are prayers, man-tras, and rituals Powers attained and used for negative purposes are usually hidden In the teaching of the Rāmānandīs, however, there is no yoga power more powerful than the selfless love of the divine Knut A Jacobsen’s chapter deals with a contemporary sāṃkhya-Yoga institution based in Jharkhand in India, the Kāpil Maṭh, founded by the sāṃkhya-yogin Hariharānanda Āraṇya (1869–1947) Jacobsen analyzes the views on superhuman powers held by Āraṇya and his interpretations of the individual powers Āraṇya was a practical yogin and his views on yoga powers are based on his own practice of sāṃkhya-Yoga, which makes his perspective particularly valuable His views on yoga powers are characterized by ambivalence He dis-liked

argues, the powers repre-sent neither the misplaced fantasies of some ‘primitive’ thinking nor miraculous acts of divine agents but signs of a panentheistic cosmos and ‘the future of the body ’ Kripal explores how this is argued by a selection of human potential authors, psychical researchers, parapsy-chologists, and practicing psychists with Asian religious ideas and practices who all relate to yoga and tantra In these persons, the theo-ries of biological evolution and modern physics are merged with theo-ries of superhuman powers of yoga and tantra Siddhis are prevalent in the writings of the authors analyzed in this chapter Kripal con-cludes that yoga powers have not been left behind in the modern world, but have mutated and evolved The standard evolutionary view does not recognize superhuman powers, but the movement that Kripal identifies as the evolutionary mysticism of the human potential movement accepts them This evolutionary mysticism regards them as signs of a probable

and also perhaps as signs of backwardness and fraud The superhuman powers do not have obvious links to any contemporary rational pursuits or academic knowledge tradition In the modern global success of yoga, the teaching of yogic powers is more or less absent, and this is probably a new development in yoga 38 In other traditions of yoga, yoga powers are seen as signs of success in yoga and proof of having reached advanced stages of practice some years ago, a Bengali friend who had for some years been a lay devotee in a contemporary yoga tradition in north India had decided that he was going to leave the movement The explanation he gave was that the gurus of this yoga lineage were against the display of yoga powers The reason for this, he said, was not because they did not favor them, but because they simply did not possess any yoga powers This lack of powers proved, in his view, that they also had no spiritual attainment The devotee told me that he had joined another movement whose leader, according to what he himself had witnessed, would not hesi-tate to display yoga powers such as floating in the air and mind read-ing In other words, according to him, it was lack of yoga powers that was associated with fraud and not anyone’s claim to possess them His action probably reflected the traditional attitude to the yoga powers superhuman powers constitute a large topic in the

air, entering another’s body, being in control of the elements of nature—in the Mahābhārata (MBh) such extraordinary activities are frequently regarded as ‘yogic powers’ which indicate suc-cessful yoga practice In the epic these powers are variously called bala (power, strength), aiśvarya (lordship, sovereignty), vibhūti (power, manifestation of power), vīrya (might), prabhāva (force) and, not infrequently, yoga 1 These powers are actually ascribed to different epic characters, such as sages, heroes, ascetics, yogins or gods and treated by the epic’s composers as ‘common knowledge’ on the part of the audience Yet, the epic also includes texts that deal with the inter-pretation of these powers in connection with expositions of yoga as a doctrine of liberation In this regard the epic is an important source in tracing the development of the conceptual framework used to explain the acquisition of such powers in post-epic philosophical and theo-logical treatises such as the Yogasūtra with Bhāṣya (4th-5th c ce) and the Pāśupatasūtra with the commentary of Kauṇḍinya (5th c ce) one of the concepts that seems to have fostered a philosophical treat-ment of yogic powers is the concept of prakṛti, the single cosmic cause of creation, launched by teachers of what came to be known as the philosophical school of sāṃkhya This concept allows the yogic path-1 The word siddhi (achievement, perfection), which in many modern texts and studies is the preferred term for these powers, seems not to be used in this sense in the epic texts discussed here The one possible exception could be 12 320 1, when Śuka is said to have turned to his ‘perfection’ or ‘achievement’, yet for specific pow-ers other words are used As the word siddhi refers in the epic to all kinds of achieve-ments and perfections, a clear terminological usage in the sense of ‘yoga power’ can only occasionally be detected However, a group of beings called siddhas is regularly listed together with other semi-divine or heavenly beings as residents of some higher cosmic realm At MBh 2 8 26 they are said to have yogic bodies (yogaśarīrin) some passages refer to those perfected in yoga (yogasiddha) without explicitly mentioning any specific powers, but obviously referring to very high levels of accomplishment which probably include yoga powers (1 60 26; 3 160 22; 9 44 8; 9 48 20; in 12 278 the

but also in later texts, does not indi-cate the persistence of certain remnants of ‘archaic magical thinking ́ or the dubious by-product of a primarily spiritual practice, as some scholars have noted 2 Rather, yogic powers are explained by drawing on the sāṃkhya notion of prakṛti, of the single cosmic cause of all creation, of ‘original nature’ as a self-active power, which came to be included not only in yoga texts, but also in many theological tradi-tions This will be put into more concrete terms here with regard to the narrative depiction of yogic powers in the story of Śuka other texts ascribe the acquisition of yogic powers a central role within a more doctrinal exposition of yoga as a liberating practice This is the case in chapters 12 289 and 12 228, which deal with yogic powers with and without drawing on sāṃkhya terminology I shall then turn to the Bhagavadgītā (BhG), which not only includes an explanation of why powerful yogins do not produce new karman, but also offers another important contemporary conceptualization of yogic powers, the concept of God as the highest yogin, as the ‘Mighty Lord of Yoga’ (ma hāyo geśvara) Śuka’s Yogic Might (MBh 12 309-320)While the

their actual use is strictly embedded in contexts that deal with either a state close to liberation or with the process of actually gaining liberation This matches the overall theme of the story, Śuka’s quest for liberation, that is, for reaching the place of non-return The story begins with an account of Śuka’s miraculous birth, which is brought about by the ascetic efforts (tapas) of vyāsa, which are eventually rewarded by the god Śiva vyāsa does not just want offspring, but a “son who consists of the power of fire, earth, water, wind and space” 4 When Rudra-Śiva grants this request, it is declared that the son will be as ‘pure’ (śuddha) as the five elements and that he will gain unique fame as he possesses fiery energy (tejas) that encompasses the three worlds (12 310 28-29) 5 soon Śuka is born from the sticks his father used to kindle the sacrifi-cial fire when a drop of his semen fell on them 6 The miraculous birth is corroborated by Śuka’s ‘fiery’ radiance and his being born a mighty yogin (mahāyogin; 12 311 9) This is especially true with regard to his mastery of the elements: not only does he emerge unharmed from the fire of the kindling sticks he is born from, but he is also capable of fly-ing through the air, demonstrating his mastery of space His father seems to take these in-born yogic powers of his son for granted When Śuka expresses his desire to learn more about liberation, vyāsa tells him to visit King Janaka in Mithilā for instruction and admonishes him as follows: “travel along as human beings do Being free from pride, you should not travel by means of your yogic force, by flying through the air ”7 This statement is part of an admonishment not to indulge in one’s capacities and in whatever pleasures one might encounter on the way Śuka is to present himself to Janaka as a well-4 agner bhūmer apāṃ vāyor antarikṣasya cābhibho / vīryeṇa saṃmitaḥ putro mama bhūyād iti sma ha //12 310 14/ 5 The significance of Śuka’s initimate connection to the elements and of his in-born supernatural powers is again pointed out at the very end of the story, when vyāsa, lamenting the loss of his son, is reminded by Śiva that he asked for a son whose might (vīrya) resembles that of the five elements In accordance with other epic passages, the five elements are regarded as creative powers This corresponds to a view of the elements in epic sāṃkhya as being prakṛtis, active and productive enti-ties; see, for instance, BhG 7 5ff; MBh 3 202 6 As in many other stories about ascetics seduced to procreation, vyāsa is aroused by an Apsara (divine

powers is not enough to qualify as a ‘true’ yogin and that these powers must not be used for indulging in pleasure and pride Rather, refraining from their employ-ment is here seen as a sign of yogic and ascetic qualification, a point which is made again at 12 312 12, when it is stressed that Śuka went to Mithilā on foot, even though he could have travelled through the air All this sets the stage for an elaborate depiction of Śuka’s yogic power at the very end of the story, which also places the use of such power in its appropriate, that is, salvific context After Śuka returns from Janaka and before he eventually turns to realize his ultimate goal, he spends some time with his father practising vedic recita-tion8 and is lectured by nārada on the misery of life (12 316-318 45) This lecture brings about the decision to search for the highest goal, the place of non-return, where his self (or he himself) will find rest 9 Śuka is convinced that only yoga will allow him to reach this place: nothing but yoga makes it possible to reach the highest goal, since obstruction through (ritual) activities is not suitable for a liberated man Therefore I shall give up this house, which is the body, by practis-ing yoga In becoming the wind, I will behold the sun with its rays of fire 10 It is not brahman, a god, or the highest self that is identified as the place of liberation from karman and as

the different types of wind circulating in the world that allow the different cosmic realms to be reached In the course of this dialogue, vyāsa praises his son for asking about the wind as being that element through which ‘everything is set in motion’ (vāyor sarvaṃ viceṣṭitam; 12 315 23) He tells Śuka that he possesses ‘divine sight’ (divya cakṣus; 12 315 28), and he is estab-lished in sattva as he got rid of rajas and tamas (ibid ) He asks his son to see himself by himself as he would look in a mirror and to study the veda on the one hand, this speech alludes to sāṃkhya-Yoga terminology and indicates that Śuka is well advanced on a path which is identified as yogic, but on the other hand, vyāsa recom-mends not seeking liberation, but contemplating the veda This advice suits vyāsa’s desire to keep his son with him Yet, the instruction about the courses of the wind provides an additional context for the depiction of Śuka as the ‘mighty Lord of Yoga’ after he became identical with the wind (vāyubhūta; 12 318 53) using or being the wind is seen as the means of travelling through space (not levitation) 9 tatra yāsyāmi yatrātmā śamaṃ me ‘dhigamiṣyati // 12 318 51/10 na tu yogam

Śuka’s final, north-bound yogic tour through the cosmos which takes him up to the highest Himalayan regions, where gods, accomplished sages and demigods reside When taking leave from them he gives

yoga as prescribed in the textbooks he had previously studied (cf 12 212 4) The actual concentration on the chosen object, the sun, is preceded by certain postures which he assumes according to a fixed sequence (krama) while sitting at a lonely place only then does he turn himself eastwards and sits in a position which is said to resemble that of a person disciplining himself, that is, with hands and feet put together The comparison of Śuka with some-one practicing self-discipline indicates that he is not exercising, but preparing to use a detachment and mastery he has already achieved This is corroborated in the next stanza, where Śuka is said to laugh when he beholds the sun, which indicates his being happy with his yogic success This is even more striking as he was previously sur-rounded by utter silence and emptiness Laughing is here not a sign of pride, but of the recognition that he has left all bondage behind and therefore is able to envision the sun, the desired goal He then contin-ues his yoga practice in order to advance on the path to liberation, which ends in the sun This continued practice results in his becoming a mahāyogīśvara, a ‘mighty lord among yogins’, a title which is put into more concrete terms in the rest of the narrative The word īśvara, which is used here for the yogin who has such power, can be taken as a designation for yogins who have reached this level of practice This is corroborated in other passages in the epic, when control over oneself and the elements of nature is depicted as a characteristic feature of īśvaras, be they humane or divine (see below) It should also be noted that the word used here for yogic power is yoga, the passage being one of several instances of the use of yoga in the sense of ‘extraordinary yoga

see also below) Within the context of yoga, this realm is the basis for set-ting out for final liberation, as well as the realm of full creative poten-tial It is the place in which all activities vanish, and conversely, by means of which all activity is possible In the story of Śuka, this realm is depicted as the point of departure for his final deed, gaining libera-tion by ‘breaking through’ the highest mountain range, which is depicted as the final border separating him from the place of non-return 15 At this point some of the attributes that go along with taking hold of brahman / prakṛti and being identical with the cause of all beings are ascribed to Śuka (12 320 23) He is omnipresent (sarva-gata), faces all directions (sarvatomukha) and is the All (sarvātman) Then, for the last time, he displays his yogic power while already being invisible: “Though invisible, Śuka displayed his yogic force Thereupon (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, forthcoming) Kṛṣṇa asks Arjuna to behold his yoga in BhG 11 (see below) 14 The specification aliṅga is ascribed to prakṛti in SK 10, while liṅga is the char-acteristic feature of the manifest world 15 Before entering this realm he uses for the last time the potential of his being firmly established in brahman by taking care of his father who had followed his son in order to hold him back on earth Śuka answers the searching calls of his father with the exclamation bhoḥ and this turns the story into a legend about the origin of echo, which also reflects that the word śuka means parrot, see Doniger “echoes of the Mahābhārata ”"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"angelika malinar40he abandoned the guṇas completely, such as sound and the rest, and went to the highest abode ”16 While it must be kept in mind that the topic of yogic powers in this story also functions as a narrative device, the narrative offers an inter-pretation of their role and appropriate use The story suggests that there is only one legitimate and necessary occasion for employing and displaying the powers of yoga, that is, as a means of actually gaining liberation These powers should only be used when a yogin who is in full control of himself and of the powers of creation sets out to leave the world forever The first time the yogic powers are used is also the last time The quality of a yogin’s conquest of these powers can be most convincingly demonstrated when the ‘conquered’ realms are given up and made the basis for reaching the highest realm The realm which promises the peace and the end of transmigration that Śuka longs for is the sun In order to reach it, he has to establish himself firmly in brahman, the realm of cosmic creativity This entails that he has become omnipresent and thus capable of commanding the pow-ers of creation In the story, this capacity of control is exemplified by Śuka becoming the wind and being able to move through space (ākāśa) Though in this text the term prakṛti is not used, the use of the terms brahman and guṇa or attributes like aliṅga suggests that the author is drawing on some cosmological framework that resembles sāṃkhya, yet without implementing sāṃkhya concepts of liberation and knowledge A more doctrinal, but again not necessarily sāṃkhyis-tic treatment of yogic powers is given in the texts dealt with in the next section 16 antarhitaḥ prabhāvaṃ tu darśayitvā śukas tadā / guṇān saṃtyajya śabdādīn padam adhyagamat param //12 320 26/ The word guṇa is obviously being used here in the sense of ‘qualities of the elements’ This use of the word guṇa reflects a form of epic sāṃkhya, in which the place of the tattvas (elements of being), which in the sK are called tanmātras (subtle elements), is taken by qualities ascribed to the great ele-ments (mahābhūta) In sāṃkhya texts of the epic, the five elements are regularly regarded as prakṛtis and thus as active (cf BhG 7 5) and not as vikāra, mere products of prakṛti, as in later sāṃkhya texts; see Angelika Malinar, “Completeness through Limitation: on the Classifcation of tattvas in sāṃkhya Philosophy,” Berliner Indo-logische Studien 16-18 (2003): 304-21) This also explains why the fact that Śuka is made up of the elements is apparently the reason for his in-born yogic powers over them (see also above)"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"yoga powers in the mahābhārata 41Power of Yoga (yogabala) in MBh 12 289In chapter 12 289, the ‘power of yoga’ (yogabala) is presented not only as a result of yoga, but also as a goal in its own right 17 The acquisition of power is regarded as a characteristic feature of Yoga, one that dis-tinguishes it from sāṃkhya philosophy Chapters 12 289-290 deal with the differences between Yoga and sāṃkhya, which are both pre-sented as philosophical or metaphysical doctrines (mata; 12 189 6-8) leading to the highest goal and thus as a ‘corpus of knowledge condu-cive for gaining liberation’ (mokṣadarśana, as sāṃkhya is called at 12 289 5) Although there are many similarities between the two in terms of moral conduct and practices of purification, ‘their doctrinal framework is not the same’ (darśanaṃ na samaṃ tayoḥ; 12 289 9) This difference is highlighted from the very beginning While follow-ers of sāṃkhya have recourse to transmitted knowledge (the doctrines of the teachers; śāstraviniścayāḥ 12 289 7), yogins prove their doctrine by taking perception as evidence (pratyakṣahetu; ibid ) The statement that yogins make their point by drawing on perception (pratyakṣa) as a means of proof firstly seems to imply that the truth and efficacy of the yoga doctrine is demonstrated through the extraordinary powers which yogins acquire in the course of their practice and which can be perceived by others secondly, this can also be taken to refer to the importance of the perceptions that yogins themselves make, such as viewing the residents of the different cosmic realms, what is called in other texts ‘yogic perception’ (yogapratyakṣa) 18 Whereas followers of sāṃkhya seek to gain insight into the single cause (of the cosmos) and become detached from sense-objects, yogins work on and use their 17 Yogabala can either be translated ‘power of a yogin’ (yoga is the word for yogin used frequently in this epic) or ‘power of yoga’ It seems that, in the majority of occurrences in this chapter, the latter translation is appropriate (cf 12 289 23, 24) Yogabala is also mentioned at BhG 8 10 to indicate a yogin’s strength to endure the onslaught of death At 12 274 31 Śiva, called the ‘Lord of all Lords of Yoga’ (sarvayogeśvareśvara), uses his yogabala in order to destroy the sacrifice of Dakṣa At 6 16 5 the bard saṃjaya refers to the ‘divine eye’ (divya cakṣus), which was given to him by vyāsa in order to witness all events during the battle, as his yogabala According to 9 43, Śiva’s son skanda-Kārttikeya is born equipped with ‘great yoga power’ (mahāyogabalānvita; 9 43 16, 33) In accordance with 12 228, the word is often used when yogins enter another’s body (cf 13 40-41; 15 33) It seems that bala, not aiśvarya or vibhūti, is the word used most frequently in the epic as a designation for ‘yoga power’ 18 see the essays in eli Franco, ed , Yogic Perception, Meditation and Altered States of Consciousness (Wien: verlag der Österreichischen Akademie der Wissen-schaften, 2009) "},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"angelika malinar42senses in order to gain control over them and their objects and be coming a powerful being This point is made in 12 289 3: “‘How can one who is not a powerful lord (anīśvara) gain liberation?’—in this way, o destroyer of enemies, yogins declare their pre-eminence with reasons ”19 According to this translation of the compound anīśvara, 20 yogins are requested to become īśvaras, ‘lords’, ‘powerful masters’, in order to gain liberation This interpretation connects this statement not only with the characterization of Śuka as ‘the mighty lord among yogins’ (12 319 6; see above), but also with the dominant theme of the chapter, the ‘power of yoga’ A more detailed presentation of the yogin as a powerful lord starts with the praise of bala, the strength and power a yogin must have in order to cut the nets the ‘weak’ (abala, balahīna) are caught in, like wild animals, fish or birds, Yogins, who are equipped with power (balān vitāḥ), cut off the ties that are produced by greed (lobhajāni bandhnāni;

he also has appropriate control over his liberation (from bondage)—there is no doubt about it 23 This passage equates the acquisition of yogic power with reaching a position in which a yogin may either turn to the realms of objects as he pleases or turn away from them forever He is at the same time master of all the ties that make up the ‘net’ of the world, and he is in control of his own liberation The yogin who is equipped with the ‘power of yoga’ is in control of all objects and is therefore, for instance, in a position to multiply himself, like a creator god, and move around on earth in different shapes and disguises This god-like position is emphasized at the very end of the chapter, when the yogin is equated with the creator god nārāyaṇa, the paradigm of commanding creative power, as he is capable of creating the whole cosmos (12 289 62) After a brief digression into the ‘subtle powers’ (sūkṣma bala), which a yogin gains through mental fixation (dhāraṇā;

12 289 57) This refers to the miraculous, paradoxical situation that the yogin is active and inactive at the same time, that he is liberated from physical existence, yet assumes all kinds of bodies The yogin who is great (mahān) and whose self is mighty (mahātman) alternately assumes the forms of the different gods and powers, yet he remains in his yoga posture In this regard he resembles the creator god: “While overpowering all mortal yogins, he whose self is mighty acts like the god nārāyaṇa ”25 In this chapter, the emphasis is on an idea of yoga which does not depict the acquisition of yogic powers as an obstacle to liberation, but as an integral dimension of the state of liberation: Yoga is a state of power which implies being free from death, birth, pain and pleasure Therefore, the yogin, ‘the mighty self ’, acts like the god nārāyaṇa The equation of the position of a cre-ator-god with the empowerment of a yogin points to a development that results in defining divinity in terms of yoga, which finds a para-digmatic formulation in the BhG (see below) In this chapter, yoga is deliberately presented without any terminological alignment with sāṃkhya classifications and enumerations one reason for this is that the topic of chapters 289-290 is the difference between yoga and sāṃkhya While it resembles in this regard the story of Śuka, it differs from the presentation of yoga powers in 12 228 and in the BhG 25 yogān sa sarvān abhibhūya martyān nārāyaṇātmā kurute mahātmā // 12 289 62 / The ‘mortal yogins’ (yogān martyān), are apparently yogins who gain this power either through other means or do not use it as part of their quest for libera-tion This is also indicated in the story of Śuka, when vyāsa is shown to be in com-mand of certain yoga powers (12 320 20) and is called a mahāyogin but cannot follow his son, who has become a mahāyogīśvara, a master amongst the great yogins, that is, a more powerful yogin one reason for this is that vyāsa’s power is flawed and thus weakened through his attachment to the world (this point has been made by Doniger, “echoes of the Mahābhārata”"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"yoga powers in the mahābhārata 45Yogic empowerment (yogaiśvarya) in MBh 12 228Chapter 12 228 depicts the acquisition of yoga power within the con-ceptual framework of sāṃkhya philosophy as a gradual mastery of the constituents of the cosmos, which ends in a position of empowerment and control over the unmanifest cause of creation (avyakta) The word used for this state is aiśvarya, which suggests its terminological use as attested in later systematized presentations in commentaries on YS and SK (for instance on SK 45) Furthermore, the occurrence of the compound yogaiśvarya at 12 228 37 points to an (incipient?) accep-tance of the word aiśvarya as a technical term for yogic power otherwise, in the epic it is primarily used for divine and royal power and sovereignty and seems to have been adopted by yoga teachers 26 In the epic the ascription of aiśvarya to yogins indicates a connection between yoga (as both a pathway of liberation as well as an instrument to gain extraordinary powers) and epic discourses on other wielders of power, such as gods and kings This is also an important context for the treatment of yogic and divine power in the BhG (see below) The practice of yoga described in 12 228 consists in a series of ‘fixa-tions’ (dhāraṇā) of the mind (manas), which is based on complete control of the senses, and of ‘speech’ (vāc) in particular This method is compared with driving a radiant, divine chariot (i e the yogin ́s body) that shines in the world of Brahmā (12 228 11) 27 In the course of the ‘chariot drive’, the yogin gradually gains power (aiśvarya;

therefore the balas or aiśvarya are an inevitable result of a successful yoga practice, regardless of whether they are used or not Conversely, divinity comes to be connected with yogic powers and with yoga as a state of agency without karmic repercussions The theology of the BhG demonstrates the advantages of defining divinity and cosmic sovereignty by drawing on concepts of yoga They serve to explain the paradox of a god who is active and inactive at the same time, who is born and yet unborn, who has an encompassing cosmic form that includes a multitude of bodies and yet is totally devoid of any corpore-ality Moreover, when held against concepts of karman, yoga power accounts for an agency and intervention in the realm of action that has no karmic repercussions for the agent Although a yogin should not indulge in displaying these powers, he must be capable of them if he claims to be a successful practitioner His being free from bondage, from birth and death, as 12 289 56 would have it, is proved in his capacity to be active (BhG 5) and even productive (12 228, 12 289) without ‘doing’ anything Yoga as a pathway to liberation thus seems necessarily to include empowerment as a state of yogic practice According to some epic texts, it is a state that is instrumental not obtrusive for gaining liberation Therefore it seems significant that, in several instances in the epic, the word used for yogic powers and devices is simply yoga 56 All this may help explain why the powers of yoga are regarded as an integral part of yoga not only by the compos-56 This is accordance with the general ambiguity of the meaning of yoga as an instrument and method on the one hand, and as a state of yogic achievement on the other For a study of this ambiguity in the BhG, see Malinar (forthcoming b)"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"yoga powers in the mahābhārata 59ers of the epic, but also by those handing down the tradition and treat-ing it philosophically, even though they might take sides with those who regard yogic empowerment as an impediment to reaching still higher levels of existence ReferencesBedekar, v M “The story of Śuka in the Mahābhārata and the Purāṇas ” Purāṇa 7 (1965): 87-127 Brown, C Mackenzie “Modes of Perfected Living in the Mahābhārata and the Purāṇas: The Different Faces of Śuka the Renouncer ” In Living liberation in Hindu thought, edited by Andrew o Fort and Patricia Y Mumme, 157-83 Albany: state university of new York Press, 1996 Deussen, Paul / strauss, otto Vier philosophische Texte aus dem Mahābhārata Leipzig: Harrassowitz, 1906 Doniger, Wendy “echoes of the Mahābhārata: Why is a Parrot the narrator of the Bhāgavata Purāṇa and the Devībhāgavata Purāṇa?” In Purāṇa Perennis: Reciprocity and Transformation in Hindu and Jaina texts, edited by Wendy Doniger 31-58 Albany: state university of new York Press, 1993 edgerton, Franklin The Beginnings of Indian Philosophy Cambridge Mass : Harvard university Press, 1965 eliade, Mircea Yoga: Unsterblichkeit und Freiheit Frankfurt: suhrkamp, 1985 Fitzgerald, James L “The sāṃkhya-Yoga ‘Manifesto’ at MBh 289-290 ” In Battles, Bards, Brahmans.

In fact, the earliest narratives in the entire Hindu (and, I believe Buddhist and Jain) canon to describe the behaviors of people called yogis are found in the epic’s twelfth and thirteenth books In these, figures called yogis or practitioners of yoga (sulabhā, vidura, vipula, Kāvya uśanas, and Bharadvāja) are portrayed as practicing yoga, precisely, when they enter into the bodies of other creatures As with Kṛṣṇa’s yoga in the Bhagavadgītā, none of them are described as sitting in fixed postures, regulating their breaths, or meditating Mahābhārata 12 289 provides a textual window onto the theory behind this, the earliest documented practice of yoga by yogis:Yogis who are without restraints [and] endowed with the power of yoga (yogabalānvitāḥ) are [so many] masters (īśvarāḥ), who enter into [the bodies of] the Prajāpatis, the sages, the gods, and the great beings Yama, the raging terminator (Antaka), and death of terrible prowess: none of these masters (īśate) the yogi who is possessed of immeasurable splendor ...

Kaṇāda answers this question by stating that the “perception of the self [results] from a special conjunction, within the self, between self and mind,” expanding on this theme by referring to perception “into other substances” by two types of persons: “those whose consciousness (antaḥkaraṇa) is not composed (samāhita)” and “those whose com-position is complete ”37 In other words, unlike normal perception, which is the result of a fourfold contact (catuṣṭaya-sannikarṣa)—between the self, the mind, a sense organ (in the form of a ray), and an object38—the perception of imperceptibles occurs through a ‘special’ (viśeṣa) and direct conjunction (saṃyoga) between a mind and its object In his commentary on these aphorisms, Praśastapāda explains what it is that makes this contact special, and by way of interpreting the two types of persons alluded to in the Vaiśeṣikasūtra aphorism, he intro-duces the concept of an enhanced level of perception on the part of yogis, realized through yoga-generated practice (yogaja-dharma), by means of which one gains a perception of the true forms (svarūpa) of their own selves as well as a pan-optical vision of the selves of others, the quarters of space, time, atoms, wind, and mind What is it in normal perception that comes to be rectified or enhanced by this practice?

Indeed, Buddhist tradition in general and Theravāda Buddhism in particular would come to make a distinction, regarding the first five abhiññās as ‘mundane’ (lokiya), as opposed to the added sixth abhiññā, which is said to be ‘supermundane’ (lokuttara) Because, however, the first five abhiññās involve not only certain kinds of gno-"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"bradley s clough78sis but

five higher knowledges as yogic powers will not concentrate on the earliest extant materials referred to above, as I have discussed the treatment of the abhiññās in these texts elsewhere 1 Rather, we will explore the expositions on these powers in a more fully formed Theravāda tradi-tion, as shown specifically in its manuals on the path (magga), which still represent relatively early formative phases of this school of Buddhism These texts are: 1) the Paṭisambhidāmagga (Psm) or ‘Path of Discrimination,’ (authorship is uncertain, although Theravāda tra-dition assigns the work to sāriputta) which probably dates to roughly the second century bce ;2 2) the Vimuttimagga (Vmm) or ‘Path of Liberation’ of upatissa Thera,3 which was probably composed around the first century ce ;4 and most importantly, the Visuddhimagga (Vsm) or ‘Path of Purification’ of Buddhaghosa, which was written in the fifth century ce 5 I will rely mostly on this last text, which provides a very detailed treatment of the higher knowledges that ranges over two chapters in its section on samādhi, clearly indicating the importance of the abhiññās in this most thorough of treatments of Theravāda soteriology What makes these texts especially worthy of discussion is that they are the sole early Theravāda texts that contain something like actual instructions on how to obtain these yogic powers

important and notable exception here), as the conferring of such knowledge has usually been an esoteric matter between an accomplished teachers and initiated and advanced disci-ples Theravādin meditation masters also undoubtedly have passed on such instruction orally over the course of history, but these texts pro-vide us with a fairly rare glimpse into an aspect of yogic powers that has been little investigated and understood Furthermore, these path manuals’ discussions of the abhiññās reveal more to us about general Buddhist and particular Theravādin convictions about the leading role that cultivation of the mind plays in practice,6 the great opportu-nities that meditation provides for mental and physical transfor-mation (in the cases investigated here, meditation as it pertains to samatha-bhāvanā [‘cultivation of tranquility] and its attendant jhāna states), the exceptionally powerful abilities attributed to one who has well cultivated the mind, and the centrality assigned to intention or resolve in the area of action or praxis Iddhi-vidhā-ñān.a The Vsm defines iddhi in terms of production (nipphatti), obtainment (patilābha), and effectiveness of means (upāya-kosalla), the last phrase indicating a conviction that production of certain desired results could be obtained by means of the iddhi powers 7 The Vsm’s discus-sion of iddhi is thus primarily concerned with generating success and efficacy in the meditative process of samatha-bhāvanā, but Buddha-ghosa also uses the term to refer to other kinds of iddhi, in the sense of ‘attainment’ or ‘success ’ overall, ten kinds of iddhi are discussed in the path texts, but only three pertain to the abhiññā known as ‘knowl-edge of the varieties of iddhi,’ with our texts significantly only giving specific instructions about how to cultivate these three The Psm lists them as: 1) adhiṭṭhāna iddhi: success by resolve It is asserted that by mental resolution, one actually can produce phenomena outside of 6 one is reminded of the phrase found in both of the Dhammapada’s (hereafter Dhp) first two verses: “[All] states are preceded by mind, for them mind is foremost, [and] from mind they are made” (manopubbaṅgama dhammā/manoseṭṭhā mano-mayā) 7 Vsm 12 22"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"bradley s clough80one’s body This includes all the standard iddhis mentioned above (which are taken from stock nikāyan passages on the iddhis); 2) vikubbanā iddhi: success by transformation This is the abandoning or alteration of one’s normal form; and 3) manomaya iddhi: success by creating out of one’s own body another body that is ‘mind-made’ and possesses all faculties except the life or sexual faculty 8Already we find here an emphasis on the power of mental resolve (in the case of adhiṭṭhāna iddhi), extraordinary transformative ability associated with a meditatively cultivated mind (in the case of vikubbanā iddhi), and things becoming manifest by means of mind (as in the case of manomaya iddhi; like Dhp 1: 1-2, things are ‘made of mind’) In general, the path leading to the attainment of iddhi and the other abhiññās involves five steps The first step is developing the four jhānas The first three jhānas are regarded as necessary accessory planes, since in them one becomes “light, malleable, and wieldy in body after steeping oneself in blissful perception and light perception due to pervasion of bliss ”9 Here again we see an emphasis on bodily transformation through mediation as well as a usefulness assigned to bliss that is typically associated with vajrayāna Buddhism and deemed antithetical to Theravāda Buddhism But the importance of bliss is undeniable here in this Theravāda context Returning to the Vsm, it repeats the long-held conviction that the fourth jhāna is the natural plane for obtaining the five abhiññās The second step is cultivation of the four iddhi-pādas, the ‘bases for success,’ which are: 1) concentra-tion (samādhi) due to will (chanda); 2) concentration due to energy (viriya); 3) concentration due to mind (citta); and 4) concentration due to investigation (vīmaṃsā) two things are noteworthy here First, as we see here again and will see throughout our examination, intention, resolve, or will occupies a central place in developing an abhiññā second, there is an association with mental activity (citta or ‘thought’ and vīmaṃsā or ‘investigation’) with development of samādhi or ‘meditative concentration’ that contradicts the usual under standing that samādhi involves cessation of mental activity and thus stands in stark contrast to vipassanā-bhāvanā or ‘insight medita-tion,’ which is said to be distinct from samādhi-based meditation in its investigation of thoughts and other personal processes Returning to 8

steps,’ which appears to be nothing more than a reworking of the iddhi-pāda formula 10 The fourth step is the ‘sixteen roots,’ which are the sixteen unwholesome states of mind by which a mind must remain unperturbed (āneñja) 11 The fifth step is called ‘resolving with knowledge’ 12 What this entails is that once the previous four meditative conditions have been accomplished, any iddhi or other abhiññā can be gained simply by determining to acquire it in one’s mind In addition to these five steps, the Vsm includes instructions for another required exercise that gives one a good sense of the exceed-ingly high level of mastery believed to be involved in cultivating the abhiññās This exercise is comprised of perfecting the attaining of the jhānas via each of the ten kasiṇas in fourteen different ways (literally ‘fields for cultivation,’ the kasiṇas are physical objects used as medita-tive devices to attain the jhānas, such as colored discs and containers of an element such as earth or water) These fourteen ways include attaining each of the jhānas via each of the kasiṇas one-thousand times in forward and reverse order Here, one would attain the first jhāna up through the fourth formless attainment (arūpāyatana)13, and descend in reverse order, doing this again and again, with the ability to skip over both jhānas and kasiṇas (e g going from the first jhāna gained by concentrating on the earth kasiṇa, directly to the third jhāna by concentrating on the fire kasiṇa, and then directly to the ‘boundless space attainment’ by conjuring up and then removing the blue kasiṇa and just focusing on the empty space that remains) 14 The Vsm states that only one person in a thousand can arouse the meditative signs necessary for such achievement Among those rare few, only one in a thousand can extend any of the signs and reach absorption (appanā) in jhāna Among those very few who can do that, 10 Vsm 12 54 11 Vsm 12 55 12 Vsm 12 59 13 I n Theravāda mediation theory,

(arūpa-dhātu) are called āyatanas (‘spheres’ or ‘attainments’) namely, they are: 1) ‘sphere of boundless space’ (ākāsānañcāyatana); 2) ‘sphere of boundless consciousness’ (viññāṇañcā-yatana); 3) ‘sphere of nothingness’ (ākiñcaññāyatana); and 4) ‘ sphere of neither perception nor non-perception’ (nevasaññā-nāsaññāyatana) 14 Vsm 12 3-5"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"bradley s clough82only one in a thousand can control the mind in the fourteen ways And, among those extremely rare few, only one in a thousand can transform oneself by the five abhiññās only buddhas, pacceka-bud-dhas, and chief disciples (aggasāvakas), due to the power of their past meditative endeavors and great will, can achieve the abhiññās simply by attaining arahant-hood Here again, we find an importance assigned to samatha-bhāvanā that is usually thought to be the prov-ince of vipassanā-bhāvanā, with the arahant being very notably defined in this context as one who can master the kasiṇas up to the fourth jhāna, without preliminary training in the fourteen ways This is quite distinct from usual definitions, which refer mostly or solely to an adept’s gnostic achievements (such as ‘knowledge of the destruc-tion of the defilements’) gained from mindfulness (sati) or insight meditation 15The Psm and Vmm provide the basic instructions for developing the basis for the abhiññās in general and the first kind of iddhi, ‘suc-cess by resolve’ (adhiṭṭhāna iddhi) in the fourth jhāna This is done by first developing the aforementioned iddhi-pādas of concentration (samādhi) due to will, energy, mind, and investigation (chanda, viriya, citta, and vīmaṁsā), accompanied by what is called ‘volitional activity of endeavor’ (padhāna-cetanā-sankhāra) 16 Again, it seems that once a very advanced degree of concentration has been reached, in order to realize a supernormal power, it appears that it is simply a matter of mentally willing that power to arise Although the mind can slacken, fall back, and become agitated at times, these problems can be removed by producing the purity, equanimity, and one-pointedness of mind that is characteristic of the fourth jhāna eventually, repeated practice of the iddhi-pādas leads to a strength of resolve and also, quite nota-bly, a supple (mudu) and malleable (kammanīya) mind, which are said to be necessary to develop the iddhis and other abhiññās The references here to suppleness and malleability of course speak to Buddhist convictions about the mind’s remarkable transformability and power next, the adept mounts, converts, and steadies his mind to accord with the body, and vice-versa, in order to permeate the body with the bliss (sukhatā) and lightness (lahutā) required to develop iddhi and the other abhiññās With the mind and body thus prepared, one enters the fourth jhāna via any of the kasiṇas emerging from the 15 Vsm 12 8 16 Psm 2 209-210; Vmm Chapter 9, p 217"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"cultivation of yogic powers in the pāli path manuals 83fourth jhāna, one is said to actually know space, earth, or whatever the meditative object is, and thus can resolve to obtain any of the iddhis or abhiññās through that knowledge 17 once again, we find here the power of resolve in a meditatively cultivated mind being reinforced, as well as an important association being made between gnosis and cul-tivation of the jhāna states This also is clearly a case that demonstrates a conviction that one finds throughout south Asian yogic literature, and that is that to know something is to gain actual mastery over that thing, in this case including the actual ability to create that thing The three texts all include special instructions for developing the second and third kinds of iddhi, those resulting from physical trans-formation (vikubbanā) of some kind and the use of the mind-made body (manomayakāya) For the former (the second kind of iddhi), one again abides in the fourth jhāna and practices the four iddhi-pādas until bliss and lightness of body and suppleness and malleabil-ity of mind are reached one then resolves to fill the body with mind Discarding the form, one enters the fourth jhāna again, and emerges, resolving, “May I take the form of such and such ”18 Thus, the iddhi of transformation only differs from the iddhi of resolve in its discarding of form For attaining the mind-made body (the third kind of iddhi), one follows the same process, except that, in this case, one resolves, “I will change this hollow body of mine ” Then one resolves, “let there be another body inside it ” Then one draws that other body out, “like a rod from its sheath, a sword from its scabbard, a snake from its skin ”19 By this means, one can, as one wishes, create visible forms which are, as stated above, complete with all the faculties, except for the life or procreative faculty 20 These forms will do whatever the possessor of iddhi (iddhivat) does—sit, walk, talk, and so forth 21Here again we find much evidence of the tremendous power assigned to mental resolve or intention It seems that just as the inten-tion behind an action (kamma) has the great power to produce future fruits (phala) or results (vipāka), the resolve applied in the fourth jhāna, once a certain high degree of mastery over mind and matter 17 Vsm 12 6 18 Vsm 12 138; Vmm Chapter 9, p 217; Psm 2 210 19 Psm 2 210; Vsm 12

has the power to effect great mental and physical transformation The Vsm goes on to treat, in individual fashion, each of the eight iddhis mentioned in the nikāyas’ locus classicus on the abhiññās, the Sāmaññaphala-sutta First is the ability to multiply (“Having become one, he becomes many...”22) taking the number of forms that one wishes to produce as the object of concentration, one enters the fourth jhāna, emerges, and resolves, “Let me become a hundred,” for exam-ple The Vsm adds that not only can the forms do what the iddhivat does, but each form can do different things, by merely resolving, for example, “Let so many bhikkhus appear young, let so many bhikkhus appear teaching Dhamma...”, etc , while attaining jhāna and emerg-ing after each resolution to become one again, the practitioner once again attains jhāna, emerges, and resolves, “Let me become one ” or, one can set a predetermined time beforehand, at which multiple bod-ies will integrate into one (...“having been many, he becomes one”23) 24 The second iddhi is “becoming visible or invisible at will (‘He appears and disappears...’25) ” Here, in order to cause invisibility, one turns light into darkness, hides what is revealed, or makes something leave the visual field to make something visible, the opposite is done This is accomplished by resolving, “Let that which is light become dark,” or vice-versa The power of making things visible is said to dis-play both the iddhi and the iddhivat, whereas the power of making things invisible only displays the iddhi 26The third iddhi is the ability to pass through solid obstacles (“He goes unhindered through walls, ramparts, and mountains, as if through space...”27) to accomplish this, one attains the fourth jhāna via the space kasiṇa, emerges and resolves with respect to the obstacle, ‘Let there be space,’ whereupon the obstacle becomes hollow, if one wishes to rise up through it, or cleft, if one wants to penetrate it Here Buddhaghosa cites the objection of an elder named Culla Abhaya, who had insisted that any kasiṇa would do, since “one does not have to use an elephant kasiṇa to create an elephant ” His fellow monks disagree, noting that the Psm (2 208) says to use the space kasiṇa only 22 D i 78 23 D i 78 24 Vsm 12 68 25 D i 78 26 Psm 2 207; Vs 12 69 27 D i 78"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"cultivation of yogic powers in the pāli path manuals 85Buddhaghosa also mentions that the resolution, ‘let there be space,’ covers all obstacles to be encountered, unless the obstacle has been created by another iddhivat, in which case it must be avoided 28Likewise, the fourth iddhi, the ability to dive “...in and out of the ground as if on water,”29 is accomplished by attaining jhāna via the water kasiṇa and resolving that the earth become water in a certain place This place will then become water (or any other liquid) for the iddhivat only, who can also determine whether or not the liquid makes him wet or not 30similarly, for the fifth iddhi of walking ‘“...on water without sink-ing, as if it were earth,”31 one attains jhāna via the earth kasiṇa and resolves that the water become earth, or any other solid substance he desires Again, the water becomes earth only for the iddhivat 32For the sixth iddhi (“...seated cross-legged, he travels across the sky like a winged bird”33), a slightly different method is employed, for here one uses again the aforementioned ‘mind-made body ’ The Vsm instructs that one attain jhāna either by the air kasiṇa, which enables one to rise like a tuft of cotton, or by a method called ‘movement of mind,’ which has the same effect 34 Based on the Psm as it very often is, the Vsm prescribes the earth kasiṇa for this ‘movement of mind’ method, by which one travels through the sky as if seated on a piece of ground The Vsm also says that divine eye is necessary for this power, so that one can spot a secluded place to land, out of sight of the multi-tudes 35 In the Vmm, a question is raised concerning whether or not one falls to earth if the jhāna is lost The reply is that one does not fall, but instead returns to the meditative seat 36 This raises the important question of whether mere ideation or mental projection of the body (as the phrase ‘movement of mind’ might suggest) is implied here This may be the case, but one must recall, that the ‘mind-made body’ is said to have special qualities of extreme lightness (see the previous references to bodily lightness [lahutā] in the jhānas and to the body rising like a tuft of cotton), and so it could remain aloft as long as the 28 Vsm 12 90 29 D i 78 30 Vsm 12 92-94 31 D i 78 32 Vsm 12 95-96 33 D i 78 34 Vmm 9 216 35 Vsm 12 100 36 Vmm 9 216"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"bradley s clough86iddhivat willed it to do so Furthermore, one must also bear in mind that the mind in Buddhism is the sixth sense, and as such, it is not dif-ferent from other senses Therefore, such ‘ideations’ are no less ‘real’ than other sensory experiences 37The seventh iddhi is the ability to touch and feel “...the sun and moon” 38 This is done, once again, by the procedure of entering jhāna and making a resolution, in this case “Let it be within reach ” Then, just as one normally touches objects within reach, so one possessing mental mastery can do the same with these celestial bodies 39The eighth power is wielding “bodily mastery as far as the Brahmā realms ”40 This feat is quite conceivable in terms of Buddhist cosmo-logical beliefs, which maintain that the divine Brahmā worlds are on equivalent levels with the jhāna states in the realm of form This power also requires use of the abhiññās of divine eye and divine ear, which are said to allow one to see the forms and hear the sounds of any of the Brahmā worlds, and furthermore the abhiññā of reading others’ minds is necessary in order to understand deities in these spheres If the iddhivat wants to travel to such a world in a visible form, he resolves to convert his mind to accord with his body If he wants to travel invisibly, he resolves to convert his body to accord with his mind (this, once again, would be the ‘mind-made body’) In either case, he arrives at cognition of bliss and lightness (sukha- and lahu-saññā) Then, one can travel to a Brahmā world by resolving by the earth kasiṇa if one wants to walk, by the air kasiṇa if one wishes to fly, or by the resolution ‘Let it be near’ 41 With regard to this power, the question arises again concerning whether the iddhivat or a purely mental image of a body is the one to go, and there seem to be differing positions here Clearly this question was of considerable concern to the tradition Buddhaghosa says “He does as he pleases,” which seems to leave the issue unresolved, but he also points out that the Psm says that it is the actual creator of the body, not a merely created body, that goes 42 But one account from the Milindapañha seems to imply that one travels via a mental creation Here, King Milinda expresses doubt 37 Rune Johansson, The Psychology of Nirvana (London: George Allen and unwin, 1969), 48 38 D i 78 39 Vsm 12 103 40 D i 78 41 Vsm 12 19 42 Buddhaghosa, at Vsm 12 119, seems

monarch to recall his birthplace and upon hearing the reply, remarks, “o King, you have gone to Alexandria very quickly!”43 However, another Milindapañha passage suggests the opposite Here, nāgasena says that just as a normal person resolves to jump and the body becomes buoyant, in the same way an iddhivat, focuses the body in the mind and travels through the air 44 Again we might note here yet another example of the conviction about the ability of mental resolution to create extraordinary power, if one has achieved the bodily bliss and lightness and the mental supple-ness and malleability of the fourth jhāna DibbasotadhātuAccording to the Vsm, one begins to obtain the abhiññā of ‘divine ear element’ by first adverting attention to gross sound-signs within the range of normal hearing, and then successively adverting attention to more and more subtle sound signs in each of the ten directions By doing this, the normal mind (pakati-citta) identifies with the bhavaṅga or ‘life-condition,’ which is the mental factor that allows for personal continuity, according to Theravāda philosophy 45 In this state, one resolves, ‘divine ear element will now arise ’ taking any sound as its object, another yogic power called ‘mind-door adverting’ (mano-dvāra-ajjanam) arises In simple terms, this means giving concen-trated mental attention to a given sound After that has ceased, five thought-moments (javanāḥ) arise in succession The first four—pre-liminary work (parikamma), access ([to jhāna] upacāra), adaptation (anuloma) and adoption (gotrabhū, literally ‘family member’)—are of the desire realm, while the fifth is the mind of absorption (appanācitta) in the fourth jhāna, which is of the realm of form 46 During this last 43 Milindapañha 3 16 44 Milindapañha 4

first in the Milindapañha (1st century ce), and is devel-oped further in the Vsm and other commentarial literature (5th century ce and beyond), as well as in later Abhidhamma digests such as the Abhidhammasaṃgaha (12th century ce) 46 The thought-moments are a series within the process of mental purification that are free from interference from distractions stemming from the activity of the

combination of the arising of this knowledge with the mind of absorp-tion, which is completely fixed on the sound object, produces divine ear element The rather technical and complex process just described can be rather hard to follow, but the basic idea seems to be that the sound-object upon which one is concentrating becomes increasingly evident as the mental ascent is made up to the fourth jhāna The Vsm states that once one has gained this abhiññā, any sound that comes into the range covered by object as perceived in jhāna can be heard without reentering the fourth jhāna If one wishes, one can extend this knowl-edge as far as a single entire world-sphere (presumably one divine realm above the one that is on the same level as the fourth jhāna, which would be the ‘sphere of boundless space’), and one can identify and distinguish each particular sound within that range 47 Cetopariyañān.a (Knowledge of the nature of Mind) or Paracittañān.a (Knowledge of others’ thoughts)Here again we see importance placed on combining certain abhiñ ñās to obtain a yogic power According to the Vsm, one must first attain divine eye, as preliminary work (parikamma), in order to gain this higher knowledge The one should enter the fourth jhāna by the light kasiṇa Increasing the light, one should radiate the light so as to pen-etrate (pariyesitabba) another’s state of mind by observing, with divine eye, the color of blood present in the physical heart (hadaya-rūpa) The blood is said to be red when the mind is accompanied by joy (sukha); it is black with grief (dukkha) and also with ignorance (avijjā); it is yellow with lust (rāga); and it is clear with equanimity (upekkhā) By constant repetition of this preliminary practice, one can come to know with one’s own mind the faculties of all kinds of minds within the three realms, without further observation of the heart’s matter (vinā pi hadayarūpadassana) As described by Buddhaghosa, this abhiññā is hierarchical For instance a stream-enterer (sotāpanna) can only know the mind of an ordinary person (puthujjana), but not that of a once-returner the process of attaining stream-entry, culminating in knowledge of the (stream enterer’s) path and knowledge of the fruit of that path In samatha meditation, the first four culminate in the ‘mind of absorption’ (in the jhānas) mentioned here 47 Vsm 13

topics that one usually finds elsewhere, most especially in the Abhi dhamma material The Vsm says that six types of people recollect past lives,50 to vary-ing degrees, based on their degree of insight into the nature of mind and body (nāma-rūpa, ‘name and form’) and their components (khandha),51 which is a very important criterion for Buddhists, in determining the extent of one’s knowledge non-Buddhist sectarians (titthiya) can recall only the succession of components, not the means of death and rebirth-linking (paṭisandhi),52 and thus can remember back (a mere!) forty eons at the most, and cannot descend upon any particular point in the past as they so choose But ordinary (Buddhist) disciples (pakati-sāvaka) can and the eighty great disciples (mahāsā-vakas) of the past could remember both the succession of aggregates and the means of death and rebirth-linking, and could recall up to 100,000 eons of past lives and two incalculable eons plus 100,000 eons, respectively Buddhists remember past lives neither by tracing the 48 With respect to stages of spiritual progress, Theravāda has a hierarchy of types of practitioners, ranging from the ‘non-trainee’ (asekha) or ‘ignoble person’ (anariya-puggala), who is an ordinary person (puthujjana) yet to engage in any prac-tice, to the four levels of advanced ‘trainee’ (sekha) or ‘noble person,’ which indicate how close one is to nibbāna, depending on what liberating insights one has attained and what attachments one has given up They are: 1) the ‘stream-enterer’ (sotāpanna), destined for nibbāna within seven lifetimes; 2) the ‘once-returner’ (sakadāgāmi), destined for nibbāna within one rebirth; 3) the ‘non-returner’ (anāgāmi), destined for nibbāna in this lifetime or during the next rebirth in a divine realm; and 4) the ‘worthy one’ (arahant), one who has attained nibbāna With respect to knowing another’s mind, what is being said here is that one can only pos-sibly know the mind of one on an equal

choose 53The beginner starts by successively recalling each of his bodily, mental, and verbal acts for an entire day While these acts are evident enough to the normal mind (pakati-citta), they are even more evident to what is called the ‘preliminary work mind’ (parikamma-citta) that arises for one immersed in the fourth jhāna, for whom these events are illuminated as if a lamp light had been shed on them By attaining the fourth jhāna, emerging, and adverting (āvajjita) the mind, one can tap progressively into the one’s entire present life, eventually con-centrating upon key moments in the whole process of past lives, such as that of one’s own rebirth-link (paṭisandhi) in this existence, and the state of one’s mental and bodily components at the moment of death in the immediately previous life 54 This ability to direct the mind to whatever particular moment one seeks to recall provides even further testimony to the great power of mind as it is understood in Theravāda Buddhism, especially the mind’s power to bring about great insight while immersed or immediately after being immersed in the fourth jhāna nevertheless, a distinction is still made between samatha- and vipas sanā-bhāvanā: Whereas a meditator (Buddhaghosa explicitly says a ‘monk’) with paññā is able to recall these crucial events in one attempt, those of less insight should enter jhāna and advert the mind again and again in order to clear the mind, like a person who, by resharpening his axe, gets closer and closer to chopping down the tree 55 once memory of these key moments is achieved, the process described previously, of the successive arising of ‘mind-door advert-ing’ and the five thought-moments, occurs, culminating in the arising of absorption consciousness, which produces awareness of past lives 56 And not only is one said to be able to remember one’s long chain of rebirths, but can also recall eons of cosmological contraction and expansion, described in some detail by

knowledge is called ‘divine’ because 1) it is possessed by the gods (who obtain it due to past good kamma; 2) because it achieved by the power of divine abiding (dibba-vihārāvasena); 3) it has divine abiding as its support; and 4) it greatly illuminates with discerning light (ālokapariggahena mahāgga hena) 58 Because it discerns the arising and passing away of beings, it is called ‘pure,’ in that it is the cause of purification of view (diṭṭhivisuddhi-hetu) Those who only see passing away but not rebirth assume the annihilationist (wrong) view (ucchedadiṭṭhi), and those who only see passing away but not rebirth succumb to the (wrong) view that only new being appears (navasattapātubhāvadiṭṭhi), which presumably is synonymous with the (wrong) view of eternalism (sassatadiṭṭhi) only children of Buddha see both, and that vision is the cause for purifica-tion of view, which is the crucial ‘middle way’ understanding that all things both arise and pass away 59 In discussing divine eye in this way, Buddhaghosa sheds light on a central soteriological role played by divine eye that is not so explicitly laid out in earlier Theravāda works And again, we see that an insight that Buddhism deems crucial to ulti-mate liberation being gained through an abhiññā realized while prac-ticing samatha-bhāvanā The knowledge that “whatever is subject to arising is subject to passing away” is the insight that gives one what is called the ‘dharma eye,’ which is the mark of one who has attained stream-entry Divine eye is said to ‘surpass the human,’ both in the sense that it goes beyond the human physical eye (mānusakam maṃsacakkhum)—meaning it can see further distances in this world—and that it can see objects beyond the range of human access—meaning that it can see divine realms 60Divine eye is manifested in certain beings simply because of excel-lent past kamma, but most must begin by attaining the level of access to the first jhāna (upacārajjhānagocara) via either the fire, white, or light kasiṇa, the latter being preferable because divine eye is said to be 58 Here dibba seems to have been taken in its most literal sense, of ‘shining’ or ‘illuminating ’59 Vsm 13 74 60

absorp-tion, the kasiṇa is the object, instead of the external objects or beings that one wishes to perceive second, absorption is the support for the basic jhāna, but not for the preliminary work that needs to be done, which is extending the light kasiṇa in order to see external things one can see as far as the light can be extended, and since access-concentra-tion is of short duration, it is preferable because the adept will need to enter this level of jhāna again and again, each time emerging and per-vading the directions with light Through entering into access-con-centration repeatedly with this kasiṇa, eventually one is able to extend light to any predetermined limit desired 62 once this is achieved, the same process ensues: the ‘mind-door’ is adverted and the five thought-moments

Buddhaghosa (probably drawing from Ps 19 36) says that only Buddhas fully know the future, for only they can take all the possible conditions into account 68 Conclusionsour examination of Theravāda path manuals’ discussions of the abhiññās has given us insight into several dimensions of this tradi-tion’s thought and practice First, despite the very long-held beliefs, usually evidenced in narrative accounts, of the power of advanced adepts to display extraordinary powers, it is extremely rare within the enormous literatures of various forms of Jainism, Buddhism, and Hinduism (not to mention major non-Indic-based religions) to find some explicit details about how spiritual masters were thought to actually manifest such supernormal abilities even in traditions of tantra that supposedly emphasize and celebrate such powers more than other Indic traditions, it is quite unusual to find much in the way of actual instructions on the accomplishment of supermundane acts For example, a recent translation of the tibetan master Dzong-ka-ba’s treatment of Yoga Tantra from his famous text, The Great Exposition of Secret Mantra, tantalizingly subtitled by the translators as Pathways to Magical Feats, only ten of the translated text’s fifty pages contain anything approaching actual instructions, and given that fourteen dif-ferent kinds of powers are discussed in these pages, the exposition of the visualizations and mantras involved are fairly cursory.69of equal importance is what these instructions tell us about Thera-vāda Buddhism’s views on the nature and power of mind Most important in this respect is crediting samatha-bhāvanā practice with the yielding of a suppleness and malleability of mind that enables one to perform extraordinary psychic and physical feats Furthermore, the path works analyzed here provide greater confirmation that a central part of what could be called the ‘common Indic yogic heritage’ is the conviction that to know something is gain control over it Apparently cultivation of the jhānas are believed to confer knowledge and control over the meditative object used to gain these states of meditative absorption such that, for example, concentration on the kasiṇa of 68 Vsm 13 80, 125 2469 H H the Dalai Lama, Dzong-ka-ba, and Jeffrey Hopkins, Yoga Tantra: Paths to Magical Feats (Ithaca: snow Lion Publications,

addition, it appears that as one mentally ascends through the levels of jhāna that are associated with different sphere in ‘realm of form’ (rūpāyatana), mind gains control over matter, such that one can, for example, create bodies with one’s mind (manomaya-kāya) This does not mean, however, that the physical is always seen as something to be transcended, as is often thought to be a belief of Theravāda Buddhism Besides the utility of a mind-made body, we find a great value placed in these works on permeating the body with bliss and lightness, as a necessary part of cultivating the abhiññās The emphasis on sukha or bliss in Theravāda may be surprising to many students of Buddhism, as this tradition is usually, for understandable reasons, seen as placing a premium on equanimity (upekkhā) on all pleasant and painful sensations The emphasis on bliss is usually seen—again, for understandable reasons—as a unique hallmark of vajrayāna forms of Buddhism At a minimum it is interesting to see bliss highlighted in a certain Theravādin context here We also see in these texts how the physical was seen as indicative of psychic states This comes out, for example, in technique associated with the abhiññā of ‘reading others’ minds,’ in which a person’s disposition was dis-cerned by ascertaining the color of his or her blood Lastly, our findings here should caution us against what Bernard Fauré has called the ‘teleological fallacy’ in Buddhist studies, by which he means the tendency to read later developments onto earlier ones, or to interpret the past in terms of the present 70 With respect to Theravāda Buddhist yoga or meditation, history has seen an ever-increasing emphasis on vipassanā-bhāvanā over samatha-bhāvanā over time, to the point where many leading Theravāda mediation masters and teachers emphasize the former greatly over the latter, not infrequently to the point of excluding cultivation of the latter This, I think, has too often led scholars to underestimate the importance of the jhānas and abhiññās in early Theravāda Theravāda is often inac-curately seen as always asserting that only vipassanā practice engen-dered insights of soteriological importance While samatha practice has almost surely been seen by most as secondary and preparatory to vipassanā, in its production of the degree of calm and concentration 70 Bernard

success of a doctrinal argument hinges on the success of a poetics, and vice versa ”2 The literary dimensions of the work, especially its wonder-working episodes, combine with its dialectical arguments to support a specific set of doctrinal positions 3 But what doctrinal arguments do 1 scholars have previously recognized the significance of wondrous displays of superhuman power in this

This chapter will seek to illuminate the connection between wonders and doctrine in the Vimalakīrtinirdeśa by drawing on the broader Indian Buddhist discourse on the miracu-lous In particular, it will argue that the sūtra collapses the distinction between miracles and marvels, posing a challenge to the cross-cultural interpretation of wonders in Indian Buddhist literature The specific technical terminology and narrative imagery used to connect the doctrines and wonders in the Vimalakīrtinirdeśa needs to be clarified and set within the context of the broader Buddhist dis-course on wonders (miracles, marvels) and superhuman powers 4 The primary hermeneutical devise that Hamlin uses to connect the won-ders and dialectical arguments is upāya or upāyakauśalya, ‘skill in means’ 5 Although upāyakauśalya is an important concept in the scripture, the distinction that Hamlin draws between two ‘modes’ of ‘skill in means’, the ‘verbal-homiletic’ and the ‘spectacular’, does not explicitly appear nor am I aware of a Buddhist text that classifies upāya in this way 6 still, the distinction is useful, and by coining the terms ‘magical upāya’ and ‘upāyic magic’, Hamlin suggests that upāya dovetails with the concept of ‘magical illusion’ (māyā) to illustrate the wondrous nature of inconceivable liberation and other Buddhist doc-trines In addition, the sūtra evokes a broad Buddhist discourse sur-rounding various Buddhist terms for ‘superhuman knowledge and power’ (ṛddhi, adhiṣṭhāna, vikurvaṇa, abhijñā, anubhāva, and so on), and on the Buddhist concept of the ‘miracle’

as having natural causes that we simply fail to understand, whereas miracles were ‘unusual and difficult’ events, “produced by God’s power alone on things that have a natural tendency to the opposite effect ”8 Magic and witchcraft were also considered to have natural causes and there-fore classified as marvels, whereas miracles were defined as being caused by the supernatural force of God 9 “While preserving the pos-sibility of objective verification of miracles as contra naturam,” Carolyn Walker Bynum concludes, “such definitions led to an ever-increasing sense that seemingly extraordinary events could be explained (that is, rationalized) as ruled by laws of nature ”10 Thus, wonder was increasingly seen in late medieval europe as leading to and being replaceable by knowledge, though wonders were still thought to pose a challenge and even a threat to human reason When we consider the case of classical south Asian religions, Indian Buddhism shares with other south Asian religious traditions the assumption that it is possible to acquire diverse superhuman pow-ers through a variety of means, including the practice of meditation and use of magical charms, mantras, spells, and amulets At the same time, different Buddhists at different times seem to have held differing views on the efficacy and propriety of displaying superhuman powers The value of displaying them as a means of generating faith (prasāda) is acknowledged or demonstrated in sources from the Avadānaśataka to the Abhidharmakośabhāṣya, while other texts downplay the efficacy of such displays and even criticize them 11 In doing so, such texts often attempt to distinguish Buddhism from other contemporaneous reli-gious traditions by contrasting the ‘miracles’ performed by its own 7 Caroline Walker Bynum,

for the powers themselves, with the notion of ‘superhuman power’ redefined in ways that could emphasize uniquely Buddhist attainments over those more generally achievable The best known example of the skepticism in south Asian Buddhist literature regarding the display of superhuman powers is found in the Kevaṭṭa-sutta 12 In that Pāli scripture, a lay disciple named Kevaṭṭa encourages the Buddha to direct his monks to display their superhu-man powers The Buddha responds by asking Kevaṭṭa to imagine a conversation between two people, one of whom has faith in Buddhism and another that does not The faithful person witnesses a wondrous display of superhuman power, and tells the faithless person about it The faithless person responds by noting that such displays are also caused by a particular charm or amulet Thus, the faithless person explains away the wonder, his skepticism apparently rooted in his rec-ognition that not all wonders are equally wonderful The Kevaṭṭa-sutta appears to rely upon an ontological distinction between different types of wonders similar to what one finds in medi-eval Christian discourse Rather than arguing that the Buddha and his followers have superhuman powers acquired through true meditative mastery, however, the scripture makes a general critique of wonders It claims that there are three types of wonder, wondrous displays of superhuman power, telepathic ability, and teaching the Dharma, and that the real ‘miracle’ occurs when the Buddha and his monks teach the Dharma Thus, Luis Gómez may be accurate in characterizing the Kevaṭṭa-sutta as ‘rationalistic’ in at least two senses 13 First, teaching the Dharma is valued over displays of superhuman power and telepa-thy, and second, the wondrous is embedded in a scholastic ratiocina-tion on

Kevaṭṭa-sutta with its apparent valuation in the Vimalakīrtinirdeśa, as though these texts represent the general attitude towards wonders in mainstream and Mahāyāna Buddhist lit-erature,

to assume that miracles in Mahāyāna sūtras neces-sarily postdate those found in mainstream literature It may be more accurate to say that mainstream and Mahāyāna Buddhist miracle sto-ries (and

Buddhist Discourse on superhuman PowersThe previous section alluded to the fact that the Buddhist notion of superhuman power becomes a site for scholastic classification and redefinition, a process that effectively distinguishes between various levels of holiness and spiritual attainment Probably the most com-mon term for ‘superhuman power’ in Indian Buddhist literature is iddhi in Pāli; its Buddhist sanskrit equivalent is ṛddhi, not siddhi, although the latter is one of the commonly used terms for such powers in tantric and non-Buddhist literature Grammatically speaking, iddhi/ṛddhi is an abstract noun derived from a verb root, √ṛdh, which means to flourish, prosper and succeed Thus, ṛddhi means an attain-ment or accomplishment In theory, these attainments or powers may be achieved through the practice of meditation As vasu bandhu tells us in the Abhidharmakośabhāṣya, “ṛddhi stands for meditation (samādhi) ” using an etymological argument, he goes on to explain that these powers are called ṛddhi, because meditation is the means by which one ‘achieves’ (ṛdhyati) or ‘wins’ (samṛdhyati) ṛddhi 20Through a series of semantic equivalencies and extensions, which may be traced partly through various scholastic classifications of the different types of ṛddhi/iddhi, adhiṣṭhāna and vikurvaṇa come to replace ṛddhi as the terms most commonly used in Mahāyāna Buddhist literature to designate the superhuman powers of buddhas and bodhi-sattvas Adhiṣṭhāna suggests power and control in both the temporal and the supernatural sense,21 while vikurvaṇa refers primarily to the transformation and magical creation of material objects These words come to be used generically to refer to the range of different powers on display in Mahāyāna scriptures like the Vimalakīrtinirdeśa 22In the Pāli Canon, the standardized list of superhuman powers includes the power to multiply the body or produce replicas, fly, pass 20 swāmī Dwārikādās Śāstrī, ed , The

24 In later Pāli scholastic literature, such as the Paṭisambhidāmagga and Visuddhi-magga, these powers fall under the general category of superhuman powers of ‘control’ (adhiṭṭhāna, adhiṣṭhāna) They are also connected to powers of transformation (vikubbana, vikurvaṇa) and creating ‘mind-made bodies’ (mano-maya-kāya) 25 The Abhidharmakośa clas-sifies superhuman powers into powers of ‘motion’ (gamana) and ‘cre-ation’ (nirmāṇa), while the Bodhisattvabhūmi divides them into ‘powers of transformation’ (pāriṇāmikī ṛddhi) and ‘powers of cre-ation’ (nairmāṇikī ṛddhi) 26 With the superhuman power of creation, the Bodhisattvabhūmi tells us, “one accomplishes, with a thought of creation (nirmāṇacitta), the construction of whatever one desires ” The text defines ‘a created thing’ as “in brief, something without a material cause” (samāstaḥ nirvastukaṃ nirmāṇaṃ) 27 In these later scholastic texts, one can see expansion in the list of powers, reflecting their diversity in narrative literature,

subsumed within broader classifications of spiritual attainments, particularly the so-called ‘super-knowledges’ (abhiññā, abhijñā) The list of abhijñās brings together the ‘various superhuman powers’, along with tele-pathic power and clairaudience, under a single typology with the list of three ‘knowledges’ (vijjā, vidyā), which some sources claim the Buddha realized during his awakening 29 The three knowledges are the memory of previous lives, the knowledge of the arising and passing away of living beings, also called the divine eye, and the knowledge that the defilements leading to future rebirth have been destroyed some scholars have suggested that the abhijñās constitute an alterna-tive system for classifying spiritual attainments not easily incorpo-rated into the standard path system or attributes of the Buddha 30 Yet, there are Buddhist texts that describe the Buddha’s awakening in terms of acquisition of the abhijñās 31 Although meditation is perhaps the primary method by which ascetics acquire such powers, it is not the only way acknowledged in Buddhist discussions Powers acquired by meditation are contrasted with those caused by magical charms and amulets, called vijjā/vidyā We saw this opposition utilized in the Kevaṭṭa-sutta, and Pāli scholas-tic manuals include such powers in their classifications of iddhi 32 As we have seen, superhuman powers caused by magic are generally less worthy of respect than those acquired through meditation Yet, this is only one of a number of strategies that Buddhist texts use to contrast ers of others

of superhuman powers For instance, the Pāli commentary on the Theragāthā tells a story about a monk named Pilindavaccha 33 Before the Buddha’s awaken-ing, Pilindavaccha was an ascetic in possession of a ‘Lesser Gandhāra Charm’ (cūḷagandhāravijjā), granting him the power to fly and read others’ minds After the Buddha achieves awakening, however, Pilin-da vaccha finds that his powers no longer work He goes to the Buddha, believing him to possess a ‘Greater Gandhāra Charm’ (mahāgan-dhāravijjā) that will restore his power After becoming a monk under the Buddha’s dispensation, Pilindavaccha achieves the status of an arhat Thus, the story plays upon the dual sense of vidyā as magic and knowledge, suggesting that the Buddha’s presence neutralizes lesser magic while his teaching leads to liberation At the same time, the story provides evidence of the Buddhist belief that non-Buddhist ascetics could also achieve some level of superhuman power We can understand something similar in the important contrast between ‘noble’ and ‘ignoble’ superhuman powers found in the Sam-pasādanīya-sutta of the Pāli Dīgha-nikāya 34 There, the standardized canonical list of superhuman powers (multiplication, flight, etc ) is called ‘ignoble’ or ‘common’, literally ‘un-Aryan’ (an-ariya), because as the text explains, such powers are not free of “defilements” (Pāli: āsava, sanskrit: āśrava) and “attachments” (upadhi) These un-Aryan superhuman powers are contrasted with ‘noble’ or Aryan (ariya) superhuman power, which refers to the equanimity achieved by becoming detached from seeing things as inherently attractive or repulsive 35 By redefining the concept of ‘superhuman power’ in this 33 ThgA i 53-55 This story is briefly recounted and discussed in John strong, “When Magical Flight Fails: A study of some Indian Legends About the Buddha and his Disciples ” unpublished presentation at the university of Michigan March 28, 2008 34 D iii 99ff 35 Here is part of the description of ‘noble superhuman power’ in the Sam-pasādanīya-sutta: “now, if a monk wishes, ‘May I abide perceiving as attractive what is repulsive,’ he dwells there perceiving [it] as attractive If a monk wishes, ‘May I abide perceiving as repulsive what is attractive,’ he dwells there perceiving [it] as repulsive... If a monk wishes, ‘May I abide attentive and aware in equanimity having gotten rid of conceptions of what is repulsive, attractive or both,’ he so abides in equanimity attentive and aware ” (D iii 113) This description is quoted verbatim in the Paṭisambhidāmagga, as well as the Mahāyāna treatise known as the Mahā prajñā-pāramitāśāstra see taylor, Paṭisambhidāmagga, vol 2, p 211, and Lamotte, Le traité"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"wondrous display of superhuman power 107way, the scripture not only emphasizes a particularly Buddhist attain-ment over one more generally achievable The Visuddhimagga com-ments that Aryan superhuman power is called noble, because it is possessed only by the noble ones, a class traditionally comprised by the Buddha and his ‘noble disciples’ (ariya-sāvaka) in contrast to ‘ordinary people’ (puthujjana, pṛthagjana) 36 It also suggests that ‘super human powers’ ordinarily conceived are achievable by non-Buddhists In these examples, one can discern a tension between superhuman power and liberating knowledge that is most clearly apparent in the standard classification of the six abhijñās, which include both super-human powers and knowledge that the defilements leading to future rebirth have been destroyed According to Buddhist path manuals, such as the Śrāvakabhūmi and the Visuddhimagga, the first five abhijñās, including the various superhuman powers, are classified as fruits of the ‘mundane path’ (lokiyamagga, laukikamārga), while the sixth abhijñā, the knowledge that the defilements have been destroyed, results from following the ‘transmundane path’ (lokuttaramagga, lokottaramārga) 37 In brief, the transmundane path consists in per-ceiving ‘as they really are’ (yathābhūtaṃ) the four noble truths, namely suffering (duḥkha), its origin (samudaya), its cessation (nirodha) and the path (mārga) to its cessation 38 Thus, acquiring the sixth abhijñā is deemed to be tantamount to cessation and liberation de la grande vertu de sagesse, vol 4, pp 1819 In the latter, ‘noble superhuman power’ forms a third category of superhuman power alongside powers of motion and powers of creation It is described as ‘sovereignty over the six objects of the senses’, which the Mahāyāna treatise claims is possessed in full only by the Buddha 36 Warren and Kosambi, Visuddhimagga of Buddhaghosâcariya, p 321; Ñāṇa-moli, Visuddhimagga: The Path of Purification, 1999, 377 For the distinction between ārya and pṛthagjana, which does not quite parallel that between ‘Buddhist’ and ‘non-Buddhist’, see Peter Masefield, Divine Revelation in Pali Buddhism (Colombo: sri Lanka Institute of traditional studies; London: Allen & unwin, 1986), pp 1-36 technically speaking, the class of noble ones is comprised of those disciples who have achieved the four highest levels of the path, namely that of ‘stream-enterer’ (sotāpanna), ‘once-returner’ (sakadāgāmin), ‘non-returner’ (anāgā-min) and arhat 37 Florin Deleanu, The

whereas the five mundane abhijñās are conditioned and theoretically available to all those (Buddhist and non-Buddhist) who achieve certain heights of meditative concentration 39References in the Vimalakīrtinirdeśa to the sets of five and six abhijñās make it clear that it knows the distinction between the mun-dane and the transmundane abhijñās For instance, in his discussion with Aniruddha, the disciple sometimes considered to be foremost in possessing the divine eye, vimalakīrti challenges him to explain the nature of his attainment “Is the divine eye constructed or is it uncon-structed,” asks vimalakīrti “If it is constructed, then it is has the same nature as the five abhijñās possessed by non-Buddhists (literally, ‘out-siders’, bāhya, a term synonymous with pṛthagjana) If it is uncon-structed, then it is not possible to see with it How then do you see, elder?”40 This Madhyamaka-style argument relies on the assumption that the five abhijñās, including the divine eye, are mundane, con-structed, and that they can be attained by non-Buddhists In contrast, vimalakīrti claims that buddhas possess a divine eye with which they can see all the lands of the buddhas without leaving their state of meditative concentration or being affected by duality A similar point is made later when vimalakīrti asserts that the sphere of the bodhisattvas is the six abhijñās, but without the destruction of the defilements 41 Finally, towards the end of the scripture, vimalakīrti again says that the bodhisattva does not abide in the unconstructed 39 not all Buddhists seem to have agreed that the five mundane abhijñās are achievable by non-Buddhists According to vasumitra’s doxography of early Bud-dhist schools, the sarvāstivādins and vātsiputriyas held that non-Buddhist ascetics could acquire them, while the Mahīśāsakas, Dharmaguptakas and Haimavatas held that non-Buddhists could only achieve superhuman powers of flight and so on by means of magical charms and spells see André Bareau, Les Sectes Bouddhiques du Petit Véhicule Publications de l’École Française d’extrême-orient, vol 38 (Paris: École Française d’extrême-orient, 1955), pp 116, 183, 263 The Śrāvakabhūmi also holds that the five mundane abhijñās are fruits of following the mundane path, but also includes an intriguing passage that contrasts Aryan and un-Aryan ‘superhuman powers’ in the following manner: “The distinction between noble and ignoble super-human powers is this: whatever thing is transformed by means of noble superhuman powers, whatever magical creation is magically created, it becomes so in reality and not otherwise And everything can perform its function With ignoble superhuman powers, [the transformed or created thing] does not become so in reality, but rather it is said to be like the mere appearances of the magician ” In this passage, magic (or marvel) and miracle are clearly distinguished in ontological terms see Karunesha shukla, ed ,

non-Buddhists, and the sixth transmundane abhijñā, which is unique to buddhas (and bodhisattvas or ‘buddhas to be’) Yet, the Vimalakīrtinirdeśa also suggests that buddhas and bodhisattvas can keep one foot in the mundane realm and another in the transmun-dane realm, combining their enlightening activity with liberating insight out of great compassion and love for other sentient beings 43The distinction between the mundane and the transmundane is germane to our comparative, hermeneutical question about how Indian Buddhism conceptualizes wondrous displays of superhuman powers Are they

suggests an order and regularity of all things, even wonders take, for instance, the narrative description of the Bud-dha’s smile in the Avadānaśataka Dharmatā here explains certain regularities regarding the rays of the light that radiate from the Buddha’s mouth when he smiles see David v Fiordalis, “Miracles and superhuman Powers in south Asian Buddhist Literature” (PhD Dissertation university of Michigan, 2008), pp 22ff Andy Rotman points out more instances of the use of the term in the Divyāvadāna For instance, dharmatā is used to describe the consistent cause and effect relationship that exists between seeing a miracle, or what one takes to be a miracle, and the arising of faith (prasāda), and the natural regularity with which reliquaries for the Buddha are built and venerated see Rotman, Divine Stories, pp 72, 97, 104 There does not seem to be any distinction here between the natural and the supernatural Rather, all things behave in a manner that is consistent

trans-mundane knowledge is transmitted by the Buddha when he teaches the Dharma, which the Kevaṭṭa-sutta suggests is the ‘true miracle’ 45 on the other hand, Buddhist miracle stories that positively portray wondrous displays of superhuman power suggest that such displays are not made without reason Instead, they suggest a consistency of sacred purpose connecting wondrous displays of superhuman power to the liberating knowledge of the Dharma For instance, the miracles of the Buddha at Śrāvastī and sāṅkāśya are described as acts that all buddhas must perform (avaśya-karaṇīya) in their lifetime before entering nirvāṇa 46 Displays of superhuman power may thus be seen as an integral part of the liberating activity of the buddhas and bodhi-sattvas such sacred purpose often seems to be behind the wondrous displays of superhuman power in the Vimalakīrtinirdeśa, where such displays also illustrate specific points of doctrine At the same time, the distinction between the mundane and

its effects in chapter seventeen, nāgārjuna concludes with the following simile:Just as the teacher (i e , the Buddha) uses his superhuman powers (ṛddhi-sampadā) to conjure a magically created person (nirmita) and this conjured person (nirmita) conjures another conjured thing (nir-mita),In the same way, the agent [of an action] is like the conjured person and his action is like the other conjured thing Defilements, actions, bodies, agents, and effects are all like a city of celestial beings (gandharva-nagara), a mirage (marīci) and a dream (svapna) 50These verses come on the heels of an argument that action, agent and result are all ‘empty of inherent existence’ (niḥsvabhāva) While nāgārjuna does not come out and say explicitly that all dependently arisen phenomena are illusory, actions, defilements, and so forth are all compared to the magical illusion of an illusory power, an illusion produced by an illusion produced by the Buddha’s superhuman pow-ers The metaphor of the magical illusion is linked to the doctrine of the non-arising of all phenomena, that is, their emptiness of intrinsic existence This is, as it were, the ultimate truth Thus, the metaphor of the magical illusion becomes one of the bridges used to connect the conventional perspective and ultimate truth As do other Mahāyāna sūtras, the Vimalakīrtinirdeśa uses the met-aphor of the magical illusion to describe the insubstantial nature of conditioned phenomena, but it seems to take the metaphor further, although perhaps not as explicitly as the Bhadramāyākāravyākaraṇa does Although more obliquely and with a subtler sense of the dialec-tic between the conventional and ultimate perspectives, the Vimala-kīrti nirdeśa also suggests that conventional reality is an illusion, using the concept to forge the connection between doctrinal argument and miraculous demonstration take, for instance, the miracle that con-cludes the first chapter of the sūtra 51 The Buddha tells his audience that the purity (pariśuddha) of the ‘Buddha’s field’ (buddhakṣetra), that is, his universe or sphere of influence, is equivalent to the purity of his mind After hearing this, Śāriputra, the disciple who features 50 J W De Jong, Mūlamadhyamakakārikāḥ (Madras: Adyar Library and Research Center, 1977), p 24 51 Vkn, p 12ff"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"wondrous display of superhuman power 113throughout the sūtra as the voice of conventional understanding, wonders why this universe appears so impure After assuring Śāriputra that the impurities he perceives are the result of his own limitations, the Buddha touches his toe to the ground, whereby the entire universe is transformed into precious jewels “This is how my buddha-field always appears,” the Buddha tells Śāriputra, “but the Tathāgata (i e , the Buddha) makes it appear afflicted by various faults in order to bring lesser beings (hīnasattva) to spiritual maturity ”52The difference between seeing a pure buddha-field and an impure one is similar to that between understanding an illusion and being deceived by one This similarity, while not stated outright, is implied by the way the chapter concludes After the Buddha withdraws the miraculous vision,ei ghty-four thousand living beings, ‘who aspired to the excellent qual-ities of the Buddha’ (udārabuddhadharmādhimukta), understood that all phenomena have the characteristic of being involved in ‘illusion’ (viṭhapana) and gave rise to the thought for unexcelled, perfect and complete awakening 53 In this way, the chapter concludes by drawing connections between the wondrous demonstration of the Buddha’s power to manipulate reality as if it were an illusion, understanding the illusory, constructed nature of all phenomena, and the aspiration of the bodhisattva to become a buddha on several more occasions, the Vimalakīrtinirdeśa suggests that reality is like an illusion At one point in a conversation with Mahā-maud galyāyana, vimalakīrti explains that teaching the Dharma according to reality is like an ‘illusory person’ (māyā-puruṣa) teaching the Dharma to another ‘illusory person’ 54 Later, the disciple subhūti recounts an exchange with vimalakīrti where the latter exhorts the former not to be troubled by his words, since “all phenomena are characterized by magical illusion and magical creation (nirmita-māyā-svabhāva) ”55 In these instances, the doctrine of magical illusion is closely connected to emptiness and insubstantiality Yet, the meta-phor of the magical illusion is also coupled with the doctrine of tran-scendence in the sense that superhuman power (to produce magical 52 Vkn, p 13 53 Vkn, p 14 For discussion and references for the term viṭhapana, see Lamotte, L’enseignment de Vimalakirti, pp 124-125 54 Vkn, p

illness, a central plot-line in the scripture Is the illness real or is it just an illusion? “With his skill in means” (upāyakauśalyena), the sūtra explains, vimalakīrti “causes himself to appear sick” (glānam ātmānam upadarśayati) 56 By using the verb, ‘to appear’, the sūtra suggests that vimalakīrti’s appearance in the city of vaiśalī is also a magical illusion This puts a different twist on vimalakīrti’s question to subhūti: ‘Would you be afraid of a magical emanation of the Buddha?’ one subtext of the notion of appearance is the fact that vimalakīrti (or perhaps ulti-mately the Buddha) produces magical bodies so that he can appear in ‘impure’ buddha-fields like ours Another is the skill in means with which bodhisattvas and buddhas practice the path and save living beings without abiding in nirvāṇa In the scripture, vimalakīrti manifests himself as sick in order to teach other living beings about the insubstantial and impermanent nature of their own bodies, elaborating poetically upon a list of meta-phors like the ones we have seen above “Friends, the body is like a ball of foam, unable to bear any pressure,” vimalakīrti says “The body like a mechanical object (yantrabhūta), held together with bones and ten-dons The body is like a magical illusion consisting of the inverted views ”57 As vimalakīrti elaborates, he continues to draw upon the rich series of metaphors for describing the impermanence and insub-stantiality of conventional reality vimalakīrti then proceeds to con-trast the insubstantial, selfless, impermanent body with the body of the Buddha, which is a body of Dharma (dharmakāya) A similar contrast arises later in the sūtra in the brief story about a prior meeting between Ānanda and vimalakīrti once upon a time the Buddha was experiencing some physical ailment and asked Ānanda to fetch him some milk Ānanda had just arrived at the house of a Brahmin when vimalakīrti appeared and asked what he was doing Ānanda replied that he was retrieving some milk for the Buddha, because he was experiencing some physical ailment “Don’t say such a thing,” responded vimalakīrti, The body of the tathāgata is hard as a diamond, because he has elim-inated all the bad latent tendencies and possesses all the mighty qual-56 Vkn, p 17 57 Vkn, p 17"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"wondrous display of superhuman power 115ities of good How could illness or discomfort affect him? Be silent and go Do not belittle the Blessed one Do not speak in this way to others Do not let mighty gods and bodhisattvas visiting from other buddha-fields hear you... Go, Reverend Ānanda, go Do not bring shame on us Do not let other rival teachers, ascetics, or naked renunciants hear you Do not let them think, ‘This teacher cannot even cure his own illnesses How will he cure the illnesses of others?’ Reverend Ānanda, the tathāgatas have bodies of Dharma, not material bodies The tathāgatas have bodies that are transcendent (lokottara), because they have gone beyond all mundane qualities (lokadharma) The bodies of the tathāgatas experience no physical ailment, because they are freed of all defilements (sarvāsravavinivṛtaḥ) 58Hearing this statement by vimalakīrti, Ānanda wondered whether he misheard the Buddha, but just then he heard a voice from the sky: “Ānanda! It is as the householder says However, the Blessed one has arisen in the time of the five corruptions (kaṣāya) in order to train beings by acting poor, lowly and destitute Therefore, go and fetch the milk, Ānanda, and do not be ashamed ”59 Thus, while clearly opposing the transcendent and the mundane, the passage does not clearly indi-cate whether the Buddha was or merely acted ill vimalakīrti also makes his sickness a metaphor for his Bodhisattva vow Mañjuśrī politely inquires about his illness by asking, “From where has your illness arisen, Householder? How long will your ill-ness last? When will it subside?” to this vimalakīrti replies: Mañjuśrī, my illness will last as long as ignorance and thirst for exis-tence last When all beings become free of illness, then my illness will be eased What is the reason for this? For, Mañjuśrī, the Bodhisattva is in saṃsāra for the sake of living beings, and sickness is attached to saṃsāra... You ask me, Mañjuśrī, from where my illness has arisen The illness of the Bodhisattvas arises from great compassion 60In this way, vimalakīrti turns Mañjuśrī’s seemingly innocuous ques-tion into a more profound teaching about the bodhisattva path Again, however, vimalakīrti’s answer does little to resolve the tension 58 Vkn, p 33-34 59 Vkn, p 34 The sanskrit here seems to follow the tibetan, whereas Lamotte suggests that the Chinese translations may have possessed a variant reading whereby the negative qualities are applied to the living beings, not to the Buddha For discus-sion and references to the five corruptions, see Lamotte, L’enseignment de Vimala-kirti, 188 60 Vkn, p 46-47"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"david v fiordalis116between reality and illusion that the metaphor of magical illusion seems to bridge If vimalakīrti and Śākyamuni possess bodies of Dharma like other buddhas and other advanced bodhisattvas, how is it possible for them simultaneously to manifest themselves in ‘impure’ buddha-fields? one answer appears to be found in the doctrine of the three bodies, which also utilizes the metaphor of magical creation (nirmāṇa) When the bodhisattvas from the ‘pure’ buddha land, sarvagandhasugandha, hear vimalakīrti’s description of how Śākyamuni teaches the Dharma in the ‘impure’ buddha-field by stressing the distinction between right view and wrong view, they exclaim, “It is amazing (āścaryaṃ) how the Buddha Śākyamuni holds back his ‘greatness’ (buddhamāhātmya) in order to discipline the poor, unrefined, and unruly beings there ”61 While the passage does not specifically mention the Buddha’s magical body, it seems to cast the Buddha as a magician who paradoxically uses his superhuman power to conceal his superhuman powers for the sake of teaching people at the level of their understanding elsewhere in the text, a goddess who lives in vimalakīrti’s house teaches Śāriputra the ultimate truth by relying specifically on the met-aphor of the magically created body ever expressing the conventional perspective, Śāriputra innocuously asks the goddess where she will be reborn when she dies The goddess responds, “I will be reborn where a magical emanation (nirmita) of the tathāgatas is reborn ” sāriputra interjects, “but the magical emanation of the tathāgatas is not born and does not die ” “In the same way,” the goddess replies, “all phe-nomena are not born and do not die ”62 The answer makes sense in terms of conventional truth, whereby it is true that magically created bodies are not subject to birth and death in the same way as real bod-ies are However, the idea of the magically created emanations of the Buddha is extended to all phenomena in a way that stresses their ulti-mate emptiness 61 Vkn, p 97 The text uses the term pratisaṃhṛtya (prati + saṃ + √hṛ) in the sense of ‘holding back’ one wonders if this word might have been chosen for poetic purposes in place of saṃvṛti (saṃ + √vṛ), which has the sense of concealment, hid-ing The latter is also a common term for the conventional truth In any case, the text uses prati-sam-√hṛ earlier in the sūtra to describe how the Buddha ‘withdraws’ (pratisaṃharati) his superhuman power (ṛddhi) to conclude the miraculous vision 62 Vkn, p 74"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"wondrous display of superhuman power 117In a later passage that closely parallels this one, Śāriputra asks vimalakīrti from what universe he was reborn into this one vimalakīrti’s response echoes that of the goddess:[vimalakīrti asked,] “Reverend Śāriputra, were one to ask a magically created man or woman, ‘From where have you died and been reborn,’ what would they answer?” [Reverend Śāriputra] responded, “noble sir, they would say that a magically created person does not die and is not born ”[vimalakīrti] said, “Reverend Śāriputra, hasn’t the tathāgata taught that all phenomena have the essential nature of a magical creation?”Reverend Śāriputra] replied, “Indeed he has, noble sir ”63vimalakīrti uses the metaphor of the magical illusion to establish that things ultimately do not arise and are not destroyed, but by claiming that things have the essence of a magical creation, it seems that he affirms the conventional nature of reality in some respect Indeed, the Buddha then goes on to tell Śāriputra that vimalakīrti left the Abhirati universe of the Buddha Akṣobhya Thus, the metaphor of the magical illusion seems to bridge the divide that is set up between the mundane world and the transcendent body of Dharma, and between the con-ventional and the ultimate truths As the chapter of the goddess begins, Mañjuśrī and vimalakīrti discuss the question of how a Bodhisattva who views all living be-ings as a wise man views the moon in the water, as magician views a magical creation, and so forth, can simultaneously feel great love and great compassion for them The miracles of the goddess seem to illustrate vimalakīrti’s response that great love can only arise from understanding emptiness The goddess appears in the room, and showers the Bodhisattvas and disciples with flowers The flowers fall from the bodies of the Bodhisattvas, but stick to the bodies of the disciples ‘With their wondrous displays of superhuman powers’ (ṛddhiprātihāryaiḥ), the disciples try to shake them off, but cannot do so The goddess then asks Śāriputra, “noble Śāriputra, why do you shake off the flowers?” Again, Śāriputra provides the foil of conven-tional truth He exclaims, “Goddess, these flowers are not proper (akalpika); therefore I am trying to shake them off ” The implication is that flowers are not appropriate for monks to wear, but the passage plays on the meaning of the word improper, akalpika The goddess 63 Vkn, p 110-111"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"david v fiordalis118responds that the flowers are proper (kalpika), a term that is closely related to vikalpa, which means ‘mental construction’ she continues: The elder Śāriputra discriminates (kalpayati) and conceptualizes (vikal-payati)... Those who do not discriminate or conceptualize, they are proper (kalpika) Look, Śāriputra, the flowers do not stick to these great beings, because they have destroyed all discrimination and conceptu-alization 64Flowers here represent human passion, desire, love, and attachment Thus, the goddess’s marvelous display illustrates vimalakīrti’s argu-ment that one can only generate great love and great compassion when one does not discriminate or conceptualize Later, the goddess illustrates a similar point by using the example of the magical illusion Śāriputra asks why she does not simply change out of her female form she responds by asking him: “If a magician created a woman with his magic and you were to ask her why she did not change out of her female form, what would she say?” The goddess then “engages her superhuman powers of control” (adhiṣṭhānam adhitiṣṭhati) to transform herself into Śāriputra and Śāriputra into her own female form she prompts him to change himself out of his new female form, and he cannot He exclaims, “I don’t know what to change!” The goddess concludes, If you, Śāriputra, could change out of your female form, then all women could change out of their female form Just as the elder [Śāriputra] is not a woman, but only appears as one, in the same way, all women in the form of women are not women, but appear in the form of women With reference to this, the Blessed one said, “All phenomena are neither male nor female ”65It is unclear precisely what views of gender and sexuality the chapter advocates in this passage Śāriputra first seems to make a sexist remark, implying that the female state is somehow less desirable than the male The goddess responds by changing him into a woman, a state from which he is unable to transform himself What does she mean by drawing the comparison between Śāriputra, magically transformed into a woman, and all women?

does Śāriputra return to being himself While the goddess uses her super-human powers to control Śāriputra, the miraculous demonstration emphasizes that all things have the nature of a magical illusion, and that removing discrimination ultimately gives one power over reality The image one gets of the powerful woman exerting control over a man is thereby sublimated beneath the doctrine of magical illusion still, the metaphor suggests that magical illusions have a certain type of reality, governed by real, if conventional rules These examples of the wondrous demonstration of magical creation and transformation demonstrate the flexibility of the metaphor of magical illusion It can convey the insubstantiality and the substantive appearance of reality, an ontological status between the real and the unreal Buddhas and bodhisattvas combine their application of superhuman powers with their transcendence of the mundane realm through their wondrous display of magical creation and transformation Another concept that combines wondrous power and liberating knowledge is ‘inconceiv-able liberation’ (acintya-vimokṣa) Inconceivable LiberationThe Vimalakīrtinirdeśa is also called ‘an instruction on inconceivable liberation’, signifying the importance of this concept to the sūtra as a whole 66 vimalakīrti’s ‘skill in means’ is described as inconceivable, and his superhuman powers result from his ‘inconceivable liberation’ (acintya-vimokṣa) This is illustrated with a miracle As in the contrast between ordinary bodies and the body of Dharma, the chapter on inconceivable liberation begins with vimalakīrti contrasting conven-tional reality with the Dharma In the process, he stresses the tran-scendent nature of the Dharma, which is not an object (aviṣaya), being free from all conceptualization, verbalization, defilement, and so on 67vimalakīrti’s lecture on Dharma is prompted by sāriputra, whose mind is yet again focused on the mundane when he wonders where all

world-system called Merudhvajā vimalakīrti places these thrones in his house without shrinking them in size or expanding the house to fit them Given the sharpness with which vimalakīrti criti-cizes Śāriputra for thinking about a chair, one might wonder why he then brings them in such miraculous fashion on one level, it seems that vimalakīrti is merely impressing Śāriputra and the other mem-bers of the audience However, the miracle of the chairs is only the first in a sequence of miracles, each of which seems intended to exem-plify the inconceivable nature of liberation by confounding one’s expectations about the possible and impossible For instance, the bodhisattva who abides in the inconceivable lib-eration is described as having the ability to take Mt sumeru, the high-est and biggest of mountains, and put it inside a mustard seed, without the former becoming smaller or the latter becoming larger The bod-hisattva who abides in the inconceivable liberation can pour all of the waters of the oceans into one pore of his own skin without the water-dwelling creatures knowing it or becoming injured in any way The bodhisattva who abides in the inconceivable liberation can pick up a universe of many thousands of worlds, spin it on his finger like a pot-ter’s wheel, throw it like a discus beyond countless other world-sys-tems, catch it and put it back where it was without anyone knowing The bodhisattva who abides in the inconceivable liberation can make a week seem like an eon, or make an eon seem like the passing of a week 68The sequence of miracles continues, but these examples are enough for us to gain a sense for how they demonstrate inconceivability In each case, the miraculous display violates common expectations or fundamental rules regarding the nature of reality The same paradigm appears in the last of the miracles of the Vimalakīrtinirdeśa, when vimalakīrti displays the Abhirati universe in front of the Buddha and a great multitude Without getting up from his chair, vimalakīrti picks up the Abhirati universe and all it contains, and like a potter at his wheel, reduces it in size, carries it to our universe, and displays it before the Buddha and his audience 69 These miracles violate basic conceptions of dimensionality, space, and time in order to illustrate 68 Vkn, pp 58-61 69 Vkn, p

inconceivability pushes back against any attempt to reduce the wondrous to knowledge, reducing the tension between liberating knowledge and superhuman power contained in Buddhist classifications of spiritual attainment ConclusionIn Buddhist miracle tales featuring wonder-working contests, the dis-tinction between miracle and magical illusions or mere trickery seems relatively straightforward The Buddha and his disciples possess superhuman powers that far exceed those possessed by the non-Bud-dhist ascetics, whose powers may derive from their asceticism or merely through their possession of magical spells and amulets In some cases, like the story of sirigutta and Garahadinna told in the Dhammapada commentary, which bears some strong similarities to the Bhadramāyākāravyākaraṇa, or the story of the Śrāvastī miracles in the Divyāvadāna, the Buddha’s rivals do not even seem to possess superhuman powers 70 In other cases, however, ‘mundane’ superhu-man powers are contrasted with the ‘transmundane’ knowledge of the Buddha, who performs the ‘true miracle’ by teaching the Dharma leading to liberation In these various ways, one can discern a contrast between marvel and miracle in the Indian Buddhist discourse on the miraculous In Mahāyāna Buddhist literature, the concern for establishing the bodhisattva ethos of wisdom and compassion over what Mahāyāna texts call the ‘lesser aspiration’ of the disciples leads to an emphasis on the cultivation of superhuman powers As the Bodhisattvabhūmi clearly states, buddhas and bodhisattvas have two reasons for cultivat-ing superhuman powers They do so, first of all, “in order to convert living beings with a wondrous display and introduce them to the Dharma,” and secondly “in order to assist living beings in manifold 70 DhA i 434ff

of superhuman power serve a ‘religious’ purpose, another reason to consider them miracles Yet, Mahāyāna literature also liberally employs the tropes of the magi-cian and magical illusion to describe buddhas and bodhisattvas and their liberating behavior For instance, the Bhadramāyākāravyākaraṇa, which features the theme of the wonder-working contest between the Buddha and a non-Buddhist magician, explicitly calls the Buddha a magician, while the Vimalakīrtinirdeśa features characters (the Buddha, vimalakīrti, the goddess) who produce wondrous displays to illustrate doctrinal points about emptiness, magical illusion, and inconceivable liberation These Mahāyāna sūtras seem to make a point of demonstrating that buddhas and bodhisattvas liberate themselves and others not only through their understanding, but through their demonstration of the fact that reality is inconceivable, like a magical illusion 72If another of the key conceptual distinctions to be drawn between marvels (or magic) and miracles is the ontological difference between ‘natural’ and ‘supernatural’ causes, then the Vimalakīrtinirdeśa, with its emphasis on the doctrines of magical illusion and inconceivable liberation, can be interpreted as collapsing this distinction For bud-dhas and bodhisattvas would seem to inhabit an ontological position somewhere between the mundane and the transmundane This poses a problem for us as we seek to interpret and translate the plethora of Buddhist technical terms for superhuman power that one finds in the Vimalakīrtinirdeśa and throughout Indian Mahāyāna literature Are they best described as miraculous powers, magical powers, supernatu-ral powers, or superhuman powers?

Buddhist translation activities began in the second century ce in the eastern Hàn 東漢 state and continued for well over a millen-nium While many texts have been irretrievably lost to the ravages of political change, war, and persecution, enough remain to give scholars some precious details of Buddhism’s long history in east Asia and beyond This corpus also provides evidence for the study of south Asian religious history, since Chinese translations often preserve texts which would otherwise be lost in the mists of Indian time even when Indian counterparts exist, the dateable Chinese translations often rep-resent earlier stages of development, giving scholars valuable insight into the evolution of particular texts and traditions 1Were a south Asianist to survey works on east Asian Buddhism to learn more about the development of the notion of siddhi, she would doubtless emerge disappointed and confused There are no studies devoted to the emergence of this term in Chinese sources, and the few scholars that do discuss siddhis define the term quite differently In this short chapter, I hope to shed some light on the emergence of the siddhi in Chinese Buddhist texts, and to address some common mis-steps in scholarship on this concept 1 The Mahāmāyūrīvidyārājñī corpus provides an excellent example of the utility of Chinese translations for understanding the growth of Indian texts The six extant translations date from around the fourth century up through the eighth, and many differ radically from the extant sanskrit Mss For a good overview of the Mahā-māyūrī and its sources, see Henrik H sørensen, “The spell of the Great, Golden Peacock Queen: the origin, Practices, and Lore of an early esoteric Buddhist tradi-tion in China,” Pacific World, 3rd ser , no 8 (Fall 2006) some key episodes of the Mahāmāyūrī involving the cure of snakebite draw from a very deep well of Buddhist precedent, on which see Lambert schmithausen, Maitrī and Magic: Aspects of the Buddhist Attitude Toward the Dangerous in Nature (Wien: verlag der Öster-reichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, 1997)"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"128ryan richard overbeyThe word siddhi derives from the verbal root √sidh (‘to accom-plish’), and serves as a general term for ‘success’ or ‘achievement’ In this sense, the word is often used to represent a religious goal 2 In the Pātañjala Yogaśāstra as well as in Hindu and Buddhist tantric tradi-tions, siddhi can have a narrower semantic range, referring to particu-lar sets of extraordinary powers gained through religious practices, incantations, drugs, or other means 3 Siddhi in this narrower sense does not occur in Indian Buddhist literature before the rise of the tantric Buddhist texts of the seventh, eighth, and ninth centuries Siddhis are found in the Mañjuśrīmūla-kalpa,4 the Sarvadurgatipariśodhana,5 and other similarly late texts, but when earlier Buddhist texts occasionally use the word siddhi, they do so only with the broader meaning 6Given these facts, it would be a significant discovery indeed if one could find an example of siddhis in the narrow sense in Chinese Buddhist texts before the eighth century such an example would be our earliest evidence for the development or appropriation of this concept in the Buddhist context several scholars have implied the existence of siddhis in early Chinese Buddhism, and some have even named particular texts and passages which they claim provide evi-dence for the presence of siddhis before the eighth century I believe all these claims are mistaken The most common mistakes fall into three categories 2 see, for just one small example, Bhagavadgītā 12 10/Mahābhārata 6 34 10: abhyāse ’py asamartho ’si matkarmaparamo bhava / madartham api karmāṇi kurvan siddhim avāpsyasi “If you are incapable of rigorous practice, you should be devoted to acting for me By performing actions on my behalf, you will attain success (sid-dhi) ”3 see YŚ 4 1: janmauṣadhi-mantra-tapaḥ-samādhijāḥ siddhayaḥ “Siddhis come from birth, from drugs, from incantations, from ascetic practices, or from meditative concentration ” In this paper I refer to the Madras edition, but scholars should note the recent work of Philipp André Maas, whose critical edition of the first chapter is a welcome addition to scholarship on the Yogaśāstra see Samādhipāda: das erste Kap-itel des Pātañjalayogaśāstra zum ersten Mal kritisch ediert (Aachen: shaker verlag, 2006) 4 This text probably dates to sometime in the early Pāla dynasty, possibly around the eighth century see Matsunaga Yūkei, “on the Date of the Mañjuśrīmūlakalpa,” in Tantric and Taoist Studies in Honour of R.A. Stein, ed Michel strickmann Mélanges Chinois et Bouddhiques 22 (1985) 5 Sarvardurgatipariśodhana Tantra: Elimination of All Evil Destinies, ed tadeusz skorupski (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1983) 6 see, for example, the Mahāvastu Avadāna 3 115 2, which glosses the name siddhārtha with the expression sarvasiddhisaṃprāpta, “by whom all accomplish-ments are attained ”"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"appearance of siddhis in chinese buddhist texts129Mistake 1: using Siddhi as a Generic term for Ritual AttainmentsIn an influential article on the development of Buddhist tantrism in China, Chou Yi-liang highlighted the Dà jìyì shēnzhòu jīng 大吉義神呪經, translated by tányào 曇曜 in the fifth century, as an example of an early Chinese Buddhist text featuring siddhis According to Chou, in this text “[t]here are siddhis to win a war, to stop a storm, to obtain rain, to conceal one’s form, or to secure a wish-jewel ”7It would be exciting indeed to find siddhis in this text, but there are none The text does command the practitioner to burn incense before various statues of deities (tiān 天, *deva) and dragons (lóng 龍, *nāga) and to recite incantations in order to obtain rain or to acquire a wish-fulfilling gem (rúyì baˇozhū 如意寶珠, *cintāmaṇi) 8 However, nowhere does the text actually use the word siddhi to refer to the accomplish-ments of the ritual even if one concedes that many early Chinese Buddhist texts con-tain descriptions of ritual accomplishments that share many features with what later Buddhist texts would call siddhis, one is still left to wonder how and why the term siddhi would be used in some instances and not in others to call the ritual rewards in tányào’s translation siddhis on the basis of simple resemblance is to cut off prematurely a potentially rewarding avenue of research 9Mistake 2: Conflating Siddhi with ṚddhiIn Charles orzech’s fine work on Amoghavajra and the Scripture for Humane Kings, there is an interesting section entitled “Siddhi and salvation ” In this section, orzech makes a startling claim that “[t]he lists of abhijñās and of siddhis appear to have been formalized quite early in Buddhist history and are taken up in nikāya Buddhist and 7 Chou Yi-liang, “tantrism in China,” Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies 8, no 3-4 (March 1945): 243 8 t1335 21 579b1–c11 9 Chou’s mistake has been unfortunately repeated see, for instance, stephen Hodge’s introduction to his translation of the Mahāvairocanasūtra, where he claims that t1335 “also teaches various attainments (siddhi) to stop storms, to make rain, to become invisible, and so forth ” see Hodge, The Mahā-vairocana-abhisaṃbodhi Tan-tra with Buddhaguhya’s Commentary (London: RoutledgeCurzon, 2003), 8"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"130ryan richard overbeyMahāyāna texts alike ”10 This assertion is made possible by orzech’s claim that the word siddhi is synonymous with the word ṛddhi orzech does not argue this point, but simply asserts that the two concepts are equivalent The sanskrit word ṛddhi (Pāli: iddhi), from the root √ṛdh, refers to growth, prosperity or success In this final meaning the word has a long pedigree in Buddhist scripture and doctrine The various enu-merations of ṛddhi often form one item in lists of the superknowl-edges (abhijñā/abhiññā) From very early on we find various lists of ṛddhis which deal with the manipulation of matter, telekinesis, telepa-thy, mind control, and so on 11It is not immediately clear why supernormal powers associated with special types of knowledge would be semantically equivalent with siddhis as understood by the later tantric traditions However, argu-ments for the equivalence of these terms have a long and august pedi-gree The claim for equivalence was made by Mircea eliade, whose work on yoga influenced and inspired an entire generation of schol-ars 12In an article comparing the systems of Buddhism and Yoga, Louis de La vallée Poussin pointed out a close similarity in the lists of causes of siddhi and of abhijñā in the Yogaśāstra and in the Abhidharma-kośabhāṣya 13 YŚ 4 1 claims that siddhis come from birth, from drugs, from incantations, from ascetic practices, and from meditative con-centration 14 In the Abhidharmakośabhāṣya we find a very similar list of ṛddhis, which are brought about by meditation, birth, incantations, drugs, or actions 1510 Charles orzech, Politics and Transcendent Wisdom: the scripture for Humane Kings in the Creation of Chinese Buddhism (university Park, PA: The Pennsylvania state university Press, 1998), 51 11 Many scholars have discussed the abhijñās and ṛddhis in great detail see, for example, Louis de La vallée Poussin, “Le Bouddha et les Abhijñā,” Le Muséon 44 (1931): 335–342 More recently, see David Fiordalis’ excellent Ph D dissertation, “Miracles and superhuman Powers in south Asian Buddhist Literature,” university of Michigan, 2008 12 see Mircea eliade, Yoga: Immortality and Freedom, trans Willard R trask (Princeton, nJ: Princeton university Press, 1969), 177, which claims that the san-skrit word siddhi is equivalent to the Pāli word iddhi 13 Louis de La vallée Poussin, “Le Bouddhisme et le Yoga de Patañjali,” Mélanges Chinois et Bouddhiques 5 (1936–1937), 241–242 14 see above, note 3 15 see Abhidharmakośabhāṣya 7 53: avyākṛtaṃ bhāvanājaṃ trividhaṃ tūpapat-tijam /

to ṛddhi, but other scholars did sigurd Lindquist argued for the equiva-lence of Buddhist ṛddhi and yogic siddhi on precisely these grounds 16 Lindquist was also making a broader comparative argument through-out his essay, attempting to define yogic siddhi and Buddhist abhijñā as subjective mental states—illusions or hallucinations brought on by a kind of hypnosis in a mind systematically trained to focus on various stimuli 17 Lindquist wanted both Buddhism and yoga to speak the lin-gua franca of psychology, and in so doing he had to work in broad comparative strokes Lindquist’s work remains fascinating for its attempts to take the descriptions of supernormal powers seriously as psychological phe-nomena 18 But as we have already seen, the comparative impulse can foreclose interesting avenues of research even if we acknowledge that the siddhis of the Yogaśāstra and the ṛddhis of the Abhidharmakośa-bhāṣya are caused by the same phenomena, should we then conclude the terms are synonymous? even if, for the sake of argument, we con-cede that they may be considered synonymous, we still are confronted with the question of how and why Buddhist texts began referring to siddhis (and not ṛddhis) in esoteric texts of the seventh century and beyond even worse, a too-casual conflation of siddhi and ṛddhi can actually mislead scholars and their readers, giving the false impression that Buddhist esoteric discussions of siddhis were simply drawing from a continuous and unbroken tradition of siddhis leading back to the ear-liest texts of the tradition, or that siddhi was somehow a general term widespread throughout the history of the Buddhist religion 19 This has the effect of homogenizing and flattening what is in reality a more dynamic and interesting picture 16 sigurd Lindquist, Siddhi und Abhiññā: eine Studie über die klassischen Wunder des Yoga (uppsala: uppsala universitets Årsskrift, 1935), 25 17 I bid , 70 18 I n this respect Lindquist reminds me of Lucien Lévy-Bruhl, whose work attempted to save aboriginal cultures from charges of stupidity by relativizing and psychologizing their religious truth claims see Lévy-Bruhl, Les fonctions mentales dans les sociétés inférieures (Paris: F Alcan, 1910) 19 orzech says “Siddhi ... is the general term for soteriological accomplishment as well as for the attainment of ‘lesser’ ends ” see Politics and Transcendent Wisdom, 50"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"132ryan richard overbeyMistake 3: Misreadings of the ChineseThe sanskrit word siddhi is often translated into Chinese as chéngjiù 成就, ‘accomplish, attain, succeed’, or it is transliterated as xīdì 悉地 The word chéngjiù occurs with great frequency throughout the extant corpus of Chinese Buddhist texts, and it most commonly carries sid-dhi’s broad meaning of ‘accomplishment’ occasionally, when the word chéngjiù is found in a Chinese text in a context where ritual attainments are described, it is very tempting to guess that the notion of siddhi in its narrower meaning is being used Determining how precisely we should read the word chéngjiù in a spe-cific case is no easy task, and occasionally scholars can make mistakes that have broader implications for the history of Buddhist thought and ritual In an illuminating and useful article on the tradition of the Mahā-māyūrīvidyārājñī in China, Henrik sørensen notes that the Scripture on the Spell of the Great Golden Peahen Queen, translated sometime in the late fourth or early fifth century, contains an extensive list of ṛṣis who are said to wield special powers:The text reads that they “Always practice ascetic practices on moun-tains and in forests, such as the siddhi for the ending of suffering, siddhi of recollection, and the siddhi of the mantric arts ” The text goes on to explain that possessing and holding the names of these mahāṛṣis listed in the text enables the practitioner to attain supernatural powers, i e siddhis (Ch chengjiu 成就), such as the power to manifest respon-sive transformations (Ch ganbian, 感變), attain the five supernatural powers (skt pañcābhijñā), and fly through the air at will 20sørensen goes on to claim that this passage “may be one of the earliest references in Chinese to the type of yogic mastery of supramundane powers connected with the use of spells ... that we encounter with greater and greater frequency in the later esoteric Buddhist literature ”21If sørensen is correct, then we can locate the first appearance of the narrower meaning of siddhi in the Buddhist context to a fifth-century Chinese translation This would be a tremendously significant finding for the history of esoteric Buddhism unfortunately, I do not think that the text of t986 gives us the evidence we need to make this asser-tion 20 Henrik H

Here is the Chinese passage, followed by my mechanistically literal rendering, followed by sørensen’s polished translation:22終吉成就，志念成就，呪術成就，常修苦行，住止山林 ...Literal: end-fortune-success, recollection-success, spell-arts-success, always cultivate ascetic practices, reside mountains-forests...sørensen: Always practice ascetic practices on mountains and in for-ests, such as the siddhi for the ending of suffering23, siddhi of recollec-tion, and the siddhi of the mantric arts...sørensen has taken these twenty Chinese characters and rendered them into a comprehensible translation, interpreting the Chinese word as chéngjiù 成就 as siddhi This leads the reader to believe that the text here claims that the ṛṣis have mastered certain powers that fall into particular fixed categories (the ‘siddhi of recollection’, for instance) I would argue that the problem with this translation is that it is too nice—it reads the Chinese as good Chinese, rather than as that strange hybrid language in which so many Buddhist translations were com-posed 24 And in an effort to make the passage make sense, sørensen has misread chéngjiù in its broad sense as chéngjiù in the narrower sense This line of interpretation is further bolstered when we compare the Chinese translation to the sanskrit text We are extremely fortu-nate to have a sanskrit text for the Mahāmāyūrīvidyārājñī, and this text is very useful for understanding the peculiar syntax and vocabu-lary of the work’s numerous Chinese translations 25Here is the sanskrit text of the complete passage from takubo’s edition of the Mahāmāyūrī, followed by the Chinese translation in t986:26siddhānāṃ siddha-vratānāṃ siddha-vidyānāṃ終吉成就 志念成就 呪術成就22 The relevant passage may be found at t986 19 478b1–2 23 The Chinese reads jí 吉, fortune, which sØrensen seems to have reads as kŭ 苦, ‘ suffering’ 24 For an extreme example of the problems associated with ‘Buddhist Hybrid Chinese’, see stefano Zacchetti, “Dharmagupta’s unfinished translation of the Dia-mond-Cleaver (Vajracchedikā-prajñāpāramitā-sūtra),” T’oung Pao 82 1–3 (1996) 25 see Ārya-Mahā-Māyūrī Vidyā-Rājñī, ed takubo shuyō 田久保周誉 (tōkyō: sankibō Busshorin

the Chinese steps mechanically through the sanskrit, word by word and compound by compound When we read t986, we are not really reading beautiful Chinese We are instead reading ‘translation-ese’ Were one to translate the translation-ese rather than the Chinese, one would get something very close to the sanskrit, but with some small differences:now I will utter the names of those who have accomplished the ulti-mate fortune, who have accomplished the observance of vows, who have accomplished the spell arts, who always practice ascetic practices, who dwell in mountains and forests, who

notice immediately that nowhere in the sanskrit do we find the word siddhi; instead we find siddha, a past passive partici-ple meaning ‘accomplished, achieved’ It would be hasty, then, to claim that the MMvR lists various categories of siddhis, such as the siddhi of recollection or the siddhi of the mantric arts Rather, it praises the ṛṣis, lauding them for being accomplished in vows and spells nor does the text promise, as sørensen claims, that the practitioner will attain the power of flight or the five superknowledges through recita-27 I am reading this word, pañcābhijñānāṃ, as a genitive plural of the compound pañcābhijña, literally, ‘whose supernormal knowledges are five in number’ (pañca abhijñāḥ yasya saḥ), the sense being “possessing all five supernormal knowledges

possess (and for which they are being praised) This is a subtle distinction, but an extremely important one We do not yet see in the Mahāmāyūrī a newly emerging concept of siddhi as a discrete religious category This short exercise has doubtless tested the patience of the reader, so it is perhaps worthwhile to summarize Because the word siddhi—along with siddha, sidhyate, or any other words deriving from the root √sidh—can be translated with the Chinese word chéngjiù 成就, an anachronistic reading of siddhi into a Chinese Buddhist text is an all-too-easy possibility In order to read the word chéngjiù as siddhi, a more compelling case must be made Thanks to the hard work of the Chinese Buddhist electronic text Association (CBetA), scholars now have access to electronic texts of the taishō canon 28 This allows scholars to search a huge corpus of texts very quickly, and can allow one to venture answers to difficult questions As for the question of when the notion of siddhi first appeared in Chinese texts, even with the development of full-text electronic search, this remains quite difficult to answer A search of the entire canon for the word chéngjiù yields nearly 77,000 results, and evaluating whether or not this result is equivalent to the narrower meaning of the word siddhi or simply to its general meaning requires a detailed analysis of each case For the purposes of this chapter, I have analyzed the nearly 10,000 occurrences of chéngjiù in the works collected in volumes 18–21 of the taishō canon These volumes contain esoteric works imported by Śubhakarasiṃha, vajrabodhi, and Amoghavajra in the seventh and eighth centuries, as well as many earlier ‘prototantric’ texts 29 I have also surveyed the nearly 3,000 occurrences of the word xīdì across the entire canon 30 Though this search cannot be called exhaustive, I have come away confident that the earliest occurrences of the term siddhi 28 http://cbeta org29 on the difficulties associated with the term ‘prototantric’, see Robert sharf, Coming to Terms with Chinese Buddhism: A Reading of the treasure-store treatise (Honolulu: university of Hawai‘i Press, 2002), 263–278 30 The survey of the term xīdì in the canon did not yield new insights Most occurrences of xīdì in the taishō represent transliterations of the syllables siddhi as uttered in a dhāraṇī or vidyā They have the semantic force of ‘Abracadabra — suC-Cess!—Amen’, much in the same way we see words like daha, ‘BuRn!’ used in spells Moreover, most occurrences of xīdì fall into the same date range or later than the relevant occurrences of chéngjiù"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"136ryan richard overbeyin its narrow meaning are not found before the eighth century in this corpus of Chinese Buddhist texts While many earlier texts do contain the word chéngjiù, they use this word in its general meaning The word is most commonly used ver-bally in the sense of ‘attain’, as in this passage from the Mahāmeghasūtra translated by narendrayaśas:31汝大龍王，此呪名為「施一切樂陀羅尼句」，諸佛所持。汝等常須受持讀誦，吉事成就，得入法門，獲安隱樂。o Great nāga Kings, this spell, called the “dhāraṇī-words which grants bliss to all beings,” is upheld by the Buddhas You too should always remember and uphold and recite it, and you will attain auspicious karma, you will enter into the dharma gates, and you will obtain tran-quility and bliss Almost all instances of this word occur verbally A few instances occur nominally, and present more intriguing possibilities For example, in the Amoghapāśa Dhāraṇī translated by Jñānagupta in 587 we find:32然後，凡所作者，皆得成就。Then, as for whatever he does, he shall attain success The possibility to accomplish whatever one wants to accomplish seems a bit closer to the notion of siddhi in its narrower sense For the Amoghapāśadhāraṇī we also have an extant sanskrit manuscript, and on this passage the manuscript reads: yad icchati tat karoty eva sādhaka iti, “The sādhaka is a person who accomplishes whatever he desires ”33 This passage presents us with a mere hint of what we might consider siddhi, but the evidence is not conclusive enough to pass firm judgment upon it The unambiguous examples of siddhis in Chinese Buddhist litera-ture do not emerge until the eighth century In the Amoghapāśa-kalparāja, a large text translated in the first decade of the eighth century by Bodhiruci, we find many passages which describe siddhis in ways that leave nothing to guesswork In this text, siddhis are 31 t991 19 496a21–23 32 t1093 20 402a24 33 see “The Amoghapāśahṛdaya-dhāraṇī: the early sanskrit manuscript

into categories, such as the Highest,34 the Great,35and the Mundane and supermundane 36 The text switches between chéngjiù and xīdì, making clear that the two terms are very often interchange-able 37 The text even prescribes specific ritual worship of relics in small shrines for attaining siddhis:38[vajrapāṇi] said to the Buddhha, “World-Honored one, what do we mean by ‘attaining the highest siddhi?’ How does one use these siddhis to attain accomplishments (siddhi)?’ Then the tathāgata said to vajrapāṇi vajrasattva Bodhisattva Mahāsattva, “If there is a bhikṣu, bhikṣūṇi, upāsaka, or upāsikā who has in some small way in a previous life planted the good root of true bodhicitta, even if it is as small as a mustard seed, that person will attain the most exalted siddhi, just like a person who has authentic bodhicitta In accordance with his means he should fashion a gold or copper śarīra-caitya, and in the caitya he should place a Buddha-śarīra With constant effort he should daily use perfumed water and ritually pour water over the śarīra-caitya, and place it on an altar, and set down this scripture, and use various flow-ers and incense to perform pūjā, and receive, uphold, recite, cause to hear, and cause to practice without ceasing, and then he will attain the dharma of the highest siddhi ”some twenty years after this, Śubhakarasiṃha translated the Susid dhi- kara sūtra into Chinese This text, which would come to be regarded as a fundamental scripture for Japanese esoteric tendai, is filled with lists of siddhis of various levels The text features highest, middling, and lower siddhis, and subdivides each of these levels with further dis-tinctions Here is a list of the highest:3934 令 諸有情思惟讀誦受持斯法，皆得最上成就，一切功德勝法。 “This will cause sentient beings to contemplate, recite, and retain his dharma, and he will attain the highest siddhi, all the qualities, and the wondrous dharmas” (t1092 20 234a29-b2) 35 證 三相者名大成就。 “Realizing the Three Marks is called

siddhi This is the rite of the supermun-dane and mundane siddhi of the mantras in the Great sūtrānta” (t1092 20 264b1–3) 37 For example, one passage refers to “attaining the supermundane siddhi,” (成就世間悉地之法; t1092 20 265a28–29), which makes it much more likely that the above passage on attaining the supermundane chéngjiù also refers to siddhi 38 see t1092 20 359b14–24 39 t893a 18 614a25–b1 The

For the Susiddhikarasūtra, the attainment of the five abhijñās is simply one element in a long list of the higher siddhis since the ṛddhis are a subset of the five abhijñās, and the five abhijñās are a subset of the siddhis, we can claim with even more confidence that a simple identification of ṛddhi and siddhi will miss some very important distinctions We see in the Susiddhikarasūtra an effort to

much in common with the examples already provided, for it divides the siddhis into various categories and reserves the highest category for pious Buddhists But the siddhis of the Subāhuparipṛcchā are at the same time more explicitly alchemical and materialistic in their focus, resembling quite closely the sorts of sid-dhis we find in many south Asian tantric communities 41The above examples have shown that in the first quarter of the eighth century, we find a sudden explosion of Chinese translations referring to ranked lists of siddhi, which refer not just to general accomplishments but to specific powers attained through specific rit-ual acts The sudden appearance of the siddhi in China seems to track closely with its abrupt arrival in Indian texts as well The cumulative weight of this evidence leads me to conclude that siddhis did not exist as a discrete category of Buddhist practice before the tantric revolu-tion of the seventh and eighth centuries Concluding thoughtsIn this chapter I have shown that much of our previous scholarship on the siddhis in Buddhism has not properly addressed the question of precisely when and precisely how siddhis first emerged some scholars defined siddhi too broadly, using the word as a general term for ritual attainments This is a fine strategy for doing conceptual or compara-tive work, but it runs the risk of anachronism some scholars defined siddhi to be synonymous with ṛddhi This can lead to interesting com-parative insights, but it also runs the risk of anachronism, of flattening the fragmented and noisy history of Buddhist ideas into a too-tidy package of convenient continuities For both these strategies the ques-tion of when and how Buddhists began using the word siddhi in a nar-rower sense gets swept under the rug

translation for siddhi is an extremely common word, and because Chinese Buddhist transla-tions are so often written in an obscure and difficult-to-decipher ‘translation-ese’, it becomes quite hard to know whether a given pas-sage provides an example of siddhis in particular or of a religious attainment in general This may all seem like so much philological nitpicking, but I believe the results of this modest inquiry are important to consider as schol-ars move forward with their various genealogies and histories of eso-teric religion in south and east Asia By paying close attention to the words people actually used to describe their religious practices, schol-ars can detect unexpected changes in the scenery, and can ask more interesting questions We need not dispute, for example, the fact that the Buddhist tradi-tion incorporated all sorts of telekinetic and telepathic powers under the rubric of ṛddhi from a very early time nor should we dispute the very interesting shared etiology of Buddhist ṛddhi and Patañjali’s sid-dhi Rather than simply conflating the two terms on these grounds, it may be more fruitful to ask whether, and if so, how yogic siddhis and Buddhist ṛddhis relate one to the other Are they both instances of a general south Asian ‘religious substratum’, or did one tradition bor-row from the other?42 If this was a case of borrowing, does the differ-ence in name take on a new significance?none of these questions foreclose further research into the com-parative or phenomenological investigation of religion I think it is important and worthwhile to recognize that between the third and seventh centuries, many Buddhist texts proliferated which urged the performance of spells and other ritual actions, and which promised specific rewards in return Thinking comparatively, and in broad strokes, about these sorts of powers is a most useful exercise Many of these powers would overlap conceptually with the sorts of things that would be called, from the eighth century onward, siddhis However, the dusty details of philological inquiry remain vital if we are to understand more clearly why, starting at the beginning of the 42 on the philosophical and

under the rubric of siddhi 43 Alexis sanderson’s recent work suggests an obvious answer: the Buddhist esoteric texts imported into China in the early years of the eighth century were thoroughly infused with Śaiva language, rituals, and tropes 44If scholars can find no instances of siddhi in Chinese texts prior to the esoteric imports of the early eighth century, we may consider this compelling evidence that the very notion of siddhi is an innovation peculiar to this corpus Rather than conflating siddhis with ṛddhis and treating all supernormal powers as the same sort of practice, we should pay close attention to these moments of importation and appropria-tion In this context, the passage translated above on the highest sid-dhis in the Susiddhikarasūtra becomes more significant By including specifically Buddhist attainments like the five abhijñās and the destruction of the cankers in the list of the ultimate siddhis, we can perhaps see an attempt by the author of the Susiddhikarasūtra to open up new possibilities for a specifically Buddhist form of siddhi practice We could be witnessing not an instance of religious continuity, but rather a vivid example of fragmentation and re-appropriation But we can only conduct this sort of inquiry if we read the texts very closely, and resist the impulse to lump together like with like Words matter, and in the study of south Asian religious traditions through the dark mirror of east Asian texts, words are our most valuable asset In this chapter, I have shown three examples of eighth-century Chinese Buddhist texts which use the term siddhi in a new way I hope this has been a provocative stimulant to further inquiry I would be quite happy if, through the careful examination of all seventy-seven thousand instances of the word chéngjiù in the taishō canon, another scholar finds a striking instance of siddhis in Chinese Buddhism which 43 I cannot help but agree with Alexis sanderson here, who so beautifully wrote, “the training of the textual critic is nothing less than the intimate study of the civili-zation that produced and understood the documents he confronts nor can that study proceed

assumed the guise of traders and offered him boiled sweets, but knowing that they were gods, he rejected it “The gods were very pleased with vajra, their former friend, and gave him the spell for flying through the air (ākāśagāmi) ”9 He uses one of these powers attained through vidyās later when he arrived at Pāṭaliputra “on entering the city, vajra had used his magic powers to diminish his natural appearance, lest it agitate the citizens vajra knew what the citizens were thinking and saying through his excellent powers of perception ”10 The story does not mention that vajra ever used

and discovered that the congregation was suffering from a famine The monks implored him: “Remove us by some means from this ocean of distress It is not sinful to use magic for the benefit of the congregation ” so reverend vajra used his powerful magic spell to create an extensive carpet13... Then, on holy vajra’s instructions, the entire congregation stepped onto the wide carpet... Through the power of the reverend monk vajra’s magic spell, the carpet flew up into the sky, as if it were being wafted up by the wind...

section on karma in which various technical terms are explained some of the powers discussed here are not unique to Jainism, but are, as olle Qvarnström has noted, “a pan-Indian phenomenon absent only in the sarvāstivāda and Mīmāṃsaka schools ”22 In Jainism the terms labdhi and ṛddhi are understood in a broad sense, with certain attainments that are unique to Jainism some may be acquired indi-vidually and others are obtained as a set in conjunction with attaining a special status, such as becoming a Jina or a Cakravartin, or when one attains omniscience (kevala-jñāna) Thus, although the terms super-natural, miraculous, or magical powers are sometimes appropriate, in order to encompass the range of attainments, these terms are best understood in a more general sense, as a capacity that is beyond the ability of most people Śvetāmbaras on the Attainment of LabdhisThe story of vajranābha mentioned above contains the most extensive list of labdhis in Triṣaṣṭiśalākāpuruṣacaritra, and here it states that these attainments arose “by the power of yoga ”23 It is not surprising that Hemacandra attributes their acquisition to yoga, for in the open-ing of his Yogaśāstra, he associates yoga with the attainment of mirac-ulous powers Moreover, the splendour of this “Yogic Dance” [transforms] the [seven] magic powers, phlegm, excrement, secretion, “touch” and “every [part of the body]” into remedies and [develops also] miraculous powers [such as] the acquisition of an undivided sense-organ (saṃbhinnaśrotṛ labdhi) The fortune of the blossoming flowers of the [fabulous]

wiley152extraordinary perception (avadhi) and mind-reading (manaḥ-paryaya) 24 In his commentary on this verse, Hemacandra does not elaborate on the term yoga, but in his translation of this text, olle Qvarnström notes that “in accordance with classical Yoga philosophy, Hemacandra states that yoga, here equivalent to the ‘three jewels’ (YŚH I 15-18), is the cause of liberation (mokṣa) as well as of miraculous powers (sid-dhi/aiśvarya/labdhi) ”25 nevertheless, Hemacandra’s autocommen-tary (YŚVṛ) is informative for several reasons He discusses the attainment of these powers in the context of the story of sanatkumāra, a universal emperor (Cakravartin) who renounced the household life He was afflicted by seven diseases, which included a skin disease that caused itching (kacchū), consumption (śoṣa), fever (jvara), and asthma (śvāsa), for seven hundred years 26 He undertook austerities that are difficult to endure, and although all supernatural powers were acquired by the greatness of his austerities, being indifferent to his body, he did not cure his own diseases two gods came to him and offered to cure him He told them that he would accept their offer if they could cure spiritual diseases (bhāva-roga) in the form of anger (krodha), pride (māna), deceit (māyā) and greed (lobha), which pro-duce endless pain in thousands of births But if they had come to cure bodily diseases (dravya-roga), he told them to look at him, and he lifted his finger, which was oozing from a scab Having smeared it with a drop of his phlegm (kapha), it quickly became golden, like cop-per with mercury They praised him, saying that although he was accomplished in magical powers (siddha-labdhi), he endured the pain of diseases and practiced austerities Here, Hemacandra associates the attainment of supernatural powers with austerities (tapas), but he provides no further details regarding what these austerities entailed, 24 YŚH I 8-9 as translated by Qvarnström, p 20 (kaphavipruṇmalāmarśasarvauṣadhimaharddhayaḥ / sambhinnaśrotolabdhiś ca yaugaṃ tāṇḍavaḍambaram//) Al -though Hemacandra lists five, in a note Qvarnström inserts the word seven and ref-erences the sanatkumāra story mentioned below 25 Qvarnström, YŚH, p 20, note 2 26 The story of sanatkumāra in TṢŚC is similar to the version in the commentary In TṢŚC (Johnson, vol 3, p 194), it says, “Magic powers were acquired by him enduring all the trials hard to endure, indifferent to any expedient for relief The seven magic powers, namely: phlegm (kapha), vipruṣ, dried perspiration (jalla), impurity (mala), excrement (viṣṭā), touch (āmṛśa), and also ‘everything’ (sarva), are called remedies ” Johnson provides a note on the difficulty of translating vipruṣ, jalla, and mala here Cf Śvetāmbara

practiced by Jains today 27 enduring the pain of diseases is one of the twenty-two afflictions (parīṣahas) that mendicants should endure with equanimity 28 sanatkumāra’s refusal to cure his own dis-eases, even though he demonstrated that he had the power to do so, is in accordance with the commentary on this sūtra “He may even pos-sess extraordinary powers to cure acquired by his austerities still he does not utilize these powers to get himself cured, as he has no attach-ment towards the body ”29 In his commentary, Hemacandra defines the five ṛddhis that cure diseases listed at YŚH 1 8 and discusses a number of other supernatural powers For some he mentions the kar-mas whose destruction-cum-suppression (kṣayopaśama) is associated with the attainment these powers Qvarnström also mentions that apart from Hemacandra’s com-mentary, the most extensive list of supernatural powers is found in nemicandra’s Pravacanasāroddhāra 30 After listing twenty-eight lab-dhis, nemicandra states that “the soul acquires these labdhis by par-ticular transformations (pariṇāma) and by the power of specific austerities ”31 Although siddhasenasūri defines these labdhis in his commentary, he does not spell out the nature of the austerities under-taken to attain them nor does he give any details regarding karmic processes associated with their attainment He merely states, “from the power of extraordinary austerities (asādhāraṇa-tapas) and from the power of auspicious, more auspicious, and most auspicious trans-formations (śubha, śubhatara, śubhatama pariṇāma) of the soul, there are various types of attainments (labdhis) or special powers (ṛddhis) ”32 27 YŚvṛ 1 8 48 49, TS 9 19, as translated by nathmal tatia, trans , Tattvārtha Sūtra: That Which Is (London: Harper Collins, 1994), 232, lists six external austeri-ties, four of which are associated with food: fasting, decreasing the amount of food consumed, restricting the varieties of food consumed, and giving up stimulating food In earlier times, two additional external austerities were permitted for ascetics: meditating and practicing austerities in a solitary place, and mortification of the body by assuming various positions or by residing under a tree or in the open where the ascetic is subject to heat and cold TS 9 20 lists the six internal austerities: pen-ances for the transgression of vows (prāyaścitta), reverence for the teachings and teachers (vinaya), service to senior and sick ascetics (vaiyāvṛttya), study of the scrip-tures (svādhyāya), renunciation of attachment and passions

Paul Dundas has observed, bears a striking similarity to a shorter list in the Aupapātika Sūtra (AuSū) 33 In the description of supernatural powers attained by mendicants in Mahāvīra’s lineage, no details are given regarding the variety of karma associated with the acquisition of a specific labdhi nor does Abhayadevasūri comment on this 34 In the Hindi comments on this text, it states that “these labdhis are manifested in the form of a power (śakti) in the soul when there is disassociation (nirjarā) of a specific type of karma by means of undertaking specific types of austerities ”35 The editors also observe that the labdhis are effective only when the ascetic wishes and resolves to use them for the benefit of others, and they quote from the Āvaśyaka Cūrṇi “a śramaṇa (men-dicant) endowed with āmarṣauṣadhi can cure a person or himself by his touch only when he resolves, ‘I wish to cure him’ As long as he does not resolve thus, this power does not become effective as a cure ” They also note, “however, in many scriptures there are mentions of instances where the smell or touch of excreta of some accomplished ascetics naturally cure many diseases ”36 However, in the account of the attainment of supernatural powers by a brahmanical renunciant (parivrājaka) named Ambaḍa,37 there is mention of certain karmas Ambaḍa, along with his followers, retained their traditional non-Jain ascetic garb but paid homage to Mahāvīra and followed the conduct of Jain mendicants, undertaking the fast until death (sallekhanā) when food and water could not be obtained in the proper manner Prior to this, Ambaḍa had undertaken severe bodily austerities, sitting on the scorching earth under the hot sun, and observing a series of two-day fasts, which caused auspicious transformations (śubha pariṇāma) of the soul with a purity that is associated with excellent determination (adhyavasāya) and auspicious leśyās 38 At that time there was the kṣayopaśama of karmas that obstruct the attainments (labdhi) of power (vīrya), the power of transformation of the body (vaikriya), and clairvoyance (avadhi-jñāna) 33 Dundas, “Becoming Gautama,” 41 34 Ausū 15 (p 96) = Bothara,

labdhi, which Pūjyapāda defines as the attainment of supernatural powers by special austerities by humans and animals, and it arises naturally for those whose body for-mation occurs spontaneously upon descent (aupapātika), namely hell-beings and heavenly beings Likewise, the fiery body (taijasa-śarīra) that is used to emit hot rays (tejo-leśyā) to burn one’s enemies is formed by someone who has attained this power 39 The transloca-tional body (āhāraka-śarīra) is also created by a mendicant who knows the fourteen Pūrvas and who has attained this labdhi However, the most extensive treatment of supernatural powers in Śvetāmbara commentaries is in the context of TS 10 7, which discusses various aspects of liberated souls (siddhas) In his commentary, umāsvāti lists some thirty-six labdhis and states that they may be attained by prac-ticing either of the first two stages of pure or white meditation (śukla dhyāna) In discussing the path of purification of the soul, he states that “the soul gradually rids itself of the types of mournful and wrath-ful meditation and acquires the power of analytical meditation (dharma dhyāna) It reaches the first two stages of white meditation [sometimes] leading to the acquisition of supernatural powers ” Although the commentary does not discuss who may attain the lab-dhis mentioned here, it is apparent that śukla dhyāna alone is not the cause of their attainment, because if this were the case, then all liber-ated souls (siddhas) would have attained them However, in this same sūtra, in which liberated souls are examined from different perspec-tives, with respect to knowledge, prior to attaining kevala-jñāna, a soul may have two, three, or four varieties of knowledge in combina-tion, and with respect to relative numerical strength (alpabahutva), more attain three types of knowledge (mati, śruta, and avadhi) than four types (additionally, mind reading, manaḥ-paryaya) 40 The Āvaśyaka Niryukti and the Viśeṣāvaśyakabhāṣya do not give any specifics regarding karma and the acquisition of labdhis, but state that they arise from destruction (kṣaya) and destruction-cum-sup-pression (kṣayopaśama) of karma They list seventeen labdhis, and the Viśeṣāvaśyakabhāṣya mentions that some think there are twenty, and 39 TS 2 47-48 = SS 2 46) For a discussion on different views regarding the fiery body, see

list of who may acquire various labdhis, which is similar to that found in the Pravacanasāroddhāra In his commentary on the Sthānāṅga Sūtra, which lists five types of persons who are endowed with ṛddhis, Arhats, Cakravartins, Balade-vas, vāsudevas, and purified ascetics (bhāvitātmā anagāra), Abhaya-devasūri defines ṛddhi as something that is abundant or plentiful (pracurā), or praiseworthy, commendable, or auspicious (pra śastā), and someone who is endowed with ṛddhis is one who is pre-eminent or has superhuman qualities (atiśāyas) After listing twenty-eight attainments, and briefly defining two of them, he quotes from an unidentified source: “labdhis are transformations of the soul (jīva) There are many varieties that are produced from the rise (udaya), destruction (kṣaya), destruction-cum-suppression (kṣayopa śama), and suppression (upaśama) [of karma] ”42 Digambaras on the Attainment of Ṛddhis A series benedictory verses (maṅgala-sūtras) paying homage to the spiritual victors (Jinas) and to the spiritual victors who have attained various supernatural powers (ṛddhis) is found at the beginning of the Vargaṇā-khaṇḍa, the fourth khaṇḍa of the Ṣaṭkhaṇḍāgama “scripture

source, but they may have been referring to a manu-script of this name at the Bhandarkar oriental Research Institute, from which Jhavery, in his Comparative Study of Mantrasāstra has reproduced the Gaṇadharavalaya Mantra, which opens with the same sūtras and contains a similar list of ṛddhis As appropriate, it con-cludes with an homage to all the ṛddhis and to the circle of the blessed gaṇadharas, while the verses in the Ṣaṭkhaṇḍāgama conclude with an homage to liberated souls (siddhas) and to the enlightened sages (buddha-ṛṣis) or lineage of mendicant leaders (ācārya paramparā) Although the similarity between the two is indeed striking, Kapadia questions whether this is a manuscript of the same work as that attrib-uted to Dharasena because it says that it was composed by Panhapra-vaṇa Muni 50 The association between the gaṇadharas and ṛddhis is also found in the Trilokaprajñapti, where a list of the ṛddhis immediately follows the names of chief gaṇadharas of the twenty-four tīrthaṅkaras of our current descending cycle of time (avasarpiṇī) Here it states that all the gaṇadharas are endowed with eight [main] ṛddhis In Digambara sources the Trilokaprajñapti and the Dhavalā commentary contain the most detailed discussions regarding their acquisition In both of these texts, the efficient cause (nimitta-kāraṇa) most often mentioned is austerities (tapas), and on occasion this is specifically defined as fasting (upavāsa) As would be expected in a commentary on a text that discusses the intricacies of Jain karma theory, the Dhavalā con-tains information about karmas associated with the attainment of some of the ṛddhis, and there is mention of them in the Trilokaprajñapti as well The Cāritrasāra of Cāmuṇḍarāya (tenth century) appears to be derived from the Trilokaprajñapti and contains no additional information on the attainment of ṛddhis Digambara sources also associate the attainment of supernatural powers with meditation Śubhacandra, the author of the Jñānārṇava, (ca late eighth or early ninth century), discusses various aspects of righteous meditation (dharma dhyāna), including the proper places prabandha, v 115-127) about Rudradevasūri teaching the Yoniprābhṛta to his pupil and a fisherman overheard the portion dealing with the generation of fish When the ācārya came to know that the fisherman was using this power, he dissuaded him from using it (p 93) The Prabhāvakacaritra is a Śvetāmbara text by Prabhācandra, revised by Pradyumnasūri (1277 ce), which is considered to be a continuation of Hemacandra’s

unnecessary pain and uneasiness Moreover the processes of breath-control lead to the acquisition of various supernatural powers which are detrimental to the spiritual well-being ”51 Thus, there is an

or happy things in the three times (past, present, future) 2) by signs of the earth (bhauma): thinking about the qualities of the earth, such as its denseness, hollowness, smoothness, roughness; having seen the increase or decrease of minerals, such as copper, iron, gold, and silver, one knows whether there will be victory or defeat 3) by limbs (aṅga): observing the appearance, touch, and the

Śvetāmbaras and Digambaras on Powers of Movement through the Air (p 176) 17 prajñāśramaṇa A power of the intellect associated with wisdom regarding the proper conduct of a śramaṇa Prajñā is defined as the power of the soul associated with knowledge that is not dependent on the instruction of gurus (Dh) He knows all the sacred knowledge associated with the most subtle of subjects in the fourteen Pūrvas just by studying them without [the assistance of] a great sage, and there is an appearance [of conduct] associated with restraint According to Dh, this type of wisdom arises on account of emaciation from a six-month fast It may arise spontaneously, from memory of restraint of conduct in past lives (autpattikī), and it may come about from the kṣayopaśama of karmas that arise naturally (pāriṇāmikī) in accor-dance with one’s own specific state of birth (jāti) It may arise from restraint associated with knowledge of the twelve Aṅgas (vainayikī), and it may become manifest without instruction, being obtained from a specific type of austerity (karmajā) {śrutajñānāvaraṇa and vīryānta-rāya karmas} (Dh) TP adds: 1) pratyekabuddhitva: a power of the intellect that arises without instruction of gurus, from the suppression (upaśama) of kar-mas, in which there is spiritual progress, especially in attaining a proper view of reality (samyaktva) and in performing austerities (TP

There are two kinds 1) ugra-ugra: Having begun with the fast at the time of ini-tiation, increasing the fasts, adding an additional day, one by one This pattern of increased fasting continues until one has fasted to death (TP) There is one day of fasting, one day of eating (pāraṇa); two days fasting, one day of eating; three days of fasting, one day eating; four days of fasting, one day of eating; for a total of fourteen days in which there are ten days of fasting and four days of eating (Dh) 2) avasthita-ugra tapas. A one-day fast is undertaken at the time of initiation, and then the fast is broken Then one undertakes a two day fast, then a three day fast, then a four day fast, then a five day fast, and so forth, and one continues to increase the length of fasts while maintaining clear consciousness These fasts are possible due to strongest kṣayo pa-śama of vīryāntarāya karma (TP) The difference between these two fasts is that the latter has a limit of six months A muni who has a life-span that can be reduced (sopakrama-āyu) must undertake this type of fast, not the other, and although he suffers afflictions, he remains in good health A muni who has a life-span that cannot be reduced (nirupakrama-āyu) does not experience afflictions This power is associated with kṣayopaśama of vīryāntarāya karma, which is attained from the power of austerities, and the rise (udaya) of asātā-vedanīya karma that is of mild intensity (Dh)22 dīpta-tapas By means of many types of fasts of the strongest of sages in mind, speech, and body, there is an increase in the visibility of the rays of the body, equal to that of the sun (TP) Having undertaken various fasts, a one day fast, a two day fast, etc , there is a progressive increase in the lustre of the body, which is like the increase in the lus-tre of the moon each day during the bright half of the month An increase in the lustre of the body is not possible without an increase in the strength of the body This increase is not caused by food because there is an absence of a cause for this Also, such a person does not eat"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"supernatural powers & their attainment in jainism173in order to pacify suffering associated with hunger because there is a absence of this type of suffering (Dh)23 tapta-tapas Food of four types67 that has been eaten by the sage is reduced to its elements without its being transforming into urine and excrement (also, semen, Dh), like water that evaporates in a heated iron vessel It arises from dhyāna (meditation, concentration) 24 mahā-tapas A muni with four types of samyak-jñāna (mati, śruta, avadhi, and manaḥ-paryaya) who performs all the great fasts (TP) Munis who perform the half-month fast, month-long fast, and the year-long fast It is called this because at the conclusion of the year-long fast, kevala-jñāna may arise, but this is not always the case (RV) vīrasena has a totally different explanation This term applies to a muni who is endowed with eight types of change of form, of becoming minute, etc ;

Movement through the Air Without a doubt, the subject of traveling through the air by supernat-ural means was of interest as seen by the details provided in discus-sions of this attainment in narratives, in Śvetāmbara canonical texts, and in commentaries of both sectarian traditions In comparing accounts in Śvetāmbara canonical texts and their commentaries and in TṢŚC on the one hand with the explanations provided in Digambara texts and by Hemacandra in his commentary to YŚH on the other, a pattern emerges that is indicative of the aspects of this travel that are of interest In Śvetāmbara canonical texts, there are two types of cāraṇa: jaṅghā-cāraṇa, flying through the air using one’s legs (jaṅghā) and vidyā-cāraṇa, flying by means of spells, and these are also described in Hemacandra’s story of vajranābha in TṢŚC Here most of the other labdhis are described in a sentence or two However, the detailed description of travel through the air takes up half of a page:They had the art of flying with their legs (jaṅghā-cāraṇa) by which they were able to reach Rucakadvīpa in one jump Returning from Rucakadvīpa, with one jump they were able to reach nandīśvara, and with a second the place from which they had started When going up in the air, with one jump (utpāta), they could go to the garden Paṇḍaka on Meru’s peak Then turning, they were able to go to nandana with one jump and with a second to the place of the first jump By the art of flying by knowledge (vidyā-cāraṇa) with one jump, they were able to reach Mānuṣottara and with another nandīśvaradvīpa With one jump they were able to arrive at the ground of the first jump They were able to come and go up in the air in the same way as in the Middle World 69 69 J ohnson, TṢŚC, vol 1, p 79 For descriptions of these locations in TṢŚC, see Johnson, vol 1, pp 391-92, 395-97 nandana is a grove on Mt Meru The move-ments on Mt Meru appear to be from the base to the top of Meru (a distance of 99,000 yojanas);

powers & their attainment in jainism177The origins of this account appear to be the story in the Bhagavatī Sūtra mentioned by Dundas According to the BhSū, jaṅghā-cāraṇa is attained in association with a series of three-day fasts, and a person can, in one jump, reach Rucakadvīpa, or nandīśvara, or the summit of Mt Meru, and return in two jumps Vidyā-cāraṇa is attained in asso-ciation with a two-day fast 70 Abhayadeva comments on vidyā that it arises automatically, on its own, and scriptural knowledge (śruta) of vidyās in the Pūrvagata is the efficient cause of this It is also asso-ciated with observing proper mendicant conduct in collecting alms He states the speed of travel and destinations are the same as jaṅghā-cāraṇa 71 If a monk uses either of them and dies before performing pratikramaṇa, his spiritual progress attained by living in accordance with the mahāvratas will be compromised The description in the commentary to AuSū regarding these two modes of travel is similar to that in BhSū In Hemacandra’s narrative, it is unclear how Indrabhūti Gautama acquired the labdhi of flying like the wind (vāyuvat-cāraṇa-labdhi), which he employed to go to Mount Aṣṭāpada in a moment, because no further details are given here 72 However, as we have seen, in his narrative of the elder vajra, flying was attained from spells (vidyās) In the first instance, it was given to him by ‘Yawning gods’ who had been his friends in his past life 73 In the second, he acquired this spell by himself, through his extraordinary powers of memory, and with that spell he had the power to fly from Rose-apple tree Island (Jambūdvīpa) to the furthest location inhabited by humans (Mānuṣottara) 74What is described in all of these accounts is the speed and the dis-tance traveled in one or two jumps, either sideways (e g , from their location on Jambūdvīpa to Rucakadvīpa) or upwards (e g , to the sum-mit of Mt Meru) 70 J ohnson (TṢŚC, vol 1, p 79, note 114) gives a description of these: jaṅghā-cāraṇa: “He goes to Rucakavaradvīpa or to the top of Meru in one jump, but he requires two for the return in both cases because his power diminishes from negli-gence arising from zeal for practicing his art, with the resultant decrease in time devoted to penance by which he acquired the art ” vidyā-cāraṇa: “He goes to Mānuṣottara in one jump and arrives at nandīśvara with the second, worships the shrines, and returns in one jump It takes two jumps to reach the top of Meru, and only one to return This is because learning becomes stronger with practice ” 71 BhSū 20 9 (pp 304-5) see

śreṇi-cāraṇa: going in the sky as far as the lines of residences (śreṇi) of the vidyādharas 75 3) agni-śikhā-cāraṇa: going upward on flames of fire 4) jala-cāraṇa: going on water without touching it

kriyā and defines ākāśa-gāmitva in the same way as Akalaṅka He says that there are many types of cāraṇa and lists twelve of them: jala, jaṅghā, phala, puṣpa, patra, agni-śikhā, dhūma, megha, [jala]dhārā, makaḍī-tantu, jyotiś, and māruta As in RV, he defines jaṅghā-cāraṇa as going four fingers 75 ‘vidyādhara-śreṇi-paryanta-ākāśa-gamanam ’ The word anuśreṇi at TS 2 27 (= SS 2 26) describes

varieties of cāraṇa: jala, jaṅghā, tantu, phala, puṣpa, bīja, ākāśa, and śreṇi, and that although these objects are used as a support for travel, they are not harmed (literally, there is no removal of their happiness) He defines jaṅghā-cāraṇa as going hun-dreds of yojanas without harming earth-bodied beings on the earth and that tantu, phala, puṣpa, bīja, and jala are to be understood in this same manner He interprets śreṇi-cāraṇa as being endowed with the power of rising up and moving above smoke, fire, mountains, trees, and so forth 76 He distinguishes cāraṇa from prākāmya ṛddhi, which he defines as the power of entering with the body solid earth, moun-tains, or the ocean, or inside of buildings, emphasizing again that those who travel by cāraṇa ṛddhi do not harm other living beings Thus, in both the TP and Dh, there is no mention of force of jumping or the distance traveled, except for defining the limit of travel as 76 Here, too, the translation is difficult I believe he is using śreṇi as a vertical measurement of space occupied by the things mentioned This would mean a series of vertical lines of space-points that extend upwards for different distances that define the

In his translation of the Yogaśāstra, olle Qvarnström notes that in his commentary Hemacandra mentions a variety of cāraṇas, and refers the reader to AuSū and BhSū These references are appropriate for the first part of the lengthy passage, for Hemacandra says that there are two types of cāraṇa: jaṅghā-caraṇa, flying through the air using one’s legs (jaṅghā) and vidyā-cāraṇa, flying by means of spells, and his description closely follows BhSū Following this, he adds, “but in another (anye) there are many types of cāraṇa, for example, ākāśagāmi,” and the wording that follows is identical to that of Akalaṅka He then says, “in some others,” and lists fourteen items as means of support for traveling through the sky Although umāsvāti mentions using various substances as support in his definition of jaṅghā-cāraṇa, the definition for this term in Hemacandra’s com-mentary matches that in RV and TP, not that of umāsvāti The detailed description that follows, some fifteen lines in length, does not match any of the above-mentioned Digambara sources However, the point being made here for each of the items that he describes is the same as that in the Digambara texts, namely, that the various substances used as support when flying through the sky are not harmed thereby Thus, Hemacandra was aware of concepts regarding travel through the air, especially the aspect of ahiṃsā, as found in Digambara sources, and devoted more attention to them in his commentary than he did for the explanations found in Śvetāmbara canonical commentaries However, he did not incorporate these

Women do not possess it Thus, even though women are incapable of these pow-ers that are produced through excellence in knowledge, conduct, and austerities, this does not mean that they are incapable of mokṣa Mokṣa is not dependent on these alone ”80 From these sources, it appears that there was a difference of opinion regarding women and mind reading between this Yāpanīya author and some Śvetāmbara ācāryas Also, these Śvetāmbara lists agree with the Yāpanīya’s claim that women are incapable of traveling through the air (cāraṇa), but none of them mention the transformational body (vaikriya-śarīra) If this was to be denied, one would have expected a mention of it since they specifically deny the attainment of the translocational body (āhāraka-śarīra) for bhavya women Cycle of TimeIn discussing who can attain these powers, the cycle of time needs to be considered because some of these labdhis cannot be acquired by anyone living at this time in our location of the universe It is thought that in certain parts of the occupied universe, including the area where we live (Bharata-kṣetra), time is cyclical and living conditions gradu-ally improve and decline Like tīrthaṅkaras, other illustrious people (e g , Cakravartins, Baladevas, vāsudevas) are born only at certain periods in these cycles In the regressive half of the cycle (ava sarpiṇī), they are born at the end of the third and during the fourth period We are currently in the unhappy (duṣamā) or fifth period of the avasarpiṇī, which began less than three years after the death of Mahāvīra, and people currently do not have the requisite willpower (vīrya) to refrain from harmful conduct and attain the requisite purity of the soul associated with the attainment of certain labdhis The last person who attained the status of a kevalin was Ācārya Jambū, who attained mokṣa sixty-four years after the nirvāṇa of Mahāvīra Because the soul is unable to ascend the ladders of purification (śreṇi) culmi-80

Digambaras also believe that knowledge of much of the Pūrvas has been lost Ac cording to Śvetambaras, after the time of Jambū, it is impossible to attain simple and complex mind reading (manaḥ-paryaya

In looking over the lists in Śvetāmbara and Digambara sources, cer-tain patterns emerge The ordering of the list in the Ṣaṭkhaṇḍāgama, which appears to have set the pattern for lists found in subsequent Digambara texts, is in approximate order of spiritual status because this is a maṅgala-sūtra Here, those who have ṛddhis associated with intellect are mentioned first while those with healing powers and pow-ers of transformation of foods, etc , are mentioned last Although the ordering of powers in the Śvetāmbara sūrimantra is not identical with the Digambara lists, it does place the three avadhis first, followed by bīja- and koṣṭha-buddhi, padanusāri, and saṃbhinnaśrotṛ The lists in the Śvetāmbara canonical texts and commentaries and in the Triṣaṣ ṭi-śa lākāpuruṣacaritra are in the context of narratives, and here the pow-ers of healing are emphasized As mentioned earlier, Digambara sources have a fixed order for the seven or eight main ṛddhis, while Śvetāmbara sources do not follow this pattern In looking at these lists, it would be reasonable to assume that one of the main categories, tapas, is not found in Śvetāmbara sources However, this is not the case, for ugra-tapas and dīpta-tapas are found in some versions of the sūrimantra 82 Given the emphasis on fasting in Jainism, the acquisi-tion of these powers is important to mendicants, but it may be the case that lay people are motivated to become followers of munis who dem-onstrate powers that are of direct benefit to them, such as curing dis-eases and providing unlimited quantities of food Thus, one

of flying by the power of spells (vidyā-cāraṇa) in his commentary on śukla dhyāna Another pattern that emerges is the categories of labdhis for which karmas are discussed In both Śvetāmbara and Digambara sourc-es, karmas are mentioned in the context of powers of the intellect, of extraordinary visual perception, and of mind reading (avadhi-jñāna and manaḥ-paryaya) The cause for their attainment is the kṣayopaśama of the āvaraṇa karmas that obstruct one of these ca-pacities in the soul Antarāya karmas are associated with the power of the ‘unfailing kitchen’ (akṣīṇa-mahānasī) and with the energy or power (vīrya) of the body, speech, and mind These are logical as-sumptions on the part of anyone with a working knowledge of Jain karma theory There would have been no need to comment on the formation of the transformational (vaikriya) body or the translo-cational (āhāraka) body because it is known that they are formed and maintained by the operation of vaikriya-śarīra-nāma karma and āhāraka-śarīra-nāma karma, respectively With the attainment of these labdhis, these karmas are bound with the soul and become operative, or, if they had been previously bound, they are forced to come to fruition and produce their effects What is lacking, however, is any explanation regarding karmic processes associated with the powers of healing While one might expect that not all of the commentators were well-versed in this tech-nical aspect of Jainism, even vīrasena, who without a doubt under-stood the intricacies of Jain karma theory and was commenting on a text dealing with karma, is silent on this subject From the descrip-tions, some of these powers appear to be associated with the ability to manipulate or transform gross physical matter For example, heal-ing by bodily impurities could be understood as the transformation (pariṇāma) of these substances, causing them to lose modes (paryaya or bhāva) that are characteristic of matter that is polluting and take on modes that are characteristic of matter that is healing The change of smell is explicitly mentioned, and this entails the transformation of the smell quality of matter (gandha) from a mode that is unpleasant to a mode that is pleasant This transformation of gross physical mat-ter would be similar to the transformation of karmic matter through the karaṇas, or processes of energy Here, through a karaṇa called saṃkramaṇa the energy quality of the soul transforms previously bound inauspicious varieties of karmic matter (aśubha-prakṛtis) into"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"kristi wiley186corresponding auspicious varieties (śubha-prakṛtis) that are binding And the soul is capable of increasing and decreasing the intensity of the effects of specific varieties of karmic matter If this is the case with certain types of healing, then the power to transform gross mat-ter would be associated with kṣayopaśama of vīrya-antarāya karma, which obstructs the energy quality of the soul However, the karaṇas are described as powers that bring about changes in previously bound karmic matter, not in grosser forms of matter The reasons for this silence are impossible to determine but are curious, given the level of detail regarding the workings of karma found in the Dhavalā In this regard, there is a similarity with mantras Paul Dundas has mentioned, “there is in fact no unitary view expressed concerning the manner in which the sūrimantra effects its results ”83 Given the restrictions on who could have knowledge of the Pūrvas, which are purported to have contained information on a number of these lab-dhis and vidyās, and the warnings that these powers can be detrimen-tal to spiritual progress, it is reasonable to assume that ācāryas were selective regarding the teaching of this material and were hesitant to commit details regarding these powers to writing As with mantras, the attainment of these powers is one of the more esoteric aspects of Jainism notes on KarmaBondage of the soul (jīva) in the cycle of death and rebirth (saṃsāra) is the result of a series of mechanical processes, including the attrac-tion (āsrava) and bondage (bandha) of karma In Jainism, karma is not a mental trace or impression but an extremely subtle form of mat-ter Actions of the body, speech, and mind cause vibrations of the soul (yoga), which attract karmic matter to the soul It remains bound with the soul for a specific period of time whenever actions are motivated by passions (kaṣāyas) It then comes to fruition and rises (udaya), producing its effects, and then is disassociated from the soul (nirjarā) Liberation is attained by preventing the influx of new karma and by removing all previously bound karma from the soul There are eight main varieties (prakṛtis) of karmic matter and numerous sub-varieties, each of which produces a specific effect some varieties affect qualities (guṇas) of the soul and others determine the 83 Dundas, “Becoming Gautama,” 44"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"supernatural powers & their attainment in jainism187soul’s destiny in the next life, causing rebirth and embodiment as a human, heavenly being (deva), hell-being (nāraki), animal, or a form of vegetable life of the eight main varieties, the most significant are the mohaṇīya karmas, which cause delusion (moha) regarding the nature of reality (samyak-darśana) They also generate passions (kaṣāyas) and prevent one from observing proper conduct (samyak-cāritra) Another aspect of karma is the intensity of its effect (anubhā ga) It is the degree of intensity of the mohaṇīya karmas that determines the level of spiritual purity of the soul (guṇasthāna) Thus, although not explicitly mentioned, reducing the effects of the moha-nīya karmas are an underlying factor in the attainment of labdhis Reducing the influx of new karmic matter involves restraint in con-duct, especially refraining from harming other living beings (ahiṃsā) and limiting one’s acquisitions (aparigraha) In addition to this, one needs to reduce the effects of karmic matter that has been previously bound with the soul This is accomplished by processes of energy (kara ṇas), which influence or alter the unrelenting rise of karma There are three processes of energy mentioned in association with the attainment of labdhis: destruction-cum-suppression (kṣayopaśama), destruction (kṣaya), and suppression (upaśama) Inherent in souls are qualities that are unique to it and thus distin-guish it from all other substances These include sentientness or awareness in the form of perception (darśana) and knowledge (jñāna) as well as energy (vīrya) If unobstructed by karma, these qualities would be infinite But prior to attaining omniscience, the perception and knowledge qualities are obscured by the āvaraṇa karmas and the energy quality by antarāya karmas However, they are not totally obscured, for all embodied souls, even the most rudimentary life-forms, have the requisite energy to continuously perform one of these processes, kṣayopaśama, or ‘destruction-cum-suppression’ This pro-cess has been described as “some portion of karma is destroyed and some is held in abeyance” or “some portion of karmic matter is held up, and some portion is exhausted by fruition, while some is in rise ”84 The energy quality of the soul can be stimulated to produce this same effect in greater degrees of intensity through various ascetic practices It is this process of energy that is most frequently mentioned in the 84 t G Kalghatgi, Karma and Rebirth (Ahmedabad: L D Institute of Indology, 1972), 72 and tatia, Studies in Jaina Philosophy, 258 see also P s Jaini, Jaina Path, 142"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"kristi wiley188acquisition of labdhis Thus, the commentators associate a very strong or a maximum degree of kṣayopaśama of a specific variety of karmic matter with the attainment of a specific labdhi Also associated with ascetic practices is the destruction (kṣaya) of karmic matter This pro-cess of energy forces karmas to come to fruition prematurely (udīrana), producing their effects in a short period of time in lesser degree of intensity, sometimes at a level that is virtually imperceptible The other term that is mentioned is suppression (upaśama) Here, karmic matter is not destroyed but suppressed from rising and pro-ducing its effects for a short period of time It is by the suppression of mohanīya karmas that a proper view of reality (samyak-darśana) is first attained and it is by the destruction of mohanīya and other harm-ful karmas that omniscience (kevala-jñāna) and liberation (mokṣa) is attained, in which the soul experiences infinite consciousness, energy, and bliss It is through these processes of energy that perception or undiffer-entiated cognition (darśana), ascertaining the general nature of an object, and knowledge (jñāna), or ascertaining the specifics about an object, are increased in scope by reducing the intensity of the karmic matter that obscures them Most of the karmas mentioned in associa-tion with the labdhis are those that affect darśana and jñāna and the energy quality of soul (vīrya) since most commentators understand that darśana and jñāna operate sequentially, only jñāna will be dis-cussed mati-jñāna is empirical knowledge acquired through the sense organs (indriyas) and the mind (manas), which is classified as a quasi-sense organ (anindriya or no-indriya) This knowledge can arise from the senses alone, the mind alone, or both acting together Mati-jñānāvaraṇa karma partially obscures this quality in the soul A spe-cific sub-variety of mati-jñāna obscure knowledge transmitted from one of the sense organs A five-sensed rational being acquires knowl-edge via all of

by interpreting signs (words, writ-ing, gestures) and “it arises in the wake of empirical knowledge ” It also refers to scriptural knowledge, or knowledge of all of the sacred literature

all-encompassing It extends to all substances in all their modes, including the past, present and future ” unlike the other types of knowledge, until omniscience is attained through kṣaya of all kevala-jñānāvaraṇa karma, it remains totally obscured In other words, there are no degrees or levels of omniscient knowledge as there are with the other four types 89 There are five sub-varieties of antarāya karmas that obstruct or hinder the energy (vīrya) quality of the soul The one mentioned here is vīrya-antarāya, which hinders physical energy or power, mental powers and concentration, as

different nāma karmas that cause the forma-tion of different types of bodies In this case, the labdhis are attained through the rise (udaya) of these karmas unlike the karmas discussed above, they do

cat-egory of ‘yoga’ encompasses a wide spectrum, spanning over two mil-lennia and traversing the globe Yoga has become a touchstone for our contemporary cosmopolitan and globalized civilization, a symbol of cultural universality in the multicultural social reality we live in Contemporary representations of yoga have intriguing genealogical relationships with their historical precursors, demonstrating continu-ity and discontinuity, and the tension between conservative tradition and innovative adaptation Broadly speaking, contemporary forms of yoga reflect many of the dynamics of modernity itself, and suggest ways in which living traditions manage to remain coherent in the face of rapid change This in turn provides insights into how yoga has his-torically been adapted to fit different worldviews and modes of reli-gious expression through practice In this essay, we will introduce the concept of ‘yoga’ as it is formulated in the tradition of Pātañjala yoga or ‘classical’ yoga, as codified in Patañjali’s Yogasūtra (3-5c ce), in order to demonstrate how the practice of yoga can be understood as a means of obtaining occult power and other ‘worldly’ goods as much as it serves spiritual purposes In particular, we will examine the nature of the eight-limbed yoga (aṣṭāṅgayoga) and the relationship between the goals of liberation (kaivalya) and of worldly power or accomplish-ment (vibhūti, siddhi) that result from its practice We will examine key passages from the Yogasūtra (YS) in order to develop a nuanced understanding of how yoga powers are conceptualized by Patañjali, with reference to the interpretations of these passages in the discourse (śāstra) on yoga found in commentarial literature Having established a foundational understanding of the nature and meaning of the pow-ers within the yogaśāstra, we will then turn to a range of theories of"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"stuart ray sarbacker196interpretation that converge with and diverge from traditional accounts and interpretations, with the goal of illuminating a broad range of options What will ultimately be argued is that an approach that acknowledges and integrates a plurality of possible interpreta-tions of such powers is by far the most satisfactory option for under-standing the role, meaning, and purpose of these powers It will be shown how this multifaceted approach is eminently useful for under-standing the range of yoga powers represented in the Yogasūtra and for gaining perspective on modern and contemporary yoga practices and the representations of power that are found within them What is Yoga?‘Yoga’ is a term derived from the sanskrit root √yuj, which means ‘to yoke’ By extension, this ‘yoking’, and thus ‘yoga’, refers in a primary sense to the ‘yoking’ of mental and physical faculties in the ascetic tra-ditions of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism The term ‘yoga’ also is given a more technical meaning by some of the Indian commentators, specifically the notion of yoga as a form of, or identical to, a medita-tive form of concentration 1 The broader sense of yoga is, for our pur-poses, more satisfactory, in that it is an inclusive definition that is consistent with a wider spectrum of native definitions and a broader range of historical and literary data Many of the earliest references to yoga in the Indian literature postulate a generic interpretation that suggests that yoga is a type of spiritual ‘discipline’, often tied to the ‘yoking’ of the senses or other mental or physical capacities 2 Yoga is also referred to as ‘union’—i e yoking as unifying—in various con-texts, referring in this respect to the goal of union with a deity, supreme self, or being 3 one of the most formative paradigms that expresses the nature of yoga is the conception of the aṣṭāṅgayoga or ‘eight limbed yoga’ system that is articulated in the Yogasūtra of Patañjali, a text 1 Gerald James Larson and Ram shankar Bhattacharya, Yoga: India’s Philosophy of Meditation, encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies volume XII (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 2008), 28-29 2 see, for example, Kaṭha Upaniṣad 4 11 3 The concept of ‘yoking’ as rooted in Indian literature has been explored at length by David Gordon White in his Sinister Yogis (Chicago: university of Chicago Press, 2009), especially 83-166 Multiple definitions of yoga are also examined in somadeva

is a key part of the Hindu philosophical tradition The aṣṭāṅgayoga system articulates a vision of yoga as a set of disciplines of behavior, body, and mind, in which a practitioner gains progressive control and mastery over their psychophysical makeup The mastery of the human organism in the aṣṭāṅgayoga system begins with behavioral control—formally referred to as yama and niyama, ‘restraint’ and ‘observance’ The category of yama prescribes ethical norms, namely ahiṃsā (non-harm), satya (truth fulness), asteya (non-stealing), brahmacarya (sex-ual restraint), and aparigraha (non-greed) The category of niyama includes the prescriptions of śauca (cleanliness), saṃtoṣa (content-ment), tapas (asceticism), svādhyāya (recitation), and īśvara pra-ṇidhāna (dedication to the ‘Lord’ or ‘Master’ of yoga) The succeeding limbs deal particularly with the physical and psychic dimensions of embodiment The limbs of āsana (posture) and prāṇāyāma (breath control) work with the body and its energies; they culminate in pratyāhāra (withdrawal), which is a drawing in or an introversion of the senses away from their objects These first five limbs are referred to as the ‘outer limbs’ (bahiraṅga), as opposed to the following three, which are the ‘inner limbs’ (antaraṅga), namely dhāraṇā (fixation), dhyāna (meditation), and samādhi (contem plation) Though not all yoga systems embrace the aṣṭāṅga sequence as their central mode of operation, virtually all systems of yoga utilize terminology and the conceptual frameworks that are cognate with the practices repre-sented in the aṣṭāṅgayoga system one of the dominant paradigms in medieval haṭhayoga traditions, which are the foundation for many of the modern systems of yoga, is that the utilization of āsana and prāṇāyāma in forceful (haṭha means ‘force’) ways can rapidly bring about the arrest of mental fluctuations (or of mind itself), and thus samādhi, whereby the ultimate nature of selfhood is revealed and spir-itual liberation is achieved 4 Likewise, the control of prāṇa through the discipline of prāṇāyāma and other techniques is understood to result in the attainment of various siddhi powers, or magical accom-plishments Another key aspect of yoga that is not explicit in the aṣṭāṅgayoga formu lation is the locus of meaning and teleology of such practices It is this aspect that provides insight into how yoga might be seen as a ‘religious’ enterprise With respect to aṣṭāṅgayoga, as it is articulated in the Yogasūtra, yoga is understood as a practice that is instrumental 4 see, for example Haṭhayogapradīpikā, 2 73-77; 4 1-33"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"stuart ray sarbacker198in achieving liberation (kaivalya) from embodied existence and the misery of continual rebirth Likewise, in the Dhammapada, a forma-tive work of Buddhist literature, in which the historical Buddha, Gotama, articulates his vision of the religious life, yoga is seen as an instrument or method that is necessary in pursuing the peace of nibbāna 5 In the context of key formulations of haṭhayoga, yoga is portrayed as a vehicle for liberation in the form of the dissolution of the mind into the inmost self, and the realization of unity with the foundation of all being, brahman The locus of meaning and teleology of yoga has undoubtedly shifted significantly in the modern and con-temporary eras—yoga in its ‘modern’ forms of practice has a unique set of concerns and values one of the key expressions is that of yoga as a ‘healing’ practice—one that can facilitate the removal of disease and the appropriation of health, or, alternately, the removal of stress and the health benefits of the reduction of stress Yoga as a means to achieve ‘peace’ in a nonsectarian and mundane fashion is part of the picture as well 6 There is an analogy to be drawn with respect to these teleologies, though clearly on a scale of emphasis—the framework of the Indian renouncer traditions is a significantly more pessimistic one, for example—with the ideal of ‘removal’ of the causes of pain or suffering being key It is important to keep in mind that the locus of meaning and the teleology of yoga exists in a dynamic tension between the ‘removal’ paradigm mentioned above and a more affirmative paradigm, in which control over natural forces take precedence over the transcen-dence of them 7 This second paradigm is of yoga as a means to power, especially with respect to the sort of ‘magical’ perfections character-ized by the sanskrit terms siddhi (lit ‘accomplishment’ or ‘perfection’) and vibhūti (lit ‘power’ or ‘manifestation’) This second paradigm is often viewed from within orthodox contemplative traditions as sub-ordinate to the first and potentially as a distraction from or an im -pediment to the removal of worldly affliction This is a position that is clearly articulated in the YS and its commentarial literature This 5 stuart sarbacker, “The numinous and Cessative in Modern Yoga,” in Yoga in the

becomes radically ‘other’—which is an affirmation of the salience of the comparative category of the numinous and a modification of it, as the human has become rad-ically other This transformation is represented in the symbolism of Indian asceticism, such as the association between the practice of yoga and the theriomorphic figure of the nāga, or mythic serpent The qual-ities and capacities characteristic of the numinous extend beyond the identification of the practitioner with a deity to the relationship between a practitioner and the world (and its residents) as well The capacities and the relationships that they engender provide a useful angle for at least one key horizon of meaning with respect to yoga powers The emphasis at this point should be on this fact: disciplining the mind and body through tapas (asceticism) and yoga has been understood in Hindu (and more broadly, Indic) philosophical and narrative literature to result in the attainment of a range of supernor-mal powers of action and knowledge The meaning and purpose of these powers is a subject that is ripe for exploration, and doing so will help bring clarity to the study of yoga theory and practice in its his-torical contexts and in its contemporary permutations Yoga Powers in the Yogasūtra of PatañjaliThe locus classicus for the articulation of the Hindu perspective on yoga and the reputed powers that emerge from its practice is the Yogasūtra of Patañjali The root-text (sūtrapāṭha) in concert with its principal commentary, the Vyāsa Bhāṣya, if not with its larger com-mentarial literature as well, can be referred to as the yogaśāstra or yogānuśāsana 8 This text and commentarial tradition is highly useful in theorizing with respect to the nature and meaning of these powers The term sūtra refers to a ‘thread’, the terse but fundamental nature of an exposition—like the thread that makes up a necklace or rosary (mālā) that is ‘ornamented’ by commentary, or the individual threads 8 This is used here as a more generic expansion of the rubric of the “Pātañjala Yogaśāstra” (PYŚ), which is discussed in Philipp Maas, “‘Descent With Modifica-tion’: The opening of the Pātañjalayogaśāstra,” in Śāstrārambha: Inquiries into the Preamble in Sanskrit, ed Walter slaje (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz verlag, 2008), 97-119 The use of yogānuśāsana as a technical term occurs in

tradition as the author of key treatises on grammar, medicine, and yoga, and also as an avatāra of the Hindu deity Ananta or Ādiśeṣa, a primordial mythic serpent that is strongly associated with the two principal male Hindu gods, viṣṇu and Śiva 9 The text of the YS has 195 verses, 196 in some variations, and is broken down into four sections or ‘feet’ (pāda): samādhipāda, sādhanapāda, vibhūtipāda, and kaivalyapāda, which can be translated as ‘the section on contemplation’, ‘the section on practice’, ‘the section on power’, and ‘the section on liberation’ The yoga system articulated in Patañjali’s work and its commentaries is referred to as the yoga darśana, the ‘yoga viewpoint’, as rājayoga (‘the royal yoga’), and in european and American scholarship as ‘Classical Yoga’ Dated in the neighborhood of between the 3rd to 5th centuries ce, it is roughly contemporaneous with the rise of a major Hindu empire in India (the Gupta empire), and coextensive with a period of resurgence of Hindu thought and culture during that era 10 The YS, and by extension, the yogaśāstra, critiques and integrates Buddhist and Jaina practices and theories into an overarching Hindu metaphysical and philosophical framework, synthesizing if not syncretizing ‘heterodox’ (i e non-Hindu) viewpoints with elements constitutive of Hindu orthodoxy It undoubtedly served as an organizational framework for integrating a diverse range of ascetic and yogic techniques of disparate origins under a cohesive rubric drawn from the sāṃkhya philosophical tradi-tion The YS and the yogaśāstra tradition of yoga has been extremely influential in defining yoga over the course of its history in the two millennia of the common era, being a theoretical and practical touch-stone for many of the later branches of yoga The vast and generation-spanning commentarial literature and the prevalence of the yogaśāstra paradigm (especially aṣṭāṅgayoga) in the Purāṇa and Yoga upaniṣad literature are key examples of its broad influence as a systematic pre-sentation of yoga in theory and in practice 11 one particularly influen-9 Larson, Yoga: India’s Philosophy of Meditation, 54-67 10 For a discussion of the

yogasūtra of patañjali 201tial aspect of the yogaśāstra tradition, as was mentioned above, has been the conception of an eight-limbed yoga (aṣṭāṅgayoga), which represents components of the practice of yoga as a series of steps that bring order to yogic discipline The practice as thus represented moves from the social sphere towards a progressively subtler inner and per-sonal sphere It begins with moral prescriptions, moves to observances such as cleanliness and self-discipline, to the taking up of posture and breath control, and lastly into introversion and the cultivation of con-centration and ultimately contemplative absorption The power of the deep meditative or contemplative focusing of the mind (samādhi) as exemplified in yogic ‘mastery’ (saṃyama) is understood to be the basis for obtaining liberation or ‘separation’ (kaivalya) and for devel-oping supernormal powers and abilities (siddhi or vibhūti) With respect to the obtaining of siddhi or spiritual ‘accomplishment’ or ‘perfection’, Patañjali notes in Ys 4 1, janmoṣadhimantratapaḥ-samādhijāḥ siddhayāḥ, that samādhi is one of a number of possible sources or methods to obtain siddhi, including birth (janma), herbs or potions (auṣadhi), incantations (mantra), and ascetic discipline or ‘heat’ (tapas) Yoga is understood to be a tool for obtaining both spiri-tual liberation and supernatural powers, though the latter may be acquired through other methods and as the result of activity (karma) of previous lives 12 It is important to note that the obtaining of spiri-tual accomplishments is understood within the domain of yoga to come from various sources—and it is safe to assume that for Patañjali this represented both a theoretical observation and a practical one He was likely aware that various means were postulated with respect to including Śaṅkara, Rāmānuja, and Abhinavagupta, among others Likewise the work of Bhojarāja, concretely represented in his commentary Rājamārtaṇḍa, demon-strates the influence of the Patañjali-polyglot archetype and its historical signifi-cance This may well be the reason why Pātañjala yoga is referred to as rājayoga or the ‘yoga of kings’ one articulation of this can be found in G P Bhatt, ed , The Forceful Yoga: Being the Translation of Haṭhayoga-Pradīpikā, Gheraṇḍa-Saṃhitā, and Śiva Saṃhitā (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass,

actively sought out 13 Though it is clear that the development of siddhi and vibhūti is understood to be a potential impediment to yoga, according to Patañjali, it is also clear that it was well understood that such powers existed, and that they were pursued through various spir-itual disciplines, and that they were part of the ‘context’ of the practice of yoga at the time of the composition of this text It might be argued that the primacy of yama and niyama within the yoga system applies in important ways to the beginning and end of the yogic path In other words, yama and niyama serve to prepare the sādhaka or aspirant for spiritual discipline by cultivating moral and spiritual attitudes that provide a conducive lifestyle for practice, while at the same time framing yogic practice in such a way that the power obtained from it is not misdirected towards unprofitable goals It is also interesting to point out that yama and niyama themselves confer a variety of siddhi powers or siddhi-like powers: ahiṃsā, an aura of peace; satya, fruitful speech, asteya, wealth; brahmacarya, virility; aparigraha, insight into life; śauca, one-pointedness and control of the senses; saṃtoṣa, perfect happiness; tapas, perfection of body and senses; svādhyāya, communion with deities; and īśvarapraṇidhāna, perfect samādhi Likewise, the mastery of āsana and prāṇāyāma lead to an unassailable state and luminous and focused awareness respec-tively, perhaps foreshadowing the range of siddhi powers in haṭhayoga traditions of āsana and prāṇāyāma Likewise, the mastery of pratyā-hāra is described as being the ‘highest control’ of the senses, and is the doorway to the ‘inner limbs’ (antaraṅga) of dhāraṇā, dhyāna, and samādhi, which together are the basis for yogic ‘mastery’ (saṃyama), the source of the siddhi and vibhūti powers of yoga The overarching drive of the yogaśāstra tradition is upon liberation (kaivalya, literally ‘isolation’ or ‘separation’), as opposed to the obtain-ing

powers and objects is an implication of yogic discipline, and these objects are even more attractive than their mundane counterparts YS 3 51 points to what ‘happens’ when yogic discipline comes to fruition—as the power of the practitioner reaches its zenith, all of the ‘goods’ of the spiritual world appear and threaten to disrupt the process of liberation The temptations of the world are thus not limited to the ‘earthly’ tempta-tions of sex, power, and wealth; rather, the earthly temptations pale in comparison to those of a spiritual nature 15 As was mentioned above, in YS 4 1, Patañjali states that supernor-mal powers can come from five principal sources: birth (janma), herbs (auṣadhi, also ‘potions’), incantation (mantra), ascetic discipline (tapas), and contemplation (samādhi) The focus in the YS is upon the practice of samādhi as a liberating technique and as a source for super-normal powers of action and perception (siddhi or vibhūti) According to Larson, the powers or vibhūti can be placed in two categories, fol-lowing their presentation in the third pāda of the YS 16 The first is ‘knowledges’, including knowledge of the past and future, sounds of all beings, previous births, others’ minds, the time and manner of 14 Āraṇya, ibid , 333-35 15 sarbacker, ibid , 166-79 16 Larson, Yoga, 125-32"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"stuart ray sarbacker204one’s own death, objects near and far, the structure of the cosmos, and the structure of the body 17 The second is of ‘powers’, including invis-ibility, strength, possession of others, disembodiment, perfection of the body, and higher forms of sensation 18 The presentation of vibhūti by Patañjali also includes the ‘classical’ list of eight siddhi powers, vyāsa’s formulation being: smallness (aṇimā), lightness (laghimā), greatness (mahimā), obtaining (prāpti), willfulness (prākāmya), per-vasion (vaśitva), lordship (īśitṛtva), and the suppression of desire (kāmāvasāyitva) towards the latter end of kaivalyapāda, the powers culminate in at least ‘virtual’ omniscience and omnipotence, the unlimited abilities of knowledge and action White insightfully refers to vibhūti as ‘omnipresencing’, and has described the manner in which the powers of yoga represent a cosmicization of the practitioner in terms of the limits of embodiment and the homologization of the yogin or yoginī with the cosmos 19 These powers are ultimately to be viewed with dispassion in order to secure kaivalya The attainment of the state of complete vibhūti and its abandonment is the subject of Ys 3 49-50, the verses which precede the earlier statement about the entreaties of the gods; the practitioner obtains kaivalya through devel-oping detachment or dispassion (vairāgya) with respect to the attain-ment of what vyāsa, the commentator, refers to as the ‘sorrowless accomplishment’ (viśokā-siddhi) Likewise, verse 3 37, te samādhā v-upa sargā vyutthāne siddhayaḥ, typically translated as “they [the super-sensory powers] are perfections of manifestation and obstacles for samādhi,” suggesting that supernormal powers are in line with a worldly orientation and obstruct meditative contemplation Despite the fact that that Patañjali appears to view the siddhi and vibhūti powers as potential impediments to liberation, and views dis-passion (vairāgya) with respect to them as essential for securing lib-eration, it would be a gross overstatement and quite premature to state that they are not important or valued in the yoga system The sheer emphasis on vibhūti, and the dedication of one-third of the text to the discussion of them, points to their great import in Patañjali’s representation of yoga As was mentioned previously, it is likely that Patañjali was aware of ‘power-cults’ that were dedicated to

of the siddhi and vibhūti pow-ers was understood to be a by-product of higher levels of concentra-tion, and therefore indicative of differing levels of attainment, important ‘signposts’ in the process of yogic development As is the case in the broader literature, those powers are ambiguous from a moral standpoint—they simply ‘are’ or ‘happen’ as the result of praxis Though not necessarily indicative of moral perfection or spiritual lib-eration, they do indicate that something has been ‘accomplished’ or ‘perfected’—thus the language of siddhi one key context in which this interpretation is validated is in the Purāṇa literature, where elabo-rate passages describe the arising of upasarga, yogic powers that dem-onstrate a high level of yogic attainment, but also appear as ‘lesser’ attainments than the summum bonum of liberation 21 It may also be possible that admonishments against the use of such powers were for those who were striving towards kaivalya, and that the ‘rules’ for the liberated differ from the unliberated 22 This might be argued in con-cert with a discussion in the final section of the YS, Kaivalyapāda, where Patañjali outlines the manner in which a ‘constructed mind’ (nirmāṇacitta) is created by liberated beings (yoga practitioners and īśvara, the ‘lord of yoga’) This is further validated by the Purāṇa pas-sages dealing with aṣṭāṅgayoga, where there is pointed discussion about the exercise of powers by liberated or virtually-liberated practi-tioners, who function as deity-like figures that are able to assist others in their spiritual development 23 In sum, there is ample evidence that the siddhi and vibhūti powers are not simply an afterthought for the Pātañjala yoga tradition as is often argued; rather it is clear that these powers are connected to the core philosophy in ways that are of great significance in the systematic articulation of yoga theory and practice 20 Dasgupta, ibid 21 see, for example, Śivapurāṇa 7 2 37-39, Liṅgapurāṇa 1 8-9 These could per-haps be interpreted either as ‘signs’ or as ‘obstacles’ The notion of the upasarga as an ominous sign, such as of impending death, might be connected to Grinshpon’s ideas regarding yoga and near-death experience, which will be discussed below 22 Perhaps the differences reflecting the pairs of pravṛtti/nivṛtii and vyutthāna/nirodha Both the Śivapurāṇa

interpretive approaches might be uti-lized in making sense of these powers in a broader, academic frame that is not bound to the doctrinal coherence or limited to the data of the philosophical text that is our object of study should we bracket truth claims or truth concerns to examine these powers phenomeno-logically? or, should we embrace a critical, or even skeptical, approach when encountering descriptions and narratives of supernormal pow-ers? one way to address these issues and problems is to examine the various approaches within academic studies that draw upon the yogaśāstra literature and aim to explain and interpret the meaning of such powers What emerges from examining these various perspec-tives is a sense of the spectrum of interpretive possibilities with respect to the nature and role of such powers within yoga What will be argued is that this spectrum of theories, with some augmentation, can be fruitfully drawn together as a set of complementary, as opposed to mutually exclusive, ways of understanding the nature of yoga powers The representation of such powers in Indian literature provides a diverse set of perspectives upon their nature, meaning, and purpose Likewise, it is sensible that different, and not necessarily mutually exclusive, contemporary scholarly interpretations are possible as well In eliade’s landmark work on yoga, Yoga: Immortality and Freedom, for example, eliade draws a range of yoga powers into comparison with those found in shamanism, most notably the notions of magical sight and of magical travel or flight 24 The comparative-phenomeno-logical paradigm, in this case, points to the parallels between the prac-tices of ‘religious specialists’ that have a mastery over spirits or the elements However, the concept of holding to epoché or a neutral atti-tude towards the truth of yoga powers is belied in a passage where eliade refers to ‘real’ yogic powers of control of the ‘neuro-vegetative system’, and the cardiovascular system, as opposed to his previous discussion of claims of levitation, and so forth 25 He does go on to say that the other type of yoga powers are, in fact, ‘real’, but that they are 24 Mircea eliade, Yoga: Immortality and Freedom (Princeton: Bollingen, 1990 [1969]), 334-341 25 I bid , 232"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"power and meaning in the yogasūtra of patañjali 207real in a different sense than the reality of the physiologically-based powers eliade is distinguishing, on some level, between ‘mythic’ and ‘concrete’ powers It might be argued that this appears to demonstrate that the operating principle within eliade’s phenomenology is that the yoga powers are to be understood in a symbolic fashion The assump-tion that such powers are inherently (and only) symbolic in nature might be said to be at odds with the ‘inner’ perspective of tradition, and perhaps at odds with the phenomenological method itself nevertheless, this demonstrates one of the key issues at stake in trying to understand such reputed powers—are they in fact ‘mythic’ in nature, having symbolic meaning, but not literally real? one way that this perspective is supported is to point to the influence of ‘literary’ traditions upon the yoga philosophy With respect to the YS, is it possible, for example, that the compiler of this philosophical treatise felt compelled to bring in and discuss yogic powers that were a part of oral tradition at the time of its composition? smith has recently dis-cussed this issue with respect to the role of possession (āveśa) within the yoga literature, and agrees to a great degree with eliade that the dominance of possession (and power) narratives in Indian literature, both experiential and narrative, likely played a significant role in the composition of theories of yoga powers in the philosophical litera-ture 26 on the other hand, these powers are taken quite seriously in the philosophical literature of yoga and in the Abhidharma and didactic literature of Buddhism one way to mediate these viewpoints is to interpret the theorizing about powers in the philosophical literature as a sort of ‘natural theology’, one that explains how such powers can be naturalized under the terms of a philosophical paradigm—whether that be sāṃkhya or Buddhist Abhidharma theory, or some combina-tion—as well as explaining the methods for obtaining the powers themselves This issue, in particular, ties into the question of whether the YS and the yogaśāstra more broadly were principally practice or theory-driven in their formulation The recent interpretive works of Ian Whicher and Gerald Larson exemplify how arguments can be made in both directions in that respect 2726 Frederick smith, The Self Possessed: Deity and Spirit Possession in South Asian Literature and Civilization (new York: Columbia university Press, 2006), 204-311 27 Representative positions can be found in Ian Whicher, The Integrity of the Yoga Darśana (Albany:

eliade’s analysis as well: the question of whether or not some powers may in fact be based on empirically verifiable data versus other powers which are not empiri-cally verifiable (or based upon empirical data) In eliade’s example, it is the control of physiology and of the cardiovascular system that has been set up as being ‘real’ versus the explicitly spiritual powers In other words, eliade seems to be assuming that there are physical implications of the practice of yoga, but the spiritual dimension is symbolic and psychic in nature He does indicate that the mythic pow-ers are in fact ‘real’, but it is in a different sense than the physiologi-cally based powers This is not the only possible approach to take with this data, so to speak, i e the implicit skepticism of the modern, scien-tific worldview that eliade is invoking one possibility would be to argue that the sorts of physiological effects that eliade is talking about are the concrete manifestations of the symbolic content of the powers In this case, for example, yogic levitation or flight might be manifested by lightness or ease in the body, a graceful moving through space ren-dered by the energetic effects of prāṇāyāma or, perhaps the ability to ‘read minds’ is a power rendered through a focused ability to read the verbal and non-verbal cues of another person, in such a way that there is an intuition of that person’s mental state Magical battles or compe-titions between ascetic figures might be viewed as symbolic accounts of the battle of wills or for hearts among rival sectarian traditions 28 This approach might be said to be coherent with respect to the idea that experiential or literary narratives are a driving force in the repre-sentation of yoga powers—perhaps these stories have drawn upon factual narratives, bringing them to life through the apotheosis of the experiences and actions of their protagonists This is effectively an argument to ‘demythologize’ the powers, an argument for under-standing the powers as the transfiguration of human capacities and abilities As such the dichotomy between the real and physiological and mythic and spiritual folds into understanding that one is an expression of the other, but transfigured in its representative force The difference is that the symbolic quality of the powers is not simply in reference to the world of symbols—as abstractly signifying a spiri-tual quality, which it may do—but also as a reflection of a lived 28 on magical ‘battles’ and sectarian rivalries, see Phyllis Granoff, “scholars and Wonder-Workers: some Remarks on

and also as concrete representations of that transformation of the embodiment of the practitioner Thus yoga powers are, in this analysis, not necessarily either literally true or entirely symbolic in nature Rather, they exist in relationship to each other, as counterparts, with multiple levels of meaning possible within that spectrum Another way to express it would be that there are other options of ‘naturalizing’ these powers other than through the simple dichotomy of physiology versus metaphysics There are other possible analyses of the issue of true versus false or real versus mythic powers one would be the argument that the yoga powers are a ‘hook’ to entice potential adherents, and that the powers of yoga as a sort of cynical ‘marketing’ scheme 29 In this analysis, yoga powers are the ultimate advertisement—the promise of worldly power that is found in the discourses on yoga serves to attract the disempow-ered, whether it is in terms of political, economic, or other referents Yoga offers the promise of power to the powerless—through a mode of living that is, in principle, available to all Masson’s psychoanalytic argument regarding yoga powers is consistent with this analysis, but focuses upon the psychological level Masson’s argues that yoga pow-ers are an expression of infantile powerlessness and that the quest for the ultimate powers of yoga is directly related to repressed childhood experiences of powerlessness 30 Following Masson, the appeal of the powers of yoga—the attraction that they represent in drawing in adherents—is an appeal to the deep-seated psychological insecurities latent in the unconscious mind The quest for yoga powers, then, is an expression of infantile desires—certainly an unflattering assessment of the driving motivations of yoga practice But this also excludes the relationship between material, economic, and other forms of depriva-tion that might fuel the desire for the types of power that yoga repre-sents The recent work of Pintch and White, for example, has explored in great detail the relationship between ascetic organizations, yoga, 29 Modern permutations of this might include purported health benefits or ‘cures’ offered by yoga, the power of yogic flight (see, for example the tM ‘sidhi’ program), or particular types of body shaping or sculpting said to be unobtainable through other physical disciplines 30 J

political power and wealth 31 similarly, Max Weber had noted in his work on Indian traditions that there was at his time of study a close association between social class and the magical ‘profes-sion’

the complexity is the fact that there is evidence in Indian literature of the ‘staging’ of yoga powers, where elaborate ruses served to pro-vide ascetic practitioners with a reputation of possessing magical power and knowledge olivelle has demonstrated how the Arthaśāstra provides instruction on using rumors, spying, and other means of dis-information to create the illusion that a spy-ascetic possesses magical powers White has discussed on a number of occasions the use of slight-of-hand and other illusionist practices among contemporary yogis as a dimension of the ‘wonder-worker’ persona 34 Yoga powers might be viewed in this respect as mimetic, or as a form of mimesis—which can imply trickery or deception, or, alternately the notion that ‘truth’ is a product of the ability to emulate or simulate an archetypal role 35 The demonstration of yoga powers as a mimetic act offers a range of possibilities with respect to the motivation of the person demonstrating such powers, and the reception of the audience that may or may not be naïve with respect to the literal ‘reality’ of such acts The psychological paradigm of interpretation is salient in that it arguably is at parity with the ways in which contemplative practices of yoga are rooted in an Indian psychology or philosophy of mind Gerald Larson, for example, has argued that the powers represented in the vibhūtipāda section

understood to be signposts of spiritual prog-ress, which would presumably be understood as such by an estab-lished teacher This would seem to suggest that yoga powers are principally a mental phenomenon, occurring within the imaginative sphere of the mind, as opposed to in external or physical reality The idea that the powers are indicators of spiritual progress is an idea that finds considerable support in Indian religious literature As men-tioned earlier, one excellent example is the conception of the upa-sarga, which is typically interpreted to mean ‘impediment’ to samādhi but also relates the idea of a ‘sign’ In the Purāṇa literature, the arising of upasarga is a subject of considerable interest in discussions of yoga, as these ‘powers’ are understood as signs of the attainment of succes-sive levels of absorption in samādhi This seems consistent with Larson’s theory that the manifestation of yoga powers represents a set of benchmarks for understanding one’s relative position of spiritual attainment It should be pointed out that a point of distinction between Larson’s theory and Purāṇic accounts is the issue of whether these powers are to be understood as ‘fantasy’ or reality (or some intermediate state) As mentioned earlier, accounts in the Purāṇa lit-erature seem to suggest that these powers are, in fact, manifested in the world, most explicitly in the state of jīvanmukti This would seem to be at odds with Larson’s account on the other hand, other accounts in the Purāṇa literature seem to suggest that the gods do not truly exist separate from the self, lending towards the understanding of metaphysical phenomena as being an illusory projection of one’s own consciousness 36 The warnings against the ‘indulgence’ in powers would seem consistent with the view that if meditative accom plish-ment yields the power to create an ‘inner world’ in which one can possess every object conceivable and desirable, what is to stop a prac -titioner from devoting all of his or her efforts to creating experiences of sexual pleasure and celestial power and enjoyment?37 obeyesekere has argued that samādhi is fundamentally about mastering the ‘hyp-nomantic states’ of deep unconscious realms of the psyche where the symbolism that undergirds our worldview is at work 38 Following this, 36 see, for example, Śivapurāṇa, 7 2 39 29 37 A view

attainment of the spiritual ‘goods’ of a culture repre-sents the penetration of awareness into the depths of consciousness and the mastery over the fundamental archetypal forces that drive egoic identity Grinshpon has articulated an interpretation that is related in important ways to these theories, one in which the arising of the yoga powers is understood as being analogous to near-death expe-riences, brought upon, presumably, by the breaking down of ordinary awareness and the integrity of the egoic self This too lends to a coher-ent conception that the arising of yoga powers is a symptom of yogic processes, which can be understood in psychological terms as a response to the breaking down of the phenomenal self, in a manner analogous to the death process 39These psychological theories hinge on the ideal of the ‘inner world’ that is self-contained, and does not necessarily have a direct relation-ship to a tangible, outer expression of such powers or capabilities one principle that can be drawn from the idea of an outer expression of yoga powers is the idea of the demonstration of mastery and author-ity For, if spiritual accomplishments exist only in the mind of the practitioner, how can mastery be demonstrated to others? Following the analysis of Lewis with respect to possession ritualism, it is quite possible that the emphasis upon yoga powers may be related to the degree to which individual charisma and power is necessary to estab-lish authority In other words, the demonstration of yoga powers is necessary in an environment with less institutional organization and institutionalized authority This would be characteristic of ascetic com munities, and can be connected in important ways to larger social and economic disruptions in a community or society In consonance with this, it makes sense that among the various yoga powers that are described in the Indian literature, some of the most prominent involve mastery over other people and over the world In the first case, the concepts of mind reading and the possession of others’ bodies are par-ticularly prominent motifs, which have been explored recently in the works of smith and White discussed previously one way to analyze sekere also argues that samādhi can be understood as a means for regulation of the ‘pleasure principle’ see Gananath obeyesekere, The Work of Culture: Symbolic Transformation in Psychoanalysis and Anthropology (Chicago:

emotive states that have a ‘con-tagious’ nature, which draw others into the psychological processes of the practitioner This might, as discussed above, involve an ability to negotiate unconscious cues (giving and receiving them) of a verbal or non-verbal nature (such as facial gestures, persuasive speech, and outer trappings of authority such as dress, etc ) As an alternative or as a further expression of this dimension, we might consider the ways in which mind reading and possession are symbolic of the ways in which guru figures extend the field of their psychic influence outward through a community one way to explain this would be through the language of the psychoanalytic process of transference, in which the disciple or devotee draws the guru into their own psychological makeup, placing that person into a position of intimacy and authority with respect to their inner life This is further extended by the ways in which the acceptance of the authority of the guru is transformed into ways of thinking and acting, and the ways in which the guru figure becomes the driving force within the everyday life of the devotee As White has stated, one interpretation of yoga would be as the ‘yoking’ of teacher and disciple, a ‘yoking’ which has great transformative pos-sibility but also represents openness to another’s influence that bears a degree of danger as well 40 In all of these cases, a comparison might be drawn with regards to the principle of ‘possession’ between the power of the guru and the power of the charismatic evangelist—the level of success in their abilities being a function of their ability to either posi-tively or negatively command submission to their will or the will of (a) god By extension, as the center of the social nexus, and the ‘center’ of authority within community, information flows towards the precep-tor, creating a sort of virtual omniscience with respect to the socio-dynamics and collective history of a community, further reifying the image of the guru as an omniscient being This is undoubtedly part of the reason why the Arthaśāstra recommends using a spy in the guise of the highly reputed ascetic as a means of gathering information 41 Lastly, it might be pointed out that yoga has an interesting relation-ship to kingship—both in the sense that the guru might be looked at as 40 White, Sinister Yogis, 122-66 41 Patrick

may also be connected to the ‘cosmicization’ pro-cess that is characteristic of both yoga and tantra to the degree to which the will of the ascetic practitioner is extended through and embodied in others, it could be said that the body of the ascetic becomes the body of the community that the subordinates participate in In other words, the mind and body of the practitioner of yoga becomes the symbolic mind and body of those who are devoted to them, a sort of archetype or icon that represents simultaneously the individual and the community We might look at the power of the yogin or yoginī through the lens of the neo-Durkheimian vision of religion in which the individual is a part or an instrument for a larger reality that is the tangible identity of the deity or spiritually enlight-ened being 42 A cognate theoretical approach would be to view the physical and spiritual transformations of yoga powers through the dynamics of Bourdieu’s theory of habitus and the contrasting forces of doxa and hexis, which fits well with the instantiation of worldview (doxa) and body culture (hexis) of the guru or spiritual preceptor as communal reality (habitus) that is shared Psychic powers, in this interpretation, would represent the mastery of, or recovery of, the pre-viously unconscious doxa and hexis, both of which in turn are reflected out into the world through communal experience Whether we are examining a transformation of the yogin or yoginī into the archetype of collective expressions or the notion that the mind and body of the ascetic are paradigmatic for the community, the idea of participation of the communal within the spiritual life is a coherent interpretation of the yoga powers It might also be asked whether the yogic process of introversion of aṣṭāṅgayoga might be conceived in terms of the pro-gression from the mastery of hexis towards the mastery of the doxa through moving from control of the body in the environment, to mas-tery of breath and posture, to the progression of meditative contem-plations that get to the roots of our cultural constructions that are woven into the very fabric of personality Though this might be con-ceived of in purely symbolic terms, again it might be theorized that to know and to master the individual hexis and doxa is to master them 42 A viewpoint articulated recently in Louise Child, Tantric Buddhism

window to the cosmos within the structures of embodied existence Power, Meaning, and the numinousLastly, one approach to understand the development of yoga powers in a coherent way is through the use of the category of the numinous, particularly as a phenomenological or anthropological as opposed to theological category This use of the numinous implies that the human can become divine or the ‘other’, a proposition that is at odds with theological formulations that presuppose a solid boundary between the human and the divine The numinous is thus, in this theory, a characteristic or set of characteristics, as opposed to an essence that is distinct in some way Likewise, one might say that what is numinous can also be considered as being sacred, but again with the sense that being sacred is a quality or characteristic of something, as opposed to being some sort of transcendent essence that is ahistorical in nature The numinous is useful as a category for bringing together the various

‘Master’ of yoga 44 Just as deities exert power over the cosmos, most notably through the control of the elements and through their control of subordinates, so too the mastery of yoga powers is the

powers If the numinous is characterized by factors such as awe, majesty, and terror, as per the original articulation of this theory, we have quite a range of connections to make with yoga powers Yoga powers, to the degree to which they appear to break the laws of physi-cal and psychic life, have the function of inspiring awe and wonder in the observer They represent boundary crossing, an act that blurs the distinction between the human and the divine, the ordinary and extraordinary Whether of an extraordinary nature (such as mind-reading or flight) or of a less dramatic nature (extreme flexibility or a charismatic personality), the point is that something special is at stake that creates a compelling response from an audience The observer is jarred by the experience of the ‘edges’ of the habitus, much in the way that it might be argued that the yogin or yoginī gains a certain knowl-edge or awareness out of encountering their own physical and mental 44 Lloyd Pflueger, “Person,

charisma to the practitioner—a tacit demonstration of author-ity, proof that the practitioner has control or knowledge over the world that is extraordinary to the extent to which the observer expe-riences awe or wonder at such control, there is a compelling emotive force that predisposes them to recognize the authority of that indi-vidual over the particular dimension of embodiment or mind When we consider multiple observers, the process shifts towards the pos-sessor of yoga powers being an archetype for the minds and bodies of disciples, who view the guru as a mirror reflection of their own spiri-tual ideal—physical or psychic—and who ‘participate’ surreptitiously in the possession and expression of power This can be said to parallel the way that the actor, musician, politician, or ruler serve as abstract representatives of the collective values and aspirations of a commu-nity, and how their charisma ‘binds’ people together These various roles are at parity with respect to their sociodynamics, and it is com-mon to see alliances forged between prominent guru figures or spiri-tual preceptors, political figures, and celebrities Clearly the virtuosity required of all of these vocations and the manner in which the virtuo-so’s persona becomes part of the supporter, admirer, or adherent’s personality plays an important role in the process This follows, as per Durkheim, the universalizing nature of the divine, in which the collec-tive values of a community are embodied in divine forces, here repre-sented by the numinous power of the practitioner of yoga It is no surprise that yogic mastery is often represented through the symbol-ism of worldly kingship, which is exemplified, for example, by the repre sentation of the Buddha as the cakravartin, literally the ‘wheel-turner’, a universal emperor Lastly, as White has discussed at great length, the figure of the yogī (and I would add, the yoginī) might be said to be as much an object of fear as an object of awe; the ambiva-lence that is characteristic of the category of the numinous is well-represented in the ability of the practitioner of yoga to curse as well as bless, and in the portrayal of the yogī as sorcerer in many literary con-texts Awe, terror and royal mastery are all attributes that apply in concrete ways to the persona of the yogin or yoginī, specifically with 45 Benjamin smith,

the demonstration of yoga powers and the representation of such powers in literature encapsulate how the practice of yoga is a vehicle for the transfiguration of the human practitioner into a being of super-normal power and knowledge and a paradigm for a particular type of communal existence ConclusionThe Yogasūtra provides a template for the practice of yoga that has been one of the most influential in the Indian philosophical literature The yogaśāstra tradition of the Ys and its commentaries expands upon this foundation, incorporating over time the shifting philosophical conversations in medieval and modern Hindu tradition Its influence extends into the Purāṇa literature, the late upaniṣad literature, haṭhayoga texts, and into the tantric traditions of Kashmir It has become a touchstone for orthodoxy within modern yoga traditions, quite notably in transnational traditions rooted in Indian sectarian traditions The great import placed upon the yoga powers (siddhi, vibhūti) within Patañjali’s text testifies to their significance even within priestly (brāhmaṇa) traditions that situated yoga within an emergent orthodoxy in the early centuries of the Common era As Larson has demonstrated, the vibhūtipāda section of the Ys provides a broad perspective on the range of powers of knowledge and of action that are said to arise out of yogic mastery (saṃyama) Though these powers are clearly of great significance in the process of spiritual development, they are secondary to the attainment of kaivalya, or lib-eration, within Patañjali’s system nevertheless, they may well be seen to serve as indicators of meditative success and accomplishment, sign-posts on the way to kaivalya, or even powers that can be utilized effec-tively after kaivalya as part of an effort to aid others on the spiritual path It would be difficult to argue that Patañjali does not take these powers seriously or that they are of only of minor significance in the larger work; however, it is clear that the powers themselves are to be abandoned, or released so that the seeds of the defilement (doṣa) of 46 The concept of transference also relates this dynamic between extremes

and meaning in the yogasūtra of patañjali 219mind can be destroyed This abandoning of yoga power occurs at the summit of yogic mastery, when omniscience and omnipotence are at hand Perhaps in the articulation of a great spiritual irony, the attain-ment of supreme power is said to call for the expression of complete dispassion (vairāgya), so that liberation can be achieved What has been sketched out here is a series of interpretive possi-bilities with respect to understanding the meaning of these powers within the yogaśāstra tradition and from multiple scholarly view-points The view from within the yogaśāstra is a coherent one, in which yoga powers illustrate the range of worldly and otherworldly accom plishments that are rooted within Indian religious literature, most notably the literature of Hindu and Buddhist asceticism Yoga powers are framed by sāṃkhya philosophy, which articulates a logic to yogic mastery that is akin to a natural theology, in that the yoga powers are not a disruption of nature, but instead a logical expression of ascetic mastery of it It is also evident that yoga powers, siddhi and vibhūti, are seen to be signposts for the attainment of successive levels of yogic concentration or absorption (samādhi) Academic interpreta-tions range from viewing powers as dichotomously either physiologi-cal and thus ‘real’ and tangible, versus being principally symbolic, mental, and ‘real’ in a limited sense or, the ‘mythic’ nature of the powers might be interpreted as a way of encapsulating a tangible accom plishment in a symbolic fashion, negotiating concrete and sym-bolic worlds These interpretive approaches are on the threshold of another range of possibilities—that yoga powers are a ‘hook’ to attract adherents, that yoga powers are mimetic in nature, and, following Masson, they appeal to the wounded ego of the psychologically powerless Following this psychological interpretive approach, it was discussed how Larson, obeyesekere, and Grinshpon present inter pre-tations of vibhūtipāda that represent a penetration of or breaking down of psychological structures—for Larson the ‘fantasies’ of the ego, for obeyesekere the ‘hypnomantic’ states, and for Grinshpon, the phenomenal ego extending out of the psychological, it was argued that the language of yoga powers also lends towards deeper connec-tions with the way in which such attainments are symbolic of the authority of a yogī or yoginī over other people and community The last point presented was that the concept of the numinous in yoga—that the discipline of mind and body leads, in principle, to the transformation of the practitioner into a deity—brings many of these"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"stuart ray sarbacker220conceptions together, whether or not the powers themselves are viewed as actual, mimetic, or some combination thereof The concep-tion that that the yogī or yoginī becomes a deity points to the idea of crossing boundaries, negotiating the limits of psycho-physical life and creating the experience of awe and wonder, and perhaps fear, in an observer This process was discussed in terms of the sociological para-digm in which a deity represents the embodiment of the values of the collective; through the lens of charisma, in which the mastery of the powers of the elements testifies to an occult or spiritual knowledge and authority; and through the conception of habitus, in which the breaking down of the practitioners doxa (worldview) and hexis (body mechanics) reflects outward as transcendence All of these elements have great potential as comparisons to the manner in which yoga and tantric traditions embrace conceptions of micro-macrocosmic iden-tity Clearly, the systems of yoga and tantra afford a much more opti-mistic vision of whether these structures can be mastered or overcome Like the concepts and practices of yoga, which have been transformed over time by the ‘tradition texts’ and worldviews that have shifted around it, the powers of yoga have shifted in nature and purpose over time 47 However, the logic of their expression remains consistent in important ways, and the tension between yoga as a means to power and virtuosity on one hand and the drive towards spiritual and ethical liberation on the other is as tangible and relevant today as it has been throughout the history of these

char-acteristic aphoristic style, gives a sense of the paranormal as an impor-tant part of the yoga tradition while still asserting the foundationally theological or spiritual intent of yoga practice This chapter will exam-ine various references to perfections and powers as articulated by Patañjali, highlighting their importance, their difficulties, and the ulti-mate emphasis placed in the Yogasūtra on their transcendence two words are used to describe these practices The term vibhūti, though it does not appear in the text itself but solely as a section title, derives from the verb root bhū, ‘be’, prefixed with the intensifier vi meaning ‘manifestation of might, great power, superhuman power ’1 The term siddhi initially appears in the second pāda where it refers first to the perfection of the body and the senses (YS 2 42), and then in regard to the perfection of samādhi, which stems from acts of devo-tion (īśvarapraṇidhāna, 2 45) The third pāda states that perfection of the senses can actually inhibit skill in samādhi (3 37) and the fourth pāda lists four paths to attain perfection: innate ability, drugs, recita-tion of mantra, austerity (tapas), and samādhi (4 1) The key to achieving special powers lies in the application of saṃyama, the combination of the final three techniques of the eight-fold yoga: concentration (dhāraṇā), meditation (dhyāna), and samā-dhi. In each of the instances that denote entry into one of the powers, one employs the technique of saṃyama First one decides upon an object of concentration Following the application of saṃya ma on the object, one gains the power Due to festering karmas, one’s engagement with the world, sullied by past conditioning, expresses itself in a predictably difficult manner As one becomes manifest to the world and the world becomes mani-fest to one’s sullied self, the process of engagement takes on a tone of 1 Monier Monier-Williams, A Sanskrit-English Dictionary (oxford: Clarendon Press, 1995 [1899]), 978"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"christopher key chapple224negativity The five afflictions of ignorance, egoism, attraction, repul-sion, and clinging to life color each experience, each encounter However, although one may be caught within the morass of these kar-mic influences, Patañjali also states that one can master and control the process of worldly engagement, transforming it into creative endeavor through the application of yogic principles and practices The purpose of yoga is to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past: heyaṃ duḥkhaṃ anāgataṃ (YS 2 16) The ethical disciplines and observances (yama and niyama) hold the key to self-purification, allowing one to countermand the habits generated by the afflictions The greatest accomplishment of yoga is to move beyond the fetters of past afflicted karma and dwell in place free of afflicted action: tataḥ kleśa-karma-nivṛttiḥ (YS 4 30) For this process of purification to take place, the yoga aspirant must gain control and exert power over the tendency to slip back into afflicted behaviors various practices give rise to this control: develop-ing a regular practice (abhyāsa) coupled with nonattachment (vai rā-gya), mastering the breath, applying various forms of mental discipline (samāpatti, savitarka, nirvitarka, savicāra, nirvicāra, sabīja, nirbīja samādhi), behaving correctly in accord with friendliness, compassion, joy, and equanimity, and so forth one could list over four dozen ways in which Patañjali encourages the practice of yoga each of these tech-niques brings forth a sense of mastery, a power that enables one to lessen attachment and move closer to freedom In order to fully understand the context that gives rise to these powers that promote and guide one toward liberation, we must first examine a key term: pariṇāma often translated as transformation, this meaning of the word implies a philosophy of causality everything in the world arises from a cause By tracing an experience back to a point of origin, one can understand its purpose By seeing how things arise due to past conditionings, one can gain incentive to change those conditionings to influence future experiences Through pariṇāma, the latent becomes manifest, the impulse becomes flesh The Kauṣītakī Upaniṣad lays out some of the basic premises of this view, stating that “With intelligence (prajñā) having mounted on speech, with speech one attains all names... on the eye, with the eye one obtains all forms... on the two hands, with the two hands one obtains all works... on the body, with the body one obtains pleasure and pain” and so forth 2 2 Kauṣītakī Upaniṣad 3 6 in Robert ernest Hume, The Thirteen Principal Upaniṣads (London: oxford university Press, 1931),

the world is referred to as mind-only (cittamātra, vijñānamātra) 3 The Ātmapurāṇa, a thirteenth century text written by Śaṅkarānanda, states “In the phenomenal world, generation and cessation, which are common to all who possess a body, are established merely by knowl-edge, not due to any other reason ”4 Ideation governs perception of reality The contemporary philosophical school known as phenome-nology asserts, that our truth is governed by the structures, sensory and mental, through which we perceive the world As noted by Brentano and Husserl, intentionality shapes experience 5 According to yoga, the structures underlying perception are malleable and can be reformed and directed away from lethargy and passion (tamas and rajas) toward the illuminative (sattva) In the Yogasūtra, the altering of the world begins with altering the mind The starting point is pariṇāma, the fivefold process of transformation The first pariṇāma signals mastery of the mind, in which one is able to withdraw from the outward manifest world This state of restraint of the mind (citta nirodha) signals the start of yoga The second pariṇāma then follows, with the dissolution of objectivity This expe-rience is referred to as samādhi, the culminating phase of yoga The third pariṇāma, which is closely related to the second, entails one-pointedness of the mind The fourth pariṇāma refers to three opera-tions: stability, definition, and specific qualities within the realm of the elements and the senses The fifth pariṇāma deals with time: past, present, and future There appears to be a progression from subtle to gross in Patañjali’s discussion of pariṇāma. The process begins in the quieting of the mind and a state of absorption, the most rarefied of yogic states The text next introduces the operations of the mind in its one-pointed state as a form of pariṇāma From this, one moves down-ward into the realm of specific thoughts At the fourth stage of pari-ṇāma, physical objects appear as contact is established with the mind 3 see chapter three,

(mahābhūta) of earth, water, fire, air, and space At the fifth and final pariṇāma, these experi-ences unfold in time, described as past, present, and future In cas-cade-like fashion, this string of verses (YS 3 9-16) starts with a state of what might be called the bliss of the non-dual Following this one engages the world with the mind and then through the senses and the objects of sense Finally, the continuum of time completes the world-generating process once the nature of pariṇāma has been established, Patañjali links its process to an array of special abilities As we look at the progression of the pariṇāmas, we can discern a pattern that begins within the realm of elevated thought in the form of samādhi, and then moves into the realm of more mundane thought, signaled by the state referred to as one-pointedness of the mind (citta) before entering the realm of the elements and the senses and time itself Rapture leads to thought which leads to manifestation in physical space and time This progres-sion follows the cosmic metaphysics set forth in the Sāṃkhyakārikā According to this philosophy, the point of origin begins with the stir-ring of the mind Particular karmic patterns (saṃskāras or vāsanās) establish ways of being (bhāvas) within the thought continuum The thoughts thus generated direct the mind and thinking to project out the senses (prapañca) to establish a connection with objects chosen due to pre-determined karmic predilections This process was described in great detail in the Abhidharma literature as well as in the Sāṃkhyakārikā and in various upaniṣads, generally to explain the source of human suffering (duḥkha) Attachments due to the afflic-tions (kleśas) predispose human beings to binding behaviors The pro-cesses of meditation and ethical reflection and action help cleanse the karmic pool and improve one’s disposition 6 Insight into this process of world creation, alongside with being an incentive to engage in a program of self-improvement, can also become an exercise in the enhancement of self-power Through the will, one can shape the world in an intentional manner Knowing that interaction with the world stems from one’s mental constructs, one can willfully and knowingly direct one’s attention to gain specific results By beginning with a point of clarity (samādhi pariṇāma) one 6 Christopher Chapple, Karma and

realities The first of these accomplishments, as explained by Patañjali, leads to an understanding of past, present, and future By knowing how past impressions (saṃskāras or vāsanās) influence future occurrences, Patañjali asserts that one can have knowledge of the past and the future This practice can have both psychological and physical appli-cations If one’s family background favors a cheerful outlook one will be predisposed to be cheerful If a person desires to be energetic and fit, and takes the initiative to adapt a lifestyle conducive to good health, then benefits will accrue By understanding patterns and condition-ings, one gains the key to future accomplishment according to one’s desire Having established the connection between thought, intention, will, and consequent results in the physical and time-bound world, Patañjali then lists a number of specific examples The first, appropri-ate to polyglot India, says that by understanding the structures of lan-guage, one can more easily excel in language acquisition From the beginnings of Indian philosophy, the grammarians articulated the central relationship between words and things as the literal defining point for shaping reality As Thomas Berry has noted,7 from the time of Pāṇini forward, India grasped the powers of words more than any other civilization By knowing root words and the ways in which they transform into arrays of related and derived meanings, one can easily shift from one language structure to another Thought shapes words Words shape reality two passages from the Yogasūtra allude to knowledge of past lives The first hint can be found in 2 39, the description of non-possession (aparigraha) By giving up all things, one comes to understand the origin of all that could possibly be possessed This process of first relinquishing a physical object and then grappling with the desire to possess that object leads one to the inner process of facing and under-standing the root desires linked to the kliṣṭa karmas that predispose the mind to follow the mundane path of acting on one’s impulses to establish oneself in the world through the ownership of things By backing away from things and learning the pathways of impulse, one can spontaneously discover a story that would account for a particular 7 Thomas Berry, Religions of India: Hinduism, Yoga, Buddhism (new York: Columbia university Press, 1992), 10"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"christopher key chapple228behavior sometimes this story is obviously due to the influence of a parent or a teacher; other times the story seems to arise from a shrouded past According to Yogasūtra 3 18, by performing saṃyama on past conditioning (saṃskāra) one can discern backwards beyond influences of this life to the experiences gained in prior lives (pūrva jāti) In a similar way, Patañjali seeks to explain the power of clairvoy-ance By reading physical cues and watching the patterns of the thought process of another, one can predict, sometimes with great accuracy, what another person is thinking about, even if it cannot be confirmed with external proof The description of this very cerebral power is followed with a somewhat puzzling account of how one can be rendered invisible: “From saṃyama on the form of the body, there arises the suspension of the power of what is to be grasped and the disjunction of light and the eye, resulting in concealment” (Ys 3 21) one might speculate that by restraining or concealing one’s usual movements, one can assume the gait or manner of a different person and perhaps be ignored as someone else walks by Good actors are able to completely dissolve into their character similarly, by taking on, as it were, a different persona through the process of changing one’s mental demeanor, one can easily be overlooked or rendered invisible to even friends or family members Prognosis of death has long concerned the yogis of India Patañjali states that by performing saṃyama on whether karma is ‘moving or not moving’ (sopakrama, nirupakrama) one can determine the time of death nearly a thousand years after Patañjali, the Jaina court phi-losopher and yoga expert Hemacandra set forth in his Yogaśāstra more than 150 verses (5 70-224) dedicated to explaining how to pre-dict death At times this ability is described with eerie certainty: “If the breath blows in a single artery for five days, beginning from the first day of the month of Mārgaśīrṣa (november-December), it portends death in eighteen years” (Yogaśāstra 5 79) 8 In other verses, the obser-vation of the breath seems like an ordinary tool used by a physician to determine the strength of a patient The next set of accomplishments links back to the description of the Brahma vihāra in the first section

power of an elephant, Patañjali perhaps indicates that a rela-tionship exists between setting one’s intention on an animal and cultivating its qualities within one’s own being vyāsa’s commentary

uninteresting or perhaps obvious, knowledge of the movements of the sun, moon, and stars can help one integrate the microphase aspect of reality with the cosmos, establishing a connection between, in the words of Mircea eliade, that which is below and that which rises above 11The next set of sūtras (3 29-34) probes into what Patañjali refers to as the cakras, the vortexes of energy within the body that play a signif-icant role in later schools of tantra The progression through these five centers follow an interesting pattern A reader familiar with the later lists of cakras will soon notice that the foundational two centers associated with the root system (mūla cakra) and with sexuality (sva-dhiṣṭhāna/liṅga/yoni) are not mentioned by Patañjali Rather, he begins with the navel center (nabhi cakra), noting that concentration on this cakra yields knowledge of the ordering of the body From the navel, Patañjali skips over the heart (more on this later) and rises to the throat (kaṇṭha kūpa) through which one masters hunger and thirst The next cakra remains somewhat shrouded in mystery Referred to as the ‘tortoise tube’ (kūrma nāḍī) it evokes images of the capacity to draw oneself inward like a tortoise It also indicates the continuing rich use of animal imagery, not unlike the above reference to the strength of an elephant The placement of this center, though not specified in the text nor in vyāsa’s commentary, might corre-spond to the point in the middle of the forehead (ajña cakra) Patañjali claims that concentration on this area leads to spiritual stability The highest center, described as the light in the head (mūrdha jyoti), brings one into a vision of the perfected ones (siddhadarśana) This could correspond with the lotus with a thousand petals (sahasra) It leads one into a state of intuition (prātibha) Finally, one returns to and set-tles into the heart (hṛdaya) wherein one can truly understand the operations of the mind (cittasaṃvid) one implication of this

kārikā system of bhāvas starts with power, ascends to a dis- pas sionate state, and then rises to transcendent, liberating knowledge, before settling into the performance of sanctified action (dharma) Before moving on to a description of more powers, the author reminds the reader that the highest attainment does not lie within the mastery of these skills, but in the discernment between that which changes and the never-changing yet omnipresent pure witness con-sciousness to pursue any other endeavor serves as an impediment At the end of the chapter, Patañjali emphatically restates this point In one of the more mysterious accounts of the powers, Patañjali describes being able to inhabit the body of another person through giving up attachment to one’s own body, carefully observing the body of another, and then occupying that body with one’s mind This accomplishment is described in other texts such as the Mahābhārata. Frederick smith has published a major study of such possession occurrences 12 Hemacandra’s Yogaśāstra (vv 264-273) describes a process through which one can enter the bodies first of dead birds, eventually moving on to occupy the bodies of black bees, deer, men, horses, elephants (all dead), and stone images It advises against enter-ing the bodies of living beings ‘out of fear of sin,’ presuming that such ‘body snatching’ would violate the Jaina precept of non-violence 13 The next cascade of sūtras begins with rising up from dirt and mud, the primary elements, into a radiance, evoking fire, the next element As one’s concentration turns even more upward toward space, one develops divine hearing and the capacity to move through space:From mastery of the up-breath, there is nonattachment amongst water, mud, thorns, and more, and a rising above From mastery of the equalized breath, there is radiance From saṃyama on the connection between the ear and space there arises the divine ear From saṃyama on the connection between the body and space, and from unity with the lightness of cotton, there is movement through space (YS 3 39-42) 12 Frederick M smith, The Self Possessed: Deity and Spirit Possession in South Asian Literature and Civilization (new York: Columbia university Press, 2006) 13 Quarnström, The Yogaśāstra of Hemacandra, 141-142 Quarnström quotes another passage cited by Hemacandra that described entering another living person, occupying the heart, and dwelling in the life of that person for a half day"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"christopher key chapple232In Yogasūtra 3 43, Patañjali suggests that all these accomplishments lead ultimately to a state of illumination and freedom and that through this process of rising above, “the covering of light is destroyed ” Through reflection upon the process described in the pariṇāma pas-sages wherein subtle determines the gross and mind controls matter, it is said that one gains mastery over the elements (YS 3 44) With this, one achieves perfection of the body, which becomes beautiful and strong next, by reflection on the relationship between ego and form, one gains mastery over the senses, resulting in “swiftness of the mind organ” and a mastery over the subtle potentialities within the unman-ifest state of prakṛti, the creative principle At this stage, the individual develops the liberating capacity to discern “the difference between purity (sattva) and pure consciousness (puruṣa) ” This highest power brings about an ongoing “knowledge born of discernment” that resists any attempts to be lured back into undesirable circumstances Through this ultimate spiritual power, one attains the state of solitary blessed-ness (kaivalya), the final goal of yoga (YS 3 49-55) to recount this description of powers, they begin with a focused mind adept at the skills of concentration, meditation, and samādhi, known collectively as saṃyama.

We have seen two approaches The first approach results in bodily perfection and an ability to become manifest in the world in desired ways This sort of perfection would result in beauty, power, and, if desired, uncanny intelligence Patañjali clearly warns that this form of perfection is a distraction and even potentially dan-gerous He states “These are impediments to samādhi, while in worldly production they are perfections” (YS 3 37) The second approach moves one appropriately from karmic afflictions with the realm of lethargy and passion (tamas and rajas) toward illumination (sattva), as stated earlier He also urges one to rise above even illumination to"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"siddhis in the yogasūtra235attain freedom This process requires discernment not only into the power of the mind in creating desired realities, but discernment about the nature of ultimate or highest freedom With somewhat uncharac-teristically passionate rhetoric, Patañjali argues at the end of the third section of the Yogasūtra that one take up this aspect of yoga, which he clearly deems superior:only from discerning the difference between sattva and puruṣacan one gain sovereignty over all states of being and total knowledge Going beyond even this, by destroying this last seed of ignorance,one enters kaivalya.one cannot be flattered into attachment or pride,because one knows their consequences By applying concentration, meditation, and samādhi on each moment,one understands all that will follow one possesses knowledge born of discernment This discernment allows one to make the choice, opting for the soul consciousness that remains untouched rather than pursuing birth, status, and place This knowledge is said to be liberatingat all times and in all circumstances,with no residue remaining In the sameness of purity between one’s sattvaand the purity of Īśvara, arises kaivalya.

The term ‘yoga’ certainly conjures up images of peace and renunciation in the popular mind ultimately this may be justified, yet India’s most ancient orthodox viewpoints sāṃkhya and Yoga darśanas (henceforth referred to as a single com-plementary system, Classical Sāṃkhya-Yoga), in fact have a lot to say about power and powers However much the idea of power in contem-porary thought seems tainted, suspect, and the usual focus of the work of deconstruction, in Sāṃkhya-Yoga philosophy, power, powers, super powers, and success are closely related to purity and peace In this essay I hope to unpack this relationship in some detail What is the relationship between power and purity in Classical Sāṃkhya-Yoga? What is power? Where does it come from? What is purity? What is success? Let’s begin with an experiment While sāṃkhya philosophy is largely theoretical, Patañjali’s yoga philosophy is largely experimental and empirical I hope along the way to engage the patient reader in some simple practical observations to make my points more clearly: Please sit up straight Close the eyes And take a long deep breath in through the nostrils Hold the breath in Just observe: How does it feel? notice a little surge of energy? How long can you hold it—both the breath and the feeling of energy? experiment a little, the book will wait now let’s focus on the exhalation—take the breath in as before, notice the energy, hold a little and then let it go rather slowly through the mouth with a quiet hissing ‘huuuuh’ sound What’s happening in the body? Feel the relaxation?"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"lloyd w pflueger242one more time, now that you know what you are doing I want you to notice something special, something subtle, something very com-mon: As we breath in, notice the subtle feeling of power, new energy Hold that a while And as we breathe out again notice the relaxation and after the relaxation, before the next breath, notice the peace It comes without asking These two experiences which accompany every complete breath, though very simple, are very easily overlooked, since our breath is usually automatic and unobserved even one conscious breath or two can bring us into balance The Yoga sūtra (YS) states that samādhi, that highly sought after salvific state of meditative balance and absorption1 can be brought by control of the breath:1 34 Pracchardana-vidhāraṇābhyāṃ vā prāṇasya.1 34 or by exhaling and restraining the breath 2In YS Book two, this breath control is listed as one of the eight limbs of yoga and credited with immense power, the power to remove ‘that which obscures illumination’ As Patañjali notes:2 52 tataḥ kṣīyate prakāśāvaraṇam.2 52 From this, that which obscures illumination is destroyed 2 50 bāhyābhyantara-sthambha-vṛttir deśa-kāla-saṃkhyābhiḥ paridṛṣṭo dīrgha-sūkṣmaḥ.2 50 [This prāṇāyāma, having] external, internal, and [completely] arrested states classified by location, time, and number [becomes] long and subtle since illumination is the ultimate goal of yoga, that’s big power Patañjali goes on in the next chapter to link the mind’s capacity for meditation with this practice of breath control, holding and releasing the breath 2 53 dhāraṇāsu ca yogyatā manasaḥ.2 53 Also the capacity of the mind for holding on [comes from this] I hope you remember this small breathing experiment I will remind you from time to time to recall it and take another conscious breath In a nutshell, I believe, it holds a key to understanding power, purity, 1 The sanskrit term here is

relax even if this key drops to the ground the door will open If the world were open and clear, if everything were just as it seems, we would not need a key Indian philosophy, in the form of the six darśanas3 presents what it sees as the keys to liberation The point is not speculation, but salvation, to open a door out of suffering It takes both knowledge and power to open this door Success (siddhi) in such philosophy is ultimately only this, the attainment of liberation from suffering All other successes, attainments, powers, or perfections, are to just gain this In this regard the dualistic philosophies of sāṃkhya and Yoga work together: Classical sāṃkhya is the intellectual key to understanding the underpinnings of existence, the twenty-five prin-ciples (tattvas)4 and the misunderstood binary structures that seem to confine consciousness in erroneous notions of who we are and what is going on Classical Yoga is more a philosophy of the practices, the key spiritual disciplines which are understood to give aspirants direct experience of their true identity, releasing them from an insidious and enduring misapprehension of reality Like a rocket overcoming grav-ity, the aspirant to freedom must make use of extraordinary power and extraordinary powers to make this victory possible While the ultimate power is knowledge, the experience of a pristinely clear intel-lect (buddhi) distinguishing true identity, pure consciousness, Patañjali also makes it clear that a host of lesser powers and attain-ments known as vibhūtis or siddhis, (seen throughout the YS but par-ticularly in Chapter 3 Vibhūtipāda) also arise as important steps along the path of liberation I will attempt to place these powers in relation 3 orthodox Indian philosophy traditionally consists of six viewpoints, nyāya, vaiśeṣika, sāṃkhya, Yoga, Karma Mīmāṃsā, and vedānta, of which the oldest are the pair of Sāṃkhya-Yoga 4 The twenty five tattvas of sāṃkhya are binary puruṣa (pure consciousness) and prakṛti (primordial matter, composed of the three threads, sattva, rajas, and tamas) Prakṛti, unlike static eternal puruṣa, goes on to evolve and generate more condensed principles, buddhi (intellect), then ahaṃkāra (ego sense), and from that manas (lower mind), the five sense capacities, buddīndriyas (hearing, touching, seeing, tast-ing, smelling), the five action capacities, karmendriyas (speech, prehension, locomo-tion, excretion, and procreation), the five subtle elements, tanmātras) (sound, touch, form, taste, smell), and the five gross elements, mahābhūtas (space, air, fire, water, earth) which combine to make the world of gross objects we know in the world While most of us suffer because our consciousness is mistakenly identified with the body and its thought process, Sāṃkhya-Yoga would have us realize the separate nature of pure consciousness, our true, unchanging identity, from all the changing forms of

holding on and letting go supernormal PowersThese much vaunted siddhis, the powers and perfections of the yogin who is approaching liberation are invested with more sūtras and more continuous

the siddhis as irrelevant low magical additions to an otherwise lofty philosophy,6 Dasgupta likewise associates them with a popular misunderstanding of yoga and finds them merely useful for strength-ening faith 7 More recently oberhammer also gives them little im portance for Patañjali 8 on the other hand, scholars such as eliade, Kane, and Pensa have gone some distance in acknowledging the important role of the siddhis in Sāṃkhya-Yoga.9 For example Pensa asserts that:5 Lloyd Pflueger, “Person, Purity, and Power in the Yogasūtra,” in Theory and Practice of Yoga: Essays in Honour of

of these [waves of the mind] is by practice (abhyāsa) and detachment (vairāgya) Yogic abhyāsa or practice is briefly defined as the undertaking to hold on to the stability of mental quiescence (tatra

established 18 The aspirant to perfection in yoga must hold on like a pit bull Vairāgya (detachment) is defined in terms of the mastery of the yogin who has been able to mentally let go of all thirst,

material agent of knowledge, and that ultimate attainment, in a way frosts the cake of enlightenment, demonstrating the furthest range of sanctification and power Let’s explore the eight layers of the ‘cake’ and the baking process from the bottom up22 (recalling that one of the meanings of siddhi is complete cooking 23) 22 I t is by no means certain that these eight subdivisions of yogic sādhana are stages or sequential steps Clearly each ‘limb’ or ‘subdivision’ is related to the rest rather than entirely independent or preliminary Moral virtues such as non-attach-ment (aparigraha, non-grasping) could certainly strengthen physical postures, āsana, as well as the final limb, samādhi, and doubtless samādhi would strengthen aparigraha and āsana, etc The direction the texts points to is definite, however, from external to internal The real focus of Sāṃkhya-Yoga is the purification and transfor-mation of the faculty of refined thought, the buddhi, whose lack of clarity creates and perpetuates suffering and lack of self knowledge The subdivisions of yoga as listed progress from moral virtues and attitudes to lifestyle (cleanliness, contentment, rec-itation of sacred texts etc ) to physical postures, breath control, sense withdrawal and meditation Power increases with the internal limbs even so it may be going to far to assume that the listing of the eight subdivisions is anything but a convenient tra-ditional means of organizing and addressing the aspects of yoga The YS is full of alternatives and alternative ways of organizing the path—probably due to being an amalgam of various early traditions which agree more on the goal than the exact conceptualization of the means, much like the upaniṣads themselves, as a collection of the views of various successful gurus 23 Siddhis are the fruit (consequence) of yogic tapas, or ‘heating’ the name given generically to the transformative heating that purifies and matures the aspirant through sādhana (see YS 2.1). A yogin is cooked by tapas from his raw natural state to the state of complete power and perfection. see regarding tapas and its history: Walter o Kaelber, Tapta Mārga: Asceticism and Initiation in Vedic India (Albany: state university of new York Press, 1989) I apologize for using what may be a confusing array of metaphors in the essay We have breathing, baking , agriculture (fruit etc ), hydrodynamics, and even even-tually coherent state laser physics is in play Analogical thinking is, I believe a very traditional way to explain and argue points in the Indian tradition A range of meta-"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"holding on and letting go251We notice immediately in the aṣṭāṅgayoga the important verb root √yam to hold, support, restrain, govern or subdue 24 This type of hold-ing or disciplined restraint appears in the first two subdivisions of yama and niyama, virtuous observances and disciplines. 2 30 ahiṃsā-satyāsteya-brahmacaryāparigrahā yamāḥ.2 30 The virtuous observances are: non-violence, truthfulness, non-stealing, chastity, and non-attachment 2 31 jāti-deśa-kāla-samayānavacchinnāḥ sārva-bhaumā mahāvratam.2 31 unqualified by class, location, time, or circumstance, they are uni-versal, [comprising] a great vow The mastery of these virtues is arguably the first systematic example mentioned in the YS of attaining to supernormal powers The basic model is negative: the yogin seems to attain virtue by holding back from vice: Most of the rules of the virtuous observances (yama) are stated negatively as well: non-harming (ahiṃsā), non-stealing (asteya), non-greediness (aparigraha) establishing oneself in truth (satya) and chastity (brahmacarya), though the terms are positive, easily fit the same ethos Interestingly enough, holding to virtue implies also a let-ting go of vice The two-fold power of discipline and renunciation is on display The model (stated rather cryptically) is 2 37:2 37 asteya-pratiṣṭhāyām sarva-ratnopasthānam 2 37 to one established in non-stealing, all jewels present themselves In other words renunciation gives mastery or positive power, control, over that which one steadfastly renounces—the very opposite of worldly common sense Another example is truthfulness:2 36 satya-pratiṣṭhāyām kriyā-phalāśrayatvam.2 36 For one established in truthfulness the consequences of action conform [to his speech] By establishing truthfulness (the renunciation of dishonesty, lying, and denial) one gains conformation of one’s words with reality What is that?

āyurvedic notions of the virtue of retaining semen, and the weakness incurred in losing semen sexual desire is also a major sign or test of one’s ability to demonstrate mastery of desire (vairāgya)—a test (along with resisting anger) which in the traditional epic literature even the greatest sages and saints can often fail 26 Viz. 2 1 tapaḥ svādhyāyeśvara-praṇidhānāni kriyā-yogaḥ.2 1 Purification,

Tapas, literally ‘heat’ is the traditional key to removing impurity Tapas means ascetic practices—all of which revolve about renunciation This is purification by fire, i e by heating, excitation—transformations in cooking or metallurgy such purifications are likely not particularly pleasant and involve a great deal of ‘holding on’, firm unflinching mental stability in the face of pain and adversity 28 This outer purification promises to perfect the body and the senses, probably both the five sense organs (buddhīndriyas) and the corre-sponding five organs of action (karmendriyas); with outer purification one should expect a great increase in acuity and effectiveness Interestingly, the negative purification through tapas and renunci-ation of pain is balanced by a positive purification of experiencing santoṣa, contentment 29 This implies that growing purity has its reward, not just in power, but in happiness What kind of mind can hold on with greatest fixity? not the suffering mind or the heroic mind only the contented mind so, somewhat unexpectedly (by reference to the scriptural tales of the extreme painful asceticism of the sages), the path of purification is not just a ‘marine corps bootcamp’, but also appar-ently a climb to increasing satisfaction This makes sense since the total settling down of the mind in samādhi is also the state of highest 28 Again I am influenced here by Kaelber’s, Tapta Mārga. see note 23 above 29 There are traditionally two main ways to purify something, by fire and by water, i e , by extreme heating or by extreme cooling Indian thinking tends to con-ceptualize suffering as a kind of heating and the settling down into immobile silence and peace as a form of gratifying peace naturally they may be related as binary complements of each other: one may need to move into a form of extreme excitation before one can sink into deep silence, contrast is all in the world of prakṛti By the same token one may

Contentment here shows the yogic path to power is not one of unbalanced strain, heroic tension, and willpower as one might expect of heroes in the martial arts, but also one of let-ting go, relaxation and contentment Contentment and peace, and bliss are not just the fruit of strenuous austerities, but are also a kind (kinder?) discipline which can melt away impurities Those who have little experience with meditative techniques may be easily convinced from Indian epic literature that the inner path is entirely one of stren-uous kṣatriya dharma, martial arts training While it is likely true that a substantial part of the yoga tradition disciplines come from kṣatriya rather than Brahmin contexts, as Hauer and others assert, the gentler and devotional side is equally important We dare not underestimate the positive fulfillment and joy of moving even a little in the direction of a settled meditative mind If enlightenment is the greatest bliss, the annihilation of suffering, movement in that direction, while requiring discipline, effort, and holding on, is balanced by the relief and bliss of letting go of desire, strain, and effort In a sense the purpose of holding on is to attain a deeper letting go vyāsa merely quotes the Mahābhārata here:In this connection it is said: What in this world is love’s fair pleasure And what the joy of gods ev’n higher, Are not even worth a

apparently possible to maintain a level of unshakable objectivity vyāsa claims: “Samādhi is perfected for one whose whole being is fixed on īśvara By this [perfection of samādhi] he knows all he desires [to know] as it truly is in other places, other bodies, and other times Then his awareness perceives things as they are ” This excursus into the powers from perfecting even the first two limbs

yoga paths the perfection of any major part will bring us the vision of the whole every section is a kind of microcosm, and its perfection poten-tially renders the ultimate fruit This is apparently the holistic vision of the sage who has reached the goal; the reality of the path makes orga-nized lists and systematic progression useful for teaching purposes 30 The attitudes and disciplined purity

It is a curious fact that in the modern West, the thinking process is felt to be located in the head William James, for example, located the human sense of indi-viduality, the locus of our sense of individual consciousness as identical with certain almost subliminal sensations of “intracephalic muscular adjustments” and “breath moving outwards between the glottis and the nostrils” (“The notion of Conscious-ness” in The Writings of William James, p 183, J J McDermott, ed , 1967) such a view is undoubtedly promoted by the scientific knowledge of brain function since, however, the brain is not a tactile organ there is no real reason other than cultural why thought or awareness should be ‘felt’ and localized in the head non-Western cultures and Western culture before modern times have almost universally located"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"lloyd w pflueger2583 2 tatra pratyayaikatānatā dhyānam.3 2 Meditative flow (dhyāna) is the continual abstraction of a single object in this holding on The second practice, dhyāna, meditation is the ‘continual abstraction of a single object in this holding on’ (3 2) This is the repetitive ele-ment, the essence of japa, a continuous flow of single particular thought which is free (with simultaneous detachment, letting go) to sink to quieter and more subtle levels of repetition and experience This implies a new subtlety: holding an object of meditative attention, while simultaneously allowing it to fade, to flow to more subtle and absorb-ing levels Simultaneously with the holding there is a letting go This sounds impossible, but in practice it is the kind of thing we recognize as skill in most physical endeavors, such as sports If you think about it, it is not really foreign to experience Perhaps it is just a reflection of the balance of our binary nervous system, sympathetic and parasym-pathetic or the complementarity of the two hemispheres of the brain We are often called upon to be both focused (static) and in motion (flowing) In yogic meditation the ensuing state is one of deepening absorption, moving from gross to subtle and from the dualism of sub-ject and object, to non-dual convergence The meditator and the object eventually become one 3 3 tad evārthamātra-nirbhāsaṃ svarūpa-śūnyam iva samādhiḥ.3 3 samādhi is [the state of coherent awareness when] this very medi-tation presents itself [transparently] as the object alone, as if devoid of any intrinsic nature of its own This absorption could be called coherent awareness It is so strong as to exhibit a great empowerment of the human mind, an epiphany of divine potential Just as a laser beam, every photon coherently in step both in phase and frequency, displays exponentially greater power than the scattered and diverse light from an ordinary bulb, so the supernormal powers of the coherent awareness necessarily result from such non-dual convergent samādhi, the synthesis of holding on and letting go the thinking process in the heart or navel regions That the yogin might hold his thinking, even of a mantra, in a variety of locations is not so odd as it may sound shifting the felt location of the thinking process even a short distance might, indeed, result in a corresponding shift from the habitual narrow identification with the mind/body complex to an expansive, more impersonal identity"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"holding on and letting go2593 5 taj-jayāt prajñālokaḥ 3 5 By mastering this there is intuitive-vision 3 6 tasya bhūmiṣu viniyogaḥ 3 6 This [convergence] is employed in stages The YS generally differentiates samādhis into two categories, absorb-tion with and absorbtion without an object, samprajñāta samādhi and asamprajñāta samādhi.

bilasiddhi is usually deployed rather differently unlike pleasure- or power-seeking kings, celebrated religious figures use rifts into the underworld to disappear at the end of their lives This may be motivated by a desire to show that they have overcome death The Chinese pilgrim-traveler Xuanzang (629–645 ce) recounts that the Mādhyamaka philosopher Bhāviveka, using a mustard seed, is supposed to have entered a rock cavern in Dhānya-kaṭaka, there to await the arrival of the future Buddha Maitreya Beal (1884:226, note 116) sees this as the source of the legend of Ali Baba, the name itself presumably deriving from Bhāviveka’s aliases ‘Bhāva’ or ‘Bhavya’, and the mustard seed has been transmuted in the retelling into the ‘open sesame’ formula only six of his followers dared enter

beings, and they are commonly grouped with other ominous, flesh-eating beings (see also Kuṭṭanīmata 250 on their diet of flesh) In the Skandapurāṇa 119 93d a female Yātudhānī is addressed as “o night-stalker” (niśācari).

of the Nāgas oral tradition reports that the Śaiva ācārya Abhinavagupta, too, is said to have entered a cave and disappeared at the end of his life [2 ] A comparably raw expression of the quest for power can be seen in the ‘mastery of the sword’ (khaḍgasiddhi), an occult object that grants its wielder sovereignty over the Khecaras or Vidyādharas54 and also the ability to fly Again, the seeker of such magical swords is fre-quently an already powerful king who seeks to maximize his power,55 an idea related to the pre-tantric quest for divine weapons (divyāstra) found in the epics and Purāṇas These magical swords are not simply inert symbols of royal power 56 Whitaker has shown that such weap-ons are embodiments of tejas, or ‘fiery energy’, and as such they can only be wielded by extraordinary persons who can match their tejas In the Mahābhārata, when Śiva gifts Arjuna a ‘supreme, stainless sword’, Śiva first needs to empower Arjuna to wield the dangerous weapon,57 and as we

system the category of the ‘self’ (puruṣa) is con-ceived of as an inactive witness This evidently cannot be reconciled with the inherited Śaiva doctrine of the self as an ‘agentive experient’ (bhoktṛ) A concise and summary presentation of the non-dualist argument against the sāṃkhya view can be found in the non-dualist Śaivite Kṣemarāja’s eleventh century Svacchandatantroddyota, in the context of a discussion of the realms existing at the reality level (tat-tva) of the ‘self’ (puruṣa) 73 In the Svacchandatantra’s serial ascent through the ontology of reality levels (bhuvanādhvan), the reality level of the self (puruṣa) is a form of consciousness that appears contracted because the supreme lord has concealed his identity There exist, at this ontological level, consciousness-based ‘worlds’ or ‘realms’ (bhu-vana), which are merely grounded on aspects of this contraction, since in reality the self/lord is unchanging 74 Kṣemarāja states that in the sāṃkhya system these realms are considered the nine tuṣṭis and eight siddhis, inhabited by presented ideas (pratyaya), that are under-stood to be positive qualities of the intellect (buddhi) Kṣemarāja rejects this view For the Śaiva system, so he argues, these are rather ‘coverings’ (āvāraka) of the self (puruṣa), which has not yet discerned the veils (kañcuka) of kalā etc ,75 and whose nature is a contracted form of awareness, and which in this way can function as an agentive experient or ‘enjoyer’ (bhoktṛ) 76 If the self were, as the sāṃkhya sys-tem posits, a bare perceiver or witness but not an agentive

of pratyayas, mere miracles meant to generate faith in the liberatory efficacy of Śaiva initiation 113The plethora of supramundane powers is taught for the sake of show-ing faith-inspiring miracles to

vows and caryā,124 but negligent due to infatuation, who engages in sexual activity, is reborn as a great Vetāla one who spills his semen in a non-yoni or a bad yoni is also reborn as a Vetāla, he bears the burden of his infatuation on his back The Ātmārthapūjāpaddhati, a medieval Śaiddhāntika ritual manual, attributes a similar retributive origination myth to the Rāmāyaṇa:125A man who goes to a Śiva temple and then ejaculates semen or emits feces or urine is reborn as a Vetāla We see here an attempt to encompass even these malific beings within a loose Śaiva fold: they are lapsed Śaivas This strategy parallels the Śaiva exoneration of the performer of animal or human sacrifice from any moral guilt he may feel towards the sacrificial victim There the victim is portrayed as the reincarnation of a similarly lapsed Śaiva who has broken his post-initiatory samaya vows (see vasudeva forth-coming) The Saiddhāntika Mṛgendratantra adds details concerning the typology of the demonic bodies (paiśācaṃ vapuḥ) that are the rebirth destiny (gati) of lapsed Śaivas and also the method to prevent such a mishap The tenth century commentator nārāyaṇakaṇṭha glosses as follows:126When [protection from karmic consequences] is not performed, souls, when the previous karma of transgressing the initiatory vows matures after death because it was not annulled during initiation, obtain a demonic body, despised by the good, and undergo torment 123 Tantrasadbhāva 7 141–142 124 see Tāntrikābhidhānakośa, sv caryā 125 Ātmārthapūjāpaddhati, the verse is, however, not cited in the BoRI

Vidyādhara is originally a man ... there can be no real doubt that the Vidyādhara represents man become superman by virtue of his knowledge ”131 After mastering the respective vidyā, mantra or

narrative of BhuśụṇdaThis essay explores the nature of Bhuśuṇḍa’s liberating experience as depicted in the Nirvāṇa section of the text, the Yogavāsiṣṭha (YV) Bhuśuṇḍa identifies himself as ‘liberated while living’ (jīvanmukta) unlike other jīvanmuktas in the narratives, such as Janaka or Śuka who eventually succumb to death, Bhuśuṇḍa, the protagonist, a crow born of a father crow and a mother goose, is immortal and thus he is literally ‘living’ while being ‘liberated’ The course of practice that Bhuśuṇḍa adopts, the breathing exercise, is somewhat different from those given in the rest of the narratives that highlight sudden realiza-tion with the knowledge of the true nature of mind and a recognition of the illusory nature of the appearance that is considered to be other than awareness itself As the narrative of Bhuśuṇḍa challenges com-mon assumptions with regard to the yoga introduced in the YV in other sections, it is essential to have a close textual analysis in order to explore the alternative approaches to yoga and the nature of siddhi that results from this yoga practice even a text by a single author presenting a single stream of argu-ment may embody different and sometimes contradictory strands of thought YV is unique We do not know the real author of the text and the text was most likely compiled over a long span of time by different authors scholars have even suggested Mokṣopāya as a different title for YV in its earlier version 1 This philosophical epic, filled with graphic narratives provided to illuminate Rāma, following the genre 1 see Walter

synthesize multiple philosophical positions Although the title identifies the text with yoga, the yogic methods addressed here are not identical either to Patañjalian or to nātha Yoga literature Beneath the layers of poetry and narratives, this text weaves idealistic thoughts from different strands of classical Indian philosophical schools such as the upaniṣadic Advaita, Yogācāra Buddhism, and trika Śaivism Due to the over-whelming presence of poetic tropes and enchanting narratives in the YV that give the sense of classical kāvya, and because it addresses phil-osophical themes that present one form of Advaita thought which may not be completely identical to that promulgated by Śaṅkara, the identification of the text with yoga has occasionally been questioned This tendency has overshadowed an investigation of the tantric and haṭhayoga materials within the text The narrative of Bhuṣuṇḍa is one among select discourses in the text that challenges an over-simplified understanding of YV that the text does not fit in the category of yoga literature in the familiar appli-cations of yoga as haṭhayoga or Patañjalian yoga, as this discourse between vasiṣṭha and Bhuśuṇḍa places the yoga of breathing in the same status as the contemplative techniques generally addressed as jñāna or jñānayoga In the first section of the sixth book, Nirvāṇa Prakaraṇa, of the lengthy text YV, chapters 14-28 are dedicated to the discourse of Bhuśuṇḍa Chapter 13 presents itself as a preface for the upcoming discourse by describing two types of yoga, the yoga of prāṇa and the yoga of self-realization (chap 13, 7) The passage further con-firms that although these both are yogas, the term yoga is convention-ally (rūḍha) used to address the approach to prāṇa (prāṇayukti) (chap 13, 6) This preface indicates a shifting dynamic in the upcom-ing chapters What makes the liberation of Bhuśuṇḍa unique is his immortality: Bhuśuṇda tells the self-realized vasiṣṭha that there have been multiple vasiṣṭhas in different eons that come to converse with him And the focus on prāṇa, a theme of haṭhayoga, comes to the forefront in the narrative of Bhuśuṇda The shifting dynamics in which Bhuśuṇḍa appears is indicated by his perfection, and the yogic course demonstrates an alternative path to liberation while living 2 For discussion, see Bruno Lo turco, “The Metaphorical Logic of

Jürgen Hanneder has identified Śaiva tantric elements in the narrative of Bhuśuṇḍa, particularly in its earlier Mokṣopāya ver-sion 3 This essay proceeds taking his arguments for granted In general, the texts discussing liberation somehow subordinate the body, and thus, living What makes the case of Bhuśuṇḍa different from the other narratives of liberation is his living aspect, and through that, the affirmation of corporeality This also distinguishes Bhuśuṇḍa from vasiṣṭha, as in this narrative Bhuśuṇḍa claims to have met vasiṣṭha for eight times in different eons This difference demon-strates a contrast in the final goal of yogic practice in the lives of vasiṣṭha and Bhuśuṇḍa: although vasiṣṭha is liberated, he is not living eternally as is Bhuśuṇḍa This shift brings to the forefront some cen-tral constituents of haṭhayoga: the quest for immortality, its assurance of immortality through the balance of prāṇa, its confirmation of non-duality while embracing embodiment, and its link to Advaita and tantric themes while not entirely following either of these As prāṇa is considered to be the link between the body and mind, as ‘life’ that bridges the self and the corporeality, the liberation of Bhuśuṇḍa war-rants a closer look through the perspective of embodiment as well And for this, the connecting thread is prāṇa But before entering into the philosophical issues relating to the liberation of Bhuśuṇḍa, a few metaphors found in the poetic depiction deserve a closer look, as these metaphors buttress the argument for embodiment two prominent metaphors in the narrative are those of the pro-tagonist, Bhuśuṇḍa, and the Kalpa tree, his abode Bhuśuṇḍa is a crow born of the orgy of the male crow Caṇḍa the vehicle of Alambuṣā, and seven geese, the vehicle of sarasvatī This very birth of a hybrid crow indicates two different colors, the black crow and white geese The dei-ties that ride upon them match the color of their vehicles: sarasvatī is the goddess with the white complexion and Alambuṣā is a ferocious black deity The description of the birth of Bhuśuṇḍa identifies a tantric Kulayāga ritual, and just as tantric literature suggests the rit-ual union of Yoginīs and vīras in the Kulayāga resulting in the birth of a yoginībhū, our protagonist, although not explicitly claiming that he is one, indicates his noble birth, although in the body of a crow Woven into the tantric background, the metaphor of a wise bird is 3 J ürgen Hanneder, “Śaiva tantric Material in the Yogavāsiṣṭha,” Wiener Zeitschrift für die Kunde Südasiens und

scavenging dead bodies A crow is considered the mes-senger of Yama, the Lord of death, and the widow goddess, Dhūmāvatī, worshipped for the magical ritual of killing, who has a crow as her emblem A crow in Indian depiction is also an omen-creature, with the very term śakuna, referring to omen in sanskrit, also stands for ‘bird’ 4 Bhuśuṇḍa, the crow of our narrative, as if liberating the clan from their bad fame, stands for yoga, immortality, and the much-sought liberating wisdom This metaphor indicates that the yoga of Bhuśūṇḍa comes from the lower strata of the society, since a crow is considered untouchable in India The body of Bhuśūṇḍa is a meta-phor for bodies in general Bhuśūṇḍa nevertheless indicates that while there may not be a reason for clinging to the body, there is equally no point in rejecting it The next visible metaphor in the narrative is the Kalpadruma, the tree lasting till one kalpa In many cataclysmic events, Bhuśuṇḍa narrates that this tree is not even shaken Generally in Indian metaphor, a tree, with its deep roots of vāsanās, stands for the world, nested by birds that depict the individual selves (jīvāntan) A liberated being, in our case Bhuśuṇḍa, is sitting atop this tree, wit-nessing the events that occur in the lower spheres of the world Core to the argument of the metaphor is that although the body carries impurities, it is nevertheless instrumental to liberation since the experience of being liberated relies on being in the body, Bhuśuṇḍa’s being in the body provides the platform for this experience And the means for achieving jīvanmukti is the practice of the flow of prāṇa Thus the focus on prāṇa becomes a central differentiating factor of the specific yoga being discussed here from other contemplative tech-niques The metaphor of the Mount Meru parallels merudaṇḍa, the spine and thus binds the metaphor for the world to the metaphor for the body This relation is vivid in one instance from the YV, “the flames of the fire from the crater of this mountain appears as if the jāṭhara fire that has surged up to the head” (chap 14 18), that reso-nates of the yogic practice of Kuṇḍalinī while describing the glow of the mountain The practice of prāṇa as found in the YV is interconnected with Bhuśuṇḍa’s immortality Although human destiny is finite, being 4 For omen reading in India, see David Gordon White, “Predicting

immortality307identified as the ‘one that succumbs to death’ (martya), classical Indian literature is filled with multiple approaches to attain immortal-ity Four among them pertinent to this discourse highlight the balance of the binary opposites The vedic seers seek immortality through the libation of the cooling juice of soma into the fire, Agni The alchemists search for this immortality through the refinement of mercury with the application of sulfur tantrics find this through harmonizing the sexual fluids The haṭhayogins, the context of this paper, strive for immortality through the balance of two channels that are equated with the moon and the sun or fire The narrative of Bhuśuṇḍa loosely matches the narrative of Gorakṣanātha traditionally, Gorakṣa is con-sidered as one of the founders of haṭhayoga, while himself being a dis-ciple of Matsyendranātha, founder of the tantric Kaula lineage In the case of Bhuśuṇḍa, he regulates the flow of prāṇa and is thus a haṭhayogin, and is born of Caṇḍa and the mother goddesses, demon-strating his tantric origins Additionally, haṭhayoga literature and the discourse of Bhuśuṇḍa stress the practice of Kuṇḍalinī and the visual-ization of cakras. These elements also demonstrate an imprint of tantric philosophy two Yogas: Bhuśuṇḍa as vasịst.ha’s Counterpart Contrary to the conventional understanding of yoga and the percep-tion that Yogavāsiṣṭha is a manual for yogis, the overwhelming focus of the text is neither the Patañjalian practices nor haṭhayoga never-theless, if we follow this very text to define yoga, we do come to the understanding that yoga explains the methods for liberation from the world so that the practitioner can be united with the supreme reality If we oversimplify the approaches to this ‘union’, we can identify some physical approaches and other contemplative and thus mental approaches Analyzing yoga in two different ways resonates of the classic categorization found in the Bhagavadgītā (BhG) It provides an early account of two yogas: sāṃkhya yoga or the yoga of self-realiza-tion through contemplation upon the nature of the reality, and karma-yoga or the yoga of self-realization through action While expanding upon the discourse of karma, BhG also presents the yoga of concen-tration in the sixth chapter and this in particular is closer to the yoga in the discourse of Bhuśuṇḍa In sum, the yoga of Bhuśuṇḍa is the ces-sation of the pulsation of breathing (prāṇaspandanirodha) that gives"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"sthaneshwar timalsina308rise to the state of the dissolution of mental imprints (vāsanā), which in turn leads to immersion in the state of liberation while living (jīvanmukti) (YV 6 I 13 2) The text provides the root √yujir for the etymology of yoga, and identifies it as a method (yukti) for liberating from transmigration (13 3) The text, then, identifies two types of yoga: the realization of the self and the control of breath (13 4) elaborating upon this, vasiṣṭha states: “Although both types are iden-tified with the term yoga, it has been conventional [to use] this term in the method of prāṇa In the sequence of liberating from the world, one is yoga and the other is realization These both are considered equal approaches that give the same result” (YV 6 I 13 6-7)5 Both the practices of the contemplation upon the self and the breathing exercise are presented here as equal instruments for the pacification (upaśama) of mind (13 3) unlike the two distinct yogas discussed in BhG in which karma yoga is prescribed as being easier for practitioners, YV holds that the ascertainment through wisdom is eas-ier for some, while yoga, i e , the practice of prāṇa, is easier for others Just as Arjuna asks Kṛṣṇa to tell him which one of the two yogas is bet-ter (BhG, chap 3, 1-2), Rāma asks vasiṣṭha, traditionally the author of the text, which one of the yogas is easier (YV, vI 13 5) Although vasiṣṭha indicates that his preference is the determination through wisdom (jñāna-niścaya) (YV 6 I 13 8), telling that the yoga through dhāraṇā and āsana is not easy to practice (13 10), the chapter and the entire narrative is about yoga as opposed to the ascertainment of the reality through contemplation Described in terms of prāṇa and apāna (13 12), prāṇāyāma is identified as the central component of the yoga under consideration Placing the practice of prāṇa at the core of the practice also allows us to argue that the yoga of Bhuśuṇḍa is not iden-tical to Patañjalian yoga the Practice of Prān.aThe term prāṇa, central to the discourse of Bhuśuṇḍa, appears in its early use to describe embodied and lived breath that gives rise to the 5 prakārau dvāv api proktau yogaśabdena yady api |tathāpi rūḍhim āyātaḥ prāṇayuktāv asau

Recognition of prāṇa as means to self-realization becomes mean-ingful only when we take the term prāṇa to describe the supreme real-ity 7 This prāṇa sustains life and is found within the body and thus the term prāṇa relates to both phenomenal and absolute reality 8 early preceptors have apparently noticed this complementary nature of prāṇa in both maintaining the body and entering into the inner aspects of mind Prāṇāyāma as one of the six limbs of yoga is found in the Maitrāyaṇīya Upaniṣad (vI 18), the text generally dated as 2nd C bce 9 Likewise, in Patañjali’s Yogasūtra, prāṇāyāma is one of the eight limbs (Ys 2 29) Patañjali identifies four different types of prāṇāyāma (Ys 50-51) Defined as the suspension of breath, prāṇāyāma in the Patañjalian depiction varies depending upon the breath controlled after inhaling, after exhaling, and the third one, a sudden suspense of breathing The first one is identified as the inner suspension (ābhyān-tara), the second as external (bāhya) and the third one as the stilled mode (stambha vṛtti) (Ys 2 50) The fourth prāṇāyāma is when both the spheres identified in earlier practice are transcended vijñā-nabhikṣu identifies this fourth one as ‘isolated retention’ (kevala kumbhaka) 10 Although Gorakṣanātha also identifies four types of prāṇāyāma, he does not focus on four types of breath control, but rather identifies four different flows

Kashyap (Lucknow: utter Pradesh Hindi samsthan, 1973), chapter 32 Besides the Dharmaśāstra literature pointed out by Kane, the practice of breath control (prāṇāyāma) is also addressed in the

the constellation of different flows (saṅghaṭakaraṇa) 11since the yoga of Bhuśuṇḍa is the regulation of the flow of prāṇa, we can identify it with haṭhayoga 12 Haṭhayoga texts elaborate upon prāṇāyāma, identifying it as the means to liberation 13 This elevation of prāṇāyāma from the subordinate limb in Patañjali’s system to the direct means to liberation, as found in haṭhayoga texts, is congruent with Bhuśuṇḍa’s practice The etymology of haṭha, as provided by Gorakṣanātha is that “the syllable ‘ha’ refers to the sun and the syllable ‘ṭha’ to the moon It is called haṭhayoga due to the union of the sun and the moon ”14 Another definition of haṭha is that the letter ‘ha’ describes the solar channel iḍā and ‘ṭha’, the lunar channel piṅgalā, haṭhayoga thus describes the union of these two channels 15 Consistent with the practice of Bhuśuṇḍa and the haṭhayoga literature is the identification of yoga with the practice of prāṇāyāma The contemplation upon breathing and regulation of breath is addressed in YV as the ‘cogitation of the breath’ (prāṇacintā) From the verbal root √ciñ, with a general application of the term for ‘thoughts’, cintā often denotes mental agitation or anxiety In order to regulate the mind and control anxious thoughts, YV gives two differ-ent possibilities with an application of cintā Contemplation upon the self (ātma-cintā) reverses the regular course of mental agitation (chap 24 2, 4, 8) The second approach, prāṇa-cintā or the contem-plation of the life force, specifically describes the yoga course of Bhuśuṇḍa (chap 24, 9-10) 16Clearly, this yoga ties self-realization with bodily sensation Bhuśuṇḍa’s course of practice is related to the body, and he maintains his long life through the same yoga that grants him liberation In 11

and is dwelling in the house of the ego-sense (chap 24 15) The metaphors used in the text present the body as a house Following Bhuśuṇḍa’s description, an individual’s two ears represent two rooms on the upper floor, two eyes are compared with two windows, and the hair on the head as the thatch that covers the roof The mouth in this meta-phor is the main entrance to the house, two hands are identical to Bhuśuṇḍa’s two wings, and the upper and lower teeth are the garlands decorating the gateway The sense-organs are compared to the porters at the gate that convey the message inside, as these give the self the awareness of smell, touch, sight, etc The blood, fat, and flesh form the plaster of the abode, the veins and arteries metaphorically represent the strings to bind the wood in the house, and the big bones are like the posts that support the structure The three nerves, īḍā, piṅgalā, and suṣumnā, are at the center and in two sides of this body compared to a house (chap 24 16-20) The breath in the two channels of īḍā and piṅgalā spread throughout the body, being divided into a thousand threads through small fabrics comparable to the fibers of the stalks of lotus plants (chap 24 37) The constant gaze upon these two channels is what Bhuśuṇḍa credits for liberation, freeing him from all ties (chap 25 38) explicit in this metaphor of the body as the house is the awareness of ‘abiding in the house’, and this appears to be the response to the concept that one cannot achieve liberation while a gṛhastha or ‘one abiding in the house’ without renouncing the world In the narrative of Bhuśuṇḍa, the cakras inside the body articulate the flow of prāṇa throughout the body and this prāṇa governs all bodily functions According to this description, there are three sets of two cakras, meeting each other by facing up and down, endowed with soft lotus-petals (chap 24 22) These petals, becoming saturated with the inflowing air, bloom with the movement of the breath As the air moves in these cakras, its flow becomes stronger and affects the differ-ent cakras in multiple ways as it streams throughout the body This very air abiding in the heart is called prāṇa, apāna, samāna, and so on, identifying their distinct functions As the lunar radiance pervades the body, all the forces of prāṇa spread up and down in the threefold instrument of the heart (chap 24 26) The forces of prāṇa perform the following actions: they go, and they retrieve, they carry away and they stroll, they rise up and fall (chap 24 27) The very breath that moves the eyelids is called prāṇa for this specific function Another aspect of"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"sthaneshwar timalsina312the power of prāṇa assumes the form of touch, another flows through the nose thereby activating the sense of smell, some digest food, and others utter speech Just as an engineer moves an instrument, so also does the breath move the body (chap 24 30) The two breaths flowing up and down are identified as the carrier of the great machine (mahāyantravāha) that is the body, describing these two channels as the sun/fire and the moon (chap 24 33) Bhuśuṇḍa states that his days pass in the same way as does a person in deep sleep, since his breaths are equal in waking or deep sleep (chap 24 36) It is prāṇa that keeps the body alive Found in two different forms as prāṇa and apāna, the life-force constantly flows inside the body and is therefore identified as the power of pulsation (chap 25 3-4) While the term prāṇāyāma is often used to describe the process of the regulation of this flow, the text also uses the term in its literal mean-ing, just to describe the natural flow of prāṇa (chap 25 5) The exhal-ing of prāṇa outside from the heart is called recaka, the meeting of breaths twelve inches outside the nostrils is called pūraka When apāna enters body without any effort, this touch of filling is also called pūraka (chap 25 7-8) When apāna subsides into prāṇa and for as long as it does not rise again in the heart, this state is called kumbhaka (chap 25 9) Thus, recaka is located in the seat of the rise of apāna, below the position of twelve inches outside the nostrils, and outside (chap 25 10) It has been repeatedly iterated that the yoga of Bhuśuṇḍa is the yoga of the flow of prāṇa In this sense, yoga is union, its meaning derived from the root √yuj, that yokes prāṇa and apāna Bhuśuṇḍa gives a lengthy description of prāṇāyāma, the course of inhaling, exhaling, and holding the breath:[1] Those with an established mind consider that to be recaka, wherein the

mastery over it The crucial problem that arises with the yoga of Bhuśuṇḍa is how the tran-scendental self and corporeality are interlinked, as it is otherwise dif-ficult to relate the physical practice of prāṇāyāma with self-realization The text addresses this problem The self of the nature of awareness, as Bhuśuṇḍa identifies, is situated within prāṇa as fragrance resides within the flower, and this self is neither prāṇa nor apāna As taste is situated within water, so is the self of the nature of awareness located within apāna and it is neither prāṇa nor apāna The self is at the cul-mination of, and in the middle of, prāṇa and apāna (YV, 6 I 25 61-63) The self, in this depiction, is thus not transcendental to the body, but rather its living essence The intermediate state between prāṇa and apāna, in this depiction, is where the self is revealed and the self is realized through abiding in this state Retention of breath focused within the heart is identified as the kumbhaka of prāṇa and the one performed outside is the retention of apāna and with the practice of holding the breath, one resides next to consciousness itself (chap 25 69-72) Bhuśuṇḍa’s description of prāṇāyāma strikingly parallels the detail found in Mālinīvijayottara 17 2-10ab According to this text, there are six variants of inhalation, having three variants based on the locus of nose, mouth, and upper palate to two different forms of inhalation, identified as neutral and the one performed after expulsion (virecya) 23 The text also categorizes retention with five variants: following inhala-tion, following exhalation, two variants during the intermediate point, and the neutral one 24 Along the same lines, there are six variants of exhalation that follows the same sequence as inhalation other termi-nology such as dvādaśānta is commonplace to both Bhuśuṇḍa’s dis-course and tantric literature the Perfections of Bhuśun.d.aThe impression Bhuśuṇḍa gives in the narrative is that

aspect, are intertwined and are the direct consequence of the practice of prāṇa Both prāṇa and jīvanmukti place Bhuśuṇḍa ‘in between’: prāṇa is in between the body and the self and bridges both, jīvanmukti is in between corporeality and liberation that grants both Bhuśuṇḍa relates that he has neither the desire to live, nor to die and abandon the karmic body (20 21) His condition of being alive is just the way things are, and he is not inclined to change the way things are The highest siddhi of Bhuśuṇḍa is his self-realization that is described in both terms: one, he is abiding in the essential non-dual consciousness only, and next, he is free from emotions, the fetters of bondage These two aspects of self-realization are highlighted throughout the entire narrative Bhuśuṇḍa knows and speaks about the unmanifest, and he is free from the thoughts of me and mine (chap 15 33) Crucial to Bhuśuṇḍa’s perfection is his awareness of time Having aligned time with the flow of prāṇa, this awareness does not measure time in isolated moments, but in the form of uninterrupted kalpa (YV 20 24) He nevertheless knows with his intellect the sequence of space and time, although not tied to the awareness of day and night (YV 20 8, 25) Here, Bhuśuṇḍa is making an effort to distinguish his time-perception from the usual perception of time: ordinarily, time is cog-nized in the form of day and night, and the time-awareness such as that of kalpa is given to us only intellectually and not directly Bhuśuṇḍa’s perception of time is quite the opposite Bhuśuṇda describes his techniques to sustain himself while the chain of dissolution of the fundamental elements begins at the end of each eon When the dissolution of the world begins, he floats in the sky without any motion, abandoning his longtime abode, the Kalpa tree (21 15-16) When in the process of cataclysmic events, Bhuśuṇḍa describes going through a series of dhāraṇās:When the suns heat up, turning the mountains to rocks, I abide with an undisturbed mind, having focused my concentration upon water (vāruṇī dhāraṇā) When the wind of dissolution start blowing the kings of mountains turning them into rocks, I abide in the

(chap 26 11) When he describes these two flowing up and down his body, he declares that he maintains his indif-ference to heat and cold by gazing upon the breath (chap 24 32) Bhuśuṇḍa further claims

The self-realization of Bhuśuṇḍa places his subjective awareness in the witnessing consciousness (sākṣin) The depiction of Bhuśuṇḍa in this narrative shows the nature of the individual self when it with-draws from the outside world and resides in consciousness itself that is all-witnessing The metaphors found in the text further describe him as the witness of the world phenomena Bhuśuṇḍa is wise, due to his long life wherein he has witnessed the conditions of the rise and fall of ages (yuga) (chap 15 30) He has been counting the cycle of eons (kalpa) and the repeated birth of the protective gods (lokapālas) (chap 15 31) In Chapter 22, the everlasting crow claims to have witnessed the world as topsy-turvy and not in any fixed order He claims to have witnessed the world turned into dust, and the earth before the appear-ance of sun and moon The cyclical nature of time is confirmed with the crow claiming that he remembers infinite numbers of Manus, one in every eon But Bhuśuṇḍa also claims to be the witness to different world orders sometimes he witnesses polyandry; he also remembers human progeny spreading without copulation; he sometimes wit-nesses creation occurring in a void, without earth or any foundation Bhuśuṇḍa also witnesses creation emanating from the sky and at other times from water or air or earth He has also witnessed viṣṇu emerg-ing as viṣṇu and viṣṇu transforming into Rudra Bhuṣuṇḍa claims that he has witnessed eight births of vasiṣṭha; he has seen the earth sinking five times; he has witnessed the churning of the ocean twelve times, the subduing of Hiraṇyākṣa three times, the birth of Paraśurāma six times, one hundred repetitions the age of Kali, and one hundred rebirths of Lord viṣṇu in the form of the Buddha vālmīki composed his Rāmāyaṇa twelve times over and vyāsa composed the Mahā-bhārata seven times, nṛsiṃha killed Hiraṇyakaśipu three times, and Kṛṣṇa was born sixteen times The lengthy articulation of Bhuśuṇḍa’s recollection of previous creations gives a different picture of time: it is not linear, as there is a repetition of events; neither is it circular, as creation does not repeat in exactly

the other, as shown with gods such as Brahmā and viṣṇu appearing to be coming back, yet assuming the task of another god In this chaotic progression, randomness appears to be the only law And in the eyes of Bhuśuṇḍa, time does not make much sense, since he claims that eons pass for him in the same way as do days and nights Compared to the gaze of timelessness, all that is confined within time is similar The following reference explicitly describes the absurdity of sequence:I remember the three worlds having an identical assemblage sequence and many [others] having different [ones] or half identical [assem-blage] in the same way (YV, 6 I 22 35)27Brāhman! In every manvantara, when the sequence of the world is reversed and the structure is altered and the wise people have passed away, I have different friends, different relatives, different and new servants, and different habitations (YV, 6 I 22 37-38)28Bhuśuṇḍa’s continuity in the same body during different kalpas paral-lels the manifestation of the same Kalpa tree in every eon nevertheless, the location in which this tree grows keeps changing, as in different kalpas, it shifts from Mount Meru to other mountains such as vindhya, Kaccha, sahya, Dardura, Hima, or Malayācala The concept of karma and rebirth, in this paradigm, is not restricted only to humans The Kalpa tree is reborn in every eon in the same fashion, due to the karma of its previous life even after abandoning its body at the end of one manvantara, the tree retains its life with its new birth In this narrative, Bhuśuṇḍa’s awareness of time parallels his con-sciousness of the external world Just as Bhuśuṇḍa perceives time not in the form of isolated minutes but in the form of kalpa, he also claims that he is situated in consciousness itself that is not fragmented into concepts or divided in the form of subject and

placing his awareness directed towards the stainless self (chap 26 1) This equanimity of mind, free from emotion and the flow of thoughts, is identified as ‘seeing’ (dṛṣṭi) This singular dṛṣṭi is free from errors and is imperishable (chap 24 1), and Bhuśuṇḍa claims to be established in this dṛṣṭi (chap 26 2) This ‘seeing’ of Bhuśuṇḍa is not disturbed even when his seat, Mount Meru moves This gaze or awareness of Bhuśuṇḍa is identified as complete absorption (susamādhi) that is not interrupted even when he is walk-ing or sitting, or is awake or in deep sleep (chap 26 3) There is no past or future but only the present in this ‘seeing’ (chap 26 8) The state of mind that is free from mental constructions including time-aware-ness is compared to suṣupti, as it does not grasp any external object (chap 26 9) YV addresses jīvanmukti, liberation while living As slaje points out, “the Mokṣopāya belongs to the oldest texts that know of the con-cept of, and at the same time make deliberate use of, the technical term, jīvanmukti” 29 As the narrative of Bhuśuṇḍa begins with a chap-ter giving a preface that uses the term ‘jīvanmukta’, it becomes con-textual to address this concept in light of the highest perfection of Bhuśuṇḍa Although yogic practice in general is not the central theme of YV, the narrative in this context is about yoga, the yoga of the prāṇa and apāna This particular yoga is neither contemplation upon the empty nature of the objective world, nor is it about “gaining insight into the absolute non-existence (atyantābhāva) of the world by ‘reflec-tion’ (vicāra) only,”30 but simply the ‘rise of the dissolution of mental imprints’ (vāsanāvilayodaya) through the practice of prāṇa 31 The state of jīvanmukti, in light of this narrative, arises due to the dissolu-tion of vāsanā that results through the instrumentality of the ‘cessa-tion of the pulsation of prāṇa’ (prāṇaspandanirodha) (YV 6 I 13 2) Although the general course of contemplation as taught in YV is through questions such as “Who am I?” and “Whose is transmigra-tion?” and although vasiṣṭha acknowledges that yoga is hard to prac-29 Walter slaje, “Liberation from Intentionality and

10), Bhuśuṇḍa does attain the state of jīvanmukti, with his practice of the cessation of the flow of breath Therefore, it is difficult to reductively conclude that YV in general teaches liberation only through the practice of jñāna and not through the practice of yoga Actually the text is explicit that “for some, yoga is hard to accomplish, and for others, the determination [is] through jñāna” (YV, chap 13, 8) 32two modalities of liberation found in this discourse make us con-template upon samādhi, a term used in different contexts Patañjali describes in his Yogasūtra various types of samādhi with a specific dis-tinction between samprajñāta and asamprajñāta The samādhis attained through different methods, the haṭha means through which a yogin attains the mindless state and thus recognizes the way things are, and the samādhi attained through full awakening through dis-criminating knowledge following the path of jñāna, may not be the same experience Buddhist literature demonstrates a similar contrast between two nirodha and āsaṃjñi samāpattis 33 In the case of Bhuśuṇḍa, as in other haṭha depictions, there is a yogic integration (samādhi) that describes “a reversal of the flow of time, immortality and transcendence over the entire created universe ”34near the end of the discourse between the two sages, Bhuśuṇḍa declares that he has obtained a completely serene mind through absorption in prāṇa (prāṇasamādhi) (chap 26 1) He further describes that his well-focused absorption (susamādhi) into the self is not dis-turbed while walking or sitting, even while awake, dreaming, or in deep sleep (chap 26 3) even when the air stops moving or waters no longer flow, Bhuśuṇḍa declares that he does not remember anything contrary to his absolute absorption (susamādhāna) (chap 26 5) Therefore, before reaching to the conclusion that YV does not pre-scribe any physical practice of yoga or that it does not favor yogic 32 The text identifies the yoga of Bhuśuṇḍa as jñānayoga: Bhuśuṇḍa obtained that which needs to be obtained with jñāna yoga (chap 28 3) The knowledge that Bhuśuṇḍa has is that of the flow of prāṇa and apāna 33 For discussion on two

to give a closer look to the nar-rative of Bhuśuṇḍa In conclusion, the narrative of Bhuśuṇḍa presents a form of haṭha-yoga known to the author of YV, and this exposition varies from the general tendency of the text to highlight the illusory nature of the world The immortality of Bhuśuṇḍa merges with his liberating wis-dom, linking somatic experience to mental conditioning Although corporeality is subordinated by the depiction of an immortal crow’s lineage in a despised species, the approach of Bhuśuṇḍa is world-affirming and the self-realization that results from the practice of prāṇa is not subordinate to jñāna, as vasiṣṭha, the proponent of this method and also the main voice throughout the text, comes to learn from Bhuśuṇḍa The combination of Advaita and tantric elements found in the subsequent haṭhayoga literature is consistent in the dis-course of Bhuśuṇḍa and the quest for jīvanmukti in the literal sense of combining the both permanent life and full awakening resonates of the integration of alchemy by the haṭhayoga masters Liberation, in this depiction, is not an isolation of consciousness from afflictions but rather a perfect union of two opposites, depicted in the bipolar terms of the sun and moon This narrative is an exemplary dialogue where two enlightened participants, while maintaining their positions, are willing to learn from and appreciate each other The dialogue of Bhuśuṇḍa and vasiṣṭha also challenges the over-simplified compari-son of the state of liberation to a form of solipsism This is not a dia-logue imagined by someone under illusion, as both characters in the narrative are enlightened The narrative of Bhuśuṇḍa, therefore, is one illustration that serves multiple purposes within the wider textual context, and while challenging some assumptions, Bhuśuṇḍa’s dis-course brings siddhis to the forefront and makes them complemen-tary to self-realization ReferencesBrockington, John “Yoga in the Mahābhārata ”

either directly or indirectly as a result of the practice of yoga or tantric rites 4The oldest traditions of haṭhayoga are informed by tantric yoga, both Śaiva and Pāñcarātrika, and traditions of brahmanical yoga found in, for example, the original Skandapurāṇa and the Mārkaṇḍeya-purāṇa 5 In a secondary stage of its development haṭhayoga was appropriated by practitioners in the traditions of Western trans-mission (Paścimāmnāya) and, subsequently, southern transmission (Dakṣiṇāmnāya) Kaula Śaivism 6 It is this Kaula-influenced form of 1 J ames Mallinson, Yoga and Yogis: The Texts, Techniques and Practitioners of Traditional Haṭhayoga (forthcoming) 2 These works are the Amṛtasiddhi, Dattātreyayogaśāstra, Gorakṣaśataka, Vivekamārtaṇḍa, Khecarīvidyā, Yogabīja, Amaraughaprabodha and Śivasaṃhitā to these may be added the Amaraughaśāsana, which, although not used to compile it, is likely to predate the Haṭhapradīpikā and teaches variants of the practices classified therein as mudrās, practices which set haṭhayoga apart from other varieties of yoga There is one text not written in sanskrit which teaches the haṭhayogic mudrās and predates the Haṭhapradīpikā: the old Marāṭhī Jñāneśvarī, on which see Catherine Kiehnle, “The secret of the nāths: The Ascent of Kuṇḍalinī according to Jñāneśvarī 6 151-328,” Bulletin des Études Indiennes 22-23 (2005): 447-494 3 The Haṭhapradīpikā can be dated to approximately 1450 ce (Christian Bouy, Les Nātha-Yogin et les Upaniṣads [Paris: Diffusion de Boccard, 1994], 81-85) 4 They can also arise as a result of birth, herbal preparations or asceticism: janm-uṣadhimantratapaḥsamādhijāḥ siddhayaḥ (Yogasūtra 4 1) 5 These oldest traditions of haṭhayoga are found in the Amṛtasiddhi and Dattātreyayogaśāstra 6 The Western

late manifestation and reformation of the siddhi-oriented Śaivism of the Mantramārga, which, “though it accommo-dates the quest for liberation, is essentially concerned with the quest for supernatural experience ”7 This ‘supernatural experience’ takes the form of both the attainment of siddhis and the enjoyment of other-worldly pleasures (bhoga) 8In its earliest manifestations, haṭhayoga was the preserve of the mumukṣu, the seeker of liberation (mokṣa), rather than the bubhukṣu, the seeker of enjoyment (bhoga) After its appropriation by various Kaula traditions, haṭhayoga incorporated their subtle physiology but did away with their complex and exclusive bhoga-oriented systems of initiation, mantras and maṇḍalas, together with the direct quest for siddhis texts on haṭhayoga from the period of its appropriation by the heirs of the Kaulas betray a heightened preoccupation with siddhis but this is absent in its subsequent classical reformation in texts such as the fifteenth-century Haṭhapradīpikā and the seventeenth-century Haṭharatnāvalī Intentional and unintentional Siddhisonly two texts in the corpus of sanskrit works on early haṭhayoga, the Dattātreyayogaśāstra and the Yogabīja, voice explicitly the under-standing of siddhis which is implicit throughout most of the corpus In the Dattātreyayogaśāstra the many powerful siddhis which arise in the second of haṭhayoga’s four avasthās or ‘stages’, the ghaṭāvasthā, are said to be obstacles to mahāsiddhi, ‘the great siddhi’, and the wise yogi is instructed not to delight in his powers, nor to show them to anyone else He should behave like a fool in order to keep his powers hidden; if not he will attract a large number of disciples, busy with whom he will neglect his practice and become absorbed in worldly concerns 9 The Yogabīja distinguishes between two types of siddhi: 7 Alexis sanderson, “Śaivism and the tantric traditions,” in The World’s Reli-gions, ed s sutherland, L Houlden,

impermanent and of little potency The same siddhis occur spontaneously, but uninten-tionally, in the master yogi, in which case they are permanent and very powerful These spontaneous siddhis have no purpose; they simply signify one who has mastered yoga and are signs on the path to mokṣa like the many tīrthas seen by pilgrims on the way to Kāśī one can identify a perfected master, liberated while living, by the attainment of such siddhis 10The attitude towards siddhis made clear in the Dattātreyayogaśāstra reflects that found in the Yogasūtra, namely that siddhis are obstacles to the goal of yoga practice 11 In the Yogasūtra, however, explicit instructions are given on how to achieve the various siddhis If the yogi wants divine hearing, for example, he should practice saṃyama on the relationship between hearing and the ether (3 41) Intentional siddhis of this sort are not taught in mainstream haṭhayogic texts 12The lack of importance given to siddhis in the majority of the texts of haṭhayoga results in their akalpitā variety not always being distin-guished from trivial or even undesirable by-products of practice, par-ticularly in its early stages Thus at Amaraughaśāsana 9 2, Kuṇḍalinī’s ascent of the central channel is said to bring about trembling and fainting as well as the ability to attract and see distant objects In the Dattātreyayogaśāstra, the perfection of unassisted breath retention (kevala kumbhaka) means that nothing in the three worlds is difficult to attain Increasing durations of its practice result in, in sequence, sweating, trembling, jumping

evinced by the corpus The Amṛtasiddhi is almost certainly the oldest text on haṭhayoga, dat-ing to the twelfth or perhaps eleventh century ce, and it is exemplary of the attitude towards siddhis of the mumukṣu, the seeker of libera-tion The Śivasaṃhitā, which can be dated to the fourteenth or fif-teenth centuries, is one of the youngest texts in the corpus and teaches haṭhayoga for the bubhukṣu, the seeker of supernatural experience Siddhi in the AmṚtasiddhiThe sectarian origins of the Amṛtasiddhi are unclear In its colophons it is ascribed to either Mādhavacandra or Avadhūtacandra and is said to represent the teachings of virūpākṣa Although it has been claimed that this means that the text was produced by the nātha saṃpradāya on the grounds that virūpākṣa was a ‘nātha siddha’,19 this is unlikely, not least because the text predates the appearance of a nātha saṃpradāya by several centuries20 and possibly also the life of its alleged founder, Gorakṣa 21 external evidence suggest that the Amṛtasiddhi may have been produced by forerunners of the Dasnāmī saṃnyāsīs 2219 Kurtis R schaeffer, “The Attainment of Immortality: from nāthas in India to Buddhists in tibet,” Journal of Indian Philosophy 30 (2002): 515-533 I enclose the phrase ‘nātha siddha’ within quotation marks because it is not to be found in pre-modern Indic literature 20 The earliest example that I have found of the word ‘nātha’ being used to describe a saṃpradāya of yogis is in a manuscript from Jodhpur of a text called the Ādeśapadavyākhyā The manuscript appears to have been written in the early part of the nineteenth century, when the nāthas had a brief period of influence over the Jodhpur court The c 1700 Siddhasiddhāntapaddhati mentions nātha as one of five yogi lineages (5 43) The earliest reference to yogis being divided into twelve panths, an important (if only nominal) feature of nātha identity to this day, is in a vār writ-ten by Bhāī Gurdās in 1604 (Vāraṅ Bhāī Gurdās 8 13) 21 The earliest datable reference to Gorakṣa is in the Amṛtakaṇikodyotanibandha, a sub-commentary on the Āryamañjuśrīnāmasaṃgīti (p 202, l 18) of vibhūticandra, who flourished in the first half of the thirteenth century (stearns 1996) I am grateful to Professor Harunaga Isaacson for drawing my attention to this reference 22 Śiva as virūpākṣa was the tutelary deity of the first rulers of vijayānagara, who in the fourteenth century patronised an advaita maṭha at Śṛṅgeri which later became one of the first Dasnāmī saṃnyāsī monastic institutions The vijayānagara mon-archs had earlier had Kālāmukha gurus who may have introduced them to the cult of virūpākṣa (Matthew Clark, The Daśanāmī-Saṃnyāsīs: The Integration of Ascetic Lineages into an Order [Leiden: Brill, 2006], 198) 19

he wants, until he decides to exit his body through the ‘Gateway of Brahmā’ (brahmadvāra) and go to final liberation (mahāmukti) The Amṛtasiddhi makes no mention of Kuṇḍalinī nor of cakras The siddhis in the Amṛtasiddhi are very much of the akalpitā vari-ety described in the Yogabīja: they are signposts on the way to mahāsiddhi In what follows, I shall describe the various benefits and powers that arise in the course of the practice of the Amṛtasiddhi’s yoga The basis of the Amṛtasiddhi’s yoga is the three practices called mahāmudrā, mahābandha and mahāvedha, and it is the first text to teach these important haṭhayogic techniques Mahāmudrā gets rid of impurities, nourishes the nāḍīs, steadies bindu and nāda, and kindles the digestive fire (11 6) no subsidiary benefits are said to result from the practice of mahābandha, which reverses the natural downwards flow of the nāḍīs (12 8), nor from mahāvedha, which brings about the breath’s piercing of the three knots and the opening of the Gateway of Brahmā Knowledge of this triad of practices brings knowledge of the three worlds The yogi becomes an omnipotent and omnipresent god and has the ability and entitlement to do what he wants (13 10-15) There are four stages (avasthās) on the yogi’s path: ārambha, ghaṭa, paricaya and niṣpatti When the yogi is established in his practice, but before he reaches the first stage, physical signs of progress start to appear as a result of the increasing mastery of the breath: the constitu-ents of his body (dhātus) increase, he does not suffer disease and his body becomes firm and strong (viveka 14) once established in the ārambhāvasthā, the yogi hears various ‘unstruck’ (anāhata) sounds, his body shines, he develops great diges-tive fire and strength, and a fine intellect, and he becomes completely beautiful and fragrant (viveka 19) In the ghaṭāvasthā, his posture (āsana) becomes firm, knowledge (jñāna) arises, he becomes like a god, he is physically powerful, he knows the truth (tattva), he knows what is to be done (vidhi), indeed he knows everything; he behaves auspiciously, he is endowed with all auspicious signs and he is free found in the Śivasaṃhitā,

pain and sorrow (viveka 24) An auspi-cious sound arises, which is a sign that success (siddhi) is near at hand (viveka 25) As a result of the mastery of the breath achieved in the paricayāvasthā, external powers (bāhyasiddhis) of a more supernatu-ral nature arise: the yogi can transport his own body and gain entry to someone else’s city, and he can see and hear distant objects (viveka 28) He attains omniscience (viveka 29) In the final stage, niṣpattya-vasthā, when the breath pierces the knot of Rudra (rudragranthi) the sound of a large kettledrum is heard Mahāsiddhi arises, which bestows jīvanmukti, liberation while living All-knowing and all-see-ing, his hearing, sight, bliss and knowledge are unimpeded He is endowed with all powers (these are variously called aiśvaryas, guṇas and siddhis) He cannot be burnt, drowned or harmed Happy, he can create worlds, angry he can destroy them He frightens the gods such siddha yogis can remain thus for hundreds of thousands of years (viveka

the Amṛtasiddhi within a spe-cific tradition, internal and external evidence points to the Śivasaṃhitā being the product of the orthodox tradition of the Śaṅkarācāryas of Kanchi and shringeri, a tradition which came to be incorporated within the Daśanāmī saṃnyāsī saṃpradāya 2323 The Śivasaṃhitā includes teachings influenced by both advaita vedānta and Śrīvidyā, the latter a purified form of southern transmission Kaula Śaivism These two traditions formed the doctrinal basis of the Śṛṅgerī maṭha The Śivasaṃhitā also borrows from and extensively paraphrases the Dattātreyayogaśāstra, a text which is the product of a tradition of vaiṣṇava yogis later incorporated within the Daśanāmī saṃpradāya The Śivasaṃhitā does not, however, borrow significantly from texts such as the

good complexion, and makes him a receptacle for the nectar of the gods He thus attains the first stage of yoga, the ārambhāvasthā (3 29-30) In the second stage, the ghaṭāvasthā, the yogi has a strong digestive fire, eats well, is happy, has a beautiful body, is big-hearted and has great willpower and strength (3 33) Interpolated in the description of the four avasthās is a passage on the things to be avoided or cultivated while practicing yoga (3 34a-44b), followed by a passage on breath retention (kumbhaka) which is a reworking of a similar passage in the Dattātreyayogaśāstra 25 In the course of his mastering unassisted breath retention (kevala kumbhaka),26 the yogi first sweats, then trembles, then jumps about like a frog and finally moves about in the sky When the yogi leaves the ground,

the yogi can support himself on one thumb once he has reached the paricayāvasthā the yogi can practice the five elemental dhāraṇās on five locations in the body He thus gains the siddhis of earth and the other elements and does not die even in a hundred deaths of Brahmā (3 72-75) In the course of his practice the yogi finally attains the niṣpattyavasthā, thereby breaking free of karma and drinking the nec-tar of immortality (amṛta) He can enter samādhi at will (3 76-77) This passage on the four avasthās is followed by one describing var-ious ways of inhaling air and, by means of an unnamed khecarīmudrā, drinking the liquid from the moon (3 80-95) These result in the yogi defeating disease, fatigue, old age and death, obtaining the powers of long-distance hearing and sight, becoming Bhairava, obtaining the eight classical siddhis, conquering the elements, becoming a second god of love, becoming neither hungry nor thirsty, neither sleeping nor fainting, being able to move

taught: siddhāsana brings about the niṣpattyavasthā and the yogi can use it to reach his ultimate destination (3 99); padmāsana gets rid of all dis-eases (3 105) and by correctly inhaling while

unlike the Amṛtasiddhi, however, the Śivasaṃhitā includes verses describing the benefits of the practice (4 41-42): it nourishes the body, makes the skeleton strong, fills the yogi’s heart and allows him to achieve all that he wants The practical details of the mahāvedha of the Śivasaṃhitā are somewhat different from those of the Amṛtasiddhi’s, but like that of the latter it is said to enable the yogi to use the breath to pierce the knots in the central channel and open the Gateway of Brahmā In both the Amṛtasiddhi and the Śivasaṃhitā, the gods situated along the cen-tral channel are said to tremble thanks to the rising wind; the Śivasaṃhitā adds (4 46) that Kuṇḍalinī comes to rest at Kailāsa The Śivasaṃhitā further adds that the yogi thereby achieves the siddhi of wind, which gets rid of old age and death, and that by regular practice of mahāvedha, mahāmudrā and mahābandha he is sure to conquer death within six months (4 48) Khecarīmudrā (4 51-4 59) brings about perfection of the

of siddhis to give just one example, meditation on the mūlādhāra lotus results in the ability to leave the ground like a frog (dardurīsiddhi), a very beau-tiful body, increased digestive fire, good

the immediate destruction of all sins, the attainment of whatever is wanted and, eventually, complete (sakalā) siddhi (5 87-101) And that is just the first lotus Finally, at 5 232-252, mantrayoga is taught By means of increasing numbers of repetitions of a three-syllabled mantra (from 100,00 to 10,000,000), together with ritual fire-offerings, the yogi summons the goddess tripurabhairavī and attains another bewildering array of siddhis, including the subju-gation of all beings, mortal and divine, and culminating in the attain-ment of the state of Śiva There is thus a marked difference between the treatment of siddhi in the Amṛtasiddhi and its treatment in the Śivasaṃhitā The goal of the Amṛtasiddhi is the great siddhi, liberation, and the lesser siddhis which arrive along the way

Śivasaṃhitā’s promotion of siddhis is concomitant with its Kaula bubhukṣu heritage The most explicitly Kaula text in the early corpus of haṭhayogic texts, the Khecarīvidyā, takes a similar position At the end of its first paṭala, khecarīmudrā is said to bestow a wide range of siddhis—in fact it is said to bestow all the siddhis that exist in the three worlds—including ones not mentioned elsewhere in the haṭhayogic corpus but common in Kaula works (where they are usu-ally kalpitā, ‘intentional’) such as finding buried treasure, entering subterranean realms, controlling the earth, mastering alchemy,30 win-ning power over male and female genies, and procuring magical san-dals, swords and elixirs 31 In the second paṭala, accessing the different stores of amṛta in the body is said to make the whole gamut of siddhis available to the yogi 32 In the Khecarīvidyā’s fourth paṭala various herbal preparations are said to bestow various physical benefits, in particular rejuvenation 30 Pace

and alchemists] were at least closely linked in their practice”, the Khecarīvidyā’s assertion that khecarīmudrā can give the yogi the siddhi of alchemy suggests that the practitioners of haṭhayoga and alchemy were quite distinct This is also implied by the Khecarīvidyā’s deliberate trumping of alchemical practice with its technique of aṅgamardana (Khecarīvidyā 2 72-79, on which see Mallinson, The Khecarīvidyā of Ādinātha, 220 n 328) other works also teach that the techniques of haṭhayoga can bestow alchemical siddhi In both the Śivasaṃhitā (3 61) and Dattātreyayogaśāstra (197) it is said that

Haṭhapradīpikā is a compilation of earlier works on haṭha and other methods of yoga whose teachings are synthesised into a new classical haṭhayoga consisting of four types of practice: āsana, kumb-haka, mudrā and nādānusandhāna (1 56) The Haṭhapradīpikā became haṭhayoga’s locus classicus and its teachings formed the basis of most subsequent texts on the subject Its combination of verses from various different texts is remarkable for its inclusivity, even if this does lead to some inconsistencies In spite of its inclusivity, how-ever, the Haṭhapradīpikā represents a successful attempt to appropri-ate haṭhayoga by a siddha tradition which traced its lineage through Kaula teachers such as Matsyendra and Gorakṣa, and which was, at the time of the Haṭhapradīpikā’s composition, starting to coalesce into the order which would several centuries later become known as that of the nāthas It is striking that the Haṭhapradīpikā, despite bor-rowing over 40 verses from texts associated with orders of yogis that were, at the time of its composition, beginning to coalesce into the Daśanāmī and Rāmānandī saṃpradāyas, makes no mention of their legendary teachers, in particular Dattātreya, from whose yogaśāstra the Haṭhapradīpikā borrows 20 verses 33The haṭhayogic tradition represented by the Amṛtasiddhi and Dattā treyayogaśāstra is likely, at least on textual evidence, to predate that linked with Matsyendra and Gorakṣa The former teaches a yoga that uses the breath to raise bindu upwards along the central channel, piercing three knots along the way The latter superimposes Kuṇḍalinī and the cakras or padmas onto this system 34 This superimposition results in some problems The aim of the bindu-oriented yoga is to keep bindu in the head; the Kuṇḍalinī-based systems want to flood the body with amṛta, bindu’s analogue The primacy of the bindu para-digm can be inferred from its being found in the systems of yoga taught in the Amṛtasiddhi and Dattātreyayogaśāstra in which Kuṇḍa-33 Kapila, who is the first siddha to be associated with haṭhayoga (Dattātreya-yogaśāstra 57) is also not mentioned in the Haṭhapradīpikā vasiṣṭha is mentioned

centuries, a reconciliation legitimized in texts such as the Gorakṣasiddhān tasaṃgraha and Yogisaṃpradāyāviṣkṛti 34 These two paradigms of the practice of haṭhayoga are summarized at

Śivasaṃhitā, which postdate the Vivekamārtaṇḍa by approximately a century The Haṭhapradīpikā, while incorporating several verses from these later works, reflects the mumukṣu attitude towards siddhis It relegates sid-dhis to a place of even less importance than that which they hold in the Vivekamārtaṇḍa Physical practices such as āsana, kumbhaka and the ṣaṭkarmas have, unsurprisingly, physical benefits as well as bene-fits which further the yogi’s progress towards mokṣa,37 but supernatu-ral siddhis are rare A handful are mentioned in the context of the mudrās taught in the third upadeśa,38

haṭhayogic corpus does not pre-scribe direct means to intentional siddhis; its siddhis arise uninten-tionally as by-products of techniques which lead to mahāsiddhi, the great siddhi, namely liberation while living Thus, in contrast to what one might expect, the Haṭhapradīpikā and the majority of the texts of early haṭhayoga are less concerned with the supernatural than the Yogasūtra (and many tantric works), since they proscribe intentional striving after siddhis and make no ref-erence to occult siddhis such as parakāyapraveśana and utkrānti which are taught, or at least mentioned, in the Yogasūtra and Kaula-influenced haṭhayogic works such as the Khecarīvidyā and Śivasaṃ-hitā 4441 Particularly noteworthy is the absence of cakras or padmas in the Haṭha-pradīpikā’s subtle physiology, in spite of Kuṇḍalinī’s primacy in the text Perhaps, in his quest for inclusivity, amidst a plethora of different cakra systems (the six/seven padma system of the Paścimāmnāya was yet to achieve hegemony) svātmārāma did not want to alienate any groups by prioritising one particular system 42 see, for example, the benefits associated with the kumbhakas and ṣaṭkarmas taught in the Haṭhapradīpikā’s second upadeśa 43 see, for example, the Dattātreyayogaśāstra, in which the siddhis obtained by means of mantra°, laya° and rājayoga are very similar to those obtained by haṭhayoga, or the Amanaskayoga, which roundly condemns the practices of haṭhayoga (see in particular Amanaskayoga 2 31 and 2 42), but whose non-physical yoga is said to achieve a wide range of siddhis similar to those found in haṭhayogic texts 44 Parakāyapraveśana and utkrānti are the results of particular saṃyamas taught at Yogasūtra 2 38-39 Parakāyapraveśana is mentioned as a siddhi at Śivasaṃhitā 3 60 and

for a marginalization and ‘magicalization’ of tantra which seems to have occurred in parallel with the rise of bhakti in early mod-ern north India since the early twentieth century, the history of bhakti has gener-ally been told in terms of ‘the bhakti movement ’2 As typically con-ceived, “the bhakti movement” was “a transformatory avalanche in terms of devotion and social reform” that began in south India between the sixth and ninth centuries ce with the Śaiva nāyaṇārs and vaiṣṇava Āḷvārs and swept its way across the subcontinent and into the north as a single, coherent movement 3 This relatively recent term 1 I am indebted to Rachel McDermott, Jon Keune, Allison Busch, and John s Hawley for their detailed and thoughtful comments and suggestions on an earlier draft of this essay 2 on the trope of the ‘bhakti movement,’ see John s Hawley, “Introduction: The Bhakti Movement—says Who?”, International Journal of Hindu Studies 11, no 3 (2007): 209-25 3 After originating in the tamil south, bhakti is typically described as having made its way northward (often in decayed form) into Karnataka and Andrah, then traveling to Maharashtra and Gujarat, and finally entering into north

development of bhakti while glossing over significant qualitative dif-ferences in the form and style of bhakti practiced in various regions 4 In this essay, ‘bhakti movement’ does not refer to any such single, coherent, India-wide rise of emotional devotional religion Rather it is meant to serve as a convenient if imperfect term denoting the histori-cal fact, beginning especially in the sixteenth century, of the develop-ment in north India (namely the Gangetic plains, Rajasthan, and the Panjab, but to an extent also including Bengal and west-central India) of a diverse set of communities linked by (a) their emphasis on per-sonal devotion to God (as opposed to ritual or the practice of tapas), a devotion infused with a certain emotion often expressed in song;5 (b) their production of written literature based on the lives and poetry of bhakti saints such as nāmdev, Kabīr, nānak, Raidās, and sūrdās, among others; and, (c) their opposition to a form of religiosity most 4 The narrative of the ‘bhakti movement’ and the conceptions of bhakti associ-ated with it are especially problematic in that their origins lie in a complex mixture of colonial Christian motivations, orientalist scholarship, and Indian (Hindu) nationalist projects As I have noted in another essay, this notion of a single, coher-ent, and socially-progressive ‘bhakti movement’ grew especially “out of the context of early twentieth century Indian nationalist agendas which sought to create a sense of national identity by propagating the notion of a shared pan-Indian bhakti reli-gious heritage ” Patton Burchett, “Bhakti Rhetoric in the Hagiography of ‘untouch-able’ saints: Discerning Bhakti’s Ambivalence on Caste and Brahminhood,” International Journal of Hindu Studies 13, no 2 (2009), 115 5 I t is John stratton Hawley who has most insightfully and articulately hit on this point He writes that “The word bhakti is usually translated ‘devotion’ or ‘loving devotion,’ and indicates a style of religion in which an intense relationship to God and, by extension, to others who share such a relation is paramount ‘Relation’ is the proper term, for bhakti means devotion not in the sense of cool, measured venera-tion, but as active participation: the word bhakti derives from a sanskrit root mean-ing ‘to share’”(244) Hawley highlights the importance of “the term bhajan (sanskrit bhajana), which is in form the action noun that implies the doing of bhakti and which therefore completes the circle between the divine bhagavān [God] and the bhaktas [devotees] of this world It is most significant that this [term] ... has a dis-tinctly musical connotation, for bhajan means devotional song, the act of singing to God It is in a specifically musical context, then, that the circle of believers comes to be completed, or rather, charged with life Indeed, the association between bhakti and bhajan is sometimes so close that it is virtually impossible to distinguish the two [For Hindus] the act of making contact with God and participating in a divine inter-action has something intrinsically to do with the realm of song” (244-45) Hawley, “The Music in Faith and

I therefore intend to highlight in what follows Making a Place for sufism and tantra in the History of Bhakti As John stratton Hawley has pointed out, the idea of ‘the bhakti move-ment’ is largely a “figment of the north Indian imagination” created in order to demonstrate how the “the striking innovations that made their appearance in the bhakti landscape of north India roundabout the sixteenth century were actually continuous with earlier religious formations farther south ”6 Popular elements of ‘the bhakti move-ment’ narrative, such as the notion of the catuḥ sampradāya (‘the four sects or traditions’), seem to have been developed by northern bhakti communities in order to link themselves to the prestige and authority of earlier, southern, brāhmanic lineages 7 In nearly all of its features and iterations, ‘the bhakti movement’ has been a story—a version of history—constructed by ‘Hindus’ (of mostly north Indian prove-nance), for the benefit of ‘Hindus ’ For this reason, Islam and sufism often find themselves occluded from the history of bhakti in India While sufism has on rare occasion been incorporated into historical narratives of the bhakti movement in north India, generally such for-mulations have been all too simplistic and vague, centering on prob-6 J ohn s Hawley, “The Four sampradāyas--and other Foursomes,” paper pre-sented at the tenth International Bhakti Conference, Miercurea Ciuc, Romania, July 21-24, 2009 7 While much of ‘the bhakti movement’ narrative we know today took its shape in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, certain features, such as the catuḥ sampradāya, stretch back to at least the turn of the seventeenth century The catuḥ sampradāya model projects a narrative of bhakti originating in the tamil south, decaying, and then being brought north and revived by the theological and initiatory lineages (all originally established in the south) of Rāmānuja (the Rāmā-nandīs/Rāmānujīs), nimbārka (the nimbārkīs), Madhva (the Caitanyites/Gauḍīyas), and viṣṇusvāmī (the vallabhites/Puṣṭi Mārg) At a certain point it seems to have become quite important to many northern bhakti communities that they link them-selves to the prestige and authority of these earlier, southern, brāhmanic lineages Yet Hawley writes, interestingly, that “[a]s far as I have been able to determine, there is no evidence that any south-Indian observer of the shape of vaishnava religion ever perceived these four traditions as a group until very recent times” (“The Four sampradāyas—and other Foursomes”)"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"patton burchett348lematic notions of ‘conversion’ and ‘syncretism’ and failing to explain in any specific terms how Hindu bhakti communities may have drawn on sufi conceptions and traditions 8 In contrast to such trends, the work of Aditya Behl has opened up new vistas for understanding sufi contributions to the bhakti move-ment Behl has argued persuasively that Muslim sufi writing in the three centuries prior to the bhakti poet-saints was, in fact, fundamen-tal in shaping the poetic, metrical, and narrative conventions—even the motifs and images—that bhakti poets used in their own writings Providing one illustration of this point, Behl explains that “the great aesthetic and philosophical move that allows the resources of sanskrit criticism to be used by the bhakti sampradāyas”—the reformulation of sṛṅgāra-rasa as bhakti-rasa—is in fact a move “anticipated by the Ṣūfī poets, who emphasize the central value of prema-rasa as the linchpin of their narrative romances” as early as the late fourteenth century 9 While the bhakti saints’ vernacular poetry receives all the fanfare, Behl explains that, “The uncomfortable fact is that the first substantial body of devotional and narrative literature in pre-modern Hindi was penned by Muslims ”10While Behl’s work focuses on the genre of Hindavi sufi romances,11 in what follows I hope to contribute to our understanding of the sufi role in the bhakti movement through a focus on the genre of hagiog-raphy As we will see, the hagiographical tradition of Indian sufis pre-cedes and heavily informs the later bhakti hagiographies As simon 8 Aziz Ahmad, for instance, writes that “In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries as sūfism penetrated into the masses of converts and semi-converts from Hinduism, the Bhakti movements rose as a popular Hindu counter-challenge to the proselytiz-ing pull of sūfī humanism” (136) He later adds that the Bhakti movement “when in north India it came in contact with Islam, was inspired by its monotheism and stimulated by its challenge, and developed against it a system of self-defence and self-preservation for Hindu spirituality by borrowing Islam’s monotheistic egali-tarianism” (140) see Aziz Ahmad, Studies in Islamic Culture in the Indian Environ-ment (oxford: Clarendon Press, 1964), 136-66 For insightful discussions of how and why the models of ‘conversion’ and ‘syncretism’ are flawed (and some viable alterna-tives to these models), see especially tony stewart, “In search of equivalence: Con-ceiving Muslim-Hindu

bhaktamālas, sikh janamsākhīs and other vitae of non-Muslim men of religion repeat the emphasis and struc-ture of sufi anecdotes, particularly regarding contests of superiority, magical displays, and a general lack of charity towards opponents and doubters ”12 Bruce Lawrence notes further how the sufi tradition of hagiographical literature was well-established and flourishing prior to the north Indian bhakti movement and was clearly influential in molding the hagiographical writing of early bhakti communities As he explains it, there is one realm in which the bhakti movement was “indisputably dependent on, and indebted to, the sufis: the concept of a hagiographical tradition ”13 While these parallels have been noted by Digby and Lawrence, no scholar has yet taken the time to draw them out or make a sustained argument about their significance Here I hope to begin that project through a comparative analysis of sufi and bhakti miracle stories If the role of sufism in the historical development of bhakti has not been adequately understood, the same can also be said for the role of tantra, or more specifically, tantric yogīs and ascetics, who often seem to have served as a crucial foil for emerging conceptions of bhakti self-identity In order to highlight the crucial roles of both sufism and tan-tric yoga in the bhakti movement, in what follows I build on the work not only of Hawley, Digby, and Behl but also of William Pinch, one of very few scholars to have addressed the presence of an important ten-sion between bhaktas and yogīs in early modern north India As Pinch explains, for the bhaktas, the yogic pursuit of immortality and power through mystical knowledge or ascetic discipline was greatly mistaken because the only valid spiritual path was that of bhakti, “the rapturous and captivating love of God ” Bhaktas’ conflict with tantric yogīs was thus “not simply an argument about style It reflected a profound dis-agreement about the very nature of God: and whether men could legitimately aspire to be gods As such, it reflected a deep disagree-ment about the meaning of religion ”14 12 simon Digby, “The sufi shaikh as a source of Authority in

perceived difference between devotional ‘religion’ and tant-ric-yogic ‘magic ’the Devotee versus the tantric Yogī: setting the stageone story that illustrates the aforementioned themes particularly well is a popular oral tradition from eastern Rajasthan The tale begins in early sixteenth century Amber with the Kacchwāhā ruler Mahārāj Pṛthvīrāj (r 1503-1527), who was initially a devotee and patron of the nāth siddhas He is said to have been a disciple of the nāth yogī tārānāth, who resided in the hills of Galta just outside present-day Jaipur According to this oral tradition, one of Pṛthvīrāj’s queens, Balan Bāī, was a disciple of a Rāmānandī guru by the name of Kṛṣṇadās Payohārī,15 but faced constant pressure from the king to abandon her guru and become a disciple of tārānāth When Balan Bāī reported this situation to him, Kṛṣṇadās Payohārī immediately made his way to Galta where a confrontation ensued between him and tārānāth using his yogic powers, tārānāth took the form of a ferocious tiger to attack and frighten Payohārī away With the tiger about to leap upon him, Payohārī remarked, “What a jackass (gadhā)!” and tārānāth was immediately transformed from a tiger into a donkey Having sent the defeated donkey off into the forest, Payohārī entered a nearby cave and began to meditate searching for his missing guru at Galta, King Pṛthvīrāj came upon Payohārī in his cave and inquired as to the whereabouts of his guru tārānāth When Payohārī explained what had happened, the king ordered him to find tārānāth, bring him back, and reinstate him to his human form However, once restored to his 15 According to both nābhādās’s Bhaktamāl and Anantdās’s Pīpā-paracaī, Kṛṣṇadās Payohārī was a disciple of Anantdās (a different and earlier Anantdās than the later author of various bhakti paracais just referred to), who was a disciple of none other than Rāmānand himself The mysterious figure of Rāmānand is

me From now on, he is your guru And I too will be his disciple ”16Crucial to this story are how and why Payohārī is able to defeat tārānāth In many important respects, these two resembled each other—both were ascetics capable of effecting supernormal powers—however, they differed importantly in that one’s power issued from God, the result of devotion (bhakti) to an ever-present, all-powerful divine, while the other’s came from himself, the fruit of tantric haṭhayoga and the ascetic practice of tapas As Pinch explains:The key difference that separated them was the manner in which they conceived of and related to God taranath affected a yoga-tantric asceticism, the sole purpose of which was to cultivate supernormal power within—in effect, to turn himself into a God Paihari Krishandas, by contrast, only appeared to conjure taranath’s transformation into a jackass In fact, this was the work of a distant yet ever-present Lord, God as a thing apart, God with an upper-case ‘G’—a being who inspired total self-abandonment, and offered a sheltering refuge of love in return 17In other words, this tale depicts the extraordinary acts of Payohārī as ‘miracles’ from God, while essentially labeling tārānāth’s similar feats as forms of ‘magic,’ a mode of power issuing forth from one’s self, acquired through individual ritual/ascetic action, and thus inherently inferior to that from God It is exactly this sort of distinction, in both bhakti literature and earlier sufi sources, that I want to analyze in this essay Regardless of the historical fact or fiction of the confrontation between Payohārī and tārānāth, the story reflects a change of genuine historical significance that occurred in early sixteenth century Rajasthan when the bhakti community that would come to be known as the Rāmānandīs defeated the nāth siddhas at Galta and, whether through debate or physical force, took control of that strategic loca-tion At that same time, Mahārāj Pṛthvīrāj and the Kacchwāhā royal family shifted their patronage and allegiance from tārānāth and his nāth yogī brethren to Kṛṣṇadās Payohārī and the Rāmānandīs, inau-16 This legend was

closely affiliated with vaiṣṇava bhakti The Payohārī-tārānāth episode thus provides evidence for two very important larger trends in north India First, it demonstrates the emergence of an increasingly close relationship between bhakti communities and royal power, a trend in which we see the state allying itself more and more with insti-tutional forms of bhakti religiosity secondly, and more important for the purposes of this essay, the episode points toward an expanding sphere of bhakti religiosity and its historical confrontation with, and gradual social and political marginalization of, the sphere of tantra and ‘magic’ represented most prominently by the pervasive nāth yogīs As Pinch states, “For their part, bhakti reformers were adamant in their disdain for yogis who claimed special powers by virtue of their hathayogic and/or tantric prowess The bhakti literature is rife with examples of puffed up yogis who are deflated and sent packing by humble, God-loving sadhus ”18 In the pages to come, we will draw out this point more fully through an examination of miracle narratives in the bhakti hagiographies and their sufi precursors sufis and nāths: Miracles in the Context of Competition Interaction between sufis and local religious practitioners has a long history in India The first sufi centers in north India were built in the wake of Ghaznavid rule over the Punjab in the eleventh and twelfth centuries At the beginning of the thirteenth century the Delhi sultanate was established and sufi orders (silsilas) began to expand, in the process encouraging and promoting beliefs and practices held in common by Hindus and Muslims 19 Digby writes that from the thir-teenth to early sixteenth century Indian Islam was “permeated by sufi influence, to the extent that it is almost impossible to find a non-sufi writer or writer hostile to sufi thought in the corpus of the surviving literature of the Delhi sultanate ”20 Indian sufis’ frequent interactions with yogīs are well documented As satish Chandra states, “[Yogī] presence in the gatherings of sufis was considered quite normal ... 18 I bid , 211 19 Muzaffar Alam, The Languages of

and mental techniques from Indian yogīs,22 and it has often been pointed out that a nāth treatise on haṭha-yoga practices, the Amṛta-Kunda (or Pool of Nectar) was translated into Arabic and then into Persian as early as the thirteenth century 23 Indeed, it was especially the nāths with whom sufis most often interacted and whose practices—such as breath con-trol techniques and meditations on the cākra centers—they most fre-quently adopted and ‘Islamized ’24 not a monolithic order, but rather a confederation of ascetic groups claiming a similar body of Śaiva and siddha tradition, the nāth siddhas (sometimes termed Kānphaṭas or just Yogīs/Jogīs) seem to have first emerged in the thirteenth century around the founding fig-ure of Gorakhnāth The nāths purged earlier tantric cults of certain erotico-mystical elements and focused on the hydraulic dynamics and alchemical possibilities of the subtle body, an emphasis that main-tained traditional siddha goals of bodily immortality and this-worldly power 25 Regarding the nāths’ relationship with sufism, Carl ernst remarks:When one turns to the historical context for the encounter of sufism and yoga, it is a curious coincidence that the arrival of sufis in India took place not long after the nath or Kanphata yogīs became organised, that is by the beginning of the thirteenth century While ascetic orders certainly had existed in India for many centuries, the naths appear to 21 satish Chandra, Historiography, Religion and State in Medieval India (new Delhi: Har-Anand Publications, 1996), 136 22 Ramchandra shukla, Hindī Sāhitya

and were free to drop in for meals at sufi hospices, which in turn were open to any and all visitors While hardly representative of ‘Hindu’ culture as a whole, the yogīs were perhaps the only Indian religious group with whom sufis had much in common This was also an encounter between two movements that shared overlapping interests in psycho-physical techniques of meditation, and which competed to some extent for popular recognition as wonder-workers, healers, and possessors of sanctity 26While sufis and nāth yogīs interacted and shared much in common, they were also in clear competition with each other As shukla explains, in order to win over and spread their influence among the masses, sufi pīrs and fakīrs had to confront siddhas and yogīs, as is attested in the numerous sufi hagiographical stories in which a sufi saint encounters and defeats a siddha or yogī in a ‘miracle battle ’27 The sheer number of these types of stories indicates an atmosphere of religious competition between yogīs and sufis, for as nile Green has pointed out, while such stories “are ostensibly demonstrations of the strength of the saintly victor, they are by their very existence in fact testament to insecurity and potential weakness After all, real power is about the absence of competition such narratives therefore flourish most in societies in which different religions co-exist ”28 Richard Davis echoes this view, positing that stories of miracles most often “occur in situations of conflict, where differing systems of belief compete and questions of faith and power are directly at issue This is when super-natural communications are most needed ”29 Any miracle story thus conveys a message that depends on and elucidates the specific context within which that story was written, giving insight into the conten-tious religious questions and issues of the day While miracle stories, broadly construed, certainly existed in India well prior to the sufi presence and reflected the religious competitions and debates of the time of their writing (e g , the value of temple ritual, caste, intellectual 26 Carl ernst, “situating sufism and Yoga,” Journal of the Royal

thirteenth century, Indian miracle stories increasingly reflected a heightened tension/conflict between the per-spective of devotees (sufis, and later, bhaktas) and that of tantric yogīs and ascetics sufi Miracle stories (I): God-Power Beats Yoga-PowerA fourteenth century example of a miracle contest between a sufi and a yogī appears in what is perhaps the earliest authentic collection of descriptions of Indian sufi saints,30 the Fawā’id al-fuwād (or Morals of the Heart)31, in which the poet Amir Hasan records the conversations of shaykh nizam ud-Din Auliya of Delhi:The conversation that occurred on 5 safar 710/4 July 1310 turned on the topic of levitation ... [nizam ud-Din] recalled how a Jogi had come to the town of ucch (in the Panjab) to dispute with shaykh safi al-Din Gazaruni The Jogi challenged the shakykh to display any powers which he could not equal to this the shaykh replied that it was the Jogi who was advancing a claim and he should show his accomplishment first The Jogi rose from the ground into the air until his head reached the ceiling, and then he came down to the ground in the same fixed posi-tion, and then he invited the shaykh to show his power The shaykh turned his gaze towards heaven, and he said: “o Lord! You have given this power to one who is a stranger to You! Bestow upon me this grace!” The shaykh then rose from his place and flew away towards the qibla From there he flew to the north and then towards the south, and he finally came back to his own palace and sat down The Jogi was astonished, and, laying his head at the shaykh’s feet, said: “I can do no more than rise straight upwards from the ground and come down in the same way I cannot go to the right and to the left You turned whichever way you wished! This is true and from God: my own powers are false ”32 As this tale indicates, most Muslims took it for granted that yogīs could perform extraordinary feats and demonstrate supernatural powers The issue, however, was the source and level, or quality, of 30 s A A Rizvi, “sufis and natha Yogis in Mediaeval northern India (XII to XvI Centuries),” Journal of the Oriental Society of Australia 7, no 1-2 (1970): 127 31 I am grateful to Pasha Mohammad Khan for his generous assistance with the Persian sources referenced in this essay 32 Digby, “encounters with Jogis in Indian sufi Hagiography,” 4-5; sijzi, Fawā’id al-fuwād (Lahore, 1966), 84"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"patton burchett356these powers The crucial line comes at the very end of the story when the yogī marks the sufi’s display as ‘true’ and ‘from God’ while labeling his own levitation powers as “my own” [i e , not from God] and ‘false ’ In Rivzi’s translation of this same line, the yogī accepts his defeat and says, “Your miracle was possible because of Divine Grace; mine was the result of human efforts ”33 note that, in contrast to the yogī, the shaykh calls on God to bestow upon him the grace to perform the miraculous feat of flying Furthermore, the shaykh’s ‘levitation’ is not only superior to the yogī’s, but dramatically so; in this way the miracle reveals the unbounded power that is God While yogīs may obtain powers through their austerities and ascetic practice, they are hard earned and limited, unlike the infinite power of God for which the sufi is a conduit 34 In these hagiographies, the sufi saints’ miracles are typically marked by a specific word, karāmāt, used in contradistinction to the term employed to identify the magic powers of the yogīs An example of this occurs in nizam Yamani’s Lat̤ā’if-e-Ashrafī, which tells a story from the late fourteenth century in which Jamal al-Din Rawat, the dis-ciple of shaykh Ashraf Jahangir, is sent to compete against a yogī named Kamal, who is occupying the site where Ashraf Jahangir means to establish a khanqah Jamal al-Din arrives at the site and says to the yogī, “We do not think it becoming to give a display of miracles (karāmāt) nevertheless we will give an answer to each of the powers (istidrāj) that you display!” Jamal al-Din deals easily with a series of attacks by the yogī, including columns of black ants from all directions and an army of tigers Then, “[w]hen the Jogi had exhausted his tricks, he said: ‘take me to the shaykh! I will become a believer ” The Jogi says the profession of faith before the shaykh and he and all his 500 disciples become Muslims and burn their religious books 35 In this 33 Rizvi, 126; Hasan al-sijzi, Fawā’id al-fuwād (Buland shahr, 1855-56), 57-58 34 Raziuddin Aquil makes this key point about sufi miracle tales: “[t]he notion that the miracle stories were later concoctions by the shrewd keepers of the shrines that sought to exploit the credulity of ignorant followers is not at all supported by the sources on the contrary, the leading sufis themselves believed that the auliya or the friends of God, who had followed the mystic path (tariqat) could acquire super-natural faculties ” Raziuddin Aquil, “Miracles, Authority and Benevolence: stories of Karamat in sufi Literature of the Delhi sultanate,” in Sufi Cults and the Evolution of Medieval Indian Culture, ed Anup taneja (new Delhi: northern Book Centre and Indian Council of Historical Research, 2003), 129 35 Digby, “encounters with Jogis in Indian sufi Hagiography,” 9-10 Regarding this story, see also Bruce Lawrence, “early Indo-Muslims saints and Conversion,” in"},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"encounters with yogīs in sufi and bhakti literature 357story, we see the sufi referring to the feats that he can bring to bear as ‘miracles’ while he marks the yogī’s abilities as mere ‘powers ’ Both Digby and Rizvi note that in the sufi contest anecdotes of the sultanate period, the term most frequently used for the display of powers by yogīs is istidrāj,36 while the separate term karāmāt, “a beneficence, or special grace,” is reserved for the miracles of the sufi shaykhs 37 The essential point here about the karāmāt—something attributed only to saints and never to yogīs—is that it is not performed by the saint, but rather through divine grace 38 If this account does not make the common Islamic distinction between miracle and magic clear enough, it is made explicit by the authoritative north African sunni scholar, Ibn Khaldun (1332-1406) In his best-known work, the Muqaddimah (1377), Khaldun explains the difference between the miracle worker, who “is supported in his activity by the spirit of God,” and the magician, who “on the other hand, does his work by himself and with the help of his own psychic power, and, under certain conditions, with the support of devils ”39 Khaldun goes on to explain that, “Miracles take place with the support of the spirit of God and the divine powers Therefore, no piece of sor-cery can match them one may compare the affair of the sorcerers of Pharaoh with Moses and the miracle of the staff Moses’ staff devoured the phantoms the sorcerers produced, and their sorcery completely disappeared as if it had never been ”40 Here Khaldun draws on a long-standing Abrahamic perspective regarding the difference between ‘miracle’ and ‘magic’, referring to a story and to conceptions of God and the miraculous shared by Judaism, Christianity, and Islam In that story from exodus 7:8-13, Moses and Aaron confront the sorcerers and magicians of the Pharaoh, and through the power of God, easily overcome them As we can see from the use of this same story by Islam in Asia.

however, in the context of scholarly writing on the won-drous acts so common in religious scriptures, myths, and hagiogra-phies, this term ought to be used with heightened precision Attention should be given to how this word has, as we saw above, a distinct his-tory in which it has been invested with specific meanings by the Abrahamic religious traditions in order to distinguish a certain brand of extraordinary powers and occurrences (‘miracles’) from other simi-lar ones (‘magic’) In discussing miracles in bhakti hagiography or in Indian literature of any kind, it thus becomes critical to note that, in fact, “there are no precise equivalents in Indic languages for the semantic field occupied by the term ‘miracle’ in the West ” While “[s]ome sanskrit approxi-mations stress the unusual character (alaukika) of an event, some emphasize the response of wonder and astonishment (adbhuta, ascarya, vismaya) it evokes, and still others might be chosen to point to divine or non-human agencies (daiva, apauruseya, amanusya) believed to cause the marvel,” none equate to the meaning inherent in Islamic, Christian, and Judaic conceptions of the miracle 43 In contrast to Abrahamic understandings of the miraculous, Richard Davis explains that, “For the most part, Indians did not seek a single agency to account for all miracles, but rather recognized a multiplicity of pos-sible agents: gods, various categories of semi-divinities, and unusually accomplished humans ”44 As he goes on to say, “Indians considered powers such as those Patañjali [author of the Yogasūtra] and his com-mentators describe to be inhering human capacities theoretically available to all, rather than special gifts from God or other divinities ”45 43 Davis, “Introduction: Miracles as social Acts,” 8 44 I bid , 9 45 I bid , 10"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"patton burchett360even those with a theistic orientation “located this transforming moment of divine favor within a lengthy program of learning, ritual activity, and devotional exercise necessary to ready the novice for grace, and an even more rigorous program after God’s power had fallen ”46 In other words, with respect to the meanings historically embedded in the term ‘miracle,’ it seems that prior to the sufis and north Indian bhaktas, the ‘miracles’ of Indians were, strictly speaking, not really miracles at all Thus we can say that the Abrahamic notion of ‘miracle’ as a category established in contradistinction to ‘magic,’ as the wondrous act of an all-powerful God wrought through the pious faith of a devotee, seems to be one generally absent in Indian literature prior to sufi presence in the subcontinent, and one not present in Hindu sources in any significant way until the hagiographies associ-ated with the north Indian bhakti movement 47 sufi Miracle stories (II): the superfluity of Yogic Powers Before moving on to the bhakti sources, we must note one other important type of miracle story related in the sufi hagiographical tra-dition While in many anecdotes, the sufi shows his superiority to the yogī by performing a miracle from God, perhaps even more com-monly, after witnessing the yogī’s display of power the sufi shaykh responds simply by demonstrating the superfluity of such magic to true religion In other words, while some stories show that because the 46 I bid , 10-11 47 Comparison with several medieval sanskrit ‘miracle tales’ discussed by Phyllis Granoff seems to confirm this point In the pre-fifteenth century sanskrit hagio-graphical literature she examines, we do see critiques of tantric “black magic” as shameful, but the critiques are purely rhetorical with no apparent substantive con-tent Furthermore, in these stories we do see supernatural abilities and wondrous events made possible by the power and assistance of gods; however, devotion is rarely their cause and the Abrahamic binary of miracle versus magic never presents itself as it does in the early modern bhakti sources In the few medieval instances where devotion is praised as the force behind a wondrous occurrence, the nature of the devotion and the nature of the miraculous is not placed in contradistinction to tantra/yoga and magic in the same way it is in the sufi and bhakti hagiographies (rather it is contrasted with intellectual knowledge, temple ritual, etc ) see Phyllis Granoff, “scholars and Wonder-Workers: some Remarks on the Role of the super-natural in Philosophical Contests in vedānta Hagiographies,” Journal of the Ameri-can Oriental Society, 105, no 3 (1985): 459-67;

I have come from far away, and I am being put to shame You have accepted nothing of mine ” The shaykh replies, “Why are you ashamed? You have told well all that you can do, but why should I stretch forth my hand for what is of no use to me? What is the use of superfluities?” Later, the shaykh relates a similar encounter with another yogī who, after having his gifts denied, said “Why are you turning me away from your door? The whole world is mad about me!” The shaykh responded, “As God is my Refuge, why should I take a thing which is of no use to me?”48 The message here is clear: God is the source, the goal, and the refuge—these other powers are not from God and not for God; they are super-fluous Another example of this perspective on yogic magic comes from the narrative poem Shajarat al-Atqiyā describing an encounter between the Chisti sufi Amin al-Din A’la (d 1675) and a Hindu sannyāsī The saṃnyāsī presents a philosopher’s stone to Amin al-Din after having demonstrated its gold-producing qualities, but Amin al-Din merely throws it into a large reservoir of water When the saṃnyāsī begins weeping for his lost philosophers’ stone, Amin smiles and says, “ ‘Go in the water and find the stone, And if you

valuable—to shaykh Jalal al-Din Kabir al-Auliya (c fourteenth century), who considers it worthless and promptly throws it into a stream When the yogī goes to retrieve his stone in the stream he finds “thousands upon thousands of philosophers’ stones were lying there” and, amazed, asks the shaykh to teach him how to get beyond such desires, recites the kalima, and becomes his disciple 50Foreshadowing the argument to come, we might note here that the bhakti hagiographer Mahīpati’s eighteenth century Bhaktavijay (or Victory of the Devotees) tells a strikingly similar story in which the bhakti poet-saint nāmdev takes away the philosopher’s stone of a poor man named Parisā Bhāgavat51 and throws it into the river This man had achieved great wealth with the stone but now lived a greedy, duplicitous life For this reason, nāmdev finds a way to acquire the stone and then promptly throws it into the river Greatly angered, Parisā Bhāgavat goes to the river to find his stone; however, when he pulls his hands out of the riverbed they are filled with philosopher’s stones, prompting him to realize the superiority of nāmdev’s spiritual path—that of bhakti—and the superfluity of, and potential corruption in, magic and alchemy 52 In this bhakti story, then, we seem to have evidence of a specific narrative trope borrowed from the earlier sufi hagiographical tradition As we will see below, these sorts of shared literary tropes and themes emerge persistently in the tales from the bhakti hagiographies, reflecting key attitudes and beliefs held in com-mon by bhaktas and sufis regarding the nature of God and proper religious behavior 49 Richard eaton, Sufis of Bijapur, 1300-1700: Social Roles of Sufis in Medieval India (new Delhi: Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers, 1996

itself coming into conflict with tantric-yogic forms of thought and praxis earlier we discussed the oral tradition of the Rāmānandī bhakta Kṛṣṇadās Payohārī defeating the nāth yogī tārānāth at Galta in order to highlight this emerging tension between bhakti and tantric yoga in north India in the first half of the sixteenth century Interestingly, one of our earliest pieces of written evidence for this confrontation actually comes from a sufi text, Malik Muham-mad Jayasi’s Kanhāvat, completed in 1540 In this unique text—a sufi telling of the story of Kṛṣṇa—Jayasi (also renowned as the author of the Padmāvat) narrates a meeting that occurs in Mathura between Kṛṣṇa and Gorakhnāth, the illustrious medieval nāth siddha and sup-posed historical founder of the nāth tradition As Francesca orsini explains, Gorakhnāth, accompanied by a host of yogīs, comes to Mathura “because the fame of bhakti has spread through the whole world and he has heard of Kṛṣṇa as a famous and talented gyānī [wise man], but is now disappointed to see him enveloped in bhoga [enjoy-ment]: he should take advantage of the time he has left to become a jogi, so as to acquire an immortal body and the powers that come with it ”53 Kṛṣṇa rejects this advice on various grounds and defends the value of bhakti-based bhoga in a world manifested for the sake of God’s līlā (play) “After this debate they decide to fight, but it is a brief and inconclusive fight with an accommodating ending: ‘Yoga is best for the jogi, and bhoga best for the bhogi ’”54 Despite the fact that bhakti does not win in this confrontation as clearly as in the Payohārī-tārānāth episode at Galta, it certainly does not lose, and if anything, Kṛṣṇa—not Gorakhnāth—seems to hold the position of strength in the narrative Furthermore, what is more important here is the fact that a Muslim author from Awadh would compose a narrative in 1540 in which the most revered figures of saguṇ bhakti and tantric yoga openly challenge each other, seemingly illustrating just how clear to 53 Francesca orsini, “For a Comparative Literary History: Malik Muhammad Jayasi’s Kanhavat (947H/1540)” (unpublished paper), 17 54

sufi sources The bhakti literary sources I draw on range in date from the turn of the seventeenth century to the second half of the eighteenth century and come from Rajasthan, the Gangetic plains, the Panjab, and Maha-rashtra 55 We begin with Mahīpati (1715-90), the Maharashtrian author of several bhakti hagiographical collections 56 While Mahīpati writes from Maharastra in the mid-late eighteenth century, he seems to have largely recycled stories already in circulation, including many from north India In fact, Mahīpati relies considerably on nābhādās’s circa 1600 Bhaktamāl (Garland of the Devotees) and explicitly cites that foundational hagiographic text, written in Rajasthan, as a model for his own Jon Keune and Christian novetzke both remark that Mahīpati seems to have made a conscious effort to affiliate Maha-rashtrian bhakti with north India in order to enhance the Marathi bhaktas’ legitimacy and prestige 57 In his Bhaktavijaya (1762), Mahīpati relays this story about nāmdev, the great bhakti poet-saint, and Jñāndev (or Dnyāndev), who was a nāth yogī as well as the author of the Jñāneśvarī (a vernacu-lar verse commentary on the Bhagavadgītā) nāmdev and Jñāndev 55 The examples I present do not proceed chronologically, but this is of no real import as all post-date the sufi literature we have discussed and all fall in a nearly two hundred year period (c 1600-1775) that saw the explosive growth of bhakti communities across north India, western-central India, and Bengal 56 For more information on Mahīpati and his first hagiographical work, the

it they could not determine its depth They were puzzled to know what device to adopt to obtain some water Then Jnandev said to nama, ‘There is a method which is possible for me ’ saying this he reduced his own size through his yoga powers and went down into the well Having drunk the water he quickly came out again nama was now extremely thirsty but could think of no way of obtaining the water Jnandev then said to him ‘Why is your heart troubled? I will bring the water and give it to you at once You know nothing of the methods of mystic yoga power by which one can reduce his size 58At this point, nāmdev cried to viṭṭhal (a local form of Kṛṣṇa), going deep into prayer and imploring him for help According to the text, the moment he heard of nāmdev’s need, Kṛṣṇa “hastened more quickly than thought Just then the well with a rumbling noise became filled, and began to overflow As Jñāndev saw this miracle, he thought to himself, ‘This is a most remarkable deed I do not understand how nāma has made God his debtor ’ Then awakening nāma to conscious-ness he lovingly embraced him and said, ‘Kṛṣṇa has come to your aid, and has shown us this seemingly impossible miracle ”59 not only are nāmdev and Jñāndev supplied with water, but the well flows over with such vigor that it provides much-needed water to the entire drought-stricken village Here, as in our earlier sufi tale, the power of God, and of devotion to God, is shown as dramatically superior to the powers of yoga Again we see the boundlessness of God revealed through the miraculous, this time in the image of the overflowing well The tale ends with Jñāndev admitting the superiority of bhakti (devotion) over jñāna (knowledge) As Christian novetzke explains, “Jnandev’s yogic powers serve only him; though he might perform a service for someone else, he commands this power This is not a social power However, in namdev’s case, his plea for help transcends indi-vidual ability, and the result, likewise, extends far beyond his own needs ”6058 J ustin Abbott and narhar Godbole, Stories of Indian Saints: Translation of Mahipati’s Marathi Bhaktavijaya (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1982 [1933]), 187-88;

just as one, who is proud of knowing by heart some poems, feels ashamed in the presence of a saint who has inspiration ... In the same way was it with the power of Dnyāndev, for he had made the wall of lifeless stone to move a mile from Ālandī, and at that sight Chāngdev was overcome with shame Dismounting from the tiger, he let go of the snake he had used as a whip With an unusually reverent attitude and with loving devotion, he rolled himself with delight at Dnyāndev’s feet 66At this point in the text, Mahīpati mourns those yogīs like Chāngdev who have achieved profound mystical absorption but do not know the pleasures of bhakti, lauding Jñāndev as a rare exemplar of one who possesses knowledge of non-duality while also delighting in loving devotion to the saguṇa form of God 67 The tale resumes with Chāngdev 63 G s Ghurye notes that the nāth yogī Changdev was Jñāndev’s “chief contes-tant” and may have been the head of “a Jogī monastery not far away from Paithana, where Jñāneśvara first made his mark” (133) see G s Ghurye, Indian Sadhus, 2nd ed (Bombay: Popular Prakashan, 1964) 64 J ustin Abbott, n R Godbole, and J F edwards, Nectar from Indian Saints: An English Translation of Mahīpati’s Marāthī Bhaktalīlāmrit (Poona: united Theologi-cal College of Western India, 1935), 51; III:183 65 For a detailed investigation of the fascinating history of this hagiographic trope, see simon Digby, “to Ride a tiger or a Wall? strategies of Prestige in Indian sufi Legend,” in According to Tradition: Hagiographical Writing in India, eds Winand Callewaert and Rupert snell (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz verlag: 1994), 99-129 Digby notes that the earliest example in which both “Riders” occur in the same story is a fourteenth century sufi text of the Delhi sultanate Interestingly, such sufi anecdotes were likely preceded by those of siddhas (nāths) riding tigers or walls (though apparently never in the same story) 66 I bid , 67-8; Iv: 153-59 67 I bid , 69-70; Iv: 173-76, 182-83"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"patton burchett368asking Jñāndev how he was able to move the wall, a feat that despite his own superhuman powers, he calls “beyond the power of all under-standing ” Jñāndev responds by explaining that:If God wills to do a thing, what is there that He will not do? ...

Before proceeding to more bhakti miracle tales, it is important to note that while the nature, content, and heightened intensity of early mod-ern (sufi and bhakti) critiques of tantra/yoga/magic was distinctive, criticism of tantra certainly had precedents in Indian literature There is, for instance, a long history of mocking and negatively marking tāntrikas and black magic, as evidenced by depictions of Kāpālika ascetics in early medieval sanskrit dramas one notable precedent to the north Indian bhakti movement’s miracle stories comes from Gūḷūra siddhavīraṇāryaru’s edition of the Śūnyasaṃpādane (ca 1510 ce), a collection of Kannada prose poems (vacanas) about the vīra-śaiva saints 70 In one section, this text tells the tale of Allama Prabhu (circa twelfth century in Karnataka), who encounters, defeats and converts Gorakṣa, the leader of the siddhas 71 In the story, Gorakṣa professes to have conquered death as evidenced by his diamond-hard body to prove the claim, he asks Allama to strike him with a sword, but when Allama swings the sword, it clangs against Gorakṣa’s ada-mantine body Gorakṣa laughs with pride and Allama, amused at his 69 J ustin Abbott, The Life of Eknāth (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1981 [1927]), 128-34; v 19:19-99 70 Michael, R Blake, The Origins of the Vīraśaiva Sects (Delhi: Motilal Banarsi-dass, 1992), 29 71 I am grateful to Gil Ben-Herut for his assistance with the scholarship on this particular story"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"patton burchett370vanity, responds with a vacana mocking his yogic powers: “Go to; your yōga of trickery and fraud with roots and fibres, is no yōga!

Indeed, it is true that Kabīr’s poetry is often littered with nāth terminology and many of his social attitudes, cosmological sup-positions, and even yogic practices parallel those of the nāths; how-ever, the key point is that he (at least so far as we can tell from the poetry attributed to him) differed from the nāths in at least one cru-cial area: he believed the route to God was through bhakti; men were not meant to try and become gods, but to devote themselves whole-heartedly to God For this reason, like other bhakti reformers (and sufis), Kabīr held a clear disdain for yogīs who claimed special powers by virtue of their yogic and/or tantric prowess 88It is now to the hagiography of Kabīr that we shift our attention In his late sixteenth century Kabīr parachaī, the Rāmānandī Anantadās, contemporary with and part of the same guru lineage as nābhādās, tells the story of how shah sikander Lodi once came to Kāśī (Benares) where the qāzīs, mullahs, brahmans, and baniyas together approached him with a complaint about Kabīr They explain to sikander that Kabīr has abandoned the customs of Muslims and Hindus, scorned the sacred places and rites, and in this way has corrupted everyone and tarnished the reputation of both Hindu and Muslim religious authorities sikander orders that Kabīr be brought before him to be killed standing before the shah, Kabīr states “If Rām is my protector, 86 J ohn s Hawley, Three Bhakti Voices: Mirabai, Surdas, and Kabir in Their Time and Ours (new York: oxford university Press, 2005), 288 87 on this subject, see especially Charlotte vaudeville, Kabir.

Without bhakti to Hari, no work can prosper I recognized the guru and Govinda [Kṛṣṇa] through devotion That is why sikander could do nothing to me ”90As in the tulsīdās story, the focus here is completely on God Kabīr does not actually do anything—other than remain absorbed in devo-tion God—rather it is God who does everything The pro-bhakti mes-sage could hardly be more explicit All one needs is devotion to the Lord, who provides power and protection greater than any magic art or yogic discipline could possibly offer Kabīr refuses to perform a marvel himself, yet nevertheless not one, not two, but three miracles 89 I t is interesting to note that both Anantadās and Priyādās make frequent use of the Persian word karāmāt to refer to miracles in their hagiographies, suggesting that words from the sanskritic lineage perhaps did not convey as precisely the desired meaning However, nābhādās consistently uses the Braj word acaraja, from the san-skrit āścarya, to denote miracles 90 David Lorenzen, Kabir Legends and Ananta-das’s Kabir Parachai (Albany: state university of new York Press, 1991), 107-15;

The Seat of Sāī Bābā’s Furu (Chap. 4, vv. 121-138) ... He [sāī Bābā] never visited anyone, but remained near the neem tree, day and night ... A strange thing happened, one day! A few persons were possessed by the spirit of the deity, Khandoba60 In their frenzy, they started puffing and grasping and panting, emitting loud deep sounds so people began to ask them questions “to which fortunate parents does this boy belong? From where and how has he come up to here? o Khandoba, at least you find the answers for us,” one of them said to the god 57 see ibid , vol 3, 187 58 see chap 10 (“Baba’s Siddhis, Their origin and Their use”), chap 11 (“Baba’s Recent Lilas in the south and Their Purpose”), and chap 12 (“Baba’s teachings as to Siddhis”), 129-192 59 narasimhaswami nonetheless dedicated chaps 13-15 of vol 3 of his Life of Sai Baba to Islam: “Baba and Muslims’ Contacts,” “some Muslim Devotees,” and “other Muslim Devotees Abdul (1871-1954),” 151-187 60 Popular pastoral god, typically identified with Śiva, whose home is the temple at Jejuri in Pune District"},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"sāī bābā of śirḍī and yoga powers395And the god said, “Go, get a hoe, and strike at the spot that I show you strike here with your hoes and you will get your answers about this lad ”Then, in the same spot, near the enclosing wall of the village, under the same neem tree, they struck blow upon blow with their hoes till they came upon some bricks The layer of bricks over, they found an underground cell with four metal lamps burning in it, the entrance to which was closed by a quern-stone The cell was paved with limestone and contained a wooden seat, a Gomukhi61 with a beautiful rosary Then the god said, “For twelve years this boy undertook penance at this spot ”All the people were wonderstruck at this and started plying the boy with probing questions But the lad was full of playful mischief and told them a story, altogether different “This is my Guru’s seat,” said he, “and my most sacred legacy Listen to me this once and preserve it as it is ”so said Baba, said the listeners who were present But why is this, my tongue, moved to say that Baba was giving it a different turn?I was amazed at myself Why should I think in such terms about Baba? But now I have realized that this must have been his spontaneous sense of humour Baba dearly loved a joke Maybe, the cell was his own dwelling But what does one lose in saying that it is the Guru’s? How does its impor-tance suffer?And so on his orders, the cell was, once again, sealed as his Guru’s seat, by restoring the bricks to their former position The neem tree was to Baba as great and as sacred as the Ashwathha (Peepul) or Audumbar tree He loved that neem tree dearly, and greatly revered it Mhalsapati62 and other old residents of shirdi village bow to this place as the samadhi of Baba’s Guru It is common knowledge among the villagers that Baba sat near this samadhi, in meditation, observing total silence for a period of twelve years 61 A glove, shaped like a cow’s mouth, which covers the hand in counting rosary beads 62 The keeper of the local Khaṇḍobā temple and one of the first devotees of the saint It was he who, according to our sources, first called him ‘sāī’ on Mhalsapati (d 1922), see narasimhaswami, Life of Sai Baba, vol 2, 1-42"},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"antonio rigopoulos3962.

Sāī Bābā’s ‘Temporary Death’ (Vhap. 44, vv. 62-89) It was the full moon in the brighter half of the month of Margashirsha (December), when Baba became restless with an attack of Asthma and in order to be able to bear the physical affliction, he went into nirvi-kalpa samadhi And Baba had already told everyone, “For three days from now onwards, I shall go into samadhi Do not try to rouse me ”That corner of the Sabha-mandap63 that you see, that was the place to which Baba had pointed his finger and said, “Dig the samadhi there and place me at that spot ”Addressing Mhalsapati, Baba had himself said, most positively, “Do not abandon me with unconcern, the next three days And put up two flags at that place as a sign indicative of the spot ” so saying, he went into nirvikalpa samadhi And, as in a sudden fainting fit, his body fell down, motionless Mhal-sapati took his head on his lap; but the others gave up all hope It was night time; the clock had struck ten, when this incident took place People fell silent, thinking, “Alas! What a sudden calamity!”no breathing, no pulse—life seemed to have abandoned the body to the people, it appeared a terrible state; but to sai, it was a state of great-est happiness Thereafter, Mhalsapati, who was always alert in his mind, kept guard over Baba, day and night, sitting up wide awake, all the time 63 A portico in front of a temple, where people assemble"},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"antonio rigopoulos398Although it was a command from sai’s own mouth, to dig his sama-dhi, yet no one had the heart to do so The whole village gathered there to see Baba in the state of samadhi and people stared at him in utter astonishment Bhagat,64 however, would not put down Baba’s head from his lap so that it may not be a sudden shock to the people to see that life had departed from his body, Baba had asked them to guard him for three days “Really, sai had deceived them,” thought the people His breathing ceased; all the bodily organs became still, without any trace of activity and the glow of life over it dimmed, too!Consciousness of the outside world was lost; speech fell silent everyone was deeply worried as to how he would regain conscious-ness The body would not gain consciousness two days passed in this way Mulla, Maulavi,65 fakir—all came and began discussing what was to be done next Appa Kulkarni, Kashiram came, and took a firm decision that Baba had attained his eternal Abode so his body should be laid to rest some said, “Wait a moment, such haste is not good Baba is not like others His words are always true ”At once, the others replied, “From where will life come into a body that is already cold? How thoughtless all these people are!Dig the grave at the spot indicated oh, do call all the people and give a timely burial!

Sāī Bābā’s Wooden Plank (Chap. 10, vv. 15-21, 29-30) A wooden plank, four times an arm’s length, wide as an outstretched palm (the measure of the thumb and the little finger, extended) would be suspended from the rafter, like a swing, fastened at both ends by pieces of rags on such a plank Baba used to sleep earthen oil-lamps burned at the head and foot of his bed no one ever understood when he climbed up or down from it He would either sit up there, with head bent, or would be sleeping on it But when he climbed up or got down from it, nobody ever saw him doing so The plank was secured by strips of rags—but how did it balance Baba’s weight? Well, when all the Mahasiddhis reside in you, is not the plank only for name’s sake?Where even the tiniest particle pricks the eye, a man who has attained the siddhi of Anima (ability to reduce oneself to an atom) can hide quite comfortably in it Hence Baba’s power to move with ease in the form of a fly or a worm or an ant He who has Anima as his slave, will he take long, transforming himself into a fly?

Significance of Sāī Bābā’s Sleeping on the Plank (Chap. 45, vv. 130-142)A detailed description of this plank has already been given in an ear-lier chapter (Ch 10) so now, listen to its significance once, as Baba was earnestly describing the importance of this plank, listen to the thought that arose in the mind of Kakasaheb Dikshit And he said to Baba: “If you are so fond of sleeping on the plank, I shall very lovingly, suspend it from the roof Then you can comfort-ably lie down on it ”Baba said to him, “Leaving Mhalsapati below, how can I sleep up, alone? I am all right below, as I am ”so Kaka, very lovingly, said further, “I will suspend another plank You can sleep on one, and Mhalsapati, on the other ”Just listen to Baba’s reply to this “Can he sleep on the plank, indeed? only he can sleep on the plank who is an aggregate of virtues ”“sleeping on the plank is not easy Who can sleep on it, except me? such sleeping is possible only for him, who can drive away sleep and keep his eyes open ”“When I go to sleep, I command him (Mhalsapati) ‘Put your hand on my heart and keep sitting near me’ ”“But even this work he cannot do He keeps nodding drowsily, where he is sitting to him, this plank is of no use This plank is my bed only ”“In my heart the chanting of the name goes on, ceaselessly see for yourself, by keeping your hand there and if I happen to fall asleep, wake me up When such is my instruction, to him, “When he himself falls asleep instead, his hand becomes heavy as a stone on my calling out ‘Bhagat’, the sleep disappears from his eyes, causing him confusion and fright ”“one who cannot sit steadily on the ground, whose seat is not firm, the man who is a slave of sleep, i e tamas, how can he sleep on a height?”"},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"sāī bābā of śirḍī and yoga powers401Thus Baba pointed out, at the appropriate time, and out of affection for the devotees, “Do the duty ordained by your own nature and do not imitate the law of another ”5.

It was this same brick, resting his elbow on which, Baba would spend hour after hour, sitting in yogasan, all ready for Yoga He naturally had great love for it “The brick, in the company of which, I go into a state of self-absorption, and which was dearer to me than life itself—that companion of mine is broken and I too, cannot remain without it ”“That brick, my companion of a lifetime, has gone, leaving me behind ” Remembering its many qualities in this manner, Baba started crying ... now that the cause of the devotees is accomplished, therefore, it is said, he has abandoned the body But who will believe these words?

When he got the place dug and excavated ... before him stood the closed door of a shrine Careless of consequence, Allama kicked the door open, and entered He saw before him a yogi in a trance, concentrated on the liṅga His eyes and face were all aglow, his locks glowing, a garland of rudrākṣi seeds round his neck, serpent earrings on his ears Like the All-giving tree, he sat there in the heart of the temple The yogi’s name was Animiṣayya (the one without eyelids, the open-eyed one) While Allama stood there astonished, Animiṣayya gave into his hand a liṅga ...

understood to be the guru’s grace nothing else is needed but a heart full of love for one’s guru such intense devotion is coupled with awe: thus the saint is reported saying “I would tremble to come

faith and love of the sishya ”85 such practice of making the teacher the focus of one’s contemplation is commonly prescribed in both Hinduism and sufism With respect to sufism, France Bhattacharya notes: “La méditation sur le maître spirituel est caractéristique de la pratique des soufis Le disciple doit-il méditer sur un miroir qu’il voit à l’intérieur de lui même, ou bien se tenir face à un miroir...”86 From a sufi perspective, absorption in the teacher leads to tawakkul, that is, to the perfection of faith/trust in Allah From a Hindu perspective, such emphasis on pure love, through the interiorization of the guru and the final ‘universalization’ of the guru principle (gurutattva, as may be gauged in a popular text such as the Gurugītā), is the acme of bhakti leading to blissful union with the Beloved narasimhaswami thinks that it is precisely through the guru’s grace and one-pointed yogic contemplation upon him that sāī Bābā acquired his powers: “sai Baba had by the grace

position Gururaya91 suspended me in the well in such a way that the hands should not reach the water nor should any water go in my mouth There was a tree near the edge of the well to which was tied the other end of the rope Gururaya then went away, who knows where, with a mind free from doubt or anxiety About four to four and a half hours passed by, after which he came back He then quickly took me out and asked me “Are you all right?” I replied “I was full of joy The happiness that I experienced—how can a lowly creature like me describe it?” Gururaya was very pleased to hear these words He moved his hand on my back, very affectionately, and made me stay with him even as I am relating this to you, love surges in my heart The Guru then took me to his school, showing for me the same loving concern as the mother-bird who clasps her young ones under her wings And oh, how fascinating was the Guru’s school! so much so that I forgot my fond attachment to my parents; the chain of delusion, attachment was broken and I was liberated, quite effort-lessly...

When the pir thought the salik94 was spiritually prepared, he would confer an experience of bliss through his own spiritual power known as baraka This feat was considered to be one of the most challenging in Sufi asceticism In the classical period of sufism, the Sufi with whom the chilla-i-ma’kusa is most associated is the thirteenth-century Chishti sheikh Fariduddin Ganj-shakar of Pakpattan, more familiarly known as Baba Farid ... sai Baba is describing a conversion experience which is well-defined as tawbat in the Sufi path His life changed thereafter, for he then relates how he at once joined the guru/pir’s school, which we can now inter-pret as a Sufi school, known as a madrasah, where he was trained The official biographers, however, treat this crucial event as a parable or as merely symbolic, due to their ignorance of the significance of tawbat in the Sufi tariqat 95What is emphasized in this story is no special yogic technique but an intense outpouring of love It is this ‘intoxicated’ love which is thought to promote the highest contemplation, ultimately leading to union with God through union to one’s guru/pīr It should be noted that from a Hindu perspective sāī Bābā’s identification with Dattātreya appears most fitting, given the fact that devotion to the guru as God is a paramount feature of the Dattasampradāya, in which Dattātreya is revered as the supreme gurudeva significantly, most editions of the Marathi Gurucaritra have incorporated the sanskrit Gurugītā 96 92 Dabholkar, Shri Sai Satcharita, 521-522 93 A forty-day retreat in sufi training 94 Adept along the spiritual path, disciple 95 Warren, Unravelling the Enigma, 213-215 The ṭarīq or ṭarīqa (plural ṭarīqāt) is the sufi path If the episode of sāī Bābā’s being hung upside-down may well be biographical, still the impression is that this story is also highly symbolical 96 on the Gurugītā within the Gurucaritra, see my study Guru: Il fondamento della civiltà dell’India.

He had acquired the power to cure illnesses and protect individuals even in distant places... As can be gathered from stray conversations with devotees, there were thus two distinct phases in sai Baba’s life up to age forty-eight or so, sai Baba was a faqir practicing daily austerities to the extent that he was often categorized as a madman or pagal in the local language After 1886... he became one of the awliya114 In the first period we can talk about his going through the steps and stages of the Sufi tariq as an aspirant In the latter period from 1886 to 1918 he was a Realized Master guid-ing and teaching sufi precepts to those who became his disciples...115Moreover:Four phases can be identified in the spiritual evolution of sāī Bābā The first was as a child under the care of a Sufi faqir for his first four years, and possibly also for the next twelve years with his guru venkusha or Roshan shah Miyan The second was as a salik, an aspirant or traveller on the Sufi path, from age sixteen when he wandered around Marath-wada, meditated in a cave, lived under the neem tree and wandered in the jungle At this time he displayed the typical characteristics of a ‘mad faqir’ The third was after he returned to shirdi permanently and began to live in the dilapidated masjid The fourth was from 1886 onwards as a perfectly realized soul, a level which he apparently attained after his three-day ordeal 116Dabholkar interprets the saint’s feat as a yogic exploit, stating that he would have entered into a condition of nirvikalpasamādhi sāī Bābā himself is reported using the term samādhi in instructing his devotees not to rouse his inert body for three days The technical term nirvikalpasamādhi (‘concentration without distinction’) is used in vedānta as synonymous of asamprajñātasamādhi or ‘unconscious samādhi’ of classical yoga It is understood as that perfect, objectless concentration in which only karmic impulses/residues are left (saṃskāras), which is achieved after having eliminated all mental functions (cittavṛttis) Attaining a condition of apparent death is by no means the exclu-sive characteristic of Hindu ascetics In India, it is also reported to 114 ‘ Friends [of God]’ i e saints 115 Warren, Unravelling the Enigma, 45-46 116 I bid., 125"},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"antonio rigopoulos414take place among sufi saints and mystics As I wrote in my 1993 book: “Certain faqīrs ... are said to possess the power of remaining com-pletely buried underground for a considerable time without detriment to their health Indeed, this is a common theme in legends concerning heterodox sufis, as in the case of shah Madar ”117 even the sufi woman saint Babajan is said to have gone through a ‘death experience’ thirty years or more before her actual demise in 1931 118 If the reference to sāī Bābā’s entering a state of nirvikalpasamādhi is an input of Dabholkar’s Hindu over-interpretation, it is certainly not unreason-able to hypothesize that the saint as many sufi faqīrs before and after him was exposed—during the years in the company with his guru/pīr, or through various contacts during his itinerant life—to some kind of yogic training, which he integrated in his own ‘synthetic’ mysticism on the other hand, it should be stressed that sāī Bābā neither prac-ticed nor taught prāṇāyāma or breath-control techniques, which as mentioned is a prominent feature especially among nātha adepts 119 He even reprimanded a man who, by prāṇāyāma, claimed to have developed the siddhi of clairvoyance, saying “I can never exhibit tricks ”120 narasimhaswami thinks that sāī Bābā’s yogic capacities were not the result of any formal yoga practice—he advocated no par-ticular mārga, such as the yoga mārga –121 but rather came to him through the grace of his guru and the saint’s perfect surrender to him He writes: “About Ashtanga Yoga it is not known whether Baba per-formed pranayama, etc , but very probably these would have come to him easily by faith in his all powerful Guru ”122 The woman devotee tara Bai sadasiva tarkhad observed that other saints used to get into the samadhi or trance condition, and then they would forget their body ...

References to Sāī Bābā’s Death on October 15, 1918significantly, when referring to sāī Bābā’s last days, Dabholkar defines him a yogin, who in the end burned down his body in yogic fire The breaking of the saint’s brick, caused by the devotee Madhav Phasle who had lifted it and allowed it to fall, appears to have taken place at the beginning of october, 1918, just ten or twelve days before sāī Bābā’s passing away According to narasimhaswami’s Charters and Sayings, at the breaking of the brick the saint, in grief, would have exclaimed: “My fakir’s wife left me with venkusha at selu I stayed with him twelve years, and left selu This brick (which Baba always lovingly used to support his arm or head) is my Guru’s gift, my life companion It is not the brick that is broken now, but my karma (pra-rabdha) it is that has snapped I cannot survive the breaking of the brick ”134133 Khaparde, Shirdi Diary, 119-120 The shirdi villager Madhavrao Deshpande, also known as shyama, was a Brahman teacher and an important figure, often acting as a precious intercessor mediating between sāī Bābā and the devotees 134 narasimhaswami, Charters and Sayings, 61 Karmaprārabdha is the karman

a concrete testimony of spiritual transmission or power transfer, also symbolic of his guru’s presence and a token of his grace Its breaking is interpreted as signaling the exhaustion of the saint’s karmic residues, calling for the relinquishing of all ties and of life itself Dabholkar states that sāī Bābā, all through his life in shirdi, sat for hours in a yogic posture with the aid of this brick (upon which he rested his head or elbow) sāī Bābā himself is reported to have said that in the company of the brick he would go into a state of self-absorption In particular, Dabholkar writes that every night, taking support of that brick, Baba used to sit in the mosque, in solitude, very peacefully, in yogāsana sāī Bābā would have kept to a yogic posture not so much during the day but during his solitary night vigils at the masjid, presumably while contemplating the fire of his dhunī In haṭhayoga, yogāsana is typically identified with the yogic posture par excellence, that is, padmāsana, the lotus posture (see Gheraṇḍasaṃhitā 2 44-45) In fact, various contemporaries of our faqīr among whom Balaji Pilaji Gurav, an old shirdi villager whom I interviewed in october 1985, reported that the saint never practiced any āsana evidently, at least during the day, sāī Bābā was not seen performing any special yogic exercise or keeping to any yogic posture Moreover, as Dabholkar himself tells us, sāī Bābā prescribed no “yogasanas” (chap 10, v 113) That the saint kept to special pos-tures during his contemplative exercises is quite probable, however, though it does not represent a proof of his being a yogin sufis are known to keep to definite postures while performing their dhikr If Dabholkar’s statement that sāī Bābā sat in yogāsana might be attrib-uted to his Hindu orientation, this possibility should not be ruled out As a Maharashtrian saint upholder of an integrative kind of mysti-cism, it appears only natural that sāī Bābā may have selectively incor-porated yoga postures and practices: the contrary would frankly appear surprising if not unrealistic Conclusion: ‘swimming at the Confluence’All in all, even though one comes across sayings

if our faqīr may have employed sanskrit terms such as nāmasmaraṇa, dhyāna, samādhi, etc one must take into account his integrative saintliness, plus the omnipresent cultural influence of ‘Hinduism’ and of the Hindu major-ity with whom he interacted If sāī Bābā was not strictu sensu a yogin, he certainly lived his whole life as a genuine faqīr practicing renunciation and poverty, detach-ment and celibacy, stressing to his last day the importance of feeding the poor and of almsgiving 139 According to Munsiff, “in his personal habits he was ascetic to the last ”140 nonetheless, our saint always rec-ommended moderation 141 He was against extreme asceticism and taught the majority of his devotees, who were lay people, that they should realize their spiritual goal by remaining in the world and lead-ing a simple, orderly life, regulating their meals, rest, etc 142 sāī Bābā was also against unnecessary fasting and even broke traditional dietary rules 143 to his dear servant Abdul, himself a faqīr, our saint gave advice on how to live a ‘faqīri’ life narasimhaswami reports that sāī Bābā told him: “eat very little Do not go in for a variety of eatables 137 narasimhaswami, Charters and Sayings, 115 138 An oblique link of sāī Bābā to yoga comes through the figure of Dattātreya Thus we read that the Brahman Kusa Bhav had as his guru one Datta Maharaj, who trained him in yoga and the raising of the energy of kuṇḍalinī At a certain point, he was told by his teacher to go to sāī Bābā, whom he referred to as his elder brother Kusa Bhav reached shirdi in 1908 and became an ardent follower of the faqīr, also purportedly obtaining from him the power to materialize the udī simply by holding forth his hands and remembering the saint’s name sāī Bābā, however, never gave him any upadeśa or mantra, though Kusa Bhav felt the loss of mantric exercise keenly Later on, the shirdi saint would have left Kusa Bhav under the care of one Datta Baba or Pakir (Faqir) shah, who would have told him that he and sāī Bābā were interrelated as persons belonging to the same order; see narasimhaswami, Life of Sai Baba, vol 3, 132-137 139 see ibid.,

“Have dhyan on what is read, and think ‘Who I am’ ”144Through his authority and charisma, sāī Bābā succeeded in creat-ing an atmosphere of harmony between Hindus and Muslims As shepherd notes, our sufi faqīr “was very socially adroit in maintaining a balance between two rival religious contingents in his following ”145 He disapproved conversion to a new religion146 and advised people to keep to their own faith 147 Indeed, if sāī Bābā advocated universality over sectarianism as supreme value, devotees were invited to preserve their religious affiliations even Christians he considered his brothers148 and he once sent away his devotee H s Dikshit who had been speak-ing ill of Christ and Christianity 149 The saint recommended inter-reli-gious brotherhood and tolerance, true to his conviction that all religions are but particular paths leading to one ineffable goal For this reason, sāī Bābā at some point renamed the masjid by the Hindu name of Dvārkāmāī, that is, ‘Many-gated Mother’, stressing the fact that people of all castes and creed were welcome to come As narasim-haswami writes: “Baba would not allow the Hindus to interfere with his loud recitals of Koran at night... nor would he allow the Rohilla to interfere with the Hindus’ religious practice Baba discountenanced intolerance in every class and in every person to Baba, vitthal and Allah were one and all saints were the same ”150 According to Rao Bahadur Dhumal, a Brahman pleader who first came to shirdi in 1907, sāī Bābā himself was above Hinduism and Islam i e transcended them 151 As

sAMPRADĀY1 Ramdas LambIntroductionThe concept of siddhi, technically translated with terms such as ‘per-fection’, ‘accomplishment’, or ‘mastery’, is more commonly under-stood in the West as yogic or supernatural power When the term first appears in the Mahābhārata, it refers to the skills or perfections that are attained through the performance of various practices and types of austerities (tapas, tapasya), which were often done in conjunction with yogic practices From the outset, those who did tapas and yoga traditionally separated themselves from the prevalent society so they could focus all their time and energy in their chosen pursuit Because of this, commoners knew little about them and thus looked upon them with both awe and fear The present day renunciants of India, known by general labels such as sādhu, swāmī, saṃnyāsī, etc , are the inheritors of and builders upon the tradition of siddhi seekers over the millennium, there have been a large number of ascetic orders, often centered around a particular type or set of tapas Many of these orders have disappeared, other have transformed into new orders, while some more closely maintain their ancient roots Among the largest existing ascetic orders is the Rāmānanda sampradāy 2 It is also one of the orders in which the practice of yoga and the quest for sid-dhis remains an integral part of its focus This chapter will begin with a brief overview of the development of asceticism and yoga in India as they are understood and relevant to the Rāmānandīs It will then focus 1 earlier versions of various portions of

plays in their lives origins of Yoga and the Quest for Yogic PowersArchaeological evidence from the Indus valley civilization point to the presence of ascetics and yogic practices more than four millennia ago some have theorized an early connection with an ancient sha-manistic tradition in India and associated undertakings that later became subsumed under yoga, since shamans, ascetics, and yogis all sought some form of transcendence and the attainment of knowledge and powers beyond the physical vedic chants mention a diversity of forms and suggest a relatively early development and elaboration of asceticism There is reference to those who willfully adopted a life of austerity, as well as to others who renounced life within the confines of the prevalent society altogether (saṃnyāsa) Ascetics were believed to have power that was developed through yoga and tapas such was the degree of power attributed to the practice of austerities that even the gods are said to have performed them 3 one type of ascetic men-tioned in the latter portions of the Ṛg Veda was the muni, who had long hair and lived a life of poverty and bodily mortification Munis were said to have mystical powers, presumably gained through their tapas The Atharva Veda tells of ascetics who use āsana and prāṇāyāma as well to attain spiritual powers In the text, prāṇa, or ‘breath’, is identified with the supreme spirit and the source of all life The vedic literature describes the rituals and various forms of wor-ship that brahmin priests used to propitiate the gods For them, the fire sacrifice arose as a primary means of appealing to and gaining benefits from the gods typically, these benefits included male prog-eny, wealth, strength, material prosperity, fame, etc However, during the period, there is a shift in the recognition of power in the vedic thinking “away from the gods and into the elements of ritual tech-3 M G Bhagat, Ancient Indian Asceticism (Delhi: Munshiram

invoke protection Gradually, the sounds themselves, when properly chanted, came to be seen as a source of power, and this is one of the factors that led to the knowledgeable and capable priest being elevated in position to the top of the social hierar-chy While the priest made offerings to his sacred fire, the ascetic lit the fire within through the performance of tapas (lit ‘heat’) While the

By the time of the later upaniṣads, tapas and yoga are accepted as integrated and integral forms of sādhanā (‘religious practice’) They are an important part of the teachings that were passed down from guru to disciple, and they were understood to be an important vehicle for awakening or attaining power Both the upaniṣads and the epics (Rāmāyaṇa and Mahābhārata) reference the use of dama (self-restraints), tapas, and vrata (vows) to gain control over one’s body and mind, as well as to gain siddhis The epics present practitioners of yoga as being primarily ascetic yogis (male) and some yoginīs (female), with little mention made of lay practitioners The practices are confined, for the most part, to those who have renounced the householder lifestyle and who focus on the practice of various forms of tapas and of yoga to acquire both siddhis and mukti (‘liberation’) The undertaking of intense vows as a part of their endeavors is also discussed The powers thus attained include levitation, controlling the thoughts of others, knowing past and future lives, and gaining power over certain types of spirits In the Rāmāyaṇa, the goddess Pārvatī undertakes extreme vows (ugram suvratam) and fasts for thousands of years to gain both ascetic power as well as Śiva’s favor 6 The text also tells of the sage viśvamitra, who took vows and endured various forms of tapasya for penance, first to gain worldly power and eventually to gain spiritual perfection 7 For most subse-quent ascetics, vows are seen to be fundamental for almost any worth-while accomplishment Yoga and siddhisPatañjali ’s Yogasūtra (YS) is a one of the earliest texts to organize and elaborate the yogic practices that ascetics have long used in their quest to attain knowledge and siddhis In the text, the latter term is found in reference to accomplishments, perfections, and powers Patañjali seems to say that the latter can also be acquired through birth, herbs, 6 vālmīki, Rāmāyaṇa (I 35 19-20) 7 Rāmāyaṇa (I 51-65)"},{"pageNumber":444,"pageContent":"yogic powers and the rāmānanda sampradāy431mantra recitation, and tapas (YS 4 1), but the primary focus of the text is on the attainment of mental and spiritual states, including self-awareness, non-attachment to the material world, calmness of mind, truth, non-violence, and surrender to the Divine some time after Patañjali ’s work, a series of ‘later’ or ‘minor’ upaniṣads began to appear, collectively known as the Yoga upaniṣads These contain many of the practices found in the YS plus additional teachings and undertakings several texts within the group, especially the Maitri Upaniṣad, have found popularity with members of the Rāmānanda sampradāy two other sets of ‘upaniṣads’ that focus specifically on asceticism appeared as well, the Śaiva and the samnyāsa upaniṣads some Rāmānandīs also have been attracted to these However, of all the upaniṣads, Rāmānandīs consider the vaiṣṇava upaniṣads to have the greatest importance and relevance to their lives and goals of these, there are three that focus on the worship of the Divine as Lord Rāma (or Rām), the Rāma Rahasya Upaniṣad, the Rāma Pūrva Tāpanīya Upaniṣad, and the Rāma Uttara Tāpanīya Upaniṣad They promote a sādhanā that combines ascetic and devotional practices for the attainment of siddhis, devotion (bhakti) to Rām, and liberation In the first of these, Rām is equated with Brahman, ultimate reality, truth, and being in the early or major upaniṣads, but in a clearly acces-sible and caring form.

mythology and legend 10 Most Rāmānandīs venerate svāmī Rāmānanda (circa 14th-15th century) as founder of their order While little actual evi-dence of him, his life, and his practices exist, there are stories about his various disciples that mention Rāmānanda as an important ascetic teacher and guru In addition, some sources suggest that a group of ascetics devoted to Rām were present in or around the 15th century in 9 earlier versions of some of the material in this section can be found in several previously published articles and chapters I have written (see References) 10 I n attempting to understand any Indian ascetic tradition, we are often left to depend on secondary sources for information, since ascetics have seldom ever writ-ten about themselves and their practices

lamb434north India These renunciants may well have been early followers of Rāmānanda or at least forerunners of his sampradāy tradition tells us that Rāmānanda was initially an ascetic in the Śrī sampradāy, an order founded in the eleventh or twelfth century by the south Indian philosopher/theologian Rāmānuja The latter’s viśiṣṭād-vaita philosophy became an important part of the developing vaiṣṇava tradition, and his order combined it with practices of asceticism, yoga, and devotion Rāmānanda’s attraction to these elements led him to join the order However, he eventually came to realize the degree to which a variety of post-Rāmānuja doctrines and rules discriminated against low caste, householders, and females, setting them apart as being inherently inferior and ritually impure Realizing them to be incompatible with his own spiritual path and values, he ultimately left the order along with other ascetics and devotees of his teachings and he started his own sampradāy since his disagreement was with the later inclusions, he kept much of the theology, philosophy, and ascetic aspects that Rāmānuja himself had promoted, while rejecting the bulk of the order’s caste and gender restrictions and other narrow social doctrines In developing the guidelines of his own monastic order, Rāmānanda drew on aspects of previous and existing ascetic traditions like the nāth Yogis, devotional movements like the Āḻvārs and Marathi sants, and prevalent elements of Rām bhakti like those in the Rāma upa-niṣads He emphasized that the primary goal of sādhanā should be liberation from bondage to the cycle of birth and death so that one can experience eternal love of and oneness with God, through the aspect of Rām The means to be used for the realization of this goal include both selfless devotion and renunciation of attachment to the material world Because of his inclusive social and religious beliefs, Rāmānanda attracted a widely diverse group, including individuals from many castes and occupations, women, householders, and even Muslims, the most famous of the latter being Kabīr Although he was a renun-ciant himself, this did not prevent Rāmānanda from teaching house-holders both ascetic and devotional practices Consequently, the current Rāmānanda sam pradāy has an enormous lay membership that closely and regularly interacts with and supports the ascetics of the order Rāmānandīs traditionally refer to the founder of their order as a great yogī and a siddha, yet there is little actually known, even within the order itself, the

existence attracted people from various castes and occupations to follow him into a life of renuncia-tion This tradition of drawing renunciant and lay followers from many castes has continued up to the present day Currently, the Rāmānanda sampradāy has the largest number of virakt (‘renun-ciant’) members of any Hindu order, an estimated one and a half mil-lion 12 Commonly referred to as ‘Rāmānandīs’, ‘vairāgīs’, ‘tyāgīs’, or simply ‘sādhus’, most members come from villages in the northern and western states, especially uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Gujarat 13 since they bring with them elements of their own religious cultures, the diversity of the order’s beliefs and practices shows not only the influence of previous ascetic movements but also of a variety of regional religious traditions and practices Thus, the present-day order represents a contemporary manifestation of a long tradition of renunciants who practice both yoga and asceti-cism For all Rāmānandīs, Rām bhakti is the primary form of sādhanā, and for most it is also the central goal even for those who seek libera-tion from rebirth, devotion to Rām is a fundamental part of the path However, Rām bhakti takes on a different form than what is more commonly found and practiced in relationship to Kṛṣṇa As evidenced in the Bhagavadgītā and the subsequent Bhāgavatapurāṇa, devotion to Kṛṣṇa became incorporated relatively early into the brahmanical tradition and absorbed a variety of orthodox elements as a conse-quence The Rām tradition, on the other hand, remained more dis-tant, both philosophically and geographically from the orthodoxy, and from brahmanical influences An indication of this is the lack of any Purānic text dedicated to Rām as there are for the other major dei-ties of the day Among the main reasons for this peripheral status may found in the Rām story itself scholars place the writing of the earliest 11 This story of the birth of the famous Kabīr is common among Hindus, while Muslims reject it, saying he was born into a Muslim family 12 This number is based on a 1990 study done by the Akhil Bhāratiya sādhu samāj, an organization of renunciants and others connected with the tradition 13 The terms ‘vairāgī’ and ‘tyāgī’, which are used in specific reference to ascetic members of the Rāmānandī order, come from the sanskrit ‘vairāgya’ (‘non-attach-ment’) and ‘tyāga’ (‘renunciation’), respectively The term, ‘sādhu’, on the other hand, can be used as a general term for any Hindu ascetic"},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":"yogic powers

at the time of the earliest writing of the text In addition, much of the story of the life of Rām takes place when he is an ascetic, away from cities and from the ortho-dox tradition Those in whom he places his greatest trust in the story include a low caste boatman (Guha), a demon (vibhiṣaṇ), and a mon-key (Hanumān), while he associates primarily with villagers and ascet-ics, and his entire army consists of monkeys and bears Likely influenced by these, the communities in which Rām bhakti became popular and predominated, then, were primarily comprised of low caste rural peoples, ascetics, and others who existed primarily on the periphery of orthodox Hinduism This allowed more diverse aspects and understandings of Rām bhakti to develop, and it made room for non-brahmanical elements to play a more pivotal role Integral to the sādhanā of Rāmānandīs is the reading of the Rāmca-rit mā nas of tulsīdās, as well as his other writings The Mānas, as the text is more popularly known, is written in Hindi rather than in sanskrit This makes it more easily read and understood by common-ers and ascetics without the need for brahmin interpreters as is almost always the case with sanskrit texts For this and other reasons, the Mānas has become the most popular scripture in all of north India and among the people of the Diaspora Hindu communities that began in the nineteenth century 14 Rām devotees give the Mānas the status of śruti, the level of sacredness assigned by the orthodox tradition to the vedas This status appropriation for the Mānas is first found in the text of an early Rāmānandī, nābhādās His Bhaktamāl relates a story in which tulsīdās’s writing of the text enraged the brahmin priests of varanasi, who put it to a test The Mānas was ultimately shown to be the superior to all the existing scriptures since that time, and with the influence of the Rāmānanda sampradāy, the text has become com-monplace throughout northern and central India Its verses are believed to have great power, are commonly recited by villagers throughout Hindi speaking regions, and are used regularly by Rām devotees to gain Rām’s blessings and favor Rāmānandīs use specific verses or sections for specific purposes In addition to the writings of tulsīdās, they also turn to a variety of other texts for inspiration and 14 These are the lands where low caste Hindus and some

the most popular of texts for Rāmānandīs are the Yogasūtra, the three sectarian Rāma upaniṣads, and the Haṭhayogapradīpikā By far, the most important individual practice for all Rām devotees is recitation of the name of Rām It is the focal point and centerpiece of all other forms of sādhanā It is the key to unlocking the wisdom, power, and devotion that is within Due to the power attributed to the name, vairāgīs believe it to be the most powerful of all mantras for almost any purpose since the majority of couplets in the Mānas con-tain the name of Rām, many have come to be used on the path to obtaining siddhis very few mantras used by the Rāmānandīs do not contain the name, the main exceptions being those addressed to Hanumān This is because it is said that when one prays or chants to Hanumān, Rām appears as well, and when one chants Rāmnām, Hanumān appears For Rāmānandīs, then, the majority of all prayer is directed to either ‘Rām Jī’, ‘sītā Mā’ (Rām ’s wife and female counter-part), or ‘Hanumān Jī’ 15 However, when one is seeking to obtain a siddhi, Hanumān is most commonly at the center of attention In addition to Mānas reading and Rāmnām, the practice of yoga, the per-formance of various forms of tapasya, and other elements have become integral in Rām bhakti sādhanā for Rāmānandī ascetics As will be discussed below, when these elements are combined in various ways, they create an extremely multifaceted corpus of practices avail-able to members of the order, and the way they are utilized depends upon the particular vairāgī practioner’s goal, be it power, liberation, devotion, or some combination of the three There are several sub groupings within the Rāmānanda sampradāy, and each tends to approach the issue of sādhanā a bit differently An understanding of these differences is an important precursor to understanding how sādhanā is viewed and performed First, all mem-bers of the order, both ascetic and householder, can be referred to as Rāmānandīs Those who take renunciant initiation are traditionally referred to within the order as ‘vairāgīs’ over time, some choose to take additional initiation into one of the order’s sub groups, each of which focus on a particular form or set of tapasya The most common 15 ‘ Rām Jī’, ‘sītā Mā’, and “Hanumān Jī’ are the ways in which the three divinities are referred out of respect by Rāmānandīs In deference to that tradition, I will use these titles hereafter"},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":"yogic powers and the rāmānanda sampradāy439of these initiations is called kāk dīkṣā (literally ‘ash initiation’), and its members take on the additional name ‘tyāgī ’ 16 They are expected to cover their bodies with ash from a sacred fire every day after bathing and perform specific types of tapasya at specified times throughout the year Their austerities are more extreme than most other vairāgīs and are thus generally believed to have more access to power and sid-dhis Rāmānandī Practice of Yoga and tapasyaIntegral to the sādhanā of nearly all vairāgīs is some practice of yoga technically, they see only the first six limbs of aṣṭāṅgayoga as some-thing that is ‘practiced’, since the last two are considered states of mind to be attained through the practice of the first six Yoga is believed to generate important physical and mental abilities These include greater control over the functions of the body, as well as the development of mental focus, will power, emotional stability, and intuitive perception It is hoped that such practices will also inspire wisdom and an emotional maturity that manifests as devotional and ethical behavior, but Rāmānandīs acknowledge that this is not always the case nevertheless, the various aspects of yoga are understood to be important tools for renunciants to gain a level of self control neces-sary to successfully live the ascetic life and to be able to devote oneself to the practice of tapasya together, yoga and austerities blend seam-lessly in the life of many vairāgīs and nearly all tyāgīs The practices are done to awaken power and powers unknown to and unobtainable by most humans and to take the practitioner beyond the realm of nor-mal abilities and consciousness and into a realm where psychic pow-ers are attainable From the time of dīkṣā, vairāgīs are taught the importance of both yoga and austerities as valuable and powerful tools for constructing their own individual ascetic life styles After their ini-tial efforts at these, some find them difficult or otherwise unappealing and turn instead to other forms of sādhanā, such as textual study, rit-ual performance, or service of their guru on the other hand, those who are attracted by the practices tend to dedicate a major portion of their waking hours and energy to learning yoga while performing 16 Many householders and others outside the order refer to all Rāmānandī sādhus as ‘tyāgī’, but within the order, this is not

individual Whether or not they practice all the aspects of Rāja Yoga, Rāmā-nandīs give deference to the system and all formally seek to imbibe its overall ethos and approach into their lives Initially, āsanas and prāṇāyāma are taught in conjunction with mantras to help prepare the body and mind to practice concentration (dhāraṇā) and enhance efforts to withdraw focus from the things of

of fasting, yoga helps to maintain strength and resistance to weakness and subsequent ill-ness during such undertakings When performing tapasya, mental control is also important and yoga aids here as well As vairāgīs and tyāgīs incorporate such practices into their individual sādhanā, the importance and the value of taking vows and making commitments are integral for these provide both incentive and strength to make greater strides on the path to power, liberation, and devotion Vrat, Sam.kalp, and Anụṣtānvows, fasts, promises, and associated practices are fundamental to the Hindu ascetic life The fruits and the power generated by sādhanā are believed to be enhanced when vows are involved; the more strict the vows and the more severe the practices, the greater the power Contemporary Hindu culture uses an assortment of terms to distin-guish various types of vows and promises some of the more common words that can be translated as ‘vow’, ‘oath’, or ‘promise’ are: bacan (or vacan), śapath, and pratigya. each of these can be utilized in a vari-ety of contexts However, because they frequently possess a secular connotation, Rāmānandīs do not find them befitting their particular practices and instead employ three distinctive and precise terms to describe what they do in this regards: ‘vrat’, ‘saṃkalp’, and ‘anuṣṭān’ 18Vrat (skt: vrata)—Vrat is usually translated as ‘fast’ or ‘vow’ and refers to some form of sensory restriction or regulation, such as fast-ing, silence, celibacy, etc A vrat can last for a day, a lifetime, or any period between There are certain vrats that all vairāgīs are expected to take upon initiation and adhere to throughout their lives, such as veg-etarianism, no consumption of alcoholic drinks, celibacy (for the most part), and certain restrictions on occupational activities and modes of dress 19 In addition, they may take vows limiting speech, sleep, or any 18 Because Rāmānandīs nearly all speak a dialect of Hindi and used Hindi pro-nunciation of sanskrit terms, the transliteration of terms from here on in the chapter will reflect their pronunciation 19 Celibacy is actually the least emphasized in practice of the first three vows mentioned The reason for this is that consensual sex is not seen as bad or harmful to anyone as such The main reason for the restriction is that sex is considered a waste of important vital energy that is necessary for progression on the path to enlighten-ment"},{"pageNumber":455,"pageContent":"ramdas lamb442of a large variety of other activities A vrat can be of a more traditional nature, such as those mentioned above, or it can be a distinctively and individually formulated endeavor, such as not sitting down, living under no shelter, limiting body covering to a loin cloth, or wearing nothing made of cotton, silk, or wool Vrats are seen as strength build-ers of both body and mind For Rāmānandīs, an ascetic’s vrats are what determine the quality and extent of his renunciation and are among the most significant characteristics that distinguish a vairāgī or a tyāgī from a gṛhasth (‘householder’) They are tools to facilitate sepa-ration and freedom from a strictly sensual pleasure-seeking existence in the material world, so the enactment of any type or length of vrat is considered a form of tapasya not only do they mark the vairāgī’s entrance into the ascetic life, but they enhance the development of will power and prepare an individual for more in depth forms of sādhanā, including those done with the goal of attaining siddhi There is a corpus of vrats that are regularly practiced by all vairāgīs, but the specific ones to be undertaken are ideally self-chosen, since members are expected to fashion their own particular sādhanā based on their personality, level of willpower, and spiritual maturation Most vrats are either periodic, such as fasting on tuesdays, or last for short periods, from one to 40 days Vairāgīs who are drawn to a par-ticular vrat may undertake it for an extended period, depending upon the vow itself as well and the intention behind it For certain vrats, the length may be as long as twelve years, the time span traditionally considered optimal for success in gaining the siddhi associated with such vrats Because very few vairāgīs actually under-take these practices, those who commit to and are well established in such vows may become identified by and with their undertaking For example, one who is currently undertaking or has fulfilled a vow to keep silence for twelve years, might be given the name ‘Maunī Bābā’ (‘Revered silent one’) If the vow is particularly difficult and is fully completed, then that vairāgī may continue to be addressed with this type of honorific title even after his vrat has ended Within the order, there are always vairāgīs performing ascetic practices who act both as sources of inspiration and as upagurus (literally, ‘assistant teachers’) for younger sādhus to guide them in the practices they are personally doing newer vairāgīs are encouraged to look to more experienced members of the order for such guidance, but it is ultimately up to the individual to develop a sādhanā that will inspire a personally deeper sense of vairāgya and bhakti"},{"pageNumber":456,"pageContent":"yogic powers and the rāmānanda sampradāy443Hindus believe that until individuals become enlightened and tran-scend all attachment to material existence, their actions create karma Adhering to this, Rāmānandīs traditionally direct or dedicate the karma of their sādhanā for a specific purpose This may be for the attainment of devotion, for world peace, or for a specific benefit for another individual, etc once a vairāgī decides to commit to more intense or involved vrats, especially those that are enacted for longer periods, the process is begun with a conscious expression of intention and commitment, known as the taking of a saṃkalp Saṃkalp (skt : samkalpa)—Rāmānandīs underscore the impor-tance of intentionality in the performance of any action, especially a religious endeavor, for it is understood that one’s objectives and inten-tions influence not only the success or failure of one’s efforts but also the fruit or karma that is accrued as a result They traditionally begin any vrat or other form of vow taking with a saṃkalp (lit ‘definite intention’ or ‘determination’) The mantras used in reciting a saṃkalp usually begin with the propitiation of the deity or form of the divine to whom the efforts are being directed 20 The individual then recites his own name and, in précis, his denominational affiliation and its his-tory, to remind him of the tradition from which he comes and the responsibility he faces in undertaking the vow Finally, he specifies the particular forms of sādhanā and tapasya to be done, as well as the intended goal or recipient of the fruit of the undertaking Rāmānandīs also view saṃkalps as carefully conceived promises and resolve to successfully complete specified actions Because they are viewed as sources of power that must, if at all possible be com-pleted, unfulfilled saṃkalps are like an unkept promises and are believed to result in negative karma, the degree of which is influenced by the reasons for the failure In a verse from the Mānas, King Daśarath attests, ‘It is better to die than go back on your promise’ Dying, there-fore, in an attempt to complete a saṃkalp is actually seen as auspi-cious and beneficial, since it shows a commitment that transcends attachment to the physical body Young vairāgīs are told about the importance of letting go of physical attachments, and there are vari-ous examples of this in the order for initiates to observe and learn from several years after becoming a vairāgī, I had the opportunity to witness more closely what that commitment can mean 20 For vairaāgis, there are three forms of the divine to whom nearly all efforts are

continuing on his journey into the higher mountains We did not speak together much, but the words we did share were about sādhanā, non-attachment to the physical body, and the need to use the former in order to achieve the latter When asked about his onward plans, he replied that he was going to a cave I was familiar with in the mountains north of my home to perform an anuṣṭān (a spiritual retreat during which one practices a related body of vrats and disciplines). since it was already november, the cave was nearly 14,000 feet elevation, and I knew that it would soon be covered with snow, I asked him how long he planned to stay there He smiled and replied, “Jab tak” (‘until then’) I sensed at that moment that he knew he may not return alive He seemed quite clear in his intention and resolve to push his current physical body as much as possible in attempting to transcend attachment to it When he departed a few days later, he seemed happy and had a look of both contentment and commitment on his face As the snows began to melt the following spring, I received word that the Indian military stationed in that area of the mountains had found the body of a young Rāmānandī sādhu in the cave 21not all saṃkalps are as severe, but all are meant to be taken seri-ously and committed to only after deep reflection upon the responsi-bilities and consequences of the undertaking The making of a saṃkalp is viewed as an opportunity to clarify and recall one’s resolve and commitment to the ascetic life, framed as it is in vow-taking some sādhus will repeat a saṃkalp every morning during their prayer ritu-als, earmarking the fruits of the day’s sādhanā Many see this ritual as a means of keeping their focus and making a daily affirmation to the single-minded attainment of their goal, be it mukti or bhakti Prac-tically speaking, shortened forms of the saṃkalp statement are gener-ally done as preparation for one’s daily sādhanā, but vairāgīs almost always do a full saṃkalp when initiating a new vrat or as a part of an anuṣṭān (skt: anuṣṭāna)21 Ramdas Lamb, “Devotion and Reincarnation as Factors in Hindu Ascetic Prac-tices,” in Cross Currents (new York: Association for

anuṣṭān means to Rāmānandīs, but the contemporary concept of a ‘spiritual retreat’ comes somewhat close An anuṣṭān typ-ically consists of a set of vrats, initiated by a specific saṃkalp, for a predetermined time period During its performance, the combination of related vrats and practices becomes the primary focus of the life of the performer It can last for almost any period, from as few as nine days up to a year or more some sādhus will continue practices begun in an anuṣṭān for their entire lives Anuṣṭāns often involve a degree of isolation from others so all one’s energy can be devoted to the com-mitted practice or set of practices In some cases, two or more vairāgīs will engage in an anuṣṭān together, with the primary sādhanā of one of them consisting of caring for the needs of the other(s) involved It is believed among vairāgīs that a person who serves and cares for another who is engaged in an anuṣṭān gets a portion of the spiritual merit or power gained by the undertaking Young vairāgīs are expected to experiment with anuṣṭāns, initially those that last for short periods of time These serve two primary pur-poses: to introduce initiates into a deeper individualization of their personal focused practice, and, more importantly, to serve as a test of their abilities and resolve If young renunciants cannot successfully undertake these initial efforts, then they are generally not considered to have the qualifications for success as a sādhu and may be encour-aged to abandon the lifestyle However, those who succeed and exhibit the qualities for further success are encouraged in their efforts by elders in the order At some point, they will likely be taught some forms of sādhanā that are more prevalent in the practice of tantra, although many

their uses and misuses The various orders have recognized value in having powers and abilities, yet warn their members about the dangers as well Although the siddhis themselves can be problematic, it is often the desire to acquire them that becomes an addiction and can be thus more dangerous since the traditional goal in ascetic schools is liberation from attachment to the physical"},{"pageNumber":459,"pageContent":"ramdas lamb446body and the material world, anything that enhances that attachment is counterproductive to the goal If an ascetic who is striving for free-dom becomes bound to the temporal self through an addiction to sid-dhis and the quest for them, then not only will his further progress be halted, it is very likely to be reversed The Rāmānandī understanding of the role of siddhis in their lives takes this problem into serious con-sideration, and there is often debate by ascetic members of the order over the perceived degree of danger that exists in their pursuit several terms associated with power are prevalent within the Hindu tradition The most common of these is ‘śakti’ Although the word can and does refer to the feminine aspect of the Divine as well, it is typi-cally understood to refer to ‘power’ in a generic way In itself, it has neither a positive nor negative quality when used in this sense Śakti can be manifested physically, mentally, emotionally, or materially, and it can be either used or misused on the most physical level, a thing such as a charged battery or a motor can be said to have śakti Places and other things are also said to have śakti, this is meant in a more subtle and spiritual sense, such as the śakti of a temple, venerated places such as the Himalayas, or a tulsī plant, for example A practice can awaken śakti, and a person can naturally or through actions possess śakti The best way to translate the Rāmānandīs’ use of the term ‘siddhi’ would be as ‘supernatural faculties’ or ‘supranormal powers’ They perceive any ability as a form of power There are those that most peo-ple have, such as the ability to walk, talk, think, eat, and so forth Then, there are the powers that exist beyond what most people have in the natural course of human life several such abilities can be seen, then, as supernatural in that they are a part of a realm of existence that is above what is common or ‘natural’ Whether an ability or power becomes labeled as a siddhi is, to some extent, a matter of interpreta-tion Rāmānandīs see ‘siddhis’ as powers that come through an ‘accom-plishment’ or ‘perfection’ of some sort, provided that which a vairāgī has perfected brings with it a significant degree of power beyond what is believed to be available to the ‘normal’ human For example, a per-son who is able to perform a yogic posture perfectly and without any movement for a certain period of time, such as padmāsana for 24 hours, is said to have obtained the siddhi of that pose When an

poli-ticians and businessmen, would visit him to gain his blessings before starting a new movie, election campaign, or business venture A com-monly heard story in north India is that Dr Rajendra Prasad (b 1884), Independent India’s first president, said that when he was a youth, his father had taken him to see Deoraha Bābā, a respected reli-gious figure at the time During the 1970s, several octogenarians from Prayag told me they had seen him at the various Kumbha Melā festi-vals in their town when they were very young, and that he appeared the same then as when they related their stories so many years later Deoraha Bābā’s longevity apparently came about through a prac-tice known as kāyākalp During fairly regular visits to see and listen to him throughout the 1970s and several times during the 1980s, I had regular opportunities to talk with his primary vairāgī disciple who traveled with him and cared for his needs According to his disciple and others who knew him, Deoraha Bābā’s kāyākalp practice involved a one to three month anuṣṭān, in which he would not sleep, speak, or eat (except for certain herbs), and would remain in a state of great yogic meditation He began doing the ritual in the early twentieth cen-tury, and would undergo it every 20 years or so after that The disciple also said his guru stopped wearing clothes and stopped eating some-time in the mid-twentieth century, although he would occasionally drink a glass of milk even the last time I saw him shortly before he left his body in 1989, his voice was strong, his mind seemed sharp, and

physi-cal strength over time, many vairāgīs become adept at various forms of sā -dha nā Those who are attracted by more intense practices and have the desire and will power to immerse themselves deeply in such activ-ities will likely incorporate into their sādhanā elements that are reflec-tive of some of those found in various tantric schools and traditions for gaining psychic powers and siddhis These practices include the recitation of certain types of mantras, the performance of specific rit-uals, the inclusion of a variety of visualization techniques, and prayers to certain types of spirits, all coupled with more extreme and concen-trated forms of tapasya For the purpose of this chapter, these prac-tices will be referred to as tantra, acknowledging the reticence many Rāmānandīs have in using the term Also, when discussing the issue of tantra, two elements have the greatest relevance The first deals with the source of power, or siddhi, and the second addresses its intention and use (prayog) Both are categorized using the traditional Hindu threefold classification of guṇas (‘qualities’, ‘characteristics’) which consist of ‘tamas’ (based in darkness, ignorance, negativity, immoral-ity, etc ); ‘rajas’ (based in passion, selfishness, obsession with self ben-efit, etc ), and ‘sattva’ (based in purity, cleanliness, healthy, morality, selflessness, etc ) 23The intention of any form of sādhanā, from a simple prayer to an elaborate tantric ritual, goes a long way to determining its quality When the intention is centered around love of God, then such sādhanā is almost always sāttvic When it is done with the overarching goal to benefit someone materially or sensually, it is rājasic If it is done with the goal of attaining a siddhi to be used for personal material benefit or in a way that causes injury, either by direct intention (see māran prayog below) or as an obvious consequence, it is tāmasic In addition, there are obviously gray areas between the categories and room for justification of actions that may normally be looked down upon by others Most vairāgīs avoid all rājasic and tāmasic forms of sādhanā, unless they believe that have a very good reason to do otherwise Rāmānandīs acknowledge the existence of the eight siddhis com-monly referenced in Hindu writings and tradition, but warn of the potential for misuse, especially those that directly affect the external 23 The interpretation given for each guṇa refers to the general way they are understood by Rāmānandīs"},{"pageNumber":462,"pageContent":"yogic

negative and have the potential of causing an opposite to that which is sought For example, one who attempts to attract another (mohan) but does the requisite mantras and rituals improperly will cause the other person to develop a dislike or even hatred for the one who did the performance; one who unsuccessfully performs māran prayog may die instead of the intended victim The six non-sāttvic uses are: mohan (create a feeling of attraction in another), uccāṭan (cause mental confusion or prevent one from completing a function), vaśikaraṇ (gain control over someone), vidveṣan (cause enmity between individuals), stambhan (prevent a person from doing an activity), and māran (cause death or life threatening injury) of the six, the last one is obviously the most dangerous even if done cor-rectly and the person against whom it was performed dies or is seri-ously injured, the one who performs the ritual accrues the negative karma of that action, no matter how justified the act in his mind Vairāgīs and tyāgīs traditionally avoid any involvement with the powers listed above However, as they progress along the path to the Divine and have a need for additional ‘help’, they are told to strive instead for those among the variety of ‘minor’ siddhis that will have practical application in their lives These include: freedom from hun-ger and thirst, freedom from the effects of weather (heat or cold), abil-ity to control heart beat, metabolism and blood pressure, knowledge of the three times (past, present, future), the ability to read the minds and karmic status of others, the ability to cure most illnesses, longev-ity, and the ability to speak to and control the actions of wild animals some say knowledge of palmistry and astrology are also siddhis, while others disagree The Mānas provides examples of either the use or misuse of all the major siddhis and many of the minor ones, and this serves as a guide for how they should be utilized 24 The eight and their associated powers are:1 Āṇimā—make one’s body extremely small 2 Mahimā—make one’s body extremely large3 Garimā—make one’s body extremely heavy4 Laghimā—make one’s body extremely light 5

internal and is where all the relevant minor siddhis have their origins Depending on how they are awakened and used, these powers can have the qualities of any of the three guṇas mentioned above The sec-ond source is external, coming from the spirit world The easiest sid-dhis to obtain from here are from lower spirit forms and are typically seen to have the characteristics of rajas or tamas The last and highest source of power is either directly from Rām Jī, or through sītā Mā or Hanumān Jī since Rām Jī is omnipresent, this source is both internal and external and is always of the quality of sattva In the case of the first source, because these powers are internal, they are ever present and thus need not be obtained but only awak-ened Yoga is fundamental for this, especially when coupled with vari-ous forms of tapasya one of the first of the tantric style practices to be included in a vairāgī’s sādhanā to awaken inner power is the use of visualizations As vairāgīs learn the process, they are able to both awaken and direct the subtle power contained in the inner energy cen-ters (cakras) According to the yoga tradition, there are seven cakras in the body, and each contains a particular form of energy, can facili-tate a specific siddhi, and is also associated with particular personality characteristics If one wants to develop a power or ability connected with a specific cakra, then the various yogic practices that help to cleanse, purify, and awaken the energy of that cakra are performed When working with cakras, the term for the subtle inner energy is ‘kuṇḍalinī’ This is visualized as a serpent sitting at the base of the spine with her tail in her mouth on being awoken, she begins the journey up the spine At each cakra, she is stopped until the site is opened, cleansed, and purified, at which time she can flow through it adding to her energy that which is associated with the site The per-sonality traits connected with the site are also empowered and puri-fied, and the siddhi associated with the cakra is attained For example, if one wants to become a good speaker on and teacher of Rām bhakti, the two cakras on which one’s attention would be focused are those connected with the heart and the throat The former will aid in the attainment of a devotional attitude, wisdom, and strength, while the latter will help to make one’s words more effective and influential on the listeners various mudrās (hand gestures) and bandhas (muscle constrictions) are used during breath control and concentration prac-tices in order to increase the śakti that is awakened Because of the"},{"pageNumber":464,"pageContent":"yogic powers and the rāmānanda sampradāy451subtle nature of this process, there are strict dietary and lifestyle restrictions placed on these efforts In addition to bhakti, the most important of these siddhis that are relevant to the lives of all renunciants, as well as the foundation of all the other powers, is the ability to control bodily functions and needs Many of the common forms of tapasya are undertaken for this pur-pose Fasting, living in constant exposure to the weather with little or no clothing, going without sleep for long periods, and intensive prac-tice of the various yogic limbs all help one to awaken these abilities Intellect and critical thinking are not necessarily a requirement, and this can be either good or bad The positive side of the non-intellectu-alization of praxis is that an obsession with dualistic thinking is less likely, and one tends to have a greater ability to focus more on process as well as accomplishment The downside is that psychological reflec-tion on the propriety and ethics of the subsequent use of any powers gained may be less likely to occur Rāmānandīs pray to a variety of deities besides those specifically from within the Rām bhakti tradition (i e Rām Jī, sītā Mā, Hanumān Jī) Ascetics may include prayer to Śiva as Yogirāj (‘King of the yogis’), to a departed siddha, or to a guru to help them be successful in their various forms of tapasya Most other deities to whom prayers are offered are female, such as Lakṣmī for material prosperity necessary for sustenance, sarasvatī for knowledge or musical ability to aid in one’s sādhanā, or Durgā for wisdom and strength typically, such prayers and their fruits are seen as sāttvic The easiest source from which to obtain siddhis, however, is from spirit world beings such as bhūt, pret, piśāc, and other similar beings These are among the various primarily negative spirits that most Hindus believe exist, somewhat similar to the western concepts of ‘ghosts’ and ‘spirits’ that have not experienced human life Although the only powers obtainable from them are of the non-sāttvic types mentioned above, they are seen by some to be useful nevertheless Due to the relative ease of acquisition, some ascetics who seek siddhis will settle for and even become addicted to the powers obtained from such spirit forms If Rāmānandīs seek power from these sources, they will typically hide their actions from other members of the order not only is this approach to powers looked down upon, but it is

began to reveal his own interest in its power rather soon after initiation At first, his guru paid little attention to his comments, hoping that bhakti sādhanā would help lead him to a more sattva guṇa way of thinking The following year, he went wandering on his own, a traditional practice for many sādhus, and when he returned two years later, he disclosed to some of his vairāgī brothers that he had been secretly studying tantra in nepal He was immedi-ately warned about the dangers of what he was doing, especially since he had not disclosed this to his guru He soon left again to wander on his return the following year, he let it be known to several more people that he had become deeply involved in tantric sādhanā When his guru found out, he made it clear to his disciple that he must stop the practice or he would be kicked out of the ‘family’ He said that he would stop, but many of us knew that he would likely continue because of his obvious obsession with the power of tantra A

many abuses, and begged for his assistance The sādhu agreed to help him There was a temple near the village where the sādhu went to begin preparation for a nine-day anuṣṭān Although he made sure no other villager became aware of his plans, several vairāgīs came to know that he was planning to perform a māran prayog ritual and besieged him to not go through with it He remained steadfast in his

reached his guru, the sādhu was immediately ousted from his guru family and prohibited from associating with any of its members nevertheless, the sādhu became both famous and infamous in the eyes of villagers in the region, and many sought his assistance for a large variety of problems The tantric sādhu left the area and moved into another region of India, where he became a popular tantric teacher with a rather large following He also became an alcoholic, and his body began to age fairly rapidly He still has a rather large following in the region where he lives, but he appears far older than his chronological years, now needs help in walking, and has a variety of rather serious health prob-lems More recently, he has sought reconciliation with his Rāmānandī guru, claiming that

lightening’) are always of the quality of sattva nothing asked for will be attained unless it ultimately provides spiritual benefit Practically speaking, Rām Jī is rarely approached directly for siddhis, since he represents ultimate, non-dualistic Reality in which such powers are irrelevant Although the most popular form of Rāmānandī sādhanā is Rāmnām, this is done almost solely for devotional pur-poses nevertheless, vairāgīs will recite prayers such as the Rāma Rakṣa Stotram and certain verses or sections from the Mānas to gain his blessings or protection Additionally, prayers to sītā Mā are funda-mental for vairāgīs wishing to overcome sexual desires and physical attraction to females Through certain prayers found in the Mānas and in other of tulsīdās’s writings, it is believed that sītā Mā will grant the siddhi to be able to see all females as daughters, sisters, or mothers, depending upon their ages in relation to the vairāgī seeking the power The importance of this power, or ability, cannot be overemphasized,"},{"pageNumber":467,"pageContent":"ramdas lamb454since most vairāgīs do not spend their lives separate from females 25 Although there may not be daily interaction, for most there is regular contact, as a consequence of which any existing sexual longings may be awoken, stimulated, or enhanced For vairāgīs, one of sītā’s pri-mary roles as the Divine Mother is to aid them in both sublimating sexual desires and in transforming them into devotional energy Just as one’s sexual desires are not stimulated by the presence of one’s mother, so the presence and blessings of sītā Mā are believed to help create a similarly non-sexual relationship with all females Hanumān Jī is, by far, the one to whom most vairāgī prayers are directed, whether it be for devotion or for the purposes of gaining power and siddhis The Hanumān Cālīsā says that sītā Mā blessed him to be the grantor of the eight siddhis and nine niddhis (nine forms of material prosperity) Thus, he is the one to whom vairāgīs naturally turn When one Rāmānandī teacher was asked if Rām Jī grants powers or if only Hanumān Jī does so, his response was emblematic of Rāmānandī theology as well as thinking in this regards:When you pray to Rām Jī for something, Hanumān Jī will take care of it, since that is his job When you pray to Hanumān Jī for something, it is, after all, Rām ji whose power you receive, since he is the ultimate source Therefore, it doesn’t matter to whom you pray, all power is Rām Jī’s, and the deliverer is Hanumān Jī 26The same teacher further noted,In the divine play of life [divya līlā], Rām Jī takes many forms, but all are him In his līla, we respect his various forms, knowing that all are him ultimately, only Rām Jī exists even sītā Mā is not separate but is his creative energy everything is him This syllogistic blending of both dualistic and non-dualistic thinking is common in many schools of Hinduism and integral in the forma-tion of Rāmānanda theology There are various prayers and texts and a multiplicity of ways in which Hanumān Jī is propitiated for protection, powers, and devo-tion Prayers to him are also believed to develop both physical and psychic power Among the most popular textual sources for such prayers are the Mānas, especially the Kiṣkindhakāṇḍ and sundarkāṇḍ 25 Tyāgīs and

for example, we do not learn how sāṃkhyans live and what they do Yoga teaches a method to realize the sāṃkhya principles The Yogasūtra and the Vyāsabhāṣya elaborate on both theory and practice, and the practice of yoga leads to knowl-edge of the twenty-five sāṃkhya principles Knowing the twenty-fifth, the puruṣa principle, is the means to kaivalya The Vyāsabhāṣya is the 3 J A B van Buitenen, “studies in sāṃkhya (III),” Journal of the American Orien tal Society 77 (1957): 88–107 4 Gerald James Larson, “Introduction to the Philosophy of sāṃkhya,” in Sāṃkhya: A Dualist Tradition in Indian Philosophy, ed Gerald James Larson and Ram shankar Bhattacharya encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, vol Iv (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1987) 5 see the chapters by Angelika Malinar and David Gordon White in this book"},{"pageNumber":475,"pageContent":"knut a jacobsen462longest of the old texts of sāṃkhya philosophy available, although it represents a different school than the one referred to as classical sāṃkhya and identified with the Sāṃkhyakārikā tradition A signifi-cant part of the Yogaśāstra is about yoga powers In some yoga tradi-tions the attainment of yoga powers was the goal of their practice According to Vyāsabhāṣya, yoga powers are encountered in the yoga practice, but the goal is attainment of the separation of puruṣa from prakṛti. The powers are part of prakṛti, not puruṣa According to the sāṃkhya-Yoga theory of meditation, in the process in which the yogin attains perfection in mastering different tattvas, the yogin also

saṃnyāsin vow (became an ascetic) and devoted the rest of his life to the practice of sāṃkhya-Yoga He spent six years in solitude in the caves of the Barabar Hills in Bihar and for the last twenty-one years of his life (from 1926-1947) he lived in the cave Kāpil guha (“cave of Kapila”) of Kāpil Maṭh This was the origin of a distinct tradition of the guru being permanently confined in an artifi-cial cave 8 Hariharānanda Āraṇya remained in the cave for more than twenty years, the next guru Dharmamegha Āraṇya stayed in the cave for more than thirty years, and the current guru Bhāskara Āraṇya has been living there for around twenty-five years (since 1986) These are all self-imposed solitary confinements The only means of contact between the guru and the devotees is through a small window opening in the hall of the building It is not unusual in the Hindu tradition for sādhus to isolate themselves in caves for periods of intense meditation that may last for several years, but it is unusual that sādhus take the vow to never ever leave the inside of a cave The goal of sāṃkhya-Yoga, kaivalya, is isolation of the self, the puruṣa, from materiality, prakṛti, and its products The meaning of kaivalya is ‘isolation’ and ‘detachment’ Isolation of the guru in the cave can therefore be under-stood to symbolize the isolation of the self, puruṣa, from materiality, prakṛti Dwelling in the cave is a method of realizing the isolation of the self but is at the same time a statement of faith in the doctrine The goal of sāṃkhya of the self in isolation is mirrored in the isolation of the guru in the cave The self is absolutely passive and is separated from everything else It is a pure witness, a sheer presence, indepen-dent, and uninvolved Realization of the self means therefore to com-prehend the self as something it already is, independent and separate from materiality When all the changes in the mental organ (citta) 7 see Knut A Jacobsen, “In Kapila’s

wrote many books that attempted to explain every aspect of sāṃkhya-Yoga since the Yoga powers are such an important part of the Yogaśāstra, he therefore had to also give explanations of the powers In his writ-ings he tried to explain the superhuman powers attained by yoga prac-tice by relating them to the philosophy of sāṃkhya-Yoga, modern science, common sense, and the practice of magicians Mostly, he explains them by connecting them to the philosophy of sāṃkhya-Yoga sometimes, however, he explains them by relating the powers to modern science, common sense, and magicians and this is especially the case in his commentary on the Yogaśāstra, written in Bengali, but not in the commentary written in sanskrit, the Bhāsvatī Consequently, he may have had the audience in mind when he explained the powers in this way, and the reasons for relating them to modern science, com-mon sense, and magicians might have been pedagogical, to make the powers understandable for the readers When Āraṇya pays homage to his own guru, it is the extraordinary knowledge of the guru he emphasizes very little information is avail-able about Hariharānanda Āraṇya’s guru swāmī trilokī Āraṇya, but one thing Āraṇya reveals about him is that he was famous for his extraordinary knowledge He mentions this in a sanskrit poem called “Gurunamaskāra va utsarga” printed in the dedication to a book in Bengali published in 1902 In this poem, Āraṇya described his lineage of teachers, his guruparamparā, and he mentioned specifically that trilokī Āraṇya became famous for his supersensory knowledge (jña-nam atīndriya) 11 unfortunately, he does not elaborate on the particu-lar knowledge trilokī Āraṇya had attained 12 The mentioning of 11 The verses have been recently translated into english by

Maṭh, ‘supernormal powers’ seem to emphasize that trilokī Āraṇya had yoga powers which jñānam atīndriya most probably implies 12 According to the tradition of the Kāpil Maṭh, Hariharānanda spent

yogin, but had Āraṇya been crit-ical of the powers, he would not have referred to them in a homage to his guru The other facts that Hariharānanda relays about trilokī are that he lay on the ground meditating while wild creatures moved around him and that he wandered about without lifting his arm, not even to feed himself (that is, he never asked for alms) This emphasizes the extreme ascetic lifestyle of trilokī trilokī Āraṇya’s teacher was triputi Āraṇya, whose teacher Paraṃsvabhāraṇya, as described by Hariharānanda Āraṇya in his writings, made the light of sāṃkhya-Yoga burn in his disciple Āraṇya further informs that Paraṃsvabhā-raṇya learned sāṃkhya-Yoga from his guru Śrī Bhāsvataprajña Hariharānanda does not anywhere in his many texts elaborate further on this guruparamparā, so this is all that is known However, this shows that there was a living, albeit minor, tradition of sāṃkhya-Yoga ascetics in India at the time, and that Hariharānanda encoun-tered an ascetic who belonged to this tradition and was known for his supersensory or transcendent knowledge and who initiated him as his disciple views on superhuman PowersAccording to the Kāpil Maṭh tradition, Hariharānanda was critical of the exaggerated focus on yoga powers among sādhus and others he encountered He did not deny their reality but pointed out that focus-ing on yoga powers did not help in attaining the goal of sāṃkhya-Yoga However, since yoga powers are such an important part of yoga, they should not be denied In a book he wrote on the life of a yogin that was partly autobiographical and partly fictional, entitled A Unique Travelogue, he gives a favorable view of the yoga powers In this book he claims that superhuman powers possessed by the founders of reli-gions are the basis of these religions He argues that every religion is based on the founders’ superhuman powers He explains that he had spoken with “a so- called ‘all-knowing’ saint” (a saint who, according to Āraṇya, boasted of knowledge but had no self control) about con-centration and self-realization 13 This saint told the following story Through meditation, a man had acquired the power of

concentration] on the relation between space [ākāśa] and the body, according to Yogasūtra 3 42) When he returned home his brother asked what he had accomplished He then told his brother that he had attained the power of walking on water His brother sug-gested that they should go down to the river in order for him to prove this superhuman power The yogin then crossed the river on foot The brother took the ferryboat and paid a small coin to the ferry man He then ridiculed his yogin brother by saying that the value of his accom-plishment was only worth the small coin that he had paid The so-called ‘all-knowing’ saint took much pride in telling this story, Hariharānanda notes Hariharānanda further comments on the so-called ‘all-knowing’ saint that “such men were unable to appreciate the true value of spiritual attainment” and “could easily be lured by worldly possession ”14 He therefore has the narrator of the book tell the saint that he had told only half of the story After the brother had ridiculed the yogin, they took the same ferry to get back to the other side on the return journey halfway across the river, the boat capsized The brother fell in the water and was drowning However, the saint who could walk on water rescued him and thus brought him back to life He then said to the brother: “You have got back your life due to the superhuman power acquired through spiritual practice tell me now; what is the value of your life and for that matter the worth of special power ”15 The brother then responded: “I did not realize it before Your power is invaluable ”16 In this story, Āraṇya defends superhuman powers against an opponent who considered them val-ueless Here, he seems to see criticism of the value of superhuman powers as a criticism of yoga, religion, and spirituality itself The rea-son for this defense of superhuman powers is probably that in yoga there is a close connection between superhuman powers and faith Critique of the powers can therefore

brahmacārī in the hermitage of the maṭh in Kurseong in Darjeeling, he had an experience of being able to foreknow the future (see Yogasūtra 3 16, 3 33, and 3 36, prescience [prātibha] arises from the knowledge of puruṣa) It dawned on him that Hariharānanda Āraṇya would arrive that same day on the train and he wrote this premonition on a piece of paper with the date and time Later, when he went down the hill to the railway station at the scheduled time of the train’s arrival, he found the guru walking towards him Dharmamegha quietly gave the piece of paper to the guru However, the guru read it and immediately threw it away in an unceremonious fashion When Dharmamegha narrated this to the disciple, he said that by that simple act of throwing away the note as if it were dirt, his guru Hariharānanda had instilled in him the teaching that all superhuman powers, in whatever form they might appear, had to be completely avoided The disciple commented that the instruction that all superhuman powers are impediments on the path of yoga is also the message of Yogasāstra 3 37 Yogasāstra 3 37 states that superhuman powers can be hindrances when the yogin is in samādhi, but they can be valuable in ordinary life (te samādhau upasargā vyutthāne siddhayaḥ) one problem in the interpretation of this sūtra is, of course, whether the word ‘they’ (te) refers only to those powers mentioned in the previous sūtra (superhu-man abilities), to all superhuman knowledge mentioned in the previ-ous sūtras or to all jñānas, siddhis, and vibhūtis one argument in favor of the word ‘they’ referring to all the powers is that all the super-human powers disturb the one-pointedness of samādhi, and this is how the sūtra is usually understood Sūtra 3 36 marks the end of the treatment of superhuman knowledge and from sūtra 3 38 starts the treatment of superhuman powers of action Hariharānanda Āraṇya concludes the whole chapter on vibhūtis by commenting on Yogasūtra 3 55, stating that

argues that the superhuman power of knowl-edge called Prātibha or tāraka, described in Yogasūtra 3 33 and 3 54, stands in the way of attaining liberation only discriminative enlight-enment can cause liberation 25 Hariharānanda Āraṇya believed that yoga powers could be obtained from meditative fixation (dhāraṇā), meditation (dhyāna), and con-centration (samādhi) However, at the stage of meditative fixation (dhāraṇā) superhuman powers are not usually achieved, he com-ments He adds that they come rarely, if at all, and then in “small glimpses of foreknowledge of the future etc ”26 The example recounted by the disciple about the foreknowledge of the guru’s future arrival might perhaps be an example of superhuman abilities gained by the practice of meditative fixation (dhāraṇā) explanations of superhuman PowersA significant part of the Yogasūtra and the Vyāsabhāṣya deals with yoga powers Hariharānanda wrote explanatory commentaries, both in Bengali and sanskrit, on the Yogasūtra and the Vyāsabhāṣya As part of his explanation of every aspect of yoga, he also had to describe the yoga powers, but his comments on these are often brief This is a general tendency in most if not all of the commentaries on the Yogasūtra and the Bhāṣya How then did Hariharānanda explain the superhuman powers in his commentaries? What value did he assign to them? What characterizes his explanations? Common to the expla-nations are that he attempts to give rational accounts of the powers by relating them to different systems of knowledge A dominant pattern in Āraṇya’s writings is to explain the yoga powers by the sāṃkhya theory of the tattvas and the Yoga theory of samādhi to relate the powers to the tattvas is also common in Indo-logical scholarship 27 By mastering the tattvas, the yogin

referring to the all-pervading power of the buddhi The ability to see subtle objects, objects obstructed from view or far away knowledge does not come from the sense organs, but the objects are known directly through the buddhi 28 Further explanation is given in the commentary on Yogasūtra 3 26 Here, the same principle is used to explain the power of knowledge of the whole universe The buddhi is in reality ubiquitous, but ordinarily it is limited by the actions of the senses As these limitations disappear the power of buddhi increases and “one goes from higher to higher regions ”29 “From the point of view of buddhi there is no such thing as far and near ”30 He concludes:Thus Buddhi of each creature and the stellar regions are on the same plane, and the power of attaining them is gained when the vṛttis or modifications of Buddhi are purified 31Yogasūtra 3 38 states that when the movements of the mind are known the yogin can pass into another body He can withdraw the mind from his own body and project it into another person Āraṇya explains this by arguing that through concentration the knowledge “I am not the body” becomes established, the mind is set free from the body and can enter another body and influence it This explanation is also based on sāṃkhya theory The mind is a more subtle principle than the tattvas, which are the material causes of the body The explanation follows logically from the sāṃkhya theory of the tattvas The power to walk on water (Yogasūtra 3 39) is explained by Āraṇya by connecting the prāṇa called udāna to the nerve where the percep-tion of the bodily humors resides By meditating on the presence of sattva guṇa “in all the humors of the body, the body is felt to be light ”32 Also, the sāṃkhya theory is used to explain the power The guṇa sat-tva is lightness, and by focusing on sattva guṇa, the yogin experiences lightness The udāna is the ascending breath and represents the upward movement and, therefore, sattva guṇa The power to move

body as nothing but a collection of activities and vacant like ākāśa, is to think about the relationship between body and ākāśa This is done by contemplating the unstruck sound (anāhatanāda) pervading the body, he explains He continues to clar-ify that both the body and heaviness are products of the tattva ahaṃkāra (egoity) By controlling ahaṃkāra a person also controls the tattvas which have ahaṃkāra as their material cause Through the power of samādhi, the opposite of heaviness is conceived and the mat-ter of the body changes to lightness By contemplating the unstruck sound (anāhatanāda) pervading the body and controlling ahaṃkāra, the ability to move in the air is attained, explains Āraṇya 33 to explain the ability to understand sounds of all sentient creatures (Yogasūtra 3 17)

power of knowledge proceeds to the latter’s mind produc-ing the word and he comes to know the sense in which the word has been uttered 34Another pattern is to explain yoga powers by referring to the world of magicians since it is accepted that it is possible for magicians to perform acts similar to displays of superhuman powers, it is argued that it must be accepted that the same act can be performed by yogins Magicians in India often used the belief in yoga powers to make their tricks believable 35 There is a close relationship between yoga powers and the tricks of the magicians, and for Hindus and others there are often great difficulties in separating them The sacredness of gurus, yogis, and sādhus and the attitude of devotion to them is part of this, but the idea of superhuman powers allows the possibility for magi-cians and their performances to be given religious meaning Āraṇya explains some yoga powers by referring to how magicians trick their audience Āraṇya seems to

cakṣuḥprakāśāsamprayage ’ntardhānam) The Vyā -sa bhā ṣya explains that when the property of being visible is suppressed, the body ceases to be an object of observation by another person and the yogin can thus remain unseen by others Invisibility appears here to mean invisibility to an audience, and not only a subjective experi-ence of being invisible How does Hariharānanda explain this? He writes: “Magicians follow this system They exert their will-power on the spectators who see only such things as the former wants them to see ”36 He continues: “This shows how extraordinary things can be brought about by will-power It is no wonder, therefore, that yogins can, if they so will, make their bodies totally imperceptible to others ”37 Āraṇya uses ideas about magicians, which were common at the time, to explain a yoga power, and is perhaps influenced by the blending of ideas of magicians and yoga powers in Indian culture A third pattern in Āraṇya’s elucidations is to explain yoga pow-ers by means of modern science 38 Commenting on Yogasūtra 3 42, Āraṇya first uses the sāṃkhya teaching to explain the power to move in the sky, but then he adds support from modern science The body is just a collection of particles, he argues, “the minute particles or atoms are made up of even smaller particles like electrons, protons, and neutrons ”39 He writes:el ectrons move round a nucleus consisting of protons and neutrons millions of times in a second and between these two subtle entities there is a lot of gap (as between the sun and planets) our ego acting on the materials constituting the body shapes them into the form of a body and makes it feel heavy By concentrating on the relationship 36 Āraṇya, Yoga Philosophy of Patañjali with Bhāsvatī, 293 37 I bid 38 For an

application of common sense interpreta-tions of yoga powers; Yogasūtra 3 24 says that through saṃyama on physical strength the yogin can attain the strength of an elephant Vyāsabhāṣya elaborates on this and says that by saṃyama on Garuḍa (the bird vehicle of viṣṇu), the strength of Garuḍa is attained, and by saṃyama on the strength of vāyu (wind), the strength of vāyu is attained In other words, you gain the strength of that on which you perform saṃyama Āraṇya comments on this:All physical culturists know that by consciously applying the will-power on particular muscles, their strength can be developed saṃyama on strength is only the highest form of the same process 41Common sense is also used to explain the possibility of knowledge about the future He argues: “That we have knowledge of the future is amply proved by dreams that come true ”42 He argues that since it has been proven that the mind has the capability of knowing the future, it cannot be denied that such power can be further developed through practice The powers are, in general, explained by using sāṃkhya theory of the tattvas That different theories are used to explain the powers might reveal the author’s wish to make the powers understandable and to communicate with different persons The use of the example of science, common sense, and magic seems to show the eagerness to provide to the reader a rational analysis of every aspect of the Yoga-sūtra ConclusionThe theory of superhuman powers implies that, through the realiza-tion of the twenty-five sāṃkhya principles (tattvas), the individual gradually transcends the normal human limitations until the whole universe comes under the control of the buddhi, the most subtle prakṛti part of the individual According to sāṃkhya, all material 40

mūlaprakṛti The teaching of the superhuman powers expresses the gradual development in which the yogin experiences that he is coex-tensive with the universe Hariharānanda Āraṇya writes in his com-mentary on Yogasūtra 3 50: “When the powers of omnipotence and omniscience are acquired, the yogin becomes like almighty īśvara ”43 He continues: That is the highest state of Buddhi, Puruṣa with such adjuncts, i e such adjuncts and their seer combined, is called Mahān Ātmā or the Great self 44The great self, mahān ātmā or buddhi of a yogin who becomes like almighty īśvara is coextensive with the universe as it is the first prod-uct of the ultimate material principle, prakṛti and there is only one prakṛti Āraṇya writes: “As the seer, coming into contact with Buddhi as an object, brings it under his control, so by establishing contact with the basic constituent he brings everything under him It is said in the Śruti in this connection: ‘When Puruṣa is realized, omniscience is acquired’ ”45 By realizing the principle that is at the source of all expe-rience, the whole universe becomes part of the experience This explains how it would be possible, according to the sāṃkhya teaching, for Āraṇya to have had the experience of ‘becoming one with the uni-verse,’ described above The creator god, īśvara, was a previous siddha (pūrvasiddha) who attained omnipotence, omniscience, and the other superhuman powers A yogin who has attained superhuman powers ‘becomes like almighty īśvara’ However, he is unable to become the actual īśvara because he cannot alter the disposition of things ordained by the previous siddha (see Yogasūtra 3 45) He can transcend the dis-position of things, but he cannot alter them Like the Buddhist nirvāṇa that is beyond the abhjñās, the puruṣa is beyond the yoga powers:The state immediately higher than this is that of liberation to abide in the state beyond supernormal powers and omniscience, in which the self remains alone, is liberation 46 According to sāṃkhya-Yoga, the goal of yoga practice is nirodha The yoga powers are vṛttis (fluctuations) of the citta (mind, awareness) In 43 I bid , 33244 I bid , 332–333 45 on

of ‘primitive’ thinking nor the miraculous acts of some purely supernatural agent located outside the material universe Rather, they are now seen as the signs of a panen-theistic cosmos and ‘the

the middle of the last cen-tury), the history of psychical research and parapsychology, scientific studies of meditation, the mind-body mysteries of modern medicine (especially the fundamental aporia of the placebo effect), and, perhaps most interesting of all, the spontaneous paranormal experiences of modern-day athletes That all of this is iconographically crystallized on the recent Russian

self-understanding, is, at the very least, provocative 2 It also happens to fit seamlessly into the models of American-Asian metaphysical fusion that I have advanced in my cultural history of the human potential movement The latter movement’s origins can be traced back to september of 1962 and the founding of a symposia series in Big sur, California, that would soon morph into something called the esalen Institute of course, the human potential movement, as it eventually came to be called (in 1965, via the coinage of journalist and human potential author George Leonard, who was thinking of the civil rights movement upon which he had extensively reported and in which he had actively participated), also emerged from earlier streams of thought and practice These included centuries of what historian of American religions Catherine Albanese has called metaphysical reli-gion, the mystical theology of a Protestant theologian and stanford professor of comparative religion by the name of

tradition 3 one of the many things that struck me about this cultural history—and which jarred dramatically with my earlier assumptions—was the absolute centrality of ‘superpowers’ to the various public narratives and intimate personal experiences of the central historical actors Indeed, I was so struck and so puzzled by these super-patterns that I have spent the last five years doing little more than trying to trace their genealogies, tease out their theoretical implications, and follow their colorful leads through intellectual history and American popular cul-ture, particularly pulp fiction, science fiction, ufology, and the pop-mythologies of superhero comics and metaphysical film 4 Murphy’s metanormal capacities, it turns out, are everywhere And some of the most thoughtful interpreters have even suggested that such unusual human capacities are everywhere, literally, that is, that they are not capacities or powers at all, but entirely natural expres-sions of the shape of space-time or the mind-blowing subatomic behavior of matter—functions of the deeper structure of reality as it really and truly is beyond and before the a priori conceptual categories that structure our perceptions and thoughts In this stunning reading, which can be traced back to einstein himself (or Kant, with a little stretching), our experiences of space as always local and time as entirely linear and determinative are basically illusions space and time so construed are constructions of the brain and its neural pro-cessing, which have selected them out for adaptive and social reasons In some of the more radical and frankly mystical forms of this same reading, consciousness is understood to be fundamentally ‘nonlocal’ in its true scope and deepest nature, that is, consciousness as con-sciousness exists outside of space and time and is ‘filtered’ or ‘trans-mitted’ through the brain, not produced by it Refigured thus, uni versally reported human abilities like precognition (a kind of see-ing beyond time) and clairvoyance (a kind of seeing beyond local space), not to mention the innumerable experiences of transcendence in the history of religions, need not be read as

‘magical’, it turns out, may be fairly accurate descriptors of the true nature of Consciousness beyond culture, of Mind beyond brain one can easily see how some of this sounds more than a little like certain strands of Indian thought and practice (or Plato’s parable of the cave) one can also begin to understand—rather than ridicule—why the history of quantum physics is laced with both elite and popu-lar gestures to Asian religious ideas and symbols: why niels Bohr put the taoist yin-yang symbol on his coat of arms; why Wolfgang Pauli helped Carl Jung (ever attracted to the coincidentias of the tantric tra-ditions) fashion his category of synchronicity; why David Bohm was drawn to strike up a long, and very public, conversation with Krishna-murti; why physicist Fritjof Capra wrote a countercultural classic called The Tao of Physics; and why every decade since has seen literally dozens of books on the same physics-to-mysticism theme, with explic-itly tantric traditions like Kashmir Śaivism and vajrayāna or Mahā-yāna Buddhism playing central starring roles It is easy to dismiss such efforts, either from the quantum physics side (which I cannot possibly do) or the professional study of religion side (which I could easily do) It is much more difficult to explain why such comparisons remain so attractive and so compelling, and, most of all, why they continue to do important cultural work, with or without the scientist or scholar’s blessings 5 These various resonances, correspondences, even claimed identities between esoteric forms of religious thought and modern evolutionary biology and physics—what I have called the mysticism of science lit-erature (to distinguish it from science qua science)—constituted one of the major meta-themes of the history of

religious ideas and practices according to their own cultural needs, democratic val-ues, and philosophical convictions Here I have advanced a thesis 5 For more, see Kripal, Esalen, especially chapter 13, “Jacob Atabet and the tan-tra of Physics ”"},{"pageNumber":497,"pageContent":"jeffrey j kripal484about what I call ‘the tantric transmission’, a hypothesis that boils down to the suggestion that Americans tended to appropriate Asian religious ideas in very different ways in the two halves of the twentieth century: whereas the first half of the century witnessed a strong pref-erence for ascetic, orthodox, and highly philosophical forms (think Advaita vedānta and Theravāda Buddhism), the second half of the century showed an equally strong preference for erotic, heterodox, and tantric forms (think kuṇḍalinī yoga, śaktipāt, tibetan Buddhism, the Dalai Lama, and Zen) 6 This, of course, is not some sort of iron-cast rule The transmission was clearly set up in the first half of the twentieth century through major authors like sir John Woodroffe and the as-yet-unpublished, but glowing Gopi Krishna (who, by the way, co-founded a research institute with the quantum physicist Carl Freidrich von Weizsächer of the Max Planck Institute—the mysticisms of physics and evolution, in other words, came together here) Woodroffe and Krishna wrote books that would become modern metaphysical classics, The Serpent Power (1919) and Kundalini: The Evolutionary Energy in Man (1967), respectively The latter book, I might observe, appeared right smack in the middle of the counterculture There were also, of course, multiple exceptions to this tantric transmission, like the IsKCon movement of A C Bhaktivedanta swami Prabhupāda of the second half of the century, whose insistence on sexual abstinence and traditional bhakti or devotion to Kṛṣṇa were only heterodox and transgressive vis-a-vis the traditional Protestant parents of the young people who embraced such practices with drums, shaved heads, and ecstatic love such prehistories and exceptions aside, the general patterns of this tantric transmission, I continue to think, are quite helpful in thinking about the countercultural histories of Asian religions in America, including and especially the modern histories of yoga powers The sid-dhis, after all, have historically been associated strongly with the tantric traditions (themselves Asian countercultures of sorts), where they are generally celebrated and embraced in ways that conflict with the usual warnings and even condemnations of them one commonly encounters in the more orthodox traditions Perhaps that is one rea-6 I remain convinced that the most potent and telling example of my thesis is the absolutely central figure of Aldous

that among these consequences is a firm rejection of the traditional doc-trine of hell Myers, at least, suggests, “that endless life exists for all, with infinite possibilities of human redress and of divine justification ”13 toward the end of his life (or at least his book), in other words, Frederic Myers was moving toward a reincarnation model for his data “nay,” he writes, “as to our own soul’s future, when that first shock of death is past, it is in Buddhism that we find the more inspir-ing, the truer view That Western conception of an instant and unchange able bliss or woe ... is the bequest of a pre-Copernican era of speculative thought ”14 In short, by the turn of the century, thoughtful interpreters like Myers were already linking the assumed progresses of reincarnation and evolution, which of course transformed the original meanings of both terms within Asian religions and Darwinian biology in a profoundly positive, progressive, and world-friendly direction spiritualism had left its mark Myers’ reference to the Copernican revolution is also interesting And telling Myers no longer believed that Western europe was the center of the world, or that Christianity had some

or fully revealed by any single prism one might be tempted to call this a perennialism, except for the telling fact that, for Myers, the fuller truth lays in the evolving future, not in some past and perfect religious rev-elation “[n]o historical religion can persist as a logical halting-place upon the endless mounting way,” Myers wrote in his usual evolutionary mode, “yet many a creed in turn may well be close inwrought and inwoven with our eternal hope ”15 The religions were thus both true and false for Myers In his own terms again, “such words as natural Religion, Pantheism, Platonism, Mysticism, do but express or inten-sify varying aspects” of this theology’s “main underlying conception ” What is that conception? “That conception is the co-existence and interpenetration of a real or spiritual with this material or phenome-nal world ”16 A few pages later he will write of a “growth in holiness” that contains “no unreal opposition or forced divorcement of sacred and secular, of flesh and spirit ” This is that “rapture of love which we still strive to attain ”17 elsewhere he invokes Plato’s eros to capture this unity of flesh and spirit An at once physical and spiritual eros, in fact, was at the very center of Myers’ entire system and was the secret key to what he repeatedly called ‘the telepathic law’, that is, the mysterious, essentially erotic, forces that bind us all, but especially individuals who are passionally connected 18 Hence that most famous of his coin-ages: telepathy or tele-pathos Certainly Myers now desired a vast cosmos immeasurably grander than the Bible had imagined He thus takes a few swipes at the biblical creation stories and their puny worlds “What rest or pasture for the mind in the seven days of Creation, the four rivers of Paradise, the stars ‘made also’?” Myers asks Four rivers indeed Asia was far more imaginative and far bolder here “The farther east has reached blindly forth towards astronomical epochs, sidereal spaces, galactic congrega-tions of inconceivable Beings ” It has “created by one sweep of the imagination a thousand universes, to be the Buddha’s realm ”19 In short, Mahāyāna Buddhism This was an oddly modern

life, Frederic Myers, the coiner of telepathy and the premiere psychical researcher of the nineteenth century, was looking toward Asia And Asia was looking toward him If with a decidedly less Buddhist lens Like Frederic Myers, Auro-bindo Ghose (1872-1950) was a trained classicist Like Myers again, he received his classics training at Cambridge Afterwards, he returned to India and became a revolutionary freedom fighter in Bengal and then, after a long and famous legal battle, imprisonment, and political flight, a practicing yogi and metaphysical writer at the French enclave of Pondicherry (Puducherry) on the southeast coast of India It was probably at Cambridge that he heard about the work of Myers and the society of Psychical Research The Record of Yoga is a recently published, two-volume transcrip-tion of sri Aurobindo’s private journals, which he wrote to himself in order to track his yogic and psychical experiments from 1909 to 1931, that is, during the same time period that he was publishing the 54 journal installments that would become The Life Divine (1914-1919) Indeed, he tells his journal the precise date on which he commenced The Life Divine—July 18, 1912 taken together, then, the Record and The Life Divine give us an extraordinary window into a particularly creative period of Aurobindo’s spiritual and literary life Reading the journals, one cannot but be struck by their incredibly elaborate linguistic and conceptual architectonics, that is, the numer-ous sanskrit words the writer coined or adopted from the classical lit-erature to describe hundreds, if not thousands, of altered states of consciousness, subtle nuances of emotion (from joy to depression), delight (ānanda), and desire (kāma), various metaphysical levels of existence, and so on Most of all, though, there are supernormal pow-ers here involving active mind-reading (prākāmya) and telepathic reception (vyāpti), a kind of hyperdimensional vision of past, present, and future, what he called the ‘vision of the three times’ (trikāladṛṣṭi), synchronistic desire and magical prayer (īśitā, vaśitā), even a super-normal form of laughter (hāsyasiddhi) Siddhis are everywhere There is no question that the Record of Yoga is linked to The Life Divine, and that his yogic discipline was intimately connected to his contemplative writing practice Indeed, one of the most common sid-dhis described in the Record is the apparition of lipis, that is, written texts or words that would “appear” to him He often notes these down"},{"pageNumber":504,"pageContent":"yoga and tantra in the human potential movement 491They regularly appeared in both english and sanskrit He also describes supernormal experiences of translating sanskrit poetry, a kind of synchronistic reading practice, literary inspiration, and auto-matic writing (which, of course, was an extremely common feature of the American and British spiritualist circles of the nineteenth cen-tury) There are also some very familiar words here to take the three most obvious examples, supernormal and subliminal are extremely common words in The Life Divine, and the phenomenon of telepa-thy—refigured and ramified as vyāpti, prākāmya, and trikāladṛṣṭi in the Record—is probably the central concern of the yogi’s occult exper-iments, much as it had become for the theorizations of Myers in his Human Personality on a deeper philosophical level, Aurobindo also came to embrace evolution as his central organizing spiritual concept, much along the lines that Myers had earlier developed it in Human Personality It is, of course, always difficult to track influences, much less causal connections, and these two thinkers certainly cannot be conflated, but a close reading of Aurobindo renders it well-nigh impossible not to posit some sort of textual influence from Myers to Aurobindo Consider, for example, the following passages that appear in The Life Divine I have italicized what I consider to be textual echoes of Myers: Survival of the body by the human personality may hereafter be proved even to the satisfaction of the sceptic; but even then what will be estab-lished will only be a greater continuity and not the eternity of the conscious being 20For immortality in its fundamental sense does not mean merely some kind of personal survival of the bodily death; we are immortal by the eternity of our self-existence without beginning or end ... the spirit’s timeless existence is the true immortality 21What if it were found that the human personality survives the death of the body and moves between other planes and this material universe?22A survival of the material body by the personality implies a supraphys-ical existence ... 23 20 sri

titular echoes in which Aurobindo reveals that he is at least aware of Myers’s masterwork, Human Personality and Its Survival of Bodily Death It is, of course, possible to read such passages with the suspicion that all Aurobindo has in fact read of Myers is his title I suspect strongly, however, that Aurobindo was in fact quite familiar with this work, and that it was Myers’s super-normal language and enthusiastic turn to evolution as spiritual pro-cess that provided Aurobindo with one of the earliest and most influential systems upon which he could build his own yogic practice, metaphysical system, and intercultural coinages I am not suggesting any kind of simplistic reduction of Aurobindo’s system to that of Myers, as if the philosopher-seer relied on the psy-chical researcher for his

original and unique ways 2 Palladino’s Prāṇa: Hereward Carrington and Sir John Woodroffeone of the most productive and prolific psychical researchers of the twentieth century was the British writer Hereward Carrington During his long career, Carrington was involved in some of the most impor-tant studies of mediums and psychics, including the major s P R study of the Italian peasant and physical medium eusapia Palladino Carrington wrote dozens of books, including Eusapia Palladino and Her Phenomena (1909), the early classic on “astral travel” with sylvan J Muldoon, The Projection of the Astral Body (1929), and a collection called Essays in the Occult (1946), which includes a long chapter on “Yoga and Magic” (as a trained stage magician, or “prestidigitateur” as they used to so horribly put it, he also wrote an entire book on Hindu Magic) More relevant for our own purposes, however, is a two-volume treatise Carrington put together on how to cultivate one’s own psy-chic powers: Your Psychic Powers and How to Develop Them (1920) and Higher Psychical Development (Yoga Philosophy) The second of these volumes, what Carrington calls his “post-graduate course,” is presented as a series of “secrets,” a series of secrets, moreover, that “have never before been published” in any english work Carrington claims he obtained these “‘secrets’ of the Hindu yogis” through two"},{"pageNumber":506,"pageContent":"yoga and tantra in the human potential movement 493methods: an extensive, exhaustive textual study and “several years’ actual experience and

Arthur Avalon’s The Serpent Power appeared, in 1919, to be exact Carrington immediately integrated this text into his The result is a kind of oral-textual fusion, a conversation between the British psychical researcher lecturing in new York and the British Judge turned tāntrika living in Calcutta “Arthur Avalon,” of course, was the pen-name of sir John Woodroffe (1865-1936), the Calcutta High Court Judge who revolutionized Western understandings of Hindu Śākta tantra in the second and third decades of the twentieth-century through a series of remarkable lectures, books, and transla-tions (which were really done by the Bengali tantric paṇḍit Atul Behari Ghosh, hence the pen-name encoded both a “fused friendship” and a kind of “double personality”) 25 In short, Carrington is writing from his own yoga and reading practices, which are in turn put into conversation with his extensive psychical research resume and the very beginnings of the serious Western study of tantra This cross-cultural conversation in turn produces all sorts of Indic-Western fusions, with sanskrit phrases like āsanas, mantrayoga, and kuṇḍalinī linked to modern metaphysical and theosophical notions like cosmic consciousness and astral projection, which are in turn related to scien-tific and anatomical categories like the pineal gland, hyperdimen-sional geometry, and atoms Higher Psychical Development (Yoga Philosophy) is well worth dwelling on for a moment The text as a whole is a highly eccentric one, filled with numerous discussions that would make any contem-porary scholar wince My own line was crossed somewhere around the claims that “a vegetarian diet tends to make the molecules of proto-plasm in the body smaller and more sensitive to shorter wave-lengths,” that Christ traveled to tibet, or that there are such things as “psychical perfumes ”26 There are also, however, some truly fascinat-ing moments in the book that exhibit real insight and, if nothing else,

I do not have the space to give each of these moments justice, much less to contextual-ize this single book within the immense corpus that was Carrington’s life work I can only resort here to a series of teasing synopses and summaries These include: •\tCarrington’s unambiguous glossing of ‘Siddhis’ as ‘psychic powers’ (168);•\this metaphysical model of the mind as divided into three ‘layers’: (1) consciousness or normal awareness; (2) subconsciousness, more or less equivalent to Freud’s notion of the unconscious, “which is very much talked about nowadays”; (3) and supercon-sciousness, the layer in which “all these psychic phenomena occur” (92-93); later, Carrington will collapse the Freudian subconscious/unconscious and his own superconsciousness when he explains that it is the subconscious will, not the conscious one, that nor-mally performs psychic feats, and that this subconscious will can only be reached and trained, or made ‘solid’ as eusapia Palladino used to say, by occult methods (271);•\tCarrington’s comparative model of traditions of psychic develop-ment as breaking down into three major schools—Yoga, the occult, and the Mediumistic or Psychic—with Yoga and occultism being the preferred schools, since they encourage the conscious control and cultivation of the psychical powers, whereas mediums and psychics generally do not have a clue how their powers work or from whence they arise (181, 211-212); •\this innocent descriptions of experimenting with various drugs and their profound effects on consciousness, including “hasheesh and mascal and two or three other things” (118); in another place, he speaks of “our old friend Hashish” (78), and in another he even claims to be in possession of a recipe for the Witches’ unguent, “which, when soaked into the pores of the skin, included insensi-bility and hallucinations—these being coloured by the times in which they lived and the beliefs current at that particular period” (222-223);•\tCarrington’s understanding of the effects of drugs like morphine and cocaine (“the two or three other things”?) as catalysts rather than producers of the states that result from their ingestion via a model of what he calls “these extraordinary latent capacities,” in effect, what will later be called human potentials: “But the happi-"},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":"yoga and tantra in the human potential movement 495ness you experience,” Carrington wrote, “is not in the cocaine,—it does not exist in that little white powder, —it is in the human being, and the drug simply brings it up to the surface ”27 He then goes on to gloss this claim with a line from Avalon: “The body is a vast magazine of power (shakti) The object of the tantrick rituals is to raise these various forms of power to their full expression” (131-132);•\this tantric understanding of samādhi as “representing a perpetual state of ‘bliss’ corresponding” “on our earth plane, by the sexual crises,” and his further insistence that, “there is, of course, much erotic symbolism in all the Hindu teachings,—just as we find close connections between sex and religion here in the West” (125);•\tCarrington’s further explicit linkage of occult energies to “the sex-energies of the body” via the extremely common pattern of polter-geist cases occurring in emotionally and sexually troubled pubescent girls or boys: “The spontaneous outburst of these phe-nomena is, I am sure, associated with the awakening of the sex-energies at that time,—which find this curious method of ‘externalization’” (145) “There is,” he concludes, “a great deal of occult knowledge extant concerning the relations of psychic force and the sexual energies; but the pupil must be far advanced to obtain this” (146), after which he falls silent on the subject;•\this affirmation of Avalon’s insight that the orientalist and the mis-sionary have regarded the Indian teachings as “ignorant and absurd” because they “know nothing of occultism” (151)—in short, an implicit, if undeveloped, claim that Western occultism and the psychical research tradition would have been much better and much more fruitful comparative bases from which to develop the comparative study of religion than Western ethnocentrism and Protestant theology;•\tCarrington’s description of a friend (of course) who attended a black mass in Paris (224);•\this reading of censoring astral beings or “Guardians of the Thresh-old” as “thought-forms” or—my favorite expression now—“mental Frankensteins” that are created by the mind until they take on a reality of their own outside the subjective psyche (206); 27 Aldous Huxley would advance an almost identical “permissive” or “brain fil-ter” model for the metaphysical revelations of mescaline in his classic The Doors of Perception (1954), which in turn had a massive influence on the mystical appropria-tion of psychedelia in the counterculture "},{"pageNumber":509,"pageContent":"jeffrey j kripal496•\tCarrington’s quoting of swami vivekānanda’s, basically tantric, understanding that whenever there is any manifestation of super-natural power or wisdom, at least “a little current of kundalini” must have found its way into the central spinal channel or suṣumṇā (244); and finally,•\this description and promotion of “dreaming true,” that is, a kind of dream-yoga or, in his own terms, a “dream body” in which one can learn to fall asleep conscious and “step into that picture,” that is, step into the dream and control it from within (288-289) obviously, this is a breathless book Is there any way to summarize all of this for our own purposes here? I would isolate three meta-themes: (1) Carrington’s insistence that the erotically charged metaphysical energies of the human body are the final and deepest ‘secret’ of occult-ism, yoga, and all psychical phenomena; (2) the philosophical impli-cations of his constant glossing of ‘Samādhi’ as ‘Cosmic Consciousness’; and (3) his comparative flourishes linking Western psychics and Indian yogic notions like prāṇa, kuṇḍalinī, and śakti A word on each meta-pattern is in order here before we move on 1 The real ‘secret’ of all psychic powers for Carrington is the release and development of “a hidden, latent and sacred energy, known as Kundalini ” It is this mystical energy, “when aroused,” that activates the various energy centers of the body and so stimulates the psychic powers of the Yogi 28 In other places, Carrington will suggest that this same latent energy can be “exteriorized” toward various magical effects in the external world For Carrington, in other words, yoga powers are not simply about consciousness They are also about energy, a subtle or occult but also very real energy that we will some-day better understand and bring under conscious control 2 Carrington consistently glosses the yogic category of ‘samādhi’ as ‘Cosmic Consciousness’ This is no neutral move, no simple transla-tion, for Carrington is very clearly deriving the expression from Richard Maurice Bucke, the Canadian psychologist and doctor whose classic Cosmic Consciousness appeared, posthumously, in 1901 From our own present perspectives, Bucke’s book, much like Carrington’s, is a combination of profundity and naivete, but the key point to flag here is that, for Bucke, the phrase Cosmic Consciousness signals both an energetic infusion or spiritual influx (modeled on his own experi-28 Carrington, Higher Psychical Development, 23"},{"pageNumber":510,"pageContent":"yoga and tantra in the human potential movement 497ence of just such a metaphysical energy that overwhelmed him one night in London) and an evolutionary thrust or telos As Bucke wrote and Carrington quotes, “the cosmically conscious race will not be the race that exists today any more than the present is the same race that existed prior to the evolution of self-consciousness ”29 In short, Cosmic Consciousness signals an evolutionary mysticism again 3 Perhaps, though, the most interesting aspect of Carrington’s book is the occasionally artful, and oddly persuasive, way he compares Western mediums and specific tantric doctrines Three places in the text come to mind The first involves a two-page description of how eusapia Palladino could ‘charge-up’ a table and literally will the thing off the floor, as if she were zapping it with the vital energy the yogis call prāṇa speaking from personal experience, Carrington explains that, “You could then put your hands on the back of the table, and it felt like a live thing,—like the back of a dog!”30 The second involves a discussion of how both Western physical mediums and meditating tantric yogis report a certain ‘coldness’ in their bodies when the ener-gies erupt and the paranormal phenomena ensue 31 The third case involves a report in the Proceedings of the s P R entitled “A Case of Incipient obsession ” Carrington rightly notes that the symptoms reported by the subject reproduce, almost exactly, the oft-reported phenomenology of a kuṇḍalinī awakening The subject, for example, reported a mysterious ‘fluid’ leaving its proper place in the lower body and traveling to the head, where it made him ‘crazy’ He even reported how the only way to keep it controlled or held in was through breath-ing 32 Intellectual correctness and the usual contextualisms aside, it is very difficult to be anything other than a comparativist at such moments Carrington’s own final conclusion? That we should study and prac-tice Yoga in order to develop and master our own psychic powers He does not just tell us this, though He shows us how to practice what he considers to be the most interesting and universal of all psychical powers, the projection of the astral body such a practice can be mas-29 I bid , 115-116; cf 23, 103, 120 30 I bid , 58-59 Carrington may have been inspired to make this comparative move by swami vivekānanda, whom he approvingly quotes interpreting American Mind-healers, spiritualists, and Christian scientists as deriving their powers from what is

‘dynamization’ or empower-ment of the will (akin to what later metaphysical authors will call ‘affirmations’), the ‘division of self’ (a kind of spiritual dissociation affected by the imagination), and the exteriorization of the secret energies that he has just spent an entire book tracing through yoga, occultism, and the psychical research tradition Frederic Myers, Carrington tells us, invented a word for this exteriorization of energy: telergy (which resonates with both telepathy and theurgy) What it all means for Carrington is that nervous energy can exist apart from the body, whether it works over a few inches, as in psychokinesis, or over extremely long distances, as in astral projection 33In other words, Hereward Carrington’s Higher Psychical Develop-ment (Yoga Philosophy) ends with a lesson on how to fly 3 The Biology of Reincarnation: Ian StevensonAs is well known, the ability to remember one’s previous lives is com-monly framed as a siddhi of an advanced guru or enlightened teacher in traditional Hindu and Buddhist literature What is not so well known is the fact that such a siddhi received both striking empirical confirmation and a radical re-reading in the second half of the twenti-eth century through the life-work of a university of virginia psychia-trist by the name of Ian stevenson (1918-2007) For over forty years, stevenson churned out hundreds, then thousands, of elaborate case studies of past-life memories, particularly in Hindu and Buddhist south and east Asia (India, sri Lanka, Thailand, and Burma), shiite Lebanon and turkey, West Africa, northwest America, and, most recently, europe These resulted in a series of four massive volumes entitled Cases of the Reincarnation Type, with a fifth and final install-ment entitled European Cases of the Reincarnation Type As of 1997, stevenson had collected 2,600 reported cases of past-life memories and had published 65 detailed reports on individual cases, including what is widely considered to be the crown jewel of his cor-pus, Reincarnation and Biology The latter work is a massive 2,300-page, two-volume study of 225 cases of what he calls ‘the biology of reincarnation’, that is, the phenomenon of birth-marks or birth-defects as physical ‘marks’ corresponding to a previous life’s violent ending by knife, rope, bullet wound, or, in one particularly gruesome case, dismemberment 33 I bid , 265-268"},{"pageNumber":512,"pageContent":"yoga and tantra in the human potential movement 499Through his entire database (still being coded, organized, and ana-lyzed by his colleagues), stevenson isolated what he calls “four univer-sal features” found in every cultural complex that he studied, including europe These are: “an early age (usually between 2 and 4 years) of a subject’s first speaking about a previous life; a slightly older age (usu-ally between 5 and 7 years) when the subject stopped speaking sponta-neously about a previous life; a high incidence of violent death in the previous life; and frequent mention of the mode of death in the child’s statements ”34 A fifth feature has been more recently identified by stevenson’s uvA colleagues, namely, the over-representation of pre-vious male lives in the data set, a feature the researchers believe cor-relates closely with the violent death pattern, since males in almost any culture are more likely to die sudden, violent deaths than females Although it is impossible to convey the detail and power of even a single case here, it is worth admitting that I find many of these con-vincing And I am not alone even a professional debunker like the inimitable Carl sagan, who, by the way, also thought that telepathy and mind-to-matter interactions were worth looking at scientifically, was persuaded that this material is worth examining further 35 Anthropologist and cultural psychologist Richard shweder has also made a point to flag stevenson’s work as unusually suggestive “What are we to make,“ he asks with reference to this corpus, “of those cases in which a child claims to have memory of a former life in another family at another time and many of the details in the child’s account of that family turn out to be accurate?” The facts, as he rightly notes, seem “resistant to either genetic or environmental explanations ”36 That is putting it mildly But it is also putting it correctly Again and again (and again), stevenson minutely documents “cases of the rein-carnation type” in which people, generally young children, appear to remember extremely accurate, detailed, and otherwise unavailable information about a former life that is then confirmed empirically and objectively Siddhis indeed There are two features of stevenson’s corpus that deserve comment in this context The first is the fact that one of the major organizing 34 I an stevenson, European Cases of the Reincarnation Type (Jefferson, north Carolina: McFarland & Company, 2003), 250 35 Carl sagan, A Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark (new York: Ballantine, 1996), 302 36 Richard shweder, Thinking Through Cultures: Expeditions in Cultural Psycho-logy (Cambridge: Harvard university Press, 1991), 61"},{"pageNumber":513,"pageContent":"jeffrey j kripal500themes of his interpretive scheme is the apparent ability of the mind to influence the body stevenson’s discussion of mind-to-matter influ-ence in Reincarnation and Biology ranges from the placebo effect, psy-chosomatic illnesses, and the conversion disorders of psychiatry (whereby a physical symptom is also a symbolic sign written, as it were, by the unconscious mind), through the reported phenomenon of “maternal impressions” (whereby an emotional or mental state of a pregnant woman is imprinted on another related body still connected to hers, that is, the fetus), to the biology of reincarnation (whereby the wounds of a violent death are inscribed as birthmarks into the flesh of a completely different future body) This mind-over-matter thesis, of course, lies at the base of much magical practice and thought and is fundamental to many premodern cultures If we define magic as the mind’s ability to influence or shape material reality, then reading stevenson’s corpus is a very good way to become convinced that mag-ical powers are quite real Here that magical history is inscribed on the body, sometimes quite literally as an anomalous birthmark or a sym-bolic wound—the human body as the ultimate text, the corpus mysti-cum The second relevant feature involves the radical differences between stevenson’s tentative interpretations of the siddhi of remembering a previous life and that of the traditional Hindu and Buddhist teach-ings Here, after all, a previous life is only generally remembered if it ended suddenly or violently, without being properly processed, as it were such memories, in other words, are hardly signs of the spiritu-ally enlightened in stevenson’s corpus Quite the contrary, they are signs of the previously traumatized Moreover, and more radically still, if such memories persist past the age of four or five, they can result in serious psychological and sexual suffering, especially if the previous life was in a differently gendered body Clearly, these are sid-dhis that can come with a very heavy price They are best forgotten 4 Samādhi in Space: Edgar

his ‘grand epiphany’ and his ‘samādhi’ It was this same samādhi in space, moreover, that led Mitchell to found the Institute of noetic sciences the following year in order to pursue the rigorous study of psychical phenomena It was this institute, and its two major research scientists Dean Radin and Marilyn schlitz, that Dan Brown recently fictionalized in his mega-bestseller The Lost Symbol Mitchell was not trained in the specifics of Indian philosophy and the history of yoga He does, however, explicate in considerable philo-sophical detail what he means by this grand epiphany that was his samādhi And what he comes up with, if it were translated in Indic terms, is thoroughly and completely tantric in the simple ontological sense that he insists, over and over again, on the fundamental unity of mind and matter, spirit and body, or what he alliteratively calls in his subtitle to his autobiography “the material and mystical worlds ” He goes on to call this striking vision of immanent transcendence or transcendent immanence his “dyadic model,” which he directly and explicitly links—in what should be a very familiar pattern by now—to the still mysterious processes of evolution And why not? If matter can never be separated from mind, or mind from matter, then the material processes of cosmic and biological evolution must pos-sess mind-like or intentional dynamics, just as mental processes pos-sess matter-like dynamics Inspired by his samādhi in space and this dyadic model, Mitchell goes on to envision a most striking human future, one that strongly echoes the evolutionary mysticisms of Michael Murphy, Frederic Myers, sri Aurobindo, Richard Bucke, and Hereward Carrington Indeed, we are approaching a veritable X-Men scenario here: A dyadic model predicts that evolution is ongoing but coming under conscious control to suggest that evolution is coming under conscious control also implies that it has been under subconscious or unconscious control ... The individual who exhibits startling conscious control with mind-over-matter processes represents only the tip of an iceberg in an aware and intentional sea The untapped potential that lies just under the surface is almost incomprehensible at our current stage of evolu-tion 3737 edgar Mitchell, with Dwight Williams, The Way of the Explorer: An Apollo Astronaut’s Journey Through the Material and Mystical Worlds (new York: G P Put-nam, 1996), 186-187 "},{"pageNumber":515,"pageContent":"jeffrey j kripal502This notion of “conscious control” of once unconscious or subcon-scious processes, I might add, is precisely what Hereward Carrington had in mind with his categories of occultism and yoga philosophy When Mitchell writes of the “individual who exhibits startling con-scious control with mind-over-matter processes,” he is not imagining He is remembering He is thinking of people like uri Geller, the Israeli super-psychic whom he brought to America so that he could be stud-ied by American scientists After a stint in the Israeli military during the six-Day War, Geller gained worldwide fame for doing things like bending silverware like butter, photographing uFos outside a Lufthansa plane window, and, in one truly bizarre scene right out of the sci-fi movie Jumper, spontaneously teleporting from a street in the east side of Manhattan through the porch screen window of his colleague Andrija Puharich’s house in ossining, almost an hour away 38 Another “individual who exhibits startling conscious control with mind-over-matter processes” whom Mitchell was likely thinking of was ted owens, the self-described “PK-Man” or Psychokinetic Man owens, who possessed a genius IQ, sincerely claimed to correctly pre-dict (or cause) the ending of major droughts, the assumed lightning strike of Apollo 12 on november 14, 1969, and—my personal favor-ite—the near total ruination of the entire 1968 season of the Phila-delphia eagles football team owens had written over a dozen sports writers about the latter intention The eagles suffered 30 injuries that season and lost 11 games in a row The next summer, on July 30, 1969, to be exact, he wrote President nixon in order to warn him of a Cuban kidnapping attempt, via the sea, at his Key Biscayne residence in Florida on August 24, 1969, the Miami Herald published a story with the headline, “spy Plot shatters Prospects for Renewing u s Cuba ties ” It read eerily close to owens’s letter More bizarrely still, one could conclude that owens ‘guided’ Hurricane Inez with a map that he had drawn in october of 1966 (according to his biographer, Jeffrey Mishlove, the hurricane did things that no one expected) and cor-38 Geller appears to be an artful combination of stage magician and the real deal For a balanced and elegant study of the superpsychic demonstrating both sides of the equation, see Jonathan Margolis, Uri Geller: Magician or Mystic?

(edgar Mitchell, by the way, is also on record stating his own clear conviction in the existence of both uFos and aliens) Finally, when the Apollo astronaut brought the Israeli superpsychic to America to be studied by the scientists, he brought him to sRI, the same secret think-tank and the same scientists in Palo Alto who were responsible for initiating the American “remote view-ing” or psychic espionage programs of the cold war recently featured in the Hollywood film Men Who Stare at Goats But that is another story 40 Concluding thoughts: the tantric transmission and the evolving SiddhisAs even this hopelessly brief history has shown, the motif of the super-normal power or yogic siddhi is absolutely central to the history of psychical research, the human potential movement, and, indeed, a whole spectrum of metaphysical and mystical movements Yoga pow-ers, it might be concluded, have not been left behind in the modern world But they have mutated They have evolved There are two features of this modern mutation that I would like to flag here before I close one involves the traditional shape or contours of the highly specific Asian religious ideas, symbols, and practices that 39 I am relying here on two sources, one secondary and one primary: Jeffrey Mishlove, The PK Man: A True Story of Mind Over Matter (Charlottesville: Hampton Roads, 2000); and ted owens, How to Contact Space People (Global Communica-tions, 2008) The first edition of the latter book was published by saucerian Press in 1969 40 For more on this, see Jeffrey J Kripal, “Les vies secrètes des super-pouvoirs: la littérature de la vision à distance, et l’imaginal,” in Antoine Faivre and silvia Man-cini, eds , Techniques du corps et de l’esprit dans les deux Ameriqués: Continuités et

radically new scientific or parascientific episteme in which the supernormal powers are now embedded, experienced, and expressed First, the traditional shape If one takes a broad historical view of the Hindu and Buddhist traditions, one can identify at least two types of liberatory models: one orthodox, one heterodox The orthodox models generally see the cycles of saṃsāra as long and tedious, if not virtually endless, and the processes of liberation as gradual and extremely slow on the other hand (the left hand in this case), the het-erodox models, which we have named ‘tantric’ in our modern schol-arship, generally take a different approach: they claim that liberation, salvation, or even divinization can be realized in a single life, and that there are particular esoteric methods, often involving forbidden acts and the ingestion of dangerous substances, that are ‘sudden’ and ‘quick’ one might also observe a further general pattern here whereby siddhis are criticized or downplayed in the orthodox traditions as dis-tractions from the proper path, whereas they are celebrated, culti-vated, and emphasized in the heterodox tantric traditions as intimate and integral features of that same path What interests me about this meta-pattern is the way it resonates with the modern evolutionary mysticisms that I have made the focus of the present essay Consider that the traditional or standard biologi-cal model of evolution involves endless adaptations and extinctions with no seeming grand purpose and, with respect to human evolution, an excruciating slow ‘progress’ toward more and more complex forms of consciousness not so with the various evolutionary mysticisms More or less like the tantric traditions of Asia, they envision an inten-tional embrace of or entrainment with the cosmic élan toward a much quicker transformation and a radically new human future They also claim to experience this evolutionary energy in this life, both spon-taneously and through various intentional meditative practices More-over, whereas the standard evolutionary view recognizes no super- normal abilities, the evolutionary mysticisms not only recognize these, but see them as clear and exciting signs of a likely human future seen in this, admittedly very abstract, structural light, the “evolving sid-dhis” of the modern metaphysical milieu clearly line up with a tantric sensibility, not an orthodox Hinduism or Buddhism In short, the sid-dhis are an intimate and inseparable part of what I have called the tantric transmission This is why in an Introduction to Gopi Krishna’s"},{"pageNumber":518,"pageContent":"yoga and tantra in the human potential movement 505Kundalini: The Evolutionary Energy in Man, Frederic spiegelberg associates Krishna’s book with those of sri Aurobindo and identifies the ultimate source of both systems of practice and philosophy with ‘the world of tantra’ 41 That seems exactly right to me This is not to say, of course, that the modern siddhis or the modern evolutionary tantras are the same as the siddhis and tantric systems of south Asia, nepal, or China not at all They have certainly been informed and inspired by these Asian traditions, but everything also has been almost completely transformed Put most simply, the mod-ern scientific registers of evolutionary biology and physics have radi-cally and permanently changed the understandings of the yoga powers in the contemporary metaphysical scene Which brings me to my second point—the new episteme These modern registers, it must be added, have almost completely trans-formed the phenomenology of the siddhis such events are now not only interpreted in scientific or parascientific terms They are actually experienced and expressed in these terms Hence Gopi Krishna does not simply experience the raising of the kuṇḍalinī through the cakras and insist, exactly like swami vivekānanda, that any measure of genius or wisdom is the result of a rising kuṇḍalinī 42 He also experi-ences this mystical uprush as ‘the evolutionary energy in man’ and insists, very much unlike the swami, that individuals who have been so awakened, so empowered, should by all means engage in procre-ative sexual intercourse, so that they can pass their mutant talents on to the next generation (sex, of course, being the primary tantric method or mārga of biological evolution) so too, Fritjof Capra does not have a traditional taoist experience of the oneness of the natural world and the human, nor does he visit some elderly sage on a moun-tain Rather, he experiences a cosmic vision on a California beach in which he actually ‘sees’ the quantum world froth and foam below our sensory surface world similarly, edgar Mitchell does not see ‘God’, much less some ‘heaven’, while floating weightlessly in outer space He experiences a ‘samādhi’ in which he knows that the universe is conscious and consciously evolving, and that mind and matter are two sides of the same cosmic coin Finally, when Alex Grey’s modern meditator with glowing cakras appears on the Russian cover of 41 I ntroduction to Gopi Krishna, Kundalini: The Evolutionary Energy in Man (Berkeley: shambala,

actually appears through the paper cover via a bodily cut-out When one removes the paper cover and looks at the boards of the book covers below, what one sees is the same glowing meditator now sitting in a multi-dimensional field, that is, in a representation of einsteinian space-time Given the almost total epistemological dominance of science in our modern world, are such experiences and expressions really that diffi-cult to understand and appreciate? How else are thoughtful, scientifi-cally minded individuals supposed to enter, experience, and then express a mystical experience? Moreover, and more radically, if quan-tum physics and evolutionary biology are what they say they are, that is, if they really do provide us with extremely accurate and precise models of reality (and I personally have no doubts about this), and if mystical experiences and paranormal events are extremely common features of this same, single, all-encompassing reality (and I person-ally have no doubts about this), then is it not perfectly logical, does it not necessarily follow that the latter mystical and paranormal events would mirror and match the former scientific models, and vice versa? How on earth, or in space, could they not correspond?The easiest negative answer to such a question is very simple and very short: we can simply deny that magical powers, siddhis, and para-normal events exist at all This, of course, is the traditional skeptical or allegedly ‘rational’ or ‘empirical’ approach It is not very convincing It is also neither empirical nor rational, as anyone who has taken the trouble to read into the immense modern literatures on psychical and paranormal phenomena—and I mean really read these multiple liter-atures—knows 43 We need to be reminded here, again and again (and again), that materialism and rationalism are not the same thing, and that if we are going to be empirical, we need to be empirical about everything, including and especially the astonishing and often very strange spectrum of human experience once we finally adopt such a truly radical and truly consistent empiricism, that is, once we admit that paranormal events are indeed a fairly regular feature of this world, it is easy to see that one can be perfectly rational and finally reject materialism (and, I would add, the attending pure contextualisms, constructivisms, and cultural relativisms that follow from such a 43 For a start, see “Required Reading (That Is never Read): A select Annotated Bibliography,” in Jeffrey J Kripal, Authors of the Impossible: The Paranormal and the Sacred (Chicago: university of Chicago Press, 2010) "},{"pageNumber":520,"pageContent":"yoga and tantra in the human potential movement 507metaphysical commitment) as an ontology and a set of methodologies that are simply inadequate to the full sweep of the comparative data at hand Certainly the phenomenology of siddhis and the modern history of superpowers suggest as much ReferencesAlbanese, Catherine A Republic of Mind and Spirit: A Cultural History of American Metaphysical Religion new Haven: Yale university Press, 2007 Aurobindo, sri The Life Divine twin Lakes, WI: Lotus Press, 2000 Carrington, Hereward Higher Psychical Development (Yoga Philosophy) new York: samuel Weiser, 1978 Grey, Alex The Mission of Art Boston: shambhalah, 1998 Gutierrez, Cathy Plato’s Ghost: Spiritualism in the American Renaissance new York: oxford university Press, 2009 Haraldsson, erlendur ‘Miracles Are My Visiting Cards’: An Investigative Report on the Psychic Phenomena Associated with Sathya Sai Baba London: Century, 1987 Kripal, Jeffrey J Esalen: America and the Religion of No Religion Chicago: university of Chicago Press, 2007 ——— Authors of the Impossible: The Paranormal and the Sacred Chicago: university of Chicago Press, 2010 ——— Mutants and Mystics: Science Fiction, Superhero Comics, and the Paranormal Chicago: university of Chicago Press, 2011 ——— “Les vies secrètes des super-pouvoirs: la littérature de la vision à distance, et l’imaginal ” In Antoine Faivre and silvia Mancini, eds , Techniques du corps et de l’esprit dans les deux Ameriqués: Continuités et discontinuités culturelles (Paris: Éditions Imago, forthcoming) Krishna, Gopi, The Biological Basis of Religion and Genius new York: nC Press, 1971 ——— Kundalini: The Evolutionary Energy in Man Berkeley: shambala, 1971 Margolis, Jonathan Uri Geller: Magician or Mystic? new York: Welcome Rain Publishers, 1999 Mishlove, Jeffrey The PK Man: A True Story of Mind Over Matter Charlottesville: Hampton Roads, 2000 Mitchell, edgar with Dwight Williams The Way of the Explorer: An Apollo Astronaut’s Journey Through the Material and Mystical Worlds new York: G P Putnam, 1996 Murphy, Michael and Rhea A White, In the Zone: Transcendent Experience in Sports new York: Penguin, 1995 Myers, Frederic W H Human Personality and Its Survival of Bodily Death, 2 vols London: Longmans, Green, and Co , 1904/1903 owens, ted How to Contact Space People Global Communications, 2008 sagan, Carl A Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark new York: Ballantine, 1996 shanon, Benny The Antipodes of the Mind; Charting the Phenomenology of the Ayahuasca Experience new York: oxford university Press, 2002 shweder, Richard Thinking Through Cultures: Expeditions in Cultural Psychology Cambridge: Harvard university Press, 1991 stevenson, Ian European Cases of the Reincarnation Type Jefferson, north Carolina: McFarland & Company, 2003"},{"pageNumber":521,"pageContent":"jeffrey j kripal508swann, Ingo Psychic Sexuality: The Bio-Psychic “Anatomy” of Sexual Energies Indo swann Books, 1999 targ, Russell Do You See What I See?
