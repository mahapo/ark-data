An undisciplined mind makes a man slave and wrecks his life.Controlling and subduing it is the most vexing of problems to the earnest seeker of happiness. Thevital importance of the subject, therefore, prompted H.H. Sri Swami Sivanandaji Maharaj to writethis comprehensive work ìMINDóITSMYSTERIESAND CONTROL.î It is meant to serve as avaluable guide to all aspirants and it is also of immense help to anyone in any walk of life. Being theoutcome of personal experience of the revered author and written with a practical end in view,ìMINDóITSMYSTERIESAND CONTROLî is a treasure worthy to be possessed and studiedconstantly.óTHE DIVINE LIFE SOCIETYiv"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"PREFACEHappiness has for ever been the prime aim of every human being. All activities of man aredirected towards acquiring the maximum happiness in life. But, through the wrong deluded notionthat objects will give happiness, man searches for it outside. The result is that in spite of all hislifelong efforts, he gets disappointment only. Vexation and misery alone are to be seen everywhere.The real lasting happiness lies within man. Such happiness or Ananda is the Inner Self, theAntaratman. The very nature of Atman is pure Joy. This is never perceived because the mind iscompletely externalised. As long as the mind is restlessly wandering about amidst objects, everfluctuating, excited, agitated and uncontrolled, this true joy cannot be realised and enjoyed. Tocontrol the restless mind and perfectly still all thoughts and cravings is the greatest problem of man.If he has subjugated the mind, he is the Emperor of emperors.For gaining mastery over the mind, you have to know what it is, how it works, how itdeceives you at every turn and by what methods it can be subdued. In this book, the subject has beendealt with; and the nature of the mind, the various forms that it assumes, the secret of its innerworkings and the way to control it are fully and clearly explained. The previous editions wereeagerly read and appreciated by thousands of aspirants who wrote to say how immensely they werehelped by the instructions. The lessons and instructions are eminently practical and many helpfulideas and suggestions got during my meditations have been recorded and put down here. Veryuseful hints on concentration and meditation will be found in the book which, if faithfully followed,will bring success in a short time without fail.I pray to every aspirant to study constantly the valuable instructions with care and follow thepractical hints given in his Sadhana and daily life. It will doubtless enable you to gain control overyour passions and cravings and to get established in Yoga. The Bhakta, the student of Vedanta, theRaja Yogin, the Karma Yoginóall will find this book an indispensable guide. The later stages ofYoga Sadhana are common in all the four paths and Dharana and Dhyana are quite impossiblewithout first subduing the mind. All Sadhanas are, therefore, aimed at obtaining mastery over themind. Hence it is that I have tried to present the ways and means of achieving this through simple,yet well-tried and effective methods. My efforts would be amply fulfilled if even a single earnestaspirant is helped on the spiritual path and attains the Goal.May the Lord, the Antaryamin, the Supreme Indweller inspire all to attempt mind-controland Yoga! May He bestow success on the sincere aspirants that struggle to master the unruly mind!May you reach the Goal of Life, Immortality, Supreme Knowledge and Bliss!Sivanandav"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"CONTENTSPrayer...............................................ivPublishersí Note..........................................ivPreface...............................................v1.

Mind isverily the receptacle (of all our knowledge).î(Chhandogya Upanishad, V-i-5)That which separates you from God is mind. The wall that stands between you and God ismind. Pull the wall down through Om-Chintana or devotion and you will come face to face withGod.THE MINDóA MYSTERYThe vast majority of men know not the existence of the mind and its operations. Even theso-called educated persons know very little of the mind subjectively or of its nature and operations.They have only heard of a mind.Western psychologists know something.Western doctors know only a fragment of mind. The afferent nerves bring the sensationsfrom the periphery or extremities of the spinal cord. The sensations then pass to themedullaoblongataat the back of the head, where the fibres decussate. From there, they pass on to thesuperior frontal gyrus or superior frontal convolution of the brain in the forehead, the supposed seatof the intellect or mind. The mind feels the sensations and sends motor impulses through theafferent nerves to the extremitiesóhands, legs, etc. It is a brain-function only for them. Mind,according to them, is only an excretion of the brain, like bile from liver. The doctors are still gropingin utter darkness. Their minds need drastic flushing for the entry of Hindu philosophical ideas.It is only the Yogins and those who practise meditation and introspection that know theexistence of the mind, its nature, ways and subtle workings. They know also the various methods ofsubduing the mind.Mind is one of the Ashta-Prakritis. ìEarth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, reason andegoismóthese constitute the eightfold division of My Natureî (Gita, VII-4).Mind is nothing but Atma-Sakti. It is brain that wants rest (sleep), but not the mind. A Yogiwho has controlled the mind never sleeps. He gets pure rest from meditation itself.HOW THE MIND ORIGINATEDMind is Atma-Sakti. It is through mind that Brahman manifests Himself as thedifferentiated universe with heterogeneous objects. Brahma thought, ìThere, indeed, are theworlds; I shall create the protectors of the worlds.î He gathered the Purusha (Hiranyagarbha) fromout of the waters only and fashioned him. He heated him by the heat of meditation. When he wasthus heated, his heart burst out. From the heart, the mind came; from the mind the moon, the1MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"presiding deity of the mind. (Heart is the seat of the mind; so, the mind came out when the heartburst out. In Samadhi, the mind goes to its original seat, i.e., heart. In sleep also, it rests in the heartwith a veil of ignorance between it and Brahman) (Aitareya Upanishad, 1-3-4).COSMIC MIND AND INDIVIDUAL MINDHiranyagarbha, otherwise known as Karya Brahman and Sambhuti, is cosmic mind. He isthe sum total (Samashti) of all the minds. The individual mind is connected with the cosmic mind.Cosmic mind, Hiranyagarbha, superconscious mind, infinite mind, universal mind are synonymousterms. Different authors have used different terms. Do not be puzzled. Do not be confused. It isSabda-bheda only.Hiranyagarbha is cosmic Prana also. He is the Sutratman (thread-like Self). He representsthe electric, cosmic, power-house. The different Jivas represent the different, small bulbs.Electricity from the power-house flows through the insulated copper wires into the bulbs. Similarly,the power from Hiranyagarbha flows into the Jivas.The mind, being very subtle, is in close apposition or contact with other minds, though thehuman skull intervenes between them. As mind evolves, you come into conscious relation with themental currents, with the minds of othersó near and distant, living and dead. The individual mindof A, although separated from the mind-substance used by other individuals, B, C, D, E, X, Y, etc.,by a thin wall of very finest kind of matter, is really in touch with the other apparently separatedminds and with the universal mind of which it forms a part.If A is a friend of B, Aís mind is connected with Bís mind. The minds of friends, relatives,brothers of A are attached to Aís mind. Several minds are similarly linked to Bís mind also. Theminds of those who are attached to Aís mind are, therefore, connected, in turn, with the minds ofthose who are hanging on Bís mind. In this manner, one mind is in touch with all minds in the wholeworld. This is the Vibhu theory of mind of Raja Yoga.MIND IN SANKHYA PHILOSOPHYIn Sankhya philosophy, Mahat is the term used to denote ìcosmic mindî or ìuniversalmind.î It is the first principle that is derived from Avyakta. It is the first principle that is manifestedout of the unmanifested Avyakta. The wheel of the bullock-cart rests on the spokes. The spokes reston the nave. Even so, the mind rests on Prakriti and Prakriti rests on Brahman.From Mahat comes Ahankara. From Sattvic Ahankara comes mind; from Rajasic Ahankaracomes Prana; from Tamasic Ahankara, Tanmatras; from Tanmatras, gross elements; from grosselements, the gross universe. Mind is no other than Ahankara, the idea of ëIí. It is, indeed, difficultto eschew this idea of ëIí. Mind always attaches itself to something objective (Sthula). It cannotstand by itself. It is only this mind that asserts itself as ëIí in this body.The idea of ëIí is the seed of the tree of mind. The sprout which first springs up from thisseed of Ahankara is Buddhi. From this sprout, the ramifying branches called Sankalpas have theirorigin.2WHAT IS MIND?"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"LINGA SARIRA AND ANTAVAHA SARIRAMind is the most important Tattva of Linga Sarira. Linga Sarira is the astral body orSukshma Sarira that is linked to the physical body through physical Prana. It separates itself at deathfrom the physical body and travels to Svarga or heaven. It is this body that does Avagamana(coming and going). This body melts in Videha Mukti (disembodied salvation).There is a difference between Linga Sarira and Antarvaha Sarira. Linga Sarira is astral bodywith seventeen Tattvas, viz., five Karma-Indriyas, five Jnana-Indriyas, five Pranas, Mind andBuddhi. Antarvaha Sarira is very pure. It is full of Sattva. It is free from Rajas and Tamas. It is withthis body that a Yogi passes from one body to another (Parakaya-Pravesa). Lila, through the graceof Sarasvati, came out of the physical body and travelled to higher worlds with this AntarvahaSarira. You will find this in the Yogavasishtha. Sri Sankaracharya, Raja Vikramaditya,Hastamalaka and Tirumular had Antarvaha Sarira. With the help of this special kind of pure body,they passed into the bodies of other persons. A Yogi with Antarvaha Sarira has Sat-Sankalpa orSuddha Sankalpa.MIND IS SUBTLE MATTERMind is not a gross thing, visible and tangible. Its existence is nowhere seen. Its magnitudecannot be measured. It does not require a space in which to exist.Mind and matter are two aspects as subject and object of one and the same all-full Brahman,who is neither and yet includes both. Mind precedes matter. This is Vedantic theory. Matterprecedes mind. This is scientific theory.Mind can be said to be immaterial only in the sense that it has not the characteristics ofponderable matter. It is not, however, immaterial in the sense that Brahman (Pure Spirit) as such is.Mind is the subtle form of matter and hence the prompter of the body. Mind is made up of subtle,Sattvic, Apanchikrita (non-quintuplicated) Tanmatric matter. Mind is all electricity. According tothe Chhandogya Upanishad, mind is formed out of the subtlest portion of food.Mind is material. Mind is subtle matter. This discrimination is made on the principle that thesoul is the only source of intelligence; it is self-evident; it shines by its own light. But the organs(mind and senses) derive their principle of activity and life from the soul. By themselves, they arelifeless. Hence the soul is always a subject and never an object. Manas can be an object of the soul.And it is a cardinal principle of Vedanta that that which is an object for a subject is non-intelligent(Jada). Even the principle of self-consciousness (Aham Pratyak-Vishayatva) or Ahankara isnon-intelligent; it does not exist by its own light. It is the object of apperception to the soul.THE MENTAL BODYJust as the physical body is composed of solid, liquid and gaseous matter, so also the mind ismade up of subtle matter of various grades of density with different rates of vibration. A Raja Yogipenetrates through different layers of mind by intense Sadhana.3MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"The mental body varies much in different people. It is composed of coarse or finer matter,according to the needs of the more or less unfolded consciousness connected with it. In theeducated, it is active and well-defined; in the undeveloped, it is cloudy and ill-defined.There are several zones or slices in the mental body just as there are various compartmentsin the brain for particular types of thought. During intense anger, the whole mind is suffused withthe black hue of malice and ill-will, which expresses itself in coils of thunderous blackness, fromwhich fiery arrows of anger dart forth, seeking to injure the one for which the anger is felt.TYPES OF MINDEvery man has a mental world of his own. Every man entirely differs from another man inmode of thinking, temperament, taste, mentality, physical characteristics, etc. Physically also a mandiffers from another man, although there might be slight resemblance. Observe carefully the nose,the ears, the lips, the eyes, the eyebrows, the arrangement of teeth, the shoulders, hands, fingers,toes, look, voice, gait, way of talking, etc., of different men. You will find vast differences betweenany two persons. Even the lines of the palm will differ. No two leaves are alike. Variety is thebeauty of creation.There are various types of mind. The Bengali type of mind is emotional and fit for devotionand art. The Madrasi type of mind is intellectual and clever in Mathematics. The Punjabi type ofmind and Maharashtra type of mind are chivalrous. Bengal has produced emotional saints, LordGouranga or Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa Deva, etc. Madras hasproduced intellectual philosophers like Sri Sankara and Sri Ramanuja. Punjab has produced GuruNanak, Guru Govind Singh, etc. The Sadhana and path of Yoga vary according to the type of mind,temperament and capacity. Tastes also differ. The sight of a fish brings excessive joy to a Bengali.The sight of tamarind and chillies excites the glosso-pharyngeal nerve of a Madrasi. The sight of aPalmyra fruit excites the Jaffna Tamil of Ceylon and brings excessive joy. The sight of meat bringsa peculiar joy to a meat-eater. Is this not a mystery that an object lies outside and saliva appears inthe tongue at the sight of it? Because you have this experience daily in everyday life, you do notattach much importance to it. Mind is very mysterious. So is Maya, too.Even an infinitely superior mind is yet a mind and of the same mould as any manís.SIZE OF THE MENTAL BODYMind is atomic (Anu) according to the Nyaya School; is all-pervading (Vibhu) according tothe Raja Yoga School of Maharshi Patanjali; is of middling size (same size as that of the body)according to the Vedantic School.MENTAL AURAMind has got aura (mental aura or psychic aura). Aura is Tejas, brilliance or halo thatemanates from the mind. The aura of those who have developed their minds is extremely effulgent.It can travel long distances and affect in a beneficial manner a large number of persons who comeunder its influence. The spiritual aura is more powerful than either the psychic or Pranic aura.4WHAT IS MIND?"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"INFLUENCE OF STRONG MIND OVER WEAK MINDSA strong mind has influence over weak minds. A hypnotist with a strong mind hypnotises awhole bunch or circle of boys of weak minds.There are those among us who are much more sensitively organised than others. As anorganism, their bodies are more finely and more sensitively constructed. These, generally speaking,are people who are always more or less affected by the mentalities of others with whom they comein contact, in whose company they are.He who has purified his mind becomes a centre of force. All the lesser, impure, weak mindsare unconsciously drawn towards the purified, greater mind, because they derive peace, power andstrength from the greater, purified mind.Mark the influence of a highly developed mind over a less developed mind. It is impossibleto describe what it is like to be in the presence of a Master or developed adept. To sit in his presence,though he hardly speaks a word, is to feel a thrilling sensation so much as to feel new inspirationstouching one mentally. It will be an extraordinary experience.If you want to drink water at a tap, you will have to bend your body. Even so, a lower mindwill have to bend (to be humble) before a developed mind if it longs to imbibe its virtues. Thethought itself must be calm and unruffled. Then only you can draw inspirations. In such conditionsonly benign influences can be thrown down into the lower mind from the higher. In such calm,mental states, you can hold communion with God. Planning, angry and depressed moodsóalldisturb the mind and act as stumbling blocks to God-realisation.MIND IS EVER CHANGINGMind is nothing but a collection of Samskaras. It is nothing but a bundle of habits. It isnothing but a collection of desires arising from contact with different objects. It is also a collectionof feelings aroused by worldly botherations. It is a collection of ideas gathered from differentobjects. Now, these desires, ideas and feelings constantly change. Some of the old desires andfeelings are constantly departing from their storehouse, the mind, and new ones are replacing them.This constant change does not in any way interfere with the harmony of mental operations.Only some of the old desires, ideas and feelings depart. Those that remain work in healthyco-operation and concord with the new arrivals. The new arrivals are strongly magnetised by theold ones. They both work in harmony and this harmony sustains the identity of the mentalexistence.Mind is not only made daily, but always made. Every minute, it changes its colours andshape like a chameleon. It is very Chanchala (wavering) and Asthira (unsteady)ó(Gita, VI, 26).Mind is constantly changing. You are gaining new experiences daily. Your beliefs and conscienceof 1932 and the faculty which judges right from wrong will change in 1942. The mind evolvesthrough experience. The world is the best teacher or Guru.5MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"According to the state of his knowledge, manís conscience is built up and changes fromtime to time with the correction of his views, in the light of further knowledge gained subsequently.Conscience is oneís own convictions arrived at either instinctively or by reasoning. The conscienceof a child or a savage is entirely different from the conscience of a fully grown civilised man and,even amongst civilised men, knowledge varies so much that their consciences direct different linesof conduct. The conscience of a Sattvic man considerably differs from that of a Rajasic man. Theconscience of a Sattvic man is very, very clean and pure.FOURFOLD MIND OR ANTAHKARANA CHATUSHTAYAAntahkarana is a term used by the Vedantins to include mind, Buddhi, Chitta and Ahankara.When used in a broad sense, it means the internal instrument. ëAntahí means internal; ëKaranaímeans instrument. It is the inner instrument (as distinguished from the term Bahya Karana, outerinstrument or the senses or Indriyas) through which you sense, perceive, think and reason out.Ahankara is derived from Prithvi-Tanmatra. (Tanmatras are Sukshma Bhutas or subtleelements. The five gross elements are derived from the Tanmatras.) Chitta is derived fromJala-Tanmatra; Buddhi from Agni-Tanmatra; mind from Vayu-Tanmatra; heart fromAkasa-Tanmatra.Mind is Chetana (intelligent) when compared with the senses. It is Jada (non-intelligent)when compared with Buddhi. Sankhya Buddhi or Buddhi in Sankhya Philosophy is will andintellect combined. Some put Chitta under mind, Ahankara under Buddhi.Manas, Buddhi, Chitta and Ahankara are only Vritti-bhedas or functional aspects of themind. The Manas has all things for its objects and extends through the past, present and future; it isone only, but has various functions. You are a Judge when you exercise your judicial powers in thecourt. You are a cook when you work in the kitchen. You are a president of an association when yousit in the chair in that capacity. You are the same man, but you function differently and you arecalled by different names according to those different functions. Similarly, when the mind doesSankalpa-Vikalpa (will-thought and doubt), it is called Mind; when it discriminates and decides, itis Buddhi; when it self-arrogates, it is Ahankara; when it is the storehouse of Samskaras and seat ofmemory, it is Chitta; also when it does Dharana and Anusandhana.Who gave coolness to water, warmth to fire, motion to air? These qualities are their verynature. Even so, mind has got its Svabhava of running towards objects, Buddhi of determining,Ahankara of self-assertion and self-identification, Chitta of thinking (Smriti) of those objects whichare identified by Ahankara.When the mind is at work, Buddhi and Ahankara work simultaneously along with the mind.Mind, Buddhi and Ahankara work in healthy co-operation. Mind makes Sankalpa-Vikalpa. Itthinks whether a certain thing is good or bad. Buddhi comes for determination. It is Buddhi whichdiscriminates the Vishaya (Nischyatmika, Vyavasayatmika).6WHAT IS MIND?"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"The Svarupa of mind is thought only. Mind is Sankalpa-Vikalpatmaka. It isVyakaranatmaka when it forwards the decisions of Buddhi, the messages from Buddhi, to theorgans of action for execution. Mind selects, attends and rejects.FUNCTIONS OF MINDSensation, thought and volition are the threefold functions of the mind. Cognition, desire,volition are the three mental processes.Mind has three states, viz., active, passive and neutral. Mind always wants variety and newsensations. It is disgusted with monotony.Law of Association, Law of Continuity and Law of Relativity are the three principal laws ofthe mind.These are the characteristics of the mind, viz., change (Parinama), activity (Cheshta),suppression (Nirodha), ideation in action (Sakti), physical life (Jivana), characterisation (Dharma).Thinking, planning, feeling, knowing are the various activities that are going on in the mind.Sometimes you plan. Sometimes you feel. Sometimes you try to know. Sometimes you thinkseriously. Sometimes you will (volition). Volition brings all the mental faculties into play. Youmust be able to know by introspection what exactly is going on at different times in the mind.ASPECTS OF MINDConscious mind or objective mind, subconscious mind or subjective mind (Chitta) andsuperconscious mind are three aspects of the mind. You see, hear and read with the objective mind.Sensational mind, rational mind and intuitive mind are three aspects of mind according toanother classification of Western philosophers.Heart is the seat of four TattvasóPrana, Mind, Ahankara and Atman. According toVedanta, the seat of mind is the heart. Ajna Chakra, which consists of two lotuses and which istentatively situated in the space between the two eyebrows, is the seat of mind according to theHatha Yoga School.SEAT OF MINDMind has various faculties and centres and operates through corresponding physical centresin the brain. Mind, Buddhi and understanding are in the Linga Sarira; but they operate throughcorresponding centres in the physical brain. The brain is not mind as the Westerners think. Mind hasits seat in the physical brain. It gains experiences of this physical universe through the vibrations ofthe brain.A king, though he has complete sway over his whole territory, though the whole kingdombelongs to him, has got special places for his residence. He has got a splendid palace in the capital7MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"and another beautiful, palatial building in Mussoorie or Mount Abu for his stay in summer. Even so,the mind, though it is all-pervading throughout the body, has got three places to reside in during thethree statesóJagrat, Svapna and Sushupti. The seat of mind in deep sleep is heart. In dream, the seatof the mind is neck. In waking state, the seat of the mind is the right eye or Ajna Chakra. Just markwhat you do in Alochana (deep thinking). You hold your finger in the chin, turn the neck to the rightside, turn the gaze towards the space between the two eyebrows and then begin to think seriously onthe problem in hand. This goes to show that the seat of the mind is the Ajna Chakra.MIND IS NOT ATMANIn the West, the psychologists make a serious mistake in saying that consciousness is afunction and attribute of the mind. It is Chit or Atman only that is Pure Consciousness Itself. Mindborrows its light from time to time from its sourceóAtman, the Light of lights or the Sun of sunsand glitters temporarily like consciousness, like the golden gilt in brass. Mind borrows its light andpower from Brahman, the source (Yoni), just as the iron-rod borrows its heat and effulgence fromfire. Mind is Jada or non-intelligent, but appears to be intelligent by borrowing light from Brahman,just as water exposed to the sun borrows heat from the sun.Mind can do only one thing at a time. It is finite (Parichhinna). It is Jada. It is the effect(Karya) of Sattva Guna. It is Vinasi (perishable). It is Chanchala (ever-fluctuating). It is a bundle ofideas, Samskaras, habits, impulses and emotions. It borrows light from the Adhishthana (theunderlying substratum), Brahman. You can control the mind. The thinker is different from thought.There is no functioning of the mind in deep sleep. You always say, ìMy mindî, as if mind is one ofyour instruments just like your walking-stick or umbrella. Therefore, mind is not the self-shiningAtman.Even in cases of delirium or in cases where there is paralysis of the mental functions, wherea man loses his memory and other faculties partly or wholly, ëHeí remains. The ëIí exists(AhamAsmi).The mind seems to be as much your property and outside of you as the limbs, the dress wornor the building you dwell in. Therefore, mind is different from ëIí.Mind gropes in darkness. It forgets every moment. It is changing every second. If food iswithdrawn for a couple of days, it cannot think properly. There is no functioning of the mind duringdeep sleep. It is full of impurities, Vasanas and Trishnas (cravings). It gets puzzled during anger. Infear, it trembles. In shock, it sinks. How can you take the mind, then, as the pure Self?Manas is an organ of sensation and thought. This instrument must be under the control ofsomeone who uses it. The Jiva or human soul is not the director of the mind, because we see thatordinary men cannot control their minds. They are simply swayed hither and thither by pettyRaga-Dvesha, emotion and fear. Therefore, there must exist some other Being, who is Director ofthe mind. Who is that Being? He is the Manasah pati (Lord of mind), Antaryamin, KutasthaBrahman.Just as you see the tree in front of you, there must be somebody to see and know what isgoing on in the mind of Jivas. That somebody is Kutastha. Kutastha is Brahman Himself. There is atumbler in front of you. It cannot see itself. An instrument, eye and a seer are needed. If you say that8WHAT IS MIND?"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"the tumbler can see itself, then there will be Karmakartritva-bhava-virodha. It is a logical absurdity.Therefore, you have to admit that there is a silent Sakshi of the mind, who is eternal, unchanging,eternal knower, always the knowing subject. He is witnessing the motives and modifications thatarise in the minds of Jivas.Isvara or Saguna Brahman (Personal God) has full consciousness of Nirguna Brahman.That is His Svarupa- Lakshana. At the same time, he has full cosmic consciousness. He knows whatis going on in every mind.Consciousnessper seor the Absolute Consciousness is common in all. This pureconsciousness is one. It is Kutastha Chaitanya. All the workings of the mind, all modifications thatarise in the minds of all are presented to the one common consciousness which is the witness of themental Vrittis. Even though consciousness is one, when Rama is stung by a scorpion, only Ramafeels and not his friend Krishna who is standing near him. Antahkarana or mind is different in everyindividual. It is Antahkarana that limits a man who is, in reality, identical with the Brahman orSupreme Soul! This identity is realised when the Avarana or veil of ignorance is removed.The mind is an object of perception for Brahman. Atman directly cognises all thephenomena of the mind, viz., desire, imagination, doubt, belief, disbelief, shame, intelligence, fear,etc. He remains Himself quite unattached and unaffected like the omnipresent ether, like the crystalwhich reflects different coloured objects, like the sun.ATMANóTHE SOURCE FOR THE MINDManas, which expands through Sankalpas and Vikalpas, is generated with Brahman as itscause. The form which the endless Atman (Supreme Spirit) assumes through Sankalpa is Manas(mind). It first turned its back to discrimination and hence entangled itself in the folds of Vasanas ofobjects. The underlying substratum, Adhishthana of the mind, the source or basis for mind is Atmanor Brahman or Absolute Conscious- ness. The Power of powers who gives power to the mind, theLight of lights who sheds light on the mind, the Seer of seers who witnesses the motives of andmovements in the mind, the Support of supports on which the mind rests in sleep is BRAHMAN.ìOm Keneshitam Patati Preshitam ManahóWilled and directed by whom does the mindgo towards its desired objects?î (Kenopanishad).

The head clerk has got two functions to perform. He gets direct orders from the managerand he has to supervise the workmen also. Even so, the mind has got two functions. It hasconnections with the Buddhi, the manager and Karma-Indriyas, the workers.Mind is more internal than speech. Buddhi (intellect) is more internal than the mind.Ahankara is more internal than Buddhi. Jiva Chaitanya (Abhasa, reflected intelligence) is moreinternal than Ahankara. Atman or Kutastha is more internal than the Jiva Chaitanya. There isnothing internal to Atman.

Being quite unreal, Ahankara will perishthrough efforts.PROOF FOR THE EXISTENCE OF MINDWhat is the nature of the Atman or Brahman? It is Sat-Chit-Ananda. Atman is Vyapaka.Then, what is it that limits the individual soulís vision? It is only mind. This fact proves theexistence of an internal instrument, the mind.In the commentary on the Brihadaranyaka, Sri Sankara gives two proofs of the existence ofManas.One is that it is Manas which renders all knowledge through senses possible. It is calledSarva Karma Vishaya Yoga. Sense-knowledge is the product of the connection between the mindand the sensory organs. That is why there is no simultaneity of the knowledge of the impressionsreceived through the various sensory organs. People say, ìMy mind was elsewhere. I did not seethat.î The impossibility of this simultaneity of knowledge through various sensory organs is anindication of the existence of the mind.The soul is a constant factor. Between the Atman and the organs of senses, a connecting linkis necessary. We have to acknowledge the existence of an internal organ (Mind), through whoseattention and non-attention, perception takes place. If we do not admit the internal organ, therewould result either perpetual perception or perpetual non-perceptionóthe former when there is aconjunction of Atman, the sense (Indriya) and the object (Vishaya), the three constituting theinstruments of perception. If, on the conjunction of these three causes, the effect did not follow,there would take place perpetual non-perception. But, neither is the case. We have, therefore, toacknowledge the existence of an internal organ on whose attention (Avadhana) and non-attention(Anavadhana) perception and non-perception take place. This is the argument for the existence ofAntahkarana or mind.11MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"The other proof is the capacity for judgment which we possess.

It has noself-consciousness. An animal feels the discomfort and pain. It is not able to analyse its own mentalstates. A man not only ìknowsî, but he ìknows that he knows.î This is either mental consciousnessor self-consciousness. The man not only ìfeelsî or ìsensesî things, but he has words to express hisfeelings and sensations. He can vividly describe his feelings. He may think of himself asexperiencing them. He can separate himself from the sensation of feeling. He is able to think, ìIfeel; I hear; I see; I smell; I taste; I desire; I act; I enjoy,îìI know this book.î ìI know also that I know this book.î This is self-consciousness peculiarto human beings only.In the Police Station, the Chaprasi (peon) strikes ten at the gate. The sound vibrates andpasses into the ears of men and animals. The animals also hear ten times the beating. But the mancounts them and knows through his Buddhi, ìNow it is ten oíclock.î He has got this Visesha Jnana(special knowledge); whereas animals have got Samanya Jnana (ordinary knowledge). It is thisspecial knowledge that differentiates a man from an animal. Ahara (food), Nidra (sleep), Bhaya(fear) and Maithuna (copulation) are common to both. Through this Visesha Jnana he knows rightfrom wrong, good from bad, what to do (Kartavya) and what not to do (Akartavya).THE FOUR SOURCES OF KNOWLEDGEInspiration, revelation, insight, intuition, ecstasy, divine sight and Paramananda state arethe seven planes of knowledge. There are four sources of knowledge, viz., instinct, reason, intuitionand super-intuition or Brahma-Jnana.InstinctWhen an ant crawls in your right arm, the left arm automatically moves towards the rightarm to drive away the ant. The mind does not reason there. When you see a scorpion in front of yourleg, you withdraw your leg automatically. This is termed instinctive or automatic movement. Asyou cross a street, how instinctively you move your body to save yourself from the cars! There is noVritti in such mechanical movement.Instinct is found in animals and birds. In birds, the ego does not interfere with the free divineflow and divine play. Hence the work done by them through their instincts is more perfect than thatdone by human beings. Have you not noticed the excellent work done by birds in their building ofwonderful nests?12WHAT IS MIND?"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"ReasonReason is higher than instinct and is found only in human beings. It collects facts,generalises, reasons out from cause to effect, from effect to cause (a priorianda posteriorimethodsof reasoning), from premises to conclusions, from propositions to proofs. It concludes, decides andcomes to judgment. It takes you safely to the door of intuition and leaves you there.Belief, reasoning, knowledge and faith are the four important psychic processes. First youhave belief in a doctor. You go to him for diagnosis and treatment. He makes a thoroughexamination and then prescribes certain medicines. You take them. You reason out: ìSuch and suchis the disease. The doctor has given me Iron and Iodide. Iron will improve my blood. The Iodidewill stimulate the lymphatics and absorb the exudation and growth in the liver. So I should take it.îThen the disease is cured, by a course of these drugs, in a month. Then you get knowledge of andperfect faith in the efficacy of the medicine and the proficiency of the doctor. Then you recommendto your friends this doctor and his drugs.IntuitionIntuition is spiritual Anubhava. Knowledge through functioning of Karana-Sarira isintuition. Sri Aurobindo calls it super-mind or supramental consciousness. There is directperception of truth (Pratyaksha) or immediate knowledge through Samadhi. You know things by aflash. Professor Bergson preached about intuition in France to make the people understand thatthere is another higher source of knowledge than intellect. In intuition, there is no reasoning processat all. It is Pratyaksha. Intuition transcends reason, but does not contradict it. Intellect takes a man tothe door of intuition and returns back. Intuition is Divyadrishti. It is Jnana-Chakshus. Spiritualflashes and glimpses of truth come through intuition. Inspiration, revelation, spiritual insight comethrough intuition.Atma-JnanaAtma-Jnana is above intuition. It transcends the Karana-Sarira. It is the highest form ofKnowledge. It is the only Reality.13MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Chapter 2MIND AND BODYBODY, THE MOULD FOR MINDíS ENJOYMENTThe body with its organs is no other than the mind. The physical body is the outwardmanifestation of the mind. Mind is the subtle form of this physical body. The mind contemplatingupon the body becomes the body itself and then, enmeshed in it, is afflicted by it. All the bodieshave their seat in the mind only. Should the mind be paralysed, then the body will not evince ourintelligence. Without water, can a garden exist? It is the mind which transacts all business and is thehighest of the bodies. Mental actions are the real actions. The mind performs all actions veryspeedily in the Linga Sarira and fluctuates thereby. But, the gross body knows not anything and isinert. Even should this gross body be dissolved, the mind will assume fresh bodies to its liking veryquickly. This physical body is the mould, as it were, made by the mind for its own enjoyment, for itsoutpouring of its energy and thereby gaining different experiences of this world through the fiveavenues or channels of knowledge, the five Jnana-Indriyas (organs of knowledge or perception).THOUGHTS MAKE THE BODYThe actions of the mind alone are indeed actions; not so much those of the body. The bodyis really our thoughts, moods, convictions and emotions objectivised, made visible to the nakedeyes. It is a point worthy to note with care that every cell in the body suffers or grows, receives alife-impulse or a death-impulse, from every thought that enters the mind, for you tend to grow intothe image of that which you think about most.When the mind is turned to a particular thought and dwells on it, a definite vibration ofmatter is set up and often more of this vibration is caused, the more does it tend to repeat itself tobecome a habit, to become automatic. The body follows the mind and imitates its changes. If youconcentrate your thought, the eyes become fixed.Every change in thought makes a vibration in your mental body and this, when transmittedto the physical body, causes activity in the nervous matter of your brain. This activity in the nervouscells causes many electrical and chemical changes in them. It is thought-activity which causes thesechanges.FACE: AN INDEX OF MINDMind is the subtle form of this physical body. The physical body is the outwardmanifestation of the mind. So when the mind is rough, the body is rough too. As a man of roughappearance generally cannot invoke love and mercy of others, so a rough-minded man cannotinvoke love and mercy of anybody. Mind very conspicuously reflects on the face its various stateswhich a man of intelligence can very easily read. Face is an index of the mind, just as the tongue isan index of the stomach.14WHAT IS MIND?"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"The body follows the mind. If the mind thinks of falling from a height, the body preparesitself immediately and shows external signs. Fear, anxiety, grief, cheerfulness, hilarity, angeróallproduce their various impressions on the face.The eyes which represent the windows of the soul bespeak of the condition and state of themind. There is a telegraphic instrument in the eyes to transmit the messages or thoughts oftreachery, cunningness, fraud, pure love, compassion, devotion, depression, gloom, hatred,cheerfulness, peace, harmony, health, power, strength and beauty.If you have the faculty to read the eyes of others, you can read the mind at once. You canread the uppermost thought or dominant thought of a man if you are careful to mark the signs in hisface, conversation and behaviour. It needs a little pluck, acumen, training, intelligence andexperience.Your thoughts, sentiments, modes and emotions produce their strong impressions on theface. The face is like an advertisement board wherein is advertised what is going on inside the mind.In face, you can hardly hide your thoughts. You may foolishly think that you have kept up yourthoughts in secret. Thoughts of lust, greed, jealousy, anger, revenge, hatred, etc., at once producetheir deep impressions on your face. The face is a faithful recorder and a sensitive registeringapparatus to register and record all the thoughts that are running in your mind. The face is a polishedmirror to indicate the nature of the mind and its contents at a particular time.He who thinks that he can hide his thoughts is a dunce of the first water. His position is likethat of the ostrich which, when chased by the hunters, hides its head underneath the sand andimagines that it cannot be seen by anyone.Your face is like a gramophone record or plate. Whatever you think is at once written onyour face. Every vicious thought serves as a chisel or needle to write down the thoughts on yourcountenance. Your faces are covered with the scars and wounds which are made by the viciousthoughts of hatred, anger, lust, jealousy, revenge, etc. From the nature of the scar in your face, I canat once read your state of mind. I can at once diagnose your disease of the mind.MUTUAL INFLUENCE BETWEEN MIND AND BODYThe mind is intimately connected with the body. The mind acts upon the body and the bodyreacts upon the mind. Mind has influence over the body. A pure, healthy mind means a healthybody. Grief in the mind weakens the body. Body influences the mind also in its turn. If the body isstrong and healthy, the mind also becomes healthy and strong. If the body is sick, the mind alsobecomes sick. A pain in the stomach causes depression in the mind.BAD THOUGHTS, THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF DISEASEThe primary cause of diseases which afflict the body is bad thoughts. Whatever you hold inyour mind will be produced in the physical body. Any ill-feeling or bitterness towards anotherperson will at once affect the body and produce some kind of disease in the body. Intense passion,hatred, longstanding bitter jealousy, corroding anxiety, fits of hot temper actually destroy the cells15MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"of the body and induce disease of the heart, liver, kidneys, spleen and stomach. Violent fits of hottemper do serious damage to the brain cells, throw poisonous chemical products into the blood,produce general shock and depression and suppress the secretion of gastric juice, bile and otherdigestive juices in the alimentary canal, drain away your energy, vitality, induce premature old ageand shorten life.When the mind is agitated, then this body also is agitated. Wherever the body goes, the mindfollows. When both the body and mind are agitated, the Prana flows in a wrong direction. Instead ofpervading the whole body steadily and equally, it will vibrate at an unequal rate (unrhythmically).Then the food is not digested properly. Diseases originate. If the primary cause is removed, then alldiseases will disappear.The pains that afflict the physical body are called secondary diseases, whilst the Vasanasthat affect the mind are termed mental or primary diseases. If bad thoughts are destroyed, all bodilydiseases will vanish. Purity of mind means healthy body. Therefore, be careful in your thinking, inthe selection of your thoughts. Always entertain noble, sublime, loving and kind thoughts. You willhave harmony, health and beauty.A LAMENTABLE PRACTICEIt is lamentable, indeed, to note that most of the doctors in the world, particularly theallopaths, do more harm than good to their patients. They exaggerate the nature of the disease totheir patients. They fill their minds with imaginary fears of all sorts. They do not know the power ofsuggestions and their influences on the minds of their patients. As greed is ingrained in their minds,as the desire to become rich is deep-rooted in their minds, they try their level best to extract fromtheir patients as much money as they can. If they say to their patients, ìThis disease is nothing. I willmake you all right within a couple of hours,î who is going to pay them amply? They give wrongsuggestions to their patients: ìThis is a terrible disease. This is an incurable disease. A dangerouspoison, a dangerous microbe is lurking in your lungs.î The poor patient spends sleepless nights onaccount of imaginary fear, on account of wrong suggestion given by the doctor. Every moment hethinks: ìI may die at any moment. The doctor has said that my disease is dangerous and incurable.îHe drags a cheerless existence. The worry and anxiety and fear destroy millions of redblood-corpuscles daily. The doctor gives the wrong suggestions to glorify his skill, dexterity in theprofession also.THE ROOT OF ALL EVILSThe erroneous imagination that you are the body is the root of all evils. Through wrongthinking, you identify yourself with the body. Dehadhyasa arises. You are attached to the body.This is Abhimana. Then, Mamata (mineness) arises. You identify yourself with your wife, children,house, etc. It is identification or attachment that brings about bondage, misery and pain. You neverwept when millions of Germans died in the war. Why? Because, there was no identification andattachment. But, you weep profusely when your son dies, on account of attachment. The word ëMyíproduces wonderful influence in the mind. Note the difference in effects produced in the mind whenyou hear the two sentences: ëHorse is deadí and ëMy horse is dead.í16MIND AND BODY"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"PAIN IS IN MIND ONLYPain is evident so long as you connect yourself with the mind. There is no pain in sleep. Ifthere is an inflammatory swelling on your back with throbbing pain, you do not experience any painat night when you are asleep. Only when the mind is connected with the diseased part throughnerves and thinking, you begin to experience pain. There is no pain when the mind is disconnectedfrom the body by the administration of chloroform. During moments of great joy, the severe painentirely ceases, as the mind is taken away from the body, from the seat of the pain. If you canconsciously withdraw the mind from the diseased part by concentrating it on God or any otherattractive object, you will not experience any pain even when you are wide awake. If you have apowerful will and strong Titiksha (power of endurance), then also you will not experience any pain.By constant thinking of any trouble or disease, you only augment your pain and suffering. Pain is inmind. Atman or spirit is Anandasvarupa (full of bliss).CONQUER THE MIND TO CONTROL THE BODYWith the majority of mankind, the mind is greatly under the control of the body. Their mindsbeing very little developed, they live on Annamaya Kosha mostly. Develop the VijnanamayaKosha and, through Vijnanamaya Kosha (Buddhi), control the Manomaya Kosha (mind). TheVijnanamaya kosha is developed by abstract thinking and reasoning, by systematic meditation,Brahma-Chintana, study of the Upanishads, Yogavasishtha and Brahma Sutras.When you have controlled the mind, you have perfect control over the body. The body isonly a shadow of the mind. It is the mould prepared by the mind for its expression. The bodybecomes your slave when you have conquered the mind.Chapter 3MIND, PRANA AND KUNDALINIPRANAóTHE OUTER COAT OF MINDThere are two principal Tattvas in the universe, viz., mind and Prana. Wherever there isPrana, there is mind also. Even in the external movement of breath beyond the nose, the mind ismixed with the external breath. Prana (energy) is the outer overcoat for the mind. Prana digests thefood, turns it into chyle and blood and sends it to the brain and mind. The mind is then able to thinkand do Brahma-Vichara (enquiry into Brahman). The life of the mind is kept up through thevibration of the subtle psychic Prana which gives rise to the formation of thought.Prana is gross. Mind is subtle. Mind is formed out of the conglomerate Sattvic essence ofthe five Tanmatras; whereas, Prana is formed out of the sum total of Rajasic essence of the fiveTanmatras. That is the reason why mind is more Sukshma than the Prana.17MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"The Pranamaya Kosha (vital sheath) is more subtle than the physical body. It overlaps theAnnamaya Kosha (physical sheath) and is more extensive than it. Manomaya Kosha is more subtlethan the Pranamaya Kosha and more extensive than the vital sheath. You have to touch the body ofanother man to have a physical influence over him. Whereas you can stand at a distance and bymere ëpassesí you can impart your Prana to him; because, Prana (vital) is more subtle than the body.You can influence a man mentally through thought even though he lives a thousand miles awayfrom you, because mental force is more subtle than Prana.INTER-DEPENDENCE OF MIND AND PRANAPrana and mind stand to one another in the relationship of the supporter and the supported.Both these are only like the flower and its odour or a sesamum seed and the oil in it. If either of themis slain, then the other also will cease to exist. If the mind and Prana cease to exist, then thoughtswill not arise at all. The destruction of both will confer Moksha on all.Ekagrata (one-pointedness) and Nirodha (controlled state) are two Avasthas of the mind.Spanda (subtle or Sukshma) and Nirodha are two Avasthas of the Prana. When the mind becomesone-pointed, Spanda Avastha of the Prana comes by itself. If the mind is purified with true SattvaGuna, the Prana will be distributed freely throughout the body. The food will be digestedthoroughly.MIND, PRANA AND VIRYAMind, Prana and Virya (semen) are under one Sambandha (connection). If you can controlany one of these three, the other two are controlled by themselves, quite easily. Hatha Yogins try tocontrol the Prana. Raja Yogins try to control the mind. Jnana Yogins start their Sadhana withBuddhi and will.BENEFITS OF PRANAYAMABy Pranayama (control of Prana or restraint of breath), you can also increase the mentalenergy and develop thought-control and thought-culture. This will help concentration andmeditation. This will make the mind steady. This will remove Rajas (passion) and Tamas (inertia).This will burn the dross in the mind.By Pranayama, the mind gradually moves from the gross to the subtle. It, therefore,exercises a wholesome check upon sexual irritation. When some evil thought disturbs your mind, atonce take to Padmasana or Siddhasana and do Pranayama. The thought will leave you immediately.THE SUPERIORITY OF PRANA OVER MINDThe sight is more internal than speech as the sight generally informs without contradiction.Similarly, the hearing than the sight, as the eye may convey false impressions, e.g., the mother ofpearl as silver, but the ear never hears a non-existing sound. Similarly, the ear only exercises itsfunctions with the aid of the mindís attention and, similarly, the mind depends on the Prana or life.Prana is, therefore, Brahman, the Innermost of all.18MIND, PRANA AND KUNDALINI"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"ìForsooth, mind departed from the body.

Then did mind say unto Prana, ëThe quality of containing all, which belonged to me, is due tothee.í The function of mind belongs to Prana; from Prana or life proceed all.î (ChhandogyaUpanishad, V-xiv-15). This parable illustrates the superiority of life (Prana) over mind and otherorgans. In reality, there was no dispute of any kind.MIND AND KUNDALINIKundalini, the serpent-like coiled power that lies dormant with 312coils with the facedownwards in the Muladhara Chakra, the basal lotus at the end of the spinal column, is connectedwith Prana and Prana is connected with the mind.Even a Vedantin (student of the path of Jnana) can get Jnana-Nishtha (superconscious state)only through the awakening of Kundalini Sakti. No superconscious state or Samadhi is possiblewithout the awakening of this primordial energy, whether it is in Raja Yoga, Bhakti Yoga or JnanaYoga.Kundalini Sakti can only be aroused when the mind is actually free from passions anddesires. Sakti-Chalana or Asvani Mudra, Tadana, Pracharanaóall help in awakening theKundalini. Mahabheda helps in taking the Kundalini higher up. When the Kundalini Sakti isawakened, the mind enters, along with Prana and Jiva, the Sushumna and all perceptions are in themental space (Chidakasa). After Kundalini is awakened, Prana passes upwards through Sushumnaor Brahma Nadi within the spinal cord, along with mind and Agni. The Yogin is freed from physicalconsciousness. You are shut out from the external objective world. As soon as Kundalini isawakened for the first time, a Yogin gets these six kinds of experiences which last for a short time,viz., Ananda (spiritual bliss), Kampana (tremor of various parts of the body), Udbhava (risingabove the ground from his Asana), Ghurni (intoxication divineóthe body moves in a circle), Nidra(sleep) and Murchha (fainting). After awakening the Kundalini, you will have to take it up toSahasrara in the top of the head.When this Kundalini moves from Chakra to Chakra (from centre to centre), layer after layerof the mind opens up. The Yogin experiences different kinds of bliss (Ananda) at each new centre.He gets different experiences also as well as different powers. He gets control over the fiveelements. He perceives the universe in its subtle or causal form. He gets full knowledge of the typesof various kinds of the causal plane.

Subtlest part of food reaches upward tothe heart and thence entering the arteries called the ëHitaí, and thereby bringing into existence theaggregate of the organs of speech and being changed into the form of the mind, it increases themind. And thus, the mind, being increased by food, is material and not eternal as held by theVaiseshikas.The Upanishadic philosophers believed that the mind depends upon the food for itsformation. ìThe food that we take is transformed in three different ways: the gross or the heaviestpart of it becomes the excrement; that of medium density is transformed into flesh and the finestpart goes to form the mind.î (Chhandogya Upanishad, VI-v-1) ìJust as in the churning of curd, itsfine particles rise up and are transformed into butter, so when food is consumed, the subtlest partrises up and is transformed into mind.î (Chhandogya Upanishad, VI-vi-1 & 2). Later, even in thedays of the Bhagavad-Gita, we find that the three different mental temperamentsóthe Sattvic, theRajasic and the Tamasicówere supposed to be due to the three different kinds of food what we eat.(Bhagavad-Gita, XVII-8 & 10).QUALITY OF MIND DEPENDS UPON QUALITY OF FOODFood has a direct and intimate connection with the mind and plays a vital part in themake-up of the mind. Sattvic diet calms the mind. Rajasic diet excites the mind. Mark the differencein nature between a tiger which lives on flesh and a cow which lives on grass. Food exercisesimportant influence on the mind. You see it clearly every day. It is very difficult to control the mindafter a heavy, sumptuous, indigestible, rice meal. The mind runs, wanders and jumps like a monkeyall the time. Alcohol causes tremendous excitement in the mind.Food plays an important role in meditation. For purposes of meditation, the food must belight, Sattvic and nutritious. The body is Annamaya (made up of food). Bhairavi Chakra is inAnnamaya Kosha. Bhairavi Chakra is Maya.

It is better if it is given up.FOOD ITEMS HELPFUL IN MEDITATIONMilk, fruits, almonds, sugar-candy, butter, green oats, Bengal oats (Chenai) soaked in waterovernight, bread, etc., are all helpful in meditation. Thed, a kind of Kandamula found in abundancein Brahmapuri, Vasishtha Guha and other parts of the Himalayas, is very Sattvic. It helpsmeditation. My friend and spiritual brother Swami Purushottamanandaji used to live on that forsome days when he was at Vasishtha Guha, fourteen miles from the reputed Rishikesh.Sunthi-Sevana (taking powder of dried ginger) is very good for aspirants. It can be taken along withmilk. It refreshes the mind and helps digestion. Yogins take it very often. Triphala water also istaken by Yogins. It removes constipation, cools the system and stops wet-dreams. Myrobalan orHaritaki (Harad of the yellow kind) can be chewed by Yogic practitioners very often. It preservessemen and checks nocturnal discharges. Potatoes boiled without salt or roasted in fire are verygood.A NOTE OF CAUTIONEvolution is better than revolution. Do not make sudden changes in anything, particularly infood. Let the change be gradual. The system should accommodate it without any hitch.Natura nonfacil saltum(nature never moves by leaps).A Raja Yogin who wants to control the mind must be able to avoid the two extremes, viz.,luxury and severe Tamasic Tapas. Too much fasting brings about extreme weakness. You cannotdo any Sadhana. You cannot think. You cannot ratiocinate. Take any food that suits you. Do notmake much fuss about it. Any food that is readily available and that agrees with your system isharmless.21MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"WHEN FOOD CAN BE DISPENSED WITHFood is only a mass of energy. Water supplies energy to the body. Air also furnishes energy.You can live without food for very many days, but you cannot live without air even for someminutes. Oxygen is even more important. What is wanted to support the body is energy. If you cansupply the energy from any other source, you can dispense with food entirely. Yogins keep up thebody without food by drinking nectar. This nectar flows through a hole in the palate. It dribbles andnourishes the body. A Jnani can draw energy directly from his pure, irresistible will and support thebody without food. If you know the process of drawing the energy from the cosmic energy or solarenergy, you can maintain the body with this energy alone for any length of time and can dispensewith food.THE SECRET OF MADHUKARI BHIKSHAThe mind is made out of the subtle essence of food. So it is attached to those persons fromwhom it receives the food. If you live with a friend for a couple of months and take food with him,your mind gets attached to that friend who feeds you. That is the reason why a Sannyasin lives onMadhukari Bhiksha from three to five houses, avoids attachment and travels from village to village.He is not allowed to stay for more than a day in a village during his Parivrajaka (wanderingitinerant) life. The mind of a Paramahamsa who thus lives on alms is as clean as the Ganga waterand is absolutely free from attachment of any kind. ATTACHMENT BRINGS BONDAGE. Attachmentis death. Attachment is the root of all evils.Chapter 5THE THREE AVASTHASMind has got three Avasthas, viz., Jagrat (waking state), Svapna (dreaming state) andSushupti (deep sleep state).JAGRAT AVASTHA (WAKING STATE)The individual soul (Jiva) is called awake as long as it is connected with the various externalobjects by means of the modifications of the mindówhich thus constitute limiting adjuncts of thesoulóapprehends those external objects and identifies itself with the gross body which is one ofthose external objects. During waking state, the mind occupies the brain.SVAPNA AVASTHA (DREAMING STATE)When the mind enters the Hita Nadi, which proceeds from the heart and surrounds the greatmembrane round the heart, which is as thin as a hair divided into thousand parts and is filled withthe minute essence of various colours of white, black, yellow and red, the individual soul or Jiva(ego) experiences the state of dream (Svapna Avastha).22MIND AND FOOD"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"In dream, the senses are thrown off just as you throw off your suit when going to bed. Indream state, the senses are quiet and absorbed in the mind. Mind alone plays during dream. Themind alone operates in a free and unfettered manner. There is no land, no sea, no horse, no elephantin dream; but mind creates everything out of its own body, out of the materials supplied fromwaking consciousness. The mind itself assumes the various forms of bee, flower, mountain,elephant, horse, river, etc. It is the subject. It is the object as well. The seer and the seen are one.The objects perceived in dreams are revivals of impressions received in waking state andhave an external reality only to the dreamer. When modified by the impressions which the externalobjects have left, the Jiva sees dreams. Perception takes place through the internal organ calledManas; so it is called ìinner perception.îEvery man has his own subjective mental world and his own dream-creatures. Thedream-creatures of a young lady are her husband and new-born babe. Her mind has two strongmental images, viz., those of her husband and baby. The mental images are strengthened byconstant thinking. The dream-creatures of a doctor are his patients, while those of a barrister are hisclients.There is temperamental difference. Some rarely get dreams. A Jnani who has Knowledge ofthe Self will not have any dream.THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN JAGRAT AND SVAPNAThe difference between the waking and the dreaming states consists in this, that in thewaking condition the mind depends on the outward impressions, while in the dreaming state, itcreates its own impressions and enjoys them. It uses, of course, the materials of the waking hours.In Jagrat state, the objects exist independent of the mind. So, every day you see the sameobjects as soon as you wake up from sleep. But in dreams, the objects of dream exist only so long asthere is mind, so long as the dream lasts, because the dream-creatures are manufactured out of mindonly. In dream, mind itself creates the dream-creatures out of the materials supplied by wakingexperiences with some modifications. When mind drops down to waking state, all dream-objectsvanish.WAKING STATE, A LONG DREAMYou dream that you are a king. You enjoy various kinds of royal pleasures. As soon as youwake up, everything vanishes. But, you do not feel for the loss because you know that thedream-creatures are all false. Similarly, even in the waking consciousness if you are wellestablished in the idea that the world is a false illusion, you will not get any pain. When you knowthe real Tattva (Brahman), the waking consciousness also will become quite false like a dream.Jagrat state is only a long dream (Dirgha Svapna). The state of waking consciousness does not existeither in dream or sleep. Therefore, it is illusory. Reality always exists in all conditions or states.Wake up and realise, my child!23MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"SVAPNA-JAGRATManorajya (building castles in the air), recollection of the events and things of dream,recollection of things long past in the waking state are all Svapna-Jagrat (dreaming in the wakingstate).SUSHUPTI AVASTHA (DEEP SLEEP STATE)When the mind enters the Puritat Nadi, the state of deep sleep sets in. In Dridha Sushupti(dreamless sleep), you have a cessation of empirical consciousness. There is no play of the mind inthis Avastha (state). There is neither Raga nor Dvesha (attraction or repulsion, like or dislike). Themind gets Laya into its cause. Manolaya (involution of the mind) takes place. There is no play of theIndriyas (organs, senses) too.This state of profound sleep is not a complete non-being or negative, for such a hypothesisconflicts with the later recollections of a happy repose of sleep. The self continues to exist, though itis bereft of all experiences. The consciousness is continuous. You feel you have existed even duringsleep as soon as you are awake. You feel that you exist always. Vedantins build their philosophyaround this Sushupti Avastha. This stage gives them the clue to the non-dual state (Advaitic state).A careful study of the three states-Jagrat, Svapna and Sushupti (waking, dreaming and deepsleep)óis of immense practical use for the clear understanding of the Vedanta.Says Ajata Satru to Gargya in Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (II-i-16): ìWhere was the spiritwhose nature is like knowledge at the time when one profoundly sleeps? When the spirit whosenature is like knowledge thus profoundly slept, then the ether in the midst of the heart, drawing in,together with the knowledge of the senses, slept therein in the ether. When the spirit draws in that(knowledge of the senses), then he sleeps indeed. Thus, life is drawn in, speech is drawn in, the eyeis drawn in, the ear is drawn in and the mind is drawn in.îWhen, on the cessation of the two limiting adjuncts (i.e., the subtle and the gross bodies) andthe consequent absence of the modifications due to the adjuncts, the Jiva is in the state of deep sleep,merged in the self as it were, then it is said to be asleep. ìWhen a man sleeps here, then my dear, hebecomes united with the Sat; he is gone to his own self. Therefore, they say of him, ëHe sleeps(Svapiti), because he is gone to his own (Svamapiti)í.î (Chhandogya Upanishad)Sankara observes that the phenomena of duality caused by the action of the mind are presentin the waking and dreaming states only, but absent in deep sleep state. In waking and dreamingstates, there is the play of the thoughts (and the simultaneous occurrence of names and forms) andhence the world as well. In dreamless sleep, there are no thoughts; and hence, there is no world too.We taste the nature of absolute bliss in dreamless sleep, where a man is cut off from the distractingworld. It is the mind (lower Manas) that creates differences, distinctions, duality and separateness.If this mind is destroyed by increasing the Sattva and Ahangraha Upasana, then you will feeloneness everywhere (Sarvatmabhava). This needs continuous and strenuous efforts on the part ofthe Sadhakas.24THE THREE AVASTHAS"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"DEGREE OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE THREE STATESIn sleep, some action or other is always going on in your mental or vital being; thingshappen there and they govern waking consciousness. For instance, some are very anxious to perfectthemselves and make a great effort in this direction during the day. They go to sleep and when theyrise the next day, they find no trace of the gains of their previous dayís efforts; they have to traversethe same ground once again. This means that the effort, and whatever achievement there was,belonged to the mere superficial or wakeful parts of the being, but there were deeper and dormantparts that were not touched. In sleep, you fell into the grip of these unconscious regions and theyopened and swallowed all that you had laboriously built up in your conscious hours.Be conscious. Be conscious of the night as well as of the day. First, you will have to getconsciousness, afterwards control. Such of you as remember your dreams may have had thisexperience that sometimes, even while dreaming, you knew it was a dream; you knew that it was anexperience that did not belong to the material world. Once you know, you can act there in the sameway as in the material world. Even in the dreaming state, you can exercise your conscious will andchange the whole course of your dream experience. And, as you become more and more conscious,you will begin to have the same control over your being at night as you have during the daytime,perhaps even more. For, at night, you are free from slavery to the mechanism of the body. Thecontrol over the processes of the body-consciousness is more difficult, since they are more rigid,less amenable to change than are the mental or the vital processes. At night, the mental and vitalparts of your being, especially the vital ones, are very active. During the day, they are under check;the physical consciousness automatically replaces their free play and expression. In sleep, thischeck is removed and they come out with their natural and free movements.SUSHUPTI AND ADVAITA NISHTHA DISTINGUISHEDIn sleep, the mind is in a subtle state. The Vrittis have also assumed a subtle state. But, inAdvaita (Vedantic) Nishtha, there is no mind. There is no universe. The world sinks down inBrahman (Prapanchopasamam)ó(Vide Mandukya Upanishad, II-1).THE SUPREME SELF IN THE THREE AVASTHASThe Supreme Self which has four forms, is inside the bodies of all living beings and isknown by the names Visva, Taijasa, Prajna and Turiya. The seat of the Visva is the right eye; withinthe Manas dwells Taijasa, (Manasyantastu TaijasahóGaudapadaís Karika on the MandukyaUpanishad), while Prajna resides in the ether of the heart. The objects of enjoyment are of threekindsógross, subtle and bliss itself. Satisfaction is also threefold.Jagaritasthano Bahishprajnah Saptanga Ekonavimsatimukhah Sthulabhuk VaisvanarahPrathamah PadahóThe first foot of Omkara is Vaisvanara, whose region is the waking state, whohas objective consciousness, who has seven limbs1and nineteen mouths2and who enjoys gross25MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL1 The seven limbs are: (i) Heaven (is His head), (ii) Sun (is His eye), (iii) Wind (is His breath), (iv) Akasa (is Hiswaist), (v) Water (is His pelvis), (vi) Fire (is His mouth) and (vii) Earth (is His feet).2 The nineteen mouths are: Five Jnana-Indriyas, five karma-Indriyas, five Pranas and four Antahkaranas (Manas,Buddhi, Chitta and Ahankara)."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"objects.î (Mandukya Upanishad, I-3).

That is thestate of deep sleep wherein the sleeper does not desire anything and does not see any dream.î(Mandukya Upanishad, I-5). The mind with the Vasanas rests in deep sleep in Mukhya Prana (chiefvital air) in the heart. Mukhya Prana means Brahman. All the Vrittis assume a Sukshma state.Chapter 6THE THREE GUNASGUNAS AND VRITTISThe mind has three Gunas, viz., Sattva (light, bliss, goodness), Rajas (passion, motion) andTamas (inertia, darkness). There are three Vrittis in the mind corresponding to the three Gunas.Santa Vritti (peace) comes out of Sattva Guna, Ghora Vritti from Rajo Guna and Mudha Vritti fromTamo Guna. Equilibrium or balance is Santa Vritti; anger is Ghora Vritti; laziness (Alasya),carelessness (Pramada) and drowsiness (Tandri) are Mudha Vrittis.CHARACTERISTICS OF SATTVA GUNASattva Guna is purity. It is Prakasa (illumination, light). Sattva Guna is a force favourablefor the attainment of Moksha. Daivi Sampatóvirtues such as fearlessness, purity of heart,etc.,ówill confer liberation on you. The effect of Sattva Guna is Brahmavichara (enquiry or searchfor Truth; differentiation between Sat and Asat, what is real and what is unreal.)A Sattvic mind is always steady. It finds delight internally. It may stick to one placeindefinitely. It keeps friendship with persons for a long, long time. It can read the Gita or theYogavasishtha any number of days. It can live on Dal-roti for years together without anygrumbling.26THE THREE AVASTHAS"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"During Sattvic moments, when there is preponderance of pure Sattva in the mind, you are intouch with the Divine Source owing to the cleanness of the mind-mirror. You will get inspiration.You will compose beautiful poetry, etc. Preserve those inspired writings. Jot them down in yournotebook.Sattvapatti is a state of mind wherein the mind is full of Sattva or purity. There is purity ofthought (Bhava-Samsuddhi) and purity of heart (Sattva-Samsuddhi). It is the fourthJnana-Bhumika or fourth stage of Jnana.CHARACTERISTICS OF RAJO GUNARajo Guna is a hostile force to pull you down into Samsara. Asuri Sampatóvices likeDambha, Darpa, Krodha, etc.ówill drag you down into hell. A mind endowed with Sattva Gunawill make a man still and inactive, while a mind with Rajo Guna will make him restless. It will notallow him to sit idle and will force him to work.The Rajasic mind always wants new sensations and variety. It likes certain persons, objectsand places now and, after some time, it becomes disgusted with them and wants new persons forcompany, new vegetables to eat, new books to read and new places to see (finds pleasure insightseeing).The mind of Rajasic type wants always company and talk. These are the two defects whichdistract the mind much. Avoid company. Live alone. Observe Mouna. You will get peace of mind.Most of the pain comes from bad company. Be careful in the selection of your companions. Youwill rarely find a good, sincere friend. Never take a friend into your close confidence without testinghim for a long time. There is no company or talk in Brahman who is Asanga and Asabda.The Rajasic mind has a tendency to look into the defects of others. It also remembers the baddeeds or wrongs done by others and forgets easily their good acts. These two tendencies intensifyhatred and cause frequent disturbance in the mind.A mind which is devoid of Sattva Guna will not be good enough to consider othersíhappiness as its own and will, therefore, be ever reeling. Again, as this mind has not thecomplacency to rejoice at anotherís virtues, there is no internal contentment. Then, as it does notconsider othersí sufferings as its own, there arises in it no compassion for them.It is the Rajasic mind that splits, separates, divides and deceptively shows plurality(Nanatva). The sun is one. The moon is one. Akasa is one. The idea behind languages is one. Thefeeling of sincerity is one. There is no inside or outside. Husband and wife become one in heart.Intimate friends are one in heart. Matter is one. Energy is one. Sattvic mind is one. It unifies.Cosmic Mahat is one. Karma (law of cause and effect) is one. Dharma is one. Religion is one. Truthis one. Brahman is one.Ekameva Advitiyam Brahma(Brahman is one without a second).Intense Rajas takes Sattvic turn. Dacoit Ratnakar became the sage Valmiki. Jagai andMadhai, who were intensely Rajasic and who pelted stones at Lord Gouranga, became his firstdisciples.27MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"IMPORTANCE OF SATTVA GUNAThe real peace of mind does not come from outside. It is produced in the same mind whenthe mind is controlled and its thoughts are checked. You must put forth great efforts to check thepassions and desires. Then alone will your aptitude for activity be subdued and you will be at restand your thoughts will be stilled. Develop, therefore, Sattva Guna by Japa, Vichara, Satsanga,meditation, light Sattvic food, Tapas and Svadhyaya.An ordinary worldly-minded man can hardly hear the inner voice of Atman. He cannot getpure thoughts or Vichara (enquiry into Self) also. Every Sattvic (pure) thought emanates fromSattvic Buddhi (pure intellect). In the case of worldlings, all thoughts proceed from the mind only.He who does Nishkama Karma Yoga (selfless service) and has purity of the mind, begins toentertain thoughts of God and meditation. Generally, the mind raises various sorts of curious,fantastic thoughts. It deludes all. It may pretend to do Vichara also. But, when it comes to actualpractice, it will do nothing. If there is a serious determination in you to concentrate and, if you put itinto actual practice for months steadily and, if the longing for Darshana of God or Self-realisationbecomes keen and acute, then alone think that all these kinds of thoughts proceed from your SattvicBuddhi only.All Sadhanas aim at the development of Sattva Guna and the attainment of pure, irresistibleWill. This will bring about Avidya Nivritti (removal of ignorance) and Paramananda-Prapti(Sat-Chit-Ananda state). Increase of Sattva Guna and pure, strong, determined Will pave a longway in achieving God-realisation.In the world also, there are persons with a few Sattvic virtues such as patience, generosity,forgiveness, etc. But, a spiritual aspirant tries to develop the mind as a whole, to acquire all Sattvicvirtues.Chapter 7THE PSYCHIC STATESSit in silence in a solitary room and watch the various mental phenomena, mental states,moods, impulses, emotions, sentiments, whims, fancies that occur in the mind. It will be ofabsorbing interest to study the subtle states of the inner psychic world.INSTINCTSThere are two powerful instincts in the human beings and animals too. They are the instinctof self-preservation and the instinct of reproduction. Hunger is a manifestation of theself-preserving instinct. Lust is a manifestation of reproductive instinct. An instinct is aninvoluntary prompting to action.28THE THREE GUNAS"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"The Jiva or the individual soul with egoism wants power, name and fame. This is forself-aggrandisement. Exploitation is greed. It is the act of using for selfish purposes. Domineeringis to command haughtily. The Jiva wants to exercise power over others. This is Jiva-Bhavana. Therootcause for industries, business, commerce, etc., is greed and self-preservation. If you want tohave constant Brahma-Bhavana, you will have to give up exploitation and domineering.There is another third instinct, viz., the herding instinct (the instinct for company). Womantake delight in the company of men. Men take delight in the company of women. The rootcause forthis is reproductive instinct. Another reason is that a weak man gains strength in the company of astrong man. But, a man who wants to realise God should shun ruthlessly companyóparticularly,the company of women and worldly-minded persons. He should live alone. Then he will becomevery powerful and strong. He will develop a strong individuality. One will find difficulty in thebeginning in the practice of living alone. Fear will come in. You will have to overcome alldifficulties, one by one, if you want to attain immortality (Amritatva). The reward is very great:Brahmavit Paramapnoti(A Knower of Brahman gets the Highest);Amritamasnute(He drinks thenectar of immortality).IMPULSESAn impulse is a sudden propelling force. There are three kinds of impulses, viz., impulses ofthought, impulses of speech and impulses of action. Mouna (silence) checks the impulse of speech.Meditation checks the impulse of wrong thinking and wrong action.There are two important impulses. They are the sex-impulse and the impulse of speech.There is an intimate relation between impulse and imagination. Imagination induces the impulse.Impulses must be controlled by reason and will and meditation on God.EMOTIONSAn emotion is a combination of thought and desire. Every idea is charged with emotion.Emotions are desires which are penetrated by the thought element. In other words, emotion is desiremingled with thought. The vibrations of emotions will arouse corresponding excitement in purelymental matter and all the manís thoughts will be disturbed and distorted.There is emotion-desire. There is emotion-feeling also. If the desire element ispredominant, it is emotion-desire. If the pleasure element is predominant, it is emotion-feeling.Raga and Dvesha (love and hatred) are the two important emotions of the mind and all thedifferent emotions can be classified under these two headings. Wonder is a compound emotion. It isadmiration and fear combined. Reverence is a compound emotion. It is awe and respect combined.Amarsha is a compound emotion. It is anger and jealousy combined. As soon as the man is pulleddown to a lower level, the anger of the inferior man who was jealous vanishes.Pleasure is a particular kind of emotion in the mind. The mind expands during pleasure.Coolness prevails in the mind. What takes place of the mind when pleasure feeling arises is notexactly understood by the western psychologists. It is incapable of being understood also by29MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"ordinary persons. Only a Yogi or a Jnani knows this psychic phenomenon. During pain, the mindcontracts. Considerable heat is produced in the mind.Many of the physical desires and emotions in man are akin to those of the lower animals.Anger and sex-impulse in man are the brutal instincts. In the undeveloped man, these desires andemotions which belong to the lower nature (Aparaprakriti) predominate and overpower the highernature (Paraprakriti).It is a symptom of weakness to have emotions in the mind. They should be controlled by theintellect and the will.HOW TO CONTROL EMOTIONS AND IMPULSESWhen emotions and impulses trouble you much, be indifferent (Udasina). Say to yourself:ìWho am I? I am not the mind. I am Atman (all-pervading Spirit, Suddha Sat-Chit-Ananda. Howcan emotions affect me? I am Nirlipta (unattached). I am a Sakshi (witness) of these emotions.Nothing can disturb me.î When you repeat these suggestions of Vichara, the emotions will die bythemselves. This Jnana method of controlling emotions is easier than the Yogic method of drivingthe emotions and struggling with the mind (Yogas-chittavritti-nirodhah).SENTIMENTSReligious sentiment, moral sentiment, aesthetic sentiment (or sentiment for the sublime andthe beautiful) are the three important sentiments of the mind. Feeling and sentiments are illusory.They are not in Atman. They are deceptions created by the mind.MOODSMood is a mental state. The Sanskrit term is Bhava. This term also does not express the truesignificance of the word ëmoodí. We say, ìMr. Naidu or Mr. Atkinson is a moody gentleman.î Thismeans he becomes a slave of the mood quickly. We also say, ìThat gentleman is in ëgood moodí orëhappy mood.í î ìI can approach him now for a short interview or talkî or ìHe is in a very ëangrymood.í I should not see him now.îThe English people, during the course of their conversation, use the term ëmoodí in a broadsense. They say: ìHe is in a talking moodî; ìHe is in a silent moodî; ìHe is in a mood of hatredî;ìHe is in a mood of loveî; ìHe is in a mood of selfishnessî; ìHe is in a mood of jealousyî; ìHe is ina mood of separatenessî; ìHe is in a mood of unity.î In the light of Vedanta, these are all Vrittis(thoughts or emotions) only. Dr. Bhagavan Das, the reputed author of ìScience of Emotionsîclassifies these under emotions only.THE TWO KINDS OF MOODS AND THEIR EFFECTSIn Vedanta, there are only two kinds of moods, viz., Harsha (joy, exultation or exhilaration)and Soka (grief or depression). In the mind, these two kinds of moods prevail. Now there is joy.30THE PSYCHIC STATES"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Five minutes later, there is depression. These currents alternate. They belong to the Shad-Urmis(six waves). They are two waves that affect the mind-ocean.People of gloomy moods attract to them gloomy things and gloomy thoughts from othersand from the Akasic records in the physical ether. Persons with hope, confidence and cheerfulspirits attract thoughts of similar nature from others. They are always successful in their attempts.People with negative moods of depression, anger, hatred do positive injury to others. Theyinfect others and raise these destructive Vrittis in others. They are culpable. They do great damagein the thought-world. People with happy and cheerful moods are a blessing to society. They bringhappiness to others.Just as a young, beautiful lady covers her face and does not like to come out to mix withothers in society when she has a nasty festering sore on her cheeks or nose, so also you should notcome in public and mix with your friends and other people when you have a mood of depression, amood of hatred or jealousy. For, you will infect others with these moods. You are a menace tosociety.HOW TO CONTROL NEGATIVE MOODSSadhakas should try to eradicate depression by prayer, meditation, counter-thoughts of joy,chanting of Om, Vichara and singing divine songs. Never give room for gloomy depression. RepeatOm with Bhava. Repeat ìI am Ananda-maya,î ìMy Svarupa is Ananda.î Depression will vanish.There are various causes for this depression. Cloudy day, association with evil persons, indigestion,influence by astral spirits, revival of old Samskaras of depressionóall these induce depression.When you get a talking mood, practise at once ëMounaí (silence). This is an antidote to thetalking mood. When you are in a mood of hatred, develop the opposite virtue of love. This moodwill pass off quickly. When you are in the mood of selfishness, begin to do selfless work. When youare in the mood of separateness, try to mix with others through service, love, kindness and Kshama.When you are in the mood of laziness, do at once some kind of active work, drawing water,gardening, running, brisk walk or biking, etc.A Jivanmukta is absolutely free from all moods. He has controlled all moods completely.He has become a master of all these moods. In Atman, there are no moods. It is pure consciousness.Identify with Atman. You can destroy all moods very easily.THE MEDITATIVE MOODBut, there is one good mood in those who practise meditation. It is termed the ìmeditativemood.î Those who practise concentration and meditation feel this kind of mood. When this moodmanifests, you must immediately give up reading, writing, talking, etc. You must immediately siton the usual Asana (posture) and begin to meditate. Meditation will come by itself without effort.This mood is very favourable for contemplation. Watch for this kind of mood.

They upset you.Everybody has his own whims. Very often you say, ìHe is a whimsical man,î when anyoneis swayed by whims. Whim is also termed caprice.

Much energy is wasted on account of imaginary fears.When his mind is fully occupied with the affairs of the war, the soldier does not feel anyserious injury as a gunshot wound in the leg. He is not aware of the loss of a large quantity of bloodalso. He is filled with enthusiasm. He is not conscious of his bodyóso to sayófor the time being.32THE PSYCHIC STATES"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"When the excitement is over, when he sees some blood-spots on his clothing or when some of hisfriends points out to him the wound in the leg, he gets the consciousness. Then he is alarmed a bit.The power of imagination plays havoc now. He gets a collapse now. The power of imaginationalways exaggerates.A man may have a little weakness. When he becomes your enemy, you at once exaggerateand magnify his weakness and Dosha. You even superimpose on this or concoct many moreweaknesses and Doshas. This is due to evil imagination on your part.Whenever the mind of two friends are strained by ill-feelings, these minds begin toexaggerate and concoct things. Fault-finding increases. It is very difficult to get at the truth of thestatements of these two broken friends with broken friendship. Their utterances are alwayscoloured by their inner feelings. The power of imagination does havoc now. Maya plays havocthrough the mind and its power of imagination.Mind tempts and deceives. Think of one as a good friend of yours and there the thing iscreated as a reality. Think of him as your foe and then also the mind perfects the thought into anactuality. He who knows the working of the mind and has controlled it by practice is really happy.I shall explain to you the nature of ìmental dramatisation.î Mark the ways of the mind.During conversation with your friends, the mind sometimes imagines in vain that it has hurt thefeelings of your friend. It spends much of its energy in unnecessary feeling. You think: ìHow can Isee him tomorrow morning? He may be displeased with me.î Next morning when you meet him,nothing happens. Your friend starts a pleasant conversation and smiles. You are surprised. To yourgreat astonishment, the subject of talk takes quite a different turn altogether. A family-manimagines when a severe epidemic of plague ravages: ìWhat shall I do if my wife develops plagueand dies now? I have got six children.î This is his vain imagination. Nothing happens. Sometimes,when the train moves slowly on the Pamban Bridge over the sea near Ramesvaram, the mindimagines, ìIf the bridge gives way now, what will become of me? I shall be smashed to pieces.î Atouch of fear creeps in. There are thousand and one ways of mental dramatisation like these. Thepower of imagination plays a vital part in mental dramatisation.When your mind is deeply concentrated, period of two hours passes like five minutes. If themind is distracted and wandering, half an hour hangs on as two hours. This is everybodyísexperience. In dream also, many events that represent a period of fifty years take place within tenminutes. Through the play of the mind, a Kalpa is considered by it as a moment andvice versa.Time is but a mode of the mind. It is Kala Sakti. It is also illusory like the objects.Through the trick of the mind, one furlong at times appears to be a great distance and threemiles at other times appear to be a very short distance. You ought to have noted this in your dailylife.Marichi Chaitanya, M.A., Ph.D., a Brahmachari of Rumania and myself sat for dinner in theKailasa Kutia, Svarga Ashram, on the bank of the Ganga. A dish of potato soup was served.Marichi, who has no idea of Indian preparations, took it for a soup of meat. The colour andappearance of the potato soup was exactly the same as that of meat-soup. This is a case of ìmental33MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"projection.î Marichi projected the idea of meat from his own Samskara within the mind into thepotato-soup. Mental projections are all false.Kalpana in the mind means mental creation or imagination. This is the real Yogamaya. Youwill have to destroy these various Kalpanas. This is the aim of all the spiritual Sadhanas. Then youwill be established in Nirvikalpa state of bliss. Pure Nivritti is needed to attain this after you havegot Chitta-Suddhi through Nishkama-Karma Yoga.TEMPERAMENT AND HOW IT CAN BE MODIFIEDThere are secretions from endocrine glands which are ductless viz., Thyroid, Thymus,Parotid, Pineal, Suprarenal, etc. These secretions are directly absorbed into the blood. They play avital part in constituting the temperament of every individual. The temperament of a man can begreatly modified by environments, education and experience. It can hardly be changed in toto. Thatis the reason why the Gita says:ìSadrisam Cheshtate Svasyah Prakriter-JnanavanapióEven theman of knowledge behaves in conformity with natureî (Gita, III-33).Chapter 8THE MENTAL FACULTIESTHE POWER OF THE HUMAN MINDIf you closely study the action of mind upon mind, of mind over matter, of mind over thehuman body, you will find that each man is a power in himself. You will have to develop thepotential faculties by self-restraint and mastery over the passions. When mind is so much powerful,what to speak anything of the glory of Atman, who is the storehouse of everything, who is theinfinite, inexhaustible central magazine of power, knowledge and bliss from whom the little mindborrows its light and power!ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE POWER OF MINDWhenever any fire-accident or any other kind of accident occurs, how agile and nimble youare! Do you not exhibit wonderful powers? You jump over a huge wall, save many children, runamidst fire boldly and carry things. All psychic faculties, memory, imagination, will, etc., are atplay. Chivalry, intrepidity, undaunted spirit, mercy and various other noble virtues are exhibited byyou. Wherefrom did you draw these faculties and powers? From this, you can conclude that you are,in reality, all-powerful. There is a big, magnanimous magazine of power inside. Go to the source bymeditation and tap it. You will get everything. Rely on the Self within.If you get a telegram at 12 a.m. on a hot day in summer, which informs you that your fatheris seriously ailing in your native village which is twenty miles distant, at once you leave even yourfood and begin to gallop. Though you yourself are not in good health at that time, you do not mind34THE PSYCHIC STATES"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"anything as you are very anxious to see your loving father. You even run the whole distance andreach the place within a couple of hours. Then you begin to wonder, ìWhat! I was myself very sick.The day was very hot. I have covered a distance of twenty miles within two hours. What a marvel itis!î This clearly shows that you are, in reality, all-powerful. The mind possesses various kinds ofpowers and faculties. They lie dormant. You will have to awaken them.THE SIX IMPORTANT POWERS OF MINDThere are three Saktis (powers, potencies) in the mind, viz., Ichha Sakti (Will), Kriya Sakti(Action) and Jnana Sakti (Knowledge). A desire arises in the mind. This is Ichha Sakti. The mindexerts to have this desire gratified. This is Kriya Sakti. It plans, schemes and finds out methods, etc.,for the achievement of the desired object. This is Jnana Sakti.Vedana-Sakti (power of perception), Smarana-Sakti or Smriti-Sakti (power of memory),Bhavana-Sakti (Power of imagination), Manisha-Sakti (power of judgment), Ichha-Sakti orSankalpa-Sakti (will or volition) and Dharana-Sakti (power to hold) are the six important powers ofthe mind.Vedana-SaktiVedana-Sakti is power of cognition or sensation or power of perception and knowingthrough Indriyas or senses (Indriya-Jnana or sense-knowledge).Smriti-SaktiThe Smriti-Sakti does three things. It grasps. It holds. It brings to memory whenever a thingis needed. Though the power of grasping is done by the Vedana-Sakti of the mind (power ofperception or cognition), the Smriti-Sakti also participates in the act of grasping.Suppose you hear the sound of a bell in the temple. The memory Sakti grasps it. Then itretains it through Dharana. When you hear again the sound of the temple bell, it at once remindsyou, ìThis is the temple bell. This is not the hostel bell.îIn Dhyana, the mind grasps and takes possession of its perceptions or judgments. It makesthe content of the idea its own. It strengthens the Samskaras so that a voluntary recall is renderedeasy.Bhavana-SaktiYou have never seen an elephant riding a cycle. When a man, who has actually seen it, givesyou a description, your mind forms a mental picture at once. This is done by the Bhavana-Sakti(power of imagination) of the mind.35MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Manisha-SaktiPower of comparing and contrasting, drawing inferences, discussion, conclusion, all belongto Manisha-Sakti of the mind. The Manisha-Sakti (power of judgment) has got two subdivisions,viz., Nirnaya (ascertainment) and Tarka (logical reasoning).A is mortal. B is mortal. C is mortal. Again, all men are mortal. Mr. Choudhary is a man.Therefore, Choudhary is mortal. These sorts of drawing conclusions through inductive anddeductive logic with major and minor premises and middle term or through the five parts ofsyllogistic reasoning of Gautama Rishiís Indian Logic (Nyaya) are done by Manisha-Sakti of themind with the help of Nirnaya and Tarka.Tarka has got two other subdivisions, viz., Anumana (inference) and Paramarsa(discussion). When you see a river in full flood in the morning, you infer that there ought to havebeen rain during previous night. When you see smoke on the hills, you infer that there ought to befire also on the hill. This is due to Anumana.Ichha-SaktiWill is Atma-Sakti. It is the dynamic aspect of Brahman. Will is Brahman in motion. InVedanta, will plays a very conspicuous part.Much has been said about the power of imagination in the Westóthat it is the mosttremendous power in the human mind and that in a conflict between the will and the imagination,the imagination would invariably win the day.Some people say that the will is greater than imagination. In the East, amongst theVedantins, will is regarded as a greater faculty than imagination. What would the imagination dowithout the impelling power of the will to execute with dynamic power the desires, wishes andideals?There is correlation, co-ordination and co-operation between the different principles in themind. Therefore, who can say which is great or small, important or unimportant when each dependsupon the other for its power? It cannot be truly said that the one is greater than the other, for theirindependence and power are derived from one another.Dharana-SaktiDharana-Sakti (power to hold) is really a part of memory or Smarana-Sakti. In commonparlance, we say, ìMr. Ramakrishna is a man of good Dharana in Vedanta.î Here it means that Mr.Ramakrishna has got fixed and steady ideas in Vedanta. He cannot be changed by anybody. He isnot of a wavering nature. He sticks to Vedanta alone. Nobody can shake him.36THE MENTAL FACULTIES"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"ApperceptionApperception is the mindís perception of itself as a conscious agent. The principle ofapperception is just like a mail clerk of consciousness receiving, sorting out, correlating, arranging,pigeon-holing, associating and sending out messages.HOW TO UNFOLD THE LATENT POWERS OF MINDThere are many higher mental faculties latent in man. Mind is a magazine of power. Theunfoldment of these latent, psychic powers is possible through proper Sadhana. The Sadhanashould be systematic, constant and intense. The student also must have reached the proper stage ofdevelopment. There must be genuine Sraddha also. Then only sanguine success is possible.Chapter 9THE THREE DOSHASMilk is agreeable to some and disagreeable to others. There is nothing wrong with the milkitself. Surely, there is something wrong with the mind. Doubtless, there is a defect in the mind. Theview of a child when it sees its mother is that she is its supporter, nourisher and giver of all comforts.The husband of the woman regards her as an object of enjoyment. A tiger, when it sees the samewoman, regards her as its prey. The object, woman, remains the same. The viewpoint differs inthese three cases owing to the Dosha of the mind.Dosha means fault or defect. Mala (impurity), Vikshepa (tossing), Avarana (veil ofignorance) are the threefold defects of the mind.The mind is tossed about among objects of love and hatred like a light feather in a stormywind. It ever whirls far and wide in vain among sensual objects away from the association with thewise, like a strolling city dog; but, no results accrue therefrom. This baneful mind whirls at the sightof its much-coveted immense wealth. This ferocious dog of mind, following its mate of desire, everpreys upon poor, ignorant worldlings as on carcasses. It will flit in a moment from Howrah to Parisand from Colombo to Berlin. Not resting on any object firmly, it is characterised by an excessivefluctuating power. It will fluctuate and be confused, will flit away from an object and then return toit, will rejoice in vain and be intoxicated with Ahankara. A mind becomes a prey to fear through itsfluctuation.The mind should be rendered fit for salvation, fit to approach its Adhishthana (substratum),its father, Brahman. Remove the three Doshas.Mala (such as Kama, Krodha, Lobha, Moha, Mada, Matsarya) is removed by doingNishkama Karma. Mala means sin also.37MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Vikshepa is removed by Upasana, Trataka, Pranayama and Raja Yoga.Avarana is removed by Jnana, study of Vedantic literature, Nididhyasana andAbheda-Chintana after duly understanding the right significance of the Mahavakya, ìTat TvamAsi.îWithout hankering after paltry, terrestrial, things and causing your mind to fluctuatethereby, may you be immovable as a rock! Those who have no lower impulses drive away rebirthsto a great distance from them.Study the nature of the mind. Analyse the mind carefully. Get rid of the three Doshas of themind, viz., Mala, Vikshepa and Avarana. Purify the mind. Steady the mind. Fix the mind on God orBrahman. Get the mind dissolved in God by constant and intense thinking. Practise the Sadhana ofManonasa. Rise above the deceptions and temptations of the mind. This is your duty. You are bornfor this only; all other duties are self-created and self-imposed owing to Avidya or ignorance.Chapter 10SUDDHA MANAS AND ASUDDHA MANASThrough the discriminating mind, the lower mind is powerfully mastered by the wise.ìUddharet-atmana-atmanamóLet him raise the self by the Self.î(Gita, VI-5)THE TWO KINDS OF MINDSuddha Manas or Sattvic mind (pure mind) and Asuddha (impure) Manas or the instinctivemind or desire-mind as it is called are the two kinds of mind according to Upanishadic teaching.There is the lower mind filled with passion. There is the higher mind filled with Sattva (purity).There are two minds. You will have to make it into oneóSattvic mind onlyóif you want tomeditate. It is through the higher or Sattvic mind that you will have to control the lower orinstinctive mind of passions and emotions.There are two kinds of Buddhi alsoóVyavaharic Buddhi and pure Buddhi. There are twokinds of Aham or Ahankara, viz., Suddha Aham which identifies with Brahman (Sat-Chit-Ananda)and Asuddha Aham which identifies with the body. There are two kinds of Sankalpa (resolve,conation), viz., Suddha Sankalpa (thoughts of God) and Asuddha Sankalpa (thoughts of body andthe world).The Asuddha Manas which creates Asuddha Sankalpa, the Vyavaharic Buddhi andAsuddha Ahankaraóall these three form a vicious circle. These three work in co-operation. Theseed of the mind is Ahankara. Mind is merely a bundle of thoughts. Of all thoughts, the ëIí thoughtis the root thought. It is the first thought also that emanated from the mind. Therefore, mind is only38THE THREE DOSHAS"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"the thought ëIí. Buddhi is the basis of Ahankara. It is Buddhi that forces you to identify yourselfwith the physical body. It is Buddhi that creates difference (Bheda) and Nana Bhava (the idea ofmany in the world).CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SATTVIC MINDA Sattvic mind like solitude, silence, simple living, high thinking, study of spiritual books,philosophical discussions, concentration of mind and company of Sadhus, Mahatmas andSannyasins. A stainless mind can be judged through speech, face and eyes. Through theseexpressions, the opinion can be formed whether a person has stainless mind. Higher desires, nobleaspirations, lofty ideals, true religious feeling, mercy, sympathy, pure unselfish love, devotion,Vichara (Atmic enquiry), inspiration, geniusóall come from the higher, pure Sattvic mind. SuddhaManas (pure mind) is Brahman itself. It is an embodiment of purity itself.CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RAJASIC MINDA Rajasic mind likes crowded cities, much talking, luxurious life, low thinking, thecompany of women, study of romantic novels, eating dainty dishes and selfish works. Instinctivemind is the lower, impure Kama Manas with desires, passions and appetities. The vast majority ofpersons have this instinctive mind only. Even the so-called civilised and educated persons live onthe plane of the instinctive mind. Their senses are very sharp and acute and they run after morerefined things for their sense-gratification. They identify themselves with the physical body and thesenses. They have no idea of the subtle Atman which is entirely distinct from the body and theIndriyas. Their ëIí is the physical, gross body only though they know that there is a mind.Sensual enjoyment brings on diseases and destroys the power of discrimination (Viveka). Itmakes the mind Malina (impure). Therefore, shun Vishayabhoga (sensual enjoyment). Try torealise the Self within wherein lies eternal bliss and immortality.SATTVIC MIND NEEDED FOR ATMA-VICHARAA sharp, subtle, one-pointed, Sattvic (pure) mind is needed for Atma-Vichara (enquiry intoAtman or the Supreme Spirit) and study of Upanishads. A gross mind or practical (Vyavaharic)Buddhi with selfishness and lust is absolutely unfit for Vichara and philosophical ratiocination.Selfishness clouds understanding. Selfishness is the bane of life. The mind of a worldling is everready to absorb sexual thoughts. It cannot imbibe subtle, philosophical ideas. It is callous andcannot vibrate properly to take in philosophical ideas. You can drive a nail in clay, but not in astone. The mind has to be purified by Nishkama Karma, Japa, Pranayama and other spiritualSadhanas.Mind is compared to a mirror. If the mirror is dirty, you cannot see your face clearly.Similarly, if the mind-mirror is dirty (full of Mala, impuritiesóKama, Krodha, Lobha, etc.), youcannot see God clearly; you cannot see the Self clearly. The light of Brahman cannot shineefficiently. Clean it up with effort daily, through spiritual Sadhana, meditation, strenuousNishkama Karma Yoga, devotion, etc. You will realise God.39MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"ìManasaiva-anudrashtavyamî is the utterance of the Srutis. Brahman is to be seen by themind. Here ëmindí means the Suddha Manas (pure mind). Brahman can be seen by a mind which isequipped with the four means of salvation; which is rendered subtle and pure by the practice ofSama, Dama, Yama and Niyama; which is furnished with the sacred instructions of a qualifiedGuru and which does Sravana (hearing), Manana (reflection) and Nididhyasana (constant musing).Should the pure mind concentrate itself for some time through a study of Jnana Sastras, associationwith the wise and an uninterrupted practice of meditation, then in such persons developing Jnana, adivine vision will dawn in which there will be a direct cognition of the one Reality.SLAY THE IMPURE MINDThe enemy of Atman is the impure mind, which is replete with excessive delusion and a hostof thoughts. This mischievous and powerful imp of lower mind is the generator of all pains and allfears and the destroyer of all noble, spiritual wealth. Your real enemy is this impure mind onlywhich is full of delusion, Trishnas, Vasanas and host of other impurities. Lest this enemy of mindshould spoil you in diverse ways through the ìenjoymentsî of the many ìpleasuresî in this world,slay it in the hope of getting eternal bliss and spiritual illumination. Destroy the lower Asuddha(impure) Manas through the higher Suddha Manas. Destroy your instinctive mind throughdiscrimination and help of your higher, Sattvic mind. Then and then alone will you get eternal,infinite peace and bliss of Atman. Then alone will you become a Jivanmukta.Sattvic minds and Rajasic minds move in diametrically opposite directions. Sattvic mindunifies. Instinctive mind separates and divides. Voice from the instinctive mind will mislead you.Purify the mind and hear the voice of conscience (Sattvic mind). You will have to develop theSattvic part of the mind by annihilating the lower, impure, instinctive mind. If the lower mind isdone away with through the higher mind alone, then only will you have eternal happiness andpeace. Then alone will you attain Moksha, supreme knowledge and perennial bliss. Slay this mindthrough constant Vichara and meditation on Om and rest in your own Svarupa, Sat-Chit-Anandastate.HOW TO PURIFY THE MINDAs one iron shapes another iron, the pure mind of a person which makes efforts in thevirtuous path should correct and mould his impure mind. Mind is unfailingly rendered pure throughtrue, virtuous and pure actions and constant Satsanga (association with the wise). Speaking the truthand practice of Daya (pure compassion) are very great purifiers of mind. All lofty aspirations,all-embracing tendencies and pityóall go a long way in increasing the Sattvic material of the mind.The higher Manas is developed.Sacrifice, gift, compassion, study of the Vedas and speaking the truth: these five arepurifying. The sixth is penance well-practised. The last one is highly purifying. Pilgrimage tosacred places is also purifying. You come in contact with holy persons there. You can have goodSatsanga.40SUDDHA MANAS AND ASUDDHA MANAS"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Charity, Japa, Nishkama Karma, Yajna, Agnihotra, Brahmacharya, Sandhya, Tirtha-Yatra,Dama, Sama, Yama, Niyama, Svadhyaya, Tapas, Vrata, service of saintsóall tend to purify themind. There will be, doubtless, unalloyed bliss in the mind thus purified.A Mantra purifies the mind. Mere repetition of a Mantra, parrot-like, has very little effect. Ithas some benefit. It must be repeated with Bhava (feeling). Then it produces wonderful effects. TheMantra, unless inspired with the powerful will-force of oneís own mind, cannot produce mucheffect.Study of philosophical works, right thinking, exercise of good and noble emotions, prayersand beneficent endeavours and, above all, regular and strenuous meditation are the means toimprove the mind. These will bring about the rapid evolution of the mind. When the mind ispurified, a hole is formed in the centre through which purity, light and knowledge flow fromBrahman.A goldsmith converts 10 carat gold into 15 carat gold by adding acids and burning it severaltimes in the crucible. Even so, you will have to purify your sensuous mind through concentrationand reflection on the words of your spiritual preceptor and the Upanishadic sentences, meditation,Japa or silent repetition of the Name of the Lord, etc.It takes a long time to purify Harital (yellow oxide of arsenic orpiment). It has to be soakedin cowís urine for seven days, in lime water for ten days and in milk for seven days. Then it has to beburnt out hundred and eight times before a Bhasma or proper oxide (ash) is obtained. Even so, ittakes a long time to effect Chitta-Suddhi, purity of mind. Severe Tapascharya (austerity) is needed.As a result of purification of the mind, it becomes more sensitive, gets easily disturbed by asound or shock and feels any pressure acutely. An aspirant must be sensitive and yet have the bodyand nerves completely under his control. The greater the sensitiveness becomes, the more difficultis the task; there are many noises which pass unheeded by an ordinary person, but which are tortureto one who is very sensitive. You must do your best to get over this oversensitiveness.INITIATION OF PURE MIND LEADS TO QUIESCENCEPurification is the first part of Yoga. When purification is over, the natural tendency of themind is to go towards liberation, Moksha. If only a disciple whose mind is cleansed of all itsimpurities, is initiated into the sacred mysteries by a Guru, then his mind will get completequiescence. He will enter into a Nirvikalpa state. The Nirvikalpa state is termed Asamvedana.41MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Chapter 11VRITTISVRITTIóITS NATURE AND FUNCTIONVritti means a whirl-pool. It is a wave of thought that arises in the Antahkarana. Vrittis aremodifications of the mind. They are the effect of Avidya. When Avidya is destroyed by Jnana,Vrittis get absorbed in Brahman (Laya), just as water thrown in a heated pan is absorbed in the pan.Wherefrom does a Vritti arise? From the Chitta or mind. Why does a Vritti arise? It isSvabhava of Antahkarana. What is its function? It causes Avarana-Bhanga (removes the veil ofSthula Avidya that envelops the objects). It helps the evolution of a man till he attains perfection(Jivanmukti). It is Vritti that opens the Kundalini in a Jnani in the Ajna Chakra and joins it inSahasrara. This is one path.The Chitta is the mind stuff. It is the mental substance. Vritti or thought-wave is amodification of that mental substance. It is a process. Just as waves and bubbles arise from thesurface of the ocean, so also these Vrittis arise from the surface of the mind-ocean. Just as raysemanate from the sun, so also these mental rays (modification of Vrittis) emanate from themind-sun. Just as the sun merges itself in the horizon at sunset by collecting all its rays, so also youwill have to merge in that Sun of suns, Absolute Consciousness, Eternal Peace by collecting all thedissipated mental rays and dissolving the mind itself.The function of a Vritti in the mind is to cause Avarana-Bhanga (removal of the veil ofignorance covering objects). Sthula Avidya or gross ignorance is enveloping all objects. When theveil is removed, perception of objects becomes possible. The Vritti removes the Avarana or layer ofignorance. When you pass through a big crowd or persons, you are able to notice a few persons.You do not see some persons, though they happen to come in front of you. Why? Because there wasnot complete Avarana-Bhanga. When this is done, the object shines before you.According to Raja Yoga of Maharshi Patanjali, Pramana (right notion or right proof),Viparyaya (misconception), Vikalpa (fancy or imagination), Nidra (sleep) and Smriti (memory) arethe five mental Vrittis or mental functions. If these five mental functions are suppressed, thesuppression of desires and other functions will follow.VISHAYAKARA VRITTI AND BRAHMAKARA VRITTIThrough its own efforts, the mind assumes the shape of any object, it concentrates itselfupon. If it thinks of a woman, it assumes the shape of a woman. This is termed Vritti Tadakara. If itthinks of God or Brahman, Brahmakara Vritti develops. In the former case, Rajas (passion) will beinfused into the mind; while in the latter, Sattva (purity) will be infused.When the mind thinks of objects and dwells on them, it assumes the shape of those objects.It is termed as Vishayakara Vritti. When it thinks of Brahman or Infinity, the Brahmakara Vritti is42SUDDHA MANAS AND ASUDDHA MANAS"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"formed. The Sadhaka should be very vigilant and circumspect in watching the mind and itsactivities. He must convert Vishayakara Vritti into Brahmakara Vritti. As soon as the mind dropsdown from Brahmakara Vritti into Vishayakara Vritti, he should again make the mind assumeBrahmakara Vritti. There is very hard struggle, indeed.You cannot have Vishayakara Vritti as Ghatapatadi Vritti (modification of pot, cloth, etc.)and Brahmakara Vritti (thought of Brahman) also at the same time. It is Sruti Virodha (i.e. againstthe utterances of the Srutis). It is against practical experience also.It is not the object that binds you. It is Vritti and identification (Tadatmya Sambandha) withthe Vritti that causes attachment and bondage. It is through Avidya or ignorance that you identifyyourself with Vritti as, for instance, when you say: ìI am angry.îKINDS OF VRITTIVrittis have been classified into five kinds: (1) Mano-Vritti, (2) Buddhi Vritti, (3) SakshiVritti, (4) Akhandakara Vritti and (5) Akhanda Ekarasa Vritti. No. 1 belongs to the instinctivemind. Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 5 belong to the Sattvic mind. Mano-Vritti is the Vishayakara Vritti ofworldlings. Buddhi Vritti belongs to Vivekins. When you identify yourself with the Sakshi Vritti,you can witness the modifications of the mind. When you try to feel that you are the Infinite Self,the Akhandakara Vritti is generated. It is also known as Brahmakara Vritti. There is no Vritti inBrahman.From Mano-Vritti, you must jump to Viveka Vritti. Mano-Vritti concerns ManomayaKosha. Viveka Vritti belongs to Vijnanamaya Kosha. By developing the Vijnanamaya Kosha,Mano-Vrittis are conquered. From Viveka Vritti, you must jump to Sakshi Vritti. From SakshiVritti, you must jump to Akhandakara Vritti. From Akhandakara Vritti, you must jump to AkhandaEkarasa which is Brahma Svarupa. This is Kaivalya or final goal of life.ANTARMUKHA VRITTI AND BAHIRMUKHA VRITTIWhen the outgoing tendencies of the mind are arrested, when the mind is retained within theheart, when all its attention is turned on itself alone, that condition is Antarmukha Vritti. TheAntarmukha Vritti is the indrawing energy of the mind owing to increase in Sattva. The Sadhakacan do a lot of Sadhana when he has this inward Vritti.The Bahirmukha Vritti is the outgoing tendency of the mind due to Rajas. When the visionis turned outward, the rush of fleeting events engages the mind. The outgoing energies of the mindbegin to play. Further, on account of force of habit, the ears and eyes at once run towards sound andsight. Objects and desire are externalising forces. A Rajasic man full of desires can never dream ofan inner spiritual life with Antarmukha Vritti. He is absolutely unfit for the practice ofintrospection.You will get Antarmukha Vritti (inward-moving mind) only after you have destroyed all theexternalising powers of the mind. Vairagya and introspection help a lot in the attainment of thismental state. You must starve the mind by Vairagya and Tyaga (renunciation of desires, objects and43MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"egoism). You must learn the art of making the mind introspective or turned inward upon itselfthrough the Yogic Kriya, Pratyahara (abstraction). Just as you have to take back with care yourcloth that is fallen on a thorny plant by removing the thorns one by one slowly, so also you will haveto collect back with care and exertion the dissipated rays of the mind that are thrown over thesensual objects for very many years.You will have to gather them patiently through Vairagya and Abhyasa, through Tyaga(renunciation) and Tapas and then march boldly with indefatigable energy towards God orBrahman. Those who know this practice can really be peaceful. They only can be really happy.When the mental rays are concentrated, illumination begins. Mind cannot do any havoc now. Themind cannot externalise itself. It can be kept inside the Hridaya-Guha (cave of the heart).DESTRUCTION OF VRITTIS LEADS TO MENTAL STRENGTHMind gains great strength when the Vrittis are destroyed. It is not easy to destroy Vrittis(thought-waves) because they are innumerable. They should be taken up one by one and dealt withseparately. Some Vrittis are very strong. They demand strong efforts for their destruction. Most ofthe Vrittis are very weak. Weak Vrittis melt away like rent clouds. Strong thoughts remain andfrequently recur daily in the morning as soon as you rise from your bed.Be silent. Enter silence. Silence is Atman. Silence is Brahman. Silence is centre. Silence isthe Hridaya-Guha (heart-cave). When the mind runs from one object to another, that state in theinterval wherein you become mindless for a very short time is Svarupasthiti. That is Brahman.When the mind is controlled fully, Vrittis cease. When all the modifications subside, you enter intothe silence then and then alone. Realise this, this very moment. Feel the divine glory and Brahmicsplendour now by closing the eyes, by drawing the Indriyas, by stilling the mind, by silencing thethoughts, by sharpening the intellect, by purifying the Chitta, by meditating on Om, by chantingOm with Bhava (feeling). Keep up the continuity of Brahmic consciousness throughout the 24hours. Have an unceasing flow of Atmic consciousness. This is very, very important. This is asinequa non.This is a great desideratum.When all the Vrittis die, Samskaras and the frame of the mind remain. Samskaras can onlybe fried up by Nirbija-Samadhi.44VRITTIS"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Chapter 12THEORY OF PERCEPTIONìWhen one thinks, then he understands; without having thought, one does not know; it is onlyafter having thought that one understands.î(Chhandogya Upanishad, VII-xxi-1)ìI was absent-minded; I did not hear. I was absent-minded; I did not see. It is thus evident that aperson sees with the mind, hears with the mind. Desire, determination, uncertainty, belief,disbelief, steadiness, unsteadiness, shame, intellect, fearóall these are in the mind alone.Therefore, when touched from behind, a person knows by the mind.(Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, I-v-3)There are two compartments in the mind, viz., the thinking portion and the perceivingportion. It is easy to stop the thinking portion, but it is extremely difficult to stop the functioning ofthe perceiving portion.It is only the individual mind that sees objects outside. If you see the same objects through atelsecope, they appear different. If you can see with the mind directly, you will have a differentvision altogether. Hiranyagarbha or Karya Brahman has quite a different vision. He sees everythingas a vibration or movement within himself as his own Sankalpa, just as you can imagine within yourown mind that a big war is going on and many people are dying on either side. You withdraw yourimagination at your will.THEORIES OF PERCEPTIONThere is the elastic theory of the mind. This school of thought says that the mind becomeselastic when several objects come in contact with the various senses and thus puts itselfsimultaneously into touch with various sense-organs or Indriyas of knowledge (Jnana-Indriyas).When the mind comes in contact with one object and one Indriya, it contracts to a point. This theoryis exploded and refuted by the Vedantins as unsound.There is another school of thought that says that there are different compartments or parts inthe mind. One part of the mind connects itself with one sense (Indriya), another part with a secondsense and so on. This theory is similarly blown up and discarded by the Vedantins as untenable andunsound.According to the school of thought known by the name of Drishti-Srishti-Vada, theperceiver and the perceived are one. Just as the spider weaves out the web from its own body, evenso the mind throws out this physical universe from its own body during waking state and withdrawsthe world into its womb during sleep. An object is a mental Vritti externalised or objectified.The Drishya (what you see outside) is due to mental Avidya. There is only light outside.There is only vibration outside. It is the mind that gives colour and shape. It is all mental deception.This is one view. This is one theory of perception.45MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"The interaction between the mind inside and the Tanmatric vibrations outside is the objector the world that you see outside. This is one theory of perception. Mind is formed out of the Sattvicportion of the five Tanmatras. There is light outside. The sun also emits light. The eye is made up offire or Agni-Tattva. That portion of the mind which perceives is also made up of Agni-Tattva. Sofire sees fire. Only that portion of the mind which is made up of Sabda-Tanmatra can hear. Soundcomes from Akasa outside. So Akasa of the mind hears Akasa from outside. But, Atman can see,hear, taste and feel everything. Atman only can be seen by Atman. Therefore, whatever you seeoutside is Atman only.ìSarvam Khalvidam BrahmaóEverything is verily Brahman.îTHE VIEW OF WESTERN MEDICAL SCIENCEAccording to western medical science, light-vibrations from outside strike the retina and aninverted image is formed there. These vibrations are carred through optic tract and optic thalamus tothe centre of vision in the occipital lobe of the brain in the back part of the head. There, a positiveimage is formed. Then only, you see the object in front of you.PERCEPTION ACCORDING TO SANKHYA PHILOSOPHYAccording to Sankhya philosophy, the real back-ground of perception is the Purusha ofwhom the western doctors and psychologists have no idea. Fleshy eyes are only externalinstruments (Karanas) for perception. Eye is not an organ of vision. The organ of vision is a centresituated in the brain; so is the case with all senses. Mind is connected with the Indriyas, the Indriyaswith the corresponding centres in brain and the centres, with the physical organs, to the externalobject. The mind presents the sensation to Buddhi; Buddhi takes it to the Purusha (which is pureSpirit, which is Immaterial). Now, real perception takes place. Purusha gives order to Buddhi.Then, Buddhi, after proper decision and judgment and after taking into consideration the pros andcons of the subject on hand, gives orders back to the mind, for execution through the motor centres(Karma-Indriyas or organs of action). Buddhi is the Prime Minister and Judge who hears thestatements of the Advocate, viz., the mind. Mind plays two parts, viz., (i) that of an Advocate and(ii) that of a Commander-in-Chief. After receiving decisive orders from Buddhi, the mind acts thepart of a Commander-in-Chief and executes the orders of Buddhi through the five soldiers, the fiveKarma-Indriyas. This is the theory of perception according to the Sankhya Philosophy. See howvery clear matters are in Hindu Philosophy.First of all, there is the instrument or Karanaófor instance, the fleshy eye. It takes thesense-impressions to the centre or Indriya. The mind is then connected with the centre and theexternal instruments, namely, the physical eye, ear, etc. The mind carries the impressions stillfurther and presents them to the Buddhi, the determinative faculty, which reacts. Then flashes outthe idea of egoism or Ahankara, which self-arrogates and identfies with Abhimana. Then themixture of action and reaction is presented to the Purusha, the real Soul who perceives an object inthe mixture.Knowledge comes through contact with objects(Indriyartha-Sannikarsha). To know aPrapancha Vishaya, Indriya, Antahkarana and Jiva are required. Indriya will see the Vishaya. Mindwill make it appear. Buddhi, with the help of Abhasa Chaitanya, will understand it. Mind, sensesand the Karanas (external instruments) such as the physical eye, ear, etc., should all be joined46THEORY OF PERCEPTION"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"together. Then only perception of an object is possible. The object comes in contact with thesenses. The senses are linked to the mind. The mind is connected to the Atman. The Atmanillumines. This is with reference to the physical plane.THE VEDANTIC THEORYAccording to the Advaitic theory of perception, it is the Chaitanya within us that makesperception possible. The Chetana within us unites with the Chetana in the object and the result isperception. It does not follow from this that the mind and the senses are useless. The senses arenecessary for the adaptation of perception to their approximate things. From the soulís essentialnature being intelligence, it does not follow that the senses are useless, for they serve the purpose ofdetermining the special object of each sense.The Vedantic theory of perception is that the mind comes out through the eye and assumesthe shape of the object outside. The Antahkarana-Vritti enters through the opening of the Indriya(eye), removes Vishaya Ajnana, assumes Vishayakara (the shape and form of the object itenvelops), presents the objects to your view. The function of Vritti is to cause Avarana-Bhanga(removal of the veil or layer of Sthula Avidya that envelops all objects).A ray of the mind actually goes out, assumes the shape and form of the object and envelopsit. Then only perception takes place. The perception of a book is possible only when the mind hasassumed the actual shape of the book. Mental image plus external something is the object.Whatever objects you see outside, have got their own images in the mind.When you pass through a mango garden, a ray of the mind comes out through the eye andenvelops a mango. It assumes the shape of the mango. The ray is termed Vritti. The envelopingprocess is called Vritti-Vyapti. The function of a Vritti is to remove the Avarana (veil) that envelopsthe object and the Upahita Chaitanya. The veil that envelops the mango is removed by the Vritti orthe mental ray. There is Chaitanya associated with the Vritti (Vritti Sahita Chaitanya). ThisChaitanya illuminates the object ëmangoí. This is termed Phala-Vyapti. Just as a torchlightillumines an object in a flash, this Vritti-Chaitanya illumines the object. Then only does perceptionof the mango take place. Mind makes Sankalpa-Vikalpa: Is this a mango or not? Buddhi comes tohelp the mind and determines (this is a mango) through previous experience. Chitta makesAnusandhana (enquiry): ìHow can I get the mango? May I ask the gardener or the proprietor?îAhankara asserts: ìI must get the mango anyhow. I want it.î Then the command is given by themind to the Karma-Indriyas for execution.When you see a mango tree, it is external to you. There is externality. The mango tree is amental percept. It is a mental concept also. There is no mango tree apart from the mind. You knowthe existence of the tree through the mind only. There is a mental image in the mind. The image inthe mind plus the external something is the mango tree. Even if you close your eyes, you can get atthe image through memory. The green colour of the leaves is due to a certain rate of light vibrations(say, 10 millions of vibrations). These light vibrations strike at the retina and are taken to the visioncentre at the back of the brain. The mango-leaves have the power to split the white rays and absorbthe green colour only. So says science.47MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Your body also is as much external to you as that yonder mango tree. It is also a mentalpercept or mental concept. The mango tree is external to you with reference to your body only. Themango tree itself is a mere appearance that floats in the Absolute or the One Reality. As the mangotree is external to you from the standpoint of your body, and as the body itself is external to you, theidea of externality of the mango tree or this external universe is blown up now. The term internalityalso has a false existence only. There is internality only with reference to the externality. If theexternality goes away, where is the internality? Both the terms internality and externality are mereillusions, creations of the mind. There is only the solid existence, the One Reality or Absolutebehind the so-called internality and externality. That is the Real, Infinite ëIí. That is your own Self.MIND ALONE CREATES DIFFERENCESThe eyes present before the mind some forms or images. It is the mind that creates good andbad forms. It says, ìThis is good. This is ugly. This is beautiful.î Here comes bondage and trouble.Good and bad, ugly and beautiful are pure mental creations. If mind can create, it can destroy also.Similarly, the ears bring some sound vibrations before the mind. It is the mind that says: ìThis ispraise. This is censure.î Eyes and ears are not to be blamed at all. They are innocent. Mind causesthe mischief.MENTAL COGNITION TAKES PLACE SERIALLYMind can think of only limited things. Mind cannot think of greenness without thinking of agreen object.Mind is Niravayava (without parts, divisions, compartments). It can have only one idea at atime. This is the Siddhanta of Naiyayikas. Even those Vedantins who say that mind is Savayava(with compartments) on the analogy of Chora-Nari (the prostitute whose mind is on the paramoureven while she works in her house) admit that the mind can have Visesha Vritti of the lover only andSamanya Vritti of the work on hand at the time.The human mind has the power of attending to only one object at a time, although it is ableto pass from one object to another with a marvellous degree of speed, so rapidly in fact, that somehace held that it could grasp several things at a time. Mind is a gate-keeper or guard who can allowonly one person, one kind of sense-vibration at a time into the mental factory. You cannot hear andsee at the same time. The mind can have only one idea at a time. But it moves with such tremendouslightning speed that an ordinary man thinks that he can have several ideas at a time.Perception through the finite mind or cognition or experience takes place serially and notsimultaneousely. Simultaneous knowledge can only be had in Nirvikalpa Samadhi where past andfuture merge in the present. Only a Yogin will have simultaneous knowledge. A man of the worldwith a finite mind can have only a knowledge in succession. Two thoughts, however closely relatedto each other, cannot exist at the same time. The nature of the internal organism (Antahkarana orManas) prevents our having more than one aspect of an object at each instant presented toconsciousness. Though several objects may come in contact simultaneously with the differentsense-organs, yet the mind acts like a gatekeeper who can admit only one person at a time through48THEORY OF PERCEPTION"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"the gate. The mind can send only one kind of sensation at a time into the mental factory inside forthe manufacture of a decent percept and a nice concept.When the mind gives attention and is attached to the sense of sight, it can only see. It cannothear. It cannot hear and see at the same time. It is everybodyís daily experience. When your mind iswholly absorbed in deep study of some interesting book, you cannot hear even if a man shouts,because the mind was not there (with the sense of hearing). ìMy mind was elsewhere, I did not see;my mind was elsewhere, I did not hear, for man sees with his mind and hears with his mind.îBrihadaranyaka Upanishad, I-v-3). When you seriously think of a problem, you can neither see norhear nor feel. All the Indriyas are detached from the mind. There is only the process ofAnusandhana (enquiry or investigation) by the Chitta (the mental substance).The best philosophers and seers, Rishis and sages, the best authorities, Eastern and Western,hold to the ìSingle Ideaî theory as being correct. They are unanimously agreed that the mind cannotactually attend to more than one thing at a time, but when it appears to be doing so, it is only movingwith prodigious rapidity backward and forward, from one end to the other. Illiterate people say thatthey can see and hear at the same time. The mind moves with a tremendous velocity backward andforward and people imagine that mind can do two things at a time. It is a sad mistake. A spark oflight presents the appearance of a continuous circle of light if it is made to rotate rapidly. Even so,though the mind can attend to only one thing at a timeóeither hearing or seeing or smellingó,though it can admit only one kind of sensation at a time, yet we are led to believe that it does severalactions simultaneously, because it moves from one object to another with tremendous velocity, sorapidly that its successive attention and perception appear as a simultaneous activity.COMPENSATORY ADVANTAGE IN SENSE PERCEPTIONIn some persons, the sense of hearing is more developed than the sense of sight. Judges haveacute hearing. Commanders-in-chief have acute sight. The profession itself forces them to developthe particular sense. Blind people have acute sense of hearing. If one Indriya is defective, naturecompensates by developing more another Indriya. One of my friends knows of a blind man who canfeel the nature of the colour by mere touch.Speech is even the sight of the Purusha. Speech means here sound, the object of the sense ofhearing. When this sense is enlightened, reflection is produced in the mind. By the mind effort toobtain external thing is made; for by the mind one sees, one hears. When one, at a time at night in thedark, cannot distinguish where sound arises (be it the neighing of horses or the braying of donkeysor the barking of dogs), he resorts there whence speech proceeds.SUPERSENSORY PERCEPTIONIt is the mind that really sees, tastes, smells, hears and feels. When you begin to think of thepicture of Lord Krishna with closed eyes, it is through the mindís eye that you see the picture.An occultist can dispense with his physical, fleshy eyes and can see directly with his mind.A Bhakta (devotee), being one with Isvara (Lord), sees directly with the eye of Isvara (with the eye49MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"of Karana-Sarira, seed-body). A Jnanin sees with the eye of Knowledge of Atman (Divya Drishti orJnana-Chakshus).HOW BRAHMAN PERCEIVESIn the mind, will and sight are separate. In pure Chit, will and seeing are one; will and sightare combined and no longer, as in the case of mind, separated from each other.Brahman does not need Antahkarana to sense, think and reason. Brahman does not needeyes to see. He is self-luminous. He gives light to everything. He imparts light to Antahkarana. Hegives light and power to the Indriyas. He is Chit-Svarupa. He is Chidghana. He is a mass ofknowledge. He knows everything through Self-knowledge. He sees within Himself throughSelf-knowledge the whole universe as His own Sankalpa, as Vivarta.HOW TO PERCEIVE BRAHMANBrahman is not an object or Vishaya. It is to be felt by Sakshatkara (direct spiritualcognition). Knowledge of Brahman (Existence or Truth Absolute) comes through feeling andmeditation (spiritual Anubhava, direct perception or Atma-sakshatkara) wherein the seer, sight andseen merge into the one existence like the bubble in the ocean.Chapter 13CHITTA AND MEMORYWHAT IS CHITTA?Chitta is termed as the mind-stuff or mental substance. It is the groundfloor, as it were. Fromit proceed the three Vrittis, viz., Manas, Buddhi and Ahankara. This word belongs to the Rajayogicterminology of Maharshi Patanjali. Also in the Gita, Lord Krishna uses the term Chitta in variousplaces.Chitta is a separate faculty or category in Vedanta. Sometimes it is Antargata, comes underMind. In Sankhya philosophy, it is included in Buddhi or Mahat-Tattva. The Chitta of PatanjaliRishiís philosophy of Raja Yoga (Yogas-chittavritti-nirodhah) corresponds to the Antahkarana ofVedanta.Subconscious mind is termed ëChittaí in Vedanta. Much of your subconsciousness consistsof submerged experiences, memories thrown into the background but recoverable. The Chitta islike a calm lake and thoughts are like waves upon the surface of this lake and name and form are thenormal ways in which these waves rise. No wave can rise without name and form.50THEORY OF PERCEPTION"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"The functions of the Chitta are Smriti or Smarana, Dharana, attention and Anusandhana(enquiry or investigation). When you repeat the Japa of a Mantra, it is the Chitta that does theSmarana. It does a lot of work. It turns out better work than the mind or Buddhi.THE FIELD OF SUBCONSCIOUS MENTATIONThe mental processes are not limited to the field of consciousness alone. The field ofsubconscious mentation is of a much greater extent than that of conscious mentation. The mind isnot conscious of the greater portion of its own activities. As man can hold in consciousness but onefact at a time, only a fraction of our knowledge can be in the field of consciousness at any onemoment. Only ten per cent of mental activities come into the field of consciousness. Ninety per centof the mental activities takes place in the subconscious mind. Messages, when ready, come out likea flash from the subconscious mind to the surface of the conscious mind through the trapdoor in thesubconscious mind.We sit and try to solve a problem and fail. We walk around, try again and again fail.Suddenly an idea dawns on us that leads to the solution of the problem. The subconscious processeswere at work.You repeatedly fail at night to get the solution for a problem in arithmetic or geometry. Inthe morning, when you wake up, you get a clear answer. This answer comes like a flash from thesubconscious mind. Even in sleep, it works incessantly without any rest. It arranges, classifies,compares, sorts all facts and works out a proper, satisfactory solution.Sometimes, you go to sleep at 10 p.m. with the thought, ìI must get up at 2 a.m. in themorning to catch a train.î This message is taken up by the subconscious mind and it is thissubconscious mind that wakes you up unfailingly at the exact hour. Subconscious mind is yourconstant, trustworthy companion and sincere friend.With the help of the subconscious mind, you can change your vicious nature by cultivatinghealthy, virtuous qualities that remain dormant in every human heart. If you want to overcome fear,mentally deny that you have fear and concentrate your attention upon the opposite quality, the idealof courage. When courage is developed, fear vanishes by itself. The positive always overpowers thenegative. This is an infallible law of nature. This is Pratipaksha Bhavana of Raja Yogins. You canacquire a liking for distasteful tasks and duties by cultivating a desire and taste for them. You canestablish new habits, new ideals, new ideas anad new tastes and new character in the subconsciousmind by changing the old ones.MEMORYSmriti or memory is a function of Chitta (subconscious mind). Memory is used in twosenses. We say, ìMr. John has got a good memory.î Here it means that Mr. Johnís capacity of themind to store up its past experiences is very good. Sometimes we say, ìI have no memory of thatincident.î Here, you cannot bring up to the surface of the conscious mind, in its original form, theincident that took place some years ago. It is an act of remembering. You do not get any newknowledge through memory. It is only a reproduction.51MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"If the experience is fresh, you can have a complete recall of your past experience throughmemory. In ordinary recollection there is a temporal coefficient. In personal memory there is aspecific coefficient. That which acts together with another thing is a coefficient. In Mathematics,the numerical or literal factor prefixed to an unkown quantity in an algebraic term is a coefficient.HOW DOES MEMORY ARISESuppose you have received a nice fan as a present from your amiable friend. When you usethe fan, it sometimes reminds you of your friend. You think of him for a Smriti-Hetu (cause ofmemory).If your brother is a tall man, the sight of a similar tall man in another place will bring to yourmind the memory of your brother. This is memory due to the similarity of objects (Sadrisyata).Suppose you have seen a dwarf at Madras. When you see a very tall man or Patagonian, thiswill remind you of the dwarf whom you saw at Madras. The sight of a big palace will remind you ofa peasantís hut or a Sannyasinís grass hut on the bank of Ganga. This memory is due to dissimilarityin objects (Viparitata).When you walk along the road on a stormy day, if you happen to see a fallen tree, youconclude that the tree has fallen owing to the storm. In this case, the memory is due to the relationbetween cause and effect (Karya-karana-sambandha).The new Samskaras wash away the old Samskaras. If the Samskaras are fresh and recent, itis easy to recall them back quickly. They come up again from the depths of the subconscious mindto the surface of the conscious mind. Revival of old Samskaras takes place. If you visit once thecollege wherefrom you received your education, ten years after you became an officer in theGovernment, all the previous Samskaras of your college days will be revived now. You willremember now your old professors, old friends, old books and various other things.CHARACTERISTICS OF A GOOD MEMORYThe following are the four good characteristics of a good memory: (1) If you read once apassage and if you can reproduce the same nicely, it is a sign to indicate that you have a very goodmemory. This is termed Sugamata. (2) If you can reproduce the same thing without increase ordecrease, addition or substraction, it is called Avaikalya. (3) If you can preserve a fact or passage oranything for a very considerable period, it is called Dharana (retentive memory). (4) If you canreproduce a passage at once without any difficulty when it is needed, it is called Upaharana.THE PROCESS OF RECOLLECTIONWhen you desire to remember a thing, you will have to make a psychic exertion. You willhave to go up and down into the depths of the different levels of subconsciousness and then pick upthe right thing from a curious mixture of multifarious irrelevant matter. Just as the railway sorter inthe Railway Mail Service takes up the right letter by moving the hand up and down along thedifferent pigeon-holes, so also the sorter subconscious mind goes up and down along the52CHITTA AND MEMORY"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"pigeon-holes in the subconscious mind and brings the right thing to the level of normalconsciousness. The subconscious mind can pick up the right thing from a heap of various matters.In a big surgical clinic, the assistant surgeon allows only one patient to enter theconsultation room of the senior surgeon for examination. Even so, the mind allows one idea only toenter the mental factory at a time through the mind door (Manodvara). The subconscious mindbrings to the threshold of the conscious mind, during an act of Smriti (memory), the right thing atthe right moment, suppressing all others. It serves the part of a censor and allows only relevantmemories to pass by. What a wonderful mechanism it is! Who is the driver for these dual minds?Who created these? What a magnanimous Being He must be! My hairs stand on their ends when Ithink of Him! My pen quivers when I write. Donít you like to dwell with Him? What a greatprivilege and joy it is to be in communion with Him!When you try to remember something, sometimes you cannot remember. After some time,the forgotten something flashes out to the conscious mind. How do you explain this? It is a slip ofmemory. The Samkaras of the particular thing has sunk deep. The Chitta, which is the storehouse ofSamskaras (and whose function is memory), has to exert a bit, to analyse and sort and bring it to thesurface of the conscious mind through the trapdoor. After some exertion, revival of the oldSamskaras takes place and the forgotten idea, or name of a person, which you wished to recollectsometime back, suddenly flashes to the conscious or objective mind. There ought to have beensome congestion in the brain, which might have prevented the revival of a forgotten thing, idea orperson. As soon as the congestion is relieved, the forgotten idea floats on the surface of the mind.When the mind is calm, memory becomes keen.POWER OF MEMORYThose who overwork mentally, who do not observe the rules of Brahmacharya and who aretormented by many cares, worries and anxieties, lose their power of memory soon. When you showsymptoms of losing your memory, as you grow old, the first symptom is that you find it difficult toremember the names of persons. The reason is not far to seek. All the names are arbitrary. They arelike labels. There are no associations with the names. The mind generally remembers throughassociations, as the impressions become deep thereby.Even in old age, you can remember old events, as there are associations with events. Youcan remember well in old age some passages that you read in schools and colleges. But, you find itdifficult to remember in the evening a new passage you read in the morning. The reason is that themind has lost its Dharana Sakti (power of grasping ideas). The brain cells have degenerated.In early boyhood, the power of grasping in the mind is very marked. But, there is no powerof understanding. In 16, 18, 20, the power of understanding becomes manifest. The power ofretentive memory is also great in this age. The mind becomes settled only after 30. Below 30, thereis much Chanchalatva (wandering nature). A man below 30óin the vast majority of casesóis notable to think and decide for himself. He has no power of judgment. After 45, power of graspingbegins to decline. Memory also begins to decline. He has power of retention for what he has learntbefore. He cannot learn new sciences. Brahmacharya helps a lot to develop the power of retentionand various other psychic powers.53MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Chapter 14SAMSKARASWHAT IS SAMSKARA?Vritti (whirlpool, thought-wave) arises in the mind-ocean. It operates for sometime. Then itsinks below the threshold of normal consciousness. From the surface of the conscious mindwherein it was uppermost for some time, it sinks down deep into the region of the subconsciousmind (Chitta). There, it continues to be a subliminal action and becomes a Samskara (impression).A conscious action-whether cognitive, affective or conativeóassumes a potential and hidden(Sukshma and Avyakta) form just below the threshold of consciousness. This is termed a Samskara.MEMORYóA REVIVAL OF SAMSKARAThe Samskaras (impressions) are embedded in the subconscious mind or Chitta. Thesubconscious mind is otherwise known as the unconscious mind. Subjective mind, subconsciousmind, unconscious mind and Chitta are synonymous terms. The seat of this subconscious mind isthe cerebellum or hindbrain. You can recall the past experiences from the storehouse of Samskarasin the subconscious mind. The past is preserved even to the minutest detail. Even a bit is never lost.When the fine Samskaras come up to the surface of the conscious mind back again as a big wave,when the past Vritti comes back to the surface of the conscious mind again by recollection, it iscalled memory or Smriti. No memory is possible without the help of Samskara.HOW THE SAMSKARA IS FORMEDAn experience in the sense-plane sinks down into the depths of the subconscious mind(Chitta) and becomes there a ëSamskaraí (impression). A Samskara of an experience is formed ordeveloped in the Chitta at the very moment that the mind is experiencing something. There is no gapbetween the present experience and the formation of a Samskara in the subconscious mind. Aspecific experience leaves a specific Samskara. The memory of this specific experience springsfrom that particular Samskara only, which was formed out of that particular experience.When you perceive an orange and taste for the first time, you get knowledge of an orange.You know its taste. You know the object, orange. A Samskara is formed in the subconscious mindat once. At any time, this Samskara can generate a memory of the object, orange and knowledge ofan orange. Though the object and the act of knowledge are distinguishable, yet they are inseparable.CYCLIC CAUSATION OF THOUGHT AND SAMSKARAAn object awakens or revives Samskaras in the mind through external stimuli. Hence, aSankalpa or thought arises subjectively from within, without a stimulus from outside. When youthink of a cow which you have seen before, you repeat the word ëcowí mentally. Then only, themental image comes. Then, a thought is formed. Samskara causes Sankalpa, and Sankalpa causesSamskara, just as seed is the cause of the tree, and tree is the cause of the seed, in turn. There is54CHITTA AND MEMORY"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"cyclic causation on the analogy of seed and tree (Bija-Vriksha-Nyaya). A Vritti in the mindproduces a Samskara, and a Samskara, in turn, causes again a Vritti. Owing to the force of stimuli(Udbodhaka, Vyanjaka) either from within or from without, the seed-like Samskaras again expandand give rise to further activities. This cycle of Vritti and Samskara is Anadi (beginningless), buthas an end when one attains Divine Knowledge and liberation. They get Laya (dissolution) intoPrakriti. They cease to produce any effect on the Jivanmukta. The Samskaras should be fried up bycontinuous Samadhi. Then only you will be free from births and deaths.SAMYAMA OVER SAMSKARASSamskara is known as ìresidual potencyî also. When all Vrittis or thoughts die away, theframe of the mind remains with the Samskaras. This is termed the Potential Mind. In Vedanticparlance, it is called Antahkarana Matra.All Samskaras co-exist in the mind. The Vrittis slowly subside and leave traces in the mind.These traces are the Samskaras. From these Samskaras springs memory. If you have Yogic vision,you can vividly notice the marvels that take place in the mental factory of an individual, how theVritti arises in the mind-lake, how it subsides and how a Samskara is formed. You will be struckwith wonder. Samyama over these Samskaras brings out the direct knowledge of the residualpotencies. A Yogin brings into direct consciousness the previous life-states by getting directknowledge of their Samskaras. Such knowledge can hardly be acquired in Universities. A Yoginalone can impart this knowledge to deserving aspirants.VIRTUOUS AND VICIOUS SAMSKARASLike forces, Samskaras aid or inhibit one another. When you see a man in serious sicknessand when the feeling of mercy arises in your heart, all the Samskaras of your previous mercifulactions coalesce together and force you to serve and help that sick man. Similarly, all the Samskarasof charitable actions come forth to the surface of the conscious mind when you see a man in aserious distress and in straitened circumstances and they force you to help this man. You begin toshare with him your physical possessions.When one Samskara or virtuous action comes into play, another Samskara of dissimilarnature may emerge out and come in the way of its fulfilment. This is fight between a virtuous and avicious Samskara.When you try to fix your mind on God and think of purity, just at that moment, all evilthoughts and Samskaras burst forth with violence and vengeance to fight against you. This istermed ëcrowding of Samskarasí. Good Samskaras also crowd together and help you to drive outevil Samskaras. The father of Sri Swami Advaitanandaji was a great Bhakta of Chandi. At the timeof his death, he was semi-conscious. He began to repeat all the Slokas of Chandi-Stotra which hehad got by heart while he was young. This is ëcrowding of spiritual Samskarasí.55MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"PAST SAMSKARAS CONSTITUTE PRARABDHAWhen you are born, the mind is not a mereTabula Rasa(a smooth or blank tablet or a blanksheet of white paper). It is a storehouse of Samskaras, predispositions, predilections, etc. A child isborn with his Samskaras. A child is born with his past experiences transmuted into mental andmoral tendencies and powers. By experiences, pleasant and painful, man gathers materials andbuilds them into mental and moral faculties. The earthly experiences are worked up into intellectualfaculty. The mind evolves through the impressions received from the universe through the senses. Itwill take many bodies till it gathers the complete experience of the world. Every man is born withhis inborn or inherent Samskaras and these Samskaras are embedded, lodged or imprinted in theChitta which is the seat for Prarabdha. In earthly life, he gains many more Samskaras or experiencesthrough actions and these are added to the original store and become the future Sanchita Karmas(accumulated actions).All Samskaras lie dormant in the Chitta as latent activities, not only of this life but of allprevious innumerable lives from Anadi Kala (beginningless time). The Samskaras of animal life(those of dogís births, etc.), the Samskaras of a Deva life, the Samskaras of kingly life, theSamskaras of the life of a peasant, are all hidden there in the Chitta. In human life, only thoseSamskaras which are appropriate to that particular type of birth will operate and come to play. Theother kinds of Samskaras will remain concealed and dormant.ìAs a merchant closing the yearís ledger and opening a new one, does not enter in the newall the items of the old but only its balances, so does the spirit hand over to the new brain hisjudgments on the experiences of a life that is closed, the conclusions to which he has come, thedecisions to which he has arrived. This is the stock handed on to the new life, the mental furniturefor the new dwellingóa real memory.îKARMAThe gross body and the mind have, on account of your past Karmas, a tendency to act in acertain way and you act just in accordance with that tendency like a machine. You wrongly imputeto yourself the authorship (agency) of these actions and thus make the matters worse. Most of youractions are done more or less automatically.If you find it difficult to do your actions in a Nishkama spirit, have one desire for liberationin doing all things.In Svarga or heaven, all earthly experiences of the mind are sorted and analysed. Theessence is taken. The Jiva is born again in the physical universe with a new frame and bent of mindaccording to the nature of the essence extracted in the mental plane.When you are writing a drama, if sleep comes in, you stop writing and retire to bed. As soonas you get up, you continue to write from where you have left the previous night.

From Samskaras emanate Vasanas likeswarms of locusts. From Vasana flows the stream of desire and from enjoyment of objects ofdesires arises Trishna or internal craving (intense longing). Trishna is very powerful. TheSamskaras are imbedded in the mind, in the Karana Sarira. There arises a memory of pleasure in themind. Then the mind thinks of objects. Maya has her powerful seat in the imagination. There comesattachment. The mind plans and schemes. You are swayed by the passions. You exert yourselfphysically to possess those objects and enjoy them. In your efforts, you favour some and disfavourothers through Raga and Dvesha. You will have to enjoy the fruits of your virtuous and viciousactions. Through this six-spoked wheel of Raga and Dvesha, virtue and vice, pleasure and pain, thisSamsaric wheel of birth and death moves on without stopping from Anadi Kala (beginninglesstime).THOUGHTS AND DESIRES DEPEND UPON SAMSKARASThe nature of desires and thoughts depends upon the nature of your Samskaras. If you havegood Samskaras, you will have good desires and good thoughts and vice versa. Even if you haveindulged in vicious actions up to the age of forty, begin practising virtuous actions such as charity,Japa, Dama, Svadhyaya, meditation, service of the poor and the sick, service of saints, etc., fromthis moment and these Samskaras will prompt you to do more virtuous deeds.

Do some kind of meditation for a short time at least daily,say for half an hour in the morning and evening. Have a meditation room. Make some kind of Japaof any Mantra. Study the Gita regularly. Have Satsanga. Visit Rishikesh, Nasik, Varanasi,Haridwar, Prayag once a year for a weekís stay. Have the Darshana of Mahatmas. By doing so, youwill acquire some spiritual Samskaras which will be a valuable spiritual asset for a new, good life.You will have a very good birth. You will be placed in suitable environments in the next birth forunfolding the Divinity that is lurking in your heart, for practice of Yoga. All opportunities andfacilities will be given to you by God, through His grace (Isvara-Kripa) for your spiritual Sadhana.Even by a little systematic spiritual practice (Yogabhyasa and Vedantic Sadhana), you can changeyour mentality, your old vicious Samskaras. You can cut short several future births. By practice forthree years, you can free yourself from the clutches of births and deaths. You are bound to become aSannyasin. Why not now in this very birth? Why donít you cut short the cycle of unnecessary birthsand consequent miseries? How long do you want to be a slave of the world, a slave of passions andIndriyas? Wake up now.

But, the thoughts and Samskaras of actions, enjoyments andthinking follow you after death till you attain Moksha. These are variable Upadhis that accompanyyou after death. They are variable because you carry different kinds of Samskaras each time whenyou die. In defferent incarnations, you create different kinds of Samskaras. The permanent Upadhisthat accompany you after death are the five Jnana-Indriyas, five Karma-Indriyas, five Pranas,fourfold mind and the Karana Sarira which is the support or Adhara for the Linga Sarira or astralbody. It is the death of the Samskaras, it is the death of the Karana Sarira that leads to the finalMoksha. It leads to the attainment of Brahma-Jnana. You will be getting fresh births so long as thereare Samskaras. You will have to take birth again and again till all the Samskaras are obliterated orfried up by the acquisition of Brahma Jnana. When the Samskaras are wiped out, BrahmicKnowledge shines by itself in its own glory.SADHANA CONSISTS IN DESTROYING THE SAMSKARASThe aim of a Sadhaka is to fry out or burn or obliterate all these Samskaras through NirbijaSamadhi. Sadhana consists in wiping out the Samskaras. Breathing, hearing, seeing, feeling,tasting, smellingóall cause Samskaras or latent Smriti in the mind. The world enters the mindthrough the eyes, ears, tongue (speech) and old Samskaras. If you remain in seclusion, you can shutout the first three doors. Through Vichara (right enquiry of Supreme Self), you can destroy thefourth route. Then, Jnana (Knowledge of Self) will dawn. A Jnani is without Samskaras. They arefried out by Jnana. No doubt, the force of the Samskaras remains in the Antahkarana. But they areharmless. They will not bind the Jnani.Chapter 15SANKALPATHE OPERATION OF THOUGHTThere is the spiritual life in God. This is what relates us to the Infinite. You get everything inBrahman, as He is self-contained and Paripurna (all-full). All your wants and desires are satisfiedthere. There is then the physical life. This it is that connects us with the universe around us. Thethought-life connects the one with the other. It is this that plays between the two.We have the power within us to open or close ourselves to the divine inflow exactly as wechoose. This we have through the power of mind, through the operation of thought. If you areRajasic, you are far from God. You have shut yourself up from God. If you are Sattvic, you openyourself to the divine inflow.59MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"The sacred Ganga takes its origin in Gangotri (Himalayas) and runs perennially towardsGanga Sagar.

Even a railway engine is sent to the engine-shed for restwhen the wheels become overhot. But, this mysterious engine of mind goes on thinking without amomentís rest. The expansion of this mind alone is Sankalpa; and, Sankalpa, through its power ofdifferentiation, generates this universe.Ajnanins have fickle minds with a great deal of fluctuation and myriads of Sankalpas.

It is for evil only. Thecause of bondage is Sankalpa. It is all the Sankalpas and Vasanas which you generate that enmeshyou as in a nest.

Ahankara is the trunk. Raga and Dvesha are the two main branches. Varioussensual objects are the leaves.The individualised mind, which is full of Avidya and is all-pervading, though existing inname, has no form, either external or internal, like the Akasa permeating all space. The meremanifestation in all objects of (seeming) reality is the mind. Wherever there is Sankalpa, there doesthe mind exist.The origin and the dissolution of this universe, which is nothing but a mode ofconsciousness, take place with the complete origination and destruction of the Sankalpas of themind. Realisation of Brahman can be effected through the mind alone after abandoning itsSankalpas and Vikalpas. You should root out Sankalpa as completely as possible. This destructionof Sankalpa should be intelligently practised.ANNIHILATION OF SANKALPAS CONSTITUTES MOKSHAYou may perform Tapas for myriads of years; you may be able to travel at once through thethree worlds; but, never will you be able to reach the stainless MOKSHA, except through the firm60SANKALPA"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"path of annihilation of Sankalpas.

It is its Svabhava. Thoughts generallyflow with ease towards objects. Mental energy will readily flow in that direction. The mental forcecan easily flow in the old grooves and avenues of mundane thoughts. It finds it extremely difficult tothink of God. It is an uphill work for a Samsaric mind of Vyavahara. The difficulty in weaning themind from objects and fixing it on God is the same as in making the Ganga flow towards BadriNarayan instead of its natural flow towards Ganga Sagar. It is like rowing against the current of theYamuna. Still, through strenuous efforts and Tyaga it must be trained to flow towards God, muchagainst its will, if you want to free yourself from birth and death. There is no other go if you want toescape from worldly miseries and tribulations.HOW TO DESTROY SANKALPADestroy the stains of Sankalpa or the cloud of Sankalpa through the power of discriminationand constant efforts and be drowned in the ocean of Brahmic bliss with spiritual illumination. Whenyou try to bury your shadow in the earth, it always comes out. Similarly, when you try to destroy theSankalpas through Viveka-Vritti, they will come out again and again. Withdraw the mind from theobjects and act according to your Guruís instructions. Purify the mind and fix it on the Akasa of theheart (Infinite Brahman). The mind will be destroyed in course of time. Be sure of this.Do not for a moment contemplate upon the things of the universe. You need not exertyourself too much to rid yourself of this Sankalpa. With the checking of all thoughts, oneís mindwill perish. To crush a full-blown flower in oneís hand requires a little effort, but even that littleeffort is not needed to do away with Sanklpa. Sankalpa is destroyed with the control of thoughts.Having firmly annihilated the external Sankalpa through the internal one and having destroyed theimpure mind through the pure one, rest firmly in your Atma-Jnana.When you are firmly established in the idea that the world is unreal, Vikshepa (throughnames and forms) and Sphurana of Sankalpa (thoughts) will slowly vanish. Repeat constantly theformula,ìBrahma Satyam Jaganmithya Jivo Brahmaiva Naaparahî(Brahman alone is real.World is unreal. Jiva is identical with Brahman).

Sankalpa is pain. Nissankalpa is all bliss. Sit alone in a solitary room. Close the eyes. Watchthe mind and destroy the Vrittis one by one by continuous, energetic efforts. AsamprajnataSamadhi will ensue.If, with the extinction of the pain-producing Sankalpas, the mind also is destroyed, then willthe thick frost of Moha (delusion) affecting you from remote periods dissipate itself. Then, like anunobscured sky in the autumnal season, Brahman alone will shine resplendent, blissful,imperishable, non-dual, formless and without birth and death.When your thoughts, which are now dispersed, shall be collected together and you willremain in a state of repose, then the eternally happy Atman will shine forth as the reflection of thesun is seen in a clear surface of water. Peace is not in money, woman or eating. When the mindbecomes desireless and thoughtless, Atman shines and sheds forth eternal bliss and peace.

Search within for bliss in the subjective,Sat-Chit-Ananda Amrita Atman.Chapter 16THOUGHT CREATES THE WORLDTHOUGHT, THE ORIGIN OF EVERYTHINGEverything in the material universe about us had its origin first in thought. From this, it tookits form. Every castle, every statue, every painting, every piece of mechanismóin short,everythingóhad its birth, its origin, first in the mind of the one who formed it before it received itsmaterial expression or embodiment.Mind has got various preoccupations. When an artist begins to draw a picture on the canvas,he draws the picture out of the material preconceived by the mind.After all, the world is merely an idea or thought. Just as a seed begins to germinate at itsproper time and place, so also the seer (knower) appears as the visible through the Sankalpa of themind (the visible being no other than the seer itself). When the mind ceases to think, the worldvanishes and there is bliss indescribable. When the mind begins to think, immediately the worldreappears and there is suffering.62SANKALPA"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"ìCogito, ergo sumóI think, therefore I am.î This is Descartesís fundamental basis ofphilosophy.

But, it is a pity that nobody has seen the mind savea seer. When you seriously and unceasingly think over the nature of the mind, it is nothing. Whenyou begin to analyse mind, it is nothing. It dwindles to airy nothing. It is a bundle of thoughts andthe thought ëIí is the root of all thoughts. This ëIí is a false idea, a non-entity. When the root of allthoughts vanishes into nothing, where is the boasted mind?The first thought that arose in your mind was ëAhamí, ëIí. The last thought or Vritti that willarise in the mind before it is absorbed in Brahman will be Brahmakara Vritti which is produced byyour feeling that you are Infinity.UNIVERSE, A CREATION OF THE COSMIC MINDThe universe is not mental creation of Jiva. One single, organised thought of the CosmicMind (Hiranyagarbha) has materialised as the seeming universe. This phenomenal universe is butan outcome of the Divine Will, seeming to be real through the workings of the mind.Before you write out a drama, you have a vivid mental picture of the whole drama in yourmind. Then you write it out in succession in four acts. When it is staged, it is acted in succession,part by part. Similarly, the universe with its movements is a vivid mental picture in the CosmicMindóin the mind of Isvara. There is neither past nor future for Him. Everything is ëPresentí forHim. There is neither ënearí nor ëfarí for Him. Every place is ëhereí. Every time is ënowí. Theevents come out in succession on the stage of the long world-drama as Time rolls on. Atoms rotatecontinuously. Old becomes new and new becomes old. In reality there is no such thing as old; thereis no such thing as single. The Jivas with individual minds are witnessing the events in succession.But Isvara knows all events at one sweep. He is Sarvajna (all-knowing). He is Sarvavit(all-understanding) also. He knows every detail of His creation. The Cosmic Mind creates theMaya. Individual minds receive things under delusion.This universe is nothing but a mode of the mind, self-evolved from Brahman, the cause ofthe universe. All the universes which appear only through Manas are no other than its modes. Themind is subjectively consciousness and objectively it is this universe.

Even thisworld is my own mental creation.Abhava or non-existence is said to be an object of perception, since non-existence of a thingmeans its existence somewhere else.According to the idealistic theory, there is no world at all in reality. It is all mere mentalimagination. This is Vijnanavada of the Buddhists.According to the realistic theory, the world is a solid reality. Even the dualist shool ofMadhva and Visishtadvaita school of Ramanuja and Raja Yogic school of Maharshi Patanjali holdthat the world is real (Jagat Satyam).Kant has demonstrated that space, time and causation are not objective realities, but onlysubjective forms of our intellect, and the unavoidable conclusion is that the world, so far as it isextended in space, is running on in time and ruled throughout by causality, is merely arepresentation of our mind and nothing beyond it.A finite mind that is gross and conditioned by time, space and causation cannot comprehendthe why and how of the universe, a question that is transcendental. The question has never beenanswered by anybody, by any Sastra, by any sage or Acharya. Do not rack your mind on this point.You can never get a solution for this problem. It is Mauja of Brahman to create this universe. It isHis Lila-Vilasa. It is His Maya. It is His Svabhava.NON-EXISTENCE OF THE WORLDóWHAT IT MEANSThe Abhava of Jagat (non-existence of the world) or its Nasa (destruction) does not meanthe annihilation of mountains, lakes, trees and rivers. When your Nischaya (determination) that thisworld is Mithya (unreal, illusory) gets stronger and stronger and when you are well-established onthis idea that this world is illusory like Mrigatrishna (mirage), this alone is destruction of the world.65MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"You cannot destroy a mountain, but you can destroy the idea of a mountain.The universe is like a Svapna in Jagrat.

There is Brahman only.The mind which ever rises and falls with the ebb of desires, fancies this illusory universe tobe through its ignorance; but it should be informed of the real nature of this world, then it willcognise it to be Brahman itself.66THOUGHT CREATES THE WORLD"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Chapter 17AVIDYA AND AHANKARAAVIDYAThe mind itself is a creation of Avidya (ignorance). It is a Karya (effect) of Avidya. It isfilled with delusion. That is the reason why it deceives and tempts you. It makes you go astray. Ifyou can destroy the cause of the mind, Ajnana, by getting Jnana (knowledge of the Supreme Self),mind is nowhere. It dwindles into an airy nothing. Manonasa (annihilation of mind) takes placewhen Jnana dawns.Avidya works through Upadhis (attributes, limiting adjuncts). All the special apparatusrequired by Avidya constitute the Upadhis of the soul. Mind is an Upadhi; Buddhi is an Upadhi andAhankara also is an Upadhi.The sea of Avidya (ignorance) is in the mind of man. The explanation of the empiricalconcept must be sought in the nature of our cognitive faculty. Sri Sankara explains Avidya in thisway. It is Naisargika; it is innate in our mental faculty. It is Mithyajnananimitta, based on wrongknowledge; and, knowledge is a function of the mind. It is Nityapratyayarupa; it consists in theform of a wrong conception. ìAll Jivasóhuman entitiesówhich are really non-existent, are (withall concomitant appearance of birth, death, etc.) mere results of the objectivising tendency of themind and nothing else.îThe whole experience of duality, made up of perceiver and perceived, is pure imagination.There is no Avidya apart from the mind. On destruction of the mind, all is destroyed. The activity ofthe mind is the cause of all appearance. On account of Avidya or Bhranti (illusion) in the mind, yousee the objects, trees, etc., outside and feel as if they are separate from you and real.So long as there is mind, there are all these distinctions of big and small, high and low,superior and inferior, good and bad, etc. The highest Truth is that in which there is no relativity. Ifyou can transcend the mind by constant and profound meditation on Atman, you will be able toattain the Nirdvandva state (a state beyond the pairs of opposites) wherein lies the supreme peaceand highest knowledge.There is no Avidya outside the mind. The mind itself is Avidya. Imaginations andSankalpas are products of Avidya. Ignorance is imbedded in the mind. The mind needs thoroughcleansing with Japa, Pranayama, Satsanga, Vichara and Nididhyasana, just as a rusty copper plateneeds cleansing with earth, ash, tamarind, powder, etc.AHANKARAóHOW IT DEVELOPSAtman in conjunction with the Buddhi is Ahankara. The basis of Ahankara is Buddhi. Asthe Buddhi (Bheda Buddhi) is the cause for this differentiation (this little ìIî), Buddhi is the cause67MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"or seed for Ahankara. Ahamta and Mamata (ëIí-ness and ëmineí-ness) are Jivasrishti. It is Jivasrishtithat binds a man to the world. Isvarasrishti (Godís creation) helps man in his God-realisation.The seed of mind is Ahankara. Ahankara is development through the thoughts of the mind.As the first thought is the ëIí thought and as this ëIí thought is at the base of all other thoughts,Ahankara is the seed for the mind. This idea of ëIí will bring in its train, the idea of time, space andother potencies. With these environments, the name Jiva accrues to it. Contemporaneously with it,there arise Buddhi, memory, Manas which is the seed of the tree of Sankalpa.When you are a boy, the Ahankara is not very potent. It is like a shadow in a glass. It getsdeveloped and firm-rooted during your adolescence after you marry and entangle yourself in theachievement of various worldly desires. You are fearless in your boyhood. The moment this littleëIí becomes stronger in your, side by side, various sorts of fears, various sorts of desires, a host ofdelusions take firm hold of you. The world appears to you more real, too.THE CURSE OF EGOISMAhankara is, after all, nothing. But, tremendous is its influence! Maya means Ahankara.Mind is another name for Ahankara. World means Ahankara. The sprout of Ahankara ramifies hereand there with its long branches of ëmineí and ëthineí. It is inveterate. Ahankara wants to live inflesh (Abhinivesa or clinging to life), to eat flesh and to embrace flesh. This is pure Ajnana(ignorance) only. Look at Mayaís deception and wholesale swindling! Beware! Awake! Get Jnana.Just as the cloud screens the sun, so also this cloud of Ahankara screens the ëJnana Suryaí,the Infinite Sun of Knowledge, Brahman. You cannot realise God, if you have the least tinge ofegoism, if you have the slightest attachment to name and form, if you have the least tinge of Vasanaor if you have the least trace of worldly desire in the mind.HOW TO ERADICATE AHANKARAThe deep roots of Ahankara should be burnt by the fire of knowledge (Jnanagni). Then youwill quite easily get the wealth of Moksha. All tribulations, sorrows, miseries and afflictions willterminate now. Control of the Indriyas and Pranayama help to develop the Buddhi (Vikasa ofBuddhi).You cannot, all at once, eradicate Ahankara altogether. You can easily give up wife,children, money, anger. But it is extremely difficult to give up Ahankara. Try to minimise it little bylittle. Remove one anna of Ahankara within three months. Within four years, you will be able toroot it out completely. You will have to remove it either by self-sacrifice through Karma Yogaóorself-surrender through Bhaktióor self-denial through Vedantic Atma-Vichara.Through the Sankalpas of Manas, Ahankara is generated. If the modification of the mindwhich leans to sensual pleasures is destroyed, the Atman, divested of its Ahankara, becomes theunnameable Brahmic Reality.68AVIDYA AND AHANKARA"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Ahankara is like a thread. It connects or links all the Indriyas on itself. When the thread isbroken, all the pearls fall down. Even so, when the thread of Ahankara is broken by ëAham BrahmaAsmië Bhavana or Sakshi Bhava or self-surrender method by taking the Nimitta Bhava(instrument-in-the-hands-of-the-Lord attitude), all the Indriyas will be broken down or destroyed.The connection with Indriyas will be severed.Even if you identify yourself with a subtle body inside, it will help you in yourSelf-realisation. It is only the identification with the fleshy physical body that brings all sorts oftroubles through gross Ahankara and ëminenessí. The physical ëIí is a very great menace.Whenever Ahankara asserts itself, raise a question within thyself, ìWhat is the source of thislittle ëIí?î Again and again, moot this question and enquire. When you remove layer after layer, theonion dwindles to nothing. When you analyse the little ëIí, it becomes a non-entity; it will graduallyvanish. It will dwindle into an airy nothing. Body is not ëIí. ëIí remains even after the leg isamputated. Give up Jivasrishti.Within the time taken to pluck a flower, within the twinkling of an eye, this Ahankara can beeasily eradicated by right Sadhana or Brahma-Bhava.SATTVIC AHANKARAWhen you assert ëAham Brahma Asmií (I am Brahman), it is Sattvic Ahankara. It isMoksha Ahankara. It will not bind you in any way. It will help you realise Brahman. The fire in apicture will not burn anything. A light in the presence of midday sun will not shine and shed itslight. Even so, the Ahankara of a Sattvic person cannot do any harm to any person.Chapter 18THE POWER OF THOUGHTTHOUGHT IS A LIVING FORCEThought is a vital, living force, the most vital, subtle and irresistible force that exists in theuniverse. The thought-world is more real relatively than this physical universe. Thoughts are livingthings. Every change in thought is accompanied by vibration of its matter (mental). Thought asforce needs a special kind of subtle matter in its working.Mind assumes the form of anything it contemplates. When you think of an object, yourmind shapes itself into the form of that object. When you change your thought, your mind alsochanges its shape. Many modifications continually arise in the mind. Your thoughts rapidly change.Your mind also changes its shape rapidly. Every moment, mind is continually creating hundreds ofthese thought-forms and continually dispersing them again. It never holds on steadily to onethought-form for some time.69MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Every thought has a certain name and a certain form. Form is the grosser and name the finerstate of a single manifesting power called thought. But, these three are one. It is the unity in trinity,the three degrees of existence of the same thing. Wherever the one is, the others also are there.Suppose your mind is now perfectly calm, entirely without thought. Nevertheless, as soon asthought begins to rise, it will immediately take name and form. Thus you find that every idea thatman has, or can have, must be connected with a certain word as its counterpart.Language is different, but thought is one. Mental image is the same in all. Sound has gotfour forms,viz.,Para, Pasyanti, Madhyama and Vaikhari. Vaikhari is the ordinary speech. It differsin different countries. But Para, Pasyanti and Madhyama are one and the same. Para isundifferentiated sound that lies dormant in Brahman. The language of the Devatas, the language inthe mental plane is one. It is Madhyama. The rotatory vibration of the causal body (Karana-Sarira)is Pasyanti. That is your real name. When you operate through your Karana-Sarira, (lowerPrakamya or lower Divya Drishti), you will hear the Pasyanti sound, your real name.THOUGHT IS SUBTLE MATTERThought is subtle matter. A thought is as much solid as a piece of stone. You may die, butyour thoughts can never die. They have form, size, shape, colour, quality, substance, power andweight. A spiritual thought has yellow colour; a thought charged with anger and hatred is of a darkred colour; a selfish thought has a brown colour; and so on. A Yogin can see directly with his innerYogic eye all these thoughts.The stronger the thoughts, the earlier the fructification. Thought is focussed and given aparticular direction and, in the degree that thought is thus focussed and given direction, it iseffective in the work it is sent out to accomplish.THOUGHT IS A CREATIVE FORCEThought is a great force. Thought is a dynamic force. Thought moves. Thought isinfectious. Thought creates. You can work wonders with the power of thought. Through theinstrumentality of thought, you acquire creative power. There are nowadays numerous books onthought-power, thought-dynamics and thought-culture. Study them. You will then have acomprehensive understanding of thought, its power, workings and usefulness.The power of thought is very great. Every thought of yours has a literal value to you in everypossible way. The strength of your body, the strength of your mind, your success in life and thepleasures you give to others by your companyó all depend on the nature and quality of yourthoughts. You must know thought-culture.THOUGHT GIVES HEALTHIf you entertain healthy thoughts, you can keep good health. If you hold on to sicklythoughts in the mind, thoughts of diseased tissues, thoughts of weak-nerves, thoughts of improperfunctioning of organs or viscera, you can never expect good health, beauty and harmony. The body70THE POWER OF THOUGHT"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"is the product of the mind. If you hold on vigorous thoughts in the mind, then the physical body alsowill be vigorous.Evil thoughts of all kinds befoul and infure the mind and, if persisted in, will becomeveritable diseases and maimings of the mind, incurable during the period of life.THOUGHT BUILDS CHARACTERìAs a man thinketh, so he is.î ìMan is created by thought; what a man thinks upon, that hebecomes.î Think you are strong; strong you become. Think you are weak; weak you become. Thinkyou are a fool; fool you become. Think you are God; God you become. A man forms his owncharacter, becoming that which he thinks. If you meditate on courage, you shall work courage intoyour character. So with purity, patience, unselfishness and self-control. If you think nobly, youshall gradually make for yourself a noble character, but if you think basely, a base character will beformed. Steady persevering thought sets up a definite habit of the mind and that habit manifestsitself as a quality in the character. The thread of thought is woven into mental and moral qualitiesand these qualities in their totality form what we call character. You can build your character assurely as a mason can build a wall, working with and through the law.The first step towards a deliberate creation of character lies then in the deliberate choosingof what we will think and then of thinking persistently on the quality chosen. Ere long, there will bea tendency to evince that quality; a little longer, its exercise will become habitual. Thought makescharacter. You spin the thread of thought into your destiny.THOUGHT WEAVES DESTINYThat which man thinks upon in one life, he becomes in another. If the mind dwellscontinually upon one train of thought, a groove is formed into which the thought-force runsautomatically and such a habit of thought survives death and since it belongs to the ego, is carriedover to the subsequent earth life as a thought tendency and capacity.Every thought has got its own mental image. Every man has a mental world of his own, hisown views, his own sentiments, his own feelings, his own habitual thoughts, his own experienceand his own mode of thinking. The essence of the various mental images formed in one particularphysical life is being worked out in the mental plane. It constitutes the basis for the next physicallife. Just as a new physical body is formed in every birth, so also a new mind and a new Buddhi areformed in every birth.It is difficult to explain the detailed workings of thought and Karma. Every Karma producestwofold effects, one on the individual mind and the other on the world. Man makes thecircumstances of his future life by the effect of his actions upon others.Every action has a past which leads up to it; every action has a future which proceeds fromit. An action implies a desire which prompted it and a thought which shaped it. Each act is a link inan endless chain of causes and effects, each effect becoming a cause and each cause having been an71MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"effect; and each link in the endless chain is welded out of three componentsódesire, thought andactivity. A desire stimulates a thought; a thought embodies itself in an act.Selfish coveting of the possessions of others, though never carried out into active cheatingin the present, makes one a thief in a later earth-life, while hatred and revenge secretly cherished arethe seeds from which the murderer springs. So again, unselfish loving yields as harvest thephilanthropist and the saint; and every thought of compassion helps to build the tender and pitifulnature which belongs to one who is a friend to all creatures.LIKE ATTRACTS LIKEThe great law, ìLike attracts like,î is ever operating. This is a great cosmic law. This is a lawin nature. This law operates in the thought world also. People of similar thoughts are attractedtowards each other. That is the reason why the maxims run as follows: ìBirds of the same featherflock together... A man is known by the company he keeps.î A doctor is drawn towards a doctor. Apoet has attraction for another poet. A songster loves another songster. A philosopher likes anotherphilosopher. A vagabond likes a vagabond. The mind has got a ëdrawing powerí. You arecontinually attracting towards you, from both the seen and the unseen sides of life-forces, thoughts,influences and conditions most akin to those of your own thoughts and lives.In the realm of thought, people of similar thoughts are attracted to one another. Thisuniversal law is continually operating whether we are conscious of it or not. We are all living, so tospeak, in a vast ocean of thought; and the very atmosphere around us is continually filled with thethought-forces that are being continually sent or that are continually going out in the form ofthought-waves. We are all affected more or less by these thought-forces either consciously orunconsciously and in the degree that we are more or less sensitively organised or in the degree weare negative and so are open to outside influences, rather than positive, which thus determine whatinfluences shall enter into the domain of our thoughts and hence into our lives.Carry any kind of thought you please about with you and so long as you retain it, no matterhow you roam over land or sea, you will unceasingly attract to yourself, knowingly orinadvertently, exactly and only what corresponds to your own dominant quality of thought.Thoughts are your private property and you can regulate them to suit your taste entirely by steadilyrecognising your ability to do so. You have entirely in your own hands to determine the order ofthought you entertain and consequently the order of influences you attract and are not mere willowycreatures of circumstances, unless indeed you choose to be.GOOD THOUGHTS AND EVIL THOUGHTSA good thought is thrice blessed. First, it benefits the thinker by improving his mental body(Manomaya Kosha). Secondly, it benefits the person about whom it is entertained. Lastly, itbenefits all mankind by improving the general mental atmosphere.An evil thought, on the contrary, is thrice cursed. First, it harms the thinker by doing injuryto his mental body. Secondly, it harms the person who is its object. Lastly, it harms all mankind byvitiating the whole mental atmosphere.72THE POWER OF THOUGHT"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Every evil thought is as a sword drawn on the person to whom it is directed. If you entertainthoughts of hatred, you are really a murderer of that man against whom you foster thoughts ofhatred. You are your own suicide, because these thoughts rebound upon you only.A mind tenanted by evil thoughts acts as a magnet to attract like thoughts from others andthus intensifies the original evil.Evil thoughts thrown into the mental atmosphere poison receptive minds. To dwell on anevil thought gradually deprives it of its repulsiveness and impels the thinker to perform an actionwhich embodies it.THE PROGENY OF THOUGHTSIt is not sufficient that your thoughts are not bad. You must transmute bad thoughts intogood thoughts. This is the first part of your Sadhana. You must make them helpful thoughts. Whenthey are sent out, they must be capable of doing immense good and benefit to the sufferinghumanity and your neighbours.Thoughts are your own real children. Be careful of your progeny of thoughts. A good sonbrings happiness, name and fame to the father. An evil son brings infamy, discredit to his father.Even so, a noble thought will bring happiness and joy to you. An evil thought will bring misery andtrouble to you. Just as you rear up your children with great care, so also you will have to rear upgood, sublime thoughts with great care.THOUGHT IS CONTAGIOUSThought is very contagious, nay, more contagious than the Spanish Flu. Thought moves. Itactually leaves the brain and hovers about. It enters the brains of others also. A sympathetic thoughtin you raises a sympathetic thought in others with whom you come in contact. A thought of angerproduces a similar vibration in those who surround an angry man. It leaves the brain of one man andenters the brains of others who live at a long distance and excites them. A cheerful thought producescheerful thought in others. A thought of joy creates sympathetically a thought of joy in others. Youare filled with joy and intense delight when you see a batch of hilarious children playing mirthfullyand dancing in joy.In broadcasting, a singer sings beautiful songs at Calcutta. You can hear them nicelythrough the radio-set in your own house at Delhi. All messages are received through the wireless.Even so, your mind is like a wireless machine. A saint with peace, poise, harmony and spiritualwaves sends out into the world thoughts of harmony and peace. They travel with tremendouslightning speed in all directions and enter the minds of thousands and produce in them also similarthoughts of harmony and peace. Whereas a worldly man whose mind is filled with jealousy,revenge and hatred sends out discordant thoughts which enter the minds of thousands and stir inthem similar thoughts of hatred and discord.Thought is very contagious. Keep a good and honest man in the company of a thief. He willbegin to steal. Keep a sober man in the company of a drunkard. He will begin to drink.73MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"THOUGHT-TRANFERENCE OR TELEPATHYWhat is the possible medium through which thoughts can travel from one mind to another?The best possible explanation is that Manas or mind-substance fills all space like ether and it servesas the vehicle for thoughts as Prana is the vehicle for feelings, ether is the vehicle for heat, light andelectricity, and air is the vehicle for sound. Mind is Vibhu (all-pervading) like Akasa. Hence,thought-transference is possible. Thought-transference is telepathy.If we throw a piece of stone in a tank or a pool of water, it will produce a succession ofconcentric waves travelling all around from the affected place. The light of a candle will similarlygive rise to waves of ethereal vibrations travelling in all directions from the candle. In the samemanner, when a thought, whether good or evil, crosses the mind of a person, it gives rise tovibrations in the Manas or mental atmosphere, which travel far and wide in all directions.While electricity travels at the rate of 1,86,000 miles per second, thoughts virtually travel inno time, their speed being as much faster than electricity as their vehicle Manas is finer than ether,the medium of electricity.Thoughts are like things. Just as you hand over an orange to your friend and take it back, soalso you can give a useful, powerful thought to your friend and take it back also. You must know theright technique to handle and manipulate a thought. The science is very interesting and subtle. Youcan aid a friend in trouble by sending him thoughts of comfort, a friend in search of Truth bythoughts clear and definite of the truths you know. You can send into the mental atmospherethoughts which will raise, purify and inspire all who are sensible to them.If you send out a loving, helpful thought to another man, it leaves your brain, goes directly tothat man, raises a similar thought of love in his mind and returns back to you with redoubled force.If you send out a thought of hatred to another man, it hurts that man and hurts you also by returningback to you with redoubled force. Therefore, understand the laws of thought, raise only thoughts ofmercy, love and kindness from your mind and be happy always.When you send out a useful thought to help others, it must have a definite, positive purposeand aim. Then only it will bring out the desired effect. Then only that thought will accomplish adefinite work.THE DUTY OF AN ASPIRANTYou should learn the method of sending out helping, loving thoughts to others and thewhole world at large. You should know how to remove distraction and collect all thoughts and sendthem out as a battalion of helpful forces to do good to the suffering humanity. Thought-transferenceis a beautiful science. It is an exact science.Just as the flowing Ganga brings joy and coolness to those who live on its banks, so alsoyour strong thoughts of love and peace must flow out as a healing stream to bring solace, peace andglee to those persons whose minds are filled with care, worry, anxiety, tribulation, affliction, etc.74THE POWER OF THOUGHT"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Even some good natured householders entertain some occasional good thoughts and sendout into the world some helpful thoughts. This is not sufficient for an aspirant in the path of Truth. Acontinuous stream of helpful thoughts must gush out from his mind. It must be a perennial, healingstream of loving, helpful thoughts. He must be able to charge groups of twenty persons, masses ofhundreds and thousands with love, joy and cheerfulness. He must stir them with a mere glance and afew sweet, powerful words into enthusiasm, high spirits and exalted moods and exhilaration. Thatis spiritual strength, will-force (Atma-Bala).HOW SANNYASINS SERVE THE WORLD THROUGH THEIRTHOUGHT-VIBRATIONSIndians have now imbibed the missionary spirit of the West and cry out that Sannyasinsshould come out and take part in social and political activities. It is a sad mistake. A Sannyasin or aYogin need not become the President of an Association or the leader of a social or politicalmovement. It is a foolish and puerile idea. A true Sannyasin can do everything through histhought-vibrations.It is not necessary that a Sannyasin, a saint should appear on the platform to help the world,to preach and elevate the minds of people. Some saints preach by example. Their very lives are anembodiment of teaching. Their very sight elevates the minds of thousands. A saint is a livingassurance for others for God-realisation. Many draw inspiration from the sight of holy saints. Noone can check the thought-vibrations from the saints. Their pure, strong thought-vibrations travel avery long distance, purify the world and enter the minds of many thousands of persons. There is nodoubt in this.A sage living in a Himalayan cave can transmit a powerful thought to a corner of America.He who practises Nishkama Karma Yoga in the world purifies himself through disinterested worksand he who meditates in a cave in the Himalayas and tries to purify himself really purifies the world,helps the world at large through his spiritual vibrations. Nobody can prevent his pure thoughtscoming out and passing to others who really want them. Worldly-minded social workers cannotunderstand this point.CLEAR THINKINGóHOW IT IS ACCOMPLISHEDThe common man does not know what deep thinking is. His thoughts run riot. There is agreat deal of confusion in the mind sometimes. His mental images are very distorted. It is onlythinkers, philosophers and Yogins who have well-defined, clear-cut mental images. They can beseen through clairvoyance very vividly. Those who practise concentration and meditation developstrong, well-formed mental images.Most of your thoughts are not well-grounded. They come and slip away. They are,therefore, vague and indefinite. The images are not clear, strong and well-defined. You will have toreinforce them by clear, continuous and deep thinking. Through Vichara (ratiocination), Manana(deep reflection) and meditation, you will have to make the thoughts settle down and crystalise intoa definite shape. Then the philosophical idea will become firm. Through right-thinking, reasoning,75MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"introspection and meditation, you will have to clarify your ideas. Then confusion will vanish. Thethoughts will get settled and well-grounded.Think clearly. Clarify your ideas again and again. Introspect in solitude. Purify yourthoughts to a considerable degree. Silence the thoughts. Do not allow the mind to bubble. Let onethought-wave rise and settle down calmly. Then allow another thought to enter. Drive off allextraneous thoughts that have no connection with the subject-matter you are handling at the presentmoment.INDEPENDENT AND ORIGINAL THINKINGThinkers are very few in this world. Most of us do not know what right thinking is. Thinkingis shallow in the vast majority of persons. Deep thinking needs intense Sadhana (practice). It takesinnumerable births for the proper evolution of the mind. Then only it can think deeply and properly.A man who speaks the truth and has moral purity has always powerful thoughts. One who hascontrolled anger by long practice has tremendous thought power. If a Yogin whose thought is verypowerful speaks one word, it will produce tremendous impression on the minds of others.Independent and original thinking is resorted to by the Vedantins. Vedantic Sadhana(Manana, reflection) demands a sharp intellect. Hard thinking, persistent thinking, clear thinking,thinking to the roots of all problems, to the very fundamentals of the situations, to the verypresuppositions of all thoughts and being is the very essence of Vedantic Sadhana. You will have toabandon an old idea, however strong and ingrained it may be, when you get a new, elevating idea inits stead. If you have no courage to face the results of your thinking, to swallow the conclusions ofyour thinking, whatever they may mean to you personally, you should never take the trouble tophilosophise. Take up to devotion.APPLIED THINKING AND SUSTAINED THINKINGApplied thinking applies the mind to the object and sustained thinking keeps it continuallyengaged; rapture brings about the expanding and bliss of the developing mind whose motives fornon-distraction have been accomplished by those two kinds of thinking. Meditation can arise whenapplied and sustained thinking, rapture, bliss and collectedness of mind arise.Thought is a great force. It has got tremendous power. It becomes a matter of great momentto know how to use this power in the highest possible way and to the greatest possible effect. Thiscan best be done by the practice of meditation.76THE POWER OF THOUGHT"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 19THOUGHT-CULTUREIf a pebble in our boot torments us we expel it. We take off the boot and shake it out. Oncethe matter is fairly understood, it is just as easy to expel an intruding and obnoxious thought fromthe mind. About this there ought to be no doubt, no two opinions. The thing is obvious, clear andunmistakable. It should be as easy to expel an obnoxious thought from your mind as it is to take astone out of your shoe; and till a man can do that, it is just nonsense to talk about his ascendency andconquest over nature. He is a mere slave and prey to the bat-winged phantoms that flit through thecorridor of his brain. Pitiable, indeed, is the lot of these creatures!BENEFITS OF THOUGHT-CONTROLThoughts lead to action. Thoughts are the sources of all actions. Thought is the real Karma.Thinking is the real action. If you can root out all evil thoughts in the beginning, you will not do anyevil action. If you can nip them in the bud, you will be free from the miseries and tribulations of thisworld. Watch your thoughts with vigilance and introspection.Thought is the real action. Activities of the mind are the real Karmas. Once the Vikshepa ofthe mind vanishes, you will get good Nishtha (meditation). The mind will be very, very calm. Getrid of the impurities of the mind. Have mastery over the mind. Then all the miseries of the Samsarawith births and deaths will come to an end. If you free yourself from the clutches of the mind,Moksha (liberation) will come by itself. There is no doubt about this.A wise man watches his thoughts and eradicates all evil thoughts as they arise from thesurface of the mind. So he is happy. He has always pure thoughts. By meditation on God, purethoughts emanate from the mind, because God is purity (Nitya Suddha).If you have control over your thoughts, you can turn out immense work with intenseconcentration. Mental torments of all sorts, cares, worries and anxieties will disappear. The peacethat you will enjoy cannot be adequately described.Those who have even a little control over their thoughts and speech will have a calm, serene,beautiful, charming face, sweet voice and brilliant, lustrous white eyes. Just as sweet perfumecontinuously emanates from an incense stick, so also divine perfume and divine effulgence(magnetic, Brahmic aura) radiate from a Yogin who has controlled his thoughts and who isconstantly dwelling on Brahman or the infinite. The effulgence and perfume of his face isBrahma-Varchas. When you hold in your hand a bouquet made of jasmine, rose and Champakaflowers, the sweet perfume pervades the whole hall and tickles all alike. Even so, the perfume offame and reputation (Yasas and Kirti) of a Yogin who has controlled his thoughts spreads far andwide. He becomes a cosmic force.Radium is a rare commodity.

You can help many, healthousands, spiritualise and elevate a large number of persons as did Jesus and Buddha.Just as you grow jasmine, rose, lily, honolulu flowers in a garden, so also you shouldcultivate the flowers of peaceful thoughts of love, mercy, kindness, purity in the vast garden ofAntahkarana. Through introspection, you have to water this garden of mind with meditation andsublime thinking and remove the weeds of vain, useless discordant thoughts.INCONSISTENT THOUGHTSGenerally, in untrained persons, four or five kinds of thoughts occupy the mind at a time.Household thoughts, business thoughts, thoughts of office, thoughts of body, thoughts of food and78THOUGHT-CULTURE"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"drink, hope and anticipation, some kind of planning to get money, some kinds of thoughts ofrevenge, some habitual thoughts of answering calls of nature, bathing, etc., occupy the mind at atime. When you are studying a book with interest at 3.30 p.m., the idea of pleasure of witnessing acricket match at 4 p.m. disturbs your study every now and then. It is only a Yogin with Ekagra mind,who can have only one thought at a time and can keep it as long as he likes.If you watch the mind carefully, you will find that many thoughts are inconsistent. The mindwanders at random aimlessly. There will be some thoughts of the body and its wants, some thoughtsof friends, some thoughts of acquiring money, some thoughts of eating and drinking, some thoughtsof your boyhood, etc. If you can study the mind and if you have consistent thoughts of one subject orone kind only to the exclusion of all other thoughts, this itself is a very great achievement, is a greatstep in advancement in thought-control. Do not be discouraged.HAUNTING THOUGHTS OF SINThoughts of sin haunt the minds of some persons. One man always thinks, ìI havecommitted a very heinous sin. I do not know what to do.î Again and again, this one idea haunts hismind. This is a bad habit. These people do not know how to divert their minds. They become prey tothese ëhaunting thoughtsí. Virtue and sin are relative terms. They are creations of the mind. Sin isnothing but a mistake. Japa of Godís Name, charity and fasting will destroy at once any amount ofsin. Why are you afraid? Even the worst sinner can attain salvation, can become holy of holies.What was the state of Valmiki, Jagai and Madhai and Ajamila in the beginning? Were they notrogues of the first water?

Betrue to the Antaryamin (Indweller of your heart).TECHNIQUES OF THOUGHT-CONTROLThe following are some of the auto-suggestions for controlling your thoughts: (1) I shall notthink of anything. (2) I shall get peace, if I do not think of anything. (3) My will is growing strong. Ican control my thoughts. (4) I will get perfect peace when I am thoughtless. I eagerly long for thatthoughtless state.Each thought, by itself, is extremely weak, because the mind is distracted into countless andever-varying thoughts. The more the thoughts are restrained, the more is the mind concentrated and,consequently, the more does it gain in strength and power. Destroy the evil thoughts one by one. Itdoubtless needs patient work.As soon as you slowly wake up in the morning, the first thought that comes is ëIí. Thencomes the memory of the events of the previous evening. The strong thoughts that float in the mindthis evening slowly emerge out the moment you rise from your bed in the following morning andmaterialise. Then come the thoughts that are to fructify in the course of the day. Watch thiscarefully.When a thought hovers in the mind, fulfil it. Do not allow it to linger on for a long time. Itwill frequently recur again and again. It will be a source of great trouble. Whenever a thought79MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"flashes out to write a letter to your friend, then and there finish that piece of work. Do notprocrastinate it.There are four ways of destroying evil thoughts. A Jnana Yogin (student of the path ofKnowledge) does it by living in OM or Truth. He destroys the evil thoughts by Vichara and attitudeof indifference. He says, ìThis has nothing to do with me. I am Satchidananda-Svarupa, Sivoham,Sivoham. These impulses belong to the mind. I am distinct from the mind.î A Bhakta destroys thesame by prayer and self-surrender. He says, ìO God! I have surrendered myself, the fruits of allactions and the actions themselves to Thee. Give me strength to drive away and destroy these evilthoughts.î He gets help from God through self-surrender. God sublimates the sex-impulse intoSattva or Ojas (spiritual energy). The Raja Yogin destroys evil thoughts either by destroying theVrittis as they arise or by substituting opposite, positive thoughts of Sattvic nature, by supplantingsublime thoughts in their stead (Pratipaksha-Bhavana).Brahma VicharaThe first and foremost of all thoughtsóthe primeval thoughtóis ëIí. It is only after the birthof this thought that any other thought can rise at all. It is only after the first personal pronoun ëIí hasarisen in the mind that the second personal pronoun ëYouí and the third personal pronoun ëHeí, etc.,can make their appearance. If ëIí vanishes, ëYouí and ëHeí will disappear by themselves. Eradicatethis false little ëIí of an illusory nature through proper Brahma Vichara. There is no other way.Thinker is different from thought. Remember this. This gives the clue to the fact that you arethe silent witness of the modifications that arise in the mind. You are Kutastha Brahman. You arePratyagatman.Destruction of SankalpasRaja Yoga teachesYogas-chittavrittinirodhah:óìYoga is the restraint of the mentalmodifications.î It gives you the power of expelling the thoughts or, if need be, of killing them deadon the spot. Naturally, the art requires practice, but like other arts, when once acquired, there is nomystery or difficulty about it. It is worth practising.Mark how one Sankalpa expands into many Sankalpas (imaginations) in a short time.Suppose you get a Sankalpa to have a tea-party for your friends. One thought of tea invitesinstantaneously the thoughts of sugar, milk, tea-cups, tables, chairs, table-cloth, napkins, spoons,sweetmeats, salted things, etc. So this world is nothing but the expansion of Sankalpas. There is nosuch thing as the world, independent of and apart from, thoughts. The expansion of thoughts of themind towards objects is bondage (Bandha). Renunciation of Sankalpas is liberation (Moksha). Inthe string of Sankalpa, countless thoughts are strung like so many beads. If the string be cut intopieces, then you may infer what will become of the illusory thoughts which are strung on it. Youmust be very watchful and nip the Sankalpas in the bud. Then only will you be really happy. Mindplays tricks. You must understand its nature, ways and habits. Then only you can control it veryeasily.80THOUGHT-CULTURE"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"PranayamaPrana (energy) is the outer overcoat for the mind. The vibration of the subtle, psychic Pranagives rise to the formation of thought. By Pranayama (control of Prana or restraint of breath), youcan also increase the mental energy and develop thought-control and thought-culture. This will helpconcentration and meditation. This will make the mind steady. This will remove Rajas and Tamas(passion and inertia). This will burn the dross in the mind.Pratipaksha BhavanaIf you think again and again on impure things, an evil thought gains new strength byrepetition. It gets the force of momentum. You must drive them immediately. If you find it difficultto do so, entertain counter-thoughts of God. Cultivate sublime and elevating thoughts. Evilthoughts will die by themselves. A noble thought is a potent antidote to counteract an evil thought.This is easier than the former method. By repetition of Godís Name thousands of times daily, goodthoughts gain new strength by each repetition. By repeating ëAham Brahma Asmií thousand timesdaily, the idea that you are the spirit (Atman) becomes stronger. The idea that you are the bodybecomes weaker and weaker.Control of Body and SpeechIf you are not able to control any evil thought, control the body and speech first. Slowly youwill gain mental strength and will-force and will be able to control the thoughts gradually. If, for amoment you think you will not succeed in vanquishing an evil thought, at once get up and set aboutsome work involving physical labour. One effort after another will make gradually the task easyand, in a few weeks, you will obtain a complete control over your thoughts.Control the physical body and the speech first. Then slowly proceed to control thoughts. Donot speak ill of others. Control the Indriya of speech first. Gradually the mind will not think ill ofothers. The mind will say unto itself: ìWhy should I think ill of others when the organ of speech isnot prepared to express what I think?î You can control your actions only when you have becomemoral. When you speak ill of a man, you poison the mind of several people. It is extremely ignobleto speak ill of others. But just comment without hatred or malice is permissible occasionally.Do not allow useless or evil thoughts to develop themselves into words. Curb the speech.Divert the mind at once to some good thoughts. Try to remember some Slokas from the Gita orrepeat some prayers. Keep some ëword-imageí as ìOm Hari,î ìOm Siva,î ìOm Narayana.îObservance of Mouna (vow of silence) for a couple of hours daily will check the impulses of speechand thinking, will conserve energy and help meditation and thought-control and thought-culture.VigilanceFully realise for yourself the grave and ruinous consequences of evil thoughts. This will setyou on your guard when the evil thoughts would come. The moment they come, exert yourself ordivert the mind to some other object of divine thoughts, prayer or Japa.

Evil thinking is the beginning or startingpoint of adultery. Through a lustful look only, you have already committed adultery in the heart.Mental actions are the real actions. Remember this. God judges a man by his motives; worldlypeople judge a man by his external physical actions. You will have to look to the motive of the man.Then you will not be mistaken.

Avoid loose talk andgossip. Fill the mind with sublime thoughts, such as those contained in the Gita, the Upanishads, theYogavasishtha, etc.Sattvic Background of ThoughtThe vast majority of people will always want something concrete to hold on to, somethingaround which, as it were, to place their ideas, something which will be the centre of allthought-forms in their minds. That is mindís very nature. A background of thought is needed forfixing the mind.Have a Sattvic background of thought or mental image. The mind assumes the shape of anyobject it intently thinks upon. If it thinks of an orange, it assumes the shape of an orange. If it thinksof Lord Krishna with flute in hand, it assumes the shape of Lord Krishna. You must train the mindproperly and give it proper, Sattvic food for assimilation.You must have Sattvic background of thought to take you to the goal (salvation). If you are adevotee of Lord Krishna, have a background of thought of His picture and the repetition of Hisfamous Mantra ìOm Namo Bhagavate Vasudevayaî and His qualities (Form-formula-qualities). ANirguna Upasaka (Vedantin) should have a background of thought of ëOMí and its meaning(Infinite Ocean of Light, Satchidananda, Vyapaka, Paripurna Atman). Work in the world, and themoment the mind is free, begin to think of the background of thoughtó either Saguna or Nirgunabackground according to taste, temperament and capacity for Sadhana. By constant thinking, ahabit in the mind will be formed and, without effort, the mind will run towards the background ofthought.It is a pity that the vast majority of persons have no ideal, no programme of life at all and noSattvic background of thought. They are doomed to destruction. The background of thought of ayoung married lady is usually lustful. The background of thought of an old mother is the affectiontowards her sons and grandsons. The background of thought of the vast majority of persons ishatred and jealousy. Even the so-called educated persons with many university qualifications,which is only husk when compared with spiritual knowledge, have no ideal, no programme of lifeand no background of thought.

Old habits of loose thinking must be replaced bycultivating fresh habits of good thoughts. At first, a tendency to think of good thoughts will beformed. By continued practice, a positive definite habit of thinking of virtuous, helping thoughtswill be developed. You will have to struggle very hard. The old habits will try to recur again andagain. Till you are firmly established in the habit of thinking of good thoughts only, you will have tofill the mind again and again with Sattvic thoughts, divine thoughts, thoughts of the Gita, LordKrishna, Lord Rama, the Upanishads, etc. New grooves and avenues will be formed now.

New Samskaras will be formed.GLORY OF THE WAVELESS JNANINThrough constant and intense practice, you can become waveless (thought-free). Thewaveless Yogin helps the world more than the man on the platform. Ordinary people can hardlygrasp this point. When you are waveless, you actually permeate and pervade every atom of theuniverse, purify and elevate the whole world. The names of waveless Jnanins such as Jada Bharataand Vamadeva are even now remembered. They never built Ashrams. They never lectured. Theynever published books. They never made disciples. Yet, what a tremendous influence thesewaveless Jnanins had produced on the minds of the people. Glory to such waveless Jnanins!Chapter 20VASANASVASANASóHOW THEY MANIFESTVasana (desire in subtle form) is a wave in the mind-lake. Its seat is the Karana Sarira. Itexists there in the form of a seed and manifests in the mind-lake. Just as flowers are latent in seeds,Vasanas are latent in the Antahkarana and the Karana Sarira (seed-body). Daily new flowersblossom out. They fade out in a day or two. Similarly, Vasanas blossom out like flowers one by one,come out to the surface of the mind, generate Sankalpas in the mind of Jivas and goad them to striveto possess and enjoy the particular objects of enjoyment. Vasanas cause actions, and actions83MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"strengthen the Vasanas. This is a Chakra, vicious circle. On the advent of knowledge of Brahman,all Vasanas are fried out. The real enemies are the Vasanas within. Annihilate them. Eradicatethem. They are inveterate.The whole mango tree with branches, leaves and fruits is contained in a subtle form in theseed. It takes time for manifestation. Even so, the Vasana of lust lurks in the mind when you are aboy, manifests at 18, fills the whole body at 25, works havoc from 25 to 45 and then it graduallydeclines. Various forms of wrong-doing and mischief are done by human beings between 25 and45. This is the most critical period of life. There is no particular difference between a boy and a girlin their characteristics when they are young. After attaining puberty they exhibit their characteristicqualities.CHAPALATAChapalata is Vasana of a mild type. It lasts for a short time only. There are two kinds ofimportant Chapalatas. There is the Jihva-Chapalata of the tongue where the tongue wants to eat thevarious things every now and then. It is a form of morbid appetite. Rich people who lead a luxuriouslife have this form of Chapalata. The other variety is the Upastha-Chapalata wherein the sexIndriyas wants to taste again and again the sexual enjoyment (Sparsa).VASANA CAUSES RESTLESSNESS AND BONDAGEVasana is the cause of restlessness of mind. As soon as a Vasana manifests, there is anintimate connection between the mind and the object through overflowing Vishaya-Vritti-Pravaha.The mind will not retrace its steps till it gets the object and enjoys it. The restlessness will continuetill the object is enjoyed. The Vritti will flow towards the object till it is obtained and enjoyed. Thecommon run of men cannot resist or suppress any Vasana owing to weak will.It is the Vasana in the mind that causes attraction towards objects and brings about bondage;with the disappearance of Vasanas, bondage naturally vanishes. There will not be any attraction,admiration or excitement for any object outside, if there is no Vasana inside your mind. It is theVasana that is at the bottom of all your miseries and troubles. There is no pain from Isvara-Srishti(objects created by the Lord). Water quenches your thirst. Breeze gives you comfort. Sunshineenlivens you. Fire gives warmth. It is Jiva-Srishti that brings about bondage. Ahankara, anger,Abhimana, attachment are all Jiva-Srishtis. Have Suddha Sankalpa, but no Vasanas.By mere ethical training, jealousy, Raga, Dvesha, Krodha, Kama, etc., can be suppressedthough not eradicated completely. These impure, Asubha Vasanas can be considerably attenuated(Tanu-Avastha) by moral culture. They attain a subtle condition. They cannot harm the individual.They remain under perfect control.ERADICATION, NOT SUPPRESSION, THE PROPER REMEDYA Vasana may be suppressed for the time being by an aspirant. But it again manifests withredoubled force when a suitable opportunity arises. Like a minister obeying the king, the fiveorgans of the body act in accordance with the dictates of the mind. Therefore, you should through84VASANAS"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"your own pure mind and proper efforts eradicate the Vasanas for objects. You should rend asunder,the long rope of Vasanas tied to the vessels of man, whirled on the ocean of Samsara, throughenormous efforts on your part. Vasanas should be thoroughly eradicated. If these Vasanas aredestroyed by Vichara (enquiry of Atman) and discrimination, the mind which is ever restless willget quiescence like a gheeless lamp.HOW TO DESTROY VASANASSamaVijnanamaya Kosa serves as a great fortress for the aspirant. From there he can attack theVasanas when they try to emerge from the seed-body (Karana Sarira) into the mind. Through thepractice of Sama, the aspirant should destroy the Vasanas one by one with the help of VijnanamayaKosa (Buddhi). He should crush them as soon as they try to raise their heads on the surface of themind-lake. He must not allow them to sprout forth. This is Vasana-Tyaga. This attack or fight isfrom inside.When a Vasana or Sankalpa arises in the mind, the mind gives a push to the Antar-Indriya.From the Antar-Indriyas, this push is communicated to the Bahyakaranas (external instruments)such as hands, legs, eyes, ears, etc. The practice of Sama stops this very push which is the root causeof motion of all the Indriyas and Karanas.Sama is peace of mind produced by the eradication of the Vasanas (Vasana-Tyaga). TheAntahkarana of a man who possesses this virtue is cooler than ice. Even the coolness of the mooncannot compete with coolness of the Antahkarana of a man of Sama. Generally, the Antahkarana ofa worldling is a blazing furnace. A man of Sama is neither exalted when he gets a desired object(Ishta) nor depressed when he gets an undesired thing (Anishta). He keeps a balanced mind always.He has no enemies. The happiness of an emperor is nothing, nothing when compared with thesupreme spiritual bliss of a man of Sama. Sama is one of the four sentinels of Moksha. If you haveSama, you will get the company of the other three friends, viz., Santosha (contentment), Vichara(enquiry into Atman) and Satsanga (association with the wise and saintly).DamaThe attack should commence from outside also. Bahyavritti-Nigraha should be donethrough Dama (restraint of the Indriyas). You must not allow sense-vibrations to enter from outsideinto the mind through the avenues of Indriyas. This is also necessary. Sama alone is not sufficient.The senses must be rendered blunt by Dama. The Vasana for sweets, for instance, should bedestroyed by Sama through Vasana-Tyaga, by crushing the Vasanas within as soon as a desirearises; and the Bahyavritti, which arises by the sight of sweetmeat should be destroyed bywithdrawing the eyes from the same when you move about the bazaar and by giving up takingsugar. Dama supplements Sama in the control of mind. Dama is an auxiliary for the completeeradication of Vasanas.If you give up an old habit of taking tea, you have controlled to a certain extent the sense oftaste. You have destroyed one Vasana. This will give you some peace, because the craving for tea85MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"has gone and you are freed from your efforts and thinking in getting tea, sugar, milk, etc. Thinkingis pain, seeing is pain, hearing is pain for a philosopher and a Sadhaka. It is all pleasure for aworldling. The energy that was agitating you to run after tea is now transmuted into will. You gainpeace and will-power by giving up one thing. If you give up fifteen things, your peace of mind willbe still greater and the will still more powerful. This is the fruit of Tyaga. So, you are not a loser inTyaga. You gain more knowledge, more bliss and more power. You give up something in favour ofsomething higher. Is there anyone who will not give up black sugar in favour of white sugar? If youonce control one Vasana, it will be easy for you to control other Vasanas too, because you gainstrength and power.Svadhyaya and MeditationIncrease your Sastra-Vasana in the beginning. Occupy your mind with the study of standardphilosophical books. Thereby you can decrease your Deha-Vasana (thought of the body) andLoka-Vasana (desire for name and fame, Kirti, Pratishtha, etc). Later on, you will have to give upSastra-Vasana also. You must entirely devote all your time and energy in meditation and meditationalone. Vasana-Kshaya (destruction of Vasanas) is caused through well-conducted deliberation(Vichara), Brahma-Dhyana, Vairagya and Tyaga.Vichara and Brahma-BhavanaThe wise know that the mind associated with Vasana tends to bondage while the mindabsolutely free from Vasana is said to be an emancipated one. Just as a lion that is shut up in a cageemerges out by breaking the bars of the cage, so also a Jnani comes out of this cage of physical bodyvictoriously by breaking or by destroying the Vasanas of the mind through constant Vichara (Atmicenquiry), constant Nididhyasana (profound and constant meditation on ëOMí and its meaning) andBrahma-Bhavana. The more you attenuate your Vasanas by Svarupa-Bhavana or theBrahma-Bhavana, the happier you will become. In proportion to the thinning of the Vasanas, themind also is proportionately thinned out. Mind is nothing but a bundle of Vasanas. Mind is no otherthan the Vasanas which generate an endless series of rebirths. The true nature of the mind is theVasanas. The two are synonymous.Conquest of AhankaraIf you destroy egoism (Ahankara, this false little ëIí) and control the Indriyas (the senses),the Vasanas will die by themselves. The root cause for all troubles is Ahankara. Just as thedependants of a family hang upon the chief of the houseó the fatherósimilarly, all Vasanas,Trishnas, Kamanas, etc., hang upon Ahankara, the chief of this house-body.Constantly generate from the Sattvic mind-battery theAkhanda electric current ëAhamBrahmasmií-Vritti (BrahmakaraVritti). That is the potent antidote. Keep it safe in the pocket; smellit when an apoplectic attack of the Ahankaric false ëIí idea overcomes you. It is only when youeradicate the painful Ahankara of the mind and conquer the foes of organs (Indriyas) that theever-waking Vasanas will subside.86VASANAS"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"THE MEANING OF MOKSHAThe illusory Samsaric Vasanas that have arisen through the practice of many hundreds oflives never perish except through the practice of Yoga for a long time. Therefore, O Aspirants!After having put away at a distance the desire of enjoyment by discriminative efforts, practise thestate of mind absolutely devoid of Vasana.Moksha does not mean physical separation from all worldly affairs, but only a state of mindbereft of all impure Vasanas or clinging to worldly things, but yet working as usual amidst them.You must realise God in and through the world. This is the central teaching of the Gita. ìBut thedisciplined (lower) self, moving among sense-objects with senses free from attraction andrepulsion and mastered by the higher Self, goeth to Peaceî (Gita. II-64). This is the central teachingof Yoga Vasishtha also.There is no Vasana in Brahman. Complete annihilation of the Vasanas takes place only inNirvikalpa Samadhi. Only Nirvikalpa Samadhi can completely fry up the seeds of impure Vasanas.Through the knowledge of Brahman, there will be an extinction of all Vasanas, which form themedium of enjoyments. With the extinction of all Vasanas, the undaunted mind will get quiescencelike a gheeless lamp.CHAPTER 21DESIRESìSweep out the sphere of your mind:Make a place for Loved One to sit.Dust out all thoughts of this worldSo that His throne may be fit.A million desires engulf you,A million ambitions and aims:How can you make room for His PresenceUnless they vacate His domain?îWHAT IS DESIRE?Desire is a mode of the emotive mind. It has got a power of externalising the mind. Desire isthe fuel; thought is the fire. The thought-fire is kept up by the desire-fuel. If you withdraw thesupply of fuel, the fire will be withdrawn into its womb. If you stop thinking by cutting off desires,the mind will be withdrawn into Brahman.It is only when the mind, being divested of all its desires, is indifferent to pleasures andpains and is not attracted by any object that it will be rendered pure, free from the grip of the greatdelusion like a bird freed from its cage and roaming freely in the Akasa.87MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Desire, thought and Ahankara form one vicious circle.

Destroy any one of the links; the whole chain willbe broken.WHY DO DESIRES ARISE?Why do desires arise in the mind? On account of Ananda-Abhava (absence of Ananda orspiritual bliss). The cause for desire is the existence of objects outside. Curiosity becomes a desirein the mind. Interest and feeling precede a desire. Hope and expectation fatten the desire.VIKSHEPAóTHE VERY NATURE OF MINDJust as heat is inseparable from fire, Vikshepa or the tossing of the mind is inseparable fromthe mind. It troubles the Sadhakas a lot. It destroys all of a sudden the determinations ofstrong-willed persons also. The mind ceases to exist if it is destitute of this oscillation. Thisfluctuating mind alone creates the universe. Even Mala (impurity) can be removed easily. Itdemands strenuous efforts for a protracted time on the part of the Sadhaka to remove this Vikshepa.The undaunted Uddalaka suffered a lot from this distracting Vikshepa when he tried to enter intoNirvikalpa state. Raja Bhartrihari underwent the same difficulty when he tried to overcome thistroublesome fluctuating Sakti of the mind. Vikshepa is Maya. Vikshepa is impure Vasana(Asuddha Vasana). You will have to destroy this Vikshepasakti by constant Upasana or Yoga orceaseless Atmic enquiry (Brahmavichara). Then, peace (Santi) will come by itself.TYPES OF DESIREDesire in the mind is the real impurity. Sexual desire, vulgar attraction for the opposite sex,is the greatest impurity. This causes the real bondage. You can even give up wife, children andwealth. But, it is extremely difficult to give up ambition, name and fame. Ambition is a seriousobstacle in the path of Yoga. This is the most powerful weapon of Maya with which she slaughtersworldly-minded persons. Even if there is a tinge of desire for name and fame, Truth will notmanifest. Truth will shine by Itself. It does not need any pompous advertisement. It is the very Selfof all beings and objects.ANIRBUDDHA OR SUBTLE, HIDDEN DESIRESEven after you have renounced all the desires, there may remain in the mind some subtle,hidden desires (Sukshma, Anirbuddha) that cannot be comprehended. These are very dangerousones. Therefore, you will have to be very, very careful. The lurking under-currents of desires willthrow you down at any moment if you are not very vigilant and cautious, will destroy your Vairagya(dispassion) and will bring about your downfall eventually. I have witnessed many Yogabhrashtaswho had fallen from Yoga owing to the overpowering influence of these subtle, hidden desires. Solong as you have these subtle, hidden, Anirbuddha (unnoticeable) desires in your mind, you cannever dream of entering into the Nirvikalpa state without any modification of the mind. You cannever develop real Paravairagya (supreme non-attachment and dispassion) also.88DESIRES"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"CRAVING OR TRISHNAYou may become old, your hairs may turn grey, but your mind is ever young. The capacitymay vanish, but the craving remains even when you have reached advanced senility. Cravings(Trishna) are the real seeds of birth. These craving-seeds give rise to Sankalpa and action. Thewheel of Samsara is kept revolving by these cravings. Nip them in the bud. Then only will you besafe. You will get Moksha. Brahma-Bhavana, Brahma-Chintana, meditation on OM and devotionwill root out these craving-seeds which are laid deep. You will have to dig them out properly invarious corners and burn them beyond resurrection.

A man with gross Vyavaharic Buddhi can hardly understandthese terms. A subtle, pure intellect is needed. Suppose you were a terrible smoker for the lastfifteen years. Then you gave up smoking for five years. The craving for smoking also died. Supposeone of your friends offers you a cigar in the sixth year. You have no craving for smoking now. If youtake it now and enjoy it just to please your friend, it will be called a Suddha Bhoga only. You haveenjoyed it without a craving or a desire. Isvara enjoys Suddha Bhoga.SATISFACTION OF DESIRE YIELDS ILLUSORY HAPPINESS ONLYDesire excites the mind and senses. When desire is gratified by enjoyment of the objects ofdesire, satisfaction (Tripti) comes in temporarily. Rapture is delight in the attainment of the desiredobject. Bliss is the enjoyment of the taste of what is attained. Where rapture is there is bliss; butwhere bliss is there is not, quite of necessity, rapture. Rapture is like a weary traveller who hears orsees water or a shady wood. Bliss is the enjoying of the water or entering the forest shade.When there is desire, then alone is there pleasure. The cause for pleasure is desire. Whenthere is no desire, there cannot be any pleasure. When there is no hunger, delicious food can giveyou no pleasure. When there is no thirst, any refreshing beverage will have no effect. So, hunger isthe best sauce. The first cup of hot milk gives pleasure. The second cup induces disgust. After theenjoyment is over, Tripti comes. Hence, disgust arises when the second cup is taken. There is noreal pleasure in milk. The happiness is in Atman only. It is reflected in the object (milk) owing toignorance, owing to Bhranti (illusion). It is Bhranti-Sukha. If there were real happiness in milk, itshould induce pleasure always and in every person. It is not the case.A desire arises in the mind. There is a Vritti now. This Vritti agitates your mind till you getsatisfaction through enjoyment of the desired object. There is Santi or peace or happiness after theenjoyment is over. Another desire arises in the mind. Now, in the interval between the gratificationof one desire and the manifestation of another, there is pure bliss, because there is no mind then. It isat rest. You are in union with Brahman. That state of pure bliss between two desires is Brahman. Ifyou can prolong that period of bliss through Sadhana by keeping up the idea of Brahman and by notallowing another Vritti or desire to crop up, you will be in Samadhi. The period between one Vrittiand another Vritti is the real Sandhi (juncture).89MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"DESIRES ARE INSATIABLEMind plays havoc through desires. As soon as a desire arises, you think you will get allhappiness by its realisation. You exert yourself to achieve the desired object. As soon as you get it, alittle satisfaction (false Tushti or gratification) is experienced for a short time. Again, mindbecomes restless. It wants new sensations. Disgust and dissatisfaction come in. Again, it wantssome new objects for its enjoyment. That is the reason why this world is termed as mere Kalpana(imagination) by Vedantins.Desires are innumerable, insatiable and unconquerable. Enjoyment cannot bring insatisfaction. It is a mistake to think so. Enjoyment fans the desire. It is like pouring ghee in fire.Enjoyment strengthens, increases and aggravates a desire. See the case of Raja Yayati of yore. Heborrowed the youthful state from his son to have sexual enjoyment for thousands of years. At last,he cries out in his old age with bitterness, ìAlas! What a fool I am! Still my sexual desires arewaxing. There is no end of desires. I have wasted my life. O God! Have mercy on me. Lift me upfrom this mire of Samsara.î This comes in Mahabharata. In the Gita, Chapter III-39, you will findìKama-rupena Kaunteya Dushpurena-analena chaódesire which is insatiable as a flame.îFREEDOM FROM DESIRES NECESSARY FOR JNANAYou can attain Jnana only if you are free from sensuous desires and immortal mental states.Aloofness of body from sensuous objects and aloofness of mind from immoral states of mind areneeded for the attainment of Jnana. Then only will Divine Light descend. Just as a bungalow iscleaned of cobwebs and all kinds of dirts and the garden of all its weeds for the reception of theViceroy, the mental palace should be cleansed of all vices, desires and immoral states for thereception of the Holy Brahman, the Viceroy of viceroys.When a desire arises in the mind, a worldling welcomes it and tries to fulfil it; but, anaspirant renounces it immediately through Viveka. Wise people consider even a spark of desire as avery great evil. Therefore, they will not entertain any kind of desire. They will be ever delightful inAtman only.HOW TO CONTROL DESIRESIn this ocean of Samsara, desires are the crocodiles. Kill them as soon as they arise on thesurface of the mind. Do not yield to them. Do not become despondent under your trials. Makefriendship with the pure, Sattvic mind and destroy the impure mind with the help of the pure mind.Make your mind rest in the blissful Atman. Desires should be crushed the very moment they arise inthe mind, by discrimination and dauntless, indefatigable efforts.Whenever a desire arises in the mind, consult always your Viveka (power ofdiscrimination). Viveka will at once tell you that the desire is attended with pain, that it is only avain temptation set up by the mind and that Vairagya and Tyaga alone can bring about satisfactionand peace of mind. It will advise you to renounce the desire immediately and take to the study ofUpanishads, repetition of OM and to have Samadhi-Nishtha in a solitary place on the bank of thesacred Ganga. Think deeply again and again whether the new desire will give you more happiness90DESIRES"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"or more spiritual gain.

It will produce slavishmentality, weak will and attachment. Asking is begging. Recommending is begging. A beggar isabsolutely unfit for freedom and spiritual pursuits.Just as you starve a plant by depriving it of water, so you may starve out obnoxious desiresby allowing the mind not to dwell upon such desires. You have no desire for a thing till you knowwhat it is like. It is only after you have seen it or heard of it or touched it that you get a longing for it.Therefore, the best principle for a man is not to take, touch or see anything that is likely to taint theimagination. You will have to turn aside the attention resolutely and particularly the imaginationfrom the subject. In course of time, all objectionable desires will die out.It is desire in the mind that has created this body. The nature of the desire depends upon thequality of Samskaras. If these are good, virtuous Samskaras, good desires will crop up and, if theyare bad, they will give rise to evil desires. Buddhi also is Karmanusarini (according to the nature ofKarmas). It has to be specially trained by repeated efforts to think and act according to the holyinjunctions of sacred scriptures. Desire becomes the thought and thought becomes the action. Anevil desire sets up an evil thought which leads to evil action. Do always virtuous actionócharity,Tapas, Japa, Dama, Dhyana and study of scriptures. Give up Nishiddha Karma (actions prohibitedby Sastras). Have constant Satsanga. This is very important. It is the only means of changing theevil Samskaras of the mind.The mind with half-developed Jnana feels severe pain when it relinquishes all desires. Itdemands aid, through prayer, from higher souls.A counter-desire, a desire for God, one strong desire to attain Brahman will destroy all otherworldly desires. Put down vicious desires through virtuous desires. Then give up virtuous desiresthrough one strong desireóMumukshutva (desire for liberation). Abandon this desire for God alsoin the long run. Give up Asubha Vasana through Subha Vasana. Give up Subha Vasana throughSvarupa Vasana. Give up Svarupa Vasana by Nididhyasana. Desires will become extinct with therise of discrimination. When desires cease, Jivahood becomes extinct.Brahma-Chintana will destroy all desires. There are no desires in Brahman. Brahman isAll-Purity. Repeat OM. Repeat the Mantra, ìAll purity I am.î All the desires will vanish.Kill the thoughts. Practise thoughtlessness. You can destroy desires.

Raga and Dvesha (like and dislike or love and hatred or attraction andrepulsion) are the two currents in the mind which bind a man to the Samsaric wheel of birth anddeath. Raga and Dvesha are the two Doshas or faults in the mind that have brought you to thisworld. The Svarupa of Bandha (bondage) is Raga and Dvesha. The Svarupa of Ajnana is Raga andDvesha. All the emotions come under the category of Raga-Dvesha. These two currents are theDharma (characteristics) of the mind and not of the spirit. Pleasure and pain, Harsha and Soka,exhilaration and depression are due to Raga-Dvesha. If Raga and Dvesha vanish from the mind,Harsha-Soka also will disappear.SELFISH LOVE AND DIVINE LOVEWhen two forces of equal quality or power meet, a third force is formed. When two peopleof equal force and quality are attracted towards each other, a third force is formed between them.That is termed love. This is the scientific way of explaining what love is. Attraction is92DESIRES"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Akarshana-Sakti. Repulsion is Vikarshana-Sakti. When I see myself in another man, when I seehim as my own self, I begin to love him as my own self. When I find something in you that I myselfpossess, I am naturally drawn towards you and begin to love you. This is Vedantic way ofexplaining love. Love is pouring forth oneís affection (Prema) on another. Love is God. Love is oftwo kinds, viz., selfish or physical love and real Love or divine Love which is unselfish and lasting.The first kind is love with attachment. The second one is love without attachment. He who is a realaspirant of Vedantic path, who feels his own self everywhere and a real Bhakta who sees Narayanaeverywhere in everything can really love others. When an inferior person hangs on another personfor his happiness or existence, physical attachment crops up. Attachment causes slave mentalityand weak will. Attachment is death. Physical love is death.ìAsangasastrena dridhenachhitvaóCut all sorts of attachment by the sword of non-attachment.î (Gita, XV-3)RAGA AS PAINFUL AS DVESHARaga (attraction) in the mind is as much dangerous as Dvesha (hatred or repulsion).Whenever there is Raga, there is Dvesha also. Not only the Dvesha-Vritti (the modification ofdislike), but also the Vritti of Raga gives pain to man. If an object gives pleasure, you get Raga forthe object. But when there is Viyoga (separation) from the object, as in the case of death of yourdear wife or son, you get immense pain which is indescribable. Suppose you are in the habit oftaking fruits after food. Fruits give you pleasure. You get Raga (liking) for fruits. But if you cannotget fruits in a place, you get pain.Whenever there is pleasure and Raga, there exist side by side fear and anger. Anger is only amodification of desire. Fear and anger are two old associates of pleasure and Raga. Fear and angerare hidden in Raga. They constantly torment the mind.Fear is hidden in Raga. When you have got Raga for body, fear of death comes in. When youhave Raga for money, there is fear of losing money, as money is the means of getting objects ofenjoyment. When you have Raga for a woman, you always take care in protecting her. Fear is a veryold, intimate friend of Raga.THE DIFFERENT STATES OF RAGA-DVESHARaga-Dvesha has four Avasthas, viz., Dagdha (burnt up), Tanu (attenuated or thinned out),Vicchinna (concealed) and Udara (fully expanded). The first two states pertain to a Yogin; the lasttwo to worldlings. In a fully developed Yogin, the Vrittis of Raga-Dvesha are burnt up byNirvikalpa Samadhi. They are Dagdha (like burnt-up seeds). In a Yogin who is practising, theimpressions of Raga-Dvesha are tenuous. They are in a fine state. He has control over these twoVrittis. In those who are given to enjoyments (ordinary mortals), they are concealed and fullyexpanded. In the Vichhinna state, they are concealed. When the wife shows affection to herhusband, when the Raga-Vritti is in operation, her anger and hatred remain concealed for the timebeing. The moment she gets displeased with him for some reason or other, the Dvesha-Vrittimanifests itself. In the last (expanded) state, the Samskaras of Raga-Dvesha, having favourablesurroundings, attain to great activity. A worldly-minded man is a mere slave of Raga-Dveshacurrents. He is tossed about hither and thither by these two currents of attraction and repulsion.93MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"In sleep, these two emotions exist in a man in a Bija state (seed form). They are notdestroyed. As soon as the man gets up from sleep, they begin to operate again.In children, these twin currents manifest for a short time and disappear soon. They fight inthis second and join together with joy the very next second. They do not keep up any ill feelings intheir minds. They do not brood also over the wrongs done by others. They do not exhibit anygrudge. The wave comes and passes away. As the child grows, these currents assume a grave phaseby constant repetition and become inveterate.Dvaita slowly develops when the child reaches the second year. Place a baby within oneyear of age in any place. It will remain there like a block of stone. It will laugh and see alike allpeople without any Raga-Dvesha. Ask a child of two years of age to sit. It will stand. Ask the childto come near. It will recede back to a distance. Tell the child, ìDo not go to the streetî; it willimmediately march to the street. It will do contrary actions, because Dvaita is developing now in thechild.THE CAUSES OF RAGA-DVESHARaga-Dvesha is due to the Anukula-Pratikula Jnana. You have Raga for things favourable(Anukula) and Dvesha for things unfavourable (Pratikula). When this Anukula-Pratikula Jnanawhich depends upon Bheda Jnana disappears, Raga-Dvesha will vanish.Raga-Dvesha is also due to Abhimana-Ahankara. As soon as Abhimana manifests, therecomes Raga-Dvesha. When you conceive yourself as husband, there comes the attachment (Raga)for your wife. As soon as you conceive yourself to be a Brahmin, there comes the love of theBrahmins. Give up Abhimana, if you want to eradicate Raga-Dvesha. If this Abhimana, the resultof Avidya (ignorance) vanishes, Raga-Dvesha will vanish.Some minds hang on you through Raga, while some others hang on you through Dvesha.Ravanaís mind was hanging on Sri Rama through hatred and fear. He was seeing Rama everywhereand in everything through constant, intense thinking of Rama. Similarly, Kamsaís mind washanging on Sri Krishna. This is also a form of Bhakti (Vaira-Bhakti). Anyhow their minds were onGod.RAGA-DVESHA CONSTITUTES REAL KARMARaga-Dvesha in the mind is the real Karma. It is the original action. When the mind is set inmotion or vibration through the currents of Raga-Dvesha, real Karmas begin. Real Karmaoriginates from Sankalpas of the mind. It is the actions of the mind that are truly termed Karmas.External actions manifest later on. It is desire that sets the mind in motion. When there is a desire,Raga and Dvesha exist side by side in the mind. Desire is a motive force. Emotions and impulsesco-exist with desire.From Avidya emanates Aviveka (non-discrimination). From Aviveka originates Ahankaraand Abhimana. From Abhimana emanates Raga-Dvesha. From Raga-Dvesha comes Karma. From94RAGA-DVESHA"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Karma comes the body.

He is the real King of kings, Emperor of emperors. The chief Linga ordistinguishing mark of a Jivanmukta or a liberated soul is freedom from Raga-Dvesha. Even if aJnanin or Yogin sometimes exhibits traces of anger, it is Abhasamatra (mere appearance). Just asthe impression made in water with a stick passes away soon, as also the anger will disappear in thetwinkling of an eye, even though it manifests in a Jnanin. This can hardly be understood by worldlypeople.He who has no Raga but possesses Titiksha (power of endurance) can do anything. He canmove about wherever he likes. He is as free as the atmospheric air. His happiness, freedom andpeace are unbounded. Their extent can hardly be imagined. The freedom and joy of suchSannyasins cannot be imagined by the poor, petty-minded worldlings.

They are two kinds of emotions thatpertain to the mind alone. It is the mind alone which brings pleasures and pains on itself and enjoysthem through its excessive inclination towards objects. Mind contracts during pain and expandsduring pleasure.Ahankara creates the body. Prana does all sorts of Cheshtas (efforts). Mind experiencespleasure and pain. If you perform actions through a stainless mind (with Akartri Bhava andNishkama Bhava), your body will not share their fruits.There are only facts, vibrations or phenomena outside. Prakriti is blind. Prakriti is quiteindifferent. There is neither pleasure nor pain in objects. It is all mental creation, mental perception,mental jugglery. It is only the mental attitude or certain kind of mental behaviour towards objectsthat brings joy or grief, pleasure and pain. Maya has her powerful seat in the imagination of themind.All pains are not equally felt. There is no pain when you are asleep. It is only when the mindis connected with the body that pains arise. It is the identification with the mind and body,Abhimana owing to Avidya, that causes pain.When the mind is intensely fond of anything, there will be no perception of pain even ifdestruction awaits the body. When the mind is completely drowned in any object, who else is thereto observe and flee from the actions of the body?When you put one drop of oil on the surface of water, it spreads throughout the surface ofwater and makes it oily. Even so, a little pain for a luxurious man spoils all his pleasures and makesall objects appear very painful. When you are in acute agony, a cup of coffee, milk or tea does notgive you any pleasure. When you are in acute agony, the whole world which appeared to you to befull of bliss while in good health, appears quite dreary. The world loses all its charms while you areseriously ailing.If the pessimist changes his mental attitude, the world will appear to him to be full ofAnanda.96RAGA-DVESHA"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Mind always runs after pleasure, because it is born of Ananda Brahman.

This love of the selfgives the clue to the fact that Ananda or bliss must be the nature of the Self.ATMAN HAS NO PLEASURE AND PAINFreedom from the body and mind is the real nature of the Self or Atman and, consequently,there being no possibility of virtue and vice, very much less is the chance for any effects of these onthe Atman, hence, pleasure and pain do not touch Atman. Atman is Asanga, Anaasakta, Nirlipta(unattached). It is Sakshi of the two modifications, pleasure and pain that arise in the mind. Mindenjoys. Mind suffers. Atman is a silent witness. It has nothing to do with pleasure and pain.SENSE-PLEASURE IS ONLY A MENTAL DECEPTIONPleasure and pain, beauty and ugliness are all false imaginations of the mind. Mind is a falseillusory product. Conceptions of the mind also must, therefore, be false. They are all Mrigatrishna(like a mirage in the desert). What is beautiful for you is ugly for another. Beauty and ugliness arerelative terms. Beauty is only a mental concept. It is only a mental projection. It is only a civilisedman that takes much of symmetry of form, good features, graceful gaits, elegance of manners,graceful form, etc. An African negro has no idea of all these things. Real beauty is in the Self only.Pleasure and beauty reside in the mind and not in the objects. Mango is not sweet; the idea of mangois sweet. It is all Vritti. It is all mental deception, mental conception, mental creation, mental Srishti.Destroy the Vritti; beauty vanishes. The husband stretches his own idea of beauty in his ugly wifeand finds his wife very beautiful through passion. Shakespeare has rightly expressed this in hisìMid-summer Nightís Dreamî: ìCupid is painted blind. It finds Helenís beauty in the brow ofEgypt.îPleasure arising from external objects is evanescent, transitory and fleeting. It is merenerve-titillation and mental deception. Jiva joins with mind and Vritti and enjoys the Vishayas(sense-objects). The thing that gives you pleasure gives you pain also.ìYe hi samsparsaja bhogaduhkhayonaya eva teóThe delights that are contact-born, are verily wombs of pain.î The body isan abode of misery and disease. Wealth brings a lot of trouble in acquiring and keeping safe. Sorrowsprings from every connection. Women are a perpetual source of vexation. Alas! People prefer thispath of misery to that of spiritual enjoyment.No true, lasting satisfaction comes from the enjoyment of worldly objects. Yet, people rushheadlong towards objects even when they know that the objects are unreal and the world is full ofmiseries. That is Maya. When the mind rests on Atman, then only Nitya-Tripti (eternal satisfaction)will come; because, Atman is Paripurna (all-full), you get everything there. It is self-contained. Alldesires are gratified by realisation of Atman.Some say that children are very happy. It is wrong. They only become exuberant. They getserious reaction also. They have no balanced mind. They weep for hours together for nothing at all.It is only a man of balanced mind that can really be happy.97MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"PLEASURE ARISES FROM VRITTI-LAYA:NOT FROM SENSE-OBJECTSReally, there is no pleasure in objects. Atman gives a push to the mind and sets it in motion.A Vritti or thought-wave arises in the mind on account of the force of a Vasana. The mind isagitated and runs towards the particular object. The agitation will not subside till the mind gets thedesired object. It will constantly think of the object. It will scheme and plan various methods toachieve the desired object. It will be ever restless. It will be ever assuming the shape of the object.As soon as the object is obtained and enjoyed, the particular Vritti that was causing agitation in themind gets dissolved. Vritti-Laya takes place. When Vritti-Laya takes place, you get peace andAnanda from the Svarupa or Atman within only and not from the object outside. Ignorant personsattribute their pleasures to external objects. That is a serious blunder, indeed.There is no happiness at all in any of the objects of the world. It is sheer ignorance to thinkthat we derive any pleasure from the sense-objects or from the mind. Whenever we feel our desiresare satisfied, we observe that the mind moves towards the heart, towards Atman. In pleasure also,there is exercise of the mind. It expands. It turns inward and moves to its original home, the place ofits origin, Atman and enjoys Atma-Sukha (Bliss of the Self).REAL HAPPINESS LIES WITHINWhy do you search, in vain, for your happiness, O worldly fools, outside, in objects, money,women, titles, honours, name and fame, which are false, worthless and like cow-dung? You cannotget your happiness there. You are entirely deluded. Search within the heart, subjectively in theAtman, the source and fountain of all happiness.Real happiness is within you. It is in the Atman. It is subjective. It is in the Sattva Guna andbeyond Sattva. It manifests when the mind is concentrated. When the Indriyas are withdrawn fromthe objects outside, when the mind is one-pointed (Ekagra), when there is Vasana-Kshaya(annihilation of the Vasanas) and Manonasa (annihilation of the mind), when you becomedesireless and thoughtless, Atmic bliss begins to dawn; spiritual Ananda begins to thrill.ATTACHMENT AND PLEASUREThe mind is the cause of attachment to delusive objects. It is the mind which is the germ ofall Karmas. It daily agitates this body of ours to work and secure for its enjoyment variouspleasurable objects.The mind always wants to be doing something and, when it attaches itself with the objects itcherishes, feels amused and happy. A play at cards has nothing in it; but, the attachment andattention produce pleasure.There can be attraction without attachment. You can be attracted by a beautiful cabbagerose or a young lady.

Palatable dishes, refreshing beverages, affectionate father andmother, brother, dear friends, diamonds, pearls, flowers, sandal, ornaments, soft beds, gardens hadno attraction for him. On the contrary, their very sight gave him intense pain.In Vairagya, Brahmacharya is Antargata (hidden). Vairagya includes celibacy in thought,word and deed.TWO KINDS OF VAIRAGYAVairagya (dispassion, indifference, non-attachment) is of two kinds, viz., (i) KaranaVairagya (Vairagya on account of some miseries) and (ii) Viveka-Purvaka Vairagya (Vairagya onaccount of discrimination between real and unreal). The mind of a man who has got the former typeof Vairagya is simply waiting for a chance to get back the things that were given up. As soon as thefirst opportunity offers itself, the man gets the downfall and goes back to his former state. Vishayadoes havoc in him with a vengeance and redoubled force from reaction. But the other man who hasgiven up the objects on account of Viveka, on account of illusory nature of objects, will havespiritual advancement. He will not have a downfall.HOW VAIRAGYA DAWNSNote how Vairagya arises in the mind. The transitory and perishable nature of all thingscreates a sort of disgust in all minds and, in proportion to the depth and subtlety of nature, thisreaction from the world works more or less powerfully in the mind of every individual. Anirresistible feeling arises in our mind, viz., that the finite can never satisfy the Infinite within us, thatthe changing and perishable cannot satisfy the changeless and deathless nature of ours.When you are not impressed with the idea of rich living, rich style of living cannot attractyou. When you are impressed with the idea that meat and wine are not at all pleasurable, they cannottempt you. In that case, if you do not get meat and wine or rich living, you will not be agonised at allin your mind. Why are you attracted towards a young, beautiful lady? Because, owing to yourignorance, you vainly think you will get pleasure through her. If you have got Viveka, it will at oncetell you that you will get immense pain through her. Then the mind will recede or withdraw from theobject, woman.SADHANA WITHOUT VAIRAGYA GOES TO WASTEWhen Vairagya appears in the mind, it opens the gate to Divine Wisdom. Fromdissatisfaction (with the sense-objects and worldly sense-enjoyments) comes aspiration. Fromaspiration comes abstraction. From abstraction comes the concentration of the mind. From theconcentration of the mind comes meditation or contemplation. From contemplation comesSamadhi or Self-realisation. Without dissatisfaction or Vairagya, nothing is possible.Just as cultivation in a stony land or saltish earth becomes absolutely fruitless, so also Yogicpractices and Atma-Vichara (enquiry of the Soul) done without Vairagya (dispassion and101MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"indifference to the sensual enjoyments) becomes fruitless. Just as water, when it leaks into therat-holes, instead of running into the proper channels in agricultural fields, becomes wasted anddoes not help the growth of plants, grains, etc., so also, the efforts of an aspirant become a wastage ifhe has not got the virtue Vairagya. He gets no spiritual advancement.INTENSE VAIRAGYA NECESSARY FOR MOKSHAThere must be intense (Tivra) Vairagya in the minds of the aspirants, throughout the periodof their Sadhana. Mere mental adhesion will not do for success in Yoga. There must be intenselonging for liberation, a high degree of Vairagya plus capacity for Sadhana (spiritual practice).Then only they will get Nirvikalpa Samadhi and Moksha. It was only Raja Janaka and Prahlada whohad Tivra Vairagya (intense dispassion). This kind of Vairagya is necessary for quick realisation. Itis very difficult to cross the ocean of Samsara with a dull type of Vairagya. The crocodile ofsense-hankering (Trishna) for sense-enjoyments and sense-objects will catch the aspirants by thethroat and, violently snatching away, will drown them half-way.ENEMIES OF VAIRAGYAThe Curse of AffectionDelusion proceeds from affection. It is a common observation that a person is distressed ifthe cat eats his domestic fowl; but when his affections are not touched, for instance, if the cat eats asparrow or a mouse, he expresses no sorrow. You must, therefore, root out affection, which is thecause of vain attachment. The body generates numerous germs which people are anxious toremove; but to one variety they give the name ìchildren,î for which their lives are wasted away.Such is the delusion of the world.At the back of affection and love, there is grief and sorrow. Affection is mixed with sorrow.At the back of pleasure, there is pain. Pain is mixed with pleasure. Man sows the poisonous seed ofsorrow under the name of love, from which quickly spring up shoots of affection which contain afire dangerous as lightning; and from these shoots, grow trees of sorrow with innumerable brancheswhich, burning like a heap of covered straw, slowly consume the body.The knot of affection is strengthened by long indulgence. Affection has entwined its threadsaround the hearts of men. The principal means to get rid of affection is to consider that this is afleeting existence. In this wide world, how many millions of parents, wives, children, uncles andgrandfathers have passed away. You should consider the society of friends as a momentary flash oflightning and, revolving this often in your mind, enjoy felicity.Hope and AnticipationHope and anticipation are the opposite of Vairagya and Tyaga. They fatten the mind. To beperfectly hopeless is a very high state for a philosopher. It is a very bad state for worldlings. Theyalways say with contempt: ìHe is a hopeless man.î Worldlings and philosophers move towardsdiametrically opposite poles.102VAIRAGYA AND TYAGA"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"HOW TO DEVELOP VAIRAGYAThose who do not develop the painless Vairagya inherent in oneís self and that with greatfelicity and happiness are, at best, but vermins in human shapes.

Even so,extricate yourself from the mindís sticking and clinging to this body and children-honey owing toRaga and Moha through Vairagya and meditation and fly away from this cage of flesh and bone tothe Source, Brahman or Absolute.It is very difficult to wean some children. They suck the breast even when they are three orfour years old. The mother applies some nim-paste to the nipples. The child is weaned quickly.Even so, you will have to get a medicine of nim-paste for the mind to get it weaned from sensualobjects. Sit in a solitary room. Think of the miseries of this earthly life, its cares, worries, anxieties,hunger, thirst, sins, temptations, passion, fighting, fears, vanity, disease, death, old age, sorrow,grief, tribulation, loss, failures, disappointments, hostility, scorpion stings, mosquito bites, etc. Thiswill serve as an efficient nim-paste to wean the mind from Samsara. You must think in theabove-manner daily.Remember constantly the pains of various kinds pertaining to this mundane existence.Moha will vanish if you repeat the following line of Chapter XIII of Gita several times daily:ìJanma-mrityu-jara-vyadhi-duhkha-dosha-anudarsanamóInsight into the pain and evil of birth, oldage and sickness.î Always make the mind understand clearly that there is only pain in this world.Reflect often on the instability of this world. This is the first Sadhana for aspirants. They can thusdevelop Vairagya. The mind will be weaned from objects. Attraction for sense-objects willgradually vanish.RENUNCIATION BRINGS ABOUT MOKSHAShun the earthly objects as fire or poison or offal. Renounce all desires and cravings. Thisitself is Moksha (freedom). Renunciation of desires brings about the annihilation of the mind.Annihilation of the mind brings on the destruction of Maya, because the mind alone is Maya. Mayais enthroned in the imagination of the mind. How cunning she is! A Viveki knows her tricks well.She is awfully afraid of the man of renunciation and Atmavichara. She bows to him with foldedhands.WHAT IS TRUE RENUNCIATION?The mind is the all-in-all and its mastery leads to the renunciation of all. Chitta-Tyaga aloneconstitutes the renunciation of all. True renunciation lies in the abnegation of the mind. It consists inrenouncing all desires and egoism and not world-existence. Through such a mental abnegation, youwill be able to free yourself from all pain. Then will come immortality in life or enjoyment of theinfinite delight of existence free from ego, founded on oneness of all in Brahman.103MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"SANNYASAóA MENTAL STATESannyasa is a mental state only.

Chudala was aqueen-Yogini-Sannyasini, though she was ruling a kingdom. That Sannyasin who lives in theforest, but who is full of passions is worse than a householder and a worldly-minded fool.Sikhidhvaja was a worldly man, though he lived in the forest naked for very many years.True renunciation is the renunciation of all passions, desires, egoism and Vasana.

Someone asked Guru Nanak, ìO saint, why have you not shaved yourhead? You are a Sannyasin.î Guru Nanak replied, ìMy dear friend, I have shaved my mind.î In fact,the mind should be cleanly shaved. Shaving the mind consists in getting rid of all sorts ofattachments, passions, egoism, Moha (infatuation), lust, greed, anger, etc. This is the real shaving.External shaving of the head has no meaning so long as there is internal craving, Trishna.Many have not understood what true renunciation is. Renunciation of physical objects is norenunciation at all. The real Tyaga (renunciation) consists in the renunciation of egoism(Ahankara). If you can renounce this Ahankara, you have renounced everything else in the world. Ifthe subtle Ahankara is given up, Dehadhyasa (identification with the body) automatically goesaway.Vedanta does not want you to renounce the world. It wants you to change your mental attitudeand give up this false, illusory ëIí-ness (Ahamta) and mineness (Mamata). The snake-charmer removesonly the two poisonous fangs of the cobra. The snake remains the same. It hisses, raises its hood andshows the teeth. In fact, it does everything as before. The snake-charmer has changed his mental attitudetowards the snake. He has a feeling now that it has got no poisonous fangs. Even so, you must removethe two poisonous fangs of the mind, viz., Ahamta and Mamata only. Then you can allow the mind to gowherever it likes. Then you will have always Samadhi only.You must renounce the Tyagabhimana also. The Tyagabhimana is very deep-rooted.

Will to see is the eye. Will to hear is the ear. The Indriyas(senses) have two states, static and dynamic. When the desire begins to operate, the Indriyas are putin motion. This is the dynamic state. As soon as the desire is gratified, the Indriyas shrink throughTripti (satisfaction). This is the static or passive state.Mind and Indriyas are one. Indriya is a prolongation of the mind. The sea is fed by the rivers;the sea cannot exist without the rivers. Even so, mind is fed by Indriyas and cannot exist withoutIndriyas. If you have controlled the Indriyas, you have already controlled the mind. Indriya isanother name for mind.Mind is a mass of Indriyas. Mind is a higher power than the Indriyas. Mind is a consolidatedIndriya. Indriya is mind in manifestation. Just as a minister obeys the king, so also, the fiveJnana-Indriyas act in accordance with the dictates of the mind. Indriyas represent backwaters. Thedesire in the mind to eat has manifested as tongue, teeth and stomach. The desire in the mind to walkhas manifested itself as legs and feet. If you can control mind, you can control the Indriyas.Eyes can only see. Ears can only hear. Tongue can only taste. Skin can only touch. Nose canonly smell. But, the mind can see, hear, taste, touch and smell. Mind is the common sensory. Thefive senses are blended there. It can directly see, hear, smell, taste and feel independent of thesenses. It is an aggregate of the five senses. All the sense-faculties are blended in the mind. You cansee and hear directly through the mind by Yogic practice (clairvoyance and clairaudience). Thisblows out the Western psychological theory of perception.Mind is termed the sixth sense:ìManah shashthanindri-yanióthe senses of which mind isthe sixthî (Gita, XV-7). The five senses are the five Jnana-Indriyas (organs of knowledge, sensationor perception).Ayatana means mind (Chhandogya Upanishad, IV-vii) which is the substratum of theexperiences of all other organs. Senses cannot do anything, if the mind is not connected with them.When you are wholly absorbed in the study of an interesting newspaper, you do not hear when yourfriend loudly calls you. You are not aware that the clock has struck five. It is everybodyís dailyexperience. The mind was away at that time. It was not then connected with the sense of hearing.The eyes may be wide open during sleep. They do not see anything, because the mind is not there.SISTER INDRIYASNose and anus are sister Indriyas. They are born of the same Prithvi-Tanmatra, nose fromthe Sattvic portion, anus from the Rajasic portion. These two Indriyas are the least mischievous.105MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"The olfactory sense and the olfactory nerve do not trouble you much.

Eyes and ears are entrance gates for the reception of forms and sounds.These are avenues of sense-knowledge (sight and hearing). Upastha Indriya (organ ofreproduction) and Guda (anus, organ of excretion) are exit gates. They throw out urine and faeces.TONGUE, THE MOST DIFFICULT TO CONTROLThe most mischievous and troublesome Indriya is the generative organ. Then comestongue. Then comes speech. Then comes ear. Then comes eye. Control of the organ of taste is farmore difficult than control of the genitals, because you have been enjoying delicious articles of foodeven from your very birth. Lust manifests itself just before eighteen. You indulge in sexual pleasureonly for a short period in every birth. But, you have to take food even in advanced senility. Controlof tongue means control of all Indriyas.Music, cinema, sight-seeing are enjoyed in human births only. Ants and rats do not enjoycinema-show. The Indriya of sight is not so powerful as the tongue.The organ of sight serves as a loving comrade to the organ of taste. The mind is at oncetickled at the sight of a yellow colour of the mango. The eyes see a beautiful mango and the differentdishes that are served on the table. At once, the glosso-pharyngeal nerves are stimulated. You getgood appetite and relish. The food is rendered more palatable.

Do not allowanything to enter the mind through these two doors of sense-knowledge.The object of Sadhana is to internalise the mind by introspection or Antarmukha Vritti andto realise the Truth within yourself. Control the three organs of eye, ear and tongue. Then you canbring the mind under discipline and prevent the mental energy from flowing externally. Theseorgans are the main causes of making the mind restive. Control over them helps the purpose ofconcentrating the energy internally.He is a real Kshatriya who wages internal war with the mind, who fights with the Indriyas,the Svabhava, through Viveka and will-force and obtains absolute mastery over the mind. He is areal Kshatriya who fights with the host of evil Samskaras and evil thoughts, the Rajasic andTamasic, by awakening and increasing the Sattva Guna. He is a real Kshatriya whose Sastra is Will,and Astra is Viveka, whose battle-field is within, whose band is chanting of Pranava and Udgitha ofthe Chhandogya Upanishad and whose coat-of-arms is the three qualifications, viz., Viveka,Vairagya and Mumukshutva.HOW TO CONTROL THE INDRIYASThere are six ways of controlling the Indriyas: (i) through Vichara, (ii) by will-force, (iii) byKumbhaka (retention of breath in Pranayama), (iv) by Dama (restraint), (v) by Pratyahara(abstention) and (vi) by Vairagya and Tyaga. Perfect control can be made only through Vichara.DamaDama is restraint of the Indriyas. Dama blunts the Indriyas. Perfect control of the senses isnot possible through Dama alone. If the senses are very sharp and acute, they carry away the mindsof even good Sadhakas impetuously, just as the gale carries away the ship in stormy weather (Gita,II-67). They can be controlled perfectly through the help of the mind, through Vichara.When you walk along Mount Road, Madras, each Indriya tries its level best to get hold of itsobjects of enjoyment and revelry. The Indriyas revolt vehemently if you do not procure them theseobjects. Tongue drags you to the coffee hotel or Hotel de Angelis. Tvak (skin) says, ìLet me go tothe Bombay Saitís shop and have a piece of fine China silk.î Ear says, ìLet me have a gramophoneor harmonium.î Nose says, ìLet me have a bottle ofOtto de Rose.î The mind is at the bottom ofthese Indriyas to instigate. A tumultuous internal fight goes on between the five organs ofknowledge, each trying to have a lionís share of enjoyment. Use Viveka, power of discrimination,always. Indriyas tempt and deceive you. Indriyas are the jugglers. Maya spreads her Moha-Jalathrough mind and Indriyas. Be on the alert.

You will developwill-power.Give up all luxurious food and all articles of sensuous enjoyment. Practise rigid penance.Tapas thins out the Indriyas and eventually leads to control of mind. If you give up tea, you havereally controlled a small portion of the mind; control of tongue really means control of mind.PratyaharaWhen the Indriyas give up the objects, they take up the form of the mind-stuff. They aredrawn into the mind. This is termed Pratyahara or abstraction. When the Indriyas are withdrawnfrom their respective objects, it is Indriya-Pratyahara. Mental abstraction takes place when the mindis disconnected with the Indriyas. Pratyahara is a general, broad term which includes Dama also.The effect of Dama (restraint of Indriyas) is Pratyahara.If you can do consciously Pratyahara at will, consciously attaching and detaching the mindto and from the senses, you have gained really a great control over the mind. You can check at anytime the outgoing tendencies or outgoing forces of the mind. Pratyahara is the stepping-stone toinner spiritual life. He who has succeeded in Pratyahara can concentrate his mind quite readily for avery long time. Dharana and Dhyana come automatically if Pratyahara is perfect. An aspirant has tostruggle hard to have mastery over Pratyahara. Perfect Vairagya is indispensable for success inPratyahara. You can succeed after strenuous and incessant struggle for some years. ìTatah paramavasyatendriyanamóThence arises the supreme control of the organsî (Patanjali Yoga Sutras,II-55). If Pratyahara is perfect, all the organs are under perfect control.During the period of Sadhana, do not mix much; do not talk much; do not walk much; do noteat much; do not sleep much. Observe carefully the five ëdo-notsí. Mixing will cause disturbancesin the mind. Talking much will cause distraction of the mind. Walking much causes exhaustion andweakness. Eating much induces Alasya and Tandri (laziness and sleepiness).Control of ThoughtóA Great DesideratumIf you have the reins of the horses under your control, you can have a safe journey. TheIndriyas are the horses. If you have the senses under your efficient control, you can have a safejourney in the path of Moksha. Indriyas cannot do anything without the help of the mind, theirmaster and commander. Control of the Indriyas means control of the mind only. Control of thoughtsleads to the control of mind and Indriyas also. It leads to the attainment of infinite bliss and eternallife. Control of thought is indispensableóa great desideratum for all.REMEMBER YOUR ORIGINAL HOMEO Mind! Do not ruin yourself by keeping company with the senses and their objects.Enough. Enough.

It distracts the mind. It keeps the mind alwaysBahirmukha (outgoing) and makes a man unspiritual. A vow of silence must be practised once aweek. Much energy is wasted in talking.The Vag-Indriya (organ of speech) seriously distracts the mind. ìSpeech is the fourth ëfootíof Mind-Brahman, because it is by means of the ëfootí of speech that the mind approaches thedenotable objects such as cow, goat, etc. Therefore speech is like a foot of mind. In the samemanner, nose is a ëfootí, because it is through nose that the mind approaches objects of smell.Similarly, the eye is a ëfootí; the ear is another ëfootí. This constitutes the four-footed character ofthe Mind-Brahmanî (Chhandogya Upanishad).Do not allow anything to come out from the mind through the Vag-Indriyas (organ ofspeech). Observe Mouna (a vow of silence). This will help you. Considerable peace followsMouna. The speech energy becomes transmuted into spiritual energy (Ojas). Sankalpas becomemuch decreased. Will becomes stronger. Now you have shut out a big source of disturbance. Youwill rest now in peace. Meditate on God or Brahman now in right earnest.Spiritual aspirants must observe Mouna for some hours daily.Be careful in the selection of your words before you speak. Think thrice before you speak.Consider what effect the words will produce on the feeling of others. Observe Mouna for a coupleof years. It is Tapas of speech.109MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Do not argue unnecessarily. Argument brings about hostility, heated feelings and wastageof energy.

Exaggeration is a modification of lie.Aspirants should not exaggerate. They should utter words with mathematical and scientificprecision.An aspirant is asked to give up company and observe Mouna, because on account of Raga,he will multiply acquaintance; on account of Dvesha, he will incur the displeasure of others byuttering some unpleasant words. There is a sword in the tongue. Words are like arrows. They injurethe feelings of others. By observing Mouna and giving up company, one can control theVag-Indriya and remove Raga. Then the mind will become calm.There are fifteen Doshas that arise from company. An aspirant should, therefore, preferablyremain alone during the period of Sadhana. The Doshas of company are: (1) Misunderstanding, (2)Ill-feeling, (3) Displeasure, (4) Raga-Dvesha, (5) Jealousy, (6) Vampirism, (7) Attachment, (8)Mental sharing of pain of another man, (9) Criticisms of others, (10) Anatma topics, (11) Habit oftalking, (12) Bahirmukha Vritti, (13) Idea and Samskara of duality, (14) Slavish mentality andweak will, (15) Contempt. Love little, but love long.When you take a vow of silence, never assert from within very often, ëI wonít talkí. Thiswill produce a little heat in the brain, because the mind wants to revenge on you. Simply once makea determination and then remain quiet. Attend to other affairs. Do not be thinking always, ëI woníttalk, I wonít talk.íIn the beginning, when you observe Mouna, you will find some difficulty. There will be asevere attack of Vrittis. Various kinds of thoughts will arise and force you to break the silence.There are all vain imaginations and deceptions of the mind. Be bold. Concentrate all energies onGod. Make the mind fully occupied. The desire for talk and company will die. You will get peace.The Vag-Indriya (organ of speech) considerably distracts the mind.MOUNA OF THE MINDMouna of the mind is far superior to Mouna of Vak (speech). Mouna should come of itself.It must be natural. Forced Mouna is only wrestling with the mind. It is an effort. If you live in Truth,Mouna will come of itself. Then only will there be absolute peace.What is wanted is natural Mouna and mental nudity. Physical nudity has no meaning. It isTamasic Tapas of fools, that is not countenanced by Sastras and reason. In a Jivanmukta or aliberated soul, nudity comes of itself as he is absorbed in Brahman, when he is in the SaptamaJnana-Bhumika (the seventh stage of knowledge).110MOUNA AND INTROSPECTION"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"INTROSPECTIONóWHAT IT IS AND WHAT IT DOESThe self-existent Brahman created the mind and senses with outgoing tendencies. The mindhas a pernicious habit of externalisation from time immemorial. So you behold the externaluniverse and not the internal Self. It is the Vikshepa-Sakti or Maya that draws you out. From yourchildhood, you are taught to look to the external world and not to the internal, psychic world. Youhave entirely lost the faculty of introspection. To have a comprehensive understanding of what isgoing on in the inner ëmental factoryí, a Suddha Buddhi (pure reason) and subtle intellect withpower of introspection is needed. You will have to turn the mind inside, then concentrate all itspowers and throw them upon the mind itself, in order that it may know its own nature and analyseitself. This is Raja Yoga.Make a vigorous and earnest search within. Do not trust the mind and the Indriyas. They areyour enemies. Woman and wealth are your bitter foes. These are two great evils.In introspection, the mind itself is the subject of study. A portion of the mind studies theremaining portion of the mind. The higher mind studies the lower mind. Introspection isapperception. Just as you watch the work done by a coolie, a portion of the mind watches themovements of the rest of the mind. If you are one with the mind, if you identify yourself with themind, you cannot know your defects. If you are a Sakshi or silent witness of the mind and if youpractise introspection, you can know your various defects.By a careful watch, many defects are detected and removed by suitable Sadhana. Enter aquiet room. Enter into silence daily for about fifteen minutes, morning and evening. Introspect.Watch the mind carefully. The mind will be doing either thinking, planning, feeling, knowing orwilling. You will have to find out through subjective introspection what the mind is exactly doing ata particular time. To go through this practice, you must have Antarmukha Vritti, a subjective mindand a subtle Buddhi. Buddhi can be rendered subtle by study of philosophical books, Satsanga,control of Indriyas (Dama) and Sattvic food. The constant utterance of holy Names of God as Hari,OM, Narayana, Rama, Siva purifies the mind-stuff and helps make the mind introspective(Antarmukha).HOW TO PRACTISE INTROSPECTIONYou are the best judge of your mind. Introspect by living alone in solitude or retiring into acalm room for an hour. You must sit quiet in a solitary room alone, with closed eyes and watch theactivities of the mind. You will then know your defects and weaknesses very clearly.You should afterwards feel the necessity of removing them. Then your Svabhava shouldagree to change. You must know the right method to remove the defect. You must apply the methodconstantly. Then only improvement will set in. Constant application of the Sadhana is anindispensable requisite. You must watch the improvement every now and then, say, once a week, afortnight or a month. You will have to keep a record of your progress (spiritual daily diary). Youmust watch carefully whether you are progressing in the spiritual path, whether you remainstationary or retrograding, whether the mind is distracted or concentrated. If it is distracted, youmust remove the distracting causes one by one with patience and vigilance by suitable methods.

How long can the mind be absolutely fixed on your Lakshya (point ofmeditation)óeither God, Brahman, idea or object, whether internal or external? How long can themind be fixed on the object, rose and rose alone to the exclusion of all other objectsówhether twoseconds or two minutes or five minutes or half an hour? This is self-analysis. Rely on your selfalone. You are your own redeemer and saviour. Nobody can give you Moksha. You will have totread the spiritual path step by step. Books and Gurus can show the path and guide you. This isself-reliance. Make a strong self-determination, ìI will realise God. I will have Atma-Sakshatkaraor Brahmanubhava this very moment and not in the uncertain future.î This is self-determination.Wordlings have no time to think over even for a few minutes the life-problems, the mysteryof life, etc. They get up in the morning. Their minds usually run to the special objects of enjoymenton account of Raga. Their mental energies are poured forth in the usual grooves and avenues-inthoughts of body, thoughts of eating and dressing, thoughts of wife, children, friends and alsothoughts of office-work and business; and thus, the day is over. The same routine follows day afterday, week after week. Years roll on and life is wasted. It is highly lamentable, indeed!Only he who does Manana (reflection) and introspection through Antarmukha Vritti canchange his worldly nature. In him only the idea of Brahman can get permanently lodged.CHAPTER 28EVIL VRITTIS AND THEIR ERADICATIONKama, Krodha, Lobha, Moha, Mada, Matsarya, Darpa (arrogance), Dambha (hypocrisy),Asuya (a form of jealousy), Irshya (intolerance), Ahankara, Raga (attachment), Dvesha (repulsion)are some of the evil Vrittis. They bind a man to Samsara (transmigration). Pride, illusion and desiresare so many binding cords of the mind.LUST, A POWERFUL FORCEKama (lust), Krodha (anger), Lobha (covetousness), Moha (delusion), Mada (pride),Matsarya (jealousy) are the six passions of the mind. If lust is conquered, anger, Lobha, etc., whichare auxiliary weapons, will become ineffective. If this inveterate enemy, lust is destroyed, itsfollowers or retinue can be quite easily conquered. If the commander is killed, it is easy to kill thesoldiers. If lust, which is the source of all enjoyments, ceases, then all worldly bondage, which hasits substratum in the mind, will cease. How, without its renunciation, can you expect to attain therare Nirvikalpa Samadhi or Brahma Nishtha?112MOUNA AND INTROSPECTION"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Lust arises in him who develops attachment specially towards a person of the opposite sex.Loveís principal weapon is woman or lust. Therefore, attachment should not be developed,specially towards the opposite sex.The love between a husband and wife is mainly physical. It is of a selfish, ephemeral andchanging nature. He who has realised Atman can really love all with sincerity of heart. The lovebetween two aspirants based on psychological affinity and intellectual parity is real and lasting. Getrid of selfishness. Selfishness is a major dirt. It clouds the understanding. Remove it by selflessservice, charity, study of Vedantic literature and Satsanga.In a Jnanin, the sexual craving is entirely eradicated. In a Sadhaka, it remainswell-controlled. In a householder, when not controlled, it does havoc. It exists in him in its fullyexpanded state. He cannot resist it. He yields to it helplessly on account of his weak will and lack offirm resolution.If you keep lemon juice or tamarind juice in a golden cup, it is not spoiled or tainted. If youkeep it in a brass or copper vessel, it is at once spoiled and rendered poisonous. Even so, even ifthere are some Vishaya-Vrittis (sensual thoughts) in the pure mind of a person, they will not pollutehim and induce Vikara (sensual excitement). If there are sensual thoughts in persons with impureminds, they cause excitement in them when they come across sensual objects.Remembrance of image of a woman unsettles the mind. When a tiger has once tasted humanblood, it always runs after killing human beings. It becomes a man-eater. Even so, when the mindhas once tasted sexual pleasures, it always runs after women. Lust is powerful. It carries a flowerybow equipped with five arrows, viz., Mohana (fascination), Stambhana (stupefaction), Unmadana(maddening), Soshana (emaciation) and Tapana (inflaming).In the Bhagavad-Gita, you will find it mentioned that senses, mind and Buddhi are the seatsof passions. Pranamaya Kosha is another seat. Desire is all-pervading in the body. Every cell, everyatom, every molecule, every electron is surcharged with passion. There are under-currents,cross-currents, inter-currents and submarine currents in the ocean of passion. You must completelyannihilate each one of them.Be careful in destroying passions. It is easy to control the conscious mind. But, it is verydifficult to control the subconscious mind. You may be a Sannyasin. You may be a moral man.Mark how the mind behaves or conducts itself in dreams. You begin to steal in dreams. You commitadultery in dreams. The sex-impulses, ambitions, low desires are all ingrained in you anddeep-rooted in the subconscious mind. Destroy the subconscious mind and its Samskaras throughVichara, Brahma-Bhavana, meditation on ëOMí and its meaning. A man who is established inmental Brahmacharya can never have even a single thought of evil in dreams. He can never have abad dream. There is lack of Vichara or Viveka in dream. That is the reason why you get bad dreams,even though you are pure in the Jagrat state through the power of Viveka and Vichara.That state of mind wherein no single sexual thought enters the mind is termed mentalBrahmacharya. Bhishma had this state. If you are not established in mental Brahmacharya, at leasttry to control the body when the sex-impulse is troubling you.113MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"A SOURCE OF PERPETUAL DANGER TO SADHAKASThe presence or recollection of a woman usually excites unholy ideas in the minds ofrecluses who have abandoned this world and devoted themselves to spiritual exercises and thusdeprives them of the fruit of their austerity. It is very difficult to understand the presence of subtlelust in the minds of others, particularly in spiritual Sadhakas, though eye (look), tone, gestures, gait,behaviour, etc., may give a clue.THE EXAMPLE OF JAIMINIOnce upon a time, Sri Vedavyasa was holding his Vedanta class amongst his students. In thecourse of his lecture, he mentioned that the young Brahmacharins should be very careful and shouldnot mix with young ladies and that, with all their vigilance and circumspection, they may fall avictim as lust is very powerful. One of his students, Jaimini, the author of Purva-Mimamsa, was alittle impertinent. He said, ìGuruji Maharaj! Your statement is wrong. No lady can attract me. I amwell-established in Brahmacharya.î Vyasa said, ìJaimini, you will know that soon. I am going toBenares. I will return within three months. Be careful. Do not be puffed with pride.î Sri Vyasa,through his Yogic powers, assumed the form of a beautiful young girl, with piercing eyes and verycharming face, well-dressed in a thin silken garment. The lady was standing underneath a tree atsunset. Clouds gathered together. It began to rain. Accidentally, Jaimini was passing along the sideof the tree. He saw the girl, felt pity and addressed her: ìO lady, you can come and stay in myAshrama. I shall give you shelter.î The lady asked, ìAre you living alone? Is any woman livingthere?î Jaimini replied, ìI am alone. But, I am a perfect Brahmacharin. No lust can affect me. I amfree from any sort of Vikara. You can stay there.î The lady objected: ìIt is not right for a youngvirgin girl to stay with a Brahmacharin alone at night.î Jaimini said, ìO damsel, do not be afraid. Ipromise you of my perfect Brahmacharya.î Then she agreed and stayed in his Ashrama at night.Jaimini slept outside and the lady was sleeping inside the room. At the dead of night, Jaimini beganto feel the influence of lust in his mind. A little sexual craving arose in his mind. In the beginning, hewas absolutely pure. He knocked at the door and said, ìO lady, the wind is blowing outside. I cannotbear the cold blasts. I want to sleep inside.î She opened the door. Jaimini was sleeping inside.Again, the sexual craving became a little more intense and keen, as he was very close to a lady andas he heard the sound of her bangles. Then he rose up and began to embrace her. At once, Sri Vyasaassumed his original form with his long beard and said, ìO, my dear Jaimini, what about thestrength of your Brahmacharya now? Are you established in your perfect celibacy now? What didyou say when I was lecturing on this subject?î Jaimini dropped his head down in utter shame andsaid, ìGuruji, I am wrong. Kindly pardon me.îEven Jesus was tempted by Satan. Buddha had to fight severely with Mara (lust) just beforehe attained his Nirvana or Buddhahood.BEWARE OF MAYAóA WARNING TO ASPIRANTSTherefore, oh, dear aspirants, you will have to be very, very careful. During the period ofSadhana, avoid the company of women. You must never mix with young ladies, however strongyou may be. Maya works through under-currents so stealthily that you may not be aware of youractual downfall.114EVIL VRITTIS AND THEIR ERADICATION"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Keep the mind fully occupied with spiritual pursuits. Keep yourself at the farthest distancefrom everything that would stir up your passions. Then only you will be safe.Do not live with householders. Do not test your spiritual strength and purity when you are abeginner on the spiritual path. Do not rush into evil associations when you are a spiritual neophyteto show that you have the courage to face sin and impurity. It will be a serious mistake. You will berunning into a grave danger. You will have a quick downfall. A small fire will be very easilyextinguished by a heap of dust.Mind has a great power of imitation. That is the reason why a spiritual aspirant is prohibitedfrom mixing with householders. His mind will try to imitate the minds of worldlings. Downfall willensue.If an aspirant moves with rich people, Zamindars and Rajas, his mind begins to imitate theluxurious habits of these people and, ere long, he gets an unconscious downfall. Certain bad habitscreep in him unconsciously. And he finds it difficult to tear out or remove these bad habits. Afterforty, it is difficult to tear out old habits and establish new healthy habits.An aspirant can live only for a short time in his native place if there is an urgent call. Yogicrules and laws cannot permit him to stay there for a sufficiently long period, however suitable theplace may be and whatever may be the degree of Vairagya (dispassion) of the aspirant. The force ofSamskaras (impressions) is tremendous. Unless all the Samskaras are thoroughly burnt throughpure Asamprajnata Samadhi or Nirvikalpa Avastha (seedless state), it is not safe for one to stay for along time in oneís own native place. He is still within the danger zone.After seclusion for five years, the aspirant should test his mental state by coming into theworld and mixing with the worldly people. If there is no attraction for objects, he can be quite surethat he has reached the third Jnana-Bhumika-Tanumanasióa stage wherein the mind is thinned outlike a slender thread.HOW LUST DEVELOPS AND RUINSFrom the bed of Samskaras and Vasanas emanates imagination, through memory. Thencomes attachment. Along with imagination, emotion and impulse manifest. Emotion and impulseexist side by side. Then comes sexual irritation, sexual craving, excitement and burning in the mindand throughout the body. The irritation and burning in the mind penetrate into the physical body justas water in the pot penetrates into the surface of the pot. If you are very vigilant, you can drive offthe imagination itself in the very beginning and avert the danger. Even if you allow the thiefimagination to enter the first gate, keep a careful watch at the second gate when the irritationmanifests. You can stop the burning now. You can stop also easily the strong sexual impulse frombeing transmitted to the Indriya itself. Draw the sex energy up towards the brain through Uddiyanaand Kumbhaka. Repeat OM mentally with force. Divert the mind. Pray. Meditate.115MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"METHODS TO CONTROL LUSTJust as you control the itching sensation in an eczematous part of the leg or scabies of thehand, you must control the itching from lust by Viveka, Vichara, Brahma-Bhavana, light Sattvicdiet, fasting, Pranayama, Uddiyana, Bandha, Satsanga, study of the Gita, Japa, prayer, etc. Thenonly can you enjoy spiritual bliss.Vichara and Brahma-BhavanaIt is through constant Vichara and Brahma-Bhavana that the mind has to be weaned fromlustful thoughts and tendencies. You must remove not only the sexual craving and the sexualimpulses, but also sex-attraction. Think of themiseries that you get from a married life with itsvarious entanglements and bondage. Make the mind understand by repeated auto-suggestions andhammering that sexual pleasure is false, worthless, illusory and full of pain. Place before the mind theadvantages, bliss, power and knowledge of a spiritual life. Make it understand that the exalted, eternallife is in the immortal Atman. When it hears constantly these useful suggestions, it will slowly leaveoff its old habits. The attraction for the sex will slowly die. Then only real sex-sublimation will takeplace. You will become then only an Urdhvaretas.Atman is sexless. There is no sex in the five elements. It is the mind that creates the sex idea.Sukadeva had no sex idea. Consider that a woman is a combination of five elements, a mass ofelectrons or atoms. The sex idea will slowly vanish.Pure ReasonThere are two kinds of force in the mind, viz., hostile or antagonistic force and friendly orfavourable force. Passion is hostile force that drags you down. Pure reason is a favourable force thatelevates you and transmutes you into Divinity. Develop, therefore, my child, pure reason to getunalloyed bliss and supreme Brahmic knowledge. The passion will die itself.Sattvic FoodTake light Sattvic food, such as milk, fruits, etc. You can control passions in this way. Thewise say that purity of food leads to purity of mind.FastingFasting weakens the sex Indriya. It destroys sexual excitement. Passionate young men andladies should take recourse to occasional fasting. It will prove highly beneficial.PranayamaBy Pranayama, the mind gradually proceeds from the gross to the subtle. It, therefore,exercises a wholesome check upon the sexual irritation. When some evil thought disturbs yourmind, at once take to Padmasana or Siddhasana and practise Pranayama. The thought will leave youimmediately.116EVIL VRITTIS AND THEIR ERADICATION"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Satsanga and SvadhyayaDo not study romantic novels. Do not talk on sexual subjects.

Destroy one pillaróeither mind, Prana or Virya and the whole building willfall to pieces. If you can observe Akhanda Brahmacharya for a period of 12 years, you will enterinto Nirvikalpa Samadhi spontaneously without any effort. The mind will be controlled by itself.Seminal energy is a potent Sakti. Semen is Brahman itself. A Brahmacharin who has practisedunbroken celibacy for full twelve years will reach to Nirvikalpa state the moment he hears theMahavakya ìTat Tvam Asiî (That thou art). His mind is extremely pure, strong and one-pointed.He need not have repeatedly undergone the lengthy process of Sravana (hearing) and Manana(intellection).A drop of semen is made out of 40 drops of blood. The energy that is spent in one act ofcopulation is tantamount to expenditure of mental energy through mental exertion for 24 hours orexpenditure of physical energy through physical exertion for three days. Mark how valuable andprecious is semen! Do not waste this energy. Preserve it with great care. You will have wonderfulvitality and energy. When it is not used, it is all transmuted into Ojas-Sakti (spiritual energy) andstored up in the brain. Western doctors know little of this salient point. Most of your ailments aredue to excessive seminal wastage.A true Brahmacharin in thought, word and deed has wonderful thought-power. He canmove the world. If you develop strict celibacy, Vichara-Sakti (power of enquiry) andDharana-Sakti (power of grasping and holding the Truth) will develop. If a man persistently refusesto yield to his lower nature and remains as a strict celibate, the seminal energy is deflected upwardsto the brain and is stored up as Ojas-Sakti (spiritual power). Thereby, the power of the intellect isintensified to a remarkable degree. The strict celibate has keen and acute memory even in old age.The celibate who has achieved the transmutation of the seminal energy will find that sexual desiresno longer trouble him. Such celibate is known as Urdhvaretas.

Mere ill-feeling develops intointense malice by repetition of anger.On days when you have many troubles, vexations, worries from the morning to evening, atrifling causes much irritation in the mind. The balance of mind is upset by a paltry affair. A singleharsh word throws you out of the balance, whereas when you are peaceful throughout the day, evena strong abuse and severe censure do not produce any effect whatsoever.Anger resides in the Linga Sarira or astral body. But, it percolates into the physical body justas water percolates through the pores into the outer surface of an earthen pot.ILL-EFFECTS OF ANGERJust as heat melts lead, just as heat and borax melt gold, even so, Kama and Krodha, theheating factors of the mind, melt it. When you are angry, the mind becomes disturbed. Similarly,when the mind is disturbed, the body also becomes disturbed. The whole nervous system isagitated. You become enervated.Anger spoils the brain, nervous system and blood. When a wave of anger arises in the mind,Prana begins to vibrate rapidly. You are agitated and excited. Blood becomes hot. Many poisonousingredients are formed in the blood. When the blood is agitated, the semen also is affected.Once a child sucked the breast of his mother when she was in a fit of violent fury or rage anddied immediately on account of poisoning by virulent chemical products that were thrown into theblood of the mother when she was in great excitement. Many such cases have been recorded. Suchare the disastrous effects of anger. Even three minutes of violent hot temper may produce suchdeleterious effects in the nervous system that it will take weeks or months for the repair of injury.Anger clouds understanding. When the mind is violently agitated, you cannot understand apassage of a book clearly. You cannot think properly and clearly. You cannot write a letter with acool mind. When the lamp is flickering through wind, you do not see the objects clearly. Even so,when the Buddhi (mind) is flickering or agitated by anger, chaos arises in the Buddhi and you arenot able to see and understand things properly. Buddhi is all light.A man who is a slave to anger, may have washed himself well, anointed himself well,dressed his hair and put on white garments; yet he is ugly, being overcome by anger.

Anger is a powerful energy that is uncontrollable by practicalVyavaharic Buddhi, but controllable by pure reason (Sattvic Buddhi) or Viveka-Vichara.When you become angry with your servant when he fails to supply your usual milk on a day,raise a question within yourself: ìWhy should I be a slave to milk?î Then the wave of anger will atonce naturally subside. It will not arise on other occasions also, if you are careful and thoughtful.Control anger by Kshama (forgiveness), Daya, patience, tolerance, universal love(Visva-Prema), mildness, Viveka, Vichara, Atma-Bhava, Udasinata, Nirabhimanata and such othervirtues. Forgive and pity the man who does you harm. Consider censure as a blessing, ornament andnectar. Bear reproach. Develop universal love by service, charity, Brahma-Bhava. Recall any calmand pure state, which when once brought to mind, suppresses the hatred and brings composure.When anger is subdued, rudeness, pride and envy will vanish of themselves. Prayer and devotionwill root out anger.Practise Pratipaksha-Bhavana (entertaining a counter-idea). When you get angry, fill themind with the idea of love.

The anger will subside.When anger tries to exhibit itself, observe silence. Keep quiet. Never utter a harsh word orobscene speech. Try to nip it before it emerges out from the subconscious mind. You will have to bevery alert. It tries to come out suddenly. Before anger manifests, there is an agitation (Udvega) inthe mind.

You will have to impose self-restraint and punishment on yourself by wayof fasting for a day whenever Udvega (agitation) manifests in the mind.If you strive and make sincere effort to subdue your anger, the hatred subsides.

They are so deeply implanted in yoursystem that it is very difficult to root them out. Pride is not so fearful as hatred and malice. When aman is placed in a high position and earns much money and is thereby honoured and respected byall, he becomes very proud. When he loses that position and fails to earn money, his pride vanishes.But hatred and malice are two passions which are inveterate and need constant and diligent effortsfor their eradication.Prejudice, intolerance, Ghrina, insolence, impertinence, scorn, contemptóthese Vrittis areall modifications of the emotion of hatred. Suspicion becomes prejudice by repetition. Prejudicedevelops into ill-will (Ghrina) and intolerance. Ill-will is a mild form of hatred. When repeated, itdevelops into hatred. Hatred, by successive repetition, becomes malice or extreme enmity.PrejudicePrejudice or unreasonable dislike, prepossessions and intolerance are three undesirableVrittis in the mind. Prejudice makes the mind and brain callous. The mind cannot think truly.Prejudice is a kind of mental sore. If you have prejudice against Mohammedans, you cannotunderstand the teachings of Mohammed in the Quoran.

Broad view results from foreign travels, good birth, vast study,Satsanga, public service, varied experience, meditation, etc. A man of broad views sees things intheir entirety and in their right relations. Broad view creates harmony and concord. Narrow viewcreates disharmony and discord.ANTICIPATION AND AVARICEMemory and anticipation are two kinds of evil Vrittis for a spiritual aspirant, though theyare beneficial for worldly-minded persons. Pratyasa (anticipation) and Parigraha (grasping) makeyou a beggar of beggars and destroy your will-power. Do not anticipate anything. Anticipationfattens the mind and causes restlessness. Do not expect anything. It causes mental disturbance. Ifyou do not expect, you would not have disappointment. Forget everything that pertains to the world.Even if anything that is conducive to luxury comes, reject it at once. You will grow strong.Remember God and God alone. Everything else here is a dream. The world is a long dream.Destroy avarice by Santosha (contentment), integrity, disinterestedness and charity. Do notentertain hopes. You will not have any disappointment. Santosha is one of the four sentinels of thedomain of Moksha. A contented mind is a continual feast. If you have Santosha, you will get helpfrom the other three sentinels, viz., Sama, Vichara and Satsanga. With the help of these foursentinels, you can attain Brahma-Jnana, the ultimate goal of life.MOHA AND ITS CUREMoha (delusion) is a strong weapon of Maya. Do not say, my friend, that desire is morepowerful than Moha. Moha is as much powerful and dangerous as desire is. Moha does three things.It creates the idea of ëminenessíómy wife, my son, my house, etc. It produces infatuated love andattachment for body, wife, son and property. It creates the ëNitya-Buddhií (the idea of stability) inthe perishable objects of the world and ëDehatma-Buddhií. It makes a false thing appear as true.The world appears as real on account of Moha. The body is mistaken for Atman or pure Self owingto the delusive influence of Moha.Although you know fully well that the body of a woman is made up of flesh, bone, skin, hair,blood, urine and faeces, yet you passionately cling to the form. Why? Because of the force of Raga,Moha, Samskara, Vasana and Kalpana (imagination). When there is Vasana-Kshaya (annihilationof Vasanas) through Vichara and Viveka, you will not be attached towards a woman.Get rid of excessive Moha and attachment to wife, money and also children by Sannyasa(external renunciation). If there is external change, internal change must also come. Externalrenunciation is quite necessary.123MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"The mind is generally attracted by brilliant light, beauty, intelligence, varied colours andpleasant sounds.

Allthese varieties of pride should be completely overcome.Get rid of pride through Viveka. Everything is Anitya. Why are you vainly puffed up withpride?Arrogance is a form of pride. It is undue assumption of self-importance. It is claiming toomuch.Darpa is vanity. It is vain display. It is vain show. The man is puffed up even though heactually does not possess anything. A man of pride actually possesses something. That is thedifference between pride and vanity. Vanity is a form of exaggerated pride.Hypocrisy (Dambha) is pretending to be what one is really not. It is feigning. It isconcealment of oneís true character. It is the opposite of Adambhitva of the Gita (XIII-7). Ahypocrite pretends to be what he is really not, in order to extract money, honour, fame or somethingelse from others.Hypocrisy, falsehood, cheating, avarice and Trishna (avidity) are very closely related. Theyare members of one family. Hypocrisy is the offspring of avarice. Falsehood is the son of hypocrisy.Hypocrisy co-exists with falsehood. Trishna is the mother of hypocrisy. Hypocrisy cannot live evenfor a moment without falsehood, the son and avarice and Trishna (father and mother). When there isa craving for objects, greed for money comes in. Without money, there can be no enjoyment. Tosatisfy the hunger for money, persons have to put on hypocrisy, tell lies and cheat others. The rootcause of all this is craving for enjoyment. Deceitful diplomacy and falsehood are old allies of greedand hatred.Self-sufficiency is a peculiar modification in the mind. It is the effect of vanity, pride andDambha. It is a Rajoguna Vritti.

They all indicate lack of proper mental culture and meanness ofthe person. They should be removed.Taunting is to censure sarcastically. Teasing is to torment or irritate with jests. Sneering is toshow contempt by the expression of the face, as by turning up the nose. Frowning is to wrinkle thebrow as in anger. Mocking is to laugh at in ridicule, to mimic in ridicule. Ridiculing is to make a witexposing one to laughter. It is derision or mockery. It is exposing one to merriment. A joke is aclever insult. You must avoid all these when you move with others, as they cause rupture betweenfriends, heated feelings and a sense of hostility. Words must be soft and arguments hard; if wordsare hard, they will bring discord. A single harsh word will break the friendship of long years in aminute. Word or sound has got tremendous power.

You want to vilifyhim.If you always look into the faults of others, you will actually imbibe those faults byconstantly thinking of them. Always look into the bright side of a man. Ignore his defects.

What do I gain by being jealous of another?î When anyone thinks like thisseriously several times daily, the Vritti of jealousy will slowly die. This Vritti is the root of allmiseries.

It is a negative thought. It is your worst enemy. It assumesvarious forms, viz., fear of death, fear of disease, fear of public criticism, fear of losing yourproperty or money, etc. Fear blights many lives, makes people unhappy and unsuccessful.Some people can bravely face the shell or the shot on the battlefield. But they are afraid ofpublic criticism and public opinion. Some can face a tiger fearlessly in the forest. But they are afraidof the surgeonís knife and bistoury. You should get rid of fear of all sorts.The power of imagination in the mind intensifies fear. Fear is due to delusion or Moha,attachment to the gross and physical body on account of Avidya (ignorance). Attachment to thebody (Moha, Dehadhyasa) is the cause of all fear. He who can throw off the physical sheath(Annamaya Kosha) either by Yoga or Jnana will be free from fear. He who has conquered fear, hasconquered everything, has gained mastery over the mind.Some people faint when they see a copious quantity of blood. Some men cannot see asurgical operation. They faint. These are all mental weaknesses. Some cannot take their food ifsome faecal or vomited matter is nearby. All mental weaknesses must be eradicated by Vichara.A calm mind means courage.

They contribute to the peace andhappiness of human beings. They should be cultivated to a very high degree.Love and pity make the mind soft. Pity has the characteristic feature of evolving the mode ofremoving pain; the property of not being able to bear seeing others suffer; the manifestation of notharming; the proximate cause of seeing the need of those overcome by pain. Its consummation isthe suppression of harming; its failure is the production of sorrow.Patience, tenacity, Utsaha (perseverance) and determination are indispensable for successin Self-realisation.

The secret of Ramayana is control of mind.Killing the ten-headed monster Ravana of Lanka means the annihilation of the ten evil Vrittis of themind such as Kama, Krodha, etc. Sita is mind. Rama is Suddha-Brahman. Bringing Sita back fromLanka is concentrating the mind on Rama (Brahman) by withdrawing it from Vishaya (objects) anduniting it with Rama. Sita (mind) unites with Rama (Brahman), her husband in Ayodhya (SahasraraChakra). Mind merges in Brahman. This is, briefly, the esoteric meaning of Ramayana. This is theAdhyatmic exposition of Ramayana.MASTERY OF MIND, THE ONLY GATEWAY TO MOKSHAOn this side is matter; on the other side is pure Spirit (Atman or Brahman). Mind forms abridge between the two.

The waves came in and washed away the eggs. The birdbecame very angry. It wanted to empty the ocean with its beak. It applied all its energy in emptyingthe ocean. The king of the birds pitied its condition and came to its help. Narada, the peace-makingRishi, also came and gave some advice to the bird. When the king of the ocean saw all these, he wasvery much terrified. He brought back all the eggs of the bird and handed them over to the bird withapology and prostrations. Sadhakas (aspirants), who are attempting to control the mind, shouldhave the same asinine patience and untiring perseverance as that of the bird which attempted toempty the ocean with its small beak.You must have the knack or the pluck or the aptitude to tame the mind.

An acrobat girl, while exhibiting her performances, has her attention riveted on thewater-pot she bears on her head although all the time she is dancing to various tunes. So does trulypious man attend to all his business concerns, but has his mindís eye fixed upon the blissful feet ofthe Lord. This is Karma-Yoga and Jnana-Yoga combined. This will lead to integral development.This is balance. This is synthetic Yoga. Some Vedantins have one-sided development. This is notgood.DO KIRTANA serpent is very fond of music. If you sing Punnagavarali tune melodiously, the serpentwill come in front of you. Mind also is like a serpent. It likes melodious tunes very much. It can beentrapped very easily by sweet sounds.Fix the mind on the sweet Anahata sounds that emanate from the heart by closing the ears. Itcan be controlled quite easily by this method. This is Laya-Yoga. The Ganika Pingala fixed hermind on the ìRama, Ramaî sound uttered by the parrot and attained Bhava-Samadhi.

Even if youthink of Lord Vishnu or Siva only once, even if you once form a mental image of these deities, theSattvic material will increase a bit. If you think a crore of times, your mind will be filled with a largequantity of Sattva. Constant thinking of God thins out the mind and destroys the Vasanas andSankalpas.When you fix your mind on Lord Krishna in the lotus of your heart, your attention is fixedon the figure of Lord Krishna. When the attention is fixed, the spiritual current is started. When youmeditate, the flow of the current becomes steady and when the meditation gets very deep andintense, ëUnioní (Samadhi) takes place. You become one with the Lord. All Sankalpas andVikalpas stop. There is complete ëChitta-Vritti-Nirodhaí (restraint of the modifications of themind).PRACTISE PRANAYAMATo bring about control of mind, two things are essential, viz., Prana-Nirodha (control ofPrana) and Sanga-Tyaga (renunciation of Sanga or association). By the latter is meant dissociation,not with the world, but only with the longing after or the attraction towards the objects of the world.Pranayama or control of breath checks the velocity of the mind and reduces the quantity ofthinking. It removes the dross (impurities) in the form of Rajas and Tamas from the mind.For control of the mind, Kumbhaka (retention of breath) is indispensable. You will have topractise Kumbhaka daily. You will have to practise Puraka, Kumbhaka and Rechaka (inhalation,retention and exhalation of breath) regularly and rhythmically. Then the mind will become Ekagra.The period of Kumbhaka will increase by systematic practice, with regulated diet and properdietetic discipline (light, nutritious, Sattvic food). This is the Hathayogic method. The practice ofKumbhaka must be done under the guidance of a Guru who is a developed Yogin.PRACTISE SAMA AND DAMAUparati of mind (calmness) comes through the practice of Sama and Dama. Sama iscalmness of mind induced by the eradication of Vasanas. Vasana-Tyaga (renunciation of desires)through discrimination constitutes the practice of Sama, one of the sixfold virtues (Shatsampatti). Ifa desire arises in your mind, do not give way to it. This will become the practice of Sama. Sama iskeeping the mind in the heart by Sadhana. Sama is restraint of the mind by not allowing it toexternalise or objectify. The restraint of the external activities and the Indriyas is the practice ofDama (Bahyavrittinigraha).135MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"If you renounce the desire for eating mangoes, it is Sama.

This kind of restraint of the Indriyas is termed Dama.It is termed Sama when you do not allow any thought to arise in the mind concerning sweetsby eradication of Vasanas (Vasana-Tyaga). This eradication of the Vasanas can be accomplishedthrough Vichara, Brahma-Chintana, Japa, Dhyana, Pranayama, etc.Sama is an internal restraint. Dama is a restraint of the Indriyas. Though the practice ofSama includes the practice of Dama, as the Indriyas will not move and work without the help of themind, yet the practice of Dama is necessary. The practice of Dama should go hand in hand withSama. Sama alone will not suffice. You must attack the enemy, desire, from within and without.Then alone you can control the mind quite easily. Then alone the mind will be in perfect control.DEVELOP VAIRAGYAThose who practise Vairagya are real tamers of their minds. Have no longing for objects.Avoid them. Vairagya thins out the mind. Vairagya is a drastic purgative for the mind. Thethief-mind shudders and trembles when it hears the words, ëVairagya,í ëTyaga,í ëSannyasa.í It getsa death-blow when it hears these three terms.Destroy all the pleasure-centres of the mind such as frequently eating dainty dishes,gossiping, sightseeing, music and company of women slowly and cautiously. Keep up three Sattvicpleasure-centres such as study of books dealing with Atma-Jnana, meditation and service ofhumanity. When you advance in meditation, give up service and study also for some time. After youhave attained Nirvikalpa state, preach, work and distribute divine knowledge (Jnana Yajna of theGita, XVIII-70).Whatever object the mind likes much must be given up. Whatever object the mind dwellsupon constantly, thinks about very often, must be abandoned. If you like brinjals or apples much,give them up first.

After some months, the craving or the hankering will beattenuated and will slowly vanish. You must be devoting three or four hours daily in proper prayer,Japa and meditation of God. The above objects which used to attract you before very much seemvery loathsome now. They present the very reverse of your former feelings. They give you intensepain. This is a sign of true Vairagya (dispassion) and destruction of the mind.If all objects which have an enchanting appearance become eyesores and present the veryreverse of the former feelings, then know that the mind is destroyed.

Even if you become irritable and show signs ofanger, you are able now to compose yourself quickly. These are all the signs of your gaining mentalstrength and will-power. Meditation brings about all these beneficial results.When there is quiescence in the mind and an indifference in it towards all enjoyments andwhen the powerful Indriyas are turned inwards and the Ajnana of the mind is destroyed, then andthen only all the noble words of the wise Guru will infiltrate and spread in the mind of the disciple,just as rose-coloured water impinges on a perfectly white cloth.HAVE SANTOSHAThe mind is ease-loving, easy-going and happy-go-lucky. You must check this nature. Thedesire for ease and comfort is ingrained in the mind. Aspirants should be very cautious and careful.Do not try to fulfil your desires. This is one way of controlling the mind.You must not take back those things which you have once renounced. Whenever you giveup an object, the desire for that particular object becomes keen and strong for a few days. It agitatesyour mind. Keep quiet. Stand firm. It gets thinned out and dies eventually. Whenever the mindhisses to get back the objects that are rejected, raise the rod of Viveka. It will lower down its hood. Itwill keep quiet.You must not give indulgence or leniency to the mind. If you increase your wants even byone article, the articles will begin to swell in number. Luxuries will come one by one. If you allow itto take one luxury today, it wants two tomorrow. Luxuries will increase daily. It will become like anoverfondled child. Spare the rod and spoil the child; this also applies to the mind. It is worse than thechild. You will have to punish it by fasting for every serious mistake it does. Keep the organs intheir proper places. Do not allow them to move an inch. Raise the rod of Viveka whenever an organhisses to raise its head. By this practice you will get a concentrated mind. Those who, withoutlonging for objects, avoid them can be termed the subjugators of their minds.Those who are not content with anything that comes in their way are of weak minds only.Santosha (contentment in the mind) is a very great virtue.ìSantoshat paramam labhamóbycontentment, you will have great gain.î It is one of the four sentinels of the vast domain of Moksha.If you have this virtue, it will lead to the attainment of Satsanga (association with the wise), Vichara(enquiry of Self) and Santi (peace).When you do not want to store things for tomorrow, it is called ìAsangraha Buddhi.î It isthe mental state of a true Sannyasin.

To learn to work under different conditions means progress and a great deal ofmental control.HAVE RECOURSE TO SATSANGAWithout being impressed with a clear idea of the nature of the mind, you cannot bridle it. Asublime thought checks the mind and a base idea excites it. It is necessary for a man to keepcompany with spiritual men and to avoid the company of the dregs of society.Company of spiritual persons and good environments play a tremendous part in theelevation of the mind. Satsanga helps a long way in the attainment of Moksha. There is no otherway. It thoroughly overhauls the mind and changes the current and its Rajasic nature. It removes theold Vishaya-Samskaras and fills the mind with Sattvic Samskaras. It destroys the threefiresóAdhyatmic, Adhibhautic and Adhidaivic Tapaóand cools the Antahkarana. It destroysMoha. If you can have Satsanga, you need not go to any Tirtha. It is Tirtha of Tirthas. Whereverthere is Satsanga, the sacred Triveni is already there.Annihilate this mind of Ajnana (ignorance) through the power of constant associationwith holy men (Satsanga). In the absence of positive good company, have negative goodcompany of books written by realised persons and books dealing with Atma-Jnana (spiritualknowledge) such as Sri Sankaraís works, Yogavasishtha, Sri Dattatreyaís Avadhuta Gita, theUpanishads, the Brahma-Sutras, Atma-Purana, Sarva-Vedanta-Siddhanta-Sara-Sangraha, SriSankaracharyaís Aparokshanubhuti, etc., etc.Study of inspiring books helps spiritual Sadhana but too much study brings about muddycondition of the brain.

This will elevate the mind.If you are in the company of Sannyasins, if you read books on Yoga, Vedanta, etc., a mentaladhesion takes place in the mind for attaining God-consciousness. Mere mental adhesion will nothelp you much either. Burning Vairagya, burning Mumukshutva, capacity for spiritual Sadhana,intent and constant application and Nididhyasana (meditation) are needed.

Then you will be free from all sorts of tribulations and worries andmiseries. Then only you will have perennial happiness and the wealth of Moksha.Mind is Maya. If the mind runs towards the sensual objects wildly, Maya takes a strongholdof the man. Maya havocs through the mind. This lower impulsive mind drags you down in all kindsof petty sensual enjoyments and deludes you in a variety of ways. Maya, through her power, raisesmillions of Sankalpas in the mind. The Jiva becomes a prey to the Sankalpas.This lower Manas cannot approach those who have a strong Viveka (power ofdiscrimination) between Sat and Asat (the real and the unreal). Maya is very easy to be detected andSelf to be realised by men who possess discrimination and strong determination. Through thesepowers, viz., Viveka and will, it can be controlled.Slay the lower mind, the enemy of Atman through the higher and Sattvic mind. Use yourVichara, Viveka and pure reason constantly when objects trouble you, delude you. After reason hasdispersed the darkness of the illusions of sense which cover the mind, it still returns to those thingswhich are deceitful as the appearance of water on sandy deserts. Again and again, exercise yourreason till you are established in knowledge. The power of Avidya is great, indeed.Renounce desires; renounce Sankalpas of objects. Cultivate Vairagya. Give up this littlefalse ëI.í All the Sankalpas encircle and envelop this ëI.í Do not pay much heed to the body. Thinkof the body and its wants as little as possible.Have no Sankalpa. The fluctuating mind will die by itself. It will melt in Brahman (ArupaManonasa). Then you will have the Sakshatkara (Beatific vision of Atman). When the mind dies,ëI,í ëyou,í ëhe,í ëthis,í ëthat,í time, space, Jiva, Jagat, all will dwindle into nothing. Idea of inside andoutside will vanish.

Do not sit down and brood overfailures.There are some people who have got the habit of trying to do one thing while thinking ofanother. These people always fail in undertakings. The thinking part of the mind should work inharmony with the acting part of the mind. While attending to any one object, our thoughts ought notto wander on another. While you are reading, think of reading only. Do not think of cricket match.While you are playing in a cricket match, do not think of studies. The frequent cause of failure isstriving to think of more than one thing at a time.Whenever you observe Niyama (religious observances) do it to the letter rigidly. Do not say,ìI will do it as far as possible.î This term ëas far as possibleí will give leniency to the mind.

It is ever changing and wandering. It jumps from one object to another. It isfickle. It wants variety. Monotony brings disgust. It is like a spoiled child who is given to muchindulgence by its parents or a badly trained animal. The minds of many of us are like menageries ofwild animals, each pursuing the bent of its own nature and going its own way. Restraint of the mindis a thing unknown to the vast majority of persons.This wandering habit of the mind manifests itself in various ways. You will have to be alertalways to check this wandering habit of the mind. A householderís mind wanders to cinema,theatre, circus, etc. A Sadhuís mind wanders to Varanasi, Vrindavana and Nasik. Many Sadhus donot stick to one place during Sadhana. The wandering habit of the mind must be controlled byrendering it chaste and constant by Vichara. The mind must be trained to stick to one place for fiveyears during your meditative life, to one method of Sadhana, to one path of Yogaóeither Karma,Bhakti or Vedantaóto one spiritual objective and to one guide. ìA rolling stone gathers no moss.îWhen you take up a book for study, you must finish it before you take up another. When you take upany work, you must devote your whole-hearted attention to the work on hand and finish it beforeyou take up another work. ìOne thing at a time and that done well is a very good rule as many cantell.î This is Yoginís way of doing. This is a very good rule for success in life.Do not have a goatís mind or a prostituteís heart. A goat grazes for a few seconds in onepatch of green grass and then immediately jumps to a far distant patch, even though there is plentyof grass to eat in the first patch. Even so, a wavering mind jumps from one Sadhana to anotherSadhana, from one Guru to another Guru, from Bhakti Yoga to Vedanta, from Rishikesh toVrindavana. This is extremely deleterious for the Sadhana. Stick to one Guru, one place, one formof Yoga, one kind of Sadhana. Be steady and firm. Then only, you will succeed. Have a steady,resolute mind.Discipline the mind. Tell the mind, ìO Mind! Be steady. Be fixed on one idea. Absolute isthe only Reality.î If it wanders, if it wavers, go to a lonely place, give two or three sharp slaps onyour face. Then the mind will become steady. Self-punishment helps a lot in checking thewandering mind. Frighten the mind as if you will beat it with a whip or rod, whenever it wandersfrom the Lakshya, whenever it entertains evil thoughts.Mind tempts and deceives you through object. Distance lends enchantment to the view.Until you attain the object, it will seem to you as a pleasurable object from a distance. When youactually get it, it becomes a source of vexation and pain. Desire is mixed with pain. Objects are sodelusive that they often deceive even the wise in this way. He is a really wise man who can detectthe illusive nature of these objects.Mind always tempts you to have various sightseeing. It is all vain trick of the mind to divertyou from the goal. Use your Viveka always. Address the mind thus: ìO foolish mind, have you notseen before, various places and scenery? What is there in sightseeing? Rest in Atman within. It isself-contained. You can see everything there. It is Purnakama; it is Purnarupa. (It contains all forms;it is Beauty of beauties). What are you going to see outside?

Gradually, it left off its old habits and became my true friend,guide and Guru through true counsels it imparts in the way of obtaining the highest goal.Do not allow the mind to wander here and there like the strolling street dog. Keep it underyour control always. Then alone you can be happy. It must be ever ready to obey you, to carry outyour behests. If the mind says to you, ìGo eastward,î then go westward. If the mind says to you,ìGo southward,î then march northward. If the mind says to you, ìTake a hot cup of tea in winter,îthen take a cup of icy cold water. Swim like fish against the mental current.

Coax and it will obey.If the mind is deprived of its pleasure-centres of all sense-objects, it clings to Vairagya andTyaga and must naturally move towards Atman. Renounce everything mentally and destroy themind through the attainment of Atma-Jnana. Rest in the self-existent Brahmic seat. It is onlythrough dauntless energy that the painless wealth of Moksha can be acquired.CHANGE THE HABITSMind is a bundle of habits. Bad habits and prejudices hidden in oneís nature will necessarilybe brought to the surface of the mind when the proper opportunity comes. If you change the habits,you can also change your character. You sow an act; you reap a habit. You sow a habit; you reap acharacter. You sow a character; you reap a destiny. Habits originate in the conscious mind. But,when they become established by constant repetition, they sink down into the depths of theunconscious mind and become ësecond nature.íThough habit is second nature, it can be changed by a new healthy, agreeable habit of astronger nature. You can change any habit by patient efforts and perseverance. Habits of sleeping inthe daytime, late rising, loud talking, etc., can be gradually changed by developing new habits.By new practice, you can change the manner of your handwriting. So also, by a new mode ofthinking, you can change your destiny. When you draw water with a rope and bucket from a wellwith a brick parapet, a definite groove is formed along the brick and the rope readily runs along thegroove. Even so, the mental force (the mind) runs easily or flows readily along the grooves in thebrain made by continuous thinking on certain lines. Now you are thinking, ëI am the body.í Think,ëI am Brahman.í In course of time, you will be established in Brahmic consciousness.By spiritual Sadhana, Vichara, meditation, Pranayama, Japa, Sama and Dama an entirelynew mind is formed in a Sadhaka with new feelings, new nerve-channels, new avenues and groovesin the brain for the mind to move and walk about, new nerve-currents and new brain-cells, etc. He142HOW TO CONTROL THE MIND"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"will never think about affairs that tend to self-aggrandisement and self-exaltation.

The hostileforces, e.g., lust, anger, etc., will try to bring you down; the spiritual currents, the force of Sattva andSubha Vasanas will try to take you up to God. If evil thoughts enter your mind once in a monthinstead of thrice weekly (remember that evil thinking is the beginning of adultery), if you becomeangry once in a month instead of once weekly, that is a sign of progress, that is a sign of yourincreased will-power; that is a sign of growing spiritual strength.

Through Sadhana or spiritual practice, it shouldbe brought to a balanced state (Samata). It is one-sided by its very nature. It is through mental drillor training that integral development must be achieved.Make a vigorous and earnest search within. Do not trust the mind and the Indriyas. They areyour enemies. Women and wealth are your bitter foes. These are two great evils.Mind exercises its sovereignty over man through the force of attachment, craving,Samskara and Vasana (tendency, latent desire, will to possess and enjoy, world-desire). It doesvarious tricks. When you once know its ways, it lurks like a thief. It will no longer trouble you.In controlling the mind, you have to do seven things: (1) You must get rid of all desires,Vasanas and Trishnas. (2) You must control your emotions. You must control the temper so thatyou may feel no anger or impatience. (3) You must control the mind itself so that the thought mayalways be calm and unruffled. (4) You must control the nerves through the mind so that they may beas little irritable as possible. (5) You must give up Abhimana. Abhimana strengthens the mind. It isthe seed of the mind. When you have become a Nirabhimani, how can criticisms, taunts and censureaffect you? (6) You must destroy all attachments ruthlessly. (7) You must give up all hopes andprejudices.The following will bring you peace of mind undoubtedly. (1) Avoid the company of evilpersons. (2) Live alone. (3) Reduce your wants. (4) Do not argue. Arguing creates sense of hostility.It is a sheer waste of energy. (5) Do not compare yourself with others. (6) Do not lend your ears forpublic criticism. (7) Give up the idea of name and fame.According to Patanjali Maharshi, Maitri (friendship between equals), Karuna (mercytowards inferiors), Mudita (complacency towards superiors), Upeksha (indifference towardsrogues), will bring about Chittaprasada or peace of mind.You should, through your higher Sattvic mind, avoid the mind which runs in the direction ofobjects and, progressing higher up, should, without any despondency of heart, accumulate wealthof Tapasya for acquiring that imperishable Supreme Seat (Parama Pada). Like an emperor whobrings under his sway all kings on earth, the fluctuating mind should be brought under the perfectcontrol of the non-fluctuating mind and then, the latter reaches its own state which is the SupremeOne.145MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 31CONCENTRATIONìTatpratishedhartham-ekatattvabhyasahó To remove this (tossing and various otherobstacles which stand in the way of one-pointedness of mind), the practice of concentrationon one thing alone (should be made).î(Patanjali Yoga Sutras, I-32)CONCENTRATION, THE KEY TO PEACEWorldly pleasures intensify the desire for enjoying greater pleasures. Hence, the mind ofworldlings is very restless. There is no satisfaction and mental peace. Mind can never be satisfied,whatever amount of pleasure you may store up for it. The more it enjoys the pleasures, the more itwants them. So, people are exceedingly troubled and bothered by their own minds. They are tired oftheir minds. Hence, in order to remove these botherations and troubles, the Rishis thought it best todeprive the mind of all sensual pleasures. When the mind has been concentrated or made extinct, itcannot pinch one to seek for further pleasure and all botherations and troubles are removed for everand the person attains real peace.There is an externalising or objectifying power in the mind. This leads to BahirmukhaVritti. The mind is drawn towards various objects. There is dissipation of mental energy, thepowers of the mind, in various directions. The rays of the mind are like the rays of light,scattered in the case of worldly-minded persons. When the rays of the mind are scattered overdiverse objects, you get pain. When the rays are gathered and concentrated by practice, themind becomes concentrated and you get Ananda (happiness) from within.When you see your dear friend after six years, the Ananda that you get is not from theperson, but from within yourself. The mind becomes concentrated for the time being and you gethappiness from within your own self.When you are in Kashmir, when you are enjoying the picturesque scenery of Muttan,Gulmarg, Sonamarg, Chashmashahi and Anantanag, your mind will be suddenly upset by shock, ifyou receive a telegram which brings the unhappy tidings of the untimely demise of your only son.The scenery will no longer interest you. They have lost their charm for you. There is ejection ofattention. There is depression. It is concentration and attention that gives you pleasure insightseeing.For purposes of concentration, you will have to gather the scattered rays of the mindpatiently through Vairagya and Abhyasa, through Tyaga (renunciation) and Tapas and then marchboldly with indefatigable energy towards God or Brahman. Through constant Sadhana (spiritualpractice), the mind must be checked from externalising. It must be made to move towards Brahman,its original home. When the mental rays are concentrated, illumination begins.146HOW TO CONTROL THE MIND"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE NATURE OF MINDMind is compared to quicksilver, because its rays are scattered over various objects. It iscompared to a monkey, because it jumps from one object to another object. It is compared tomoving air, because it is Chanchala. It is compared to a furious, rutting elephant, because of itspassionate impetuosity. Mind is known by the name ëGreat Bird,í because it jumps from oneobject to another object just as a bird jumps from one twig to another, from one tree to another.Raja Yoga teaches us how to concentrate the mind and then how to ransack the innermostrecesses of our own mind.DIFFERENT DEGREES OF CONCENTRATIONKshipta, Mudha, Vikshipta, Ekagra and Niruddha are the five Yogic Bhumikas. The Chittaor mind manifests itself in five different forms. In the Kshipta state, the rays of the mind arescattered on various objects. It is restless and jumps from one object to another. In the Mudha state,the mind is dull and forgetful. Vikshipta is the gathering mind. It is occasionally steady and, at othertimes, distracted. By practice of concentration, the mind struggles to gather itself. In the Ekagrastate, it is one-pointed. There is only one idea present in the mind. The mind is under perfect controlin the Niruddha state. Dharana is practised for stopping the modifications of the mind.THE POWER OF CONCENTRATIONBy manipulating the mind, you will be able to bring it under your control, make it work asyou like and compel it to concentrate its powers as you desire. He who has learnt to manipulate themind will get the whole of Nature under his control. There is no limit to the power of the humanmind. The more concentrated it is, the more power is brought to bear on one point.A scientist concentrates his mind and invents many things. Through concentration, he opensthe layers of the gross mind and penetrates deeply into higher regions of the mind and gets deeperknowledge. He concentrates all the energies of his mind into one focus and throws them out uponthe materials he is analysing and so finds out their secrets.CONCENTRATION, MANíS FOREMOST DUTYSri Sankara writes in the commentary on Chhandogya Upanishad (VII-xx-1) that a manísduty consists in the control of the senses and concentration of mind. So long as the thoughts of oneare not thoroughly destroyed through persistent practice, he should ever be concentrating his mindon one truth at a time. Through such unremitting practice, one-pointedness will accrue to the mindand instantly, all the hosts of thoughts will vanish. Concentration is opposed to sensuous desires,bliss to flurry and worry, sustained thinking to perplexity, applied thinking to sloth to torpor,rapture to ill-will.You are born to concentrate the mind on God after collecting the mental rays that aredissipated on various objects.

In trying to concentrate your mind or even project a thought,you will find that you require naturally to form images in your mind. You cannot help it. Fix themind on one object, on one idea. Withdraw the mind, again and again, when it runs away from theLakshya and fix it there. Do not allow the mind to create hundreds of thought-forms. Introspect andwatch the mind carefully. Live alone.

You can easily control the mind if youcan concentrate on this region. Meditation and concentration on the Ajna Chakra lead to control ofmind very easily. Light is seen during concentration in this region very quickly, even in a dayíspractice, by some persons. He who wants to meditate on Virat and he who wants to help the worldshould select this region for his concentration.A Bhakta or devotee should concentrate on the heart, the seat of emotion and feeling. Hewho concentrates on the heart gets great Ananda. He who wants to get Ananda should concentrateon the heart.A Hatha Yogi fixes his mind on the Sushumna Nadi, the middle path in the spinal canaland on a specified centre, viz., the Muladhara or the Manipura or the Ajna Chakra. Some Yogisignore the lower Chakras and fix their mind on the Ajna Chakra only. Their theory is that bycontrolling the Ajna Chakra, all the lower Chakras can be automatically controlled. When youconcentrate on a Chakra, a thread-like connection is formed in the beginning between the mindand the Chakra (centre of spiritual energy). Then the Yogi ascends along the Sushumna fromChakra to Chakra. The ascent is made gradually by patient efforts. Even a mere shaking of the148CONCENTRATION"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"opening of Sushumna causes a great deal of Ananda (bliss). You become intoxicated. You willentirely forget the world.

Panchadharana (fivekinds of Dharana) will help you to conquer the five elements. Learn them under a Guru who is adeveloped Yogi.A NOTE OF CAUTIONIf you get headache or pain by concentrating on the Trikuti (the space between the twoeyebrows) by turning the eyes upward, give up the practice at once. Concentrate on the heart. If youfind it difficult to concentrate on your heart or the space between the two eyebrows (Trikuti) or topof the head, if you experience headache or pain in the skull, shift your centre of concentration to anyobject outside the body.CONCENTRATION ON EXTERNAL OBJECTSIt is easy to concentrate the mind on external objects. The mind has a natural tendency to gooutwards. You can concentrate on the blue sky, light of the sun, the all-pervading air or ether or sun,moon or stars.TRAINING IN CONCENTRATIONTrain the mind in a variety of ways in concentration in the beginning. Concentrate on theAnahata sounds of the heart by closing the ears. Concentrate on the breath with Soham repetition.Concentrate on any concrete image. Concentrate on the blue sky. Concentrate on the all-pervadinglight of the sun. Concentrate on the various Chakras of the body. Concentrate on the abstract ideasof Satyam (Truth), Jnanam (Wisdom), Anantam (Infinity), Ekam (One), Nityam (Eternal Essence),etc. Lastly, stick to one thing only.AIDS TO CONCENTRATIONFaithThough any subject has been established by means of arguments and valid authorities, stillpeopleís minds being entirely taken up with gross external objects, any clear conception of subtleultimate truths is almost impossible without proper faith. When there is faith, the mind can be easilyconcentrated on the subject to be understood; and then the understanding quickly follows.149MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"Control of BreathRemove the Rajas and Tamas that envelop the Sattva of the mind by Pranayama, Japa,Vichara and Bhakti. Then the mind becomes fit for concentration. Pranayama or control of breathremoves the veil of Rajas and Tamas that envelops Sattva. It purifies the nerves (Nadis). It makesthe mind firm and steady and thereby renders it fit for concentration. The dross of the mind iscleansed by Pranayama, just as the dross of gold is got rid of by melting. A Hatha Yogi tries toconcentrate his mind by having his breath controlled through Pranayama.A Raja Yogi tries to concentrate his mind by ìChitta-Vritti-Nirodhaî (restraining thevarious modifications of the Chitta), by not allowing the mind to assume various shapes of objects.He does not care for control of breath. But, his breath becomes necessarily controlled when hismind is concentrated. Hatha Yoga is a branch of Raja Yoga.Avadhana or AttentionAttention (Avadhana) plays a very great part in concentration. It is the basis of will. When itis properly guided and directed towards the internal world for purposes of introspection(Antarmukha Vritti), it will analyse the mind and illumine very many astounding facts for you.The force wherewith anything strikes the mind is generally in proportion to the degree ofattention bestowed upon it. Moreover, the great art of memory is attention and inattentive peoplehave bad memories. Power of attention becomes weakened in old age.Attention is focussing of consciousness. It is one of the signs of trained will. It is found inmen of strong mentality. It is a rare faculty. Brahmacharya wonderfully develops this power. AYogi who possesses this faculty can even fix the mind on an unpleasant object for a very long time.Attention can be cultivated and developed by persistent practice. All the great men of the world whohave achieved greatness have risen up through this faculty.It is through the power of attention that mind carries out all its activities. Attention is thebasis of will-force. Therefore cultivate the power of attention.Attention may be either subjective or internal on an idea or objective or external on anyobject. Throw your entire attention into whatever you happen to be doing at the moment. It is easyto fasten the mind on an object which the mind likes best. Practise attention on unpleasant tasks,from which you have been shrinking before on account of their unpleasantness. Throw interestupon uninteresting objects and ideas. Hold them on before your mind. Interest will slowly manifest.Many mental weaknesses will vanish. The mind will become stronger and stronger.AN ILLUSTRATION OF SINGLE-MINDED CONCENTRATIONThere was a workman who used to manufacture arrows. Once he was very busy at his work.He was so much absorbed in his work that he did not notice even a big party of a Raja with hisretinue passing in front of his shop.

They make a serious blunder. In thebeginning, it is loathing.

Many spiritualaspirants leave off the practice of concentration of mind after some time as they find it difficult topractise. They also make a grave mistake like the medical students. In the beginning of practice,when you struggle to get over the body-consciousness, it will be disgusting and troublesome. It willbe a physical wrestling. The emotions and Sankalpas will be abundant. In the third year of practice,the mind will be cool, pure and strong. You will derive immense joy. The sum total of pleasures ofthe whole world is nothing when compared to the Ananda derived from the meditation. Do not giveup the practice at any cost. Plod on. Persevere. Have patience (Dhriti), Utsaha (cheerfulness) andSahasa (tenacity, application). You will succeed eventually. Never despair. Find out by seriousintrospection the various impediments that act as stumbling blocks in your concentration andremove them with patience and efforts one by one. Do not allow new Sankalpas and new Vasanas tocrop up.

Meditation proceedsfrom the mind only. The help of the mind is always needed either for perception of an object or forthe understanding of Brahman.

For, whatwe do, what we think and what we speak of leave their impressions on the ether of the room and, ifno care is taken to avoid them, they will exert their influence on the aspirantís mind and, renderinghis mind perverse and restive, make him incapable of attending to the devotion. The words uttered,the thoughts cherished, the deeds done are not lost; they are always reflected on the subtle layers ofether encircling the room where they are done and affect the mind invariably.

Do not allow the mind to think of any physical or mental enjoyment.When it indulges in these thoughts, give it a good hammering. Then it will move towards God. Justas the Ganga flows continuously towards the sea, thoughts of God should flow continuouslytowards the Lord. Just as oil, when poured from one vessel to another, flows in an unbroken,continuous stream, just as the harmonious sound produced from the ringing of bells falls upon theear in a continuous stream, so also the mind should ëflowí towards God in one continuous stream.There must be a continuous divine Vritti-Pravaha, Svajatiya-Vritti-Pravaha, from the Sattvic mindtowards God through continuous Sadhana.You must have a mental image of God or Brahman (concrete or abstract) before you beginto meditate. When you are a neophyte in meditation, start repeating some sublime Slokas or Stotras(hymns) for ten minutes as soon as you sit for meditation. This will elevate the mind. The mind canbe easily withdrawn from the worldly objects. Then stop this kind of thinking also and fix the mindon one idea only by repeated and strenuous efforts.

DoVijatiya-Vritti-Tiraskara. Renounce the thoughts of objects. Drive them away with the whip ofViveka and Vichara. There is struggle in the beginning. It is trying indeed. But, later on, as you willgrow stronger and stronger and as you grow in purity, Brahma-Chintana becomes easy. You rejoicein the life of unity. You get strength from Atman. Inner strength grows when all the Vishaya Vrittisare thinned out and the mind becomes one-pointed (Ekagra).When you start a fire, you heap up some straw, pieces of paper, thin pieces of wood. The firegets extinguished quickly. You blow it again several times through the mouth of the blow-pipe.After some time it becomes a small conflagration. You can hardly extinguish it now even with greatefforts. Even so, in the beginning of meditation in neophytes, they fall down from meditation in156MEDITATION"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"their old grooves. They will have to lift up their minds again and again and fix on the Lakshya.When the meditation becomes deep and steady, they get established in God eventually. Then themeditation becomes Sahaja (natural). It becomes habitual. Use the blow-pipe of Tivra Vairagya andintense meditation to kindle the fire of meditation.During meditation, note how long you can shut out all worldly thoughts. Watch the mindvery carefully. If it is for twenty minutes, try to increase the period to thirty or forty minutes and soon. Fill the mind with the thoughts of God again and again.Allow the one Brahmic idea to flow gently and continuously. Constantly think of God. Themind should always move towards God. Fasten the mind with a fine silk thread to the lotus feet ofLord Siva or Hari. Drive out foreign or extraneous (worldly) ideas gently. Try to keep up theBrahmakara Vritti by repeating OM orìAham Brahmasmiîmentally very often. The idea ofinfinity, the idea of an ocean of light, the idea of all-knowledge and all-Ananda should accompanythe mental repetition of OM. If the mind wanders, repeat verbally six times the long (Dhirga)Pranava with 312Matras. This process will remove the Vikshepa and all other obstacles.When you begin to sweep a room that was kept closed for six months, various kinds of dirtcome out from the corners of the room. Similarly, during meditation, under pressure of Yoga,through the Grace of God, various kinds of impurities float about on the surface of the mind.Bravely remove them one by one by suitable methods and counter-virtues with patience andstrenuous efforts. The old vicious Samskaras revenge when you try to suppress them. Do not beafraid. They lose their strength after some time. You have to tame the mind just as you tame a wildelephant or a tiger. Do not indulge in vicious thoughts which serve as food for the mind. Make themind Antarmukha (self-introspective). Substitute good, virtuous, sublime thoughts. Feed the mindwith ennobling aspirations and ideals. Old vicious Samskaras will be gradually thinned out andeventually obliterated. Now the Brahmakara Vritti will dawn. Coupled with Brahma-Jnana, this isthe destroyer of Avidya. Allow the Brahmakara Vritti to flow steadily like Tailadhara (continuousflow of oil). Now Niratisayananda (infinite bliss) will flow. At this state, the whole universe willappear as Sat-Chit-Ananda only. This thought also will die. You will then enter Sahajananda state(Advaita-Avastharupa Samadhi).SOME USEFUL HINTSIn meditation, do not strain the eyes. Do not strain the brain. Do not struggle or wrestle withthe mind. It is a serious mistake. Many neophytes commit this grave error. That is the reason whythey get easily tired soon. They get headache and they have to get up very often to pass urine duringthe course of meditation owing to the irritation set up in the micturition centre in the spinal cord.Make no violent effort to control the mind. Do not wrestle with it with force. It is a mistaketo do so. But, rather allow it for a while and let it run and exhaust its efforts. The mind will jump nowlike an untrained monkey first. Gradually, it will slow down. Then you can fix the mind on yourLakshya either on a concrete form or on an abstract idea.Get up at 4 a.m. (Brahma Muhurta). Sit comfortably in the Padma, Siddha, Sukha orSvastika Asana. Keep the head, neck and trunk in one straight line. Relax the muscles, nerves and157MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"brain. Calm the objective mind. Close the eyes. Do not struggle with the mind. Do not voluntarilyand violently drive away intruding thoughts. Gently allow the divine thoughts to flow. Steadilythink of the Lakshya (point of meditation). Have sublime, Sattvic thoughts. Vicious thoughts will,by themselves, vanish.Even if the mind runs outside during your practice in meditation, do not bother. Allow it torun. Slowly try to bring it to your Lakshya (centre). By repeated practice, the mind will be finallyfocussed in your heart, in the Atman, the Indweller of your hearts, the final goal of life. In thebeginning, the mind may run out 80 times. Within six months, it may run 70 times; within a year, itmay run 50 times; within 2 years, it may run 30 times; within 5 years, it will be completely fixed inthe Divine Consciousness. Then, it will not run out at all even if you try your level best to bring itout, like the wandering bull, which was in the habit of running to gardens of different landlords foreating grass, but which now eats fresh gram and extract of cotton seeds in its own resting place.If there is much strain in meditation, reduce the number of hours for a few days. Do lightmeditation only. When you have regained the normal tone, again increase the period. Use yourcommon-sense all throughout Sadhana. I always reiterate on this point.Those who meditate for four or five hours at one stretch can have two Asanas, either Padmaand Vajra or Siddha and Vajra, in the beginning. Sometimes, the blood accumulates in one part ofthe legs or thighs and gives a little trouble. After two hours, change the Asana from Padma orSiddha Asana to Vajrasana or stretch the legs at full length. Lean against a wall or a pillow. Keep thespine erect. This is the most comfortable Asana. Join two chairs. Sit on one chair and stretch the legson another chair. This is another contrivance.Pose or Asana is really mental. Try to have a mental Padma or mental Siddha Asana. If themind is wandering, you cannot have a steady body or a steady physical pose. When the mind issteady or fixed in Brahman, steadiness of the body automatically follows.Have the one all-pervading Bhavana (feeling). Deny the finite body as a mere appearance.Try to keep up the feelings always. Whatever elevates you, you can take it up for your advantagejust to elevate the mind and then continue your prolonged meditation.You must daily increase your Vairagya, meditation and Sattvic virtues such as patience,perseverance, mercy, love, forgiveness, purity, etc. Vairagya and good qualities help meditation.Meditation increases the Sattvic qualities.Just as you conserve the energy by observing Mouna (vow of silence), so also you will haveto conserve the mental energy by stopping useless thinking. Then you will save abundant reserveenergy for meditation.Remember these three word-images: PURIFICATION,CONCENTRATION,ABSORPTION.Repeat them mentally during meditation. This is a triplet. Remember this triplet. Purify the mind.Get rid of Mala (impurities such as Kama, Krodha, etc.). Perform selfless, desireless actions. Thiswillpurifythemind.PractiseUpasana,Pranayama,TratakaandRajayogic158MEDITATION"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"ìChitta-Vritti-Nirodha.î This will help Ekagrata. Then practise constant and deep meditation. Themind will be absorbed eventually.ìPranavo dhanuh saro hyatma brahma tallakshyam uchyate;Apramattena veddhavyam saravan tanmayo bhavet.îìOm is the bow, mind is the arrow and Brahman is the mark to be aimed at. Brahman is to behit or pierced by him whose thoughts are concentrated. Then he will be of the same nature(Tanmaya) as Brahman, as the arrow becomes one with the aim when it has pierced it.î(Mundakopanishad, II-ii-4)Sit on Padma or Siddha Asana. Close the eyes. Concentrate the gaze on the Trikuti (spacebetween the two eyebrows). Now, chant Dhirga Pranava (long OM) forcibly for five minutes. Thiswill remove Vikshepa or tossing of the mind. Concentration will ensue. Now repeat OM mentallywith Brahma-Bhavana. Whenever the mind begins to wander, again chant OM verbally. As soon asthe mind gets calm, mentally repeat OM again. The same process can be adopted for Sagunameditation also.Those who have knowledge of the flow of the five Tattvas in the nostrils can very rapidlyadvance in meditation. There is an intimate connection between the mind and the five Tattvas.When Agni-Tattva flows through the nostrils, mind is much agitated and meditation is interrupted.During the flow of the Akasa-Tattva, meditation is very favourable. A knowledge ofìSvara-Sadhanaî or ìSvarodayaî as it is popularly termed is an indispensable necessity for thosewho take up to meditation.Just as a very skilful archer, in shooting at a bird, is aware of the way in which he takes hissteps, holds the bow, the bow-string and the arrow at the time when he pierces the birdóìStandingin this position, holding thus the bow, thus the bow-string and thus the arrow, I pierce thebirdîóand ever afterwards would not fail to fulfil these conditions that he might pierce the bird,even so should the aspirant note the conditions such as suitable food thus: ìEating this kind of food,following such a person, in such a dwelling, in this mode, at this time, I attained to this meditationand Samadhi.îAs a clever cook, in serving his master, notes the kind of food that he relishes and henceforward serves it and gets gain, so the aspirant too notes the conditions such as nourishment, etc., atthe moment of attaining meditation and Samadhi and, in fulfilling them, gets ecstasy again andagain.MEDITATION WITH EYES OPENIn the beginning, when you are a neophyte, you can close your eyes to remove thedistraction of mind, as you are very weak. But, later on, you must meditate with eyes open, evenduring walking. You must keep your balance of mind even when you are in the bustle of a city. Thenonly you are perfect. Why do you close your eyes during meditation? Open your eyes and meditate.Think strongly that the world is unreal, that there is no world, that there is Atman only. If you can159MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"meditate on Atman even when the eyes are open, you will be a strong man. You will not be easilydisturbed.BENEFITS OF MEDITATIONAgni (fire) is of two kinds, viz., Samanya Agni (ordinary fire) and Visesha Agni (specialfire). Samanya Agni is hidden in all trees and woods. It is of no use for burning purposes. ViseshaAgni that is formed by rubbing a match or rubbing two pieces of wood is useful for cooking andother purposes. Similarly, there is Samanya Chaitanya (ordinary intelligence or consciousness) thatis pervading everywhere. There is also Visesha Chaitanya (special intelligence). SamanyaChaitanya cannot destroy the ignorance or Avidya of men. It is only the specialintelligenceóAtmakara Vritti or Avichhinna Visesha Chaitanya that can destroy the Mula Ajnana,the primitive ignorance that envelops the Svarupa (Brahman or Existence). This specialintelligence is developed when a man meditates on the Infinite with a pure heart.In contemplation, you are in spiritual contact with the unchanging Light. You are cleansedof all the impurities. This Light cleanses the soul which touches it. The sun-glass is exposed to thelight of the sun and the straws that are underneath catch fire. So, within yourself, if you have anopen heart devotedly lifted up to God, the Light of His purity and love, illumining this open soul,will consume all your shortcomings in the fire of Divine Love. The Light brings enhanced energyand great comfort.This purifying process leads to a deeper insight into Truth. This is the action of Grace of theLord upon the soul in meditation. In this inflowing Grace, there forthwith arises that Light of themind into which God is sending a ray of His unclouded Splendour. This Light is vastly potent.If you can meditate for half an hour, you will be able to engage yourself with peace andspiritual strength in the battle of life for one week through the force of this meditation. Such is thebeneficial result of meditation. As you have to move with different minds of a peculiar nature inyour daily life, get the strength and peace from the meditation and you will have no trouble andworry then.All actions, whether internal or external, can be done only when the mind is united with theorgans. Thought is the real action. If you have control over the mind by steady practice, if you canregulate your emotions and moods, you will not do foolish and wrong actions. Meditation will helpa lot in checking various emotions and impulses.Meditation acts as a powerful tonic. It is a mental and nervine tonic as well. The holyvibrations penetrate all the cells of the body and cure the diseases of the body. Those who meditatesave doctorís bills. The powerful, soothing waves that arise during meditation exercise a benigninfluence on the mind, nerves, organs and cells of the body. The divine energy freely flows likeTailadhara (flow of oil from one vessel to another) from the feet of the Lord to the different systemsof the Sadhakas.Considerable changes take place in the mind, brain and the nervous system by the practiceof meditation. New nerve-currents, new vibrations, new avenues, new grooves, new cells, new160MEDITATION"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"channels are formed. The whole mind and the nervous system are remodelled. You will develop anew heart, a new mind, new sensations, new feelings, new mode of thinking and acting and a newview of the universe (as God in manifestation).The fire of meditation, annihilates all foulness due to vice. Then suddenly comes knowledgeor Divine Wisdom which directly leads to Mukti or final emancipation.Real peace and Ananda (bliss) manifest only when the Vasanas are thinned out andSankalpas get extinguished. When you fix the mind either on Sri Krishna or Siva or Atman even forfive minutes, Sattva Guna is infused into the mind. Vasanas are thinned out and Sphurana ofSankalpa becomes less and less. You will feel peace and bliss during the five minutes. You cancompare this Ananda from meditation with the transitory sensual pleasures. You will find that thisAnanda from meditation is a million times superior to sensual pleasure. Meditate and feel thisAnanda. Then you will know its real value.You will get the full Ananda of the divine glory only when you merge deep into silentmeditation. When you are on the border-land of divinity of God, when you are at the threshold ofGod, when you are in the outer skirts, you will not get the maximum peace and bliss.These are the benefits that are derived by the Yogic students who practise meditationsystematically. They are Santi (peace), Santosha (contentment), Abhaya (fearlessness), peculiarspiritual Ananda (bliss), unruffled state of mind in worldly difficulties, Nischala Sthiti (steadiness),inspiration, intuitive perception, Sattvic qualities and absence of anger (Akrodha), egoism andRaga-Dvesha (like and dislike).Develop the Prakamya, the divine vision (Divine Drishti), Jnana-Chakshus byconcentration, purification and meditation.HOW TO DEVELOP VIRTUES BY MEDITATIONExamine your character. Pick some distinct defect in it. Find out its opposite. Let us say thatyou suffer from irritability. The opposite of irritability is patience. Try to develop this virtue bymeditation on the abstract virtue of patience. Regularly, every morning, sit down at 4 a.m. in Padmaor Siddha Asana in a solitary room for half an hour and begin to think on patience, its value, itspractice under provocation, taking one point one day, another on another day and thinking assteadily as you can, recalling the mind when it wanders. Think of yourself as perfectly patient, amodel of patience and end with a vow: ìThis patience which is my true self, I will feel and showfrom today.îFor a few days, probably, there will be no change perceptible. You will still feel and showirritability. Go on practising steadily every morning. Presently, as you say an irritable thing, thethought will flash into your mind, unbidden: ìI should have been patient.î Still go on in practice.Soon, the thought of patience will arise with the irritable impulse and the outer manifestation will bechecked. Still go on practising. The irritable impulse will grow feebler and feebler until you findthat irritability has disappeared and patience has become your normal attitude towards annoyances.161MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"In this manner, you can develop various virtues as sympathy, self-restraint, purity, humility,benevolence, nobility, generosity, etc.CHAPTER 33EXPERIENCES AND OBSTACLES IN MEDITATIONWHAT HAPPENS DURING MEDITATIONIn meditation, new grooves are formed in the brain and the mind moves upwards in the newspiritual grooves. When the mind becomes steady in meditation, the eyeballs also become steady. AYogi whose mind is calm will have a steady eye. There will be no winking at all. The eyes will belustrous, red or pure white. When you enter into very deep, silent meditation, the breath will notcome out of the nostrils. There may be occasional slow movement of the lungs and the abdomen.During normal exhalation the air comes out 16 digits. When the mind gets concentrated, it willbecome less and less. It will come to 15 then 14, 13, 12, 10, 8 and so on. From the nature of thebreathing, you can infer the degree of concentration of an aspirant. Watch the breath very carefully.Man tries to grasp the abstract through forms. After the mind has been purified, an abstractimage is formed in the purified mind by Sravana (listening to spiritual discourses and holyscriptures) and Brahma-Chintana. This abstract image melts later on into deep Nididhyasana. Whatis left behind is Chinmatra or Kevala Asti (pure Existence alone).In Nididhyasana or profound and continued meditation, thinking ceases. There is only oneidea of ìAham Brahmasmi.î When this idea also is given up, Nirvikalpa Samadhi or SahajaAdvaita-Nishtha ensues. Just as salt melts in water, the Sattvic mind melts in silence inBrahmanóits Adhishthana (substratum).EXPERIENCES IN MEDITATIONVarious persons get various spiritual experiences. There cannot be a common experiencefor all. It depends upon the temperament, mode of Sadhana, place of concentration and variousother factors. Some hear melodious sounds in the ears. Some see lights. Some get Ananda (spiritualbliss). Some get both Prakasa and Ananda. During meditation, you may experience that you arerising from your seat. Some experience that they fly in the air.LightsThe Divine light comes not through open doors, but only through narrow slits. The aspirantsees the Divine Ray as a sunbeam passing through a chick into a dark room. It is like a ëflash oflightning.í This sudden illumination chokes all sounds of words. The aspirant is spell-bound inecstasy and awe. He trembles with love and awe, just as Arjuna did when he had the162MEDITATION"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"Virat-Visvarupa-Darsana of Lord Krishna. So bright and glorious is the Light environing theDivine that the initiate is dazzled and bewildered.During meditation, the colour of lights that you see varies according to the Tattva that flowsthrough the nostrils. If there is Agni-Tattva, you will see red-coloured lights. If Akasa-Tattva flows,you will have blue-coloured lights. If Apas-Tattva (water) prevails, you will see white-colouredlights. If there is Prithvi-Tattva, you will have yellow lights. If there is Vayu-Tattva, you will seeblack colour. You can change the Tattva by various ways. But the best way is by thought. ìAs youthink, so you also become.î When the Agni-Tattva flows, think intently of Apas-Tattva.Apas-Tattva will begin to flow soon.RaptureDuring meditation, you get rapture or ecstasy. It is of five kinds viz., the lesser thrill,momentary rapture, flooding rapture, transporting rapture and all-pervading rapture. The lesserthrill is only able to raise the hairs of the body (like the goose skin). The momentary rapture is likethe productions of lightning, moment by moment. Like waves breaking on the seashore, theflooding rapture descends rapidly on the body and breaks. Transporting rapture is strong and liftsthe body up to the extent of launching it into the air. When the all-pervading rapture arises, thewhole body is completely surcharged, blown like a full-bladder.Crossing the Body-ConsciousnessAspirants are eager to get spiritual experiences soon. As soon as they get them, they areafraid. They are awfully alarmed when they go above the body-consciousness. They entertain apassing wonder whether they will come back again or not. Why should they be afraid at all? It doesnot matter much whether they return to body-consciousness or not. All our attempts are mainlydirected towards getting over this body-consciousness. We are used to certain limitations. Whenthese limitations suddenly drop away, we feel that there is no definite base left to stand upon. That isthe reason why we are afraid when we go above the body-consciousness. That is a novelexperience. Courage is needed. Bravery is an indispensable requisite. Sruti says, ìNayam-atmabalahinena labhyahóThis Atman can hardly be attained by weak (timid) persons.î All sorts offorces have to be encountered on the way. A dacoit or an anarchist can easily realise God, becausehe is fearless. A push in the right direction is only necessary for him. How Jagai and Madhai, roguesof the first water, became very good saints! They pelted stones at Nityananda, the disciple of LordGouranga. Nityananda won them by pure divine love. Dacoit Ratnakara became Sage Valmiki.Visions of SpiritsSometimes, bad spirits will trouble you. They may have ugly, fierce faces with long teeth.Drive them with your strong will. Give the word of command: ìGet out.î They will go away. Theyare vampires. They are elementals. They will not do any harm to the Sadhakas. Your courage willbe tested here. If you are timid, you cannot march further. Draw power and courage from the Atmanwithin, the inexhaustible Source (Avyaya). You will come across very good spirits also. They willhelp you a lot in your onward march.163MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"There is a kind of vision one occasionally gets during meditation. You may behold adazzling light with abrupt motion. You may behold a head of marvellous form, of the colour of aflame, red as fire and very awful to look at. It has three wings of marvellous length and breadth,white as a dazzling cloud. At times they would beat terribly and again would be still. The head neverutters a word, but remains altogether still. Now and again, there is beating with its extended wings.During meditation, some of the visions that you see are your own materialised thoughts,while some others are real, objective visions.BREAK VEIL AFTER VEILIf you get experiences of the glimpses of Self during intense meditation, if you see a blazinglight during meditation and if you get spiritual visions of angels, archangels, Rishis, Munis,Devatas and any other extraordinary spiritual experiences, do not fall back in terror. Do not mistakethem for phantoms. Do not give up the Sadhana. Plod on. Persevere diligently. Break veil after veil.If there is any error in Sadhana (meditation), at once consult the senior Sannyasins orrealised souls and remove the mistake. If your general health is sound, if you are cheerful, happyand strong, physically and mentally, if the mind is peaceful and unruffled, if you get Ananda inmeditation and if your will is growing strong, pure and irresistible, think that you are improving inmeditation and everything is going all right.March on boldly. Do not look back. Cross the intense void and darkness. Pierce the layer ofMoha. Melt the subtle Ahankara now. Svarupa will shine by itself. You will experience the Turiya(Arudha state).OBSTACLES TO MEDITATIONObstacles to meditation are really from within. Environments are from within; you createyour own environments. Try to be happy in whatever situation you are placed. Do not complain.Bear sufferings. You can conquer Nature. Maya is Tuchha (nothing) or Alpa (small or non-entity)for a Brahma-Jnani.The obstacles to meditation are only from within. Sleepiness, passions, confused state of themind, Manorajya (building castles in the air) are the chief obstacles that stand in the way of fixingthe mind on God or Brahman. The five hindrances to meditation, viz., sense-desire, ill-will,sloth-torpor, flurry-worry and perplexity should be removed. For, when these are not removed,meditation cannot arise. The mind that lusts after many things through sense-desire is notconcentrated on one object; or being overcome by sense-desire, it does not enter upon the progressof meditation in order to put away the sensuous element. The mind that is harassed by ill-willconcerning an object does not proceed at once. The mind that is overcome by sloth and torpor isunwieldy. Obsessed by worry and flurry, it does not repose, but flirts about. Struck by perplexity, itdoes not go on the path that leads to the attainment of meditation and Samadhi. Obstacles tomeditation are thus really from within. They are not from without. Train the mind properly.164EXPERIENCES AND OBSTACLES IN MEDITATION"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Laya (sleep), Vikshepa (tossing of mind from one object to another), Kashaya (memory ofsensual pleasures) and hidden Vasanas and Rasasvada (the happiness derived from SavikalpaSamadhi) are four stumbling blocks in meditation.Tandri and ManorajyaWhen the mind has been withdrawn from objects through Vairagya and Uparati, do notallow it to go into sleep or Manorajya (fancies and wild imagination). When you constantlycontemplate on the meaning of the MahavakyaëAham BrahmasmiíorëTat Tvam Asiíthrough theprocess of Mahavakyanusandhana, all the Vishayas (seeing, hearing, touching, tasting andsmelling) will stop. But, owing to the force of Samskaras, Manorajya (building castles in the air)will continue. Mind builds castles in the air. This is termed Manoratha in Sanskrit. This is a seriousobstacle to meditation. It should be stopped by Vichara. Sometimes, during the course ofmeditation, the mind suddenly slips into its old grooves for sleeping. People think that they aremeditating, while they are actually sleeping. A mixture of drowsiness (Tandri) and Manorajya(building castles in the air, reverie) is mistaken by aspirants for deep meditation and Samadhi. Themind appears to be established in concentration and free from Vikshepa (distraction). This is amistake. Alasya and Stabdhata (stupefaction arising from fear or wonder, mental restlessness andmental depression) are other disturbing factors in meditation.Closely watch the mind. Make it Ekagra (one-pointed) and allow it to rest on the SvarupaBrahman). Be thoughtful, careful and vigilant. Stand up for ten minutes and dash cold water on theface and head, if drowsiness comes in. Remove the two serious obstacles of Tandri and Manorajyaby Vichara, Pranayama and light, Sattvic diet. Tandri and Alasya are removed by Pranayama,Sirshasana, Sarvangasana and Mayurasana and light, Sattvic diet. Find out the disturbing causesand remove them. Avoid the company of those whom your mind dislikes. Do not argue. Do notcontradict. Do not try to convince persons who are unreasonable and undeveloped. Talk little.Observe Mouna. Live alone. In this way, you can avoid all sorts of excitements. Have constantSatsanga. Study elevating books such as the Yogavasishtha, the Upanishads, etc. HaveBrahma-Bhavana. Repeat OM with meaning and feeling. All depressing thoughts will melt away.If you are alert and if by protracted efforts and incessant, vigilant Svarupa-Chintana(meditation on Brahman), you get over the obstacles of sleep, Manorajya, etc., the steadyBrahmakara Vritti and Brahma-Jnana will dawn in no time. Ajnana will vanish. You will beestablished in Sahaja Paramananda state. All Sanchita (accumulated) Karmas will be burnt up in thefire of wisdom.Dreams in MeditationVarious sorts of fantastic dreams trouble some aspirants very much. Sometimes, there is amixture of meditation and dreams. The presence of dreams denotes that you are not yetwell-established in deep meditation, that you have not removed Vikshepa (tossing of the mind) andthat you have not done constant, intense Sadhana. As the phenomenon of dreams is very peculiarand inexplicable, it is very difficult to control dreams unless you wipe out all the Samskaras in theKarana Sarira (causal body) and control all thoughts. As you grow in purity, Viveka andconcentration, dreams will decrease.165MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"DepressionVery often, depression comes in meditation in neophytes owing to previous Samskaras,influence of astral entities, evil spirits, bad company, cloudy days, bad stomach owing toindigestion and loaded bowels in constipation.

Toomuch salt, too much chillies, too much sweets cause intense thirst and disturb meditation. Too muchtalking, too much walking and too much mixing disturb the mind in meditation.Impulses disturb meditation. All obscure subconscious impulses should be controlled bythe intellect and will. Sex-impulse and ambition are two real disturbing factors in meditation. Theycarry on guerilla warfare. They attack the Sadhakas again and again. They appear to be thinned outfor some time. They get revived often. They should be extirpated by great efforts, Vichara, Viveka(power of discrimination between Atman and Anatman, Self and non-Self) and Sivoham-Bhavana.It is the sound that sets the mind in motion. It is the sound that makes the mind to think.Sound disturbs the mind a great deal in meditation. A sound with meaning disturbs more than asound without meaning. A continuous sound as the silent murmur of a river is not so disturbing asan abrupt, sudden, sharp, broken sound. The mind does not feel a sound when it is used to it. Youfeel only when the clock stops.Tushnimbhuta AvasthaTushnimbhuta Avastha is a quiet state of the mind wherein there is neither attraction norrepulsion for objects for a short time. It occurs in the Jagrat state. It is a neutral state of the mind. It isan obstacle to meditation. It should be avoided. It is mistaken by ignorant Sadhakas for Samadhi.KashayaKashaya means colouring. Raga, Dvesha and Moha are the Kashaya or colouring of themind. Kashaya is the subtle influence in the mind produced by enjoyment and left there to fructifyin time to come and distract the mind from Samadhi. This is a serious obstacle to meditation. It doesnot allow the Sadhaka to enter into Samadhi-Nishtha. It induces the subtle memory of pleasuresenjoyed. It is hidden Vasana. From the Samskara, Vasana originates. Samskara is the cause andVasana is the effect. It is a kind of Mala (impurity of mind). Constant Vichara coupled withBrahma-Bhavana is the only potent remedy to eradicate this dire malady Kashaya.166EXPERIENCES AND OBSTACLES IN MEDITATION"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"Sattvic VrittisDuring meditation, when your mind is more Sattvic, you will be inspired.

Vichara and Brahma-Bhavana are the only helps to attain this higheststate.MEDITATION AND WORKHe who meditates is not able to work. He who works is not able to meditate. This is notbalance. This is not equanimity. The two principles, meditation and action, must be well-balanced.You must be able, if you are ready to follow the divine injunction, to take up whatever work you aregivenóeven a stupendous workóand leave it the next day, with the same quietness with which youtook it up and without feeling that the responsibility is yours. You must be able to work hard in theworld with tremendous force and, when the work is over, you must be able to shut yourself up in acave as an absolute recluse for a long time with great peace of mind. That is balance, that is realstrength. Then only you have gone beyond the qualities (Gunatita). ìHe, O Pandava, who hateth notradiance (Sattva) nor outgoing energy (work), nor even sloth and slumber (Moha) when present,nor longeth after them when absentóhe is said to have crossed over the qualitiesî (Gita, XIV-22).When you advance in the spiritual practice, it will be very difficult for you to do meditationand office work at the same time, because the mind will undergo double strain. Those who practisemeditation will find that they are more sensitive than the people who do not meditate and, becauseof that, the strain on the physical body is enormous. The mind works in different grooves andchannels with different Samskaras during meditation. It finds it very difficult to adjust to differentkinds of uncongenial activities. As soon as it comes down from the meditation, it gropes indarkness. It gets bewildered and puzzled. The Prana (energy) which moves inward in differentgrooves and channels and which is subtle during the meditation has to move in new, differentchannels during worldly activities. It becomes very gross during work. It has to work in differentgrooves and channels. When you again sit for meditation in the evening, you will have to strugglehard to wipe out the newly acquired Samskaras you have gathered during the course of the day andget calm and one-pointedness of mind. This struggle sometimes brings in headache.It behoves, therefore, that advanced Grihastha Yogic students (householders) will have tostop all the worldly activities when they advance in meditation, if they desire to progress further.They themselves will be forced to give up all work, if they are really sincere. Work is a hindrance inmeditation for advanced students. That is the reason why Lord Krishna says in the Gita, ìFor a sage167MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"who is seeking Yoga, action is called the means; for the same sage who is enthroned in Yoga (stateof Yogarudha), serenity (Sama) is called the means.î Then, work and meditation becomeincompatible like acid and alkali or fire and water or light and darkness.REASONS FOR FAILURES IN MEDITATIONSome practise meditation for a period of 15 years and yet they have not made any realprogress at all. Why? This is due to lack of earnestness, Vairagya, keen longing for liberation andintense, constant Sadhana. There is always a complaint amongst the aspirants, ìI am meditating forthe last 12 years. I have not made any improvement. I have no realisation.î Why is it so? What is thereason? They have not plunged themselves in deep meditation into the innermost recesses of theirhearts. They have not properly assimilated and saturated the mind with the thoughts of God. Theyhave not done regular, systematic Sadhana. They have not disciplined the Indriyas perfectly. Theyhave not collected all the outgoing rays of the mind. They have not made the self-determination, ìIwill realise this very second.î They have not given the full 100% of the mind or 16 annas of themindótheir full mindóto God. They have not kept an increasing flow of Divine Consciousnesslike the flow of oil (Tailadharavat).You will have to note very carefully whether you remain stationary in the spiritual path evenafter many years of spiritual practice or whether you are progressing. Sometimes, you may godownwards also, if you are not very vigilant and careful, if your Vairagya wanes and if you are slackin meditation. Reaction may set in.Just as the man who foolishly run after two rabbits will not catch hold of any one of them, soalso a meditator who runs after two conflicting thoughts will not get success in any one of the twothoughts. If he has divine thoughts for ten minutes and then worldly conflicting thoughts for thenext ten minutes, he will not succeed in anything, in getting at the Divine Consciousness. You mustrun after one rabbit only with vigour, strength and one-pointedness. You are sure to catch it. Youmust have only divine thoughts at all times. Then you are sure to realise God soon.You must not be too hasty in longing for the fruits at once, when you take to meditation.Haste makes waste. A young lady perambulated an Asvattha tree (Filicus religiosa) 108 times forgetting an offspring and immediately touched her abdomen to see whether there was a child or not.It is simply foolishness. She will have to wait for some months. Even so, if those who read worksdealing with Atma-Jnana and who do take delight therein will not be hasty in longing for the fruitsat once, but will meditate regularly and gradually upon them, then the mind will, by degrees, beripened and, in the end, the endless Atman will be reached; and they will get Atmasakshatkara(Self-realisation).You will have to exert in the beginning to get an equilibrium of mind. Later on, you willhave a habitual balanced state of mind. So is the case with meditation. After some years of practice,meditation becomes habitual.168EXPERIENCES AND OBSTACLES IN MEDITATION"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"CONDITIONS FOR SELF-REALISATIONJust as you saturate water with salt or sugar, you will have to saturate the mind with thoughtsof God and Brahman, with divine glory, Divine Presence with sublime soul-awakening spiritualthoughts.

Assimilationfirst and then saturation. Then comes realisation, at once, without a momentís delay. Remember thetriplet always: ìAssimilationóSaturationóRealisation.îFree yourself from the base thoughts of the mind, the various useless Sankalpas(imaginations). Just as you render the turbid water pure by the addition of clearing nut (strychnospotatorum), so also you will have to make the turbid mind, filled with Vasanas and false Sankalpas,pure by Brahma-Chintana (thinking and reflecting on the Absolute). If the mind constantly dwellson sensual objects, the conception of the reality of the universe will surely increase. If the mindceaselessly thinks of Atman (Absolute), the world appears like a dream. Mark the word ìceaseless.îThis is important. Then only there will be true illumination. Then only there will be dawn ofspiritual knowledge. The Jnana-Surya (the Sun of Knowledge) will rise in the firmament ofChidakasa (knowledge-space).You will find very often these terms in the Gita:ìAnanyachetahî ìMatchittahîìNityayuktahî ìManmanahî ìEkagramanahî ìSarvabhavah.îThese terms connote that you willhave to give your full mind, entire 100% mind to God.

True liberation results from thedisenthralment of the mind. Those who have freed themselves from the fluctuation of their mindscome into possession of the supreme Nishtha (meditation). Should the mind be purged of all itsimpurities, then it will become very calm and all the worldly delusion, with its births and deaths,will be soon destroyed.Mind exists on account of ìI.î ìIî exists on account of mind. ìIî is only an idea in the mind.ìMindî and ìIî are identical.

In Samadhi, there is neither Dhyana norDhyata (neither meditation nor meditator). The meditator and meditated, the thinker and thethought, the worshipper and the worshipped become one or identical. The Triputi (triad) vanishes.The mind loses its own consciousness and becomes identical with the object of meditation. Themeditator has dissolved his personality in the sea of God, drowned and forgotten there till hebecomes simply the instrument of God. When his mouth opens, it speaks Godís words withouteffort or forethought through direct intuition and, when he raises his hand, God flows again throughthat to work a miracle.In Samadhi, there is neither seeing nor hearing. There is neither physical nor mentalconsciousness. There is only spiritual consciousness. There is only Existence (Sat). That is yourreal Svarupa. When the water dries up in a pool, the reflection of the sun in the water also vanishes.When the mind melts in Brahman, when the mind-lake dries up, the reflected Chaitanya(Chidabhasa) also vanishes. The Jivatman (personality) goes away. There remains Existence alone.Turiya is the spiritual condition where there is no play of mind, where the mind is dissolvedin Brahman. It is the ìfourth dimension,î where there is infinite Brahmic bliss. It is not a conditionof inertia, forgetfulness or annihilation. It is a state of absolute consciousness which baffles allattempts at description. It is the final goal of all. It is Mukti. It is Moksha.Generally, when you have what you call dreamless sleep, it is one of two things; either youdo not remember what you dreamt of or you fell into absolute unconsciousness which is almostdeathóa taste of death. But, there is the possibility of a sleep in which you enter into an absolutesilence, immortality and peace in all parts of your being and your consciousness merges intoSatchidananda. You can hardly call it sleep, for there is perfect ìawareness.î In that condition, youcan remain for a few minutes or hours or days; but, these few minutes give you more rest andrefreshment than hours of ordinary sleep. You cannot have it by chance. It requires a long training.Samadhi is not a stone-like inert state as many people imagine. A life in the spirit (Atman orDivine) is not annihilation. When the self is bound down to its empirical accidents, its activities arenot fully exercised and, when the limitations of the empirical existence are transcended, theuniversal life is intensified and you have enrichment of Self. You will have a rich inner life. Youwill have an expanded cosmic life and supra-cosmic life, too.THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF SAMADHIA Raja Yogi gets Nirodha-Samadhi through Chitta-Vritti-Nirodha (by restraining themental modifications). A Bhakta gets Bhava-Samadhi through Prema of the Lord. A Vedanti gets170EXPERIENCES AND OBSTACLES IN MEDITATION"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"Bheda-Samadhi through Mithyatva-Buddhi and concentration on the idea of the Asti-Bhati-Priya(the Anvaya method).It is only the Raja Yogi who attempts the annihilation of the Vrittis, the Nirodha Samadhi(ìYogaschittavrittinirodhahîóPatanjali Yoga Sutras, I-2). A Vedanti has always Atma-Bhava,Brahma-Bhava whenever he comes across objects. So he does not try to annihilate the Vrittis. Thereis no Pratyahara for him. There is no Bahirmukha Vritti for him. He rejects Nama-Rupa and takesAsti-Bhati-Priya (Bheda-Samadhi). A Bhakta sees Narayana or Krishna in all objects. He also doesnot check the Vrittis. He, like the Vedanti, changes his mental attitude. It is the mind that creates allthe differences and separateness. The world is all Ananda, only if you change your angle of vision,your mental attitude. You will find heaven on earth.You can bring down to normal objective consciousness a Raja Yogi or Bhakti Yogi or JnanaYogi by mere shaking of the body or blowing a conch. Chudalai brought down her husbandSikhidhvaja from Samadhi by shaking his body. Lord Hari brought Prahlada down from hisSamadhi by blowing His conch.SAMADHI THROUGH HATHA YOGAA Hatha Yogi draws all his Prana from the different parts of his body and takes it to theSahasrara Chakra (thousand-petalled lotus) at the top of the head. Then he enters into Samadhi(superconscious state). Therefore it is very difficult to bring him down to objective consciousnessby merely shaking his body. Hatha Yogis have remained buried underneath the earth in Samadhi foryears together. They plug the posterior nostrils through Khechari Mudra (a king of Hatha YogicKriya) with their long tongues.Prana and Apana that move in the chest and anus respectively are united by the Yogicprocesses of Jalandhara, Mula and Uddiyana Bandhas and the united Prana-Apana is driven into theSushumna Nadi of the spinal canal. The Pranas, when thus driven, draw up the mind also along theSushumna Nadi which is otherwise known as Brahma Nadi. During the ascent in the SushumnaNadi, the three Granthis or knots, viz., Brahma-Granthi at Muladhara-Chakra, Vishnu-Granthi atManipura-Chakra and Rudra-Granthi at Ajna-Chakra should be cut asunder by strenuous efforts.These knots prevent the ascent of Kundalini. Bhastrika Pranayama breaks down these knots. WhenKula-Kundalini Sakti that lies dormant in the Muladhara-Chakra in the form of a coiled serpentwith 312curves or turns, with the face downwards is awakened by spiritual Sadhana, it ascendsupwards towards Sahasrara Chakra or the thousand-petalled lotus in the crown of the head andtakes along with it the mind and Prana also. When the mind is in the Sushumna, the Yogi is shut outfrom the objective, physical consciousness of the world. He is practically dead to the world, seesvarious visions and moves in the mental, ethereal space (Chidakasa). Samadhi starts.SAMADHI THROUGH RAJA YOGADeep meditation leads to Samadhi or oneness with God. If you can fix the mind for tenseconds steadily on a particular object or Murti, it is Dharana (concentration). Ten such Dharanasbecome Dhyana (meditation). Ten such Dhyanas form a Samadhi. The mind is filled with Atman orGod. Mind loses its own consciousness and becomes identified with the object of meditation171MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"(Tatchitta, Tanmaya, Tadakara). Just as a toy made of salt melts in water, even so, the mind melts inBrahman in Nirvikalpa Samadhi. A sudden stroke of mystic illumination puts an end to all theempirical existence altogether and the very idea or remembrance of such a thing as this world or thenarrow individuality of the spirit in this world absolutely leaves the Self.In trained Yogis, you cannot say where Pratyahara (abstraction) ends and Dharana(concentration) begins; where Dharana ends and Dhyana (meditation) begins; where Dhyana endsand Samadhi (superconscious state) begins. The moment they sit on the Asana, all the processesoccur simultaneously with electric or lightning speed and they enter Samadhi at their consciouswill. In the neophytes, Pratyahara first takes place. Then Dharana begins. Then Dhyana slowlycommences. Before Samadhi manifests, their minds, getting impatient and tired, drop down.Constant and intense Sadhana, with light but nutritious food, will bring about sanguine success ingetting Samadhi.YOGIC SAMADHI AND VEDANTIC SAMADHIThere is a difference between the Nirvikalpa state of a Yogi and the Nirvikalpa state of aVedantin. The former concerns the mind. The latter concerns the pure Atman or Brahman only. InYogic Samadhi, Dhyeya remains. Dhyeya means the object of meditation. In Vedantic Samadhi,Kevala Asti (Existence alone) remains.SAVIKALPA SAMADHI AND NIRVIKALPA SAMADHIThe ground floor represents the life of passion in the sense-universe. The first storeycorresponds to Savikalpa Samadhi. The second storey is tantamount to Nirvikalpa Samadhi. Thethird storey represents the Sahajavastha or a Jivanmukta. The moving of a bullock cart can becompared to Savikalpa Samadhi. It stops. This is Nirvikalpa Samadhi. The bulls are detached. Thisis Sahajavastha. When the Yogi has reached the last perfect stage of meditation and Samadhi, thefire whereof burns surely all the residue of his actions, he at once gets Liberation (Jivanmukti) inthis very life.In Savikalpa Samadhi, there is Triputi or the triadó Dhyata (the meditator), Dhyana(meditation) and Dhyeya (object of meditation). In Nirvikalpa Samadhi, this Triputi vanishes(Triputirahita). Nirvikalpa means ìfree from all sorts of modifications and imaginations.î The mindcompletely melts in Brahman. The happiness or bliss that you get in Savikalpa Samadhi is termedRasasvada. This is also an obstacle (Pratibandha or Vighna) for further spiritual progress. It makesyou stop here. It cannot liberate you. You must further march onwards to attain the highestNirvikalpa state wherein lies your whole freedom.ADVANTAGES OF BHAKTI YOGA SADHANAThe practices of Hatha Yoga and Raja Yoga are not suited to the majority of men in this age,while they have always an irresistible charm for such practices because of their apparentconcreteness and promise of speedy rewards. A vast majority of persons have no good physique androbust constitution. They are weaklings. In this age, children beget children. There are babymothers. Devotion or Bhakti Yoga is, therefore, easy and safe. Any man can repeat the Name of172SAMADHI"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"God. Anyone can sing His praise. Without a mother, you cannot have a son. Even so, withoutAnanya Bhakti (one-pointed or single-minded devotion), you cannot have Jnana. When Bhakti isfully ripe, Brahma-Jnana dawns of itself, without much effort on the part of the Sadhaka.Any Mantra is very powerful. It purifies the mind. It induces Vairagya. It causesAntarmukha Vritti. Every Mantra has a Rishi who gave it; a Devata as its informing power; the Bijaor seed, a significant word which gives it a special power; a Sakti or energy of the form of theMantra, i.e., the vibration-forms set up by its sounds; the Kilaka or the pillar, that which supportsand strengthens the Mantra. Kilaka is a sort of plug which conceals the Mantra-Chaitanya. Byconstant and prolonged repetition of the Mantra with Bhava (feeling or right mental attitude) andconcentration, the Mantra-Chaitanya is awakened. Then the Sadhaka gets Mantra-Siddhi. There isa spiritual current in all Mantras. A Mantra takes the devoteeís soul first to one centre and then toanother and so on, till access is gained to the goal or final region. Dhruva had Darshana of Lord Hariby repeating the Dvadasakshara (consisting of twelve letters) MantraëOm Namo BhagavateVasudevayaígiven by Rishi Narada. Prahlada had Darshana of Mahavishnu by repeating theìNarayanaî Mantra. Valmiki realised God by repeating ìMara-Maraî (which becomesRama-Rama during the course of repetition). Tukaram of Maharashtra became one with LordKrishna by chanting always ìVittala-Vittala,î the name of the reputed image of Sri Krishna atPandharpur.CONTEMPLATIONóFILLINGóIDENTIFICATIONMark the three processes that take place in the mind during meditation. These are:CONTEMPLATION,FILLING,IDENTIFICATION. This is another triplet. Remember these threeword-images. Repeat them mentally while doing Sadhana. It will help you a lot really.Contemplate on Atman. Fill the mind with Atman. Then the mind becomes identified withBrahman in accordance with what is known as the Bhramarakitanyaya (analogy of wasp andcaterpillar). As you think, so you become. Think you are Brahman; Brahman you will become.When the mind is withdrawn from the objects and deep reflection sets in, the objectiveconsciousness is shut up; Savitarka Samadhi commences. Ratiocination, analysis and synthesis (apriorianda posterioriways of reasoning), investigation and abstract reasoning take place. This isSamadhi with reasoning. Evil thoughts cannot enter now. The mind is Sattvic.Deep study of philosophical works with Chitta Suddhi is itself a form of Samadhi. The mindhere is free from worldly thoughts.When your meditation becomes deep, you generally operate through the subtle KaranaSarira only. The Karana-Sarira consciousness becomes your normal consciousness. Yogis have anormal Karana-Sarira consciousness. Bhaktas like Lord Gouranga, Tukaram, Tulasidas identifiedthemselves with their Karana Sarira and had a normal Karana-Sarira consciousness. A Bhakta ofKarana-Sarira consciousness is an occupant of Brahma Loka even when living in the fleshytabernacle. He is one with Brahman or Hiranyagarbha. He has Divine Aisvarya; yet he has a thinethereal body. He keeps up his individuality. A whirlpool is one with the whole mass of the water.

Similar is the case with the Bhakta who has a life with hisKarana-Sarira in Isvara.HOW TO ATTAIN SAMADHI THROUGH VEDANTAPurify the mind by Japa, Pranayama, Satsanga, Svadhyaya, Dana, Yajna, Tapas and selflessservice. Then fix it on God. Destroy Sankalpa-Vikalpa of the mind. Unite the currents of the mindwith the spiritual current. Abandon the idea or notion of ìI,î ìhe,î ìthou,î Ghata (pot), Pata (cloth),i.e., Nana-Bhava, Dvaita-Bhava. Have Brahma-Bhavana instead. Then Samadhi or superconsciousstate will supervene automatically.There are four ways of destroying the ego or Ahankara, viz., two Advaitic methods (positiveand negative), one Bhaktasí method of ungrudging, unreserved, absolute self-surrender(Atmanivedana) and the fourth, complete self-sacrifice of Nishkama Karma Yogis.The negative Vedantic method is denial: ìI am not the body, I am not the mind.î ìBrahmasatyam jaganmithya jivo brahmaiva na-aparah:óBrahman alone is real. The world is unreal. Jivais identical with Brahman.î World includes the body. Meditate on this idea. Aham will vanish. Thepositive method is that everything is Self only: ìSarvam khalvidam brahmaóAll is Brahman.There is nothing but Brahman.îINTELLIGENT MODERATION IN SADHANAINDISPENSABLE FOR SAMADHIShould you hold communion with Brahman, devoid of mental fancies and modifications,then the great bondage of the mind will cease, all doubts will vanish and all Karmas will perish:ìBhidyate hridayagranthih chhidyante sarvasamsayahkshiyante chasya karmani tasmin drishte paravareîThe stupid bee, knowing that flowers are blossoming in a certain tree and setting out with aterrific speed, passes it; and, in turning back, reaches it when the juice is finished.

Another stupidone, through fear of spilling oil, dare not attempt the task. A clever one, on the other hand, fills thetube with calm and steady force and gets the reward.Even so, when the sign appears, an aspirant makes strong efforts, saying: ìI will quicklyattain Samadhiî; but, his mind, through excessive strain, becomes distracted and he is not able toattain ecstasy or Samadhi. Another person, seeing fault in excessive strenuousness, gives up theeffort, saying: ìWhat is the use of Samadhi to me now?î His mind, through over-slackness ofenergy, becomes idle and he too is not able to attain Samadhi. But, he who releases with anintelligent, calm, uniform force the mind that is slack ever so little from slackness and the distractedmind from distraction, drives it towards the goal or Lakshya (i.e., Brahman) and attains NirvikalpaSamadhi (Advaita-Nishtha). Become like such a one.Be silent. Know thyself. Know That. Melt the mind in That. Truth is quite pure and simple.CHAPTER 35MANONASAMind, through ignorance and indiscrimination, considers its false personality to be true andthinks it is the doer of all Karmas and thus becomes egoistic. It imagines that it is in bondage. Itidentifies itself with the Jivatman; it becomes Jivatman itself and takes the responsibility upon itselffor doing good or bad Karmas and enjoying or suffering from their fruits. Hence is mind the doer ofKarmas (actions) and responsibility for the Karmas, therefore, rests with it.Mind is the stealer of Atman. It is a thief. Mind drags the Jivatman into Vishayas (sensualenjoyments). Jivatman is the Abhasa of Chaitanya or reflected intelligence in mind. Mind andJivatman always live together. They cannot be separated. Slay the mind, the stealer of Atman,through Vichara, Manana and Nididhyasana (constant and profound meditation) on Brahman.Mind has the potency of creating or undoing the whole world in the twinkling of an eye.Therefore, slay this mind, the slayer of Atman, whether through the destruction of Vasanas (latentsubtle desires) or the control of Prana or Brahma-Vichara and Mahavakya-Chintana. The bestmeans of disposing of this great danger of Maya involving all in pains is the destruction of mind.175MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"With the destruction of the mind, all the three periods of time vanish into nothing.

They should be practised at a time. So long as these three are not equally practised againand again, the Supreme Seat (Parama Pada) cannot be attained even after a lapse of hundreds ofyears. Through the practice of these three for a long time, the firm knots of the heart are cut withoutdoubt, like the breaking of the threads in a lotus-stalk rent in twain.THE MEANING OF MANONASADestruction of the mind does not mean annihilation of the Self. The Vedantins divide themind into the higher and the lower, of which the lower one leading to desires is asked to bedestroyed.Destruction of desires, annihilation of Ahankara, destruction of Sankalpaóall mean controlof mind or annihilation of mind (Manonasa or Amanaskata). Destruction of egoism, Raga-Dvesha(attraction and repulsion for objects) and all Vasanas alone is Manonasa. Manonasa comes throughthe destruction of the Vasanas. Manonasa does not mean that you should take a sword and cut themind to pieces.Manonasa means the death of the present form of the mind (i.e., the instinctive mind ofemotions and passions), the form which perceives differences where none exists, which identifiesthe Self with the body. Its death really means its transformation into and, therefore, the birth ofcosmic consciousness.Vast majority of persons live in Annamaya Kosha only. Their thoughts are directed towardseating, cleansing the body and putting on neat dress. That is all. Even the so-called educated personslive in Annamaya Kosha only. Sometimes, they live in Manomaya Kosha (mental sheath). Aspiritual aspirant and a Vivekin live in Vijnanamaya Kosha (Buddhi sheath). The VijnanamayaKosha is developed by abstract thinking and reasoning, by systematic meditation,Brahma-Chintana, study of the Upanishads, the Yogavasishtha and the Brahma-Sutras. You mustall develop the Vijnanamaya Kosha by the study of Vedantic literature and pure thinking. Then youare safe. Mind will stop to deceive and torment you.LAYA-CHINTANA OF ANTAHKARANAMind is absorbed in Mahat or Buddhi.

The first is termedìdestruction of the mind with form.î The second is termed ìdestruction of the mind without form.îHOW TO BRING ABOUT MANONASAThere are five ways of effecting Manahkshaya (destruction of the mind). Two are Yogicmethods. Three ways concern Jnana Yoga. (i) When a thought arises, drive it out. Say unto yourself,ìNeti, Netiónot this thought, not this thought. I do not want this thought.î (ii) PratipakshaBhavanaósubstitute a counter-idea, love for hatred, courage for fear, etc. (iii) HaveBrahma-Bhavana. All Sankalpas will die. (iv) Be a Sakshi of the mind. Be indifferent (Udasina). (v)Make the enquiry, ìWho am I?î constantly. All thoughts will die. For a man of Vichara (enquiry),the mind dwindles into an airy nothing. This is easier and more effective than the ìNeti, Netiî orìPratipaksha Bhavanaî method.Sankalpa, desire, Raga, Dvesha, Ahankara and mind are the six bricks of the mansion ofJiva. They are the six links of the chain which constitutes the personalityóJiva. Destruction of onebrick or one link brings about the destruction of the whole edifice or whole chain.Therefore, cut off daily the branches of Sankalpa from this dire tree of Manas and ultimatelydestroy the tree of mind at its root completely. The cutting off the branches is only secondary. Theeradication of the tree by removal of ëIí is the primary thing. Therefore, if through virtuous actionsyou destroy the idea of ëIí which forms the very root of the tree of mind, then it will not spring upagain.Power, possessions, money and knowledge strengthen the Abhimana, i.e., the idea of ëI.íThey thicken the mind also. They should be given up in order to thin out the ëIí and the mind. It isthrough Vairagya and Tyaga that you will have to thin out the mind. When the mind becomesthread-like through the thinning process, it is termed Tanumanasi.The mind can be controlled either through the control of Prana (Hatha Yogic method) or thearrest of the fluctuation of the mind (Raja-Yogic methodóìYogas-chittavrittinirodhahîofMaharshi Patanjali). Control of mind leads to stoppage of breath and control of breath leads tostoppage of mind, because Prana and mind are under one Sambandha. During meditation, thebreathing becomes very slow. Those who practise meditation may be aware of this fact. This goesto show that when the mind is concentrated, Prana stops by itself without any effort.177MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"Pranayama cannot bring about Manonasa (annihilation of the mind).

In such a perception, the seer,sight and the seen become one.MANONASA AND MANOLAYAManolaya is a temporary absorption of the mind in the object of meditation. When youmeditate on the form of Bhagavan Sri Krishna, the mind becomes absorbed in the form of BhagavanSri Krishna temporarily.Manolaya takes place during sleep. The mind gets involved into its cause, the Mula Avidya.Manolaya is not sufficient for attainment of Jnana. In Manolaya, the mind is prone to revive.Manolaya cannot save you from bondage. Manolaya cannot give you Mukti. It is only Manonasa(annihilation of the lower mind) that can give you liberation. In Manonasa, the mind revives not andis dead. Manonasa is brought about by Brahma-Jnana.CHAPTER 36THE MIND COMPAREDRESTLESS LIKE A GHOSTThe mind is like a ghost which is restless. Once, a Brahmin Pundit, through Mantra-Siddhi,had control over a ghost. The ghost said to the Pundit, ìI can do any work for you in a minute. Youmust always be giving me some work. If you leave me even for a second without work, I will at oncedevour you.î The Brahmin agreed. The ghost dug a tank for the Brahmin, ploughed the fields anddid various sorts of work in a short time. He was not able to give the ghost any further work. Theghost threatened the Brahmin, ìNow there is no work for me. I will devour you.î The Brahmin wasquite puzzled. He did not know what to do. He went to his Guru and explained to him his wholesituation. His teacher said, ìO Chela, use your common-sense or Yukti (Buddhi). Install a big,stout, soft, wooden post in front of your house. Apply castor oil, wax and other greasy substances tothe post. Ask the ghost to get up and get down the whole day and night.î The disciple actedaccordingly and controlled the ghost. The ghost became very helpless. Even so, you must givealways some kind of work or other to the mind, e.g., Japa, meditation, Svadhyaya, service, Kirtan,prayer, Pranayama. You must keep it fully occupied. Then only the mind can be easily controlled.You can be established in physical and mental Brahmacharya.178MANONASA"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"SCATTERS LIKE MERCURYThe activity of the mind is compared to the mobile mercury. If you place a small quantity ofmercury on the ground, it will split into several small pieces and run in various directions. Youcannot collect them again. Even so, the rays of the mind are scattered in various directions, insensual objects. It becomes difficult to collect the dissipated mental rays. Vairagya and Abhyasawill help in making the mind one-pointed.SHAMELESS AS A STREET DOGThe mind can be compared to the shameless, wandering street-dog with so many wounds onthe body. The dog goes to the door of a house. Someone throws a stone at it and it runs away. It goesto another house. There also, it gets a good hitting and thrashing. Then it comes back again to thefirst house wherefrom it received a pelting of stone. Someone again throws a big stone and it getsanother wound. The dog will never leave off its wandering habit in spite of the repeated bad woundsit receives. Even so, this mind always runs towards sensual objects, even though it experiencesimmense miseries, griefs and sorrows, pains and tribulations. It will never leave off its old habits.You will have to thrash this shameless mind and take it to its source, Brahman, by chanting OMwith feeling again and again. Let it taste the Ananda, the Infinite Bliss of Atman. Then alone it willfind its rest in OM, its original Abode of Eternal Peace.JUMPS LIKE A TENNIS BALLWhen you play tennis, the ball goes very high in the sky and the next second, it comes downto the ground. Even so, the mind jumps high to the divine glory, dwells on Sattvic divine virtues fora very short time in the beginning of meditation in neophytes and, at once falls down into its oldrotten grooves, nasty ruts, foul avenues, stinking channels and dwells on useless, abominablethoughts. The developing soul, the new flame shudders and quivers at the sight of these shockingthoughts. It does not matter; you need not worry. Just as you raise the ball again to the sky by a good,fresh cut or twist or gentle beating, so also, you will have to raise the mind again with effort to theheights of divine glory and divine consciousness.REFLECTS LIKE A MIRRORThe mind of a man is compared to a mirror in which Reality (Brahman) is reflected. Theextent you know about Reality depends upon the state of your mindówhether it corresponds to thefull wealth of Reality or not. Colours are not revealed to the blind nor music to the deaf norphilosophical truths to the feeble-minded:ìNayam-atma balahinena labhyah.îThe revelation willbe imperfect or distorted if there is any taint or imperfection. The selfish desires and passions getbetween the instrument of mind and the Reality to be revealed. Hidden subtle desires (GuptaVasanas) attack the Sadhakas (aspirants) in a variety of ways. Sadhakas should be ever watchingthe mind through serious introspection. When the personality of the subject affects the nature of theinstrument, the reflection becomes blurred.Again, if you place a big mirror in front of a dog and keep some bread in front, the dog atonce barks by looking at its reflection in the mirror. It foolishly imagines that there is another dog.179MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"Even so, man sees his own reflection only through his mind-mirror in all persons, but foolishlyimagines like the dog that they are all different from him and fights on account of hatred, malice andjealousy.OSCILLATES LIKE A PENDULUMIn a clock, the pendulum moves to the right and thence to the left. When the children play ona swing, the swing moves high to one side and at once rises high to the other side. Even so, in thecase of aspirants who are not established or well settled in deep meditation, their minds alsoresemble the pendulum or the swing. They sometimes think of Karma Yoga, enter the world and doactions; while, at other times, they run to the Himalayas for leading a contemplative life. There isstruggle inside whether to take up Karma Yoga or Dhyana Yoga. You must decide it once for alland be firm in practising Karma Yoga or in shutting yourself up in a room or cave for some years inthe practice of meditation. To run for work into the world for six months and then again into theforest for six months for meditation is no good. Decide one way or the other. Cut asunder theGordian Knot. Work till you get Chitta-Suddhi. Then meditate till you realise. This is the wisestcourse.DROPS DOWN LIKE A TENNIS BALLIf you allow a tennis ball to drop from the highest stair-case, it will not stop at any of themiddle steps in the stair-case. It will come down to the ground floor at once. Even so, if you do nottake the proper precautions, if you mix with the worldly-minded persons, you will get a quickdownfall like the tennis-ball. The mind that you elevated by spiritual practices in six or eight yearswill become tainted with various sorts of impurities. Beware, therefore, O aspirants!MISCELLANEOUS COMPARISONSMind is compared to aSMALL VESSELwhich contains small articles, because mind alsocontains Vasanas, Trishnas, Samskaras, Vrittis, ideas, Gunas, etc.Mind is compared to aDHARMASHALAor public resting place, because the Vrittis such aslust, greed, anger, pride, hypocrisy, egoism, etc., take their rest in the mind.

Such a release alone leadsto the attainment of Moksha. The mind becomes of the nature of Jnana by dint of the efforts towardsspiritual direction; but becomes of the nature of the universe through Ajnana. If the mind is bathedin the water of Jnana and cleansed of all its impurities, then the shining Moksha will disclose itselfin its native effulgence to those who strive after it. The real bliss is that which arises when the mind,divested of all desires through the eternal Jnana, destroys its subtle form.THE GLORY OF JNANA YOGAA Hatha Yogi starts his Sadhana with the body and Prana. A Raja Yogi starts his spiritualpractice with the mind. A Jnana Yogi starts his spiritual Sadhana with the Buddhi and Will. To bemore accurate a Jnana Yogi starts directly with Brahman. He repeats constantly: ìAhamBrahmasmi.î He who is attempting to fix the mind on Brahman is really doing the highest KarmaYoga, highest Yajna, highest duty and highest charity. He need not visit Tirthas. He need notdistribute charity.QUALIFICATIONS FOR THE STUDENT OF JNANA YOGAA complete detachment from the outward things, the manifold objects of sense, togetherwith a capacity for metaphysical abstraction and concentration on inward things are demanded181MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"from a spiritual aspirant or an earnest seeker after Truth. The voice of the pure spirit cannot be heardtill all superficial organs cease to exist.For the aspirant in the Jnana-Yogic path, you have the Four Means of Salvation,Sadhana-Chatushtaya, in Vedantic preliminary practice. One of the four means is Shatsampat(six-fold virtues). Of these six virtues, Sama, Dama and Samadhana are really Yogic practices tocontrol the mind. Sama represents the Chitta-Vritti-Nirodha of Raja Yogis by Vasana-Tyaga, Damacorresponds to Pratyahara. Samadhana is Ekagrata of Yogis. Yoga and Jnana are the two wings ofthe Hamsa bird (Moksha).Sama (calmness of mind through Vasana-Tyaga) and Dama (restraint of the Indriyas) aretwo important items of Shatsampat. Sama and Dama are really Yogic Kriyas. When this Sadhana isover, you will have to take recourse to Sravana and Manana. When you take to deep Nididhyasana,seclusion is necessary for three years.The purification of the mind will not, by itself, bring about Brahma-Jnana. The purifiedmind is rendered fit to receive the transcendental light and Ananda. You will have to take refuge inSravana, Manana and Nididhyasana after purifying the mind.Sravana, Manana and Nididhyasana (hearing of Srutis, reflection and then meditation onBrahman) are the three Vedantic processes for the attainment of Jnana (Jnanadvaita-Nishtha). Thisis the ladder with three rungs through which the Vedanti ascends to Brahman. If you do Sravana orhearing of the Srutis once, you must do Manana ten times (reflection of what you have heard) and ahundred times or a thousand times Nididhyasana (profound and constant meditation). Then onlyreal fruit is attained.A man with Antarmukha Vritti, changed angle of vision, Vairagya and Mumukshutva isalone fit for the study of Vedanta and the practice of OM and Jnana Yogic contemplation. Such aman only will be really benefited. When a man gets a firm conviction that names and forms areunreal and the Adhishthana at their back is real, then it is said that his angle of vision is changed.It is only through your dauntless energy and own indefatigable efforts that you can getBrahma-Jnana. Guru and Sastras can show you the path and remove your doubts. Anubhava ofAparoksha kind (direct, intuitive knowledge) is left for your own experience. A hungry man willhave to eat for himself. He who has a severe itching will have to scratch for himself.MIND AND BRAHMANThe capacity of the mind to think exists, because it is enlightened by the Brahman or Atmanshining within and it is by that the mind is capable of activity. Those who have realised the Self saythat the mind is pervaded by Brahman. ìHe who dwells in the mind, is within the mind, whom themind does not know, whose body is the mind, who from within rules the mind is thy Self, the InnerRuler, immortal.î (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, III-vii-20) ìThat which one cannot think with themind, but that by which they (wise sages) say the mind is made to think, know that alone to beBrahmanî (Kena Upanishad, 5). Mind is a mere beggar. It borrows its light and intelligence fromthe Inner Ruler, the Atman that is self-effulgent. Just as a piece of iron moves in front of a magnet,182ESSENCE OF JNANA YOGA"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"so also, this mind moves in front of the Inner Ruler. It plays, thinks, feels and imagines before theDivine Presence, just as a prime minister plays and works before the presence of the king. The mindshines in its borrowed feathers. It appears like Chaitanya (pure consciousness). How can the mindwhich gropes in darkness, which changes in every minute, which has a birth from Mahat and alsodeath (dissolution) in Prakriti be termed as pure consciousness?The thoughts are various and changing. Now good thoughts manifest. Five minutes later,vicious thoughts appear. The mind is very fickle and changing. It cannot, therefore, be thechangeless Atman or Kutastha-Nirvikalpa (unchanging, rock-seated) Brahman.JADA AND CHAITANYAMind, Buddhi, Indriyas and all other things are Jada. That thing which has no knowledge ofitself and of other things also is called Jada. Brahman only is Chaitanya-Vastu. Chaitanya or Chit orChetana is Svayamprakasha (self-luminous) and Sarva-Prakasha (illuminating everything). Itilluminates the mind, Buddhi and all Indriyas internally; and externally the sun, the moon, the stars,lightning, fire, etc.BRAHMAN IS CHAITANYAWho sees the defects in the sunówhether it shines brightly or whether it is obscured byclouds? It is the eye. Who sees the defects in the eye whether it is a cataract or Timira or not? It is theBuddhi (intellect). Who sees the defects in the Buddhiówhether there is confusion or clarity in it?Who illumines the Buddhi? It is Aham (Infinite ëIí). This Aham is the Kutastha or Atman orBrahman, illuminator of everything.Who illuminates in dreams? There is no other light there. The mind is not self-luminous. Itis Jada. It is Brahman who illuminates the objects in the dream.Suppose there is a blazing light at night. You stand at a distance. Something stands betweenyou and the light as an obstruction and you cannot see the light. But you can clearly see the objectsthat are illuminated by the light. Though you cannot see the light directly, you clearly conclude thatthere must be a big light through the perception of the objects. So also, there must be aself-luminous illuminator behind this Nature. That illuminator, the ìLight of lightsî (Jyotisham-apitajjyotih) is the Adhishthana (support) for this illusory world.If you sit down and realise that you only think by virtue of the one Life and that the mind,animated by the one Life into the act of thinking, is a part of the whole which is God, then you willargue that your mind is out of existence as a separate entity and the result is that mind and bodyphysically (so to speak) disappear and the only thing that remains is BeingóExistence which is notexplicable in words.BRAHMAN IS SAKSHIRaga, Dvesha, pleasure and pain, Kartritva (agency), Bhoktritva are the Dharmas of themind only. Atman is Sakshi (perceiver) and Asanga (unattached). Like a crystal (Sphatika) which,183MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"though tinged with the seven colours is yet unaffected by them, Atman too is not affected by theactions of the mind.The very idea of creation suggests that there must be a creator. The very idea of mattersuggests that there must be a spirit. The very idea of changing phenomenon suggests that there mustbe an unchanging noumenon. The very idea of a changing mind suggests that there must be anunchanging Sakshi and controller (Niyamaka) for the mind. He is Kutastha Brahman that clearlyunderstands everything and is a Sakshi or silent witness of the Jiva and his activities.You are able to see the objects only. But the Sakshi or Kutastha Brahman sees the mind, itsmodifications, the Jivatman or reflected consciousness and the various objects of the universe.BRAHMAN IS AKHANDATime, space and Vastu (substance) are the three categories of the mind. Every object hasthree kinds of limitations (Pariccheda). Grapes, for instance, are obtainable in a certain season onlyand in certain places only. So grape has got Desa-Kala-Pariccheda (limitation by space and time). Ithas got Vastu-Pariccheda also. You cannot find grape in a mango tree. But, the existence ofBrahmanorSatchidanandaisfreefromthesethreekindsofPariccheda(Trividha-Pariccheda-Rahita), because He is eternal, infinite and the essence and Adhishthana forall substances.An Englishman is different from an Indian. There is Svajatiya Bheda. A tree is differentfrom a stone. There is Vijatiya-Bheda. There is difference between a fruit, flower and leaves in thetree. There is difference between a hand, arm, leg, foot, etc. This is Svagata-Bheda. Brahman hasnot got these three kinds of Bheda. There cannot be another Brahman, because Infinity is One. Sothere is no Svajatiya-Bheda in Brahman. The world has emanated from Brahman. It is illusory. So itcannot bring Vijatiya-Bheda for Brahman. World is Brahman Himself. Sat-Chit-Ananda are notthree entities. They are one. It is only Sabda-Bheda, like water, Pani, Jala. Sat is Chit. Chit is Sat.Chit is Ananda. So there is no Svagata-Bheda in Brahman. Bheda is a mental creation produced byspace, colour, size, etc.If anything is free from the three kinds of Pariccheda (limitation) of Desa, Kala, Vastu andthree kinds of Bheda as described above, then it is termed Akhanda. You can ascribeAkhanda-Lakshana to that substance. That Lakshana can be attributed to Brahman only.ENQUIRY OF ëWHO AM I?íMoksha (release from the Samsaric wheel of birth and death) comes through Jnana(knowledge of Atman or God). Jnana comes through Vichara (right enquiry) of ëWho am I?í orunderstanding and thinking of the right essential significance of the Mahavakya, ìTat Tvam Asiî(Thou art That) of the Upanishads.

This absence of Ahankara can come only when you become impersonal, whenyou become the Sakshi, when you identify yourself with Brahman (Absolute).ìI am neither Prana nor the senses.

The melodious music188ESSENCE OF JNANA YOGA"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"of birds is also a creation of Maya. It prevents us from hearing the natural Nada of OMóthesweetest Pranava Dhvani. That Nirvana state which transcends all nature is Jnana state.Jnana-Mouna is that state wherein the mind remains merged in Brahman or Atman orSvarupa. In this state, there is not the slightest trace of the notion ofíI.í As there is no mental activityand as there is no doer, all the Karmas are burnt in the Jnanagni (fire of wisdom). The Jiva feels thathe is entirely different from the five Koshas or sheaths, as he identifies himself with the Atman.In Jnana (Absolute), there is neither East nor West, neither dawning nor setting, neitherincrease nor decrease, neither sitting nor standing, neither life nor death, neither wakingconsciousness nor dream state, neither talking nor lecturing, neither thinking nor knowing, neitherlight nor darkness. The threeóactor (Karta), action (Karma) and instrument (Karana)ó will shineas one in the Self of Jnanis. What an exalted state it is! It is simply marvellous. It is wonderful. Onebecomes speechless. It can never be adequately described in words.I sat on Padmasana. I meditated on Atman. I forgot myself and the surroundings. I sawsomething which I had never seen upto this time. I heard a Nada which I had never heard upto thistime. There was a sensation and knowledge that I was absolutely free from all sorts of attachment. Ihad an experience of new knowledge. The thought of Atman continued for some time. I had a novelexperience of pure bliss. It is a void full of Light and Knowledge and Bliss free from vicissitudes ofthis world.When the Self is once recognised and realised, it can never be forgotten. The impression ofthe recognition of the Self, if once made, can never be obliterated from the mind. It sticks to themind always.MUKTIMukti is for the mind only. Mukti is for Prakritti. It is not for the Jiva. Jiva is alreadyBrahman. Jiva is ever free. He is identical with Brahman. When the water dries up, the reflection ofthe sun in water also vanishes. Even so, when the mind-lake dries up by extirpation of all Sankalpasand Vasanas, the reflection of intelligence, Chidabhasa in the mind-lake, also vanishes. The nameJivatman disappears. Ego goes away.CHAPTER 38THE MIND IN A JIVANMUKTAìDehabhimane galite vijnate paramatmanYatra yatra mano yati tatra tatra samadhayahîìWith the disappearance of the attachment of the body and with the realisation of the SupremeSelf, to whatever object the mind is directed, one experiences Samadhi.î189MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"Amana is a Sanskrit term which means ëwithout mind.í ìAmanaskataî is a condition wherethere is no mind. It is mindlessness. You will find this in Jivanmuktas or liberated sages.RESIDUAL SATTVAJivanmukta is a sage free (from the trammels of births and deaths) while living. Even in thecase of a Jivanmukta, though the instinctive mind with low desires is destroyed, the spiritual Sattvicmind does not perish. Like flowers and fruits latent in a seed, a residue of Sattva, the cause ofintelligence, rests always in the heart. If you say that his mind is completely annihilated as soon ashe attains Jnana, Jivanmukti state is impossible. How will he be able to do Vyavahara (worldlydealings) without an instrument viz., the mind? A Jnani identifies himself with the all-pervadingBrahman and uses his mind and body as His instruments for Vyavahara (worldly activities); anAjnani identifies himself with his body. There have been cases of Jivanmuktas like Raja Janakawho attained Jnana and who utilised mind and body in this manner for the well-being of thehumanity at large.Sri Rama and Sri Krishna were ever resting on Brahman even when they were ruling theirkingdoms. They were ever very conscious of their essential Sat-Chit-Ananda Brahmic nature, eventhough they assumed human forms. They utilised their minds and bodies as their instruments whenthey were doing various activities.EMPIRICAL EXISTENCE AND EXISTENCE-REALITYEven this world does not disappear as absolutely as is supposed in Jivanmukti state.Empirical world, in fact, ceases to exist. But, this does not mean annihilation. It merely means thatexistence changes its form and colour, as it were, for the Absolute. It is empirical existence and notall-existence which vanishes. Existence-Reality remains, but its limited forms vanish. Externalityhas to go; spatial and temporal views of things must go; causal determination of one thing byanother must go; many-ness and oneness must go. This is inevitable. But, the universe with all itsreality will not go even for the liberated soul. It will merely change its form, meaning andsignificance. Nothing will disappear except a false view, a limited horizon, erroneous idea and acircumscribed vision. Fact, Reality, Existence, however, will remain as fundamental as ever; butthe viewpoint will change.The mind of the Jnanis cannot be termed as a mind, but only as Tattva (Reality). That whichgets differentiated through diverse objects is the mind. The mind of a Jnani, on the other hand,becomes stainless, like copper transmuted into gold by alchemic process. The mind of a Jnani isSattva itself, while persons without Jnana will follow the path chalked out by their minds. When aJnani sees outside, he may simply see, but the Vritti may not assume Vishayakara as in the case ofworldly-minded persons. Just as the mind is free from any Vishayakara in deep-sleep state in all, itis free from any Vishayakara in the waking state also in a Jnani. The world appears to him as a meredream. He dwells in Brahman even while working. In those that have cognised their Self, the pureVasanas with which they perform Karmas will not entail them rebirths. The mind of such a Jnani iscalled Sattvic, but a mind without Jnana is generally termed Manas.190THE MIND IN A JIVANMUKTA"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"THE PERFECTLY BALANCED MINDNow, mark the nature of the mind of a Jivanmukta. It is perfectly balanced under allcircumstances. His mind is always cool and unaffected by the Dvandvas (pairs of opposites). Hismind is free from Harsha and Soka (elation and depression). It is neither elated by enjoyments nordepressed by sorrow and grief. Without being affected by the pleasures or pains of enjoymentsthough moving in them, the mind of a Jivanmukta will become inured to them. Through internalcontentment and freedom from pains, there will arise in the Jnani an equanimity of mind in allcircumstances and at all places. Even when pains and the rest attaching themselves to his bodyexhibit themselves on his face, his mind never writhes under them or their antithesis. It is free fromimpure Vasanas. There will be no anger or desire. There will not arise any evil impulse of Kama insuch a mind. There is not the least longing for objects. His mind is above worldly things. He is notaffected by the world. He need not have a separate room or Asana. He need not close the eyes. Heneed not do any Pratyahara of the senses.A mind which, though apparently enjoying the diverse objects, does not, in reality, enjoythem, may be stated to be Brahman itself.DUAL CONSCIOUSNESSAn occultist learns through self-control and discipline to work on two planes at once, that is,to be partly out of his body at the same time when he is working on the physical plane; so that, whilehe is writing or speaking, he may be doing other things with his astral body. When such is the casewith an occultist, little need be said of a full-blown Jnani who is resting on his own Svarupa. A Jnanihas dual consciousness. He has consciousness of Brahman as well as consciousness of the world.He sees the world as a dream within himself. A Jnani is always in Samadhi. There is no ëinSamadhií and ëout of Samadhií for a Jnani like that of a Raja Yogi.When you play on the harmonium, you adjust the tune first. It may be fixed either on thesecond reed or the fourth reed according to the strength and power of your voice. Then you begin toplay on the various reeds. The Sapta Svaras are pronounced now. You can play now variousRaga-Raginis. He who is aware of the main Sruti can be compared to a Jnani who knows the Atmanor support for this universe. He who is aware of the Sapta Svara only without knowing thefundamental Sruti is like an Ajnani who is unaware of the Atman, but who has knowledge of thesense-objects only.When you see an object with your eyes, you know that it is through the light of the sun thatyou are able to see it. You have a double Drishti. Similarly, a Jnani has always a double Drishtiwhen he does Vyavahara. Even when he works, he knows he is not working; he is unattached. Eventhough he sees the world, it is all Brahman and Brahman for him.SAMA BHAVA AND SAMA DRISHTIThere is a slight difference between Sama Bhava and Sama Drishti. The former is thecondition of the mind (as balanced in pleasure and pain, gain and loss, heat and cold, victory and191MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"defeat). The latter is the condition of knowledge. The Jnani sees the Atman alone in a scavenger anda king.When you are expecting to meet a friend of yours at the railway station, the mind tries to seehim in several other persons with a like physiognomy (Sadrisya), because the mind is engrossedwith the one idea of meeting a particular friend at a particular time. The mind is very eager to seehim. A lustful young man sees a woman in a pillar tied with a womanís cloth, in fact, everywhere.The mind is charged with very powerful and lustful thoughts. A God-intoxicated man, on thecontrary, sees God in a tree, a stone, boy, child, girl, cow, dogóin fact, in everything.ìSarvamkhalvidam brahma.îA Jivanmukta, though he has infinite powers, cannot express all his Siddhis through hisfinite mind.CHAPTER 39THE POWERS OF A YOGISIDDHIS AND RIDDHISThere are nine Riddhis and eight Siddhis (major) and eighteen Siddhis (minor). The eightSiddhis are Anima (atomic size), Mahima (colossal size), Garima (excessive bulk), Laghima(extreme lightness), Prapti (attainment of whatever you desire), Prakamya (unhampered will),Isatva (lordliness) and Vasitva (control over all senses). Riddhi means affluence. It is inferior toSiddhi.BHUTAJAYAA Raja Yogi gets conquest over the mind (Manojaya) through Nirvikalpa or Nirbija(without seeds or Samskaras) Samadhi and, through Manojaya, gets Bhutajaya also (conquest overthe five elements). Fire will not burn such a Yogi. Water will not drown him. Late Trailinga Swamiof Benares who lived 80 years ago and Sri Jnanadeva of Alandi (near Poona) had various Siddhis.Sri Jnanadeva made his house move to receive Changdeva who was coming on the back of a tiger.He made the Masjid walk. Trailinga Swami used to live for six months underneath the Ganga.KNOWLEDGE OF THE PASTThe Yogi has got the power to plunge deep into the depths of his subconscious mindwherein the Samskaras are embedded and to have direct vision and understanding of the Samskarasof different births through his new Yogic eye. ìSamskara-sakshatkaranat purvajatijnanamî(Patanjali Yoga-Sutras, III-18). He makes the Yogic Samyama (Dharana, Dhyana and Samadhi) onthese latent Samskaras which are only the past experiences in a subtler form. Thus he gets theknowledge of his past life.192THE MIND IN A JIVANMUKTA"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"ASHTAVADHANA AND SATAVADHANAAn untrained mind can only see or hear at a time, but a perfected mind can see and hear atthe same time. It can be linked to several organs, to one or to none. It can be manipulated in any waythe Yogi likes. It can do eight things at a time. This is called Ashtavadhana. It can do hundred thingsat a time. This is Satavadhana.SEPARATION OF ASTRAL BODY FROM PHYSICAL BODYA Yogi separates his astral body from the physical body, travels to different parts of theworld, as well as to higher planes, in the twinkling of an eye and returns to this physical body like abird returning to its prison of a cage. A slender thread of Prana connects the physical and the astralbodies. The moment he gets out of the body, the Yogi sees with his astral vision his physical body asa cast-off slough. The process is a very simple one when you know the Yogic technique ofseparating yourself from the physical body.PSYCHIC SIDDHISóA SOURCE OF GREAT DANGERTO SPIRITUAL SADHAKASA man may have psychic powers and Siddhis through concentration of the mind. But, hemay not have mental purity. Mental purity is of paramount importance for Self-realisation.Do not think too much of psychic Siddhis. Clairvoyance and clairaudience are not worthhaving when far greater illumination and peace are possible without the Siddhis than with them.Why do you care for psychic Siddhis? They are absolutely useless. Shun them ruthlesslyeven when they try to manifest. They will mislead you and cause your downfall. Beware, LordBuddha shunned Mara (temptations and Siddhis). Try to get Brahma-Jnana. Then you will haveeverything. All spiritual Siddhis will welcome you with outstretched hands. You cannot have adownfall then.A Jnani never cares for psychic powers, for he does not need them in his daily life. Throughhis Sat-Sankalpa, a Jnani does whatever a Raja Yogi does through his Yogic Samyama. He simplywills. Whatever he desires, then and there it materialises.193MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 40NECESSITY FOR A GURUìLearn thou this by prostration, by investigation and by service. The wise, the seers of theessence of things, will instruct thee in wisdom.î(Gita, IV-34)Guru or a spiritual preceptor is necessary for aspirants. Some do the practice for some years,independently. Later on, they feel acutely the necessity for a Guru. They come across someobstacles on the way. They do not know how to proceed and how to obviate these impediments.Then they begin to search for a master. This particularly happens in Yogic practice.It is the duty of the Guru to set each of his disciples upon that path of spiritual developmentwhich is best suited to the Chela, one on one path, one on another, according to the Guruís insightinto the innate tendency of each.Isvara is Guru of Gurus. He removes the veil of ignorance and blesses the ignorant Jivas.The aspirant should regard his immediate Guru in the physical form as an incarnation of that Guruof Gurus and should have equal devotion to him also. Guru in the physical form is the main sourceand embodiment of all good and happiness that can accrue to the Chela. The disciple should realisethe supreme necessity of obeying the Guruís commands and behests and keeping his faith in himunsullied and staunch.Lay bare to your Guru the secrets of your heart; and the more you do so, the greater thesympathy, which means an accession of strength to you in the struggle against sin and temptation.SAKTI-SANCHARA OR TRANSMISSION OF SPIRITUAL POWERJust as you can give an orange to a man and take it back, so also spiritual power can betransmitted by one to another and taken back also. This method of transmitting spiritual power istermed Sakti-Sanchara. Like birds, fish and tortoise, the transmitting of spiritual power can be doneby the Guru through touch or sight or willing, and thinking. The transmitter sometimes enters theastral body of the student and elevates his mind through his power. The operator makes the subjectsit in front of him and asks him to close his eyes and then transmits his spiritual power. The subjectfeels the electric current actually passing from Muladhara Chakra higher up to the neck and top ofthe head. He does various Hatha Yogic Kriyas, Asanas, Pranayama, Bandhas, Mudras, etc., byhimself without any instruction, through inspiration. Here Prakriti works herself. The student mustnot restrain his Iccha-Sakti. He must act according to the inner light. The mind is highly elevated.The moment the aspirant closes his eyes, meditation comes by itself. Through Sakti-Sanchara,Kundalini is awakened by the grace of the Guru in the disciple.A spiritual teacher actually transmits his spiritual power to his disciple. A certain spiritualvibration of the Satguru is actually transferred to the mind of the disciple. Sri RamakrishnaParamahamsa actually transmitted his spiritual power to Swami Vivekananda. Lord Jesus did thesame to his disciples. This is Masterís spiritual touch. A disciple of Samartha Ramdas transmitted194THE POWERS OF A YOGI"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"his power to that dancing girlís daughter who was very passionate towards him. The disciple gazedat her and gave her Samadhi. Her passion vanished. She became very religious and spiritual.Mukund Rai, a Maharashtra saint, put the Badshah in Samadhi.By the Guruís Grace, the devotee attains the eight-stepped Yoga (Ashtanga Yoga); by theGrace of Lord Siva, he attains perfection in Yoga which is eternal.CHAPTER 41HINTS TO ASPIRANTSAspirants to Yoga are classified into three degrees: (1) Arurukshu, one who is attempting toclimb the steps of Yoga, (2) Yunjana, one who is busily engaged in the practice of Yoga and (3)Yogarudha, one who has already reached the height of Yoga.INDISPENSABILITY OF INNER PURITYAspirants are very eager for realisation. But, when that realisation actually comes, theybegin to tremble, to quiver. They cannot bear the illuminating blaze of God. They are so puny,impure and weak that they cannot face the mighty brilliance and divine splendour. They have notprepared the vessel to hold on the Divine Light. Mark how Arjuna trembled with fear at the hugecosmic vision of Virat and prayed to Lord Krishna to show him again the usual form with fourhands which represents harmony, perfection, power and wisdom.It is difficult to speak about Brahman. It is still more difficult to understand. It is yet stillmore difficult to practise spiritual Sadhana. This corresponds to the Gitaís teaching, Chapter II-29:ìAs marvellous one regardeth Him, as marvellous one speaketh thereof, as marvellous oneheareth thereof; yet, having heard, none indeed understood.îIt demands a subtle, pure, clear mind, determined will, patience, perseverance and Utsaha(cheerfulness) for the realisation of Brahman.VITAL NEED FOR MORAL STRENGTH AND COURAGEA spiritual aspirant will have to face boldly misrepresentation, calumny andmisunderstanding. That has always been the lot of those who tried to raise themselves above theirfellows. Moral strength and courage are necessary to meet that and to enable that man to maintainhis position and what he thinks right, whatever those around him may think or say or do. People willdespise and persecute you. You will have to stand boldly on your moral footing to live for your ownconvictions. As aspirant who has outgrown the rules of society should act according to the dictatesof his pure conscience and pure reason. Then alone he can grow spiritually.195MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"When anyone rises to fame and power, enemies come in by themselves.

That whichdistinguishes one man from another is personality. In reality, personality is something more thanthis. It includes a manís character, intelligence, noble qualities, moral conduct, intellectualattainments, certain striking faculties, special traits or characteristics, sweet powerful voice, etc. Allthese things put together constitute the personality of Mr. So and so. The sum total of all thesethings makes up the personality of a man. Mere physical characteristics cannot make up thepersonality.What you call an umbrella is really a long stick plus a black cloth and some thin iron pieces.Similarly, what you call ëpersonalityí is really the external physical body, plus brain and thenervous system and the mind which has its seat in the brain.If one man is able to influence many people, we say that such and such a man has a magneticpersonality. A full-blown Yogi or Jnani is the greatest personality in the world. He may be of a215MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"small stature. He may be ugly also. He may be clad in rags. And yet he is a mighty personality, agreat Mahatma. People flock to him in thousands and pay homage to him. A man who has attainedethical perfection by the continued practice of right conduct or Yama and Niyama has also got amagnetic personality. He can influence millions. But he is inferior to a Jnani or a Yogi who has gotfull knowledge of the Self.Dr. Samuel Johnson had an awkward figure, a pot belly and unsymmetrical limbs. But hewas the greatest personality of the age. He was neither a Yogi nor a Jnani. But he had intellectualattainments. He was a great essayist. He had good command of the English language. He wasfamous for his bombastic style. It was called Johnsonian English. Just hear some of his lines: ìWillyou be kind enough to allow my digits into your odoriferous concavity and extract therefrom someof the pulverised atoms which, ascending my nasal promontory, cause a great titillation of all myolfactory nerves?îRich people also have some personality. This is due to the ëMoney-powerí. They may belicentious. Money has its own share in the making up of the personality of man. It infuses in him asort of colouring. The charitable nature may cover up their licentious nature and may send somefragrance abroad. People flock to them. Lord Jesus says: ìCharity covereth a multitude of sins.îCharacter gives a strong personality to man. People respect a man who has a good character.Moral people command respect everywhere. He who is honest, sincere, truthful, kind andliberal-hearted always commands respect and influence at the hands of people. Sattvic virtues makea man divine. He who speaks truth and practises Brahmacharya becomes a great and dynamicpersonality. Even if he speaks a word, there is power in it and people are magnetised.Character-building is of paramount importance if a man wants to develop his personality.Brahmacharya is the root of a magnetic personality. No development of a strong personality ispossible without celibacy.Personality can be developed. Practice of virtues is indispensable. One should try to bealways cheerful. A morose, gloomy man cannot attract and influence people. He is an infectiousparasite amidst society. He spreads gloom everywhere. A man of a jolly nature with the spirit ofservice, with humility and obedience can influence millions. The law of ìlike attracts likeî operatesin the physical and mental planes. A man of strong personality need not send invitations to people.Just as bees come and perch as soon as flowers blossoms, so also people of lesser mind are attractedto men of strong personality, of their own accord.A powerful, sweet voice, knowledge of music, knowledge of astrology, astronomy,palmistry, art, etc., add to the personality of man. One should know how to behave and adjusthimself with other people. You must talk sweetly and gently. This produces a tremendousimpression. You must be polite, civil, courteous. You must treat others with respect andconsideration. He who gives respect to others gets respect. Humility brings respect by itself.Humility is a virtue that subdues the hearts of others. A man of humility is a powerful magnet orloadstone.216PSYCHIC INFLUENCE"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"You must know the ways to approach people. You must know how to talk with them andhow to behave towards them. Behaviour is most important. An arrogant, stubborn and self-willedman can never become a man of strong personality.

Have an amiablenature, a modest and unassuming temperament. You will succeed in your interviews with all bigguns. Take down notes of what you want to speak with them in the course of the interview. Keep asmall memorandum slip in your pocket. Remember the points well and talk slowly and gently. Thenthe man will patiently hear. Do not be agitated in your talks. Do not become nervous. Be bold.

Talk about the important points first and just review in your mind whether youhave finished all the eight points you wanted to talk. In the West, people care for personality. InIndia, people care for individuality and assert: ìAham Asmiîówhich means ìI exist.î They try todestroy the personality to realise the Self.Endeavour to possess a magnetic personality.

You can develop it if you will. ìWherethere is a will there is a wayî is a maxim which is as true today as it was from the time of Adam. Winlaurels of name and fame and attain success in life through a dynamic personality. You can do it.You must do it. You know the science now. I shall back you up.POWER OF SUGGESTIONSYou should have a clear understanding of suggestions and their effects upon the mind. Youshould be careful in the use of suggestion. Never give wrong suggestion which will have destructiveresults to anybody. You will be doing a great harm and a disservice to him. Think well before youspeak. Teachers and professors should have a thorough knowledge of the Science of Suggestionand Auto-suggestion. Then they can educate and elevate students in an efficient manner. InSouthern India, when children cry out in houses, parents frighten them by saying: ìLook here, Balu!Irendukannan has come. (The two-eyed man has come.) Keep quiet. Or I will hand you over to thisman.î ìPuchandi (or ghost) has comeî and suggestions of this sort are very destructive. The childbecomes timid. The minds of children are elastic, tender and pliable. Samskaras are indeliblyimpressed at this age. Changing or obliterating the Samskaras becomes impossible when they grow.When the child grows into a man, he manifests timidity. Parents should infuse courage into theminds of their children. They should say: ìHere is a lion. See the lion in this picture. Roar like a lion.Be courageous. See the picture of Shivaji, Arjuna or Clive. Become chivalrous.î In the West,teachers show the pictures of battlefields to children and say: ìLook here, James! See this picture of217MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"Napoleon. Look at his cavalry. Wonít you like to become a Commander-in-Chief of the army or aBrigadier-General?î They infuse courage into the minds of children from their very childhood.When they grow, these Samskaras get strengthened by additional external stimuli.Doctors should have a thorough knowledge of the science of suggestion. Sincere,sympathetic doctors are very rare. Doctors who have no knowledge of suggestion do more harmthan good. They kill patients sometimes by unnecessarily frightening them. If there is a little coughof an ordinary nature, the doctor says: ìNow, my friend, you have got T.B. You must go to Bhowalior Switzerland or Vienna. You must go in for a course of tuberculin injections.î Poor patient isfrightened. There is not at all any sign of consumption. The case is an ordinary one. It is simplecatarrh of the chest from exposure to chills. The patient actually develops phthisis by fright andworry owing to the wrong destructive suggestion of the doctor. The doctor ought to have told him:ìOh, it is nothing. It is simple cold. You will be all right by tomorrow. Take a purgative and inhale alittle oil of eucalyptus. Adjust your diet. It is better you fast today.î Such a doctor is God Himself.He must be adored. A doctor may say now: ìWell, sir, if I say so, I will lose my practice. I cannotpull on in this world.î This is a mistake. Truth always gains victory. People will run to you as youare sympathetic and kind. You will have a roaring practice.There is healing by suggestion. This is a drugless treatment. This is suggestive therapeutics.By good and powerful suggestion, you can cure any disease. You will have to learn this science andpractise it. All doctors of Homoeopathic, Allopathic, Ayurvedic and Unani systems should knowthis science. They can combine this system along with their own systems. They will have a roaringpractice by this happy combination.Do not be easily influenced by the suggestions of others. Have your own sense ofindividuality. A strong suggestion, though it does not influence the subject immediately, willoperate in due course. It will never go in vain.We all live in a world of suggestions. Our character is daily modified unconsciously byassociation with others. We unconsciously imitate the actions of those whom we admire. We dailyabsorb the suggestions of those with whom we come in daily contact. We are acted upon by thesesuggestions. A man of weak mind yields to the suggestions of a man of strong mind.The servant is always under the influence of the suggestions of his master. The wife is underthe influence of the suggestions of her husband. The patient is under the influence of thesuggestions of the doctor. The student is under the influence of the teacher. Custom is nothing butthe product of suggestion. The dress that you put on, the manners, the behaviour and even the foodthat you eat are all the outcome of suggestions only. Nature suggests in various ways. The runningrivers, the shining sun, fragrant flowers, the growing trees, are all incessantly sending yousuggestions.All the prophets of yore were hypnotists. They knew the science of suggestion fully well.Their words had tremendous powers. Every word they uttered had magic power and a peculiarcharm. All the hearers remained spell-bound. A spiritual preacher produces a sort of hypnosis in theminds of others. The hearers come under the influence of his suggestions.218PSYCHIC INFLUENCE"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"There is power in every word that is spoken. There are two kinds of Vrittis,viz.,Sakti-Vrittiand Lakshana-Vritti in words. In the Upanishads, the Lakshana-Vritti is taken. ìVedasvarupohamîdoes not mean ìembodiment of Vedas.î The Lakshana-Vritti does denote ìBrahmanî who can bereached by the study of the Upanishads alone: by the Sabda Pramana alone.Mark here the power in the words. If anyone calls another ìSalaî or ìBadmashî or ìfool,îhe is thrown into a state of fury immediately. Fight ensues. If you address anyone as ìBhagavanî orìPrabhuî or ìMaharaj,î he is immensely pleased.HYPNOTISM AND MESMERISMA greater mind can influence a smaller mind. This is mesmerism or hypnotism. This is not atall a new science. It is also Anadi. It has existed from beginningless time. It was only Mesmer andBraid who popularised this science in the West. Hindu Rishis knew this science in days long goneby. Demosthenes and Socrates, Visvamitra and Patanjali Maharshi used hypnotism and mesmerismin olden days. It was James Braid, the Manchester surgeon, who gave this name hypnotism to thisscience and who first founded this science in the West. The term ëhypnotismí has a Greek originwhich means sleep.Mesmer was a philosopher, physician and astrologer. He was born in 1784. He died in 1815.He brought in the theory of animal magnetism. He believed that man had a wonderful magneticpower by which he could heal and influence other people. He made use of this power in thetreatment of various diseases. The system of mesmerism is known after his name.All orators possess the power of hypnotism. Consciously or unconsciously they subdue theminds of hearers. The hearers are swayed by the powerful speech of orators. They are charmed, as itwere, for the time being. All the religious preachers and prophets of the world possessed this powerto a remarkable degree.Suggestion is the master-key to hypnotism. The hypnotist suggests and the operator actsimplicitly. The lesser mind implicitly obeys the higher mind. Suggestion is an idea communicatedby the operator to the subject. Suggestion is a science. One should be very clever in putting thesuggestion in a skilful manner. We live in the world of suggestion and under the magic spell andinfluence of hypnotism. Hypnotism is a mighty power in the world. We are all hypnotised by thespell of Maya. We will have to dehypnotise ourselves to obtain a knowledge of the Self. Vedantagives powerful suggestions to dehypnotise ourselves. Hypnotism is a state of mind in whichsuggestions, verbal and visual, are received as true whether they are true or not. There is anirresistible desire to carry out the suggestions. The power of will and the power of suggestion arevery closely linked together.The operator develops his power of hypnosis through the practice of crystal-gazing andother methods of concentration. Pranayama also helps a lot in the development of this power.Brahmacharya also is very essential. A man of loose character cannot become a powerful hypnotist.A man can be hypnotised by gazing or suggestion or passes. The operator makes someëpassesí in front of the subject and the subject passes into a hypnotic state. The passes in the reverse219MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"direction will bring back the subject to normal consciousness. Sometimes, if the hypnotist is apowerful man, he can hypnotise several persons in a group or bunch. That man who resists thesuggestions of the hypnotist cannot be hypnotised so easily. If one believes in the hypnotiser andthinks he can be hypnotised, he can rapidly come under his spell and operation.There is also another variety of hypnotism called the stage hypnotism in which the hypnotisthypnotises the whole audience and shows several tricks. He puts a lady in a small tight box instanding posture, ties her hands and closes the box and then cuts the box with a saw. Afterwards heopens the broken box and the lady comes out without any injury. A famous Fakir ascended theplatform in England with a red rope in his hand, threw it in the air and climbed up through the ropeand then vanished in the air. This is stage-hypnotism. This is the famous ërope-trickí of the Fakir.There was no impression in the plate of a camera. This is a trick only after all. A hypnotisthypnotises a boy and places his head and feet over two chairs. He then places a large weight over hisbody. The body does not bend. He asks the audience to clasp the fingers of both hands and makes astrong current of electricity to pass. They all actually feel the shock of the current. He first starts thecurrent in his own hands and thinks strongly that the current should pass to the hands of others.Hypnotism is very beneficial in the correction of bad habits of boys and in the treatment ofhysteria and other nervous diseases. The opium habit and the drinking habit are also removed. Thehypnotist should not misuse the power in wrong channels. He will get a hopeless downfall.Wherever there is power, there is side by side a chance for misuse. There are temptations also. Onehas to be very careful.A hypnotist looks at the second-hand of a watch and the second-hand stops immediately. Heasks a subject to look at the second-hand of a watch and stops his thinking. His eyes becomeslistless. A hypnotist makes the body of a hypnotised subject to levitate and move in the air through abig iron ring. The hypnotised person is blindfolded. He is able to walk over a rope that is distributedon the ground in quite a zigzag manner. He is able to read the contents of a sealed letter and giveproper answers to questions. Here the unconscious mind of the subject operates. He can see throughan opaque wall. Marvellous are the mysteries of the science of hypnotism! Thanks to Mr. JamesBraid of happy memory!TELEPATHYTelepathy is thought-transference from one person to another. Just as sound moves in theethereal space, so also thought moves in the mental space, Chidakasa. There is an ocean of ether allround. There is also an ocean of mind all round. Thought has shape, colour, weight and form. It is asmuch matter as this pencil. When you have some good thought of an elevating nature sometimes, itis very difficult to say whether it is your own thought or the thought of some other person. Thoughtsof other persons enter your brain.Telepathy was the first wireless telegraphy of the Yogis. Yogis send their messages throughtelepathy. Thought travels with electric speed that is unimaginable. Sometimes you think of a friendwith such intensity in the evening that you get a letter from him early in the morning. This isunconscious telepathy. Your powerful thought has travelled and reached the brain of your friendimmediately and he has replied you then and there. So many interesting and wonderful things are220PSYCHIC INFLUENCE"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"going on in the thought-world. Ordinarily, people who have not developed the power of telepathyare groping in the darkness.Telepathy is communication of mind with mind. The pineal gland which is considered byoccultists as the seat of the soul plays an important part in telepathy. It is this pineal gland thatactually receives messages. It is a small piece of nervous matter that is imbedded in the brain orhind-brain in the floor of the mind ventricle. It is an endocrine gland that is ductless. It has got aninternal secretion which is directly poured into the blood.Practise telepathy in the beginning from a short distance. It is better to practise at nights, tostart with. Ask your friend to have the receptive attitude and concentration at ten oíclock. Ask himto sit on Virasana or Padmasana with closed eyes in a dark room. Try to send your message exactlyat the appointed time. Concentrate on the thoughts that you want to send. Will strongly now. Thethoughts will leave your brain and enter the brain of your friend. There may be some mistakes in thebeginning here and there. When you advance in practice and know the technique well, you willalways be correct in sending and receiving messages. Later on, you will be able to forwardmessages to different corners of the world. Thought-waves vary in intensity and force. The senderand receiver should practise great and intense concentration. Then there will be force in sending themessages, clarity and accuracy in receiving the messages. Practise in the beginning telepathy formone room to the next room in the same house. This science is very pleasant and interesting. It needspatient practice. Brahmacharya is very essential.You can influence another man without any audible language. What is wanted isconcentration of thought that is directed by the will. This is telepathy. Here is an exercise for yourpractice in telepathy. Think of your friend or cousin who is living in a distant land. Bring a clear-cutimage of his face to your mind. If you have his photo look at it and speak to it audibly. When youretire to bed think of the picture with intense concentration. He will write to you the desired letterthe following day or so. Try this yourself. Do not doubt. You will be quite surprised. You will getsuccess and firm conviction in the science of telepathy. Sometimes, when you are writingsomething or reading a newspaper, suddenly you get a message from some one near and dear toyou. You think of him suddenly. He has sent you a message. He has thought of you seriously.Thought-vibrations travel faster than light or electricity. In such instances, the subconscious mindreceives the messages or impressions and transmits the same to the conscious mind.Great adepts or Mahatmas who live in the Himalayan caves transmit their messages throughtelepathy to deserving aspirants or Yogis in the world. These Jijnasus or Yogis carry out their ordersand disseminate their knowledge far and wide. It is not necessary that Mahatmas should come onthe platform and preach. Whether they preach or not, it does not matter. Their very life is anembodiment of teaching. They are the living assurance for God-realisation. Preaching on theplatform belongs to the second-class type of men who have no knowledge of telepathy. The hiddenYogis help the world through their spiritual vibrations and magnetic aura more than the Yogis of theplatform. In these days, Congressmen expect even Sannyasins to work on the Congress platform.They even force them. As their minds are saturated with Karma Samskaras, they are not able tograsp and understand the grandeur, utility and magnanimity of pure Nivritti of Dhyana-Yogis. Thefield or domain of activity of Sannyasins is entirely different. They cannot become presidents of221MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"Sabhas or Mandalas. Their sphere is of a cosmic nature. Their field is Adhyatmic that relates to thescience of the Self. Let me repeat the words of Bhagavan Sri Krishna:ìLokesmin dvividha nishtha pura prokta mayanagha,Jnanayogena samkhyanam karmayogena yoginam.îìIn this world there is a twofold path, as I said before, O sinless one, that of Yoga byKnowledge, of the Sankhyas, and that of Yoga by action, of the Yogisî (Gita, III-3). The glory ofHinduism will be lost, if Sannyasins become extinct. They can never become extinct from India.The Samskaras of Tyaga and renunciation are ingrained in their cells, nerves and tissues. Buddhistshave got monks. Mohammedans have their Fakirs. Christians have got their priests, clergymen andreverend fathers. Every religion has people in the world with the spirit of renunciation. There mustbe a set of people in every religion who are entirely devoted to divine contemplation. It is the duty ofhouseholders to attend to their wants. They will receive their blessings. It is these people who leadthe life of Nivritti Marga, who can make researches in Yoga and give to the world new messages. Itis these men who can really help the world at large and do Loka-Kalyana.CLAIRVOYANCEClairvoyance is vision of distant objects through the inner astral eye or psychic eye. Just asyou have physical sense in the physical body, there are astral counterparts of these Indriyas in theinner, subtle, astral body. The Yogi or the occultist develops these inner organs through practice ofconcentration. He develops clairvoyant vision. He can see objects in far-off climes. This Siddhi orpower is called Dura Drishti.Just as light rays penetrate a glass, just as X-rays penetrate solid, opaque objects, so also theYogi can see the things through a solid wall, can see the contents of a sealed envelope and thecontents of a hidden treasure underneath the ground through his inner psychic eye. This psychic eyeis the eye of intuition or Divya Drishti or Jnana-Chakshus. One has to develop this inner eyethrough concentration. Just as the microscope magnifies the small cells, germs, etc., so also he cansee things of the astral world very clearly through this inner eye and can magnify them also byspecial focussing of the inner astral lens.He creates an astral tube by willing and the strong wishing and thinking and, through thisastral tube, he sees things at a distance. The vision may not be very clear in the beginning. Just as thenew-born baby learns, so also he learns in the beginning. As he advances in his practice, his innervision becomes quite distinct. There is another method. The Yogi takes astral journey and seesthings during his astral travelling unconsciously.Just as light rays travel in space, so also astral light rays travel with tremendous velocity.They are caught up by the astral eye. Every one of you has got these astral senses. But few onlyconsciously develop them. A clairvoyant can see the events of the past by looking into the Akasicrecords and have Trikala Jnana also. The degree of power varies in different individuals. Advancedclairvoyants are very rare.222PSYCHIC INFLUENCE"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"CLAIRAUDIENCEClairaudience is the hearing of distant sounds in the astral plane by means of the astral ear.The process is similar to clairvoyance. The astral sound-vibrations are caught hold of by the astralsense of hearing. A clairvoyant need not necessarily be a clairaudient. These are two distinctpowers.Patanjali Maharshi gives the method to develop this power of distant hearing.ìShrotrakasayohî(Patanjali Yoga Sutras, 3-41). By Samyama on the relation between the ear andAkasa, comes divine hearing. Samyama is concentration and meditation combined.All the inhabitants of the Pitriloka possess this power. Where their descendants performSraaddha and Tarpana in this world, they hear these sounds through the power of clairaudience andthey are highly pleased.These psychic Siddhis are all by-products of concentration. Just as there are various coal-tarderivatives and various petroleum preparations, so also there are these Siddhis manifest in a Yogiwhen he concentrates. These are all obstacles in the path of spirituality. The aspirant should ignorethem and develop Vairagya. Then only will he be able to reach the goal.All the sound vibrations of the past are in the Akasic records. The Yogi can hear thesesounds nicely. He can hear the sounds of Shakespeare, Johnson, Valmiki, Visvamitra, etc. Just asyou can hear now the music and song of a songster who died fifty years ago in the gramophonicrecords, so also the Yogi can hear the sounds of those persons of the past by concentrationconnecting his astral hearing to the Akasic records. Just as impressions of your boyhood remain inyour brain and the subconscious mind, so also the impressions of old sounds remain in the Akasicrecords. One should know the Yogisí technique only. Just as the experienced record-keeper in theoffice can bring out in a short time any old record, so also the Yogi can hear the sound of good olddays in the twinkling of an eye.APPENDIX IIIANNIHILATION OF MINDMind is Atma-Sakti. Mind is a bundle of Vasanas (desires) and Sankalpas (thoughts,imaginations). Mind is a bundle of Raga-Dvesha (likes and dislikes). Annihilation of mind isManonasa.Manolaya is temporary absorption of the mind. This cannot give Moksha. The mind cancome back again and wander in sensual objects. Manonasa alone can give release or Moksha.223MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"VICHARAHow is the mind purified, brought under control and how are its activities stopped and howis it annihilated? Here are some useful and practical points. Mind can be controlled and annihilatedby Vichara or enquiry of ìWho am I?î This is the best and most effective method. This willannihilate the mind. This is the Vedantic method. Realise the unreality of the mind throughphilosophical thinking.SLAY THE EGOEradicate the feeling of egoism. Ego is the seed of the tree of mind. ìIî thought is the sourceof all thoughts. All thoughts are centred on the little ìI.î Find out what the little ìIî is. This little ìIîwill dwindle into an airy nothing. It will be absorbed in the infinite ìIî or Parabrahman, the sourcefor the little ìIî or Ahankara (egoism).The Sun of Self-realisation is fully seen when the cloud of ego disappears.VAIRAGYAVairagya (dispassion) is another method for annihilating mind. It is distaste for objects ofsense-pleasures by finding out the defects in the sensual life. Objects are perishable. Sensualpleasure is momentary and illusory.ABHYASAAbhyasa or practice is another method. Concentrate the mind by fixing it on Brahman.Make it steady. Abhyasa is ceaseless meditation. This leads to Samadhi.NON-ATTACHMENTAsanga or non-attachment is a sword to destroy the mind. Take the mind away from objects.Detach. Attach. Detach it from the objects. And attach it to the Lord. Do this again and again. Theessence of the seed of the sprout of world experience, which is desire, can be destroyed by the fire ofnon-attachment.VASANA-KSHAYAVasana-Kshaya is another method. Vasana is desire. Renunciation of desires leads toVasana-Kshaya. This will lead to annihilation of mind (Manonasa). Desire for objects of pleasure isbondage; giving it up is emancipation. Desire is the most essential nature of the mind. Mind andegoism are synonymous.224ANNIHILATION OF MIND"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"PRANAYAMAVibration of Prana causes movement of the mind. It gives life to the mind. Pranayama orcontrol of Prana will stop the activities of the mind. But it cannot destroy the mind to its roots likeVichara.CONTROL THE THOUGHTSControl the thoughts or Sankalpas. Avoid imagination or day-dreaming. The mind will beannihilated. Extinction of Sankalpas alone is Moksha or release. The mind is destroyed when thereis no imagination. The experience of the world illusion is due to your imagination. It vanishes awaywhen imagination is completely stopped.RENUNCIATIONMental renunciation of possessions is another method. The absolute experience can also berealised if you learn to be in a state of thought-suspending Samadhi.BE BALANCEDAttainment of equanimity is another method. Be balanced in pain and pleasure, heat andcold, etc.He alone experiences everlasting peace and eternal bliss who has transcended the mind andrests in his own Satchidananda Atman.DEVOTION AND SERVICEJapa, Kirtan, prayer, devotion, service of Guru and study are also means to annihilate themind.225MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"GLOSSARYNOTE:This includes only those Sanskrit terms for which the English equivalents are notindicated simultaneously (or almost simultaneously) with their first occurrence in the text.AABHASA: reflectionABHEDA: without differenceABHIMANA: ego-centred attachmentABHYASA: spiritual practiceACHARYA: preceptorADAMBHITVA: unpretentiousnessADHAMA-UDDHARAKA: uplifter of the downtroddenADHIBHAUTIC: elementalADHIDAIVIC: celestialADHYATMIC: spiritualADVAITA: non-dualityADVAITA-NISHTHA: establishment in the state of non-dualityAGNI: fireAGNI-ASTRA: fire-missileAGNIHOTRA: a fire-offeringAHAM: ìIî or the egoAHAM BRAHMA ASMI: I am BrahmanAHANGRAHA UPASANA: meditation in which the aspirant identifies himself with BrahmanAHANKARA: egoismAHIMSA: non-violenceAISVARYA: divine powersAJNA CHAKRA: centre of spiritual energy between the two eyebrowsAJNANA: ignoranceAKHANDA EKARASA: the one undivided EssenceAKARTA: non-doerAKASA: etherAKASAMATRA: ether onlyAKHANDA: indivisibleAKHANDAKARA: of the nature of indivisibilityAMALAKA:phyllanthus emlica,Indian gooseberryAMRITA: nectarAMRITA PUTRA: nectarís sonAMSA: partANADI: beginninglessANAHATA: mystic sounds heard by YoginsANANDAGHANA: mass of blissANANDAMAYA: full of blissANANTA: infiniteANANYA BHAKTI: exclusive devotion to the Lord226GLOSSARY"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"ANASAKTA: unattchedANATMA: not-SelfANITYA: transitoryANNAMAYA KOSHA: food sheath, the gross physical bodyANTARGATA: immanentANTARIKA: internalANTAR-INDRIYA: internal sense-organANTARJYOTIS: inner LightANTARMUKHA VRITTI: introspective thought-currentANTARVAHA SARIRA: the subtle body of a Yogi by which he accomplishes entry into thebodies of othersANUBHAVA: spiritual realisationANUBHAVA-GURU: preceptor who has had pesonal spiritual realisationANUSANDHANA: enquiry into the nature of BrahmanANVAYA: the positive aspectAPANA: the down-going breathAPANCHIKRITA: non-quintuplicatedAPAS: waterAPAVADA-YUKTI: employment of the logical method of negationASABDA: soundlessASAMPRAJNATA SAMADHI: superconscious state where the mind is totally annihilatedASANA: bodily poseASANGA: unattachedASHRAMA: hermitageASHTA: eightASHTAVADHANA: doing eight things at a timeASTI-BHATI-PRIYA: same as Satchidananda, the eternal qualities inherent in BrahmanASTRA: a missile invoked with a MantraASUBHA: inauspiciousASUDDHA: impureASUDDHA MANAS: impure mindASVANI MUDRA: a Hatha Yogic KriyaATMA(N): the SelfATMA-DRISHTI: the vision of seeing everything as the SelfATMA-JNANA: Knowledge of the SelfATMAKARA: pertaining to AtmanATMA-SAKSHATKARA: Self-realisationATMA-SAKTI: Soul-powerAVASTHA: stateAVICHHINNA: continuousAVIDYA: nescienceAVINASI: imperishableAVYAKTA: unmanifest227MINDóITS MYSTERIES AND CONTROL"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"BBAHIRMUKHA VRITTI: the outgoing thought-currentBAHIR-VRITTI: same as aboveBAHIR-VRITTI-NIGRAHA: restraint of the outgoing thought-currentBAHYA-VRITTI-NIGRAHA: same as aboveBHAJANA: devotional singingBHAKTA: devoteeBHAKTI YOGA: the Yoga of devotionBHASTRIKA PRANAYAMA: a type of breathing exerciseBHAVA(NA): attitudinal feelingBHAVA-SAMADHI: supeconscious state attained by devotees through intense divine emotionBHEDA BUDDHI: the intellect which dividesBHOGA: enjoymentBHOKTRITVA: the stage of being an enjoyerBHRANTIMATRA: mere illusionBHUTAJAYA: control over the elementsBHUTA-SAKTI: the power of the elementBRAHMACHARI(N): celibateBRAHMACHARYA: celibacyBRAHMAKARA VRITTI: thought of BrahmanBRAHMA LOKA: the world of Brahma, the four-headed CreatorBRAHMAN: the Absolute RealityBRAHMANA: member belonging to the priestly casteBRAHMA NADI: same as SushumnaBRAHMA-NISHTHA: one who is established in the Knowledge of BrahmanBRAHMANUBHAVA: Self-realisationBRAHMIN: Same as BrahmanaBUDDHI: intellectCCHAITANYA: pure consciousnessCHAKRA: centre of spiritual energyCHANCHALA: waveringCHANCHALATA: tossing of the mindCHARANAMRITA: water sanctified by the feet of a Deity or of a holy manCHATAK: a birdCHELA (Hindi): DiscipleCHIDGHANA: mass of consciousnessCHINMAYA: full of consciousnessCHINTANA: thinkingCHIRANJIVI: one who has gained eternal lifeCHIT-MATRA: consciousness aloneCHIT-SVARUPA: of the very form of consciousness228GLOSSARY"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"CHITTA: subconscious mindCHITTA-SUDDHI: purity of mindDDAMA: restraint of the sense-organsDAMBHA: hypocrisyDANA: charityDARPA: vanityDARSANA: visionDEHADHYASA: attachment to the body, identification with the bodyDEHATMA-BUDDHI: the intellect that makes one identify with the bodyDEVA: a celestial beingDEVATA: a Deity, also the LordDHAIRYA: courageDHARANA: concentrationDHARMA: righteous conduct;
