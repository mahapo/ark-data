From his lovely Ashram at Rishikesh he radiatedspiritual knowledge and a peace born of spiritual perfection. His personality has made itselfmanifest nowhere else as completely as in his edifying and elevating books. And this little volumeon Kundalini Yoga is perhaps the most vital of all his books, for obvious reasons.Kundalini is the coiled up, dormant, cosmic power that underlies all organic and inorganicmatter within us and any thesis that deals with it can avoid becoming too abstract, only with greatdifficulty. But within the following pages, the theory that underlies this cosmic power has beenanalysed to its thinnest filaments, and practical methods have been suggested to awaken this greatpristine force in individuals. It explains the theory and illustrates the practice of Kundalini Yoga.We feel certain, that to the spiritual aspirant, this book will serve as a kindly light that leadshim on through the dark alleys of an as yet unexplored branch of Yogic exercises, while to thelayman it contains a wealth of new information which is bound to be a valuable addition to hisknowledge of Yogic culture.—THE DIVINE LIFE SOCIETYGURU STOTRAsT:av:rˆ j:§m:ˆ vy:apt:ˆ y:etkeWc:t:Œ s:c:rac:rm:Œ .t:tp:dˆ deS: ̧t:ˆ y:n: t:sm:Ú ¬:ig:ÿrv: n:m:H ..sth‡vara ̧ jaÔgama ̧ vy‡pta ̧ yatki§cit sacar‡caram |tatpada ̧ dar ̃ita ̧ yena tasmai ̃r„gurave nama ̨ ||“Salutations to the Guru who has made it possible to realise Him by whom all this world,animate and inanimate, movable and immovable, is pervaded.”A:ˆkarˆ eb:ndŸs:ˆy:ÿVt:ˆ en:ty:ˆ Dy:ay:ent: y: n:raH .kam:dˆ m::x:dˆ c:Úv: A:ˆkaray: n:m:: n:m:H ..o ̧k‡ra ̧ bindusa ̧yukta ̧ nitya ̧ dhy‡yanti ye nar‡ ̨ |k‡mada ̧ mok ̆ada ̧ caiva o ̧k‡r‡ya namo nama ̨ ||“Salutations to Omkara, which gives whatever one desires and also liberation to those whomeditate always on Omkara that is united with the Bindu.”iii"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"wan:S:eVt:-s:m:a-Z-t:∂v:m:al:a-ev:B:‹e\\:N: .B:ÿeVt:-m:ÿeVt:)da*: c: t:sm:Ú ¬:ig:ÿrv: n:m:H ..j§‡na ̃akti-sam‡rÂÛha-tattvam‡l‡-vibhÂ ̆iıe |bhukti-muktiprad‡tre ca tasmai ̃r„gurave nama ̨ ||“Salutations to the Guru who is established in Knowledge and Power, who is adorned withthe garland of Knowledge and who grants both worldly prosperity and liberation.”DEVI STOTRAKdmb:v:n:m:Dy:g:aˆkn:km:NRl::p:esT:t:a ̇\\:Rˆb:ÿ,hv:aes:n:iˆs:t:t:es:πs::Údaem:n:im:Œ .ev:Rˆeb:t:j:p:a,ec:ˆev:kc:c:nd”c:‹Ram:eN:ˆe*:l::c:n:kŸXŸˆeb:n:iˆe*:p:ÿrs:ÿndrim:a¬:y: ..kadambavanamadhyag‡ ̧ kanakamaıÛalopasthit‡.N ̆aÛa ̧buruhav‡sin„ ̧satatasiddhasaud‡min„m |viÛa ̧bitajap‡ruci ̧vikacacandracÂÛ‡maıi ̧trilocanakuÒu ̧bin„ ̧tripurasundar„m‡ ̃raye ||“I seek refuge in Tripurasundari, the wife of the three-eyed One, who lives in the Kadambaforest, who is seated on the golden disc and dwells in the six lotuses of the Yogins, ever flashing likelightning in the heart of the perfected ones, whose beauty excels that of the Japa flower and whoseforehead is adorned by the full-moon.”y:*: ekeWc:t:Œ Vv:ec:æst:ÿ s:ds:æaeK:l:aetm:kÒ .t:sy: s:v: ̧sy: y:a S:eVt:H s:a tv:ˆ ekˆ st:‹y:t: s:da ..yatra ki§cit kvacidvastu sadasadv‡khil‡tmike |tasya sarvasya y‡ ̃akti ̨ s‡ tva ̧ ki ̧ stÂyate sad‡ ||“O Thou Self of everything, of whatever thing existing at whatever place or time, whethercause or effect, Thou art the Power behind that; how canst Thou be praised?”iv"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"m:haev:Ωa m:ham:ay:a m:ham:D:a m:hasm:‡et:H .m:ham::ha c: B:v:t:i m:hadv:i m:has:ÿri ..mah‡vidy‡ mah‡m‡y‡ mah‡medh‡ mah‡smÁti ̨ |mah‡moh‡ ca bhavat„ mah‡dev„ mah‡sur„ ||“Thou art the Supreme Knowledge, Maya, intellect, memory, delusion and the greatProwess of the gods as well as of the demons.”SIVA STOTRAkrc:rN:k·t:ˆ v:aVkay:j:ˆ km: ̧j:ˆ v:a¬:v:N:n:y:n:j:ˆ v:a m:an:s:ˆ c:ap:raD:m:Œ .ev:eht:m:ev:eht:ˆ v:a s:v: ̧m:t:t:Œ x:m:sv:j:y: j:y: k,N:abD: ¬:im:hadv: S:mB:: ..karacaraıakÁta ̧ v‡kk‡yaja ̧ karmaja ̧ v‡ ̃ravaıanayanaja ̧ v‡ m‡nasa ̧ c‡par‡dham |vihitamavihita ̧ v‡ sarvametat k ̆amasvajaya jaya karuı‡bdhe ̃r„mah‡deva ̃ambho ||“Sins committed in action—with the hands and feet or by speech, or by the body, or by theears and eyes,—or by those done in thoughts,—forgive all these sins whether of commission oromission.

The highestmanifestation of sound-energy, the primal voice, the divine voice is Para. The Para voice becomesv"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"the root-ideas or germ-thoughts. It is the first manifestation of voice. In Para the sound remains inan undifferentiated form. Para, Pasyanti, Madhyama and Vaikhari are the various gradations ofsound. Madhyama is the intermediate unexpressed state of sound. Its seat is the heart.The seat of Pasyanti is the navel or the Manipura Chakra. Yogins who have subtle innervision can experience the Pasyanti state of a word which has colour and form, which is common forall languages and which has the vibrating homogeneity of sound. Indians, Europeans, Americans,Africans, Japanese, birds, beasts—all experience the same Bhavana of a thing in the Pasyanti stateof voice or sound. Gesture is a sort of mute subtle language. It is one and the same for all persons.Any individual of any country will make the same gesture by holding his hand to his mouth in aparticular manner, when he is thirsty. As one and the same power or Shakti working through theears becomes hearing, through the eyes becomes seeing and so forth, the same Pasyanti assumesdifferent forms of sound when materialised. The Lord manifests Himself through his Mayaic powerfirst as Para Vani in the Muladhara Chakra at the navel, then as Madhyama in the heart and theneventually as Vaikhari in the throat and mouth. This is the divine descent of His voice. All theVaikhari is His voice only. It is the voice of the Virat Purusha.PREFACEO Divine Mother Kundalini, the Divine Cosmic Energy that is hidden in men! Thou artKali, Durga, Adisakti, Rajarajeswari, Tripurasundari, Maha-Lakshmi, Maha-Sarasvati! Thou hastput on all these names and forms. Thou hast manifested as Prana, electricity, force, magnetism,cohesion, gravitation in this universe. This whole universe rests in Thy bosom. Crores of salutationsunto thee. O Mother of this world! Lead me on to open the Sushumna Nadi and take Thee along theChakras to Sahasrara Chakra and to merge myself in Thee and Thy consort, Lord Siva.Kundalini Yoga is that Yoga which treats of Kundalini Sakti, the six centres of spiritualenergy (Shat Chakras), the arousing of the sleeping Kundalini Sakti and its union with Lord Siva inSahasrara Chakra, at the crown of the head. This is an exact science. This is also known as LayaYoga. The six centres are pierced (Chakra Bheda) by the passing of Kundalini Sakti to the top of thehead. ‘Kundala’ means ‘coiled’. Her form is like a coiled serpent. Hence the name Kundalini.All agree that the one aim which man has in all his acts is to secure happiness for himself.The highest as well as the ultimate end of man must, therefore, be to attain eternal, infinite,unbroken, supreme happiness. This happiness can be had in one’s own Self or Atman only.Therefore, search within to attain this eternal Bliss.The thinking faculty is present only in human being. Man only can reason, reflect andexercise judgment. It is man only who can compare and contrast, who can think ofprosandconsand who can draw inferences and conclusions. This is the reason why he alone is able to attainGod-consciousness. That man who simply eats and drinks and who does not exercise his mentalfaculty in Self-realisation is only a brute.vi"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"O worldly-minded persons! Wake up from the sleep of Ajnana. Open your eyes. Stand up toacquire knowledge of Atman. Do spiritual Sadhana, awaken the Kundalini Sakti and get that‘sleepless-sleep’ (Samadhi). Drown yourself in Atman.Chitta is the mental substance. It takes various forms. These forms constitute Vrittis. It getstransformed (Parinama). These transformations or modifications are the thought-waves,whirlpools or Vrittis. If the Chitta thinks of a mango, the Vritti of a mango is formed in the lake ofChitta. This will subside and another Vritti will be formed when it thinks of milk. Countless Vrittisare rising and subsiding in the ocean of Chitta. These Vrittis cause restlessness of mind. Why doVrittis arise from the Chitta? Because of Samskaras and Vasanas. If you annihilate all Vasanas, allVrittis will subside by themselves.When a Vritti subsides it leaves a definite impression in the subconscious mind. It is knownas Samskara or latent impression. The sum total of all Samskaras is known as “Karmasaya” orreceptacle of works. This is called Sanchita Karma (accumulated works). When a man leaves thephysical body, he carries with him his astral body of 17 Tattvas and the Karmasaya as well, to themental plane. This Karmasaya is burnt by highest knowledge obtained through AsamprajnataSamadhi.During concentration you will have to collect carefully the dissipated rays of the mind.Vrittis will be ever-rising from the ocean of Chitta. You will have to put down the waves as theyarise. If all the waves subside, the mind becomes calm and serene. Then the Yogi enjoys peace andbliss. Therefore real happiness is within. You will have to get it through control of mind and notthrough money, women, children, name, fame, rank or power.Purity of mind leads to perfection in Yoga. Regulate your conduct when you deal withothers. Have no feeling of jealousy towards others. Be compassionate. Do not hate sinners. Be kindto all. Develop complacency towards superiors. Success in Yoga will be rapid if you put in yourmaximum energy in your Yogic practice. You must have a keen longing for liberation and intenseVairagya also. You must be sincere and earnest. Intent and constant meditation is necessary forentering into Samadhi.He who has firm faith in Srutis and Shastras, who has Sadachara (right conduct), whoconstantly engages himself in the service of his Guru and who is free from lust, anger, Moha, greedand vanity easily crosses this ocean of Samsara and attains Samadhi quickly. Just as fire burns aheap of dried leaves, so also the fire of Yoga burns all Karmas. The Yogi attains Kaivalya. ThroughSamadhi, the Yogi gets intuition. Real knowledge flashes in him within a second.Neti, Dhauti, Basti, Nauli, Asanas, Mudras, etc., keep the body healthy and strong, andunder perfect control. But they are not the be-all and end-all of Yoga. These Kriyas will help you inyour practice of Dhyana. Dhyana will culminate in Samadhi, Self-realisation. He who practisesHatha Yogic Kriyas is not a Purna Yogi. He who has entered into Asamprajnata Samadhi only is aPurna Yogi. He is a Svatantra Yogi (absolutely independent).Samadhi is of two kinds, viz., Jada Samadhi and Chaitanya Samadhi. A Hatha Yogi throughthe practice of Khechari Mudra can shut himself up in a box and remain underneath the ground forvii"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"months and years. There is no higher supernatural knowledge in this kind of Samadhi. This is JadaSamadhi. In Chaitanya Samadhi, there is perfect ‘awareness’. The Yogi comes down with new,super-sensuous wisdom.When a man practises Yogic Kriyas, naturally various kinds of Siddhis are acquired. TheSiddhis are hindrances to Realisation. The Yogi should not at all care for these Siddhis, if he wantsto advance further and get the highest realisation, the final Goal. He who runs after Siddhis willbecome the biggest house-holder and a worldly-minded man. Self-realisation only is the Goal. Thesum total of knowledge of this universe is nothing when compared to the spiritual knowledge that isobtained through Self-realisation.Ascend the path of Yoga cautiously. Remove the weeds, thorns and the sharp angularpebbles on the way. Name and fame are the angular pebbles. Subtle under-current of lust is theweed. Attachment to family, children, money, disciples, Chelas or Ashram is the thorn. These areforms of Maya. They do not allow the aspirants to march further. They serve as thestumbling-blocks. The aspirant gets false Tushti, stops his Sadhana, imagines foolishly that he hasrealised, and tries to elevate others. This is like a blind man leading the blind. When the Yogicstudent starts an Ashram, slowly luxury creeps in. The original Vairagya gradually wanes. He loseswhat he has gained and is unconscious of his downfall. Ashram develops begging mentality andinstitutional egoism. He is the same house-holder now in some other form (Rupantara-bheda)though he is in the garb of a Sannyasin. O aspirants, beware! I warn you seriously. Never buildAshrams. Remember the watchwords:-“SECLUSION, MEDITATION, DEVOTION.” Marchdirect to the goal. Never give up the Sadhana zeal and Vairagya until you realise Bhuma, the highestgoal. Do not entangle yourself in the wheel of name, fame and Siddhis.Nirvikalpa is the state of superconsciousness. There are no Vikalpas of any sort in thiscondition. This is the Goal of life. All the mental activities cease now. The functions of the intellectand ten Indriyas cease entirely. The aspirant rests now in Atman. There is no distinction betweensubject and object. The world and the pairs of opposites vanish completely. This is a state beyondall relativity. The aspirant gets knowledge of Self, supreme peace and infinite, indescribable bliss.This is also called Yogaroodha state.When Kundalini is taken to the Sahasrara and when it is united with Lord Siva, perfectSamadhi ensues. The Yogic student drinks the Nectar of Immortality. He has reached the Goal.Mother Kundalini has done Her task now. Glory to Mother Kundalini! May Her blessings be uponyou all!Om Shantih! Shantih! Shantih!viii"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"!.. j:ag:: m:a kŸl: kŸNRel:n:i ..j:ag:: m:a kŸl:kŸNRel:n:i j:ag:: m:a .t:ÿem: en:ty:an:nd-sv:-ep:N:i ..t:ÿem: b:“...an:nd-sv:-ep:N:i ..)s:ÿpt: B:ÿj:g:akara A:D:ar p:ºv:aes:n:i ..e*:k:n: j:l: k·S:an:‹,t:aep:t: hEl:: t:n:ÿm:‹l:aD:ar ty:j: eS:v: sv:y:ˆB:‹-eS:v:-v:e≈n:i ..g:cC s:ÿ\\:‹mn:ar p:T:,sv:aeD:≈an: hv:: uedt:,m:eN:p:‹r An:aht: ev:S:ÿπawa s:Wc:aerN:i ..eS:res: s:h+dl:,p:rm: eS:v:t: em:l:#iRa kr: kŸt:‹hl: s:ecc:dan:nddaey:n:i ..j:ag:: m:a kŸl: kŸNRel:n:i j:ag:: m:a .ix"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"OM|| j‡go m‡ kula kuıÛalin„ ||j‡go m‡ kulakuıÛalin„ j‡go m‡ |tumi nity‡nanda-svarÂpiı„ ||tumi brahm‡nanda-svarÂpiı„ ||prasupta bhujag‡k‡r‡ ‡dh‡ra padmav‡sin„ ||trikone jale kÁ ̃‡nÂ, t‡pita hailo tanumÂl‡dh‡ra tyaja ̃ive svaya ̧bhÂ- ̃iva-ve ̆Òhin„ ||gaccha su ̆Âmn‡ra patha, sv‡dhi ̆Òh‡ne havo udita,maıipÂra an‡hata vi ̃uddh‡j§‡ sa§c‡riı„ || ̃irasi sahasradale, parama ̃ivete milekr„Û‡ karo kutÂhale saccid‡nandad‡yin„ ||j‡go m‡ kula kuıÛalin„ j‡go m‡ |PRAYER TO MOTHER KUNDALINIWake up Mother Kundalini.Thou whose nature is Bliss Eternal—The Bliss of Brahman.Thou dwelling like a serpent asleep at the lotus of Muladhara,Sore, affected and distressed am I in body and mind,Do thou bless me and leave thy place at the basic lotus.Consort of Siva the Self-caused Lord of Universe,Do thou take thy upward course through the central canal.Leaving behind Svadhishthana, Manipuraka, Anahata, Vishuddha, and Ajna.Be thou united with Siva, thy Lord the God.At Sahasrara—the thousand-petalled-lotus in the brain.Sport there freely, O Mother, Giver of Bliss Supreme.Mother, who is Existence, Knowledge, Bliss Absolute.Wake up, Mother Kundalini!

You receive instructions from God. These indicate that theKundalini Shakti has been awakened. When there is throbbing in Muladhara, when hairs stand ontheir roots, when Uddiyana, Jalandhara and Mulabandha come involuntarily, know that Kundalinihas awakened.When the breath stops without any effort, when Kevala Kumbhaka comes by itself withoutany exertion, know that Kundalini Shakti has become active. When you feel currents of Prana risingup to the Sahasrara, when you experience bliss, when you repeat Om automatically, when there areno thoughts of the world in the mind, know that Kundalini Shakti has awakened.When, in your meditation, the eyes become fixed on Trikuti, the middle of the eyebrows,when the Shambhavi Mudra operates, know that Kundalini has become active. When you feelvibrations of Prana in different parts inside your body, when you experience jerks like the shocks ofelectricity, know that Kundalini has become active. During meditation when you feel as if there isno body, when your eyelids become closed and do not open in spite of your exertion, whenelectric-like currents flow up and down the nerves, know that Kundalini has awakened.When you meditate, when you get inspiration and insight, when the nature unfolds itssecrets to you, all doubts disappear, you understand clearly the meaning of the Vedic texts, knowthat Kundalini has become active. When your body becomes light like air, when you have abalanced mind in perturbed condition, when you possess inexhaustible energy for work, know thatKundalini has become active.When you get divine intoxication, when you develop power of oration, know that Kundalinihas awakened. When you involuntarily perform different Asanas or poses of Yoga without the leastpain or fatigue, know that Kundalini has become active. When you compose beautiful sublimehymns and poetry involuntarily, know that Kundalini has become active.THE GRADATIONAL ASCENT OF THE MINDThe Chakras are centres of Shakti as vital force. In other words, these are centres ofPranashakti manifested by Pranavayu in the living body, the presiding Devatas of which are thenames for the Universal Consciousness as It manifests in the form of these centres. The Chakras arenot perceptible to the gross senses. Even if they were perceptible in the living body which they helpto organise, they disappear with the disintegration of organism at death.Purity of mind leads to perfection in Yoga. Regulate your conduct when you deal withothers. Have no feeling of jealousy towards others. Be compassionate. Do not hate sinners. Be kindto all. Success in Yoga will be rapid if you put your maximum energy in your Yogic practice. Youmust have a keen longing for liberation and intense Vairagya also. You must be sincere and earnest.Intense and constant meditation is necessary for entering into Samadhi.xi"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"The mind of a worldly man with base desires and passions moves in the Muladhara andSvadhishthana Chakras or centres situated near the anus and the reproductive organ respectively.If one’s mind becomes purified the mind rises to the Manipura Chakra or the centre in thenavel and experiences some power and joy.If the mind becomes more purified, it rises to the Anahata Chakra or centre in the heart,experiences bliss and visualises the effulgent form of the Ishta Devata or the tutelary deity.When the mind gets highly purified, when meditation and devotion become intense andprofound the mind rises to Visuddha Chakra or the centre in the throat, and experiences more andmore powers and bliss. Even when the mind has reached this centre, there is a possibility for it tocome down to the lower centres.When the Yogi reaches the Ajna Chakra or the centre between the two eyebrows he attainsSamadhi and realises the Supreme Self, or Brahman. There is a slight sense of separateness betweenthe devotee and Brahman.If he reaches the spiritual centre in the brain, the Sahasrara Chakra, the thousand-petalledlotus, the Yogi attains Nirvikalpa Samadhi or superconscious state. He becomes one with thenon-dual Brahman. All sense of separateness dissolves. This is the highest plane of consciousnessor supreme Asamprajnata Samadhi. Kundalini unites with Siva.The Yogi may come down to the centre in the throat to give instructions to the students anddo good to others (Lokasamgraha).PRANAYAMA FOR AWAKENING KUNDALINIWhen you practise the following, concentrate on the Muladhara Chakra at the base of thespinal column, which is triangular in form and which is the seat of the Kundalini Shakti. Close theright nostril with your right thumb. Inhale through the left nostril till you count 3 Oms slowly.Imagine that you are drawing the Prana with the atmospheric air. Then close the left nostril withyour little and ring fingers of the right hand. Then retain the breath for 12 Oms. Send the currentdown the spinal column straight into the triangular lotus, the Muladhara Chakra. Imagine that thenerve-current is striking against the lotus and awakening the Kundalini. Then slowly exhalethrough the right nostril counting 6 Oms. Repeat the process from the right nostril as stated above,using the same units, and having the same imagination and feeling. This Pranayama will awakenthe Kundalini quickly. Do it 3 times in the morning and 3 times in the evening. Increase the numberand time gradually and cautiously according to your strength and capacity. In this Pranayama,concentration on the Muladhara Chakra is the important thing. Kundalini will be awakened quicklyif the degree of concentration is intense and if the Pranayama is practised regularly.xii"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"KUNDALINI PRANAYAMAIn this Pranayama, the Bhavana is more important than the ratio between Puraka,Kumbhaka and Rechaka.Sit in Padma or Siddha Asana, facing the East or the North.After mentally prostrating to the lotus-feet of the Sat-guru and reciting Stotras in praise ofGod and Guru, commence doing this Pranayama which will easily lead to the awakening of theKundalini.Inhale deeply, without making any sound.As you inhale, feel that the Kundalini lying dormant in the Muladhara Chakra is awakenedand is going up from Chakra to Chakra. At the conclusion of the Puraka, have the Bhavana that theKundalini has reached the Sahasrara.

When the aspirantseriously practises all the disciplines as enjoined in the Shastras, and as instructed by the preceptor,in whom the Kundalini would have already been awakened and reached its abode or Sadasiva,acquiring which blessed achievement alone a person becomes entitled to act as a Guru or spiritualpreceptor, guiding and helping others also to achieve the same end, the veils or layers enmeshingKundalini begin to be cleared and finally are torn asunder and the serpent-power is pushed ordriven, as it were upwards.Supersensual visions appear before the mental eye of the aspirant, new worlds withindescribable wonders and charms unfold themselves before the Yogi, planes after planes revealtheir existence and grandeur to the practitioner and the Yogi gets divine knowledge, power andbliss, in increasing degrees, when Kundalini passes through Chakra after Chakra, making them tobloom in all their glory which before the touch of Kundalini, do not give out their powers,emanating their divine light and fragrance and reveal the divine secrets and phenomena, which lieconcealed from the eyes of worldly-minded people who would refuse to believe of their existenceeven.When the Kundalini ascends one Chakra or Yogic centre, the Yogi also ascends one step orrung upward in the Yogic ladder; one more page, the next page, he reads in the divine book; themore the Kundalini travels upwards, the Yogi also advances towards the goal or spiritual perfectionin relation to it. When the Kundalini reaches the sixth centre or the Ajna Chakra, the Yogi gets thevision of Personal God or Saguna Brahman, and when the serpent-power reaches the last, the topcentre, or Sahasrara Chakra, or the Thousand-petalled lotus, the Yogi loses his individuality in theocean of Sat-Chit-Ananda or the Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute and becomes one with theLord or Supreme Soul. He is no longer an ordinary man, not even a simple Yogi, but a fullyillumined sage, having conquered the eternal and unlimited divine kingdom, a hero having won thebattle against illusion, a Mukta or liberated one having crossed the ocean of ignorance or thetransmigratory existence, and a superman having the authority and capacity to save the otherstruggling souls of the relative world. Scriptures hail him most, in the maximum possible glorifyingway, and his achievement. Celestial beings envy him, not excluding the Trinity even, viz., Brahma,Vishnu and Siva.KUNDALINI AND TANTRIK SADHANAKundalini Yoga actually belongs to Tantrik Sadhana, which gives a detailed descriptionabout this serpent-power and the Chakras, as mentioned above. Mother Divine, the active aspect ofthe Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute, resides in the body of men and women in the form ofxiv"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Kundalini, and the entire Tantrik Sadhana aims at awakening Her, and making Her to unite with theLord, Sadasiva, in the Sahasrara, as described in the beginning in detail. Methods adopted toachieve this end in Tantrik Sadhana are Japa of the name of the Mother, prayer and various rituals.KUNDALINI AND HATHA YOGAHatha Yoga also builds up its philosophy around this Kundalini and the methods adopted init are different from Tantrik Sadhana. Hatha Yoga seeks to awaken this Kundalini through thediscipline of the physical body, purification of Nadis and controlling the Prana. Through a numberof physical poses called Yoga Asanas it tones up the entire nervous system, and brings it under theconscious control of the Yogi, through Bandhas and Mudras it controls the Prana, regulates itsmovements and even blocks and seals it without allowing it to move, through Kriyas it purifies theinner organs of physical body and, finally, through Pranayama it brings the mind itself under thecontrol of the Yogi. Kundalini is made to go upwards towards Sahasrara through these combinedmethods.KUNDALINI AND RAJA YOGABut Raja Yoga mentions nothing about this Kundalini, but propounds a still subtle, higherpath, philosophical and rational, and asks the aspirant to control the mind, to withdraw all the sensesand to plunge in meditation. Unlike Hatha Yoga which is mechanical and mystical, Raja Yogateaches a technique with eight limbs, appealing to the heart and intellect of aspirants. It advocatesmoral and ethical development through its Yama and Niyama, helps the intellectual and culturaldevelopment through Svadhyaya or study of holy Scriptures, satisfies the emotional and devotionalaspect of human nature by enjoining to surrender oneself to the will of the Creator, has an elementof mysticism by including Pranayama also as one of the eight limbs and finally, prepares theaspirant for unbroken meditation on the Absolute through a penultimate step of concentration.Neither in philosophy nor in its prescription of methods of Raja Yoga mentions about Kundalini,but sets the human mind and Chitta as its targets to be destroyed as they alone make the individualsoul to forget its real nature and brings on it birth and death and all the woes of phenomenalexistence.KUNDALINI AND VEDANTABut when we come to Vedanta, there is no question about Kundalini or any type of mysticaland mechanical methods. It is all enquiry and philosophical speculation. According to Vedanta theonly thing to be destroyed is ignorance about one’s real nature, and this ignorance cannot bedestroyed either by study, or by Pranayama, or by work, or by any amount of physical twisting andtorturing, but only by knowing one’s real nature, which is Sat-Chit-Ananda orExistence-Knowledge-Bliss. Man is divine, free and one with the Supreme Spirit always, which heforgets and identifies himself with matter, which itself is an illusory appearance and asuperimposition on the spirit. Liberation is freedom from ignorance and the aspirant is advised toconstantly dissociate himself from all limitations and identify himself with the all-pervading,non-dual, blissful, peaceful, homogeneous spirit or Brahman. When meditation becomesintensified, in the ocean of Existence or rather the individuality is blotted or blown out completely.Just as a drop of water let on a frying pan is immediately sucked and vanishes from cognition, thexv"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"individual consciousness is sucked in by the Universal Consciousness and is absorbed in it.According to Vedanta there cannot be real liberation in a state of multiplicity, and the state ofcomplete Oneness is the goal to be aspired for, towards which alone the entire creation is slowlymoving on.INTRODUCTIONESSENCE OF KUNDALINI YOGAThe word YOGA comes from the root Yuj which means to join, and in its spiritual sense, itis that process by which the human spirit is brought into near and conscious communion with, or ismerged in, the Divine Spirit, according as the nature of the human spirit is held to be separate from(Dvaita, Visishtadvaita) or one with (Advaita) the Divine Spirit. As, according to Vedanta, the latterproposition is affirmed, Yoga is that process by which the identity of the two (Jivatman andParamatman)—which identity ever exists, in fact—is realised by the Yogin or practitioner of Yoga.It is so realised because the Spirit has then pierced through the veil of Maya which as mind andmatter obscures this knowledge from itself. The means by which this is achieved is the Yogaprocess which liberates the Jiva from Maya. So the Gheranda-Samhita says: “There is no bondequal in strength to Maya, and no power greater to destroy that bond than Yoga.” From an Advaiticor Monistic standpoint, Yoga in the sense of a final union is inapplicable, for union implies adualism of the Divine and human spirit. In such case, it denotes theprocessrather than the result.When the two are regarded as distinct, Yoga may apply to both. A person who practises Yoga iscalled a Yogin. All are not competent to attempt Yoga; only a very few are. One must, in this or inother lives, have gone through Karma or selfless service and ritualistic observances, withoutattachment to the actions or their fruits, and Upasana or devotional worship, and obtained the fruitthereof, viz., a pure mind (Chittasuddhi). This does not mean merely a mind free from sexualimpurity. The attainment of this and other qualities is theABCofSadhana. A person may have apure mind in this sense, and yet be wholly incapable of Yoga. Chittasuddhi consists not merely inmoral purity of every kind, but in knowledge, detachment, capacity for pure intellectualfunctioning, attention, meditation and so forth. When by Karma Yoga and Upasana, the mind isbrought to this point and when, in the case of Jnana Yoga, there is dispassion and detachment fromthe world and its desires, then the Yoga path is open for the realisation of the ultimate Truth. Veryfew persons indeed are competent for Yoga in its higher form. The majority should seek theiradvancement along the path of Karma Yoga and devotion.There are four main forms of Yoga, according to one school of thought, namely MantraYoga, Hatha Yoga, Laya Yoga and Raja Yoga; Kundalini Yoga is really Laya Yoga. There isanother classification: Jnana Yoga, Raja Yoga, Laya Yoga, Hatha Yoga and Mantra Yoga. This isbased on the idea that there are five aspects of spiritual life:-Dharma, Kriya, Bhava, Jnana andYoga; Mantra Yoga being said to be of two kinds according as it is pursued along the path of Kriyaor Bhava. There are seven Sadhanas of Yoga, namely Sat-Karma, Asana, Mudra, Pratyahara,Pranayama, Dhyana and Samadhi, which are cleansing of the body, seat postures for Yogapurposes, the abstraction of the senses from their objects, breath-control, meditation, and ecstasywhich is of two kinds—imperfect (Savikalpa) in which dualism is not wholly overcome, andxvi"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"perfect (Nirvikalpa) which is complete Monistic experience–the realisation of the Truth of theMahavakya AHAM BRAHMASMI—a knowledge in the sense of realisation which, it is to beobserved, does not produce Liberation (Moksha) but is Liberation itself. The Samadhi of LayaYoga is said to be Savikalpa Samadhi and that of complete Raja Yoga is said to be NirvikalpaSamadhi. The first four processes are physical, last three mental and supramental. By these sevenprocesses respectively certain qualities are gained, namely, purity (Sodhana), firmness and strength(Dridhata), fortitude (Sthirata), steadiness (Dhairya), lightness (Laghava), realisation (Pratyaksha)and detachment leading to Liberation (Nirliptatva).What is known as the eight-limbed Yoga (Ashtanga Yoga) contains five of the aboveSadhanas (Asana, Pranayama, Pratyahara, Dhyana and Samadhi) and three others, namely, Yamaor self-control by way of chastity, temperance, avoidance of harm (Ahimsa), and other virtues;Niyama or religious observances, charity and so forth, with devotion to the Lord(Isvara-Pranidhana); and Dharana, the fixing of the internal organ on its object as directed in theYoga-practice.Man is a microcosm (Kshudra Brahmanda). Whatever exists in the outer universe exists inhim. All the Tattvas and worlds are within him and so is the Supreme Siva-Sakti. The body may bedivided into two main parts, namely, the head and trunk on the one hand, and the legs on the other.In man, the centre of the body is between these two, at the base of the spine where the legs begin.Supporting the trunk and throughout the whole body there is the spinal cord. This is the axis of thebody, just as Mount Meru is the axis of the earth. Hence, man’s spine is called Merudanda, the Meruor axis-staff. The legs and feet are gross which show less signs of consciousness than the trunk withits spinal white and grey matter; which trunk itself is greatly subordinate in this respect to the headcontaining the organ of mind, or physical brain, with its white and grey matter. The positions of thewhite and grey matter in the head and spinal column respectively are reversed. The body and legsbelow the centre are the seven lower or nether worlds upheld by the sustaining Sakti or Powers ofthe universe. From the centre upwards, consciousness more freely manifests through the spinal andcerebral centres. Here there are the seven upper regions or Lokas, a term which means “What areseen” (Lokyante), that is, experienced, and are hence the fruits of Karma in the form of particularrebirth. These regions, namely, Bhuh, Bhuvah, Svah, Tapa, Jana, Maha and Satya Lokascorrespond with the six centres; five in the trunk, the sixth in the lower cerebral centre; and theseventh in the upper brain or Satyaloka, the abode of the Supreme Siva-Sakti.The six centres are: the Muladhara or root-support situated at the base of the spinal columnin a position midway in the perineum between the root of the genitals and the anus; above it, in theregion of the genitals, abdomen, heart, chest and throat, and in the forehead between the two eyes,are the Svadhishthana, Manipura, Anahata, Visuddha and Ajna Chakras or lotuses respectively.These are the chief centres, though some texts speak of others such as the Lalana and Manas andSoma Chakras. The seventh region beyond the Chakras is the upper brain, the highest centre ofmanifestation of consciousness in the body and therefore, the abode of the Supreme Siva-Sakti.When it is said to be the “abode”, it is not meant that the Supreme is there placed in the sense of our“placing”, namely, it is there and not elsewhere! The Supreme is never localised, whilst itsmanifestations are. It is everywhere both within and without the body, but it is said to be in theSahasrara, because it is there that the Supreme Siva-Sakti is realised. And, this must be so, becauseconsciousness is realised by entering in and passing through the higher manifestation of mind, thexvii"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Sattvamayi Buddhi, above and beyond which is Chit and Chidrupini Saktis themselves. From theirSiva-Sakti Tattva aspect are evolved Mind in its form as Buddhi, Ahamkara, Manas and associatedsenses (Indriyas) the centre of which is above the Ajna Chakra and below the Sahasrara. FromAhamkara proceed the Tanmatras, or generals of the sense-particulars, which evolve the five formsof sensible matter (Bhuta), namely, Akasa (ether), Vayu (air), Agni (fire), Apah (water) and Prithvi(earth). The English translation given does not imply that the Bhutas are the same as the Englishelements of air, fire, water, earth. The terms indicate varying degrees of matter from the ethereal tothe solid. Thus Prithvi or earth is any matter in the Prithvi state; that is, which may be sensed by theIndriya of smell. Mind and matter pervade the whole body. But there are centres therein in whichthey are predominant. Thus Ajna is the centre of mind, and the five lower Chakras are the centres ofthe five Bhutas; Visuddha of Akasa, Anahata of Vayu, Manipura of Agni, Svadhishthana of Apah,and Muladhara of Prithvi.In short, man as a microcosm is the all-pervading Spirit (which most purely manifests in theSahasrara) vehicled by Sakti in the form of mind and matter, the centres of which are the sixth andfollowing five Chakras respectively.The six Chakras have been identified with the following plexuses commencing from thelowest, the Muladhara; the sacrococcygeal plexus, the sacral plexus, the solar plexus, (which formsthe great junction of the right and left sympathetic chains Ida and Pingala with the cerebro-spinalaxis). Connected with this is the lumbar plexus. Then follows the cardiac plexus (Anahata),laryngeal plexus, and lastly the Ajna or cerebellum with its two lobes. Above this is theManas-Chakra or middle cerebrum, and finally, the Sahasrara or upper cerebrum. The six Chakrasthemselves are vital centres within the spinal column in the white and grey matter there. They may,however, and probably do, influence and govern the gross tract outside the spine in the bodilyregion lateral to, and co-extensive with, that section of the spinal column in which a particularcentre is situated. The Chakras are centres of Sakti as vital force. In other words these are centres ofPranasakti manifested by Pranavayu in the living body, the presiding Devatas of which are namesfor the Universal Consciousness as It manifests in the form of those centres. The Chakras are notperceptible to the gross senses. Even if they were perceptible in the living body which they help toorganise, they disappear with the disintegration of organism at death. Just because post-mortemexamination of the body does not reveal these Chakras in the spinal column, some people think thatthese Chakras do not exist at all, and are merely the fabrication of a fertile brain. This attitudereminds us of a doctor who declared that he had performed many post-mortems and had never yetdiscovered a soul!The petals of the lotuses vary, being 4, 6, 10, 12, 16 and 2 respectively, commencing fromthe Muladhara and ending with Ajna. There are 50 in all, as are the letters of the alphabet which arein the petals; that is, the Matrikas are associated with the Tattvas; since both are products of thesame creative Cosmic process manifesting either as physiological or psychological function. It isnoteworthy that the number of the petals is that of the letters leaving out either Ksha or the secondLa, and that these 50 multiplied by 20 are in the 1000 petals of the Sahasrara, a number which isindicative of infinitude.But why, it may be asked, do the petals vary in number? Why, for instance, are there 4 in theMuladhara and 6 in the Svadhishthana? The answer given is that the number of petals in any Chakraxviii"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"is determined by the number and position of the Nadis or Yoga-nerves around that Chakra. Thus,four Nadis surrounding and passing through the vital movements of the Muladhara Chakra, give itthe appearance of a lotus of four petals which are thus configurations made by the positions ofNadis at any particular centre. These Nadis are not those which are known to the Vaidya. The latterare gross physical nerves. But the former, here spoken of, are called Yoga-Nadis and are subtlechannels (Vivaras) along which the Pranic currents flow. The term Nadi comes from the root Nadwhich means motion. The body is filled with an uncountable number of Nadis. If they wererevealed to the eye, the body would present the appearance of a highly-complicated chart of oceancurrents. Superficially the water seems one and the same. But examination shows that it is movingwith varying degrees of force in all directions. All these lotuses exist in the spinal columns.The Merudanda is the vertebral column. Western anatomy divides it into five regions; and itis to be noted in corroboration of the theory here expounded that these correspond with the regionsin which the five Chakras are situated. The central spinal system comprises the brain or encephaloncontained within the skull (in which are the Lalana, Ajna, Manas, Soma Chakras and theSahasrara); as also the spinal cord extending from the upper border of the Atlas below thecerebellum and descending to the second lumbor vertebra where it tapers to a point called the filumterminale. Within the spine is the cord, a compound of grey and white brain matter, in which are thefive lower Chakras. It is noteworthy that the filum terminale was formerly thought to be a merefibrous cord, an unsuitable vehicle, one might think, for the Muladhara Chakra and Kundalini Sakti.More recent microscopic investigations have, however, disclosed the existence of highly sensitivegrey matter in the filum terminale which represents the position of the Muladhara. According toWestern science, the spinal cord is not merely a conductor between the periphery and the centres ofsensation and volition, but is also an independent centre or group of centres. The Sushumna is aNadi in the centre of the spinal column. Its base is called Brahma-Dvara or Gate of Brahman. Asregards the physiological relations of the Chakras all that can be said with any degree of certainty isthat the four above Muladhara have relation to the genito-excretory, digestive, cardiac andrespiratory functions and that the two upper centres, the Ajna (with associated Chakras) and theSahasrara denote various forms of its cerebral activity ending in the repose of Pure Consciousnesstherein gained through Yoga. The Nadis of each side Ida and Pingala are the left and rightsympathetic cords crossing the central column from one side to the other, making at the Ajna withthe Sushumna a threefold knot called Triveni; which is said to be the spot in the Medulla where thesympathetic cords join together and whence they take their origin—these Nadis together with thetwo lobed Ajna and the Sushumna forming the figure of the Caduceus of the God Mercury which issaid by some to represent them.How is it that the rousing of Kundalini Sakti and Her union with Siva effect the state ofecstatic union (Samadhi) and spiritual experience which is alleged?In the first place, there are two main lines of Yoga, namely, Dhyana or Bhavana-Yoga andKundalini Yoga; and there is a marked difference between the two. The first class of Yoga is that inwhich ecstasy (Samadhi) is obtained by intellective processes (Kriya-Jnana) of meditation and thelike, with the aid, it may be, of auxiliary processes of Mantra or Hatha Yoga (other than the rousingof Kundalini) and by detachment from the world; the second stands apart as that portion of HathaYoga in which, though intellective processes are not neglected, the creative and sustaining Sakti ofthe whole body is actually and truly united with the Lord Consciousness. The Yogin makes Herxix"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"introduce him to Her Lord, and enjoys the bliss of union through her. Though it is he who arousesHer, it is She who gives knowledge or Jnana, for She is Herself that. The Dhyana Yogin gains whatacquaintance with the Supreme state his own meditative powers can give him and knows not theenjoyment of union with Siva in and through the fundamental Body-power. The two forms of Yogadiffer both as to method and result. The Hatha Yogin regards his Yoga and its fruit as the highest;the Jnana Yogin may think similarly of his own. Kundalini is so renowned that many seek to knowher. Having studied the theory of this Yoga, one may ask: “Can one get on without it?” The answeris: “It depends upon what you are looking for”. If you want to rouse Kundalini Sakti, to enjoy thebliss of union of Siva and Sakti through Her and to gain the accompanying powers (Siddhis), it isobvious that this end can be achieved only by the Kundalini Yoga. In that case, there are some risksincurred. But if Liberation is sought without desire for union through Kundalini, then, such Yoga isnot necessary; for, Liberation may be obtained by Pure Jnana Yoga through detachment, theexercise and then the stilling of the mind, without any rousing of the central Bodily-power at all.Instead of setting out in and from the world to unite with Siva, the Jnana Yogin, to attain this result,detaches himself from the world. The one is the path of enjoyment and the other of asceticism.Samadhi may also be obtained on the path of devotion (Bhakti) as on that of knowledge. Indeed, thehighest devotion (Para Bhakti) is not different from Knowledge. Both are Realisation. But, whilstLiberation (Mukti) is attainable by either method, there are other marked differences between thetwo. A Dhyana Yogin should not neglect his body, knowing that as he is both mind and matter, eachreacts, the one upon the other. Neglect or mere mortification of the body is more apt to producedisordered imagination than a true spiritual experience. He is not concerned, however, with thebody in the sense that the Hatha Yogin is. It is possible to be a successful Dhyana Yogin and yet tobe weak in body and health, sick and short-lived. His body, and not he himself, determines when heshall die. He cannot die at will. When he is in Samadhi, Kundalini Sakti is still sleeping in theMuladhara, and none of the physical symptoms and psychical bliss or powers (Siddhis) describedas accompanying Her rousing are observed in his case. The ecstasy which he calls “Liberationwhile yet living” (Jivanmukti) is not a state like that of real Liberation. He may be still subject to asuffering body from which he escapes only at death, when if at all, he is liberated. His ecstasy is inthe nature of a meditation which passes into the Void (Bhavana-samadhi) effected through negationof all thought-form (Chitta-Vritti) and detachment from the world—a comparatively negativeprocess in which the positive act of raising the Central Power of the body takes no part. By hiseffort, the mind which is a product of Kundalini as Prakriti Sakti, together with its worldly desires,is stilled so that the veil produced by mental functioning is removed from Consciousness. In LayaYoga, Kundalini Herself, when roused by the Yogin (for such rousing is his act and part), achievesfor him this illumination.But why, it may be asked, should one trouble over the body and its Central power, the moreparticularly as there are unusual risks and difficulties involved? The answer has been already given.There is completeness and certainty of Realisation through the agency of the Power which isKnowledge itself (Jnanarupa Sakti), an intermediate acquisition of powers (Siddhis), andintermediate and final enjoyment.If the Ultimate Reality is the One which exists in two aspects of quiescent enjoyment of theSelf, and of liberation from all form and active enjoyment of objects, that is, as pure spirit and spiritin matter, then a complete union with Reality demands such unity in both of its aspects. It must beknown both here (Iha) and there (Amutra). When rightly apprehended and practised, there is truthxx"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"in the doctrine which teaches that man should make the best of both worlds. There is no realincompatibility between the two, provided action is taken in conformity with the universal law ofmanifestation. It is held to be false teaching that happiness hereafter can only be had by absence ofenjoyment now, or in deliberately sought for suffering and mortification. It is the one Siva who isthe Supreme Blissful Experience and who appears in the form of man with a life of mingledpleasure and pain. Both happiness here and the bliss of Liberation here and hereafter may beattained, if the identity of these Sivas be realised in every human act. This will be achieved bymaking every human function, without exception, a religious act of sacrifice and worship (Yajna).In the ancient Vaidik ritual, enjoyment by way of food and drink was preceded and accompanied byceremonial sacrifice and ritual. Such enjoyment was the fruit of the sacrifice and the gift of theDevas. At a higher stage in the life of a Sadhaka, it is offered to the One from whom all gifts comeand of whom the Devatas are inferior limited forms. But this offering also involves a dualism fromwhich the highest Monistic (Advaita) Sadhana is free. Here the individual life and the world life areknown as one. And the Sadhaka, when eating or drinking or fulfilling any other of the naturalfunctions of the body, does so, saying and feeling “Sivoham”. It is not merely the separateindividual who thus acts and enjoys. It is Siva who does so in and through him. Such a onerecognises, as has been said, that his life and the play of all its activities are not a thing apart, to beheld and pursued egotistically for its and his own separate sake, as though enjoyment wassomething to be filched from life by his own unaided strength and with a sense of separatedness; buthis life and all its activities are conceived as part of the Divine action in Nature (Shakti) manifestingand operating in the form of man. He realises in the pulsating beat of his heart the rhythm whichthrobs through and is the song of the Universal Life. To neglect or to deny the needs of the body, tothink of it as something not divine, is to neglect and deny the greater life of which it is a part, and tofalsify the great doctrine of the unity of all and of the ultimate identity of Matter and Spirit.Governed by such a concept, even the lowliest physical needs take on a cosmic significance. Thebody is Shakti; its needs are Shakti’s needs. When man enjoys, it is Shakti who enjoys through him.In all he sees and does, it is the Mother who looks and acts, His eyes and hands are Hers. The wholebody and all its functions are Her manifestations. To fully realise Her as such is to perfect thisparticular manifestation of Hers which is himself. Man when seeking to be the master of himself,seeks so on all the planes physical, mental and spiritual nor can they be severed, for they are allrelated, being but differing aspects of the one all-pervading Consciousness. Who, it may be asked,is the more divine; he who neglects and spurns the body or mind that he may attain some fanciedspiritual superiority, or he who rightly cherishes both as forms of the one Spirit which they clothe?Realisation is more speedily and truly attained by discerning Spirit in and as all being and itsactivities, then by fleeing from and casting these aside as being either unspiritual or illusory andimpediments in the path. If not rightly conceived, they may be impediments and the cause of fall;otherwise they become instruments of attainment; and what others are there to hand? And so, whenacts are done in the fight feeling and frame of mind (Bhava), those acts give enjoyment; and therepeated and prolonged Bhava produces at length that divine experience (Tattva-Jnana) which isLiberation. When the Mother is seen in all things, She is at length realised as She who is beyondthem all.These general principles have their more frequent application in the life of the world beforeentrance on the path of Yoga proper. The Yoga here described is, however, also an application ofthese same principles, in so far as it is claimed that thereby both Bhukti and Mukti (enjoyment andliberation) are attained.xxi"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"By the lower processes of Hatha Yoga it is sought to attain a perfect physical body whichwill also be a wholly fit instrument by which the mind may function. A perfect mind, again,approaches and, in Samadhi, passes into Pure Consciousness itself. The Hatha Yogin thus seeks abody which shall be as strong as steel, healthy, free from suffering and therefore, long-lived. Masterof the body he is—the master of both life and death. His lustrous form enjoys the vitality of youth.He lives as long as he has the will to live and enjoys in the world of forms. His death is the death atwill (Iccha-Mrityu); wheh making the great and wonderfully expressive gesture of dissolution,(Samhara-Mudra) he grandly departs. But, it may be said, the Hatha Yogins do get sick and die. Inthe first place, the full discipline is one of difficulty and risk, and can only be pursued under theguidance of a skilled Guru. Unaided and unsuccessful practice may lead not only to disease, butdeath. He who seeks to conquer the Lord of death incurs the risk, on failure, of a more speedyconquest by Him. All who attempt this Yoga do not, of course, succeed or meet with the samemeasure of success. Those who fail not only incur the infirmities of ordinary men, but also othersbrought on by practices which have been ill-pursued or for which they are not fit. Those again whodo succeed, do so in varying degrees. One may prolong his life to the sacred age of 84, others to 100,others yet further. In theory at least those who are perfected (Siddhas) go from this plane when theywill. All have not the same capacity or opportunity, through want of will, bodily strength, orcircumstance. All may not be willing or able to follow the strict rules necessary for success. Nordoes modern life offer in general the opportunities for so complete a physical culture. All men maynot desire such a life or may think the attainment of it not worth the trouble involved. Some maywish to be rid of their body and that as speedily as possible. It is, therefore, said that it is easier togain Liberation than Deathlessness! The former may be had by unselfishness, detachment from theworld, moral and mental discipline. But to conquer death is harder than this, for these qualities andacts will not alone avail. He who does so conquer, holds life in the hollow of one hand and, if he be asuccessful (Siddha) Yogin, Liberation in the other hand. He has Enjoyment and Liberation. He isthe Emperor who is Master of the World and the possessor of the Bliss which is beyond all worlds.Therefore, it is claimed by the Hatha Yogin that every Sadhana is inferior to Hatha Yoga!The Hatha Yogin who works for Liberation does so through Laya Yoga Sadhana orKundalini Yoga which gives both enjoyment and Liberation. At every centre to which he rousesKundalini he experiences special form of Bliss and gains special powers. Carrying Her to Siva ofhis cerebral centre, he enjoys the Supreme Bliss which in its nature is that of Liberation, and whichwhen established in permanence is Liberation itself on the loosening of Spirit and Body.Energy (Shakti) polarises itself into two forms, namely, static or potential (Kundalini), anddynamic (the working forces of the body as Prana). Behind all activity there is a static background.This static centre in the human body is the central Serpent Power in the Muladhara (root-support). Itis the power which is the static support (Adhara) of the whole body and all its moving Pranic forces.This Centre (Kendra) of Power is a gross form of Chit or Consciousness; that is, in itself (Svarupa),it is Consciousness; and by appearance it is a Power which, as the highest form of Force, is amanifestation of it. Just as there is a distinction (though identical at base) between the SupremeQuiescent Consciousness and Its active Power (Shakti), so when Consciousness manifests asEnergy (Sakti), it possesses the twin aspects of potential and kinetic Energy. There can be nopartition in fact of Reality. To the perfect eye of the Siddha the process of becoming is an ascription(Adhyasa). But to the imperfect eye of the Sadhaka, that is, the aspirant for Siddhi (perfectedaccomplishment), to the spirit which is still toiling through the lower planes and variouslyxxii"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"identifying itself with them, becoming is tending to appear and an appearance is real. The KundaliniYoga is a rendering of Vedantic Truth from this practical point of view, and represents theworld-process as a polarisation in Consciousness itself. This polarity as it exists in, and as, the bodyis destroyed by Yoga which disturbs the equilibrium of bodily consciousness, which consciousnessis the result of the maintenance of these two poles. The human body, the potential pole of Energywhich is the Supreme Power, is stirred to action, upon which the moving forces (dynamic Shakti)supported by it are drawn thereto, and the whole dynamism thus engendered moves upwards tounite with the quiescent Consciousness in the Highest Lotus.There is polarisation of Shakti into two forms—static and dynamic. In the mind orexperience this polarisation is patent to reflection; namely, the polarity between pure Chit and theStress which is involved in it. This Stress or Shakti develops the mind through an infinity of formsand changes in the pure unbounded Ether of Consciousness—the Chidakasa. This analysis exhibitsthe primordial Shakti in the same two polar forms as before, static and dynamic. Here the polarity ismost fundamental and approaches absoluteness, though of course, it is to be remembered that thereis no absolute rest except in pure Chit. Cosmic energy is in an equilibrium which is relative and notabsolute.Passing from mind, let us take matter. The atom of modern science has ceased to be an atomin the sense of an indivisible unit of matter. According to the electron theory, the atom is a miniatureuniverse resembling our solar system. At the centre of this atomic system we have a charge ofpositive electricity around which a cloud of negative charges called electrons revolve. The positivecharges hold each other in check so that the atom is in a condition of equilibrated energy and doesnot ordinarily break up, though it may do so on the dissociation which is the characteristic of allmatter, but which is so clearly manifest in the radioactivity of radium. We have thus here again, apositive charge at rest at the centre, and negative charges in motion round about the centre. What isthus said about the atom applies to the whole cosmic system and universe. In the world-system, theplanets revolve around the Sun, and that system itself is probably (taken as a whole) a moving massaround some other relatively static centre, until we arrive at the Brahma-Bindu which is the point ofAbsolute Rest, around which all forms revolve and by which all are maintained. Similarly, in thetissues of the living body, the operative energy is polarised into two forms of energy—anabolic andcatabolic, the one tending to change and the other to conserve the tissues; the actual condition of thetissues being simply the resultant of these two co-existent or concurrent activities.In short, Shakti, when manifesting, divides itself into two polar aspects—static anddynamic—which implies that you cannot have it in a dynamic form without at the same time havingit in a static form, much like the poles of a magnet. In any given sphere of activity of force, we musthave, according to the cosmic principle of a static back-ground—Shakti at rest or “coiled”. Thisscientific truth is illustrated in the figure Kali, the Divine Mother moving as the Kinetic Shakti onthe breast of Sadasiva who is the static background of pure Chit which is actionless, the GunamayiMother being all activity.The Cosmic Shakti is the collectivity (Samashti) in relation to which the Kundalini inparticular bodies is the Vyashti (individual) Shakti. The body is, as I have stated, a microcosm(Kshudrabrahmanda). In the living body there is, therefore, the same polarisation of which I havespoken. From the Mahakundalini the universe has sprung. In Her Supreme Form She is at rest,xxiii"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"coiled round and one (as Chidrupini) with the Siva-bindu. She is then at rest. She next uncoilsHerself to manifest. Here the three coils of which the Kundalini Yoga speaks are the three Gunasand the three and a half coil are the Prakriti and its three Gunas, together with the Vikritis. Her 50coils are the letters of the Alphabet. As she goes on uncoiling, the Tattvas and the Matrikas, theMother of the Varnas, issue from Her. She is thus moving, and continues even after creation tomove in the Tattvas so created. For, as they are born of movement, they continue to move. Thewhole world (Jagat), as the Sanskrit term implies, is moving. She thus continues creatively actinguntil She has evolved Prithvi, the last of the Tattvas. First She creates mind, and then matter. Thislatter becomes more and more dense. It has been suggested that the Mahabhutas are the Densities ofmodern science:—Air density associated with the maximum velocity of gravity; Fire densityassociated with the velocity of light; Water or fluid density associated with molecular velocity andthe equatorial velocity of the earth’s rotation; and Earth density, that of basalt associated with theNewtonian velocity of sound. However this be, it is plain that the Bhutas represent an increasingdensity of matter until it reaches its three dimensional solid form. When Shakti has created this lastor Prithvi Tattva, what is there further for Her to do? Nothing. She therefore then again rests. Atrest, again, means that She assumes a static form. Shakti, however, is never exhausted, that is,emptied into any of its forms. Therefore, Kundalini Shakti at this point is, as it were, the Shakti leftover (though yet a plenum) after the Prithvi, the last of the Bhutas, has been created. We have thusMahakundalini at rest as Chidrupini Shakti in the Sahasrara, the point of absolute rest; and then thebody in which the relative static centre is Kundalini at rest, and around this centre the whole of thebodily forces move. They are Shakti, and so is Kundalini Shakti. The difference between the two isthat they are Shaktis in specific differentiated forms in movement; and Kundalini Shakti isundifferentiated, residual Shakti at rest, that is, coiled. She is coiled in the Muladhara, which means‘fundamental support’, and which is at the same time the seat of the Prithvi or last solid Tattva andof the residual Shakti or Kundalini. The body may, therefore, be compared to a magnet with twopoles. The Muladhara, in so far as it is the seat of Kundalini Shakti, a comparatively gross form ofChit (being Chit-Shakti and Maya Shakti), is the static pole in relation to the rest of the body whichis dynamic. The working that is the body necessarily presupposes and finds such a static support,hence the name Muladhara. In sense, the static Sakti at the Muladhara is necessarily coexistent withthe creating and evolving Shakti of the body; because the dynamic aspect or pole can never bewithout its static counterpart. In another sense, it is the residual Shakti left over after such operation.What then happens in the accomplishment of this Yoga? This static Shakti is affected byPranayama and other Yogic processes and becomes dynamic. Thus, when completely dynamic,that is when Kundalini unites with Siva in the Sahasrara, the polarisation of the body gives way. Thetwo poles are united in one and there is the state of consciousness called Samadhi. The polarisation,of course, takes place in consciousness. The body actually continues to exist as an object ofobservation to others. It continues its organic life. But man’s consciousness of his body and all otherobjects is withdrawn because the mind has ceased so far as his consciousness is concerned, thefunction having been withdrawn into its ground which is consciousness.How is the body sustained? In the first place, though Kundalini Sakti is the static centre ofthe whole body as a complete conscious organism, yet each of the parts of the body and theirconstituent cells have their own static centres which uphold such parts or cells. Next, the theory ofthe Yogins themselves is that Kundalini ascends and that the body, as a complete organism, ismaintained by the nectar which flows from the union of Siva and Sakti in the Sahasrara. This nectarxxiv"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"is an ejection of power generated by their union. The potential Kundalini Sakti becomes only partlyand not wholly converted into kinetic Sakti; and yet since Sakti—even as given in theMuladhara—is an infinitude, it is not depleted; the potential store always remains unexhausted. Inthis case, the dynamic equivalent is a partial conversion of one mode of energy into another. If,however, the coiled power at the Muladhara became absolutely uncoiled, there would result thedissolution of the three bodies—gross, subtle and causal, and consequently, Videha-Mukti,bodiless Liberation—because the static background in relation to a particular form of existencewould, according to this hypothesis, have wholly given way. The body becomes cold as a corpse asthe Sakti leaves it, not due to the depletion or privation of the static power at the Muladhara but tothe concentration or convergence of the dynamic power ordinarily diffused over the whole body, sothat the dynamic equivalent which is set up against the static background of Kundalini Sakti is onlythe diffused fivefold Prana gathered home—withdrawn from the other tissues of the body andconcentrated along the axis. Thus, ordinarily, the dynamic equivalent is the Prana diffused over allthe tissues: in Yoga, it is converged along the axis, the static equivalent of Kundalini Sakti enduringin both cases. Some part of the already available dynamic Prana is made to act at the base of the axisin a suitable manner, by which means the basal centre or Muladhara becomes, as it were,oversaturated and reacts on the whole diffused dynamic power (or Prana) of the body bywithdrawing it from the tissues and converging it along the line of the axis. In this way, the diffuseddynamic equivalent becomes the converged dynamic equivalent along the axis. What, according tothis view, ascends is not the whole Sakti but an eject like condensed lightning, which at lengthreaches the Parama-Sivasthana. There the Central Power which upholds the individualworld-Consciousness is merged in the Supreme Consciousness. The limited consciousness,transcending the passing concepts of worldly life, directly intuits the unchanging Reality whichunderlies the whole phenomenal flow. When Kundalini Sakti sleeps in the Muladhara, man isawake to the world; when she awakes to unite, and does unite, with the supreme staticConsciousness which is Siva, then consciousness is asleep to the world and is one with the Light ofall things.The main principle is that when awakened, Kundalini Sakti, either Herself or Her eject,ceases to be a static Power which sustains the world-consciousness, the content of which is heldonly so long as She sleeps; and when once set in movement is drawn to that other static centre in theThousand-petalled Lotus (Sahasrara) which is Herself in union with the Siva-consciousness or theconsciousness of ecstasy beyond the world of form. When Kundalini sleeps, man is awake to thisworld. When She wakes, he sleeps—that is, loses all consciousness of the world and enters hiscausal body. In Yoga, he passes beyond to formless Consciousness.Glory, glory to Mother Kundalini, who through Her Infinite Grace and Power, kindly leadsthe Sadhaka from Chakra to Chakra and illumines his intellect and makes him realise his identitywith the Supreme Brahman! May Her blessings be upon you all!xxv"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"CONTENTSPUBLISHERS’ NOTE......................................iiiGURU STOTRA.........................................iiiDEVI STOTRA..........................................ivSIVA STOTRA..........................................vTHE FOUR STAGES OF SOUND................................vPREFACE.............................................viPRAYER TO MOTHER KUNDALINI..............................xEXPERIENCES ON AWAKENING OF KUNDALINI.....................xiTHE GRADATIONAL ASCENT OF THE MIND.......................xiPRANAYAMA FOR AWAKENING KUNDALINI......................xiiKUNDALINI PRANAYAMA.................................xiiiKUNDALINI..........................................xiiiINTRODUCTION........................................xviChapter OnePRELIMINARYFoundation—Vairagya.......................................2What Is Yoga?...........................................3The Importance Of Kundalini Yoga................................3Important Qualifications Of A Sadhaka..............................4Yogic Diet.............................................5Sattvic Articles...........................................6Forbidden Articles.........................................6Mitahara..............................................7The Place For Yoga Sadhana....................................8The Time..............................................9TheAge ..............................................9Necessity For A Yogic Guru....................................9Who Is A Guru?..........................................10Spiritual Power..........................................12Chapter TwoKUNDALINI YOGA—THEORYYoga Nadis............................................14Spinal Column..........................................15Sukshma Sarira..........................................17Kanda...............................................17Spinal Cord............................................17Sushumna Nadi..........................................19Para-Sympathetic And Sympathetic System...........................20Ida And Pingala Nadis......................................20Svara Sadhana..........................................23How To Change The Flow In Nadis................................23xxvi"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Other Nadis............................................24Padmas Or Chakras........................................24Petals On Chakras.........................................25Muladhara Chakra........................................26Svadhishthana Chakra......................................27Manipura Chakra.........................................28Anahata Chakra..........................................28Vishuddha Chakra........................................29Ajna Chakra...........................................30The Brain.............................................31Brahmarandhra..........................................32Sahasrara Chakra.........................................33Lalana Chakra..........................................33Summary Of The Previous Lessons................................33The Mysterious Kundalini....................................34Chapter ThreeYOGA SADHANAHow To Awaken The Kundalini.................................351.

Every man in this world is restless, discontented anddissatisfied. He feels actually that he is in want of something, the nature of which he does not reallyunderstand. He seeks the rest and peace that he feels he is in need of, in the accomplishment ofambitious projects. But he finds that worldly greatness when secured is a delusion and a snare. Hedoubtless does not find any happiness in it. He gets degrees, diplomas, titles, honours, powers,name and fame; he marries; he begets children; in short, he gets all that he imagines would give himhappiness. But yet, he finds no rest and peace.Are you not ashamed to repeat the same process of eating, sleeping and talking again andagain? Are you not really fed up with the illusory objects created by the jugglery of Maya? Haveyou got a single sincere friend in this universe? Is there any difference between an animal and theso-called dignified human being with boasted intellect, if he does not do any spiritual Sadhanadaily, for Self-realisation? How long do you want to remain a slave of passion, Indriyas, woman andbody? Fie on those miserable wretches who revel in filth and who have forgotten their real Atmicnature and their hidden powers!The so-called educated persons are refined sensualists only. Sensual pleasure is no pleasureat all. Indriyas are deceiving you at every moment. Pleasure mixed with pain, sorrow, fear, sin,diseases is no pleasure at all. The happiness that depends upon perishable objects is no happiness. Ifyour wife dies, you weep. If you lose money or property, you are drowned in sorrow. How long doyou want to remain in that abject, degraded state? Those who waste their precious life in eating,sleeping and chatting without doing any Sadhana are brutes only.You have forgotten your real Svarupa or purpose of life on account of Avidya, Maya, Mohaand Raga. You are tossed up hither and thither aimlessly by the two currents of Raga and Dvesha.You are caught up in Samsara-Chakra on account of your egoism, Vasanas, Trishnas and passionsof various sorts.You want aNitya(eternal),Nirupadhika(independent),Niratisaya(Infinite)Ananda.Thisyou will find in your realisation of the Self only. Then alone will all your miseries and tribulationsmelt away. You have taken this body only to achieve this end.“Din nike bite jate hain—The daysare passing away quickly.” The day has come and gone. Will you waste the night also?2"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"“Aashaya badhyate loko karmana bahu-chintaya;Ayukshinam na janati tasmat jagrata jagrata—You are bound in this world by desires, actions and manifold anxieties. Therefore you donot know that your life is slowly decaying and is wasted. Therefore wake up, wake up.”Now wake up. Open your eyes. Apply diligently to spiritual Sadhana. Never waste even aminute. Many Yogins and Jnanins, Dattatreya, Patanjali, Christ, Buddha, Gorakhnath,Matsyendranath, Ram Das and others have already trodden the spiritual path and realised throughSadhana. Follow their teachings and instructions implicitly.Courage, Power, Strength, Wisdom, Joy and Happiness are your Divine heritage, yourbirth-right. Get them all through proper Sadhana. It will be simply preposterous to think that yourGuru will do the Sadhana for you. You are your own redeemer. Gurus and Acharyas will show youthe spiritual path, remove doubts and troubles and give some inspiration. You will have to tread theSpiritual Path. Remember this point well. You will have to place each step yourself in the SpiritualPath. Therefore do real Sadhana. Free yourself from death and birth and enjoy the Highest Bliss.WHAT IS YOGA?The word ‘Yoga’ comes from a Sanskrit root‘Yuj’which means to join. In its spiritual senseit is that process by which the identity of the Jivatma and Paramatma is realised by the Yogins. Thehuman soul is brought into conscious communion with God. Yoga is restraining the mentalmodifications. Yoga is that inhibition of the functions of the mind which leads to abidance of thespirit in his real nature. The inhibition of these functions of the mind is by Abhyasa and Vairagya”(Yoga Sutras).Yoga is the Science that teaches the method of joining the human spirit with God. Yoga isthe Divine Science which disentangles the Jiva from the phenomenal world of sense-objects andlinks him with theAnanta Ananda(Infinite Bliss),Parama Shanti(Supreme Peace), joy of anAkhanda character and Power that are inherent attributes of the Absolute. Yoga gives Muktithrough Asamprajnata Samadhi by destroying all the Sankalpas of all antecedent mental functions.No Samadhi is possible without awakening the Kundalini. When the Yogi attains the highest stage,all his Karmas are burnt and he gets liberation from Samsara-Chakra.THE IMPORTANCE OF KUNDALINI YOGAIn Kundalini Yoga the creating and sustaining Sakti of the whole body is actually and trulyunited with Lord Siva. The Yogi goads Her to introduce him to Her Lord. The rousing of KundaliniSakti and Her Union with Lord Siva effects the state ofSamadhi(Ecstatic union) and spiritualAnubhava(experience). It is She who gives Knowledge or Jnana, for She is Herself That. KundaliniHerself, when awakened by the Yogins, achieves for them the Jnana (illumination).Kundalini can be awakened by various means and these different methods are called bydifferent names, viz., Raja Yoga, Hatha Yoga, etc. The practitioner of this Kundalini Yoga claims,that it is higher than any other process and that Samadhi attained thereby is more perfect. The reason3PRELIMINARY"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"that they allege, is this:—In Dhyana Yoga, ecstasy takes place through detachment from the worldand mental concentration leading the variety of mental operation (Vritti) of the uprising of pureconsciousness unhindered by the limitations of the mind. The degree to which this unveiling ofconsciousness is effected, depends upon the meditative power, Dhyana Sakti, of the Sadhaka andthe extent of detachment from the world. On the other hand, Kundalini is all Sakti and is thereforeJnana Sakti Herself—bestows Jnana and Mukti, when awakened by the Yogins. Secondly, inKundalini Yoga there is not merely a Samadhi through meditation, but the central power of the Jiva,carries with it the forms of both body and mind. The union in that sense is claimed to be morecomplete than that enacted through methods only. Though in both cases the body-consciousness islost, in Kundalini Yoga not only the mind but the body also, in so far as it is represented by itscentral power, is actually united with Lord Siva at the Sahasrara Chakra. This union (Samadhi)producesBhukti(enjoyment) which a Dhyana Yogi does not possess. A Kundalini Yogi has bothBhukti(enjoyment) andMukti(liberation) in the fullest and literal sense. Hence this Yoga isclaimed to be the foremost of all Yogas. When the sleeping Kundalini is awakened by YogicKriyas, it forces a passage upwards through the different Chakras (Shat-ChakraBheda). It excitesor stimulates them into intense activity. During its ascent, layer after layer of the mind becomesfully opened. AllKleshas(afflictions) and the three kinds of Taapa will vanish. The Yogiexperiences various visions, powers, bliss and knowledge. When it reaches Sahasrara Chakra in thebrain, the Yogi gets the maximum knowledge, Bliss, power and Siddhis. He reaches the highestrung in the Yogic ladder. He gets perfectly detached from body and mind. He becomes free in allrespects. He is a full-blown Yogi (Purna Yogi).IMPORTANT QUALIFICATIONS OF A SADHAKAWhen the whole vitality is sapped from the body one cannot do any rigid Sadhana. Youth isthe best period for Yoga Abhyasa. This is the first and the foremost qualification of a Sadhaka; theremust be vigour and vitality.One who has a calm mind, who has faith in the words of his Guru and Sastras, who ismoderate in eating and sleeping and who has the intense longing for deliverance from theSamsara-Chakra is a qualified person for the practice of Yoga.“Ahamkaram balam darpam kamam krodham parigraham; Vimuchya nirmamah santobrahmabhuyaya kalpate -Having cast aside egoism, violence, arrogance, desire, wrath, covetousness, selfless andpeaceful—he is fit to become ETERNAL.”Those who are addicted to sensual pleasures or those who are arrogant and proud, dishonest,untruthful, diplomatic, cunning and treacherous and who disrespect the Guru, Sadhus and eldersand take pleasure in vain controversies and worldly actions, can never attain success in Yogicpractices.Kama, Krodha, Lobha, Moha, Mada, and all other impurities should be completelyannihilated. One cannot become pure and perfect when one has so many impure qualities.4KUNDALINI YOGA"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Sadhakas should develop the following virtuous qualities:Straightforwardness, service to Guru, the sick and old persons, Ahimsa, Brahmacharya,spontaneous generosity, Titiksha, Sama Drishti, Samata, spirit of service, selflessness, tolerance,Mitahara, humility, honesty and other virtues to an enormous degree. Aspirants will not at all bebenefited in any way in the absence of these virtues even if they exert much to awaken theKundalini through Yogic exercises.Aspirants should freely open their hearts to their Guru. They must be frank and candid.They should give up the self-assertive, Rajasic vehemence, vanity and arrogance, and carry outtheir master’s instructions with Sraddha and Prem. Constant self-justification is a dangerous habitfor a Sadhaka.Energy is wasted in too much talking, unnecessary worry and vain fear. Gossiping andtall-talk should be given up entirely. A real Sadhaka is a man of few words, to the point and that tooon spiritual matters only. Sadhakas should always remain alone. Mouna is a greatdesideratum.Mixing with householders is highly dangerous for a Sadhaka. The company of a householder is farmore injurious than the company of a woman. Mind has the power to imitate.YOGIC DIETA Sadhaka should observe perfect discipline. He must be civil, polite, courteous, gentle,noble and gracious in his behaviour. He must have perseverance, adamantine will, asinine patienceandleech-like tenacityin Sadhana. He must be perfectly self-controlled, pure and devoted to theGuru.A glutton or one who is a slave of his senses with several bad habits, is unfit for the spiritualpath.“Mitaharam vina yastu yogarambham tu karayet; Nanarogo bhavettasya kinchit yogo nasiddhyati“Without observing moderation of diet, if one takes to the Yogic practices, he cannot obtainany benefit but gets various diseases” (Ghe. Sam. V-16).Food plays a prominent place in Yoga-Sadhana. An aspirant should be very careful in theselection of articles of Sattvic nature especially in the beginning of his Sadhana period. Later onwhen Siddhi is attained, drastic dietetic restrictions can be removed.Purity of food leads to purity of mind. Sattvic food helps meditation. The discipline of foodis very very necessary for Yogic Sadhana. If the tongue is controlled, all the other Indriyas arecontrolled.“Ahara-suddhausattva-suddhih,sattva-suddhaudhruvasmritih;Smriti-lambhesarva-granthinam viprarnokshah—By the purity of food follows the purification of the inner5PRELIMINARY"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"nature, by the purification of the nature, memory becomes firm and on strengthening the memory,follows the loosening of all ties and the wise get Moksha thereby.”SATTVIC ARTICLESI will give you a list of Sattvic articles for a Sadhaka. Milk, red rice, barley, wheat,Havishannam, Charu,cream, cheese, butter, green dal (Moong dal), Badam (almonds),Misri(sugar-candy),Kismis(raisins),Kichidi, Pancha Shakhavegetables(Seendil, Chakravarty,Ponnan-gani, ChirukeeraiandVellaicharnai),Lowkivegetable, plantain-stem,Parwal, Bhindi(lady’s finger), pomegranates, sweet oranges, grapes, apples, bananas, mangoes, dates, honey,dried ginger, black pepper, etc., are the Sattvic articles of diet prescribed for the Yoga Abhyasis.Charu: Boil half a seer of milk along with some boiled rice, ghee and sugar. This is anexcellent food for Yogins. This is for the day-time. For the night, half a seer of milk will do.Milk should not be too much boiled. It should be removed from the fire as soon as theboiling point is reached. Too much boiling destroys the nutritious principles and vitamins andrenders it quite useless. This is an ideal food for Sadhakas. Milk is a perfect food by itself.A fruit diet exercises a benign influence on the constitution. This is a natural form of diet.Fruits are very great energy-producers. Fruits and milk diet help concentration and easy mentalfocussing. Barley, wheat, milk and ghee promote longevity and increase power and strength.Fruit-juice and the water wherein sugar-candy is dissolved, are very good beverages. Butter mixedwith sugar-candy, and almonds soaked in water can be taken. These will cool the system.FORBIDDEN ARTICLESSour, hot, pungent and bitter preparations, salt, mustard, asafoetida, chillies, tamarind, sourcurd, chutnee, meat, eggs, fish, garlic, onions, alcoholic liquors, acidic things, stale food, overripeor unripe fruits, and other articles that disagree with your system should be avoided entirely.Rajasic food distracts the mind. It excites passion. Give up salt. It excites passion andemotion. Giving up of salt helps in controlling the tongue and thereby the mind and in developingwill-power also. Snake-bite and scorpion-stings will have no influence on a man who has given upsalt. Onions and garlic are worse than meat.Live a natural life. Take simple food that is agreeable. You should have your own menu tosuit your constitution. You are yourself the best judge to select a Sattvic diet.The proficient in Yoga should abandon articles of food detrimental to the practice of Yoga.During intense Sadhana, milk (and ghee also) is ordained.I have given above several articles of Sattvic nature. That does not mean that you shouldtake all. You will have to select a few things that are easily available and suitable to you. Milk is thebest food for Yogins. But even a small quantity of milk is harmful for some and may not agree with6KUNDALINI YOGA"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"all constitutions. If one form of diet is not suitable or if you feel constipated, change the diet and trysome other Sattvic articles. This is Yukti.In the matter of food and drinks you should be a master. You should not have the leastcraving or sense-hankering for any particular food. You must not become a slave to any particularobject.MITAHARAHeavy food leads to Tamasic state and induces sleep only. There is a generalmisapprehension that a large quantity of food is necessary for health and strength. Much dependsupon the power of assimilation and absorption. Generally, in the vast majority of cases, most of thefood passes away undigested along with faeces. Take half stomachful of wholesome food. Fill aquarter with pure water. Leave the rest free. This is Mitahara. Mitahara plays a vital part in keepingup perfect health. Almost all diseases are due to irregularity of meals, overeating and unwholesomefood. Eating all things at all times like a monkey is highly dangerous. Such a man can become aRogi (sick man) easily; but he can never become a Yogi. Hear the emphatic declaration of LordKrishna: “Success in Yoga is not for him who eats too much or too little; nor for him who sleeps toomuch or too little (Gita VI-16). Again in the Sloka 18 of the same chapter, He says: “To him who istemperate in eating and in sleep and wakefulness, Yoga becomes a destroyer of misery.”A glutton cannot at the very outset have diet regulations and observe Mitahara. He mustgradually practise this. First let him take less quantity twice as usual. Then instead of the usualheavy night meals, let him take fruits and milk alone for some days. In due course of time he cancompletely avoid the night meals and try to take fruits and milk in the daytime. Those who dointense Sadhana must take milk alone. It is a perfect food by itself. If necessary they can take someeasily digestible fruits. A glutton, if he all on a sudden takes to fruit or milk diet, will desire at everymoment to eat something or other. That is bad. Once again I reiterate, gradual practice is necessary.Do not fast much. It will produce weakness in you. Occasional fasting once a month orwhen passion troubles you much, will suffice. During fasting you should not even think of thevarious articles of food. Constant thinking of the food when you fast cannot bring you the desiredresult. During fasting, avoid company. Live alone. Utilise your time in Yogic Sadhana. After a fastdo not take any heavy food. Milk or some fruit-juice is beneficial.Do not make much fuss about your diet. You need not advertise to everyone if you are ableto pull on with a particular form of diet. The observance of such Niyamas is for your advancementin the spiritual path and you will not be spiritually benefited by giving publicity to your Sadhana.There are many nowadays who make it a profession to earn money and their livelihood byperforming some Asana, Pranayama or by having some diet regulation such as eating only rawarticles or leaves or roots. They cannot have any spiritual growth. The goal of life is Self-realisation.Sadhakas should keep the goal always in view and do intense Sadhana with the prescribed methods.7PRELIMINARY"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"THE PLACE FOR YOGA SADHANASadhana should be done in a secluded place. There should be no interruption by anyone.When you live in a house, a well-ventilated room should be reserved for Sadhana purposes. Do notallow anybody to enter the room. Keep it under lock and key. Do not allow even your wife, childrenor intimate friends to enter the room. It should be kept pure and holy. It should be free frommosquitoes, flies and lice and absolutely free from dampness. Do not keep too many things in theroom. They will distract you every now and then. No surrounding noise also should disturb you.The room should not be too big as the eyes will begin to wander.Places of cool or temperate climate are required for Yoga Abhyasa as you will get easilyexhausted in hot place. You must select such a place where you can comfortably stay all through theyear in winter, summer and rainy season. You must stick to one place throughout Sadhana period.Select a beautiful and pleasant spot where there is no disturbance, on the banks of a river, lake or seaor top of a hill where there is a nice spring and grove of trees and where milk and articles of food areeasily procurable. You should select such a place where there are some other Yogic practitioners.When you see others who are devoted to Yogic practices you will diligently apply yourself to yourpractices. You can consult them in times of difficulties. Do not wander here and there in search of aplace where you will get all conveniences. Do not change your place very often when you find someinconvenience. You must put up with it. Every place has some advantage and disadvantage. Findout a place where you have many advantages and a few disadvantages.The following places are best suited. They are admirably adapted. Scenery is charming andspiritual vibrations are marvellous and elevating. There are several Kutirs (huts) to live in for realAbhyasis, or you can construct your own hut. Milk and other rations are available in all the placesfrom the neighbouring villages. Any solitary village on the banks of Ganga, Narmada, Yamuna,Godavari, Krishna and Kaveri is suitable. I will tell you some important places for meditation.Kulu Valley, Champa Valley and Srinagar in Kashmir; Banrughi Guha near Tehri;Brahmavarta near Kanpur; Joshi (Prayag) in Allahabad; Canary Caves near Bombay; Mussoorie;Mt. Abu; Nainital; Brindavan; Banares; Puri; Uttara Brindavan (14 miles from Almora); Hardwar,Rishikesh (N.Rly.); Lakshmanjhula (*3), Brahmapuri Forest (*4), Ram Guha in BrahmapuriForest, Garuda Chatty (*4), Neelkant (*8), Vasishtha Guha (*14), Uttarkashi; Deva Prayag;Badrinarayan; Gangotri, Nasik and Nandi Hills in Mysore. (* Distance in miles from Rishikesh)If you build a Kutir in a crowded place, people out of curiosity will disturb you. You willhave no spiritual vibrations there. There will be a lot of other disturbances also. Again you will bewithout any protection if you construct your Kutir in a thick forest. Thieves and wild animals willtrouble you. The question of food will arise. You must consider all these points well before youselect a place for your Sadhana. If you cannot go in for such places, convert a solitary room into aforest.Your Asana (seat) for the Yogic practices should not be too high or too low. Spread a seat ofKushagrass, tiger-skin or deer-skin and then sit. Burn incense daily in the room. In the initial periodof your Sadhana you must be very particular about all these. When you have sufficiently advancedin your practice, then you need not lay much stress on such rules.8KUNDALINI YOGA"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"THE TIMEIt is stated in Gheranda Samhita that Yogic practices should not be commenced in winter,summer and rainy seasons, but only in spring and autumn. This depends upon the temperature of theparticular place and the strength of the individual. Generally cool hours are best suited. In hot placesyou should not practise during the day. Early morning hours are suitable for Yogic practices. Youshould completely avoid Yoga Abhyasa in summer in those places where the temperature is hoteven in winter. If you live in cool places like Kodaikanal, Ooty, Kashmir, Badrinarayan, Gangotri,etc., you can practise even during the day.As instructed in the previous lessons you should not practise when the stomach is loaded.Generally Yogic practices should be done only after a bath. A bath is not beneficial immediatelyafter the practices. You should not sit for Yogic practices when your mind is restless or when youare worried much.THE AGEYoung boys under 18 years of age whose bodies are very tender should not have too muchpractice. They have a very tender body which cannot stand the exertion of Yogic exercises. Further,a youth’s mind will be wandering and unsettled and so, in youth one cannot concentrate well,whereas, Yogic exercises require intense and deep concentration. In old age when all vitality issapped by unnecessary worry, anxieties, troubles and other worldly Vyavaharas, one cannot do anyspiritual practice. Yoga requires full vitality, energy, power and strength. Therefore the best periodfor Yoga Abhyasa is from 20 to 40 years of age. Those who are strong and healthy can take to Yogicpractices even after 50.NECESSITY FOR A YOGIC GURUIn olden days the aspirants were required to live with the Guru for a number of years, so thatthe Guru could study the students thoroughly. The food during practice, what to practise and how,whether the students are qualified for the path of Yoga, and the temperament of the aspirants andother important items have to be considered and judged by the Guru. It is the Guru that shoulddecide whether the aspirants are of Uttamai, Madhyama or Adhama type and fix different kinds ofexercises. Sadhana differs according to the nature, capacity and qualifications of the aspirants.After understanding the theory of Yoga, you will have to learn the practice from an experiencedYogic Guru. So long as there is the world, there are books on Yoga and teachers also. You will haveto search for them with Sraddha, faith, devotion and earnestness. You can get easy lessons from theGuru and practise them at home also in the initial stages of practice. When you advance a bit, foradvanced and difficult exercises you will have to stay with the Guru. The personal contact with theGuru has manifold advantages. You will be highly benefited by the spiritual magnetic aura of yourGuru. For the practice of Bhakti Yoga and Vedanta you do not require a Guru by your side. Afterlearning the Srutis for sometime from a Guru, you will have to reflect and meditate alone, in entireseclusion, whereas in Kundalini Yoga you will have to break up the Granthis and take the Kundalinifrom Chakra to Chakra. These are all difficult processes. The method of uniting the Apana andPrana and sending it along the Sushumna and breaking the Granthis need the help of a Guru.

You will have to understand thoroughly thelocation of the Nadis, Chakras and the detailed technique of the several Yogic Kriyas.Lay bare to your Guru the secrets of your heart and the more you do so, the greater thesympathy and help you get from your Guru. This sympathy means accession of strength to you inthe straggle against sin and temptation.“Learn thou this by discipleship, by investigation and by service. The wise, the seers of theEssence of things will instruct thee in wisdom”. (Gita-IV-34)Some do meditation for some years independently. Later on they feel actually the necessityfor a Guru. They come across some obstacles in the way. They do not know how to proceed furtherand to obviate these impediments or stumbling blocks. Then they begin to search for a master. Astranger in a big city finds it difficult to go back to his residence in a small avenue though he haswalked in the way half a dozen times. When difficulty arises even in the case of finding out the waythrough streets and roads how much more difficult it should be in the path of spirituality when onewalks alone with closed eyes!The aspirant gets obstacles or impediments, dangers, snares and pitfalls on the spiritualpath. He may commit errors in Sadhana also. A Guru who has already trodden the path and reachedthe goal, is very necessary to guide him.WHO IS A GURU?Guru is one who has full Self-illumination and who removes the veil of ignorance indeluded Jivas. Guru, Truth, Brahman, Ishvara, Atman, God, Om are all one. The number of realisedsouls may be less in this Kali Yuga when compared with the Satya Yuga, but they are alwayspresent to help the aspirants. They are always searching for the proper Adhikarins.Guru is Brahman Himself. Guru is Ishvara Himself. Guru is God. A word from him is aword from God. He need not teach any. Even his mere presence or company is elevating, inspiringand soul-stirring. The very company itself is self-illumination. Living in his company is spiritualeducation. That which comes out of his lips is all Vedas or gospel-truth. His very life is anembodiment of Vedas. Guru is your guide or spiritual preceptor, real father, mother, brother,relative and intimate friend. He is an embodiment of mercy and love. His tender smile radiates light,bliss, joy, knowledge and peace. He is a blessing to the suffering humanity. Whatever he talks isUpanishadic teaching. He knows the spiritual path. He knows the pitfalls and snares on the way. Hegives warning to the aspirants. He removes obstacles on the path. He imparts spiritual strength tothe students. He showers his grace on their heads. He takes their Prarabdha even on his head. He isthe ocean of mercy. All agonies, miseries, tribulations, taints of worldliness, etc., vanish in hispresence.It is he who transmutes the little Jivahood into great Brahmanhood. It is he who overhaulsthe old, wrong, vicious Samskaras of the aspirants and awakens them to the attainment of theknowledge of Self. It is he who uplifts the Jivas from the quagmire of body and Samsara, removes10KUNDALINI YOGA"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"the veil of Avidya, all doubts, Moha and fear, awakens Kundalini and opens the inner eye ofintuition.The Guru must not only be a Srotriya but a Brahma-Nishtha also. Mere study of bookscannot make one a Guru. One who has studied Vedas and who has direct knowledge of Atmanthrough Anubhava can only be considered a Guru. If you can find peace in the presence of aMahatma, and if your doubts are removed by his very presence you can take him as your Guru.A Guru can awaken the Kundalini of an aspirant through sight, touch, speech or mereSankalpa (thought). He can transmit spirituality to the student just as one gives an orange-fruit toanother. When the Guru gives Mantra to his disciples, he gives it with his own power and SattvicBhava.The Guru tests the students in various ways. Some students misunderstand him and losetheir faith in him. Hence, they are not benefited. Those who stand the tests boldly come outsuccessful in the end. The periodical examinations in the Adhyatmic University of Sages are verystiff indeed. In days of yore the tests were very severe. Once Gorakhnath asked some of his studentsto climb up a tall tree and throw themselves head downwards on a very sharp Trident (Trishul).Many faithless students kept quiet. But one faithful student at once climbed up the tree withlightning speed and threw himself down. He was protected by the invisible hand of Gorakhnath. Hehad immediate Self-realisation. He had no Deha-adhyasa (attachment for his body). The otherfaithless students had strong Moha and Ajnana.There is a good deal of heated debates and controversy amongst many people on the matterof the necessity of a Guru. Some of them assert with vehemence and force that a preceptor is not atall necessary for Self-realisation and spiritual advancement and that one can have spiritual progressand self-illumination through one’s own efforts only. They quote various passages from scripturesand assign arguments and reasonings to support them. Others boldly assert with greater emphasisand force that no spiritual progress is possible for a man, however intelligent he may be, howeverhard he may attempt and struggle in the spiritual path, unless he gets the benign grace and directguidance of a spiritual preceptor.Now open your eyes and watch carefully what is going on in this world in all walks of life.Even a cook needs a teacher. He serves under a senior cook for some years. He obeys himimplicitly. He pleases his teacher in all possible ways. He learns all the techniques in cooking. Hegets knowledge through the grace of his senior cook, his teacher. A junior lawyer wants the help andguidance of a senior advocate. Students of mathematics and medicine need the help and guidance ofa Professor. A student of Science, music and astronomy wants the guidance of a scientist andmusician and an astronomer. When such is the case with ordinary, secular knowledge, then, what tospeak of the inner spiritual path, wherein the student has to walk alone with closed eyes? When youare in a thick jungle, you come across several cross foot-paths. You are in a dilemma. You do notknow the directions and by which path you should go. You are bewildered. You want a guide hereto direct you in the right path. It is universally admitted that an efficient teacher is needed in allbranches of knowledge in this physical plane and that physical, mental, moral and cultural growthcan only be had through the help and guidance of a capable master. This is a universal inexorable11PRELIMINARY"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"law of nature. Why do you deny them, friend, the application of this universally accepted law in therealm of spirituality?Spiritual knowledge is a matter of Guruparampara. It is handed down from a Guru to hisdisciple. Study Brihadaranyaka Upanishad.

It was Gorakhnath whoshaped the spiritual destiny of Raja Bhartrihari. It was Lord Krishna who made Arjuna andUddhava establish themselves in the spiritual path, when their minds were in an unsettledcondition.Some aspirants do meditation for some years independently. Later on they feel actually thenecessity for a Guru. They come across some obstacles in the way. They do not know how toproceed further and how to obviate these impediments or stumbling blocks. Then they begin tosearch for a Guru.The student and the teacher should live together as father and devoted son or as a husbandand wife with extreme sincerity and devotion. The aspirant should have an eager, receptive attitudeto imbibe the teachings of the master. Then only will the aspirant be spiritually benefited;otherwise, there is not the least hope of the spiritual life of the aspirant and complete regeneration ofhis old Asuric nature.It is a great pity that the present system of education in India is not favourable to the spiritualgrowth of Sadhakas. The minds of the students are saturated with materialistic poison. Aspirants ofthe present day have not got any idea of the true relationship of Guru and a disciple. It is not like therelationship of a student and teacher or professor in schools and colleges. Spiritual relationship isentirely different. It involves dedication. It is very sacred. It is purely divine. Turn the pages of theUpanishads. In days of yore, Brahmacharins used to approach their teachers with profoundhumility, sincerity and Bhava.SPIRITUAL POWERJust as you can give an orange to a man and take it back, so also spiritual power can betransmitted by one to another and taken back also. This method of transmitting spiritual power istermed “Shakti Sanchara.”Birds keep their eggs under their wings. Through heat the eggs are hatched. Fish lay theireggs and look at them. They are hatched. The tortoise lays its eggs and thinks of them. They arehatched. Even so the spiritual power is transmitted by the Guru to the disciple through touch(Sparsha) like birds, sight (Darshana) like fish, and thinking or willing (Sankalpa) like the tortoise.The transmitter, the Yogi-Guru, sometimes enters the astral body of the student and elevateshis mind through his power. The Yogi (operator) makes the subject (Chela) sit in front of him and12KUNDALINI YOGA"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"asks him to close his eyes and then transmits his spiritual power. The subject feels the spiritualpower actually passing from Muladhara Chakra higher up to the neck and top of the head.The disciple does various Hatha Yogic Kriyas, Asanas, Pranayamas, Bandhas, Mudras,etc., by himself. The student must not restrain hisIccha-Sakti.He must act according to the innerPrerana (inner goading or stirring). The mind is highly elevated. The moment the aspirant closes hiseyes, meditation comes by itself. Through Sakti-Sanchara Kundalini is awakened by the grace ofthe Guru in the disciple. Sakti Sanchara comes through Parampara. It is a hidden mystic science. Itis handed down from the Guru to the disciple.The disciple should not rest satisfied with the transmission of power from the Guru. He willhave to struggle hard in Sadhana for further perfection and attainments.Sakti Sanchara is of two kinds, viz., lower and higher. The lower one is Jada Kriya onlywherein one automatically does Asanas, Bandhas and Mudras without any instructions when theGuru imparts the power to the student. The student will have to take up Sravana, Manana andNididhyasana for perfection. He cannot depend upon the Kriya alone. This Kriya is only anauxiliary. It gives a push to the Sadhaka. A fully-developed Yogi only possesses the higher kind ofShakti-Sanchara.Lord Jesus, through touch, transmitted his spiritual power to some of his disciples (Master’sTouch). Samartha Ramdas touched a prostitute. She entered into Samadhi. Sri RamakrishnaParamahamsa touched Swami Vivekananda. Swami Vivekananda had superconsciousexperiences. He struggled hard for seven years more even after the touch for attaining perfection.Lord Krishna touched the blind eyes of Vilvamangal (Surdas). The inner eye of Surdas was opened.He had Bhava Samadhi. Lord Gouranga, through his touch, produced Divine intoxication in manypeople and converted them to his side. Even atheists danced in ecstasy in the streets by his touch andsang songs of Hari. Glory, glory to such exalted Yogic Gurus.13PRELIMINARY"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Chapter TwoKUNDALINI YOGA—THEORYYOGA NADISNadis are the astral tubes made up of astral matter that carry psychic currents. The Sanskritterm ‘Nadi’ comes from the root ‘Nad’ which means ‘motion’. It is through these Nadis (Sukshma,subtle passages), that the vital force or Pranic current moves or flows. Since they are made up ofsubtle matter they cannot be seen by the naked physical eyes and you cannot make any test-tubeexperiments in the physical plane. These Yoga Nadis are not the ordinary nerves, arteries and veinsthat are known to the Vaidya Shastra (Anatomy and Physiology). Yoga Nadis are quite differentfrom these.The body is filled with innumerable Nadis that cannot be counted. Different authors statethe number of Nadis in different ways, i.e., from 72,000 to 3,50,000. When you turn your attentionto the internal structure of the body, you are struck with awe and wonder. Because the architect isthe Divine Lord Himself who is assisted by skilled engineers and masons—Maya, Prakriti, VisvaKarma, etc.Nadis play a vital part in this Yoga. Kundalini when awakened, will pass through SushumnaNadi and this is possible only when the Nadis are pure. Therefore, the first step in Kundalini Yoga isthe purification of Nadis. A detailed knowledge of the Nadis and Chakras, is absolutely essential.Their location, functions, nature, etc., should be thoroughly studied.The subtle lines, Yoga Nadis, have influence in the physical body. All the subtle (Sukshma)Prana, Nadis and Chakras have gross manifestation and operation in the physical body. The grossnerves and plexuses have close relationship with the subtle ones. You should understand this pointwell. Since the physical centres have close relationship with the astral centres, the vibrations thatare produced in the physical centres by prescribed methods, have the desired effects in the astralcentres.Whenever there is an interlacing of several nerves, arteries and veins, that centre is called“Plexus.” The physical material plexuses that are known to the Vaidya Shastra are:— Pampiniform,Cervical, Brachial, Coccygeal, Lumbar, Sacral, Cardiac, Esophageal, Hepatic Pharyngeal,Pulmonary, Ligual Prostatic Plexus, etc. Similarly there are plexuses or centres of vital forces in theSukshma Nadis. They are known as ‘Padma’ (lotus) orChakras. Detailed instructions on all thesecentres are given elsewhere.All the Nadis spring from the Kanda. It is in the junction where the Sushumna Nadi isconnected with the Muladhara Chakra. Some say, that this Kanda is 12 inches above the anus. Outof the innumerable Nadis 14 are said to be important. They are:—14KUNDALINI YOGA"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"1. Sushumna2. Ida3. Pingala4. Gandhari5. Hastajihva6. Kuhu7. Saraswati8. Pusha9. Sankhini10. Payasvini11. Varuni12. Alambusha13.

Other Nadis are subordinateto this. Detailed instructions on each Nadi and its functions and the method of awakening theKundalini and passing it from Chakra to Chakra are given in the following pages.SPINAL COLUMNBefore proceeding to the study of Nadis and Chakras you will have to know somethingabout the Spinal Column, as all the Chakras are connected with it.Spinal ColumnA—Atlas bone; A to B—Cervical region; B to C—Dorsal region; C toD—Lumbar region; D to E—Sacral region; E to the end—Coccygealregion.15KUNDALINI YOGA—THEORY"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Spinal Column is known as Meru Danda. This is the axis of the body just as Mount Meru isthe axis of the earth. Hence the spine is called ‘Meru’. Spinal column is otherwise known as spine,axis-staff or vertebral column. Man is microcosm. (Pinda - Kshudra-Brahmanda). All things seenin the universe,—mountains, rivers, Bhutas, etc., exist in the body also. All the Tattvas and Lokas(worlds) are within the body.The body may be divided into three main parts:—head, trunk and the limbs, and the centreof the body is between the head and the legs. The spinal column extends from the first vertebra,Atlas bone, to the end of the trunk.The spine is formed of a series of 33 bones called vertebrae; according to the position theseoccupy, it is divided into five regions:—1. Cervical region (neck) 7 vertebrae2. Dorsal region (back) 12 vertebrae3. Lumbar region (waist or loins) 5 vertebrae.4. Sacral region (buttocks, Sacrum or gluteal) 5 vertebrae.5. Coccygeal region (imperfect vertebrae Coccyx) 4 vertebrae.VertebraeThe vertebral bones are piled one upon the other thus forming a pillar for the support of thecranium and trunk. They are connected together by spinous, transverse and articular processes andby pads of fibro-cartilage between the bones. The arches of the vertebrae form a hollow cylinder ora bony covering or a passage for the spinal cord. The size of the vertebrae differs from each other.For example, the size of the vertebrae in cervical region is smaller than in dorsal but the arches arebigger. The body of the lumbar vertebrae is the largest and biggest. The whole spine is not like astiff rod, but has curvatures that give a spring action. All the other bones of the body are connectedwith this spine.Between each pair of vertebrae there are apertures through which the spinal nerves passfrom the spinal cord to the different portions and organs of the body. The five regions of the spinecorrespond with the regions of the five Chakras: Muladhara, Svadhishthana, Manipura, Anahataand Vishuddha. Sushumna Nadi passes through the hollow cylindrical cavity of the vertebralcolumn and Ida is on the left side and Pingala on the right side of the spine.16KUNDALINI YOGA"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"SUKSHMA SARIRAThe physical body is shaped in accordance with the nature of the astral body. The physicalbody is something like water, Sthula form. When water is heated, the steam or vapour correspondsto the astral body. In the same way the astral or Sukshma body is within the gross or physical body.The gross body cannot do anything without the astral body. Every gross centre of the body has itsastral centre. A clear knowledge of the gross body is of utmost importance as this Yoga deals withthe centre of the astral body. In subsequent chapters you will find, therefore, a short description ofthe centres of the gross body and their corresponding centres in the Sukshma Sarira. You will findthe descriptions of the astral centres and their connected functions in the physical body.KANDAThis is situated between the anus and the root of the reproductory organ. It is like the shapeof an egg and is covered with membranes. This is just above the Muladhara Chakra. All the Nadis ofthe body spring from this Kanda. It is in the junction where Sushumna is connected with MuladharaChakra. The four petals of the Muladhara Chakra are on the sides of this Kanda and the junction iscalled Granthi-Sthana, where the influence of Maya is very strong. In some Upanishads you willfind that Kanda is 9 digits above the genitals.Kanda is a centre of the astral body from where Yoga Nadis, subtle channels, spring andcarry the Sukshma Prana (vital energy) to the different parts of the body. Corresponding to thiscentre, you have ‘Cauda equina’ in the gross physical body. The spinal cord extending from thebrain to the end of the vertebral column tapers off into a fine silken thread. Before its termination itgives off innumerable fibres, crowded into a bunch of nerves. This bunch of nerves is ‘Caudaequina’ in the gross body. The astral centre of ‘Cauda equina’ is Kanda.SPINAL CORDThe central nervous system consists of the brain and the spinal cord, the cerebro-spinalcentre or axis. The continuation of theMedulla oblongataor theBulbis a connecting mediumbetween the brain and the spinal cord. The centre in theMedulla oblongatais closely connectedwith the involuntary functions of breathing and swallowing. The spinal cord extends from the top ofthe spinal canal to the second vertebra of the coccygeal region where it tapers off into a fine silkenthread, calledFilum terminale.The spinal cord is a column of very soft grey and white brain-matter. The white matter isarranged on the sides of the grey matter. The white matter is of medullated nerves while the grey isof nerve-cells and fibres. This is not tightly fitted with the spinal canal, but suspended or dropped, asit were, into the spinal canal just like the brain in the cranial cavity. This is nourished by themembranes. Spinal cord and brain float in the cerebro-spinal fluid. The fluid prevents, therefore,any injury done to them. Further the spinal cord is protected by a covering of fatty tissue. It isdivided into two symmetrical halves by an anterior and posterior fissure. In the centre there is aminute canal, calledcanalis centralis.Brahmanadi runs along this canal from the Muladhara toSahasrara Chakra. It is through this Nadi, Kundalini, when awakened, passes to Brahmarandhra.17KUNDALINI YOGA—THEORY"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"The spinal cord is not divided or separated from the brain. It is continuous with the brain. Allthe cranial and spinal nerves are connected with this cord. Every nerve of the body is connectedwith this. The organs of reproduction, micturition, digestion, blood-circulation, respiration are allcontrolled by this spinal cord. Spinal cord opens out into the fourth ventricle of the brain in themedulla oblongata. From the fourth ventricle it runs along the third, then the fifth ventricle of thebrain and finally it reaches the crown of the head, Sahasrara Chakra.Spinal Cord18KUNDALINI YOGA"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"SUSHUMNA NADIWhen we study the construction, location and function of the Spinal Cord and theSushumna Nadi, we can readily say that the Spinal Cord was called Sushumna Nadi by the Yoginsof yore. The Western Anatomy deals with the gross form and functions of the Spinal Cord, whilethe Yogins of ancient times dealt with all about the subtle (Sukshma) nature. Now in KundaliniYoga, you should have a thorough knowledge of this Nadi.Sushumna extends from the Muladhara Chakra (second vertebra of coccygeal region) toBrahmarandhra. The Western Anatomy admits that there is a central canal in the Spinal Cord,calledCanalis Centralisand that the cord is made up of grey and white brain-matter. Spinal Cord isdropped or suspended in the hollow of the spinal column. In the same way, Sushumna is droppedwithin the spinal canal and has subtle sections. It is of red colour like Agni (fire).Within this Sushumna there is a Nadi by name Vajra which is lustrous as Surya (sun) withRajasic qualities. Again within this Vajra Nadi, there is another Nadi, called Chitra. It is of Sattvicnature and of pale colour. The qualities of Agni, Surya and Chandra (fire, sun and moon) are thethree aspects of Sabda Brahman. Here within this Chitra, there is a very fine minute canal (which isknown asCanalis Centralis). This canal is known as Brahmanadi through which Kundalini, whenawakened, passes from Muladhara to Sahasrara Chakra. In this centre exist all the sixChakras(lotuses, viz., Muladhara, Svadhishthana, Manipura, Anahata, Vishuddha and Ajna).The lower extremity of the Chitra Nadi is called Brahmadvara, the door of Brahman, asKundalini has to pass through this door to Brahmarandhra. This corresponds to Haridwar which isthe gate of Hari of Badrinarayan in the macrocosm (physical plane). The Chitra terminates in theCerebellum.In a general sense the Sushumna Nadi itself (gross Spinal Cord) is called Brahma Nadibecause, Brahma Nadi is within the Sushumna. Again the canal within the Chitra is also calledSushumna, because the canal is within the Sushumna. Ida and Pingala Nadis are on the left and rightsides of the spine.Chitra is the highest and most beloved of the Yogins. It is like a thin thread of lotus. Brilliantwith five colours, it is in the centre of Sushumna. It is the most vital part of the body. This is calledthe Heavenly way. It is the giver of Immortality. By contemplating on the Chakras that exist in thisNadi, the Yogi destroys all sins and attains the Highest Bliss. It is the giver of Moksha.When the breath flows through Sushumna, the mind becomes steady. This steadiness of themind is termed “Unmani Avastha”, the highest state of Yoga. If you sit for meditation whenSushumna is operating, you will have wonderful meditation. When the Nadis are full of impurities,the breath cannot pass into the middle Nadi. So one should practise Pranayama for the purificationof Nadis.19KUNDALINI YOGA—THEORY"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"PARA-SYMPATHETIC AND SYMPATHETIC SYSTEMOn either side of the spinal cord run the sympathetic and para-sympathetic cords, a doublechain of ganglia. Ganglia means a collection of nerve-cells. These constitute the Autonomic Systemwhich supplies nerves to the involuntary organs, such as heart, lungs, intestines, kidneys, liver, etc.,and controls them.Vagusnerve which plays a vital part in human economy comes out of thissympathetic system. Sympathetic system stimulates or accelerates. Para-sympathetic systemretards or inhibits. There are nerves to dilate or expand the arteries which carry pure oxygenatedblood to nourish the tissues, organs and cells of different parts of the body. These are calledVaso-dilators.The left and the right sympathetic chains are connected by filaments. These crossfrom the right to the left side andvice versa, but the exact places where these crosses are not known,though several have attempted to find. M’Kendrick and Snodgrass in theirPhysiology of the Senseswrite: “Where the sensory fibres cross from one side to the other is not known ..... In some parts ofthe spinal cord the sensory fibres do cross from the right to left side andvice versa.”IDA AND PINGALA NADISIda and Pingala Nadis are not the gross sympathetic chains. These are the subtle Nadis thatcarry the Sukshma Prana. In the physical body these tentatively correspond to the right and leftsympathetic chains.Ida starts from the right testicle and Pingala from the left testicle. They meet with SushumnaNadi at the Muladhara Chakra and make a knot there. This junction of three Nadis at the MuladharaChakra is known as Mukta Triveni. Ganga, Yamuna and Sarasvati dwell in Pingala, Ida andSushumna Nadis respectively. This meeting place is called Brahma Granthi. Again these meet atthe Anahata and Ajna Chakra. In the macrocosm also you have a Triveni at Prayag where the threerivers Ganga, Yamuna and Sarasvati meet.Ida flows through the left nostril and Pingala through the right nostril. Ida is also calledChandra Nadi (moon) and Pingala as Surya Nadi (sun). Ida is cooling and Pingala is heating.Pingala digests the food. Ida is of pale, Sakti Rupa. It is the great nourisher of the world. Pingala isof fiery red, Rudra Rupa. Ida and Pingala indicate Kala (time) and Sushumna swallows time. TheYogi knows the time of his death; takes his Prana into Sushumna; keeps it in Brahmarandra, anddefies time (Kala—death). The famous Yogi Sri Chang Dev of Maharashtra fought against deathseveral times by taking the Prana into Sushumna. He was a contemporary of Sri Jnanadev ofAlandi, near Poona.

Perform calm acts during the flow of Ida and harsh acts during theflow of Pingala. Do acts resulting in the attainment of psychic powers, Yoga, meditation, etc.,during the flow of the Sushumna. If the breath rises by Ida (moon) at sunrise and flows throughoutthe day, and Pingala (sun) rises at sunset and flows throughout the night it confers considerablegood results.Let the breath flow through Ida the whole day and through Pingala the whole night.He who practises thus is verily a great Yogi.HOW TO CHANGE THE FLOW IN NADISThe following exercises are for changing the flow from Ida to Pingala. Select any one of themethods that suits you best. For changing the flow from Pingala to Ida, just do the same exercise onthe opposite side:1. Plug the left nostril with a small piece of cotton or fine cloth for a few minutes.2. Lie down on the left side for ten minutes.3. Sit erect. Draw the left knee up and keep the left heel near the left buttock. Now press theleft arm-pit,Axilla, on the knee. In a few seconds the flow will be through Pingala.4. Keep the two heels together near the right buttock. The right knee will be over the leftknee. Keep the left palm on the ground a foot away and let the weight of the trunk rest on the lefthand. Do not bend at the elbow. Turn the head also towards the left side. This is an effective method.Catch hold of the left ankle with the right hand.5. The flow of breath can be changed by Nauli Kriya also.6. There are some who are able to change the flow by will.7. Place theYoga DandaorHamsa Danda(a wooden stick of about 2 feet in length with arest of the shape of U at one end) at the left arm-pit and lean on it by the left side.8. The most effective and instantaneous result is produced in changing the flow throughKhechari Mudra. The Yogi turns the tongue inside and blocks the air passage by the tip of thetongue.The above exercise is intended for general regulation of breath. Many other specialexercises for the purification of Nadis and awakening Kundalini will be given in the subsequentchapters. A knowledge more secret than the science of breath, a friend more true than the science ofbreath, has never been seen or heard of. Friends are brought together by the power of breath. Wealthis obtained with comfort and reputation through the power of breath. The knowledge of the past,present and the future and all other Siddhis are acquired and a man reaches the highest state, by thepower of breath.23KUNDALINI YOGA—THEORY"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"I want you to practise every day the Svara Sadhana systematically and regularly, that is, toallow the flow of breath through the left nostril throughout the day and through the right nostrilthroughout the night. This will, doubtless, bestow on you wonderful benefits. Wrong Svara is thecause of a host of ailments. Observance of right Svara as described above leads to health and longlife. Verily, verily, I say this unto you, my dear children! Practise this. Practise this from today.Shake off your habitual sloth, indolence and inertia. Leave off your idle talk. Do somethingpractical. Before you begin the practice, pray to Lord Siva, who is the giver of this wonderfulscience by uttering Om Namah Sivaya and Sri Ganesha, the remover of all obstacles.OTHER NADISGandhari, Hastajihva, Kuhu, Sarasvati, Pusha, Sankhini, Payasvini, Varuni, Alambusha,Vishvodhara, Yasasvini, etc., are some other important Nadis. These have their origin in Kanda. Allthese Nadis are placed on the sides of Sushumna, Ida and Pingala, and proceed to different parts ofthe body to perform certain special functions. These are all subtle Nadis. Innumerable minor Nadisspring from these. As the leaf of theAsvatthatree is covered with minute fibres so also, this body ispermeated with thousands of Nadis.PADMAS OR CHAKRASChakras are in the Linga Sarira (astral body). Linga Sarira is of 17 Tattvas, viz., 5Jnanendriyas(ears, skin, eyes, tongue and nose); 5Karmendriyas(speech, hands, legs, genitals,anus); 5Pranas(Prana, Apana, Vyana, Udana, Samana); Manas (mind); andBuddhi(intellect).These have corresponding centres in the spinal cord and the nerve-plexuses in the gross body. EachChakra has control and function over a particular centre in gross body. These cannot be seen by thenaked eyes. Some foolish doctors search for the Chakras in the physical body. They cannot findthem there. Since they cannot find any Chakra in a dead body, they lose faith in Shastras and YogicKriyas.Sukshma Prana moves in the nervous system of the Linga Sarira (astral body). Sthula Pranamoves in the nervous system of the gross physical body. The two courses are intimately connected.They act and react upon each other. The Chakras are in the astral body even after the disintegrationof the physical organism to death. According to a school of thought, the Chakras are formed duringconcentration and meditation only. This is not possible. The Chakras should exist there in a subtlestate, as the gross matter is the result of the subtle matter. Without the subtle body, the gross body isimpossible. The meaning of this sentence should be taken to be that one can feel and understand theSukshma Chakras during concentration and meditation only.Wherever there is an interlacing of several nerves, arteries and veins, that centre is calledPlexuses. The physical gross plexuses that are known to the Vaidya Shastra are Hepatic, Cervical,Brachial, Coccygeal, Lumbar, Sacral, Cardiac, Epigastric, Esophageal, Pharyngeal, Plumonary,Lingual, Prostatic, etc. Similarly there are plexuses or centres of Sukshma Prana in the SushumnaNadi. All the functions of the body, nervous, digestive, circulatory, respiratory, genito-urinary andall other systems of the body are under the control of these centres in Sushumna. These are subtlecentres of vital energy. These are the centres of consciousness (Chaitanya). These subtle centres ofSushumna have their corresponding centres in the physical body. For example, Anahata Chakra24KUNDALINI YOGA"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"which is in the Sushumna Nadi has its corresponding centre in the physical body at the heart(Cardiac Plexus).The subtle centres in the Sushumna Nadi are otherwise known as Lotuses or Chakras. Aparticular Tattva preponderates at every Chakra. There is a presiding deity in each Chakra. In everyChakra a certain animal is represented. It denotes that the centre has the qualities, Tattvas or Gunasof that particular animal. There are six important Chakras: Muladhara, Svadhisthana, Manipura,Anahata, Vishuddha, and Ajna. Sahasrara is the chief Chakra. It is in the head. These 7 Chakrascorrespond to the Lokas (Bhuh, Bhuvah, Svah, Maha, Jana, Tapa, and Satya Lokas). Muladhara toVishuddha are the centres ofPancha Bhutas(five elements): earth, water, fire, air and ether.When Kundalini is awakened it passes on from Muladhara to Sahasrara through all theChakras. At every centre to which the Yogi directs the Kundalini, he experiences a special form ofAnanda (Bliss) and gains special Siddhis (psychic powers) and knowledge. He enjoys the SupremeBliss when Kundalini is taken to Sahasrara Chakra.The following are some other Chakras: Adhara (another name of Muladhara Chakra),Amrita, Ananda, Lalita, Balvana, Brahmadvara, Chandra, Dipaka, Karnamula, Gulhaha, Kuladipa,Kundali, Galabaddha, Kaladaada, Kaladhvara, Karangaka, Kalabhedan, Lalana, Mahotsaha,Manas, Talana, Mahapadma, Niradhara, Naukula, Prana, Soma, Triveni, Urdhvarandhra, Vajra,etc. Some of these names refer to the six important Chakras only. There are also many minorChakras. Some Hathayogis say, that there are 21 minor Chakras besides 13 major Chakras andsome other Hathayogis hold that there are forty-nine Chakras while the ancient Yogis taught thatthere are 144 Chakras. Talana Chakra with its twelve red petals is located near the base of the palateand Manas Chakra with its six petals closely associated with sensations, dreams and astraltravelling. Detailed instructions of each Chakra are given in the foregoing chapters.PETALS ON CHAKRASEach Chakra has a particular number of petals with a Sanskrit alphabet on each petal. Thevibration that is produced at each petal is represented by the corresponding Sanskrit letter. Everyletter denotes the Mantra of Devi Kundalini. The letters exist in the petals in a latent form. Thesecan be manifested and the vibrations of the Nadis felt during concentration.The number of petals of the lotuses varies. Muladhara, Svadhishthana, Manipura, Anahata,Vishuddha and Ajna Chakras have 4, 6, 10, 12, 16, and 2 petals respectively. All the 50 Sanskritletters are on the 50 petals. The number of petals in each Chakra is determined by the number andposition of the Yoga Nadis around the Chakra. I will make it still clear. From each Chakra aparticular number of Yoga Nadis crop up. The Chakra gives the appearance of a lotus with theNadis as its petals. The sound produced by the vibrations of the Yoga Nadis is represented by thecorresponding Sanskrit letter. The Chakras with their petals hang downwards when Kundalini is atthe Muladhara Chakra. When it is awakened, they turn towards Brahmarandhra. They always facethe side of Kundalini.25KUNDALINI YOGA—THEORY"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"MULADHARA CHAKRAMuladhara Chakra is located at the base of the spinal column.

It is a mass ofnervous tissues made up of soft grey and white matter. It occupies the whole of cranium. Cranium islike the iron safe to keep up the treasure ‘brain’. It is surrounded by three membranes orMeninges,viz.,(1)dura mater,the fibrous connective tissue by the side of the cranial bones; (2)pia mater,theconnective tissue containing a network of blood vessels, which penetrates and nourishes all theparts of the brain; and (3)arachnoid,a very fine membrane around the brain. Below thearachnoidthere is the space which contains the cerebro-spinal fluid that is intended to prevent any injury to thebrain. The brain looks as if it is floating on this liquid.THE BRAIN1. Cerebrum2. Cerebellum3. Medulla Oblongata4. Pons VaroliiThe brain can be divided into two halves, right and left hemispheres, by a centralSulcusortissue. There are several lobes or smaller portions in the brain such as the parietal and temporallobes on the sides, the occipital lobe at the posterior portion of cerebellum, etc. There are manyconvolutions orGyrein every lobe. Again, for the sake of study, we can divide the brain into foursections.31KUNDALINI YOGA—THEORY"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"1.Cerebrum: It is the anterior, oval-shaped larger part of the brain. It is situated in the upperportion of the cranial cavity. This contains the important centres of hearing, speech, sight, etc. Thepineal gland which is regarded as the seat of the soul and which plays a prominent part in Samadhiand psychic phenomena is situated here.2.Cerebellum, the little or hind brain: This is the main portion of the brain, oblong-shaped,situated just above the fourth ventricle and below and behind the brain. Here the grey matter isarranged over the white matter. It regulates the muscular co-ordination. Mind rests here duringdreams.3.Medulla Oblongata: It is the beginning place of the spinal cord at the cranial cavity,where it is oblong-shaped and wide. It is between the two hemispheres. Here the white matter isplaced over the grey matter. This contains the centres of important functions such as circulatory,respiratory, etc. This portion must be carefully protected.4.Pons Varolii: It is the bridge that lies before theMedulla Oblongata.It is made of whiteand grey fibres that come fromcerebellumandmedulla.This is the junction where cerebellum andmedulla meet.There are five ventricles of the brain. The fourth is the most important one. It is situated inMedulla Oblongata.The fourth ventricle is the name of the central canal of the spinal cord,“Canalis Centralis” when it enters the cranial cavity. Here the tiny canal becomes bigger in size.Every nerve of the body is closely connected with the brain. The 12 pairs of cranial nervesproceed from both hemispheres through the openings at the base of the skull to different parts of thebody: Olfactory; Optic; Motor Oculi; Pathetic; Trifacial; Abducens; Facial; Auditory;Glossopharyngeal; Pneumogastric, Spinal accessory; and Hypo-glossal. These are the nerves thatare connected with the eye, ear, tongue, nose, pharynx, thorax, etc. For a detailed study of thissection refer to any book on anatomy. Here I have given you portions that are connected withKundalini Yoga.BRAHMARANDHRA“Brahmarandhra” means the hole of Brahman. It is the dwelling house of the human soul.This is also known as “Dasamadvara,” the tenth opening or the tenth door. The hollow place in thecrown of the head known asanterior fontanellein the new-born child is the Brahmarandhra. This isbetween the two parietal and occipital bones. This portion is very soft in a babe. When the childgrows, it gets obliterated by the growth of the bones of the head. Brahma created the physical bodyand entered (Pravishat) the body to give illumination inside through this Brahmarandhra. In someof the Upanishads, it is stated like that. This is the most important part. It is very suitable forNirguna Dhyana (abstract meditation). When the Yogi separates himself from the physical body atthe time of death, this Brahmarandhra bursts open and Prana comes out through this opening(Kapala Moksha). “A hundred and one are the nerves of the heart. Of them one (Sushumna) hasgone out piercing the head; going up through it, one attains immortality” (Kathopanishad).32KUNDALINI YOGA"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"SAHASRARA CHAKRASahasrara Chakra is the abode of Lord Siva.

There are different opinions about the exactnumber of petals. It is quite sufficient if you know that innumerable Nadis proceed from this centre.As in the case of other Chakras, the vibrations that are made by the Yoga Nadis are represented bythe Sanskrit letters. All the 50 letters of the Sanskrit alphabet are repeated here again and again onall Yoga Nadis. This is a Sukshma centre. The corresponding centre in the physical body is in thebrain.The term “Shat-Chakras” refers only to the chief six Chakras,viz.,Muladhara,Svadhishthana, Manipura, Anahata, Vishuddha and Ajna.

It has OM as itsBija. At this centre the Yogi concentrates on the form of his Guru and obtains all knowledge. Thishas control over the 12 pairs of nerves that proceed from the brain to the different sense-organs.SUMMARY OF THE PREVIOUS LESSONSAspirants must have all the Sattvic qualities and should be quite free from impurities.Satsanga, seclusion, dietetic discipline, good manners, good character, Brahmacharya, Vairagya,etc., form the strong foundation of Yogic life. The help of a Guru, who has already trodden the path,is absolutely necessary for quick progress in the spiritual path. Places of cool, temperate climate arerequired for Yoga Abhyasa.Nadis are the Sukshma (astral) channels through which Prana (vital energy) flows todifferent parts of the body. Ida, Pingala and Sushumna are the most important of the innumerableNadis. All Nadis start from the Kanda. Kanda is located in the space between the origin of thereproductory organ and the anus. Sushumna Nadi is situated within the Spinal Column, in the spinalcanal. Within the Sushumna Nadi there is a Nadi by name Vajra. Chitra Nadi, a minute canal, whichis also called Brahmanadi, is within this Vajra Nadi. Kundalini, when awakened, passes throughChitra Nadi. These are all Sukshma centres and you cannot have any laboratory tests and test-tubeexperiments.

Thou hast become Siva’s consecrated queen to alter Thy ownblissful conscious Form in the shape of the world”.Kundalini, the serpent power or mystic fire, is the primordial energy or Sakti that liesdormant or sleeping in the Muladhara Chakra, the centre of the body. It is called the serpentine orannular power on account of serpentine form. It is an electric fiery occult power, the great pristineforce which underlies all organic and inorganic matter.Kundalini is the cosmic power in individual bodies. It is not a material force like electricity,magnetism, centripetal or centrifugal force. It is a spiritual potential Sakti or cosmic power. Inreality it has no form. The Sthula Buddhi and mind have to follow a particular form in the beginningstage. From this gross form, one can easily, understand the subtle formless Kundalini. Prana,Ahamkara, Buddhi, Indriyas, mind, five gross elements, nerves are all the products of Kundalini.It is the coiled-up, sleeping Divine Sakti that lies dormant in all beings. You have seen in theMuladhara Chakra that there is Svayambhu Linga. The head of the Linga is the space whereSushumna Nadi is attached to the Kanda. This mysterious Kundalini lies face downwards at themouth of Sushumna Nadi on the head of Svayambhu Linga. It has three and a half coils like aserpent. When it is awakened, it makes a hissing sound like that of a serpent beaten with a stick, andproceeds to the other Chakra through the Brahma Nadi, which is also called Chitra Nadi withinSushumna. Hence Kundalini is also called Bhujangini, serpent power. The three coils represent thethree Gunas of Prakriti: Sattva, Rajas and Tamas, and the half represents the Vikritis, themodification of Prakriti.Kundalini is the Goddess of speech and is praised by all. She Herself, when awakened bythe Yogin, achieves for him the illumination. It is She who gives Mukti and Jnana for She is Herselfthat. She is also called Sarasvati, as She is the form of Sabda Brahman. She is the source of allKnowledge and Bliss. She is pure consciousness itself. She is Brahman. She is Prana Sakti, theSupreme Force, the Mother of Prana, Agni, Bindu, and Nada. It is by this Sakti that the world exists.Creation, preservation and dissolution are in Her. Only by her Sakti the world is kept up. It isthrough Her Sakti on subtle Prana, Nada is produced. While you utter a continuous sound or chant34KUNDALINI YOGA"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Dirgha Pranava!(OM), you will distinctly feel that the real vibration starts from the MuladharaChakra. Through the vibration of this Nada, all the parts of the body function. She maintains theindividual soul through the subtle Prana. In every kind of Sadhana the Goddess Kundalini is theobject of worship in some form or the other.Kundalini has connection with subtle Prana. Subtle Prana has connection with the subtleNadis and Chakras. Subtle Nadis have connection with the mind. Mind has connection all throughthe body. You have heard that there is mind in every cell of the body. Prana is the working force ofthe body. It is dynamic. This static Sakti is affected by Pranayama and other Yogic practices andbecomes dynamic. These two functions, static and dynamic, are termed ‘sleeping’ and ‘awakening’of the Kundalini.Chapter ThreeYOGA SADHANAHOW TO AWAKEN THE KUNDALINIOne should become perfectly desireless and should be full of Vairagya before attempting toawaken Kundalini. It can be awakened only when a man rises aboveKama, Krodha, Lobha, Moha,Madaand other impurities. Kundalini can be awakened through rising above desires of the senses.The Yogi, who has got a pure heart and a mind free from passions and desires will be benefited byawakening Kundalini. If a man with a lot of impurities in the mind awakens the Sakti by sheer forcethrough Asanas, Pranayamas and Mudras, he will break his legs and stumble down. He will not beable to ascend the Yogic ladder. This is the chief reason for people going out of the way or gettingsome bodily infirmities. There is nothing wrong in the Yoga. People must have purity first; then athorough knowledge of the Sadhana, a proper guide, and a steady, gradual practice. WhenKundalini is awakened there are many temptations on the way, and a Sadhaka without purity willnot have the strength to resist.A thorough knowledge of the theory is as essential as the practice. Some are of opinion thattheory is not at all necessary. They bring one or two rare instances to prove that Kundalini has beenawakened even in those who do not know anything about Nadis, Chakras and Kundalini. It might bedue to the grace of a Guru or by mere chance. Everyone cannot expect this and neglect thetheoretical side. If you look at the man in whom Kundalini has been awakened through the grace ofa Guru, you will not at once begin to neglect the practical side and actually waste your time inpassing from one Guru to the other. The man who has a clear knowledge of the theory and a steadypractice, attains the desired goal quickly.Kundalini can be awakened by Pranayama, Asanas and Mudras by Hatha Yogis; byconcentration and training of the mind by Raja Yogis; by devotion and perfect self-surrender byBhaktas; by analytical will by the Jnanis; by Mantras by the Tantrikas; and by the grace of the Guru(Guru Kripa) through touch, sight or mere Sankalpa. Rousing of Kundalini and its union with Siva35KUNDALINI YOGA—THEORY"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"at the Sahasrara Chakra effect the state of Samadhi and Mukti. No Samadhi is possible withoutawakening the Kundalini.For a selected few, any one of the above methods is quite sufficient to awaken theKundalini. Many will have to combine different methods. This is according to the growth andposition of the Sadhakas in the spiritual path. The Guru will find out the real position of the Sadhakaand will prescribe a proper method that will successfully awaken the Kundalini in a short period.This is something like the doctor prescribing a proper medicine to a patient to cure a particulardisease. One kind of medicine will not cure the diseases of different patients. So also, one kind ofSadhana may not suit all.There are many persons nowadays who foolishly imagine that they have attained purity,commit errors in selecting some methods and neglect many important items of Sadhana. They arepoor, self-deluded souls. Self-assertive, Rajasic Sadhakas will select some exercises of their ownfancy in an irregular manner and leave all the exercises when they get some serious troubles.After Kundalini is awakened, Prana passes upwards through Brahma Nadi along with mindand Agni. You will have to take it up to Sahasrara Chakra through some special exercises such asMahabheda, Sakti Chalana, etc.As soon as it is awakened, it pierces the Muladhara Chakra (Bheda). It should be taken toSahasrara through various Chakras. When Kundalini is at one Chakra, intense heat is felt there andwhen it leaves that centre for another Chakra, the former Chakra becomes very cold and appearslifeless.Freedom from Kama, Krodha, Raga and Dvesha and possession of balance of mind, cosmiclove, astral vision, supreme fearlessness, desirelessness, Siddhis, divine intoxication and spiritualAnanda are the signs to denote the awakening of Kundalini. When it is at rest, a man has fullconsciousness of the world and its surroundings. When it is awakened he is dead to the world. Hehas no body-consciousness. He attainsUnmanistate. When Kundalini travels from Chakra toChakra, layer after layer of the mind becomes opened and the Yogi acquires psychic powers. Hegets control over the five elements. When it reaches the Sahasrara Chakra, he is in the Chidakasa(knowledge space).Awakening of the Kundalini Sakti, its union with Siva, enjoying the nectar and otherfunctions of the Kundalini Yoga that are described in the Yoga Sastras are misrepresented andtaken in a literal sense by many. They think that they are Siva and ladies to be Sakti and that meresexual union is the aim of Kundalini Yoga. After having some wrong interpretation of the Yogictexts, they begin to offer flowers and worship their wives with lustful propensities. The term“Divine intoxication that is derived by drinking the nectar” is also misrepresented. They take a lotof wine and other intoxicating drinks and imagine to have enjoyed the Divine ecstasy. It is mereignorance. They are utterly wrong. This sort of worship and union is not at all Kundalini Yoga.They divert their concentration on sexual centres and ruin themselves. Some foolish young boyspractise one or two Asanas, Mudras and a little Pranayama too for a few days, in any way they like,and imagine that the Kundalini has gone up to their neck. They pose as big Yogis. They are pitiable,self-deluded souls. Even a Vedanti (a student of Jnana Yoga) can get Jnana Nishtha only through36KUNDALINI YOGA"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"awakening of the Kundalini Sakti that lies dormant at the Muladhara Chakra. No superconsciousstate or Samadhi is possible without awakening this primordial energy, whether it is Raja Yoga,Bhakti Yoga, Hatha Yoga or Jnana Yoga.It is easy to awaken the Kundalini, but it is very difficult to take it to Sahasrara Chakrathrough the different Chakras. It demands a great deal of patience, perseverance, purity and steadypractice. The Yogi who has taken it to Sahasrara Chakra, is the real master of all forces. GenerallyYogic students stop their Sadhana half-way on account of false Tushti (satisfaction). They imaginethat they have reached the goal when they get some mystic experiences and psychic powers. Theydesire to demonstrate such powers to the public to get Khyati (reputation and fame) and to earnsome money. This is a sad mistake. Full realisation alone can give the final liberation, perfect peaceand Highest Bliss.Different methods of awakening the Kundalini by Hatha Yoga, Bhakti Yoga, Raja Yogaand Jnana Yoga will be described one by one. Some aspirants will not get perfection by only onemethod. A harmonious combination of all methods is necessary for the vast majority of persons. Inthe following pages I will tell you the different exercises that are intended to awaken the Kundalini.If you are wise enough, after a perusal of the different exercises, you can easily pick up the rightmethod of Sadhana that suits you best and attain success.Rousing of Kundalini and its union with Siva at the Sahasrara Chakra effect the state ofSamadhi and Mukti. Before awakening the Kundalini, you must have Deha Suddhi (purity ofbody), Nadi Suddhi (purification of Nadis), Manas-Suddhi (purity of mind) and Buddhi Suddhi(purity of intellect). For the purification of the body, the following six exercises are prescribed:Dhauti, Basti, Neti, Nauli, Tratak and Kapalabhati. These are known as Shat-Karma or thesix purificatory exercises in Hatha Yoga.1. DHAUTIPurification is of two kinds: Antar-Dhauti (internal cleaning) and Bahir-Dhauti (externalcleaning). Antar-Dhauti can be made in three ways. Take a fine piece of muslin cloth, 3 inches wideand 15 feet long. The borders should be stitched well and no pieces of loose thread should behanging from its sides. Wash it with soap before use and make it clean. Dip it in tepid water.Squeeze out the water and swallow one end of it little by little. On the first day swallow only onefoot. Keep it there for a few seconds and then take it out very slowly. On the next day swallow alittle more and keep it for a few minutes and then take it out slowly. Thus little by little you canswallow the whole length, retain it for about 5 minutes and then take it out. Do not be hasty. Do notinjure your throat by rough handling. When the Kriya is over drink a cup of milk. This is a sort oflubrication for the throat. This exercise should be done when your stomach is empty. Morning timeis good.You need not practise this every day. Once in 4 days or a week is sufficient. This exercisecannot at all do any harm if gradually practised. Everyone will feel a little vomiting sensation on thefirst 2 or 3 attempts. As soon as the Kriya is over, wash the cloth with soap and keep it always clean.This is an excellent exercise for those who are of a flabby and phlegmatic constitution. Gradual37YOGA SADHANA"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"steady practice cures Gulma, gastritis, dyspepsia, diseases of the stomach and spleen, disorder ofphlegm and bile. This exercise is also known as Vastra Dhauti. This is one variety of Antar-Dhauti.There are some people who can drink plenty of water and pass it through the anusimmediately. It is called Varisara Dhauti. This is an effective method. This exercise is also knownas ‘Sang Pachar Kriya’. Yogi Sambhunathaji of Kishkindha is an expert in this Kriya. This is notpossible for the vast majority of persons. Nauli and Uddiyana Bandha should be combined forperforming this exercise. Even the smoke of a cigarette can be passed out through the anus.Drink a large quantity of water and shake the abdominal portions. Contract the stomach andvomit the water. This exercise goes with the name ‘Kunjara Kriya’. This is also a kind ofpurificatory exercise.Internal cleaning can be made also by swallowing air. Fill up the stomach with plenty of air.It is done by hiccough. Just as you swallow food little by little, so also you can swallow air and fillup the stomach and intestines. You will have to learn this from the man who can do this Kriya.When you contract the abdominal muscles, the air will pass away through the anus as Apana Vayu.Those who can fill up their stomach with air, can float on water just like a dead body and can alsolive on air and water alone for some days without any food. Those who can do Antar-Dhauti in anyway, need not go in for any purgative or laxative. They will never suffer from indigestion orconstipation.There are some other Dhautis, viz., Danta Dhauti (cleaning the teeth), Jihva Dhauti(cleaning the tongue), Karna Dhauti (cleaning the ears), Mula Sodhana Dhauti (cleaning the anus),etc. These are being done by you all everyday. I need not tell you much about these.2. BASTI‘Basti’ exercise is intended to serve the purpose of ‘enema’ to pass out the accumulation offaeces from the intestinal canal. There are two varieties, viz., Sthala Basti and Jala Basti.STHALA BASTI: Sit on the ground and catch hold of your toes with fingers. Do not bendthe knees. This is exactly like the Paschimottanasana, but here you need not bring your head to theknees. Assuming this posture, churn the abdominal muscles and dominal muscles and expel thewater. It cures uriter muscles. This is Sthala Basti.JALA BASTI: This is more effective than Sthala Basti. Take a small bamboo tube, fiveinches long. Lubricate one end of it with vaseline, oil or soap. Sit in a tub of water or in a tank inknee-level of water in Utkatasana. Insert the bamboo tube about 2 or 3 inches into the anus.Contract the anus. Draw the water into the intestines slowly. Shake the abdominal muscles andexpel the water. It cures urinary troubles, dropsy, constipation, etc. You should not do this everydayand make it a habit. This is only for occasional use. Do this in the morning hours before takingmeals. If you do not know how to draw in the water through the tube, then you can use the ordinarysyringe that is available in the market. By the use of the bamboo, you will know the method ofdrawing water through the anus. But in the enema syringe water is being pushed in by the help ofair. That is only the difference but the result is the same in both cases. By using the bamboo tube you38KUNDALINI YOGA"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"can have mastery over the intestinal muscles by drawing in and pushing out the water at yourcommand.3. NETI‘Neti’ exercise is intended for the purification of the nostrils. The nostrils must be keptalways clean. Unclean nostrils will lead you to irregular breathing. Irregular breathing will makeyou sick.Take a fine piece of thread about 12 inches long. There should not be any knot in the middleof the thread. It should not be too thin and weak. Insert one end of it into the right nostril and catchhold of the other end firmly. Make a forcible, continuous inhalation and pass it inside. Then slowlypull it out. Again in the same way pass it through the left nostril and take it out slowly. Do not injureyour nostrils through violent pulling. After some practice, pass the thread through one nostril andtake it out through the other. In the beginning you will begin to sneeze profusely when you insert thethread into the nose. This passes off after 3 or 4 attempts. This can be practised when you find thatyour nostril is blocked from cold.There is another easy method of cleaning the nostrils. Take some cold water in your hand orin a wide-mouthed cup. Draw the water slowly through the nose and expel it forcibly through thenose. There are many who can do this quite easily. After one or two attempts some persons maysuffer from slight cold and cough when they begin to learn this. As soon as they are all right, again,they can practise.You have seen many who draw the smoke of a cigarette through the mouth and pass it by thenose quite easily. If cigarette users try, they can draw the smoke through one nostril and pass it outby the other nostril or by the mouth. In the same way water also can be passed quite easily.Drawing water and expelling it through the nose is known as ‘Seet-Krama’. If you drawwater through the nose and expel it through the mouth, it is called ‘Vyut-Krama’. In GherandaSamhita it is stated that this Neti Kriya purifies the skull and produces clairvoyance (Divya Drishti).Rhinitis and coryza are also cured thereby.4. NAULINauli Kriya is intended for regenerating, invigorating and stimulating the abdominalviscera and the gastro-intestinal or alimentary system. For the practice of Nauli you should knowthe Uddiyana Bandha. Uddiyana can be done even in a sitting posture; but Nauli is generally donewhile standing.Stage I: Do a strong and forcible expiration through the mouth and keep the lungscompletely empty. Contract and forcibly draw the abdominal muscles towards the back. This isUddiyana Bandha. This is the first stage of Nauli. Uddiyana Bandha terminates in Nauli.For practising Nauli, stand up. Keep the right leg a foot apart from the left leg. If you keepup the feet close together, at times you may lose the balance and stumble down. Rest your hands on39YOGA SADHANA"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"the thighs, thus making a slight curve of the back. Then do Uddiyana Bandha. Do this for one weekbefore proceeding to the next stage.Stage II: Now allow the centre of the abdomen free by contracting the left and right side ofthe abdomen. You will have all the muscles in the centre in a vertical line. This is called MadhyamaNauli. Keep it as long as you can with comfort. Do only this much for a few days.Stage III: Here you should contract the right side of the abdomen and allow the left side free.You will have the muscles on the left side only. This is called Vama Nauli. Again contract the leftside muscles and allow the right side free. This is Dakshina Nauli. By having such gradualpractices, you will understand how to contract the muscles of the central, left and right sides of theabdomen. You will also notice how they move from side to side. In this stage you will see theabdominal muscles only in the central, right or the left side. Practise this stage for a week.Stage IV: Keep the muscles in the centre. Slowly bring to the right side and then to left sidein a circular way. Do this several times from the right to left side and then do it in a reverse way fromthe left to right side. You should turn the muscles always with a circular motion slowly. When youadvance in the practice you can do it quickly; but you can derive full benefits of this Kriya when youdo it very slowly and gradually. This last stage of Nauli will appear like ‘churning’ when theabdominal muscles are isolated and rotated from side to side.Beginners will feel slight pain of abdomen in the first two or three attempts. They need notfear and stop the practice. The pain will vanish away in 2 or 3 days. When Nauli is demonstrated bythe advanced Yogic student, the onlookers will be extremely surprised to look at the movements ofthe abdominal muscles. They will feel as if an engine is working in the abdominal factory.When beginners want to do Dakshina Nauli, they should slightly bend towards the left sideand contract the left muscles. When they want to do Vama Nauli, let them bend a little to the rightside. In Madhyama Nauli, push the entire muscles forward by contracting the two sides.This exercise is not at all possible for those who have a barrel-like belly. When they find itdifficult to carry their own belly, they cannot at all dream of getting success in this Kriya. They canalso try by gradual slow practice. For getting success, they must exert hard and have rigorouspractice for a long time. Those who have a tender body can very easily learn and perform this Kriyain a beautiful and efficient manner.In the famous Hardwar cosmopolitan platform where Punjabis and Bengali Baboos stroll inthe evening with their ladies, on the banks of the Ganges, some persons demonstrate Nauli andvarious other Asanas and Mudras for the sake of a few pies only. They pass on from one exercise tothe other very quickly. You will find the same in Calcutta, Delhi, Bombay, Madras and in all thebusy centres. This is only a sort of profession. It is not at all Yoga. It is only a variety of physicalfeats. From the very condition of their body you will find that they do not possess all thequalifications and aims of a Yogi, They do not even appear physically better, since they arehabituated to intoxicant drinks, Ganja, Bhang, etc.40KUNDALINI YOGA"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"If the Yogic exercises are done in the right way with the right mental attitude, it will surelylead you to spiritual growth. Nauli Kriya eradicates chronic constipation, dyspepsia and all otherdiseases of the gastro-intestinal system. Nauli helps Sang Pachar and Basti Kriya also. The liver andpancreas are toned. The kidneys and other organs of the abdomen function properly. Nauli is ablessing to humanity. It is a sovereign specific ‘uni-all’ or an ideal ‘pick-me-up.’5. TRATAKA‘Trataka’ is steady gazing at a particular point or object without winking. Though this is oneof the six purificatory exercises, it is mainly intended for developing concentration and mentalfocusing. It is very useful for the students of Hatha Yoga, Jnana Yoga, Bhakti Yoga and Raja Yoga.There is no other effective method for the control of the mind. Some of the students who claim thatthey belong to Jnana Yoga, neglect such important exercises since they are described under HathaYogic portions. Sri Ramana Maharshi the famous Jnani of Tiruvannamalai, was doing this exercise.You could have seen it clearly if you had been to his Ashram for his Darshan. While seated on hissofa in his room, he used to gaze on the walls. When he sat on the veranda in an easy-chair, hesteadily looked at the distant hills or at the sky. This enabled him to keep up a balanced state ofmind. Nothing could distract his mind. He was very calm and cool always. He was not at alldistracted by any one even though his Bhaktas might be talking and singing by his side.EXERCISES(1) Keep the picture of Lord Krishna, Rama, Narayana or Devi in front of you. Look at itsteadily without winking. Gaze at the head; then at the body; then at the legs. Repeat the sameprocess again and again. When your mind calms down look at a particular place only. Be steady tilltears begin to flow. Then close the eyes and mentally visualise the picture.(2) Gaze on a black dot on a white wall or draw a black mark on a piece of white paper andhang it on the wall in front of you.(3) Draw the picture Om (!) on a piece of paper and have it before your seat. Do Trataka onit.(4) Lie down on an open terrace and gaze at a particular bright star or on the full moon. Aftersome time, you will see different colours of lights. Again some time later, you will see only aparticular colour throughout, and all other surrounding stars will disappear. When you gaze at themoon, you will see only a bright moon on a black background. At times you will see a huge mass oflight all around you. When gazing becomes more intense, you can also see two or three moons ofthe same size and at times you cannot see any moon at all even though your eyes may be wide open.(5) Select at random any place in the open sky in the morning or evening hours and gaze at itsteadily. You will get new inspirations.(6) Look at a mirror and gaze at the pupil of your eye.41YOGA SADHANA"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"(7) Some people do Trataka at the space between the two eyebrows or at the tip of the nose.Even during walking, some persons do Trataka at the tip of the nose.(8) Advanced students can do Trataka at the inner Chakras, (Padmas). Muladhara, Anahata,Ajna and Sahasrara are the important centres for Trataka.(9) Keep a ghee-lamp before you and gaze at the flames. Some astral entities giveDarshanthrough the flames.(10) Very few Yogins do Trataka on the sun. It requires the help of an experienced man bytheir side. They begin to gaze on the rising sun and after gradual practice they do Trataka on the suneven in the midday. They get some special Siddhis (psychic powers) by this practice. All are not fitfor this Sadhana. All the first 9 exercises will suit everyone and they are harmless. The last one,sun-gazing should not be attempted until you get the help of an experienced man.INSTRUCTIONSWhen you do the practice in your meditation room, sit in your favourite Asana (posture),Siddhasana or Padmasana. At other times you can do in a standing or sitting posture. Trataka can beprofitably done even when you walk. As you walk along the streets, do not look hither and thither.Gaze at the tip of the nose or toes. There are many persons who do not look at the face when theytalk to others. They have their own gaze at a particular place and talk. No particular Asana isrequired for this Sadhana.When you gaze at a picture, it is Trataka. When you close your eyes and mentally visualisethe picture, it is Saguna Dhyana (meditation with form). When you associate the attributes of Godsuch as omnipresence, omnipotence, omniscience, purity, perfection, etc., the name and the form ofthe object of Trataka will automatically disappear and you will enter into Nirguna Dhyana (abstractmeditation).Do Trataka for two minutes to start with. Then cautiously increase the period. Do not beimpatient. Gradual steady practice is required. Gazing at a spot even for three full hourscontinuously counts for nothing, if the mind is wandering. The mind also must be on the spot. Thenonly you will advance in this practice and attain many psychic powers.Those who cannot gaze steadily for a second in spite of several attempts, need not worrymuch. They can close their eyes and gaze at an imaginary spot at the space between the twoeyebrows.Those who have very weak eye-capillaries should do Trataka after closing their eyes on anyimaginary spot within or without. Do not tax your eyes by over-practice. When you feel tired, closeyour eyes and keep your mind on the object of Trataka. When you sit and do Trataka do not shakethe body.Trataka improves eyesight. Many who had some eye-troubles have realised immensebenefits by Trataka. Going beyond one’s own power and gazing at the sun without any help may42KUNDALINI YOGA"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"produce serious troubles. For gazing on the sun you must have your guide by your side. The Guruwill prescribe some oil to rub on your head to avoid such serious troubles and to cool the system.You should apply honey to your eyes at night when you practise sun-gazing.The same object of gazing will appear as something else during the practice. You will havemany other visions. Different people have different experiences. You will not even believe certainthings when others tell you of their experiences. Trataka alone cannot give you all Siddhis. After thecontrol of the mind, when it becomes steady, you will have to manipulate the mind by prescribedmethods for the attainment of powers. Therefore the powers that are obtained by this practice mayvary in different persons. It depends upon the further training of the mind, in a particular way.Young aspirants, who pose as big Yogins, neglect such practices and ask whether thispractice is Moksha. Certainly that practice itself is not Moksha. Different practices are for theattainment of Moksha. One can attain the goal by a particular method, others by different methods.Remember this point always. Otherwise you will be neglecting all the methods. You will bemisguided and lose the goal if you neglect the Sadhana.By the practice of Trataka, diseases of the eyes are removed. Eye-sight improves. Manyhave thrown away their spectacles after taking to this practice. Will-power is developed. Vikshepais destroyed. It steadies the mind. Clairvoyance, thought-reading, psychic cure and other Siddhisare obtained very easily.Once again I will tell you that Bhakti Yoga, Jnana Yoga, Hatha Yoga, Karma Yoga, etc., arenot incompatibles like Cocaine and Soda Bicarbonate. They are not antagonistic to each other. Donot neglect this exercise for the mere reason that it comes under Hatha Yoga portions. Even thoughyou may claim to be a student of Jnana Yoga or Bhakti Yoga, you can take to this practice. It is avery effective powerful remedy for a wandering mind. It prepares the mind undoubtedly for perfectDhyana and Samadhi. This is assuredly a means for the end. You must ascend the Yogic ladder orstair-case step by step. Several persons have been benefited by this useful exercise. Why not you,also, dear friend, sincerely attempt to practise this from this moment? I have given you differentexercises for Trataka. Select any one of the methods that suits you best and realise the spiritualbenefits. Do this for one month regularly and let me know your experiences, benefits and alsotroubles, if any.6. KAPALABHATIKapalabhati is an exercise for the purification of skull and lungs. Though this is one of theShat-Karmas (six purificatory exercises), yet it is a variety of Pranayama exercises.Sit in Padmasana or Siddhasana. Keep the hands on the knees. Perform Puraka (inhalation)and Rechaka (exhalation) rapidly. Those who can do Bhastrika Pranayama can easily do this. InBhastrika there is a Kumbhaka (retention of breath) for a long time at the end of the required rounds.But in Kapalabhati there is no Kumbhaka. Again in Kapalabhati, Puraka is very long and mild, butRechaka is too quick and forcible. In Bhastrika, Puraka is done as quickly as Rechaka. This is theonly difference between Kapalabhati and Bhastrika. In Kapalabhati, Rechaka should be doneforcibly and quickly by contracting the abdominal muscles with backward push. To start with, have43YOGA SADHANA"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"only one expulsion per second. In the beginning do 10 expulsions per round.

It removes spasm in bronchial tubes.Consequently Asthma is relieved and cured also in course of time. Consumption is cured by thispractice. Impurities of the blood are thrown out. The circulatory and respiratory systems are tonedto a considerable degree. Shat-Karmas are intended for the purification of the body. When Nadisare impure Kundalini cannot pass from the Muladhara to Sahasrara Chakra. Purification of Nadis iseffected through Pranayama. For Pranayama, you should know well about Prana.PRANAYAMAWHAT IS PRANA?Prana is the sum total of all energy that is manifested in the universe. It is the vital force,Sukshma. Breath is the external manifestation of Prana. By exercising control over this grossbreath, you can control the subtle Prana inside. Control of Prana means control of mind. Mindcannot operate without the help of Prana. It is the Sukshma Prana that is intimately connected withthe mind. Prana is the sum total of all latent forces which are hidden in men and which lieeverywhere around us. Heat, light, electricity, magnetism are all the manifestations of Prana. Pranais related to mind; through mind to the will; through will to the individual soul, and through this tothe Supreme Being.The seat of Prana is the heart. Prana is one; but it has many functions to do. Hence it assumesfive names according to the different functions it performs, viz., Prana, Apana, Samana, Udana andVyana. According to the different functions they perform, they occupy certain places in the body.The table given in the following pages will give you a clear idea.Breath directed by thought under the control of the will is a vitalising, regenerated forcewhich can be utilised consciously for self-development, for healing many incurable diseases andfor many other useful purposes. Hatha Yogins consider that Prana Tattva is superior to ManasTattva (mind), as Prana is present even when mind is absent during deep sleep. Hence Prana plays amore vital part than mind.If you know how to control the little waves of Prana working through mind, then the secretof subjugating the universal Prana will be known to you. The Yogin who becomes an expert in theknowledge of this secret, will have no fear from any power, because he has mastery over allmanifestations of power in the Universe. What is commonly known as Power of Personality isnothing more than the natural capacity of a person to wield his Prana. Some people are morepowerful in life, more influential and fascinating than others. It is all through this Prana, which theYogin uses consciously by the command of his will.Having acquired a thorough knowledge of the seat of Nadis and of the Vayus with theirfunctions, one should begin with the purification of Nadis. A person possessed of Yama and44KUNDALINI YOGA"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Niyama, avoiding all company, having finished his course of study, delighting in Truth and virtues,having conquered his anger, being engaged in the service of his spiritual instructor and wellinstructed in all the religious practices, should go to a secluded place for Yoga Abhyasa.Five PranasNAMECOLOURLOCATIONREGIONFUNCTIONSUB-PRANASPranaYellowAnahataChakraChestRespiration1.Nagadoeseructation andhiccup.ApanaOrangeredMuladharaChakraAnusDischarge ofurine and faeces2.Kurmaperformsthe function ofopening the eyes.SamanaGreenManipuraChakraNavelDigestion3.Krikarainduceshunger and thirst.UdanaVioletblueVishuddhaChakraThroatDeglutition.Takes the Jiva toBrahman insleep.

It is the first part of Yoga.Just as you can stop all the other wheels of the factory if you can stop the importantfly-wheel of the engine, so also if you can stop the functions of all other organs of the body, you canget control of the subtle, psychic Prana by restraining the breath. That is the reason why Pranayamais prescribed for controlling Prana.Prana is the over-coat of the mind. If you can control Prana, you can control mind andVeerya also, because Prana, Veerya and mind are under one Sambandha. If you can control mind,breath stops by itself. Prana comes under control. Just as you have a nervous system in the grossphysical body, so also there is a nervous system in the astral body. The nervous system of thephysical body is the Sthula Prana. The nervous system of the astral body is the Sukshma Prana.There is intimate connection between these two Pranas. There is inter-action between these twoPranas.By controlling the act of breathing, you can efficiently control all the various functions inthe body. You can very easily and quickly control and develop the body, mind and soul. Psychiccure, Telepathy, Television, thought-reading and other Siddhis are the effects of the control ofPrana. The process by which the Prana is controlled by regulation of breath is termed ‘Pranayama’.45PRANAYAMA"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"It is through Pranayama that you can control your circumstances and character and consciouslyharmonise the universal individual life with the cosmic life.PRANAYAMATo suit the different constitutions, temperament and purpose, in Pranayama there are manyvarieties of exercises, viz., deep breathing exercise, Sukha Purvaka (easy comfortable) Pranayamaduring walking, Pranayama during meditation, Rhythmical breathing, Suryabheda, Ujjayi, Sitkari,Sitali, Bhastrika, Bhramari, Murchha, Plavini, Kevala Kumbhaka, etc. Of all the above exercisesonly the last eight are described in the Hatha Yogic texts.NADI SUDDHIBefore commencing the practice of Pranayama however, you should clean the Nadis. Thenonly will you derive the maximum benefit from Pranayama. The cleansing of the Nadi(Nadi-Suddhi) is either Samanu or Nirmanu—that is, with or without the use of Bija. According tothe first form, the Yogi in Padmasana or Siddhasana offers his prayers to the Guru and meditates onhim. Meditating on ‘Yang’ (y: ̇) he does Japa through Ida of the Bija 16 times, Kumbhaka with Japaof the Bija 64 times, and then exhalation through the solar Nadi and Japa of Bija 32 times. Fire israised from Manipura and united with Prithvi. Then follows inhalation by the solar Nadi with theVahni Bija ‘Rang’ (r ̇) 16 times, Kumbhaka with Japa of the Bija 64 times, followed by exhalationthrough the lunar Nadi and Japa of the Bija 32 times. He then meditates on the lunar brilliance,gazing at the tip of the nose, and inhales by Ida with Japa of the Bija ‘Thang’ (Y ̇) 16 times.Kumbhaka is done with the Bija ‘Vang’ (v: ̇) 64 times. He thinks himself as flooded by nectar, andconsiders that the Nadis have been washed. He exhales by Pingala with Japa of the Bija ‘Lang’ (l: ̇)32 times and considers himself thereby as strengthened.Now I will tell you a few important exercises only, that are useful in awakening theKundalini.1. SUKHA PURVAKA(Easy Comfortable Pranayama)Sit in Padmasana or Siddhasana. Close the right nostril with your right thumb. Inhale(Puraka) through the left nostril till you count 3 Oms slowly. Imagine that you are drawing thePrana along with the atmospheric air. In course of practice, you will actually feel that you aredrawing Prana. Then close the left nostril also with the little and ring fingers of your right hand.Retain the breath till you count 12 Oms. Send the current down to the Muladhara Chakra. Feel thatthe nerve-current is striking against the Muladhara Chakra and awakening Kundalini. Remove theright thumb and exhale through the right nostril till you count 6 Oms. Again inhale through the rightnostril, retain and exhale through the left nostril as stated above. All the above six processesconstitute one Pranayama. To start with do 6 Pranayamas in the morning and 6 in the evening.Gradually increase it to 20 Pranayamas for each sitting. The ratio of inhalation, retention andexhalation is 1:4:2. You should gradually increase the period of Kumbhaka.46KUNDALINI YOGA"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Be careful in doing the Kumbhaka as long as you can comfortably do. Do not be in a hurry.Be patient. Contract the anus and do Mula Bandha also. Concentrate on the Chakra and meditate onKundalini. This is the most important portion of this exercise. In this Pranayama, deepconcentration plays a vital part in awakening Kundalini. Kundalini will be awakened quickly if thedegree of concentration is intense and if practised regularly.This exercise removes all diseases, purifies the Nadis, steadies the wandering mind,improves digestion and circulation, helps Brahmacharya, and awakens Kundalini. All theimpurities of the body are thrown out.2. BHASTRIKARapid succession of forcible expulsions is a characteristic feature of this exercise.‘Bhastrika’ means ‘bellows’ in Sanskrit. Just as a blacksmith blows his bellows rapidly, so also youshould inhale and exhale rapidly. Sit in your favourite Asana. Close the mouth. Inhale and exhalequickly 20 times like the bellows. Constantly dilate and contract the chest as you inhale and exhale.When you practise the Pranayama a hissing sound is produced. You should start with forcibleexpulsions of breath following one another in rapid succession. After 20 such expulsions, make adeep inhalation and retain the breath as long as you can comfortably do and then slowly exhale. Thisis one round of Bhastrika.Begin with 10 expulsions for a round and increase it gradually to 20 or 25 for a round. Theperiod of Kumbhaka also should be gradually and cautiously increased. Rest a while after oneround is over and again begin the next round. Do 3 rounds in the beginning and after due practice,do 20 rounds in the morning and 20 in the evening.Advanced students do this Pranayama after partial closing of the glottis. They do not make apowerful noise like the beginners. They can do it even in a standing posture.Bhastrika removes inflammation of the throat, increases the gastric fire, destroys phlegmand all diseases of the nose and lungs, eradicates Asthma, consumption and other diseases whicharise from the excess of wind, bile and phlegm. It gives warmth to the body. It is the most effectiveof all Pranayama exercises. It enables Prana to break through the three Granthis. All the otherbenefits of Sukha Purvaka Pranayama are obtained in this exercise also.3. SURYABHEDASit on Padmasana or Siddhasana. Close the eyes. Keep the left nostril closed with your rightring and little fingers. Slowly inhale without making any sound as long as you can do it comfortablythrough the right nostril. Then close the right nostril with your right thumb and retain the breath byfirmly pressing the chin against the chest (Jalandhara Bandha). Hold the breath till perspirationoozes from the roots of the hair (hair follicles). This point cannot be reached at the very outset. Youwill have to increase the period of Kumbhaka gradually. This is the limit of the sphere of practice ofSuryabheda Kumbhaka. Release the Jalandhara Bandha. Then exhale very slowly without makingany sound through the left nostril with the thumb closing the right nostril.47PRANAYAMA"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Kumbhakah suryabhedastujara-mrityu-vinasakah,Bodhayet kundalim saktimdehagnim cha vivardhayet“The practice of Suryabheda Kumbhaka destroys decay and death and awakens Kundalini.”This Pranayama should again and again be performed, as it purifies the brain and destroysthe intestinal worms. It removes the four kinds of evils caused by Vayu and cures Vata(rheumatism). It cures rhinitis and various sorts of neuralgia. The worms that are found in thefrontal sinuses are also destroyed.4. UJJAYISit in your usual Asana. Close the mouth. Inhale slowly through both the nostrils in asmooth, uniform manner.Retain the breath as long as you can do it comfortably and then exhale slowly through theleft nostril by closing the right nostril with your right thumb. Expand the chest when you inhale.During inhalation a peculiar sound is produced owing to the partial closing of glottis. The soundproduced during inhalation should be of a mild and uniform pitch. It should be continuous also.This Kumbhaka may be practised even when walking or standing. Instead of exhaling through theleft nostril, you can exhale slowly through both nostrils.This removes the heat in the head. The practitioner becomes very beautiful. The gastric fireis increased. It removes phlegm in the throat. Asthma, consumption and all sorts of pulmonarydiseases are cured. All diseases that arise from deficient inhalation of oxygen and diseases of theheart are cured. All works are accomplished by Ujjayi Pranayama. The practitioner is neverattacked by diseases of phlegm, nerves, enlargement of spleen, dyspepsia, dysentery, consumption,cough or fever. Perform Ujjayi to destroy decay and death.5. PLAVINIPractice of this Pranayama demands skill on the part of the students. He who practises thisPlavini can do Jalastambha and float on water for any length of time, Mr. ‘S’, a Yogic student, canfloat on water for twelve hours at a stretch. He who practises this Plavini Kumbhaka can live on airand dispense with food for some days. The student actually drinks air slowly like water and sends itto the stomach. The stomach gets bloated a bit. If you tap the stomach when it is filled with air, youwill get a peculiar tympanic (air) sound. Gradual practice is necessary. The help of one who is wellversed in this Pranayama, is necessary. The student can fill up the stomach with air by gradualbelching. After the practice, the air should be completely taken out. It is done by Uddiyana Bandhaand hiccough.48KUNDALINI YOGA"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"6. PRANIC HEALINGThose who practise Pranayama, can impart their Prana for healing morbid diseases. Theycan also recharge themselves with Prana in no time by practising Kumbhaka. Never think that youwill be depleted of your Prana by distributing it to others. The more you will give, the more it willflow to you from the cosmic source (Hiranyagarbha). That is the law of Nature. Do not become aniggard. If there is a rheumatic patient, gently shampoo his legs with your hands. When you doshampooing (massage), do Kumbhaka and imagine that the Prana is flowing from your handstowards your patient. Connect yourself with Hiranyagarbha or the cosmic Prana and imagine thatthe cosmic energy is flowing through your hands towards the patient. The patient will at once feelwarmth, relief and strength. You can cure headache, intestinal colic or any other disease by massageand by your magnetic touch. When you massage the liver, spleen, stomach or any other portion ororgan of the body you can speak to the cells and give them orders:—“O cells! Discharge yourfunctions properly. I command you to do so.” They will obey your orders. They too have gotsubconscious intelligence. Repeat your Mantra when you pass your Prana to others. Try a fewcases. You will gain competence. You can cure scorpion-sting also. Gently shampoo the leg andbring the poison down.You can have extraordinary power of concentration, strong will and a perfectly healthy,strong body by practising Pranayama regularly. You will have to direct the Prana consciously tounhealthy parts of the body. Suppose you have a sluggish liver. Sit on Padmasana. Close your eyes.Do Sukha Purvaka Pranayama. Direct the Prana to the region of the liver. Concentrate your mindthere. Fix your attention to that area. Imagine that Prana is interpenetrating all the tissues and thecells of the lobes of the liver and doing its curative, regenerating and constructive work there. Faith,imagination, attention and interest play a very important part in curing diseases by taking Prana tothe diseased areas. During exhalation imagine that the morbid impurities of the liver are thrown out.Repeat this process 12 times in the morning and 12 times in the evening. Sluggishness of liver willvanish in a few days. This is a drugless treatment. This is nature-cure. You can take the Prana to anypart of the body during the Pranayama and cure any kind of disease, be it acute or chronic. Try onceor twice in healing yourself. Your convictions will grow stronger. Why do you cry like the lady whois crying for ghee when she has butter in her hand, when you have a cheap, potent, easily availableremedy or agent ‘Prana’ at your command at all times! Use it judiciously. When you advance inyour concentration and practice, you can cure many diseases by mere touch. In the advanced stages,many diseases are cured by mere will.7. DISTANT HEALINGThis is known as “absent treatment” also. You can transmit Prana through space to yourfriend who is living at a distance. He should have a receptive mental attitude. You must feelyourselfen rapport(in direct relation and in sympathy) with the people whom you heal with thisDistant Healing method.You can fix hours of appointment with them through correspondence. You can write tothem: “Get ready at 8 p.m. Have a receptive mental attitude. Lie down in an easy-chair. Close youreyes. I shall transmit my Prana”.49PRANAYAMA"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Say mentally to the patient, ‘I am transmitting a supply of Prana (vital force)’. DoKumbhaka when you send the Prana. Practise rhythmical breathing also. Have a mental image thatthe Prana is leaving your mind, passing through space, and is entering the system of the patient. ThePrana travels unseen like the wireless (radio) waves and flashes like lightning across space. ThePrana that is coloured by the thought of the healer is projected outside. You can re-charge yourselfwith Prana by practising Kumbhaka. This requires long, steady and regular practice.IMPORTANCE OF PRANAYAMATamas and Rajas constitute the covering or veil. This veil is removed by the practice ofPranayama. After the veil is removed, the real nature of the soul is realised. The Chitta is by itselfmade up of Sattvic particles, but it is enveloped by Rajas and Tamas, just as the fire is enveloped bysmoke. There is no purificatory action greater than Pranayama. Pranayama gives purity, and thelight of knowledge shines. The Karma of the Yogi, which covers up the discriminative knowledge,is annihilated by the practice of Pranayama. By the magic panorama of desire, the essence, which isluminous by nature, is covered up and the Jiva or individual soul is directed towards vice. ThisKarma of the Yogi which covers up the Light and binds him to repeated births, becomes attenuatedby the practice of Pranayama every moment and is destroyed eventually.Dharanasu cha Yogyata Manasah: “The mind becomes fit for concentration”—Yoga Sutra(II-53). You will be able to concentrate the mind nicely after this veil of the light has been removed.The mind will be quite steady like the flame in a windless place as the disturbing energy has beenremoved. The word Pranayama is sometimes used collectively for inhalation, retention andexhalation of breath and sometimes for each of these severally. When the Prana Vayu moves inAkasa Tattva, the breathing will be lessened. At this time it will be easy to stop the breath. Thevelocity of the mind will be slowly lessened by the Pranayama. It will induce Vairagya also.BENEFITS OF PRANAYAMAThis body becomes lean, strong and healthy. Too much fat is reduced. There is lustre in theface. Eyes sparkle like diamonds. The practitioner becomes very handsome. Voice becomes sweetand melodious. The inner Anahata sounds are distinctly heard. The student is free from all sorts ofdiseases. He gets established in Brahmacharya. Semen gets firm and steady. The Jatharagni (gastricfire) is augmented. The student becomes so perfected in Brahmacharya that his mind will not beshaken even if a fairy tries to embrace him. Appetite becomes keen. Nadis are purified. Vikshepa isremoved and the mind becomes one-pointed. Rajas and Tamas are destroyed. The mind is preparedfor Dharana and Dhyana. The excretions become scanty. Steady practice arouses the inner spiritualforce and brings in spiritual light, happiness and peace of mind. It makes him an Oordhvareto-Yogi.All psychic powers are obtained. Advanced students only will get all the benefits.INSTRUCTIONS ON PRANAYAMA1. Early morning, answer the calls of nature and sit for the Yogic practices. PractisePranayama in a dry, welt-ventilated room. Pranayama requires deep concentration and attention.Do not keep anyone by your side.50KUNDALINI YOGA"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"2. Before you sit for Pranayama practice, thoroughly clean the nostrils. When you finish thepractice, take a cup of milk or light tiffin after 10 minutes.3. Strictly avoid too much talking, eating, sleeping, mixing with friends and exertion. Take alittle ghee with rice when you take your meals. This will lubricate the bowels and allow Vayu tomove downwards freely.4. Some people twist the muscles of the face when they do Kumbhaka. It should be avoided.It is also a symptom to indicate that they are going beyond their capacity. This must be strictlyavoided. Such people cannot have a regulated Rechaka and Puraka.5. Pranayama can also be performed as soon as you get up from bed and just before Japa andmeditation. It will make your body light and you will enjoy the meditation. You must have a routineaccording to your convenience and time.6. Do not shake the body unnecessarily. By shaking the body often the mind also isdisturbed. Do not scratch the body every now and then. The Asana should be steady and as firm as arock when you do Pranayama, Japa and meditation.7. In all the exercises, repeat Rama, Siva, Gayatri, or any other Mantra, mere number or anyother time-unit according to your inclination. Gayatri or OM is the best for Pranayama. In thebeginning you must observe some time-unit for Puraka, Kumbhaka and Rechaka. The time-unit andthe proper ratio comes by itself when you do the Puraka, Kumbhaka and Rechaka as long as you cando them comfortably. When you have advanced in the practice, you need not count or keep any unit.You will be naturally established in the normal ratio through force of habit.8. For some days in the beginning you must count the number and see how you progress. Inthe advanced stages, you need not distract the mind in counting. The lungs will tell you when youhave finished the required number.9. Do not perform the Pranayama till you are fatigued. There must be always joy andexhilaration of spirit during and after the practice. You should come out of the practice fullyinvigorated and refreshed. Do not bind yourself by too many rules (Niyamas).10. Do not take bath immediately after Pranayama is over. Take rest for half an hour. If youget perspiration during the practice, do not wipe it with a towel. Rub it with your hand. Do notexpose the body to the chill draughts of air when you perspire.11. Always inhale and exhale very slowly. Do not make any sound. In Pranayamas likeBhastrika and Kapalabhati, you can produce a mild or the lowest possible sound.12. You should not expect the benefits after doing it for 2 or 3 minutes only for a day or two.At least you must have 15 minutes’ daily practice in the beginning regularly for days together.There will be no use if you jump from one exercise to another every day.51PRANAYAMA"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"13. Patanjali does not lay much stress on the practice of different kinds of Pranayama. Hementions: “Exhale slowly, then inhale and retain the breath. You will get a steady and calm mind.”It was only the Hatha Yogins who developed Pranayama as a science and who have mentionedvarious exercises to suit different persons.14. A neophyte should do Puraka and Rechaka only without any Kumbhaka for some days.Take a long time to do Rechaka. The proportion for Puraka and Rechaka is 1:2.15. “Pranayama in its popular and preparatory form may be practised by everyone in anyposture whatsoever, sitting or walking; and yet it is sure to show its benefits. For those who practiseit in accordance with the prescribed methods, fructification will be rapid.”16. Gradually increase the period of Kumbhaka. Retain for 4 seconds in the first week, for 8seconds in the second week and for 12 seconds in the third week and so on till you are able to retainthe breath to your full capacity.17. You must so nicely adjust the Puraka, Kumbhaka and Rechaka that you should notexperience the feeling of suffocation or discomfort at any stage of Pranayama. You should neverfeel the necessity of catching hold of a few normal breaths between any two successive rounds. Theduration of Puraka, Kumbhaka and Rechaka must be properly adjusted. Exercise due care andattention. Matters will turn out to be successful and easy.18. You must not unnecessarily prolong the period of exhalation. If you prolong the time ofRechaka, the following inhalation will be done in a hurried manner and the rhythm will bedisturbed. You must so carefully regulate the Puraka, Kumbhaka and Rechaka that you must beable to do with absolute comfort and care, not only of one Pranayama but also the full course orrequired rounds of Pranayama. I have to repeat this often. Experience and practice will make oneperfect. Be steady. Another important factor is that you must have efficient control over the lungs atthe end of Kumbhaka to enable you to do the Rechaka smoothly and in proportion with the Puraka.ASANASIMPORTANCE OF ASANASFour Asanas are prescribed for the purpose of Japa and meditation. They are Padmasana,Siddhasana, Svastikasana and Sukhasana. You must be able to sit in any one of these four Asanas ata stretch for full three hours without shaking the body. Then only you will get Asana-Jaya, masteryover the Asana. Without securing a steady Asana, you cannot further get on well in meditation. Thesteadier you are in your Asana, the more you will be able to concentrate and make your mindone-pointed. If you can be steady in the posture even for one hour, you will be able to acquireone-pointed mind and feel thereby infinite peace and Atmic Ananda.When you sit on the posture, think: “I am as firm as a rock”. Give this suggestion to the mindhalf a dozen times. Then the Asana will become steady soon. You must become as a living statue52KUNDALINI YOGA"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"when you sit for Dhyana. Then only there will be real steadiness in your Asana. In one year byregular practice you will have success and will be able to sit for three hours at a stretch. Start withhalf an hour and gradually increase the period.When you sit in the Asana, keep your head, neck and trunk in one straight line. Stick to oneAsana and make it quite steady and perfect by repeated attempts. Never change the Asana. Adhereto one tenaciously. Realise the full benefits of one Asana. Asana gives Dridhata (strength). Mudragives Sthirata (steadiness). Pratyahara gives Dhairya (boldness). Pranayama gives Laghima(lightness). Dhyana gives Pratyakshatva (perception) of Self and Samadhi gives Kaivalya(isolation) which is verily the freedom or final beatitude.The postures are as many in number as there are number of species of living creatures in thisuniverse. There are 84 lakhs of Asanas described by Lord Siva. Among them 84 are the best andamong these, 32 are very useful. There are some Asanas which can be practised while standing.These are Tadasana, Trikonasana, Garudasana, etc. There are some which can be practised bysitting, such as Paschimottanasana, Padmasana, etc. Some Asanas are done while lying down.These are Uttanapadasana, Pavanamuktasana, etc. Sirshasana, Vrikshasana, etc., are done withhead downwards and legs upwards.In olden days these Asanas were practised in Gurukulas and so the people were strong andhealthy and had long lives. In schools and colleges these Asanas should be introduced. Ordinaryphysical exercises develop the superficial muscles of the body only. One can become a Sandowwith a beautiful physique by the physical exercises. But Asanas are intended for physical andspiritual development.Detailed instructions regarding the technique of 94 Asanas are given in my book ‘YogaAsanas’ with illustrations. Here I will mention only a few of the Asanas that are useful forconcentration, meditation and for awakening the Kundalini.1. PADMASANA (LOTUS POSE)Amongst the four poses prescribed for Japa and Dhyana, Padmasana comes foremost. It isthe best Asana for contemplation. Rishis like Gheranda, Sandilya, speak very highly of this vitalAsana. This is highly agreeable for householders. Even ladies can sit in this Asana. Padmasana issuitable for lean persons and for youths as well.Sit on the ground by spreading the legs forward. Then place the right foot on the left thighand the left foot on the right thigh. Place the hands on the knee-joints. You can make a fingerlockand keep the locked hands over the left ankle. This is very convenient for some persons. Or you canplace the left hand over the left knee and then place the right hand over the right knee with the palmfacing upwards and the index finger touching the middle portion of the thumb (Chinmudra).53ASANAS"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"PADMASANA2. SIDDHASANA (THE PERFECT POSE)Next to Padmasana comes Siddhasana in importance. Some eulogise this Asana as evensuperior to Padmasana for purposes of Dhyana. If you get mastery over this Asana, you will acquiremany Siddhis. Further it was being practised by many Siddhas of yore. Hence the name Siddhasana.Even fatty persons with big thighs can practise this Asana easily. In fact this is better tosome persons than Padmasana. Young Brahmacharins who attempt to get established in celibacyshould practise this Asana. This Asana is not suitable for ladies.Place one heel at anus. Keep the other heel on the root of the generative organ. The feet orlegs should be so nicely arranged that the ankle-joints should touch each other. Hands can be placedas in Padmasana.54KUNDALINI YOGA"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"SIDDHASANA3. SVASTIKASANA (PROSPEROUS POSE)Svastikasana is sitting at ease with the body erect. Spread the legs forward. Fold the left legand place the foot near the right thigh muscles. Similarly bend the right leg and push it in the spacebetween the thigh and calf muscles. Now you will find the two feet between the thighs and calves ofthe legs. This is a very comfortable Asana. Those who find it difficult to do this, can sit inSamasana.Place the left heel at the beginning of right thigh and the right heel at the beginning of the leftthigh. Sit at ease. Do not bend either on the left or right. This is called ‘Samasana’.4. SUKHASANAAny easy, comfortable posture for Japa and meditation is Sukhasana, the important pointbeing the head, neck and trunk should be in a line without curve. People who begin Japa andmeditation after 30 or 40 years of age generally are not able to sit in Padma, Siddha or Svastikasanafor a long time. People sit in any wrong way and they call it ‘Sukhasana’. The trouble is evenwithout their knowledge the backbone forms a curve in a few minutes. Now I will describe to you anice Sukhasana whereby old persons can sit and meditate for a long time. Young persons should nottry this. This is specially designed to suit old people who are unable to sit in Padmasana orSiddhasana in spite of repeated attempts.Take a cloth 5 cubits long. Fold it nicely length-wise till the width becomes half a cubit. Sitin your usual way keeping the feet below your thighs. Raise the two knees to the level of your chesttill you get a space of 8 or 10 inches between the knees. Now take the folded cloth. Keep one endnear the left side, touching the right knee, come to the starting point. Then make a knot of the two55ASANAS"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"ends. Keep your palms face to face and place them on the support of the cloth between the knees. Inthis Asana the hands, legs and backbone are supported. Hence you will never feel tired. If youcannot do any other Asana sit at least in this Asana and do Japa and meditation for a long time. Youcan also have Svadhyaya (study of religious books) in this Asana.5. SIRSHASANA (TOPSY TURVY POSE)Spread a four-folded blanket. Sit on the two knees. Make a finger-lock by interweaving thefingers. Place it on the ground up to the elbow. Now keep the top of your head on this finger-lock orbetween the two hands. Slowly raise the legs till they become vertical. Stand for five seconds in thebeginning and gradually increase the period by 15 seconds each week to 20 minutes or half an hour.Then very slowly, bring it down. Strong people will be able to keep the Asana for half an hourwithin 2 or 3 months. Do it slowly. There is no harm. If you have time, do twice daily both morningand evening. Perform this Asana very, very slowly, to avoid jerks. While standing on the head,breathe slowly through the nose and never through the mouth.You can place the hands on the ground one on each side of the head. You will find this easyto practise, if you are fat. If you have learnt balancing, you can take to the finger-lock method. ThisAsana is nothing for those who can balance on parallel bars or on the ground. Ask your friend toassist you to keep the legs steady while practising or get the help of a wall.In the beginning some persons may have a novel sensation during practice but this vanishessoon. It brings joy and glee. After the exercise is over take a little rest for five minutes and then takea cup of milk. There are people who are doing this Asana for two or three hours at one stroke.SIRSHASANA56KUNDALINI YOGA"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"BENEFITSThis is very useful in keeping up Brahmacharya. It makes you Oordhvaretas. The seminalenergy is transmuted into spiritual energy, Ojas-Shakti. This is also called sex-sublimation. Youwill not have wet-dreams, Spermatorrhea. In an Oordhvareto-Yogi the seminal energy flowsupwards into the brain for being stored up as spiritual force which is used for contemplativepurposes (Dhyana). When you do this Asana, imagine that the seminal energy is being convertedinto Ojas and is passing along the spinal column into the brain for storage.Sirshasana is really a blessing and a nectar. Words will fail to adequately describe itsbeneficial results and effects. In this Asana alone, the brain can draw plenty of Prana and blood.Memory increases admirably. Lawyers, occultists and thinkers will highly appreciate this Asana.This leads to natural Pranayama and Samadhi by itself. No other effort is necessary. If you watchthe breath, you will notice it becoming finer and finer. In the beginning of practice there will be aslight difficulty in breathing. As you advance in practice, this vanishes entirely. You will find realpleasure and exhilaration of spirit in this Asana.Great benefit is derived by sitting for meditation after Sirshasana. You can hear Anahatasound quite distinctly. Young, robust persons should perform this Asana. Householders whopractise this should not have frequent sexual intercourse.6. SARVANGASANA (ALL-MEMBERS POSE)This is a mysterious Asana which gives wonderful benefits. Spread a thick blanket on thefloor and practise this Asana on the blanket. Lie on the back quite flat. Slowly raise the legs. Lift thetrunk, hips, and legs quite vertically. Support the back with the two hands, one on either side. Restthe elbows on the ground. Press the chin against the chest (Jalandhara Bandha). Allow theback-shoulder portion and neck to touch the ground closely. Do not allow the body to shake ormove to and fro. Keep the legs straight. When the Asana is over, bring the legs down very, veryslowly with elegance and not with any jerks. In this Asana the whole weight of the body is thrownon the shoulders. You really stand on the shoulders with the help and support of the elbows.Concentrate on the Thyroid gland which lies on the front lower part of the neck. Retain the breath aslong as you can do with comfort, and slowly exhale through the nose.You can do this Asana twice daily, morning and evening. This should immediately befollowed by Matsyasana (fish-posture). This will relieve pains in the back part of the neck andintensify the usefulness of Sarvangasana. Stand on the Asana for two minutes and graduallyincrease the period to half an hour.57ASANAS"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"SARVANGASANABENEFITSThis is apanacea, a cure-all, a sovereign specific for all diseases. It brightens the psychicfaculties and awakens Kundalini Sakti, removes all sorts of diseases of intestine and stomach, andaugments the mental power.It supplies a large quantity of blood to the roots of spinal nerves. It is this Asana whichcentralises the blood in the spinal column and nourishes it beautifully. But for this Asana there is noscope for these nerve-roots to draw sufficient blood-supply. It keeps the spine quite elastic.Elasticity of the spine means everlasting youth. It stimulates you in your work. It prevents the spinefrom early ossification (hardening). So you will preserve and retain your youth for a long time. Ithelps a lot in maintaining Brahmacharya. Like Sirshasana, it makes you an Oordhvaretas. It checkswet-dreams effectively. It rejuvenates those who have lost their potency. It acts as a powerfulblood-tonic and purifier. It tones the nerves and awakens Kundalini. Spinal column is rendered verysoft and elastic. This Asana prevents the early ossification of the vertebral bones. Ossification isquick degeneration of bones. Old age manifests quickly on account of early ossification. The bonesbecome hard and brittle in the degenerative process. He who practises Sarvangasana is very nimble,agile, full of energy. The muscles of the back are alternately contracted, relaxed and then pulled andstretched. Hence they draw a good supply of blood by these various movements and are wellnourished. Various sorts of myalgia (muscular rheumatism), lumbago, sprain, neuralgia, etc., arecured by this Asana.The vertebral column becomes as soft and elastic as rubber. It is twisted and rolled as it werelike a piece of canvas sheet. A man who practises this Asana can never become lazy even a bit. He is58KUNDALINI YOGA"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"a two-legged talking squirrel. The vertebral column is a very important structure. It supports thewhole body. It contains the spinal cord, spinal nerve and sympathetic system. In Hatha Yoga thespine is termed as Meru Danda. Therefore you must keep it healthy, strong and elastic. The musclesof the abdomen, the rectic muscles and the muscles of the thigh are also toned and nourished well.Obesity or corpulence and habitual chronic constipation, Gulma, congestion and enlargement of theliver and spleen are cured by this Asana.7. MATSYASANA (FISH POSTURE)This Asana will help one to float on water easily with Plavini Pranayama. Therefore it iscalled fish-pose, Matsyasana. Spread a blanket and sit on Padmasana by keeping the right foot overthe left thigh and the left over right thigh. Then lie flat on the back. Hold the head by the two elbows.This is one variety.Stretch the head back, so that the top of your head rests on the ground firmly on one side andthe buttocks only on the other, thus making a bridge or an arch of the trunk. Place the hands on thethighs or catch the toes with the hands. You will have to give a good twisting to the back. Thisvariety is more efficacious than the former one. The benefits that you derive from this variety are ahundred times more than what you get in the previous variety.Those fatty persons with thick calves, who find it difficult to have Padmasana (foot-lock),may simply sit in the ordinary way and then practise this Asana. Practise the Padmasana first. Makeit firm, easy and steady. Then take Matsyasana. Do this Asana for 10 seconds in the beginning andincrease it to 10 minutes.When you have finished the Asana, slowly release the head with the help of hands and getup. Then unlock the Padmasana.You must practise this Asana soon after Sarvangasana. It will relieve stiffness of the neckand all crampy conditions of the cervical region caused by long practice of Sarvangasana. Thisgives natural massage or shampooing to the congested parts of the neck and shoulders. Further itaffords the maximum benefits of Sarvangasana. It is a complimentary Asana of Sarvangasana.Rather it supplements Sarvangasana. As the larynx or wind-box and trachea (wind-pipe) are thrownopen widely, this Asana helps deep breathing.Matsyasana is the destroyer of many diseases. It removes constipation. It brings down theaccumulated faecal matter to the rectum. It is useful in asthma, consumption, chronic bronchitis,etc., on account of the deep breathing.59ASANAS"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"MATSYASANA8. PASCHIMOTTANASANASit on the ground and stretch the legs stiff like a stick. Catch the toes with the thumb andindex and middle fingers. While catching, you have to bend the trunk forwards. Fatty persons willfind it rather difficult to bend. Exhale. Slowly bend without jerks till your forehead touches yourknees. You can keep the face even between the knees. When you bend down, draw the belly back.This facilitates the bending forward. Bend slowly by gradual degrees. Take your own time. There isno hurry. When you bend down, bend the head between the hands. Retain it on a level with them.Young persons with elastic spine can touch the knees with the forehead even in their very firstattempt. In the case of grown-up persons with rigid spinal column, it will take a fortnight or a monthfor complete success in the posture. Retain the breath till you take the forehead back, to its originalposition, till you sit straight again. Then breathe.Retain the pose for 5 seconds. Then gradually increase the period to 10 minutes.Those who find it difficult to do the full Paschimottanasana, can do half pose with one legand one hand and then with the other leg and hand. They will find this more easy. After some dayswhen the spine has become more elastic, they can have recourse to the full pose. You will have touse common-sense while practising Yogasanas.PASCHIMOTTANASANA60KUNDALINI YOGA"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"BENEFITSThis is an excellent Asana. It makes the breath flow through the Brahma Nadi andSushumna, and rouses the gastric fire. It reduces fat in the abdomen and makes the loins lean. ThisAsana is a specific for corpulence or obesity. It brings about reduction of spleen and liver in cases ofenlargement of spleen. What Sarvangasana is for the stimulation of endocrine glands, so isPaschimottanasana for the stimulation of abdominal viscera, such as kidneys, liver, pancreas, etc.This Asana relieves constipation, removes sluggishness of liver, dyspepsia, belching and gastritis.Lumbago and all sorts of myalgia of the back muscles are cured. This Asana cures piles anddiabetes also. The muscles of the abdomen, the solar plexus, the epigastric plexus, bladder prostate,lumbar nerves, sympathetic cord are all toned up and kept in a healthy, sound condition.9. MAYURASANA (PEACOCK POSE)This is more difficult than Sarvangasana. This demands good physical strength.Kneel on the ground. Sit on the toes. Raise the heels up. Join the two forearms together.Place the palms of the two hands on the ground. The two little fingers must be in close touch. Theyproject towards the feet. Now you have got steady and firm forearms for supporting the whole bodyin the ensuing elevation of the trunk and legs. Now bring down the abdomen slowly against theconjoined elbows. Support your body upon your elbows that are pressed now against the navel orumbilicus. This is the first stage. Stretch your legs and raise the feet stiff and straight on a level withthe head. This is second stage.Neophytes (beginners) find it difficult to keep up the balance as soon as they raise the feetfrom the ground. Place a cushion in front. Sometimes you will have a fall forwards and you mayhurt your nose slightly. Try to slip on the sides when you cannot keep up the balance. If you find itdifficult to stretch the two legs backwards at one stroke, slowly stretch one leg first and then theother. If you adopt the device of leaning the body forwards and head downwards the feet will bythemselves leave the ground and you can stretch them quite easily. When the Asana is in fullmanifestation the head, trunk, buttocks, thighs, legs and feet will be in one straight line and parallelto the ground. This posture is very beautiful to look at.Beginners can practise this Asana by holding on to a table. They will find it easy to practisethis. If you understand the technique of this Asana and if you use your common-sense you can do iteasily and can keep up the balance without much difficulty. Fatty people have frequent nasty falls,slips and doublings and they excite much laughter amongst the onlookers. Do not bend the legswhen you stretch them.Practise this Asana from 5 to 20 seconds. Those who have good physical strength can do itfor 2 or 3 minutes.Retain the breath when you raise the body. It will give you immense strength. When youfinish the Asana, exhale slowly.61ASANAS"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"MAYURASANABENEFITSThis is a wonderful Asana for improving digestion. It destroys the effects of unwholesomefood, and increases the digestive power. It cures dyspepsia and diseases of the stomach like Gulma(chronic gastritis), and reduces spleenic and liver enlargements by increasing the intra-abdominalpressure. The whole abdominal organs are properly toned and stimulated well by the increase ofintra-abdominal pressure. Sluggishness of liver or hepatic torpidity disappears. It tones the bowelsand removes constipation (ordinary, chronic and habitual). It awakens Kundalini.10. ARDHA MATSYENDRASANAPaschimottanasana and Halasana bend the spine forwards. Dhanur, Bhujanga and SalabhaAsanas are counter-poses to bend the spine backwards. This is not sufficient. It must be twisted andbent from side to side also (lateral movements). Then only perfect elasticity of the spinal columncan be ensured. The Matsyendrasana serves this purpose well in giving a lateral twist to the spinalcolumn.Place the left heel near the anus and below the scrotum. It can touch the perennial space. Donot allow the heel to move from this space. Bend the knee and place the right ankle at the root of theleft thigh and rest the right foot well on the ground close to the left hip-joint. Place the leftaxillaorarm-pit over the top of the vertically bent right knee. Push the knee now a little to the back so that ittouches the back part of theaxilla. Catch hold of the left foot with left palm. Then applying pressureat the left shoulder-joint slowly twist the spine and turn to the extreme right. Turn the face also tothe right as much as you can do. Bring it in a line with the right shoulder. Swing round the right armtowards the back. Catch hold of the left thigh with the right hand. Retain the pose from 5 to 15seconds. Keep the vertebral column erect. Do not bend. Similarly you can twist the spine to the leftside.62KUNDALINI YOGA"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"ARDHA MATSYENDRASANABENEFITSThis Asana increases appetite by increasing the digestive fire. It destroys terrible diseases. Itrouses Kundalini and makes the moon-flow, Chandranadi, steady. Above the root of the palate themoon is said to be located. It drops the cool ambrosial nectar, which is wasted by mixing withgastric fire. But this Asana prevents it.It keeps the spine elastic and gives a good massage to the abdominal organs. Lumbago andall sorts of muscular rheumatism of the back-muscles are cured. The spinal nerve-roots andsympathetic system are toned. They draw a good supply of blood. This Asana is an adjunct toPaschimottanasana.11. VAJRASANA (THE ADAMANTINE POSE)Those who sit in this Asana have a quite steady and firm pose. They cannot be easily shaken.The knees are rendered very hard. Merudanda becomes firm and strong. This Asana resemblesmore or less the Namaz pose in which the Muslims sit for prayer.Keep the soles of the feet on both sides of the anus, i.e., place the thighs on the legs one overthe other and the soles on the buttocks. The calves must touch the thighs. The part from the toe to theknee should touch the ground. The whole burden of the body is put on the knees and ankles. In thebeginning of practice you may feel a slight pain in the knee and ankle-joints but it passes off veryquickly. Massage the painful parts and two joints with the hands. You can use a little Iodex orAmrutanjan for rubbing. After fixing the feet and the knees, put both the hands straight on theknees. Keep the knees quite close. Sit like this keeping the trunk, neck and head in one straight line.63ASANAS"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"This is the most common Asana.

The Nadis, nerves and muscles of the legs and thighs arestrengthened. Myalgia in the knees, legs, toes and thighs disappears. Sciatica vanishes. Flatulenceis removed. Stomach exercises a stimulating, beneficial influence on Kanda, the most vital partfrom which all the Nadis spring.12. URDHVA PADMASANA (ABOVE LOTUS POSE)Perform Sirshasana. Slowly bend the right leg and keep it on the left thigh and keep the leftleg on the right thigh. You must do this very carefully and slowly. If you can stand in Sirshasana formore than 10 or 15 minutes, then you can attempt this. Otherwise you will have a fall and injureyour legs.

When you are established in Asana, thenonly you will derive the benefits of Pranayama.2. Spread a blanket on the floor and practise the Asanas over the blanket. Use a pillow orfour-folded blanket for practising Sirshasana and its varieties.3. Wear a Langotee or Kowpeen when you practise Asanas. You can have a banian on thebody.4. Do not wear spectacles when you do Asanas. They may be broken or they will injure youreyes.5. Those who practise Sirshasana, etc., for a long time, should take light tiffin or a cup ofmilk after finishing the Asanas.6. Be regular in the practice. Those who practise by fits and starts will not derive any benefit.7. Asana should be done on empty stomach in the morning or at least three hours after food.Morning time is best for doing Asanas.8. If the foundation of a building is not properly laid, the superstructure will fall down in notime, even so if a Yogic student has not gained mastery over the Asanas, he cannot successfullyproceed in his higher courses of Yogic practices.65ASANAS"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"9. Japa and Pranayama should go hand in hand with Yoga Asanas. Then only it becomesreal Yoga.10. In the beginning you cannot perform some of the Asanas perfectly. Regular practice willgive perfection. Patience and perseverance, earnestness and sincerity are needed.11. Never change the Asanas. Adhere to one set tenaciously. If you do one set of Asanastoday and some other tomorrow and so on, you cannot derive any benefit.12. The more steady you are on the Asana the more you will be able to concentrate and makeyour mind one-pointed. You cannot get on well in your meditation without having a steady posture.13. Mild Kumbhaka during the practice of Asanas augments the efficacy of Asanas and giveincreased power and vitality to the practitioner.14. Everyone should select a course of a few Asanas to suit his temperament, capacity,convenience, leisure and requirement.15. If you are careful about your diet, Asanas and meditation, you will have fine, lustrouseyes, fair complexion and peace of mind in a short time. Hatha Yoga ensures beauty, strength andspiritual success to the Yogic students.16. A man can sit for 10 hours at one stretch motionless on the Asana and yet he may be fullof desires. This is a mere physical practice like an acrobatic or circus feat. A man without dosing theeyes, without winking, without turning the eye-balls can practise Tratak for three hours and yet hemay be full of desires and egoism. This is also another kind of physical exercise. This has nothing todo with spirituality. People are deceived when they see persons who can do the above practices.Fasting for 40 days is also another kind of training of the physical body.17. Pranayama with Asanas before starting Japa and meditation is very good and conducive.It removes laziness and drowsiness of the body and mind. It steadies the mind also. It fills the mindwith new vigour and peace.18. Asanas can be practised on the sandy bed of rivers, open airy places and by seaside also.If you practise them in a room, see that the room is not congested. You should clean it every day.19. A Vedantin is afraid to do Asanas on the ground that the practice will intensifyDehadhyasa and militate against his practice of Vairagya. I have seen many Vedantins in a sicklycondition with poor physique and dilapidated constitution. They can hardly do any rigid Sadhana.They may utter: “Om Om Om,” mechanically through lips only. They have not sufficient strengthto raise the Brahmakara Vritti.20. The body is closely related to the mind. Sickly, weak body is Jada. The body is animportant instrument for Self-realisation. The instrument must be kept clean, strong and healthy.66KUNDALINI YOGA"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"MUDRAS AND BANDHASEXERCISESMudras and Bandhas are certain postures of the body by which Kundalini is successfullyawakened. In Gheranda Samhita, the description of 25 Mudras and Bandhas, is given. Thefollowing 12 are the most important:—1. Mula Bandha2. Jalandhara Bandha3. Uddiyana Bandha4. Maha Mudra5. Maha Bandha6. Maha Vedha7. Yoga Mudra8. Viparitakarani Mudra9. Khechari Mudra10. Vajroli Mudra11. Shakti Chalana Mudra12. Yoni MudraMany of the above exercises have intimate connection with each other. In one exercise youwill have to combine 2 or 3 Bandhas and Mudras. This you will see when you see the description.Many aspirants are not able to find out the exact technique of several Mudras that are described inHatha Yogic texts, and therefore they could not realise the benefits.Yogic exercises when practised regularly in the right way, will surely bestow on you all thatyou want.Nasti mudrasamam kinchitSiddhidam kshitimandale“There is nothing in this world like Mudras for giving success.”Dyspepsia, constipation, piles, cough, asthma, enlargement of spleen, venereal diseases,leprosy and all sorts of incurable diseases are cured by Mudras and Bandhas. They are the mosteffective exercises for maintaining Brahmacharya, without which nothing can be made in thespiritual path.1. MULA BANDHAPress the Yoni with the left heel. Keep the right heel pressed at the space just above theorgan of generation. Contract the anus and draw the Apana Vayu upwards. This is called MulaBandha. The Apana Vayu which does the function of ejection of excreta has natural tendency tomove downwards. Through the practice of Mula Bandha, the Apana Vayu is made to moveupwards by contracting the anus and by forcibly drawing it upwards. The Prana Vayu is united withthe Apana and the united Prana-Apana Vayu is made to enter the Sushumna Nadi. Then the Yogiattains perfection in Yoga. Kundalini is awakened. The Yogi drinks the Nectar of Immortality. Heenjoys Siva-pada in Sahasrara Chakra. He gets all divine Vibhutis and Aishvarya. When the Apanais united with Prana, Anahata sounds (mystical inner sounds) are heard very distinctly. Prana,Apana, Nada and Bindu unite and the Yogi reaches perfection in Yoga. This highest stage cannot bereached by the first attempt. One should practise this again and again for a long time.67MUDRAS AND BANDHAS"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"The Siddhi in the practice of Pranayama is attained through the help of Bandhas andMudras. The practice of Mula Bandha enables one to keep up perfect Brahmacharya, givesDhatu-Pushti (nerve-vigour), relieves constipation and increases Jatharagni. During the practice ofconcentration, meditation, Pranayama and all other Yogic Kriyas, Mula Bandha can be combined.2. JALANDHARA BANDHAContract the throat. Press the chin firmly against the chest. This Bandha is practised at theend of Puraka and beginning of Kumbhaka. Generally this Bandha is done during Kumbhaka only.The gastric fire, which is situated in the region of Nabhi, consumes the nectar which exudes out ofthe Sahasrara Chakra through the hole in the palate. This Bandha prevents the nectar being thusconsumed.3. UDDIYANA BANDHAThe Sanskrit word “Uddiyana” comes from the root ‘ut’ and ‘di’ which means to “fly up.”When this Bandha is practised the Prana flies up through the Sushumna Nadi. Hence the significantname.Empty the lungs by a strong and forcible expiration. The lungs will become completelyempty when you exhale forcibly through the mouth. Now contract and draw up the intestines aboveand below the navel towards the back, so that the abdomen rests against the back of the body highup in the thoracic cavity. This is Uddiyana Bandha. This is practised at the end of Kumbhaka andbeginning of the Rechaka. When you practise this Bandha, the diaphragm, the muscular portionbetween the thoracic cavity and abdomen, is raised up and the abdominal muscles are drawnbackwards. If you bend your trunk forwards, you can easily do this exercise. Uddiyana Bandha isthe first stage of Nauli Kriya. You should know Uddiyana Bandha if you want to practise NauliKriya. Nauli Kriya is generally done in a standing position. Uddiyana Bandha can be practised in asitting or standing posture. When you do it while standing, keep your hands on the thigh as shown inthe illustration.This exercise helps a lot in keeping up Brahmacharya. It imparts beautiful health, strength,vigour and vitality to the practitioner. When it is combined with Nauli Kriya, it serves as a powerfulgastro-intestinal tonic. These are the two potent weapons of the Yogin to combat againstconstipation, weak peristalsis of the intestines and other disorders of the alimentary canal. It is bythese two Yogic Kriyas alone, that you can manipulate and massage all the abdominal muscles. Forabdominal exercises nothing can compete with Uddiyana Bandha and Nauli. They stand unique andunrivalled amongst all systems of physical exercises. In chronic diseases of stomach and intestines,where drugs of all sorts have failed, Uddiyana and Nauli have effected a rapid, thorough andmarvellous cure.When you practise Pranayama, you can beautifully combine Mula Bandha, JalandharaBandha and Uddiyana Bandha. This is Bandha-Traya.Uddiyana Bandha reduces fat in the belly. In cases where Marienbud reduction pills havefailed to reduce fat, Uddiyana Bandha will work wonders. If fatty persons stop taking ghee and68KUNDALINI YOGA"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"reduce the quantity of drinking water, they will be able to do Uddiyana. A trip toKedar-Badri or Mount Kailas by foot will prepare fatty people for the practice of Uddiyana Bandha.UDDIYANA BANDHA4. MAHA MUDRAThis is the most important of all Mudras. Hence it is called ‘Maha Mudra.’ Press the anuscarefully with the left heel. Stretch out the right leg. Catch hold of the toe with the two hands. Inhaleand retain the breath. Press the chin against the chest firmly (Jalandhara Bandha). Fix the gazebetween the eyebrows (Bhrumadhya Drishti). Retain the posture as long as you can and then exhaleslowly. Practise first on the left leg and then on the right leg.This cures consumption, haemorrhoids or piles, enlargement of spleen, indigestion, Gulma(chronic gastritis), leprosy, constipation, fever and all other diseases. Life is increased. It confersgreat Siddhis on the practitioners. Generally the Yogi does Maha Mudra, Maha Bandha and MahaVedha. This is a good combination. Then only maximum benefits are derived. Do like this six timesin the morning and evening.69MUDRAS AND BANDHAS"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"5. MAHA BANDHAMaha Mudra is the preliminary exercise for this. Press the anus with the left heel. Place theright foot upon the left thigh. Contract the anus and muscles of the perineum. Draw the Apana Vayuupwards. Draw the breath slowly and retain it by Jalandhara Bandha as long as you can. Thenexhale slowly. Practise first on the left side and then on the right side. The Bandha destroys decayand death. The Yogi achieves all his desires and obtains Siddhis.6. MAHA VEDHASit in Maha Bandha posture. Draw the breath slowly. Retain the breath. Press the chinagainst the chest. Place the palms on the ground. Rest the body on the palms. Raise the buttocksslowly and strike them gently against the ground. The Asana must be intact and firm when you raisethe buttocks. This Kriya destroys decay and death. The Yogi gets control over the mind andconquers death. There is not much difference between Maha Mudra, Maha Bandha and MahaVedha. They are something like 3 stages of one exercise.7. YOGA MUDRASit in Padmasana. Place the palms on the heels. Exhale slowly and bend forwards and touchthe ground with the forehead. If you retain the pose for a long time, you can breathe as usual. Orcome to the former position and inhale. Instead of keeping the hands on the heels, you can take themto the back. Catch hold of the left wrist with your right hand. This pose removes all kinds ofdisorders of the abdomen.8. VIPARITAKARANI MUDRALie on the ground. Raise the legs up straight. Support the buttocks with the hands. Rest theelbows on the ground. Remain steady. The sun dwells at the root of the navel and the moon at theroot of the palate. The process by which the sun is brought upward and the moon is carrieddownward is called Viparitakarani Mudra. The positions of the sun and the moon are reversed. Onthe first day do it for a minute. Gradually increase the period to three hours. After six monthswrinkles on the face and grey hair disappear. The Yogin who practises this for three hours dailyconquers death. As the gastric fire is increased, those who practise this Mudra for a long time shouldtake some light refreshment such as milk, etc., as soon as the Kriya is over. Sirshasana posture alsois called Viparitakarani Mudra.9. KHECHARI MUDRA‘Kha’ means Akasa and ‘Chari’ means to move. The Yogi moves in the Akasa. The tongueand the mind remain in the Akasa. Hence this is known as Khechari Mudra.This Mudra can be performed by a man, only if he has undergone the preliminary exerciseunder the direct guidance of a Guru, who is practising Khechari Mudra. The preliminary portion ofthis Mudra is in making the tongue so long that the tip of the tongue might touch the space betweenthe two eyebrows. The Guru will cut the lower tendon of the tongue with a bright, clean knife little70KUNDALINI YOGA"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"by little every week. By sprinkling salt and turmeric powder, the cut edges may not join togetheragain. Cutting the lower tendon of the tongue should be done regularly, once a week, for a period ofsix months. Rub the tongue with fresh butter and draw it out. Take hold of the tongue with thefingers and move it to and fro. Milking the tongue means taking hold of it and drawing it as themilkman does the udder of a cow during milking. By all these means you can lengthen the tongue toreach the forehead. This is the preliminary portion of Khechari Mudra.Then turn the tongue upwards and backwards by sitting in Siddhasana so as to touch thepalate and close the posterior nasal openings with the reversed tongue and fix the gaze on the spacebetween the two eye-brows. Now leaving the Ida and Pingala, Prana will move in the SushumnaNadi. The respiration will stop. The tongue is on the mouth of the well of nectar. This is KhechariMudra.By the practice of this Mudra the Yogi is free from fainting, hunger, thirst and laziness. He isfree from diseases, decay, old age and death. This Mudra makes one an Oordhvaretas. As the bodyof the Yogi is filled with nectar, he will not die even by virulent poison. This Mudra gives Siddhis toYogins. Khechari is the best of all Mudras.10. VAJROLI MUDRAThis is an important Yogic Kriya in Hatha Yoga. You will have to work hard to get fullsuccess in this Kriya. There are very few people who are experts in this act. Yogic students drawwater first through a silver-tube (catheter specially made) passed into the urethra 12 inches inside.After due practice they draw milk, then oil, honey, etc. They draw mercury in the end. Later on theycan draw these liquids directly through the urethra without the help of the silver-tube. This Kriya isof immense use for keeping up perfect Brahmacharya. On the first day you should send the catheterinside the urethra for one inch only, the second day two inches, third day three inches, and so on.You must gradually practise till you are able to send 12 inches of the catheter inside. The waybecomes clear and blowing. Raja Bhartrihari could do this Kriya very dexterously.Even a drop of semen cannot come out of the Yogi who practises this Mudra. Even if it isdischarged, he can draw it back through this Mudra. The Yogi, who draws his semen up andpreserves it, conquers death. Good smell emanates from his body.The late Trilingaswami of Varanasi was an expert in this Kriya. Sri Swami Kuvalayanandajiof Lonavala teaches this Mudra.Some persons call the Mayurasana Vajroli Mudra. Again Vajroli Mudra is also known asYoni Mudra. However, the description of Yoni Mudra is given separately.The object of Vajroli Mudra is to be perfectly established in Brahmacharya. When aspirantspractise this Mudra, they unconsciously divert their mind to sexual centres and thereby they cannotget any success. When you see the description of this Mudra, you will clearly understand that strictBrahmacharya is absolutely necessary. For practising this there is no necessity at all for a woman orfor any sexual intercourse. Since the Grihasthas have their wives and because they think that VajroliMudra is a device for birth-control, they have a keen desire to practise this Mudra. It is all mere71MUDRAS AND BANDHAS"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"foolishness and delusion. They have not understood the technique and object of this importantKriya.Practice of Mula Bandha, Maha Bandha, Maha Mudra, Asanas, Pranayamas, etc., willnaturally enable one to understand and to get success in the practice of Vajroli. This must be doneunder the direct guidance of a Guru.11. SHAKTI CHALANA MUDRASit in a secluded room in Siddhasana. Draw in the air forcibly and join it with Apana. DoMula Bandha till the Vayu enters the Sushumna. By retaining the air, the Kundalini, feelingsuffocated, awakes and finds its way through Sushumna to Brahmarandhra.Sit in Siddhasana. Take hold of the foot near the ankle and slowly beat the Kanda with thefoot. This is Tadana Kriya. By this method also Kundalini can be awakened. Through the practiceof this Mudra one can become a Siddha.12. YONI MUDRASit in Siddhasana. Close the ears with the two thumbs, eyes with the index-fingers, nostrilswith the middle-fingers, the upper lips with the ring-fingers and the lower lips with the little fingers.This is a beautiful pose for doing Japa. Dive deep and meditate on the Shat Chakras and Kundalini.This is not quite easy for all like other Mudras. You have to exert much in getting success in this.You must be perfectly established in Brahmacharya if you want sure success. “Devanamapidurlabha”—very difficult to be obtained even by Devas. Therefore realise the importance of thisMudra and practise it very cautiously. Vajroli Mudra also is called Yoni Mudra.OTHER MUDRASThere are Sambhavi, Manduki, Aswini, Tadagi, Matangini, Bhuchari, Aghori and variousother Mudras. Here I have told you only the important Mudras. For the instructions of all theMudras, refer to my book “Hatha Yoga.”INSTRUCTIONS ON MUDRAS AND BANDHAS1. Maha Mudra, Maha Bandha and Maha Vedha form one group. They are something likethree stages of one exercise. Similarly Mula Bandha, Uddiyana Bandha and Jalandhara Bandhaform another group. Mula Bandha is practised during Puraka, Kumbhaka, Rechaka and duringmeditation and Japa also. Uddiyana Bandha is practised during Rechaka and Jalandhara Bandhaduring Kumbhaka.2. As in the case of other Yogic Kriyas, Mudras and Bandhas also should be practised whenthe stomach is empty. General instructions that are given for Asanas and Pranayamas should befollowed for the practice of Mudras.72KUNDALINI YOGA"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"3. The benefits that are given may not be realised by the practice of Mudras alone. You willhave to combine Pranayamas, Asanas, Japa and other Yogic Kriyas.4. Khechari Mudra should be done under the direct guidance of a Khechari Guru. Cuttingthe lower tendon should be carefully done at regular intervals. Aspirants may not be successful inthis Kriya if they begin after 25 years of age when the muscles and nerves have become stiff.5. Khechari, Shakti Chalana, Vajroli and other advanced courses should not be practised byall. The aspirants should ascertain from the Guru if they are fit for such advanced exercises and alsothey should see if they have all other requirements for the practice.6. Uddiyana Bandha is also called Tadagi Mudra. Seet-Krama and Vyut-Krama describedon page 39 are called Matangini Mudra. Do Mula Bandha. Release it. Again and again do like this.It is termed Aswini Mudra.7. Those who have not undergone the preliminary portion of Khechari Mudra (making thetongue long) can simply keep the tongue turned upwards on the palate. This is Nabho Mudra orManduki Mudra.8. Real success in Mudras can be had only if there is intense concentration of mind. Adetailed instruction on concentration will be given in the subsequent pages.MISCELLANEOUS EXERCISESLAYA YOGALaya is the state of mind when one forgets all the objects of senses and gets absorbed in theobject of meditation. Laya enables one to have perfect control over the five Tattvas, mind andIndriyas. The fluctuations of mind will stop. The mind, body and Prana will be entirely subdued.For Laya Yoga, Sambhavi Mudra is an effective method, in which one intently concentrateson any one of the Shat Chakras. Trataka exercise plays a vital part in getting success in Laya. In duecourse of practice, the Yogin gets established in Samadhi. He becomes a Jivanmukta.ANAHATA SOUNDSAnahata sounds are the mystic sounds heard by the Yogin during his meditation. It is a signof the purification of Nadis. Some students can clearly hear it through any one of the ears and someby both the ears. There are loud as well as subtle sounds. From the loud, one will have tocontemplate on the subtle and from the subtle to the subtler. Beginners can hear the sound onlywhen the ears are closed. Advanced students can concentrate on the Anahata sound even withoutclosing the ears. Anahata sound is also termed Omkara Dhvani. They proceed from the Anahatacentre of the Sushumna Nadi.73MUDRAS AND BANDHAS"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Sit in your usual Asana. Close the ears with the thumbs. Hear and minutely observe theinternal sound through the ears. The sound that you hear from within will make you deaf to allexternal sounds. Close the eyes also. In the beginning of your practice, you will hear many loudsounds. Later on they are heard in a mild way. The mind having at first concentrated itself on anyone sound fixes firmly to that and is absorbed in it. The mind becoming insensible to the externalimpressions, becomes one with the sound as milk with water and then becomes rapidly absorbed inChidakasa. Just as the bee drinking the honey alone does not care for the odour so also the Chitta,which is always absorbed in the inner sound, does not long for sensual objects, as it is bound by thesweet smell or Nada and has abandoned its flitting nature.The sound proceeding from Pranava Nada, which is Brahman, is of the nature of effulgence.The mind gets absorbed in it. The mind exists so long as there is sound, but with its cessation, thereis that state termed Turiya. It is the supreme state. It is the Unmani state. The mind gets absorbedalong with Prana by constant concentration upon Nada. The body appears to be a log of wood and itdoes not feel heat or cold, joy or sorrow. Different kinds of sounds proceed from the heart (Anahatasounds).Nada that is heard through the ears is of ten kinds. The first is the sound ‘Chini’ (like thepronunciation of the word); the second is ‘Chini-chini’; the third is the sound of a bell; the fourth isthat of a conch; the fifth is that of a lute; the sixth is the sound of cymbals; the seventh is the tune of aflute; the eighth is the voice of a drum (Bheri); the ninth is the sound of a double-drum (Mridanga);and the tenth is the sound of thunder.You cannot expect the sound immediately after you close your ears. You should concentrateand keep your mind one-pointed. The particular sound that you hear today, you may not hear everyday. But you will hear any one of the ten Anahata sounds.The description given above is Laya through Nada, Anahata sound. In the same manner,Laya can be effected by concentration at the tip of the nose (Nasikagra Drishti), at the spacebetween the two eyebrows (Bhrumadhya Drishti), meditation on the five Tattvas, on SohamMantra, Aham Brahma Asmi, Tat Tvam Asi Mahavakyas and other methods also.BHAKTI YOGA—CLASSES OF WORSHIPAt the lowest rung of the ladder of Bhakti Yoga comes the worship of elements and departedspirits. This is the lowest form of worship. Next comes the worship of Rishis, Devas and Pitris. Thefaith of each is shaped according to his own nature. The man consists of that which his faith is, he iseven that. The third class includes those followers who worship Avataras like Sri Rama, Krishna,Narasimha. The above four classes of Bhaktas have the Saguna form of worship. Next comes theclass of Bhaktas who do Nirguna Upasana on Brahman devoid of attributes. This is the highest formof worship that is suitable for the intelligent people who have strong will and bold understanding.This is known as Ahamgraha Upasana or Jnana Yoga Sadhana.Bhakti can be acquired and cultivated. Practice of the Nava Vidha Bhakti (nine methods ofdevotion) will infuse Bhakti. Constant Satsanga, Japa, Prayer, meditation, Svadhyaya, Bhajan,74KUNDALINI YOGA"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"service to saints, Dana, Yatra, etc., will develop Bhakti.

These Bhaktas were Yoga-Bhrashtas. They came into this world with a great asset ofspiritual Samskaras. They worshipped God in several births with sincere devotion. They did not domuch Sadhana in their final incarnation. This devotion was natural and spontaneous in them onaccount of the force of previous Samskaras of Bhakti. Ordinary people should adopt drastic, specialmeasures and do special Sadhana for developing Bhakti rapidly. New grooves, new channels haveto be cut in the old stony, devotionless heart to a maximum degree. Through constant prayer, Japa,Kirtan, service to Bhaktas, charity, Vrata, Tapas, Dhyana and Samadhi a Bhakta should raise hisconsciousness to a high degree and acquire Para Bhakti, highest knowledge and Supreme peace. Inthe advanced stages of meditation, the meditator and the meditated, the worshipper and theworshipped, the Upasaka and the Upasya will become one. Dhyana will terminate in Samadhi.Constant and regular practice is necessary.A Hatha Yogi reaches the highest stage by the practice of various Mudras, Bandhas, Asanasand other exercises; a Jnani by the practice of Sravana, Manana and Nididhyasana; a Karma Yoginby the selfless works (Nishkama Seva); a Bhakta by developing Bhakti and self-surrender, and aRaja Yogi by deep concentration and manipulation of the mind. The Goal is the same in all casesbut the methods are different.75MISCELLANEOUS EXERCISES"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Concentration and meditation on the primordial energy, Shakti, is only a modification ofJnana Yogic Sadhana. Concentration and meditation on the different centres of energy belongs toRaja Yoga. Concentration at the different Chakras and Nadis and awakening the Shakti throughphysical methods belong to Hatha Yoga. Concentration and meditation on the Devata, presidingdeity of the different inner Chakras, may be taken as an advanced course in Bhakti Yoga. For quicksuccess, different methods of Sadhana should be combined.The Bhakta when he meditates on the presiding deity or Devata, imagines a particular formof God at each Chakra. In books of Mantra Shastra, elaborate descriptions of God and the Devatasare given for each Chakra. According to the temperament of the students they take the form of Godin a different way. The experiences and feelings of the aspirants vary in all cases. Therefore I am notgiving the descriptions of all the Devas and Devatas. When a man closes his eyes and meditates onthe inner Chakras, he gets various visions and sees the different forms of God. That is the best towhich he should cling. Then only real growth is possible. The general information that is given inthe theoretical portion of this Kundalini Yoga will surely help a lot in concentration and meditationon the Chakras.MANTRASAwakening Kundalini is effected by Mantra also. It is a portion of Bhakti Yoga. Someaspirants should repeat the Mantra given by their Guru even lakhs of times. During the time ofDiksha of an Uttama Adhikari, the Guru utters a particular Mantra and Kundalini is awakenedimmediately. The consciousness of the student is raised to a very high degree. This depends uponthe faith of the student in his Guru and in the Mantra. Mantras, when received from the Guru inperson, are very powerful. Aspirants in Kundalini Yoga should take to this Mantra Sadhana onlyafter getting a proper Mantra from a Guru. Therefore I am not touching this point in detail. Mantraswhen learnt through ordinary friends or through books cannot produce any benefit at all. Mantrasare numerous and the Guru should select a particular Mantra by which the consciousness of aparticular student can be awakened.EIGHT MAJOR SIDDHISAn accomplished, Purnayogi in the path of Kundalini Yoga is in possession of eight majorSiddhis, viz., Anima, Mahima, Laghima, Garima, Prapti, Prakamya, Vasitvam and Ishitvam.1.Anima: The Yogi can become as minute as he pleases.2.Mahima: This is the opposite of Anima. He can become as big as he likes. He can makehis body assume a very large size. He can fill up the whole universe. He can assume a ViratSvarupa.3.Laghima: He can make his body as light as cotton or feather. Vayustambhanam is donethrough this Siddhi. In Jalastambhanam also the power is exercised to a very small degree. Thebody is rendered light by Plavini Pranayama. The Yogi produces a diminution of his specificgravity by swallowing large draughts of air. The Yogi travels in the sky with the help of this Siddhi.He can travel thousands of miles in a minute.76KUNDALINI YOGA"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"4.Garima: This is the opposite of Laghima. In this the Yogi acquires an increase of specificgravity. He can make the body as heavy as a mountain by swallowing draughts of air.5.Prapti: The Yogi standing on the earth can touch the highest things. He can touch the sunor the moon or the sky.

He can understand unknown languages also. He can cure all diseases.6.Prakamya: He can dive into the water and can come out at any time he likes. The lateTrilinga Swami of Benares used to live for six months underneath the Ganges. It is the process bywhich a Yogi makes himself invisible sometimes. By some writers it is defined to be the power ofentering body of another (Parakaya Pravesh). Sri Sankara entered the body of Raja Amaruka ofBenares. Tirumular in Southern India entered the body of a shepherd. Raja Vikramaditya also didthis. It is also the power of keeping a youth-like appearance for any length of time. Raja Yayati hadthis power.7.Vashitvam: This is the power of taming wild animals and bringing them under control. Itis the power of mesmerising persons by the exercise of will and of making them obedient to one’sown wishes and orders. It is the restraint of passions and emotions. It is the power to bring men,women and the elements under subjection.8.Ishitvam: It is the attainment of divine power. The Yogi becomes the Lord of the universe.The Yogi who has this power can restore life to the dead. Kabir, Tulsidas, Akalkot Swami andothers had this power of bringing back life to the dead.MINOR SIDDHISThe Yogi acquires the following minor Siddhis also:1. Freedom from hunger and thirst.2. Freedom from the effects of heat and cold.3. Freedom from Raga-Dvesha.4. Doora Darshan, clairvoyance or Dooradrishti.5. Doora Sravan, clairaudience or Doora Sruti and Doora Pravachana.6.

He can point out the place where a hidden treasure lies.POWER OF A YOGIA Yogi forgets the body in order to concentrate the mind on the Lord. He conquers heat andcold by mastering breath-control and by controlling his nervous system.A Yogi generates psychic heat in the body through the practice of Bhastrika Pranayama.He can bear extremes of climates without discomfort.78KUNDALINI YOGA"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"He sits on the snow and melts it by the warmth generated in his body.A Yogi covers his body with a sheet dipped in very cold water and dries it by the Yoga heatgiven off from his body. A few adepts have dried as many as thirty sheets in a single night.A perfect Yogi cremates his body in the end by the Yogic heat generated by his power ofYoga.INSTRUCTIONS ON SIDDHIS1. By the process of Hatha Yoga, the Yogi attains perfect physical body—RupalavanyaBala Vajrasam-hanana Kaya Sampat. “The perfection of the body consists in beauty, grace,strength and adamantine hardness.” The power to bear extreme cold and heat (Titiksha), the powerto live without water and food and other powers come under the category of Kaya Sampat(perfection of body).2. Since the body of the Hatha Yogi is perfect and firm, his mind also is firm andone-pointed. By the practices of Dharana and Dhyana, he reaches the highest rung in the Yogicladder and attains Immortality through Yogic Samadhi. The Yogi who has reached the higheststage, will have the 8 major and all the minor Siddhis.3. Attainment of powers depends upon the amount of concentration at different Chakras andTattvas and awakening of Kundalini. The practice of Mudras, Bandhas, Asanas and Pranayamaswill also help a lot in acquiring Siddhis.4. The Siddhis that are obtained by the practice of Mudras can be obtained by the practice ofBandhas, Asanas, Pranayamas and also by the concentration on different Chakras. That dependsupon the temperament and capacity of the aspirants. One can obtain the desired goal by one exerciseand others by different methods. Therefore if one is not able to get success by a particular exercise,he will have to have recourse to other exercises.5. Many of the 8 major Siddhis are not possible at all at the present age (Kali Yuga), whenthe body and mind of the vast majority are not fit enough. Even today there are several Siddhas whohave the power to perform some of the Siddhis. When people approach them to do this and that,they hide themselves or generally say:—“I do not know.” They are not much particular about theseSiddhis. Their aim is to ignore these as unreal and aspire to reach the highest. They are the only realYogins. Many are able to use some powers and they do not know how they are able to do them.6. One can read the thoughts of others. A man in London hears the spiritual message ofsages in India. You have seen several persons removing the poison of cobras by chanting someMantras or by mere touch. By giving some sort of leaves, incurable diseases are cured. There aremen who will very accurately tell your past, present and future. Some are able to see astral entities.Stopping the functions of the heart and changing the mind of others and other powers are due toYogic practices.79MISCELLANEOUS EXERCISES"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"7. Nowadays you cannot find a man who has developed all the powers. When one getscertain powers, he stops there by the influence of Maya and false Tushti (satisfaction) and uses thepowers for his livelihood or for fame. Therefore he is not able to proceed further and attainperfection. It is not the mistake of the Yogic Kriyas. You should not lose faith. Faith, attention,sincerity and earnestness will lead you to success.DHARANA (CONCENTRATION)1. Fix the mind on some object either within the body or outside. Keep it there steady forsome time. This is Dharana. You will have to practise this daily. Laya-Yoga has its basis onDharana.2. Purify the mind first through the practice of Yama, Niyama and then take to the practiceof Dharana. Concentration without purity is of no use. There are some occultists who haveconcentration. But they have no good character. That is the reason why they do not make anyprogress in the spiritual line.3. He who has a steady Asana and has purified the Yoga Nadis will be able to concentrateeasily. Concentration will be intense if you remove all distractions. A true Brahmachari, who haspreserved his Veerya, will have wonderful concentration.4. Some foolish, impatient students take to Dharana at once without undergoing thepreliminary ethical training. This is a serious blunder. Ethical perfection is of paramountimportance.5. You can concentrate internally on any one of the seven Chakras and externally on anyDevata, Hari, Krishna or Devi.6. Attention plays a prominent part in concentration. He who has developed his power ofattention will have good concentration. A man who is filled with passion and all sorts of fantasticdesires, can hardly concentrate on any object even for a second. His mind will be jumping like amonkey.7. He who has gained Pratyahara (withdrawing the senses from the objects) will have a goodconcentration. You will have to march in the spiritual path step by step, stage by stage. Lay thefoundation of Yama, Niyama, Asana, Pranayama and Pratyahara to start with. The super-structureof Dharana and Dhyana will be successful only then.8. You should be able to visualise very clearly the object of concentration even in itsabsence. You must call up the mental picture at a moment’s notice. If you have good practice inconcentration, you can do this without much difficulty.9. In the beginning stage of practice, you can concentrate on the tick-tick sound of a watchor on the flame of the candle or on any other object that is pleasing to the mind. This is concreteconcentration. There can be no concentration without something upon which the mind may rest.80KUNDALINI YOGA"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"The mind can be fixed on a pleasant object. It is very difficult in the beginning to fix the mind on anyobject which it dislikes.10. If you want to increase your power of concentration you will have to reduce yourworldly activities. You will have to observe Mouna everyday for two hours or even more.11. Practise concentration till the mind is well established on the object of concentration.When the mind runs away from the object, bring it back again.12. When concentration is deep and intense, all other senses cannot operate. He whopractises concentration for one hour daily has tremendous psychic powers. He will have a strongwill-power.13. Vedantins try to fix the mind on Atman. This is their Dharana. Hatha Yogins and RajaYogins concentrate their mind on the six Chakras. Bhaktas concentrate on their Ishta Devata. Otherobjects of meditation are described under Trataka and Laya Yoga. Concentration is necessary forall the aspirants.14. Those who practise concentration evolve quickly. They can do any work with greaterefficiency in no time. What others can do in six hours can be done easily in half an hour by one whohas a concentrated mind. Concentration purifies and calms the surging emotions, strengthens thecurrent of thought and clarifies the ideas. Concentration keeps a man in his material progress also.He will turn out very good work in his office or business-house. What was cloudy and hazy before,becomes clearer and definite; What was very difficult before becomes easy now; and what wascomplex, bewildering and confusing before, comes easily within the mental grasp. You can achieveanything by concentration. Nothing is impossible for one who regularly practises concentration.Clairvoyance, clairaudience, mesmerism, hypnotism, thought-reading, music, mathematics andother sciences depend upon concentration.15. Retire into a quiet room. Close your eyes. See what happens when you think of an apple.You may think of its colour, shape, size, different parts such as skin, pulp, seeds, etc. You may thinkof the places, Australia or Kashmir, wherefrom it is imported. You may think of its acidic or sweettaste and its effects on the digestive system and blood. Through the law of association, ideas ofsome other fruits also may try to enter. The mind may begin to entertain some other extraneousideas. It may begin to wander. It may think of meeting a friend at the Railway Station at 4 p.m. Itmay think of purchasing a towel or a tin of tea or biscuits. You should try to have a definite line ofthought. There should not be any break in the line of thinking. You must not entertain any otherthought which is not connected with the subject on hand. The mind will try its level best to run in itsold grooves. You will have to struggle hard in the beginning. The attempt is somewhat like going upa steep hill. You will rejoice and feel immense happiness when you get success in concentration.16. Just as laws of gravitation, cohesion, etc., operate in the physical plane, so also definitelaws of thought such as laws of association, relativity, contiguity, etc., operate in the mental planeor thought-world. Those who practise concentration should thoroughly understand these laws.When the mind thinks of an object, it may think of its qualities and its parts also. When it thinks of acause it may think of its effect also.81MISCELLANEOUS EXERCISES"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"17. If you read with concentration Bhagavad Gita or the Vicar of Wakefield several times,you can get new ideas each time. Through concentration you will get insight. Subtle esotericmeanings will flash out in the field of mental consciousness. You will understand the inner depth ofphilosophical significance.18. When you concentrate on an object do not wrestle with the mind. Avoid tensionanywhere in the body. Think gently of the object in a continuous manner. It is very difficult topractise concentration when one is very hungry and when one is suffering from an acute disease.19. If emotions disturb you during concentration, do not mind them. They will pass awaysoon. If you try to drive them away you will have to tax your will-force. Have an indifferentattitude. To drive the emotions away, the Vedantin uses the formula: “I am a Sakshi of the mentalmodifications. I don’t care. Get out”. The Bhakta simply prays, and help comes from God.20. Train the mind in concentrating on various objects, gross and subtle, of various sizes. Incourse of time a strong habit will be formed. The moment you sit for concentration, the mood willcome at once, quite easily.21. When you read a book you must read with concentration. There is no use of skippingover the pages in a hurried manner. Read one page. Close the book. Concentrate on what you haveread. Find out parallel lines in Gita, Upanishads, etc.22. For a neophyte the practice of concentration is disgusting and tiring in the beginning. Hehas to cut new grooves in the mind and brain. After some time, say two or three months, he getsgreat interest. He enjoys a new kind of happiness. Concentration is the only way to get rid of themiseries and tribulations. Your only duty is to achieve concentration and through concentration toattain the final beatitude, Self-realisation. Charity and Rajasuya Yajna are nothing when comparedwith concentration.23. When desires arise in the mind, do not try to fulfil them. Reject them as soon as theyarise. Thus by gradual practice the desires can be reduced. The modifications of the mind will alsodiminish a lot.24. You must get rid of all sorts of mental weakness, superstitions, false and wrongSamskaras. Then only you will be able to concentrate your mind.82KUNDALINI YOGA"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Chapter FourYOGA ADDENDA1. SADASIVA BRAHMANSri Sadasiva Brahman, a reputed Yogi, lived in Nerur, near Karur, in Trichinopolly district,some one hundred and twenty years ago. He was the author of ‘Atma Vilas’, ‘Brahma Sutras’ andvarious other works. Once he was in Samadhi. The floods in the Cauveri river covered him up withmud. For some months his body remained buried underneath the earth. The agriculturists tilled theland and injured the head of the Yogi. Some blood oozed out. They were quite astonished. They dugout the earth. Sadasiva Brahman got up from his Samadhi and walked away. Once some rudepeople came with sticks to beat him. They raised their hands, but they were not able to move them.They remained like statues. At some other time he entered the Zenana of a Nawab quite naked whilehe was roaming about as an Avadhuta. The Nawab got enraged and cut off his hand with a big knife.Sadasiva Brahman went away with a laugh. The Nawab thought that the man should be a greatSage. He took the maimed hand and followed the Sage. On the third day the Nawab said: “O myLord! I cut off your hand due to my foolishness. Kindly forgive me.” Sadasiva simply touched thecut portion with the other hand. There was a new hand. Sadasiva forgave the Nawab and blessedhim.2. JNANADEVSri Jnanadev is also known as Jnaneswar. He was the greatest Yogin the world has everproduced. He was born in Alandi, 7 miles from Poona. His Samadhi is there even now. If anybodyreads the Gita written by him by the side of the Samadhi all the doubts are cleared. He is regarded asan Avatara of Lord Krishna. When he was a boy he simply touched a buffalo. It repeated the Vedas.He had full control over the elements. When there was no vessel to prepare food, his sister preparedbread on his back. He entered Samadhi while alive at the age of 22. He drew up all the Prana to theBrahmarandhra and gave up the physical body. When he was a boy of 14 years, he began to writecommentary on Gita. His commentary on Gita is considered one of the best. In a big assembly ofSanskrit Pandits in Benares, he was selected President.3. TRILINGA SWAMISri Trilinga Swami of Benares, born in Andhra Desa, lived some fifty years ago. He livedfor 280 years. He made his Tapas in Manasarovar (Tibet). Once Ramakrishna Paramahamsa alsosaw him at Benares. He brought some money to Benares when he first came in for Tapas. Heopened a milk-shop and distributed milk free to poor persons, Sadhus and Sannyasins. He used tolive underneath the Ganga water even for six months continuously. He used to sleep in KashiVisvanath’s Temple keeping his feet over the Sivalinga. Once he caught hold of the sword of theGovernor and threw it into the Ganges. When the Governor demanded it back, he dived into thewater and brought back two swords and the Governor was unable to find out his own sword. Somemischief-makers poured some lime-water in his mouth.

In Chandragiri village on thebanks of the Godavari, there was a Brahmin named Suraj. His wife’s name was Sarasvati. They hadno children. Yogi Matsyendranath went for Bhiksha in the house of Suraj. Sarasvati entertained theYogi with good food, with Sraddha. She wept before him for not having a child. YogiMatsyendranath gave her a pinch of holy ash with blessings for a child. Some time later, she had ason. Matsyendranath came back to Sarasvati and took the boy with him when he was twelve yearsof age. He sent the boy to Badrinarayan for doing Tapas. Apsaras and other Devatas came to molesthim. He stood firm and tided over all temptations. He got tremendous Siddhis. Matsyendranath alsoimparted all his powers and Vidyas to the boy, his disciple, Gorakhnath.Sri Gorakhnath in his 12th year went to Badrinarayan and performed Tapas for 12 longyears, living on air alone. Gorakhnath had tremendous Yogic powers. When his GuruMatsyendranath entered the dead body of a Raja (Parakaya Pravesh) to obey the orders of SriHanuman to produce an offspring for a certain Rani, Gorakhnath assumed the form of a ladythrough his Yogic powers and entered the inner apartments of the palace (Kamarupa Siddhi). Atsome other instance he made a toy child out of clay and gave this as a play-mate for the children of acertain village. He converted a portion of a mountain into gold and reconverted it to its formercondition. He passed urine on a rock. It became gold. Once in a Kumbhamela on the banks of theGodavari, he gave food to all by spreading only leaves but offered different rich meals to the likingof everyone. In the same Mela he slowly reduced himself in bulk and assumed the form of amosquito (Anima Siddhi). Through his own Yogic power he burnt himself to ashes and againassumed his original form. He did Akasagamanam (walking in the sky). In this way he performedmany Siddhis. Raja Bhartrihari was his disciple.5. SWAMI KRISHNA ASHRAMSwami Krishna Ashram is a living saint at Daroli village, 14 miles below Gangotri, theorigin of the Ganges. He has been living there for the last eight years in an absolutely nude state, inan icy region, where an ordinary man may require a woollen sweater, a Gothma and half a dozenblankets. He was a Siva Bhakta. He threw away all his Puja-vessels, went to Varanasi, tookSannyasa and lived there for a year. Then he went to Hardwar, threw off the Danda and became anAvadhuta. He was in Uttarkashi also. When sharp, big flies were biting his body, when blood wasemerging profusely, he would never disturb the flies. Such was his power of endurance. Once in theKshetra an arrogant servant insulted him for not bringing any vessel for Dhal and poured very hotDhal on his hands. Swami Krishna Ashram drank the Dhal though his lips and hands were scalded.There is another Swami by name Bhuma Ashram, living at Daroli in a nude state. He is a friend ofKrishna Ashram.Titiksha, the power of endurance, is an essential attribute of all Sadhakas. This is one of thesixfold virtues of Sadhana Chatushtaya.

There he saw the dead body of acaretaker of a herd of cows. He noticed that all the cows surrounded the dead body of the cowherdand were crying bitterly. This touched the heart of Tirumular. He pitied the cows very much. He lefthis body in a certain place and entered the dead body of the cowherd. He looked after the cowsthroughout the day and sent them back to their respective houses. The wife of the cowherd, who wasnot aware of the death of her husband, invited Tirumular who was wearing the physical body of herhusband. Tirumular refused. He wanted to enter his own body. When he searched for his body, itwas not found in the original place. Then he thought it was all the grace of Lord Siva. Then with thebody of the cowherd, he went to Avaduturai and sat underneath an Asvattha tree on the western sideof the temple and wrote a valuable book called “Tirumantram” in Tamil. It is a book of 3000 verseswhich contain the essence of the Vedas.8. MANSOORMansoor was a Sufist Brahma-Jnani. He lived in Persia, some four hundred years ago. Hewas repeating always “Anal-haq! Anal-haq!” This corresponds to “Soham” or “Aham BrahmaAsmi” of the Vedantins. People reported to the Badshah that Mansoor was an atheist (Kafir) andthat he was always uttering “Anal-haq.” The Badshah was quite enraged. He ordered that Mansoormust be cut into pieces. His orders were obeyed. Even then the pieces of flesh were uttering“Anal-haq.” He felt no pain as he was a full-blown Samadhi Jnani and as he had full identificationwith Brahman. He was above body-consciousness. Then they put the pieces of flesh and bones inthe fire and reduced them into ashes. Even then the ashes uttered “Anal-haq.” During his life-timehe performed many miracles. Even Jnanis can do miracles if they desire and if they find it necessaryfor the occasion. Sadasiva Brahman and other Jnanis did wonders. Remember the lives of great mendaily. You will advance in the spiritual path.85YOGA ADDENDA"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"9. MILAREPAMilarepa was one who had been profoundly impressed from his youth by the transient andimpermanent nature of all conditions of worldly existence and by the sufferings and wretchednessin which he saw all beings immersed. To him existence seemed like a huge furnace where all livingcreatures were roasting. With such piercing sorrow did this fill his heart that he was unable to feeleven any of the celestial felicity enjoyed by Brahma and Indra in their heavens, much less of theearthly joys and delights afforded by a life of worldly greatness.On the other hand, he was so captivated by the vision of immaculate purity, by the chastebeauty in the description of the state of perfect freedom and omniscience associated with theattainment of Nirvana, that he cared not even though he might lose his very life in the search onwhich he had set out, endowed as he was with full faith, keen intellect and a heart overflowing withall-pervading love and sympathy to all.Having obtained transcendental knowledge in the control of the ethereal and spiritual natureof the mind, he was enabled to furnish demonstration thereof by flying through the sky, by walking,resting and sleeping on the air. Likewise he was able to produce flames of fire and springs of waterfrom his body and to transform his body at will into any object desired, thereby convincingunbelievers and turning them towards religious pursuits.He was perfect in the practice of the four stages of meditation and thus he was able to projecthis subtle body so as to be present as the presiding Yogi in twenty-four holy places where gods andangels assemble, like clouds for spiritual communion.He was able to dominate gods and elementals and make them carry out his commandsinstantaneously, in the fulfilment of all duties. He was a perfect adept in supernatural powers. Hewas able to transverse and visit all the innumerable sacred paradises and heavens of the Buddhas,where by virtue of his all-absorbing acts of unsurpassed devotion the Buddhas and Bodhisattvaspresiding therein favoured him with discourses on Dharma and listened to his in return, so that hesanctified the heaven-worlds by his visits and sojourns there.10. NAPOLEON BONAPARTENapoleon Bonaparte was a man of great concentration. His success was all due to the powerof concentration. He suffered from various diseases as epileptic fits, Brady cardia, etc. But for thesemaladies, he would have proved still more powerful. He could sleep at any time he liked. He wouldsnore the very moment he retired to bed. He would get up at the very second of the appointed time.This is a kind of Siddhi. He had no Vikshepa or shilly-shallying. He had the highly developedEkagrata of a Yogi. He could draw, as it were, any single thought from the brain pigeon-hole, dwellon it as long as he liked and could shove it back when finished. He would sleep very soundly at nightamidst busy war, would never worry a bit at night. This was all due to his power of concentration.Concentration can do anything. Without concentration of mind nothing can be achieved.Messrs. Gladstone and Balfour had a great deal of concentration of mind. The very momentthey retired to bed, they would get sleep. Mark the word “very moment”. They would never toss86KUNDALINI YOGA"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"about for 15 or 20 minutes in the bed as in the case of the worldly persons. Think how difficult it isto enter into deep sleep the very moment you lie down. They had perfect control over sleep. Theycould also get up from bed at any time they wished without any alarm time-piece. Sleeping andgetting up at the appointed second is only an example to show the power of concentration to acertain degree. There are people who, after a day’s hard work, can sleep the very moment they go tobed; but they cannot get up at the appointed time. This is only an example on a very ordinary thing.People of concentration can work wonders and miracles.11. TEACHINGS OF KABIROnce Kabir tied a stout pig to the front post in the verandah of his house. An orthodoxBrahmin Pundit came to Kabir’s house for discussing a philosophical problem. He saw the pig infront of the house. He was much upset, irritated and annoyed. He asked Kabir:—“Dear Sir, how is ityou have tied a nasty animal that eats the excreta of human beings, very close to your house. Youhave no Achara. You are a dirty man. You do not know the Shastras. You are ignorant”. Kabirreplied:—“O Shastriji, you are more dirty than myself. I have tied the pig to the front post outsidemy house, whereas you have tied the pig to the mind”. The Brahmin was very much vexed and wentaway without telling a word.Man changa katorie me ganga: “If the mind is pure, you will find theGanges in the cup”. Purification of mind is of paramount importance. Without this nothing can beachieved in the spiritual path.12. A SHAM LATIN SCHOLARA certain man went to a Latin teacher to learn Latin. He stayed with the teacher for a week.He noticed that most of the words ended in ‘o’. He thought that he must add the letter ‘o’ to the endof each word. He knew English well. He told the teacher that he knew Latin and with the permissionof the teacher, he went back to his native place. He reached his house and tapped the door utteringthese words:—“O, dear-o, wife-o, open-o, door-o”. He thought this was all Latin.There are very many scholars in Yoga and Vedanta also similar to the learned Latin scholar,above narrated. They stay for a few days in Ram Ashram Library or with some Sadhus, learn thenames Kundalini, Mula Chakra, Nadi, Pranayama, Maya, or Pratibimbavada and move from placeto place. Yoga and Vedanta are philosophies that are to be studied under a Guru with great interestfor a period of 12 years. Then only one can master the subjects. Yoga and Vedanta should not beused as a means for livelihood. After learning a few words in Yoga and Vedanta, one should not goabout and mix with the worldly people. Attaining perfection in Yoga requires a long practicalexperience under a perfect guide.13. STORY OF AN ASPIRANTAn aspirant went to a Mahant of Gorakhnath Panth. Gorakhnath-followers are those whowear either big black celluloid or glass earrings. The Mahant bored the aspirant’s ears, inserted bigearrings and gave him a beautiful name also, Yogi Ishvarananda. He remained in the Ashram forthree months. He did not get any spiritual progress. He thought to himself:—“This is not the properpath. Let me try another path.” He left the Ashram immediately, wandered through thick jungles,came across a Fakir and implored for initiation. The Fakir circumcised, gave him a Mantra and87YOGA ADDENDA"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"asked him to have a long beard. This also did not satisfy him. Now look at the pitiable condition ofthis poor aspirant. The ulcers in the ears had not healed up properly. He had considerable painthrough septic inflammation. There was profuse discharge of pus. He had already a disturbed stateof mind and this state of affairs augmented his mental worries. He seriously reflected that this wasnot the way of seeking the Guru. He made a strong determination that he must not roam about, muststick firmly to one solitary place and must perform there Tapas with constant prayers to God. Heselected a place and performed Tapas with all sincerity. This purified him and made him fit forhigher steps. After a period of two years, a Guru appeared before him, initiated him into deepmysteries of Yoga. Present-day aspirants also are running like this from place to place in search of aGuru. It is of no use. They should purify themselves for a Yogic life. By chance, even if they comein contact with an Avatara, they will not be benefited much if they have not a strong foundation for aYogic life.14. OTHER YOGINSThe yogi by means of various practices establishes a conscious control over the organs andfunctions of the body. He moulds his body like steel. One Swami in London had a demonstration ofstopping his heart before the King. Many able physicians were present on the occasion andexamined him. Desabandhu in 1926 stopped the radial and temporal pulses on both sides at will andstopped the beatings of the heart also for a short time. He showed a demonstration in the BombayMedical Union. In Maharajah Ranjit Singh’s Court in Lahore, Hatha Yogi Hari Das who buriedhimself underneath the ground for forty days after tightly closing his nose, mouth, ears and eyeswith wax came back alive. The Mohammedan Yogi, Gunangudi Mastan, was buried in Madras.Some Yogins fly in the air. This is due to Khechari Mudra.Yogi Pratap was in the posture of doing Viparitakarani Mudra. He asked the onlookers tocover his head with clay on all sides. He remained in that position for full 2 hours. Paul Deussen, theGerman traveller, personally witnessed this in Varanasi. Sri Swami Vishuddhananda of Varanasionce gave life to a dead sparrow. Nothing is impossible for a real Yogi.MYSTIC EXPERIENCE—VISIONS OF LIGHTSVarious kinds of lights manifest during meditation owing to deep concentration. In thebeginning a bright, white light, the size of a pin’s point will appear in the forehead at the spacebetween the two eyebrows which corresponds tentatively to the Ajna Chakra. You will notice,when the eyes are closed, different coloured lights, white, yellow, red, smoky, blue, green, mixedlights, flashes like lightning, fire, moon, sun, stars and sparks. These are Tanmatric lights. EachTanmatra has its own specific colour. Yellow and white lights are very commonly seen. In thebeginning small balls of white or red light float about before the mind’s eye. When you first observethis be assured that the mind is becoming more steady and that you are progressing in concentration.After some months, the size of the light will increase and you will see a full blaze of white light,bigger than the sun. In the beginning these lights are not steady. They come and disappearimmediately. When you have steady and systematic practice of meditation for 2 or 3 hours, theselights appear more frequently and remain steady for a long time. The vision of lights is a greatencouragement in Sadhana. It impels you to stick to Sadhana steadily. It gives you strong faith insuperphysical matter. The appearance of the lights denotes that you are transcending the physical88KUNDALINI YOGA"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"consciousness. You are in a semiconscious state when the light appears. You are between the twoplaces. You must not shake the body when these lights manifest. You must be perfectly steady inyour Asana and breathe slowly.At times you will see some lustrous forms of Devatas or some other physical forms. Youwill see your Ishta Devata or your Guru. Siddhas, Rishis and others give their Darshan to encourageyou. You can see beautiful gardens, palatial buildings, rivers, mountains, golden temples, sceneriesso lovely and picturesque as cannot be adequately described.During intense concentration, many are able to feel certain peculiar sensation as if someelectric current passes from the Muladhara-Chakra. They immediately disturb their body and comedown to the physical consciousness out of fear. They need have no fear at all. They should keepsteady and wait for further experiences.The experiences vary in different individuals. The experience of one man may not be thesame as that of another man. Many erroneously believe that they have realised the Self when theyget these experiences, stop their Sadhana and try to move with the public to preach and to doLoka-Sangraha. This is a serious blunder. This is not realisation at all. These are all simpleencouragements from your Ishta Devata to convince you of a higher spiritual life and push you inyour systematic and incessant practice with zeal and enthusiasm. You will have to ignore thesethings and drive them away just as you did with worldly objects. You must not care a bit when youget these visions. You must have your Lakshya on the goal. The visions may appear in somepersons within a few days, while in others within six or nine months. It depends upon the state of themind and degree of concentration. Some persons may not have such experiences, but they will beprogressing in the spiritual path.Sometimes you will get very powerful, dazzling lights, bigger than the sun. They are white.In the beginning, they come and disappear quickly. Later on they become steady even for 10 or 15minutes according to the degree of concentration. Lights will appear before the eyes or at any one ofthe Chakras. The light is so powerful and dazzling sometimes that you have to withdraw yourselffrom looking and break your meditation. Some people are afraid and they do not know what to doand how to proceed further. By constant practice, the mind engaged in concentration will vanish.The beings and objects with whom you are in touch during the early period of Sadhana belong to theastral world. The lustrous forms are higher Devatas of mental and higher planes, who come down togive Darshan and to encourage the Sadhakas. Various Shaktis manifest in lustrous forms. Adorethem. Do mental Puja as soon as they appear before you.Do not waste your time in looking at these visions. This is only a curiosity. These are allencouragements to convince you of the existence of superphysical, metaphysical realities. Visionsare either subjective or objective, your own mental creations or of realities on finer planes of matter.Universe consists of planes of matter of various degrees of density. Rhythmical vibrations ofTanmatras in various degrees give rise to the formation of various planes. Visions may be of thesethings or beings. Or in many cases they may be purely imaginary. They may be the crystallisation ofyour own intense thinking. You must discriminate well.89YOGA ADDENDA"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"ELEMENTALSSometimes these elementals appear during meditation. They are strange figures, some withlong teeth, big faces, some with three heads, some with faces on the belly, some without flesh andskin, etc. They are inhabitants of Bhuvar Loka. They are Bhutas. They are supposed to be theattendants of Lord Siva. They have terrifying forms. They do not cause any harm at all. They simplyappear on the stage. They come to test your strength and courage. They can do nothing. They cannotstand before a pure, ethical aspirant. Repetition of Om or your Guru Mantra will throw them at adistance. Whenever young people look at a dead body or when they see a body hanging or whenthey see a cruel murder, they always brood over this instance. Even during meditation, the samethought will come and take peculiar form. Again and again they will see the same form before theireyes. They should not fear at all. It is only their mental creation. A coward is absolutely unfit for thespiritual line. Destroy fear. Develop courage. Be bold.LIFE IN THE ASTRAL PLANEDuring the course of practice, one day you will feel that you have separated yourself fromthe body. You will have immense joy mixed with fear; joy in the possession of a new light, astralbody; and fear owing to the entry in a foreign, unknown plane. At the very outset, the newconsciousness is very rudimentary in the new plane. You will only feel that you have a light, airybody and will perceive a rotating, vibrating, limited astral atmosphere with illumination of goldenlights, objects and beings. You may feel that you are floating in the air.You will never fall; but the new experience of subtlety generates novel feelings andsensations in the beginning. How you leave the body and remain, is unknown. You are unaware ofhow you have completely separated yourself from the body. The new joy is inexpressible. Your willhave to actually feel and experience it yourself. When you come back to body-consciousness, thereis an intense craving to regain the new consciousness and to remain in that state always. By chance,by repeated attempts, you are able to go beyond the body-consciousness once in a month or so in thecourse of Sadhana. If you plod on with patience, through Yogic practices, you will be able to leavethe body at will and stay for a long time.You can by mere willing travel in any place you like with the astral body and therematerialise by drawing the necessary materials either from Ahamkara or the universal storehouse.The process is very simple to occultists and Yogis who know the rationale, the detailed technique ofthe various operations. Thought-reading, thought-transference, psychic healing, distant healing,etc., can be very easily performed by those who can function with the astral body. Concentratedmental rays can penetrate opaque walls and travel miles and miles.HINTS ON YOGABrahmacharya is very very essential Even in dreams you must be free from lustful thoughts.It requires long practice and careful watch over the mind and Indriyas. Foolish people hastily jumpup to the higher courses in Yoga in vain without having this important item which is very useful forspiritual Sadhana.90KUNDALINI YOGA"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Wet dreams generally occur in the last quarter of the night. Those who are in the habit ofgetting up from bed between 3 and 4 a.m. (Brahmamuhurta) and doing Japa, Pranayama andDhyana, can never fall a victim to nocturnal pollutions.That man in whom the sex-idea is deep-rooted can never dream of understanding Yoga andVedanta even in one hundred births.Keep the mind fully occupied. This is the best panacea or sovereign remedy for keeping upBrahmacharya. Do Japa, meditation, reading of religious books, walking, Kirtan, prayer, Satsanga,service, religious discourse, writing, etc.Always wear a Kaupeen or Langotee. This is scientific and spiritual too. If you are a marriedman, sleep in a separate room from your wife. Change your habit immediately.Be careful in the selection of your companions. Give up drama, talkies, reading novels andother love-stories. Do not use soaps and flowers. Observe Mowna. Do not mix with anyone. Readgood inspiring religious books. When desires arise in the mind do not fulfil them. Crush themimmediately. Avoid the company of women. No joking and laughing. These are all outwardmanifestations of lust only. When you walk in the street do not look hither and thither like amonkey. Do not look at a woman—even the photo or picture of a lady. Do not talk about women.When you advance in the spiritual practice it will be very difficult for you to do bothmeditation and daily office and household work at the same time, because the mind will undergo adouble strain. It finds it very difficult to adjust to different uncongenial activities. Therefore, theadvanced Grihastha-students will have to stop all worldly activities. When they advance inmeditation, if they desire to advance further, they should take to seclusion and must disconnectthemselves from the worldly activities entirely. Work is a hindrance in meditation for advancedYogic students.Live alone. Observe Mowna and record in your diary the benefits you derive. Do not makegestures and signshu, hu, hu. Thishu, hu, huis tantamount to talking. There is more wastage ofenergy in thishu, hu, hubusiness. Utilise this conserved energy in Japa and meditation.Sadhakas who take up to Nivritti Marga generally become lazy after some time, as they donot know how to utilise the mental energy, as they do not keep up any daily routine and as they donot follow the instructions of their Guru. They get Vairagya of course, but they have no experiencein the spiritual line. They do not make any spiritual progress in the end.Those who want to take up to seclusion and Nivritti Marga, should observe Mowna anddiscipline the Indriyas, mind and body while living in the world. They should train themselves tohard, laborious life, coarse food, walking without shoes and umbrella. Then only they can bear therigorous life of an ascetic.

This is an important factor in spiritual progress.Mixing with householders is highly dangerous. Solitude for Sadhana is a great desideratum. Allenergies must be carefully preserved. After a short stay in solitude, aspirants should not enter theworld. What they have gained in five years in seclusion through hard Tapas, will be irrecoverablylost in a month by mixing with worldly people. Several persons have complained to me that theyhave lost the power of concentration.After attaining perfection in Yoga, one can enter world if he is not affected even a bit byunfavourable, hostile currents of the world. There is no harm if you mix with congenial companywhich is also devoted to Yoga Abhyasa. You can discuss various philosophical points. You can bein the company of higher spiritual personages who enter into Samadhi. Many persons enter theworld before perfection in Yoga to demonstrate their minor powers in the name of Loka Sangrahaand for fame. They have been reduced to a level worse than a worldly man.Everything must be done gradually. It is very difficult for a man who was in the world to bein entire seclusion. It will be very painful and troublesome for a beginner. He should slowly trainhimself by observing Mowna often.The place wherein you can get concentration of mind is suitable for your Yogic practices.This is a general rule. There will be no use if you run from place to place.When you do Karma Yoga you must be free from egoism. You must not expect any rewardor appreciation for the work that you do (Nishkama). You must have a balanced mind in success andfailure.The moment the Chitta-Shuddhi is attained, you must stop doing Nishkama Karma and taketo pure meditation in seclusion.Most of the difficulties arise in your daily life if you do not have a proper control over yourmind. For instance, if a man does evil to you, instantly you want to revenge, to extract tooth fortooth, tit for tat policy, to return anger for anger. Every reaction of evil shows that the mind is notunder control. By anger one loses his energy. Balanced state of mind is not possible. From anger allother impurities emanate. Anger controlled properly, becomes transmuted into an energy sopowerful as to move the whole world.A slight overloading in the stomach will upset meditation. The mind has direct connectionwith gastric nerves of the stomach. You will get drowsiness also. You must train yourself to‘Mitahara’.When you have diet restriction, in the beginning you will imagine that you are getting leanerand weaker.

Out of compulsion you can leave the badhabit.If you want to stop taking mutton, fish etc., just see with your own eyes the pitiable,struggling condition at the time of killing the sheep or fish. Now mercy and sympathy will arise inyour heart. Then you will determine to give up flesh-eating so that the poor innocent lives may bespared. If you fail in this attempt, just change your environments and live in a Brahmin hotel whereyou cannot get mutton and fish and move with that society where there is only vegetable diet.Always think of the evils of flesh-eating and the benefits of vegetable diet. If this also cannot giveyou sufficient strength to stop this habit, go to the slaughter house and butcher’s shop andpersonally see the disgusting rotten muscles, kidneys and other nasty parts of the animal and the badsmell. This will induce Vairagya in you and a strong disgust and hatred for mutton-eating.A Mantra is a mass of Tejas or radiant energy. It transforms the mental substance byproducing a particular thought movement. The rhythmical vibrations produced by Mantra regulatethe unsteady vibrations of the five sheaths. It checks the natural tendency of objective thoughts ofthe mind. It helps the Sadhana Shakti and reinforces it. Sadhana Shakti is strengthened byMantra-Shakti. Mantra awakens superhuman powers.“Only the knowledge imparted by a Guru through his lips is powerful and useful; otherwiseit becomes fruitless, weak and very painful.”“Siddhau visvasah prathamalakshanam”—For success, firm belief is the first condition.Develop the power of endurance (Titiksha), learn to bear happiness and misery evenly andto pass through all phases of life, all experiences.The endurance of all pain and torture with patience and contentment means the exercise of adistinct force which spiritualises the whole nature. The greater this force, the speedier the spiritualgrowth. Patience and faith should continue undiminished all through the Sadhana period.Chitta-Shuddhi is purification of mind.

They should utilise their energy in attaining the Highest.Those who can do telepathy, psychic healing, etc., use only the Prana in a different way. Forproducing different results, the same Prana must be utilised in a different method. You should knowthe technique to use this from a Guru. By long practice you also can do everything successfully.A Yogi on the appearance of certain Siddhis thinks that he has achieved the highest goal. Hemay give up his further Sadhana through false contentment. The Yogi who is bent upon getting thehighest Samadhi, must reject Siddhis whenever they come. Siddhis are invitations from Devatas.Only by rejecting these Siddhis, one can attain success in Yoga. He who craves for Siddhis is aworldly-minded man. He is a very big householder. Those who crave for Siddhis will never getthem. If a Yogic student is tempted to attain Siddhis, his further progress is seriously retarded. Hehas lost the way.Do not stop Sadhana when you get a few glimpses and experiences. Continue the practicetill you attain perfection. Do not stop the practice and move about in the world. Examples are notlacking. Numerous persons have been ruined. A glimpse cannot give you safety.You can do nothing by a happy-go-lucky life. Stick to one place for three years. Draw aprogramme of daily routine. Then follow to the very letter at any cost. Then you are sure to succeed.There is no use of dilly-dallying hither and thither in search of a Guru. If you search for him,you will never get him. If you make yourself deserving by the practice of all preliminaryqualifications, he will doubtless come to you. It is within the power of everybody to attain successin Yoga. What is wanted is sincere devotion, constant and steady Abhyasa.Never allow sentiment to overcome you one way or other. Wisely utilise every condition forthe uplift of the soul and Chitta Suddhi.96KUNDALINI YOGA"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Unless you are prepared to give up all you have for the service of the Lord and mankind, youare quite unfit for the spiritual path.You first separate yourself from the body; then you identify yourself with the mind and thenyou function on the mental plane.

All possible care should be takento keep the body in a healthy condition. A Sadhaka should take more care than a worldly manbecause it is with this instrument that he has to reach the Goal. At the same time he must be quiteunattached to the body and be prepared to give it up at any moment. That is the proper ideal.As to the qualification for renunciation, a man should have attained perfect purity of mind,stability of intellect, discrimination, disgust towards sensual pleasures and a keen desire forfreedom. Unless a man has attained these qualifications, renunciation of active duties of life doesnot produce the desired effect.If you want Samadhi, you must know well the process of Dhyana.

By furtherYogic practices, you will have to take it from Chakra to Chakra, one by one.Even after Kundalini has reached the Sahasrara it can drop to Muladhara Chakra. The Yogican also stop it at a particular Chakra. When the Yogi is established in Samadhi, when he hasattained Kaivalya, Kundalini will not come back to Muladhara.The body will exist even after Kundalini has reached Sahasrara Chakra, but the Yogi willhave no body-consciousness. It is only when Kaivalya is attained that the body becomes lifeless.The Sadhakas should have a pure heart and should be free from Doshas. The Mantra shouldhave been obtained from a great man. The Sadhaka should have faith in the Mantra.

Many have not the power of discrimination. Thereforeyoung age is not suitable for advanced courses in Yoga.Many other important doubts of the aspirants have been cleared in the text.SOME PRACTICAL HINTSThe actual method of awakening the Kundalini Shakti and uniting Her with the Lord in theSahasrara can only be learnt from a Guru. I give here a general outline of the Yogic practice that willenable the Sadhaka to realise the Chit.The Jivatma in the subtle body, the receptacle of the five vital airs (Pancha Pranas), mind inits three aspects of Manas, Buddhi and Ahankara; the five organs of action (Karmendriyas); and thefive organs of perception (Jnanendriyas), are united with the Kula-Kundalini. The Kandarpa orKama Vayu in the Muladhara—a form of the Apana Vayu—is given a leftward revolution and thefire which is around Kundalini is kindled. By the Bija “Hung”, and the heat of the fire thus kindled,the coiled and sleeping Kundalini is awakened. She who lay asleep around Svayambhu-linga, withher coils three circles and a half, dosing the entrance of the Brahmadvara, will on being roused,enter that door and move upwards, united with the Jivatma.On this upward movement, Brahma, Savitri, Dakini-Shakti, the Devas, Bija and Vritti, aredissolved in the body of Kundalini. The Maheemandala or Prithvi is converted into the Bija “Lang,”and is also merged in Her body. When Kundalini leaves the Muladhara, the lotus which, on theawakening of Kundalini, had opened and turned its flower upwards, again closes and hangsdownwards. As Kundalini reaches the Svadhishthana-Chakra, that lotus opens out, and lifts itsflower upwards. Upon the entrance of Kundalini, Mahavishnu, Mahalakshmi, Sarasvati, RakiniShakti, Deva Matrikas and Vritti, Vaikunthadhama, Goloka, and the Deva and Devi residingtherein are dissolved in the body of Kundalini. The Prithvi or earth Bija “Lang” is dissolved inApah, and Apah converted into the Bija “Vang,” remains in the body of Kundalini. When the Devireaches the Manipura Chakra all that is in the Chakra merges in Her body. The Varuna Bija “Vang”is dissolved in fire, which remains in the body of the Devi as the Bija “Rang”. This Chakra is calledthe Brahmagranthi (or knot of Brahma). The piercing of this Chakra may involve considerable pain,physical disorder, and even disease. On this account, the directions of an experienced Guru arenecessary, and therefore also other modes of Yoga have been recommended for those to whom theyare applicable; for in such modes activity is provoked directly in the higher centre and it is notnecessary that the lower Chakras should be pierced. Kundalini next reaches the Anahata Chakrawhere all which is therein is merged in Her. The Bija of Tejas, “Rang” disappears in Vayu and Vayuconverted into its Bija “Yang”, merges into the body of Kundalini. This Chakra is known asVishnugranthi (knot of Vishnu). Kundalini then ascends to the abode of Bharati (or Sarasvati) or theVishuddha Chakra. Upon Her entrance, Ardha-Narisvara Siva, Sakini, the sixteen vowels, Mantra,etc., are dissolved in the body of Kundalini. The Bija of Vayu, “Yang” is dissolved in Akasa, whichitself being transformed into the Bija “Hang” is merged in the body of Kundalini. Piercing theLalana Chakra, the Devi reaches the Ajna Chakra, where Parama Shiva, Siddha Kali, theDeva-Gana and all else therein are absorbed into Her body. The Bija of Akasa, “Hang” is merged inthe Manas-Chakra and mind itself in the body of Kundalini. The Ajna Chakra is known asRudra-granthi (or the knot of Rudra or Shiva). After this Chakra has been pierced, Kundalini, of Her99YOGA ADDENDA"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"own motion, unites with Paramasiva. As She proceeds upwards from the two-petalled lotus, theNiralamba Puri, Pranava Nada etc., are merged in Her.The Kundalini then in her progress upwards, absorbs herself the twenty-four Tattvascommencing with the gross elements, and then unites Herself and becomes one with Paramasiva.The nectar which flows from such union floods the Kshudrabrahmanda or human body. It is thenthat the Sadhaka forgetful of all in this world is immersed in ineffable bliss.Thereafter the Sadhaka, thinking of the Vayu Bija “Yang” as being in the left nostril, inhalesthrough Ida, making Japa of the Bija sixteen times. Then closing both nostrils, he makes Japa of theBija sixty-four times. He then thinks that the black “man of sin” (Papapurusha) in the left cavity ofthe abdomen is being dried up, and so thinking, he exhales through the right nostril Pingala, makingJapa of the Bija thirty-two times. The Papapurusha should be thought of as an angry black man inthe left side of the cavity of the abdomen, of the size of the thumb, with red beard and eyes, holdinga sword and shield, with his head ever held low, the very image of all sins. The Sadhaka thenmeditating upon the red-coloured Bija “Rang” in the Manipura, inhales, making sixteen Japas ofthe Bija, and then closes the nostrils, making sixty-four Japas. While making the Japa he thinks thatthe body of the man of sin is being burnt and reduced to ashes. He then exhales through the rightnostril with thirty-two Japas. He then meditates upon the white Chandra Bija “Thang”. He nextinhales through Ida, making Japa of the Bija sixteen times, closes both nostrils with Japa donesixty-four times, and exhales through Pingala with thirty-two Japas. During inhalation, holding ofbreath and exhalation, he should consider that a new celestial body is being formed by the nectar(composed of all the letters of the alphabet, Matrika-varna) dropping from the moon. In a similarway with the Bija “Vang”, the formation of the body is continued, and with the Bija “Lang” it iscompleted and strengthened. Lastly, with the Mantra “Soham”, the Sadhaka leads the Jivatma intothe heart. Thus Kundalini who has enjoyed Her union with Paramashiva, sets out on her returnjourney the way she came. As she passes through each of the Chakras all that she has absorbedtherefrom come out from herself and take their several places in the Chakra.In this manner she again reaches the Muladhara, when all that is described to be in theChakras are in the positions which they occupied before her awakening.100KUNDALINI YOGA"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"SPIRITUAL DIARYQuestionsDate1.

It forms partof the Krishna Yajurveda. It deals with an exposition of Hatha and Lambika Yogas. It concludeswith an account of the non-qualified Brahman. The Non-dual Brahman is the quest of all seekers.Though grouped among the minor Upanishads, the Yoga-Kundalini Upanishad is a veryimportant work on Kundalini Yoga. It begins with an analysis of the nature of Chitta. It maintainsthat Samskaras and Vasanas on the one hand, and Prana, on the other, constitute the causes for theexistence of Chitta. If Vasanas are controlled, Prana is automatically controlled. If Prana iscontrolled, the Vasanas are automatically controlled.The Yoga-Kundalini Upanishad presents methods for the control of Prana. The Yogicstudent does not deal with Vasanas. He concerns himself with the techniques of controlling thePrana.The three methods given in the Yoga-Kundalini Upanishad for the control of Prana are:Mitahara, Asana and Shakti-Chalana. These three methods are fully explained in the first chapter.Light, sweet and nutritious food forms the discipline of Mitahara. The Padmasana and theVajrasana are two important Asanas used by the Yogic student. Shakti-Chalana is arousing theKundalini and sending it to the crown of the head.Kundalini can be aroused by a twofold practice. Saraswati Chalana and the restraint ofPrana are the two practices. The rousing of the Saraswati Nadi is Saraswati Chalana.The process, as described in the Yoga-Kundalini Upanishad, for arousing Kundalini issimple. When a person exhales, the Prana goes out 16 digits. In inhalation it goes in only 12 digits,thus losing 4. The Kundalini is aroused if one can inhale Prana for 16 digits. This is done by sittingin Padmasana and when the Prana is flowing through the left nostril, and lengthening inwards 4digits more.By means of this lengthened breath the Yogic student should manipulate the Saraswati Nadiand stir up the Kundalini Shakti with all his strength, from right to left, repeatedly. This processmay extend to three quarters of an hour. All this has been briefly and yet comprehensively describedin the Yoga-Kundalini Upanishad.The most important result of shaking the Saraswati Nadi is that it cures the several diseasesarising within the belly, and cleanses and purifies the system. After the practice of the SahitaKumbhaka the Yogic student is initiated into the Kevala Kumbhaka. These two types of Kumbhakabring about the complete restraint of the Prana.Suryabheda Kumbhaka, Ujjayi Kumbhaka, Sitali and Bhastrika are the four divisions of theSahita Kumbhaka. Suryabheda Kumbhaka destroys the intestinal worms and the four kinds of evilscaused by Vayu. Ujjayi purifies the body, removes diseases and increases the gastric fire. It also103YOGA-KUNDALINI UPANISHAD"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"removes the heat caused in the head and the phlegm in the throat. Sitali cools the body. It destroysgulma, dyspepsia, pliha, consumption, bile, fever, thirst and poison. These forms of SahitaKumbhaka purify and prepare the entire physiological organism for the arousal of the KundaliniSakti and for the experience of the non-dual Brahman.Apart from bringing a number of wholesome physiological changes, Bhastrika Kumbhakapierces the three knots or the Granthis. The Yoga-Kundalini Upanishad then proceeds to prescribethe practice of the three Bandhas, for the Yogic student. The process by which the downwardtendency of the Apana (breath) is forced up by the spincter muscles of the anus, is called theMulabandha. By this Bandha the Apana is raised up. It reaches the sphere of Agni or fire. Then theflame of the Agni grows long, being blown about by Vayu. In a heated state, Agni and Apanacommingle with the Prana. This Agni is very fierce.Through this fiery Agni, there arises in the body the fire that awakens and arouses theKundalini, through its radiant heat. The aroused Kundalini makes a hissing noise, becomes erectand enters the hole of Brahmanadi. The Yogins practise this Mulabandha daily.In this aim of arousing the Sarasvati Nadi and the Kundalini Shakti, the other two Bandhas,viz., Uddiyana Bandha and the Jalandhara Bandha, also play the most significant part.After giving detailed knowledge of the techniques of the Bandhas, the Yoga-KundaliniUpanishad explains the number of obstacles the Yogic students encounter. It also gives the methodsof overcoming these obstacles.The causes of the diseases in the body are seven. 1. Sleeping during the daytime. 2. Latevigils overnight. 3. Excess of sexual intercourse. 4. Moving amidst crowds. 5. The effect ofunwholesome food. 6. Checking of the discharge of urine and faeces. 7. Laborious mentaloperations with the Prana.The mistake that the Yogic student commits is that when diseases attack him, heerroneously attributes the diseases to his practice of Yoga. This is the first obstacle in Yoga.The Yogic student begins to doubt as to the efficacy of the Yoga Sadhana. This is the secondobstacle. Carelessness or a state of confusion is the third obstacle. Indifference or laziness is thefourth obstacle. Sleep is the fifth obstacle and the sixth is the attachment to sense-objects. Theseventh obstacle is erroneous perception or delusion. The eighth is concern with worldly affairs.The ninth is want of faith. The tenth obstacle to Yoga practice is want of the necessary aptitude forgrasping the Yoga truths.Earnest spiritual aspirants should avoid all these obstacles by means of a close investigationand great deliberation. Further on, the Upanishads describe the process and the manner by whichthe Kundalini is roused and taken to the Sahasrara by piercing through the Granthis.When the awakened Kundalini moves upwards, the shower of nectar flows copiously. TheYogi enjoys this which keeps him away from all sensual pleasures. The Yogi takes his stand upon104KUNDALINI YOGA"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"the Inner Reality, the Atman. He enjoys the highest state of spiritual experience. He attains peaceand is devoted only to the Atman.By the whole process of the Kundalini Yoga Sadhana, the body of the Yogi attains verysubtle state of the spiritual Consciousness. The Yogi who has attained to Samadhi experienceseverything as Consciousness. The Yogi realises the oneness of the macrocosm and the microcosm.Because, the Kundalini Shakti has reached the Sahasrara Kamala or the thousand-petalled lotus andhas become united with Siva, the Yogi enjoys the highest Avastha. This is the final beatitude.The Chakras are centres of Shakti as vital force. These are the centres of Prana Shaktimanifested by Pranavayu in the living body.Those aspirants who aspire to arouse the Kundalini Shakti to enjoy the Bliss of Union ofSiva and Shakti, through awakened Kundalini, and to gain the accompanying Powers or Siddhis,should practise Kundalini Yoga. To them, this Yoga-Kundalini Upanishad is of great importance. Itequips them with a comprehensive knowledge of the methods and processes of the Kundalini Yogain which the Khechari Mudra stands prominent.The Kundalini Yogi seeks to obtain both Bhukti and Mukti. He attains liberation in andthrough the world. Jnana Yoga is the path of asceticism and liberation. Kundalini Yoga is the pathof enjoyment and liberation.The Hatha Yogi seeks a body which shall be as strong as steel, healthy, free from sufferingand therefore, long-lived. Master of the body, the Yogi is the Master of life and death. His shiningform enjoys the vitality of youth. He lives as long as he has the will to live and enjoys in the world offorms. His death is the death at will (Ichha-Mrityu). The Yogi should seek the guidance of an expertand skilled Guru.The Serpent Power is the power which is the static support or Adhara of the whole body andall its moving Pranic forces. The polarity as it exists in, and as, the body is destroyed by Yoga whichdisturbs the equilibrium of bodily consciousness, which consciousness is the result of themaintenance of these two poles.In the human body the potential pole of Energy which is the Supreme Power is stirred toaction. The Shakti is moved upward to unite with the Siva, the quiescent Consciousness in theSahasrara.By Pranayama and other Yogic processes the static Shakti is affected and becomesdynamic. When completely dynamic, when Kundalini unites with Siva in the Sahasrara, thepolarisation of the body gives way. The two poles are united in one and there is the state ofconsciousness called Samadhi. The polarisation takes place in the Consciousness. The bodyactually continues to exist as an object of observation to others.When the Kundalini ascends, the body of the Yogi is maintained by the nectar which flow,from the union of Siva and Shakti in Sahasrara. Glory to Mother Kundalini who, through HerInfinite Grace and Power, kindly leads the Sadhaka from Chakra to Chakra and illumines him and105YOGA-KUNDALINI UPANISHAD"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"makes him realise his identity with the Supreme Brahman! The Yoga-Kundalini Upanishadattaches great importance to the search for and finding of right Guru. It insists upon revering theillumined Guru, as God. Guru is one who has full Self-illumination. He removes the veil ofignorance in the deluded individuals.The number of realised Gurus may be less in this Kali Yuga when compared with the SatyaYuga, but they are always present to help the aspirants. They are always searching for the properAdhikarins.The Yoga-Kundalini Upanishad gives a list of the obstacles to Yoga practice. Some take tothe practice of Yoga, and later on, when they come across some obstacles in the way, they do notknow how to proceed further. They do not know how to obviate them. Many are the obstacles,dangers, snares and pitfalls on the spiritual path. Sadhakas may commit many mistakes on the path.A Guru who has already trodden the path and reached the goal, is very necessary to guide them.One more important thing which you would find in many places in the Yoga-KundaliniUpanishad is the Sushumna Nadi. You must have a complete knowledge of this Nadi.Now, a word on Kundalini, the arousal of which is the immediate aim of the KundaliniYoga. Kundalini, the serpent-power or mystic fire is the primordial energy or Shakti that liesdormant or sleeping in the Muladhara Chakra, the centre of the body. It is called the serpentine orannular power on account of serpentine form. It is an electric fiery occult power, the great pristineforce which underlies all organic and inorganic matter.CHITTA AND THE CONTROL OF PRANA1. Chitta is the Subconscious mind. It is the mind-stuff. It is the store-house of memory.Samskaras or impressions of actions are imbedded here. It is one of the four parts of Antahkarana orinner instruments, viz., mind, intellect, Chitta and Ahankara or ego.2. Mind is formed out of wind. So, it is fleeting like the wind. Intellect is formed out of fire.Chitta is formed out of water. Ego is formed out of earth.3. Chitta has two causes for its existence, viz., Vasanas or subtle desires and the vibration ofPrana.4. If one of them is controlled, the result is, both of them are controlled.MITAHARA, ASANA AND SHAKTI-CHALANA5. Of these two, viz., Prana and Vasanas, the student of Yoga should control Prana bymoderate food (Mitahara), by Asanas or Yogic postures and thirdly by Shakti-Chalana.6. O Gautama! I shall explain the nature of these three disciplines. Listen with rapt attention.106KUNDALINI YOGA"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"7. The Yogi should take sweet and nutritious food. He should fill half the stomach withfood. He should drink water, one quarter of the stomach. He should leave the fourth quarter of thestomach unfilled in order to propitiate Lord Siva, the patron of the Yogins. This is moderation indiet.THE PADMA AND VAJRA ASANAS8. Placing of the right foot on the left thigh and the left foot on the right thigh, is Padmasana.This posture is the destroyer of all sins.9. Placing one heel below the Muladhara and the other over it and sitting with the trunk,neck and head in one straight line is the adamantine posture or the Vajrasana. Mulakanda is the rootof the Kanda, the genital organ.THE ROUSING OF THE KUNDALINI10. A wise Yogi should take the Kundalini from the Muladhara to the Sahasrara or thethousand-petalled Lotus in the crown of the head. This process is called Shakti-Chalana.11. The Kundalini should pass through the Svadhishthana Chakra, the Manipura Chakra inthe navel, the Anahata Chakra in the heart, the Vishuddha Chakra in the throat, and the Ajna Chakrabetween the eyebrows or the Trikuti.12. Two things are necessary for the practice of Shakti-Chalana. One is the SarasvatiChalana and the other is the restraint of Prana or the breath.THE SARASVATI CHALANA13. Sarasvati Chalana is the rousing of the Sarasvati Nadi. Sarasvati Nadi is situated on thewest of the navel among the fourteen Nadis. Sarasvati is called Arundhati. Literally, it means thatwhich helps the performance of good actions.14. Through this practice of Sarasvati Chalana and the restraint of the Prana, the Kundaliniwhich is spiral becomes straightened.15. The Kundalini is roused only by rousing the Sarasvati.16. When Prana or the breath is passing through one’s Ida or the left nostril, one should sitfirmly in Padmasana and lengthen inwards 4 digits the Akasa of 12 digits. In exhalation Prana goesout 16 digits and in inhalation it goes in only 12 digits, thus losing 4. But if inhaled for 16 digits thenthe Kundalini is aroused.17. The wise Yogi should bring Sarasvati Nadi by means of this lengthened breath andholding firmly together both the ribs near the navel by means of the forefinger and thumbs of bothhands one hand on each side, should stir up Kundalini with all his strength, from right to left, againand again. This stirring may extend over a period of 48 minutes.107YOGA-KUNDALINI UPANISHAD"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"18. Then he should draw up a little when Kundalini finds its entry into Sushumna. This is themeans by which the Kundalini enters the mouth of Sushumna.19. Along with the Kundalini, Prana also enters of itself the Sushumna.20. The Yogic student should also expand navel by compressing the neck. After this, byshaking Sarasvati, the Prana is sent above to the chest. By the contraction of the neck, Prana goesabove from the chest.21. Sarasvati has sound in her womb. She should be thrown into vibration or shaken daily.22. Merely by shaking Sarasvati one is cured of dropsy or Jalodara, Gulma (a disease of thestomach), Pliha (a disease of the spleen) and all other diseases rising within the belly.VARIETIES OF PRANAYAMA23. Briefly, I will now describe to you Pranayama. Prana is the Vayu that moves in the body.The restraint of Prana within is known as Kumbhaka.24. Kumbhaka is of two kinds, namely, Sahita and Kevala.25. Till he gets Kevala, the Yogic student should practise Sahita.26. There are four divisions or Bhedas. These divisions are: Surya, Ujjayi, Sitali andBhastrika. Sahita Kumbhaka is the Kumbhaka associated with these four.SURYABHEDA KUMBHAKA27. Select a place which is pure, beautiful and free from pebbles, thorns, etc. It should be ofthe length of a bow free from cold, fire and water. To this place, take a pure and pleasant seat whichis neither too high nor too low. Upon it, sit in Padmasana. Now, shake or throw into vibrationSarasvati. Slowly inhale the breath from outside, through the right nostril, as long as this iscomfortable, and exhale it through the left nostril. Exhale after purifying the skull by forcing thebreath up. This destroys the four kinds of evils caused by Vayu. It destroys also the intestinalworms. This should be repeated often. It is called Suryabheda.UJJAYI KUMBHAKA28. Close the mouth. Draw up slowly the breath through both the nostrils. Retain it in thespace between the heart and the neck. Then exhale through the left nostril.29. This removes both the heat caused in the head and the phlegm in the throat. It removesall diseases. It purifies the body and increases the gastric fire. It removes all the evils arising in theNadis, Jalodara or dropsy, that is water in the belly, and Dhatus. The name for this Kumbhaka isUjjayi. It can be practised even when walking or standing.108KUNDALINI YOGA"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"SITALI KUMBHAKA30. Draw up the breath through the tongue with the hissing soundSa.Retain it as before.Then slowly exhale through both the nostrils. This is called Sitali Kumbhaka.31. Sitali Kumbhaka cools the body. It destroys gulma or the chronic dyspepsia, Pliha (adisease of the spleen), consumption, bile, fever, thirst and poison.32. Sit in Padmasana with belly and neck erect. Close the mouth and exhale through thenostrils. Then inhale a little up to the neck so that the breath will fill the space, with noise, betweenthe neck and skull. Then exhale in the same way and inhale often and often. Even as the bellows of asmith are moved stuffed within with air and then let out, so you should move the air within the body.When you get tired, inhale through the right nostril. If the belly is full of Vayu, press well thenostrils with all your fingers except the forefinger. Perform Kumbhaka and exhale through the leftnostril.33. This removes the inflammation of the throat. It increases the digestive gastric firewithin. It enables one to know the Kundalini. It produces purity, removes sins, gives pleasure andhappiness and destroys phlegm which is the bolt or obstacle to the door at the mouth of Brahmanadior the Sushumna.34. It pierces also the three Granthis or knots differentiated through the three modes ofNature or Gunas. The three Granthis or knots are Vishnu Granthi, Brahma Granthi and RudraGranthi. This Kumbhaka is called Bhastrika. This should be especially practised by the HathaYogic students.THE THREE BANDHAS35. The Yogic student should now practise the three Bandhas. The three Bandhas are: theMula Bandha, the Uddiyana Bandha and the Jalandhara Bandha.36.Mula Bandha: Apana (breath) which has a downward tendency is forced up by thesphincter muscles of the anus. Mula Bandha is the name of this process.37. When Apana is raised up and reaches the sphere of Agni (fire) then the flame of Agnigrows long, being blown about by Vayu.38. Then, in a heated state, Agni and Apana commingle with the Prana. This Agni is veryfiery. Through this there arises in the body the fire that rouses the sleeping Kundalini through itsheat.39. Then this Kundalini makes a hissing noise. It becomes erect like a serpent beaten with astick and enters the hole of Brahmanadi or the Sushumna. Therefore, the Yogins should practisedaily Mulabandha often.109YOGA-KUNDALINI UPANISHAD"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"40.The Uddiyana Bandha: At the end of the Kumbhaka and at the beginning of expiration,Uddiyana Bandha should be performed. BecausePrana Uddiyate, or thePranagoes up theSushumna in this Bandha, the Yogins call it Uddiyana.41. Sit in the Vajrasana. Hold firmly the two toes by the two hands. Then press at the Kandaand at the places near the two ankles. Then gradually upbear the Tana or the thread or the Nadiwhich is on the western side first to Udara or the upper part of the abdomen above the navel, then tothe heart and then to the neck. When the Prana reaches the Sandhi or the junction of the navel,slowly it removes the impurities and diseases in the navel. For this reason, this should be practisedfrequently.42.The Jalandhara Bandha: This should be practised at the end of Puraka (after inhalation).This is of the form of contraction of the neck and is an impediment to the passage of Vayu(upwards).43. The Prana goes through Brahmanadi on the western Tana in the middle, when the neckis contracted at once by bending downwards so that the chin may touch the breast. Assuming theposture as mentioned before, the Yogi should stir up Sarasvati and control Prana.HOW MANY TIMES KUMBHAKA SHOULD BE PRACTISED44. On the first day, Kumbhaka should be practised four times.45. It should be done ten times, on the second day, and then five times separately.46. On the third day, twenty times will be enough. Afterwards Kumbhaka should bepractised with the three Bandhas and with an increase of five times each day.THE OBSTACLES TO THE PRACTICE OF YOGA AND HOW TOOVERCOME THEM47. Seven are the causes of the diseases in the body. Sleeping during the daytime is the first,late vigils overnight is the second, excess of sexual intercourse the third, moving amidst crowds thefourth. The fifth cause is the effect of unwholesome food. The sixth is the checking of the dischargeof urine and faeces. The seventh is the laborious mental operation with Prana.48. When attacked by such diseases, the Yogi who is afraid of them says, “My diseases havearisen from my practices of Yoga.” Then he will discontinue this practice. This is the first obstacleto Yoga.49. The second obstacle to Yoga is the doubt as to the efficacy of Yoga practice.50. Third obstacle is carelessness or a state of confusion.51. The fourth is indifference or laziness.110KUNDALINI YOGA"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"52. Sleep constitutes the fifth obstacle to Yoga practice.53. The sixth is not leaving the objects of senses; the seventh is the erroneous perception ordelusion.54. The eighth is sensual objects or concern with worldly affairs. The ninth is want of faith.The tenth is non-aptitude for understanding of the truths of Yoga.THE ROUSING OF THE KUNDALINI55. The intelligent practitioner of Yoga should, by means of close investigation and greatdeliberation, avoid these ten obstacles.56. With the mind firmly fixed on the Truth, the practice of Pranayama should be performeddaily. Then the mind takes its repose in the Sushumna. The Prana therefore never moves.57. When the impurities of the mind are thus removed and Prana is absorbed in theSushumna, one becomes a true Yogin.58. When the accumulated impurity, clogging the Sushumna Nadi, is completely removedand the passage of vital air through the Sushumna is effected by performing Kevala Kumbhaka, theYogin forcibly causes the Apana with the downward course to rise upwards by the contraction ofthe anus (Mula Bandha).59. Thus raised up, the Apana mixes with Agni. Then they go up quickly to the seat of Prana.Then, Prana and Apana uniting with one another, go to Kundalini which is coiled up and asleep.60. Heated by Agni and stirred up by Vayu, Kundalini stretches its body in the interior of themouth of the Sushumna.THE KUNDALINI REACHES THE SAHASRARA BY PIERCINGTHROUGH THE THREE KNOTS61. The Kundalini pierces through the Brahmagranthi formed of Rajas. It flashes at oncelike lightning at the mouth of Sushumna.62. Then Kundalini goes up at once through Vishnugranthi to the heart. Then it goes upthrough the Rudragranthi and above it to the middle of the eyebrows.63. Having pierced this place, the Kundalini goes up to the Mandala (sphere) of the moon. Itdries up the moisture produced by the moon in the Anahata Chakra which has sixteen petals.64. Through the speed of Prana, when the blood is agitated, it becomes bile from its contactwith the sun. Then it goes to the sphere of the moon. Here it becomes of the nature of pure phlegm.65. When it flows there, how does the blood which is very cold become hot?111YOGA-KUNDALINI UPANISHAD"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"66. Since at the same time the intense white form of moon is rapidly heated. The agitatedKundalini moves upwards and the shower of nectar flows more copiously.67. As a result of swallowing this, the Chitta of the Yogin is kept away from all sensualpleasures. The Yogin is exclusively absorbed in the Atma partaking of the sacrificial offering callednectar. He takes his stand in his own Self.68. He enjoys this highest state. He becomes devoted to the Atman and attains peace.THE DISSOLUTION OF PRANA AND OTHERS69. The Kundalini then goes to the seat of the Sahasrara. It gives up the eight forms of thePrakriti: earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intellect and egoism.70. After clasping the eye, the mind, the Prana and the others in her embrace, the Kundalinigoes to Siva and clasping Siva as well, dissolves herself in the Sahasrara.71. Thus Rajas-Sukla or the seminal fluid which rises up, goes to Siva along with Marut orthe Vayu. Prana and Apana which are always produced become equal.72. Prana flows in all things, big and small, describable or indescribable, as fire in gold. Thebreath also dissolves itself.73. Born together of the same quality, the Prana and the Apana also dissolve themselves inthe presence of Siva in the Sahasrara. Having reached an equipoised condition, they no longer go upor down.74. Then the Yogi thrives with the Prana spread outward in the form of attenuated elementsor in the mere remembrance of it, the mind having been reduced to the form of faint impressions andthe speech having remained only in the form of recollection.75. All the vital airs then spread themselves outright in his body even as gold in a crucibleplaced on fire.EXPERIENCING EVERYTHING AS CONSCIOUSNESS DURINGSAMADHI76. The body of the Yogi attains very subtle state of the pure Brahman. By causing the bodymade of the elements to be absorbed in a subtle state in the form of the Paramatman or the supremeDeity, the body of the Yogi gives up its impure corporal state.77. That alone is the Truth underlying all things, which is released from the state ofnon-sentience and is devoid of impurities.112KUNDALINI YOGA"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"78. That alone which is of the nature of the Absolute Consciousness, which is of thecharacter of the attribute “I” of all beings, the Brahman, the subtlest form of That alone is the Truthunderlying all things.79. The release from the notion that the Brahman is qualified, the delusion about theexistence or non-existence of anything apart from the Brahman (which should be annihilated) andexperience such as these that remain, there the Yogi should know as the Brahman. Simultaneouslywith the drawing of such knowledge of the form of the Atman, the liberation is attained by him.80. When such is not the case, only all kinds of absurd and impossible notions arise. Therope-serpent and such other absurd notions, brought about by delusion take their rise. Absurdnotions like the notion which men and women have, of silver, in the shell of the pearl-oyster, arise.81. The Yogi should realise the oneness of the Visvatman and others up to the Turiya. Heshould realise the oneness of the microcosm with the Virat Atman and others, upto the Turiya, ofthe macrocosm, also of the Linga with the Sutratman, of the Self with the unmanifested state, of theAtman manifested in one’s Self with the Atman of Consciousness.THE SAMADHI YOGA82. The Kundalini Sakti is like a thread in the Lotus. It is resplendent. It is biting with itsmouth, the upper end of its body, at the root of the Lotus, the Mulakanda or the Muladhara.83. It is in contact with the hole of Brahmanadi of Sushumna, taking hold of its tail with itsmouth.84. Seated in Padmasana, if a person who has accustomed himself to the contraction of hisanus (Mula Bandha), makes the Vayu go upwards with the mind intent on Kumbhaka, the Agnicomes to the Svadhishthana flaming, owing to the blowing of Vayu.85. From the blowing of Vayu and Agni, Kundalini pierces open the Brahmagranthi. It thenpierces open the Vishnugranthi.86. Then the Kundalini pierces the Rudragranthi. After that, it pierces all the six lotuses orthe plexus. Then the Kundalini Sakti is happy with Siva in Sahasradala Kamala, thethousand-petalled lotus. This should be known as the highest Avastha or the state. This alone is thegiver of final beatitude. Thus ends the first chapter.THE KHECHARI VIDYA1. Now, then, a description of the science called Khechari.2. He who has duly mastered this science, is freed from old age and death, in this world.3. Knowing this science, O Sage, one who is subject to the pains of death, disease and oldage, should make his mind firm and practise Khechari.113YOGA-KUNDALINI UPANISHAD"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"4. He who has gained a knowledge of the Khechari from books, from the exposition of themeaning of the same, and who has by recourse to its practice, gained a mastery of this science,becomes the destroyer of old age, death and disease, in this world.5. Such a master, one should approach for shelter. From all points of view, one should lookupon him as his Guru.6. The science of Khechari is not easily accessible. Its practice is not easily attainable. Itspractice and Melana are not accomplished simultaneously. Literally, Melana is joining.7. The key to this science of Khechari is kept a profound secret. The secret is revealed byadepts only at initiation.8. They do not get Melana, who are bent only upon practice. O Brahman, only some get thepractice after several births. But, even after hundred births, Melana is not obtained.9. As a result of having undergone the practice for several births, some Yogis get the Melanain some future birth.10. The Yogi attains the Siddhi mentioned in several books, when he gets this Melana fromthe mouth of the Guru.11. The state of Siva freed from all rebirth, is achieved when the practitioner gets thisMelana from the grasp of the significance presented in the books.12. This science is, therefore, very difficult to master. Until he gets this science, the asceticshould wander over earth.13. The ascetic has physical powers or Siddhis in his hand, the moment he obtains thisscience.14. One should therefore regard as Achyuta or Vishnu, any person who imparts this Melana.He too should be regarded as Achyuta, who gives this science. He who teaches the practice, shouldbe regarded as Siva.15. You have got the science from me. You should not reveal it to others. One who knowsthis science, should practise it with all his efforts. Except to those who deserve it, he should give itto none.16. One who is able to teach the Divine Yoga, is the Guru. To the place where he lives, oneshould go. Then, learn from him the science of Khechari.17. Taught well by him, one should at first practise it carefully. A person will then attain theSiddhi of Khechari, by means of this science.114KUNDALINI YOGA"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"18. One becomes the Lord of Khecharas or the Devas, by joining with Khechari Shakti (viz.,Kundalini Shakti) by means of this science of Khechari. He lives amongst them, always.THE KHECHARI MANTRA19. Khechari contains the Bija or the seed-letter. Khechari Bija is spoken of as Agniencircled with water. It is the abode of the Devas or the Khecharas. The mastery of the Siddhi isobtained by this Yoga.20. The ninth letter or Bija of Somamsa or the Moon face, should be pronounced in thereverse order. Then consider it as the Supreme and its beginning as fifth. This is said to be Kuta(horns) of the several Bhinnas (or parts) of the moon.21. Through the initiation of a Guru, this which tends to the accomplishment of all Yogas,should be learnt.22. One who recites this twelve times everyday will not get even in sleep that Maya orillusion which is born in his body and is the source of all vicious deeds.23. To the one who recites this five lakhs of times with very great care, the science ofKhechari will reveal itself. For him, all obstacles vanish. The Devas are pleased. Without doubt, thedestruction of the greyness of hair and wrinkles, Valipalita, will take place.24. One who has acquired the great science, should practise it constantly. Otherwise, he willnot get any Siddhi in the path of Khechari.25. If in this practice, one does not get this nectar-like science, he should get it in thebeginning of Melana and recite it always. Otherwise, one who is without it never gets Siddhi.26. No sooner one gets this science, than one should practise it. It is then that one will soonget the Siddhi.27. The seven syllables HRIM, BHAM, SAM, PAM, PHAM, SAM and KSHAM constitutethe Khechari Mantra.THE CUTTING OF FRENUM LINGUI28. A knower of the Atman, having drawn out the tongue from the root of the palate, shouldin accordance with the advice of his Guru, clear the impurities of the tongue for seven days.29. He should take a sharp, oiled and cleansed knife which resembles the leaf of the plantSnuhi, the milk-hedge plant, and should cut for the space of a hair, the frenum lingui. He shouldpowder Saindhava or the rock-salt and Pathya or the sea-salt and apply it to that place.30. On the seventh day, he should again cut for the space of a hair. Thus, with great care, heshould continue it always, for the span of six months.115YOGA-KUNDALINI UPANISHAD"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"31. The root of the tongue, fixed with veins, ceases to be in six months. Then the Yogi whoknows timely action should encircle with cloth the tip of the tongue, the abode of Vag-Ishvari or thedeity presiding over speech, and should draw it up.THE TONGUE REACHES THE BRAHMARANDHRA32. O Sage, again by daily drawing it up for six months, it comes as far as the middle of theeyebrows and obliquely up to the opening of the ears. By gradual practice, it goes up to the root ofthe chin.33. Then, with ease it goes up to the end of the hair (of the head) in three years. It goes upobliquely to Sakha (some part below the skull) and downwards to the well of the throat.34. It occupies Brahmarandhra, in another three years. Without doubt, it stops there.Crosswise it goes up to the top of the head and downwards to the well of the throat. Gradually itopens the great adamantine door in the head.35. One should perform the six Angas or parts of the Khechari Bija Mantra by pronouncingit in six different intonations. In order to attain all the Siddhis, one should do this.36. Karanyasa or the motions of the fingers and hands in the pronunciation of the Mantras,should be done gradually. Karanyasa should never be done all at a time, because the body of onewho does it all at once will soon decay. O best of the Sages, little by little it should be practised.37. One should, when the tongue goes to the Brahmarandhra through the outer path, placethe tongue after moving the bolt of Brahma. The bolt of Brahma cannot be mastered by the Devas.38. On doing this with the point of the finger for three years, the Yogi should make thetongue enter within. It enters the Brahmadvara or hole. On entering the Brahmadvara, one shouldpractise well Mathana or churning.39. Even without Mathana, some wise Yogis attain Siddhi. He also accomplishes it withoutMathana, who is versed in Khechari Mantra. One reaps the fruit soon by doing Japa and Mathana.40. The Yogi should restrain his breath in his heart, by connecting a wire made of gold,silver or iron with the nostrils by means of a thread soaked in milk. Sitting in a convenient posture,with his eyes concentrated between his eyebrows, he should perform Mathana slowly.41. The State of Mathana becomes natural like sleep in children, within six months. It is notadvisable to do Mathana always. It should be done once only in every month.THE URDHVAKUNDALINI YOGA42. A Yogi should not revolve his tongue in the path. Twelve years of this practice, willsurely give the Siddhi to the Yogi. Then the Yogi perceives the entire universe in his body as notbeing different from the Atman.116KUNDALINI YOGA"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"43. O Chief of Kings, this path of the Urdhva Kundalini or the higher Kundalini, conquersthe macrocosm. Here ends the second chapter.MELANA MANTRA1.Melanamantra:—Hrim, Bham, Sam, Sham, Pham, Sam and Ksham.2. The Lotus-born Brahma said: Among new moon, the first day of the lunar fortnight andfull moon, O Shankara, which is spoken of as the Mantra’s sign? In the first day of lunar fortnightand during new moon and full moon days, it should be made firm. There is no other way or time.SENSE-OBJECTS, MANAS AND BANDHANA3. Through passion, a person longs for an object. He is infatuated with passion for objects.These two one should leave. The Niranjana or the Stainless should be sought after. All that onethinks is favourable to oneself should be abandoned.4. The Yogin should keep the Manas in the midst of Shakti, and the Shakti in the midst ofManas. He should look into Manas by means of Manas. It is then that he leaves even the higheststage.5. Manas alone is the Bindu. It is the cause of creation and preservation.6. Like curd from milk, it is only through Manas that Bindu is produced. The organ ofManas is not that which is situated in the middle of Bandhana. Bandhana is there where Shakti isbetween the Sun and the Moon.THE ENTRY INTO THE SUKHA-MANDALA7. The Yogi should stand in the seat of Bindu and close the nostrils, having knownSushumna and its Bheda or piercing and making the Vayu go in the middle.8. After knowing Vayu, the above-mentioned Bindu and the Sattva-Prakriti as well as thesix Chakras, one should enter the sphere of happiness, Sahasrara or the Sukha-Mandala.THE SIX CHAKRAS9. There are six chakras. Muladhara is in the anus. Svadhishthana is near the genital organ.Manipuraka is in the navel. Anahata is in the heart.10. The Vishuddhi Chakra is at the root of the neck. The sixth Chakra, the Ajna is in the head(between the two eyebrows).11. After gaining a knowledge of these six Mandalas or spheres, one should enter theSukhamandala, drawing up the Vayu and sending it upwards.117YOGA-KUNDALINI UPANISHAD"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"12. He becomes one with Brahmanda, the macrocosm, who practises thus the control ofVayu. Vayu, Bindu, Chitta, and Chakra should be mastered by him.ABHYASA AND BRAHMA JNANA13. Through Samadhi alone, the Yogis attain the nectar of equality.14. Without the practice of Yoga, the lamp of wisdom does not arise, even as the fire latentin the sacrificial wood does not appear without churning.15. The fire in a vessel does not shed light outside. But, when the vessel is broken, its lightappears without.16. One’s body is called the vessel. The seat of “That” is the light or the fire within. When,through the words of a Guru, the body is broken, the light of Brahmajnana becomes resplendent.17. One crosses the subtle body and the ocean of Samsara, with the Guru as the helmsman,and through the affinities of Abhyasa.THE FOUR KINDS OF VAK18. Sprouting in Para, Vak (power of speech) gives forth two leaves in Pasyanti, buds forthin Madhyama and blossoms in Vaikhari—that Vak, earlier described, reaches the stage of theabsorption of sound, reversing the above order, viz., beginning with Vaikhari, etc.19. Para, Pasyanti, Madhyama and Vaikhari, are the four kinds of Vak. Para is the highest ofsounds. Vaikhari is the lowest of sounds.20. Vak begins from the highest of sounds to the lowest, in evolution.21. In involution it takes a reverse order in order to merge in Para or the highest subtlesound.22. Anyone who thinks that the One who is the great Lord of that Vak, the undifferentiated,the Illuminator of that Vak is the Self—such a person who thinks over thus, is never effected bywords, high or low, good or bad.THE ABSORPTION IN PARAMATMAN23. Through the absorption of their respective Upadhis or vehicles all these in turn areabsorbed in the Pratyagatma—the three aspects of consciousness, Visva, Taijasa, and Prajna inman, the three, Virat, Hiranyagarbha, and Ishvara in the universe, the egg of the universe, the egg ofman and the seven worlds.24. Heated by the fire of Jnana, the egg is absorbed with its Karana or cause, intoParamatman or the universal Self. It becomes one with Parabrahman.118KUNDALINI YOGA"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"25. It is then neither steadiness nor depth, neither light nor darkness, neither describable nordistinguishable. That alone remains which is the Be-ness or the Sat.THE ESSENTIAL NATURE OF MAN26. Like a light in a vessel, the Atman is within the body—thus one should think.27. Atman is of the dimensions of a thumb. It is a light without smoke. It is without form. Itis shining within the body. It is undifferentiable and immortal.28. The first three aspects of consciousness refer to the gross, subtle and Karana bodies ofman. The second three aspects of consciousness refer to the three bodies of the universe.29. In his formation, man is and appears as an egg, even as the universe is and appears as anegg.30. During the states of waking, dreaming and dreamless sleep, the Vijnana Atma whichdwells in this body is deluded by Maya.31. But, after many births, owing to the effect of good Karma, it wishes to attain its ownessential state.32. The enquiry sets in. Who am I? How has this stain of mundane existence come to me? Inthe dreamless sleep what becomes of me who am engaged in business during both the states,waking and dreaming?33. The Chidabhasa is the result of non-wisdom. It is burnt by the wise thoughts, even as abale of cotton is burnt by fire, and also by its own supreme illumination.34. The burning of the outer body is no burning at all.35. Pratyagatma is in the Dahara (Akasa or the ether of the heart). It obtains, when theworldly wisdom is destroyed, Vijnana, and diffuses itself everywhere and in an instant burns thetwo sheaths, Vijnanamaya and Manomaya. Then, it is He Himself that shines always within. Itshines like a light within a vessel.36. Till sleep and till death, the Muni who contemplates thus should be known as aJivanmukta.VIDEHA MUKTI37. He has done what ought to be done. Therefore, he is a fortunate person.38. Such a person attains Videhamukti, having given up even the state of Jivanmukti.119YOGA-KUNDALINI UPANISHAD"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"39. No sooner the body wears off, than he obtains the emancipation in a disembodied state,Videhamukti. The state, as if of moving in the air, he gains.NON-DUAL BRAHMAN40. After that, That alone remains. That is the soundless, the touchless, the formless and thedeathless.41. That is the Rasa or the Essence. It is eternal and odourless. It is greater than the great; ithas neither beginning nor end. It is the permanent, the stainless and the decayless. Thus ends theYoga-Kundalini Upanishad.KUNDALINI YOGAThe Yogin who works for liberation does so through Kundalini Yoga which gives bothenjoyment and liberation. At every centre to which he rouses Kundalini he experiences special formof bliss and gains special powers. Carrying Her to Siva at his cerebral centre, he enjoys the Supremebliss which in its nature is that of Liberation and which when established in permanence isLiberation itself on the loosening of spirit and body.Energy (Sakti) polarises itself into two forms namely, static or potential (Kundalini)dynamic (the working forces of the body as Prana). Behind all activity there is a static background.This static centre in the human body is the centre serpent-power in the Muladhara (root support).This static Sakti is affected by Pranayama and other Yogic processes and becomes dynamic.Thus when completely dynamic that is when Kundalini unites with Siva in the Sahasrara thepolarisation of the body gives way. The two poles are united in one and there is the state ofconsciousness called Samadhi. The polarisation, of course, takes place in consciousness. The bodyactually continues to exist as an object of observation to others. It continues its organic life. Butman’s consciousness of his body and all other objects, is withdrawn because the mind has ceased sofar as his consciousness is concerned, the function having been withdrawn into its ground which isConsciousness.When awakened, Kundalini Sakti ceases to be a static power which sustains theworld-consciousness, the content of which is held only so long as she sleeps; and when once set inmovement Kundalini is drawn to that other static centre in the Thousand-petalled Lotus (Sahasrara)to attain union with the Siva Consciousness or the consciousness of ecstasy beyond the world offorms. When Kundalini sleeps man is awake to this world. When she wakes he sleeps i.e. loses allconsciousness of the world and enters the causal body. In Yoga he passes beyond to formlessconsciousness.Pranayama for Awakening Kundalini: When you practice the following, concentrate on theMuladhara Chakra at the base of the spinal column which is triangular in form and which is the seatof the Kundalini Sakti. Close the right nostril with your right thumb. Inhale through the left nostriltill you count 3 Oms slowly. Imagine that you are drawing the Prana with the atmospheric air. Thenclose the left nostril with your little and ring fingers of the right hand. Then retain the breath for 12120KUNDALINI YOGA"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"Oms. Send the current down the spinal column straight into the triangular lotus, the MuladharaChakra. Imagine that the nerve-current is striking against the Lotus and awakening the Kundalini.Then slowly exhale through the right nostril counting 6 Oms. Repeat the process from the rightnostril as stated above using the same units and having the same imagination and feeling. ThisPranayama will awaken the Kundalini quickly. Do it 3 times in the morning and 3 times in theevening. Increase the number and time gradually and cautiously according to your strength andcapacity. In this Pranayama concentration on the Muladhara Chakra is the important thing,Kundalini will be awakened quickly if the degree of concentration is intense and if the Pranayama ispractised regularly.KUNDALINI PRANAYAMAIn this Pranayama, the Bhavana is more important than the ratio between Puraka,Kumbhaka and Rechaka.Sit in Padma or Siddha Asana facing the East or the North.After mentally prostrating to the lotus-feet of the Sat-guru and reciting Stotras in praise ofGod and Guru, commence doing this Pranayama which will easily lead to the awakening of theKundalini.Inhale deeply without making any sound. As you inhale, feel that the Kundalini lyingdormant in the Muladhara Chakra is awakened and is going up from Chakra to Chakra. At theconclusion of the Puraka, have the Bhavana that the Kundalini has reached the Sahasrara. The morevivid the visualisation of Chakra after Chakra, the more rapid will be your progress in this Sadhana.Retain the breath for a short while. Repeat the Pranava or your Ishta Mantra.

Afterwards powder of turmeric is dusted over it.This is continued for some months. This is Chhedan.Afterwards the Yogic student applies butter to the tongue and lengthens it daily. He drawsthe tongue in such a way that it is similar to the process of milking the udder of a cow. This isDohan.When the tongue is sufficiently long (it should touch the tip of the nose) the student folds it,takes it back and closes the posterior portion of the nostrils. Now he sits and meditates. The breathstops completely.For some the cutting and the lengthening of the tongue is not necessary. They are born witha long tongue.He who has attained perfection in this Mudra becomes a walker in the sky.

Byconvention, all practices that help the attainment of this goal are also called Yoga.Vedanta says that the individual soul is enveloped by five sheaths—Annamaya Kosha (thegross body), Pranamaya Kosha (vital sheath), Manomaya Kosha (the mind), Vijnanamaya Kosha(the intellect), and Anandamaya Kosha (the bliss-sheath or the ignorance that immediately veils theSelf), and that the goal of life, viz., Self-realisation is attained by negating the five sheaths andpiercing the veil of ignorance.When do we regard a particular part or organ of the body as perfectly healthy? When we arenot made aware of that organ. The ear is in perfect health when we are not aware that that organexists; if there is pain we are conscious of its presence. In order to transcend the five sheaths,therefore, they must all be free from afflictions. Yoga helps you to do that.The purificatory Kriyas of Hatha Yoga and Asanas ensure health of the body and free itfrom ailments. Pranayama revitalises the vital sheath. Pratyahara (withdrawal of the rays of themind and restraining them from flowing outwards) and Dharana (concentration) strengthen themind. Meditation brings about a happy blending of the intellect and intuition; and the Yogi’sintelligence becomes intuitive. Samadhi illumines the soul and reveals the Self, by piercing the veilof ignorance. This is Yoga, the perfect system of all-round self-culture.But no one can embark on this noble enterprise without preparing the vessel. Yama-Niyamaor the canons of right conduct, ensure this. One who has not controlled his senses, who is nottruthful, kind, compassionate and pure, cannot make any progress in Sadhana. Energy leaks outthrough all the avenues of his body. His vital sheath is debilitated. His mind is completelyextroverted. His intellect is dull. His soul is enveloped in dense darkness. Meditation for such a manis only a dream. Therefore I insist on all spiritual aspirants that they should:—127YOGA-KUNDALINI UPANISHAD"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"1. Engage themselves in Nishkama Karma Yoga, for self-purification and cultivation ofvirtues; and2. Practise as much Japa as possible, in order to earn His Grace.These two—Karma Yoga and Bhakti Yoga—cannot be overemphasised.Once the senses are controlled, and the heart purified, control of mind, concentration of itsrays, and meditation become very easy. The aspirant would do well to remember the two greatwatch-words of Sadhana—(a) Abhyasa (unrelenting, intense, unbroken, regular and systematic practice),(b) Vairagya (dispassion, aversion to all sensual enjoyments, non-attachment to objects ofsenses).To the extent to which the aspirant grows in these two, to that extent will his mindwant tomeditate. There will be joy in meditation. The mind will look forward to the period of meditation.When this condition becomes intense, then the mind will be in a constant state of meditation. Asyour hands are engaged in the work of the day, the mind will be blissfully detached from the world,peacefully witnessing—Sakshi-Bhava—the play of the senses and the sense-objects. When you areestablished in this state, you are a perfected Yogi. You have only to sit and close your eyes; you willinstantly transcend the five sheaths and merge in the Supreme Soul. Your actions will be in tunewith the Divine Will. You will have the superhuman powers of intellect, mind and body. You willnever be tired, dull or depressed. Your words will have life-transforming power. Your heart will befull of compassion and love for humanity, and all humanity will be drawn towards you. You willbecome a spiritual magnet. You will shine as a Yogi, sage and Jivanmukta. You are liberated. Thisis the Goal.May God bless you.THE GRADATIONAL ASCENT OF THE MINDThe Chakras are centres of Shakti as vital force—in other words, these are centres ofPranashakti manifested by Pranavayu in the living body, the presiding Devatas of which are thenames for the Universal Consciousness as it manifests in the form of these centres. The Chakras arenot perceptible in the gross senses. Even if they were perceptible in the living body which they helpto organise they disappear with the disintegration of organism at death.Purity of mind leads to perfection in Yoga. Regulate your conduct when you deal withothers. Have no feeling of jealousy towards others. Be compassionate. Do not hate sinners. Be kindto all. Success in Yoga will be rapid if you put your maximum energy in your Yoga practice. Youmust have a keen longing for liberation and intense Vairagya also. You must be sincere and earnest.Intense and constant meditation is necessary for entering into Samadhi.128KUNDALINI YOGA"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"The mind of a worldly man with base desires and passions moves in the Muladhara andSvadhishthana Chakras or centres situated near the anus and the reproductive organ respectively.If one’s mind becomes purified the mind rises to the Manipura Chakra or the centre in thenavel and experiences some power and joy.If the mind becomes more purified, it rises to the Anahata Chakra or centre in the heart,experiences bliss and visualises the effulgent form of the Ishta Devata or the tutelary deity.When the mind gets highly purified, the meditation and devotion become intense andprofound, the mind rises to Vishuddha Chakra or the centre in the throat and experiences more andmore powers and bliss. Even when the mind has reached this centre, there is possibility for it tocome down to the lower centres.When the Yogi reaches the Ajna Chakra or the centre between the two eyebrows he attainsSamadhi and realises the supreme Self or Brahman. There is a slight sense of separateness betweenthe devotee and Brahman.If he reaches the spiritual centre in the brain, the Sahasrara Chakra, the thousand-petalledlotus the Yogi attains Nirvikalpa Samadhi or superconscious state—He becomes one with thenon-dual Brahman.

There is Triputi, the seer, sight and seen;or knower, knowledge and knowable. There is some link with Prakriti or matter. SavikalpaSamadhi cannot give the final emancipation. This is also an obstacle to Nirvikalpa Samadhi. Theaspirant gets false contentment and stops his meditation or Sadhana. Hence this is an obstacle to thefinal or higher realisation. Nirvikalpa Samadhi alone can burn all Samskaras and Vasanasin toto.Savikalpa Samadhi cannot destroy all Samskaras and Vasanas. In Savikalpa Samadhi the life-forceor Prana of the Yogi is withdrawn from the body. The body appears to be dead, motionless andrigid. Breathing is suspended. He is aware of his bodily condition or suspended breath.Nirvikalpa or Nirbija Samadhi is timeless, changeless. This is the highest state of Samadhi.DOUBLE CONSCIOUSNESSIn Nirvikalpa Samadhi, the Yogi’s consciousness merges with the absolute consciousness.There is no bodily fixation. In his ordinary waking consciousness, even in the midst of worldlyduties, he is in communion with the supreme consciousness. He has double-consciousness.The crow has one eye-ball, but two sockets. It turns the eye-balls, now to one socket andafterwards to the other socket.

Vacillation and oscillation will retardprogress and result in stagnation.Reflect gradually and choose a method; choose a method and stick to it and persevere in itcontinuously. This Nishtha is necessary.A man who digs a well should not dig a foot here, a foot there, a few feet in another placeand then a fourth.
