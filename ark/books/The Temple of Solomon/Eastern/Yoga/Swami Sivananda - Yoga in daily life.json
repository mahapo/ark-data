Airi writes:“His Holiness Sri Swami Sivananda Saraswati needs scarcely any introduction to the vastmultitudes of reading public that pants for spiritual unfoldment and Self-Realisation. The reveredYogi belongs to the ages and ranks amongst the blessed souls who have had the good fortune totaste the Nectar of Cosmic Consciousness. In clear, simple and impressive style the Swamiaddresses the young and yet inexperienced spiritual aspirants and lays down before them thefundamentals of spirituality and the various means essentially requisite for Divine Wisdom.”“This book is a message from the great Yogi of the Himalayas to the helpless andbewildered seekers of Truth. This inspiring and soul-stirring little volume will, we venture to say,undoubtedly contribute its mite to the moral and spiritual perfection of the human race in generaland the aspirants in particular. As we wish to present this volume in a popular and a presentablestyle, it is printed on good paper and got up excellently well. If this book appeals to thebroad-minded and expanded hearts amongst the religious reformers and also aspirants, thePublishers’ labours will have been sufficiently recompensed.”We reiterate Sri Airi’s pious wish as we offer this priceless treasure to the blessedaspirant-world.THE DIVINE LIFE SOCIETYAUTHOR’S PREFACEMan wants happiness. He shuns pain. He makes various sorts of efforts (Pravritti) to gethappiness from objects and gets himself entangled in the meshes or snares of Maya. As theseobjects are perishable, finite and conditioned in time, space and causation, he fails to get the desiredhappiness from the objects. This world is Apurna (imperfect) and there is uncertainty of life. Abarrister talks at the telephone, ascends the staircase to take his meals upstairs and dies on thestaircase.There is not an iota of happiness in objects and they are Jada (insentient). Even the sensualpleasure is a reflection of Atmic Bliss only. Just as a dog which sucks a dry bone in the streetsimagines foolishly that the blood comes from the dry bone, whereas, it really oozes from its ownpalate, so also worldly-minded persons foolishly imagine that the happiness they enjoy comes fromthe objects only.There is a mental uneasiness, dissatisfaction, discontent and restlessness even inmulti-millionaires and kings. Some kind of sorrow, misery or pain is always present even when youiii"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"are in the height of enjoyment of worldly pleasures. When the marriage of your second son iscelebrated the remembrance of your first son who passed away, torments your mind. Mind is soconstituted that the rhythm of pleasure and pain is kept up like the rhythm of systole and diastole(contraction and dilation) of heart. You entertain the idea that the happiness will pass away soon.This adds pain when you are in the enjoyment of sensual pleasure.You can find eternal, infinite, supreme peace and bliss, only in the Atman of your heart. It isan embodiment of bliss (Ananda Swarupa).All objects that you see consist of five parts, viz. Nama-Rupa-Asti-Bhati-Priya (name,form, existence, knowledge, bliss). Nama and Rupa constitute the world. They are the cause forhuman activities and sufferings. Asti, Bhati and Priya are the Svarupas of Atman or Brahman orMoksha.Amongst the things desired by human beings of this world, Moksha alone is the best andhighest thing. The means (Sadhan) for Moksha is Atma Jnana (knowledge of the Self or Atman),Vichara of “Who am I?” or significance of “Tat Tvam Asi” Mahavakya. This is the means forattainment of Brahma Jnana.Moksha is desired in order to get rid of the pains of Samsara which are in the form of birth,death, disease, old age, etc. Moksha can hardly be attained without Sadhana.Some say, that Karma is the Sadhan for Moksha. Some other say, that Karma and Jnanacombined (Samucchayavada) is the means. Sri Shankara has refuted the Karma and Samucchayatheories by strong, sound, convincing arguments and has established the Truth that Kevala Jnana(pure knowledge alone) is the means for Moksha. Just as fire is the direct means for cooking food,so also Brahma Jnana is the Sakshat Sadhana (direct means) for Moksha. The famous MandanaMisra (Sureshwaracharya) disciple of Sri Sankara has also said in his reputed book NaishkarmaSiddhi that Kevala Jnana alone is the means for Moksha.Do not say: “Karma. Karma. My Karma has brought me like this.” Exert. Exert. DoPurushartha. Do Tapas. Concentrate. Purify. Meditate. Do not become a fatalist. Do not yield toinertia. Do not bleat like a lamb. Roar OM, OM, OM like a lion of Vedanta. See how Markandeyawho was destined to die at his sixteenth year became a Chiranjeevi, an immortal boy of sixteenyears on account of his Tapas! Also note how Savitri brought back to life by her Tapas her deadhusband; how Benjamin Franklin and late Sri T. Muthuswamy Iyer of Madras High Court elevatedthemselves. Remember, my friends, that man is the master of his own destiny. Visvamitra Rishi,who was a Kshatriya Raja, became a Brahma Rishi like Vasishtha and even created a third world forTrishanku by his power of Tapas. Rogue Ratnakar became the sage Valmiki through Tapas. RoguesJagai and Madai of Bengal became highly developed Saints. They became the disciples of LordGauranga. What others have done, you also can do. There is no doubt of this.You can also do wonders and miracles if you apply yourself to spiritual Sadhana, Tapas andmeditation.

CeaselesslyHave self-confidence. Develop independent judgment. Cultivate the indomitable will.Practise self-control and self-mastery.Do not argue. Strive ceaselessly for Self-realisation. Kill this little ego. Develop pure love.Rise above all distinction of caste, creed and colour.Give up the idea of “I-ness” and “mine-ness”. Look within for the happiness which youhave sought in vain in sensual objects.Happiness WithinOne anna of pleasure is mixed with fifteen annas of pain. Pleasure that is mixed with painand fear is no pleasure at all. If you begin to analyse this one anna of pleasure, you will find that it isno pleasure at all. It is mere play or delusion of the mind. Milk gives pleasure to some and pain toothers. Milk brings on retching in fever. The third cup of milk induces vomiting. What is this? Thisis play of Maya. This is Indra-Jala of Avidya-Shakti. The Indriyas and mind are deceiving you atevery moment. Beware. Wake up. Open your eyes. Develop Viveka. If you suffer from cancer ofthe stomach, can you enjoy Rasagulla and sweets even though you are a multi-millionaire? Thedoctor will put you on a diet of pepper-water only. If your wife dies, you are drowned in sorrow.You cannot expect happiness from finite, perishable objects that are conditioned in time, space andcausation. Nitya Nirupadhika, Niratisaya Ananda, eternal, independent, infinite bliss can only behad in the Atman that is hidden in your heart. Search, understand and realise Atman.Need For Adhyatmic KnowledgeThe secular knowledge that you get from Universities is mere husk only. It serves thepurpose of earning the bread only. It cannot give you peace of mind and salvation. It thickens theveil of ignorance only. He who says, “I am specialist in Biology and various logies” is only a fool.One Mantra, one Sloka of the Upanishads will blow up the knowledge that you derive fromcolleges. Study the first Mantra of Isa Upanishad: “Isavasyam idam sarvam—The whole world isindwelt by the Lord.” Rejoice in Atman by removing the names and forms. Do not be covetous.Imbibe the ideas of this Mantra. Practise. Feel the indwelling presence. Live in the spirit of theMantra. You will become a King of kings, Emperor of emperors, the Sun of suns, the Light oflights. Do not be puffed up with your University degrees. Be humble. Destroy scientific atheism.Have faith in the teaching of Srutis. Do Kirtan in a chorus with harmony and concord, with oneSvara and one Tala. Sing Rama Nama from the bottom of your heart with Bhava. I will make yourealise the infinite peace and bliss this very moment.1"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Importance Of GuruGuru-Bhakti is absolutely necessary. Guru-Seva with Atma-Lakshya will take you to Godimmediately. People generally complain: “We do not get good Gurus these days.” This is a lameexcuse. You can take even the worst possible rogue as your Guru. You will have to change yourangle of vision. When you look at a coconut made of sugar, you have a double consciousness. Youknow pretty well that it is not coconut. In your heart there is Bhava, it is sugar and sugar alone. Eventhough you see the world, it is really not. This is the Nischaya of the Vedantic student. It is thedetermination. Even so, the defects of the ‘rogue-Guru’ do not exist for the disciple who has takenhim as his Guru with Bhakti. The aspirant should deify and superimpose all the attributes of theLord on the ‘rogue-Guru’.You should never look into the defects of the Guru. You must deify the Guru. Guru, Ishvar,Brahman, Om, Truth are all one. You must strictly obey and carry out his orders. You must thinkthat underneath the name and form of the Guru, there is the all-pervading pure consciousness. Incourse of time the physical form will vanish and you will realise your own self, the pure Brahmicconsciousness that lies at the back of the physical form of your Guru. When once you have taken aman as your Guru, you should never change even if you get a man with greater developments orSiddhis. Then only you will have faith. Through strong faith, you will realise then and there,Brahman, the God in that Guru. You must become the famous Bhakta, Pipa of the well-knownBhaktamala, who took a rogue Nata as his Guru and when he saw his Nata-Guru dancing on thebamboos in the open market, he took him as Guru, the Brahma-incarnate, prostrated before him andthus eventually had his Self-realisation through the form of the rogue-Guru, the Nata.Three Requisites Of MuktiYoga is communion with Lord. The goal of life is Self-realisation. There are two ways forattaining God-consciousness. They are the Pravritti-Marga and Nivritti-Marga. Pravritti-Marga isthe path of activity with detachment for attaining the cosmic vision in and through the diverseexperiences of normal life. Nivritti-Marga is the path of absolute renunciation or Jnana-Yoga.Karma-Yoga is only Jnana-Sadhana, i.e., means for attaining Self-knowledge. Three things areindispensably requisite for attaining Self-realisation. They are: (1) Guru-Bhakti—devotion andPrema towards the spiritual preceptor, (2) Jijnasa—longing for liberation and (3) a taste forSatsanga. He alone who is endowed with these three attributes can cross this ocean of Samsara(Bhava Sager).Four Kinds Of TemperamentsThere are four kinds of temperaments, viz., the active temperament, the devotionaltemperament, the mystic temperament and the intellectual temperament.The Four YogasThere are four Yogas, viz., Karma Yoga, Bhakti Yoga, Raja Yoga and Jnana Yoga.2YOGA IN DAILY LIFE"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Karma is suitable for people of active temperament, Bhakti Yoga for people of devotionaltemperament, Raja Yoga for men of mystic temperament with bold understanding and strongwill-power. Bhakti Yoga is suitable for vast majority of persons as they are emotional. Jnana Yogais suitable for a microscopic minority only. Ladies can realise God quickly as their hearts are filledwith devotion, Prema and affection. But it is very difficult for them to get Vairagya.Yogic DietFood plays a very important role in exciting the senses and passions. An aspirant should bevery careful in the selection of articles of diet of Sattvic nature in the beginning of his Sadhanaperiod. Later on drastic dietetic restrictions can be removed. Havis Annam, which is a mixture ofboiled white rice and ghee, is very conducive to Yogic practices. When white rice is boiled withghee, white sugar and milk, it is called Cheru. This is a wholesome combination suitable forSadhakas.MilkMilk is a perfect food by itself, containing the different nutritive constituents, fats, proteins,carbohydrates, etc., in well-balanced proportions. It leaves very little residue in the bowels. This isan ideal food for Yogins during Pranayama practice. Fresh milk from a healthy cow, free frombovine tuberculosis, is preferable to scalded milk. Milk should be scalded or pasteurised but notboiled. The process of scalding is that the milk should be immediately removed from the fire, assoon as the boiling point is reached. Too much boiling destroys the vitamins, the mysteriousnutritive principles and renders milk quite useless as an article of diet.Fruit DietA fruit diet exercises a benign, soothing influence on the constitution and is very desirablediet for Yogins. This is a natural form of diet. Bananas, grapes, sweet oranges, apples,pomegranates are wholesome fruits. Bananas are very nutritious. Lemons possess anti-scorbuticproperties and act as restoratives to blood. Fruit juice contains a form of nutritive principle, VitaminC.MitaharaTake wholesome, Sattvic food half-stomachful; fill the quarter-stomachful with pure water;and allow the remaining quarter free for expansion of gas. This is Mitahara, the ideal food forYogins. This is the ideal for all who want to preserve health. This is quite hygienic and is inharmony with the dietetic principles of modern medical science. This is Mitahara prescribed forYogis.“Nathyasnatastu Yogoasti na chaikantamanasnatahNa chaathisvapnaseelasya jagratho naivacharjuna”.“Verily, Yoga is not for him who eateth too much, nor he who abstaineth to excess, nor whois too much addicted to sleep, nor even to wakefulness, O Arjuna.” (Gita VI- 16).3BASIS OF YOGA"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"“Ahara suddhau, sattva suddhih; sattva suddhau, dhruva smritih;Smritilabhe sarvagranthinam vipramokshah.”For spiritual practices Sattvic food is absolutely necessary. Wheat, rice, barley, sugar,butter, sugar-candy, milk, ghee, green dhal, Panchasakha vegetables, cabbages, potatoes, etc., areSattvic articles of diet.Forbidden ArticlesHighly seasoned dishes, hot curries and chutnies, meat, fish, etc., are forbidden forSadhakas. Meat can make a scientist, but rarely a philosopher and a Tattva Jnani. Chillies, sourarticles, tamarind, mustard, all kinds of oil, asafoetida, salt, onions, garlic, etc., should be avoided.Onions are worse than meat. Too much fasting is injurious during the practice of Yoga.NOTE: Myrobalan is a beautiful stuff for Yogins. They can chew it very frequently. InBhagavata it is represented as even superior to nourishing mother. It takes care of the body betterthan a mother does. Even a mother gets annoyed towards her child; but myrobalan has controlled itsKrodha, always possesses an even temperament and is always cheerful and enthusiastic inattending to the well-being of human beings.Section IIBHAKTI YOGABhava is the main basis of Rasa. The relish of eternal Bliss which the devotee enjoys duringhis ecstatic state of Bhava Samadhi is called Rasa.Rasa is of the essence of Lord Krishna. Rasa is the nectarine transcendental Bliss. LordKrishna is the repository or fountain-source of Rasa.Taste the Krishna-Bhakti-Rasa through Rati or Prema and attain immortality.Bhakti is intense devotion towards God. It is Prema of Prabhu. Sraddha and Visvas are theincipient stages of devotion. They develop into Bhakti. Later on faith is the most important thing inthe path of devotion.The qualifications for the attainment of Bhakti are a pure loving heart, faith, innocence,simplicity, truthfulness, Arjava, Vairagya and Brahmacharya.God looks upon all with an equal eye. We all know how Sri Ramachandra ate the fruitsalready tasted by the Bhilini Sabari. Sudama’s grains are more welcome to Lord Krishna than themost sumptuous feast that can be offered by a mighty potentate on this earth. What He wants is yourloving heart. He neither wants a big temple nor rich presents from you.4YOGA IN DAILY LIFE"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Bhakti can be acquired and cultivated. Constant Satsanga with devotees and Bhagavatas,repetition of His Name, Sri Ram, Sita Ram, Hari Om, etc., constant remembrance of the Lord,prayer, study of religious books such as the Ramayana, the Bhagavata, Hari Kirtan, service ofBhaktas, etc., can infuse Bhakti in your heart.Lust, anger, greed, Moha, pride, jealousy, hatred, egoism, desire for power, name and fame,hypocrisy are all obstacles in the way of Bhakti Yoga.Remove lust by entertaining pure thoughts; anger by love, Kshama, etc.; greed by charity,honesty, disinterestedness; Moha by Viveka; pride by humility (Namrata, Vinaya); jealousy bymagnanimity, nobility and Mudita; hatred by love; and egoism by unconditioned, unreserved andungrudging self-surrender to the Lord, Atmanivedana or Saranagati.Pray fervently like Prahlada. Sing His Name like Radha. Weep in solitude like Mira onaccount of Viraha Agni. Do Kirtan like Lord Gauranga. Sing Bhajan like Ram Prasad of Bengal.Dance in Divine ecstasy like Chaitanya Maha Prabhu and enter into Bhava Samadhi. Repeat HisName like Valmiki, Tukaram or Ram Das.Be up and doing, my dear friends, in spiritual Sadhana, Bhajan, etc. Never waste a singleminute. Wasting time is the highest sin. Lord Rama will surely crown your efforts with success.Combine all the love you cherish towards all worldly objects, wife, son, wealth, property,relatives, friends and then apply this combined love towards God. You will realise in this verysecond.Repeat His name 200 Malas daily (200x108=21,600 times). Sing His praise. Do HariKirtan. Repeat His Stotras and hymns. Live in Ayodhya, Brindavan, Pandharpur, Mathura for somemonths. Control the Indriyas. Eat simple food. Wear simple clothing. Lead a simple, natural life.You will develop Bhakti soon. Cultivate Vairagya towards sensual objects. Have Mithya andDosha Drishti for objects. Objects are unreal, perishable. They are attended with various sorts ofpains and miseries. Vairagya will come by itself. Raga for objects is an enemy of Bhakti.Repeat the formulae “I am Thine. All is Thine. Thy Will be done.” Have perfectself-surrender. Then only you will have Darshan of God. Do not keep any desires for you. Destroyegoism completely. A Bhakta gets Salokya, Sameepya and Sayujya Mukti. He lives near God. Heserves God. He enjoys all His Aishvaryas. He gets Krama Mukti. In the end he gets Jnana.Where Is God?Where is God? Is He only in the temples, churches or Musjids? No. Is He only in the fourVedas or Upavedas or six Vedangas or six schools of philosophy or eighteen Puranas or sixty-foursciences? ‘No’. Is He in the places of pilgrimage or Tirthas alone? No. No. No. Where is He then?“Hridi Sarvasya Tishthitam(Gita XIII-17)—Wisdom, the object of Wisdom, seated in the hearts ofall.” He is not very far. He is quite close to you.“Anoraniyan mahato mahian atmasya jantornihatoguhayam.”Subtler than the subtlest, greater than the greatest, He is located in the cavity of yourheart, in the innermost recesses or chambers, the Hridaya Kamala.5BHAKTI YOGA"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"“Nayamatma pravachanena labhyo na medhaya na bahuna srutena”(Katha Upanishad).Not by arguments, not by extreme intelligence, not by the voracious and wide study of scriptures,will you reach God. You can reach Him by sincere Sadhana or ascetic spiritual practices. Avoidwrangling and vain quibbling. Make genuine efforts.Mysterious Help From The Lord To BhaktasO faithless ones! Just hear the life-history of Roopkala Bhagavan of Ayodhya and thesoldier-Bhakta of Punjab. Roopkala Bhagavan was a famous Bhakta in Ayodhya. It was he whostarted the All-India-Kirtan. He died a few years ago. He was a native of Chapra near Benares. Hewas the Inspector of Schools. He was a sincere devotee of Sri Rama. One day he was absorbed inmeditation. He did not visit a school for inspection. Lord Rama Himself assumed the form of theinspector through his Yoga-Maya-Sakti, inspected the school boys, signed in the register anddisappeared. When the inspector came to the school next morning, the teachers said that he waspresent all along in the school the previous day and showed him his signature in the register. He wasvery much astonished. This one evidence gave him much encouragement. He instantaneouslyresigned his post and went to Ayodhya to spend the rest of his life in communion with Lord Rama.Have you not heard of a recent Punjab incident? A soldier, a sincere Rama-Bhakta, was on patrolduty at night. One night a fine Kirtan-party was moving about quite close to the soldier. The soldierwas much moved by deep devotion, left his duty and joined the Kirtan-party. He enjoyed the Kirtanto his heart’s content. In the depth of higher emotions, he entered into Bhava-Samadhi, the ecstaticstate of Bhaktas. When he returned at 6 a.m. he enquired the Subedar-Major whether anythinghappened during his absence. The Subedar said, “Nothing happened. I saw you always on the patrolduty.” The Bhakta soldier was extremely surprised to hear the statement of the Subedar. He thoughtit was all the Grace of Rama. Rama Himself took charge of patrol duty to protect His devotee. Heassumed the form of the soldier. When the Bhakta came to know of this incident, he immediatelyresigned his post and went to Ayodhya to spend his whole life in devotion. My dear brother, do notbecome a sceptic. If you are sincere in your devotion, you will have Darshan of God face to face thisvery moment.What Is Japa?Japa is the repetition of any Mantra or Name of the Lord. In this Kaliyuga, Japa is an easyway for God-realisation. Tukaram, Dhruva, Valmiki, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Narsi Mehta,Gauranga, Ramdas, Mira—all had attained salvation by uttering the name of God. Why not youalso, my dear friends, my amiable comrades? Japa is an important Anga of Yoga.Any Mantra is powerful. It is a mass of radiant energy. Japa is of three kinds:(1)Vaikharior verbal with Ucchara.(2)Upamsuwith humming sound.(3)Manasikawherein the lips do not move. It is done with the mind and mind alone.6YOGA IN DAILY LIFE"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Upamsu brings fruits thousand times more than that of Vaikhari. Manasika brings fruitscrores of times than Vaikhari.Mind wants varieties, new sensations. It gets disgusted with monotony. Just as you wantbrinjal vegetable today, Lauki tomorrow and Parwal day after tomorrow, the mind wants varietiesin Japa also; otherwise it becomes dull. It refuses to work.Do Vaikhari for some time, then Upamsu for some time and then Manasika for some time.The repetition of a Mantra serves as a gate-keeper. When the mind runs away, the repetition of theMantra will at once tell you that some other evil-intruding thoughts have entered the mind.Benefits Of JapaThere is Mantra Sakti and Mantra Chaitanya in every Mantra. It changes the mentalsubstance from passion to purity, from Rajas into Sattva. It calms, strengthens the mind. It makesthe mind Antarmukha, introspective. It checks the outgoing tendencies of the mind. It eradicates allkinds of evil thoughts and inclinations. It destroys Vasanas and reduces the force of thought.Eventually it leads to the direct Darshan of God or Ishta Devata. Japa purifies the mind, inducesVairagya, destroys Vasanas and brings you face to face with God.Instructions On JapaHave Suddha, Sattvic Bhava when you repeat the Mantra. Repeat the Mantra at least 21,600times daily, to correspond with the 21,600 Soham breaths.You must do the Japa regularly. The shorter the Mantra the greater is the concentration. Ofall the Mantras, Rama, Rama, Rama is the best. It is easy to repeat also. If you are tired of repeatingthe Mantra at one stroke, have three or more sittings; from morning 4 to 7, evening 4 to 5 and night 6to 8.Repeat the Mantra very quickly for some time and when you find that the mind is wanderingmuch then repeat it slowly. The golden rule is to repeat the Mantra neither too slow nor too quick.Observe the happy medium.Everyone of you should have a separate meditation room. Make a small enclosure in acorner of a room with screen and sit for Japa if you cannot manage to get a separate room. Do notallow anybody to frequent the place.

Fromlust follow the ten vices that are mentioned in Manusamhita—love of hunting, gambling, sleepingby day, slandering, company with bad women, drinking, singing love-songs, vulgar music,dancing, aimlessly wandering about.Anger begets eight kinds of vices. All evil qualities proceed from anger. If you can eradicateanger all bad qualities will die of themselves. The eight vices are: Injustice, rashness, persecution,jealousy, taking possession of others’ property, harsh words and cruelty.How are Bhaktas to be known? Lord Krishna has given a description of them. You will findit in Bhagavatam. “They do not care for anything. Their hearts are fixed on Me. They are veryhumble. They have equal vision.

Perfect love is knowledge. SriSankara, the Advaita Kevala Jnani, was a great Bhakta of Lord Hari, Hara and Devi. Jnana Deva ofAlandi, Poona, a great Yogi of late, was a Bhakta of Lord Krishna. Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsaworshipped Kali and got Jnana through Swami Totapuri, his Advaita Guru. Lord Chaitanya was afine Advaita Vedantic Scholar, and yet he danced in streets and market places, singing Hari’snames. Appaya Dikshitar, a famous Jnani of Adaipalam, North Arcot District, Madras, the authorof Siddhanta Lesha and various other Vedantic books was a devotee of Lord Siva. It behoves,therefore, that Bhakti can be combined with much advantage with Jnana.May we hear with our ears and see with our eyes nothing but what is pure, so that with oursenses unperturbed, remembering God, meditating on Him, singing His praise and repeating Hisname, we may attain life as that of the Gods. Om Santi.Kirtan At HomeThis is an easy way for attaining God-consciousness. At night all the members of the houseshould sit in a circle and do Kirtan for one hour before the picture of Lord Krishna. The servants ofthe house also should be included. Sing any Name of the Lord as Siva, Hare Ram, Sita Ram,Raghupati Raghava Rajaram, etc., in a chorus with one Svara, Tala harmoniously. Nada Brahmanwill be generated. You will forget the body and the world and enter into ecstatic state. Practise, tryand feel yourself. Mere tall talk will not do. Just as the intoxication that you get by taking a dose ofopium lasts for hours, the Divine intoxication that you get from Kirtan will last for some hoursduring the following day also. At night you will be free from bad dreams. During Kirtan a specialspiritual wave comes from the indweller of your heart and purifies the mind and Pranamaya Kosha.10YOGA IN DAILY LIFE"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"All diseases are cured thereby. Doctor’s bills are saved. Sattva flows from the Lord to your mind,just as oil flows from one vessel to another vessel. Kirtan gives you strength to face the difficultiesin the battle of life. Singing the Names of the Lord is a mental tonic.Evening Katha At HomeIn the evening four people can join together and read regularly the Bhagavad Gita, theRamayana or the Bhagavata. Svadhyaya or study of holy scriptures is Kriya Yoga. It is of immensebenefit for householders who do not find much time for serious spiritual practices and constantmeditation. The study itself is a form of meditation. When the mind is concentrated on Divinethoughts, it is filled with purity. The gross mind is rendered subtle.What Should Ladies DoI want to say a word on the devotional nature of Hindu ladies. In India, religion ismaintained by the ladies only. There is peculiar religious instinct in them. Hindu ladies are highlydevotional. They infuse the religious spirit in the males through their daily conduct and practicallife. They get up in the early morning, wash the house, take bath, do Japa, make a small temple intheir house and keep there pictures of the Lord and Pooja vessels, etc. They keep the place sacredand in the evening do Arati and prayer. The atheistic male members of the house are forced to dosome prayer or other through their influence, on account of fear. In reality the ladies of the housegovern the house. They are the manifestations of Sakti. The husband is not entitled to do anyreligious rite without her presence by his side.“Yatra naryastu pujyante ramante tatra devatah,Yatrai tastu na pujyante sarvastatraphalah kriyah”—Manu Smriti III-56.“Where women are honoured, there Devas are pleased; but where they are not honoured,there no sacred rite is fruitful.” Such is the glory of Hindu ladies. My earnest prayer is that theyshould sing the Name of the Lord in the early morning as soon as they get up. They should train theirchildren also to sing the Names. The whole house will be charged with spiritual vibrations. Evenwhen they cook and draw water from the wells, they should be singing in mild tone the Names ofthe Lord. A strong habit of repeating the Names of the Lord will be formed in two months. Thisitself is quite sufficient for attaining God-consciousness. Singing the Names of the Lord is a veryeasy method for getting Darshan of the Lord in this Kali-Yuga. Even when anyone dies, the habit ofsinging the Name of the Lord will come to his rescue.Duties Of WomanhoodFrom time immemorial Sita, Savitri, Damayanti, Nalayani, Anasuya and Draupadi havebeen regarded as sacred ideals of Indian Womanhood. They are sublime and exemplary characterswho have exalted womanhood to the height of divine perfection.11BHAKTI YOGA"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Modern women should draw inspiration from their lives and try to tread their path. As longas such characters continue to exercise their influence upon the lives and character of Indian ladies,so long they will be looked upon with admiration and reverence by their sisters of other countries.All of them were subjected to very severe tests in which their purity, courage, patience andother virtues were put to and nobly did they come out through those tests. Hindu women are, sincethe dawn of the early civilisation, distinguished for their disinterested love and self-abnegation.What a wife is to a Hindu husband is well illustrated by a verse in the Ramayana where SriRama referred to Sita says:Karyeshu Mantree, Karaneshu Dasee,Dharmeshu Patnee, Kshamaya Dharitree,Sneheshu Mata, Sayaneshu Rambha,Rangecha Sakhi, Lakshmana Sa Priya Me.“In counsel she is my counsellor, in action she is my servant, in religious performances sheis my partner, in tolerance she is like the earth, in affection she is like unto my mother, in bed she islike the celestial Rambha and in play she is my companion. Such indeed, O Lakshmana, is mybeloved...” This is the Hindu ideal of a wife.The eternal fidelity of a Hindu woman to her husband makes her an ideal of the feminineworld. It makes her sublime and lofty. This sublime virtue still runs deep in the heart of hearts ofevery Hindu woman of India superior to any of the other countries in national integrity and honour.The inspiring force of the home is woman. The home is the origin and the beginning ofevery form of social organisation. It is the nursery of the nation. It is the sweet place or centrewherein children are trained for future citizenship. The woman illumines the home through theglory of motherhood. Man is incapable of doing the domestic duties incident upon the rearing up ofthe children. Good habits, right conduct, formation of character are created in childrenspontaneously in a well-regulated home under the personal influence of the mother. The lovingkindness and the cultured gentleness of the mother help the children to unfold their native talentsand dormant capacities quickly. Children absorb ideas by suggestion and imitation. Early trainingand impressions are lasting formation of character can be done by efficiently by mothers at home.Therefore, home is the beautiful training ground for the building up of character in children underthe personal guidance of the mother.Women are the backbone or bedrock or the basis for sustaining religion and nationalstrength and prosperity. There is no difference between her and Lakshmi, the Goddess of Beauty,Grace and Prosperity. Manu says, “That woman who does always good, who is efficient in work,sweet in speech, devoted to her Dharmas and service to her husband, is really no human being but aGoddess.” If the mother trains her children on the right lines she is rendering a great service indeedto the nation and the national culture.Women have got ample opportunities to improve and increase the national health andprosperity. They really build the nation. They can utilise their talents and abilities in making the12YOGA IN DAILY LIFE"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"home the cradle of culture character, personal ability and religious upheaval. It is therefore wrongto say that their life is cramped or stunted by attending to the duties at home and that no scope isgiven for evolution and freedom. This is a sad mistake indeed! The life of a woman is as noble andserious as that of a man. There is no doubt of this.It is the women that keep up the life and happiness of the home through their smile, tenderaffection, sweet speech, charming personality, grace and angelic presence. The home will be a realvoid without them. It will lose its peculiar charm and beauty without their presence.It will be of great benefit to know what the Great Ones have said about the ideal of conductand deportment that a woman should try to live up to. Sri Rama instructs Kausalya, his mother, asfollows: “To a woman so long as she is alive, the husband is indeed the Lord and God. That woman,who, though noblest of all and given to the practice of vows and fasts, does not look after herhusband, will indeed obtain an unmeritorious future. Even if a woman has never bowed to the Godsand has ceased to worship them, she obtains the highest heaven by serving her husband. A womanshould be absorbed in the service of her husband, taking delight in his pleasure and his good. This isthe path of the Dharma, known for long ages, revealed in the Vedas, and remembered by the world.There is nothing more cruel for a woman than to desert her husband. To attend upon and to serveone’s husband is no doubt the highest duty of a woman. So long as a woman lives, her husband isher only master.”Then again there is Kanva Rishi’s advice to Sakuntala on the eve of her departure from hisAshram to King Dushyanta’s residence. Kanva Rishi says: “Sakuntala! Serve all your elders.Though your Lord is angry with you at times, do not go against his wishes. Do not be too muchattached in enjoyment. Treat your dependants and co-wives with motherly affection andtenderness. Be an affectionate companion to your sisters-in-law. Be obedient to yourmother-in-law. These attributes will make you the true mistress of the house. Otherwise, you willgive pain and trouble to the whole family.”It is the duty of the lady of the house to get up before her husband in the early hours of thedawn, take her bath and perform the household work. Tiruvalluvar’s wife shampooed the feet of herhusband, slept after her husband and rose up in the morning before he got up from bed. She isregarded as a model woman.To a lady the husband is indeed the highest ornament of all ornaments. Being separatedfrom him, she, however beautiful, does not shine.The Hindu scriptures say that the wife must be very obedient and that the husband is God toher. Some ignorant persons take advantage of this and exercise undue authority over their wives andkeep them under extreme subordination. Is this not a sad mistake? Woman is in no way inferior toman. The home is a co-operative organisation. It flourishes on the principle of division of labour.The husband should not think that he is superior to his wife, simply because he is the earningmember of the family. Women have a definite field of their own. They are mothers of the house.The extraordinary abilities and intellectual attainments, and the magnetic personality of the modernwomen are a standing monument to their undoubted equality with men. The personal influence ofwomen at home is essential to unify the various interests of the family. It is women alone who can13BHAKTI YOGA"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"rear and nurse children. Hindu wives are queens in their own homes. The husbands should treattheir wives with intense love and respect. They should be regarded as equals in all respects and beheld in the light of partners in life. Manu says, “The householder should first serve his relatives anddependants with food and then take the remaining foodalong with his wife,” hinting thereby at theposition of equal footing on which she is to be treated. If a man earns and the wife stays at home, itdoes not mean that the woman is a parasite and a slave. She is indeed the builder of the nation.Verily, women exercise an authority over their husbands through their love, tenderness, affection,grace, beauty, selfless service and fidelity, purity and self-abnegation.In the west the woman is wife. In India the woman is the mother. Mother is worshipped.Mother is considered as the Goddess Lakshmi of the house. The Srutis emphatically declare, “Letthy mother be thy God.” The late Ashutosh Mukherji, Vice-Chancellor of the Calcutta Universityused to wash the feet of his mother and drink the water before he went to his office. This water iscalled ‘Charanamrit’. It is a great purifier of the heart. In the West the wife governs the home. In anIndian home the mother rules. In the West the mother has to be subordinate to the wife. In India thewife has to be subordinate to the mother.If woman be pure she can save and purify man. Woman can purify the race. Woman canmake a home a sacred temple. The Hindu women have been the custodians of the Hindu race. TheHindu religion, the Hindu culture and civilisation still survive in spite of the many foreigninvasions, when other civilisations have come and gone, on account of the purity of the Hinduwomen. The women are taught to regard chastity as their most priceless possession, and the loss ofit as equal to the eternal damnation of their souls. Religion is ingrained in the Hindu women fromtheir very childhood. Hindu women illumine and enliven the house through the glory of their purity.This is the secret of the endurance of the Hindu religion, civilisation and culture.Advice To HouseholdersStart that pure life of a Yogi the very day on which you read these lines. No leniency tomind. Self-reliance is indispensably requisite. You can get suggestions from outside. But you willhave to tread the path yourself, to place each step yourself in the spiritual ladder.You will have to train your wife also. She also will have to do rigid Sadhana. Meregossiping will not do. If she serves the husband nicely and takes care of his body with the rightmental attitude and gives him the wants of the flesh, food and drinks as soon as he comes down frommeditation, she can have Self-realisation in and through the form of her husband alone, like Laila inMajnu, Savitri in Satyavan, Anasuya in Atri.That house is a miserable place, veritable hell on earth wherein the husband moves up inspirituality and the wife pulls him down in sensual grooves and vice versa. They should beharmoniously blended or joined by the thread of the knowledge of the Self, each aspiring eagerlyfor attaining God-consciousness. That house is really a Vaikuntha where the husband and wife leadan ideal Divine Life, singing Hari’s Name, repeating His Mantra 200 Malas daily, studying theRamayana and the Bhagavata, controlling the Indriyas and serving Bhaktas and Sannyasins.14YOGA IN DAILY LIFE"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Renunciation is mental.

Give your whole heart, mind and soul when youserve. This is very important when you practise Karma Yoga.Some people have their body in one place, mind in another place, and soul in another place.This is the reason why they do not realise any substantial progress in the path.Forget not the goal of life amidst selfish activities. The goal of life is Self-realisation. Areyou attempting to reach the end and aim of life? Are you doing Japa, Pranayama and Meditation?Have you kept up the ideal before the mind’s eye? That day in which you do not practise anyspiritual Sadhana is wasted. Give the mind to God and the hand to work. You will have to analyseand scrutinise your motives. It is the selfish motive and not the work itself that binds a man toSamsara. Prepare the mind for Karma Yoga. Mere selfish work cannot be taken as Yogic activity.The mind is so framed that it always expects something for a small piece of work. When you smileyou expect a return of smile from your friend. When you raise your hand in salutation, you expect asalute from other people. Even when you give a cup of water to another man, you expect him to begrateful to you. When such is the case how can you perform Nishkama Karma Yoga?Life is very precious. Live in the spirit of the Gita’s teaching and work without expectationof fruits and egoism. Think you are Nimitta in the hands of Lord Narayana. If you work with thismental attitude you will become a Yogi soon. Work never degrades a man. Unselfish work is Pujaof Narayana. Work is worship. All works are sacred. There is no menial work from the highest viewpoint, from the view point of the absolute, from the view point of Karma Yoga. Even scavengingwhen done with the right spirit and mental attitude is Yogic action. Even a scavenger can realiseGod in his own station of life by service. The famous butcher Dharma Vyadha of Mahabharatarealised God in his meat shop (through serving his parents). You all have got inside all materials forwisdom. There is a vast magazine of power and knowledge within you. It wants kindling. Nowwake up, Oh Saumya!When you work disinterestedly without any agency and when you surrender the works andfruits as Ishvararpana, all Karmas are transformed into Yogic Kriyas. Walking, eating, sleeping,answering the calls of nature, talking, etc., become offering unto the Lord. Every bit of work isYoga for you. Think that Lord Siva is working through your hands, and is eating through yourmouth. Think that your hands are the hands of Lord Siva. In the beginning some of your actions maybe selfish and some may be unselfish. In the long run you can do all actions in an unselfish manner.Scrutinise your motives always. This is the keynote for Nishkamya Karma Yoga. Every act can bespiritualised when the motive becomes pure. Work is meditation. Serve everyone with intense lovewithout any idea of agency without expectation of fruits or reward. If you adopt the path of Jnana,feel you are a silent Sakshi and the Prakriti does everything.It is selfishness that has deplorably contracted your heart.

A portionof the mind will be at work; three quarters of the mind will be in the service of the Lord, inmeditation, in Japa. Karma Yoga is generally combined with Bhakti Yoga. A Karma Yogin offersto the Lord as an oblation whatever he does through the Karma Indriyas. This is Ishvara Pranidhana.Training For Karma YogaA raw untrained aspirant feels, “My preceptor is treating me like a servant or a peon. He isusing me for petty jobs.” He who has understood the right significance of Karma Yoga will takeevery work as Yogic activity or worship of the Lord. There is no menial work in his vision. Everywork is Puja of Narayana. In the light of Karma Yoga all actions are sacred. That aspirant whoalways takes immense delight in doing works which are considered by the worldly man as menialservices, and who always does willingly such acts only will become a dynamic Yogi. He will beabsolutely free from conceit and egoism. He will have no downfall. The canker of pride cannottouch him.Study the autobiography of Mahatma Gandhiji. He never makes any difference betweenmenial service and dignified work. Scavenging and cleaning of the latrine is the highest Yoga forhim. This is the highest Puja for him. He himself has done cleaning of latrines. He has annihilatedthis illusory little ‘I’ through service of various sorts. Many highly educated persons joined hisAshram for learning Yoga under him. They thought that Gandhiji would teach them Yoga in somemysterious manner in a private room and would give lessons on Pranayama, meditation,abstraction, awakening Kundalini, etc. They were disappointed when they were asked to clean thelatrine at first. They left the Ashram immediately. Gandhiji himself does repairing of his shoes. Hehimself used to grind flour and take upon his shoulders the work of others also when they wereunable to do their allotted portion of work for the day in the Ashram. When an educated person, anew Ashramite, felt shy to do grinding work, Gandhiji himself would do his work in front of himand then the man would do the work himself from the next day willingly.In the West cobblers and peasants have risen to a very great position in society. Every workis a respectable work for them. A boy applies polish to the boots in the streets of London for apenny, carries newspapers and journals in the afternoon for sale and works as an apprentice under ajournalist during his leisure hours at night. He studies books, works hard, never wastes a minute andin a few years becomes a journalist of great repute and international fame. In Punjab some graduateshave taken to hair-dressing work. They have understood the dignity of labour.17KARMA YOGA"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"A real Yogi does not make any difference between menial and respectable work. It is onlyan ignorant man who makes such a difference. Some aspirants are humble in the beginning of theirspiritual career. When they get some name and fame, some followers, admirers, devotees anddisciples, they become victims to pride.They cannot do any service. They cannot carry anything on their heads or hands. That Yogiwho carries the trunk on his head without the slightest feeling in the railway platform amidst amultitude of his admirers, disciples and devotees, without making any outward show of humilitymust be adored. Sage Jada Bharata carried the palanquin of King Rahugana on his shoulderswithout murmuring. Lord Krishna shampooed the legs of a Raja when his barber devotee was onleave. Sri Rama carried a pot of water for the ablution of one of his devotees. Sri Krishna took theform of a menial servant as Vithoo and paid the money to the Nawab on behalf of his devotee,Dhamaji. If you really want to grow in the spiritual path you must do all sorts of service daily till theend of life. Then only you are safe. Do not stop doing service when you have become a famousYogi. The spirit of service must enter every nerve, cell, tissue and bone of your body. It must beingrained in you. Then only you will become a real, full-blown practical Vedantin.Is there any greater Vedantin or Karma Yogin than Lord Buddha? He still lives in our hearts,because the spirit of service was ingrained in him and he spent his whole life in serving others invarious ways. You can also become a Buddha if you apply yourself diligently to selfless servicewith the right mental attitude.Attain Nirlipta StateLord Krishna says in His Gita:“Tasmat sarveshu kaleshu mam anusmarayudhyacha—Therefore, at all times think of Me and fight.” Give the mind to God and the hand towork. The typist works at the machine and talks with his friends. The player on the harmoniumplays on the organ and talks and jokes with his friends; the lady knits and talks with her comrades.The mind of the girl who has a water pot on her head is on the water pot, though she is talking andjoking with her companions while she is walking on the road. A nurse while she is nursing the babyof another lady has her mind rivetted on her own baby. A cowherd while he is looking after the cowsof other people has his mind fixed on his own cow. Even so, have your mind fixed at the lotus feet ofthe Lord, while you are doing your household duties and office work. You will realiseSelf-consciousness quickly. Just as the water remains unaffected in the lotus leaf, just as the oilfloats upon the surface of the water without being affected in any way, so also you should remain inthe world amidst pleasures and difficulties.Just as the tongue is not affected by taking ghee, so also you should remain unaffected evenamidst worldly activities and troubles. You must keep up the Nirlipta state. This is Jnana. This isbalance (Samata). You may fail to keep the balance and Nirlipta state a thousand and one times. Butin the long run you are bound to succeed if you persist in your practice and if you discipline the mindproperly. Every failure is a pillar for future success. Remember this point well.A Karma Yogin should not expect even return of love, appreciation, gratitude, admirationfrom the people whom he is serving.18YOGA IN DAILY LIFE"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Only he who has reduced his wants and controlled the Indriyas can do Karma Yoga.

You must be free from Raga and Dvesha. “An action which is ordained, done by oneundesirous of fruit, devoid of attachment, without love or hate, that is called pure.” (Gita XVIII-23)What Is KarmaKarma means work or action. According to Jaimini, rituals like Agnihotra, Yajnas, etc., aretermed Karmas. There is a hidden power in Karma termed Adrishta which brings in fruits ofKarmas for the individual. Karma is all for Jaimini. Karma is everything for a student of Mimamsicschool of thought. Jaimini is the founder of Purva Mimamsa. He was student of Maharishi Vyasa,the founder of Uttara Mimamsa or Vedanta. The Mimamsa school deny the existence of Ishvarawho awards the fruits of works.According to the Gita, any action is Karma. Charity, sacrifice, Tapas are all Karmas. In aphilosophical sense, breathing, seeing, hearing, tasting, feeling, smelling, walking, talking, etc., areall Karma. Thinking is the real Karma. Raga-Dvesha constitute the real Karma.How To Find Right Or Wrong ActionHave right thinking. Use your reason and commonsense. Follow the injunctions of theSashtras. Consult the code of Manu or Yajnavalkya Smriti whenever you have doubts. You will beable to find out whether you are doing right or wrong action. If you say, “Sastras are countless. Theyare like the ocean. I can hardly understand the truths that are inculcated. I cannot fathom and gaugetheir depths. There are contradictions. I am puzzled and bewildered.” Then strictly follow the wordsof a Guru on whom you have absolute faith and confidence. The third way is: Have fear in God.Consult your conscience. The shrill, inner voice will guide you. As soon as you hear the voice, donot delay even a moment. Start the action diligently without consulting anybody. Practise to hearthe inner voice in the morning at 4 a.m. If there is fear, shame, or pricking of conscience, know thatyou are doing a wrong action. If there is joy, exhilaration or satisfaction understand that you aredoing right action.Inner VoiceWhen the diverse, confining sheaths of Atman have been dissolved by Sadhana, when thedifferent Vrittis of the mind have been controlled by mental drill or gymnastics, when the consciousmind is not active, you enter the realm of spirit life, the superconscious mind where Buddhi andpure reason and intuition, the faculty of direct cognition of Truth manifest. You pass into thekingdom of peace where there is none to speak, you will hear the voice of God which is very clearand pure and has an upward tendency. Listen to the voice with attention and interest. It will guideyou. It is the voice of God.19KARMA YOGA"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Prayer For A Karma-Yogin(By Sri Sankaracharya)Atma tvam girija matih sahachara pranah sareeram grihamPuja te vishayopa bhoga rachana nidra samadhi sthitihSancharah padayoh pradakshina vidhih stotrani sarvagiro;Yadyat karma karomi tat tat akhilam Shambho tavaradhanam.Repeat the Sloka at the end of your meditation.“Thou art Atma; Buddhi is Thy consort, Parvathi (who is born of mountain); the Pranas areThy attendants; this body is Thy house; the action of sensual enjoyment is Thy worship; deep sleepis the establishment of Samadhi; walking by my feet is the perambulation around Thee; all myspeeches are Thy praise; whatever actions I perform, are all Thy worship; Oh Shambhu!”Section IVRAJA YOGAMind is mysterious something which is really nothing but does everything.It is born of Maya.

Will is the General-in-chief which directs the mindand Prana to all parts and in all directions. Intuition is above reason and is the channel ofcommunication between man and spirit. Development of the Will-Power by Auto-suggestion is thebasic principle of Raja Yoga or Vedanta. Superconscious Mind is the realm or Spirit of Life.20YOGA IN DAILY LIFE"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Metaphysics Of The Inner ManThe physical body, the astral body, Prana, intellect or Buddhi, the instinctive mind, thespiritual mind and the spirit are the seven principles of man. Buddhi is pure reason. The seat ofBuddhi is just below the crown of the head in the Pineal Gland of the brain. Buddhi is manifestedonly in those persons who have developed right intuitive discrimination or Viveka. The ordinaryreason of the worldly people is termed practical reason, which is dense and has limitations.Prana is the vital force, life-energy or Jiva Sakti. It is the eternal symbol of God. It is the linkHiranyagarbha or Golden son of God. It is the link between the astral and physical body. Prana isdivided into physical Prana and psychic Prana. Breathing is external manifestation of physicalPrana. All thoughts are due to the vibration of psychic Prana in the Chitta.The causal body or Karana Sarira is the support for the astral and physical bodies. Will isPara Sakti. Get this Sakti—you will get Sat or Existence.Chitta is the sub-conscious mind. It has two layers. One layer for emotion and the other forpassive memory. The instinctive mind is the lower nature of human beings. It is the desire-mind orKama Manas. The spiritual mind is the higher Manas. The seat of the mind is the heart. The mindconnected to the Somachakra of the lowermost portion or under-surface of the brain is termed theorgan of understanding. By Manonasa or annihilation of the mind is meant the destruction ordissolution of the lower nature, desire-mind. Sankhya Buddhi or Buddhi in the light of Sankhyaphilosophy is will and intellect combined. Mind is microcosm. Mind is Maya. Mind occupies anintermediate state between Prakriti and Purusha, matter and Spirit.Tame The Six Wild BeastsYou have a whole menagerie within, with the lion, the tiger, the serpent, the elephant, theape, and the peacock. Bring them to subjection. The beauty of the flesh is really due to the lifegiving principle Prana. The beauty is attributable to the light that emanates from Atman. The nastybody with oozing discharges from nine gutters is composed of five elements, is a Jada Vasthu andApavitra. Always entertain this idea. Have a clear-cut, well-defined image-picture like this. Youwill conquer lust by such a mental drill. If you understand the doctrine ofunity in variety,ifyouknow there is only one matter, one Energy, one Mind-substance, one Life, one Existence, Sat, oneReality, and if you entertain always such a thought, you can control Krodha. If you remember thatyou are only an instrument in the hands of God, that God is everything; God does everything; God isjust; then you can get rid of Ahamkara. You can annihilate Dvesha by Pratipaksha Bhavana. Lookto the brighter side of persons. Ignore the dark aspect.Emotion is a motive power like the steam of an engine. It helps you in your evolution. Had itnot been for the presence of emotion, you would have passed into a state of passivity or inertia. Itgives a push for action or motion. It is a blessing. But you must not become a prey to emotion. Youmust not allow the emotions to rule you. You must not allow them to bubble out. You must purifyand calm the surging emotions. You must allow it to rise slowly and subside quietly from themind-ocean. You must keep the emotion under perfect control. Do not mistake physical sensationsfor higher sublime emotions. Do not be carried away by emotions. There are certain people who21RAJA YOGA"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"like to hear some new sensational events just to arouse their emotions. They live on emotionsotherwise, they feel quite dull. This is a great weakness. This must be eradicated if they like to havea calm, quiet life.All evil qualities proceed from anger. If you control anger, all evil qualities will vanish bythemselves. Ahamkara, Sankalpa, Vasana, Prana have intimate connection with the mind. Therecannot be any mind without these four. Prana is the life of the mind. Ahamkara is the root of themind. Sankalpas are the branches of the tree, mind. Vasana is the seed of mind. This deep rootedtree of Samsara of dire Ajnana which ramifies in various directions with branches full of flowers,tendrils, etc., has the mind as its root. If this root-mind is destroyed, tree of Samsara, this tree ofbirth and death will also be destroyed. Cut this root-mind with the axe of Brahma Jnana. Chop offthe branches—the Sankalpas, with the knife of Vichara-Viveka.The ever-restless mind becomes quiescent when all desires vanish. Desire raises Sankalpas(thoughts). Man performs actions for acquiring the desired objects. Thus he is caught up in thewheel of Samsara. The wheel stops when the Vasanas perish.Just as there are doors in a bungalow between the outer and inner rooms, so also there aredoors between the lower and higher mind. When the mind is purified by the practice of KarmaYoga, Tapas, right conduct or the practice of Yama, Niyama, Japa, meditation, etc., the doorsbetween the lower and the higher mind are opened. Discrimination between the real and the unrealdawns. The eye of intuition is opened. The practitioner gets inspiration, revelation and higherDivine knowledge.It is extremely difficult to have a calm and pure mind. But you must have such a mind, if youwant to have progress in meditation, if you desire to do Nishkamya Karma Yoga. Then only youwill have a perfect instrument, a well controlled mind at your disposal. This is one of the mostimportant qualifications for the aspirant. You will have to struggle hard for a long time withpatience and perseverance. Nothing is impossible for a Sadhaka who has iron will and strongdetermination.Just as soap cleanses the physical body so also Japa of a Mantra, Dhyana, Kirtan andpractice of Yama cleanses the mind of its impurities.ChittaThe subconscious mind is termed “Chitta” in Vedanta. Much of your subconscious consistsof submerged experiences memories thrown into the background but recoverable.When you show symptoms of losing your memory, as you grow old, the first symptom isthat you find it difficult to remember the names of persons. The reason is not far to seek. All thenames are arbitrary. They are like labels. There are no associations along with the names. The mindgenerally remembers through associations, as the impressions become deep thereby. You canremember in old age some passages that you have read in schools and colleges. But you find itdifficult to remember in the evening a passage you have read in the morning. The reason is that themind has lost its Dharana Sakti (power of grasping ideas.) The cells have degenerated. Those who22YOGA IN DAILY LIFE"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"over work, mentally, who do not observe the rules of Brahmacharya and who are afflicted withmuch cares, worries and anxieties, lose their power of memory soon. Even in old age you canremember old events as there are associations with events.The mental processes are limited to the field or consciousness alone. The field ofsubconscious mentation is of a much greater extent than that of conscious mentation. Messageswhen ready, come out like a flash from the subconscious mind or Chitta of the Vedantins. Only tenper cent of mental activities come into the field of consciousness. At least ninety per cent of ourmental life is subconsciousness. We sit and try to solve a problem, and fail. We look around, tryagain and again but fail. Suddenly an idea dawns and leads to the solution of the problem. Thesubconscious process was at work.Sometimes you go to sleep at night with the thought “I must get up very early in the morningto catch a train.” This message is taken up by the subconscious mind and it is this subconsciousmind that wakes you up unfailingly at the exact hour. Subconscious mind is your constantcompanion and sincere friend. You repeatedly fail at night to get a solution for a problem inArithmetic or Geometry. In the morning when you wake up you get clear answer. This answercomes like a flash from the subconscious mind. Even in sleep it works without any rest incessantly.It arranges, classifies, sorts all facts and works out a proper satisfactory solution. This is all due tosubconscious mind.With the help of the subconscious mind you can change your vicious nature by cultivatinghealthy, virtuous qualities that are opposed to the undesirable ones. If you want to overcome fearmentally deny that you have fear and concentrate your attention upon the opposite quality, the idealof courage. When this is developed fear vanishes away by itself. The positive always overpowersthe negative. This is an infallible law of nature. This is Pratipaksha Bhavana of the Raja Yogins.You can acquire a liking for distasteful tasks and duties by cultivating a desire and taste for them.You can establish new habits, new ideals, new ideas and new tastes and new character in thesubconscious mind by changing the old ones.The functions of Chitta are Smritti or Smarana, Dharana (attention) and Anusandhana(inquiry or investigation). When you repeat a Mantra it is the Chitta that does the Smarana. It does alot of work. It turns out better work than the mind or Buddhi.All actions, enjoyments and experiences leave their impressions in the subconscious mindin the form of subtle impressions or residual potencies. The Samskaras are the roots of causingagain Jati, life and experiences of pleasure and pain. Revival of Samskaras induces memory. TheYogi dives deep inside and comes in direct contact with these Samskaras. He directly perceivesthem through the inner Yogic Vision. By Samyama (concentration, meditation and Samadhi) onthese Samskaras, he acquires knowledge of previous lives. By doing Samyama on the Samskaras ofothers, the Yogi gets the knowledge of their past lives also.When you desire to remember a thing you will have to make a psychic exertion. You willhave to go up and down the depths of the different levels of the subconscious mind and then pick upthe right thing from a curious mixture of multifarious irrelevant matter. Just as the mail sorter in theRailway Mail Service takes up the right letter by moving the hand up and down along the different23RAJA YOGA"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"pigeon-holes, so also the sorter in the subconscious mind goes up and down along the pigeon-holesin the subconscious mind and brings the right thing to the level of normal consciousness. Thesubconscious mind can pick the right thing out from a heap of various matters.A Samskara of an experience is formed or developed in the Chitta the very moment whenthe mind is experiencing something. There is no gap between the present experience and theformation of a Samskara in the subconscious mind.Smrithi or memory is the function of Chitta (subconscious mind). It is a separate faculty orcategory in Vedanta. Sometimes it is Antarangata (comes under the mind). In Sankhya philosophyit is included in Buddhi or Mahat Tattva. The Chitta of Patanjali Rishi’s philosophy of Raja Yoga(Yogaschitta Vritti Nirodha) corresponds to the Antahkarana of Vedanta.Mind And Its MysteriesJust as a busy officer works alone in a room by closing all the doors, so also the busy mindworks alone in a dream by shutting out all the doors of the senses.Mind is a power born of the soul. It is through mind that the Lord manifests Himself as thedifferentiated universe with heterogeneous objects.Mind is merely a bundle of thoughts. Of all thoughts the thought ‘I’ is the root. Therefore,mind is only the thought ‘I’.Mind is nothing but a collection of Samskaras or impressions. It is nothing but a bundle ofhabits. It is nothing but a collection of desires arising from contact with different objects. It is also acollection of feelings aroused by worldly botherations. It is collection of ideas gathered fromdifferent objects. Now these desires, ideas and feelings constantly change. Some of the old desiresare constantly departing from their storehouse of the mind, and new ones are replacing them.In the waking state, the seat of the mind is the brain; in the dreaming state the seat of themind is the cerebellum; in the deep sleep state it rests in the heart.Mind always attaches itself to something objective. It cannot stand by itself. It is only themind that asserts itself as ‘I’ in this body.The things that we perceive all round us are only mind in form or substance. ‘ManomatramJagat—Manah Kalpitam Jagat.’ Mind creates. Mind destroys.The occult phenomena that take place in the mental world are all based on scientific laws.Occultists and Raja Yogins should have a comprehensive, intelligent understanding of these laws.Then only will they be able to control the psychic forces easily.Practice of telepathy, thought-reading, hypnotism, mesmerism, distant healing, psychichealing, etc., clearly prove that mind exists and that a higher developed mind can influence andsubjugate the lower minds. From the automatic writing and the experiences of a hypnotised person,24YOGA IN DAILY LIFE"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"we can clearly infer the existence of subconscious mind which operates throughout the twenty-fourhours.If an idea is planted in the mind, it grows at night through the operation of the subconsciousmind. The subconscious mind never takes any rest. It works vigorously throughout the twenty-fourhours. Those who know how to manipulate this subconscious mind can turn out tremendous mentalwork. All geniuses have control over the subconscious mind. You must understand the ways ofextracting work from the subconscious mind. Subconscious mind is a wonderful undergroundmental factory.Mind is the greatest force on this earth. He who has controlled his mind is full of powers. Hecan bring all minds under his influence. All diseases can be cured by psychic healing. One is struckwith awe and wonder at the marvellous and mysterious powers of the mind of a man. The source orhome or support of this mysterious mind is God or Atman.Any action that is done by the physical body is the outcome of a preconceived idea. Themind thinks, plans and schemes at first. Then the action manifests itself. He who invented a watch atfirst had all ideas in his mind about the construction of the lever, various wheels, dial, minute-hand,second-hand, hour-hand, etc. These ideas materialised later on into action.A spark of light presents the appearance of a continuous circle of light if it is made to rotatequickly. Even so, though the mind can attend but to one thing at a time, either hearing or smelling,though it can admit of but one kind of sensation at a time, we are led to believe that it does severalactions at a time, because it moves from one object to another with tremendous velocity, so rapidlythat its successive attention and perception appear as a simultaneous activity.The best philosophers and seers (Rishis and sages) are unanimously agreed that the mindcannot actually attend to more than one thing at a time, but it appears to be doing so only when it isshifting with prodigious rapidity backward and forward from one end to the other.Change of thought, relaxation of mind by dwelling on thoughts of pleasant objects,cheerfulness, Sattvic food, mental recreation of Sattvic nature are necessary for mental health.The mind assumes the shape of any object it intently thinks of. If it thinks of an orange, itassumes the shape of an orange. If it thinks of Lord Jesus on the Cross it assumes the shape of LordJesus on the Cross. You must train the mind properly and give it proper, pure food for assimilation.Have a Divine background of thought or mental image.If all the thoughts are eliminated, then there remains nothing which can be called mind. Sothoughts are the mind. Again there is no such thing as world, independent of and apart fromthoughts. Two thoughts, however closely related to one another, cannot exist at the same time.The mind becomes that on which it dwells. This is an immutable psychological law. If youbegin to think about the Dosha or defects of a man, for the time being, at least your mind dwells onthe bad qualities and becomes charged with these qualities, whether the man possesses these badqualities or not. This may be your vain imagination only through your wrong thinking, wrong25RAJA YOGA"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Samskaras or wrong (bad) habits of the mind.

Do not bark like awild dog about the bad qualities of others. Glorify others. You will grow spiritually. You will beliked, honoured and respected by others.Sleep (Sushupti) is not merely a state of inactivity or passive repose. It has deepphilosophical significance. Vedantins study this state very deeply and carefully. It gives the clue fornon-dual philosophers to trace, search and find out the hidden, silent witness.Atman who is ever awake, although all the minds are at rest. Mother of this world,Rajeshvari takes the Jivas back to Her and Her Lord during deep sleep, hugs them to Her bosom,bestows on them refreshing peace, new vigour, vitality and strength and makes them quite fit for theensuing battle of life on the following day. But for this sleep, life would have been absolutelyimpossible in this physical plane when misery, diseases, cares, worries, fears and anxieties ofvarious kinds trouble man every second. If a man does not get sound sleep even for one night, if heloses his sleep one night for three hours by keeping watch over a sick patient or attending thecinema, how miserable, gloomy, depressed he feels the next day!Mind is atomic according to the Indian school of logic. It is all-pervading according to RajaYoga school of Patanjali Maharshi; is of the middling size (same size as that of the body) accordingto the Vedantic school.Mind is material. Mind is made up of subtle matter. This discrimination is made on theprinciple that the soul is the only source of intelligence; it is self-evident; it shines by its own light.Mind is formed out of the subtlest portion of the food.Mind can be compared to water. Water exists in four states, viz., causal state in the form ofH2O, subtle state in the form of water, gross state in the form of ice and gaseous state in the form ofvaporised steam. Even so the mind is in a gross state during Jagrat state when it enjoys sensualobjects, is in a subtle state when it functions in the dream state, is in a causal state when it getsinvolved into its cause, Mula-Avidya during deep sleep and it evaporates as gas when it melts ordissolves in Brahman during Nirvikalpa Samadhi.Just as the physical body is composed of solid, liquid and gaseous matter, so also the mind ismade up of subtle matter of various grades of density with different rates of vibration. A Raja Yogipenetrates through the layers of the mind by intense practice.Just as you nourish the physical body with food, so also you will have to give food for themind and spiritual food for the soul.26YOGA IN DAILY LIFE"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"When your business fails, or when you are in heavy grief by the death of your own son, youget emaciation of body even though you eat nourishing, substantial food.

She is always happy. Her heart is full of joy. The joy and cheerfulnessare powerful tonics for her mind. She gets inner mental strength although she does not take anyfood.Control Of MindLife in this physical plane is a mere preparation for the eternal life of everlasting sunshineand joy which is to come when one gets the knowledge of the Self through intense and constantmeditation after purifying the mind.

The mind itself takes the forms of rose, mountain, elephant, river, ocean,enemy, etc. Just as heat is inseparable from fire, so also fluctuation is inseparable from mind. Itmakes the mind restless. This fluctuation is caused by the power of Rajas. It is the fluctuation thatcauses Asanthi (absence of peace of mind). The Bhaktas remove this tossing by Japa, Upasana andworship of Ishta-devata.The power of fluctuation is itself the mind. This fluctuating mind alone is this world. Themind becomes no mind if fluctuation disappears. The mind ceases to exist, if it becomes destitute ofthis fluctuation. What is called Maya is this fluctuating potency of the mind. Mind does havocsthrough the power of fluctuation. Fluctuation is Mara or Satan or Vasana or Ishana or Trishna. Itwas this fluctuation that tempted Visvamitra. It is this fluctuation that brings about the downfall of astruggling aspirant. Destroy this fluctuation through strong Viveka, constant meditation andceaseless Brahma Vichara.As soon as fluctuation manifests itself various sorts of imaginations crop up. Imaginationco-exists with fluctuation. Imagination is as much dangerous as fluctuation. Fluctuation moves themind. Imagination fattens the mind. Mind, minus fluctuation and imagination is a mere zero.Fluctuation and imagination are the two wings of the mind bird. Cut the right wing through Atmicenquiry and the left wing through the practice of thoughtlessness. The great bird—mind—will falldead on the spot immediately.The one dividing wall between the soul and body is mind. If this wall is broken by ceaselessAtmic enquiry, then the Jiva mixes with the Supreme Soul just as the river mixes with the ocean.27RAJA YOGA"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Close your eyes.

You are an expression of the sameone life, one Existence, one Sat, one Reality. You are the real “I”, the real Atman. You areimmortal. You can hardly be destroyed. You are invincible. You can by no means be injured. Beliefin this sense-world alone is death. Your real nature is Satchidananda, immortality and bliss. TheSeer of Self sees not death nor disease nor sorrow. The Seer sees all as his own Self. He pervades all.He knows everything. He is all-powerful.What Is Atman?Atman or Brahman is Existence Absolute, Knowledge Absolute, Bliss Absolute. It isdifferent from the gross, subtle and causal bodies. It transcends the five sheaths (Pancha Koshas). Itis the witness of the three states: waking, dreaming and deep sleep. It is the support of thetwenty-four Tattvas. It is distinct from Jiva and Ishvara who are associated with Avidya and Mayarespectively.The Self appears to be finite on account of Avidya. But when the ignorance is dispelled, thatone Atman shines by its own light, like the sun when clouds are dispelled. This Samsara which isfilled with love, hatred, etc., is really like a dream. It appears to be all real, so long as one is involvedin it, but when one awakes by acquiring true knowledge, it becomes unreal.

Passion, desires, happiness, misery, etc., exercise their functions only during waking anddreaming states when the intellect is present and are not present in the deep sleep, when intellect isabsent. They, therefore, belong to the intellect and not to the Pure Nirvikara Atman. Egoism and theidea “I know” crop up by indiscriminately mixing up the Satchidananda aspect of Atman with thefunctions of Buddhi.Vedantic SadhanaA beginner in Vedanta should study Atma-Bodha, Tattva-Bodha, Laghu Vasudeva-Mananaand Vivekachudamani.

Good and evil are twinforces. They are twin born of the same father. They are “Dvandvas” or pairs of opposites. They haveno independent existence. Evil exists to glorify good. Evil is destructive force. Good is constructiveforce. There is neither absolute good nor absolute evil in this universe. Evil has no independentexistence apart from good. Wherever there is evil, there is good; wherever there is good, there isevil. You cannot expect absolute good in this relative world. You can find absolute good inBrahman alone. From the viewpoint of the basic Reality which lies at the back of evil and good, eviland good dwindle into an airy nothing. Evil and good are mental creations. Transcend good and eviland reach the abode of Supreme Peace and Immortality. For a Jnani who has knowledge of the Self,there is neither good nor evil. The ‘Why’ of the evil can only be understood when you getAtma-Jnana. Do not rack your brain now. It is a transcendental mystery. Only Brahman knows.Finite intellect that is conditioned in time, space and causation cannot find out a solution for thisproblem of evil. When you are fully established in your Svarupa (Atma Nishta) evil and goodvanish altogether. Do not put the cart before the horse. Transmute evil into good by changing yourmental attitude or angle of vision. Out of evil, good often cometh. Destruction is necessary forregeneration, renovation and reconstruction. Will a patient with intense type of appendicular colictry to find out the ingredients of a pill, when the doctor gives him a medicine? Will he not take thepill immediately? Will a man whose cloth is on fire try to find out the “why” and “how” of the fire?Will he not run towards water for cooling himself?Tamas is evil. Sattva is good. Convert Tamas into Sattva. Then evil is transmuted into good.Selfishness is evil. Selflessness is good. Lust is an evil. Brahmacharya is good. Greed is evil.Generosity, integrity, disinterestedness are good. Pride is evil. Humility is good.Out of evil good often cometh. If there is a heavy torrent of rain at the time of a harvest,people consider this as evil. But God knows what is good for His children. He has brought this rainto wash off the earth the germs, which produce severe diseases. Had it not been for this rain, therewould have been a severe type of pandemic, infectious diseases which could have swept away thewhole population in the twinkling of an eye. Mark here. O friends, the merciful nature of the Lord!Do not try to probe into the Divine mysteries. It will baffle your poor intellect.Then again, what about a war? It is no doubt an evil. But good often cometh out of war. Awar cannot break out without the sanction of the Lord. It is He, who goads the minds of the Minister,the King, the Dictator, the President and the Commander-in-chief to wage war. It is war thatproduces chivalrous warriors, fearless soldiers, undaunted and intrepid statesmen. War makes aman fearless. Fearlessness is a great qualification for a spiritual aspirant. On account of passion,there is an increase in the population. The supply of foodstuff is not sufficient to meet the demandsof the people. War removes the extra population and prevents the outbreak of a severe famine. Warbrings down to dust the pride of a ruling power. War creates mercy, generosity and cosmic love, inthe hearts of rich persons who are misers; and forces them to donate to the helpless widows, orphansand the wounded persons. The world or society must evolve through evil. Understand Hismysterious ways and become wise.34YOGA IN DAILY LIFE"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Unity And DiversityThough you see variegated forms with different shades of colours, yet there is a definiteunity behind them.

For a psychologistthe world is all mind only. For a Vijnanavadin it is a mere idea. For a Vedantin this world is nothingbut Brahman or Atman.All objects are the products of the five elements. The five elements are reducible to oneelement, Akasa. Earth is gross form of water. Earth gets dissolved or involved in water. Water isgross form of fire. Water gets involved in fire. Water comes out of fire. When you feel intense heat,you get profuse perspiration. Fire is gross form of Vayu. There is heat when there is motion ofVayu. Fire gets involved in Air. Vayu is gross form of Akasa. Vayu is reduced into the Akasa. Thiswhole world is projected out of one element Akasa only.Then again all energies such as electricity, magnetism, etc., can be reduced to oneenergy—Prana.

Trataka also playsa very prominent part in Raja Yoga and Jnana Yoga. Trataka is focussing of one’s own energytowards an object or thing or an idea and observing every detail and dissecting, analysing,consciously and subconsciously drawing to itself every possible bit of information regarding it bothwithin and without. Trataka lies at the base of will-power. This is a preliminary Sadhana for a Yogicstudent. A Jnani concentrates his attention on an abstract thought—“Aham Brahma Asmi. I am allpurity. I am all power,” etc. It is really an up-hill work or a tremendous task for people of averageintelligence to concentrate on an abstract thought. To begin with, you will have to concentrate onconcrete object.Keep the picture of your Ishta Devata in front of you. I shall tell you now how to do Tratakaon Lord Vishnu.“Dhyeya sada savitri mandala madhyavarti, Narayana sarasijasana sannivishta;Keyuravan, Makara kundalavan, kirti harih hiranmaya vapuh; Dhrita sankha chakra gada panedvarakanilayachyuta.”Fix the mind first on the feet of Lord Vishnu, then on lotus under the legs. Take it round theyellow silken cloth the Pitambara, then to the golden Hara, the gem on the breast, then ear-ring, thenthe face, then the crown on the head, then the bracelets on the arm, then the disc in the right upperhand, then the conch in the left upper hand, then the Gada or mace in the left lower hand. This is theorder. Then come down to the feet and start again to the upper parts. Do like this again and again.Whenever the mind runs away, fix it again and again, just as Lord Krishna says in the Gita VI-25:“Yato yato nischarati manaschanchalamasthiramTatastato niyamyaitadatmanyeva vasam nayet.”43MIND AND MEDITATION"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"The conch represents OM or Sabdha Brahman.

Slowly increase the time. Have a steady uninterrupted gaze on the dot withoutclosing the eyes. You can also do Trataka after closing the two ears with your two thumbs, on theAnahat sound that rises from the Akasa of the heart. This will lead to actual Laya, in the long run.Then you can do Trataka on Lord Vishnu, Siva, Krishna or any other Murthy. Trataka practice givestremendous power and removes a host of opthalmic ailments (eye troubles) and bestows DivyaDrishti.Practice Of ConcentrationFix the mind on some object either inside or outside the body. Keep it steady there for sometime. This is concentration. You will have to practise this daily.Purify the mind first through the practice of right conduct and then take to the practice ofconcentration. Concentration without purity is of no use. There are some occultists who haveconcentration; but they have no good character. This is the reason why they do not make anyprogress in the spiritual path.He who has a steady posture and has purified the nerves and the vital sheath by the constantpractice of control of breath will be able to concentrate easily. Concentration will be intense if youremove all distractions. A celibate who has preserved his energy will have wonderfulconcentration.Some foolish, impatient students take to concentration at once without any preliminaryethical training. This is a serious blunder. Ethical perfection is of paramount importance.You can concentrate internally on any one of the seven centres of spiritual energy. Attentionplays a prominent part in concentration. He who has developed his powers of attention will havegood concentration. A man who is full of passion and all sorts of desires, can never concentrate onany object even for a short period. His mind will be restless like that of a monkey.A scientist concentrates his mind and invents many things. Through concentration he opensthe layers of the gross mind and penetrates deeply into the higher regions of the mind and getsdeeper knowledge. He concentrates the energies of his mind and focuses them on the materials he isanalysing and finds out their secrets.He who has gained abstraction (withdrawing the senses from the objects) will have goodconcentration. You will have to pass on the spiritual path step by step, stage by stage. To start with,lay the foundation of right conduct, postures, regulation of breath, and abstraction. Thesuperstructure of concentration and meditation will be successful only then.44YOGA IN DAILY LIFE"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"You should be able to visualise the object of concentration very clearly even though it is notthere. You must form the mental picture at a moment’s notice. If you have good concentration youcan do this without much difficulty.At the initial stage of practice you can concentrate on thetick-ticksound of a watch, theflame of a candle or any other object which is pleasing to the mind. This is concrete concentration.There is no concentration without something at which the mind may rest. The mind can easily befixed on any object which is pleasing. It is very difficult to fix the mind in the beginning on an objectwhich it dislikes.Sit on lotus-pose, Padmasana, with crossed legs. Fix the gaze on the tip of the nose. This iscalled nasal gaze. Do not make any strained effort. Gently look at the tip of the nose. Practise forone minute in the beginning. Gradually increase to 30 minutes or one hour. This practice steadiesthe mind. It develops the power of concentration. Even when you walk in the streets keep up thispractice.Sit on lotus-pose with crossed legs or in “perfected pose” (Siddhasana) in your meditationroom and practise fixing the mind at the junction of the eyebrows gently for half a minute. Thengradually increase the period to half an hour. There must not be the least strain in this practice. Thispractice removes the restlessness of mind and develops concentration. This is known as the frontalgaze because the eyes are directed towards the frontal bone of the forehead. You can select eitherthe nasal gaze or the frontal gaze according to your temperament and capacity.If you want to increase your power of concentration you will have to reduce your worldlyactivities. You will have to observe the vow of silence every day for two hours or more.Practise concentration till the mind is well established on the object of concentration. Whenthe mind runs away from the object bring it back again.When concentration is deep and intense, the senses cannot operate. He who practises perfectconcentration for three hours daily will have tremendous psychic powers. He will have a strongwill-power.There was a workman who used to manufacture arrows. Once he was very busy at his work.He was so much absorbed in his work that he could not notice even the big party of a King and hisretinue passing in front of his shop. Such must be the nature of your concentration when you fixyour mind on God. You must have the idea of God and God alone. No doubt, it takes some time tohave complete concentration or attain one-pointedness of mind. You will have to struggle very hardto have a single-minded concentration.Even if the mind runs outside during your practice in meditation do not bother. Allow it torun. Slowly try to bring it to your object of concentration. By repeated practice the mind will befinally focussed on your heart, on the Self, the Indweller of your heart—-the final goal of life. In thebeginning the mind may run out 80 times. After six months it may run 70 times; within a year it mayrun 50 times; within two years it may run 30 times; in five years it may be completely fixed in theDivine Consciousness. Then it will not run out at all even if you try your best to bring it out. It will45MIND AND MEDITATION"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"be like a wandering bull which used to run to the gardens of neighbours for grazing but which noweats fresh grain and extract of cotton seeds in its own resting place.MeditationMeditation is an unbroken uninterrupted or incessant flow of the idea of the object that isconcentrated upon. If you close your eyes when you do Trataka and mentally visualise the picture ofthe object of Trataka, it is concrete meditation or Saguna meditation. Concrete meditation on anobject is necessary for an untrained mind, in the beginning. If you meditate on an abstract idea, itwill constitute Nirguna meditation.For beginners whose minds are engrossed in and filled with passions and impurities,meditation on a form is absolutely necessary. A Murty or any concrete form such as a Pratima isindispensable during meditation or Japa. Without undergoing a course of concrete meditation in thebeginning, especially for the ordinary type of people, it is absolutely impossible to start Nirgunameditation at the very outset. The vast majority of aspirants commit a serious mistake in jumping toNirguna meditation all at once. They will only break their legs. The mind is so framed as it demandsa form to cling to. Meditation on a Murty, i.e., a stone-image remains the stone as it is, but thedevotion of the devotee goes to the Lord. He is pleased. Divine Grace will surely descend. You willhave to superimpose the attributes of God on the stone-image. You will have to imagine that there isthe Antaratman hidden in the image, the all-pervading, indwelling presence, the pureconsciousness, the Chaitanya at the back of it.A child makes a toy-child (doll) of rags, and plays with it with motherly instincts of nursingand protection. The doll remains the same but the child develops the motherly instincts for futuredevelopment and manifestation. Even so, a Bhakta in worshipping a Murty, develops devotion,Bhakti. Anugraha, Preeti, Viraha and Mahabhava and eventually Parabhakti.An aspirant can meditate on the physical form of his Guru.Sit on Padmasana or Siddhasana in a solitary room. Close the eyes. Concentrate on thepicture of Lord Vishnu in the heart. Imagine that Lord Vishnu is seated there with His four hands inthe centre of a blazing sun of light, with conch, disc, mace and lotus. Mentally visualise the picture,from head to foot as you have done in Trataka. Do mental Puja also. Offer flowers, Arghya, Sandalpaste, incense; burn camphor, etc., mentally. Similarly you can meditate on Lord Siva, Krishna,Devi. Instead of concentrating at the heart, you can concentrate at the space between the twoeyebrows (Trikuti). Practise this Saguna meditation for two years and then take to Nirgunameditation. You can do meditation while sitting or standing or walking. For beginners a sittingposture is necessary. Repeat your Guru Mantra or the Mantra of the Ishta Devata mentally.Associate the ideas of purity, infinity, eternity, immortality, Vyapaka, Paripurna, Sat-Chit-Ananda,Akhanda, Advaita, Chidakasa, etc., with Om repetition.46YOGA IN DAILY LIFE"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"SamadhiSamadhi is deep sleep with the full knowledge of the Self. You get this sleepless sleep whenyou have burnt the five Jnana Indriyas in the fire of Wisdom, when you have extricated yourselffrom the clutches of Avidya, Maya or ignorance and when you have controlled all desires.Tadevartha matranirbhasamSvarupa Soonyameva Samadhi—Patanjali Yoga Sutra.Samadhi Samathovastha Jeevatma Paramatmano—Dattatreya Samhita.This is not a state of nothingness but a state of “everythingness.” You enter into a state ofAbsolute Awareness, in which time and place disappear; every place is here; every period of time is‘now’; and everything is “I”. In this state you have obtained Bliss and Eternal Life.During cosmic consciousness, you are in touch with universal knowledge and life. TheDivine principle flows through you. Your little, individual personality is lost. Your individual willhas become merged in the cosmic will or Ishvara’s will. You are aware of the oneness of life. Youhave the one consciousness—CHINMAYA—that the universe is filled with one life, that theuniverse is full of life.You have Tattva Jnana and you see the real universe, which is the essence or background ofthe universe of Matter, Energy and Mind. You are in a state of Bliss and Ecstasy beyondunderstanding and description. This is a cognitive trace or Turiya Avastha where Triputi(knowledge, knowable and knower) exists.Philosophy Of SleepStudy the condition of Sushupti Avastha or Jada Nidra, the state of deep sleep. There isneither the play of the mind nor the play of the Indriyas. There are no objects. There is neitherattraction nor repulsion (Raga, Dvesha). Wherefrom do you derive the Ananda in sleep? Theexperience in sleep is universal. There is no difference of opinion here. Everyone says: “I sleptsoundly. I knew nothing. I was very happy in sleep.” During deep sleep you rest in Sat-Chit-AnandaAtman and enjoy the Atmic bliss which is independent of object. The difference between deep sleepand Samadhi is that in deep sleep there is the veil of ignorance and in Samadhi this veil is removed.You draw four conclusions from sleep: (1) You exist. There is feeling of continuity ofconsciousness. (2) There is Advaita. (3) You are Ananda Svarupa. (4) The world is Mithya. Namesand forms are illusory. The world is a mere play of the mind. It is only a phenomenal appearance.When there is mind, there is world. If you can produce Manonasa (destruction of the mind)consciously through Yoga Sadhana, the world will disappear. You will feel the Atman everywhere.Even in the day time, you become one with the Atman whenever a desire is gratified. When youenjoy an object you become mindless (Amana) for a short time. You rest in your own Atman andenjoy the Atmic Bliss (spiritual Ananda). Ignorant persons attribute the happiness to the objects.Just as the dog which sucks a dry bone, foolishly imagines that blood comes from the dry bone,47MIND AND MEDITATION"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"whereas in reality the blood oozes out of its own palate, so also foolish persons imagine thatthe happiness comes from external objects, while they actually derive the happiness from their ownAtman within.

There is nohalf-measure in the spiritual path.Control the body first. Then purify your thoughts through prayer, Japa, Kirtan, Vichara andmeditation.Make a firm resolve “I will be a perfect Brahmachari from today.”May the Lord give you spiritual strength to resist temptation and kill lust!ImportanceBrahmacharya—that is the Divine world. It is the sum and substance of Yoga. ThroughAvidya that is forgotten. It is the supreme Yoga that Lord Krishna emphasises repeatedly in HisImmortal Song—the Gita. In Chapter VI, Sloka 14, it is very clearly stated that the vow ofBrahmacharya is necessary for meditation (Brahmachari vrate sthitah). Again in Chapter XVIISloka 14, He says that Brahmacharya is one of the austerities of the body (sarira tapas). Now wehave one of the most important statements made in the Gita, that Yatis practise Brahmacharya inorder to attain the goal, spoken of by the knowers of Veda (Chapter VIII Sloka 11). This is takenfrom Katha Upanishad (Chapter II Mantra 15). There Yama says to Nachiketas that the life ofBrahmacharya is necessary to reach the goal: “That whose form and essential nature all the Vedasdeclare; in order to attain which they prescribe austerities; desiring to know which the great onesobserve Brahmacharya; that symbol will briefly tell thee, it is OM.”Change The Angle Of VisionFor a scientist a woman is a mass of electrons. For a Vaiseshic philosopher of RishiKanada’s school of thought, she is a conglomeration of atoms, Paramanu. Dvianu, Trianu (twoatoms, three atoms). For a tiger she is a prey. For the passionate husband she is an object ofenjoyment. For a crying child she is an affectionate mother, who will give it milk, sweets, and othercomforts. For a jealous sister or sister-in-law she is an enemy. For a Viveki or Vairagi (a man ofdiscrimination and dispassionate nature) she is a combination of flesh, bone, urine, faecal matter,wool, pus, perspiration, blood, phlegm, etc. For a full-blown Jnani she is Sat-Chit-Ananda Atman.“Sarvam Khalvidam Brahma”—All is Brahman only.

Thedescent of the Divine grace is due to countless virtuous actions done by him with Nishkama Bhavaduring several births.This world is as unreal as a shadow, bubble or froth. Why do you run after wealth, womanand the toys of name and fame?Some Bhaktas think that they have made a complete self-surrender. But they have their ownways sometimes and cherish some desires. They walk in their own egoistic ways. This surrender isinsincere. They are not entitled to the descent of Divine Grace.No one is always praised. No one is also always censured.

What will give peace of mind to those who are materially poor.A. Peace of mind for one and all can be had only by realising God.

What is the right way of praying to God and how far is it possible for an ordinary man topray like that?A. The main thing to be looked to while praying to the Lord is one’s mental Bhava. Thereshould be no selfish motive. Pray to God for purity, devotion, light and knowledge. You will getthese things. Pray in any way you like. Become as simple as a child. Open freely the chambers ofyour heart. Have no cunningness. Every man can and should adopt this attitude.Q. What is the real aim of education?A. Education should teach the pupils to love God and man. Education should instruct thestudents, to be truthful, morally sound, fearless, humble, and merciful. Education should teach thestudents to practise right conduct, right thinking, right living, right action, self-sacrifice and toattain knowledge of the Self.

Celibacy is a great desideratum for the path of Yoga. Though it is in no way necessary foryou to abandon home, wife and children, yet you would be well advised to reduce all carnalrelationship with your partner to the minimum. Married life, if lived in a perfect ideal manner, is nobar to the attainment of Mukti. Mukti is a question of sincere, earnest Sadhana and the Grace of theLord.Ten Vital InstructionsThere is no use of talking on abstruse Vedantic Philosophy. If I begin to explainAdhyaropa-Apavada, Bhaga-Tyaga Lakshana, and the Neti-Neti doctrines, they will all be Greekand Latin to you. I want to bring home to your minds some important points which you will be ableto put into daily practice. Get up at 4 a.m.—Brahmamuhurta which is very favourable formeditation. Answer the calls of nature. Wash your face. Do Japa and meditation for 1 or 2 hours. Inthe early morning the mind is free from worldly Samskaras. It is more or less like a blank sheet ofpaper. It can be moulded very easily. Have your own meditation room. Then read one chapter of theGita. Observe Mouna for 2 hours daily. Mouna helps concentration and affords peace of mind.Energy is conserved and will-power is developed. Take Sattvic food and Mithahara. Do someAsanas and Pranayamas regularly to keep up your health and to steady the mind. Take milk andfruits on Ekadasi. Spend one tenth of your income in charity. Charity purifies the heart. DevelopSattvic virtues such as tolerance, mercy, forgiveness, nobility, etc. Preserve the Veerya. Keep ahomeopathic chest of twelve tissue remedies. This is a Maha-Yoga for you. Give medicine to all thesick persons. Become a member of some social institution and do social service wholeheartedlywithout expectation of reward and without egoism. This is a beautiful Sadhana for Self-realisation.Pancha Maha YajnasI shall speak a word on the Pancha Maha Yajnas which are intended to be performed by thehouseholders for purification of heart. The five great Yajnas are:(1) Deva Yajna is offering oblations to Devatas with recitation of Vedic Mantras.(2) Rishi Yajna consists of study of Vedas and teaching of Vedas to students and offering ofoblations to Rishis.(3) Pitru Yajna consists of Tarpana or oblations to departed souls and Shraaddha or annualreligious rites performed for them.(4) Bhuta Yajna is distribution of food to crows, cows and other animals. This developscosmic love and Advaitic Bhava.(5) Atithi Yajna is giving food to guests and honouring them.56YOGA IN DAILY LIFE"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Every householder should perform these five Yajnas. If he fails to do, he will suffer fromPratyaya Dosha (the sin of omission). The fire place, the water pot, the cutting, grinding andsweeping apparatuses are the five places where injury to life is daily being committed. These sinsare washed away by the five Maha Yajnas which every Dvija ought to perform; they are intended tosatisfy the Bhutas, the Rishis, the men, the gods and the Pitrus.The Pitrus are forefathers who dwell in the Pitruloka. They possess powers of clairvoyanceand clairaudience. When Mantras are recited, they exercise a tremendous influence through theirvibrations over the reciter of the Mantras, and his forefathers to whom they are directed. The Pitrushear the Mantras through their power of clairaudience, and are pleased. They bless those who offerthe oblation. In Shraaddha, the essence of food offerings is taken up by Sun’s rays to Suryaloka andthe departed souls are pleased with the offerings which reach them through the Sun. Even inGermany, many persons perform Tarpana and Shraaddha. They have scientifically investigated thebeneficial effects of such oblations. It is the imperative duty of all householders to performShraaddha and Tarpana to propitiate the Rishis and Pitrus. It is only deluded souls with pervertedintellect who misconstrue these things and neglect to perform the sacred ceremonies and suffer as aconsequence.Sankirtan Dhvanis1.

Samsara (world) is Mithya, Asara, Apadramania, evanescent, impermanent, full ofmiseries, untruth, hatred and selfishness, disease and pain. It is a long dream. Be not worldly.3. Time is most precious. Utilise every second profitably.4. Serve Sadhus, Sannyasins, the sick, the poor and the country. This is Pada-Seva of God.5. Whenever your friend is annoyed with you, speak to him first, with a smile, and apologisesincerely with tears in your eyes even though you may be in the right. Serve him nicely with Prem.Vindictive spirit is a deadly enemy of peace, devotion and Jnana.6. Observe Mouna (silence) during food. Observe Mouna for six hours on Sundays.7.

Repeat“OM SANTI” twelve times mentally and drink some cold water when you detect the least symptomof irritation in your mind.9. Sleep always alone. Take one meal and some milk at night on Sundays. Do one lakh ofRama-Nama Japa on Sundays.10.

The key to saintliness is humility and self mortification. The light of saintliness issilent meditation. The garb of saintliness is virtue and tolerance, not the Gerua cloth alone.Pravritti and Nivritti are not two different paths. They are two aspects of one and the samepath. There is Pravritti in Nivritti and Nivritti in Pravritti. It is the mental state that counts. Look atJanaka, the king of Videhas. In him, there was absolute Nivritti in Pravritti. Always remember:“Yogasthah kuru karmani sangam tyaktva Dhananjaya.”Man is the master of his own destiny. He sows an action and reaps a habit; sows a habit andreaps a character; sows a character and reaps a destiny. So he is entirely responsible for hisPrarabdha Karma. Prarabdha is under his Adheena or control. He will become an absolute fatalistand a slothful, inactive man, if he attributes everything to a pre-ordained destiny or Prarabdha. Lethim awaken his free Will. Let him avail himself of his Paramartha (Will). God has endowed manwith Buddhi, independent free thinking principle, rational reasoning and all sorts of faculties. Hecan control atoms; he can control elements; he can fly in air; he can forward a thought from onecorner to another corner of the world; he can command electricity to pump out water from a well; hecan walk over water, he can sit on fire; he can pass from one body to another; he can roam about theworld without being seen by anyone.In fact there is nothing impossible for him under the sun. Instead of realising his real natureby introspection within himself or Atmic enquiry, he dwells in an instinctive plane, wanders aboutin vain here and there in this phenomenal world of mere mental creation and forgets themagnanimity of his real Self. He worships man instead of worshipping God. He is aman-worshipper. He signs “I beg to remain. Your obedient servant.” Instead of asserting his divinenature as a centre of consciousness in the ocean of life—instead of styling himself as a Director,Controller and Supporter of Universe.

His father gave him the nameThopaga (which means “delightful to hear”). He had one sister by name Peta. Milarepa’s father wasMila-Sherab-Gyaltsen. Milarepa was born in a rich family. His hair was plaited with gold andturquoises when he was young. When Milarepa reached the age of seven, his father died. His unclewas in charge of the estate of Milarepa. He deceived Milarepa and his mother and ill-treated them.Milarepa was a black-magician in the beginning. He destroyed his enemies by launching ahailstorm just to please his mother. Then he repented very much and turned to the “white path” orthe path of virtue.Marapa was the Guru of Milarepa. Milarepa was also known by the name of Jetsun. Marapatested Jetsun very much in various ways.With great difficulty Milarepa got the highest initiation from his Guru, and became his petdisciple. He practised severe austerities and meditation in solitary caves. Demema, the wife ofMarapa, treated Milarepa with kindness and tender affection, because Milarepa was energetic,sincere, hardworking and intelligent. He was shut up in a cave. Food was passed inside by theservant of Marapa through a small aperture in the side. Milarepa used to sit in a rigid posture with alighted-lamp on his head, without moving till the light was out, were it night or day.Milarepa meditated in various caves. His body was reduced to a skeleton owing to severeausterities. He lived on nettles only for several months. He followed the instructions of his Guru tothe very letter. He developed various Siddhis.

It throbbed and vibrated and was on the point of crumblingdown.Milarepa attained the state of Buddha-hood. The caves where he practised devotion andmeditation are even now places of pilgrimage and worship. He had a large number of followers.Even now there are people in Tibet who belong to his school. He died in A.D. 1135 at the age ofeighty-four. Those who desire to have a detailed study of his life can get a copy of the book “Tibet’sGreat Yogi—Milarepa” (by W.Y. Evans Wentz, Jesus College Oxford) from the Oxford UniversityPress, London.Yogi JaigisavyaThere was a great Yogi by name Jaigisavya. He had full knowledge of all his previous birthscontinuously for ten Maha Pralayas. Rishi Avatya approached Jaigisavya and asked him, “Youhave experienced the troubles of life in hells, among animals and in various wombs. You have beenborn again among men and Gods. What are your experiences of pain in hells; what are yourexperiences of pleasures in heaven? Which is greater: pleasure or pain in human birth?”Yogi Jaigisavya gave the following answer: “I have lived through ten Mahakalpas. I haveexperienced the troubles of hells and animal life. I have been born again and again among men andGods. There is no pleasure at all in anything, anywhere in this world or heaven. I consider all that Ihave experienced as only pain.”Avatya again questioned “Oh Yogi, do you think that the joy and contentment obtainedduring the state of Prakriti-laya also comes under the category of pain?”Yogi Jaigisavya replied, “The joy of Prakritilaya is no doubt superior to the sensual pleasurethat is derived from objects but it is only pain when compared to the pure Bliss of absolute freedom(Kaivalya). The joy of Prakritilaya is only an effect of Guna. There is still the thread of desire(Trishnatantu) here. When the Yogi becomes absolutely desireless, then only does he enjoy pure,unalloyed, infinite, eternal bliss.”SabariTrue devotion:Sabari was a woman of the forest tribe of Bhils. She presented Sri Rama withsome fruits which she had bitten to know if they were sweet. Rama accepted the offering withintense delight on account of the true spirit of devotion in which it was made.What is wanted is a loving heart of the Bhakta. God does not want precious gifts. The prayermust be Antarika (from the bottom of the heart). Love without attachment is needed. Theself-surrender must be sincere, perfect, ungrudging and unreserved. When this is effected you neednot do any Sadhana at all. Divine Sakti will do everything for you.61STORIES OF SAINTS"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Sibi And BuddhaKaruna is the highest Sadhana:Sibi was a Solar king famous for his generosity.

There is no Sadhana greaterthan Karuna (compassion).Sundaramoorthy NayanarTrue Devotion, Inaction in action:Parvati asked Lord Siva; “Oh! Jagat Pathi. Oh! Lord ofthe Universe. How is it you like very much Sundaramoorthy, when he is leading a lascivious life.This seems to me a mystery. Kindly explain this, my Lord.”[Sundaramoorthy was a Tamil saint who wrote several Tevaram songs in Tamil. He had aconcubine. He was living always in her house. But his mind, theChoranariwas immersed inBrahman. A Choranari while engaged in the affairs of her house, thinks of her paramour. Similarly,a Jnani always dwells in Brahman, while he uses the instrument mind for various worldly activities.Sundaramoorthy was a perfect Jnani.]Lord Siva replied “Oh Parvathi! Siva Maya! Look at the Bhakti of Sundaramoorthy. He is aJnani also. He is Asakta, Asanga, Nirlipta, (unattached). He is not affected by actions. I willdemonstrate this to you.” Lord Siva assumed the form of an old man and pretended to get himselfdrowned in a tank. Parvathi was standing on the shore. If anybody came to rescue the old man,Parvathi would say; “If you are a sinner, do not touch my husband.” Many offered to rescue the oldman but none dared to go near him when they heard Parvathi’s words—“If you are a sinner...”.Their hearts were tainted with the inveterate idea of “sin and vice” a strong idea of impurity, ahaunting idea indeed. Sundaramoorthy came straight from the concubine’s house with dishevelledhair. He saw a huge crowd near the tank and the old man in a drowning state,—the pretender LordSiva with head coming up, and going down. He prepared himself to rescue the old man. Parvathiinterposed “If you are a sinner, do not attempt to rescue my drowning husband.” Sundaramoorthyremarked “Oh foolish woman! The old man is in a critical juncture. What is sin? What is virtue? It isall foolish, creative imagination or Srishti Sankalpa of the mind. Shut up your mouth. I care not a jotabout those relative terms, sin and virtue. I am beyond sin and virtue. Get away, O! preposterouslady! I will jump into the water now.” Sundaramoorthy plunged into the water, swam a few yards,brought the old man to the shore, gave him artificial respiration, brought back to life, and went backto the concubine’s house.Lord Siva said, “Oh Parvathi! Look at Sundaramoorthy’s wisdom and Karuna, his mentalattitude of ‘inaction in action.’ Are you satisfied now? That is the reason why I loveSundaramoorthy.” Parvathi now understood the secret of action and inaction and eulogised herLord, Siva.62YOGA IN DAILY LIFE"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Akalkot SwamiAkalkot Swami was a Jnani. He lived in Akalkot in Maharastra. In the later period of life, hebecame a Jnani of theBrahma Varishtatype by withdrawing the external consciousness and livingin the pure Nirvishesha, Nirguna Brahman of Sri Sankara. He shut out the phenomenalconsciousness. He had to be spoon-fed with milk just as a man is fed in the comatose state. He usedto pass motions in an unconscious state. People used to clean him. The same was the case with themost famous Kumbakonam Mouni Swami of Southern India. This Swami lived for 25 years in anunconscious state. He was fed all along on an easy chair.A poor Brahmin performed Tapas for the sake of getting money for the celebration of hisdaughter’s marriage. He propitiated God Ganesha. Ganesha appeared in his dream and told the poorman to go to Akalkot Swami. The poor Brahmin went to Akalkot Swami. Swamiji asked theorthodox Brahmin to collect some bones. The poor Brahmin was very much perplexed. Anyhow, ashe was in bad need of money, he obeyed the words of Swamiji and collected some bones. Swamijitold the Brahmin to take this to his house. The Brahmin was greatly embarrassed. When he reachedthe house, he did not take the bones inside but kept them in a corner of the verandah. After threedays, he wanted to throw the bones away. When he lifted the bundle, he found it was very heavy. Heopened it, and found to his astonishment it was full of gold. The Brahmin said to himself: “I made aserious mistake. I ought to have collected some more bones.” Such is the power of greed whichkeeps you bound to this Samsara. Destroy greed, which disturbs peace. Have faith in Saints.Story Of An Old Man And A DonkeyYou cannot please the world:An old man was riding a donkey, while he was returning froma Sunday fair. His young son was walking. The passers-by saw this and remarked: “Look at thiscruel fellow. The young boy is walking all along. This stout man is riding on the donkey. Mercilesswretch!” As soon as the old man heard these harsh words, he got down from the donkey and put hisboy on the donkey. Some other people who were passing along the road saw this and remarked:“Loot at this cruel boy. The old, weak man is walking. Cheeky, arrogant, young, stout boy isenjoying a ride. Cruel boy!” Then the old man also got upon the donkey. They both rode the oldanimal. Some other people criticised: “Look at these two cruel fellows. The animal is old and weak.These two stout fellows are riding. Both are very, very cruel and heartless indeed!” They both gotdown and allowed the animal to walk freely. Some other passers-by remarked: “Look at these twofools. They have no brains. There is a good animal. They can quite easily ride and enjoy. They arewalking now.” Thus the old man was kicked and tossed about from both sides, like a drum. If youmarry, people will say that you are a passionate man. If you remain unmarried, people will say thatyou are a eunuch or impotent man. If you perform Japa, Sandhya, people will remark that you are agreat religious hypocrite. If you do not perform Sandhya they will still criticise you and say that youare an atheist. You can never please the world. Bhima advised Yudhishthira: “O Dharmaputra, youcan never please the world.” Be above the Dvandva ofNindaandStuthi,censure and praise. Do notbother yourself. Have no fear of public opinion. Rest in Samata.”Fear of public opinion is a great weakness.

He willhave to hear the shrill pure, inner voice within, the voice of the soul and follow this voice at all costs,despite public criticisms of all sorts. Many spiritually great men have given up their lives to keep uptheir convictions in the path of Truth. You can grow spiritually if you are above public opinion.Mark how Gandhiji stuck tenaciously to his principles despite public criticisms.

His Samadhi is on a famous mountain, Rock Fort Hills. The hillock also goesby his name, Tayumanaswami’s Rock Fort Hill. He was a Saint of infinite realisation. His songs ofrealisation are sung by everybody throughout South India. They contain soul-stirring, thrilling,soul-elevating, sublime thoughts. His songs are wonderful indeed. They are marvellous. His songsare in perfect harmony with the physical science. Even a marked atheist will be converted into atheist if he hears his songs. Many songs are good for the purpose of Nididhyasana, like AvadhootaGita. He was an embodiment of the Vedas. He was a living assurance of God-realisation. He neverpreached on platforms. He was a perfect Jnani, who was one with Brahman though his essentialnature, and being absorbed primarily in the qualified God, Saguna-Apara Brahman of Sri Sankara,he possessed all the eight Divine attributes. As a Jnani, he worked in all the bodies, he worked withthe very breath of Nature. He worked along with the wind that blew, with the rain that dropped fromheaven, and with the sunshine. If a Jnani elevates ten persons by removing their Avidya, the rootcause of all evils, that is the real Loka Sangraha. Social and political work concerns not a Jnani orreal Sannyasi.AkhaFamous Gujarati:Akha was a celebrated Saint of Gujarat. He was a goldsmith byprofession. He went to Benaras. Swami Brahmananda was holding Vedantic classes at night. Akhacould not get admission. He hid himself at night in a dustbin, behind Swami Brahmananda’sresidence and was attentively hearing the lessons for one year. One day, when one of the studentswas not able to answer one of the questions put by Swamiji, Akha gave an answer loudly frombehind the wall. Swami Brahmananda asked who it was that gave the beautiful answer? “I am Akhafrom Gujarat” was the reply. Swamiji said: “Come inside Akha.” Akha went inside and prostrated.Swamiji asked: “Who are you, Akha? How did you manage to come here at this hour?” Akha said,“Swami, I am a goldsmith. I am a strong Mumukshu. I have been hiding in this dustbin for the last12 months and hearing your instructions attentively. Kindly initiate me.” Swami Brahmanandafound him a suitable Adhikari and initiated him into the mysteries of Kaivalya. He became afull-blown Jnani.

He went to Benaras and performed Puja-Abhisheka of one vessel ofGangotri water on Kasi Visvanath. He proceeded to Rameswaram to perform Abhishekam there onRamalingeshwar. On the way, a few miles from Rameshwaram, Ekanath saw an emaciated,diseased ass dying of thirst. The sun was very scorching; Ekanath thought that God wanted to testhim. He was a Saint of Parabhakti. He saw and felt god in everything, in every movement, in everyaction. He could never be deceived. He thought, that, that was the best opportunity to serveRamalingeshwar in the ass. He never took this being for an ass. He forgot the Nama-rupa. He sawthe essence, Sat-Chit-Ananda, Asti, Bhati, Priya in the ass. He remembered the words of LordKrishna to Uddhava: “See me in everything. Make prostration to asses, etc., for, I am theAntaryamin in them.” Ekanath never grieved a bit that he had lost the chance of servingRamalingeshwar. He thought, “This is the best opportunity.

He will take a small piece of paper, squeeze it and produce lavender scent orany scent you want. He also demonstrated the power of the sun’s rays of giving sweet scent toordinary oil kept in a phial in the sun. He also showed how by the rays of the sun ordinary cottoncould be converted into sweets (Rasagullas). He demonstrated at the request of some of theEuropean tourists the power of the sun’s rays of giving sweet scents to the oil in the presence ofBrahmachari Kali Mohan, retired Deputy Magistrate. He informed the Brahmachari that heacquired the knowledge of the sun’s rays (Surya Rishini Jnana) in Tibet, where the Lamas teachtheir disciples the power of the different constituents of the sun’s rays.

So, many people came from Hardwar to see the fun. They went to the Kutir of the Sadhuand enquired what the matter was and asked: “Did you vomit the crow, Oh Santji” The Sadhu said:“I suffered from fever for the last ten days. I took some Ayurvedic medicine from KaliKambiliwala’s Ayurvedic Dispensary. I am very bilious owing to the improper functioning of theliver. I vomited yesterday morning and brought forth some black matter. They might have spread afalse rumour. That is all. I never vomited a black crow.” Do not be credulous. Always usecommonsense and reasons. The Sadhu vomited. That much is certain. He brought forth some blackmatter. That is also the truth. This turned into the wild rumour that he vomited a black crow!

Two Pailwans wanted to have a trialof their strength. One of them was a Punjabi, the other a Maharashtra. They entered the Talim orGotham or arena which was spread with sand or red earth. Wrestling started. Both demonstrated avariety of feats and manipulations. The Maharatta put on ‘scissors’ to the neck of the Punjabi—akind of feat where the knees are applied to the opponent’s shoulders to turn the man on his back, ‘toshow beat’. ‘To show beat’ is a wrestling terminology. If a man is put on his back, he is defeated, heis ‘shown’ beat. With great difficulty the Maharatta showed ‘beat’ to the Punjabi, and won the day.But the Punjabi, never admitted his defeat or ‘beat’. He loudly remarked “I am not at all defeated.Oh spectators! just see, there is no sand on my moustache.”Do not behave like this Punjabi, “With no sand on moustache.” You will be ruined. Youmust always admit your faults and weaknesses. If you are self-sufficient, with stubborn pride,arrogance and egoism, you will never evolve. You must always analyse your mind, scrutinise andfind out all your defects and weaknesses and employ suitable methods to eschew them. Purificationof the mind is the first part of Yoga (Chitta Suddhi).Story Of A SadhuWay to Santi—God is everything:A Sadhu was severely beaten by a householder and was lying unconscious on the ground. Avirtuous, pious Grihastha pitied this Sadhu and took him in a Tonga to his house. He fed him slowlywith a little warm milk. The Sadhu was gradually recovering his lost senses. After a couple of hourshe was brought back to full objective consciousness.The pious Grihastha asked the Sadhu, “Who beat you?”Sadhu replied: “He, who is giving me milk, beat me.”The Grihastha was greatly astonished at these words. He was rather perplexed. He could notproperly grasp the sense.Then the Sadhu explained to the Grihastha, the laws of destiny, the laws of Prarabdha, thelaws of action and reaction.

Kindly advise him to give up eating blacksugar.” The Saint said, “Come after fifteen days.” The Saint himself used to take much black sugarlike the boy. He gave up at once eating sugar for fifteen days. He found no trouble or mentaldisturbance. When the old man came on the fifteenth day with the boy, the Saint addressed the boywith great force, “My dear boy! Give up this habit of eating sugar at once.” The old man asked theSaint, “O Sadhu Maharaj! Why did you not advise the boy on the first day?” The Saint replied: “Iwas myself a victim of the sugar-eating habit. How could I then be able to advise others? I gave it upfor fifteen days. I corrected myself first. How can I preach to others when I am myself filled withDoshas?” The advice of the Saint had very great effect on the mind of the boy. He gave up eatingsugar from that day.The moral of this story is that you must put a thing into actual practise yourself before youbegin to preach it to others. Then only will it produce a lasting impression. Example is better thanprecept. It is easier to preach to twenty than to be one of the twenty in following the preaching.67STORIES OF SAINTS"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Section XIMANTRA YOGA SADHANAMantra Yoga is an exact science. “Mananat trayate iti mantrah”—by the Manana (constantthinking or recollection) of which one is released from the round of births and deaths, is Mantra.Every Mantra has a Rishi who gave it to the world; a Mantra, a Devata, the Bija or seedwhich gives it a special power, the Sakti and the Kilakam or the pillar.A Mantra is Divinity.
