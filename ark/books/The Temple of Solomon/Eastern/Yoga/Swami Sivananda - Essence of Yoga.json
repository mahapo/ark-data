The wider life is invisible, and the visible is a shadow cast by theinvisible which is the real. The shadow gives an idea of the substance, and one can pursue the pathto the true substance by the perception of the shadow. Human existence, by the fact of itslimitations, wants and various forms of restlessness, discontent and sorrow, points to a higherdesired end, incomprehensible though the nature of this end be.As life on this earth is characterised by incessant change, and nothing here seems to have thecharacter of reality, nothing here can satisfy man completely. The Bhagavad Gita has referred tothis world asanityam, asukham, duhkhalayam, ashashvatamóîImpermanent, unhappy, the abodeof sorrow, transientî. The sages of yore declared with immediate realisation that ìTruth is Oneî andthat the goal of human life is the realisation and the experience of this Truth.The universe is inconstant, and it is only a field of experience provided to the individuals sothat they may evolve towards the experience of the Highest Truth. It is the glory of the people ofBharatavarsha (India) that to them the visible universe is not real and the invisible Eternal alone isreal. They have no faith in what they perceive with the senses. They have faith only in that which isthe ground of all experience, beyond the senses, beyond even the individual mind.Earnest seekers used to seek shelter under great sages who purified the holy region of theHimalayas with their mighty presence, and lived the austere life of Yogis in order to attain freedomfrom the trammels of earth-bound life and rest in the beatitude of the Absolute, Brahman. This theyconsidered the true life, and thus the way of fulfilling the law of the Eternal.The great law-giver Manu, after describing the various tenets of Dharma, finally asserts:ìOf all these Dharmas, the Knowledge of the Self is the highest; it is verily the foremost of allsciences; for, by it, one attains immortality.î The pursuit of Dharma, Artha and Kama has itsmeaning in the attainment of Moksha which is the greatest of all the Purusharthas (end of humanlife). Dharma is the ethical and moral value of life; Artha is its material value; and Kama is its vitalvalue; but Moksha is the infinite value of existence which covers all the others and is itself fargreater than all these. Others exist as aids or preparations for Moksha. Without Moksha, they haveno value and convey no meaning. Their value is conditioned by the law of the Infinite, which is thesame as Moksha.The Vedas and the Upanishads are the exhalations of the Divine Being, and they give anexhaustive commentary on spiritual life. They are expositions of the significance and the import ofhuman life and of the method of the transmutation of the mortal appearance into the ImmortalEssence. The instance of the great Nachiketas and the story of his adventurous search for Truthnarrated in the thrillingKathopanishadserve as exemplars to all men capable of thought andreflection.Nothing of the world of sensibility can be of real valueóthis is what Nachiketas taughtthrough his memorable act of renunciation. Not even the longest life and the immense wealthoffered to him could tempt him. He persevered in his quest for the Highest, and in the end achievedvi"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"the Highest. Nothing short of it could satisfy him. Such are the true heroes. A real hero is not he whostands against bullets or risks his life in hazardous attempts, fights battles, dives into oceans andclimbs high cliffs, but he who subdues his senses and overcomes his mind, recognises the supremeunity of life and casts aside dualities and desires. To achieve this is the duty of man; this is theimmortal message of the sages of the Upanishads.The tangle of sense-experience in which man is caught is most vexing, and hard it is to freeoneself from it. Man is deluded by the notion of the reality of the so-called external relations ofthings and thus he comes to grief. The Mahabharata says that the contact of beings in this universe islike the contact of logs of wood in a flowing river, temporary. Yet the attachment to sense-perceptsis so strong that phantoms are mistaken for facts, the impure is mistaken for the pure, the painful forthe pleasant, and the not-self for the Self.The message of the ancient sages is that the life one lives in the sense-world is deceptive, forit hides the Existence underlying all things and makes one feel that the particular presentation offorms before the senses alone is real. ìChildren run after external pleasures and fall into the net ofwide-spread death. The heroes, however, knowing the Immortal, seek not the Eternal among thingsunstable here,î says theUpanishad. The call of the ancient sages to man is: ìO son of the Immortal!Know yourself as the Infinite! become the All. This is the supreme blessing. This is the supremebliss.î This is the undying message to man.The sages have again and again stressed: ìIf one knows It (i.e., the Immortal Being) here,then there is the true end of all aspirations! If one does not know It here, great is the loss for him.î(Kenopanishad). And sage Yajnavalkya says that all great deeds done in this world, without theknowledge of the One Imperishable Being, are not worth anything. Humanitarian services; fastsand charity; oneís political, national, social and individual life; should all be based on the feeling ofuniversal brotherhood which is the eternal expression of the Reality of universal Selfhood.Humanity can hope for peace when this condition, discovered and laid down by the Rishis,viz., abiding by the law of the Divine is fulfilled. Peace can be had only to the extent that the systemof the Divine is adhered to in life. And this peace is inversely proportional to the love of body,individuality and its relations in the world, in which humanity is generally steeped. An ëawakeningíof a higher consciousness is necessary so that disorder and discontent may be abolished.Education of humanity in the right direction is the precondition of world peace.Materialism, atheism, scepticism and agnosticism which are rampant in these days and which haverobbed man of his reverence for the Supreme Absolute are mainly responsible for the increasingselfishness, craving, confusion, violence and agitation of mind that are seething in the world. Manshould learn that behind the appearance of materiality, discreteness, externality, doubt andimpermanence, there is the reality of spirituality, unity and infinity.Without the recognition of this reality, life loses life and becomes an emptiness, devoid ofmeaning and purpose, dead, as it were. To live in the divine is to die to the narrowness of the senseworld; and to be confined to the latter is to ëdestroy oneselfí (in the words of theIsavasyopanishad).The present trend of life has to be overhauled, and a reorientation in it brought about in the light ofvii"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"morality, ethics and spirituality. The change that is required is not merely in the outward form but inthe very perspective and the inner constitution of the system of living.This can be done when manís ideals are based on the truths of the spirituality of Oneness,lifted above blind beliefs, differences and materiality. When this is achieved, man would havefulfilled his great duty here. For the man scorched in the waterless desert of worldliness, the onlyhope is in the cool waters of the Ganga of wisdom, flowing from the Himalayan heights of the sagesof theUpanishads. Drink from this perennial fount, and refresh yourself.THE SPIRIT OF INDIAN SPIRITUAL INHERITANCEThe true greatness of Indian spiritual inheritance consists in the secret and glorious methodsit has delivered to us for allaying lifeís sorrow and human unhappiness and for acquiring for thecircumstance of human existence, the infinite peace and perfection of the Divine Being. Humangrief cannot be alleviated as long as the human individual is immured in ignorance and strivesmerely for his individual pleasure and good. The genius of India has, to its immortal honour, soaredabove the conventional ties and the bonds of society, grasped the spiritual truth, realised it andproclaimed to the world, for the welfare of all mankind, that ìLife is Oneî and not many. Apartfrom the petty disharmonies between one person and another, the nations of the world seem to beseparated from each other and this virulent notion of division and separation is the mother of warand destruction. Deceived by the spectacular advancement of scientific knowledge, modern mindin all countries and continents has not cared to understand the fundamental meaning of life, andsought its satisfaction in a sensational floating upon the apparently attractive scum of Existence.Such has been the spirit in which science has taken its marvellous strides in progress, that it hasnothing in its constitution to drive it towards a grasp of the deep and significant changes that manundergoes beneath his scalp, towards understanding the potentialities of man as a mind, as a heart,as a spirit, as a creative entity, towards directing his aspirations, towards aiding the blossoming ofthe noblest forces that lie buried and latent in his bosom. Redounding to the eternal credit of thegenius of India, there lies the momentous fact that at the very dawn of civilisations, it has raised thedeepest issues of life, questioned the limitations of human existence, ventured forth for a solutioninto the realms of that Infinite Power that is found ëfeeblyí interpenetrating this world of physics,physical experience, materialistic philosophy and ësputniks,í discovered that guiding, governingand sustaining Permanent Ground upon which is played the tragi-comic drama of life and the prideof men that are dressed in brief authority. If there is anything valuable in life as a whole, it is theknowledge of the solution of the apparent riddle of existence, the knowledge of the essential natureand the real destiny of man, the knowledge of manís real relations to the other men, to the universe,to the Transcendence, and this knowledge is the glorious heritage of India. The men of India whoare also the men of God, men who have imposed upon themselves the disciplines that lead them toPerfection, to living the good life, the ideal life, the divine life, the life in the inner Reality and forthe happiness of mankind, for the solidarity of the world, have discovered the road to Success andAchievement, discerned the clues to progress and perfection, in a strict adherence to the rhythms ofthe universal laws and the eternal verities that guide in accordance to the genius inherent in them,humanity as a whole and all manifestation to the final denouement in a Divine Existence.viii"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"The attitude of life which the Indians developed was based upon the nature of the End or theGoal to be attained through the instrumentality of the phenomenon of lifeólife which is a step, astage, and not the end in itself. This attitude ensouls the righteous law, the Dharma, and to it, theuniverse becomes what it intrinsically is, the Dharma-Kshetra, or the arena for the display and thejustification of the prowess of the right action, the action whose whole spirit moves towards therealisation of the absolute Good that is the nature of the Infinite Being. The ideal of Dharma formsthe substratum upon which is built the structure of the whole life of man who wishes to resolve theriddle of his personal life, win victory over the struggle of existence, be crowned with a strange andethereal joy even while he is living in the environment of the world, of this imperfect earth that isthe heir to change, sorrow, and death. Dharma is virtue and virtue is that which leads one to the mostperfect condition, the condition that is identical with the ultimate success constituted of the joy oflife, unlimited, unfettered and unalloyed, complete beyond expression. As the highest virtue thatman may practise, Ahimsa is both a negative withdrawal and a positive assertion of the ëmindí. It isrefraining from doing, speaking and thinking anything which will cause pain and sorrow to anyother individual, to any living being. This represents the negative aspect of the discipline ofAhimsa. Its positive aspect is brought out by an expression of universal love, love that has nopartiality, love that excludes nothing, love that cares not for the effect of love! The ideal of universallove is a spontaneous self-fulfilment in the delight of a discovery of Oneself, of the universallyself-same, our own inner consciousness in all. Until this is done, no civilization is genuine, noculture is true, nothing is perfect and lasting. In one word, it is in the light of absolute Conciousnesswhich is undifferentiated that Ahimsa which is more a matter of spirit than an effect of a mere act, ispractised.Immediately succeeding the devotion to the principle of Ahimsa, comes the practice of theexcellence of truth. To the spiritual genius, Truth is more than truth-speaking; it is God or theAbsolute; it is that which triumphs, not untruth. Again, Truth is right; untruth is wrong; that whichelevates one and takes one nearer to God is right, that which brings one down and takes one awayfrom God is wrong. And that God towards which our whole inner being must rise, in the indivisibleunity of conscious existence, the infinity of delight and awareness. Control over passionsconstitutes the essence of truth; self-denial or refraining from greedy indulgence is truth; to permitthe spiritual element in us triumph is truth. Truth is a life in the eternal. Untruth is change, decay anddeath. Love is truth; hatred is untruth; harmony is truth; disharmony is untruth. There is no greatersin than hatred and battleóthe pungent word and the insolent action, the arrogance and theuncharitableness, the egoistic self-assertion and vehement action of the selfish impulse. Relativetruths are valid only insofar as they do not run against the grain of absolute truth which is the Eternalin the highest sense.The third canon is the self-control which is the holding in check of the instinctive urges thattry to drag the individual away from the experience of the truth. Self-control is a universal ruleunexceptionally applicable to all men and all women, at all places and at all times. It is the very keyto beatitude. Indulgence in externalities, in sensuous objects, in physical pleasures is the effect ofthe failure of the individual to discriminate the spiritual value from the material chaff, the Truthfrom the untruth. Desire to have contact with and enjoy outward things is the outcome of theignorance of the Truth that is God, the Truth that is the Infinite Existence. Self-control is therestraint of the outgoing tendencies of the senses and the mind and to centre the same in the activeparticipation of Truth-existence, the Universal One. This self-control, this energization ofix"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"consciousness, this Tapas, this restraining of oneís externalising, self-diffusing energies andfounding oneself upon that one Cosmic Being is Dharma that supports the life and law of theuniverse, integrates the being of man, and spreads before the vision of man the creativeGod-centred life. Adharma is selfishness and egoism of nature which leads to self-imprisonment,suffering and failure in life. Absolute righteousness means the sacrifice of the self for universalwell-being, the well-being pertaining not merely to the earth but to the highest spiritual reality, thewell-being of keeping the Consciousness in its poise liberated from the distraction engendered bythe darkness of ignorance, separativencss, division, limitedness. It is the opposite of ìIî-ness andìmineî-ness which belong to the nature of the world of bondage.Life on earth is not self-sufficient and, hence, there is perpetual flux of states to reach otherstates of superior knowledge and happiness. Life in this world and in this body is only a preparation,a step for the higher life. That which we see and hear of is not the real; the Real is beyond this. Toreach the Real, the present life acts as a ladder, a field of activity that affords the conditions and thescope for the individual to establish its relations with the most exalted Divine Life. Wrong it is torestrict the outlook of our life to the perceptible phenomena and to judge our sense of values inrelation to the objective worth of things. The grandeur and greatness of our life rests upon themeasure to which we have raised ourselves into the law of inmost life in general, in the SupremeBeing. Dealings with one another are justified only so long as they do not deviate from the eternallaw of the Spiritual Nature. Neither social welfare nor national betterment is possible by mereclinging to shadows and forgetting the essential Substance. The substance of Truth does not belongto any particular person for it is the being and life of whatever that is. That which is One andCommon can only be divisionless and all-inclusive in a self-identical existence. This is the fulnessof attainment and the culmination of all the aspirations and ideals of life.In this integral spiritual view of life is rooted the ethical basis of social and domesticrelationship. Society is the collective body of individuals determined to pierce the veils and enterthe realms of Immortal Being with the power of a unified and common aspiration and struggle tograsp the Highest. Unified we live; divided we cease to live. Human relationship is not meant tosignify anything less than the attempt to live in everyday life the spiritual egoless love that is at thebackground of all existent beings. The love of the Self means the love of everything of the universe.The Indian genius would complete the teaching ìLove thy neighbour as thyselfî by addingìbecause thy neighbour is thy own Selfî. Altruistic love is the expression of eternal unison of theInfinite Life that lies at the depth of the universe. If family or society or nation is understood as ameans to separate one from another, however much large the scope of its inclusion of human beingsmay be, such a family, such a society, such a nation, cannot triumph. All relationship is expected toend in the absolute unity of existence excluding nothing from itself. This goal of life should beborne in mind in the process of daily activities if our actions are to be free from selfishness, at onewith the universal movement of Nature. Life is a divine worship. The proper conduct of family, theadministration of the country and the society is a part of the Universal Government which looks atthe entirety of beings with a strictly impartial eye. We live because God exists and our life is to beperfect and just even as God is perfect and just. We exist in Godís Being, we breathe and move inHim.x"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"The knowledge of this unity of life and the proper moral and the ethical attitude required tostart the process of realising it are achieved through being directly instructed by the teacher who istruly advanced in knowledge and has attained Self-perfection.The psychology of Gurukulavasa is inseparably connected with the science ofself-discipline and Self-knowledge. It is not the mechanical education of the present day that ismeant by real education in the Gurukula, but the means of erasing out the propensities that cloud theawareness of the Truth and controlling the distractive nature of the psyche. Self-mastery is theeffect of the protracted checking of the ego-sense and centring of it in the General God-Being whichis egoless, free from the sense of individual existence. The religion, the philosophy, the code ofethical and social law of India are all universal in their character. Universality is the expression ofthe nature of the Reality. The highest universal science of the Truth is the Vedanta in which areblended together the different existent views of life. The Vedanta is neither a sect nor a creed, butthe science of the Absolute Reality, the only life-giving science, the only solace to the intelligentmankind.The boldest proclamation of Vedanta is that man is in essence infinitely Divine, thateveryone is bound to succeed sooner or later, that all are bound to recover themselves in the InfiniteLife Divine. The ideal of the Vedanta is not merely a universal brotherhood nor merely living aunited and happy social life in the world of differentiated individuals, but the being of the AbsoluteEssence of the Highest Divinity which is the Life, Source and End of the Universe. The Vedanta isthe master-technique of transmuting the many into the Undivided One. It means Experience Wholeand existing as the birthless and deathless Infinite. This is the greatest heritage of India, this is thegreatest treasure that India has and this is the greatest gift that India can offer to the world. This isthe zenith of culture and civilization, this is the highest knowledge that man can ever attempt toacquire, this is the final fruition of the best of human aspiration.Theawe-inspiringgreatnessofIndiarestsmainlyuponthebedrockofAbsolute-Experience, of Truth-realisation, or a poised awareness of the Infinite here on earth, inthis life, in the environment of the dance and pageantry of finitude, relativity, objectivity. As thedwelling place of the Rishis, the Sages, the Men of God-Vision, India enjoys in the estimation of theworld a unique prerogative.All the grand ideals of worldís great religions that have moulded the characters of men, theloftiest tenets of ethics and morality that have raised human beings to the magnanimous height ofsupreme perfection and all the sublime truths of spirituality that have made man divine and haveshaped the spiritual life of nations and of the saviours of mankind, first took their origins in India,the land of those daring spiritual individuals who entered into the heart of the Absolute andproclaimed truths which have eternal values. With its spiritual horizons lit up with the deathlesslight of the Upanishadic wisdom, India is essentially a land of spiritual wealth, and its history is thehistory of religious experience. The Goal of India is Self-realisation or the attainment ofGod-Consciousness through the express manifestation of a spirit of renunciative detachment andthrough a dynamic divine knowledge. If men are but to understand the significance and the richnessof this spiritual inheritance of India, and make the spirit of this heritage part and parcel of their dailyawareness, they all would be veritable gods on earth.xi"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"CONTENTSPublishersí Note.........................................iiiUniversal Prayer.........................................ivPrayer To

Yoga is an exact science. It aims at theharmonious development of the body, the mind and the soul. Yoga is the turning away of the sensesfrom the objective universe and the concentration of the mind within. Yoga is eternal life in the soulor spirit. Yoga aims at controlling the mind and its modifications. The path of Yoga is an inner pathwhose gateway is your heart.Yoga is the discipline of the mind, senses and physical body. Yoga helps in theco-ordination and control of the subtle forces within the body. Yoga brings in perfection, peace andeverlasting happiness. Yoga can help you in your business and in your daily life. You can havecalmness of mind at all times by the practice of Yoga. You can have restful sleep. You can haveincreased energy, vigour, vitality, longevity and a high standard of health. Yoga transmutes animalnature into divine nature and raises you to the pinnacle of divine glory and splendour.The practice of Yoga will help you to control the emotions and passions and will give youpower to resist temptations and to remove the disturbing elements form mind. It will enable you tokeep a balanced mind always and remove fatigue. It will confer on you serenity, calmness andwonderful concentration. It will enable you to hold communion with the Lord and thus attain thesummum bonumof existence.If you want to attain success in Yoga, you will have to abandon all worldly enjoyments andpractise Tapas and Brahmacharya. You will have to control the mind skilfully and tactfully. Youwill have to use judicious and intelligent methods to curb it. If you use force, it will become moreturbulent and mischievous. It cannot be controlled by force. It will jump and drift away more andmore. Those who attempt to control the mind by force are like those who endeavour to bind afurious elephant with a thin silken thread.A Guru or preceptor is indispensable for the practice of Yoga. The aspirant in the path ofYoga should be humble, simple, gentle, refined, tolerant, merciful and kind. If you have a curiosityto get psychic powers, you cannot have success in Yoga. Yoga does not consist in sittingcross-legged for six hours or stopping the pulse or beatings of the heart or getting oneself buriedunderneath the ground for a week or a month.Self-sufficiency, impertinence, pride, luxury, name, fame, self-assertive nature, obstinacy,idea of superiority, sensual desires, evil company, laziness, overeating, overwork, too much mixingand too much talking are some of the obstacles in the path of Yoga.

God is the Inner Ruler. Hedirects the body, mind and senses to work. Become an instrument in the hands of the Lord. Do notexpect thanks or appreciation for your work. Do actions as your duty and offer them and their fruitsto the Lord. You will be freed from the bonds of Karma. It is not the Karma but the selfish motivethat binds the man.Never, never say, ìI have helped that man.î Feel and think, ìThat man gave me anopportunity to serve. This piece of service has helped me to purify my mind. I am extremelygrateful to him.î If you see a poor man clad in rags standing in front of your door, feel that the Lordis before you in the form of a poor man. Serve him with Narayana Bhava.Never grumble when you do service to others. Take delight in service. Watch foropportunities, to serve. Never miss even a single opportunity. Work is worship of the Lord.A Karma Yogi should have an amiable, loving, social nature. He should have sympathy,adaptability, self-restraint, tolerance, love and mercy. He should adjust himself to the ways andhabits of others. He should be able to bear insult, harsh words, criticism, pleasure and pain, heat andcold.You can do selfless service according to your ability and station in life. An advocate canplead for poor people without accepting fees. A doctor can treat the poor free of charge. A teacher orprofessor can give free tution to poor boys. He can supply them books for study.Have a medicine-chest of 12 tissue remedies or some allopathic medicines or homoeopathicmedicines. Serve the poor and sick with Atma Bhava. Give one-tenth of your income in charity.This is the highest Yoga.Do not make any difference between menial and respectable work. If any one is sufferingfrom acute-pain in any part of the body, at once shampoo the affected part very gently. Feel that youare serving the Lord in the body of the patient. Repeat your Ishtamantra also. If you see a man oranimal bleeding on the roadside, never hesitate to tear your upper cloth or shirt and use it forbandaging, in the absence of any other means of bandage. Do not bargain with the poor porters atthe railway station. Be liberal and generous. Keep always some small coins in your pocket anddistribute them to the poor and the decrepit.2ESSENCE OF YOGA"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Karma Yoga prepares the mind for the reception of light and knowledge.

Trataka, standing on one leg, (a kindof Tapas) and similar poses are all Hatha Yoga practices. Hatha Yoga is inseparable from RajaYoga. Raja Yoga begins where Hatha Yoga ends. Raja Yoga and Hatha Yoga are interdependent.Raja Yoga and Hatha Yoga are the necessary counterparts of each other. No one can become aperfect Yogi without a knowledge and practice of both the Yogas. Hatha Yoga prepares the studentto take up Raja Yoga.A Hatha Yogi starts his Sadhana with body and Prana; a Raja Yogi starts his Sadhana withhis mind; a Jnana Yogi starts his Sadhana with Buddhi or intellect and will.A Hatha Yogi gets Siddhis (psychic powers) by uniting Prana and Apana and by taking theunited Prana-Apana through the six Chakras (centres of spiritual energy) to Sahasrara at the crownof the head. A Raja Yogi gets Siddhis by Samyama, i.e., combined practice of Dharana, Dhyana andSamadhi at one time. A Jnana Yogi exhibits Siddhis through pure will or Sat-Sankalpa. A Bhaktagets Siddhis through self-surrender and the consequent descent of grace. Kriyas, viz., Neti, Dhauti,Nauli, Basti, Tratak and Kapalabhati belong to Hatha Yoga. All need not practise these Kriyas.Those who have got much phlegm in the body should practise these Kriyas. Learn these under anexpert Hatha Yogi. Hatha Yoga is not the goal.

Children beget children. The laws of health are ignored and neglected. Thenation is suffering and dying.

It is the primordial energy that lies at the basal Muladhara Chakra in a dormant,potential state. Kundalini Yoga is that Yoga which treats of Kundalini Sakti, the seven Chakras orcentres of spiritual energy, the arousing of the sleeping Kundalini Sakti and its union with Lord Sivain Sahasrara Chakra at the crown of the head. The seven Chakras are pierced by the passing ofKundalini Sakti to the top of the head.The seven Chakras are: Muladhara (at the anus), Svadhishthana (at the root of the organ ofgeneration), Manipura (at the navel), Anahata (in the heart), Visuddha (in the neck), Ajna (in thespace between the two eyebrows) and Sahasrara (at the crown of the head).Nadis are the astral tubes that carry Pranic currents. They cannot be seen by naked eyes.They are not the ordinary nerves, arteries and veins. There are 72,000 Nadis. Among them three areimportant. They are Ida, Pingala and Sushumna. Sushumna is the most important one, becauseKundalini passes through this Nadi only. The first step in Kundalini Yoga is the purification ofNadis. When Sushumna is pure then only Kundalini will pass through it. Purification of Nadis isdone by the practice of Pranayama.The Yogi opens the mouth of Sushumna Nadi through Pranayama, Bandhas and Mudrasand awakens the sleeping Kundalini and takes Her to Sahasrara at the crown of the head through thelower six Chakras. Kundalini sleeps in the Muladhara in 3Ω coils. The three coils represent thethree Gunas and half coil represents the Vikritis.5YOGA"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Kundalini is awakened through Pranayama, Asanas and Mudras by Hatha Yogins, throughconcentration by Raja Yogins, through devotion and perfect self-surrender by Bhaktas or devotees;through analytical will, by the Jnanis; by Japa of Mantra and by the grace of the Guru.If you are pure and free from all desires, Kundalini will awaken by itself and you will bebenefited. If you awaken Kundalini by violent methods, forcibly, when your heart is impure, whendesires lurk in your mind, you will come across temptations of various sorts, when you move fromplane to plane, you will have a downfall. You will have no strength of will to resist thesetemptations.That aspirant who has firm faith in Yogic Sastras, who is courageous, devotional, humble,generous, merciful, pure and dispassionate, can easily awaken Kundalini and attain success inSamadhi. He should also be equipped with right conduct and self-restraint; he should constantlyengage himself in the service of his Guru and be free from lust, anger, Moha, greed and vanity.When Kundalini is taken to the Sahasrara, when She is united with Lord Siva, perfectSamadhi (super-conscious blissful state) ensues. The Yogi drinks the nectar of immortality.May Mother Kundalini guide you all in your Yogic practices ! May Her blessings be uponyou all!RAJA YOGARaja Yoga is an exact science. It aims at controlling all thought-waves or mentalmodifications. It concerns with the mind, its purification and control. Hence it is called Raja Yoga,i.e., king of all Yogas. It is otherwise known as Ashtanga Yoga i.e., Yoga with eight limbs.The eight limbs of Ashtanga Yoga are: Yama (self-restraint), Niyama (religiousobservances), Asana (posture), Pranayama (restraint of breath), Pratyahara (abstraction of senses),Dharana (concentration), Dhyana (meditation) and Samadhi (super-conscious state). Yama ispractice of Ahimsa (non-injury), Satya (truthfulness), Asteya (non-stealing), Brahmacharya(celibacy) and Aparigraha (non-covetousness) in thought, word and deed. This is the foundation ofYoga. Niyama is observance of the five canons viz., Saucha (internal and external purity), Santosha(contentment), Tapas (austerity). Svadhyaya (study of religious books and repetition of Mantras)and Ishvara-Pranidhana (worship of God and self-surrender). Cultivate Maitri (friendship withequals), Karuna (mercy towards inferiors), Mudita (complaisancy towards superiors), Upeksha(indifference towards wicked people). You can eradicate jealousy and hatred and attain peace ofmind. Ascend the ladder of Yoga patiently through its different rungs and attain the highest summitof the ladder, i.e., Asamprajnata Samadhi, wherein all Samskaras (impressions) which bring aboutsuccessive births are absolutely fried up.If you really aspire to unfold the lurking divinity within, if you really want to get rid of themeshes of this Samsara, you must know the technique of thought-control which is embodied in thesystem of Raja Yoga. You must know the ways of right living, right thinking, right speaking andright acting. You must practise the five rules of Yama or right conduct or Sadachara. You mustknow how to withdraw the mind from external objects and fix it on one point. You must know the6ESSENCE OF YOGA"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"right method of concentration and meditation.

It is through mind only that Brahman or the Supreme Self manifests asthe differentiated universe with heterogeneous objects.Mind is nothing but a collection of Samskaras or impressions. It is nothing but a bundle ofhabits. The true nature of the mind consists in the Vasanas or subtle desires. The idea of ëIí oregoism is the seed of the tree of mind. The sprout which springs up from this seed egoism is Buddhior intellect. From this sprout the ramifying branches called Sankalpas take their origin.Mind is made up of subtle Sattvic matter. According to Chhandogya Upanishad, mind isformed out of the subtlest portion of food.Mind is of two kinds, viz., the Asuddha or impure mind and the Suddha or pure mind. Theformer leads to bondage while the latter helps the aspirant to attain liberation.Manolaya or temporary absorption of the mind in the object of meditation will not help youto attain liberation. Manonasa or annihilation of the mind only will enable you to achieve the finalemancipation or Moksha.Have no longing for objects. Reduce your wants. Cultivate Vairagya or dispassion.Vairagya thins out the mind.Do not mix much. Do not talk much. Do not walk much. Do not eat much. Do not sleepmuch.Control your emotion. Abandon desires and Vasanas. Control irritability and lust. Slay theimpure mind through the pure mind and transcend the pure mind through meditation. Practiseperfect Brahmacharya. There is no half measure in the spiritual path.Never wrestle with the mind. Do not use any violent effort in concentration. When the mindis jumping and wandering much, make no violent effort to control it but rather allow it to run alongfor a while and exhaust its efforts. It will take advantage of the opportunity and will jump aroundlike an unchained monkey at first.

Give your whole heart, mind and soul when youserve. This is very important when you practise Karma Yoga.Some people have their body in one place, mind in another place, and soul in another place.That is the reason why they do not realise any substantial progress in the path.Forget not the goal of life amidst selfish activities. The goal of life is Self-realisation. Areyou attempting to reach the end and aim of life? Are you doing Japa, Pranayama and Meditation?Have you kept up the ideal before the mindís eye? That day in which you do not practise anyspiritual Sadhana is wasted. Give the mind to God and the hands to work. You will have to analyseand scrutinise your motives. It is the selfish motive and not the work itself that binds a man toSamsara. Prepare the mind for Karma Yoga. Mere selfish work cannot be taken as Yogic activity.The mind is so framed that it always expects something for a small piece of work. When you smileyou expect a return of smile from your friend. When you raise your hand in salutation, you willexpect a salute from other people. Even when you give a cup of water to another man, you expecthim to be grateful to you. When such is the case, how can you perform Nishkama Karma Yoga?Life is very precious. Live in the spirit of the Gita teaching and work without expectation offruits and egoism. Think you are Nimitta in the hands of Lord Narayana. If you work with thismental attitude you will become a Yogi soon. Work never degrades a man. Unselfish work is Pujaof Narayana. Work is worship. All works are sacred. There is no menial work from the highestview-point of the absolute, from the view-point of Karma Yoga. Even scavenging when done withthe right spirit and mental attitude is Yogic action. Even a scavenger can realise God in his ownstation of life by service. The famous butcher-Sadhaka of the Mahahharata realised God in hismeat-shop (through serving his parents). You have got inside all materials for wisdom. There is avast magazine of power and knowledge within you. It wants kindling. Now wake up, O Saumya!When you work disinterestedly without any agency and when you surrender the works andfruits as Ishvararpana, all Karmas are transformed into Yogic Kriyas. Walking, eating, sleeping,answering the calls of nature, talking, etc., become offering unto the Lord. Every bit of work isYoga for you. Think that Lord Siva is working through your hands, and is eating through yourmouth. Think that your hands are the hands of Lord Siva. In the beginning some of your actions maybe selfish and some may be unselfish. In the long run you can do all actions in an unselfish manner.Scrutinise your motives always. This is the key-note for Nishkama Karma Yoga. Every act can bespiritualised when the motive becomes pure. Work is meditation. Serve everyone with intense love,without any idea of agency, without expectation of fruits or reward. If you adopt the path of Jnana,feel you are a silent Sakshi and the Prakriti does everything.9KARMA YOGA"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"It is selfishness that has deplorably contracted your heart. Selfishness is the bane of society.Selfishness clouds understanding. Selfishness is petty-mindedness. Bhoga increases selfishnessand selfish Pravritti. It is the root-cause for human sufferings.

The Lord is seated in the hearts of all.The spirit of service must deeply enter into your very bones, cells, tissues, nerves, etc. Thereward is invaluable. Practise and feel the cosmic expansion and infinite Ananda. Tall tales and idlegossip will not do, my dear friends! Evince intense zeal and enthusiasm in work. Be fiery in thespirit of service.Have Nishtha with God and Cheshta with hands like the Bahurupi who has the Nishtha of amale and the Cheshta of a female. You will be able to do two things at a time by practice. Themanual work will become automatic, mechanical or intuitive. You will have two minds. A portionof the mind will be at work; three quarters of the mind will be in the service of the Lord, inmeditation, in Japa. Karma Yoga is generally combined with Bhakti Yoga. A Karma Yogin offersto the Lord as an oblation whatever he does through the Karma-Indriyas. This is IshvaraPranidhana.TRAINING OF KARMA YOGAA raw untrained aspirant feels, ìMy preceptor is treating me like a servant or a peon. He isusing me for petty jobs.î He who has understood the right significance of Karma Yoga will takeevery work as Yogic activity or worship of the Lord. There is no menial work in his vision. Everywork is Puja of Narayana. In the light of Karma Yoga all actions are sacred. That aspirant whoalways takes immense delight in doing works which are considered by the worldly man as menialservices, and who always does willingly such acts only will become a dynamic Yogi. He will beabsolutely free from conceit and egoism. He will have no downfall. The canker of pride cannottouch him.Study the autobiography of Mahatma Gandhiji. He never made any difference betweenmenial service and dignified work. Scavenging and cleaning of the latrine was the highest Yoga forhim. This was the highest Puja for him. He himself did the cleaning of latrines. He annihilated theillusory little ëIí through service of various sorts. Many highly educated persons joined his Ashramfor learning Yoga under him. They thought that Gandhiji would teach them Yoga in somemysterious manner in a private room and would give lessons on Pranayama, meditation, abstration,awakening of Kundalini, etc. They were disappointed when they were asked to clean the latrinefirst. They left the Ashram immediately. Gandhiji himself repaired his shoes. He himself used togrind flour and take upon his shoulders the work of others also when they were unable to do theirallotted portion of work for the day in the Ashram. When an educated person, a new Ashramite, feltshy to do the grinding work, Gandhiji himself would do his work in front of him and then the manwould do the work himself from the next day willingly.In the West, cobblers and peasants have risen to a very great position in society. Every workis a respectable work for them.

He studies books, works hard, never wastes a minute andin a few years becomes a journalist of great repute and international fame. In Punjab some graduateshave taken to hair-dressing work. They have understood the dignity of labour.A real Yogi does not make any difference between menial and respectable work. It is onlyan ignorant man who makes such a difference. Some aspirants are humble in the beginning of theirspiritual career. When they get some name and fame, some followers, admirers, devotees anddisciples, they become victims to pride.They cannot do any service. They cannot carry anything on their heads or hands. That Yogiwho carries the trunk on his head without the slightest feeling in the railway platform amidst amultitude of his admirers, disciples and devotees, without making any outward show of humilitymust be adored. Sage Jada Bharata carried the palanquin of King Rahugana on his shoulderswithout murmuring. Lord Krishna shampooed the legs of a Raja when his barber devotee was onleave. Sri Rama carried a pot of water for the ablution of one of his devotees. Sri Krishna took theform of a menial servant as Vithoo and paid the money to the Nawab on behalf of his devotee,Dhamaji. If you really want to grow in the spiritual path you must do all sorts of service daily till theend of life. Then only you are safe. Do not stop doing service when you have become a famousYogi. The spirit of service must enter every nerve, cell, tissue and bone of your body. It must beingrained in you. Then only you will become a real fullblown practical Vedantin.Is there any greater Vedantin or Karma Yogi than Lord Buddha? He still lives in our hearts,because the spirit of service was ingrained in him and he spent his whole life in serving others in avariety of ways. A magnanimous soul, one without a second! You can also become a Buddha if youapply yourself diligently to selfless service with the right mental attitude.ATTAIN NIRLIPTA STATELord Krishna says in His Gita:ëTasmat Sarveshu kaleshu mam anusmara yudhya cha\".ìTherefore at all times think of Me and fight.î Give the mind to God and the hand to work. Thetypist works at the machine and talks with his friends. The player on the harmonium plays on theorgan and talks and jokes with his friends. The lady knits and talks with her comrades. The mind ofthe girl who has a water-pot on her head is on the water-pot, though she is talking and joking withher companions while she is walking on the road. A nurse while she is nursing the baby of anotherlady has her mind rivetted on her own baby. A cowherd while he is looking after the cows of otherpeople has his mind fixed on his own cow. Even so, have your mind fixed at the lotus feet of theLord, while you are doing your household duties and office work. You will realiseSelf-consciousness quickly. Just as the water remains unaffected in the lotus leaf, just as the oilfloats upon the surface of the water without being affected in any way, so also you should remain inthe world amidst troubles, pleasures and difficulties.Just as the tongue is not affected by taking ghee, so also you should remain unaffected evenamidst worldly activities and troubles. You must keep up the Nirlipta state. This is Jnana. This isbalance (Samata). You may fail to keep the balance and Nirlipta state in thousand and one times.But in the long run you are bound to succeed if you persist in your practice and if you discipline themind properly. Every failure is a pillar for future success. Remember this point well.11KARMA YOGA"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"A Karma Yogin should not expect even return of love, appreciation, gratitude, andadmiration from the people whom he is serving.Only he who has reduced his wants and controlled the Indriyas can do Karma Yoga.

You must be free from Raga and Dvesha. ìAn action which is ordained, done by oneundesirous of fruit, devoid of attachment, without love or hate, is called pureî. (Gita XVIII-23).WHAT IS KARMAKarma means work or action. According to Jaimini, rituals like Agnihotra, Yajnas, etc., aretermed Karmas. There is a hidden power in Karma termed Adrishta which brings in fruits ofKarmas for the individual. Karma is all for Jaimini. Karma is everything for a student of Mimamsaschool of thought. Jaimini is the founder of Purva Mimamsa. He was a student of Maharshi Vyasa,the founder of Uttara Mimamsa or Vedanta. The Mimamsa school denies the existence of Ishvarawho awards the fruits of works.According to the Gita, any action is Karma. Charity, sacrifice, Tapas are all Karmas. In aphilosophical sense, breathing, seeing, hearing, tasting, feeling, smelling, walking, talking, etc., areall Karmas. Thinking is the real Karma. Raga-Dvesha constitute the real Karma.HOW TO FIND RIGHT OR WRONG ACTIONHave right thinking. Use your reason and commonsense. Follow the injunctions of theSastras. Consult the code of Manu or Yajnavalkya Smriti whenever you have doubts. You will beable to find out whether you are doing right or wrong action. If you say, ëSastras are countless. Theyare like ocean. I can hardly understand the truths that are inculcated. I cannot fathom and gaugetheir depths. There are contradictions. I am puzzled and bewildered.í Then strictly follow the wordsof a Guru on whom you have absolute faith and confidence. The third way is: Have fear in God.Consult your conscience. The shrill, inner voice will guide you. As soon as you hear the voice, donot delay even a moment. Start the action diligently without consulting anybody. Practise to hearthe inner voice in the morning at four. If there is fear, shame, doubt or pricking of conscience, knowthat you are doing a wrong action. If there is joy, exhilaration or satisfaction, understand that youare doing the right action.INNER VOICEWhen the diverse, confining sheaths of the Atma have been dissolved by Sadhana, when thedifferent Vrittis of the mind have been controlled by mental drill or gymnastic, when the consciousmind is not active, you enter the realm of spirit life, the super-conscious mind where Buddhi andpure reason and intuition, the faculty of direct cognition of Truth, manifest.

But it is possible to infer the existence from certainempirical factors. The existence of Brahman is known from the fact of its being the SELF ofeveryone. For everyone is conscious of the existence of his self and never thinks ìI am not.î If theexistence of his self were not known, everyone would think: ìI am not.î This self, of whoseexistence all are conscious, is Brahman. There is an inherent feeling in everybody: ìI existóAhamAsmi.îYou dream sometimes that you are dead and that your relatives are weeping. Even in thatsupposed death state, you see and hear them weeping. This clearly indicates that, even after theapparent death, life really persists. You exist even after the physical sheath is thrown out. Thatexistence is Atman or Brahman or the Supreme Self.Close your eyes and imagine for a moment that you are dead. You can never do so. You cannever think that you will not exist after death. You will imagine that your dead body is lying flat and13KARMA YOGA"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"that you are witnessing the dead body. This definitely proves that you are always the witnessingsubject or Sakshi.When you are in the dark, when you are behind a veil, if anybody enquires: ëWho is there?í,you will unhesitatingly answer: ëIt is Ií. If he again asks you: ëWho is there?í you will say: ëI am Soand So.í This ëI am So and Soí is a mental Kalpnana or false superimposition on account ofignorance. At first you have expressed spontaneously your inherent feeling of existence, the biginfinite ëIí. Nothing can resist this innate feeling of ëAham Asmi.íBy whose command are the earth and the sky, the sun and the moon, upheld in their places?By whose command do the seas not overstep their limits? By whose command does the sun risepunctually in the morning and set in the evening? By whose command do the seasons, solstices andthe years not transgress? By whose command do Karmas and their performers and their fruits notlikewise go beyond their appointed time? It is by the command of Brahmanóthe Inner Ruler,Controller and Governor.What is common in trees, ants, birds, stones and man? Existence. A tree exists. A birdexists. A stone exists. A man exists. Existence is Brahman.Some are rich, some are poor. Some are healthy, some are born blind. Some die at eighty,some die at ten. What is the cause for this variation? This clearly proves the theory of Karma thatthere is one Omniscient Lord, who is the dispenser of fruits of actions of human beings, who fixesthe span of life in accordance with the nature of their actions, who knows the exact relation betweenKarmas and their fruits. Karma is Jada or insentient. It certainly cannot dispense the fruits of theactions.In sleep there are no senses, no objects, no mind and yet you experience the highest bliss.Wherefrom have you derived the bliss? The mind rests in Brahman during sleep and it is fromBrahman that this Bliss is derived.Cogito, ergo sumó\"I think, therefore, I am.\" This is Descartesís fundamental basis ofphilosophy. Sri Sankara says: ìThis Atman cannot be illusive, for, he who would deny it, witnessesits reality even in denying it.îPOWER OF PRAYERPrayer elevates the mind. It fills the mind with purity. It is associated with praise of God. Itkeeps the mind in tune with God. Prayer can reach a realm where reason dare not enter. Prayer canmove mountains. It can work miracles. It frees the devotee from the fear of death, brings him nearerto God and makes him feel the divine presence everywhere. It awakens in him the divineconsciousness and makes him feel his essential immortal and blissful nature.It was the prayer of Prahlada that rendered cool the burning oil when it was poured on hishead. It was the prayer of Mira that converted the bed of nails into a bed of roses and the cobra into aflower-garland.14ESSENCE OF YOGA"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Prayer has tremendous influence. Mahatma Gandhi was a great votary of prayer. If theprayer is sincere and if it proceeds from the bottom of your heart (Antarika), it will at once melt theheart of the Lord. Sri Krishna had to run bare-footed from Dvaraka on hearing the heart-felt prayerof Draupadi. You all know this. Lord Hari, the mighty ruler of this universe, apologised beforePrahlada for coming a little late when the latter prayed. How merciful and loving is the Lord!Say even once from the bottom of your heart: ìO Lord, I am thine. Thy will be done. Havemercy on me. I am Thy servant and devotee. Forgive. Guide. Protect. Enlighten. Trahi.Prachodayat.î Have a meek, receptive attitude of mind. Have Bhava in your heart. The prayer is atonce heard and responded to. Do this in the daily battle of life and realise yourself the high efficacyof prayer. You must have strong Astikya-Buddhi (strong conviction in the existence of God).Christians have different prayers for getting various gifts and bounties from God.Mohammedans and all religionists have daily prayers at sunrise, noon, sunset, just before retiring tobed, just before taking food. Prayer is the beginning of Yoga. Prayer is the first important Anga(limb) of Yoga. Preliminary spiritual Sadhana or practice is prayer.God helps even a dacoit when he prays. Pray to God for purity, devotion, light andknowledge. You will get these things. Get up early in the morning and repeat some prayers forgetting mental and physical Brahmacharya. Pray in any manner you like. Become as simple as achild. Open freely the chambers of your heart. Sincere Bhaktas know pretty well about the highefficacy of prayers. Narada Muni is still praying. Nama Deva prayed and Vittal came out of theimage to eat his food. Ekanath prayed. Lord Hari showed His Chaturbhuj form. Sri Krishna servedDamaji as a servant when he prayed; He played the part of a menial in paying his dues to theBadshah. What more do you want? Pray fervently right now from this very second. Do not delay,friend. That ëto-morrowí will never come.The power of prayer is indescribable. Its glory is ineffable. Only sincere devotees realise itsusefulness and splendour. It should be done with reverence, faith and Nishkama-Bhava(non-expectation of fruits), and with a heart wet with devotion. O ignorant man! Do not argue aboutthe efficacy of prayer. You will be deluded. There is no arguing in spiritual matters. Intellect is afinite and a frail instrument. Do not trust this. Remove now the darkness of your ignorance throughthe light of prayer.BHAKTI YOGAThe term ëBhaktií comes from the root ëBhají which means ëto be attached to God.í Bhaktiis the form of supreme love towards God.

It is pure unselfish love or Suddha Prem. It is the sacred higheremotion with sublime sentiments that unites the devotee with the Lord. It has to be experienced bythe devotees.Bhakti is the basis of all religious life. Bhakti destroys Vasanas and egoism. Bhakti elevatesthe mind to magnanimous heights.

Tukaram, Prahlada, Valmiki, Dhruva and several others attained salvationby Japa alone. Sri Krishna says in the Gita,ìYajnanam Japa-Yajnosmiî.Among the Yajnas, I amJapa Yajna (Yaga)\".There are three kinds of Japa,viz., verbal or loud Japa (Vaikhari), semi-verbal Japa orhumming(Upamsu), and mental Japa or silent repetition through mind (Mansic). Mental Japa ismore powerful. It gives a reward ten thousand times more than the loud Japa. When the mindwanders aimlessly take to loud Japa.Japa must become habitual. It must be done with Sattvic or divine Bhava or feeling, purity,Prema and Sraddha. There is an indescribable power or Achintya Sakti in the names of God orMantra. Every name is filled with countless Saktis or potencies.Practice of Japa removes the impurities of the mind, just as soap cleanses the cloth of itsimpurities. Be regular in your Japa. Japa destroys the sins and brings the devotee face to face withGod.The name of God chanted correctly or incorrectly, knowingly or unknowingly, carefully orcarelessly, with Bhava or without Bhava is sure to give the desired fruit. The Bhava will come byitself after some time. Get up at 4 a.m. and do the Japa for two hours. You will get the maximumbenefits.The glory of the name of God cannot be established through reasoning and intellect.

This is the easiestmethod for attaining God-consciousness in Kali Yuga or the Iron AgeìKalau Kesava-Kirtanatî.When several people join together and practise Sankirtan, a huge spiritual current orMahasakti is generated. This purifies the heart of the aspirants and elevates them to the sublimeheights of divine ecstasy or Samadhi. The powerful vibrations are carried to distant places. Theybring elevation of mind, solace, strength to all people and work as a harbinger of peace, harmonyand concord. They annihilate hostile forces and quickly bring peace and bliss to the whole world.Lord Hari says to Narada,ìNaham Vasami Vaikunthe Yoginam Hridaye na cha,Mad-Bhakta Yatra Gayanti Tatra Tishthami Naradaî,i.e., ìI dwell not in Vaikuntha nor in thehearts of the Yogins, but I dwell where my devotees sing my name, O Narada.îKirtan destroys sins, Vasanas and Samskaras, fills the heart with Prem and devotion andbrings the devotee face to face with God.Akhanda Kirtan is very powerful.

Prana is above matter but belowmind. Prana is positive to matter but negative to mind. Mind is positive to both Prana and matter butnegative to will. Will is the centre of the ego. Will is the General-in-chief which directs the mindand Prana to all parts and in all directions. Intuition is above reason and is the channel ofcommunication between man and spirit. Development of the Will-power by autosuggestion is thebasic principle of Raja Yoga or Vedanta. Superconscious Mind is the realm or Spirit of Life.METAPHYSICS OF THE INNER MANThe Physical body, the astral body, Prana, intellect or Buddhi, the instinctive mind, thespiritual mind and the spirit are the seven principles of man. Buddhi is pure reason. The seat ofBuddhi is just below the crown of the head in the pineal gland of the brain. Buddhi is manifestedonly in those persons who have developed right intuitive discrimination or Viveka. The ordinaryreason of the worldly people is termed practical reason, which is dense and has limitations.Prana is the vital force, life-energy or Jiva-Sakti. It is the eternal symbol of God or Brahman.It is Hiranyagarbha or Golden Son of God. It is the link between the astral and physical bodies.20ESSENCE OF YOGA"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Prana is divided into physical Prana and psychic Prana.

Get this Saktióyou will get Sat or Existence.Chitta is the subconscious mind. It has two layers. One layer for emotion and the other forpassive memory. The instinctive mind is the lower nature of human beings. It is the desire mind orKama Manas. The Spiritual mind is the higher Manas. The seat of the mind is the heart. The mindconnected to the Somachakra of the lowermost portion or undersurface of the brain is termed theorgan of understanding.

You can annihilate Dvesha by Pratipaksha Bhavana.Look to the brighter side of persons. Ignore the dark aspect.Emotion is a motive power like the steam of an engine. It helps you in your evolution. Had itnot been for the presence of emotion you would have passed into a state of passivity or inertia. Itgives a push for action or motion. It is a blessing. But you must not become a prey to emotions. Youmust not allow the emotions to rule over you. You must not allow them to bubble out. You mustpurify and calm the surging emotions. You must allow it to rise slowly and subside quietly from themind-ocean. You must keep the emotion under perfect control. Do not mistake physical sensationsfor higher sublime emotions. Do not be carried away by emotions. There are certain people wholike to hear some new sensational events just to arouse their emotions. They live on emotions,otherwise they feel quite dull. This is a great weakness. This must be eradicated if they like to have acalm, quiet life.All evil qualities proceed from anger. If you control anger, all evil qualities will vanish bythemselves.Ahamkara, Sankalpa, Vasana, Prana have intimate connection with the mind. There cannotbe any mind without these four.

The wheel stops when the Vasanas perish.Just as there are doors in a bungalow between the outer and inner rooms, so also there aredoors between the lower and higher minds. When the mind is purified by the practice of KarmaYoga, Tapas, right conduct or the practice of Yama, Niyama, Japa, meditation, etc., the doorsbetween the lower and the higher mind are opened. Discrimination between the real and the unrealdawns. The eye of intuition is opened. The practitioner gets inspiration, revelation and higherDivine Knowledge.It is extremely difficult to have a calm and pure mind.

Nothing is impossible for a Sadhaka who has iron-will and strong determination.Just as soap cleanses the physical body so also Japa of a Mantra, Dhyana, Kirtan andpractice of Yama cleanse the mind of its impurities.CHITTAThe subconscious mind is termed ìChittaî in Vedanta. Much of your subconsciousnessconsists of submerged experiences, memories-thrown into the background but recoverable.When you show symptoms of losing your memory, as you grow old, the first symptom isthat you find it difficult to remember the names of persons. The reason is not far to seek. All thenames are arbitrary. They are like labels. There are no associations along with the names. The mindgenerally remembers through associations, as the impressions become deep thereby. You canremember in old age some passages that you have read in schools and colleges. But you find itdifficult to remember in the evening a passage you have read in the morning. The reason is that themind has lost its Dharana-Sakti (power of grasping ideas). The cells have been degenerated. Thosewho overwork mentally, who do not observe the rules of Brahmacharya and who are afflicted withmuch cares, worries and anxieties, lose their power of memory soon. Even in old age you canremember old events as there are associations with events.The mental processes are limited to the field of consciousness alone. The field ofsubconscious mentation is of a much greater extent than that of conscious mentation. Messageswhen ready, come out like a flash from the subconscious mind or Chitta of the Vedantins. Only tenper cent of mental activities come into the field of the consciousness. At least ninety per cent or ourmental life is subconscious. We sit and try to solve a problem, and fail. We look around, try again22ESSENCE OF YOGA"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"and again but fail. Suddenly an idea dawns and leads to the solution of the problem. Thesubconscious processes were at work.Sometimes you go to sleep at night with the thought ìI must get up very early in the morningto catch a trainî. This message is taken up by the subconscious mind and it is this subconsciousmind that wakes you up unfailingly at the exact hour. Subconscious mind is your constantcompanion and sincere friend. You repeatedly fail at night to get a solution for a problem inArithmetic or Geometry. In the morning when you wake up you get a clear answer. This answercomes like a flash from the subconscious mind. Even in sleep it works incessantly without any rest.It arranges, classifies, compares, sorts all facts and works out a proper satisfactory solution. This isall due to subconscious mind.With the help of the subconscious mind you can change your vicious nature by cultivatinghealthy, virtuous qualities that are opposed to the undesirable ones. If you want to overcome fearmentally deny that you have fear and concentrate your attention upon the opposite quality, the idealof courage. When this is developed fear vanishes by itself. The positive always overpowers thenegative. This is an infallible law of nature. This is Pratipaksha Bhavana of the Raja Yogins. Youcan acquire a liking for distasteful tasks and duties by cultivating a desire and taste for them. Youcan establish new habits, new ideals, new ideas and new tastes and new character in thesubconscious mind by changing the old ones.The functions of Chitta are Smriti or Smarana, Dharana (retention) and Anusandhana(inquiry or investigation). When you repeat a Mantra it is the Chitta that does the Smarana. It does alot of work. It turns out better work than the mind or Buddhi.All actions, enjoyments and experiences leave their impressions in the subconscious mindin the form of subtle impressions or residual potencies. The Samskaras are the root of causing againJati, life and experiences of pleasure and pain. Revival of Samskaras induces memory. The Yogidives deep inside and comes in direct contact with these Samskaras. He directly perceives themthrough the inner Yogic Vision. By Samyama (concentration, meditation and Samadhi) on theseSamskaras, he acquires knowledge of previous lives. By doing Samyama on the Samskaras ofothers, the Yogi gets the knowledge of their past lives also.When you desire to remember a thing you will have to make a psychic exertion. You willhave to go up and down the depths of the different levels of the subconscious mind and then pick upthe right thing from a curious mixture of multifarious irrelevant matter. Just as the mail sorter in theRailway Mail Service takes up the right letter by moving the hand up and down along the differentpigeon-holes, so also the sorter in the subconscious mind goes up and down along the pigeon-holesin the subconscious mind and brings the right thing to the level of normal consciousness. Thesubconscious mind can pick the right thing out from a heap of various matters.A Samskara of an experience is formed or developed in the Chitta the very moment themind is experiencing something. There is no gap between the present experience and the formationof a Samskara in the subconscious mind.23RAJA YOGA"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Smriti of memory is the function of Chitta (subconscious mind). It is a separate faculty orcategory in Vedanta. Sometimes it is Antarangata (comes under the mind). In Sankhya philosophyit is included in Buddhi or Mahat Tattva. The Chitta of Patanjali Rishiís philosophy of Raja Yoga(Yogas Chittavritti-Nirodhah) corresponds to the Antahkarana of Vedanta.MIND AND ITS MYSTERIESJust as a busy officer works alone in a room by closing all the doors, so also the busy mindworks alone in a dream by shutting out all the doors of the senses.Mind is a power born of the soul. It is through mind that the Lord manifests Himself as thedifferentiated universe with heterogeneous objects.Mind is merely a bundle of thoughts. Of all thoughts the thought ëIí is the root. Therefore,mind is only the thought ìIî.Mind is nothing but a collection of Samskaras or impressions. It is nothing but a bundle ofhabits. It is nothing but a collection of desires arising from contact with different objects. It is also acollection of feelings aroused by worldly botherations. It is a collection of ideas gathered fromdifferent objects. Now these desires, ideas and feelings constantly change. Some of the old desiresare constantly departing from their storehouse of the mind, and new ones are replacing them.In the waking state, the seat of the mind is the brain; in the dreaming state the seat of themind is the cerebellum; in the deep sleep state it rests in the heart.Mind always attaches itself to something objective. It cannot stand by itself. It is only thismind that asserts itself as ëIí in this body.The things that we perceive all round us are only mind in form of substance.Manomatram-Jagat Manah-Kalpitam Jagat. Mind creates. Mind destroys.The occult phenomena that take place in the mental world are all based on scientific laws.Occultists and Raja Yogins should have a comprehensive intelligent understanding of these laws.Then only will they be able to control the psychic forces easily.Practice of telepathy, thought-reading, hypnotism, mesmerism, distant healing, psychichealing, etc., clearly proves that mind exists and that a higher developed mind can influence andsubjugate the lower minds. From the automatic writing and the experiences of a hypnotised person,we can clearly infer the existence of subconscious mind which operates throughout the twenty-fourhours.If an idea is planted in the mind, it grows at night through the operation of the subconsciousmind. The subconscious mind never takes any rest. It works vigorously throughout the twenty-fourhours. Those who know how to manipulate this subconscious mind can turn out tremendous mentalwork.

Subconscious mind is a wonderful undergroundmental factory.Mind is the greatest force on this earth. He who has controlled his mind is full of powers. Hecan bring all minds under his influence. All diseases can be cured by psychic healing. One is struckwith awe and wonder at the marvellous and mysterious powers of the mind of a man. The source orhome or support of this mysterious mind is God or Atman.Any action that is done by the physical body is the outcome of a preconceived idea. Themind thinks, plans and schemes at first. Then the action manifests itself. He who invented a watch atfirst had all ideas in his mind about the construction of the lever, various wheels, dial, minute-hand,second-hand, hour-hand, etc. These ideas materialised later on into actuality.A spark of light presents the appearance of a continuous circle of light if it is made to rotatequickly. Even so, though the mind can attend but to one thing at a time, either hearing or smelling,though it can admit of but one kind of sensation at a time, we are led to believe that it does severalactions at a time, because it moves from one object to another with tremendous velocity, so rapidlythat its successive attention and preception appear as a simultaneous activity.The best philosophers and seers (Rishis and sages) are unanimously agreed that the mindcannot actually attend to more than one thing at a time, but it only appears to be doing so when it isshifting with prodigious rapidity backward and forward from one end to the other.Change of thought, relaxation of mind by dwelling on thoughts of pleasant objects,cheerfulness, Sattvic food, mental recreation of Sattvic nature are necessary for mental health.The mind assumes the shape of any object it intently thinks of. If it thinks of an orange itassumes the shape of an orange. If it thinks of Lord Jesus on the Cross it assumes the shape of LordJesus on the Cross. You must train the mind properly and give it proper pure food for assimilation.Have a Divine background of thought or mental image.If all the thoughts are eliminated, then there remains nothing which can be called mind. Sothoughts are the mind. Again there is no such thing as world, independent of and apart fromthoughts. Two thoughts, however, closely related to one another, cannot exist at the same time.The mind becomes that on which it dwells. This is an immutable psychological law. If youbegin to think about the Dosha or defects of a man, for the time being at least your mind dwells onthe bad qualities and becomes charged with these qualities, whether the man possesses these badqualities or not. This may be your vain imagination only through your wrong thinking, wrongSamskaras or wrong (bad) habits of the mind. He may not possess even a bit of the bad qualitieswhich you have superimposed on him through ill-will or some form of jealousy orpetty-mindedness or habitual Dosha-Drishti or fault-finding nature. Therefore, give up thedangerous habit of censuring others and finding fault in others. Praise others. Develop the power orvision of finding only good in others. Do not bark like a wild dog about the bad qualities of others.Glorify others. You will grow spiritually. You will be liked, honoured and respected by others.25RAJA YOGA"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Deep sleep (Sushupti) is not merely a state of inactivity or passive repose. It has deepphilosophical significance. Vedantins study this state very deeply and carefully. It gives the clue fornon-dual philosophers to trace, search and find out the hidden, silent witness.Atman is ever awake, although all the minds are at rest. Mother of this world, Rajesvari,takes the Jivas back to Her and Her Lord during deep sleep, hugs them to Her bosom, bestows onthem refreshing peace, new vigour, vitality and strength and makes them quite fit for the ensuingbattle of life on the following day. But for this sleep, life would have been absolutely impossible inthis physical plane when miseries, diseases, cares, worries, fears and anxieties of various kindstrouble men every second. If a man does not get sound sleep even for one night, if he loses his sleepone night for three hours by keeping watch over a sick patient or attending the cinema, howmiserable, gloomy, depressed he feels the next day!Mind is atomic according to the Indian school of logic. It is all-pervading according to RajaYoga school of Patanjali Maharshi; it is of the middling size (same size as that of the body)according to the Vedantic school.Mind is material. Mind is made up of subtle matter. This discrimination is made on theprinciple that the soul is the only source of intelligence: it is self-evident; it shines by its own light.Mind is formed out of the subtlest portion of the food.Mind can be compared to water. Water exists in four states, viz., causal state, in the form ofhydrogen and oxygen;subtle state, in theform of water; gross state, in the form of ice: and gaseousstate,in the form of vaporised steam. Even so the mind is in a gross state during Jagrat state when itenjoys sensual objects, is in a subtle state when it functions in the dream state, is in a causal statewhen it gets involved into its cause, Mula-Avidya, during deep sleep and it evaporates as gas whenit melts or dissolves in Brahman during Nirvikalpa Samadhi.Just as the physical body is composed of solid, liquid and gaseous matter, so also the mind ismade up of subtle matter of various grades of density with different rates of vibration. A Raja Yogipenetrates through the different layers of the mind by intense practice.Just as you nourish the physical body with food, so also will you have to give food for themind and spiritual food for the soul.When your business fails, or when you are in heavy grief by the death of your only son, youget emaciation of body even though you eat nourishing, substantial food. You feel tremendousinternal weakness. This clearly proves that mind exists and cheerfulness is a good mental food.When a lady is deeply engaged in the management of the affairs of her daughterís marriage,she forgets to take her food. She is always happy. Her heart is full of joy. The joy and cheerfulnessare powerful tonics for her mind. She gets inner mental strength although she does not take anyfood.26ESSENCE OF YOGA"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"CONTROL OF MINDLife in this physical plane is a mere preparation for the eternal life of everlasting sunshineand joy which is to come when one gets knowledge of the Self through intense and constantmeditation after purifying the mind.

The mind itself takes the forms of rose, mountain, elephant,rivers, ocean, enemy, etc. Just as heat is inseparable from fire, so also fluctuation is inseparablefrom mind. It makes the mind restless. The fluctuation is caused by the power of Rajas. It is thefluctuation that causes Asanti (absence of peace of mind). The Bhaktas remove this tossing by Japa,Upasana and worship of Ishtadevata.The power of fluctuation is itself the mind. This fluctuating mind alone is this world. Themind becomes no mind if fluctuation disappears. The mind ceases to exist, if it becomes destitute ofthis fluctuation. What is called Maya is this fluctuating potency of the mind. Mind does havocsthrough the power of fluctuation. Fluctuation is Mara or Satan or Vasana or Eshana or Trishna. Itwas this fluctuation that tempted Visvamitra. It is this fluctuation that brings about the downfall of astruggling aspirant. Destroy this fluctuation through strong Viveka, constant meditation andceaseless Brahma-Vichara.As soon as fluctuation manifests itself various sorts of imaginations crop up. Imaginationco-exists with fluctuation. Imagination is as much dangerous as fluctuation. Fluctuation moves themind. Imagination fattens the mind.

Brahmacharya includes the control ofnot only the sex or reproductive Indriya but also other Indriyas. This is the definition ofBrahmacharya in a broad sense. Brahmacharya is of two kinds viz., physical and mental. Physical iscontrol of the body and mental is the control of evil thoughts. In mental Brahmacharya even alustful thought will never enter the mind. Freedom from all sexual thoughts in waking as well asdreaming states is strict Brahmacharya.The vital energy, the Veerya, which supports your life, is a great treasure for you. It is thequintessence of blood. Brahmacharya is truly a precious jewel. It is the most effective medicine ornectar which destroys diseases, decay and death. This Atma or immortal soul is verily the nature ofBrahmacharya. Atma resides in Brahmacharya.Veerya is the essence of life, thought, intelligence and consciousness. When the Veerya isonce lost, it can never be recouped in your lifetime by your taking any amount of Badam, nervinetonics, milk, cream, Makaradhvaja, etc. This fluid, when preserved carefully, serves as amaster-key for you to open the doors of elysian bliss or the realms of God or Atma and for all sortsof higher achievements in life. By Brahmacharya alone the Rishis of yore have conquered death andattained the immortal abode of joy and bliss.You cannot have health and spiritual life without Brahmacharya. Brahmacharya is thekey-note of success in every walk of life. Brahmacharya serves as a gateway for bliss beyond. Itopens the door of Moksha (emancipation). Siddhis and Riddhis (psychic powers) roll under the feetof a Brahmacharin. Who can describe the majesty and glory of a Brahmachari? Brahmacharya orspotless chastity is the best of panaceas. There is nothing in this world that cannot be attained by acelibate. He can move the whole world.Sensuality destroys life, lustre, strength, vitality, memory, wealth, fame, holiness anddevotion to the Supreme. Death is hastened by letting out vital energy from the body. Life is savedand prolonged by preserving it. Those who have lost much of their Veerya or the vital energybecome easily irritable and lazy.

Go to bed at 10 p.m., and get up at4 a.m. Napoleon Bonaparte believed in only four hours of sleep. Too much sleep makes a man dulland lethargic. Too much sleep causes premature decay and weakens the brain-power. Thosespiritual aspirants who want to do rigorous Sadhana should reduce the sleep gradually. For threemonths reduce the sleep by half an hour. During the next three months go to bed at 11 p.m., and getup at 4 a.m. In this way you can conquer sleep and become one like Arjuna or Lakshmana.3. How many Malas of Japa?Japa is an important limb of Yoga. In this Kali Yuga, Japa and Kirtan are effective Sadhanasfor God-realisation. Japa results in Samadhi or communion with God. Japa is the repetition of thename of the Lord. There are three varieties of Japa, viz., Vaikhari (verbal), Upamsu (whispering),and Manasic (mental). Have a Japa Mala (rosary) round your neck or in your pocket or underneathyour pillow at night. Use a Mala of 108 beads. A Mala is a whip to goad the mind towards God.

Satsanga elevates the mind tomagnanimous heights. Study of books written by realised persons will also be tantamount toSatsanga.10. How many hours did you observe Mouna?Monna means vow of silence. Energy is wasted in idle talking and gossiping. Mounadevelops will-power. Mouna checks the impulse of speech. It is a great help for the observance oftruth and control of anger. Emotions are controlled and irritability vanishes. Observe Mouna at leastfor one hour or two hours a day. During Mouna, sublime thoughts should replace worldly thoughtsand Japa should be done.11. How long in disinterested selfless service?The practice of Nishkama Karma Yoga destroys sins and impurities of the mind and causesChitta Suddhi or purity of Antahkarana. Knowledge of Self dawns in a pure mind. Knowledge ofSelf is the only direct means to freedom. Nishkama Karma Yoga is selfless service to humanity.The important point is to serve humanity without any attachment or egoism. The central teaching ofthe Gita is non-attachment to work. Sri Krishna says: ìWork incessantly. Your duty is to work butnot to expect the fruits thereof.î Do vigorous service for some time. You will grasp the spirit ofNishkama Karma.12. How much did you give in charity?When you walk along the road or street, keep always some loose coins in your pocket anddistribute them to the poor. Be liberal. Feel that you are enjoying in all the bodies. Your heart willexpand. You will begin to realise unity or oneness. You will become more generous. Do regularcharity of one tenth of your income. Performance of virtuous actions is the beginning of spirituallife.13. How many Mantras did you write?Maintain a Mantra notebook. Write your Ishta Mantra, Guru Mantra or Maha Mantra forhalf an hour in this notebook. You should preferably do this item of Sadhana just before the48ESSENCE OF YOGA"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"commencement of the household duties. You should observe Mouna or silence while writing theMantra. There should be perfect calm and quietude. You should concentrate on the writing alone. InMantra writing, the eyes, the hands and the mind are all engaged. There is no restriction oflanguage. If this practice is continued with sincerity, the aspirant gets concentration easily andmuch internal peace and happiness.14. How long did you practise physical exercise?Physical culture or the development of the body is as much important as the development ofthe mind, will, or memory. If the body is not kept strong and healthy, vigorous and active, no cultureis possible.ìMens sana in corpore sanoîis a wise saying which meansóa sound mind in a soundbody. There are different kinds of physical culture. You will have to select one according to yourcapacity, taste and temperament.15.How many lies did you tell and with what Self-punishment?Srutis emphatically declare:ìSatyam VadaóSpeak the Truthî.ìSatyameva JayateNanritamóTruth alone triumphs but not falsehoodî. A truthful man is absolutely free fromworries and anxieties. He has a calm mind. He is respected by all. If you observe speaking the truthfor twelve years, you will have Vak-Siddhi. Then whatever you speak will come to pass. Speak thetruth. Truth is Knowledge. Truth is Bliss. Truth guides you in all your actions. Write in bold typesthe words: ìSpeak Truthî on cardboards and hang them in different places in your house. This willremind you when you speak a lie. You will check yourself at once. Punish yourself by fasting if youtell a lie and record the lies in the diary. Gradually the number of lies will decrease and you willbecome a truthful man.16.How many times and how long of anger and with what self-punishment?Anger is an enemy to peace. It is a modification of lust. When a desire is not gratified, a manbecomes angry. He loses his memory and understanding. Control anger by the practice of Kshama,love and killing egoism. Drink a little water when you become angry. It will cool the brain and calmthe excited nerves. Repeat ìOm Santiî several times. If you find it extremely difficult to controlanger, leave the place immediately and take a walk for half an hour. Pray to God. Do Japa.Meditation gives immense strength to destroy anger and other obstacles.17.How many hours did you spend in useless company?The so-called friends are real enemies. You cannot find even a single unselfish friend in thisuniverse. Be careful. Friends come to have idle talks with you and they waste your time. They wantto pull you down and make you also worldly. Do not be carried away by the flowery speech of suchfriends. Cut off connections ruthlessly. Live alone at all times. Trust in that immortal friend whodwells in your heart. If you cannot have positive Satsanga of Mahatmas, have indirect Satsangawith books written by realised Sages, Saints and Bhagavatas.49SPIRITUAL SADHANA"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"18. How many times did you fail in Brahmacharya?No spiritual progress is possible without the practice of celibacy. Veerya is a dynamic force.It should be converted into Ojas-Sakti. Those who are very eager to have God-realisation shouldobserve unbroken celibacy strictly. Observe the vow of Brahmacharya strictly.19. How long in study of religious books?Be regular in the study of religious books, Ramayana, Bhagavata, Yoga Vasishtha and othergood books, for Svadhyaya. If you reflect on the ideas of Gita and fix the mind on these ideas, thisitself is a form of lower Samadhi. Svadhyaya is an auxiliary for concentration. Svadhyaya willcheck mind-wandering also.20.How many times did you fail in the control of evil habits and with what self-punishment?There are some who are unconscious of their bad habits and many who do not recognisethem as bad. If they recognise them to be bad, then the correction is very simple. Alcohol is a strongdevil, which if once enters the system of a man will never leave him. Then comes, smoking.Another evil habit is betel-chewing. Drinking of strong tea and coffee often develops a bad habit.Novel reading, visiting cinemas, sleeping in the daytime, using slang terms and abuses, etc., aresome of the evil habits. First realise that you have got an evil habit and intensely desire that youshould give it up at any cost. Then your success has already come. Giving up any bad habit at once isbetter. Use your subconscious mind for eradication. Establish new healthy habits and develop yourwill. There is nothing impossible under the Sun.21.How long you did concentrate on your Ishta Devata (Saguna or Nirguna Dhyana)?Concentration can be done only if you are free from all distractions. Concentrate onanything that appeals to you as good or anything which the mind likes best. The mind should betrained to concentrate on gross objects in the beginning and, later on, you can successfullyconcentrate on subtle objects and abstract ideas. Regularity in the practice is of paramountimportance.Gross Forms: Concentrate on a black dot on the wall or a candle-flame, a bright star, moon,on the picture of Om, Lord Siva, Rama, Krishna, Devi, or your Ishta Devata in front of you withopen eyes.Subtle Forms: Sit before the picture of your Ishta Devata and close your eyes. Keep a mentalpicture of your Ishta Devata at the space between the two eyebrows, or heart (Anahata Chakra);concentrate on Muladhara, Anahata, Ajna or any other internal Chakra; concentrate on the divinequalities such as love, mercy, or any other abstract ideas, Sat Chit Ananda, purity, perfection, peace.22.How many days did you observe fast and vigil?Keeping wide awake throughout the night is called vigil. You will derive incalculablebenefit if you practise vigil on Vaikuntha-Ekadasi, Sivaratri, Gokulashtami day (the birthday of Sri50ESSENCE OF YOGA"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Krishna). Complete fasting helps to control the sleep. Control of sleep by taking recourse to tea isnot desirable. You will not gain spiritual strength as you depend upon an extraneous drug. Duringfasting avoid company. Live alone. Utilise your time in Yogic Sadhana. After a fast, do not take anyheavy food. Milk or some fruit-juice is beneficial.23. Were you regular in your meditation?Never miss a day in meditation. Be regular and systematic. Regularity in meditation is ofparamount importance. The meditative state will come by itself at the appointed time. Take Sattvicfood. Fruits and milk will help mental focussing. When the mind is tired, do not concentrate. Give ita little rest.24. What virtues are you developing?Develop that virtue in which you are hopelessly lacking. Courage, mercy, universal love,nobility, Kshama, contentment, frankness and honesty must be developed one by one. Take up onevirtue every month and meditate on that virtue regularly. You will manifest that virtue in yourcharacter. If you develop one important virtue, all other virtues will cling to you. If you havehumility and courage, all other virtues will come of their own accord. You should spend daily sometime, say half an hour, for development of virtues.25.What evil quality are you trying to eradicate?The development of virtuous qualities will itself remove the negative qualities. But it isbetter to make a positive attempt also in the eradication of the evil qualities. Then the progress willbe rapid. It is a double attack on the enemy. If you remove lust or anger or egoism, all other evilqualities will disappear by themselves. All evil qualities are the attendants of egoism. All vicesoriginate from anger. If these are destroyed, all sorts of vices will vanish. Therefore, concentrateyour attention in killing egoism or anger.26. Which Indriya is troubling you most?Discipline of the Indriyas is a very important point. If the Indriyas are turbulent, you cannothave concentration. Watch every Indriya carefully and curb it by suitable methods, such as fasting,Mouna, Tratak, celibacy, renunciation of articles, Dama and Pratyahara. Curbing of Indriyas meanscurbing of mind. They cannot do any independent work without the direct help of the mind.Celibacy checks the genitals; Mouna will control the organ of speech; Tratak controls the eyes.Sufficient practice for a long time is necessary. Then the Indriyas become emaciated and thin andare starved to death.27. When did you go to bed?Sleep is natureís tonic, for healthy living. The more sound sleep one has, the more healthyhe would be. Hours of sleep depend upon your physical or mental capacity for resisting fatigue.Without a sufficiency of sleep, you will not have efficiency. The amount of sleep required varieswith age, temperament and amount of work.

Peace is not merely the absence ofnoise, tumult, strife or quarrels, controversies or disputes. It is not a condition or environment fromwhich all undesirable elements are removed. This peace is not an inert passive state. It is not ahypnotic trance. It is not a negative physical condition. It is a positive state of spiritual attainment. Itis your centre, ideal and goal. It is perfect awareness. It is a magnificent, indescribable state inwhich the pure soul enjoys the highest divine bliss and transcendental divine knowledge. You willbecome absolutely fearless and desireless by drinking this divine nectar of peace. You will be incommunion with the Supreme Soul or Atma by attaining this peace. In this state of peace there areno yesterdays or tomorrows, no sunset or daybreakóthere is eternal sunshine. It can hardly beacquired from external sources. It can be reached only by patient spiritual practices.You may be in quite adverse circumstances. You may remain in the midst of calamities,troubles, tribulations, difficulties and sorrows, and yet, you may enjoy the inward harmony andpeace if you rest in God by withdrawing the senses, by stilling the mind and eradicating itsimpurities. Lord Jesus was persecuted in a variety of ways. He was put to death on the cross and yetwhat did he say? He said, ìO Lord, forgive them! They know not what they are doing.î Howpeaceful He was even when His life was at stake! He was enjoying the inner peace.The goal of life is attainment of self-realisation or God-consciousness. There is onesupreme, undying, intelligent principle or essence or Atma or the Supreme Self who dwells in thechambers of your heart. He exists in the past, present and future. He is Existence Absolute,Knowledge Absolute and Bliss Absolute. The ignorant may vainly search for their happiness inperishable external objects that are conditioned in time, space and causation. He has no peace ofmind. His desires are not gratified. He amasses wealth, begets children, gets titles, honours, nameand fame and yet his mind is restless. He has no abiding joy and lasting happiness. He is still in wantof something. He has no feeling of fulness. This feeling of fulness and eternal satisfaction can onlybe obtained by realising oneís own Self through self-restraint, purity and meditation.How long do you want to lead a life of duality, restlessness, discontentment anddissatisfaction? How long do you wish to lead a life of ignorance, bitterness, hatred and separation?How long do you wish to continue your selfish struggles? How long do you wish to beholddifferences and distinctions? How long do you wish to keep the barrier between man and man?You cry for peace or Santi. But where to get it and through whom? You can realise peace inyour own heart through association with the sages and by meditation. You can find this peace onlyin stillness. Peace can be found only within. You certainly cannot find it in external objects. Lookwithin. Sit silently in a quiet room for one or two hours. Close your eyes. Concentrate on a pointbetween the two eyebrows. Withdraw the senses and the mind from the external objects. Be still.Silence the surging emotions and bubbling thoughts. Forget the body and the world. Enter into thegreat calm.

Thegreatness of Om cannot be adequately described by anybody.That place where all speech stops, all thoughts cease, where the function of the intellect andall organs stop, is Om. The goal or word which all Vedas praise, which all scriptures proclaim andwishing for which the aspirants lead the life of Brahmacharya is Om. Om is verily the highest. It isthe best support. It is the highest Truth. He who knows Om is worshipped in the world of Brahman.He obtains verily whatever he desires.Om is formed by adoring the letters A, U and M. ëAí represents the beginning of the range ofsound. ëUí represents the middle. ëMí represents the end.

What is attraction? What is non-attraction? What is thatattraction which leads one to bondage? What is that non-attraction which tends to freedom? Howcan I destroy this bondage? Please enlighten me on the above points.îVasishtha replied: ìIf any one believes that this body is permanent, if he fails to discriminatebetween the body and its presider or indweller or inner ruler who is eternal and if he thinks alwaysof body only he is a slave to attraction and he is bound by attraction. This is attraction. This willundoubtedly lead to bondage. The belief that everything is Brahman or Atma only, and that there isnothing for one to love or hate in this universe is non-attraction. This non-attraction will lead toMoksha or final emancipation.Jivanmuktas are endowed with non-attraction. When there is non-attraction, the mindabandons the pleasures of the world, egoism vanishes and attachment for everything perishes. Thestate of non-attraction leads to Moksha. Those who have attained the state of non-attractionrelinquish the fruits of actions. They seek neither action nor inaction. Attraction entails one inrebirths.65PHILOSOPHY AND VEDANTA"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"This attraction is of two kinds, viz., Bandhya (binding) and Abandhya (non-binding). Theformer belongs to the ignorant, while the latter is the ornament of those who have attainedself-realisation. The former produces rebirths through attachment to objects while the lattergenerates discrimination and knowledge of the Self. Lord Vishnu and the hosts of Siddhas protectthis earth by performing various actions through the Abandhya attraction.A Jivanmukta is not attached to actions though he performs manifold actions for thewell-being of the world. He is quite indifferent though he associates himself with objects. He has noattraction for the objects. His mind is ever fixed in the Supreme Self only. He regards this world asan unreality. He does neither live in future expectation nor does he rely on his present possession.He does not live on the pleasure of his past memory. Sleeping, he is awake in his vision of supremelight; and waking, he is plunged in the deep, sleepless sleep of Nirvikalpa Samadhi. He does actionsand remains as if he has done nothing. He does all actions without the error of believing himself asthe actor. He neither rejoices nor grieves at anything. He behaves himself as a boy with boys and asa veteran with old people. He is youthful in the society of young men and is grave in the company ofthe wise. He rejoices at the happiness of others. He is sympathetic with the people who are indistress. O Ram! Conduct yourself in such a manner when you rule your kingdom. You will neverlose sight of the Reality.\"DEVA-YAKSHA-SAMVADA(Kena Upanishad)In the fight with the Asuras, the Devas were victorious. The Devas thought that they did sowith their own power and prowess and forgot that it was divine help which brought victory to them.Lord Brahma wanted to teach them a lesson. He knew their idea of being puffed up with vanity andappeared before them in the form of a Yaksha (Great spirit) the beginning and end of which werenot visible. They did not know Him. They spoke to Agni thus: ìO Jataveda! Find out what this greatspirit isî. He said ìYesî. Agni ran up to Brahma and Brahma said: ìWho art thouî? He replied: ìIam verily Agni, I am verily Jatavedasî. Brahma asked Agni: ìWhat power hast thou?î Agnireplied: ìI can even burn whatsoever there is on the earthî. Brahma placed a blade of grass beforeAgni and said: ëBurn thisí. Agni approached it with all its power. He could not burn it. Next cameVayu (the god of wind). Brahma asked Vayu: ìWhat power hast thou?î Vayu replied: ìI can blowaway all the universe and all that is on the earthî. Brahma placed a blade of grass before Vayu andsaid: ìBlow this awayî. Vayu approached it with all his power and was not able to make it move aninch from its place. Last of all the chief of the Devas, Indra himself came. But when he reached thespot he found that the Yaksha had vanished. Indra was in a state of great dilemma. He was confusedand perplexed. When he was thus standing there, bewildered and ashamed at their defeat, Uma(Haimavati)óthe daughter of Himavan (Himalayas) and the consort of Lord Sivaóappearedbefore him and revealed to him the real identity of the Yaksha. Then only Indra knew the ëspirití tobe Brahma.

Durga does everything.Mother-worship is the worship of God as the Divine MotheróSri Mata. Sakti is the powerof the Lord or the cosmic energy. The Divine Mother in Her aspect of Durga is represented ashaving ten different weapons in her hands. She is sitting on a lion. She keeps up the Lila of the Lordthrough the three GunasóSattva, Rajas and Tamas. Vidya, Santi, lust, anger, greed, egoism andpride are all Her forms.The Upasana or worship of Devi or Universal Mother leads to the attainment of knowledgeof the Self. The story of the Kena Upanishad known as the ìYaksha Prasnaî supports this view.Uma taught the Truth to the Devas. Goddess Sakti sheds wisdom on Her devotees.A child is more familiar with the mother than with the father, because she is very kind,loving, tender, affectionate and looks after the wants of the child. In the spiritual field also theaspirant or the devoteeóthe spiritual childóhas intimate relationship with the Mother Durga thanwith the Father Siva. It behoves, therefore, that the aspirant should approach the Mother first andShe will introduce Her spiritual child to the Father for his illumination or Self-realisation.Motherís grace is boundless. Her mercy is illimitable. Her knowledge is infinite. Her poweris immeasurable. Her glory is ineffable. Her splendour is indescribable. She gives you Bhukti ormaterial prosperity and Mukti (liberation) also.Approach Her with an open heart. Lay bare your heart to Her with frankness and humility.Be as simple as a child. Kill ruthlessly egoism, cunningness, selfishness and crookedness. Maketotal, unreserved, ungrudging surrender to Her. Sing Her praise. Repeat Her name. Worship Herwith faith and unflinching devotion.

Aspirants are initiated on this day. Akshara Abhyasa for children is done on VijayaDasami day. The beginning of learning of any science is done on this most auspicious day.

The key to saintliness is humility and self-mortification. The light of saintliness issilent meditation. The garb of saintliness is virtue and tolerance, not the Gerua cloth alone.Pravritti and Nivritti are not two different paths. They are two aspects of one and the samepath. There is Pravritti in Nivritti and Nivritti in Pravritti. It is the mental state that counts. Look atJanaka, the king of Videhas. In him, there was absolute Nivritti in Pravritti. Always remember:ìYogasthah Kuru Karmani Sangam Tyaktva Dhananjaya.îMan is the master of his own destiny. He sows an action and reaps a habit; sows a habit andreaps a character; sows a character and reaps a destiny. So he is entirely responsible for hisPrarabdha Karma.
