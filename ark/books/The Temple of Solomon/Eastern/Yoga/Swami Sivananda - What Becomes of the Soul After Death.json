Om Tat Sat.Thy own Atman,SivanandaPUBLISHERS’ NOTEThe problem of life beyond death has ever been a most fascinating one from timeimmemorial. Man has always been intrigued by the question, “What becomes of the Soul afterDeath?” The present volume, as the title suggests, treats in detail of the subject and furnishes ananswer to the agelong question.In recent times there has been much speculation on this problem. This had led to a lot ofresearch work too. The fact of continuity of consciousness after physical death has come to beaccepted as such by most of the modern thinkers, latest of whom, the famous scientist, Dr. J.B.Rhine, has expressed himself in favour of such belief. Many books have been written on thissubject, but hitherto most of the works deal mainly with the astral or other spirit world. It has mostlybeen the study of the conditions in the Pretaloka which is merely one among the numeroussupramundane planes beyond the grave. Spiritism, seance and the testimony of recognisedmediums have for most part featured prominently in all such works.This present book by Swami Sivanandaji Maharaj is a departure from the usual line in that itis based, to a great extent, upon authoritative scriptural texts and upon knowledge derived throughreasoning, deep reflection and personal meditation. It throws a flood of light upon all aspects ofpost-mortem existence not adequately dealt with in other works. The book also gives valuableinformation about the different beliefs on this subject, of the various races and religions.The portions giving the inner meaning and esoteric significance of the different practicesand customs in connection with the dead form a most informative one. The appendix and the storiesin the end and the very interesting poems in the beginning are most thought-provoking and highlyinspiring.iii"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"We feel that the perusal of the present work will confirm man’s belief that ‘death is not theend of life’, that his actions here unfailingly react upon him in the ‘after state’ too and will stimulatehisVicharaor power of investigation. We have no doubt that the reader will be helped to make aproper evaluation of the real worth of this physical existence upon the earth plane in the light of thisnew knowledge of the supracorporeal states of being.—THE DIVINE LIFE SOCIETYINTRODUCTIONParaloka-Vidyaor the science about the departed souls and their planes of living is a subjectof absorbing interest. It is a Mysterious Science which contains many secrets or hidden wonders. Ithas intimate connection with Panchagni-Vidya or the science of transmigration propounded in theChhandogya Upanishad. The doctrine of reincarnation or metempsychosis, transmigration of thesoul and spiritualism come under the Paraloka-Vidya. Everybody is curious and anxious to knowthis science.Great scientists, the inventors of many marvellous things, mighty Emperors who have donestupendous works, inspired poets, wonderful artists, many Brahmins, Rishis, Yogins have comeand gone. You are all extremely anxious to know what has become to them. Do they still exist?What is there at the other side of death? Have they become non-existent or have they dwindled intoan airy nothing? Such questions do arise spontaneously in the hearts of all. The same question arisestoday as it arose thousands of years ago. No one can stop it, because it is inseparably connected withour nature.Death is a subject which is of the deepest interest to everyone. One day or other all must die.The terror of death overshadows the lives of all human beings. It brings considerably unnecessarysorrow, suffering and anxiety to the survivors who are anxious to know about the fate of thedeparted souls.In the West also this question has aroused a great deal of interest and attention in certainscientific circles. Much investigation has been made. But the researches have, however, beenconfined more or less to find out whether or not the individuality survives and persists after thedissolution of the physical body. This has been proved in the affirmative by actual communicationwith the spirit world through science, mediumship etc.A knowledge of this science will rob death of all its terror and sorrow and enable you to seeit in the proper light and to understand its place in the scheme of your evolution. It will certainlygoad you to find out suitable methods to conquer death and attain immortality. It will forcibly urgeyou to take to the study of Brahma-Vidya in right earnest and find out the true Master or illuminedsage who can put you in the right path of Truth and explain to you the mysteries ofKaivalyaorBrahma-Jnana.iv"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The other side of death is accurately described in this book. It has been scientificallyexamined and carefully described. This book contains abundant information on this subject. It willgive you a wealth of facts on this topic. It contains the essence of the Upanishadic teachings.You have suffered very much simply out of ignorance and superstition concerning this mostimportant matter. If you go through this book carefully the veil of ignorance will be removed. Youwill be freed from the horrors of death.The one aim of all Yoga Sadhanas is to face death fearlessly and joyfully. A Yogi or a Sageor even a real aspirant has no fear of death. Death is terribly afraid of those who do Japa, meditationand Kirtan. He and his messengers dare not approach them. Lord Krishna says in theBhagavad-Gita, “Having come to Me, these Mahatmas come not again to birth, the place of painand non-eternity; they have gone to the highest bliss” (Chapter VIII-15).Death is painful to a worldly man. A desireless man never weeps when he dies. A full-blownJnani never dies. His Prana never departs. Your highest duty is to prepare for a peaceful lifehereafter. Conquer the fear of death. Conquest of fear of death, conquest of death is the highestutility of all Spiritual Sadhana. Pray to the Lord to enable you to worship Him in every birth ofyours. End the cycle of birth if you want everlasting bliss. Live in the eternal Atman and be happyfor ever.Bhishma had death at his command(Iccha-Mrityu).Savitri brought back Satyavan, herhusband, to life through her power of chastity. Markandeya conquered death through worship ofLord Siva. You also can conquer death through devotion, knowledge and power ofBrahmacharya.PRAYER OF A DYING MAN(Isavasya Upanishad)ehrNm:y:n: p:a*:N: s:ty:sy:aep:eht:ˆ m:ÿK:m:Œ .t:∂v:ˆ p:‹\\:¿p:av:‡N:ÿ s:ty:D:m:a ̧y: d·ƒy: ..hiraımayena p‡treıa satyasy‡pihita ̧ mukham |tattva ̧ pÂ ̆annap‡vÁıu satyadharm‡ya dÁ ̆Òaye ||The face of Truth is covered by a golden vessel.

of rebirth, of life after death, has remained an enigma through the ages. Humanknowledge is hardly capable of answering all the problems that life foreshadows, and as GautamaBuddha would say, “In this world of forms and illusions created by our senses according to ourillusions, a man either is or is not, either lives or dies, but in the true and formless world this is notso, for all is otherwise than according to our knowledge, and if you ask, does a man live beyonddeath, I answer No, not in any sense comprehensible to the mind of man which itself dies at death,and if you ask, does a man altogether die at death, I answer No, for what dies is what belongs to thisworld of form and illusion.”Yet, human mind would not allow itself to be puzzled by a mystic answer without a definiteconclusion, and the age of implicit belief in what the wise had said once upon a time is long past.Today we have a perpetual demand for concrete evidenceen masse,not of solitary prodigies. But ifsuch be the attitude on a profound mystery like the soul’s transmigration, the obvious answer has tobe, “Better wait until you die, and then you can conclusively know.” There arises, therefore, thenecessity of a cool, rational, dispassionate and impersonal consideration.The doctrine of cause and effect and the consequent inevitability of reincarnation has beenthe very bedrock of the Hindu philosophy. But we cannot ignore the obvious fact that out of 2000millions of the earth’s population over 800 millions have no religious tradition to believe in rebirth,while nearly 540 millions are quite agnostic about its possibility.Naturally, then, it will be a sheer rodomontade of the Hindu’s thought that they were thewisest of men, as though the rest were a massive bunch of ignorant persons, to whom ignorance wasbliss. Then the question will arise, if one is to believe that his present life is resultant of the actionsdone in his previous birth, what was it that caused that previous birth? Well, another previous birth.But what was the cause of that birth, again?Now, to answer this, we have to fall back upon the law of evolution and say that in the long,distant past we had been once animals and from that strata of life we became human beings. But thequestion would again arise that in order to justify the theory of cause and effect there must havebeen some cause as well to be born as human beings, and since animals have no intellect to judgebetween virtue and vice, how could we be held responsible for our birth into the family of Man? Itdoes not matter; let us tentatively accept this illogical hypothesis to be true, and lead ourselves backinto the family of worms and then into the vegetable and the mineral kingdoms, and finally arrive atthe conclusion that God must have been the original cause responsible. But, believing in the theoryof cause and effect, how indeed, for all the world of reason, could God be so unjust and undeniablybecome the original cause for all the suffering, conflict and unhappiness that we must undergo, bornas we are as human beings?1"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"There is no answer for the original cause. The best course is: Be good and do good, believein a good conscience and respect the worthiness of the individual and the ethics of life, leaving therest to God. There are many things beyond the orbit of the human mind, and knowledge of the Self,however imposing the term might be, is the only answer to them. Nevertheless the concept ofrebirth cannot be so easily brushed aside, since there are substantial logical inferences, which yielda strong influence on reason to sustain faith.In the early phases of Vedic literature there is practically no reference to rebirth and nostigma of sins, or dread of the hell-fire and no heavenly lure for the mortals. But with the beginningof the Aranyaka period, as the Vedic mind progressed from a polytheistic concept of the elementalgodhead towards a monistic ideals of the one, absolute Reality, the doctrine of cause and effect andthe transmigration of soul was evolved as a logical necessity in order to safeguard an unsulliedexistence of God in human thought.Now, it is quite well-known that three of the leading religions of the world, though muchyounger to Hinduism in origin, found it necessary to present a dreadful prospect of an eternaldevilment in the hell so that men might desist from flying at each other’s throat and respect socialharmony, the value of culture and the usefulness of peace. A colourful lure of a joyous immortalityin the heaven was offered at the same time, directed only to serve the same purpose. But here theprinciple of evolution was at once discredited and man was either abruptly condemned to hellwithout a slight afterchance of redemption, or he was over-graciously suspended in the heaven foreternity, with an individualised existence. Nor was there any answer as to why one man should beflourishing and happy in spite of being wicked and another should be drudging on a life of want, fullof wretchedness, in spite of being virtuous.The Indian sages on the contrary offered a better solution and made reincarnationresponsible for the evolution of man who alone was the master of his destiny. They frankly admittedtheir incapability of answering why the world should have been created at all, and from that basisasserted that God was not responsible for good and evil, happiness and suffering, but it was manwho was responsible for the decree of his fate, capable at the same time of its betterment through hisown self-effort. So, God could not be accused for all the baffling inequalities and injustices of life,and His position in human thought was kept unscathed. The theory of reincarnation is, therefore, afar more convincing doctrine than any belief that justifies an arbitrary irredemption after death.Furthermore, we have many examples as to how a child easily becomes an adept artist or agifted musician with a very little training, whereas in some aristocratic families we find that in spiteof tremendous efforts of highly qualified teachers and arduous toil on the part of the youngsterhimself he is able to make very little progress in learning. There are also the examples ofchild-prodigies with no background of training. Take another case. There are two children born ofthe same parents and brought up under the same environments: one of them turns out to be abrilliant scholar with fine manners, and the other becomes a dull-headed ragamuffin for no apparentreason at all. The theory of rebirth alone might answer for the difference.Rebirth is life’s sustaining force, even from the worldly point of view. So many dreams andso many eagerly-sought-after ambitions remain unfulfilled; youth gradually decays into old age andinfirmity, and the ember of elusive hope gets dimmer and weaker; but its flame is kept up flickering2WHAT IS DEATH?"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"by a remote expectation that perhaps in another birth those dreams might be fulfilled. So, even fromthis point of view, rebirth is indeed a gentle consolation and a solace of life.There is another school of thought which believes that the sledge-hammer of death puts afinal end to life, the body and the soul having passed out into the five elements in ultimate oblivion.This convenient belief is very appealing to some intellectual sophists. But, if such be the case, thenwhat is to account for the apparitions and the undeniable experiences at a seance? Hence, life afterdeath cannot be ruled out? Now, let us take into consideration as to what should be the attitude of aspiritual aspirant.Man has a tremendous potentiality within himself. He is not the slave of fate. Once Buddhaasked Sariputta, one of his most brilliant disciples, to whom the world owes an immense debt for theestablishment of Buddhism, “Well, monk, does not life burden you and don’t you like to be releasedby death? Or, does living fascinate you, because there is a noble mission to fulfil?” Sariputtareplied, “Venerable Teacher, I desire not life. I desire not death. I wait until my hour shall come,like a servant that waits for his wages.”Even so should be the attitude of an aspirant. He has nothing to fulfil of his own, since hislife is a fulfilment of the will of God. Even the desire to be born again in order to foster a worthyspiritual mission should find no place in him. For, does not God know better as to whom to send asHis messenger to this world? And, is it not man’s highest ideal to rejoice in the dissolution of hisbody and the mind and his individuality in the great cosmic oneness of the Absolute, and thus oncefor all cease to be an individualised consciousness, either astrally existent or physically imprisoned.Most assuredly does every aspirant reserve the right to disclaim rebirth for himself, becauseliberation is his birthright and he is the master of his destiny. No obsession is ever good, be itspiritual or temporal. It is better to cleanse the mind of any unhealthy fear-complex than beharrowed by an obsession at the time of death. Having known the evanescent nature of the materialvalues of life, one has to deny the prospect of being crucified again inside his prison-house of fleshand blood, and claim one’s legitimate due with all the vigour and intensity of will and thought thathe can command.Thought decides action and action decides destiny. There is a vast reservoir of power withinevery individual and one can surely pulverise any possibility of a future life by the sheer force of hiswill, together with the inevitable grace of God, and so modelling his present life as to leave no traceof earthly ambition and no tell-tale of an unwipable mark of stigmatic actions. Did not Dattatreya,the sage of unparalleled wisdom and renunciation say, “For the initiated there is no rebirth?”The Phenomenon Of DeathDeath is separation of the soul from the physical body. Death becomes the starting point of anew and better life. Death does not end your personality and self-consciousness. It merely opens thedoor to a higher form of life. Death is only the gateway to a fuller life.3WHAT BECOMES OF THE SOUL AFTER DEATH"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Birth and death are jugglery of Maya. He who is born begins to die. He who dies begins tolive. Life is death and death is life. Birth and death are merely doors of entry and exist on the stageof this world. In reality no one comes, no one goes. Brahman or the Eternal alone exists.Just as you move from one house to another house, the soul passes from one body to anotherto gain experience. Just as a man casting off worn-out garments, takes new ones, so the dweller inthis body, casting off worn-out bodies, enters into others which are new.Death is not the end of life. Life is one continuous never-ending process. Death is only apassing and necessary phenomenon, which every soul has to pass to gain experience for its furtherevolution.Dissolution of the body is no more than sleep. Just as man sleeps and wakes up, so is deathand birth. Death is like sleep. Birth is like waking up. Death brings promotion to a new and betterlife. A man of discrimination and wisdom is not afraid of death. He knows that death is the gate oflife. Death to him is no longer a skeleton bearing a sword to cut the thread of life, but rather an angelwho has a golden key to unlock for him the door to a wider, fuller and happier existence.Every soul is a circle. The circumference of this circle is nowhere but its centre is in thebody. Death means the change of this centre from body to body. Why, then, should you be afraid ofdeath?The Supreme Soul or Paramatman is deathless, decayless, timeless, causeless andspaceless. It is the source and substratum for this body, mind and the whole world. There is deathfor the physical body only, which is a compound of five elements. How can there be death for theEternal Soul which is beyond time, space and causation?If you wish to free yourself from birth and death, you must become bodiless. Body is theresult of Karmas or actions. You must not do any action with expectation of fruits. If you freeyourself from Raga-Dvesha, or likes and dislikes, you will be free from Karma. If you kill egoismonly, you can free yourself from Raga and Dvesha. If you annihilate ignorance through knowledgeof the Imperishable, you can annihilate egoism. The root-cause for this body is therefore ignorance.He who realises the Eternal Soul, which is beyond all sound, all sight, all taste, all touch,which is formless and attributeless, which is beyond Nature, which is beyond three bodies and fivesheaths, which is infinite and unchanging, self-luminous, frees himself from the jaws of death.Death Is Not The End Of LifeThe individual souls or Jivas build various bodies to display their activities and gainexperience from this world. They enter the bodies and leave them when they become unfit to live in.They build new bodies again and leave them again in the same manner. This is known astransmigration of souls. The entrance of a soul into a body is called birth. The soul’s departure fromthe body is called death. A body is dead if the soul is absent.4WHAT IS DEATH?"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"The conception of a human child in the womb of the mother is the fusion of sperm of maninto ovum of woman. Spermatozoon and ovum are microscopic living cells. They cannot be seenthrough the naked eye. This fusion is generally known as conception and technically as fertilisationof the ovum. In the mother’s womb sperm (Sukla) and ovum (Sonita) are fused into one single cell.This single cell after fertilisation develops into an embryo and further in course of ten months into acomplete human child.Man has always tried to tear aside the veil and know the course of events subsequent to thedeath of an individual. Various theories have been put forward, but it cannot be said that he hassucceeded in tearing aside the veil that covers the life beyond.Science has been struggling to unravel the mystery, but so far no data have been furnishedwhich can form the basis of a theory. But experiments in this direction have yielded many aninteresting fact.Natural death, it is said, is unknown to unicellular organisation. When life on earthconsisted of these creatures, death was unknown. The phenomenon appeared only when fromunicellular the multicellular evolved.Experiments conducted in laboratories have shown that whole organs such as thyroidglands, the ovary, suprarenal gland, the spleen, the heart and the kidneys isolated from the body of acat or a fowl, can be kept alive in vitro to show increase in size or weight due to the appearance ofnew cells or tissues.It is also known that after the cessation of an individuality, parts of the organisation, cancontinue to function. The white blood-corpuscles of the blood, if cared for, can live for months afterthe body from which they were withdrawn has been cremated. But the life, it is true, is the life ofblood-corpuscles; it is not the life of the individual.Death is not the end of life. It is merely cessation of an important individuality. Life flowson to achieve its conquest of the universal; life flows on till it merges in the Eternal.Process Of DeathVasishtha says in the Yoga-Vasishtha:“When on account of the diseases of the body its Nadis lose their vigour and thus becomeunable to expand and contract in order to exhale or inhale air, the body loses its harmony andbecomes restless. The inhaled air does not then properly come out, nor does the exhaled air re-enterthe body. So respiration stops. Respiration stopping, the creature becomes senseless and dead. Allthe desires and ideas of the individual are then withdrawn within himself. The individual with all hisVasanas (desires or previous impressions) within himself is called a Jiva. When the body is dead,the Pranas of the individual with the Jiva within, come out of the body and roam in the air. Theatmospheric air is full of a number of such Pranas which have Jivas within them; these Jivasthemselves having their respective world-experiences potentially existing within them—I can see5WHAT BECOMES OF THE SOUL AFTER DEATH"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"them. At that time the individual with all his Vasanas within him is called Preta (gone to the otherworld.)“In that very place where one dies, one experiences another world after the insensibility ofdeath is over.”Signs Of DeathIt is very difficult to find out the real signs of death. Stoppage of the heart-beat, stoppage ofthe pulse or breathing are not the actual signs of death. Stoppage of the heartbeats, pulse andrespiration, cadaveric rigidity of the limbs, clammy sweat on the body, absence of warmth of thebody, are the popular signs of death. The doctor tries to find out whether there is corneal reflex inthe eye. He tries to bend the leg. These signs are not the real signs of death, because there have beenseveral cases where there were cessation of breathing and beating of heart and yet they were revivedafter some time.Hatha Yogis are put in a box and buried underneath the earth for forty days. Afterwards theyare taken out and they revive. Respiration may stop for a long time. In cases of suspendedanimation, respiration stops for two days. Many cases have been recorded. The heart-beat may stopfor many hours, even for days, and then it can be recovered. Hence it is extremely difficult to saywhat would be the actual or the final sign of death. The decomposition and putrefaction of the bodymay be the only final sign of death.No one should be buried immediately after death before decomposition sets in. One maythink that a man is dead, whereas he may be in a state of trance, catalepsy or ecstasy or Samadhi.Trance, Samadhi, catalepsy and ecstasy are states which resemble death. The outward signs aresimilar.Persons dying of heart-failure should not be buried immediately, as breathing wouldcommence once again after a particular time. Burial should take place only after the body begins toputrefy.A Yogi can stop his heart-beat at his will. He can remain in a state of Samadhi, orsuperconscious state for hours or days. There is neither heart-beat nor breathing during the state ofSamadhi. This is sleepless sleep or perfect awareness. When he comes down to physicalconsciousness, there is revival of heart-beating and respiration. Science cannot explain this anddoctors are dumb-founded when they witness these phenomena.Dissolution Of Elements At DeathThis physical body is composed of five great elements or the Mahabhutas, namely, earth,water, fire, air and ether. The Devas or gods are endowed with a divine or luminous body. The fireTattva is predominant in them. In man the earth Tattva is preponderating. In the case of aquaticanimals the element of water predominates. In the case of birds the element of air predominates.6WHAT IS DEATH?"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Hardness of the body is due to the portion of earth; the fluidity is due to portion of water; thewarmth that you feel in the body is due to fire; moving to and fro and such other activities are due toair; space is due to Akasa or ether. Jivatma or the individual soul is different from the five elements.After death these elements are dissolved. They reach their primordial sources from theinexhaustible storehouse of nature. The element of earth goes and joins its storehouse of PrithviTattva. The other elements also go back to their sources.The dead body is bathed and newly clothed and is taken to the cremation ground where it islaid on the funeral pyre. The Mantras that are now chanted are addressed to the spirit. The spirit isinvoked to throw out from its body its five Pranas or the vital airs, so that they may mingle with theircounterparts in the external air. The body is then addressed to dissolve itself with its five materialcomponents of earth, water, fire, air and ether from where it originally arose. The body is thenoffered to fire. The spirit which is thus driven out of the body in consequence of the dissolutionbegins its onward march to the Beyond.The respective functions of the organs are blended with the presiding gods. Sight goes to theSun from where it had its power of vision; speech goes to the fire, life-breath to the air, the ear intothe quarters, the body into the earth, hairs into annual herbs, hairs of the head into trees and bloodand semen into waters.Function Of Udana VayuVayu is wind or air. Vayu is Prana or vital force. Prana moves the senses or Indriyas. Pranagenerates thoughts. Prana moves the body and causes locomotion. Prana digests the food, circulatesthe blood, excretes urine and motion. Prana causes respirations. It is through Prana you see, hear,feel, taste and think. The sum total of all Pranas is Hiranyagarbha or Lord Brahma. Prana ismanifestation of Prakritis. Gross Prana is breath. Subtle Prana is vital force.Just as there is the subtle bladder within the football, so also there is the subtle body orSukshma Deha within this gross body. Udana Vayu draws out the subtle body from the gross bodyat the time of death. It is this subtle body that goes to heaven and works in the dreaming state. UdanaVayu is the vehicle of transport for all Pranas. It helps deglutition or swallowing of food. It takesyou to Brahman during deep sleep. Its abode is the throat.This immortal Soul or Atman which is the source and support for all the Pranas, mind,intellect, senses and the body abides in the chambers of your heart. This Atman is in the heart wherethere are a hundred and one arteries. Every one of these has seventy-two thousand branches. Vyanawhich does the circulation of blood moves in these arteries.Udana, which goes up through one of these, leads you to the higher worlds by means of yourmeritorious actions, to the evil worlds by means of your evil deeds and to the world of men by amixture of both deeds.7WHAT BECOMES OF THE SOUL AFTER DEATH"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"In the case of Jivanmuktas or liberated sages who have nothing more by way of births norworlds to live in, their minds and Pranas get absorbed in Brahman. The individual soul merges itselfin the Supreme Soul or Para Brahman.In the Jivanmukta there is no question of any forerunner like the Udana Vayu. The liberatedsages with their minds purified by renunciation and with knowledge of the imperishable Atman arecompletely absorbed at the time of death. There is no return to this world for them.What Is Soul?There are two kinds of souls, viz., the individual soul or Jivatman or the human soul, and theSupreme Soul or Paramatman. The individual soul is an image or reflection of the Supreme Soul.Just as the Sun is reflected in different pots of water, so also the Supreme Soul is reflected indifferent minds of different persons.Soul is spirit. It is immaterial. It is intelligence or consciousness. It is Chaitanya. Individualsoul is reflected Chaitanya. It is this individual soul that departs from the body after its death andgoes to heaven, with the senses, mind, Prana, impressions, desires and tendencies. It is endowedwith a subtle astral body when it proceeds to heaven.When the water in the lake is absorbed, the reflection of, the Sun in the water merges in theSun itself. Even so, when the mind is annihilated through meditation, the individual soul mergesitself in the Supreme Soul or Paramatman. This is the goal of life.The individual soul has become impure through cravings, desires, egoism, pride, greed, lustand likes and dislikes. Hence it is finite (Paricchinna), it is endowed with limited knowledge(Alpajna) and limited power (Alpa-Saktiman). The Supreme Soul is Infinite, Omniscient andOmnipotent. It is an embodiment of knowledge and bliss.The individual soul is under bondage through ignorance and limiting adjuncts such as mind,body and senses. It is mere appearance. It is illusory. When it attains knowledge of theImperishable, it is freed from limiting adjuncts and bondage. Just as the bubble becomes one withthe ocean, so also the Jiva becomes one with the Supreme Soul when ignorance is destroyed.A dead body cannot speak, cannot walk, cannot see. It remains like a log of wood after thesoul has departed from the body. It is the soul that enlivens, galvanises, moves and directs the body,mind and the senses.The Supreme Soul is self-consciousness, self-awareness, self-delight, self-knowledge andself-existence. It knows itself and knows others. It is self-luminous and illumines everything.Hence it is Chaitanya. Matter does not know itself. It does not know others. Hence it is Jada orinsentient.The Supreme Soul is formless, attributeless, all-pervading indivisible, decayless, timeless,spaceless. There is neither time nor day nor night in the Sun itself, although it creates day and night.So is the Supreme Soul. Soul is Infinite, Eternal, Immortal.8WHAT IS DEATH?"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"The Supreme alone exists. This world of names and forms is illusory.

The Charvakas, the Lokayatikas, andthe materialists believe that the body only is the soul and the soul does not exist outside the body.They also believe that the soul dies when the body dies.They say that the soul is formed by the combination of the five elements, just as the redcolour is formed by the combination of betel leaves, nuts and lime; or just as an intoxicating liquoris formed by the combination of some ingredients. Is this not a beautiful philosophy? It is thephilosophy of the flesh. It is the philosophy of Virochana and his followers.They believe in nothing which cannot be cognised by the senses. They will not admit theexistence of anything which lies beyond the reach of their senses. They want ocular proof foreverything. They must see the soul with the naked eyes. Then only they will believe in the existenceof a soul. They do not know that the soul can be intuitively realised and that it is not an object ofperception. Their philosophy is “Eat, drink and be merry. Have sensual enjoyment to the maximumdegree. Do not think of the future. If you have no money, beg or borrow it and then eat and drink.Then again drink, because when the body is burnt to ashes, no one will have to be accountable foryour actions.” Such philosophers are abundant in every country. Their number is increasing daily.There are many who do not believe at all in the existence of a soul.TheCharvakasand the materialists do not bother about reincarnation or transmigration ofsouls, about philosophical questions like “Who am I? Whence and where? Whither? What remainsafter death? What is life? What is death? What is then on the other side of death? When the bodydies what conditions shall man pass into; in which world shall he find himself?” They think thatthose who make such enquiries are ignorant persons and that they are the only clever and wisepersons. No argument can convince them or change their views. They have written volumes aftervolumes against the existence of the soul. Wonderful people indeed with perverted intellects!9WHAT BECOMES OF THE SOUL AFTER DEATH"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Most of the modern college students of India, the children of the ancient Rishis and Seers ofIndia, have become followers of the above philosophy on account of wrong education and wrongassociation. They are in the grip of the devil. They are in the clutches of fashion and passion. Theyhave left off prayer, Sandhya, Gayatri Japa, Satsanga, study of the Gita and the Upanishads, theRamayana and the Bhagavata. They are worshippers of the body. They practise vile imitation indress etc. They visit hotels, restaurants, clubs and cinemas regularly, play cards and study novelsenthusiastically. They have no idea of the financial difficulties of their parents and spend hundredsmonthly. After graduation they cannot earn even fifty. Ignorant parents foolishly imagine that theirsons will become big judges, big engineers, barristers and civilians and educate them even byborrowing money and selling their lands. Then eventually they find them in the role of theunemployed. Nature surely punishes wicked students.TheCharvakasand materialists hold that the combination of matter or body producesthought, intelligence, consciousness, mind and soul, and that consciousness, etc., last so long as thebody lasts. They believe that thought or intelligence or consciousness is a function or secretion ofthe brain, just as bile is a secretion of the liver. Very strange indeed! Combination of atoms andmolecules can never generate thought, intelligence or consciousness. Motion cannot producesensation, ideas and thoughts. Consciousness or intelligence is verily not an act of motion. Noscientist can prove that matter or force has ever produced consciousness or intelligence. TheCharvakasand the materialists are deluding themselves by various false arguments. They have losttheir power of discrimination on account of sensual indulgence. They have not got the subtle pureintellect to discern things in their proper light. Consciousness, intelligence and bliss are theattributes of the Universal Soul. This body is constantly changing. This physical body, which is acombination of the five elements, will be destroyed. But the eternal Soul which is the basis,substratum and source for matter, energy, mind will ever remain. The sense of ‘I’ will continue toexist even after this body perishes. You can never think or imagine that you do not exist after thebody is destroyed. There is an innate feeling in you that you do exist after the body is gone. Thisproves that there is an immortal soul independent of the body. The soul can never be demonstrated,but its existence can be inferred by certain empirical facts.The innate question: “What remains after death? What becomes of the soul after the death ofthe body? Where is he gone? Does he still exist?” spontaneously arises in all minds. This is amomentous question which touches the hearts of all deeply. The same question arises today in allpeople of all countries, as it arose thousands of years ago. No one can stop this. The same question isdiscussed today and it will be discussed in the future also. From ancient times, philosophers, sages,saints, Yogins, thinkers, Swamis, metaphysicians and prophets have tried their best to solve thisgreat problem.When you lead a life of luxury, when you are rolling in wealth, you forget it. But themoment you see that one of your dearest relations is snatched away by the cruel hand of death youare struck with awe and wonder and begin to reflect within yourself. “Where is he gone? Does hestill exist? Is there a soul independent of body? He cannot be totally annihilated. His impressions ofthoughts and actions cannot die.”The seers of Upanishads boldly declared with emphasis on account of their intuitiverealisation that there is One All-pervading Immortal Soul, Self-luminous, All-Blissful, Birthless,10WHAT IS DEATH?"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Decayless, Deathless, Timeless, Spaceless, Thoughtless, and that the individual soul is identicalwith this Supreme Soul when his limiting adjuncts such as body and mind are dissolved when he isfreed from ignorance through knowledge of the Imperishable Soul.

Soul is beyond the reach of material science.Man is a soul wearing a physical body. Soul is extremely subtle. It is subtler than ether, mind andenergy. Consciousness, intelligence are of the soul and not of the body. Consciousness is evidenceof the existence of the soul.

Feel this. Realise this and be free.Swoon, Sleep, DeathA man lying in a swoon cannot be said to be awake because he does not perceive externalobjects by means of his senses. The man who returns to consciousness from a swoon says: “I wasshut up in blind darkness; I was conscious of nothing.” A wakeful man keeps his body upright butthe body of a swooning person falls down.He is not dreaming, because he is altogether unconscious. Nor is he dead as he has life andwarmth. He continues to breathe.When a man has become senseless and people are in doubt whether he is alive or dead, theytouch the region of the heart in order to find out whether there is warmth in his body or not and puttheir hands to his nostrils to find out whether there is breathing or not. If they find out there is neitherwarmth nor breath they come to the conclusion that he is dead. If they perceive warmth and breaththey decide that he is not dead and begin to sprinkle cold water on his face so that he may recoverconsciousness.He who has swooned is not dead, because he rises again to conscious life.A man who has swooned may sometimes not breathe for a long time. His body trembles; hisface is dreadful. His eyes are staring wide open. But a sleeping man looks calm and happy. Hedraws his breath at regular intervals. His eyes are closed. His body does not tremble. A sleepingman may be aroused by a gentle stroking with the hand but a person lying in a swoon cannot bearoused even by a blow with a stick. Swoon is due to external causes. It is caused by a blow on thehead with a stick, or the like; while sleep is due to fatigue. Swoon is half sleep. It does not mean bythis that he half enjoys Brahman. It means that it partly resembles sleep. The man who lies in a11WHAT BECOMES OF THE SOUL AFTER DEATH"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"swoon belongs, with one half, to the side of deep sleep, while the other half to the side of death. Infact swoon is the door to death. If there is a remnant of Karma he returns to consciousness. Else, hedies.The state of swoon is recognised by the Ayurveda and Allopathic doctors. It is known fromordinary experience.The silent witness of waking state, dreaming state, deep sleep state and swoon is Brahman,thy innermost Self, Immortal Atman or the Inner Ruler. Identify yourself with Brahman, transcendall the states and be ever happy and blissful.Chapter TwoSOUL’S JOURNEY AFTER DEATHTheJivaor the individual soul along with Pranas, the mind and the senses leaves his formerbody and obtains a new body. He takes with himself Avidya, virtues and vicious actions and theimpressions left by his previous births.Just as a caterpillar takes hold of another object before it leaves its hold of an object, so alsothe soul has the vision of the body to come, before it leaves the present body. Hence the view of theSankhyas that the self and the organs are both all-pervading and when obtaining a new body onlybegin to function in it on account of Karma; the view of the Bauddhas that the soul alone without theorgans begins to function in a new body, new senses being formed like the new body; the view ofthe Vaiseshikas that the mind alone goes to the new body and the view of the Digambara Jains thatthe soul only flies away from the old body and alights on the new one just as a parrot flies from onetree to another, are not correct and are opposed to the Vedas. The soul goes from the bodyaccompanied by the mind, Prana, the senses and the Sukshmabhutas or elements.The soul takes with it the subtle parts of the elements which are the seeds of the new body.All the elements accompany the soul.When he departs, the chief Prana departs after him and when the Prana thus departs, all theother Pranas depart after it. They cannot stay without the basis or substratum or support of theelements. The subtle elements or Tanmatras form the base for the moving Pranas.There can be enjoyment only when the Prana goes to another body. The essence of theelements is the vehicle of the Pranas. Where the elements are, there the organs and Pranas are. Theyare never separated. The soul could not enter into the new body without Prana.The Pranas and the senses remain at the time of death quite inoperative for accompanyingthe departing soul.12WHAT IS DEATH?"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"The materials like milk, curd, etc., that are offered as oblations in sacrifices assume a subtleform called Apurva and attach themselves to the sacrificer. The Jivas then go enveloped by waterwhich is supplied by the materials that are offered as oblations in sacrifices.The water forming the oblation assumes the subtle form of Apurva, envelopes the souls andleads them to Heaven to receive their rewards.Those who perform sacrifices give enjoyment to the gods in heaven and rejoice with them.They become serviceable companions to the gods. They contribute to the enjoyment of the gods bytheir presence and service in that world. They enjoy themselves in the Chandraloka and return to theearth at the end of their store of merit.The souls that descend from heaven have a remnant of Karma which determines their birth.The souls return to the earth by the force of some unenjoyed remnants of Karma. When the totalityof works which helped the souls to go to the Chandraloka for enjoyment of the fruits of good deedsis exhausted, then the body made up of water which has originated there for the sake of enjoyment isdissolved by the fire of sorrow springing from the thought that the enjoyment comes to an end, justas hailstones melt by contact with the rays of the sun, just as ghee melts by contact with fire. Thenthe souls come down with a remainder yet left.We read in the Chhandogya Upanishad V. 107: “Those whose conduct during the previouslife has been good presently obtain good birth, such as the birth of a Brahmin, a Kshatriya, or aVaisya; those whose conduct has been bad presently obtain some evil birth such as that of a dog or apig.”The Smriti says: “The members of the different castes and of the different orders of life whoare engaged in the works prescribed for them, after leaving this world and enjoying the fruits oftheir works in other world, are born again owing to the unenjoyed portion of their rewards, indistinguished castes and families, with special beauty, longevity, knowledge, conduct, property,comfort and intelligence.” Hence the soul is born with residual Karma.Some capital sins like the killing of a Brahmin involve many births. The soul descends bythe route by which he went to a certain stage and then by a different route.The sinners do not go to Chandraloka. They go to Yama Loka or the world of punishmentand after having experienced the results of their evil deeds come down to the earth.Hells are places of torture for the evil-doers. The temporary abodes are Raurava,Maharaurava, Vahni, Vaitarani and Kumbhika. The two eternal hells are Tamisra (darkness) andAndhatamisra (blinding darkness). The seven hells are superintended by Chitragupta and others.Yama is the chief ruler in those seven hells also. Chitragupta and others are only superintendentsand lieutenants employed by Yama. They are all under Yama’s government and suzerainty.Chitragupta and others are directed by Yama.13WHAT BECOMES OF THE SOUL AFTER DEATH"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"The Third PlaceThe Sruti says that those who do not go by means of Vidya along the path of Devayana toBrahmaloka or by means of Karma along the path of Pitriyana to Chandraloka are born often in lowbodies and die often. The evil-doers go to the third place (Tritiyam sthaanam). The Sruti passagesays: “Now those who go along neither of these ways become those small creatures, flies, worms,etc., continually returning, of whom it may be said: ‘Live and Die’. Theirs is the third place. Thesinners are called small creatures because they assume the bodies of insects, gnats, etc. Their placeis called the third place because it is neither Brahmaloka, nor the Chandraloka.“The souls return the way they went, to the ether, from ether to air. Then the sacrificeshaving become air becomes smoke; having become smoke he becomes mist; having become mist,he becomes cloud; having become cloud he rains down. The souls do not attain identity with ether,air, etc. They become only like ether, air, etc. They assume a subtle form like ether, come under theinfluence or power of air and get mixed or connected with smoke etc. The soul passes through themquickly.“Having become cloud he rains down. Then he is born as rice, corn, herbs, tree, sesamumand beans. From them the escape is beset with most difficulties. For, whoever the person may bewho eats the food and begets offspring, he henceforth becomes like unto them.” (ChhandogyaUpanishad: 10.5.)The soul’s journey through the stages of the ether, air, vapour or smoke, mist, cloud and raintakes shorter time than its passing through the stages of corn, semen, foetus, which takes a muchlonger time of hard suffering.Naradiya Purana says: “He who has begun to descend will enter the mother’s womb beforea year passes since starting, though wandering through different places.”The souls are merely connected with rice and plants which are already animated by othersouls and do not enjoy their pleasures and pains. They become connected with those plants.The souls use the rice and plants as their halting station without being identified with them.They do not lose their identity.Chhandogya Upanishad declares: “Whoever eats the food and performs the act ofgeneration, that again the soul becomes” (V. 10.6). The soul gets connected with one who performsthe act of generation. The descending soul becomes again that food and that semen. The soulremains in him in copulation only till he enters into the mother’s womb with the semen injected. Hehas a touch with the seminal fluid created by eating such grain and ultimately attains a body in thewomb.He attains a fully developed human body in the womb of the mother which is fit forexperiencing the fruits of the remainder of works. The family in which he is to be born is regulatedby the nature of the remainder as mentioned in Chh. Up. V. 10-7: “Of these, those whose conducthere has been good will quickly attain good birth, the birth of a Brahmin, or a Kshatriya or a Vaisya.14SOUL’S JOURNEY AFTER DEATH"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"But those, whose, conduct here has been bad will quickly attain an evil birth, of a dog, or a hog, or aChandala.”The whole object of teaching this law of incarnation is that you should realise that theAtman or the Absolute alone is the highest bliss.

Cut the knot of Avidya and soar high in the realms of eternal Bliss.Karma And Reincarnation (i)Death is the separation of the soul from the body. All the sorrow of man comes from thebody. The sage has no fear of death, because he identifies himself with the All-pervading, ImmortalSoul.Karma and rebirth are the two great pillars of Hinduism as well as Buddhism. He who doesnot believe in these two great truths cannot grasp the essence of these two religions.You can overcome pain and sorrow, if you know the meaning of sorrow, pain, suffering anddeath. The phenomenon of death sets the human mind to think deeply. All philosophy springs fromthe phenomenon of death. Philosophy is really study of death. The highest philosophy in India startswith the subject of death. Study the Bhagavad Gita, Kathopanishad and Chhandogya Upanishad,which treat of this. Death is a call to reflect and to seek the goal of Truth, the Eternal Brahman.Death is nothing but the change of body. The soul throws it off like a used garment. Humanlife is getting purged and perfected in order to attain the final bliss. This takes place through myriadsof births.According to Hinduism, life is one continuous never-ending process. All change is onlychange of environment and embodiment. The soul is Immortal. It takes one form after another onaccount of its own actions. Hinduism is based on two fundamental doctrines, viz., the law of Karmaand the law of transmigration. Death is only a necessary and passing phenomenon. Just as you movefrom one house to another, the soul passes from one body to another to gain experiences.The soul which passes out of the body after death is termed ‘Preta’, one that is bound on itsonward march to the Beyond. The soul in its disembodied form hovers about its original andfamiliar places for ten days. It is in the form of a ghost during these ten days. The astral body takesshape from day to day with the formation of the head, eyes, and other limbs of the Linga Sarira, fedand nourished by the sesamum and water poured out in libation over the stones which represent theancestors.15WHAT BECOMES OF THE SOUL AFTER DEATH"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"The soul is fully embodied on the eleventh day.

But the difficulties can be removed and the journey be rendered easyand comfortable by the oblations and offerings given by the son of the deceased during the first yearof the soul’s journey and by feeding pure and learned Brahmins. The son should offer rice-balls tothe father, without weeping. Death is certain for those who are born, and birth is certain for the dead.This is inevitable. Therefore, you should not grieve over it. The ten days’ rites should not beneglected. The son should perform the Sapinda ceremony on the twelfth day and the sixteenmonthly offerings. The soul is sustained on its onward march to the judgement seat by the libationsoffered to it by the son.The soul is scorched on the way by intense heat, but the gift of an umbrella by his son on theeleventh day gives pleasant shade above his head.

The soulleaves off its Pretatva or the garb of a traveller on this day. He is raised to the status of a Pitri orAncestor.Ancestor-worship is one of the fundamental doctrines of Hinduism. There are three stagesin the ancestral life viz., father, grandfather and great grandfather, and mother, grandmother andgreat grandmother. These are the ancestors to any one living here. He who has done meritoriousactions on this earth-life becomes united with his ancestors in the Pitri-loka and lives with them.Those who have given up the performance of Sraaddha, Tarpana and other religious rites onaccount of wrong influence, ignorance and egoism have done great harm to their ancestors andthemselves. They should wake up now. They should start doing these ceremonies from now. It isnot too late now.May you all obtain the blessings of your ancestors through performance of anniversariesand other rites, and regular ancestor-worship!How Soul Departs After DeathAt the time of death when the breathing becomes difficult the Jiva or the individual self thatis in the body goes out making noises. Just as a cart heavily loaded goes on creaking, so does theJiva creak while the Prana departs.The Jiva or the individual self has the subtle body as its limiting adjunct. It moves betweenthis and the next world as between the waking and the dream states. It moves from birth to death.While in birth it associates itself with the physical body and the organs, in death it disassociates16SOUL’S JOURNEY AFTER DEATH"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"with them. The departure of the soul is immediately followed by the departure of the vital force. It ispresided over by the Supreme self-luminous Atman. It is through the light of the self that the mansits, moves and does his daily duties.The subtle body has the vital force or Prana as its chief constituent. It is revealed by theself-luminous Atman. When the subtle body rises up, the Atman also seems to go with it. Otherwisehow can the self, being unified with the Supreme Self, go making noises like a cart? It goes makingnoises because it is afflicted by the pain as the vital parts are being slashed. Loss of memory iscaused as a result of this vital and excruciating pain. He is then put in a helpless state of mind onaccount of the pangs felt. Therefore, he is unable to adopt the requisite means for his well-being,before that crisis comes. He must be alert in practising the means conducive to that end. He is notable to think of God.In old age, the body becomes thin and emaciated on account of fever and other diseases.When the body is extremely emaciated by fever and other causes, dyspnoea sets in and at this stagethe man goes making noises like the overloaded cart.The causes of death are many and indefinite. Man is ever in the jaws of death. Deathovertakes him suddenly when he is the least prepared for it. He ever thinks that he will escape deathor even if he believes in death to be certain he expects it only at a very distant date. Just as themango, fig or the fruit of the Peepul tree is detached from its stalk, so does this Infinite beingcompletely detached himself from the parts of the body, again go in the same way that he came toparticular bodies, for the unfoldment of his vital force. The self that is identified with the subtlebody completely detaches itself from the parts of the body such as the eye, etc. He is not able topreserve the body through the vital force at the time of his departure. Just as he detaches himselffrom the body and the organs, and enters deep sleep, even so, he detaches himself from this bodyduring death and attaches himself to another. As frequently as man moves from the dreaming to thewaking, from the waking to the dream and thence to deep sleep, so frequently does he transmigratefrom one body to another. He has transmigrated from many such bodies in the past and willcontinue to do so in the future as well. He gets his future birth according to his past work,knowledge and so forth. He goes from one body to another, only for the unfoldment of the vitalforce. It is by this vital force, that he fulfils his object viz., the enjoyment of the fruits of his work.The vital force is only auxiliary to the enjoyment of the fruits of his work and hence thespecification: “For the unfoldment of his vital force.”The Jiva has adopted the whole universe as his means to the realisation of the fruits of hiswork and he is going from one body to another to fulfil this object. Therefore the whole universeimplied by his work waits for him with the requisite means for the realisation of the fruits of hiswork made ready. The Satapatha Brahmana says, “A man is born into the body that has been madefor him” (VI-ii. 2-27). It is analogous to the case of a man about to return from the dream to thewaking state.The Departing Soul Compared To A KingWhen the king of a country pays a visit to some place within his kingdom, the leaders of theparticular village anticipating the king’s arrival wait on him with varieties of food, drink, beautiful17WHAT BECOMES OF THE SOUL AFTER DEATH"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"mansions for his stay, etc. They say, “Here he comes, here he comes”. So also the elements and thepresiding deities. Indra and the rest who help the organs to function, wait upon the departing soulwith the means of enjoying the fruits of his work. They secure for him a suitable body to enjoy thefruits of his actions.When the king wishes to depart, the particular leaders of the village approach him unbiddensimply by knowing that he wishes to go, so do all the organs approach the departing man, theexperiencer of the fruits of his work, at the time of death. The organs approach him when thebreathing becomes difficult knowing that he wishes to depart. They do not go at the command of thedeparting self. They go of their own accord knowing the wish of their commander.Process Of DetachmentIt has already been stated that the self completely detaches itself from the body and theorgans at the time of death. When the self becomes weak and senseless the organs come to it. It isnot the self that becomes weak; it is the body. But the weakness of self is figuratively spoken of. Theself being formless can never by itself become weak. So is the case with senselessness. The state ofhelplessness noticeable at the time of death, which is caused by the withdrawal of the organs, isattributed by people to the self. So they say, “Oh, he has become senseless!”When the man is about to die, the various organs withdraw themselves into their originalsources and help no more the function of the organs. In death there is a complete withdrawal of theorgans into the heart or the heart-lotus or Akasa of the heart. But in the state of dream the organs arenot absolutely withdrawn. Here lies the difference between sleep and death.In the case of the organ, eye, the being associated with the eye, who is a part of the Sun, goeson helping the functions of the eye, as he lives. When he dies he ceases to help the eye and is mergedin his own self, the Sun. In like manner, all the organs merge themselves in their respectivepresiding deities e.g., speech in Fire, the vital force in Vayu etc. The respective organs together withtheir presiding deities occupy their respective places when the man takes another body. Thismerging and reappearing take place every day during sleep. When the presiding deity of the eyeturns back from all sides, the dying man fails to notice colour. At this time the self completelywithdraws the particles of light, as in the dream state.Every organ becomes united with the subtle body of the dying man. It is then, people at hisside say of him, “He does not see now.” Thus when one by one all the presiding deities of organswithdraw and merge into the cause, the respective organ stops functioning. Then the dying manhears not, sees not, smells not, speaks not and becomes senseless. He loses his consciousnessforever. He never remembers he is Mr. So-and-so and that he belongs to such-and-such a caste, etc.He loses his understanding, memory and waking consciousness. The external world becomes voidfor him. The organs are then united in the heart.In the subtle body the self-effulgent intelligence of the Atman is always particularlymanifest. It is because of this limiting adjunct that the self comes under relative existence involvingall such changes as birth and death and going and coming.18SOUL’S JOURNEY AFTER DEATH"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"How The Self DepartsThe passage of the self from the body varies according to the number of good actions doneby the Jiva and the knowledge gained by him. If he has a good store of virtuous deeds and relativeknowledge that would take him to the Sun, the self leaves the body through the eye. It leavesthrough the head if he is entitled to the world of Hiranyagarbha. It leaves through other passagesaccording to its past work and knowledge.When the individual self departs for the next world the vital force or Prana also departs.When Prana departs all the other organs too depart. The self has particular consciousness as indreams in consequence of its past work. It does not have independent consciousness. If it hadindependent consciousness everybody would achieve the end of his life. A man attains whatever hethinks of at the moment of death if he has always been imbued with that idea. Everybody has at themoment a consciousness which consists of impressions in the form of particular modification of themind. He goes to the body which is related to that consciousness. Therefore, in order to havefreedom of action at the time of death, those aspirants who desire emancipation should be very alertin the practice of Yoga and right knowledge and the acquisition of merits during their lifetime.The self journeying to the next world is followed by knowledge of all sorts. It has the fullknowledge of both the works enjoined and prohibited. It carries the impressions of experiencesregarding every action that it performed in the past incarnations. These impressions play an activepart in moulding the character of the Jiva in the next birth. His fresh actions in the next birth aremotivated by the impressions of actions of past life. The senses attain skill in performing certainworks even without much practice in this life. It is observed generally that some are very skilful inpainting. They can excel the best painter even without any practice. There are others who cannot dothe same work even after much practice. All this is due to the revival or non-revival of the pastimpressions.Knowledge, work and past experience are the three factors in deciding the future of anindividual. One should, therefore, cultivate virtues, perform good actions so that he may attain adesirable and agreeable body with desirable enjoyments.The organs are all-pervading and all-comprising. Their limitation in the sphere of the bodyand the elements is due to the work, knowledge and past experiences of men. Therefore, althoughthe organs are naturally all-pervading and infinite, since the new body is made in accordance withthe person’s work, knowledge and past impressions, the functions of the organs also contract orexpand accordingly.Just as a leech supported on a straw goes to the end of it, takes hold of another support andcontracts itself, so does the self throw its body aside, make it senseless, take hold of another supportand contract itself.Just as a goldsmith takes apart a little quantity of gold and fashions another, a newer andbetter form, so does the self throw this body away, or make it senseless and make another, a newerand better form, suited for the enjoyments in the world of the manes, celestials, gods orHiranyagarbha.19WHAT BECOMES OF THE SOUL AFTER DEATH"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Desire is the root-cause of transmigration. Being attached to the desires the individual soulattains that result to which his subtle body or mind is attached. Exhausting the results of whateverwork he did in this life, he returns from that world to this for fresh work. Thus, does the man whodesires to transmigrate. But the man who does not desire never transmigrates. He who is free fromdesires, the objects of whose desires have been attained and to whom all objects of desire are but theSelf—the organs do not depart; being but Brahman, he is merged in Brahman. To a knower ofBrahman who has routed out his desires, work will produce no baneful result; for the Sruti says:“For one who has completely attained the objects of his desire and realised the Self, all desiresdissolve in this very life”—Mundaka Upanishad.Soul’s Journey After DeathThe soul accompanied by the chief vital air (Mukhya Prana), the sense-organs and the mindand taking with itself Avidya, good and evil actions and the impressions left by his previousexistence, leaves its former body and obtains a new body.When the soul passes from one body to another he is enveloped by the subtle parts of theelements which are the seeds of the new body.He rises on the road leading through the smoke and so on, to the sphere of the moon. Afterenjoying the fruits of his good actions he again descends to the earth with a remainder of the works,by the way he went and differently too.When the Karma, which gave the soul a birth as a god in heaven, is exhausted, the remainingKarma, good or bad, brings him back to the earth. Otherwise it is difficult to explain the happinessor misery of a new-born child.It is not possible that in one life the entire Karma of the previous life is worked out. Becausea man might have done both good and bad deeds, as a result of which he is born as a god, or ananimal. The working out of both kinds of Karmas simultaneously in one birth is not possible. Hencealthough the result of virtuous actions is exhausted by the enjoyment of heaven, there are otherKarmas in store according to which a man is born again in good or bad environments.The soul has a vision of the body to come. Just as a leech or caterpillar takes hold of anotherobject before it leaves its hold of an object, the soul visualises the body to come, before he leaves thepresent body.The view that after death the entire store of Karmas about to bear fruit fructifies and that,hence, those who return from Chandraloka do so without any remainder of work, is wrong.Supposing that some of those Karmas can be enjoyed only in one kind of birth and some in another,how could they combine in one birth? We cannot say that one portion ceases to bear fruit. There isno such cessation except by Prayaschitta or expiation. If the entire Karmas bear fruit, there will beno cause for rebirth after life in heaven or hell or in animal-bodies because in these there is no meansof Dharma or Adharma. Moreover, some sins like the killing of a Brahmin involve many births. SriMadhvacharya writes in his Bhashya of Brahma Sutras that from the fourteenth year of age the Jiva20SOUL’S JOURNEY AFTER DEATH"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"does of necessity works, each of which would be the cause of at least ten births. How then can theentirety of Karmas lead to one birth alone?The Two Paths—Devayana And PitriyanaTHE PATH OF LIGHT (DEVAYANA)The Uttara Marga or Devayana path or Northern path or the path of light is the path bywhich the Yogins go to Brahman. This path leads to salvation. This path takes the devotee toBrahmaloka. Having reached the path of the gods he comes to the world of Agni, to the world ofVayu, to the world of Varuna, to the world of Indra, to the world of Prajapati, to the world ofBrahman.They go to light, from light to day, from day to the waxing half of the moon, from thewaxing half of the moon to the six months when the Sun goes to the North, from those six months tothe year, from the year to the Aditya.When the person goes away from this world he comes to Vayu. Then Vayu makes room forhim like the hole of a wheel and through it he mounts higher till he comes to Aditya.From the moon to the lightning there is a person, not a man (Amanava Purusha), who leadshim to Brahman.The bright path is the path, to the Devas, Devayana, of the devotees; the bright path is opento the devotees.THE PATH OF DARKNESS (PITRIYANA)The Pitriyana path or the path of darkness or the path of ancestors leads to rebirth. Thosewho do sacrifices to gods and other charitable works with expectation of fruits go to theChandraloka through this path and come back to this world when their fruits of Karmas areexhausted.There are smoke and dark-coloured objects throughout the course. There is no illuminationwhen one passes along this path. It is reached by Avidya or ignorance. Hence it is called the path ofdarkness or smoke. The dark path is to the Pitris or forefathers—Pitriyana or the Karmins who dosacrifices or charitable acts with expectation of fruits.These two paths are not open to the whole world. The bright path is open to the devotees andthe dark path to the Karmins. Samsara is eternal and so the paths also are eternal.The Pranas of Jivanmuktas who have attained knowledge of the Self do not depart. They areabsorbed in Brahman. The Jivanmuktas who attain Kaivalya-Moksha or immediate salvation haveno place to go to or return from. They become one with the All-pervading Brahman.21WHAT BECOMES OF THE SOUL AFTER DEATH"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Knowing the nature of the two paths and the consequences they lead to, the Yogi never loseshis discrimination. The Yogi who knows that the path of Devayana or the path of light leads toMoksha (Karma Mukti) and the path of darkness to Samsara or the world of births and deaths, is nolonger deluded. Knowledge of these two paths serves as a compass or beacon-light to guide theYogi’s steps at every moment.Chapter ThreeRESURRECTION AND JUDGEMENTResurrectionResurrection is rising again from the dead. Resurrection, judgement by God, reward orpunishment are the three important tenets of Mohammedanism, Christianity and Zoroastrianism.The Jews, who lent this doctrine to the Christians and Mohammedans, themselves borrowedit from the Persians.According to some writers the resurrection will be merely spiritual. The general opinion,however, is that both body and the soul will be raised from the grave. It may be asked how will thebody which has been decomposed rise again? But Mohammed has taken care to preserve one part ofthe body to serve as a basis for future edifice, or rather a leaven for the mass which is to be joined toit. He taught that a man’s body was entirely consumed by the earth, except only the bone called AlAjib or the coccygis or rump bone. It was the first-formed in the human body. It will also remainuncorrupted till the last day as a seed from which the whole is to be renewed.Mohammed said that this would be effected by a forty days’ rain which God would send,and which would cover the earth to the height of twelve cubits and cause the bodies to sprout forthlike plants.The Jews also say the same thing of the bone Luz, but they say that the body would sprout bya dew impregnating the dust of the earth.In the 31st chapter of the Bundehesh, the question is asked, “How will the body which thewind has carried away and the waves have swallowed be recreated, how will the resurrection of thedead take place?” To this replied Ormuzd: “When through me the corn which is laid in the earthgrows again and comes once more to life, when I have given to the trees veins according to theirkinds, when I have placed the child in the mother, when I have created the clouds which take up thewater of the earth and send it down again in rain where I will, when I have created each and all ofthese things, would it be harder for me to bring about the resurrection? Remember, all this has beenonce and I have created it and can I not re-create what has already been lost?”The simile of the seed of corn which is laid in the lap of the mother earth and afterwardsshoots out into countless blades is often instanced as a proof of the resurrection, “When the seed of22SOUL’S JOURNEY AFTER DEATH"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"the wheat buried naked in the earth springs up in the manifold clothings of the blades, how muchmore will the virtuous rise again, who have been interred in their vestments?” Three keys lie in thehands of God and are entrusted to no delegate. These are: (1) the key of the rain, (2) that of birth, and(3) that of the resurrection.Signs of Resurrection: The approach of the day of resurrection will beknown from certain signs which precede it. They are: (1) The rising of the sun in the west, (2) Theappearance of Dajal, a monster of most curious appearance who will preach the truth of Islam inArabic language, (3) The blast of the trumpet called Sur, which will be sounded three times.All these are more or less Jewish ideas. After the resurrection, and before the Judgement, theresuscitated souls will have to wait for a long time under the burning heat of the Sun, which willdescend to within a few yards of their heads.The Day Of JudgementThe departed soul will wait for some time. Then God will appear to judge them. Mohammedwill take the office of intercessor. Then everyone will be examined regarding all his actions in hislife. All the limbs and parts of the body will be made to confess the sins committed by each. Eachperson will be given a book in which all his actions are recorded. This corresponds to the books ofthe Hindus in which Chitragupta, the Superintendent of Lord Yama, records all the actions ofhuman beings.Gabriel will hold a balance and the books will be weighed in the balance. Those, whosevirtuous deeds are heavier than the evil ones, will be sent to heaven. Those, whose wicked deeds areheavier than their good actions, will be sent to hell.This belief of the Mohammedans has been taken from the Jews. The old Jewish writers havementioned of the books to be produced at the last day, which contain a record of men’s deeds andthe balance wherein they shall be weighed.The Jews borrowed this idea from the Zoroastrians. The Zoroastrians hold that two angelsnamed Mehr and Sarush will stand on the bridge on the day of Judgement to examine every personas he passes. Mehr represents divine mercy; He will hold a balance in his hand to weigh the actionsof men. God will pronounce the sentence in accordance with the report of Mehr. If the good actionspreponderate, if they turn the scale even by the weight of a hair, they will be sent to heaven. Butthose whose good deeds will be found light, will be thrown from the bridge into hell by the otherangel, Sarush, who represents Justice of God.There is a bridge called Al Sirat by Mohammed, which is on the road to heaven. This bridgeis thrown over the abyss of hell. This bridge is finer than hair and sharper than the edge of a sword.Those Mohammedans, who have done good deeds, will easily cross this bridge. Mohammed willlead them. The evil-doers will miss their footing and fall down headlong into the hell, which isgaping beneath them.The Jews speak of the bridge of hell which is not broader than a thread. The Hindus speak ofVaitarani. The Zoroastrians teach that all men will have to pass over the bridge called Pul Chinavaton the last day.23WHAT BECOMES OF THE SOUL AFTER DEATH"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Chapter FourSOUL AFTER DEATHSoul After Death(ACCORDING TO ZOROASTRIANISM)After death the soul goes to the intermediate world (Hamistaken) which corresponds toPurgatory of Christianity. The soul of the righteous meets a beautiful maiden, the embodiment ofhis pure thoughts, pure words and pure actions. He crosses safely the bridge of the Judge (Chinavatbridge) which is the seat of judgement and reaches heaven. The bridge offers an easy passage for therighteous. The soul passes to ‘Amesh-spentas’ the golden seat of Ahuramazda.The soul of the wicked meets a hideous hag, the embodiment of his evil thoughts, evil wordsand evil actions. He fails to cross the bridge and falls into fire or Hell. The bridge narrows to the sizeof the edge of a sword for the wicked.The soul of the dead hovers round the last resting place in the house, for three days. It takesits seat near the head and chants the Ushtavaiti Gatha “Happy is he to whom Ahuramazda shall givesalvation.” Various ceremonies are performed for four days at the spot. The soul has to appear at theChinavat bridge on the morning of the fourth day. In the case of the righteous there is a fragrantwind as it approaches the place and there appears a beautiful young maiden. The soul is quiteastonished. It asks: “O beautiful maiden! who art thou?” She replies: “I am the conscience of yourown Self. I am an embodiment of your own pure thoughts, pure words and pure actions.”In the case of the unrighteous soul there is a foul-smelling wind when it approaches thebridge and there appears an ugly old hag. The soul asks: “Who art thou, O old lady?” She replies: “Iam conscience of your own self. I am an embodiment of your own evil thoughts, evil words and evilactions.”What Does The Gita Say On Life After DeathThe Blessed Lord said: “Many births have been left behind by Me and by thee, O Arjuna, Iknow them all, but thou knowest not thine, O Parantapa.“This eternal individual Jiva, the world of Jivas, is a ray of Myself and at the time of leavingthe body he draws round himself the various senses, that is, the sense of hearing, sense of sight,sense of touch, sense of smell and sense of taste, with the mind as sixth sense, all these having theirabode in Prakriti i.e., the world of matter, as distinguished from the Purusha, who is theParamatman. When He acquires a body, and when He departs from the same, the Isvara takes theseand goes out, even as the wind is laden with fragrance gathered from flowers and other sources.Verily, the perverted and the deluded do not perceive Him, who thus leaves the body, or whoresided and enjoyed in the body in conjunction with the senses; but the Sages, endowed with the eyeof wisdom, do perceive Him.24SOUL AFTER DEATH"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"“There are two classes of beings in the world, the perishable and the imperishable.

They are, those who are ignorant, and such as are versed in Yoga, and those that areabstemious and religious.“Those practising the Dharana Yoga may go wherever they like, after leaving their bodies,and so the reasonable Yogi is at liberty to roam everywhere.

And mind you, be clearand precise.Philosopher—All and nothing.Student—I thought so. I gave you a problem and you solve it by a contradiction. That’s avery stale trick.Philosopher—Yes, but you raise transcendental questions, and you expect me to answerthem in language that is only made of immanent knowledge. It’s no wonder that a contradictionensues.Student—What do you mean by transcendental questions and immanent knowledge? I’veheard these expressions before, of course; they are not new to me. The professor was fond of usingthem, but only as predicates of the Deity, and he never talked of anything else, which was all quiteright and proper. He argued thus: If the Deity was in the world itself, he is immanent; if he wassomewhere outside it he was transcendent; nothing could be clearer and more obvious. You knewwhere you were. But this Kantian rigmarole won’t do any more: it is antiquated and no longerapplicable to modern ideas. Why, we’ve had a whole row of eminent men in the Metropolis ofGerman learning.Philosopher—(aside) German humbug, he means.Student—The mighty Schleiermacher for instance, and that gigantic intellect, Hegel; and atthis time of day we’ve abandoned that nonsense. I should rather say we are so far beyond it we can’tput up with it any more. What’s the use of it then? What does it all mean?Philosopher—Transcendental knowledge is knowledge which passes beyond the bounds ofpossible experience, and strives to determine the nature of things as they are in themselves.Immanent knowledge on the other hand is knowledge which confines itself entirely within thosebounds, so that it cannot apply to anything but actual phenomena. As far as you are an individual,death will be the end of you. But your individuality is not your true and inmost being; it is only theoutward manifestation of it. It is not the thing in itself, but only the phenomenon presented in theform of time, and therefore with a beginning and an end. But your real being knows neither time norbeginning nor end nor yet the limits of any given individual. It is everywhere present in everyindividual and no individual can exist apart from it. So when death comes, on the one hand you areannihilated as an individual; on the other, you are and remain everything. That is what I meant whenI said that after your death you would be all and nothing. It is difficult to find a more precise answer27WHAT BECOMES OF THE SOUL AFTER DEATH"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"to your question and at the same time be brief. The answer is contradictory, I admit; but it is sosimple because your life is in time, and the immortal part of you in Eternity. You may put the matterthus: Your immortal part is something that does not last in time and yet is indestructible; but thereyou have another contradiction. You see that by trying to bring the transcendental within the limitsof immanent knowledge. It is in some sort doing violence to the latter by misusing it for ends it wasnever meant to serve.Student—Look here, I shalln’t give two pence for your immortality unless I’m to remain anindividual.Philosopher—Well, perhaps I may be able to satisfy you on this point. Suppose I guaranteeyou that after death you shall remain an individual but only on condition that you first spend threemonths of complete unconsciousness.Student—I shall have no objection to that.Philosopher—But, remember, if people are completely unconscious, they take no accountof time. So, when you are dead, it’s all the same to you whether three months pass in the world ofunconsciousness, or ten thousand years. In one case as in the other, it is simply a matter of believingwhat is told you, when awake. So far then you can afford to be indifferent whether it is three monthsor ten thousand years that pass before you recover your individuality.Student—Yes; if it comes to that, I suppose you are right.Philosopher—And if by chance, after those ten thousand years gone by, no one ever thinksof awakening you, I fancy it would be a great misfortune. You would have become quiteaccustomed to non-existence after so long a spell of it—following upon such a very few years oflife. At any rate you may be sure you would be perfectly ignorant of the whole thing. Further, if youknew that the mysterious power which keeps you in your present state of life had never once ceasedin those ten thousand years to bring forth other phenomena like yourself, and to endow them withlife, it would fully console you.Student—Indeed! So you think that you’re quietly going to do me out of my individualitywith all this fine talk. But I’m open to your tricks. I tell you I won’t exist unless I can have myindividuality, I’m not going to put off with ‘mysterious powers’, and what you call ‘phenomena’ Ican’t do without my individuality, and I won’t give up.Philosopher—You mean, I suppose, that your individuality is such a delightful thing—sosplendid, so perfect, and beyond comparison—that you can’t imagine anything better. Aren’t youready to exchange your present state for one which if we can judge by what is told us, may possiblybe superior and more endurable.Student—Don’t you see that my individuality, be it what it may, is my very self? To me it isthe most important thing in the world.“For God is God and I am I”.28SOUL AFTER DEATH"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"I want to exist, I, I. That’s the main thing. I don’t care about existence which has to beproved to be mine before I can believe it.Philosopher—Think what you’re doing. When you say, I, I, I want to exist, is it not youalone that say this? Everything says it, absolutely everything that has the faintest trace ofconsciousness. It follows then, that this desire of yours is just the part of you that is notindividual—the part that is common to all things without distinction. It is the cry not of theindividual, but of existence itself; it is the intrinsic element in everything that exists, nay, it is thecause of anything existing at all. This desire craves for and so is satisfied with nothing less thanexistence in general—not any definite individual existence. No! that is not its aim. It seems to be soonly because this desire will attain consciousness only in the individual, and therefore looks asthough it were concerned with nothing but the individual. There lies the illusion, an illusion it istrue, in which the individual is held fast, but if he reflects, he can break the fetters and set himselffree. It is only indirectly, I say, that the individual has this violent craving for existence. It is the willto live which is the real and direct aspirant—alike and identical in all things. Since then, existence isthe free work, nay, the mere reflection of the will; where existence is, there too must be a will; andfor the moment, the will finds its satisfaction in existence itself, so far, I mean, as that which neverrests, but presses forward eternally, can ever find any satisfaction at all. The will is careless of theindividual, the individual is not its business; although I have said, this seems to be the case, becausethe individual has no direct consciousness of will except in himself. The effect of this is to make theindividual careful to maintain his own existence; and if this were not so, there would be no surety ofpreservation of species. From all this it is clear that individuality is not a form of perfection, butrather of limitation; and so to be freed from it is not loss but gain. Trouble yourself no more aboutthe matter. Once thoroughly recognise what you are, what your existence really is, namely, theuniversal Will-to-live, and the whole question will seem to you childish and most ridiculous.Student—You are childish yourself and most ridiculous, like all philosophers, and as a manof my age lets himself in for a quarter of an hour’s talk with such fools, it is only because it amusesme and passes the time. I’ve more important business to attend to, so Good-bye!Last Thought FormsThe last thought of a man governs his future destiny. The last thought of a man determineshis future birth. Lord Krishna says in the Bhagavad-Gita, “Whosoever at the end abandoneth thebody, thinking upon any being, to that being only he goeth, O Kaunteya, ever to that conformed innature” (Chap. VIII, 6).Ajamila lost his pious conduct, and led a detestable living. He fell into evil depth of sinfulhabits and resorted to theft and robbery. He became a slave of a public woman. He became thefather of ten children, the last of whom was called Narayana.When he was about to die, he was absorbed in the thoughts of his last son. Three fearfulmessengers of death advanced towards Ajamila. Ajamila cried aloud in great distress the last son’sname ‘Narayana’.29WHAT BECOMES OF THE SOUL AFTER DEATH"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"On a mere mention of the name of ‘Narayana’, the attendants of Lord Hari came speedilyalong and obstructed the messengers of death.

This vile Sisupala spent his lifetime in reviling Lord Krishna and then he enteredthe Lord.The worm on the wall when stung by the wasp changes into the form of the latter. Similarlythe man who focuses his hate on Lord Krishna gets rid of his sins and reaches that Lord by regulardevotion, as the Gopis did by Kama (passion), Kamsa by fear, Sisupala by hatred and Narada bylove.Lord Krishna says in the Gita: “Whoever constantly thinks of Me intensely and withone-pointed mind, to such steadfast Yogis, I am easily attainable, and having thus reached Me andmerged in Me, they are not born again in the fleeting world of woe and misery. O Arjuna! While allthe worlds, created by Brahma, are limited by time and have their moment of dissolution, onreaching Me, there is no rebirth, therefore at all times, meditate on Me, the Supreme Vasudeva, andwith mind and intellect fixed on Me. Doubtless you will attain Me.” (Chapter VIII—14, 15, 16.)This constant practice of fixing the mind on the Lord, although a man is engaged in worldlypursuits, will enable him to intuitively and automatically think of the Lord, even at the time of hisdeparture. The Lord says: “With the mind thus engaged in the Yoga of constant practice, notdeflected by any other obstacles, one attains the Supreme Purusha of resplendent glory”. The Lordfurther says, “At the time of death, he who thinks of My real Being as the Supreme Lord SriKrishna, or Narayana, leaves the body and verily reaches my Being. Doubt this not! In whateverform a man thinks of Me at the time of death, that form he attains, that form again being the result ofnourishing that thought in a particular groove and by constant meditation of the same.”The Lord further says: “He who further establishes his mind on Me, even at the time offorthgoing and who is in that Divine state of renouncing everything and of dwelling in Brahman orBrahmic state, is free from delusion.”He who has a strong habit of using snuff in his life imitates the act of snuffing with hisfingers when he is in an unconscious state just before his death.

Itcannot come by a stray practice in a day or two, in a week or a month. It is a lifelong endeavour andstruggle.Personality And IndividualityThere is a distinction between personality and individuality. Many have no clearunderstanding of these two terms. They get these mixed up and are confused. Some people thinkthat personality is individuality and individuality is personality. That which distinguishes a personfrom a thing or one person from another is personality. Personality in common parlance refers to thebody. When a man is tall, has good complexion and beautiful features, when his face has a fine cut,we say that Mr. So-and-so has a charming personality. When one is able to influence others, peoplesay that such-and-such a man has strong personality. When one is timid and shy we say that suchand such a man has weak personality; he must develop his personality. Personality counts much insociety for success in life.The term personality comes from the Latinpersona,the mask. Personality is that particularconsciousness which concerns the physical body. Mr. or Mrs. or Miss So and so is the personality.Hunger, thirst, physical beauty, black or red colour, height, stature, anger and all the limitations ofthe body relate to the personality. He is a Brahmin. He is a Sannyasin. He is a merchant. He is adoctor. All these concern the personality. This is the mask which the man is putting on now.Death destroys the personality but it cannot annihilate the individuality. Individuality isseparate and has distinct existence. It is something which is beyond the body. It has no relation toyour personality at all. It is the sense of ‘I’. It is like a continuous current. It is the continuity of theone thought, the thought of ‘I’. All other thoughts are centred round this ‘I’. I was a boy. I become aman. I was a doctor. I ate. I drank. I spoke. I meditated. I talked. I went to America, England, Franceand Germany. The same ‘I’ has gone through all these experiences. ‘I’ is the dweller in this body. ‘I’is the same in childhood, youth and old age.Personality changes but your individuality, the sense of ‘I’ can never change because thesense of ‘I’ will continue to exist with you. After leaving this physical body the sense of ‘I’continues to exist. After death you take the sense of ‘I’ with you. Even in dream you have the senseof ‘I’ within. Even in deep sleep you have the sense of ‘I’. If you have not got the sense of ‘I’ in deepsleep you would not remember that you slept happily.You can lose this individuality by becoming one with the Supreme Self or Para Brahmanthrough meditation and Nirvikalpa Samadhi. Just as the water in the pot becomes one with theocean when the pot is broken, so also the individuality becomes one with the Infinity or theUniversality when ignorance is destroyed, when the idea of separateness is annihilated throughknowledge of the Imperishable or Brahma Jnana. Do you see now clearly the difference betweenpersonality and individuality?31WHAT BECOMES OF THE SOUL AFTER DEATH"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Belief Of The Ancient EgyptiansThe Egyptians believed in a ‘double’ which was like a shadow of the body. This doubleremained as long as the body remained. The soul was only a double. It had no individuality of itsown. It was never able to do away with its connection with the body. If the body was injured in anypart the double or soul was also injured. Hence they preserved the bodies to keep the soul intact.They took recourse to mummification of the bodies of the dead. They wanted to preserve the deadbodies for a very long time in order to make the departed soul immortal.The double remained only so long as the body remained. If the corpse is destroyed, thedeparted soul also must perish. The soul after death wandered about freely all over the world, andreturned to the place where the corpse was kept with intense thirst and hunger.The Chaldeans also believed in a double which would be destroyed if the body weredestroyed. They expected a resurrection of the corpse again to life. They could not conceive of astate without this physical body.The ancient Egyptians or Chaldeans could never entirely dissociate the idea of the soul fromthe corpse of the departed or the place of burial. Some of the Christians expect a resurrection of thecorpse. Hence they embalm and bury the dead. They do not cremate the dead bodies, just as theHindus do. They still believe that the body will rise after death.The Hindus do not wish that departed souls should hover round the body even for a minute.The departed soul is always extremely desirous to enjoy life once more. It wishes to enter aphysical body to fulfil its desires. The Hindus do not wish that the souls be earth-bound. They wishthat the souls should march quickly towards their abode of happiness. That is the reason why theycremate the dead bodies at once.Chapter FiveDOCTRINE OF REINCARNATIONEmerson, Plato, Pythagoras had perfect belief in the doctrine of reincarnation. The doctrineof reincarnation is the foundation of Hinduism and Buddhism. The ancient Egyptians believed it.The Greek philosophers made it the corner-stone of their philosophy.Man clings to this earthly life. This clinging to life proves that there is past experience andexistence. This proves also that there is a future life. Man likes this life immensely and stronglyyearns for a future life also.Some are born and pass out within a few weeks, a few months, a few years. Some childrendie in the womb. Some are centenarians. Why is this? Why do some people come and live for a shorttime and others live longer? Is this accidental? Is there any law that governs life and death? Do the32SOUL AFTER DEATH"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"human beings come here and pass out without any definite purpose? There is a law which governslife and death. That law is the law of cause and effect.The law of cause and effect governs everything. The law of cause and effect is inexorableand all-powerful. This whole world runs under this supreme law. All the other laws come under thislaw. The law of Karma is the law of cause and effect. God does not punish any one. Man reaps thefruits of his Karma. The law of cause and effect operates on him. He reaps a harvest of pleasure forhis good actions. He suffers and experiences pain and disease, loss of property for his wickedactions.Instinct is the result of past experience. One of the important arguments for reincarnationhas been built on this by the Hindus. The past experiences of death remain in the subconscious mindor Chitta in a latent or dormant state. They are in the form of Samskaras or impressions. They areworking underneath the conscious, objective mind. Man is terribly afraid of death, because the pastexperience of pain is in the subconscious mind.Love at first sight is a certain feeling of a previous life lived together. These souls lovedbefore. They remember that and actually feel as if they had met each other. Such loves are not at alla matter of sex, and are seldom broken off. Lord Buddha told his wife of her kindness to him in aprevious birth and several times gave details of the previous lives of other people.Every effect must have a cause. Something cannot come out of nothing. Existence cannotcome out of non-existence. This is the fundamental principle of modern science. This is thefundamental doctrine of philosophy also. You have not come out of nothing. There is a cause foryour existence here. One is born blind. One is a genius. One is dull. One is rich. One is poor. One ishealthy. One is sickly. There is a definite cause for all these things.The cause is the unmanifested condition of the effect. The effect is the manifested state ofthe cause. Tree is the cause. The seed is the effect. Vapour is the cause. Rain is the effect. The wholetree remains in the seed in potential form. The whole human form remains in the drop of semen inan invisible potential state. The seed of a banyan tree can produce only a banyan tree but not amango tree. The drop of human semen can produce only a human being but not a horse. From a tinydrop of semen a big human form with various limbs and organs comes out. What a great marvel!From a small seed a gigantic banyan tree comes out. What a great wonder! Just close your eyes andreflect over this mystery. You will be struck with awe and wonder.Within the gross physical body there is another subtle body or Linga Sarira or SukshmaDeha. This subtle body comes out with all its impressions and tendencies at the time of death of thegross physical body. It is like vapour. It cannot be seen by the naked eye. It is the subtle body thatgoes to heaven. It manifests again in a gross form. This re-manifestation of the subtle form into thegross physical form is called the law of reincarnation. You may deny this law, but the law is there. Itis inexorable and unrelenting. If you deny the law, it clearly shows that you are quite ignorant of itand it will surely operate whether you admit it or not. The light of the Sun is there whether the owlaccepts it or not.33WHAT BECOMES OF THE SOUL AFTER DEATH"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"You acquire your knowledge through experiences. A man plays on the harmonium. Heplaces each finger on each key consciously. He repeats it again and again. After some time themovement of fingers becomes a habit. He plays a tune without looking into the particular keys.Even so your tendencies are the result of your past conscious actions.Sri Sankara and Sri Jnana Dev knew the Vedas and other Sastras in their boyhood. A childplays on the piano in a masterly manner. A child delivers lectures on the Gita. Goethe, the eminentGerman poet, was the master of seventeen languages. These geniuses did not acquire these in thislife. They must have had them in past lives.Every child is born with certain tendencies or predilections generated by past consciousactions. No child is born with a vacant mind or a clean blank page of a mind, atabula rasa.We havehad past lives. This is the emphatic declaration of the great sages, Rishis and Yogis of the past andof modern times. Jesus Christ believed in it. He says in the Bible: “Before Abraham was, I am”.Reincarnation made its appearance in the early Christian Church. Elijah is reborn as John theBaptist.Heredity cannot explain all these inequalities and diversities, the cases of geniuses. Theparents, brothers and sisters of these prodigies are quite common persons. Tendencies are the resultof the past actions. They do not come through heredity. The geniuses have gained their talents intheir previous lives. If your desires are not gratified in this life under present conditions, you willhave to come back again to this earth-plane for their fulfilment. If you have a strong desire tobecome a Master Musician in this birth and if you cannot achieve this and still cherish this desire,this desire will bring you back to this earth-plane and place you in suitable environments andfavourable conditions. You will start again from your childhood with a tendency to become aMaster Musician.An objection is brought against the doctrine of reincarnation. That objection is, “Why do wenot remember our past?” Do you remember what you did in your childhood? Will you say you didnot exist then, because you cannot remember? Certainly not. If your existence depends upon yourmemory then this argument proves that you did not exist as child, because you do not rememberyour childhood. The details have passed out of your memory, but the knowledge you have acquiredthrough your experiences is still in your subconscious mind or Chitta as impressions.If you remember your past you may make a bad use of the present. Your inveterate enemy inyour past life may be born as your son in this life. If you remember the past you will draw yoursword to kill him. Feelings of enmity will rise in your heart at once.

It is not desirable to remember the past.Suppose for a moment you know the past—you know that you have committed a sinful action inyour past life and you are going to suffer for it.

Ithas been held as true by the mightiest Eastern nations. The ancient civilisation of Egypt was builtupon this doctrine and it was handed over to Pythagoras, Plato, Virgil and Ovid, who scattered itthrough Greece and Italy. It was the keynote of Plato’s philosophy when he says that all knowledgeis reminiscence. It was wholly adopted by the Neo-Platonists like Plotinus and Proclas. Thehundreds of millions of Hindus, Buddhists and Jains have made that doctrine the foundation of theirphilosophy, religion, government and social institutions. It was a cardinal point in the religion of thePersian Unagi. The doctrine of Metempsychosis was an essential principle of the Druid faith andwas impressed upon the Celts, the Gauls and the Britons. Among the Arab’s philosophers it was afavourite idea. The rites and ceremonies of Romans, Druids and Hebrews expressed this truthforcibly. The Jews adopted it after the Babylonian captivity. John the Baptist was to them a secondElijah. Jesus was thought to be a reappearance of John the Baptist or one of the old prophets. TheRoman Catholic purgatory seems to be a makeshift, contrived to take its place. Philosophers likeKant, Schelling and Schopenhauer have upheld this doctrine. Theologians like Julius Muller,Dorner and Edward Beecher have maintained it. And today it reigns over the Burmese, Siamese,Chinese, Japanese, Tartarian, Tibetan, East Indian and Ceylonese including at least 750 millionmankind and nearly two-thirds of the human race. Is it not surprising then that this great and grand35WHAT BECOMES OF THE SOUL AFTER DEATH"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"philosophical education, which the Hindus and Buddhists and Jains gave to the world centuries andcenturies before the Christian Era, should or could be blotted out of existence from the Western andEuropean world by the soul-blighting and absurd dogmas of the dark ages that supervened? By thepersecution of the wise men and destruction of the innumerable works in the Library ofConstantinople, the Church hierarchy managed to plunge the whole of Europe into mentaldarkness, which has given the world the black record of inquisition and the loss of millions ofhuman lives through religious wars and persecutions.Here is a challenge to the non-believers of the Hindu theory of transmigration. In Delhi, alittle girl Santi Devi gave a vivid description of her past life. There was great sensation in Delhi andMathura, nay, throughout the United Provinces. There was a great assembly of persons to hear herstatements. She recognised her husband and child of per previous birth who were living in Mathura.She pointed out the place where money was kept and an old well in the house which is covered now.All her statements were duly verified and corroborated by respectable eye-witnesses. Several caseslike this have occurred in Rangoon, Sitapur and various other places. They are quite common now.In such cases the Jiva takes immediate rebirth with the old astral body or Linga Sarira. That is thereason why memory of previous births comes in. He did not stay in the mental world for a long timeto rebuild a new mind and astral body to his various experiences of the world.Transmigration made its appearance in the early Christian church. Elijah was reborn as Johnthe Baptist. “Did the blind man sin, or his parents, that he was born blind?” asked the believers intransmitted retribution. There is a period of anxiety immediately after death, when angels contendwith demons for the possession of the departed soul on its way to purgatory.Pythagoras and others had their belief in metempsychosis from India only. Pythagoras whoflourished in the 6th century also taught a doctrine of transmigration; and, curiously enough,prescribed abstinence from the eating of flesh.The suckling of a child and the act of swimming of a duckling—these instinctive acts areproofs of memory which must be the result of their corresponding and inseparable impressions leftby the same acts in a previous incarnation, never mind when and where. Every act leaves Samskarasin the Chitta which causes memory. Memory in its own turn leads to fresh actions and freshimpressions. This cycle or Chakrika goes on from eternity like the analogy of seed and tree.There is no beginning for them, the desire to live being eternal, for them, i.e., for the desires.Desires have no beginning or end; every being is clinging to this physical life (Abhinivesa). This“will to live” is eternal. Experiences are also without beginning. You cannot think of a time whenthis feeling of ‘Aham’ or ‘I’ has existed. This ‘I’ exists continuously without any interruption. Fromthis we can easily infer that there have been previous births for us.Now could there be fear of death to avoid pain, in any being who has been born, if he has noexperience of liability to death, it being understood that desire to avoid anything is only caused byremembrance suffered in consequence thereof. Nothing which is inherent in anything stands inneed of a cause. How should it be that a child, which has not experienced this liability to death in thepresent life, should, as he may be falling away from the mother’s lap, begin to tremble and hold hishands tightly the necklace hanging on her breast? How is it that such a child should experience the36DOCTRINE OF REINCARNATION"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"fear of death, which can only be caused by the memory of the pain consequent upon aversion todeath, whose existence is inferred by the trembling of the child?We have got boy-geniuses. A boy of five becomes an expert in piano or violin. Sri Jnanadevwrote his commentaryJnanesvarion the Gita when he was fourteen years old. There had beenboy-mathematicians. There was the boy-Bhagavatar in Madras who conducted Kathas when hewas eight years old. How could you explain this strange phenomenon? This is not a freak of nature.The theory of transmigration only could explain all these things. If one man gets deep grooves in hismind by learning music or mathematics in this birth he carries these impressions to the next birthand becomes a prodigy in these sciences even when he is a boy.Even in the New Testament there is sufficient evidence for reincarnation. In St. John IX-2, aquestion is put to Jesus by his disciples—which did sin, this man or his parents, that he was bornblind? This refers to two popular theories of time—one, that of Moses who taught that the sin offathers would descend on children to the third and fourth generation, and the other, that of thedoctrine of reincarnation. Jesus merely says that neither that man’s sin nor his father’s sin was thecause of his blindness; he does not deny the pre-existence of that man. Lord Jesus indicates thatJohn took the reincarnation of Elijah.But people may say—if this doctrine is true, how is it that he does not remember his pastincarnation? I will ask such people, in what way do we exercise the faculty of memory? Certainly,so far as we are living in a body, we exercise it through the brain. In passing from one incarnation tothe other, the soul does not carry the former brain in the new body. Even during the course of onelife, do we always remember our past doings? Can any one remember that wonderful epoch—theinfancy?If you have a knowledge of the Raja Yogic technique of perceiving the impressions directlythrough the Raja Yogic Samyama (Dharana, Dhyana and Samadhi at one time) you can rememberyour past lives. In Raja Yoga philosophy of Patanjali Maharshi, you will find:“Samskara-Sakshat-Karanat Purvajati-Jnanam.” By perceiving the impressions, comes theknowledge of the past life (Ch. III—18). All experiences that you have had in various births remainin the form of impressions or residual potencies in Chitta or subconscious mind. They remain in avery, very subtle form, just as the sound remains in a subtle state in the gramophone record. Theseimpressions assume the forms of waves and you get memory of past experiences. Therefore if theYogi can make a Samyama on these past experiences, in the Chitta, he can remember all the detailsof all his past lives.Reincarnation Is Quite True (i)Man can hardly attain perfection in one life. He has to develop his heart, intellect and hand.He has to mould his character in a perfect manner. He has to develop various virtuous qualities suchas mercy, tolerance, love, forgiveness, equal vision, courage, etc. He has to learn many lessons andexperiences in this great world-school. Therefore he has to take many lives. Reincarnation is verytrue. One small life is a part of the long series that stretches behind you and in front of you. It is quiteinsignificant. One gains a little experience only. He evolves very little. During the course of one lifeman does many evil actions. He does very little good actions. Very few die as good men. Christians37WHAT BECOMES OF THE SOUL AFTER DEATH"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"believe that one life determines and settles everything. How could this be? How can the everlastingfuture of man be made to depend on that one small, little, insignificant life? If in that life he believesin Christ, he will get eternal peace in heaven; if he is an unbeliever in that life, he will get eternaldamnation, he will be thrown for ever in the lake of fire or horrible hell. Is this not the mostirrational doctrine? Should he not get his chances for correction and improvement? The doctrine ofreincarnation is quite rational. It gives ample chances for man’s rectification, growth and gradualevolution.Transmigration Of SoulsThe word ‘transmigration’ means passing from one life to another. The one great andfundamental tenet of most schools of Indian Philosophy, with the exception of the Charvaka or thematerialist, is the belief in the immortality of the soul. The soul passes through a number of lives forattaining perfection. This is technically called ‘transmigration of souls’.Belief in the metempsychosis or transmigration of soul ‘dates from primeval times. It is asearly as primitive man. One solution of the mystery of death and a consoling thought about death isthe indestructibility of the soul and its existence after death in other forms. In India the ancientAryans found in it the solution of the age-long problem of human suffering and developed it into avery distinct religious doctrine.The purpose of transmigration is not reward of punishment, but betterment and perfection.It prepares the human being for the ultimate realisation which frees him from the cycle of births anddeaths. It is not possible to achieve perfection and absolute freedom without a plurality of lives.Man develops tendency and aptitude in several births and becomes a genius in one birth.Buddha gained experiences in several births. He became a Buddha only in his last birth. In one birthall virtues cannot be developed. One can cultivate the virtues by gradual evolution. The baby sucks,the young duck swims. Who taught this? They are the Samskaras or the tendencies of previousbirths.There had been many instances of children like Santi Devi, etc., who have narrated all abouttheir previous lives. All these have been fully corroborated also. The children have actually pointedout their houses in which they lived in their previous lives.Soul, retribution, transmigration, divinity were all accepted by Plato. Pythagoras also taughtthe doctrine of transmigration. Buddha also taught the doctrine of transmigration.The older Egyptians embalmed their dead and buried them in the best tombs they couldafford. The deceased had a kind of twin soul, one half of which remained in the tomb as long as thebody continued undecayed, while the other proceeded on passport to the immortal gods. Therequisite indication was given by a divine Judge, whose opinion as to destiny was final.Transmigration in some obscure form was nevertheless held by the Egyptian priesthood.The human body is only a vesture and dwelling place for the immortal soul. The soul cancertainly re-inhabit another dwelling place and put on another vesture in order to develop and38DOCTRINE OF REINCARNATION"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"realise better than before the Divine plan and purpose for it. The Creator has so planned. The soul ofa depraved and corrupted human being is given another training in another body. The evolution ofall beings is for a better condition. Evolution to the higher and not a deterioration to the lower isgenerally the law and principle of Nature. But there is exception to the general rule.The soul armed with the little virtue and divinity gained in the previous existence entersanother life to increase, develop and better that original stock. There is now a greater response of thebody controlled by the soul to God, Goodness, Truth, Holiness and other attributes of God.No opportunity is afforded to the sinner to purify himself in later births. His finite sin, if notsomehow purged, precipitates him at death into endless misery. This cannot be. This is notreasonable. The doctrine of transmigration gives ample scope for the sinner to correct and educatehimself in future births. Vedanta says that there is hope of salvation even for the worst sinner.He reaps the harvest of his misdeeds for a limited period. After he has been purged of hissins, he is again born as a rational being and is thus given a fresh chance for working out hisemancipation with freedom of will to choose the right path or the wrong one, and with knowledge todistinguish the one from the other.You are responsible for your well-being or otherwise, through your own Karma or action.The diversity in individual characters, the different predilections or tendencies of the differentchildren at their births and the inequalities of human lives can only be accounted for and explainedthrough the Law of Karma. The Law of Karma gives liberty and freedom to an individual to grow tohis full perfection.The image of a man is reflected in a mirror. Nothing passes from the man to the image. Theimage is not the same as the man nor yet is it another. In exactly the same way rebirth takes place.The new being is like the image. The Karma which gives rise to the new being is like the mirror,through the agency of which the image of the man is reflected.The enlightening influences of Yogis and Sages, their lives and teachings assert themselvesmore and more in the new life. The light of God is more sought after and the gravitation towardsGod becomes stronger and stronger. More and more the life becomes fit to see God and hear Hisvoice. Progress advances from the existence to the next—we cannot say through how manylives—until the final and stainless state of perfection is reached and the individual soul mergesitself in the Supreme Soul.Whence have I come? Whither shall I go? These questions will be asked by every intelligentperson. They are problems of life. Your present life is but one in a series of countless incarnations,though not all in the human form necessarily.The union of the soul with a particular body is known as birth and its separation therefrom iscalled death, when the soul leaves its physical sheath, it transmigrates into another body, human,animal or even vegetable, according to its merits. The Kathopanishad says: “Now I will tell you, ONachiketas, the eternal and divine mystery as to how the soul fares after attaining death. Some souls39WHAT BECOMES OF THE SOUL AFTER DEATH"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"attain to other bodies, while some fall to the vegetable state according to their action andknowledge” (1-2-18).The process of transmigration continues till the soul being purged of all its impurities andhaving acquired a true and full knowledge of the Imperishable Soul by Yoga attains Mukti or thefinal emancipation and enjoys perfect, eternal bliss by its union with the Supreme Self or ParaBrahman.According to Indian philosophy, there is a subtle body or Sukshma Sarira within thephysical body. When the physical body perishes, this subtle body does not perish. It moves toheaven to enjoy the fruits of its good actions done here. This subtle body perishes only when thesoul attains the final emancipation. The impressions or Samskaras, Vasanas or the tendencies arecarried in the subtle body.There are blessed souls like Vama Deva, Jnana Dev, Dattatreya, Ashtavakra andSankaracharya who in their very first entry into the world attained a high degree of perfectionbefore death. They are all born Siddhas. There are some other souls who will need few furtherrebirths for their full perfection and attainment of Moksha.A good soul makes a good body, a bad soul a bad body. Body is an indispensable aid to thesoul in its progress towards God. The body was designed by God to carry the soul on its onwardmarch. Petrol and steam are great forces. But by themselves they cannot make the journey with adefinite course and a definite destination. They must be harnessed to a machine, a running train orsteamer. A pilot or a driver puts petrol or steam into the conveyance and drives and steers it towardshis destination. Therefore the soul must have a body to run its course and reach its destination inGod.When knowledge of the Imperishable is attained, there is no more transmigration. MotherPrakriti’s work is over now. She shows all the experiences of this world to the individual soul andtakes him higher and higher through various bodies till he regains back his essential divine nature,till he merges himself in the Supreme Self or Para Brahman.Strive by every means to make your life better by ceaseless spiritual culture and practicalYoga Sadhana. Only by enlightenment or Brahma Jnana you can obtain deliverance from thewearisome round of births and deaths.Theory Of RebirthMan can be compared to a plant. He grows and flourishes like a plant and dies in the end butnot completely. The plant also grows and flourishes and dies in the end. It leaves behind it the seedwhich produces a new plant. Man leaves when dying his Karma behind—the good or bad actions ofhis life. The physical body may die and disintegrate, but the impressions of his actions do not die.He has to take birth again to enjoy the fruits of these actions. No life can be the first, for it is thefruits of previous actions, nor the last, for its actions must be expiated in the next life following.Therefore, Samsara or phenomenal existence is without beginning and an end. But there is noSamsara for a Jivanmukta or liberated sage who is resting in his own Sat-Chit-Ananda Svarupa.40DOCTRINE OF REINCARNATION"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"When a man dies he carries with him the permanent Linga Sarira, which is made up of fiveJnana Indriyas, five karma Indriyas, five Pranas, Manas (mind), Buddhi, Chitta and Ahamkara andthe changing Karmasraya (receptacle of works), the actions of the soul, which determines theformation of the next life.Sri Jnana Dev, the reputed Yogi of Alandi, wrote his commentary on the Gita,Jnanesvari,when he was only sixteen years old. He was a born Siddha. You can also become a Siddha if you tryin right earnest. What one has attained can be achieved by another also.If a new-born child who has not done any wrong action in this birth undergoes greatsuffering, this is the fruit of some evil deed done in the previous birth. If you ask, how the personwas induced to do a wrong action in this former birth, the answer is that it was the result of somewrong action done in a birth still anterior and so on.Many intelligent fathers have sons with dull intellect. If a shepherd boy gave you some foodand water in your previous birth when you were dying of starvation, he will be born in this birth asyour son, with a dull intellect to enjoy your property.When creatures are born, they evince a desire to suck the breast and show an instinct ofterror. Therefore it follows that they remember the sucking of the breast and the pains experiencedin the previous birth. This shows that there is rebirth.Even a child exhibits Harsha (exhilaration), Soka (grief), fear, anger, pleasure and pain. TheDharma-adharma Samskaras of this birth cannot be the cause of these. The Samskaras of theprevious birth must have a support (Asraya). From this we can clearly infer the existence of Jiva inthe previous birth, and the Jiva is Anadi, or beginning-less. If you do not accept that the Jiva isAnadi, the two defects, viz., Kritanasa and Akritabhyagama will creep in. Pleasure and pain whichare the fruits of virtuous and vicious actions done previously will pass away without being enjoyed.This is Kritanasa (loss of merited reward). So also, one will have to enjoy the pleasure and pain, thefruits of good and evil actions, which were not done by him previously. This is Akritabhyagama(receiving unmerited reward). In order to get rid of these two defects, we will have to accept that theJiva is Anadi or beginningless. Else, life would be unaccountable.Some Yogic students ask me: “How long should one practise Sirshasana orPaschimottanasana or Kumbhaka or Mahamudra, to awaken Kundalini? Nothing is mentioned onthis point in any book on Yoga”. A student starts his Sadhana from the point or stage he left in hisprevious birth. That is the reason why Lord Krishna says to Arjuna: “Or he may be born in a familyof wise Yogins. There he recovereth the characteristics belonging to his former body and with thesehe again laboureth for perfection, O Joy of the Kurus” (Ch. VI: 42, 43). It all depends upon thedegree of purity, stage of evolution, the degree of purification of Nadis and the Pranayama Kosa,degree of Vairagya and yearning for liberation.Some are born with purity and other requisites of realisation on account of their havingundergone the necessary discipline in their past life. They are born Siddhas. Guru Nanak, JnanaDev, Vama Deva, Ashtavakra were all adepts from their very boyhood. Guru Nanak asked his41WHAT BECOMES OF THE SOUL AFTER DEATH"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"teacher in the school when he was a boy, about the significance of OM. Vama Deva delivered alecture on Vedanta when he was dwelling in his mother’s womb.Man does actions with the expectation of getting fruits and so he takes a birth to enjoy thefruits of his actions. In the next birth, he does some more actions and he has to take another birth. Inthis manner the Samsaric wheel is revolving from eternity to eternity. When one gets knowledge ofthe Self, he is liberated from this round of births and deaths. Karma is beginningless and Samsaraalso is beginningless. When a man does actions without expectation of fruits in selfless spirit, all thefetters of Karma get loosened gradually.Die to live. Kill this little ‘I’ and attain immortality. Live in Brahman. You will live for ever.Possess Atman. You will have eternal life. Identify yourself with your soul. You will cross theocean of death or Samsara. Rest in your Satchidananda Svarupa. You will have everlasting life.A leech moves on a blade of grass and reaches the end of the blade. It first catches hold ofanother blade with the forepart of its body and then draws its hindpart on to it. Even so, the Jivatman(individual soul) abandons the present body at the time of death, fashions the future body by histhought and then enters into that body.A good or bad deed always brings its good or bad fruits. You will find in Mahabharata: “Justas a calf finds out its mother among a thousand cows, so also an action that was performed in aprevious birth follows the doer.”Yadrisam kriyate karma tadrisam bhujyate phalam,Yadrisam vapyate, bijam tadrisam prapyate phalam.Just as the fruit corresponds to the seed that has been sown, so also the fruit of the actionsthat are performed by us correspond to the nature of the actions that we perform. This is an infalliblelaw of nature. He who has sown the seed of a mango tree cannot expect a jack fruit. He who hasdone evil actions throughout his life cannot expect happiness, peace and prosperity in his next life.“Many are the times we have been together in the past, and also been separated and so againshall it be in the future. Even as a heap of grain removed from granary to granary ever assumes neworder of arrangement and new combination, so is the case with Jiva (human being) in the universethrough his arrangement” (Yoga Vasishtha).Reincarnation Is Quite True (ii)Kamlesh Kumari Devi, alias Gita Murti, commenced preaching the Gita at the age of twoand a half years. She was born on Tuesday, the 12th of December, 1939. The ideas of thetransmigration of soul and eternity of life, although recorded in our holy scriptures, are dormant andlatent in our practical life.She used to sit in the lap of her father and pronounce the Slokas of the Gita in her brokenlanguage. She used to glance at the Gita as well. At the age of two and a half years her father, PunditDevi Dutt Sarma, took her to the garden outside Lohgarh Gate, Amritsar, where Swami42DOCTRINE OF REINCARNATION"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Krishnananda was holding discourses on the Gita. The Swami narrated the story of aneight-year-old girl at Allahabad who could recite the verses of the Gita beautifully. On hearing this,Kamlesh Kumari felt excited and forced the Swami and audience to hear her lecture on the Gita. Shedelivered her first lecture and deeply impressed the audience.Swami Krishnananda presented to her some Hindi books: Hindu Dharma, Parshisht, etc.,which she fluently read to the astonishment of the Swami. After that she delivered lectures atHaridwar, Rishikesh, Ludhiana, Jandiala Guru, Har Sahai Mandi, Mukherian, Dharma Kot,Gujranwala and other places.The other girl, Mahindra Kumari, alias Chand Rani, three and a half years old, died inTango, Burma on 15 Oct. 1939 and was reborn in Amritsar in May 1940. At the age of three and aquarter years she forced her present mother to go to the house of her previous parents. The girl wenton insisting again and again, and importuned her mother every day to accompany her to visit herreal house and real ‘Jahai’. It is rightly said that persistence prevails and is proved true in this case.At last the mother yielded, the baby led, and the mother followed her, to an unknown destination.The baby girl took her mother from Mushkal Mohalla passing through the various streets and blindcorners, brought her mother to Kucha Beriwala at the end of the street, before a house which sheclaimed as her own. When her previous life’s brother’s wife came from an adjoining house, onhearing the knocks and shouts at her door, the baby girl recognised her Jahai, and ferociouslyembraced her by clinging to her legs, and subsequently recognised her 20 year old son Siva, andother relatives and her belongings. She recognised her gold Mutter Mala, and photo of her deadbody, saying that it was she who was sleeping. At the time of her death she had great desire(Vasana) to see her brother S. Sunder Singh, and his wife, who were not present at the time of herdeath and perhaps the deep-rooted Vasana at the time of leaving her body in Burma, led her to bereborn in Amritsar, to meet her brother and his wife.Jain boy of Baroda(Statesman5 Sep. 1937): In Baroda a Jain boy of six years surprised hismother by relating the incidents of his former life. He said that he was previously at Poona ofparents who belonged to Patna. He was known as Kevalchand and later ran a drapery shop at Poona.He had business relations with several merchants at Patna. He had 6 sons, one of whom was namedRamanlal. All these were verified when the boy and his mother visited Patna.The doctrine of reincarnation is supported by Guru Nanak Dev in Guru Granth Sahib as wellas by the great philosophers of Greece such as Socrates and Plato who lived about 2400 years ago.“All our knowledge is a remembrance of what we have known only before we areborn”—Platonic doctrine of reminiscence.“We must have received our knowledge of all realities, before we were born. Our soulsexisted formerly apart from our bodies and possessed intelligence before they came into man’sshape”—Philosophy of Socrates.Bereft of the living self, this body dies, while the living self dies not; because we find thatwhen a man has fallen asleep leaving some work unfinished, when he wakes up, he remembers thathe had left the work unfinished; and also just because creatures are born, they immediately evince a43WHAT BECOMES OF THE SOUL AFTER DEATH"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"desire to suck the breast, terror, etc., it follows therefore, that they remember the sucking of thebreast, and the pains experienced in the previous birth.Reincarnation In Lower BirthsOrdinarily in most cases the soul is not willing to take birth in the lower Yonis (wombs) forthe salient reason that it has done good works in the physical body as a human being in the pastincarnation. No human being is out and out an incarnation of Lucifer. Certain good qualities andactions prompted by such good qualities always outweigh the bad qualities and their actions and thehuman being steps into another birth either low or high out of the same species for the futureevolution of the soul.The instances where the human soul should take a lower birth either as a wolf or as a pigmay be very few, just as in the physical world, a murderer awaits his exit only through the doors ofthe gallows. At the same time we cannot deny the truth of the scriptural texts, considering the lawthat every cause produces its corresponding effect.The future birth of each soul is the result of its past actions, and the theory of Karma andreincarnation plays an important part in determining the same. The law of cause and effect, actionand reaction, holds good in the case of Karma also.Generally man evolves upwards. The tendency of the evolution is to take a man to a highlevel or status. This is the natural biological law. But there are exceptions. If a man is endowed withdevilish traits or Asuric tendencies and does highly brutal acts, if he behaves worse than an animal,if he acts like a dog or a donkey or monkey, he surely does not deserve a human birth in the next life.He will take birth in the womb of animals. He will be born as a dog or a monkey or a donkey. Suchcases are, however, rare indeed.If a man does very heinous sins, he can get the maximum punishment while dwelling in thisvery physical body. In such extreme cases it is not necessary that he should wait to take the birth ofan animal. Man suffers more for his sins while remaining in the body of a man than taking an animalbirth. The sufferings of a leper, or a consumptive, a person suffering from syphilis, gonorrhoea arebeyond description.The inexorable working of this law is brought out tellingly in the very unusual andextremely interesting case cited hereunder.Tarak, aged 18 or 19, compounder of Kaviraj Mahendranath Sen of Benda, got intense colicwhich drove him unconscious. A Brahmin of Sarvavidya lineage touched with pity, put vermilionon Tarak’s forehead, uttering Mantras and praying to Mother Kali, to let him know why Tarak wassuffering so badly.Tarak roared in his unconsciousness, “I am a part of Mother Kali. Shall I not punish Tarak?In a past life he insulted his mother and his mother kicked her own husband, Tarak’s father. Bothhave been condemned to suffer for 7 births, Tarak from this terrible colic and his mother to becomea widow only fourteen days after marriage. They have had 4 births already, and 3 more to suffer.”44DOCTRINE OF REINCARNATION"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"“Is there no means of deliverance, Mother” asked the kind Brahmin.Tarak, still unconscious, replied: “There can be no deliverance unless Tarak takes‘Padodak’(the water with which feet are washed) of his mother and also‘Uchhishta’(the leavingof her food), and if his mother gives him medicine, he may be cured in this life”. On enquiringwhere Tarak’s mother was, the unconscious Tarak replied: “Gopal Sen’s widow is Tarak’smother”.Tarak came to his senses, heard everything from the Brahmin and obeyed the mandate.Tarak’s mother gave him a portion of a ‘Pan’ (betel leaf) which Tarak wore in a ‘Maduli’. Tarakwas cured straightaway.Next year the same disease returned but Tarak was cured when Tarak’s mother sprinkledher‘Padodak’.It was then found that Tarak’s ‘Maduli’ has been defiled by taking water from a ladyin her menses.Man learns lessons through bitter and painful experiences in this world. However sinful,cruel and brutal a man may be, he corrects and educates himself through sufferings, pains, sorrows,troubles and difficulties and diseases, loss of property, poverty and death of dear and near relations.God moulds and corrects the sinners in a mysterious manner. Sufferings and pain act as usefuleducative forces. They serve as eye-openers in the case of evil-doers. They check them from fallingback and pull them upwards. They begin to do good actions and seek the company of the saints.Some say that a man can never reincarnate in an animal body, as his individuality cannot beconveniently accommodated by the insufficient and incapable body of an animal. The higherprinciples of man can find no receptacle and expression in the rude, rough and imperfect habitationof the animal. The body of a creature is always an encrustation, as it were, of its inner bodies which,too, are similarly of the same shape and cast. Thus, the encrustation or body of a human soul shouldalways be human. It should correspond to the necessities, requirements and ambitions of a humansoul. It should be furnished with all the instruments of perception and conception, which a humansoul stands in need of. It should, in short, be cast upon the mould and matrix of the causal and astralbodies which generally form the plan and design of a human body. Thus a human body cannot butincarnate in a human body. The sayings of ancient writers that a cruel person will become a wolf, anavaricious person a cobra, a lustful person a bitch, etc. are all metaphorical statements. When theysay that a cruel person will reincarnate as a wolf, they mean thereby that he will be reborn as aferocious and voracious man like a wolf and similarly do other statements mean.Others hold the view that a man may try to fall back, nay, may do his best to live the life of alower animal. He may try to push out of his mind all higher and finer feelings, and if he reallysucceeds in making a monkey of himself, if he succeeds in making his desires nothing but animaldesires, and if he makes an animal of himself, then, of course, he will be born a monkey in the nextincarnation. But man cannot do that. There are other forces which prevent and keep him back.Those forces are what are called sorrow, trouble, suffering etc. They are the guaranteed agenciesagainst any falling back. These forces will not allow man to fall down; thus, progress is secured.Life of evolution is progress and progress must be made, and thus constant and continuous warfareis necessary. This is another view of others.45WHAT BECOMES OF THE SOUL AFTER DEATH"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"A human birth is the result of mixed Karmas, viz., good and bad. When good Karmasoutweigh the bad, man gets the birth of a Deva, Yaksha, Gandharva, and the like. When evil Karmasoutweigh the good, he takes birth as an animal, devil, etc. He falls into a lower birth. When good andbad Karmas are more or less equal, he gets a human birth. By good Karmas man attains heaven, bybad Karmas hell, and by mixed Karmas he attains the world of men.It is the nature of a man or a beast to get attached to the particular body in which it resides.The body of an ant is as dear to it as the body of an elephant is to an elephant or a human body is to aman. This wonderful attachment to the body arising out of ignorance keeps this wheel of birth anddeath eternally going. Of all births a particular creature likes the particular body which it has takenin the particular incarnation. A man likes a human birth; an elephant is pleased with its birth as anelephant and so on. At the same time everyone craves for evolution and attainment of unalloyedbliss. This is common for all created beings.Birth as a man is superior because he has the power to discriminate and decide for himself.He knows himself and others and he is endowed with finer emotions of love, faith, shame, decency,non-injury, etc. An animal is devoid of intelligence, memory and knowledge. Therefore, birth as ananimal is not desirable.The life of a man who is not endowed with discrimination, knowledge of the Self,non-identification with the physical body, faith and love for fellow-beings is equal to that of a beast.The ignorant man sinks in the ocean of Samsara, and takes birth in various wombs until the eye ofdiscrimination is opened, until he comes in contact with a guide who is ready to take him to a higherpath. The ignorant worldly man takes birth as a dog, a cobra, a wolf or a tiger. There is no definitelaw as regards to them. The Sastras are quite correct in their statements. It is a serious mistake totake such utterances of the scriptures as merely figurative or metaphorical.A spiritual Sadhaka who has started his life in the Divine has no fear of birth in a lowerwomb. A Yogi who practises Yoga even though he happens to fall from his entitled position is notruined. He takes birth in better circumstances once again and pursues his spiritual path. In theBhagavadgita, you will find: “O Partha, neither in this world, or in the next world is theredestruction for him (who has fallen from the path of Brahman); none verily, who does good, O myson, ever comes to grief. Having attained to the worlds of the righteous and having dwelt there foreverlasting years, he who fell from Yoga is reborn in a house of the pure and wealthy. Or he is bornin a family of even the wise Yogis” (Chapter VI—40, 41, 42).King Bharata, son of Rishabha, renounced his kingdom and took to the path of an ascetic.One day he observed a small motherless deer in the forest. He took pity on the poor creature and heso passionately loved this little one that his thoughts were mainly centred on the deer and thoughtsof God gradually waned away. At the time of his death the thought of the small deer harassed himmuch and he took the birth of a deer.King Bharata was well versed in all the scriptures, Vedas and Puranas. He did very rigorousTapas and meditated on the lotus-feet of the glorious Vasudeva. But the inordinate attachment tothe animal gave him the birth of a deer. Bharata opened his eyes and recognised his folly. The deerremembered every detail of the past life as King Bharata. It ever meditated on the Lord, ate but little46DOCTRINE OF REINCARNATION"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"and never mixed with other deers of its type. It was actually counting the number of days of its lifeto get freedom from the low birth. The deer after leaving its body again took the birth of a Brahminknown by the name Jada Bharata. Now Jada Bharata grew wise enough as not to commit the samemistake once again and from his very boyhood kept himself aloof. He had a mind free fromattraction and repulsion. Thus he escaped the clutches of Maya and at the dissolution of his mortalsheath attained oneness with the Paramatman.Gajendra, though he had to take the birth of an elephant, never forgot his real nature andever prayed to Lord Hari and attained emancipation from the life of an elephant itself. The Sastrasquote instances where animals and even birds have attained emancipation. Vritrasura, the greatRakshasa, was highly devoted to Vasudeva. He was King Chitraketu in his past birth who wascursed by Uma to become a Rakshasa.From the foregoing examples it is quite clear that for a true and sincere Sadhaka there is nofear of downfall. Devotees of the Lord become absolutely fearless and they are devoid of all desires.They welcome any birth in which the Lord can be remembered.What is wanted is real devotion to the Lord. That being achieved, a man becomes happy inany sort of life and under any circumstances. He gets a peculiar joy which helps him to bear even themost excruciating pain of Samsara.The Rishis of yore had power to curse wicked persons and bless the virtuous. The sons ofKubera became trees by the curse of Narada. Gautama cursed his wife Ahalya to become a stone.They do this out of compassion for those who go astray, leaving the feet of Lord Hari. It is not withany selfish motive or by becoming a victim to anger that they curse the wicked. Therefore, contactwith a saintly personality is highly beneficial in changing one’s destiny.Rishis are Trikalajnanis (knowers of the past, present and future). Therefore, they know themysterious ways of Karma. They attained knowledge of the Self and by virtue of this knowledgeeverything else became known to them. The kind of body into which one enters depends on thepattern of the mind which is its causative factor. The law is inexorable.It does not matter much what kind of body we wear. It matters much what our thoughts are.A man of high position may have the thoughts of a beast. When he becomes a prey to lust and anger,he is worse than an animal. A cow is a thousand times better than such a man who is devoid ofdiscrimination, who indulges in vulgar enjoyments, who loses his temper for trifles.Do not worry yourself as to what birth you will take in the future. Utilise the present lifeprofitably and free yourself from death and birth. Develop devotion to the Lord. Renounce basedesires. Be ever intent on doing good to others. Be kind and do good.Lord Hari is the protector of the three worlds. The responsibility of taking every one of Hiscreation to His immortal abode rests with Him. Let Him take you through any path He likes. LetHim give you Mukti when you are in the body of a man, a beast or a devil. Let your mind be evercentred on Him and cling to His lotus-feet like the bee that sticks to a full-blown lotus. Drink thesweet honey flowing from His lotus-feet and surrender yourself to Him like a child.47WHAT BECOMES OF THE SOUL AFTER DEATH"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"May you all become free from this ever-revolving wheel of Karma resulting in numerousbirths in various wombs and attain the bliss of the Immortal in this very life.Development Of The ChildHaving fallen from the lunar orb, and mixed with vapour, one comes down upon earth; therehe remains in rice and the rest, for a long time, says the Chhandogya Upanishad.Then he becomes the fourfold kind of food and is eaten by man and becoming the vital seed,is thrown by man into the womb of the woman when the season comes.*There in the mother’s womb mixed with blood and enveloped in the outer skin of theembryo, he becomes what is known as ‘Kalal’ in one day.On the expiration of five nights he becomes a budbud (bubble).

These vibrations come against the body whichimprisons the individual soul, and break it for its freedom.Do you realise now the importance of Sraaddha? Those who have left doing Sraaddha onaccount of ignorance, perversion of intellect caused by wrong Samskaras and bad association andhearing of wrong teaching should perform Sraaddha from this moment at least. Rishis and Sastrastake care of you like kind mothers.If you do not wish to enter the Preta Loka and undergo the sufferings, learn to be wise. Learnto control the senses. Lead a well-regulated and disciplined life. Do not allow the senses to run riot.Give up gluttony. Do not follow the philosophy of flesh. Passions and appetites will only tormentyou when you pass through death. If you practise self-restraint, you will enter the regions of bliss.Experience Of PretasSage Vasishtha says in the Yoga-Vasishtha:“The Pretas are of six kinds, namely, the slightly sinful, the ordinarily sinful, the greatlysinful, the slightly virtuous, the ordinarily virtuous, and the greatly virtuous. Some of the mostsinful Pretas continue to be experiencing the insensibility of death like a stone for a period of a year.Regaining awareness they experience that they are doomed to suffer from the endless torments of50LOKAS OR PLANES"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"hell which their Vasanas have brought them, for a long time. They then undergo the experience ofhundreds of incarnations until they finally get rid of the experience of world-illusion, by findingpeace within. There are others in this class, who, after their torpor of death is over, begin toexperience the unutterable pain of insensibility in the form of immovable trees, etc. Then theyundergo the torments of hell, after which they are again born on earth in accordance with theirearthly desires. Those of ordinary sin experience the inertness of stone for some time after death.Being awakened to consciousness, they, then or after some time, undergo the experience of the livesof birds, reptiles or beasts, before they turn to their usual lives in the world. The slightly sinful souls,often immediately after the insensibility of death, come to assume some human form to continuetheir earthly existence in accordance with their previous desires. They come to the worldlyconsciousness soon after their death and their previous desires and imagination evolve new worldsin their experience in a dream-like manner. The greatly virtuous souls, soon after the insensibility ofdeath is over, get an experience in the worlds of gods. Having enjoyed the fruits of their virtues ingodly personality and in heavenly worlds, they are again born in this world in noble and richfamilies. The souls of ordinary virtuous experience, after the insensibility of death is over, that theyare being carried away by winds and later on are turned into the lives of plants and herbs. Havingundergone this experience for some time they feel that they are entering human bodies as food, andthere they are turned into spermatozoa and thence enter the wombs of (expectant) mothers.”Pitri LokaThis is also known by the name of Chandraloka, wherein the forefathers, or Pitris, live. Thisis also a heaven. Those who perform sacrifices and charitable deeds with selfish motives(Ishtapurtam), such as digging wells, building rest-houses and laying out parks or gardens for thepublic, enter this Loka. The ruler of this world is Lord Yama, son of Surya. The Jivas come back tothis world after the fruits of their actions have been exhausted. Lord Krishna says in the Gita:“Smoke, night time, the dark fortnight (also the six months of the southern path of the sun) attainingby these to the lunar light, the Yogi returns” (Chap. VIII-25). When they die, they first go throughsmoke, then to night, then to the dark fifteen days, then to the six months when the sun goes to theSouth, and from that they go to the world of their fathers. This path is called by the name Pitriyana,or the path of Pitris.The Pitris are highly pleased when their descendants offer oblations and when they performSraaddha on the anniversary day, they bless them.In Chandraloka, the Jivas acquire fine, brilliant bodies, the bodies of gods. They becomegods and enjoy the happiness of heaven for a long period. They live with their forefathers. Theycome down through the spheres of air and clouds. They reach the world through rain-drops. Theyattach themselves to some cereal or grain, which is eaten by some man, who is fit to give themmaterial to make a new body. Those whose deeds have been very good take birth in good families.The heaven of the Fathers, or Pitri Loka, or Chandraloka is not the highest abode of eternalTruth. It is a phenomenal universe. The dwellers of that Loka or plane are bound by the law ofKarma, by the rule of cause and effect, by the law of action and reaction. Their stay on that plane istemporary although it may last for thousands of years.51WHAT BECOMES OF THE SOUL AFTER DEATH"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"The Pitris have no knowledge of Brahman or the Imperishable Reality. They are bound bydesires. They cannot teach Brahma-Vidya to others as they themselves are imperfect.Lord Krishna says in the Bhagavad-Gita:“The knowers of the three Vedas, the Soma-drinkers, the purified from sin, worshipping Mewith sacrifice, pray to Me the way to heaven; they, ascending to the holy world of the Ruler of theShining Ones, eat in heaven the divine feasts of the Shining Ones.”“They, having enjoyed the spacious heaven-world, their holiness withered, come back tothis world of death. Following the virtues enjoined by the three, desiring desires, they obtain thetransitory.”“They who worship the Shining Ones go to the Shining Ones; to the ancestors go theancestor-worshippers; to the Elements go those who sacrifice to Elements; but My worshipperscome unto Me.”Even the dwellers of the highest heavens are subject to the laws of rebirth and reincarnation.He alone is free from birth and rebirth and transcends all phenomena who, after knowing theAbsolute Truth, after realising the Supreme Soul, becomes one with Brahman, the Absolute.Heaven Or SvargaThe conception of heaven of the Hindus is different from that of the Christians or of theMohammedans. The heaven of the Hindus is a place where the departed souls go to reap the fruits oftheir virtuous deeds. They remain there for some time till the fruits of their virtuous actions areexhausted. Then they come back to this world. They eat in heaven the divine feasts of the ShiningOnes or the Devas. They move in celestial cars. Indra is the Lord of heaven or Svarga. Variouskinds of Devas (gods) dwell here. Celestial damsels like Urvasi, Rambha dance here. TheGandharvas sing. There is no disease here. There is no trouble of hunger and thirst. The inhabitantsare endowed with a brilliant subtle body. They are adorned with shining garments. Heaven is athought-world, a realm of intense ideations. Whatever one wishes, he gets it at once, by immediatematerialisation. So it is a happier world than the earth-plane.The Christians, Mohammedans and Zoroastrians believe in heaven of different kinds. InMohammedanism, the departed souls pass through the bridge Al Sirat. The faithful ones who havedone virtuous deeds reach the Paradise which is situated in heaven. The Mohammedan conceptionof Paradise is that of a beautiful garden, furnished with springs, fountains and rivers flowing withwater, milk, honey and balsam. There are trees having trunks of gold and yielding the mostdelicious fruits. There are seventy effulgent, beautiful girls called Hur-ul-ayun with big black eyes.The Jews and the Zoroastrians also have a similar conception of heaven.The Paradises of the Zoroastrians are known by the names Bihisht and Minu. The personswho have done good deeds in the earth-plane enjoy the company of Huran-i-bihisht or black-eyeddamsels of Paradise, who are under the care of the angel Zamiyad. The name for heaven is52LOKAS OR PLANES"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Garo-de-mana (Garot—man in the Persian) or house of hymns. The angels sing hymns here, just asGandharvas sing in the heaven of the Hindus.The Jews and the Parsis believe in seven Heavens. The heaven of Eden is composed ofprecious stones. There is a resemblance between the garden of Eden and the Paradise ofZoroastrians. The two trees in Eden, the tree of knowledge and the tree of life, correspond to thepainless tree and the Gao Karena bearing the white Roama.The Parsis, the Christians and Mohammedans believe that heaven is eternal and permanent.All enjoyments come to them incessantly without any pain and difficulty.Heaven is a place of mental and sensual enjoyment. The enjoyments in heaven are moreintense, subtle and refined. But they cannot give everlasting peace and real eternal bliss. They wearout the senses. A wise man with discrimination and dispassion will never crave for the enjoymentsof heaven. He will never dream to have an abode in heaven. There is jealousy; there is Raga-Dvesha(likes and dislikes) in heaven. Demons fight with gods. Real, thirsty aspirants should ruthlesslyignore heaven. They should yearn for the final emancipation, or Moksha.Every man builds up his own heaven according to his own desires and imaginations. Everyman has his own idea of pleasures. Pleasures are always changing. A drunkard dreams of a heavenwhere there are rivers of wine. This would be a very bad heaven for a sober, pious man. A youngman dreams of a heaven where he will have celestial damsels, celestial cars, fine music and dance.When that man becomes old, he does not want a woman. It is your necessities and desires that makeyour heaven. Your heaven is the counterpart of your desires.You have no idea of real eternal bliss of the Soul. Your mind whirls in sensual pleasures.That is the reason why you are carried away by thoughts of heaven or paradise. Have a clearunderstanding of the nature of the Soul. You will have no craving for the enjoyments of heaven. TheAtman or the Soul is an ocean of bliss. The ocean of bliss or the fountain of joy is within you.Withdraw the senses. Look within. Fix the mind on the Soul. All sensual desires will melt. You willbe immersed in the ocean of bliss.The period for which you live in heaven depends upon the degree of your meritorious deeds.You can become an Indra or Lord of the heaven if you like. Indrahood is a position. The Indra whohad lived before is not the Indra of the present day. Countless Indras have come and gone.When man becomes disgusted with the world around him through miseries, sorrows,disappointments, failures, loss of property, diseases, and death of dearest relatives, he thinks that hewould go to some place where there would be all happiness for ever without any misery or pain,where he would live with his forefathers with a perfect body. So he creates heaven or Svarga. Howcan there be eternal happiness in a finite plane conditioned in time and space? Eternal bliss andimmortality can be found in your own Atman, the Self only.A life in heaven is very much the same sort of life you lead here, only a little happier. Youhave comfortable living there, but it is not eternal life of everlasting bliss. Further, you will have tocome down to earth-plane, when the fruits of good actions are exhausted. Heaven is not a53WHAT BECOMES OF THE SOUL AFTER DEATH"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"permanent abode. Everything which has name and form must perish. Atman or Soul only isimmortal and eternal. That is the reason why sages and thirsty aspirants after Truth do not long forthe enjoyments of heaven.The Vedanta does not attach any special value to heaven. It teaches that these heavens arephenomenal and transitory. Even if one dwells in heaven for millions of years, these millions ofyears are nothing before eternity.Lord Jesus says, “The Kingdom of Heaven is within you.” Vedanta also tells the same thing.Real everlasting happiness can be attained by realising one’s own Atman or the Immortal Soul.Eternal bliss is within. Perennial joy is in your own innermost Self. The little pleasure that you getfrom objects is only reflection of the bliss of the Soul. It is a particle of that real, eternal bliss ofSoul.Man sees God face to face. He lives in God. There is no intervening veil or limitationbetween him and the Lord. He lives in absolute and complete oneness with Him. He is ever blissful.This is Heaven.From the transcendental viewpoint, there is neither heaven nor hell. They are creations ofpsycho-physical necessities. If your mind is filled with Sattva, you are in heaven. If Tamas andRajas preponderate in your mind, you are in hell.When a man who has done meritorious actions dies, he becomes a Deva or god and dwells inheaven. He enjoys various kinds of pleasures in heaven. During his period of stay in heaven he doesnot do any fresh Karma or action. Dwelling in heaven is simply a reward for his past good actions.In the Deva form he does not perform any Karma at all.Abandon the idea of heaven. The idea of obtaining eternal happiness in heaven is a vaindream. It is a puerile idea. Seek the eternal bliss in your own Atman through meditation. You are theImmortal Soul, free, eternal; you are ever pure, ever blessed. Assert your birth-right. Proclaim yourfreedom and be what you really are, ever free, ever blessed. Everything in time, space and causationis bound. The soul is beyond all time, all space, all causation.‘Tat Tvam Asi’,Thou art That, mychild. Realise this and be ever happy.Lord Buddha says: “Many thousand myriads of systems of worlds beyond this is a region ofbliss called Sukhavati. This region is encircled within seven rows of railings, seven rows of vastcurtains, seven rows of waving trees. This holy abode of the Arhats is governed by the Tathagatasand is occupied by the Bodhisattvas. It has seven precious lakes, in the midst of which flowcrystalline waters having seven and yet one distinctive properties and qualities. This, O Sariputra, isthe Devachan. Its divine Udambara flower casts a root in the shadow of every earth, and blossomsfor all those who reach it. Those born in this blessed region—who have crossed the golden bridgeand reached the seven golden mountains—they are truly felicitous; there is no more grief or sorrowin that cycle for them.”Only persons who have earned great merits on earth can go to heaven. The heaven is wellprovided with excellent paths. It is always frequented by celestial cars. Atheists and untruthful54LOKAS OR PLANES"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"persons, those who have not lived a life of asceticism and those who have not performed greatsacrifices, cannot go there.Only virtuous souls and those of subdued minds, those who have controlled their senses,those who are free from malice, those intent on the practice of charity, and heroes and men bearingmarks of battle and who have performed the most meritorious acts, attain to the celestial regions.The celestial regions can be attained only by virtuous acts. The celestial regions are inhabited bypious men. They bestow every object of desire. The Siddhas, the Visvas, the Gandharvas, theApsaras, the Yamas and the Dharmas dwell there. There is that foremost of mountains, the goldenMeru, extending to thirty thousand Yojanas. There are many celestial gardens. The Nandana gardenis the most beautiful one. Here sport the persons of meritorious acts. Neither hunger nor thirst,neither heat nor cold, neither grief nor fatigue, neither labour nor repentance, neither fear noranything that is disgusting and inauspicious is found here. There is no old age either.Delightful fragrance is found everywhere. The breeze is gentle and pleasant. Theinhabitants have resplendent bodies. Delightful sounds captivate both the ear and the mind. Theseworlds are obtained by meritorious acts, and not by birth or the merits of fathers and mothers.There is neither sweat nor stench, nor excretion, nor urine. The dust does not soil one’sclothes. There is no uncleanliness of any kind. Garlands do not fade. Excellent garments, full ofcelestial fragrance, never fade. There are countless celestial cars that move in the air. The dwellersare free from envy, grief, ignorance and malice. They live very happily.Such is the bliss of heaven. But the disadvantages of heaven are great indeed. In the celestialregion, a person, while enjoying the fruits of acts he had already performed, cannot perform anyother new act. He must enjoy the fruits of the former life till they are completely exhausted. Furtherhe is liable to fall after he has completely exhausted his merit. These are the disadvantages ofheaven. The consciousness of those about to fall is stupefied. It is also agitated by emotions. As thegarlands of those about to fall fade away, fear possesses their hearts.But there is one world where there are no such disadvantages. It is the supreme seat ofVishnu, above the abode of Brahma, which is pure, eternal and effulgent. It is known by the name ofPara Brahman. Persons who are addicted to sensual objects or those who are subject to arrogance,covetousness, ignorance, anger and envy cannot go to that place. Those men who are free fromconflicting emotions and those who have restrained their senses and those who are given tomeditation and Yoga can go there.Men who enjoy heaven suffer great misery and extreme regret in this world. Therefore donot desire to go to heaven. Try to reach that supreme abode of eternal bliss from where there will beno fall. Seek that unfailing region, going to which people have not to lament, or to be pained, or tobe agitated.Practise Jnana Yoga. Engage yourself in constant meditation on Para Brahman or theSupreme Self. Attain knowledge of the Imperishable and obtain the supreme state of emancipation,which is eternal. Then censure and praise will become equal to you. A brick, a stone and a piece ofgold—all will become the same to you.55WHAT BECOMES OF THE SOUL AFTER DEATH"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Hell Or NarakaIt is common nowadays to hear it said that the Puranas are very unreliable scriptures and thatthey indulge in unlimited exaggeration about very many things. These critics say that the Puranascontain gross overstatements and preposterously puerile attempts to cajole or to cow down thereader with citations like the grandiose descriptions of heavenly regions and their joys as also theawful pictures of hell-fires and their torments. To criticise a subject requires a very little wit orwisdom. For simple and direct condemnation without caring to consider the pros and cons of amatter is the inborn nature of the human mind. But even to these biased ones a little thoughtfulconsideration will forthwith reveal that the sagely writers of the Puranas had a special purpose inwriting certain things in the manner they did. They deliberately emphasised and laid particularstress upon some subjects with a definite end in view. Underneath these graphic and detaileddescriptions of the Karmas and their consequences there is a shrewd psychology and insight beingput to make a practical purpose.Until and unless Self-realisation is attained, Knowledge-Absolute is gained, there is everthe ebb and flow, the constant see-saw between the animal and the man in every human being. Thebeast or the brute is never completely absent or overcome except through a final Divinisation of theindividual. As long as there is the human, side by side there will be the animal also, now the onehaving the upper hand, now the other. It is only when the Jiva gets above and beyond both these andgets transformed and established in the third and hitherto dormant aspect of his nature, namely theDivine aspect, that he becomes ‘Mriga-Nara-Atita’, transcending both the sub-human and humanlimitations. Then onwards there is no more of this tug-of-war between the animal and man naturesto gain precedence and dominate over the field of Jiva-consciousness. For now the DivineKshetrajna Himself reigns supreme over the Kshetra.Until this state is attained, therefore, we find that man is in turn animal and human accordingto theVrittithat possesses him. He shows himself alternately to be noble and petty. He swingsbetween the sublime and the ridiculous. His two different aspects react to the external stimuli intheir own distinctive manners. And equally likewise only particular modes of external approachsucceed in evoking the desired response from these dual aspects in man’s consciousness. Thus it isthat we find in persons who have evolved themselves to some fair extent and acquired a goodmeasure of Sattva, or refinement, culture and character, the purely gross and degenerate impulsesand temptations fail to have effect. They succeed only in exceptional situations when the personunfortunately happens to be in some rare moment of weakness due to a revival of Samskaras.Whereas in gross natures such temptations readily and immediately work havoc, and vice versa,noble impulses immediately influence a fine nature but fail to evoke any response in a gross personof low animal mentality. This has given rise to the proverb in the Marathi language, “To thecobbler’s deity worship is by shoes,” or again the current Tamil saying, “Without the cane themonkey will not dance.” The same is the case with noble sentiments too, as is simply exemplifiedby the over-careful psychology applied by the famous Dr. Arnold of Rugby in appealing to theworthier instincts in his boys. No less striking is the historic example of Mark Antony skilfullyexercising his persuasive and provocatory eloquence to his Roman audience, first to evokecompassion by playing subtly upon their human side, and then rousing a frenzy of revengefulviolence by inflaming their strong animal passion of anger.56LOKAS OR PLANES"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"It is this deep human insight and admirable penetrating psychology that is at the basis of theHell and Retribution ideas in the Puranic Hindu Religion. They knew that sweet whistling will notmake the buffalo move, whereas whipping will. We know how on the eve of building the greatbridge to Lanka, when requests failed to make the Ocean-King behave suitably, Rama took out anarrow in anger. The very next instant had the Sagara-Raja pleading with folded hands before Rama.Likewise to goad man on to noble deeds, high aspiration and righteous conduct, the Puranic sagesheld out before him bright prospects and extolled the untold benefits and blessings of a good life.Here they tried to appeal to man’s human side. But when he indulged in extreme sin and bestial actsof gross sensuality, they knew that it was not the occasion for mincing matters. The beast could onlybe chastened through a true and vivid description of the inevitable results of his actions. Here wemust note that they did not exaggerate or utter any falsehood, but gave a special importance toemphasise the matter by dilating upon it in graphic detail and spared no pains in doing this. Theytherefore confronted the Jiva with a terrific array of dire consequences that would inevitably accrueto the evil actions of the sinner. They gave graphic descriptions of the various punishments awaitingthe wanton transgressor of moral and spiritual laws. They vividly related past instances oftransgressors and the retribution that overtook them to testify to this truth. The Puranas abound infearful examples of life-long sufferings in lower wombs suffered by people like Nahusha, Jaya andVijaya, the well-known Gajendra and many others.They do not stop with that. As though it were not enough to give instances of the fruits ofpositive sinful actions and crimes, they cite certain cases when even the indulgence in acomparatively harmless, good emotion like affection, brings about grave suffering upon man. Thewarning implied in the story of the past lives of Sage Jadabharata is an instance in point. Also theaccidental participation in a seeming falsehood was enough to send a soul to behold though but for amoment, the awful hell-fire. The incident of the great Yudhishthira’s vision of Hell is referred tohere.Fortunately or unfortunately, out of the numerous Puranas very few are studied by the vastmajority now-a-days. Those few devoted people that read the Puranas or listen to their recital rarelygo beyond the four or five classical Saivite and Vaishnavite Puranas that are currently popularthroughout the country. We may say that Purana perusal is generally confined to the Skanda,Markandeya, Vishnu or the Srimad Bhagavata. It is not the scholar or the orthodox Brahmin sectionthat is meant here but the common man-in-the-street who goes to form a distinct and important partof the population. Thus this whip-crack of the Karma and Karma-phala citation does not soundnowadays to chasten the sensual beast in man. And as a result of this it is running amuck as neverheretofore. But laws, be they mundane or divine, are inexorable. The ignorance of the Penal Codedoes not lay a premium on indulgence in crime nor does the offender go scot-free. He burgles andhe gets jailed. He murders and is hanged. Likewise he also sins and suffers. If this truth of theinescapable order of the cosmic Law is placed before him in unvarnished and distinct outline it mayserve just a little bit to persuade him to give up vice and follow virtue, to renounce Adharma andembrace Dharma. It has purposes confined mainly to the physical and mental forms that thisheavenly retribution takes, and also to the forms it takes upon this earth-plane. For modern man isheld by the motto “seeing is believing” and he hardly requires to give a second glance to show theterrible truth of the price man pays in hospitals and clinics for the crimes against Dharma.57WHAT BECOMES OF THE SOUL AFTER DEATH"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"The diseases we suffer from the births we get here on earth are all products of actions doneby us in previous times. Every action has its reaction and no action goes unrewarded in suitablemanner. Evil actions do not go without their bitter effects upon the doer.Hells are not imaginary fiction as ordinarily conceived of by the modern rationalistic mind.The empiricist believes only in experience of sense-contact and feels himself unable to rise abovethe dictates of the intellect. But it does not mean that man has reason to overlook facts beyond hiscomprehension. We have no right to assert that this globe of earth is the most concrete reality andthat others are mere apparitions. The stars do not become mere spots with a twinkling light in thesky merely for the reason that we perceive them to be so. If I have not seen America I have no rightto deny the existence of such a country. There are evidences, both intuitional and rational, for us toaccept the existence of worlds beyond, which are entirely different both in nature and size. TheYogavasishtha says that our earth is only an atom among many other larger worlds existing beyondour perception and is of one particular variety among many others which differ from it in every way.We have no authority to discard the account given by Vasishtha that there exist worlds which aremade of different materials like, copper, iron, gold, etc., filled with water, milk and the like andinhabited by serpents, animals, devils, and so on. It is not necessary that human beings alone shouldinhabit all worlds and that the same earthly conditions should prevail in all planes of existence. Theuniverse is a gradual revelation of the Infinite Absolute in various degrees of Consciousness, whichis inclusive of every sort of life and experience. The Infinite is a great Wonder and we cannot saywhat things are thriving in Its womb! We and our world are but one among the many in It! There aremany families in Infinity, and earth, hell, heaven, men, animals, gods, devils, are all Its childrenwith varying temperaments. The Absolute ranges from lowest matter to Pure Bliss or Ananda, andbetween these exist the countless universes with their contents. They differ both in their individualnature and in the nature of their contents. It is said that beings take birth in one or the other of theseworlds in accordance with their actions which bear fruits of a kind that can be reaped only in thatparticular world. Only fire can give heat and only food can appease hunger. Even so only aparticular condition and environment enables us to reap the fruits of a specific action. Thoughpunishments need not necessarily be due to the wrath of any personal Divine Being, it can beasserted that it is necessary, by the very law of nature, that the soul should manifest itself with abody suited for its experience determined by its past actions. As such, it is not unreasonable thatvariety in the nature of worlds should be real. We have to remember that the real is unseen.Hells, therefore, are as much real worlds as the regions of Indra or this mortal earth of ours.They are regions with difference only in the subtlety of the plane of their manifestation. They differin the degree of the state of Consciousness revealed through them. The sufferings inflicted on thesinners may be taken to mean either an actual birth in such regions, or a life on earth with suchentanglements, where one will undergo such pains either directly or through the agency of others.In the Vedas and Vedanta there is no mention of hell. The Puranas only speak of hell orplace of torture. From the absolute viewpoint, there is neither heaven nor hell. From the relativeviewpoint, hell is as much real as this world. For a man of discrimination, the world also is a hell.Hell and heaven, though not absolutely real, are not unreal as long as individuality persists, and areas much as any plane of existence.58LOKAS OR PLANES"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Christians and Mohammedans speak of eternal hell. There cannot be eternal damnation oreternal punishment. The life of a wicked man here is nothing when compared with eternal life. Ifthere is an eternal damnation into the fire, it means that there is an infinite effect produced by a finitecause. This cannot be.The different torments of hell, the seven compartments into which it is said to be divided,and the partition called Al Airat separating heaven from hell according to Mohammedanism, allseem to be adapted from the Jews.Hindu Puranas have been very clear on the question of heaven and hell. Writers oflaw-books or Smritis, like Yajnavalkya and Vishnu, have given serious description of the varioushells and the various pleasures of heaven. Yogi Yajnavalkya mentions 21 hells in his law book, viz.,Raurava, Kumbhipaka, Maharaurava, Tamisra, Andha Tamisra, etc. The author of Vishnu Smritialso has written the same thing. A hell is a region of sharp, severe, intense pain. The evil-doerssuffer for a period. Bad action is worked out in that state and then the evil-doers come back toearth-plane. They get another chance.The Ruler of Hell is Lord Yama. He is assisted by Chitragupta. Hell is a particular localitywhich is walled off from the surrounding regions of space by the messengers of Yama. Sinners get athick body called ‘Yatana-Deha’ when they are punished. The punishment in hell is notremembered by the soul when it is reborn. The punishment in hell is reformatory and educative. Thepermanent educative effect remains in conscience. The innate fear which some souls feel at thesight of temptation of sin is due to the finer development of conscience in the furnace of hell-fire.This is the permanent gain acquired by the soul. The soul is reborn with keener conscience afterbeing purified by hell-fire. He can make better use of his faculties in the next birth.The Jewish belief in a future life in Heaven and Hell coincides in all its detail with what wefind in the Zend Avesta and is borrowed from it. There is a similarity in the Parsi and Jewishaccounts of hell and its sevenfold divisions. The doctrine of eternal reward and punishment of theJews is also borrowed from Zend Avesta. Gatha Ushtavaiti says: “The soul of the righteous attainsto immortality, but that of the wicked man has everlasting punishment. Such is the rule of AhuraMazda whose the creatures are.”If the mind is filled with Rajas and Tamas, this state is hell only. Prison is physical hell only.To live in this cage of flesh without practising Japa and meditation is hell only.Repentance for sin with a contrite heart is the highest Prayaschitta or expiation. The evileffects of sins are exhausted by repentance. Fasting, charity, penance, Japa, meditation, Kirtandestroy all sins. Thus a man may save himself from the pains of hell.Lord Krishna says in the Gita: “Triple is the gate of this hell, destruction of the Self—lust,anger and greed; therefore let man renounce these three” (XVI-21). You do various wicked deedswhen you are under the influence of anger, lust and greed. If you control these three evil Vrittis, youenjoy everlasting peace. Cultivate the opposite virtues: forgiveness, purity and generosity; theseevil traits will die by themselves.59WHAT BECOMES OF THE SOUL AFTER DEATH"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Karmas And HellsThere are varieties of hells that a Jiva has to experience in accordance with the Karmaswhich he does through sin and passion. Twenty-nine kinds of regions of sufferings are described inthe Bhagavata, when Jivas are said to be born due to their Karmas.There is a place of suffering called Tamisra (darkness). Those people who lay hands onanother’s wealth, children and wives, are born in this region. The Jiva experiences there extremepain being bound with mortal cords and violently hurled into the dark regions. He has no food ordrink. He is beaten with clubs, and by holding out threats and being brought to a state of wearyaffliction, the Jiva drops down in a swoon.There is another region called Andhatamisra (blinding darkness). Here Jivas are born whodeceive husbands and appropriate to themselves their wives and other property. Such Jivas are castdown into this hell to suffer torments where they lose all understanding and sense through excessivepain. The Jiva suffers like a tree whose roots are cut.Those who grossly identify themselves with this physical body and regard the wealth of theworld as their own, fall into a hell called Raurava. Those people who torment people here on earthbecome subject to the torment of poisonous worms called Rurus in this dangerous region.Maharaurava is one of the same type. Those men who indulge in passions are eaten here bycarnivorous (flesh-eating) animals.In the hell called Kumbhipaka, dreadful fiends begin to boil in oil that cruel and mercilessperson who cooks and eats living animals, birds and the like.He is thrown into a hell called Kalasutra who insults spiritual men, Brahmins and Pitris. Heis placed on the surface of burning copper, forty thousand miles in extent and constantly heated byfire below and the sun above, and being tormented by hunger and thirst, undergoes untold misery.There is a hell called Asipatravana. This is a forest full of leaves made out of sharp daggers.The Jiva is made to run through the forest and is hunted like a beast. He who goes against the VedicDharma, who embraces infidelistic religions are thrown here. Oh! pitiable sight indeed! He runsthis way and that way and has every part of his body torn up in those dreadful woods of sword. TheJiva cries out, “Ah! I am undone” and falls down in agony.Kings who inflict punishment on innocent men, or who inflict corporeal punishment to aBrahmin, fall into the hell called Sukara-Mukha.

In the mental plane or heaven he does nothear, see and feel by separate and finite organs. He gets a Divya Chakshus or divine eye, anextraordinary new power or faculty. He can hear, see, feel and know everything of an objectinstantaneously, through this new mental eye. He gets an accurate and perfect knowledge of allobjects. He is not deceived or misled by any external appearance. There is no misunderstanding.In the mind all the powers of all the senses are blended. Mind is a mixture or compound ofall the organs. It can hear, see, taste, smell and feel.He can get everything by mere Sankalpa or willing. If he thinks of a celestial car, it is therebefore him at once. If he thinks of a place, he is there immediately. If he thinks of a person, he isbefore him at once. There is no distance for him. There is no feeling of separation for him. He readsthe thoughts of others. Hence, questions and answers are not necessary in the mental plane. Theinterchange of ideas is very quick.He can know the past and the future also. He is endowed with clairvoyance andclairaudience. He can simultaneously manifest himself in various forms.Heaven is a plane of enjoyment only. It is a place to reap the fruits of one’s good Karmasdone in the earth-plane. One cannot do fresh Karmas there. He cannot attain Moksha or the finalemancipation from there. He will have to come down to this earth again for trying for his salvation.Indra, Varuna, Agni, etc., are the original Devatas or gods of heaven. There areKarma-Devas also here.

It is the attitude thatworks.The Stay In Supra-Physical PlanesINTERVAL BETWEEN DEATH AND REBIRTHPeople wish to know the exact period that elapses from the time of leaving the body andbeing born again. Does the soul take a new body in one year? Does it take ten years? How long doesone live upon the subtler planes before reappearing on the earth-plane? These are some of thequestions. Now, there is no definite period of time in this matter. In main two factors decide thisissue viz., the nature of the individual Karma and the last impression before death. It may vary fromhundreds of years to a few months even. Those that work out some of their Karmas in other planesin subtler regions, take a considerable time before entering a fresh body. The interval is very long,for a year of the earth period passes off as a single day on the celestial plane. There is an instancecited, where, seeing the amazement and admiration of foreign tourists at the imposing ruins ofcertain ancient monuments, a saint present in the vicinity remarked that some of these very peoplehave fashioned these monuments centuries ago. Now they look in amazement upon their ownhandiwork.A very sensual individual with strong craving or one with intense attachment sometimes isreborn quickly. Also in cases where life is cut short by a violent death or a sudden unexpectedaccident, the Jiva resumes the thread very soon. This was so in the case of the Amritsar girl,Mahindra Kumari. She was born within 7 months of her death in October, 1939. So strong was herdesire to see her brother at the time of death. Usually in such cases of immediate rebirth, the Jivaoften remembers many of the events of its previous life. It recognises its former relatives andfriends and identifies old home and familiar objects. This sometimes leads to very queer73WHAT BECOMES OF THE SOUL AFTER DEATH"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"developments. There are some instances where a murdered person, being reborn, has declared themanner of death and revealed the identity of the killer in the recent past.Thus, for instance,Dharmarajyareported (23 Mar. 1936) that in a village in Gwalior, avillage Patwari offended one Thakur Chotey Lal by making some false entries in the village-recordsprejudicial to the latter’s interest. To avenge the wrong the Thakur trapped the Patwari in anambush, shot him in the chest and severed the fingers of his right hand. Some time later, a son wasborn to a person at a place 14 miles from the scene of murder. The child had a gun-shot-mark on hischest with the fingers of the right hand missing. When the child could speak, the father one dayasked him if the Creator had forgotten to make the fingers. The child at once replied that Chotey LalThakur had shot him in the chest and severed the fingers and gave details of the incident, whichwere then verified.A reincarnated individual had at times unerringly gone and uncovered the treasure that hadbeen hidden away by him or her. In the vast majority this memory is not present. This is really ablessing conferred by the all-wise Being. Such recollection would greatly complicate our presentlives. The past is veiled to you until such time as it is good and helpful to remember it. When youattain perfection and reach the end of a cycle, all will be revealed and you will see a whole rosary oflives threaded upon the one personality.But such cases of immediate rebirth are not common. Generally for an average individualthe interval between death and rebirth happens to be a considerable period measured in terms ofearth time. Persons who have done much good Karmas spend a great deal of time in the celestialplane before being born again. Great souls, spiritually advanced persons, wait for a long time beforereincarnating.In the intervening period between death and new birth the departed spirit, specially if theperson is psychically and spiritually developed, can frequently materialise upon the earth-plane ifnecessity arises. It takes human form, talks, and can even make itself felt by tangible touch. It ispossible to photograph such an apparition.Such materialised form is different from the astral body. The latter is not visible to normalvision. It is an exact counterpart, a subtle ‘double’ to the physical body and forms the vehicle inwhich the departed soul journeys after death.But, however, astral consciousness cannot guarantee you freedom from birth and death.Occultism and spiritualism can never give ultimate emancipation nor reveal the full secret of thebeyond. Spiritual realisation and knowledge of the Self alone will reveal the mystery of life anddeath, and the life beyond death.74LOKAS OR PLANES"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Chapter SevenSPIRITUALISMDeath is the most common phenomenon in nature and yet the least understood fact. It is oneof the most difficult problems of philosophy, because there is no direct evidence usually availableas to what really happens in and after death.The practice of Yoga enables one to observe the phenomenon of death through the intuitiveeye of wisdom or Divya Chakshus. Maharshi Vasishtha claims to have known everything directlyand speaks on death upon his own experience.Recently there has been an attempt made in the West by the Psychical Research Society tostudy the problem of death. Some thinkers have come to believe on the strength of the evidencecollected that death does not bring human personality to an end.Sir Oliver Lodge made scientific experiments. He is now convinced that there is the survivalof life after death. He says:“In justice to myself and my co-workers I must risk annoying my hearers not only byleaving on record our conviction that occurrences now regarded as occult can be examined andreduced to order by the methods of science carefully and persistently applied, but by going furtherand saying with the utmost brevity that already the facts so examined have convinced me, thatmemory and affection are not limited to that association with matter by which alone they canmanifest themselves here and now, and that personality persists beyond death. The evidence to mymind goes to prove that discarnate intelligence, under certain conditions, may interact with us, onthe material side, thus indirectly coming within our scientific ken.”The modern tendency is to speculate more and more on the life after death, after the adventof spirit communications, table tiltings, spirit taps, spirit light, spirit-writings, slate writings,materialised hands, card liftings, tin trumpeting, planchette writings, Ouija board manipulating andcommunications through media. Articles are freely written on the subject both in the West and theEast. There are many numbers of societies for the psychic research in the West. The effect of thoseresearches has been able to convince the West the survival of the soul after death.The Westerner with the state of spiritual advancement at which he has reached now and thequest for scientific demonstration of every phenomenon, may find revelations and discoveries ofthe existence of the soul, through this phenomenon by a degree of proofs and demonstrations. Tothe student of Eastern philosophy, bred and brought up in the sacred scriptures of India, theexistence of a soul and its transmigrations are only the beginning of his philosophy. To the West ithas come to be almost the end of their researches till now.According to the spiritualistic school of thought the other world to which we go after deathconsisted of a number of spheres representing various shades of luminosity and happiness for whichour spiritual conditions have fitted us. In these spheres the scenery and conditions of this world75WHAT BECOMES OF THE SOUL AFTER DEATH"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"were closely reproduced and so also was the general framework of society. Death was made easy bypresence of celestial beings who led the newcomer into his existence.The souls of Jivanmuktas or great sages who have merged in the Absolute cannot by anyamount of invocations, or spirit calls, or mediums, be recalled.A departed spirit may bear intense love towards its former relations and friends. It maycommunicate with its survivors on earth.Dying persons have very strong attachment to their children. If there are no persons to takecare of their children, they project their astral body after death, appear before the relatives and givea message. There have been records of such cases.Some departed souls who have intense attachment to relatives become earth-bound. Theyhover around them, remain close to them and try to help them. They try to be loved by them. Theyare conscious of their personality. They do not know that they are dead.A man is sitting in his room. He is thinking of a difficult problem. He is alone in the room.The room is closed. He beholds his ‘double’ which is like him. This comes out of him, goes to thetable, takes a piece of paper and pencil in hand, solves his problem and writes the answer on thepaper. This ‘double’ is the astral self of the man which can live independent of the gross physicalbody. Such instances are recorded in the Psychical Research Society of Europe and America. Thisclearly proves that there is a soul which is entirely distinct from the gross physical body.After death the individual soul takes all his desires with it and it creates the objects ofenjoyment by mere thinking. If it thinks of orange, the orange is there and it eats the orange. If itthinks of tea, tea is there and it drinks tea.He who wants to drink wine in heaven and eat delicious fruits and to live with celestialdamsels and move in celestial cars, goes to a plane of consciousness where he will project all theseideas and make his own heaven.Modern spiritualism has given wonderful demonstrations regarding the existence ofdisembodied spirits who continue to live even after the dissolution of their gross physical bodies.This has opened the eyes of the rank-materialists of the West and the atheists.Some good spirits possess the powers of fore-telling, clairvoyance and clairaudience. Theyhave love and affection for their friends and relatives. They try to help them during their distress,misfortunes, dangers and calamities. They give a warning message to avert dangers.The disembodied spirits remain earth-bound for some time after their death. They expecthelp from their relatives and friends.

Allthese injunctions are embodied in the book called Manusmriti. Manusmriti is the code of law andconduct for the Hindus. Kings and rulers of the past were guided by the rules contained therein forthe maintenance of peace and order in the country. The Manusmriti has divided human society intofour main divisions known as Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaisya and Sudra. It has also made fourdivisions of the different stages of life of an individualviz.,Brahmacharya, Garhasthya,Vanaprastha and Sannyasa. Brahmacharya is the life of a student, Garhasthya, the household life,Vanaprastha, the life in the forest given to religious pursuits, and lastly Sannyasa, the life of amendicant after renouncing all worldly activities. These are the four Ashramas of life.This order of society gradually perished due to modern civilisation and deterioration ofspiritual life in man. Materialistic dark forces of Rajas and Tamas have overpowered the effects ofSattvic ones and religion is given secondary importance. Nay, religionists are looked upon withcontempt in these days. A devotee or a Sadhaka with a tuft of hair (Choti) is not liked by the modernmen of the University. Study of scriptures, observances of religious rites, a spiritual life ofmoderation and real ethical cultures are denounced as useless or old-fashioned and consequentlythey are fading into insignificance. The problem of life is very serious now. The struggle forexistence is very keen in these days. The question of food and other luxuries of life has taken theplace of religion.For a householder the scriptures have imposed the Pancha Maha Yajnas, the five greatsacrifices as obligatory duties of life. The neglect of these duties entails penalty. These greatsacrifices are: 1. Deva Yajna (sacrifice to gods), 2. Rishi Yajna (sacrifice to Rishis), 3. Pitri Yajna(sacrifice to ancestors), 4. Bhuta Yajna (sacrifice to animals), and 5. Atithi Yajna (sacrifice toguests).The Sraaddha ceremony comes under Pitri Yajna. It is the sacred duty of the householder.Every householder should perform the Sraaddha ceremony for his ancestors. Pitris are forefatherswho dwell in the Pitriloka. They possess the power of clairvoyance and clairaudience. WhenMantras are recited, they exercise tremendous influence through their vibrations. The Pitris hear thesounds through the power of clairaudience and they are pleased. They bless those who offer theoblation. In Sraaddha, the essence of food offerings is taken up by the Sun’s rays to Suryaloka andthe departed souls are pleased with the offerings. Even in Germany and other foreign countriesmany persons perform Tarpan and Sraaddha. They have scientifically investigated the beneficialeffects of such oblations. It is the imperative duty of all householders to perform Sraaddha andTarpan to please the Rishis and Pitris. The Gita and the Upanishads clearly bear testimony to thefact that the performance of Sraaddha is very important. It is only the deluded souls with pervertedintellect who misconstrue things and neglect to perform the sacred ceremonies and consequently78SRAADHA AND PRAYER FOR THE DEAD"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"suffer. They are misguided by false reasoning and logic. Satanic influences affect them very easily.Ignorance is the root cause for this state of affairs.Sraaddha ceremony is done once in every year. A day of the Pitris is equal to one year ofhuman computation. This is the reason why we have to perform Sraaddha ceremony once in a year.If we perform Sraaddha ceremony once in every year, it is equal to daily performances of Sraaddhafor the Pitris. In their calculation we, their sons, live only for a few days, because the longest periodof human existence of 100 years is merely 100 days for them.Some people entertain the doubt, “When the Jiva undergoes transmigration and takesanother birth after leaving this physical body, is it necessary that we should perform Sraaddhaceremony for him? He is no more in the heavens. To whom will the oblations reach?” In the ninthchapter of the Gita, Lord Krishna has made it very clear that those virtuous persons who performsacrifices for the attainment of heaven attain to those worlds of enjoyments. “They having enjoyedthat spacious world of Svargas, their merit (Punya) exhausted, enter the world of the mortals; thusfollowing the Dharma of the triad, desiring objects of desires, they attain to the state of going andreturning.” This establishes the theory of attainment of heaven after death, and rebirth in the mortalworld after the exhaustion of virtuous acts. The enjoyments in heaven and peace of the soul areenhanced by the performance of Sraaddha ceremony. The suffering in worlds other than heavenaccording to the merits of one’s own actions is mitigated by the performance of Sraaddha ceremonyby his sons. So in both cases the performance of Sraaddha is a great help. The Pitris remain inheaven (Pitriloka, Chandraloka) for a very long period.According to the theory of transmigration, even if the individual is to take another birthimmediately after his death, the performance of Sraaddha adds to his happiness in his new birth. Soit is the imperative duty of everybody to perform Sraaddha ceremony for his parents andforefathers. Sraaddha ceremony should be performed with great Sraddha (faith) as long as you live.Faith is the main support for religion. In olden days the question “whether to perform Sraaddhaceremony or not” did not arise at all. Then people were full of faith and had reverence for thescriptures. In these days when faith is almost-dwindling into an airy nothing and when the list ofnon-performers of Sraaddha has increased, others of wavering faith begin to doubt whether it isnecessary to perform Sraaddha or not, and whether any good will accrue out of it. This lack of faithin the Sastras has degraded us to the present deplorable condition. “Sraddhavan labhatejnanam...the man of faith attains knowledge and thereby immortality and eternal peace” is thedeclaration of the Gita.Some people argue and say that if a man once performs Sraaddha ceremony to hisforefathers at Gaya and other places of religious importance, he need not do it every year thereafter.This is not a general rule and does not apply to all. It applies only in certain exceptional cases. Ifpeople take shelter under this exception and discontinue Sraaddha ceremony by once offeringPinda, etc., at Gaya, they do so out of sheer ignorance. They consider it merely a burden to performSraaddha ceremony and avoid it. They have not discharged their duties properly.The various religious observances imposed upon mankind by the Sastras tend to purify theignorant man. The goal of Karma Yoga is purification of the mind. Sraaddha ceremony, being oneof the obligatory duties, as per the injunctions of scriptures, also tends to purify the mind. Besides79WHAT BECOMES OF THE SOUL AFTER DEATH"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"this, the forefathers are also pleased and their good wishes and blessings tend to our material andspiritual growth.People who die without a son will suffer in the other worlds. (This is, of course, notapplicable in the case of Nitya Brahmacharins and spiritual aspirants who tread the spiritual pathalone after renouncing all selfish desires and worldly enterprises). That is the reason why peopleadopt a son before their death for the due performance of Sraaddha ceremonies after their death.The Gita also supports this view. “Patanti pitaro hyesham luptapindodakakriyah”: their forefathersfall (down to hell) deprived of the offerings of Pinda (rice-ball) and water.But, if a man is religious-minded and if he has discrimination and dispassion, belief in theSastras and the Vedas, if he has led a virtuous life till the end of his life, if he has devoted his lastdays in devotional practices, Japa, meditation, study, etc., (even if he has no son) he will not have afall. He will surely enjoy perfect peace. He will not be affected by the dark forces of ignorance. Heis free from base attractions of the world. The Lord takes care of his progress. He has gotself-surrender and there is no fear of downfall. He has mental purity. All religious observationshave Chitta Suddhi (purification of the mind) as their goal. This he attains by virtue of his pastSamskaras and virtuous life in previous incarnations.People of some communities in India spend money enormously and indiscriminately onSraaddha ceremony for show. This is mere wastage. Money should not be spent on luxury. It is adelusion to think that the Pitris will get more peace by spending more money. Money does not countfor the ease of the Pitris, but the intensity ofBhava,with which the Sraaddha is performed, counts.On such occasions the poor and deserving persons are to be fed sumptuously. Theirnecessities of life should be attended to. Study of scriptures should be done on such days. Theperformer of the Sraaddha ceremony should observe spiritual discipline like Japa, meditation,Mouna, etc. He should maintain strict Brahmacharya. He should not spend his time in idle pursuits.He should pray to God for the whole day. Recitation of appropriate Vedic hymns should be done.The story of Nachiketas of the Upanishads should be studied. The performer attains immortality.Revive the Vedic religion. Tread the path of Truth. Perform Sraaddha ceremony. Shake offthis slothfulness and indifference to the path of righteousness. Awake, arise! Tap the right source.Stick to your Varnashrama Dharma. There is no greater sacrifice than performance of one’s ownduty. Study the Gita daily. Live in the world, but be not of it. Assimilate the teachings of the Gita.This is the surest way to success in life as well as God-realisation.May you enjoy the bliss of the Eternal. May you attain the immortal and imperishable seatof Brahman by regular performance of your Svadharma (duty), singing Hari’s names, serving thesick and the poor, following the path of righteousness, by regular study of the Vedas and bymeditation on the Supreme Self!

Prayers for the dead form an integral part of mostof the religions. The Catholic Church conducts prayers for the dead.Prayer acts on the principle of a radio station and broadcasts the waves of good thoughts justas the radio station broadcasts waves of sound.Prayer or Kirtan is a mighty force which helps the departed souls in their progress towardsheaven and their quiet passage through the intermediate state.The departed souls remain in a state of swoon or unconsciousness immediately after death.They cannot feel that they are detached from their previous gross material bodies. Prayers, Kirtanand good thoughts from the relatives and friends can give real solace to the departed souls. Theycreate a potent vibration and an awakening in their stupefied condition of mind and bring back theirveiled consciousness. The souls begin to realise that they are not really in their gross materialbodies.Then they endeavour to cross the borderland, a narrow river of ether, which is known asVaitarani by the Hindus, Chinavat bridge by the Parsis and Sirat by the Muslims.The weeping and mourning and the uncontrolled grief of their relatives give them pains anddrag them down from their astral planes. This may seriously retard them on their way to theheaven-world. This produces serious injury to them. When they are sinking peacefully and whenthey are ready to have glorious awakening in heaven, they are aroused into vivid remembrance ofthe mundane life by the weeping and wailing of their friends and relatives. Their thoughts producesimilar vibrations in their minds and produce acute pain and discomfort.Therefore, relatives and friends should do Kirtan and prayers for the peace of the departedsouls. Then only they can really help and comfort them. If ten or twelve persons sit together and doKirtan and prayer, it will be decidedly more powerful and effective. Collective prayer and Kirtanexercise a tremendous influence.Why Scriptures Are Read To A Dying Man?Man takes birth in this world with a definite purpose. It is not for mere sensual enjoymentthat man is born in this world. The goal of life is Self-realisation or God-consciousness. The variousactivities of life should ultimately lead to that ideal or goal; or else the life is wasted. There is nodifference between the life of a beast and that of a man if he does not attempt to attain the goal oflife.In the Gita you will find: “Whosoever leaving the body goes forth remembering Me alone,at the time of death, he attains My being; there is no doubt about this.”81WHAT BECOMES OF THE SOUL AFTER DEATH"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"It is very difficult to keep up God-consciousness at the time of death when diseases tormentthe body when consciousness fades away. Some people imagine: “Why should a man become aSadhu and spend his life in the Himalayas? What is wanted is that one should think of God at thetime of death. That can be done even at home.” This is a mistake.The thought of God comes to a man at the time of death only through the grace of the Lord.You have to keep the practice of remembrance of Nama-Smarana every day, every hour, ratherevery second. When a strong habit is formed by unceasing practice throughout the period of yourlife, then it would be easy to remember God at the time of death. For this you will have to lead awell-regulated life after learning it from a saintly personality and living with him for some years. Ifyou can do this while remaining in the world, it is all the more helpful for your spiritual growth. Youcan be in the world and at the same time be out of it.Pursuing the worldly activities throughout the day and sleeping at night, you will find notime to think of God at all. Even if you do some Japa or prayer for 10 or 15 minutes daily while therest of the time you spend in worldly activities, you cannot make very great spiritual advancement.Therefore, the remembrance of God should be constant so that the thought of God may comeautomatically at the time of death as well.A devotee says to the Lord: “O Lord, let me enter the cool shade of your lotus-like feet thisvery day when my senses are strong, when my memory is good. When the intellect is perturbed andperverted at the time of death, it may be carried away by the threefold diseases of the body.” Eventhe most devout aspirant may fail to think of the Lord at the time of death due to the weakness of thephysical body.That is the reason why the Gita, the Bhagavata, the Vishnu Sahasranama and other holyscriptures are recited at the death bed of the sick man; even though he may not be able to speak, hemay hear what is read out to him. This will help the sick man in forgetting the body idea or hisailment and think of the Lord. Man always desires to die a peaceful death with his mind fixed onGod. When his memory fails, these sacred sentences of the scriptures will remind him of his realnature.Ordinarily a dying man is haunted by various horrible thoughts. He cannot concentrate hismind on God. His mind will be clouded with innumerable thoughts. He will be thinking: “Who willlook after my young wife and children if I die? What will become of my property? Who will realisethe outstanding dues from the debtors? I have not done such and such work. The second son is notmarried. The first son has not been blessed with a child. The work is half finished; many law-suitsare pending judgment.” Thus reviewing the actions of his whole life and thinking of the future, hewill feel miserable.When holy books are read and if his interest in the Lilas of the Lord is created, there is everypossibility of the man forgetting his worldly attachments. The relatives gathered round him shouldnot begin to weep. Then his mind will be more afflicted. On the other hand they must encourage himto think of God alone.

As soon as he uttered the nameof Narayana, the messengers of Vishnu arrived with the celestial car, drove away the messengers ofYama and took Ajamila to Vaikuntha.King Parikshit heard Srimad Bhagavata from Sri Suka, the born Siddha, and the son of SageVyasa, for seven days.

Even intellectual persons who havegrasped the idea that the Soul is Immortal and is distinct from the body are also awfully afraid ofdeath. Mysterious is Moha or infatuated love for the body! Mysterious is Maya or Avidya!This body is an instrument for all sorts of sensual enjoyments. That is the reason why man isintensely attached to the body. Through ignorance he identifies himself with the body. Througherroneous misconception he has mistaken the impure, insentient, non-permanent, pain-giving bodyfor the pure, sentient, eternal, all-blissful Soul. So he is caught up in the whirlpool of birth anddeath. Man has lost his power of discrimination through the force of Avidya or ignorance. FromAvidya is born non-discrimination or Aviveka.

Then he approaches a Brahma-Srotri,Brahma-Nishtha Guru, hears the Srutis or the Upanishads, then reflects on what he has heard,meditates constantly on Nirguna Brahman and attains Self-realisation or Atma-Sakshatkara andthus achieves conquest of death.The student of Bhakti Yoga develops the Navavidha Bhakti or nine modes of devotion. Hedoes Japa of Mantra, does Kirtan and serves the devotees. He does total ungrudging self-surrenderto the Lord. He says to the Lord, “I am Thine. All is Thine. Thy Will be done.” He attains the visionof the Lord and thus obtains mastery over death.The student of Raja Yoga practises Yama or self-restraint and Niyama or religiousobservances. He sits, restrains the breath, withdraws the senses, controls the thoughts, practisesDharana (concentration), Dhyana (meditation) and Samadhi (union with the Lord) and thus attainsconquest over death.The student of Hatha Yoga awakens the Kundalini Sakti, that is lying dormant in theMuladhara Chakra through Asanas, Pranayama, Bandhas and Mudras, takes it through differentChakras, viz., Svadhishthana, Manipura, Anahata, Visuddha, Ajna and unites the Sakti with LordSiva in the Sahasrara Chakra and thus attains conquest of death.A Karma Yogi purifies the heart through constant selfless service. He kills egoism throughself-sacrifice, attains illumination and thus achieves conquest of self.What Is Death And How To Conquer ItDeath is only a change of form. Death is only separation of the astral body from the physicalbody. Why are you so much afraid of death, my dear Visvanathan?Birth follows death just as waking follows sleep. You will again resume the work that wasleft off by you in your previous life. Therefore, do not be afraid of death.The idea of death has ever been the strongest motive power of religion and religious life.Man is afraid of death. In old age he tries to think of God. If he remembers God even from hisboyhood, he will reap a rich spiritual harvest in old age. Man does not want to die. He wants to livefor ever. This is the starting point of philosophy. Philosophy enquires and investigates. It boldlyproclaims: “O man, do not be afraid of death. There is an immortal abode. That is Brahman. That is84CONQUEST OF DEATH"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"your own Atman that dwells in the chambers of your heart. Purify your heart and meditate on thispure, immortal, changeless Self. You will attain immortality.”O man, do not be afraid of death at all. Thou art immortal. Death is not the opposite of life. Itis only a phase of life. Life flows on ceaselessly. The fruit perishes but the seed is full of life. Theseed dies but a huge tree grows out of the seed. The tree perishes but it becomes coal which has arich life. Water disappears but it becomes the invisible steam which contains the seed of a new life.The stone disappears but it becomes lime which is full of new life. The physical sheath only isthrown but life persists.Can you tell me, friend, “Is there anyone on the surface of this earth who is not afraid ofdeath? Is there anyone who is not uttering the name of the Lord when he is in serious difficulty,when his life is trembling in the balance, or When he is in acute agony?” Why then, O sceptics, doyou deny the existence of God? You yourself admit His existence when you are in trouble. Onaccount of perverted intellect and worldly intoxication you have turned out as an atheist. Is this not agreat folly? Think seriously. Give up arguing. Remember Him and attain Immortality and eternalpeace right now.In Garuda Purana and Atma Purana it is described that the pangs of death are tantamount tothe pain caused by the stings of 72,000 scorpions. This is mentioned to induce fear (BhayanakaSabda) in the hearers and readers and force them to work for Moksha. In spiritualism there is theunanimous report from enlightened spirits that there is not even a bit of pain during death. Theyclearly describe their experiences at death and state that they are relieved of a great burden of thisphysical body and that they enjoy perfect composure at the time of separation from the physicalbody. Maya induces vain fear in the on-lookers by inducing convulsive twitchings of the body. Thatis her nature and habit. Don’t be afraid of death pangs. You are immortal(Amara).Strive ceaselessly to live in God through Japa, Kirtan, service of the poor and meditation.Then only will you be able to conquer Time and Death.When the God of Death comes to take your life, he will not accept your excuses: “I had notime to worship God in my life.”Knowledge of Brahman, or Brahma-Jnana, alone can free us from the clutches of ignoranceand death. This knowledge should come to us as a direct realisation through meditation. Merescholarship or intelligence or study of religious books cannot help us to attain thesummum bonum.It is a matter of direct experience and not of argument or reasoning.Habitual study of abstract problems will result in another earthly life, in a well-developedpower of abstract thinking, while flippant, hasty thinking, flying from one object to another, willbequeath a restless ill-regulated mind to the birth following this world.Self-realisation will remove Avidya or ignorance, the root-cause of human sufferings, andproduce in you the knowledge of oneness of the Self, which is the means for eradicating grief,delusion, the dire malady of birth and death, the concomitants of Samsara or world’s process.85WHAT BECOMES OF THE SOUL AFTER DEATH"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"The Sun of pure consciousness is shining in the chambers of your heart. This spiritual Sun ofsuns is self-luminous. It is the Self of all beings, that transcends speech and mind. If you realise thisSelf, you will no more return to this Mrityuloka, the world of death.Birth and death are two illusory scenes in the drama of this world, created by the jugglery ofMaya. In truth, nobody comes and nobody goes. Atman alone exists for ever. Destroy fear andMoha through enquiry and rest in peace.“I know that mighty Purusha who, resplendent like the Sun, transcends darkness(ignorance). By knowing Him alone, one conquers Death. There is no other way to salvation”(Yajur Veda XXXI—181).Every effort in the direction of Yoga never goes in vain. You will realise thereby the fruit ofeven a little Yogic practice. If you have succeeded in the practice of the three limbs of Yoga viz.,Yama, Niyama and Asana in this birth, you will begin your practice in the next birth from the fourthlimb, viz., Pranayama. A Vedantin who has acquired two means, viz., Viveka and Vairagya in thisbirth, will start his practice in the next birth from the sixfold virtues, viz., Sama, Dama, etc.Therefore, you should not be discouraged a bit even, if you fail to attain the Kaivalya orindependence or final Asamprajnata Samadhi in this birth. Even a little practice for a short periodwill give you more strength, more peace, more joy and more knowledge.You cannot die, because you were never, born. You are immortal Atman. Birth and deathare two false scenes in the unreal drama of Maya. They concern the physical sheath only, a falseproduct formed by the combination of the five elements. The ideas of birth and death are meresuperstition.This physical body which is made up of clay or earth is a toy for the Lord for His Lila orsporting. He is the Wire-puller or Sutradhara. He keeps His toy running as long as He likes.Eventually He breaks the toy and throws the pieces away. The game of two ceases. There is onlyoneness. The individual soul merges in the Supreme Soul.The knowledge of the Self destroys all fear of death. People are unnecessarily alarmed ofdeath. Death is like sleep. Birth is like waking up from sleep in the morning. Just as you put on newclothes, so also you put on a new body after death. Death is a natural incident in its course. It isnecessary for your evolution. When the physical body becomes unfit for further activities and use,Lord Rudra takes it away and supplies a new body. There is no pain at the time of death. Ignorantpeople have created much horror and terror regarding death.There is only one Reality—Brahman. This world and body are superimposed on Brahman,just as snake is superimposed on the rope. As long as the rope is not known and the idea of snakepersists, you are not free from fear. Similarly this world is a solid reality to you until Brahman isrealised. When you see the rope with a light, the illusion of snake vanishes and the fear disappears.Even so, when you realise Brahman, this world vanishes and you are freed from the fear of birthsand deaths.86CONQUEST OF DEATH"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"You dream sometimes that you are dead and that your relatives are weeping.

Some practise Pranayama to live for hundred years. Some do banking and business to amassimmense wealth. If you reflect deeply for a while you will find out these people do two things onlyviz., eating sumptuously and sleeping. Nothing more than this.But their eyes are opened a bit when their dearest relative dies, when they get an incurabledisease, when they lose their wealth. They get a temporary disgust for worldly life. They ask: “Whatis life? What is death? What is there on the other side of death? Is there any life beyond? Where shallwe go after death?” The dispassion soon vanishes as they have no discrimination.Man tries to find happiness in sensual objects. Too much sensual indulgence wears out thesenses and brings disgust, sickness, and disease of all kinds. The more sexual pleasures he enjoys,the greater the passion becomes. He learns bitter lessons. He learns that his happiness does not lie insatisfying the desire of the body and the senses.At last he seeks to find happiness in his own Atman within.If you oppress a man you will suffer oppression in another life and reap the fruit of the seedyou have sown in this life.

If you desire power very much you will get it in your nextlife. But money and power cannot give you eternal bliss and immortality. You must be very carefulin your choice.

Giftedwith omniscience, he addressed the worm in these words:9. “O worm, you appear to be greatly alarmed, and to be in great haste.

Nachiketas asked his father: “Towhom will you give me?” The father replied: “To Death I will give you.”Nachiketas went to the house of Yama, the Lord of Death. He stood there for three days andnights without receiving any hospitality, as Yama had gone out and as there was none to receivehim. The Lord of Death returned and found Nachiketas waiting in obedience to his father’s promiseto give him to Death.Yama said to Nachiketas: “O Brahmin; as thou, a venerable guest, hast dwelt in my housethree nights without eating, choose now three boons in return.” Then Nachiketas first asked that hisfather might again be pleased with him. Yama said: “Your father will recognise you as before. Hewill sleep peacefully at night and when he sees you released from me, he will lose his anger.”The second boon was that of the heavenly fire and Yama said that that fire will be known tohim and called by his name. As for the third boon, the boy asked for the secret of Death. “There isthat doubt, when a man is dead—some say that he is and some say he is not—this! I should like toknow. Tell me, O Lord of Death, thy secret. Can man escape from thy clutch?”Yama said: “Do not ask that. On this point even the gods of olden times had doubt. Verily, itis not easy to understand it. Subtle is its nature. O Nachiketas! Choose another boon. Do not pressme on this point. I will give you sons, grandsons, gold, horses, dominions, wealth, long life, fairdamsels to attend on you, chariots etc.”Nachiketas said: “These things are ephemeral. They wear out the vigour of all the senses.Even the longest life is short. It is nothing when compared to Eternity. Keep thou thy chariots, thedamsels, the dance and music. No one can be made happy by wealth. Give me the one boon, theonly boon I seek—How may man escape thy mouth?”Lord Yama found out that the boy was a qualified student for the attainment of Jnana orwisdom of the Soul. He told him how man might escape from the hands of Death. He said: “ONachiketas! Just listen to me with rapt attention. I shall tell you the way to attain Immortality. Manis bound by desires. The desires are born of the senses. These bind him to the wheel of birth anddeath. He must destroy the desires and subjugate the mind and the senses. This is the first step to betaken. The body is like a chariot, the senses are the horses, the mind is the reins and the intellect isthe driver. The Atman or the Self is the Lord of the chariot. The sensual objects are the roads. Thehorses gallop after the objects of senses and carry the chariot with them. They must be guided alongthe right path. He who has no discrimination and whose mind is always uncontrolled, his senses(horses) are not controlled like the turbulent horses of a driver. He does not reach the goal, butenters into the round of births and deaths. But, he, who has understanding and whose mind is alwayscontrolled, his senses are under control like the good trained horses of a driver. He reaches that goalwhence he is not born again. He reaches the end of his journey, that highest place of Vishnu.91WHAT BECOMES OF THE SOUL AFTER DEATH"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"“Meditate on the One, the Eternal, the Atman, which dwells in the cavity of the heart.

Thus you may conquer Death. O Nachiketas! This is the secret of Death.“This Atman cannot be found by the sensual or the weak. It cannot be attained by argumentsor discourse or study. The Self reveals Itself to him alone whom It chooses. The choice of the Self isdetermined by the purity and unselfishness of the life of the aspirant.“Arise! Awake! Having reached the great Teachers, learn and realise that wonderful Atman.Like the sharp edge of a razor is that path, difficult to cross and hard to tread—thus the wise say.”Nachiketas then having acquired this knowledge imparted by Yama and also the wholeteaching about Yoga, having become free from passion, all impurities and death, attained Brahmanor the Immortal Soul.

His father Mrikandu performed rigorousausterities to get a son. Lord Siva appeared before him and said: “O Rishi! Do you want a good sonwho will die in his sixteenth year or a bad and foolish son who will live for a long time?” Mrikandureplied, “O my venerable Lord! Let me have a good son.”The boy began to know about his fate and began to worship Lord Siva whole-heartedly withintense faith and devotion. The boy entered into deep meditation and Samadhi on the day decreed asthe day of his death. Hence Yama himself went to take his life. The boy prayed to Lord Siva forprotection and embraced the Linga. Then Yama threw his noose round the Linga and the boy. LordSiva came out of the Linga immediately and killed Yama to protect the boy. Lord Siva was calledMrityunjaya and Kalakala from that day.Then the Devas approached Lord Siva and said: “O Adorable Lord! Salutations unto Thee.Pardon Yama for his mistake, O Ocean of Mercy, bring him back to life.” Then Lord Siva broughtYama back to life at the request of the gods. He also conferred a boon on the boy Markandeya, thathe should live for ever as a boy of sixteen years of age. He is a Chiranjivi. In South India, even nowmen and woman bless a boy when he does prostration to them: “Live as Chiranjivi Markandeya.”Through Tapas and meditation you can conquer death, you can achieve anything in the threeworlds.92STORIES"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Chapter ElevenLETTERSWhere Is My Husband’s Soul?Sri Swami Sivananda,Ananda Kutir, Rishikesh.Most Revered Swamiji!Many thanks for your kind letter which was a great consolation to me in my sorrow.I would like to know very much where my husband’s soul is at present and what happens tothe soul from the time it leaves the body till it is reborn again.

Further on soul enters the foetus in the seventhmonth.”I shall be much obliged if I am enlightened on the following points in this connection.1. Where is the heaven where the soul goes and how does it reach there? Evidently it needsthe support of raindrops to come down and therefore it must need some, thing to go up.2. Raindrops can be available only from the cloud area. Apparently heaven does notcoincide with the clouds. If so, how does Jiva come to the clouds from heaven?3. I understand, our Samsara, is not only Karmasthana but also Bhogasthana. If so, how is itthat Jiva is said to exhaust the fruits of his Karmas in the heaven and return to earth after exhaustingthem there.4. Jiva is said to enter the womb with the semen of man and then the soul is described toenter the foetus in the 7th month. How are the two facts to be reconciled? Is Jiva different fromsoul?

Thy kind letter of the 5th.The Jiva can travel in space.

Thereare seven planes which are interpenetrating one subtler than the other. Heaven is one of them.Our physical world is meant for evolution through the performance of good Karmas andspiritual Sadhana. At the same time, the individual soul meets with pleasure or pain which is theresult of his good or bad Karma. Bhoga is very negligible when compared to suffering. Sufferingalone makes a man really wise and introspective. In Svarga there is only Bhoga and no pain.Till the seventh month the Jiva remains in an unmanifested state. “The soul enters the foetusin the seventh month”—this does not mean that it newly enters.

In the present state the child was senseless.Gita XIII, 6 states that the last thoughts determine the next birth. Can a child of 5 years beexpected to possess any thinking power in a senseless state?So what birth is he likely to attain?2. Can he or his soul be benefited through Japa and charity done on his behalf? I feel he hasleft this world without doing any Sadhana.3.

But the moment either of these becomes weaker, there is an exit of the life-force.

If it takesrebirth immediately it can remember many of the events of its previous life.Q:—How long should the soul wait for getting a body?A:—Nothing definite can be said on this point. Great souls will have to wait for a long time.Q:—Can the departed spirit take the power of materialisation?A:—Only advanced spirits who are endowed with psychic power are able to materialise.They take human form, sit in the chair in the séance and shake hands with those who sit in theséance. They talk also. The touch is as tangible and warm as that of a living human body. In a shorttime the hand of the spirit melts away. Photographs of the spirits also have been taken.Q:—What is astral body?A:—Astral body is the subtle body which is within this physical body like the bladder of afootball. It is the exact counterpart of the physical body. It is made up of five organs of action, fiveorgans of knowledge, five Pranas, mind, intellect, Chitta or subconscious mind and Ahankara oregoism. Some call it as “double”. It is this astral body that comes out of the physical body afterdeath and moves to heaven. Death of this astral body through the knowledge of the Eternal frees onefrom the cycle of births and deaths.Q:—What is the difference between Metempsychosis and reincarnation?A:—Metempsychosis is transmigration of a human soul into an animal form. Reincarnationis the rebirth of the same ego in successive human bodies.Q:—Why do we not remember our past lives?A:—Such remembrance under our existing limitations would considerably complicate ourpresent life. Therefore, the wise and beneficent Lord has so ordered our mental evolution that wecannot recall our past lives until such time as it is good and helpful for us to remember. Suchinstances may well form a cycle which is all clear to us when we have come to the end of it, when weshall see a whole rosary of lives threaded upon the one personality.Q:—It has been said against reincarnation that there are more people in comparison with thepast world population.97WHAT BECOMES OF THE SOUL AFTER DEATH"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"A:—It is not necessary that the same persons are reborn, and none else. In the process ofevolution into the human life many from lower births also come up to the human level. All these arecontrolled by superhuman powers or by the Divinity, God or Isvara Himself. Further rebirth neednot necessarily be on this earth plane alone. It can take place anywhere in the Universe.Q:—What account do you give for the origin of a person’s existence?A:—Existence is the nature of a person. He is always existing. No proof is needed. Hisexistence is endless and beginningless. Hence no origin can be traced of one’s existence.Q:—Some men and women find their bodies awkward. Why?A:—It is the past Karma of an individual that is responsible for the awkwardness orotherwise of one’s appearance.Q:—With reincarnation is there turn about of sexes?A:—Sex can change in rebirth, but need not always.Q:—Do you think that Mahatma Gandhi might escape the necessity of a rebirth?A:—It is a Divine Secret. The status of great men and great souls depends on the DivineDispensation.Q:—How long does it take for souls to be reborn?A:—This is also decided by the Lord. It is not for man to guess or know such truths. It isbeyond his realm.Q:—Regarding reincarnation, Jesus Christ forgives our sins, so how can you explain thatwe come back to make amends?A:—According to Hindu belief all Karmas have to be worked out. Even if sins are forgivenone has to work his way for salvation by practising Yoga and uniting himself with God.Q:—How could we incarnate if women would not bear children any more?A:—Such a contingency would never arise. You need not be afraid of that condition.98LETTERS"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"APPENDIXSojourn In HeavenWhen the virtuous people die, they move towards, and live in Heaven. The period of theirsojourn in Heaven may extend from eight to two-hundred-and-forty years, it is popularly believed.They are, after the termination of their period of stay in Heaven, again reborn on earth.After death, the virtuous people enjoy the pleasures of Heaven as a reward of their merits,their virtuous deeds, their services and their sacrifices. When their merits are exhausted they returnto earth.Lord Krishna says in the Bhagavadgita:Tetam bhuktva svargalokam visalam; kshine punyemartyalokam visanti; evam trayidharmamanuprapanna gatagatam kamakama labhante. They,having enjoyed the spacious heaven world, their holiness withered, come back to this world ofdeath. Following the virtues enjoined by the scriptures, desiring desires, they obtain the transitory.But, when a virtuous person comes back from Heaven, to the physical world, he takes birthin noble and virtuous families. This is the advantage of virtuous deeds. There is double retributionor reward for man’s virtuous actions. He gets after his sojourn in Heaven, and return to the earth, agood birth with good surrounding, environment and opportunities for his good actions and innerevolution.Jnani After DeathFor a Jnani who has realised the identity of his Inner Being with the Infinite Brahman, thereis no rebirth, no migration, not even liberation; for he is already liberated. He has firmly establishedin an experience of the absolute Existence, Knowledge, Bliss, the Satchidananda Atman.The continued existence of the world and of his own body appears to the Jnani, only as anillusion, the appearance of which he cannot remove, but which cannot further deceive him, till thetime when, after the decease of the body, he wanders not forth, but remains where he is and what heis and eternally was, the first Principle of all beings and things, the original, eternal, pure, freeBrahman.While living and even when the body falls dead, the Jnani rests in his own essential Nature,his own Svarupa that is all-full, all-pure, timeless Consciousness and Bliss. The followingassertions made by a Jnani constitute his own deepest convictions and experience.I am Infinite, imperishable, self-luminous, self-existent. I am beginningless, endless,decayless, birthless, deathless. Never was I born. I am ever free, perfect, independent; I alone am; Ipervade the entire universe; I am all-permeating and inter-penetrating; I am Supreme Peace andFreedom Absolute.A Jnani lives for ever; he has attained life everlasting. Cravings torture him not; sins stainhim not; birth and death touch him not; he is free from all cravings and longings; he ever rests in his99WHAT BECOMES OF THE SOUL AFTER DEATH"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"own Satchidananda Svarupa. He sees the one Infinite Self in all, and all in the Infinite Self which ishis being; he remains for ever as the Infinite Self of Consciousness and Delight.Retrogression Into Animal BirthsHindu scriptures say that a man may become a Deva or a beast or a bird or vegetable or stoneaccording to his merit or demerit. The Upanishads also corroborate this statement. Kapila alsoagrees on this point.But certain schools of Buddhism and some Western philosophers teach: “There is no moreretrogression for a man when once he takes a human birth. There is no necessity for him to be bornas an animal for the sake of demerit. He can be punished in a variety of ways in the human birthitself.”When a man takes the form of a Deva, all human Samskaras, habits and tendencies willremain dormant. When a man takes the form of a dog, the animal tendencies, habits and Samskarasonly will manifest. Human tendencies will remain suppressed. Some dogs get royal treatment in thepalaces of kings and aristocratic people. They move in cars, eat good food and sleep in cushions.These are all degenerated human beings.Linga-Sarira Survives Death Of Physical BodyAfter death this physical body composed of five elements is cast off like a slough or the coilof a snake. The inner astral body or Linga-Sarira which consists of nineteen Tattvas, viz., fiveKarma Indriyas, five Jnana Indriyas, five Pranas, mind, Buddhi, Chitta and Ahankara goes toheaven, comes back to the physical plane, puts on another physical body and reincarnates.It is this Linga-Sarira or astral body that contains the impressions of all past Karmas. Thisbody remains till one gets knowledge and realisation of the Self, and consequent emancipation.Then, it disintegrates and the components get involved in the ocean of Tanmatras or Avyaktam.Nature Of The Next BirthThe last powerful thought that occupies the mind of a man in his dying moment determinesthe nature of his next birth. If the thought of tea comes to your mind at the moment of death, youmay become a manager of a tea-estate in the next birth, if you have done virtuous actions, or may beborn as a coolie in a tea-estate if you had not done any meritorious action.A drunkard will have thoughts of liquor when he is dying. A licentious man will think ofwoman only when he is about to expire. I saw a dying man who had the habit of using snuff. Whenhe was in an unconscious state he used to move his fingers towards the nose very often and doimaginary snuffing. Obviously he had thought of snuff. A medical officer of a hospital, who wasgiven over to using abusive words, used all sorts of abusive obscene terms when he was in a dyingcondition. King Jada Bharata, as I have already stated elsewhere, took great care of a deer, out ofcompassion. He gradually developed attachment. The one thought of deer alone occupied his mindwhen he was in the dying state. So, he had to take the birth of a deer.100APPENDIX"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"In every Hindu home the Names of God, such as Hari, Om, Rama, Narayana, are blown intothe ears of the dying man. The principle is that the dying man may remember the name and form ofGod and thereby reach the blissful abode. If a man leads a virtuous life for many years and if he doesJapa and meditation on God for a long time, then alone through the force of habit he may rememberGod and His Name at the moment of death.Vedantic View Of Heaven And HellAccording to Vedanta, heaven and hell are certain degrees of consciousness, they are notentirely ‘outside’. The joys of Heaven are spoken of only to persuade the virtuous to greater deedsof virtue, goodness, love and service. The torments of hell are presented only to dissuade the wickedpeople from their wicked, unrighteous, evil, harmful deeds.By purity, goodness, love, service, the human mind forms around itself, its own Heaven; byimpurity, error, evil, ignorance, the human mind creates for itself suffering and sorrow that go bythe name of hell. It is true, as poet Milton sang, mind in its own place can in itself make a heaven or ahell.Man is, in his true and essential inner spiritual Nature, eternal, unborn, infinite, of theNature of Light, Joy, Peace. It is ignorance that is the root-cause of his suffering, limitations,individuality, error, birth and death. Self-realisation, the experience of the Infinite Self withinhimself, releases man into the Kingdom of Infinite Peace, Freedom and Bliss.That there is an independent plane of existence called hell, subsisting in its own right, isfully supported by the Puranic literature. Suppose there is a wicked and inveterate drunkard givenover to insensibility of every type and vice.After death he is led by the Messengers of Death to that plane of existence called Hell, andleft to suffer the torments of a Tantalus, the tortures of moving in scorching deserts where hisagonising thirst for drink is not quenched. Thus in suffering he is made to pay back the wages of hiserror and purify his soul. Similarly, there is an independent plane of Existence called Heaven towhich the virtuous are led.Rebirth(A RECORD OF SOME INTERESTING CASES)Soldier Castor, the Burmese speaker—George Castor, related some of his past experiencesin the Sunday Express, London, (1935).

Thousands of people, includingseveral prominent figures of the city, visited him during the two days of his stay here and a clearcase of transmigration of soul was established in the end.The boy, aged five and a half years, said that he was Parama Nand, brother of B. Mohanlal,Proprietor of the renowned catering Firm of Messers. Mohan Brothers, having branches inSaharanpur and Moradabad, and he died at Saharanpur on May 9, 1943, following a chronic pain inthe stomach.Born at Bisauli on March 15, 1944, just nine months and six days after the death of ParamaNand, as son of Babu Bankey Lal Sharma Shastri, M.A., Professor in Inter College, Bisauli, the boyas early as he could pronounce the words, uttered clearly the name of Mohan, Moradabad andSaharanpur, and later also pronounced the words Mohan Brothers. Whenever he saw his relationspurchasing biscuits and butter he said he had a big biscuit factory in Moradabad. Whenever he sawbig shops in the market he said that his shop in Moradabad was bigger than any other shop. He usedto insist on his parents now and then to take him to Moradabad. The name of the boy as entered inhis Janma Kundali (horoscope) by the Pundits was also Paramanand, a strange coincidence, but thename of his elder brother being Varmod, he also began to be called as Parmod. But the child alwaysinsisted that he was Parama Nand, that he had his brothers, sons, daughter and wife at Moradabad.Mohan Lal Moves105WHAT BECOMES OF THE SOUL AFTER DEATH"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"It so happened that early this year, one Lala Raghunandan Lal of Bisauli told one of hisrelatives living in Moradabad about the boy and his assertions regarding his relationship with theMohan Brothers. Thereupon, the relations concerned told the whole story to Sri Mohanlal, theproprietor of the firm. Sri Mohanlal, together with some of his relatives, visited Bisauli last July andmet the boy’s father. The boy was, however, away in some distant village with some of his relativesand therefore could not be seen. Sri Mohanlal requested Prof. Bankey Lal to bring the boy toMoradabad and the request was acceded. It was promised that the professor would bring the boy toMoradabad during the forthcoming Independence Day Holidays.On August 15, on alighting from the train, the boy at once recognised his brother andembraced him. On the way from the station to the residence of Sri Mohanlal the boy recognised theTown Hall and said that his shop was now near at hand. When the tonga was by-passing the shop, asarranged, in order to test the boy, he at once asked the tonga to be stopped before the shop of MohanBrothers. Then he stepped towards the house situated in front of the shop and got into the roomwhere the late Parama Nand used to keep his articles of worship and cash box.On entering the room he bowed in salutation. It was a very pathetic scene when herecognised his former wife and other relations and recalled several incidents of his past life whichconcerned them. All agreed that the incidents were true. The boy could not, however, recognise hisformer eldest son, now 17 years, who was only 13 when Parama Nand died. When the boy recalledthat all the brothers used to sit together and drink lemons, etc., all the brothers and others presentbegan to weep.To Soda MachineThe boy then expressed his desire to go to his “gaddi” and on entering the shop went to thesoda machine and explained the process of manufacturing aerated water, a thing which he had neverseen in his present life. He told that the water connection had been stopped, as it had really beendone in order to test his memory.The boy then expressed his wish to go to Victory Hotel, owned by Sri Karam Chand, acousin of Parama Nand. He led the way to the building and to the upper storey and at onceexclaimed that the rooms at present constructed on the roof were not there before.Sahu Nandlal Saran, the premier citizen of Moradabad, took the boy in his car to the MestonPark, and asked him to locate the place where his civil lines branch had once been. He thereupon ledthe company to the Gujarati Building, owned by Sahu Nandlal Saran, and pointed out the shopwhere once the branch of Mohan Brothers had been. On his way to the Meston Park the boyrecognised the Allahabad Bank, Water Works and District Jail.It may be noted that throughout his excursions to the different places in the city, done eitherto fulfil his wish to see places connected with his past life or to test his memory, a large number ofpersons were present and it was a sight worth seeing. Everybody was moved. The boy recognisedseveral other places and persons who used to visit the shop during his past life.106APPENDIX"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"At the Public MeetingA large public meeting was held on August 16 at the Arya Samaj where the boy’s father,Prof. Bankey Lal, explained the development of the boy’s memory since his childhood.It was with great difficulty that the boy was taken back from Moradabad. As he was notwilling to go away from his old relations and the shop, he was carried away in the early hours ofAugust 17 while asleep.A deep impression has been created upon those gentlemen here who do not believe either inGod or in the transmigration of soul. As a gentleman told me, “No explanation is necessary forthose who believe, no explanation is possible for those who do not.”There is no need to mention that neither the boy nor his father ever visited Moradabadpreviously. The tone, the unhesitating manner and the correctness of details narrated by him werefound to be absolutely fool-proof and not even once did he falter.About twelve years ago, a similar, rather more remarkable event took place in Delhi, whenShanti Devi, aged nine years, was taken to Mathura where she identified her former husband, herhouse and many other details connected with her previous life.—“Amrita Bazar Patrika”, Aug., 1949.A Well-Known Case Of Rebirth—Shanti DeviA sensational, sensational because so amazingly credible and true case of rebirth at Delhi,reported officially by a locally appointed committee consisting of enlightened, critical andcompetent men, was much publicised in leading Indian and foreign newspapers. Born on the 12thOctober, 1926, Shanti Devi, a little girl, who bore in her memory the most vivid and living picturesof the whole span of her past life beginning in the year 1902 and ending in the year 1925, began eversince she could speak, to recollect and narrate whenever the context and associations in daily lifenecessitated, the incidents, events and experiences in surprising detail of her past life at Mathurawith her husband Pundit Kedar Nath Chaubey. Her unbelieving parents not only dismissed suchgraphic narrations of the past life, as though they were the jabber of a child, but fervently hoped thatthese recollections would efface themselves from the memory of the child as she grew. But,contrary to their expectation and hope, the child was insistent on recollecting more and yet more ofher past life, and persisted in requesting her parents to take her to Mathura the city of her previousbirth, where she desired to show the present parents, her old house and certain things in it whichonly an inmate who long lived in it could have so done.At last, the child prevailed over the parents. A grand uncle of the girl was called; ShantiDevi gave him the address of her husband in previous life; inquiries were made; communicationwas sent to her husband Pundit Kedar Nath and surprisingly enough a response came from PunditKedar Nath of Mathura who in his letter, among other things, suggested to the inquiring party atDelhi, to contact a relation of his, Pundit Kanji Mal, who was employed in Messers. Bhana MalGulzari Mal of Delhi, and give him an interview with the child, Shanti Devi. No sooner Sri Kanji107WHAT BECOMES OF THE SOUL AFTER DEATH"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Mal was brought into her presence, she had not only recognised him to be the younger cousin of herhusband but made most satisfactory response to the other question touching facts of an intimatenature.Aroused to a fresh and active interest in efforts at probing into the facts of Shanti Devi’snarration of the events, facts and experiences of her past life, the parents, the party and Kanji Malcalled Kedar Nath Chaubey to Delhi, from Mathura. When Pundit Kedar Nath Chaubey came toDelhi, with his ten-year old son, and his present wife, to see Shanti Devi, at the very first sight,Shanti Devi recognised her husband and felt greatly touched by the figure of her son, and began toshed tears. After a long interchange of thought and words between Shanti Devi and her allegedhusband, who was greatly moved by the veracity of the recollections and the truth of her statements,Pundit Kedar Nath confirmed the fact that this was the same soul, viz., that of his first wife who haddied at Mathura, and stated that her narration of the details in each of their particulars was true. Thismade the parents grant the repeated request that the girl Shanti Devi made many a time during thepast few years, to go to Mathura, which the girl now reiterated with greater force as a result of thepresent meeting with her husband of previous life. Shanti Devi not only gave out the colour of thehouse at Mathura, named the roads and streets leading to that house, described the Visram Ghat, thetemple of Dwarkadish, but stated certain things which only the former wife of Pundit Kedar Nathcould alone have known. She also said that she had hidden “underground” in the upper-storey roomof the house at Mathura, some money, a hundred rupees from which she had vowed to give to thetemple of Dwarakadhish. Upon the grant of this request and wish of Shanti Devi to go to Mathura,the persuasion of the investigating committee was exerted; and the party with the committee,parents and Shanti Devi, left for Mathura. As the train steamed into the Mathura station, ShantiDevi shouted in joy, “Mathura has come”, “Mathura has come”, and when she got down from thetrain, identifying in the crowd an elderly man wearing a typical Mathura dress, whom she had nevermet before, she came down from the arms of Deshbandhu Gupta where she was, and instinctivelytouched the feet of the old man stating that he was the elder brother of her husband named BabuRam Chaubey. This fact when found to be true, was but only one among the many surprises thatShanti Devi held for the admiration and awe for her witnesses. She had not only led the way to thehouse at Mathura, from the Railway station, but went on giving certain interesting facts as that therewas on that particular road no tar earlier, and when once in the house of her description, she hadsuccessfully passed every test that the inquiring gentleman put to her. When she was taken to theDharmasala at Mathura, she identified the ‘brother’ of her previous birth, now in twenties, andrecognised her ‘uncle-in-law’. At every step the truth of her past narrations which were dismissedas so much of a child’s jabberings were proved true beyond doubt. When in the house of herdescription, she entered its courtyard and felt dismayed at the absence of the well that was thenduring her previous incarnation there, noting which her husband Pundit Kedar Nath lifted up thestone covering the wall-less well and showed her the well. And going upstairs, she dug up the holewhere she had hidden her money, and to her uneasiness the money was not there, as it was, as PunditKedar Nath confessed that he had taken it from there, after the death of his former wife, now the girlShanti Devi. After this when she was taken to her parents’ house, she recognised them, and both thegirl and the parents sank into continued sobs; it was with great difficulty that the girl was weanedaway from the parents of her previous birth, and taken to the Visram Ghat where she unfolded manymore surprises to the investigating committee and to others by the display of the contents of thememories of her previous life. Such instances as these are not uncommon in India. There was alsoanother case of a girl who recognised her parents of her previous birth, and when a similar process108APPENDIX"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"of investigation was conducted, and her narrations found true, the parents of the girl in her previouslife, who were rich began to support her, and give her decent education, as the later parents werepoor. It is ridiculous to presume that rebirth is untrue when one has not taken pains to pursue theresults of the investigations that have been conducted.Philosophy Of DeathOccasionally in moments of calm contemplation, when we are thrown in an introspectivemood, we sometimes wonder why God, who is such a kind, compassionate and merciful Father,should have included death in the scheme of life. The fact is, death comes as a necessity to egg us onin our evolution.Could you just imagine of a world where there would be no death? Over population eventoday poses as a difficult problem with all the deaths that are taking place in normal course. So,imagine the extent of chaos and confusion that would result if there would be no deaths. Life wouldno longer be worth living. It would become a dull drab drudgery.Living in the same body we cannot grow beyond our bonds and ties of attachments.Complete separation is necessary to make us cautious of our attachments. During our brief sojournin this world, we get so much attached to thisterra firmathat when death knocks at our door, we feeltoo reluctant to be torn from our family surroundings and leave our material possessions sopainstakingly created. Therefore to completely snap the tie of attachment, death is the only solution.Death is not only a necessity for those who die, but it is also necessary for the evolution ofthose who are left behind. Death helps devolve responsibilities on new shoulders. They accept thechallenge of life and grow in experience. Father suddenly passes away. Son takes up the newresponsibility, bears it and enriches his treasure-house of experience. When a child dies in hisinfancy, it may not be much of an assimilation of experience for him except for certain Karmicpurgation, but it means all the more for those who are left behind. We have to grow beyondattachment, ego and desire to enjoy immunity from sufferings. Thus by helping us transcend ourworldly attachments, death plays an indispensable role.In fact, individual soul could never grow without death. The evolutionary process is a longone. It requires various types of experiences of poverty and riches, of purity and pollution, ofignorance and education of every country, clime, culture, race and religion. It requires experiencesof both the sexes as well. In a single body all this is not possible to assimilate. Therefore by virtue ofnecessity we die and are born again under different circumstances for a different set of experiences.Assimilation of experiences is also not possible without death. In the post-mortem states theconsciousness widens. The deeds of the past lifetime have a reaction, and we learn many newlessons. We often notice monkeys devouring eatables rapidly and then masticating them at leisure.Similarly we masticate our experiences in a higher and wider light which shines after death. Duringour stay in the astral plane, the scenes of our past life flit pass our eyes one after another. We beginto relive our lives with the difference that now we are identified with all the actors in everysituation. We feel as we did, when we tortured someone as also like the one who was tortured by us.We experience the pain of the latter. This process exhausts our Karma to a degree and provides us a109WHAT BECOMES OF THE SOUL AFTER DEATH"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"useful lesson. Karmic purgation occurs when both, the oppressor and also the oppressed have beenable to excuse each other. Retaliation only augments Karmic bondage.Death comes as a necessary drop-scene between two births. It is a drop-scene inasmuch asthe activities go on behind the curtain. Thus after the assimilation of one set of experiences of onelife, the individual soul is provided again with a new set of mental, emotional and Pranic body,eminently suited for his next reincarnation. In this manner from life to life, he travels assimilatinghis diverse experiences.In normal course, the period that intervenes between two births is about four to five hundredyears (in occult parlance our one year is equal to one day of Pitris). But occasionally instances arethere which indicate that births have been immediate. Invariably in all such cases where the birthshave been immediate, the death has been in an accident. Where we have not completed theexperiences of one birth up-to-date, a second birth in similar surroundings for similar experiences,becomes absolutely necessary. The other reason is that sometimes the attachments and certainresolutions are so overwhelmingly overpowering that in order to exhaust them a second birth in theimmediate future becomes absolutely necessary. For illustrations we need not go to the distant past.Narrations of a young girl, Mridula from Dehra Dun, who came to meet me in 1960, corroborate thevalidity of my statement. But it may be remembered that in all such cases the memory of theprevious birth does not last long. Sometimes, instances have also been found where the dead manhas come back to life. Sri Chandresekhara Iyer of Hyderabad, Deccan, who was a resident inSivanandashram was an example, who died, and after being dead for two hours, came back to lifeand lived for some time afterwards.At the time of death, a little distortion and contraction which we find in the body is just theeffort of the Pranic double to extricate itself from the physical body. The experience is said to bepainless. But how does it matter even if it were painful when Death promises light behind thecurtain!Mridula’s Revelations Of Her Last Birth“Mummy! Mummy!”, exclaimed a child of two years and three months, and jumped out ofher mother’s lap and ran towards the object of her attraction. That very moment an elderly lady wasgetting out of a car on the road in front of Mridula’s house. The child ran towards the car andexclaimed incoherently, “Ah, that car is mine, and she is my mummy.” The elderly lady, however,ignored the child and walked past her. Mridula’s mother rushed out, fearing that her child might belost on the road.But Mridula would not move from near the car, as she was looking hither and thither, as if insearch of someone; her face flushed with excitement and joy. Her mother, however, would sharenone of that, and as she felt embarrassed, she took away the child forcibly back into her house. Thatnight Mridula was not her own self. She went on speaking all sorts of things to her mother, like anadult recollecting the bygone days.Mridula would say: “I have another home, mummy! We have six elephants and a car too,and there are my younger sister and daddy and so many friends. Will you take me to my old110APPENDIX"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"mummy, please? I promised her to come. Oh, now I want to go home!” And she would keepgushing with a babble of such irrelevancies, i.e., as others would think of them, but not the child.Her mother was thoroughly baffled and wondered if the child was mentally all right.Days and weeks and months rolled past. It was now more than six months, but Mridulawould keep on harping on her old theme, her big house and car and friends. The poor mother, withall her efforts, was unable to pacify the child. But the merciful Lord came to their help thus:AYajna(ritualistic rite according to Hindu tradition, when sacrificial oblations of clarifiedbutter, etc., are poured into fire with the chanting of sacred syllables) was being performed on alarge scale, in which many members of the community participated. Mridula’s mother, too, hadgone there, taking the child with her. As the ceremony came to a close, Mridula, who had beenwatching, ran towards two small children, of her age, who were sitting at a distance. She took off thegarlands she had been wearing and put them around the necks of those children.The mother of the children, who stood nearby, was surprised, but appreciated this gesture ofMridula and said: “You seem to be a very sweet child. Do you know them?” Mridula at oncereplied: “Oh, I knowyouvery well, though not these children,” and then with bubbling emotion sheasked: “Don’t you recognise me? I am Munnu, your elder sister. Where are our daddy and mummy?How are our elephants?” And Mridula kept speaking excitedly, in this manner, many things whichonly an intimate member of the same family could have known.The mother of those two children was wonder-struck, and she clasped Mridula to herbosom, and asked her many questions connected with the family. She took Mridula to her mother,and told her all that had happened and asked her permission if she would allow Mridula to visit herhome. The mother agreed and they all drove to the young lady’s house in her car.Back to the Old HouseThe car stopped in front of a house, and Mridula rushed out, shouting: “Oh, this is my house!Oh, here is my daddy! Here is my daddy!”, as she saw an elderly gentleman standing at that gate.They were all baffled to see her rushing inside, and going from room to room, and telling who werein each of them some years ago. And then she found her room and said that here she lived, andlocated some books and said that these were the books which she had read for her M.A. course. Shesought out her almirah and said that there used to be her clothes, and also the cot where she fell illand lamented that she could not appear for her M.A. examination.Mridula asked the elderly lady of the house, with childish eagerness: “Do you know,mummy, how I felt at the time I left my body?” She pointed to her hands and feet and said: “All thenerves were taut and I felt terrible pain, and then I flew up, knowing not where, just like a bird. ThenI wandered here and there, and saw many luminous and joyful things. Everyone was happy there.Then I remembered you and I felt very sorry, for I was not with you, and then I did not rememberanything.” The elderly couple, who were deeply attached to their first daughter and had lost her sixor seven years back, could say nothing, and as the old memories came back to them, they burst intotears.111WHAT BECOMES OF THE SOUL AFTER DEATH"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Mridula’s words penetrated deep into their hearts, and they felt that the whole thing was likea dream, difficult to grasp, and yet very true, rather a revelation of profound truth, which this littleunknown child unveiled before them. And Mridula would not stop and insisted: “I am the sameMedha, whom you gave the pet name ‘Munnu’. How are my friends? How is Shuklaji of D.A.V.College? Everything here in this house is more or less the same as I had left. But why have youmade changes in my room? This fan does not belong here; it was in the drawing room. Please speakto me, mummy? You made me promise, when I was leaving, that I would come back, and here Iam!” The poor lady could no longer restrain herself, and she clasped the child to her heart as tearswere streaming down her cheeks.Renewal of Past TiesMedha, who had died of tongue cancer at Dehra Dun, in her early twenties, in 1945, wasdoing her M.A. course, but could not appear for the final examination. Her deep attachment to herfamily had most unusually left a residue of her past memory when she was born again, to work outher Karma. She had belonged to a wealthy Vaisya (commercial) family of Dehra Dun, and she tookbirth in a Brahmin family (priestly caste—though nowadays few follow one’s avocation accordingto one’s own caste), in Nasik, nearly a thousand miles south, on July 31, 1949. But her Brahminfather died soon after her birth, and the mother shifted to Dehra Dun and took up a teaching career.The child found the memory of her past birth in a flash, when she was two years and three monthsold, as stated before.Since Mridula had lived for more than twenty years in the previous birth, her attachment toher former family was naturally more deep-rooted than to her present mother, and therefore, shewas more eager to stay with the former family than in her own house. One can imagine the feelingsof this poor lady, who had nursed her child with so much care and who loved her as her own self,having lost her husband, though Mridula’s former parents being glad to have her with them, gaveher all the care she needed.The Gita says (in the second chapter, verse 22): “Just as a man casts off worn out clothes andputs on new ones so also the embodied soul casts off worn out bodies and enters new ones”. Thiswas actually proved in the case of Mridula, who was one of the very rare exceptions to have retainedthe memory of her past birth. Perhaps it is fortunate of man in not remembering the memories ofpast lives, since it spares him a good deal of suffering, caused by attachment to the moorings thatcould hardly be regained, without discomfiture.Immortality of the Soul[Mridula had been to the Ashram of Sri Swami Sivanandaji at Rishikesh quite a few times.When she had come there soon after the flash-back of her past memory, with her present mother,she was about five years old, and had a vivid recollection of her past life. She had been to Swamiji’sAshram with her both mothers, subsequently. As she became young her old memories faded out agood deal, being smothered by the impressions of her childhood. She was an intelligent, healthy andperfectly normal child.112APPENDIX"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"[Swamiji, who had listened to the child’s experiences, told us that there was nothing newabout them. There had been similar instances in the past, but very rare and far between, as forexample, the case of Shanti Devi, who as a small child, found her former relations, more thantwenty years ago. These prove the immortality of the soul, which is individualised in differentforms through different Samskaras or the sum total of impressions caused through actions, good orbad, mental or physical. Swamiji pointed out the need of freeing ourselves from the bond of Karmaand to return to our original, divine source. He shows us the way, by following which we can attainGodhead. He asks us to perform good actions in a spirit of detachment and dedication, and enquire,“Who am I” Swamiji’s cryptic injunctions are: “Be good, do good”, “detach and attach” (detach themind from the worldly objects and attach it to the Lord). Let us all humbly pray to him to bestowupon us his grace and give us the strength to march forward and Godward. —Ed.]Immediate Return After DeathCASES OF MISTAKEN IDENTITYIt is common to find the newspapers’ report of cases of persons who return to life two orthree hours after death. These persons are those whose identity has been mistaken by theYama-Dutas or the Messengers of the Lord of Death. Two persons bearing the same name,answering to the same description, and living probably in the same village or town or city, aremistaken by the Messengers of Death, one for the other, and the wrong person is taken to the Lord ofDeath, only to be returned to life soon on discovery, and the right person conducted, at the sametime, to the halls of Yama.Here I present the case of Sri C. Reddy of Andhra Pradesh, in his own words. He writes, “Itis common knowledge as gathered from scriptures that after a human being casts off his mortal coil,the messengers of the Lord of Death descend down to escort the astral body of the dead person, tothe Loka ordained for him in accordance with his Karmas, Prarabdha or Purushartha. Thoseteachings of the Hindu scriptures have to be believed in before one may understand or accept thetruthfulness of experience. I am going to relate my own personal case. But the reader, be he abeliever or a non-believer in these teachings, is nevertheless going to experience sooner or later thesame phenomena when his Prana, or the last breath stops to function, i.e., when he dies.“I was born in an Indian princely family of South India. After the advent of theIndependence of India and the rule of the Congress Government, the rulers and princes of my kindbecame ordinary citizens of India, devoid of the previous rights, privileges and way of living, butare given only a scanty pension. Having always pursued the religious life, now at the age of 73, I ama recluse and have taken shelter at the feet of my Guru Swami Sivananda Sarasvati of Rishikesh, arealised Sage. The truth of my experience is as follows:“In 1948, suffering from severe malaria, I became anaemic, and my doctor, a relative, gaveme certain injections of insulin, which sent me into unconsciousness or coma, and forthwith I wasremoved to the Nursing Home nearby where I was given injection after injection to get heat into mybody, but inwardly the doctor had concluded that I was dead and he had caused the news of mydemise to be wired to my daughter.113WHAT BECOMES OF THE SOUL AFTER DEATH"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"“What was really meant to be the death-state, I did really experience. The doctor’s judgmentwas not far wrong though he had not expected my death. When I had stopped breathing physically,my astral body or soul was caught hold of by two tall black Yama-Dutas who escorted me to theYama-Loka with great speed. It was 11 a.m. and we reached our destination within 20 minutes. Isaw the God of Death, Yama seated on a golden pedestal.En routeI was instructed and warned bythe Messengers to maintain complete silence before the Dharmaraja unless directly questioned.Unto Dharmaraja I reverentially prostrated. He asked in whispers the man seated on the ground infront of Him to refer to my life-record-book, and he began to turn over pages one way and the other.Their conversation I could not follow, except at the end when Dharmaraja ordered the sameYama-Dutas to take me back to the mortal world, from which I concluded that I was the wrong manbrought by the messengers, and perhaps somebody else answering to my name and description wasdestined to die at that moment.”Many people have had the curious experience of visiting some place which by all availableevidence they could never have seen previously but where they felt at once the conviction: “I havebeen here before.”Sometimes the impression is stronger so that one can say with confidence that around thenext corner there will be a shop with windows containing a clearly-perceived arrangement of goodsor a house with strongly individual configurations; and one is only mildly surprised when the corneris turned and the impression is confirmed.I remember, during the war, inviting an explanation of this not unusual phenomenon from aprofessor who had come to talk about psychology to an extremely sceptical gathering of troops. Thebest answer he could offer was a kind of synthesis of associated ideas, for instance, that in one placeyou had subconsciously registered the arrangement of a picture and an ornament, in another way avase was placed on a table, in a third the gleam of brass from trophies ranged above the hearth, andthat suddenly, for no very clear reason, some particular room reminded you of all these things at thesame time, and established a sensation of familiarity.The explanation was a good attempt, but so obviously unsatisfactory that I did not press oneof the classic instances of “recollections” which seems to support the claims of those who believe inthe ancient theory of reincarnation.Dead Wife Came Back As A ChildIt is a strange and pathetic case of a Hindu girl, about eight years old, who was being takenby her parents on a pilgrimage to Mathura, a town many miles from her birthplace to which shecould not possibly have been before.On arrival, the child cried out that she recognised the town, that it was there that she hadlived with her husband in her previous life, and that she must return at once to him—and her son!That was not all. To her parents’ astonishment, she led them rapidly and surely through thetown to a remote street where she entered the house of the widower with one son, who, it appeared,had lost his wife about three years before this girl was born.114APPENDIX"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"She was so sure in her knowledge of the surrounding streets of the widower’s home and hislife with his past wife (as she claimed herself as such) and all the intimate details of the birth of theirson and of their life together, that the man and the boy became convinced that this child of eight wasindeed the reborn wife and mother.It is said that when her parents refused to allow her to stay with her “husband” and “son” asshe begged, and took her back home with them she became seriously ill and raved in deliriumcalling incessantly for her two beloved ones that she had left behind in Mathura! A strange story,but vouched for by several responsible Europeans precisely in these terms.***For the story of the ghost with the bunch of violets, which in its way is no less unusual, I amindebted to the beautiful and talented Miss Margery Lawrence, whose own words can scarcely beimproved.I started life, as a very young girl by wanting to be an artist (says Miss Lawrence) and forsometime had a top-floor studio in a tall old house in a well-known London street. The old man whoowned the house had his shop on the ground floor.On the first floor, directly above the shop, were his offices, and the upper floors were let off,room by room, to various people; a masseuse, a maker of wax model-heads, a man who didhandloom weaving, and one or two others, including myself, the proud possessor of the attic!I had left my studio about five minutes to six one wet November night and shortlyafterwards remembered something I wanted, so I ran back.As I stood waiting for a chance to cross the road, I saw the slender figure of a young girldressed all in grey, and wearing long fair hair streaming down her back, cross swiftly before me,somehow escaping the traffic, and vanish into the entrance of the shop.I started—surprised, at the sight of a real old-fashioned “mane” of long hair in London filledwith bobbed heads, and also at the fact that as she entered the doorway of the shop she turned andseemed to smile at me, and I saw that she clutched a gigantic bunch of Parma violets. Freshviolets—in November!When I managed at last to get across the road I said to the shop assistant who was justputting up the shutters: “Who was that pretty girl with long hair and the bunch of violets who justcame in and went up the stairs to Mr. X’s office?”The girl turned white, looked at me and said in a hushed voice: ‘Oh that miss! Did you seeher? We often smell the violets, but none of us in the shop has ever seen her.’It’s Mr. X’s only daughter. She died at sixteen, years and years ago, and they say she hadlong fair hair below her waist, and loved violets the best of any flowers!115WHAT BECOMES OF THE SOUL AFTER DEATH"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Sometime later I found that the old man had his beloved child’s body cremated, and kept theashes in a special casket in a niche in his office; so I suppose that he thus provided a sort of ‘focus’for the loving little ghost.“That I saw her in, is certain”, says Miss Lawrence, “and that I had never either heard orknown of Mr. X having ever had a daughter is equally certain.”***As an interesting post-script to the legend of the “Abominable Snowman” of the Himalayas,I found recently an account authenticated by Commander Rupert Gould of a series of incidentswhich certainly suggest the possibility that at least one of the “Mi-Go” or “Yeti” may havewandered from its native haunts as far as southern England.In Devonshire a sensation was caused by the discovery of a series of mysterious footmarksunlike anything ever seen before. It was snowy weather and the prints were clearly to be seen.The impressions were oval in shape, rather like a horseshoe, but more pointed in the front.They were made one after another in a straight line, each step about eight inches in advance of thenext—and what known animal makes only a single line track of footprints one immediately afteranother?The prints were seen in all sorts of peculiar places not only on the ground, but across roofs,along tops of narrow walls, in gardens and enclosed courtyards as if the creature who made theprints took no account of obstacles.In one instance, the prints marched straight up to a haystack and began again in a direct lineon the further side (though there were no prints round the side of the stack or on the top) as thoughthe creature had walked straight through the stack!Prints were also found leading directly through dense thickets and shrubberies (the printswere clearly to be seen on the ground below the bushes) but there was no breaking of twigs orboughs as might have been expected.The prints were seen at Topsham, Lympstone, Exmouth, Teighmouth and Sawlish in SouthDevon in vast numbers, apparently following a definite route they vanished on the melting of thesnow and have never recurred, but they have never been satisfactorily explained.Experts on animal tracks were called in, the prints (carefully drawn at the time) wereanalysed but no living creature has been found which makes a track in the least resembling these.—J.D. Ewing116APPENDIX"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"A Statement Of FaithI believe in God-nature as understood by Goethe, and not in any established religion. Theconceptions ‘atheist’ or ‘agnostic’, even the words themselves, are foreign to me. I am linked toJudaism by its magnificent principles, but I am alienated from it by its unembellished severity. I amlinked to Evangelism by its idea of mercy, but I am removed from it by its instruction of a mediatorbetween God and myself. I am bound to India by the belief in the eternity of the world but I amseparated from her by Nirvana. How people can quarrel or even wage wars for the sake of religion isas incomprehensible to me as any mission in spiritual things.Propaganda is good for the masses and such subaltern institutions as the State and nationaleconomy. Just as little as we try to persuade anybody to fall in love, so we should refrain from doingso in matters of belief of metaphysics.I lift my hat before every image of God for the sake of the human beings, who are kneelingbefore it. But I do not know a house of God to pray in; the fact that the finest of all temples, theParthenon in Athens is without a roof signifies to me a relief for the God who was once imprisonedin it.Morality is something apart: It has nothing whatsoever to do with God or religion. The twogreatest terrestrial gifts—beauty and health—are for me nothing but the acts of grace of someunknown power. When, however, I wish to visualise my fancies, they always take the name orshape of a Greek God.I am only able to find faith in an immediate perception of the works of God withoutapproaching Him by any system. Goethe said: “Do not look for anything at the back of phenomena;they are themselves the doctrine.” As to the question of existence after death, I can only sum up myideas in words, which Goethe after having expressed the thought a dozen times formulated in hisold age thus: “The conviction of my subsequent existence arises in me from the conception ofactivity, for if I work without intermission till my end, Nature is obliged to give me another form ofexistence when that present one is no longer to support my mind.”I recognised God in the logical construction of a crystal no less than in that of a Bach fugue.I see God in the pleading look of a dog as well as in the lovely bosom of a woman. I find Him in theiridescent wings of a butterfly, and in the early morning frost which means its death. He appears tome in the hairy covering of the magnolia bud, and in the hand of the child who plucks it before it canblossom. I see Him in the revolution of our times which seeks to wipe out old injustice. I see Him inthe smouldering eyes of a man who vows revenge upon his rival in love, and in the poised hand ofthe surgeon who removes a bullet from the eye after the duel. I see Him in the master-hand ofLeonardo, as he fixed an unearthly smile upon the lips of his divine creation, and in the caricatureswhich he made of men’s features. I see Him in a playful kitten, which seeks its playfellow in themirror and in the murderous eyes with which it follows the movements of a robin. I recognise Godin the inspiration which He sends me as in a dream, and in the long labour by which I must carry itout.—Emil Ludwig(The famous German Biographer)117WHAT BECOMES OF THE SOUL AFTER DEATH"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"What Do Westerners Say On DeathI am, for personal purposes, convinced of the persistence of human existence beyond bodilydeath; and though I am unable to justify that belief in a full and complete manner, it is a belief whichhas been produced by scientific evidence; that is, it is based upon facts and experience....I assertemphatically that there is evidence for survival, and that some of the evidences are thoroughlygood.

All these evils we endure for our good, for our purification,and so to speak, to make us perfect. From age to age, from race to race, we accomplish a tardyprogress, tardy but certain, an advance of which, in spite of what all the sceptics say, the proofs aremanifest. If all the imperfections of our being and all the woes of our estate drive at discouragingand terrifying us, on the other hand all the more noble faculties, which have been bestowed on usthat we might seek after perfection, do make for our salvation and deliver us from fear, misery andeven death. Yet, a divine instinct that always grows in light and in strength helps us to comprehendthat nothing in the whole world wholly dies, and that we only vanish from the things that lie aboutus in our earthly life, to reappear among conditions more favourable to our eternal growth in good.”—George SandThe doctrine of metempsychosis may almost claim to be a natural or innate belief in thehuman mind, if we may judge from its wide diffusion among the nations of the Earth and itsprevalence throughout the historical ages.—Professor Francis Bowen118APPENDIX"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"“Although unfamiliar to Western mentality, Reincarnation is unreservedly accepted by themajority of mankind, and has been so even from the very dawn of history. There are seven populararguments in favour of Reincarnation which are more conclusive and logical than those put forwardfor many theological doctrines.1. That the utmost universal idea of Immortality demands it.2. That analogy makes it the most probable.3. That in many respects it harmonises with science.4. That the nature of the soul requires it.5. That it most completely answers the theological questions of ‘Original Sin’ and ‘FuturePunishment’.6. That it explains many mysterious experiences and extraordinary memories.7. That it alone solves the problem of injustice and misery which seems to dominatephysical existence.The Christian teaching that ‘Whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap,’ is fullyendorsed by the oriental teaching of Reincarnation and Karma.As there is no royal road to great attainments, the presence of youthful prodigies and geniusin the world is therefore a fact on the side of reincarnation. Everyone has lived before through manylives and previous experiences and so everyone has different characteristics.”—Arthur E. MasseyCertain Superphysical ExperiencesAs the daughter of a clergyman I was taken to Sunday-school two years old and to schoolfive years old, and at the age of seven years I read the Bible and also philosophical books which Itook from my father’s library, and already at that time I decided to live single all my life, onlyinterested in pondering about the mysteries of life and death. In the Bible I read Paul’s words: “Prayunceasingly”, this I did, and as an answer to my prayer, angels came to me in the night and my roomwas filled with light. This was to me a proof of the existence of an unseen but more real world towhich we were going after death.Having grown up I once experienced a physical elevation. During prayer my body waslifted up in the air and held there for some moments, while strong forces rushed through it, and mywhole being was filled with indescribable rapture. The power was so immense that I feared to becrushed, and I had to pray for getting no more of the divine power. Then the spiritual tempestlessened, and I was gently taken to the ground. Later on I had a spiritual elevation. Duringmeditation I was lifted up in an ocean of dazzling light where nothing else was seen or heard. It was119WHAT BECOMES OF THE SOUL AFTER DEATH"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"as if I had no body at all but pure existence, as if I had melted into God’s aura of immense power,majesty and abundant love and bliss. Similar experiences followed, and I felt them as a kind ofinitiation, as my nature seemed to some degree to be changed and purified; it was as if a fragrance ofthe holy atmosphere in which I had merged remained with me in my daily life.Some time later I got the courage to pray for getting the same experience as Paul had, whenhe was lifted up in the spheres, and one night an angel, or bright spirit, came to me, lifted me out ofthe body and carried me out in space. My first thought was that I had passed over, but the spirit toldme that it was only the answer to my prayer and that I would be taken back to my body again aftermy visit in the spheres, which also happened. I saw my body lying in my bed, and I was indeed notvery glad to enter this heavy shell again. My spirit-friend came often and took me to various placesin the astral world and also to higher planes. But once I discovered that I was able myself to separatemy astral body from my physical body and to go alone up in the spheres, and then I did so almostevery night.When for the first time I came to the astral plane I was astonished to see that it appearedrather similar to our physical world, although, of course, it was of a higher vibratory nature. I foundthat the Lord’s words: “In my father’s house are many mansions” were literally true, as thereseemed to be a mansion or habitation for every discarnated soul. Some of the mansions were verymodest, some rather pretty and others magnificent, according to the spiritual state of theinhabitants, and in the higher spheres I have seen mansions surpassing in magnificence anymansion on earth. In the astral world there are lower and higher spheres, but everywhere the spiritsenjoy a pleasant life, as there is no decay, no sickness, no decline into the vale of years, but eternalyouth and beauty. I have been told that no one is forced to work, but that generally the spirits aredelighted to do some work, often the same as they have done on earth. Painters, sculptors,musicians, composers, authors and scientists are carrying on with their work and are developingthereby, and they are joining in various societies according to mutual interests, just as on earth.There are learning institutions for science, art and music, and many are working there as teachers; Ihave visited some universities and have attended highly interesting lectures. The different religionsare also represented and have their churches and lodges, and our Lord is worshipped there just as onearth, and nobody can doubt His existence, as He often speaks to the various groups. His presencealone is a blessing to all. So His words to the disciples: “Where I am, there ye may be also”, is awonderful reality.Generally the spirits are using their own language, but there is a universal language whichall educated spirits understand, and which everybody has an opportunity to learn.Perhaps I should not omit to mention that every discarnated soul, when entering the astralworld, has to go through a period of retrospection and introspection that corresponds to our idea ofthe purgatory, as all his deeds both his good and bad actions and his good and bad words have beenrecorded by invisible supervisors who have followed him during all his life on earth. So it has cometrue that “men shall give account of every idle word that they have spoken, and that by their wordsthey shall be justified, and by their words they shall be condemned”; and our Lord’s words: “Thereis nothing concealed that shall not be revealed, and nothing hid that shall not be made known.Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light, and what ye havespoken into the ear in the inner chambers shall be proclaimed upon the housetops”, are indeed a120APPENDIX"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"reality. For many it is an agony to go through these records and be confronted with their own badactions and words, but for others it is rather a joy to see the fruits of their idealistic endeavours.In the higher spheres I have met many highly developed spirits, and some of them told methat we had lived together in what they call: “the great incarnation”, when our Lord wandered onearth. I did not remember that incarnation, whereas I have had various visions from otherincarnations. Some of them great, some rather common, and I might mention that it was anastonishing experience, when for the first time I found myself in a man’s body, but then Iunderstood why I had always felt my own being more as a man than as a woman.On looking back into my earlier incarnations it became evident to me that our present being,in reality, is but a fragment of our real being, and that our consciousness is but a part of our totalconsciousness, which will not appear until we have gone through the sum of all incarnations. Ineach incarnation we have to develop certain qualities, and to serve in special environments, andtherefore it has been necessary to shut off the memory of earlier incarnations, as this would only bea burden to us. In each incarnation we are also given a new opportunity to choose between thedifficult way that leads unto life, and the broad way that leads to perdition.By the so-called “second-sight” I have seen the most important events in my life, beforethey happened in reality. I shall only state one example. Before I had got my B.A. degree at theUniversity of Copenhagen, I once, during meditation, suddenly found myself sitting in a lectureroom at the university, giving a lecture to a large audience. When the vision had faded away, Ithought that it might signify that some day I would be sitting in that lecture room as a professor.Unfortunately this interpretation was wrong, but still the vision came true, as some time later myprofessor invited me to give a series of lectures on medieval mysticism which took place in just thesame lecture room that I had seen in my vision.Once I decided to try if I should be able, by an act of will, to break through the barrier of timeand space, and to project my consciousness back into the past and also out into the future, to acertain place and time, and to watch the events that had once taken place, respectively were going totake place there. These experiments proved successful, and in every case I got a verification.I have examined the nature of the astral body and its relation to the physical body, and I havefound that our consciousness is by no means dependent on the physical brain, whereas our physicalbody is throughout dependent on the astral body. It simply cannot move a single muscle, when theastral body is withdrawn.In my astral body I have been walking in the streets of Copenhagen, trying in vain toinfluence people, and I have visited places where I had not been before, in order to get averification, when later I went there in my physical body. In every case I got a verification, andtwice I have been seen by persons who were present and who afterwards told me about my peculiarappearance. As I was able to tell them what they had been doing during my astral visit, they wereobliged to believe that I had really been present.I might also mention that I have once, together with a spirit-friend, visited a subterraneancity. It was indeed a peculiar experience to go downwards into the earth and find a bright and121WHAT BECOMES OF THE SOUL AFTER DEATH"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"beautiful city. My spirit-friend took me to a great temple in Greek style with columns of marble,where I met the leader of the city who told me about the work which took place there.Once I discovered that I was able, through intense concentration, to dematerialise andrematerialise physical matter, and of course it was both astonishing and interesting; I have,however, made no further experiments in that direction, as I am more interested in taking time tomeditate on the mysterious regions in the inner world, whose sublime and glorious beauty andfineness cannot be described, as our language has no words to cover those extraordinaryexperiences.I have often been asked about my Sadhanas, and first of all I might mention, that I havefound that, more than any exercise, it is the burning desire that opens the door for the influx from onhigh.It is the complete surrender, the opening of mind and soul to the eternal Spirit, that opens thecentres. I have heard about aspirants who cannot understand why they have had no results, althoughthey have practised Yoga-exercises during a long period of years, and I feel convinced that it is thefervent yearning for union with the supreme Spirit that is lacking. It is, however, of greatimportance to pray or meditate before going to sleep, and thereby to cleanse the mind from earthlythoughts, before entering the subconscious state during sleep. I always try both to deepen and toexpand my consciousness before sleeping, in order to get in connection with the Great within,which is always in close touch with the heavenly spheres. I dare say, that the deepening of theconsciousness before sleeping is one of the most important exercises. I also meditate in the morningand thereby get the necessary strength for my daily work, and when resting during the day I try toplace my consciousness in touch with the divine Spirit and to forget my personal self. When feelingthe higher power mysteriously moving in the depths of our mind, we should not be afraid but keepquiet and thoroughly receptive then we are anointed by the spirit.—K.M., Copenhagen (Denmark)GLOSSARYAAchara: Right conduct.Acharyas: Teachers;
