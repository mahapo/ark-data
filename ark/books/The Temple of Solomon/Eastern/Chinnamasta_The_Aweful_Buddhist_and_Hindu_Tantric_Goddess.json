So to cast light on a goddess that was strangely obscure and yet implicates any Indian goddess properly to be called wondrous or arousing of awe. Although completed in the United States, her treatise does not follow a History of Religions approach with a baggage of technical terms. Be-sides, Dr. Benard avoids the guessing and SJXculations that characterized some previous references to this goddess. Throughout she employs a direct communication with the reader while soberly basing her conclu-sions oh stated sources. One welcome feature of Benard's book is the translation of much material from the Sakta Pramoda. Another fine feature is the treatment of the goddess's names, both the 108 and 1, 000 list. Her classification of the names by the rasas of Hindu drama is probably unique. This work is a solid contribution to the theories of the Hindu and Buddhist Tantras and their symbolism, in particular as related to the goddess.

Both her names mean the \"one with the severed-head\" because she holds hero'P.'Tl head in her hand. The sadhana in the Sadhanamala describes ChinnamuQQa as one \"who is of yellow colour, who holds in her left hand her own severed head which she severed with her own scimitar (karq\") held in her right hand .... She is nude ... streams of blood issuing from the severed body fall into the mouth of her severed head and into the mouths of the two Yoginls on either side of her.\" This paradoxical goddess, overwhelms and initially frightens. She pushes one beyond dualities into the realm of the uncon-ditioned and unconditional-a spiritual experience eagerly sought but frightening and repelling when actually experienced. One is reminded of Arjuna's vision of Kr~J:ta as God in the Bhagavad Gita, Arjuna exclaims: Having seen what was never seen before, I am astonished, and my heart is shaken with fear. Show me, 0 God, that same form of Yours (as before)! Be merciful, Lord of Gods, Refuge of the World! (11 :45) Arjuna 's ordinary reality is exploded into a million parts which destroyed the' human-constructed' limits. This experience of unconditioned reality is both marvellous and frightening; later in this book Chinnamasta's hundred and eight names and one thousand names will illustrate this paradoxical and awe-inspiring combination of the marvellous and furious. Rudolf Otto described the nature of unconditioned reality as that which makes a person stand in awe (tremendum) and simultaneously fascinates one (fascinas). Chinnamasta is an aweful goddess in this sense. She is also a paradoxical one who non-verbally indicates uncondi-tioned reality. Practitioners apply this teaching to become liberated from cyclic existence. Unfortunately, one primarily finds Chinnamasta in sen-sational 'Tantric art' books which portray Tantra as exotic sexual practices or degenerate perversions. In these books explanations of Chinnamasta are brief and superficial. In reality, however, Chinnamasta indicates a transcendence of the ordinary or portrays the ordinary as extraordinary."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"xii Incrcxluction There is a famous story about the Buddha who once taught in an enig-matic way, by holding a flower. Everyone waited patiently for the teach-ing to begin; only MahakaSyapa smiled. The Buddha smiled with him. The teaching was concluded. An ordinary flower evoked the experience of understanding the non-duality of ordinary/extraordinary. Chinnamasta uses her ordinary body in an extraordinary manner; she is able to function with a severed head. Chinnamasta, this 'awcful' goddess, is a Tantric goddess par excel-lence. A single definition ofT antra is vety difficult because of the variety of Tantric traditions existing in the world-from Kashmir Saivism and llindu Sakta, etc. in India to a variety of Buddhist Tantras in ;\\1epal, Tibet, and japan. Many contemporary Hindu ascetics define Tantra. as action done with the lxJdy (tanii) for the purpose of protecting/bringing about release (era). One etymology ofT antra divides the word into two roots, tan to stretch or expand and tra to save or protect. By combining these two roots, Tantra means the increase of methods available in order to liberate oneself from cyclic existence. Ideally, these methods should be efficacious and expedient. Furthermore, in researching about Tantra, one realizes the importance of the human lx >dy as the principal instrument t( >r liberation rather than an impediment as propounded in other traditions. The body consists of numerous levels of subtlety and all Tantric tradi-tions agree that a subtle body is composed of subtle channels (nac)is) and winds (praiJa), which circulate in the subtle channels. Furthermore they agree on the existence of three principal subtle channels, two ancillary ones which crisscross around a central channel. The subtle winds e< >ursc through the two ancillary channels but in most people the subtle wind cannot enter the central channel because the two ancillary ones form knots at the points where they crisscross it. As long as the subtle winds cannot enter the central one, one experiences the duality of ordinary reality. By yogic methods one learns to untie these 'knots' thereby opening the central channel. When the subtle winds course through the central channel, the dichotomy of conditioned and unconditioned disap-pears. I would argue that Chinnamasta anthropomorphically represents this central channel, her two anendants represent the two ancillary subtle channels; their feet are intertwined with Chinnamasta's thereby replicat-ing the two ancillary channels which are intertwined with the central channel ncar the navel. Moreover, there are three bloodstreams and if correctly depicted the right bloodstream enters the right anendant's mouth, the left bloodstream the left attendant's mouth, and the central one is drunk by Chinnamasta. Since the attendants drink only from the right or left respectively, this indicates that they do not know the yogic process"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Introduction xiii of manipulating the winds into the central channel. They experience the duality of ordinary reality. In contrast Chinnamasta, a great yoginl, drinks her own blood from the central channel, thereby experiencing the col-lapse of duality. Thus Chinnamasta is the Tantric goddess par excellence because she represents the essential instrument and method of achieving liberation through the Tantric-yogic process of the manipulation of the subtle winds coursing through the subtle channels. Who is sht!? Her legends are few but consistencies are apparent throughout the diverse material ranging from the Mahasiddha and Tantric tradition to the Punit).as. Among the Hindu legends, Chinnamasta is Siva's consort and in the Sakta Mahabhagvata Pural)a, she is one of the Dasa Mahavidyas (ten gre2t knowledge goddesses). In the Buddhist tradition she is connected with the Mahasiddha tradition, especially the female Mahasiddhas, Mekhala, Kanakhala, and most importantly, Lak~mlnkar~!. Many of Chinnamur:tqa sadhanas included Lak~mlnkara in their transmis-sion lineages. In both the traditions she is an unusual emanation of a popular goddess: in llinduism Durga; and in Buddhism Vajravarahi-Vajrayogini. Various scholars assert a different origin for her. Some scholars, such as B. Bhattacharyya, hold that she is originally a Buddhist creation and is incorporated by the llindus. Some Hindu scholars do not even consider the possibility for a non-I lindu origin, such as Shankaranarayanan who claim a Vedic antecedent. Since Chinnarnasta is a rare form of a popular goddess, few know much about her. When I visited a Hindu temple dedicated to Chinnamasta, the ritual priests, whose family have been the priests for centuries, were surprised and delighted that Chinnamasta was worshipped in Nepal, Tibet, and Mongolia. Likewise, the Tibetan Buddhist practitioners wanted to know more about the Hindu Chinnamasta. Both Buddhism and Hinduism have Tantric traditions and the nascence of Tantra is obscure. Extant Buddhist texts of Chinnamur:t<;la indicate an earlier origin than the Hindu ones; however, oral teachings must have preceded the texts. With these difficulties of overlapping between the two traditions and the uncertainty of the birth ofTantra, a definitive Hindu or Buddhist origin of Chinnamastacannot be asserted. This is the first monograph which examines Chinnamasta 's rituals, her names and forms (naman1pa) and their symbolism by comparing and contrasting her sadhanas (spiritual practices) in Hinduism and Ruddhism. The entire Hindu 'Chinnamastatantra' section from the Sakta Pramoda, the Buddhist 'Chinnamui}Qa Vajravarahi sadhana' and Trikayavajrayogini stuti' are translated for the first time into English. Since Chinnamasta is a rare goddess, her texts were not popularized or made 'fashionable'"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"xiv Introduction according to the dictates of a particular group at a particular time. The earliest extant texts date from the ninth and tenth centuries-a time when Hindu and Buddhist Tantras were developing under common influences and in the same places in India.

In the Hindu tradi-tion Chinnamasta is associated with the popular goddess Durga, as one of her ten manifestations known as the Dasa Mahavidyas.1 The Sanskrit word mahavidya is a combination of the adjective maha meaning great or supreme and the noun vidya which is from the verbal root vid meaning to know, to learn, to ascertain, to experience. ( Vidis a direct cognate with the English verb 'to wit'.) By combining maha with vidya, one can translate the word mahavidya as supreme knowledge. 2 From the Hindu perspective supreme knowledge is soteriological, i.e. knowledge which reveals the way of releasing oneself from the bonds of cyclic existence or sa.rpsara. The ultimate goal of all Hindus is to achieve mok~ or liberation from the snares of 53J!lSara. Thus as a Mahavidya, Chinnamasta embody-ing this essential knowledge, helps beings in achieving mok~. MAHABHAGAVATAPURA~A In chapter eight of the tenth-century Sakta Mahabhagavata PuraQa we find the earliest account of the Da5a Mahavidyas.3 In the Mahabhaga\"·aca Pur3I)a the popular Hindu God Siva extolls the glory of the Hindu God-dess Durga in her multiple manifestations to Sage Narada.4 Chapter four through chapter twelve relate Durga's manifestation as Sati, daughter of Prajapati Dak~a. In chapter four she weds Siva and in chapter eight Siva recounts to Sage Narada Sati's insistence on attending the great sacrifice (yajii3) performed by her father. Though this legend of Dak~a's great sacrifice is well kno~n from the fourth century, in this version the Devi (the great Goddess) eclipses Siva's greatness as the more potent force. In the beginning of chapter eight Sati is portrayed as a dutiful Hindu wife"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"2 Chinnamasta asking her husband's permission to attend her father's sacrifice. Since they were not invited by Oak~. Siva insisted that she should not go. However, Sati insisted that they did not need an invitation because she was Dak~a·s daughter. Since all entreaties failed, Sati decided to remind Siva that she was no ordinary woman but a powerful being with awesome aspects. Siva narrated the confrontation to Sage Narada as follows:5 Instantly her eyes reddened with anger. Sali thought (to herseiO, \"Siva had received me as his wife by my choice but today he censured and slighted me. I will show him my power.\" Seeing the goddess with her lips trembling with anger and her eyes blazing like the conflagration at the end of an aeon, Siva closed his eyes. Suddenly she displayed her terrible teeth in her fierce mouth and laughed. Observing this, Siva became very afraid and trembled with an averted face. With much diffi-culty, he reopened his eyes and beheld a terrible form. Abandoning her golden clothes, Sati's skin became discolored. She was nude with dishev-elled hair, a lolling tongue and four arms; her black body was covered with sweat. Decorated with a garland of skulls, she was exceedingly fierce and had a frightful roar. On her head was a crescent moon and a crown as luminous as the rising sun. 'In this terrific form blazing with her own effulgence, she roared and stood in all her glory before Siva. Bewildered with fright, Siva forsook her and trembling with an averted face, he fled in all directions as if deluded. With a terrific laugh, Sali roared and said to him, \"Don't be afraid.\" Hearing these sounds, terrified Siva swiftly fled in all directions. Seeing her husband overpowered by fear, Sati became merciful and having only the desire to restrain him, she appeared in a transcendent form in each of the ten directions. In whichever direction Siva fled, she was there. Seeing one terrible form, Siva ran in another direction in order to escape but he was always confronted by another one. Siva remained still and shut his eyes. When he reopened them, he saw before him the Dark One (Syama which is another name for Kali), whose smiling face was like a fully-opened lotus. Nude with large breasts, with fierce, wide eyes, dishevelled hair and four arms, she blazed like ten million suns as she stood in the southern direction. Seeing Syama, Siva overcome with fear asked, \"Who are you, 0 Dark One? Where is my beloved Sati?\" Sali replied, \"Siva, do you not see that I am Sali who is before you. Kali, Tara, Lokesikamala, Bhuvanesvari, Chinnamasta, ~o<;tasi, Tripurasundari, Bagalamukhi, Dhumavati, and Matangi are my forms. \"6 Siva spoke, \"If you are satisfied with me, 0 Supportress of the World Oagaddhatri), please tell me clearly which form is whose?\" Sati replied, \"The black one with the fierce eyes who is in front of you is Kali.

To your right (in the east) the very frightening goddess with the severed head is Chinnamasta, 0 Magnani-mous One. To your left (in the west) is Bhuvanesvari.

In the northwest comer is the Mahavidya Matangi, in the northeast is the Mahavidya SC>Qasi, and at the na(iir is Bhairavi. 0 Siva, do not be afraid; these are my supreme forms and pervade within all my other fonns.7 The chapter continues with the proper mode of worshipping them with mantra (mystical syllables), yantra (mystical diagrams), puja (ritual wor-ship), homa (fire offering ritual), pura.5caraJ:la (repetition of the name with fire offerings), stotra (praises), and kavaca (protection syllables).8 Who-ever worships in this fashion will attain the special abilities to destroy (enemies), to expel, to agitate, to bewilder, to put to flight, to stupefy, and to create enmity.9 The chapter concludes: I am your dearest and you are my dear husband. I shall go to my father's sacrifice in order to destroy his pride. Even if you do not go, you should give me your permission. This is my greatest desire. Whethc:r you give me permission or not, I shall go and destroy the sacrifice of my father Prajapati Dak~a. Siva spoke to Sage Narada, \"Hearing her words, I was paralyzed with fear and said to fierce· eyed Kali, 'I know that you arc Paramc5vari (Supreme Goddess), the best and complete Prakrti. Please forgive me for what I uttered in delusion. You are the primordial, supreme knowledge which exists in everything. You arc abiding in every particle, autono-mous and you are the supreme power (saktt). You are beyond all correct and incorrect actions. If you wish to go, 0 Sati, in order to de<>troy the sacrifice, what power do I have to prevent you! In delusion, whatever I said as a husband, please forgive me. 0 Sati, do what pleases you.' \" Sati, the mother of the universe, with a slight smile spoke. \"0 Lord, you stay here with your attendants. I am going to my father's sacrifice.\" Having said this, the form of Mahavidya Tara in the zenith and all other eight forms merged into the form of Kali. Then Sali in the form of Kali went in a beJewelled chariot drawn by 10,000 lions to her father's sacri-fke.10 'This episode in the Mahabhagavara PuraQa states that the Dasa Mahavidyas are Durga's supreme forms and pervade all other forms.11 Mahavidya· Chinnamasta, who is in the east, is described as a frightening goddess holding her own severed head. In Hinduism, the eastern direction is an auspicious one in contrast to the southeast direction which is inauspicious because of its connection with the realm of the dead. The eastern direction symbolizes regeneration or a renewal, such as a new day begin-ning in the eastern direction. Chinnamasta has similar connotations of renewal and being beyond death. just as l!~s. the Vedic goddess of dawn \"is young, being born again and again, though ancient; shining with a uniform hue, she wastes away the life of mortals\" (Jjgveda 1.92: 10) and"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"4 Chinnamas£3 \"as she has shone in former days, so she shines now and will shine in the future, never ageing, immortal\" (1.113: 13-15), 12 similarly Chinnamasta has this potential for renewal and the quality of being beyond death. Chinnamasta does not have Vedic antecedents; however, these praises to the Vedic U$as illustrate how the eastern direction is associated with auspiciousness and renewal. Furthermore, by this association with the east, Chinnamasta represents the aspects of the goddess symbolizing transition and cyclic renewal-the continuous process of creation, preser-vation, destruction, and re-creation. As U$aS does not age nor decay, Chinnamasta, even with a decapitated head, remains perpetually an op-timum sixteen-year-old unaffected by her unusual circumstances. Though decapitated she defies death and remains a potent force in the universe. Seeing one aspect of the sun at dawn, we see one aspect of the Goddess as Chinnamasta. Thus Chinnamasta's association with the east indicates auspicious renewal of the process of life and death. TilE SAKTA PiTHAS In the !J~kta Pi{ has Sircar states that this story of Sati and her death has been retold and elaborated in the Indian literature, such as in Kalidasa's Kumarasambhava (I, 21), the Devlbhagavata Pural)a (VII, chap.30), and Kalika Punil)a (chap.18) wherein inconsolable Siva slung Sati' s body over his shoulder and danced the wild destructive Tit:t<;iava dance. 13 The gods, fearing the destruction of the world, asked Vi$I)U to intervene and pleaded with Siva to stop this dance of grief. Overcome by sadness, Siva did not stop. Vi~I)u with his discus cut off parts of Sati's body. As Siva danced, the place where each part of the Sati's body fell in India, is known as a sakta pifha, a holy seat of the goddess. In Sircar' s extensive list of satka pifhas, Chinnamasta is not included. 14 However, at a temple dedicated to Chinnamasta in CintapDfl)i, Himachal Pradesh, the ritual priests (puj;iri) stated that this temple is indeed the p1{ha where Sati's forehead (Skt. mastaka) fell. Though no textual proof can confirm this, the devotees, who come to this temple, do believe that this is the sakta pifha of the goddess's forehead (mastaka). While the date of establishing this CintapDn:U temple is unclear, currently it is an important Devi temple among the Devi worshippers who make pilgrimages to Himachal Pradesh.1s Thus, Chinnamasta or Chinnamastaka, which literally means \"the severed head or fore headed one\", is identified with the Great Goddess as part of Sati, as well as one of the Dasa Mahavidyas. In the .5akta Pi{ has there is the interesting correspondence of the Dasa Mahavidyas with the ten avatars of Vi~I)u. Sircar states that the Dasa"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Legends and Origin ofChinnamast:i 5 Mahavidyas are a \"late medieval Sakta adaptation of the Dasavatara conception\",16 and he cites the Guhyatiguhya Tantra as giving the correspondence between the ten avatars ofVi$I:1U and the ten Mahavidyas: Kr~t:ta and Kali, Rama and Tara, Narasif!'lha and Chinnamasta, Vamana and Bhuvanesvari, Parasurama and Sundari, Matsya and Dhumavati, Kiirma and Bagala, Balarama and Bhairavi, Buddha and Mahalak~mi, Kalki and DurgaP This Guhyatiguhya Tantra list does not seem to be a traditional list; the boar incarnation is omitted and both Kr~I).a and Balarama are included. Since the boar avatar is one of the oldest avatars, and the legend is mentioned in the Taittinya Sarphit:i and the Satapacha Br:ihmaiJa, it is surprising that he is omitted here.18 Moreover, the uncommon inclusion of both J<.r$I)a and Balarama (not to be confused with Rama or Para5urama) on the same list and the omission of two of the usual Dasa Mahavidyas, Kamala and Matangi, are surprising. A more traditional list can be found in the Mur:u;lam:il:i: Kr~t:ta and Kali, Rama and Tarit:ti, Varaha and Rhuvana, Narasif!'lha and Bhairavi, Vamana and Dhiimavati, Bhrgukula and Chinna, Matsya and Kamala, Kiirma and Bagalamukhi, Buddha and Matangi, Kalika and So<;lasi.19 The Tantric texts containing a correspondence between the ten avatars of Vi~Q.u and the ten Mahavidyas are few and are not well known texts. 20 Kinsley disagrees with Sircar, saying, \"The ten Mahavidays, however, are more than a Sakta version of the Vai~Q.ava ten avatars, or at least the Mahavidyas differ significantly from the avatars in appearance and func-tion.\"21 ~either the Guhyatiguhya Tantra nor the Mur:u;iamal:i Tantra explains this correspondence of the Dasa Mahavidyas and the Vi~Q.u's avatars. However, one may speculate why there is a correspondence ofNarasirpha and Chinnamasta in the Guhy:itiguhya Tantra. In Narasirpha legend, Narasirpha had to defeat the leader of the asuras (rivals to the gods), Hiral).yakasipu, who had received a boon which made him almost invin-cible. I lis boon provided that he was never to be killed by \"the striking and throwing of weapons of my enemies, thunderbolts ... by water or fire ... free from the threats of gods, daitya, seers, siddha, and whatever other beings you have created ... not be slain in heaven, on earth, in the daytime, at night, from neither above nor below. In order to kill HiraQ.yakasipu, Vi~I).u became neither man nor beast but a combination"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"6 Gninnamasta of the two, a man-lion, and killed him with his claws at sunset which was neither day nor night. Examining this myth, one sees the importance of the liminal quality which is \"neither this or that\". Vi~l)u became neither a man nor a lion, killing at sunset which was neither day nor night. This ambiguous combination of the best of both the human and animal realms enhanced Vi~r:tu 's supreme power, rather than diminished it. Chinnamasta epito-mizes this ambiguity by her arresting form in which she is alive, yet decapitated. She has the power of being invulnerable to death. Being beyond the cycle of birth and death, she can help others surmount cyclic existence. As Narasirpha is a form ofVi~l)u who defies categorization and is more potent for being beyond categorization, so is Chinnamasta who challenges classification by her liminal quality of transcending birth and death.l2 The correspondence between Chinnamasta and Parasurama (Bhrgukula) from the Mur:Kjam:il:i's list is an interesting one. Parasunima is the son of Rer:tuka who is equated by some to be another name for the GoddessChinnamasta.23 In the Mahahh:irata(3.117.5-19), Rer:tuka, the wife of jamadagni, observed the king of celestial musicians, Citraratha, in lustful enjoyment with the heavenly ap53J':i. I laving the desire to enjoy her husband in a similar fashion, she lost her normal brilliance emanating from her virtuous feelings. jamadagni, sc...-eing this loss of brilliance and learning of its cause through his meditation, ordered his eldest son to kill his mother, but the son refused. Of jamadagni' s five-sons only the youngest, Parasur<l.ma, consented to kill his mother on the condition that she would be reborn purified. He performed the deed and, not remembering what had occurred, Rel)uka returned to life pure and resplendent. In this episode Rel)uka is considered a chinnamasta, one with a severed head. We note, however, that in this instance Rer:tuka was a passive recipient of the beheading and not the Goddess Chinnamasta who actively and con-sciously severed her own head. In Kaly:il}a, Vasudeva Agrawala interpreted esoterically the Rel)uka myth. 24 Rel}u or ReiJuka means 'semen'. Her five sons are the five cakras of the body and Parasurama represents the smallest cakra, the visuddha Oit. very pure) cakra, located at the throat. 25 The forest where Citrara'tha and his nymphs played symbolizes the mind as an abode of lust. A mind stimulated hy sexual energy prevents a yogi from establishing mastery over himself. The only way to gain control is by burning the lust and bringing the semen up to the fifth cakra, the visuddha cakra. This asso-ciation of Parasur.ima with the visuddha cakra helps one in understanding an esoteric significance of Chinnamasta 's severed throat. It is exactly at"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Legends and Origin ofChinnamasta 7 this cakra that one can gain mastery over oneself, unaffected by lust. Chinnamasta depicted as standing over a couple in sexual union symbol-izes her invulnerability to the sway of sexual passion and thereby she is capable of bringing the 'blood' up to her visuddha cakra. This ability signifies that Chinnamasta is a masterful yogin. Thus in these two Tantras, Chinnamasta's association with Narasi111ha or with Parasurama is an esoteric one on many levels. In the Pr.iJ)ato~ii)ftant.ra, a compilation of the Tantric texts, 26 there is a story of the origin of Chinnamasta from the Narada Pancaratra: One day Parvati went to bathe in the Mandakini river (above Haridvar, U.P.) with her auendants jaya and Vijaya. After bathing, the great god-dess' colour became black because she was sexually aroused. After some time, her two auendants asked her, \"Give us some food. We are hungry.\" She replied, \"I shall give you food but please wait.\" After a while, again they asked her. She replied, \"Please wait, I am thinking about some matters.\" Waiting a while, they implored her, \"You are the mother of the universe. A child asks everything from her mother. The mother gives her children not only food but also coverings for the body. So that is why we are praying to you for food. You are known for your mercy; please give us food.\" Hearing this, the consort of Siva told them that she would give them anything when they reached home. But again her two atten-dants, Qakini and Van:tini begged her, \"We are overpowered with hun-ger, 0 Mother of the Universe! Give us food so we may be satisfied, 0 Merciful One, Bestower of Boons and Fulfiller of Desires.\"27 Hearing this true statement, the merciful goddess smiled and severed her head with her fingernails. 28 As soon as she severed her head, her he-ad fell on the palm of her left hand. Three bloodstreams emerged from her throat; the left and right fell respectively into the mouths of her flanking attendants and the central fell into her mouth. After performing this, all were satisfied and later returned home. (From this act) Parvati became known as Chinnamasta. 29 Also in the Pr.iJ)at~iiJftant.ra, one finds a similar story of Chinnamasta' s origin from the Svatant.ratantra. Siva narrates: I shall tell you of the emergence of Chinnamasta, Tara, and Kalika. In the Krta Yuga on Mt. Kailasa, the best of mountains, Mahamaya was engaged in Mahavrata with me. At the time of my seminal emission, she appeared fierce and from her body two 5aktis emerged who became her two attendants known as Qakini and Va11,1ini. One day CaQc;ianayika with her two attendants wem to the bank of the Pu~pabhadra river [Bengal?). When it was noon, her hungry attendants asked CaQQika, \"Please give us food.\" Hearing this, the smiling and auspicious CaQc;iika looked in all directions and severed her head. With the left bloodstream, she satisfied"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"8 Chinnamasta I~akini, with the right one, she satisfied Van:tini and from the central one, she drank her own blood. After playing in this way, she replaced her head on her body and assumed her original form. At dusk, they returned home. When I saw her pale appearanee, I suspected that she was abused by another. This infuriated me. From this anger a ponion of me arose and became known as Krodha Bhairava. This happened on the day of Viraratri. Thus Chinnamasta was born on Viraratri.30 These two similar stories explain the emergence of Chi nnamasta as a form of Siva's consort. The Narada Pancar:itra story emphasizes the greatness of Chinnamasta eulogized by her two attendants: \"0 Mother of the Universe, 0 Merciful One, Bestower of Boons and FulfLller of Desires .... \" This story stresses Chinnamasta's mercy and power in feeding her two anendants with her own blood. The Svatantratantra story, which is also centered on the theme of feeding her ancndants, includes many ancillary details which are lacking in the Narada Pancaracra story. The Narada Pancaratra story states that Parvati became black through sexual arousal but there is no specific explanation why she became sexually aroused or any continuation of this idea in this story, whereas the Svatantratantra story begins and ends with this idea. Moreover, the Svatantratantra story explains the emergence ofChinnamasta's two attendants, the Krodha Bhairava form of Siva, and Siva's consort form as Chinnamasta, as well as explaining that all this occurred on the night of Viraratri. A third important detail is that the Svatantratantra story states, \"After playing in this way .... \" In llinduism, this concept of lila which can be understood as divine play, ease, or 'child's play', appearance, charm and pretcnce.31 Also she looked in all directions and continued to smile as she severed her head. This indicates a sense of spatial and temporal pervasiveness or power which transcends space and time. In this suspended moment destruction and creation occur simultaneously because she decapitates herself and feeds her attendants and herself. Mircea Eliade referred to such an event as coincidentia oppositorum and as a special feature of divinity. Eliade stated that \"the actual structure of the divinity ... transcends all attributes and reconciles all contraries. \"32 Chinnamasta displays her divinity by such act, and demonstrates that she was 'playing' and was unaffected except for a temporary paleness. Thus, the Svatantratantra story presupposes that the readers arc familiar with the story of Chinnamasta's origin but includes other details which are less familiar, whereas, the Narada Pancaratra story aims at extolling and praising the greatness of Chinnamasta. Both H. Bhattacharya in 1/induder Dcvdcvi and P. Pal in Hindu Reli-gion and Iconology theorize about the Narada Pancaratra story in the Pr:iiJato~5il)itantra. H. Bhattacharya states that Chinnamasta symbolizes"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Legends and Origin ofChinnamasta 9 the incomplete Dak~a sacrifice where Dak~a was beheaded by Siva's attendants. Since Siva destroyed the sacrifice, the conson of Siva, who is the narure of the yajna (sacrifice), also has a severed head (chinnamasta). 33 P. Pal does not accept Bhattacharya's theory and presents his explanation as follows: The obvious implication here is· of primal sacrifice and renewal of cre-ation. The goddess sacrifices herself, and her blood, drunk by her attendants, renews or resusdtates the universe .... Therefore beheading her own head is a temporary expedient to provide food and appears to be a more sanguinary manifestation of the goddess as Sakambhari and AnnapurQa.'4 Both Bhattacharya and Pal interpret the theme of the story as a sacrifice. The Hindu pantheon abounds with munificent goddesses, such as Lak$ffii, Annapun:ta, and the more recent Santo~ima, who are expected to fulfil their promises or meet the demands made by their worshippers, just as Oakini and Van:Uni expected Parvati to feed them. But I am unaware of any other goddess who decapitates herself in order to feed her attendants and herself and then replaces her head on her body after the act is completed. This is a unique feature of Chinnamasta. In the BrhadaraJ}yaka Upani~ad(l.4.6.) it states, \"The whole (world) is just food and the eater of food. (Etavad va idarp sarvarp annarp caivannadas ca.)\" In these legends of Chinnamasta, one sees both aspects of food and the eater of food in both dualistic and singular ways. In the dualistic way Chinnamasta is the food for her two attendants and they are the eaters of food. In the singular way Chinnamasta is both the food and the eater of food, thereby symbolizing the whole world by this act of being devoured and the devourer. The dichotomy of receiver and giver or object and subject collapses into one. Chinnamasta is not only the giver and the receiver, but also the given--she is the sacrificer, the sacrificed, and the recipient of the sacrifice. She is the sacrificer by decapitating herself, the sacrificed by the act of beheading, and the recipient of the sacrifice by drinking the blood. Thus Chinnamasta embodies the complete sacrificial process which sym-bolizes the entire world through its process of creation, destruction, and re-creation. \"CUf OFF YOUR HEADS\" In Buddhist tradition Chinnamur:tQa is the severed-head form ofVajravarahi or Vajrayogini.35 In Taranatha's Historical Works we find the Kahna pa 'i mam char(biography of the Mahasiddha Kr~r:tacarya).36 Kr$r:tacarya's"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"10 Chinnamasta biography contains excerpts of his disciples' biographies, including those of the two Mahasiddha sisters, Mekhala and Kanakhala. It states: When Kr~r:tacarya arrived in the south in Mahara~tra, two sisters lived there-the eldest was called Mekhala and the youngest Kanakhala. When they were ten and eight years old respectively, they were betrothed to two Brahmin youths, but both the youths were too young to marry. Some years later when the two sisters had still not become brides, the local people became very critical of them, but it was said to be due to the power of karma, not to any inherent fault of the girls that they remained unwed. The marriage discussions were broken off. Later the girls saw the acarya in company with his attendants who were all performing miracles, and they, filled with wonder, said, \"We are in great dread of saf!Jsira. Please show us a means of liberation from it.\" When they had thus begged the acarya, he saw that they were fit vessels, so empowered them and the very highest wisdom came to them. They practised the teachings and the follow-up teachings and in a short while they also attained the eight ritual gazes and all other powers. Walls, mountains, and waters no longer hindered them, and they auained both intellectual and spiritual powers. They continued to live around the acarya's assemblage and they held fast to their mental ascetic practices. Once when both of them were going along a certain road, they met many ordinary yogts, followers of Gorak~a. who mocked them and said, \"You are students of Kr~!Japa! Show us some illusions then!\" l'ow, as the abode of those so-called yogis was situated in a particularly beautiful spot, the girls performed a ritual gaze known as \"that which leads forth\" upon it, and they put the whole place down, unbroken, in a place which was a veritable desert, white in colour and not at all beautiful. The girls said to the yogis, \"Now you too will have to perform a trick like this,\" and they left. Later, when the Gorak~as hcgged them for forgiveness, their houses were returned to their previous site. On another occasion in Bengal, during the reign of King Lalitacandra,37 when the Mahacirya had seen that the time was right for converting the King, the two girls emerged from a throng of people surrounding the acarya, and paying homage to his feet said, \"By the grace of the Guru, we two have auained the very highest and greatest of goals, and now we wish to fly off to the heavens. However, before that we will be happy to do whatever the acarya requests us to do.\" The acarya replied,\"Well then, cut off your heads and offer them to me.\" The girls drew from their mouths well-tempered swords of wisdom and cutting off their heads without any hindrance :lt all, offered them into the Guru's hands. Facing backwards, they danced off, rising higher and higher on the heavenly paths, finally disappearing into rainbow light. The goddess Srijiiana had also previously manifested a miracle similar to this, and even rik$asa and <;fakinis in their ordinary bodily forms started to demonstrate it in considerable numbers. As an antidote to this activity, Vajravarahi herself appeared in that form, with her head severed, and it is said that this appeared frequently thereafter amongst her siddha5.38"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Legends and Origin of Chinnamasta 11 Also in the bsTan srung rgya mtsho 'imam char, a collection of biographies of protectors, compiled by Sle lung rje drung bZhad pa'i rdo rjc (b. 1 697) there is a story of a protectoress of Kongpo, Kong btsun de mo. 39 This story is excerpted from Thugs rje chen po ngan so rang gro/Oit.

She relates her past to him, \"Previously in the west in the country of Orgyan, there was a king known as lndrahhuti. He had five sisters of whom the eldest known as Princess Lak~minkara became his conson.41 Her king-father sentenced her to severe punishment. She said, \"Father, you do not need to punish me, I will punish myself.\" Then with a golden razor, she severed her head and white blood flowed from her neck. She walked around the dty seven times, astonishing all the citizens who called her the great Chinnamur:tc,la Varahi.42 The summary of the rest of the story is that after several lifetimes, she was born in Kongpo, Tibet. In that lifetime, she became known as Kong btsun demo and met Padmasambhava at the Kongpo border. At that time, she promised to protect and assist great saints and dharma practitioners in the future.43 In these two Buddhist stories, the origin of the Buddhist Goddess Vajravard.hi in her severed head form, i.e. Chinnamul)c;ia Vajravarahi, is not explained; however, one finds manifestations of her. The two stories are connected with three female Mahasiddhas: in Taranatha's story the two sisters Mckhala and Kanakhala arc the focus; Orgyan las'phro gling pa's story relateS the previous life of Princess Lak~kara, the great Mahasiddha. Their own biographies, found in Abhayadatta's account of the eighty-four Mahasiddhas, do not state that they practised the sadhana of the Chinnamul)<;ia form, but in the Tangyur these three are authors of the sadhanas of ChinnamuQ<;ia VajravarahiNajrayogini. Since in the few stories which exist about ChinnamuQ<;ia Vajravarahi, the Mahasiddhas play a principal role, this form ofVajravarahi, is connected closely with the Buddhist Siddha tradition. 44 In these Buddhist stories, unlike the Hindu ones, the theme is not of sacrifice. From the outset of Buddhism, blood sacrifice of animals was denounced as inhumane and unnecessary in achievmg Nirval)a. In the Ku{adanta Sutta (Digha Nik:iya, i, 127) the Buddha relates to the Brahmin KD\\adanta an incident from one of his previous lives. At that time, when"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"12 Chinnamasta the Buddha was the family priest of a king, he persuaded the king to perform a sacrifice which entailed no killing of oxen, goats, fowls, swine or other living things and no cutting of trees or grass.45 He thereby encouraged the king that if one performs a sacrifice, one should perform it without a blood sacrifice of animals. Buddha did not condemn all types of sacrifice, because in thc}ataka Tales he sacrifices himself to a starving tigress and her cubs.46 The two Buddhist stories about Chinnamur:t<;la, however, are not discussing blood sacrifice or self-sacrifice; these two stories arc demonstrating yogic ability. In the Taranatha story, the two sisters were able to achieve the state of realization of non-duality as a result of their arduous and devoted practice. All inner and outer phenomena perceived as mind, Meditating with detachment, all has the same flavour. In supreme meditation without effort or striving, I found non-dual pure pleasure and perfect RuddhahoodY In the Orgyan las 'phro gling pa story, Lak~minkara was to be punished because of her seemingly incestuous relationship with brother. Lak~minkara, knowing that her father was misinterpreting her behaviour, displayed her yogic abilities in order that he could realize his ignorance. She wanted to eradicate her father's and the citizens' negative attitudes towards her and to evoke regret in them for criticizing her behaviour. Thus she performed the miracle of walking around the town holding her severed head, revealing to everyone that she was a s1ddha.48 Furthermore, in Tibetan Buddhist Tantra when one directly perceives voidness of inher-ent existence, one attains the path of vision.49 At this level of direct perception of voidness what ordinarily appears to be solid is no longer seen as solid. Lak~minkara is graphically displaying her realization of the voidness of self-nature depicting her non-attachment to self by severing her head. In summation, these two Buddhist stories reflect that the mani-festation ofVajravarahi in her form of Chinnamui)qa is connected with adept yogic ability. ORIGIN OF CHINNAMASTA/CHINNAM~I)A The best known theory of Chinnamasta' s Buddhist or Hindu < lrigin is from B. Bhattacharyya who wrote several articles about the influence of Bud-dhist Tantrism on I Iinduism. Editing various meditation manuals on deities, notably the Buddhist Sadhanamala, he formulated the theory that some Hindu deities must have been originally Buddhist ones, including"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Legends and Origin ofChinnamasta 13 Tara, Chinnamast:a and Manjugho~. In regard to Chinnamast:a, he com-pared Buddhist and Hindu meditations on her, mantras and iconography from the Buddhist Sadhanamala (dated 1165 c.E.), the Hindu Chinnamastakalpa of uncertain origin, and the Hindu Kr~Q.ananda Agamavag'i5a's Tantrasara (seventeenth century). He concluded that the Buddhist and Hindu Chinnamasta was the same goddess and 'identical in all details' .49a Indeed she is the same goddess but certain details are different. In the Hindu sadhana she stands on Rati and Kama who are in reversed sexual union ( viparita) and wears a snake as a sacred cord, but these elements are absent in the Buddhist sadhanas. He compared the mantras found in the three above-mentioned texts to establish the Buddhist precedence. The Buddhist Sadhanamala states that the names of the two attendants are prefixed with vajra (i.e. Vajravairocan'i and Vajravart).ani) and the main goddess' name is Sarvabuddha<;lakiru referring to the severed-head form ofVajrayogin'i. The prefix vajra is dropped in the mantra of the Hindu Tantrasara but the three names, I)akin1, Vart).ani, and Vairocan'i, remain and sarvabuddha(lit., all-awakened) becomes sarvasiddhi (lit. all-accomplished). In the Hindu Chinnamastakalpa sarvabuddha changes to sarvabuddhiOit. all-enlight-ened) and the prefix vajra reappears. Bhattacharyya does not note this directly but vajra is a principal adjective in the Buddhist Tantra, also known as the Vajrayana-the adamantine path. Hindus typically would not want to use the adjective vajra if indeed they incorporated a Buddhist mantra. Moreover, sarvabuddha which means all Buddhas or Awakened Ones would not be acceptable to Hindus; buddha was replaced with siddhi or buddhi. Bhattacharyya concluded that these words of the mantra are decidedly Buddhist. Thus by comparing the iconography, the dates of the manuscripts, and the mantras, Bhattacharyya concluded that Chinnarnasta is originally Buddhist and this statement has not been disputed by most scholars. 50 Bhattacharyya claimed that the Buddhist Chinnamasta, usually known as ChinnamuQ.<;ia Vajrayogini or Vajravarahi, was worshipped at least by the seventh century. The Sadhanamala states that Siddha Sabarapa (vari-ant spelling Sabar'ipa), disciple of Siddha Nagarjuna who flourished in the mid-seventh century, is credited with the introduction of a new cult of Vajrayogini which Bhattacharyya inferred to be that of ChinnamuQ.<;ia Vajrayogini. 51 Two Vajrayogin'i sadhanas are attributed to Siddha Sabara in the Tibetan commentarial canon, Tangyur, but neither of these sadhanas mention Chinnamut).<;ia Vajrayoginl.52 Moreover, Mahasiddha Sabara's sacred biography does not state that he either received or transmitted a"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"14 Chinnamasta meditation of Chinnamur:lC.~a Vajrayogiru. Though the Siddha Sahara connection is not apparent, Chinnamur.lQa Vajrayogini is associated with other Mahasiddhas.

The Tangyur has one sadhana by these two Mahasiddha sisters; it is entitled, \"The Practice of Instructions of the Three Swastikas (Nandyavarta traya mukhagama nama)\". In this sadhana one is told to visualize oneself as dhl~ bCad Ma Yum, i.e., Chinnamuryqa Vajravarahi, and near the end of the meditation, it is inferred that one visualizes replacing one's head.~ Thus, the meditational practice ofChinnamuryQ.a YaJravarahi was transmitted from Mahasiddha Kanhapa to the two Mahasiddha sisters, Mekhala and Kanakhala. Unfortunately, I have not been able to trace to whom the sisters transmitted this meditational practice, but it is certain that the teaching came to Tibet since it is in the Tangyur. The Mahasiddha, who is the most important in continuing the medi-tative practice of Chinnamuryqa Vajrayogiru which began in India and was transmitted to :'\\epa! and Tibet, is Lak~rnirikara, sister of King lndrabhuti. 55 Though neither the sacred biography of Laksmirikara nor that of her brother, King Indrabhuti, mentions any connection with Chinnamuryqa Vajrayogini, the Tangyurhas four .sadhanason Chjnnarnuryqa Vajrayogiru written by Lak~rniilkara or her disciples.

Therefore the lineage stems from Mahasiddha Lak~mirlkara, not Sahara. Though many scholars accept the Buddhist origin of Chinnamasta, some scholars disagree that she is originally Buddhist and present argu-ments for a Hindu origin. In The Ten Great Cosmic Pawers, S. Shankaranarayanan states: Chinnarnasta is the thunder clap and the lightning flash. \"Shining like a streak of lightning\" ( vidyullekheva bhasvara), says the Cpanishad That 1s why Chmnarnasta IS known as vajravauocaniya.

Tantra incorporates theological and philosophical beliefs from 'non-Tantric' Hinduism and Buddhism but its emphasis is actual practice. Concerning llindu Tantra, Gupta states, \"Tantra hardly rejects any form of religious ritualism; it juxtaposes its own particular ritual practices to normative (smarta) Hindu rituals. \"1 There-fore, Tantric practitioners engage in one or more practices, utilizing Tantric methods to attain siddhis, as well as the ultimate goal, liberation. Al-though the texts and methods are both diverse (Jnd vast, Tantric practi-tioners follow particular texts or methods dictated by their spiritual teacher (guru). HINDU SPIRITUAL PRACTICE Spiritual practices known as sadhanas consist of two broad groups, yoga and ritual worship (puja). Ritual worship is divided into three kinds: (1) those performed daily (nitya), (2) those performed on particular dates (naimittika), and (3) those performed for the fulfilment of a special desire or for averting misfortune (kamya). 2 In the Chinnamasta sadhanaswhich will be examined, the main focus is on daily ritual worship but some naimittika and kamya pujas are also included. In examining the Hindu Tantric practice of Chinnamasta, I shall con-centrate on the 'Chinnamastatantra' section of the popular .Sakta Pramoda which was compiled by King Devanandanasirpha of Muzaffarpur during the nineteenth century. From the late eighteen hundred'i to the present day, the Sakta Pramoda has been one of the must popular manuals of Tantric rituals for the practice of each of the ten Mahavidyas and the five main deities (parka dcvata).

The final text, the .Sri Chirmamast.a Nity:irr:ana, composed by Sri Swamiji Maharaja, is designed to help practitioners in their daily worship of Chinnamasta.5 Although Nity:ircana is similar to the two aforementioned texts, it elaborates on the preliminary practices as well as on the ritual worship section. I shall present the procedure for worshipping Chinnamasta according to the S:ikta Pramoda with addi-tional material from the Tantrasara and the Nity:ircana. DEFINITION OF TilE NINE SECfiONS OF RITIJAL PRACTICE In the Chinnarnastatantra of the Sakta Pramoda, the practice is divided into nine sections: (1) visualized meditation (dhy:ina); (2) drawing of yantra; (3) explication of the mantra; ( 4) ritual worship sequence (piijavidhil)}, (5) eulogy (stotra); (6) protective 'armour' (kavaca); (7) essence (h[daya); (8) hundred and eight names; and (9) one thousand names. 6 These nine sections will be discussed with special emphasis on the ritua! worship sequence, since it is the major section of daily worship. VrsuAUZED MmrrAnoN The visualized meditation of Chinnamasta is discussed in depth in chapter 5. DRAWING OF 1liE y ANTRA The drawing of the yancra is included in the discussion of ritual worship. ExPuCATION OF111E MANTRA In Indian civilization the role of sound and word has been investigated from the time of the Vedas to the present. In most Hindu rituals, mantras have a prominent part. 7 An etymology for mantra is the root man-which is associated with thought, will, and intentionality, and the suffix -tra which means an 'instrument of that which precedes it', i.e., an instrument of intention. Another meaning is that man is related to mind and -era means protection; hence a protection of/for the mind. Mantra as an instrument of intention and a protection for the mind is associated with liberation in Hindu rituals. The Prapancasaratantra V, 2, states that \"by"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"To w·orship a Deity 25 meditation on the place of ultimate principle (tattva) one is saved; thus it is named mantra.\"8 Each deity has a specific mantra and bija (seed syllable) which represent his/her essence. These mantras are believed to be of divine origin and are not arbitrarily assigned. By knowing the root mantra of a deity, in this case Chinnamasta, one can invoke her and experience her essence which will ultimately bring liberation. Chinnamasta's root mantra is composed of nineteen seed syllables, each corresponding to an important deity in the Hindu pantheon. Thus this one-root mantra is imbued with the essence of nineteen major deities who will assist the practitioner when requested. Knowledge of the root mantra is necessary for practice. Its power is enormous, and it is kept secret to protect it from being misused. RlruAL WoRSIDP PROCEDuRE (Pir}AVIDIDI:f) Ritual worship (pujavidhil)) consists of regular preliminaries, Tantric regu-lar preliminaries, invocation of the deity and the fire ceremony .9 Regular preliminaries 1.

Valediction of the deity ( visarjan~) Fire ceremony Burnt offerings with the repetition of Chinriamasta's mantras Prior to any worship in Hindu practice the place and ritual instruments must be cleaned, purified, and consecrated.10 Once the place and objects have been consecrated the practitioner must also undergo purification and consecration. Regular preliminaries are not mentioned in the Sakta Pramoda since it is assumed that a practitioner knows them and will perform them. This includes the remembrance upon awakening of one's guru and chosen deity (~adevata), bathing (snana), expulsion of mental impurities (aghamar$3.Qa), and peace offerings (tarpa.Qa) to the deities, the seers, the forefathers, lineage of gurus, and one's chosen deity in order to invoke their blessings and establish a spiritual bond with them. One must purify and transform one's body in order to worship because in I lindu practice, all practitioners must become 'divine' before worshipping a deity.11 With the completion of the regular preliminaries one begins the regular Tantric preliminaries as described in the next section. Regular Tantric Preliminaries 1. Acama.na is the ablution of the body by initially washing one's lips and hands, then with these purified lips saying certain mantras as one touches specific parts of the body with purified hands. Vidyamava states that \"acamana is the purification par excellence. It is to be performed after every act in which there might be the slightest suspicion ofimpurity.\"12 2. Prifl;Jilyama and Sixfold Nyasa consist of pra.Qayama which is the regulation and control of two of the subtle winds in the body. These winds are prti.Qa, the upward moving subtle wind and apana, the down-ward moving subtle wind; together they represent a being's respiration. The winds run through three main subtle channels (na<;lis): the central channel, su~l711)a; the left channel, k)a; and to the right channel, piriga/a. When the two subtle winds flow through the left-i¢i, the mind is concen-trated and introverted; whereas when the two subtle winds flow through the right, the pirigala, the mind is scattered and extroverted. Normal breathing is done through one of these channels and does not alternate regularly with each breath between these two channels. Pri..Qay:ima is a method of regulating the breath so that inhalation (piiraka), maintaining"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"ToWorshipaDeity 27 the breath (kumbhaka), and exhalation (recaka) are all equal in length. One inhales through one channel and exhales through the other, then reverses the process. This is done in order to arouse the kul)<;/alini, dormant in the miiladhara cakra, and causes it to ascend to the sahasrara cakra at the top of the head 13 The sixfold nyisa which in general is a process of empowering one's body by touching it and uttering specific mantras. By performing this one transforms one's body into a divine body. Since Tantra inherited the Upan4;adic belief that a person's body is a microcosm of the universe, then by recognizing the correct place on the body a practitioner can activate the cosmic forces latent in one's own body. This sixfold nyasa is the chief of all ny:isas. Its performance destroys lesser sins (upapataka) and harm-ful forces, neutralizes anything inimical towards the practitioner, and makes the eight siddhis attainable.14 3. MAtr.Hbl}a nyilsa is the pladng a different syllable of the alphabet at each part of the body, e.g., \"AJ1l at the mouth, Irp at the right eye ... Ksha.ql between the heart and the mouth\" .15 By the empower-ment of a specific syllable of the Sanskrit alphabet, each part of the body becomes consecrated or 'divine'. This matrka nyasa is both the touching of spedfic parts of the skin with mantras and also the visualizing of leners on each petal of the six cak.raswithin the body.16 4. ~~ nyAsa, like matrka bija nyasa, involves touching the body in certain places with the appropriate mantra. The practitioner is told about the seer who revealed the text, the meter of the text, its deity, its power and the results. In non-Tantric texts this was the criteria for establishing authority, thus it was incorporated in Tantric texts for the same reason of establishing authority of the texts.17 5. Karailga nyasa is the transmutation and sublimation of the fingers, hands, and limbs through mantras. In this section as one touches the right and left small fingers, one repeats a particular mantra. One does this progressively with one's ring fingers, middle fingers, index fingers and thumbs; then one puts one's palms together and concludes by touching together the backs of one's hands while saying the appropriate mantra. For example, the first mantra said while touching the fingers is \"Om Am Kam Kham Gam Gham N Am Khac;fgaya Hrday;iya Svah:i'' Though Sakta Pramoda gives only one letter of the alphabet with each mantra, the Nityarcana tells the practitioner that each mantra consists of seven letters, e.g., the first short_ vowel of the Sanskrit alphabet, the first four consonants, nasal, and the first long vowel (Am, Kam, Kha~, Gam, Gham, N, Am), then the second short vowel, etc., ending with the semi-vowels, sibilants, and K$3111.18"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"28 Chinnamasta 6. Pervasive ny4sa protects the whole body once the specific places of the body have been touched from head to feet and in the reverse order three times, concluding with the snapping of fingers around one's head in order to bind the directions (digbandhana). This concludes the trans-formation of the practitioner's body into a divine one and allows the practitioner to begin the meditation on the deity.19 7. Meditation of Chinnamast• (dhyana) is discussed in chapterS. 8. Making the yantra consists in the drawing of a yantra on the ground in front of the practitioner. The word yantra is derived from the Sanskrit root yam which means 'to sustain', 'to hold', or 'to support the power of a particular object or concept.' In its general sense, a yantra is an instrument or a machine, but in its Hindu Tantric sense, it is the abode of the deity.~ Woodroffe quotes in the Kaulavaliya Tantra: 'Mantra is itself the Devata (the deity) and yantra is mantra in that it is the body of the Devara who is the mantra.\"21 As with all deities, Chinnamasra has her own specific yantra. In order to begin internal or mental worship (an tar piija) of Chinnamasra, a prac-titioner needs to draw her yantra which is an abstract geometrical form. By drawing Chinnamasta's yantra, the practitioner is establishing her abode in one's presence. The yantra is composed of the outer, middle, and inner sections. The outermost section (bhiipiira) encloses everything and prevents anyone or anything from entering the inner sanctum where the deity resides. This bhiipiira is protected at its four doors by the field protectors. The middle section consists of an eight-petalled lotus which is associated with different goddesses. The inner section is composed of two inverted triangles with inscribed mantras which symbolize the resi-dence of Chinnamast.a. 22 Once the practitioner has constructed the yantra, the inner worship of Chinnamasti can begin. 9. Medltation of inner yantra refers to the visualized meditation ofChinnamasra and her abode (yantra) within the practitioner's body. This is divided into rwo meditations on Chinnamasra. The first one is for yogis who visualize Chinnamasra with form (sariipa) and the second is for he use holders, who visualize Chinnarnasta in an abstract way. In many Hindu Tantric texts, such as the Great Liberation, the yogis are the ones who meditate on the deity without form while the householders meditate on the deity with form; however Chinnamasta's form is such an awesome vision that only yogis can meditate on her with form. 23 10. Conch ritual is an important rite in Hindu Tantric ritual worship. In all forms of Hindu ritual worship there is a general oblation (sam:i-n:irghya) which is a sprinkling of consecrated liquid on the practitioners"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"To Worship a Deity 29 and offerings in order to purify them.

Pifhapiija is the ritual worship of the sacred seat of the goddess. This sacred seat is a mixture of cosmological places and philosophical concepts. The sacred seat begins with the power of support (adharaSaktl) which is surmounted successively by the Primordial Nature (Prakrti), by the bluish turtle who holds the universe (Jrurma), by the King of the l\"agas who also support the world (ananta), by the earth (p{thivl) wherein lies the ocean of milk (k$irasamudra), whereupon is the jewelled Island (ratnadvipa),24 from which rises the wish-fulfilling tree (kalpavrk$3), 25 on top of which is the golden lion scat (sval7)asirphtisana) wherein is the root of bliss (anandakanda), within this is Sambilvalaya, whereupon is the lotus of the nature of all categories of existence (sarvatattvatmakapadma), 26 wherein are the three qualities (the three gul}as-sattva, rajas, and camas). The four corners of the seat are the self (atman), inner self (antaratman), supreme self (paramatman), and wisdom self (jii3natman) and in the middle of the lotus lie Rati and Kama. 27 11a. Saktipiij§ Once the practitioner envisages Chinnamasta's seat, one meditates on Chinnamasta in one's heart and requests her to come. Invocation of the Deity in Nine Parts 1. Av§hana(invocation of the goddess) is the inviting ofChinnamasta accompanied by her two anendants, Van;inl and ~)akiru, to come and be seated on top of the prostrate Rati and Kama who are in the middle of the lotus at the very centre of her abode (yantra). She is asked to come (avahana), to establish herself (sthapana), to stay fast (sannirodhana) and (in most practices but not in this one) to stay face to face (sammukhikara~Ja) with the practitioner. 2. Pr3J)apratJ~fh§ is the instilling of the vital breath in an image of Chinnamasta or a visualized Chinnamasta. One does this by repeating the mantra, \"Am ... hamsah, let Chinnamasta's vital breath be here; Am ... hamsah, let Chinnamasta's self stay here; Am ... hamsah, let all of Chinnamasta'ssenses be here; Am ... hamsah, let Chinnamasta'sspeech, mind, eyes, ears, nose, breath, and feet be here; let the happiness remain for a long time, Svaha.\" 3. Six-limbed nyilsa is the touching of the six major bodily parts of Chinnamasta. Though the Gcxldess is formless, here she assumes a form in order to be worshipped by the practitioner. 4. Saktiworship of Goddess consists of paying homage to her six main parts which are hypostasized as individual Saktis (the heart, the top"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"30 Chinnan1ast2 ofthe head, tuft of hair, shoulders, eye, and 'weapon' goddesses). Ac-cording to Nityarcana one pays homage to the six long vowels which symbolize the six vidyas (six knowledge goddesses). 5. Sacrificial offerings (baH) is a major part of ritual worship because the purpose of this kind of puj;i is to serve (upac:ira) Chinnamasta; whatever is offered to her is termed an upacara. The offerings vary in number; the minimum is five but sixteen offerings are more common. However one can offer ten, thirty-eight, sixty-four, or up to a thousand items. 28 The Nityarcana tells the practitioner to offer sixteen items accom-panied by mantras.1!? When a practitioner offers these items, it is similar to the offerings presented to an honoured guest visiting the household. The sixteen offerings arc: (1) water to wa~h the feet (padya);\"'0 (2) water to drink t:u~hya); (j) water to wash hands and face (acamana); ( 4) light food (madhuparka)-a mixture of yogtirt, clarified butter, and honey; (5'> additional water to rinse the m< lLJth (punar acamana); (6) a bath (sndna); (7) clothes ( va.stra); (H) ornaments ( hhu.?·a(la); (9) scent (gandha); ( 10) flowers (pu~pa);31 (11) incense (dhupa); (12) light (dipa); (13) food (naivedya); (14) again water to rinse the mouth and hands (punar acamana); (15) hetdnut (tamhi.Jia); and ( 1 (>)peace offerings and saluta-tion (larpaiJa and namaskara). 6. Worship of eight-petalled lotus deities is worshipping the Goddess' most intimate attendants; no text elaborates on this step. 7. Flower offerings (pu~paiijaH) is an offering of five handfuls of flowers. Though not explicitly stated in tlw text<;, the fiowers Jre offered for attaining purity of mind. These symbolize non-deception (ama_ri). absence of egoism (anahankJra), detadnnent (araga), humility (amada), non-dl.'lusion (amuha), non-deceit (adarnhha), non-hostility (adve~o;a), imperturbability (ak~'>Dhha), non-envy (arnar ... ;arya), non-greed (aluhha), non-violence (ahii!J.o;:J), non-indulgence in the senses Undriya-nigraha), benevolence (day:i), forgiveness (k'}ama), and wisdom (jriana)Y 8. Worship of the Goddess' attendants (avar~a piija) is performed to honour all ChinnamasLi 's attendants who reside with her. induding those ouL.,ide of the enclosure, as wdl as th<>sc who reside next to Chinnamasta in the innermost sanctum. 9. Valediction to Chinnamasta ( visarjana) ccrcm< my begins with the offering of incense, light, and a libation to Chinnamasta. One begs pardon of the Goddess for all one's acL<; whether virtuous or unvirtuous and offers everything to her. Then taking the consecrated liquid from the conch shell, one sprinkles it on everything and everyone participating in the piija \\vhilc entreating the pardon of Chinnamasti for any faults or inappropriate actions. One envisages all her attendants merging into"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"To WorshipaDcity 31 Chinnamasta and then Chinnamasta disappearing from her yantra into one's heart. One mentally worships her there and bids her farewell. Fire Ceremony Burnt offerings (homa) with the repetition of Chinnamasta 's mantra is not a daily practice because it involves much time and many offerings. In most temples it is performed regularly but in an individual household it is performed only on a special occasion and usually for a particular reason. 33 I Iindu Tantric practitioners perform homa with the repetition of mantras for either mundane or supramundane reasons. The b.tter reason is to become liberated but the mundane reasons are numerous. In the Narada Pural)a (llU0.21f0, the practitioner is told that he/she can attain good fortune, happiness, longevity, be able to make all kings subservient, be free from diseases, attain poetic talents, captivate people, cause death to one's enemies, attain siddhis, etc. '4 Each attainment re-quires particular offerings and a certain amount of time. The N:irada Pural)a (22-23) states: Through malaU flowers he allain~ nucncy of speech, through l.:ampak3 flowers, happiness If one perfPrrns a hundred homas everyday Wllh the flesh of a goal smeared wiLh ghcc, and continues il for a month, all kings will be subservient 10 him.3~ Other mundane attainments arc included in the 'six ~cts' (~acjkarman). These are: the ability to pacify, to remove diseases, or to prevent people from having to undergo terrible consequences (.sanll), to bewitch beings ( vasTkaral)a or mohana), to render a cause or power ineffective (stambhana), to create dissension or separation ( vidvc.:>al)a), to compel one's enemic.:s to flee (uccar.-ma), and to kill (mara1)a). Each auainment requires specific offerings, tim<.', and the repetition of mantras in a spc.:cific order. · ln the simplest terms, in front of a fire altar a practitioner presents to Chinnamasta specific offerings with appropriate mantras. S~kta Pramuda states that one can offer the five m' s, or honey. sweet milk, etc. The five m' sare five offerings which begin with m -wine (madya), meat (m<iql.,a), fish (matsya), a consort or parched grain (mudra), and sexual union (maithuna). From among the three different kinds ofTantric practitioners, these laner offerings are only recommended for heroic types ( vira). Baser types who are 'animal-like' (pasu) arc forbidden these offerings since they cannot offer them with a pure mind. lndeed it is very difficult even for the heroic types to offer them with a pure mind, but it is a training in control-"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"32 Chinnamasta ling the senses and sublimating the power acquired through this restraint. The third type, who are 'divine-like' (divya), are neither encouraged nor dissuaded because they do not require external objects to arouse spiritual sentiments. The five offerings can be interpreted literally or they can be understood symbolically, e.g. yogic symbolism. Since Chi~i1amasta is a great yogin!, let us look the yogic symbolism as explained in the Agamasara of the five m 's. We find the symbolic equivalents of the offerings explained as follows: 1. Madya or wine symbolizes introspection and th~ arousal of the kur:u;lalinito unite with Param Siva who is at the Sahasr:ira cakra where the (nectar) am(ta is located. 2. Mjqlsa or meat refers to ma the tongue from which words arise. One who feeds on them is a worshipper of m<iqlsa. This person is a yogin who has control over his or her speech or has the power to withdraw from the phenomenal world (pratyahara). 3. Matsya represents two fish (pr:itJa and apana) who move in the Ganges (i<;Ja na<;ll) and Yamuna (pirigala nacjl) and the person who controls them is practising pra!Jay:ima. 4. Mudra is the soul which resides in the thousand-petalled lotus in the head. One who acquires knowledge of this soul is a worshipper of mudr:i and practises dhyana 5. Maithuna represents cohabitation which is the root of creation, preservation, and destruction. Its yogic sense is the attainment of samadhi.36 STOTRA (PRAISES) The section of praises (stotra) to Chinnamast.a is not an obligatory quo-tidian practice as the ritual worship (puja) is; however, the practitioner is encouraged to recite these praises daily upon completion of the ritual worship. In the stotra the practitioner eulogizes Chinnamast.a 's greatness. It is a combination of lauds and descriptions of Chinnamasta and her anendants, YarQ.inl and l)akini, but it is not a formal meditation session per se. It is foremost a eulogy to Chinnamasta, which is evident by the bracketing of praises to Chinnamasta in the first and last paragraphs. The practitioner is in a good company because the supreme gods, Brahma, Siva, and Vi~QU, as well as yogis pay homage to Chinnamast.a in the text. A practitioner professes faith, while affirming loyalty and veneration to her. Moreover, one becomes intimately involved with Chinnamasta by knowing both her form and formless aspects. The stotra states, \"My obeisance to Mahamaya, 0 Mother, the graceful one, and bestowcr of knowledge.\" It is the belief of the practitioner that by extolling Chinnamasta, all efforts and dedication will result in receiving the desired"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"To Worship a Deity 33 goals--wealth, grain, great knowledge, and the eight siddhis. KAvACA Kavaca literally means armour or a coat of mail. In the nyasa of the ritual section it refers to crossing one's arms and touching the shoulders (which is also a type of protection). In this section, the practitioner protects the entire body by the recitation of specific mantras at designated places of the body, beginning with the head and ending with the feet, and wearing amulets empowered with mantras. This practice, unlike the naysa prac-tice which transforms one's body into a divine body, protects the prac-titioner by requesting deities to guard certain parts of the body. These deities are summoned by the appropriate mantr.lsand requested tore-main at these parts ofthe body in order to neutralize negative influences, to propitiate planets, to ward off untimely death, and to provide general protection against all adverse circumstances. By having these deities as protectors, one can neutralize potentially negative forces and has at one's command the great deities, such as Lak~mi and Saraswati. The name of this kavaca-\"victorious over the three worlds\"-indicates its potency. The three worlds are: (1) the earth, (2) intermediate space, and (3) the sky. Thus they encompass the entire Hindu conception of the universe. ~AYA (ESSENCE) This section is the 'essence' (hrdaya) of the entire practice. It contains parts of all the important practices, such as nyasa, visualized meditation of Chinnamasta, praises to Chinnamasta, invocation of her as one's protectoress, recitation of her twelve names, and the results .obtained by performing this hrdaya practice. ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHT NAMF.S; ONE THOUSAND NAMES These two sections consist in the recitation of Chinnamasta 's names. The reasons for and benefits of reciting the names as well as their significances is discussed in chapter 3.

In the Bhakti Cult in Ancient India B. K. Goswami states, \"The worship, the concentration on and recitation of the mantra, and the repetition of the holy names, constitute the main part of the religious life of a Satwata worshipper. \"2 Most praises with the recitation of names consist of one hundred and eight, three hundred, a thousand, or a thousand and eight names. These names may be recited aloud, repeated inaudibly, mentally repeated, or sung in groups (namakirtana). The recitation of the praise of names became popular because it was deemed a facile yet efficacious way of propitiating a deity who will help or protect a devotee especially in these troubled times. In the VJ¥.1upur:ii)a (6.2.27) it says: \"That which one obtains in the Krtyayuga by meditation, by performing sacrifice in the Treta, by worship in the Ova para, one receives in the Kaliyuga, by reciting (the names) ofKe5ava. \"3 According to Indian cosmology we are in the age of decline, the Kaliyuga, wherein a person's life-span is limited to a hundred years or so. Therefore many spiritual practices which require a long-term commit-ment and perhaps costly rituals are no longer suited to this age of decline. The recitation of the namastotra is a simple ritual which can be performed by anyone who wants to be closer to the deity. Ideally, as one chants the names of the deity, one contemplates the deity and identifies with all the aspects of the deity. This is a personal and intimate ritual which requires no ritual person, costly rituals, or time commitment. In our 'time-con-scious' society, ~t is an excellent and expedient ritual. This type of reasoning was also propounded by the various Buddhist Pure Land sects in East Asia. Since one needed an expedient yet effective method in order"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"52 to achieve happiness, spiritual attainments, and eventually liberation from cyclic existence, one method offered in Hinduism was the recitation of n:imastotra. In the Chinnamast:isahasran:ima a practitioner is assured happiness, knowledge, and the attainment of great siddhisthrough recit-ing Chinnamasta's names. The efficacy of the recitation of a deity's name in a ritual context has its historical antecedent in the Vedas. Rcnou in his \"Etudes sur le Vocabulaire du ~gveda\" states that \"the name above all is that one of a deity\" and that the beginning of language occurred when the ancient seers (r~is) gave names to all objects (X.71.1).4 The first chapter in the J.?gveda (1.1.1-fO mentions Agni's name eight times in the first nine stanzas. In the Satapatha Br:ihma.tJa 6.1.3.9, receiving a name frees one from evil, and in 11.2.3.4-6, \" ... he who knows these two great forces (name and form) of the Brahman becomes himself a great force ... \". Furthermore, the Bhagavadgit:i, instead of repeating Kr~t:la' s or Arjuna 's name, is replete with epithets for them, thereby emphasizing their diverse and accom-plished abilities. In the ninth chapter stressing devotion, Kf~J)a is described as many things, including the father of this world, the mother, the estab--lisher (9.17), and one must worship Kp~Qa as encompassing all these variegated forms. The power of evoking a deity's name and his/her various epithets is emphasized in India's cady sacred texts: one of the first specific one thousand names is that ofVi~J)U in dialogue between Bl1i~ma and Yudhi~thira in the Mah:ibh:irata, chapter 149 of the 'Anusasanika Parvan'. From this prototype, the popularity of praising the names grew, as it is evident from the numerous praises found in the Pur:iiJas and Tantras. Some of the more famous ones are the Lalicasahasranama in the Brahm:iiJ<;/a Pur:iiJa,5 the Sri G:iyatri Sahasranama in the Sriinad Dcvl Bh:igavatam,6 the 'Kadistotra' in the Mah:inirv:i.r}atant.ra,7 the Sivasahasra-namastot.ra in the Vayupur:i!Ja 1.30.79ff and in the Brahmapur.i!J4 38, 40ff. The evocation of a name is efficacious only because the name itself is powerful. Well-attested in archaic societies, it was believed that a name of the person or an object ~as directly related to the essence of the person or object. Renou states that in many respects the name is considered the essential property of a person.8 This is one of the reasons why the Vedas are highly revered and consequently the power of words has always played an important role in Indian thought. The power of words is cer-tainly evident in Tantric practice by the frequent use of mantras as a potent protection or gaining access to a deity. In the praise of names (namastot.ra), the names are either in the nominative or the dative. Frequently they are considered as mantras when they are in the dative because the name is preceded by Aum and followed by Nama/:1."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"The Divine PlayofChinnamasta 53 In Gonda's monograph, Notes on Names and the Name of God in Ancient India, he enumerates several ways that knowledge of a name makes one powerful. The name helps one understand facts and events. He cites the Atharvavcda (II ,8,7): \"As long as the former earth remains nameless it cannot be identified so as to become an object of knowl-edge.\"9 All empirical knowledge is based on knowing words and their meaning because without this, one could nevf.!r relate to what wa_c;; learned nor could one ever convey this knowledge to another person. In regard to soteriological knowledge according to the Tantric method, when the guru initiates a disciple by conferring a mantra (mancradTk~a)10 and im-paning its meaning to the disciple, it is emphasized that this method is only possible because of the long tradition of transmitted knowledge from guru to disciple. For example, a major Sakti seed syllable mantra is Kli1J1. The Mantnirthabhidhanam of the Varadata.ntra explic.ates kli1]1 as follows: ka stands for Kamadeva or Kr~Qa, Ia for lndra, i for Tu~ti and 1J1 for sukha.11 Thus, one seed syllable symbolizes four important deities with whom one may mentally associate with oneself. Another explanation presented in the Sivasiitra divides the syllable into five parts which are related to the creation of the world since the kli1]1 syllable is the seed syllable ofthe god of desire, Kamadeva. The Sivasiitra states: \"from the letter ka water arises, from the letter Ia the world is born, from i fire comes, from the nada the wind and from the hindu comes the sky. \"12 By knowing the various meanings of a mantra, one begins to acquire power because of mental identification with the referents. If we consider the recitation of praise of names as mantras, by perform-ing the repetition of a mantra, one strengthens one's association with a deity or deities and gradually becomes more intimate with them. 13 These deities are believed to aid a practitioner; by reciting their name or names, they become a source of help, strength, and encouragement. Already in the Atharvavedawe find the belief that uttering a deity's name will bring the deity's protection. Atharvaveda (6,76,4) states, \"They who are aiming at him, do not kill the k~atriya who, knowing, pronounces the name of Agni in order to (secure) length of life.\" Moreover the recitation of the name has a consecratory power and imparts a blessing conferred by the deity. In later devotional literature Dimock, describing the Sahajiyas' relationship with Kf~I)a, quotes from the Anandabhairava \"having said and understood Hari ... the uttering of the name in the mouth brings the experience of him within. \"14 Tulasidasa, the great bhakti poet, states that \" ... the name acts as an interpreter between the material and the imma-terial forces of the deity, and is a guide and interpreter to both.\"1~ In other words, the name is a linking reference point between the deity in her/his"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"54 Chinnamast.a sagu.(Ja (form aspect) and nirgu.(Ja (formless aspect). But note that the one thousand names of a deity are not all common names nor are they an exhaustive listing. S.K. De states: The deity is often called Nameless or Anaman in the scriptures, but this usage is on par with the employment of terms such as 'birthlcss' (ajanman), 'formless' (arilpa) or 'a(.tionless' (akart[). It does not mean that he has no name but that his name ... is not like the common names we have in the phenomenal world; it possesses a spiritual significance and efficacy.16 The names given in the praises are the important ones but a deity cannot be fully described by any number of names, for a deity is nameless and limitless. Thus, by reciting the names of a deity one can: (1) become more familiar with the deity; (2) be protected by the deity, (3) receive blessings and experience the deity in her/his sagu.(Ja form; and (4) be directed to the transcendent deity without form. Ramprasad Sen, a Bengali devotional poet, has a poem which exemplifies many of the reasons to recite the names of deities. Kali's name is the wishing-g•ving tree. My heart is seeded with it. I've peddled my bones in the marketplace Of this world and brought up Durga 's name ... Tani's name is the best remedy. I've tied it to my topknot Ramprasad says: I have begun my journey calling on the name of Durga.17 In the Bhakti Cult of Ancient India, B. K. Goswami states, \"To chant therefore the holy names with the help of the sacred rosary of beads is bener in one sense than every other formal act of religious life. It may be then viewed as the essence of worship and the culmination of worship. \"18 In many of the praises of names, such as the Lalitasahasranama and the Vi~.(Ju.sahasran:ima, it is said in the phala.Sroti (results) section that a reciter of the thousand names will be free from evil, all accumulated sins will be destroyed, one will achieve prosperity, eloquence, and whatever one desires.19 Furthermore, the Lalit.asahasran:ima states that if one 'mesmer-izes' ashes with the thousand names and applies these ashes over a sick person, the person will be healed. Or if water 'mesmerized' with the thousand names is poured over a possessed person, the graha (the pos-"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"The Divine Play of Chinnamasca 55 sessor) will flee at once.Z> Most importantly, in both the Lalitasahasraniima and V~usahasranama, the reciter of the praises will be free of all suffering and achieve liberation. 21 In the 'Chinnamastatantra' of the Sakta Pramoda, in the introduction of the thousand names, Mahadeva (Siva) tells Devi (his wife), \"even without worship (puja), without meditation, without repeti-tion, ... only by reciting (the thousand names), one will obtain siddhis.\" In the phalasroti (results) section, it stresses the attainment of siddhis, as well as the elimination of all sins, control over others, strength, beauty, wealth, respect from others, etc. The attainment of mok~, however, is only indirectly mentioned in connection with the attainment of knowledge. In the Vi$1Jusahasraniima, it comments that \"one should not think that by merely reciting (this hymn) salvation is insured; because it is by knowledge alone that one attains mok~.\"22 Consistent with the Tantric viewpoint that the individual's power and understanding are needed to attain liberation, one cannot rely solely on the grace of the deity. Therefore the recitation of the praise of names is an expedient and efficacious means in reaching the threshold of liberation, i.e., having the knowledge of Brahman (Brahmajiiana). CussrnCAnoN oF 11IE THousAND NAMES Indians are fond of the practice of systematization and classification of names, terms, concepts, etc., and the namastotra genre was not exempt from classification. In the aforementioned Kadistotra, the hundred names all begin with ka, the first consonant in Sanskrit. In the Chinnamastasahasranama a loose alphabetical order, occasionally inter-spersed with names beginning with other letters, begins with name #95 Karali and continues to the name #807 Huilkarabijarupam. 23 The Lalicasahasraniima does not have names in alphabetical order but accord-ing to Bhaskararaya's commentary, an order according to subject-matter does prevail. The first hundred and twelve names comprise an exemplary group. The first five names reveal her real (praka5a) form;24 names 6 to 52 enumerate her manifested ( vimar5a) form from her head to feet; 25 names 53 to 63 describe the seat of the Devi;26 names 64-85 exalt her actions which have both an explicit meaning and implicit meaning;27 and names 86-112 describe her subtle forms. 28 Thus in the Lalicasahasranama the classification is primarily according to subject-matter. In the article \"Sriradhikanamasahasram\" Chemburkar classifies Radha's names also according to subjects, namely, the twofold main classification of Radha as Gopi and of Radha as a female deity worshipped by the Vai~r:tavas.29 This is subdivided into different classifications, e.g., Radha as a Gopi who is beloved ofKr~IJ.a, or Radha as a Gopi associated with the Rasa-dance;"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"56 Chinnamast3 and the deity Radha as Sakti or the deity Radha identical with the deity of the Saktas.30 Hence there are numerous ways to classify the praise of a thousand names. 3l Another approach in systematizing the thousand names of a goddess is to view these epithel'i which are descriptions of her form according to iconography, mythological allusions, exaltation of her prowess, talents, extraordinary protection, etc., as a great lila (divine play) of the goddess, i.e., the Goddess' manifesting herself in a myriad forms in order to instruct, help or protect her devotees. As Ramprasad says: 0 Mother, who really knows Your magic? You're a crazy girl driving us all crazy with these tricks. No one knows anyone else in a world of your illusions .... If she decides to be kind, this misery will pass.~2 Chinnamasta is a wonderful example of a goddess who understands the illusions (maya) of the phenomenal world and can assume various forms, such as a warrior, magician, beauty, protectoress, etc. Chinnamasta is limitless as are the manifestations of the phenomenal world; this is simply a marvellous performance-lila. By thinking of the thousand names of Chinnamasta as divine play, one can classify her thousand names accord-ing to the nine rasa (sentiments) of the Indian aesthetical theory.33 The nine r.lSaSare the: (1) erotic, (2) comic, (3) pathetic, (4) furious, (5) heroic, (6) terrible, (7) odious, (8) marvellous, and (9) peaceful. In the preface to the Theory of Rasa in Sanskrit Drama, Gopinath Kaviraj states: The Siva Siitras appear to suggest that the ancient Indian conception of Drama consists in the realization that Atma (self) endowed with its inher-ent Power and playing all possible parts is the Nata (actor), the senses are the spectators (Prek$3-kani) and the Anatar:itma (innermost self) is the Pre~agrha or stage. The object of Abhinaya (dramatic representation) is evidently taken to be the manifestation of Rasa. 34 Gopinath Kavinij is referring to the aesthetical theory propounded in Kashmir Saivism, initially presented by Abhinavagupta. Abhinavagupta was a major proponent of a profound philosophical way of linking religion and drama. Influenced by the Tantric ritual of Kashmir Saivism, he deve-loped an aesthetic theory which incorporated the spiritual aspects of drama, and all later aesthetic theorists followed his lead. 35 Abhinavagupta was interested in how the actor, the spectator and the sentiment evoked in the play interacted. If one applies this theory to the thousand names, the goddess depicts the actres..,;;, the practitioner is the spectator, and the"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"The Divine Play of Chinnamasta 57 feeling of transcendence or holiness is the sentiment ~voked. Abhinavagupta considered the actor to represent the paramatmanwho is never affected by the rasa portrayed, but evokes the rasa in the spectator, who represents the senses according to Kaviraj's interpretation.36 Atman always remains unaffected but the senses do react to emotion. The God-dess represents the atman who can assume a myriad of forms and evoke emotions in her practitioners while she essentially remains unaffet.ted. ln contrast, her practitioners become very involved in her various forms and do react to them. However, Abhinavagupta states that a spectator be-comes mentally attuned to the drama and the actor's depiction of a particular ra..5a, and by contemplating it, becomes absorbed by it and identifies with the actor. Furthermore, in the Dhvanyalokalocana he com-ments that some people are capable of identifying with the subject -matter because the mirror of their heart has been polished through constant recitation. If one applies this to the recitation of the thousand names of Chinnamasta, a sensitive reader can be affected by the repetitions of the names by sympathetically responding to her myriad manifestations, her paradoxes, her exploits, her limitless energy to protect, to help, to be kind, etc. One can become overwhelmed, forget oneself and experience the bliss ofChinnamasta. By reciting Chinnamasta's names one can experi-ence the bliss of Chinnamasta and unconsciously identifies with Chinnamasta or experiences her essence. To the reciter of her names Chinnamasta is the sacrificer and the sacrifice which feeds her essence, reminiscent of feeding her two attendants. 37 Though this poem is not addressed to Chinnamasta, it evokes the same sentiment: She's playing in my heart. Wharevcr I rhink, I rhink ~ Ier name. I close my eyes and She's in rhcre Garlanded wirh human hcads.38 For anyone who recites the 1 OR or 1000 names, certain emotions will be evoked. Though the nine rasasmight all be present in the 108 or 1000 names; certainly some rnsaswill be dominant. Since Chinnamasta is such a paradoxical deity, I assume that her 108 or 1000 names will also entail an inherent paradox. Though classifying the deity's names according to rasasis not an Indian tradition, it is a provocative means to assess whether one rasa does dominate in the 108 or 1000 names of Chinnamasta. 39 These nine rnsas, (1) the erotic Csrrig:irn), (2) comic (hasya), (3) pa-thetic (karuiJa), ( 4) furious (raudrn), (5) heroic ( vira), (6) terrible (bhay:inaka), (7) odious (bibhatsa), (8) marvellous (adbhuta), and (9)"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"58 Chinnarnasta peaceful (santa), are the basis of classifying the 108 and 1000 names of Chinnamasta from the Sakta Pramoda. 40 One Hundred and Eight Names The following is a translation of Chinnamasta 's one hundred and eight names.

The ultimate goal of Buddhahood is the same for all Mahayana practitioners. According to Paramitayana one accomplishes the goal of Buddhahood by perfecting the six perfections-generosity, ethical conduct, patience, effort, medita-tion, and transcendental insight with the realization of voidness as the necessary underlying basis. This process takes at least three incalculable aeons. In sharp contrast, in Vajrayana which utilizes the realization of voidness and deity yoga (Skt. Deva Yoga; Tib.lha'i mal 'byor), one can achieve the final goal of Buddhahood in seven lifetimes or even within one lifetime. In accordance with the Mahayana ideal, one seeks Buddhahood to benefit all sentient beings. The Vajrayanists believe that the quickest way to Buddhahood is the best because one can help more beings. The ultimate or supramundane goal ofTantric practitioners is Buddhahood but this is fadlitated by the acquisition of mundane goals, such as the eight great siddhis, the six supranormal powers, and the four means of action. In consequent to the Mahayana vows to help all sentient beings in achiev-ing Buddhahood, these mundane goals should not be ends in themselves but expedient means of overcoming obstacles to the ultimate goal such as poor health, ignorance, or other worldly hindrances. The eight great siddhis are as follows: (1) Khacjga is the power to be invincible with a sword empowered with specific mantras, (2) Aiijana is an eye salve which removes ignorance; 1 (3) Padalepa is to be 'swift-footed' or an ointment applied to make one a 'spee~-walker';2 ( 4) Antardhana is the ability to become invisible; (5) Rasa-Rasayana is the alchemical ability to transform base metals into gold or having the elixir of immortality;"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"64 Chinnamasta (6) Khecara is the ability to fly through the air; (7) Bhucara is the power to go anywhere in an instant; (8) Para/a is the power to go to the nether worlds. 3 One may also acquire the six suprasensory perceptions ($ac;labhijnana) which are clairvoyance (divyacak~urvijnana), clairaudience (divya.Srotram), knowing other's thoughts (cetal)paryyaya), understanding of illusions and miracles (rddhividdhJ), remembering one's previous lives (purvanivasanusmrtl), and knowledge of how to eradicate the 'fluxes' (asravak~aya). Another attainment is the four means of actions (catu}J.karma) which are pacifying (santl), increasing (pau~[ika), domi-nating ( vasikarai)a), and destroying (maraJJa).4 All these extraordinary abilities should be applied to achieve Buddhahood and to help others achieve Buddhahood; these abilities should not be used for self-glorifica-tion. This is one of the reasons why Tantra is known as the quickest but most dangerous path. The temptation to use these abilities for fame, domination, and so forth, can be overwhelming and eventually destruc-tive to the practitioner. BuoomsT TANTRA CussrnCAnoN5 In Tantric Buddhism the four principal kinds ofT antra are kriya (action), cary;i (performance), yoga (union), and anuttarayoga (supreme union).6 Tsang kha pa states, \"because the main trainees in the Vajra Vehicle are of four very different types, four dO()rs of entry are poisted. \"7 Each of these four kinds ofTantra uses desire, the chief emotion in the realm of desire.8 Practitioners of the four Tantras have the same intention in that they all are seeking others' welfare .... All four have deity yoga .... All use desire for the attributes of the desire realm on the path.9 These fourTantras are explained sometimes as four aspects of a relation-ship between a woman and a man: exchange of looks (kriya), exchange of smiles and laughs (carya), holding hands or embracing (yoga) and sexual union (anuttarayoga). 10 Also they are explained as reflecting the different mental capacities and religious propensities of practitioners. All four classes ofT antra emphasize deity yoga but they vary in their method. Kriya or action ta.ntra stresses external purification and ritual action. The majority of kriy;i practitioners imagine the deity in front of themselves and makes offerings,.redtes prayers, and mantras to the deity. In action tantra one thinks of oneself as the servant of the deity. Carya or performance Tantra stresses the need for a balance between external performance (as in Kriya Tantra) and internal yoga. A practitioner visualizes the deity in"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"The Question is not-To be or not to be 65 front of oneself or imagines oneself as the deity. There is a more equal relationship between the deity and practitioner; the practitioner considers the deity as a friend or a close relative. Yoga or union Tantra emphasizes the practice of internal yoga by transforming one's ordinary body, speech, mind, and actions into extraordinary or divine body, speech, mind, and actions. The procedure involves the generation of oneself as the deity in the form of the pledge being (samayasattva) and then invokes the wis-dom being (jn:inasattva) to merge with the pledge being. Then one applies the four seals: the pledge seal (samayamudra), dharmamudr:i, action seal (ka.nna.mudra), and great seal (mahamudra). The application of these seals transforms one's ordinary mind, speech, body, and actions into divine ones. In Yoga Tantra one visualizes oneself as a deity during meditation sessions but not on a continual basis as in Anuttarayoga Tantra. Anuttarayoga Tantra, which is only for the most intelligent and dedicated practitioners, emphasizes a complex internal yogic practice. One visualizes oneself as a deity and employs internal yogic practice which culminates in sexual union with either a visualized or actual vidya (a knowledge consort). The practitioner visualizes him/herself as a deity at all times and places. This is the supreme path, unequalled by any other.11 Anuttarayoga Tantra is subdivided in various ways; one of the most common is into Father, Mother, and Non-Dual Tantras12 which empha-size method (upaya), insight (prajna) or equal balance. respectively. All Anuttarayoga Tantras teach about the inseparability of method (upaya) and insight (prajna). The FatherTantras, which include, Guhyasamajatantra and Yam:intaka, teach the non-duality of bliss and void but emphasizes the method; the Mother Tantras, which include, Cakrasaqivaratantra (or Sarpvaratantra) and Vajrayogini, stress the transcendental insight (prajiia) brought about by the experience of non-duality of bliss and void, rather than the method. A Non-Dual Tantra combines insight and method equally. The ChinnamUl)Qa sadhanas are classified as Anunarayoga Mother Tantra since their root is in the Cakrasa.rpvaratantra and they emphasize prajiia, rather than upaya.13 NOTES ON SAI>HANA TRANSLATION Numerous sadhanas of Chinnamul)Qa are extant in Tibetan, Newari, and Sanskrit. No one sadhana seems to be more famous or popular than another, but three s:idhanas are remarkably similar. These three are (1) ChinnamuiJ.<;l:i Vajravarahfby Srimatidevi in the Tibetan Tangyur, 14 2) Lak?fllis:idhana from a collection of Nepalese Buddhist sadhanas, and (3) Fajrayogini Sadhana in the Sadhanamala.15"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"66 Chinna.mi:lsti The introduction and translation here is based on the Chinnamu.Q<;la Vajravarahi Sadhana, the most elaborate of the three. This sadhana, as with most Buddhist practice of ChinnamuQ.<;ia, consists primarily of the ritual worship section (puja). A second sadhana is a praise (stutJ) to Trikayavajrayogini (i.e., ChinnamuQ.<;la and her attendants) written by a disciple of La~minkara, the Siddhacarya Sri Viriipa (not the Mahasiddha Viriipa of the eighth century) from the Nepalese Buddhist collection. Unlike the Hindu sadhanasof Chinnamasta, I have not found any kavacas ('armour' section). The essence of the practice section (hrdaya) is con-tained in abbreviated sadhanas which are available. Though there are hundred and eight names, or thousand names of deities in Buddhism, none have been found for ChinnamuQ.<;la. Hi CHINN~A VAJRAVARAm SADHANA BY SRiMATIDEVi The colophon of the Chinnamur:J<;lavajravar:ihi sadhana states that this sadhana is by Srimatidevi, translated by the Newari PaQ.<;iitacarya Bharendraruce and the (Tibetan) Blo-ldan Shes-rab (1 059-11 09). It does not elaborate who Srimatidevi is. In the Nepalese manuscript entitled Lak_5misadhana, which is almost identical with the ChinnamUIJ.gavajrav:ir.ihi sadhana, there is no colophon. Usually, however, a sadhana's name indicates the deity or the author of the sadhana. Lak$mi is a well known deity who is also known as Sri.17 Since this sadhana is not about the deity Lak$mi, one deduces that Lak$mi must be the author. Furthermore, Lak$minkara is known as Bhagavati Lak$mi. Srimatidevi must be an epithet for Lak$mi or Lak$mili.kara. There are several well known Lak~minkar~s, including the sister of King Indrabhuti and the eleventh-century Kashmiri nun. The lineages of the sadhanas of ChinnamuQ.<;la indicate that they must have been practised in the ninth century; therefore indicating Lak$mir1kara of the ninth century as the author. Evidence is that, according to one lineage of a ChinnamuQ.Qa sadhana, one o( Lak$mir1kara's disciple was Virupa. There is a very famous Virupa who is the patriarch of the Tibetan Buddhist Sakya lineage but he lived during the eighth century. This VirOpa lived in the ninth century.18 Thus Srlmatidevi and the ninth-century Lak$mir1kara are shown to be the same woman-one of the eighty-four Mahasiddhas.19 The following is the mode of practice according to this sadhana: The preliminarles (1) Homage to the deity, (steps 2 to 5 are not explicit in the text)"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"The Question is not-To be or not to be (2) Homage to one's guru; (3) Refuge in the Three Jewels; ( 4) Generation of bodhicitta; (5) Four immeasurables; (6) Vajrasattva meditation; (7) Consecration of one's body; (8) Visualized meditation on the deity; (9) Drawing of the maiJ.c;lala.

PrelJminaries 67 As in the Hindu Tantras, the preliminaries are not elaborated since it is assumed that a Tantric practitioner is well acquainted with them. 20 (1) Homage to the deity begins all Tantric Buddhist sadhanas. One prostrates oneself, usually three times, as one offers homage to ChinnamUQQa. (2) Homage to the guru or one's spiritual teacher is of tantamount importance in Vajrayana Buddhism because one's guru is indispensable in guiding one on the path to enlightenment. A Tantric disciple is trying to overcome mental obscurations and gain insight. Only an experienced teacher will know which kind of teaching or method is necessary to eradicate these mental defilements and accomplish these realizations. 21 Secondly, in Vajrayana a disciple needs to receive initiations from a quali-fied teacher and blessing from the teacher in order that the practice be successful. 22 (3) Refuge in the Three Jewels is obligatory for all Buddhists; in fact, the definition of a Buddhist is one who has taken refuge in the Three Jewels. The Three Jewels are the Buddha, the Dharma (his teachings), and the Sangha, the noble community. The teacher comprises all Three Jewels since she/he is the living embodiment of all three, through whose efforts the disciple receives the Buddhist teachings. 23 The Beautiful Ornament of the Three Visions describes the Three Jewels in this way: The place of refuge is the Master and his lineage of Preceptors who have revealed to one the transcendentally exalted path 0 0 0 0 The Buddha is one"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"68 Chinnamasti who has accomplished the Body of Reality (Dharmakaya) .... which is endowed with every kind of virtue and free from every kind of imperfection .... attained the Form Body (Riipakaya) ... which acts solely for the welfare of beings .... The Dharma is the preceplS .... 111e Sangha comprises the noble ones who dwell on the stages of irreversibility and those ordinary beings who have entered the doctrine prior to oneself.24 ( 4) Generation of the Bodhidtta is the practice at the heart of Mahayana Buddhism. Mahayana Buddhism developed the bodhidtta practice which in turn created the ideal of the Bodhisattva-beings who help all sentient beings to become liberated from cyclic existence and eventually to attain Buddhahood. Based on loving kindness and compassion the btxlhicitt:l attitude is the wish to attain enlightenment in order to help all beings become free from suffering. After one has nurtured this wish, one is ready to enter and train on the path of developing this enlightenment thought. As it is stated in the Bodhicaryavatara: just as a distinction is perceived between one who wishes to travel and one who actually travels, so the wise should recognize a graded distinc-tion between these two (the wishing and entering enlightenment thoughts). 25 The path consists of (1) meditating on the equality between self and others, (2) meditating on exchanging self for others, and (3) training in the conduct of these two. 26 Successfully completing the path, one con-centrates on the actual bodhicitta with the understanding of the lack of any intrinsic nature. Without understanding this voidness of intrinsic nature, a being could never become a Bodhisattva who works selflessly for all beings. Thus the actualization of bodhicitta is a prerequisite in attaining Buddhahood for the sake of helping all sentient beings. (5) The Four Immeasurables are compassion, love, joy, and equani-mity. The cultivation of the four immeasurables aids one in developing bodhicitta. They are considered 'immeasurables' because \"The field with respect to which one is meditating is the infinite field of all sentient beings throughout all space. \"17 With refuge one cultivates virtue in relation to a 'purP. field' of beings; with the four immeasurables one does so in relation to the 'field' of ordinary beings. (6) Vajrasattva meditation is a practice of purification of one's body, speech, and mind. The practice consists of cleansing one's sins, obscurations, faults, failings, and impurities through regret for wrong doings and a pledge not to repeat these aided by the power of the pure being, Vajrasattva, and the meditation ritual.

The Opening of the Lotus states that: \"If you desire a good crop, you must first sow the seeds properly. Likewise, without the seed of proper purification, the crop of enlighten-ment will not grow. \"28 (7) Consecration of one's body is performed by reciting om as one touches the top of the head or forehead, a.]J. as one touches the throat, and hiirp as one touches the heart. By the recitation of 'oqt a.]J., hiirp' and touching the appropriate place, one purifies one's body, speech, and mind, transforming them into adamantine body, speech, and mind, re-spectively. (8) Meditation on the deity will be discussed fully in the section of the actual meditation. (9) Drawing the mal)qala is equivalent to the Hindu drawing of the y:mtra. The Buddhists refer to a deity's abode as a mal)qala, rather than a y:mtra.29 Though ma.IJ.Qa/a has many meanings in this practice here, it is referring to the residence of Chinnamui).Qi. Padmavajra in his Tantr:irth:ivataravy;ikhy:ina <96b-3ft) states that MaiJ.qala means an en-closing of essence because of having the 'essence' (ma.IJ.<;/a) in the sense of 'enclosing' (-Ia) it.\"30 Thus Chinnamul).<;ia's maiJ.qa/a is enclosing the 'essence' of ChinnamUI).Qa within a particular confine in order to perform the ritual. Actual Meditation of the Deity (1) Visualization of the deity is discussed in chapter 5. (2) Offerings to the deity and attendants: In Buddhist Tantra the basic number of offerings is seven-the offering of saffron water, flowers, in-cense, lamps, scent, food, and music. 31 These can be actual liquid, flowers, etc. or they can be imagined. Furthermore, these offerings arc explained differently by various Tibetan scholars, such as Sakya Chogyal Phagpa, Buddhaguhya, and the third Karmapa, Rangjung Dorje.32 Offering Phagpa Buddhaguhya KaiTT13pa. water ocean of hearing defilement cleansing flowers good qualities samadhi pleasing senses incense moral conduct morality morality lamp insight insight insight scent faith bodhicitta bodhicitta food contemplative trance nectar (amrta) music songs of praise liberation melody Phagpa does not explain his associations but the third Karmapa, Rangjung Dorje does.

All agree that incense refers to morality because in Tibetan Buddhism, as well as other religions, a sign of a moral person is that she/he exudes a wonderful fragrance. 33 The lamp is asso-ciated with insight (prajiia) because wisdom is the light which dispels the darkness of ignorance. This scent can be interpreted as incense which seems to be Phagpa 's interpretation, but it can also be understood as kindness or bodhicitta. Karmapa stated, \"Pure water with perfume and herbal ingredients is the bathing water of the victorious ones ... May kindness, raining continually from the cloudbanks of wisdom, purify the multitude of foul odours. \"34 Water is usually understood as purification and Karmapa elaborates that it represents purification of the defilements (kle5as) of body, speech, and mind. 35 Wayman interprets Buddhaguhya 's association of flowers with samadhi as referring to the incident where the Buddha teaches by holding a flower and is only understood by Mahakasypa.36 Phagpa ex-plains food as contemplative trance (samadhl); a great yogi needs samadhi, not ordinary food. 37 Also food keeps the body healthy and in Tantra one needs a healthy body to achieve liberation. 38 By using the Tantric method, one experiences bliss or nectar of deathlessness (amrta). Finally, music includes songs of praise to Bodhisattvas and Buddhas as well as songs of insight, such as the Tibetan yogi Milarepa 's songs or the Mahasiddhas. 39 (3) Praises to the pi{hasand the kayasofthc Ruddha: In Buddhism, as in I Iinduism, the goddess has special seats which are both external, geographically located in Asia and internal, located within each person's body. One of the earliest mentions of these pit has is in the Hevajra Tantra which enumerates OQ<;tiyana, PUnp.giri, Kamarupa, andjalandhara.40 The probable geographical locations for these are O<;i<;iiyana in Swat Valley in present North Pakistan, PtHl)agiri in the Bijapur region in Karnataka in south India,41 ja!andhara in the Kangra Valley in Himachal Pradesh in north India, and Kamarupa in Assam, India. In the ChinnamWJ.qa sadhana the four pit has mentioned are O<;i<;liyana, Pulliramalagiri (or PurQ.agiri), Kamala (or Kamarupa) and Srihana. Srihana replacesjalandhara. These latter four pithas are consistent in many of ChinnamuQ.Qa sadhanasY According to Sircar Srihana is modern Sylhet in Assam. ln Tantric Buddhism a Buddha manifests in four types of bodies--the Emanation Body (nirmaiJakaya) which associated with the navel, the Complete Enjoyment Body (sambhogakaya) associated with the throat, the Truth Body (dharmakaya) associated with the heart, and the Great Happiness Body (mahasukhakaya) associated with the forehead, i.e., the place of the third eye. The most commonly known body is the Emanation Body, such as that ofSakyamuni Buddha who appeared in the human"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"The Question is not-To be or not to be 71 world, though it also includes manifold other Emanation Bodies which help beings in ways appropriate their circumstances. The Complete Enjoyment Body is only perceptible by high-level Bodhisattvas, and the other two bodies can be experienced only by other Buddhas. This ability of manifesting different bodies is one of the talents of a Buddha. Further-more, each of the manifestations is connected with a cakra in one's body, whereby each person has the potential to become a Buddha and to manifest these bodies. These are the praises to the pi{has and the kayas. ( 4) Repetition of mantras is a common practice in the both Hindu and Buddhist Tanuic traditions. In Buddhism usually a practitioner undergoes a retreat and makes a determination to recite 100,000 times, or a multiple of 100,000 times, the syllables in the root mantra of the deity accompanied by ritual worship including the visualization meditation. Sometimes the practitioner does this retreat in order to establish a stronger spiritual bond with the chosen deity, or a practitioner may have more mundane inten-tions, e.g., acquisition of power and boons. Upon successful completion of a retreat, a fire ceremony is performed as a thanksgiving to the deity, and \"to pacify excess and omission that may have occurred during the retreal and for the welfare of sentient beings\".43 (5) gTor ma offerings (bali) are equivalent to the sacrificial offerings in the Hindu practice. These gtor ma are ritual cakes which in Tibet are made of barley flour, butter, and frequently brown sugar. As one offers the gtor ma, one must imagine that one is a deity. Then offerings emanate from space and are transformed into nectar (amrta). One offers these to many different deities and protectors, both benign and malevolent-gods, nagas, bhiitas, pretas, pisacas, etc. 44 These offerings are made to appease the deities and to propitiate their aid. Tucci states: An imaginary plane is reached, on which the sacrificer and the whole feast (mgron) to which the imagined divine guests are invited to come together in an apothecsis transcending space and time. This series of innerconnected visions however always remain within the structure of the ritual architecture of a supranormal world which opens before the par-ticipants in these meditations.45 A practitioner, if desired and time permits, can present these 'ritual cakes' daily but usually they are offered only on certain days and for particular reasons.

As with Hindu praises, most Buddhist practitioners have not pledged to perform these praises daily; however, they are encouraged to do so. The praises contain a description ofTrikayavajrayogiru (lit., three-bodies ofVajrayoginl, i.e., ChinnamillfQa, Vajravairocani, and Vajravall)ini) which state that blood is issuing from the three subtle channels (n;icjis). This demonstrates that ChinnamuQ.Qa's iconography is a visual depiction of the yogic practice of controlling the subtle winds within the main subtle channel and its two ancillaries. The praises are self-explanatory and the objects of supplication include the attainment of the siddhis, becoming Vajrasattva,50 and the attainment of Buddhahood for all sentient beings.

CoMPARISON oF BuooJUST AND HINDU TANTRA The goal of Buddhism and Hinduism reflect the understanding and ex-perience of the unconditioned or ultimate reality of each tradition. For the Hindus, generally speaking, the goal is for one's Atman to become liber-a ted from cyclic existence and to merge with the impersonal Brahman or to be eternally with one's chosen deity.55 Each individual will eventually achieve this permanent state and does not return to cyclic existence. The main exceptions are the avatars who continually \"descend\" to earth when chaos and evil prevail. Tantric Buddhists desire to achieve Buddha-hood in the shortest time possible, not to escape cyclic existence, but in order to help other beings in achieving Buddhahood as quickly as pos-sible. In Vajrayana sadhanas, including the Chinnamw:uja Vajravarahi 5adhana, explicitly or implicitly the generation of the bodhicitta, the four immeasurables, and the dedication of merit are the sections of a sadhana"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"76 Chinnamasta which stress this altruistic intention of achieving Buddhahood for the sake of all sentient beings. The concept of bodhidtta and the Bodhisattva ideal are some of the most distinctive features of Mahayana Buddhism. 56 An-other important difference between Hinduism and Mahayana is that all Mahayana methods operate with the underlying premise of the under-standing of voidness of intrinsic existence. To achieve these goals there are many methods and some of these methods can lead a practitioner astray. Many Hindu and Buddhist Tantric sadhanas warn the practitioner not to become enamoured by the acqui-sition of siddhis and other supranormal powers. These powers are so attractive that some practitioners seek to acquire these worldly aims and are not interested in liberation for themselves or others. A true and pure practitioner would consider them only as means to the goal but not the goal itself. 57 The Hindus have eight siddhis, but these are not identical to the Buddhist ones. (See the beginning of the chapter for the Buddhist siddhis.) The Hindu siddhis are: (1) A.Qiman-the ability to become very small to the size of an atom; (2) Mahiman-the ability to become very big; (3) Laghiman-the ability to become very light; ( 4) Cariman-the ability to become very heavy; (5) Pr:ipti-the power to obtain everything; (6) Pr:ikamya-the power of irresistible will, (7) isitva-the power of supremacy; and (8) Vasitva-the power to subdue anything. 58\" Comparing these mundane accomplishments with the eight siddhis and the six supra normal powers of the Buddhists, similarities are evident. These include the basic interest in dominating or subduing, in changing one's form, in controlling elements or at least, not being subject to their influence, and generally in controlling of animate and inanimate things. Although these siddhisand supranormal powers should not be sought for the motive of acquiring power, they may be utilized to anract a person to the Hindu or Buddhist path. 59 Let us look at specific methods described in two sadhanas of the Hindu Chinnamasta and the Buddhist Chinnamur;t<;ia Vajravarahi. The \"Chinnamastatantra\" of the Sakta Pramoda is divided into nine sections from the visualization of the deity to the repetition of thousand names. Among all the Buddhist sadhanas of Chinnamur;t<;ia, none is as complete as the Hindu one and some sections such as the kavaca and thousand names se<..1ions are rarely found in the Ruddhist .sadhanas. If one contrasts the ritual worship section (ptija) which is the heart of all daily Tantric practice in both traditions, one can formulate both basic patterns which"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"The Question is not-To be or not to be 77 are common to all Tantric practices and distinct differences between Buddhism and Hinduism. The Hindu piija section begins with the regular preliminaries which include homage to one's guru and one's chosen deity (i$(3devata) and then proceeds to the Tantric preliminaries. The Buddhist piija section of regular preliminaries also begins with homage to one's deity and to one's guru but it adds in the specifically Buddhist practice of taking refuge in the Three jewels, generating bodhicitta., and cultivating the four immeasurables all with the underlying premise of the voidness of inherent existence. The Hindu puja continues with the cleansing of oneself through ablution which in Buddhism is represented by the purification of oneself by reciting the hundred-syllable mantra ofVajrasanva. The next Hindu section consists of various ny:isa which empower oneself and transform one's body into a divine body.60 This is a very elaborate section compared to the Buddhist consecration of one's body;61 however, both traditions of Chinnamasta insist that one's ordinary self must be transformed into an extraordinary self in order to worship. In the Hindu rite of bhutasuddhi, the practitioner imagines that his/her body composed of the five elemenL'i are being reabsorbed gradually into Brahman, then progressively in re-verse order, the body becomes manifest again indicating that she/he is co-substantial with Brahman. In the Buddhist rite of purification, a practitio-ner visUalizes that his/her body is completely cleansed of impurities and after purification, his/her body is blessed gradually by Vajrasattva and consort. The blessing begins with the head, then throat, heart, and the entire body. Upon completion of the purification and consecration, one can meditate on Chinnamasta/Chinnamur:l<;ia and draw or visualize her 'residence' which in Hinduism is known as a yantra and in Buddhism as a mar:u;Jala. The Hindu sadhana elaborates on Chinnamasta's residence with the special conch ritual which is very important in Hindu Tantric worship. This special couch is frequently filled with wine'indicating the blissful nature of the Goddess. This is followed by the pi(ha pujii. Although the m;u:u;lala yant/'3, special conch, and pf(ha (the goddess' throne) are known as her residence, she is everything in the ceremony. The practitio-ner should identify everything with Chinnamasta. Thus both I Iinduism and Buddhism have three main preliminaries: (1) purification of oneself, (2) consecration of oneself, and( 3) visualizing Chinnamasta!ChinnamuQ.<;ia and the creation of her residence. Proceeding to the actual meditation session of the deity, one begins in both traditions with an invitation to the deity. Here we encounter two major differences between the Hindu and Buddhist sadhanas. In the Buddhist sadhana, the practitioner imagines or experiences (depending"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"78 Chinnama.sta on ability) the voidness of inherent existence prior to the actual visualiza-tion. Then one visualizes oneself as Chinnamul)<;ia. By contrast, in the Hindu practice, there is no mention of voidness of inherent existence and Chinnamasta remains in front of the pr'actitioner. Since in Hindu T~ntra Chinnamasta is in front, the practitioner who has already been trans-formed into a deity can instill the vital breath (pnil:Japrati?{ha), and con-secrate her six limbs, whereas in the Buddhist sadhana, the practitioner has already undergone this consecration, so does not need to perform this ritual while she/he is visualizing her/himself as Chinnamul)Qi. In the conclusion section both s:idhanas have some similarities. An important difference is that in the Buddhist s:idhana which upholds the Mahayanist ideal of altruism, a practitioner concludes with the dedication of merit. Although many sections of the actual meditation on the deity arc similar in both traditions, differences arc apparent. The two main differences are the method generating the deity and the dedication of merit; the latter is a fundamental Buddhist component not found in the Hindu sadhana. In regard to the fire ceremony in both traditions the practitioner offers certain items in the fire, repeats certain mantras, and performs the cere-mony for specific reasons. The concept of performing a fire sacrifice (yajiia) originated in the Vedic times and eventually was incorporated in both the Tantric traditions. According to the Hindus there arc six types of accomplishments as a result of performing specific versions of the fire ceremony. These six are: (1) appeasing (sant.I), (2) influencing ( vasyam), (3) 'stunning' (stambhanam), (4) causing division or hating (dve~am), (5) causing to flee (ucca{ana), and (6) killing (maraiJa). The Buddhists have four divisions of accomplishments, which are: (1) appeasing (sancl), (2) increasing or prospering (pau~fika), (3) dominating ( vasTkaraiJa), and (4) destroying (m:ira.tJa). The first (appeasing) and last (destroying) of each tradition are the same and all the other Hindu ones can be classified under the 'dominating' category in Buddhism. Furthermore, the domi-nating and killing categories arc under the rubric of the 'dreadful rites' (abhicara).62 The sadhanas do not have specific fire ceremonies for each type of accomplishment specifically tailored to Chinnamasta/ Chinnamu.Q.c;ia. 63 Although many of the basic components of the practice to Chinnamasta!ChinnamUl)<;la are similar in the two traditions, there are some fundamental differences."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"The Question is not-To be or not to be 79 REFERENCES 1.

In a Tantric sad.hana, worship of a deity involves either imagining oneself as the deity or visualizing the deity in front of oneself. An oft-quoted verse in the Hindu tradition is \"In order to worship a deity, one must become a deity.\"1 In Buddhist Tantra, one must visualize oneself as a specific deity in order to acheive Buddha-hood. In Tantra in Tibet, the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso states: In order to attain the definite goodness of the highest achievement, Buddhahood, deity yoga is needed. Also, in order to auain the common achievements, the eight feats and so forth, one must view one's body clearly as a divine body and train in the pride of being a deity. Without deity yoga the Mantra path is impossible; deity yoga is the essence of Mantra.2 Imagining oneself as a deity is not unique to the Tantric method, but it is a major component. Why must one visualize oneself as a deity? According to the Tantric method a practitioner, whose motives are pure, seeks the most expedient means to liberation or Buddhahood. 3 These means consist in visualization of the deity. The deity represents the ideal, the refmed form: which has no defilements or obscurations preventing liberation from cydic existence. How does one become like the deity? In order to understand this Tantrk method, one must remember that the Tantras inherited much from Upani~adic thought. One central concept is the Upani~adic hypostasy of macrocosmic equivalents in the human body; each part of the body is a homology of a place or thing in the universe.4 Hy accepting this macrocosm/microcosm homology, a Tantric prac-titioner mentally merges the self and a deity because the deity's body is an undefiled microcosm of the universe.

Bharati states: 'What distinguishes ~ntric form from other Hindu and Buddhist teaching is its systematic emphasis on the identity of the absolute (paf3.1Tl:irthaJ 3nd the phenomenal (vyavahara) when filtered through the experience of the sadhana.5 Both Tantric traditions do agree that the !~dhana is of central importance and that the imagining of oneself as the deity is the essential part of the sadhana. Furthermore, in Hinduism and Buddhism, someone or some-thing becomes distinct by name and form (mimarilpa). In chapter 3 the name and its significance was discussed and in this chapter the aspect of form will be explored. ln this study of Hindu Chinnamasta and Ruddhist ChinnamuiJ<;ia, the particular visualization and its mterpretations of form are dependent on the particular Tantric traclition. This chapter will com-pare and contrast various hermeneutics which reflect the particular reli-gious tenets of Hinduism or Buddhism; also herein will be demonstrated the commonality of the two Tantric traditions. Though there arc many sadhanas of Chinnamasta/Chinnamlll).Qa, com-mentaries are rare. The earliest commentary is from one of the older Hindu texts, Mantramahodadhi, by Mahidhara in 1589c.E. Chronologically, the next one is the Buddhist one by 'Jam dbyangs mkhyen brtse'i dbang po (1820-1892) in the rGyud sde kun btus(Vol.23). The other t.~ree are recent Hindu commentaries--\"Da5a Mahavidya,. by S. G. Srimotilal in the Sakti Arika 0934), the Kashmir Saivite commentary of 'Chinnamasta' by). !vlisra in Bharatiya Pmtikavidya(Patna, 1959), and the aforementioned \"Sri Chinnamasta Nityarcana\" commentary by Sri Swamiji Maharaja. Of these five only Misra gives a word for word or line for line commentary; the rest only emphasize a few salient points. Commentaries on Chinnamasta arc difficult to find because she is an uncommon Tantric deity. Frequently Tantric sadhanas were kept secretly and were only revealed to initiates who took the vow (samaya) to practise the sadhana. Some of the sadhanas state that this sadhana should not be revealed to anyone who does not cherish it more than one's own life. With this injunction, public accessibility to this material was limited until this century when scholars began to compile and translate these texts. In recent decades ~me of the Hindu gurus and Buddhist blamas have been more willing to bestow initiations and impart commentary on many Tantric sadhanas. Thus as the sadha.nas arc revealed, perhaps oral commentary and eventually writ-"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Visualization oFChinnamasta/ChinnamuiJqa 85 ten commentary will become more readily available for lesser known deities, such as Chinnamasta. The hermeneutics will depend on wrincn commentaries, oral commentary, and general Tantric scholarship to inter-pret the sadhanas, as well as the Upani~adic \"inheritance\". TilE SADHANAS The first sadhana is from the Buddhist Sadhanamala which contains 312 sadhanas of various Buddhist deitics.6 TI1e sadhana of the headless Vajrayogini is as follows:' The practitioner should visualize (lit., meditate) at one's navel an openeJ white lotus surmounted by a very red solar disc. On top of that IS a sindura. (red) colored Hrii!J. This Hrif!J transforms into Bhanarika Vajrayogini (the practitioner imagining him/herself as Goddess) who is of yellow color, who holds in her left hand her own self-severed head with the scimitar (ka.rtr) held in her right hand. Her left hand is raised upwards while the right is extended below. She is nude ( va.sa.na. sunyi), and her ri~ht leg is outstretched while the left is bent. The practitioner meditates on the streams of blood issuing from the severed body as f:Illing into the mouth of her severed head and into the mouths of the two Yoginis on either side of her. The practitioner should also vi~ualize the two Yoginis to the left and right (of the principal goddess), the green (Syama) Vajravan;aini and the yellow Vajravairocani, both of whom hold the scimitar (kart[) in their left and right hands respectively, and the skulkup ()ca.ra.pa.) m the right and left hands respectively. Their left and right legs respectively :lre out-stretched, while the other legs are bent, and their hair is dishevelled. On ail sides, between the two Yoginis and in the intermediate space (anta.rik:;a) is the very frightening cremation ground. The second sadhana is a Buddhist meditation which is a combination of two earlier meditations. It is from the Yidam rgya mtsho 'i sgrob thabs rin chen 'byung gnas by Taranatha and reads as follows: From space, light rays emanate from the letter 'Ram' in your navel. Your body has become a red rriangle ma.r:uja.la.; in the center is a four petalled white lotus, in il'i centre is your mind of enlightenment (bodhicirt3) as a moon and on the moon is the sun. The sun and moon combine, from the middle of this combination emanate three 'Hril)' which transform into three scimitars (kart[) inscribed with a 'Hril_l'. All merge into one. ln the midst of this m('rging emanates a reddish yellow Buddha\"akini whose right leg is extended and left leg is bent as she stands on Kali (T. dus mtshan ma.). In her right hand she brandishes a scimitar which hangs downwards and in her left hand she holds a skulkup of blood; under her left ann is a white"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"86 Chinnamasti kha(variga which symbolizes method (including bodhicitta). On her left. side stands Vajravan:tini (rDo rje rab bsngags ma) who is green and has her left leg extended; she brandishes a scimitar in her right hand and a skullcup in her left. To the righ£ of the main deity stands Vajravairocani who is yellow, has her right foot extended, holds a knife in her right hand and a skullcup in her left one. All (three deities) are wearing an ornament of five dried skulls (as a tiara) on £heir heads and fifty freshly severed heads as a garland. Each has the five ornaments (mudra5). All are nude, inexhaustible, have three eyes, dishevelled hair, and faces which are both angry and ~miling; they are fright-ening to those who are lerrifying to others. They arc sitting in the middle of the great burning grounds. The main Q;ikinls right hand brandishes a scimitar with which she has severed her own head which she holds by the hair strands in her lefl hand. ller lhree eyes look downwards. At the place where the head has been severed, three SL•btle channels have been cut. from the central channel red and white drops are rnixcd and blood spurts into her mouth. From the left channel blood mixed with Ak!?Qbhaya falls into the left c;lakinls mouth and frorn the righ! channel blood mixed with ordinary blood falls into the right c;lakinls mouth. You should meditate with clarity and strong effort in this manner as long as you can. The third sadhana is from one of the older Hindu texts, the Mantramahodadhi, by Mahidhara.8 In addition he wrote a commentary named Nauki (lit., boat).9 In chapter 6 one finds the meditation of Chinnamasta as follows: I pay homage to goddess Chinnamasta who shine~ in the middle of the solar disc, who holds in her left hand her own severed head wilh dishevelled hair, whose moUlh is open wide and who drinks her own blood dripping down from her neck, who i!) stationed above Hali and Smara who are engaged in sexual intercourse, and who is extremely pleased in seeing her anendants, Qakini and VarQini. Mahidhara' s only comment on this meditation is that yabha means sexual intercourse and that Chinnamasta is standing on Rati and Kama who are indulging in sexual intercourse.10 The second Hindu sadhana is from another Hindu Tantric compen-dium, the Tantrasara, wrinen by Y~~Qananda AgamavagiSa at the end of the sixteenth century.11 This Tantrasara is a digest for serious Hindu Sakta Ta ntric practitioners. N. N. Bha ttacharyya states that the Tantras:ira is the \"most comprehensive and popular of the numerous digests that are in Bengal. A few manuscripts of this work are found in non-Bengali scripts, and outside of Bengal, indicating thereby the ex-tent of its popularity.\"12 In the Tantrasara, Chinnamasta is not listed as a deity; however, Pracary<;fa-caQ4ika is.13 PracaQ<;ia-cal).<;iika is another name for Chinnamasta because from the first verse, the deity is referred"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Visualization of Chinnamasta/ChinnamUI)c;/a 87 to as Chinnamasta. In this PracaQ.Qa-caQ.<;iika section there are four visualizations of the deity. The most elaborate is the first one which is as follows: 14 Visualize in your navel, a haif-opened white lotus and in its centre is a solar disc red as a hibiscus flower and resembling a red bandhuka flower. This disc is decorated with an equilateral triangle pointing downward which is formed by three lines, each representing a gul)a (beginning in the left in an counter-clockwise direction) rajas, sattva, and camas. Standing in the middle is the Great Goddess (Mahadevi, i.e. Chinnamasta) who is as effulgent as ten million suns. In her left hand she holdc; her own head; her mouth is wide open, and the tip of her tongue is lolling. She drinks the sanguine stream issuing from her recently-severed throat. Her ha1r is loose, dishevelled and decorated with various flowers. In her right hand she brandishes a scimitar (kart{); she is nude, extremely fierce to behold, decorated with a skull rosary, and stands in the prary:iliqha stance. She wears a bone necklace and has a snake as her sacred cord. She is a perpetual sixteen-year-old with full firm breasts. She stands on Rati and Kama who are in reverse sexual embrace (i.e. Rati is above Kama). One visualizes in this manner saying the mancra. She is flanked by I)akini and Van~ini to her left and right respectively. Vafl')inl is drinking from the nectar-like sanguine stream which is shooting up from the Goddess' neck. She is red with a smiling face, has loose hair and is nude. She holds a skull and a sdrnitar in her left hano and right hands respectively. She wears a snake as her sacred cord and has a fiery splendour. Decorated with various ornaments and a bone rosary, she stands in the praty:ilic;lha stance and is a perpetual twelve year old. On the goddess' left side is I)akini whose brilliance equals the fire at the end of an aeon. Her matted hair glistens like lightning, her teeth 9.'ith protruding canines arc as white as cranes and she has swelling breasts. This great goddess is terrihle to behold-nude with loose hair, has a great flickering tongue and is ornamented with a skull rosary. Her left and right handc; hold a skull and a scimitar respectively. She drinks the ambrosial sanguine stream issuing from Chinnamasta's neck. She is extremely terrifying and holds a terrible skull. A wise devotee should meditate upon this Goddess attended by these two, VaTQini and Oakini. The Bhairava Tamra states: She holds in her left hand her own head with a sku II and drinks her blood with her mouth. The Tantra states that whoever per-forms this worship without meditating on Chinnamac;ta, the Goddess will sever his (or her) head and drink his (or her) blood. These four sadhanas are the basis of interpreting how Chinnamasta is depicted and the significance of the various items depicted. The interpre-tation is divided into three categories: (1) the deity's location, (2) the deity and her implements, and (3) the deity's anendants."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"88 Chinnamasta TilE DEITY'S LOCATION Although no location is given in Mahidhara 's s:idhana, he does imply a location by referring to the solar disc. In the other three s:idhanas, the practitioner must visualize the deity at the navel. Taranatha's meditation begins with the visualization emanating from space. In accordance with Buddhist belief in the lack of an inherent self, in most Buddhist Tantric s:idhanas, the visualization of the deity is preceded by the words 'from space' or a mantra, such as, Om Svabhavasuddhal) Sarvadhannal) Svabhava5uddho 'Ham.15 These words remind the practitioner that neither the deity nor the meditator have a permanent, eternal nature. The Hindu meditations do not begin like this because they do believe in an unchanging eternal self, the atman. This is a major philosophical differ-ence between the two traditions. The Navel In j. Misra's commentary, he states that the navel is the centre of consciousness (nabhi lcetana ke vistara ke bindusthanaJ merp.). In the beginning of creation is consciousness; as the first vibration expands itself (Skt. spanda), it becomes equated with the bindu in the navel.16 Since the navel is equated with creation, this implies that Chinnamasta's loca-tion is in the source of creation. A Tantric explanation of the navel, specifically the maiJipiira cakra located at the navel, is that the maiJ.ipiira cakra is the locus of creation and also dissolution, its necessary complement. 17 The navel is not ordinarily associated with dissolution; but for a Tantric practitioner, it is. According to both Hindu and Buddhist Tantra, a practitioner must eliminate the concept of duality in order to be liberated. Both Tantric traditions accept that duality is caused by the subtle winds which are located in the two subtle channels. At the maiJipiira cakra the right subtle channel, piilgala na<;li (in Hinduism) or rasana na<;fi (in Buddhism), and the left subtle channel, iga na<;fi(in Hinduism) or /a/ana na<;li(in Buddhism), converge with the central subtle channel, s~u1l11Ja naqi(in Hinduism) or aV3dhiiti na<;/i(in Buddhism). The subtle wind'i traverse the side channels but these winds are impeded in entering the central channel because the opening at the mal)ipiira cakra is dosed. As long as the entrance is closed, a person experiences duality. This duality can be understood in many ways but at the maJ).ipiira cakra, duality indicates the duality of creation and dissolu-tion. People who do not know how to manipulate the opening of the central channel will not experience the dissolution aspect until the time"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Visualization ofChinnamasta/ChinnamuQc;ia 89 of death. At the time of death the winds enter naturally and effortlessly into the central channel, but a person usually does not remember this because she/he dies. C..onversely, a Tantric practitioner practises bringing the subtle winds into the central channel in order to gain mastery of this process. Why? By mastering this manipulation, one can transcend the entrapment of duality-birth and death-thereby rendering the potent bonds of cyclic existence ineffe<.tive. Eventually by this practice, a Tantric practitioner becomes liberated from Sarp._~ra, cyclic existence. This does not indicate that one need die to experience this unity or non-duality. By becoming familiar with the death process, one can control it when one dies, thereby becoming able to consciously choose rebirth or not. First, the navel is the centre of consciousness--the consciousness which is the pivotal point between the collapsing of consciousness thereby destroying duality as well as the reaffirmation of consciousness creating duality. Second, the ma.Qipura cakra is also a pivotal· point between liberation or enslavement to cyclic existence. If one knows how to open the central channel at the ma.Qipura cakra, one can achieve salvation; conversely, if one does not, one remains in the continual cycle of births and deaths. Thus Chinnamasta is placed at this pivotal point; indicating that she is connected with the power to either enslave or liberate the practitioner. The Lotus According to the Tancrasara meditation, the correct order of visualiza-tion is a white lotus which in its centre has a red solar disc which is decorated with a downward-pointing equilateral triangle. In Taramitha 's meditation the visualization begins with Raq1, whence the practitioner's body is transformed into a red triangular ma.p{lala which at its centre is a four-petalled white lotus topped by a moon and a sun.18 In Hinduism and Buddhism, the lotus as a symbol or implement is ubiquitous. Both the religions associate the lotus with purity and beauty. Frequently a deity is said to have lotus-eyes (padnlak$1), lotus-thighs (padma-uro); more-over they hold lotuses and have a lotus as a seat cushion. In Buddhism the lotus is a powerful symbol because it represents the mind of enlight-enment, bodhicitta. This symbolism developed because a lotus grows from the mud but remains untainted by it Similarly, the lotus of the mind is originally pristine, yet it becomes adventitiously defiled. A Buddhist practitioner is encouraged to realize this mind of purity for the sake of all sentient beings. In Hinduism this concept of bodhicitta is not important, but in Mahayana Buddhism (including Tantra) it is a major concept. All beings must cultivate bodhicitta in order to become enlightened for the"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"90 Chinnamasta sake of all sentient beings. lhus in the two traditionC5 the lotus symbolizes purity but in Tantric Buddhism it is also associated with bodhicitta. Fire Element In the Hindu Tantric text, ~at Cakra Nirop3I}a enjoins \"Meditate there on the region of fire, triangular in form and shining like the rising sun .... \"19 The navel area. specificaJly the m3I}ipiira cakra, is associated with the tejas tattva which is characterized by expansion. the production of heat and stimulation of the visual sense of colour and form.20 In this text on the six cakr:!s, the m3J}ipiira cakra is the region of fire and heat. Furthermore the cak.ra's seed syllable is Rarp known as the Agni bija, the fire god's seed syllable. 21 The Buddhists also state that Raq1 is the seed syallable of the m3J}ipii.ra cakra and that this cakra is associated with the goddess Cal). <;tali, the fire goddess who is propitiated for the attainment of mystical or yogic heat (Tib. gtum mo). 22 This fire located in the m3I}ipura cakra region is not gross fire which is familiar to us but a pure form of the fire element. As Wayman cites in the Buddhist Tantras, E.H. Johnston shows that these elements (wind, fire, water and earth) are already regarded as divine forces in t;pani~adiL literature.23 Fire is very important because when the central channel is opened this fire eventually reaches the top of the head where according to the Tantric traditions nectar (am[ta) is located. When this nectar is heated, it descends the channel and the practitioner experiences bliss in various degrees. Thus one can sec that the mal)ipura cakra is a major pivotal point in regard to bliss and liberation The Inverted Triangle The three-dimensional inverted triangle (i.e., downward pointing) is frequently a symbol of a womb (bhaga) and the feminine. 24 The inverted triangle can be found in many yantras of goddesses, such as the Dasa Maha vidyas. ~ In the meditations on these goddesses the triangle symbol-izes a more abstract concept. The Tantrasara meditation states that the triangle is composed of three lines representing rajas, sattva and camas gul)as. These three 'distinct powers' are found in various proportions in every composed entity. The beings dominated by rajas gul)a exhibit turbulence, instability, volatile actions and pain; those dominated by the sattva gw)a are calm, pleasing and usually illuminating; those dominated by the tam2s guiJa display delusion, confusion and inertia. Since the triangle consists of the three gul)as which are in every composed entity, this indicates that the triangle symbolizes the source of creation. In the centre of the triangle is the bindu, the place of the Goddess. 26 This bindu is known as the mah:iSakti pi{ha, the principal abode of the great feminine"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"\\-'isualization of Chinnamasta/Chinnamurxla 91 power. 27 In Yancra, Khanna states that the bindu is a 'Whole', or 'Full' (pii11Ja), the undiffer~ntiated, all-embracing reservoir of the infinite. 28 In the Buddhist meditations the three-dimensional triangle is called dhannodaya, a specific type of triangle which symbolizes the source of all phenomena (dharmas). 717 Furthermore, there are two types of triangles associated with Vajrayogini-the single or the double. Tucci states in The Theory and Practice of the MaiJc;Jala that the dharmodaya signifies a double intersecting triangle, sometimes referred to by others as a tetrahe-dron since it is three dimensional. The dharrnodaya is not always a double intersecting triangle but the double version is definitely more prevalent.30 On the other hand, Mallmann states in the Ni~pannayogavali(l:l4l-l42 n.6.) that the dharmodaya signifies one triangle.31 ln a Tibetan Buddhist mcd:tation on Vajrayogini, it states: All the dharmas comprising grasping and fixation become empty. From within emptiness ... arises the source of dharmas, a triangle .... On that is the nature of my consciousness .. like a fish leaping t'rom water, I arise in the body of jetsun Vajr..:lyoginiY lhis quote, states L'-lat one's visualization, begins with the visualization of Voidness, that all dharma_.; are void (of intrinsic nature), and thar from the Voidness the triangle appears which represents the source of dharmas. On this triangular source of dharmas, the nature of one's consciousness appears in the body of Vajrayogini. In both the Hindu and Buddhist meditations there is a progression or evolution from the source to indi-vidual differentiation. According to Misra, who also has written about the progression in Kashmir Saivitic terms, the white lotus symbolizes creation: as the initial vibration expands, creation occurs. The next step is visualization of the solar disc which represents the universe with form as a reflection (of consciousness) ( vimarsa). This is followed by the triangle which repre-sents the three Saktis(powers) known as icchasakti(will power),jiiana.5akti (knowledge), and kriyasakti(action).33 These three are the sources of impulses which begin the process of differentiation.34 Hence in Misra's commentary, one sees again this process of differentiation from one source; the initial vibration (spanda) inducing creation, followed by spe-cific forms with specific impulses or powers. In sum, as to the location of Chinnamasti, both the Tantric traditions agree that the Chinnamasta 's abode is at the navel in the maiJiprlra cakra, specifically in the centre of the triangle. Both agree that this ma.IJ.ipiira cakra is the locus for yogic heat symbolized by the seed syllable Raf!l. However the two traditions vary in their interpretations of what the"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"92 Chinnamast:i triangle represents. The Hindu texts state the triangle is composed of the three gu{las. The guQas, an ancient concept in Indian thought, remains important to the present time. In several Indian philosophical schools the gu.tJ.as are the basic components of animated beings; these gu{las are the first evolutes of differentiation. 35 Though this is an ancient Indian concept found in the lJpani~ds, the Tantric Buddhists never accepted or adapted this theory. The theory of gu{las piay a minor role in Buddhism compared to its major influence in Hinduism. What becomes important in Buddhist philosophy is the concept of dharma (phenomena). 36 This concept is incorporated in Tantric Buddhism as seen in the ChinnamUQQa Vajrayogiru meditation. For the Tantric Buddhists the inverted triangle does not represent the three guQas or S:lktis which arc the Hindu concepts but symbolizes the source of dharmas(dhannodaya), a Buddhist concept. Thus both the Tantric traditions agree that Chinnamasti stands in the centre of the triangle and that the triangle is the source where differen-tiation begins; however, both traditions interpret this source according to their own philosophical tenets. · TilE DEilY AND HER IMPLEMENTS In all four meditations treated herein the description of Chinnamasta follows the description of her abode in the navel of the body. All these meditations describe Chinnamasta as effulgent and shining like the sun (in Tanuasara as 10 million suns); sometimes she is described as yellow in colour (Sadhanamala) or as reddish yellow (Taranatha), indicating the colour of the setting or rising sun. In Tantric Buddhism the sun is asso-ciated with insight (prajiia}-the insight needed for liberation, the red element, and the female gender. 37 This reddish-yellow colour is also associated with passion. Trungpa states in his Vajrayoginl commentary: \"Such passion is immensely powerful; it radiates its warmth in all direc-tions. It simultaneously nurtures the welfare of beings and blazes to destroy the neurotic tendencies of ego. \"?.8 In Hindu Tantra the sun is interpreted in various Tantras, such as in Prapaiicasaratantra, which ex-plains the Gayatri mantra, tat savitur l'are!Jyarp. bhargo devasya dhimahi dhiyo yo nal) pracodayatas follows: Tac refers to the first cause of all substance in the form of the fiery energy in the disc of the sun, that is .sadanandarp paralJl brahma: the true bliss, the highest Brahman. Savitur ('of the sun') refers to: Always the producer of all animate beings.-'9 Another interpretation is found in the Saradatilaka (1 ,40) which associ-ates the right side in general with the sun and with Agni; in the"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Visualization ofChinnamast.a/Chinnamw;u;ta 93 Rudrayamalatantra ( 17, 97f.) Agni is associated with the ku.Qljalini.40 The sidhanas explicitly state how luminous she is and want to emphasize her effulgence. As the sun is the major source of illumination and growth in its positive value, the practitioner is reminded to regard Chinnamasta this way. After describing Chinnamasta' s effulgence and colour, three medi-tations continue with \"holding her own head in her left hand\". This is significant in two respects: (1) most meditations of Tantric goddesses stress the left., the left being associated with the female.41 (2) By beginning with Chinnamasti's severed head, the authors of the sadhanasare stress-ing the importance of this act; Chinnamasta is one of the few goddesses in Tantric Hinduism and Buddhism who is depicted as holding her own severed head. The symbolism of one's own severed head is complex in Tantra and should be preceded ~y an overview of head symbolism in Hinduism and Buddhism. The Importance of the Head Throughout Indian thought and literature the importance of the head is indisputable. In the famed Puru~ Sukta of the !Jgveda (1 0.90) where Puru~a creates the universe by his own dismemberment, many major creations originated from his head. His mouth became the Brahmin, Indra and Agrj emerged from his mouth, from his eye the sun was born, from his mind the moon, and from his head the sky evolved (1 0.90.12-14). Also in the Satapatha BnihrnaiJa (6.1.1. 4) seven persons were needed to form the head \"Because (in it) they concentrated the. excellence (sn)\". The Brhadarar;waka Upani$adbegins with the chapter, \"The world as a sac-rificial horse\" wherein\" Aum, the dawn, verily is the head of the sacrificial horse (1.1.1)''. In all these quotes the head symbolizes supremacy, the ruler or leader. It is associated with Aum, the m_ost important Indian mystical syllable which symbolizes totality. 42 As in Hinduism, the impor-tance of the head is indisputable in Buddhism. The head is considered the best part of the body. Wayman states in his The Buddhist Tantras, \" ... because the Tantras inherited the viewpoint that a man is a micro-cosm corresponding to the macrocosm .... The head is the highest and best member ... \". 43 The Head as an External Identifying Factor In Indian mythology some stories illustrate how the head is the decisive factor for identifying a person. The two stories which I shall dte are about transposed heads. The first is from the popular Vetila ·vikrama series known as the 'Transposed Heads'. 44 A brief synopsis of the story is that since washerman Dhaval wanted to marry washerwoman Madanasundari,"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"94 Chinnamast3 he went to propitiate the great goddess, Gauri, and made an oath that he would offer his head if his wish was granted. Indeed his wish was granted and the two wed. Later when his wife, her brother and he went to visit his father-in-law, they passed by the Gauri Temple. When he entered the temple, he remembered his oath and severed his head. 45 A while later, his brother-in-law entered the temple and seeing what hap~ned to Dhavala, he also severed his head. Madanasundari was waiting out'iide and won-dering what happened to her husband and brother. When she entered the temple and saw what had occurred, she deeded to sever her head. However, Goddess Gauri intervened and commanded her to join the heads with their respective bodies. In her haste, she inadvertently nus-placed the he-ads. The vetala, who is narrating the story to King Vikramasena. asked him. \"Who is to perform the service of Madanasundari's husband?\" The King replied, \"0 Vetala, the head is the seat of the five senses, the five motions, the hands and feet and so on. The head is the basis for the parts. Therefore the woman belongs to the head.\"46 Another story is a version of Rer:lUka 's beheading. 47 In this version two women are beheaded; one is the high ca~1e ReiJ.uka and the other is a low caste woman. Para5urama pleaded with his father to revive his mother, Rel).uka. When his father did give permission, it was very dark and Para.furama acddentally transJX>sed the heads. As in the Vetalavikrama :S 'The Transposed Heads', the head determined who was whom. ReiJ.uka was determined to be the one with ReiJ.uka's head and the low caste woman's body. Both stories emphasize that the head and its external characteristics are crucial in identifying the person. <411 11Je Head as an Internal Identifying Factor In Buddhism external characteristics of persons or objects are caused by karma but manifest in form. Form is one of the five aggregates (skandhas) which as a whole creates a semblance of an eternal self (atman). Each aggregate is assigned a particular place in the body; the form aggregate is placed in the head. Wayman in his \"Five-fold Ritual Symbolism of Passion\" quotes Tsong-kha-pa's commentary,' Dod 'jo, on the Sncakrasarpvaratantra as follows: The Vi~e$adyota (Toh.l 51 0) explains that since the aggregate of form (nipa skandha) is the basis of seeds, the chief place of the nipa skandha is the middle of the head; and explains that the forehead is the place of the bindu: hence one contemplates it (i.e., the skandha of form) there .... 49 Furthermore, in Hindu and Buddhist philosophies the concept of form"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Visualization ofChinnamast3/Gninnamu{u;/a 95 coupled with the concept of name (namariipa) are major components in establishing individuality or differentiation. This concept is well-devel-oped in the early Upani~ds, such as in Brhad:irar;J.yaka Upani{;ad(1.4.7.): \"At that time this (universe) was undifferentiated. It became differenti-ated by name and form ... \" Thus these statements show that the form aggregate is located in the head and that the coupling of form and name create differentiation. Furthermore, in Tantric Hinduism, as in Tantric Buddhism, the head is the source of seed. 50 This creates differentiation by invoking the illusion of a separate individual; by having such an illusion, an individual does not feel connected with the great soul (par:itman) which pervades everything. The Kau§itaki Brahmai)a Upani~.,ad(l.6) states: \"All this, whatever there is. All this you are.\" Unlike Hindus, Buddhists do not accept any eternal self (pariitman) yet the grasping at the concept of an individual inherent self (atmagraha) is a major impediment to liberation. A Tantric Buddhist must realize that there is no individual inherent self (atrnan) nor any great self (paratman) by experiencing the voidness of intrinsic narure in all persons (pudgala nairatmya) and phenomena (dharma nairatmya). In summation both the religious traditions do accept that the concept of an individual self is an impediment to liberation. However the I findus believe that the individual self and the great self do exist eternally and one only has to realize that the individual self is part of the great self. 51 In contra-distinction the Buddhists do not accept the belief in a permanent inherent self (;itman) and instead stress the realization of voidness of an inherent self. The Symbolic Significance of .t;evering the Head The Buddhist and Hindu religious traditions want to sever the concept of the individual self, but for different reasons. The following stories illustrate the realization of voidness of intrinsic reality of persons (pudgala nairatmya) by Buddhist practitioners who severed their grasping at the concept of an individual self (atmagraha). In the following story Gam-po-pa, a main disciple of the Tibetan yogin, Milarepa, is meditating and attempting to gain some sort of realization.52 The story is as follows: Thereupon Gam-po-pa set up hermitage three miles removed from Milarepa 's cave and began meditating. After six weeks, he had vis1ons; the first day the Buddha appeared, the second day a mar:u;lala, and so on. Each time, he reponed his visions to Milarepa, who kept on saying, \"'t is nothing! Go back to your practice.\" After a few more weeks, Gam-po-pa had a vivid vision of all six worlds, and naturally he thought that he hit the mark. He ran to Milarepa to report, but Milarepa was sleeping. The"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Chinnamasra MHarepa merely said, \"Let me sleep! I am not a scholar like you. But I know lhat the Prajc'iaparamita says aU this is mere illusion I suggest that you go back and practise!\" Gam-po-pa, crestfallen and frustrated, re-lumed to his meditation. At length, he dreamt one day that he had cut off his own head and that he saw il rolling down the hill. Thereafter there were no more visions, for lhe root of • 4cmagnlh;l was cut off.S' In this episode one learns that the severing of the head symbolizes the destruc~ion of the erroneous belief in a permanent self. Gam-po-pa no longer has visions because he transcended the duality of subject and object. This understanding can be found also in the Tibetan Buddhist Tantric collection, rGyud sde kun btus(vol. 23: 412), wherein 'Jam dbyang mkhyen brtse'i dbang po states, \"The understanding of the non-existence of apprehended and apprehender is symbolized by her ( Chinnamui).Qa 's) form''.54 This explanation is the raison d'etreto practise the sadhana of ChinnamUI).Qi, i.e., a practitioner's goal is to understand the illusory nature of the dichotomy of subje<.t and object. The ultimate reality is the non-duality of form and voidness as illus-trated in another story. This story describes the realizations of the two Mahasiddha yogin is, Mekhala and Khanakala (see chapter 1). In this story they sang this song of realization as they severed their heads and offered them to their teacher, Mahasiddha Kanhapa. They sang: Through the grace of the Guru's instrucuon, uniting creative and fulfilment meditation, we destroy the distinction between 5aJ71sara and nirvaQa; vision and action united in co-incident harmony we destroy the distinction between accep-tance and rejection; In the union of vast space and pure awareness we destroy the distinction between self and others. As tokens of the indeterminate, we offer these gifts. The guru exclaimed: Behold these two great Yoginis! They have reached their goal in joy! Now forgetting your own peace and happiness, live for the sake of others!ss These two yogini' s were able to sever their heads when asked by their teacher. This act of severing their heads, as in Gam-pa-pa's meditation, revealed their understanding of voidness of intrinsic reality of persons. The two yogini sisters realized the non-duality of opposites: sarpsa.ra and nirval)a, self and others, etc. They had transcended this illusory dicho-"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Visualization ofChinnamasta/ChinnamUI)<;/i 97 tomy and were equipped with the proper insight and means to help others in achieving enlightenment. In Hinduism, one finds many statements in the Upani~ds of severing one's concept of an individual self (atma.n) because this individual self is, in reality, part of the great self (paramatman). Though this great self is pervasive, it is extremely subtle and cannot be easily perceived. In the Ch:il)qogya Upan~d(6.13.l) Svetakeru is instructed by his father about the great self. This is a description of the essence illustrated by nyagrodha tree. l.\"Bring here a fruit of that nyagrodha tree ... Break it ... What do you see there?\" \"These very small seeds, Venerable Sir.'' \"Of these, please break one .... What do you see?\" \"Nothing at all, Venerable Sir.\" 2.Then he said, \"My dear, that subtle essence which you do not perceive, verily, my dear, from that very essence this great nyagrodha tree exists. Believe me, my dear. 3.That which is the subtle essence, this whole world has for its self. That is Ln.Je. That is the self. That is you Svetaketu. This example illustrates that the self is pervasive such that even if it is broken into the smallest parts and becomes imperceptible to the senses, it does exist. Also the Katha Upani$3d 1.2.18 says: The knowing self is never born; nor does it die at any time. It ~pr.mg from nothing and nothing sprang from it. It 1s unborn, eternal, abiding and primeval. It is nol slain when the body is slain. In both these quotes, the annihilation of the seed or the body does not destroy the essence-the unborn, eternal, abiding, primeval self. Moreover, it stresses that what a person believes to be the self-the individual unit, the seed, or the body-is part of a greater whole. Yet one must ask if Chinnama~ti with her decapitated head is dead or alive? Everyone would agree that without one's head, one could not exist. This is the paradox of Chinnamasta. Ernest Payne in his The .Saktas quotes Ronaldshay as stating that Chinnamasta \"symbolized the Motherland (India) 'decapi-tated by the English, but nevertheless preserving her vitality unimpaired by drinking her own blood'.\" Kinsley also feels that she is alive and thriving but not by her own means. Kinsley states, \"She is shown being nourished or sustained not by death (or sacrifice) but by the copulating couple beneath her.\";6 This frozen moment of temporarily decapiwjng her head indicates her ability to transcend the relative dichotomy of life and death."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"98 Chinnamasta Before discussing the severing of the head in sacrificial terms, I shall mention a popular p~;ychoanalytical interpretation initially propounded by Freud. 57 This interpretation of the severing of the head as a castration symbol is applied by prominent authors, such as Wendy Doniger and Gananath Obeyesekere. 58 Obeyesekere states that a castration ~ymbol for a woman is to sever her breasts which can be identified with the penis.~ The Buddhist Goddess Pattini does sever her breasts but Chinnamasta does not. Though there is no 'displaced' castration in Chinnamasta's iconography or myths, 0' Flaherty does discuss the head held by Chinnamasta under the heading of' Beheading and Castration'. She states in Women, Androgynes and Other Mythical Beasc.r; that though Chinnamasta appears to be holding her own head, it could be Siva's.60 \"The question remains ambiguous, perhaps purposely ambiguous ... but it is possible that some Tantric texts may identify the head as Siva's.\" I agree with O'Flaheny that Chinnamasta's decapitation is ambiguous and, indeed, purposely ambiguous. Chinnamasta's temporary decapitation is a koan. However all sadhanas explidtly state that she holds her own head which she has severed with her own knife. Moreover according to the sadhanas Chinnamasta has only temporarily severed her head. Near the end of the .sadhana, a practitioner must visualize the severed head being put back on the body. If this act of Chinnamast.a's decapitation symbol-izes castration, then why would the head be replaced at the end of sadhana\"f'1 Courtright in his GaJ)e..Sa also discusses the severing of the he-ad in terms of castration symbolism but he is not satisfied with this explanation alone. He presents some very insightful discussions about the symbolism of a severed head and his concluding words from the section on the severed head arc especially pertinent to interpreting Chinnamasta's self decapita-tion. Personal fulfilment comes when personal idiosyncratic auachments give way to acceptance of the transpersonal divine order, an order made apparent only at the moment in which the particular self surrenders itself. The Maharashtrian poet-saint Tukarama expressed this theological vision succinctly (Tuk:irama Catha no. 3414, 3171) If we want to enjoy God, we should lop off our head from our body and hold it in our hands When the oody has been sacrificed to god, says Tuka, all worship has been accomplished 62 Another modern commentator, S.G. Motilal, discusses the severing of Chinnamast.a' s head as significant of the head offering sacrifice.63 Motilal"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Visualization ofChinnamast.a/ChinnamUI)!}a 99 enumerates five methods of sacrifice (yajiia) of which the fifth is the splitting of the head sacrifice. He emphasizes that according to 5ruti the sacrifice of the severed head is the essence of sacrifice because in every sacrifice there is a head ritual. A story connected with the head ritual is in the Satapatha BrahmaiJa (14.1.1.f0 which recounts the legend when Vi~Q.u gained glory (sn) but was unable to contain it, thereby losing his head by his own bow. His head became the sun. When he lost his head, vital sap emerged which was wiped up by the gods, especially Indra who arrived first. Indra wanted all the glory for himself; however Dadhyaik Atharvana knew the sweet essence of the 'pravargya sacrifice' which is how to restore the head and how the sacrifice becomes complete (Satapatha BarhmaiJa 14. 1.1. 19). Indra threatened to sever Dadhyaiic' s head if he divulged this secret to anyone. The ASvins heard of Dadhyaiic' s knowledge and offered themselves as his disciples. He refused until the A.-ivins promised to protect him with a ruse of putting a horse's head on him when he revealed the secret. Then when Indra severed Dadhyaiic' s head (the horse's head), the Asvins replaced Dadhyaiic's own head (14.1.2.9). This 'pravargya sacrifice' is involved with the severed head and how to join it sacrificially again to the body.6,. In this ritual the severed head represents the sun, the illumination of the universe. In Tantric thought this sun could be understood as the eradicator of the ignorance which prevents release from cyclical existence. The symbolic act of severing one's head signifies the realization that one is not separate from others but part of the great self. However the severing of the head is not the final step, since one must be able to restore one's head to complete the 'sacrifice' which brings immortality. Restoration of the Head Indian mythology has many stories of decapitation and of transposed heads, but few exist of self-decapitation and restoration of the same head. 65 The legends of Chinnamasta and the Mahasiddha sisters are important examples of this unique motif.66 In an article by J. C. Heesterrnan, \"The Case of the Severed Head\", he discusses the Vedic sacrifice-the dismemberment and restoration of a sacrificial victim. His insights can be applied in understanding Chinnamasta's self decapitation and subse-quent restoration. He states: The sacrifice is a cosmos which is violently broken up to be put together again ... lhe constantly alternating movement between the lWo poles of disintegration and reintegration, death and birth .... The pivotal point, however, is that actual death and disintegration have been eliminated.67"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"100 Chinna.masta In Vedic sacrifices the restoration of the head is merely symbolic because the victim is indeed sacrificed; therefore, one wonders why the restoration of the head is included. Sa.t.apa.tha. Br:i.hmai)a., a sacrificial text, terminates with the 'pravargya sacrifice', is L~is statement: And, verily, whosoever either teaches, or partakes of this (Pravargya) enters that life, and that light: the observance of the rule thereof is the same as at the creation.68 This indicates when one receives a new head, a transformation occurs which is usually interpreted as receiving a better head. Courtright states that when GaQ.esa received his elephant head, he received his 'real' one which 'expresses his true nature' .69 One can apply this to Chinnamasta. She illustrates that having the ability to sever one's head and to restore it leads not to death but to immortality. Chinnamasta displays the ultimate; though it appears as a disunity, it is a unity. The Ka.tha Upani~d(2.1.14-15) states: As water rained upon a height nows down in various ways among the hills; so he who views things as varied runs after them. As pure water poured forth into pure becomes the very same, so the self, 0 Gautama, of the seer who has understanding becomes (one with the Supreme). Three Eyes In the sadhanasquoted, only Taranatha's states that ChinnamuQ.Qa has three eyes-right, left, and a centre vertical one frequently referred to as the trlird eye, the eye of transcendent knowledge. Misra's commentary, however, does discuss Chinnamast.a's three eyes and all pictorial illustra-tions depict Chinnamasta/ChinnamuQ.Qi as triocular. Misra comments that these three eyes represent the sun, moon, and fire.70 In the Doctrine of Vibration, Dyczkowski quotes fromAbhinavagupta's Tantraloka as follows: This Wheel of the Absolute (anuttaracakra) flows out from the Heart through the void of the eyes, etc. onto each sense object. The rttys of this Wheel progressively engender the Fire (of the subject), Moon (of the object), and the Sun (of the means of knowledge), in each phrase of destruction, creation, and persistence of the externa1 world.71 In this quote Abhinavagupta speaks of the flowing out of the Absolute through the orifices. In stating this, he indicates that the Absolute can be found in the hean, within an individual, thereby implying that introspec-"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Visualization ofChinnamast3/Chinnamur:u# 101 tion is needed to discover the Absolute. One should not direct the senses to externals, which create the illusion of duality and multiplicity, but withdraw the senses into oneself. This is a continuation of the yogic method propounded in the Upani~ds. The Katha Upani~d(2.1.1) states: The self is not sought through the senses. The Self-caused pierced the openings (of the senses) outward; therefore one looks outward and not within oneself. Some wise person, however, seeking eternal life with his eyes inward, saw the self. 72 The direction of a deity's eyes are important in Hinduism. Diana Eck in Darsan states: The prominence of the eyes of Hindu divine images also reminds us that it is not only the worshipper who sees the deity, but the deity sees the worshipper as well. The contact between devotee and deity is exchanged through the eyes.73 In pictorial representations, Chinnamasta does not look directly at her devotees. By looking at herself, shedirects her devotees to look within themselves. This is a brilliant and profound aspect of Chinnamasta's iconography. Li.kewise in Buddhism, the downward-cast eyes can indicate an em-phasis on introspection. Buddhism does not accept that an atman (a permanent self) can be found within the body but by accepting the l.Jpani~adic yogic method, it does advocate that the yogic process is beneficial in achieving liberation. The third Karmapa, Rangjung Dorje (12H4-1339), comments about the three eyes, \"llecause she is the knower of past, present, and future, she rolls her three furious bloodshot eyes\".14 Trungpa elaborates that having \"three eyes means that nothing escapes the vision ofVajrayoginl\"; furthermore, one can say that she looks down with compassion on all sentient beings_75 As in I Iinduism the third eye located in the centre of the forehead indicates the realization of transcen-dent knowledge which is necessary in order to help beings effectively.'6 In summation both the religious traditions stress that having three eyes as does Chinnamasta, indicates a transcendent knowledge which aids one to liberation. Blood as a Destructive Vital Fluid All four meditations state that Chinnamasta is drinking the blood which is spurting from her severed throat.

The extended mouth and darting tongue are common charac-"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"102 Chinnamasta teristics among several of the Da5a Mahavidyas, such as Kali and Tara. In the Devi Mahatmya episode of Durga' s battle with the Asura Raktablja (lit., blood seed), whenever Durga pierced Asura Raktablja's body and a drop of his blood fell on the ground, immediately another Raktablja appeared ad infinitum. Since any attempt to kill Raktabija had the reverse effect, only generating more Raktabljas, Durga asked Kali and other wrathful manifes-tations (matrkas, etc.) to open their mouths very wide and to drink the blood of Raktablja before it touched the ground. When the goddesses defeated Raktablja through this technique and eventually were trium-phant over all the asuras (rivals to the gods), the devas (gods) reigned again.77 V. S. Agrawala glosses Raktabija's name: The name is significant, viz. the Asura who is born from the seed as churned out of the blood .... Raktablja is the symbol of the physical man. The cosmic blood reservoir of the life principle has the potency of creating a Raktablja from each single drop of blood in its body. If the same is soiled by matter it becomes an Asuric force (8.51) but the Goddess Camur;~c;ia who had made short the work of Cat:tc;ia and Mut:tc;ia sublimates the blood of Raktabija by drinking it herself, that is, making an offering of it to the· sacrificial process symbolized in the body of Kali-Camur;tc;ia. Thus the possibility for evil engrained in the animal blood is exhausted.78 Thus by opening her mouth wide and drinking the blood, the goddess indic~tes her ability to transmute a potentially negatively charged force into a positively-charged force. Agrawala's thesis of sublimation is not ~upponed explicitly by the Hindu meditations of Chinnamasta. No Hindu sadhana states that the blood is amrta (nectar); however, one Buddhist sadhana describes the bloodstream as nectar (nil)srtamrtadhara). 79 Thus this blood, a vital essence of being, has the potential to be destructive if embodied by asuras but conversely can be transformed into a positive power by the Goddess. As Chinnamasta drinks her own blood, it indicates a self-transformation of potential negativity and by internal transmutation, external negativities are also transfonned. Blood as a Beneficial Vital Fluid The Brahmal)asdiscuss the vital fluid; however, it is not always stated that blood is this essence. Since the Bnihmal)as are sacrificial ritual texts, however, we may assume that this vital fluid is blood. As in aforemen-tioned 'pravargya sacrifice' when Vi~l)U was beheaded, the vital sap emerging from his head was wiped up by the gods. Furthermore, in the construction of the Mahavira's pot which ~)'mbolizes Vi~l)u's severed head, in the Satapatha Br.ihmal)a (14.1.2.9), it states:"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Visualization ofChinnamast:i/Chinnamui)Qa 103 0 divine Heaven and Earth, when the sacrifice had its head cut off, its sap flowed away, and entered the sky and the earth ... (14.1.2.19) when the sacrifice had its head cut off, its vital sap flowed away, and therefrom those plants grew up: that vital sap thus supplies and completes it. This vital sap is desired by the gods; it is a part of the sky and the earth; it is a necessary component in a sacrifice and also completes it.80 Noting these different aspects of the vital sap or essential fluid, we understand that transmutation of this vital sap is possible. For the Tantrics, the ultimate transformation is the formation of amrta, the nectar of immortality for the Hindus and the nectar of bliss for the Buddhists. In order to create this transformation, a Tantric practitioner must master pr;irJayama, the manipulations of the subtle winds in the body.81 Pr:irpiyama is a similar process in both the Tantric traditions; however, the results are interpreted differently. In Hinduism, there are five major subtle winds known collectively as pr.i!)a and of the five, two of the most important are the pr.i!)a and apana.82 As long as the subtle winds circulate in the subtle veins (nacjis), the consciousness is preoccupied with the external world because then it 'rides' on the winds. When the conscious-ness travels through the k;la nacji, the consciousness is introverted and when it flows through the pirigala micjithe opposite occurs. These two nacjis, the iga and the pirigala, which are located on the left and right side respectively of the main subtle channel, the SU?Um!)a, create a sense of polarity or duality when pr3.I)a and apana traverse them. The practitioner must excercise retaining her/his breath (kumbhaka) in order to prevent the winds from traversing the two side channels. By retaining the breath, the practitioner forces the subtle winds to enter the SU?UI11l)a at the base of the spine where the ku!)cjalini, hypostatized as a female serpent, 'sleeps'. This kUI)cjalini, \"symholizes cosmic energy; due to the individual's igno-rance the cosmic energy remains powerless and limited, as the individual energy (jiva.5aktD\".83 By ejecting the subtle winds into the base of the StJ?Umpa, the ku!)cjalini is aroused and after arduous practice, the kUI)<;lalini ascends to the fontanelle, the sahasarara cakra, which symbolizes the Supreme Self (paratman). When the practitioner accomplishes this uni-fication, one is released from fetters of cyclic existence and attains immor-tality by uniting with the Par.itman. As Gupta states, \"We can see in the process that symbolically (the practitioner) has reversed the process of creation and effected the reabsorption of the world (and himselO into an undifferentiated unity\". 84 In sum, the blood issuing through the three subtle channels of Chinnamasta can be interpreted as the vital essence in its subtlest form, prti!)a. Furthermore, since Chinnamasta drinks the blood"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"104 Chinnamasta from the central channel, the SlJ$umiJa, this can be interpreted as drinking amrta thereby illustrating to her practitioners that she has achieved the goal, salvation or undifferentiation, through the Tantric method of awak-ening the kur:J(;laliniin order to reunite with the Paratman. In Tantric Buddhism, the technique of pnir)ayama is also applied but the interpretation is different. Moreover, the Buddhist sadhanas (e.g. Taranatha) are explicit in stating that these three channels are the nagis. The /a/ana on the left side of the avadhuti, begins at the left nostril and joins the avadhuti below the navel; it is white, represents the absolute aspect, the corporeal aspect, the objective pole and is symbolized as the moon. The rasana on the right side of the avadhutibegins at the right nostril and joins the avadhuti below the navel; it is red in colour, represents the relative aspect, speech aspect, the subjective pole and is symbolized by the sun. The avadhrltiis the central channel which runs straight from the perineum up the spine to the fontanelle where it arches and terminates between the two eyebrows. This channel is also known \"as the two abandonrnents because gathering the winds into this channel causes the negative activity associated with the winds of the right and left channels to be abandoned\".85 In the biography of Mahasiddha Jalandhara, his teacher who was a gakini said to him, \"Empty the Ia lana and nlsana into the avadhr1ti, then eject all the constructs of your mind through the 'gate of purity' on the crown of your head. Thereafter meditate upon the indivisibility of appearances and emptiness. \"86 In ChinnamuQ.<;iavajrayogini sadhanasthere is mention of the subtle drops, as well as the subtle winds and channels. Taranatha states, \"After the three channels are severed, the white and red drops are mixed in the central channel. .. \".87 In The Clear Light of Bliss a short explanation is given about the white and red drops (Skt. bindu and T. thig-le). The white drop is the pure essence of the white seminal fluid and its principal seat is the crown of the head; the red drop is the pure essence of blood and its principal seat is the navel. There are both gross and subtle forms of these drops. The ones in the vacuole of the central channel found in the heart are the subtle ones while the gross ones flow through other chan-nels. When these drops melt and flow through the channels, they give rise to the experience of bliss. 88 The severing of the three channels and the mixing of the white and red drops are very important in eliminating the notion of duality which creates the erroneous belief of a permanent and unique self. The Tantric Bud-dhists state that while the winds remain in the two channels flanking the central one, one has the sense of duality-subject and object, female and male, etc. This sense of duality creates a polarized tension or a struggle"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Visualization oFChinnamast3/ChinnamWJc;l3 105 for dominance. In the Caryagiti, a collection of realization songs by the great Mahasiddhas, there is a song rich with imagery about duality.89 1. The river of existence (M: the three n:i(iis), fathomless (or frightening) and deep (M: due to the evil of opacity), flows (M: carries urine, excrement, etc.) swiftly; on the banks (/a/ana and rasana) there is mud (M: the evil of opacity), in the middle (avadhuti), no support (M: it cannot be grasped by inexperienced yogins). 2. For the sake of Dharma/dharma Catila builds a bridge (M: oneness of relative and absolute truth); people (M: yogins desiring release), going to the other shore, safely cross over (M: the ocean of Sarpsara). 3. Splitting (M: destroying the grasping at sense-objects of) the tree of delusion (M: bodhicitta), the planks are joined (M: the bodhicitta is united with Perpetual Light); with the strong axe of non-duality (yug:inaddha), Nirval)a is spilt (?). 4. When going on the bridge (M: oneness of the sv:idhi${h:ina and Clear Light), be not on the right or on the left (M: sun or moon); Enlighten-ment (M: the perfection the Great Seal) is near, do not go far! 5. If you, 0 people (M: yogins) are to cross over to the other shore (M: cross the river of the triple false appearance), ask Catila the incompa-rable lord. Though a commentary on this profound song of realization cannot be presented here; a few salient points will be disrussed. The song empha-sizes that the concept of duality sunders reality and prevents recognition of this delusion. Most people, except for experienced yogins, stay on the two mud banks symbolizing this duality. Only the experienced yogin can make the bridge, i.e., manipulate the winds to enter into the avadhiiti, and experience the Great Seal (Mahamudra), or enlightenment. Her Stance In most sadhanas, Chinnamasta stands in either the alfQhapada or the praty:ili<;lhapada stance. 90 The former is the bowman's stance of the right leg lunging forward and slightly bending of the left leg and the latter is the same stance with the reversal of the legs. This bowman's stance indicates that she is prepared to defend her devotees, ready to strike their enemies and be ever vigilant in protecting them. A more esoteric Hindu explanation is that Chinnamasta is ever alert in destroying the internal enemy-ignorance which creates the illusion of separateness between a being and Brahman. Likewise a practitioner must be constantly aware and prepared to strike whenever ignorance dominates and deludes.91 The Mul)c}aka Upani~d states: Taking as the bow the great weapon of the Upani~ds. one should place in it the arrow sharpened by meditation.

Standing on a prostrate Kali, ChinnamuQ.Qa has transcended time and is beyond the dualities of birth and death. Also this symbolizes that a Buddhist deity has supremacy over a Hindu deity and Hinduism. Moreover, a Hindu deity symbolizes the concept of atman, a major tenet refuted by Buddhists. Thus Chinnarntll).Qa is victorious over one of the most deeply-rooted impediments to libera-tion-atmagraha. In contrast Rati and Kama in the Hindu depiction represent the main impetus for creation and the perpetuation of cyclical existence, Sarpsara. Hence by standing on them, Chinnamasta triumphs over the craving for cyclical existence and indicates to her devotees that they, too, must be unaffected by worldly desire in order to attain liberation. D. Kinsley presents another view: Chinnamasli takes life and vigour from the copulating couple, then gives it away lavishly by cutting off her own head to feed her devotees.94 This is a plausible interpretation in Hinduism because the woman on top in a sexual embrace represents Sakti, the power to create.95 This is not applicable in Buddhism because there is no copulating couple under ChinnamuQ.Qa and because woman in Mahayana symbolizes, prajiia, transcendent wisdom. Thus the deities under Chinnamasta' s feet symbol-ize different concepts in the two religions. In Hinduism these concepts are both positive and negative and in Buddhism they are impediments. Dishevelled Hair and Nudity These two characteristics of Chinnamasta are best described as a pair because in this context they represent an abandoning of societal values. Chinnamasta as a yogin knows the relativity of societal values of respect-ability and non-respectability. Poems by the great devotee of Mother Kall, Ramaprasad, poignantly express the rejection of societal values by Kali.

Good grief, haven'l you any shame?97 Also it is not a coincidence that in the Mahabharata Draupadi' s garments and hair were pulled (kesambarak~am); these two aspects indicate a loss of public respectability.98 In Draupadl's case, the pulling of her garments and hair were forced upo;1 her, but in Chinnamasta.'s (or Kall's) her nudity and dishevelled hair represent freedom. Hiltebeitel discusses Draupadi' s dishevelled hair as symbolizing dissolutioi?: \"itself (dishev-elled hair) (is) an image of Kalanitri, the Night of Time, the night of dissolution (pralaya) ofthe universe\".99 Such dissolution also indicates an aspect o( pervasiveness. One of the Sanskrit words for nudity is digambara (lit., clad with the quarters of the sky) symbolizing that Chinnamasta is so pervasive that it is as impossible to cover her as it is to cover the sun. Vast space alone is her vesture.100 In Buddhism, Chinnamu.t)Qa is also a yogin who rejects societal values with her nudity and dishevelled hair. However in Buddhism, where compassion is stressed, her nudity indicates that she is unencumbered by defilements; \"she has no armour of ego to clothe her\".101 By having this realization she can benefit sentient beings and extend absolute compas-sion, indicating that their welfare precedes her own.102 In summation, both the traditions represent Chinnamasta as a yogin and the Buddhist tradition emphasizes the yogin's power to help beings through compas-sionate means. DEITY'S IMPLEMENTS TheKarq-, In both the religions the knife is seen as cutting through major ob-stacles to liberation. With the kartr(sacrificial knife) held in her right hand, Chinnamasta. severs her own head thereby corrunitting a 'self-sacrifice' .103 By this severance she sacrifices the illusory, yet firmly established concept of the individual 'I'. The concept of individual self (atman) must be-severed in order for one to merge with Brahman, becoming liberated. In contradistinction a Buddhist explanation is that this kartr is not a sacrificial knife but a hook of mercy which protects one from falling into either the extreme of cyclic existence (sarpsara) or the quiescient state of Nirval).a. Other interpretations are severing the concept of atmagraha, grasping to a notion of the self or, as Maiijusri's sword destroys ignorance, Chinnamu.t)Qa 's kartr severs the concept of discursive thought, another major impediment to enlightenment.

In Buddhism Chfnnamu.Q.c;la is the jii:ina g:ikini (wisdom 'sky-goer') or sarvabuddha Qakini (all-enlightened 'sky-goer') and in Hinduism Chinnamasta is a mahavidya. Skull Rosary, Bone Necklace, Serpent as Sacred Cord In Hinduism the skull rosary, bone necklace and serpent sacred cord are symbols of transcending the concept of time, i.e., the fear of death. Life and death are human constructions which bind beings to cyclical existence. Chinnamasta is able to fuse these concepts by wearing the symbols of death on an animated body: By this fusion she illustrates that these categories are not absolute and neutralizes their effects, thereby indicating a way to salvation. The serpent as her sacred cord is significant because it is associated with temporality and immortality. Since a serpent has the ability to slough off an old skin without dying, it is a symbol of inunortality. Hy having a serpent as a sacre-d cord, Chinnamast.a indicates that she is not part of the ordinary Hindu class ( vaJ:Qa) system and its obligatory duties. Skull, Five Mudras, Khaf:valiga The Buddhist sadhanas describe Chinnamui).<;ia as holding a skull, having a five-skull tiara, wearing a fifty-skull garland, and holding a kharvariga (Tantrk staff). 10~ The tiara of tlve dried skulls symbolizes the five wisdoms of the Pentad Buddhas (Ak~obhya's mirror-like wisdom, Ratnasambhava's wisdom of equality, Amitabha's discriminative wis-dom, Amoghasiddhi's wisdom of all-accomplishing action, and Vairocana's wisdom of the Dharmadhatu.) The fifty-head-garland represents the fifty completely purified saipSkaras. The five mudrasor five ornaments (head ornament, earrings, necklace, bracelet and anklets, and belt) symbolize the five perfections of giving, morality, patience, perseverance, and medi-tation; the sixth is represented by the female body--insight (prajiia). · Under ChinnamuD¢1 's left arm is a white khatvanga which symbolizes method. The holding of the khatvariga represents ChinnamuD¢1 's union of skilful means (kharvariga) and insight (her body); these two are needed to achieve liberation. The kha{Variga includes many symbols. The three heads topping the khatvariga are respectively a dried skull representing the Dharmakaya, the decaying one for the Sambhogakaya, and there-cently severed one for the Nirma.Q.akaya.105 The eight sides symbolizes the eightfold path propounded by the Buddha.106 DEITY'S A'ITENDANTS In both the traditions Chinnamasta is flanked by two goddesses who, in contrast to Chinnamasta's sixteen years, an indication of maturity and"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Visualization ofChinnamasta/ChinnamUIJ¢i 109 completeness, are twelve years old, symbolizing a transitional phase from immaturity to maturity. Their names vary according to the sadhanas. In some Buddhist sadhanas the goddess flanking ChinnamuQ.<;la' s left is green Vajravaral)..iru and the one on her right is yellow VajravairocanL Mahidhara does not indicate their colour, age, or position but refers to them as l)akini and VarQ.ini; in the Tantrasara 's sadhana the one on Chinnamasra 's left side is the black :Oakini and on the right side the red Varl)..iru. Though the two traditions do not agree on the names, both agree there is a triad with the central figure as the main deity flanked by two attendants depicted in different colors. In the sed ion on blood symbolism, the three channels emiling blood from Chinnamasta symbolize the three subtle channels (miCJis). This symbolism is reiterated by the hypostatization oft he three nac)is as the three goddesses. In Buddhist terms, the rasana is hypostatized Vajravara-!fini, the fa/ami as Vajravairocani, and the avadhutias ChinnamuQ.<;la; in Hindu terms the i¢i is hypostatized as l)akini, the pi riga/a as Varl)..ini, and the .su~umna as Chinnamasta.106a This is further demonstrated by the way the three goddesses stand; they are inter-locked with each other at their feet just as the three subtle channels are connected at the navel cakra. Though each one's body is free-standing and not intertwined with the oth~r's, the two attendants drink the blood issuing from Chinnamasta's severed throat thereby indicating their dependence on Chinnamasta. As the two side subtle channels do not become separated from the central ~ubtle channel until the yogin can manipulate the ~btle wind-; in entering and remaining in the central subtle channel, the two attendants cannot become independent until they reach yogic maturity. A mature or adept yogin knows how to manipulate these subtle winds so they enter the central channel. By accomplishing this: the dichotomy of subject and object is eradicated and the relativity of duality is realized. For instance, if there is a subject, then there must be an object; if there is a night, then there must be a day; if there is a left, then there must be a right. All these divisions are dependent on each other for definition. Chinnamasta's two attendants are described in various terms indicating duality. In the Buddhist sadhanas the two attendants have diffcrt:nt names, different colors and mirror each other in the way they stand. In the Hindu sadhanasthe differences are more pronounced. Van:tini is red, has a smiling face, and a fiery splendour; whereas l)akini is black and exceedingly frightful to behold. Moreover in all the sadhanas, the atten-dants have their heads intact which indicate that they do not have the yogic ability to sever their heads; this represents the clinging to an 'I' concept. 107 The delusion of duality is iterated by their drinking of"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"110 Chinnamasta. Chinnamasta's blood. Hence in both the traditions the two attendants represent an spiritually 'immature' person who is not liberated because she has not realized the relativity of duality. Another way to interpret Chinnamasta and her two attendants accord-ing to the Hindu conception is presented by Misra. He states that Van:Uru or Y ogini represents the rajas gu!)a, Oakin1 or Bhogin1 represents the tamas gu!)a, and Chinnamasta represents the sattva gU!)a.108 According to The Doctrine of Vibration, an excerpt from the Spanadani17J.aya by ~maraja: \"that liberated soul recognizes that these three (gu!)as) are natural and uncreated powers of pure consciousness.\"109 He continues to elaborate that (1) sattva corresponds to Sankara's (Siva's) power of knowledge (jnana)-the light of consciousness (praka5a); (2) the rajas to the power of action (kriya)-the reflective awareness of consciousness ( vimar5a); (3) the camas to the power of Maya ... the initial subtle distinc-tion which appears between subject and object in pure consciousness. This explanation demonstrates a liberated soul'srecognition of the inter-action of the three guT} as. Since Chinnamasta is in the centre, drinking her own blcx.>d and feeding_ her blood to her two attendants, she indicates that she is a liberated soul whereas her two attendants are not liberated because they drink her blood instead of their own. In other words, Chinnamast.a has severed the notion of duality while the others have not. The~ interpretations ofChinnamasta's location, physical appearance, and attendants are certainly not exhaustive. Though more interpretations could be presented, I highlighted the symbolism of the navel, fire, triangle, head, blood and attendants which demonstrates Chinnamasta' s centrality as a Tantric goddess. Furthermore these aspects clearly show that to comprehend her, one needs to incorporate many facets of the Indian tradition which are explicitly esoteric or have been adapted for the esoteric Indian traditions, such as the Upani~dic ''inheritance\". One can see how Hindu or Buddhist tenets are embedded in the hermeneutics of the iconography. Differences between the two religion's beliefs are apparent: atman as opposed to the lack of an eternal self, the gU!)as versus dharmoda ya as source, and self-liberation versus the motivation of bodhicitta. However, what is also striking is the commonality of certain techniques in both Hindu and Buddhist Tantric traditions, e.g. the manipulation of the subtle winds in the subtle channels. This knowledge of manipulating the winds is one of the major Tantric methods employed to experience bliss and eventual liberation. By using the tantric lens, one learns that Chinnamasta and her two attendants not only represent the three subtle channels but reveal a"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"Visualization ofChinnamasta/ChinnamUI)<;/i 111 profound tantric teaching of liberation. It is a masterful illustration of the interaction of the three subtle channels and the manipulation of the winds entering the central channel. Tantric adepts frequently used drawings to convey the subtlest teachings. Chinnamasta is certainly one of these mahayoginis. Thus this great yogini, the texts that discuss her, and her iconography distinctly demonstrate her importance in the Indian and Tibetan esoteric traditions and in understanding the great goddess tradi-tion which has influenced the entire Asian continent as well as more and more Western scholars in this century and certainly in the next century.

What does she syrr.bolize? What teaching does she embody? To answer these questions I have studied her legendc;, rituals, and iconography from both a Hindu and Buddhist perspective. Certain themes are reiterated in both the tradition~; other aspects are elaborated more in one tradition only. Both the traditions are concerned with the yogic/tantric method as a symbol of personal ~ublimation. Many of her legends c:xemplify the yogic/Tantric technique of severing the he-ad temporarily. As has. been examined Chinnam:1sta's various legends, ritua Is and iconography, demonstrate that that Chinnarnasta is pre-eminently a Tantric goddess. Since she is a Tantric goddes,\", there are certain ger!.crahtics that can be deduced concerning her symbolism, and the similarities and differences betv;cen Hjndu and Bud-dhist Tar.tra. Although the origin ofTantra is embedded in Hinduism <J.nd Buddhism, interest m the field of Tantra's origin and the relationship between Hindu and Buddhist Tantric adepts is relatively recent. Tantra, as an csowric teaching, was originally an oral traditjon which later became written. Relying primarily on textual sources, it becomes problematic to compare two different types of texts to determ:ne Chinnam~sta's origin. The Buddhist textual5ources are sadhanaswith transmission lineages and ihe llindu texts are specifically literary ones, such as the UpapuriitJaS. In both the traditions Chinnamasta is considered a wic;dom goddess, a goddess who has the wisdom necessary for liberation. According to Buddhist Tantric symcolism the female symtx)lizes transcendental wis-dom (prajna) and the inanimate aspect in comparison to the male sym-bolism of compassion and active method. In Buddhism she is a form of Vajravanihi/Vajrayogini, a goddess exemplifying prajna and is connected with more female Mah.asiddhas than male Mahasiddhas. This is reiterated in the Buddhist legends of Chinnamui)Qa; swordc; of wisdom emerge from practitioners' mouths before they enact severing their heads. In Hindu Tantra this symbolism is reversed in that the female represents activity (5aktJ) and the male represents inactivity. Moreover the vivid imagery of 'swords of wisdom' is absent in the Hindu legend-;. Still, Chinnamasta is dearly a wisdom goddess by her association with Durga as one of the ten"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"118 Gninnamast.a great knowledge goddesses (da.sa mahavidyas). One may speculate th2t the reason for a lack of evidence in Hinduism for explaining why Chinnamasta is a wisdom goddess i~ that she was borrowed from Bud-dhism which stresses goddesses as wisdom-holders rather than as .{aktis. In this comparative study, the commonality between llindu and Bud-dhist Tantric beliefs is evident. An important concept accepted by both Tantric traditions is the system of subtle winds, channels, and cakras in the human body. Each agret~ that there are two primary subtle winds, prapa and apana, which ascend and descend respectively in the two subtle channds which intertwine with the central subtle channel. At the places of conjunction is a t.akra which acts as a knot. As long as the two side channels remain thus intertwined, the subtle winds cannot\" enter the central channel or ascend and descend it freely. An ordinary person is unable to 'untie the knots' and as long as the two subtk winds do not course in the central channel without constriction, one expenences a separation from others. This sense of separation or apparent dichotomy appears to be absolute until the two subtle winds enter the central subtle channel. For an ordinary person the converging of the winds occurs at the time of death. A yogin or Tantric practitioner tries to simulate Lhe death experience in ordu to realize the relativity of all dualities and to be free from the snares of cyclic existence. Chinnarnasta's legends reiterate the theme of cutting through this apparent duality. Most legends fc)cus on the salient act of her seve:-ring t~mporarily her head. No iegend indicates a suicide or a loss of control; quite the contrary, all legends portray her as an adept in the yogic/Tantric technique of 'untying the knots'. Were she not an adept yogin, blood could not ascend and flow freely from her severed head; she would have died and certainly could not have replaced her head. Chinnamasta thus embodies the realization of severing duality. This liberative knowledge is the raison d'ctJ·cofTantra. Since this is the essence ofTantra, any deity who teaches this technique is a Tantric deity. Many sadhanasofvarious deities do instruct the practitinner in methods of tra11scending dualism; however, few deities exemplify this technique in their iconography. Chinnamasta and her two attendants is the mo.\"t notable example. Her iconography intentionally overwhelms the viewer. The paradox of her living form with head in hand arrcfits our rational thought and forestalls a facile or hasty interpretation. It purposely creates uncertainty. It also obscures because one who does not know her sadhanas c.annot under-stand that her decapitation is temporary. Without knowledge of this key factor, one can never penetrate the apparent paradox. Since Tantra is fraught with dangerous methods which could make a"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"Condusion 119 person insane without the guidance of an adept teacher, it constantly veils its instructions. Chinnama~t.a's iconography communicates this concern. To an ordi-nary viewer, Chinnamasta is decapitated and to some, she is dead. For a Tantric practitioner, however, her iconography is a supreme example of the interaction of the subtle winds and channels. Her two anendant') are the two side subtle channels and Chinnarnasta is the central subtle chan-nel. The knots are untied and the winds appearing as biood ascend the unconstricted subtle channels. 1he triad representc; the three ~ubtle chan-neis at the navel cakra which is their abode-the pivotal point for liberation. This magnified depiction of something invisible to ordinary perception is this extraordinary vision which is aweful and fascinating. One is privy to an experience reserve-d normally foryoginsorTantric adeprs. Chinnamasta reveals the Tantric technique of liberation without word<;; her i< ·onography is her code. Those who can decipher it can be freed fn >m cyclic existence. For this reason, Chinnamasta is a paramount Tantric deity in both Bud-dhism and llinduism. Though Buddhist and Hindu Tantra share some common elements, other explanations and emphases differ within the two traditions. The Hindu tradition does not have the same system of classification as the Buddhist tradition. The Buddhist Chinnamut).Qa sadhanasarc part of the Anuttarayoga Mother 1 antra which stresses bliss and the realization of voidness of inherent existence in order to experience the supreme state of reality. In the Chinnamui).qa sadhanas a practitioner must vividly imagine him/herself as Chinnamui).Qa. A Buddhist practitioner who has Chinnamui).<;ia as hic;/her chosen deity O.Jtadcvat.i) should arise in the morning as ChinnamuQ<;ia. Moreover if one practises the uncommon preliminaries, one imagines one's body, speech, and mind as inseparable and as ·of one taste' with the body, speech, and mind of the guru. In this way, one experiences great bliss. The Dalai Lama states and explains the 'dissolution process of enurety' which is a visualization of one's entire body melting into light and completely dissolving. One then visualizes oneself as the enjoyment body (sambhogakaya) and subsequently as Chinnamui).qa generating the pride of the emanation body. (Although he di~cusses this in the context ofYamanataka practice, not ChinnamUQ.Qci practice, both are Anuttarayoga Tantric practices and L'-le same principles apply.) This powerful and continuous visualization process aid-; a prac-titioner in understanding ChinnamUQQa' s symbolism of liminal transcen-dence. The separateness of life and death or any seemingly mutually exclusive concepts are understood as relative rather than absolute di-chotomies."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"120 Chinnamast3. When comparing the Chinnamasta,'ChinnamUQQa sadhanas, one finds that in both the traditions they consist of three main sections: prelimina-ries, actual meditation, and offerings. In both, preliminaries include homage to one's guru and chosen deity, purification and consecration of one's body. The Hindu practice has an extensive purification and consecration compared to the Buddhist prac-tice; however, only the Buddhist practice includes taking refuge in the Three jewels, generating lxxlhidtta, and cultivating the four immeasurables aiways coupled with the insight of voidness of inherent existence. The actual meditation of both involves the worship of Chinnamasta/ ChinnamuQQa. The Hindu practitioner visualizes Chinnamasta in front of him/her, whiie the Buddhist prt~.ctitioner visualizes him/herself as Chinnamur:lC)a. The offering sections of both are simHar, but only the Buddhist practice concludes with a dedication of merit. Thus we note both stJ iking similarities as well as significant differences between the two Tamric traditions. Chinnamasta is a paramount Tantric goddess who inspires awe and fascination and gives us a focus for the comparative study of two transformative traditions."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"APPENDIXJ The Thousand Names of the Goddess Sri Devi speaks: Tell, Deva Mahadev~, you are the best among who knows the Siistras.

Certainly this should be kept secret i\\nyone who worships the goddess in the following way: for six months at midnight a devotee with loose hair recites (man--tras) and performs the worship with the repetition of the thousand names; (this devotee) will attain knowledge and siddlus(supernatural abilities). The goddess controls everyone and creates delusion. She seizes the power of the gods and defeats enemies. Enemies become servants, evil is de-stroyed, and death is destroyed by reciting and knowing (the 1000 names). By praising with purity all siddhison earth (will be obtained). This secret should not be revealed to others. With certainty after wearing amuletc; great siddhis will be obtained. The great Goddess has no knowledge ( vidyas) better than this.121 If one recites this once, all good siddhis will appear. Listen to the results by adoring and redting on Tuesday or Friday, the eighth day of waning moon, change in constellation, or on full moon. After reciting the 108 (names), reciting the ¢ousand names with devotion and after praising the great Goddess, all sins will be eliminated, one will be freed from all sins, and one will obtain control of all the siddhis. If for three months on the eighth day at midnight at the crossroads, a clean person offers from one's left side bali with the recitation of the thousand names, one becomes unconquerable, beautiful, strong, and brave. If one worships a virgin with the recitation of the mantras, one will obtain all the siddhis. I have told you, DC\\oi, all the siddhisyou can obtain. After reciting the pra!ses of the great goddess, you will be rdeased from all sins. All gods do obeisance to the Goddess. Do not tell this to anyone. You should keep this secret and protect this from ones who cannot understand. This is the entire powerful reason for praising and reciting.
