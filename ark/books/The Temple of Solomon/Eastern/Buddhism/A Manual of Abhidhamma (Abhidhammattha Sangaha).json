In it, man is described as a psycho-physical beingconsisting of both mind and matter, and it gives a micro-scopic analysis of the human being.Abhidhamma explains the process of birth and deathin detail. In addition to defining consciousness, it alsoanalyses and classifies thoughts mainly from an ethicalstandpoint. Various types of consciousness are also setforth in detail, as they arise through the six sense-doors.Modern psychology has begun to acknowledge that itcomes within the scope of Abhidhamma for the reason thatit deals with the mind, with thoughts, thought-processes,and mental states. Buddhism has, from the very beginning,taught psychology without a psyche.Abhidhamma also helps the student of Buddhism tofully comprehend the Anatta (No-Soul) doctrine whichforms the crux of Buddhism. To a person who reads thisbook in a superficial manner, Abhidhamma appears as dryas dust, but to the wise truth-seekers, it is an indispensableguide as well as an intellectual treat. The reader who readsthis book with deep thinking cannot fail to find it withplenty of food for thought and which will help him tremen-dously to increase his wisdom so essential for leading anideal Buddhist way of life, and the realization of UltimateTruth, Nibbàna."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"ivThe Author, the late Venerable Nàrada Mahà Thera,was a well-known Buddhist Missionary from Sri

It expounds the quintessence of His pro-found doctrine.The Dhamma, embodied in the Sutta Piñaka, is theconventional teaching (vohàra desanà), and the Abhi-dhamma is the ultimate teaching (paramattha desanà).In the Abhidhamma both mind and matter, whichconstitute this complex machinery of man, are microscop-ically analysed. Chief events connected with the process ofbirth and death are explained in detail. Intricate points ofthe Dhamma are clarified. The Path of Emancipation is setforth in clear terms.Modern Psychology, limited as it is, comes within thescope of Abhidhamma inasmuch as it deals with the mind,with thoughts, thought-processes, and mental states, but itdoes not admit of a psyche or a soul. Buddhism teaches apsychology without a psyche.It one were to read the Abhidhamma as a moderntextbook on psychology, one would be disappointed. Noattempt has here been made to solve all the problems thatconfront a modern psychologist.Consciousness is defined. Thoughts are analysed andclassified chiefly from an ethical standpoint All mentalstates are enumerated. The composition of each type ofconsciousness is set forth in detail. The description of"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"xthought-processes that arise through the five sense doorsand the mind-door is extremely interesting. Such a clearexposition of thought-processes cannot be found in anyother psychological treatise.Bhavaïga and Javana thought-moments, which areexplained only in the Abhidhamma, and which have noparallel in modern psychology, are of special interest to aresearch student in psychology.That consciousness flows like a stream, a view pro-pounded by some modern psychologists like WilliamJames, becomes extremely clear to one who understandsthe Abhidhamma. It must be added that an Abhidhammastudent can fully comprehend the Anattà (No-soul) doc-trine, the crux of Buddhism, which is important both froma philosophical and an ethical standpoint.The advent of death, process of rebirth in variousplanes without anything to pass from one life to another,the evidentially verifiable doctrine of Kamma and Rebirthare fully explained.Giving a wealth of details about mind, Abhidhammadiscusses the second factor of man-matter or råpa. Funda-mental units of matter, material forces, properties of mat-ter, source of matter, relationship of mind and matter, aredescribed.In the Abhidhammattha Saïgaha there is a briefexposition of the Law of Dependent Origination, followedby a descriptive account of the Causal Relations whichfinds no parallel in any other philosophy."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"xiA physicist should not delve into Abhidhamma to geta thorough knowledge of physics.It should be made clear that Abhidhamma does notattempt to give a systematised knowledge of mind andmatter. It investigates these two composite factors of so-called being to help the understanding of things as theytruly are. A philosophy has been developed on these lines.Based on that philosophy an ethical system has beenevolved to realise the ultimate goal, Nibbàna.As Mrs. Rhys Davids rightly says, Abhidhamma dealswith “(1) What we find (a) within us (b) around us and of(2) what we aspire to find.”In Abhidhamma all irrelevant problems that intereststudents and scholars, but having no relation to one’sDeliverance, are deliberately set aside.The Abhidhammattha Saïgaha, the authorship ofwhich is attributed to venerable Anuruddha Thera, anIndian monk of Kanjeevaram (Kà¤cipura), gives an epit-ome of the entire Abhidhamma Piñaka. It is still the mostfitting introduction to Abhidhamma. By mastering thisbook, a general knowledge of Abhidhamma may easily beacquired.To be a master of Abhidhamma all the seven books,together with commentaries and sub-commentaries, haveto be read and re-read patiently and critically.Abhidhamma is not a subject of fleeting interestdesigned for the superficial reader.To the wise truth-seekers, Abhidhamma is an indis-"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"xiipensable guide and an intellectual treat. Here there is foodfor thought to original thinkers and to earnest studentswho wish to increase their wisdom and lead an ideal Bud-dhist life.However, to the superficial, Abhidhamma must appearas dry as dust.It may be questioned, “Is Abhidhamma absolutelyessential to realise Nibbàna, the summum bonum of ‘Bud-dhism,’ or even to comprehend things as they truly are?”Undoubtedly Abhidhamma is extremely helpful tocomprehend fully the word of the Buddha and realise Nib-bàna, as it presents a key to open the door of reality. Itdeals with realities and a practical way of noble living,based on the experience of those who have understoodand realised. Without a knowledge of the Abhidhammaone at times finds it difficult to understand the real signif-icance of some profound teachings of the Buddha. Todevelop Insight (Vipassanà) Abhidhamma is certainly veryuseful.But one cannot positively assert that Abhidhamma isabsolutely necessary to gain one’s Deliverance.Understanding or realisation is purely personal(sandiññhika).

In an ultimate sense the apparent sur-face consists of forces and qualities or, in other words,vibrations.For ordinary purposes a scientist would use the termwater, but in the laboratory he would say H2O. In the sameway the Buddha in the Sutta Piñaka resorts to conventionalusage such as man, woman, being, self, etc., but in theAbhidhamma Piñaka He adopts a different mode of expres-sion. Here He employs the analytical method and usesabstract terms such as aggregates (Khandha), elements(Dhàtu), bases (âyatana), etc.The word paramattha is of great significance in Abhi-dhamma. It is a compound formed of parama and attha.Parama is explained as immutable (aviparãta), abstract(nibbaññita); attha means thing. Paramattha, therefore,means immutable or abstract thing. Abstract reality maybe suggested as the closest equivalent. Although the termimmutable is used here it should not be. understood thatall paramatthas are eternal or permanent.A brass vessel, for example, is not Paramattha. Itchanges every moment and may be transmuted into avase. Both these objects could be analysed and reducedinto fundamental material forces and qualities, which, inAbhidhamma, are termed Råpa Paramatthas.

Nibbàna is supra-mundane. The former is composed of Nàma and Råpa.According to Abhidhamma “Råpa” connotes both funda-mental units of matter and material changes as well. Assuch Abhidhamma enumerates 28 species of matter. Thesewill be dealt with in a subsequent chapter. “Nàma” denotesboth consciousness and mental states. The second chapterof this book deals with such mental states (Cetasikas)which are 52 in number. One of these is “Vedanà” (feeling).Another is “Sa¤¤à” (perception). The remaining 50 are col-lectively called “Saïkhàra”. (mental states).

The other three are called realities in thatthey are things that exist (vijjamàna dhammà). Besides,they are irreducible, immutable, and abstract things. Theydeal with what is within us and around us.The first Paramattha or reality is Citta.7 It is derivedfrom the root “citi”, to think. According to the commentaryCitta is that which is aware of (cinteti = vijànàti) anobject. It is not that which thinks of an object as the termimplies. From an Abhidhamma standpoint Citta may bet-ter be defined as the awareness of an object, since there isno agent like a soul.Citta, Ceta, Cittuppàda, Nàma, Mana, Vi¤¤àõa areall used as synonymous terms in Abhidhamma. Hencefrom the Abhidhamma standpoint no distinction is madebetween mind and consciousness. When the so-calledbeing is divided into its two constituent parts, Nàma(mind) is used. When it is divided into five aggregates(Pa¤cakkhandha), Vi¤¤àõa is used. The term Citta isinvariably employed while referring to different classes ofconsciousness. In isolated cases, in the ordinary sense ofmind, both terms Citta and Mana are frequently used.7.Mr. Aung writes in his introduction to the Compendium, p. 2. “ The Grammarian’s definition of the term Citta (mind) is àrammaõaü cinteti’ti cittaü (thought = thinking of an object). Here the word cinteti is used in its most comprehensive sense of vijànàti (to know). Mind is then ordinarily defined as that which is conscious of an object. From this definition we get our definition of Vi¤¤àõa (consciousness). Consciousness may therefore be tentatively defined as the relation between àrammaõika (subject) and àrammaõa (object).” See Compendium p. 234. There is no reason why such a distinction should be made between Citta and Vi¤¤àõa."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"25The other three Paramatthas will be dealt with intheir due places.(Catubbidha-Cittàni)The Four Classes of Consciousness§ 3.

With respect to its nature it divides itself intofour classes. Some types of consciousness are immoral(Akusala), because they spring from attachment (lobha).aversion or illwill (pañigha), and ignorance (moha).Opposed to them are the moral types of consciousness (Kus-ala), because they are rooted in non-attachment or gener-osity (alobha), goodwill (adosa), and wisdom (amoha).The former are unwholesome as they produce undesirableeffects (aniññha vipàka), the latter are wholesome as theyproduce desirable effects (iññha vipàka). Both Kusala andAkusala Cittas constitute what, in Pàli, are termed Kamma.Those types of consciousness that arise as the inevitableresults of these Kusala and Akusala Cittas are called Vipàka(resultant) Cittas. It should be understood that bothKamma and Vipàka are purely mental. The fourth type ofconsciousness is called Kiriya which, for want of a betterterm, is rendered by “karmically ineffective”, “inoperative”or “functional”."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"319.Three Roots (Måla)Lobha, dosa, and moha are the three roots of evil. Theiropposites are the roots of good.Lobha, from √ lubh, to cling, or attach itself, maybe rendered by ‘attachment’ or ‘clinging’. Some scholarsprefer ‘greed’. Craving is also used as an equivalent oflobha.In the case of a desirable object of sense, there arises,as a rule, clinging or attachment. In the case of an undesir-able object, ordinarily there is aversion.In Pàli such aversion is termed dosa or pañigha. Dosais derived from √ dus, to be displeased. Pañigha isderived from ‘pañi’, against, and √ ‘gha’ (han), to strike,to contact. Illwill, hatred are also suggested as equivalentsof ‘pañigha’.Moha is derived from √ muh, to delude. It is delu-sion, stupidity, bewilderment. It is ‘moha’ that clouds anobject and blinds the mind. Sometimes ‘moha’ is renderedby ignorance.According to the Abhidhamma, moha is common to allevil. Lobha and dosa do not arise alone, but always in com-bination with moha. Moha, on the other hand, does arisesingly—hence the designation ‘momåha’, intense delusion.Diametrically opposed to the above three roots arethe roots of Kusala. They not only indicate the absence ofcertain evil conditions, but also signify the presence of cer-tain positive good conditions. Alobha does not merely"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"32mean non-attachment, but also generosity. Adosa does notmerely mean non-anger or non-hatred, but also goodwill,or benevolence, or loving-kindness (mettà). Amoha doesnot merely mean non-delusion, but also wisdom or know-ledge (¤àõa or pa¤¤à).10. Vedanà or FeelingFeeling or, as some prefer to say, sensation, is a mental statecommon to all types of consciousness. Chiefly there arethree kinds of feelings—namely, ‘somanassa’ (pleasurable),‘domanassa’ (displeasurable), and ‘upekkhà’ (indifferent,neutral, equanimity or neither pleasurable nor displeasur-able). With ‘dukkha’ (physical pain) and ‘sukha’ (physicalhappiness) there are altogether five kinds of feelings.Somanassa is an abstract noun formed of ‘su’, good,and ‘mana’, mind. Literally, the term means good-minded-ness, i.e., a pleasurable feeling. Similarly ‘domanassa’ (‘du’,bad, and ‘mana’, mind) means bad-mindedness, i.e., a dis-pleasurable feeling. The third feeling is neutral. Indiffer-ence is used here in this particular sense, but not in thesense of callousness. Sukha is composed of ‘su’, easy, and‘kha’ to bear, or to endure. What is easily endured is ‘sukha’i.e., happiness. Dukkha (du, difficult), pain, is that which isdifficult to be endured. Both these sensations are physical.According to Abhidhamma there is only one type of con-sciousness accompanied by pain, and one accompanied byhappiness.

Diññhi—This term is derived from √ ‘dis’, to see, to perceive. It isusually translated as view, belief, opinion, etc. When qual-ified by ‘sammà’, it means right view or right belief; whenqualified by ‘micchà’, it means wrong view or wrong belief.Here the term is used without any qualification in thesense of wrong view.12. Saïkhàrika—This is purely a technical term used in a specific sense inthe Abhidhamma. It is formed of ‘saü’, well and √‘kar’,to do, to prepare, to accomplish. Literally, it means accom-plishing, preparing, arranging.Like Dhamma, Saïkhàra also is a multisignificantterm.

Prompted bywhatever motive, one, as a rule, kills with a thought of ill-will. Where there is illwill (pañigha) there is displeasure(domanassa). Where there is displeasure there is illwill ina subtle or gross way.Suppose, for instance, a little child, who cannot dis-criminate between right and wrong, smilingly kills an ant.He does not know that he is committing the evil of killing.He is only playing with it. Now, does he cherish any illwilltowards the ant? Is there any hatred or ill-feeling in hiscase? It is difficult to say so. What type of consciousnessdoes he experience at that moment? It cannot be the 9thand 10th types because he innocently does it with joy, fon-dling the object.

Ifone reflects on the meaning of the term pañigha, theanswer will become clear. There is no doubt a subtle kindof aversion over the unpleasant news. It is the same in thecase of a person who weeps over the death of a dear one,because it is an unwelcome event. Anàgàmãs and Arahantsnever feel sorry nor grieve, because they have eradicatedpañigha or dosa (hatred or illwill.)Great was the lamentation of venerable ânanda, whowas a Sotàpanna Saint, on the passing away of theBuddha; but Arahants and Anàgàmãs like venerable Kass-apa and Anuruddha, practised perfect equanimity withoutshedding a tear.20.

Like the root of a tree is Hetu.Paccaya is like water, manure, etc.The aforesaid eighteen classes of consciousness arecalled ‘A-hetuka’ because they are devoid of ‘concomitantHetus’ (sampayuttaka hetu). It must be understood thateven Ahetuka Cittas are not devoid of an efficient cause(nibbattaka hetu). The remaining 71 classes of conscious-ness are called Sa-hetuka, with Roots.

Thought-Process—The subject, the consciousness, receives objects fromwithin and without. When a person is in a state of pro-found sleep his mind is said to be vacant, or, in otherwords, in a state of Bhavaïga. We always experience sucha passive state when our minds do not respond to externalobjects. This flow of Bhavaïga is interrupted when objectsenter the mind. Then the Bhavaïga consciousnessvibrates for one thought-moment and passes away. There-upon the sense-door consciousness (Pa¤cadvàràvajjana)arises and ceases. At this stage the natural flow is checkedand is turned towards the object. Immediately after therearises and ceases the eye-consciousness18 (CakkhuVi¤¤àõa), but yet knows no more about it. This senseoperation is followed by a moment of reception of theobject so seen (Sampañicchana). Next comes the investi-gating faculty (Santãraõa)19 or a momentary examinationof the object so received. After this comes that stage ofrepresentative cognition termed the determining con-sciousness (Votthapana). Discrimination is exercised atthis stage. Freewill plays its part here. Immediately afterthere arises the psychologically most important stage—Impulsion or Javana. It is at this stage that an action isjudged whether moral or immoral. Kamma is performedat this stage; if viewed rightly (yoniso manasikàra), the18.i. e., if the object is a form (råpa).

The wholeprocess which happens in an infinitesimal part of timeends with the registering consciousness (Tadàlambana),lasting for two thought-moments—thus completing onethought-process at the expiration of seventeen thought-moments.20The three kinds of Bhavaïga consciousness areVipàka.

Råpàvacara—There are three planes of existence — namely, SensuousSphere (Kàmaloka), Form-Sphere (Råpaloka), and Formless-Sphere (Aråpaloka). The four states of misery (Apàya),human realm (Manussa), and the six celestial realms (Deva-loka) constitute the Kàmaloka. It is so called because sense-desires play a predominant part in this sphere. The four statesof misery are called Duggati (evil states). Evil-doers are bornin such states. The remaining seven are called Sugati (goodstates). The good are born in these states of sensuous bliss.The more evolved persons, who seek no delight inordinary sense-desires, but are interested in higher spirit-ual progress, must naturally be born in congenial places inharmony with their lofty aspirations. Even in the humanrealm it is they who retire to solitude and engage them-selves in meditation.Such meditation (Bhàvanà) is of two kinds—Samatha(concentration) and Vipassanà (insight).

With theaid of Jhànas one could develop higher psychic powers(Abhi¤¤à). It is Vipassanà that leads to Enlightenment.Those who develop Jhànas are born after death inhigher Form-Spheres (Råpaloka) and Formless-Spheres(Aråpaloka).In the Formless-Spheres there is no body but onlymind. As a rule, both mind and body are interrelated,interdependent, and inseparable. But by will-power thereis a possibility for the mind to be separated from the bodyand vice versa temporarily. Beings born in celestial realmsand Form-Spheres are supposed to possess very subtlematerial forms.The Compendium of Philosophy states that “Råpa-loka is so called because the subtle residuum of matter issaid, in that place of existence, to be still met with. Aråpa-loka is so called because no trace of matter is held to befound in it.”That which frequents the Råpa Sphere is Råpà-vacara. There are fifteen cittas pertaining to it. Five areKusalas, which one can develop in this life itself. Five aretheir corresponding Vipàkas which are experienced afterdeath in the Råpa-Sphere. Five are Kriyà cittas, which areexperienced only by Buddhas and Arahants either in thislife or by Arahants in the Råpa-Sphere.37.

This object is calledParikamma Nimitta—preliminary object.He now intently concentrates on this object until hebecomes so wholly absorbed in it that all adventitiousthoughts get ipso facto excluded from the mind. A stage isultimately reached when he is able to visualise the objecteven with closed eyes. On this visualised image (Uggahanimitta) he concentrates continuously until it developsinto a conceptualised image (Pañibhàga nimitta).As an illustration let us take the Pathavi Kasiõa.A circle of about one span and four inches in diameteris made and the surface is covered with dawn-coloured clayand smoothed well. If there be not enough clay of the dawncolour, he may put in some other kind of clay beneath.This hypnotic circle is known as the Parikamma Nim-itta. Now he places this object about two and half cubitsaway from him and concentrates on it, saying mentally orinaudibly—Pañhavi or earth. The purpose is to gain theone-pointedness of the mind. When he does this for sometime—perhaps weeks, or months, or years—he would beable to close his eyes and visualise the object. This visual-"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"67ised object is called Uggaha Nimitta. Then he concentrateson this visualised image, which is an exact mental replicaof the object, until it develops into a conceptualised imagewhich is called Pañibhàga Nimitta.The difference between the first visualised image andthe conceptualised image is that in the former the fault ofthe device appears, while the latter is clear of all suchdefects and is like a “well-burnished conch shell.” Thelatter possesses neither colour nor form. “It is just a modeof appearance, and is born of perception.”As he continually concentrates on this abstract con-cept he is said to be in possession of “proximate concentra-tion” (Upacàra samàdhi) and the innate five Hindrances toprogress (Nãvaraõa), such as sense-desire (Kàmacchanda),hatred (Pañigha), sloth and torpor (Thãna-Middha), rest-lessness and brooding (Uddhacca-Kukkucca,) and doubts(Vicikicchà) are temporarily inhibited.Eventually he gains “ecstatic concentration” (AppanàSamàdhi) and becomes enwrapt in Jhàna, enjoying thecalmness and serenity of a one-pointed mind.As he is about to gain Appanà Samàdhi a thoughtprocess runs as follows:Bhavaïga, Manodvàràvajjana, Parikamma, Upacàra,Anuloma, Gotrabhå, Appanà.♦♦♦♦When the stream of consciousness is arrested, there arisesthe Mind-door consciousness taking for its object the Pati-bhàga Nimitta. This is followed by the Javana process"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"68which, as the case may be, starts with either Parikamma orUpacàra. Parikamma is the preliminary or initial thought-moment. Upacàra means proximate, because it is close tothe Appanà Samàdhi. It is at the Anuloma or “adaptation”thought-moment that the mind qualifies itself for the finalAppanà. It is so called because it arises in conformity withAppanà. This is followed by Gotrabhå, the thought-momentthat transcends the Kàma-plane. Gotrabhå means thatwhich subdues (bhå) the Kàma-lineage (Gotra). All thethought-moments of this Javana process up to the Gotrabhåmoment are Kàmàvacara thoughts. Immediately after thistransitional stage of Gotrabhå there arises only for a dura-tion of one moment the Appanà thought-moment that leadsto ecstatic concentration. This consciousness belongs to theRåpa-plane, and is termed the First Råpa Jhàna. In the caseof an Arahant it is a Kriyà citta, otherwise it is a Kusala.This consciousness lasts for one thought-momentand then subsides into the Bhavaïga state.The aspirant continues his concentration and devel-ops in the foregoing manner the second, third, fourth, andfifth Jhànas.The five Jhàna Vipàkas are the corresponding Result-ants of the five Morals. They are experienced in the Form-sphere itself and not in the Kàma-sphere. Kusala and KiriyàJhànas could be experienced in the Kàma-sphere continu-ously even for a whole day.The five factors, Vitakka, Vicàra, Pãti, Sukha, Ekag-gatà collectively found in the Appanà consciousness, con-"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"69stitute what is technically known as jhàna. In the secondJhàna the first factor is eliminated, in the third the firsttwo are eliminated, in the fourth the first three are elimi-nated, while in the fifth even happiness is abandoned andis substituted by equanimity.Sometimes these five Jhànas are treated as four, asmentioned in the Visuddhimagga. In that case the secondJhàna consists of three constituents as both Vitakka andVicàra are eliminated at once.38. Vitakka—is derived from “vi” + √“takk”, tothink. Generally the term is used in the sense of thinkingor reflection. Here it is used in a technical sense. It is thatwhich directs the concomitant states towards the object.(ârammanaü vitakketi sampayuttadhamme abhiniropetã ’ti vitakko). Just as a king’s favourite would conduct a vil-lager to the palace, even so Vitakka directs the mind to-wards the object.Vitakka is an unmoral mental state which, when asso-ciated with a Kusala or Akusala Citta, becomes either moralor immoral. A developed form of this Vitakka is found in thefirst Jhàna consciousness. A still more developed form ofVitakka is found in the Path-consciousness (Magga Citta) asSammà-Saïkappa (Right thoughts). The Vitakka of the Path-consciousness directs the mental states towards Nibbàna anddestroys Micchà (wrong or evil) Vitakka such as thoughts ofsense-desire (Kàma), thoughts of hatred (Vyàpàda), andthoughts of cruelty (Vihiüsà). The Vitakka of the Jhàna con-"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"70sciousness temporarily inhibits sloth and torpor (Thina-Middha) one of the five Hindrances (Nãvaraõa),Through continued practice the second Jhàna isobtained by eliminating Vitakka. When four Jhànas aretaken into account instead of the five, the second Jhàna isobtained by eliminating both Vitakka and Vicàra at thesame time.39. Vicàra is derived from “vi” + √“car”, tomove or wander. Its usual equivalent is investigation. Hereit is used in the sense of sustained application of the mindon the object. It temporarily inhibits doubts (Vicikicchà).According to the commentary Vicàra is that whichmoves around the object. Examination of the object is itscharacteristic. Vitakka is like the flying of a bee towards aflower. Vicàra is like its buzzing around it. As Jhàna factorsthey are correlates.40. Pãti is zest, joy, or pleasurable interest. It isderived from √“pã”, to please, to delight. It is not akind of feeling (Vedanà) like Sukha. It is, so to say, its pre-cursor. Like the first two Jhàna factors, (Pãti) is also a men-tal state found in both moral and immoral consciousness.Creating an interest in the object is its characteristic. Pãtiinhibits Vyàpàda, illwill or aversion.There are five kinds of Pãti:1.Khuddaka Pãti, the thrill of joy that causes ‘the flesh to creep’."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"712.Khanika Pãti, instantaneous joy like a flash of lightning.3.Okkantika Pãti, the flood of joy like the breakers on a seashore.4.Ubbega Pãti, transporting joy which enables one to float in the air just as a lump of cotton carried by the wind.5.Pharaõa Pãti, suffusing joy, which pervades the whole body like a full blown bladder or like a flood that overflows small tanks and ponds.41. Sukha is bliss or happiness. It is a kind of pleas-ant feeling. It is opposed to Uddhacca and Kukkucca (rest-lessness and brooding). As Vitakka is the precursor ofVicàra, so is Pãti the precursor of Sukha.The enjoyment of the desired object is its character-istic. It is like a king that enjoys a delicious dish.Pãti creates an interest in the object, while Sukhaenables one to enjoy the object.Like the sight of an oasis to a weary traveller, is Pãti.Like drinking water and bathing therein, is Sukha.This mental Sukha which should be differentiatedfrom Ahetuka Kàyika (physical) happiness is identical withSomanassa. But it is a joy disconnected with materialpleasures. This pleasurable feeling is the inevitable out-come of renouncing them (Niràmisa Sukha). Nibbànicbliss is yet far more subtle than Jhànic bliss. There is nofeeling in experiencing the bliss of Nibbàna. The total"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"72release from suffering (Dukkhåpasama) is itself Nibbànicbliss. It is comparable to the “ease” of an invalid who isperfectly cured of a disease. It is a bliss of relief.42. Upekkhà—literally, means seeing (ikkhati) im-partially (upa = yuttito). It is viewing an object with a bal-anced mind. Atthasàlinã states:—“ This is impartiality(majjhattaü) in connection with the object, and implies adiscriminative knowledge (paricchindanakaü ¤àõaü).”This explanation applies strictly to Upekkhà found inSobhana consciousness accompanied by wisdom. Upekkhàfound in the Akusalas and Ahetukas is just neutral feelingwithout the least trace of any discriminative knowledge. Inthe Kàmàvacara Sobhanas, too, there may arise that neutralfeeling, as in the case of one hearing the Dhamma withoutany pleasurable interest, and also a subtle form of Upekkhàthat views the object with deliberate impartiality and dis-criminative knowledge, as in the case of a wise person whohears the Dhamma with a critical and impartial mind.Upekkhà of the Jhàna consciousness, in particular, isof ethical and psychological importance. It certainly is notthe ordinary kind of Upekkhà, generally found in the Akus-ala consciousness which comes naturally to an evil-doer.The Jhàna Upekkhà has been developed by a strong will-power. Realising that pleasurable feeling is also gross, theYogi eliminates it as he did the other three Jhàna factors,and develops the more subtle and peaceful Upekkhà. Onthe attainment of the fifth Jhàna breathing ceases. As he"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"73has transcended both pain and pleasure by will-power, heis immune to pain too.This Upekkhà is a highly refined form of the ordinarytatramajjhattatà, even-mindedness, one of the moral men-tal states, latent in all types of Sobhana consciousness.In the Pàli phrase—Upekkhà satipàrisuddhi—purityof mindfulness which comes of equanimity—it is the tatra-majjhattatà that is referred to. This is latent in the first fourJhànas too. In the fifth Jhàna this tatramajjhattatà is sin-gled out and becomes highly refined. Both neutral feeling(Upekkhà Vedanà) and equanimity that correspond to theone Pàli term Upekkhà are found in the fifth Jhàna.Thus there appear to be four kinds of Upekkhà, viz:—(1) just neutral feeling, found in the six Akusala Cittas,(2) sensitive passive neutral feeling (Anubhavana Upekkhà)found in the eight Ahetuka sense-door consciousness(dvipa¤ca-vi¤¤àõa)24 (3) intellectual Upekkhà, found most-ly in the two Sobhana Kriyà Cittas, accompanied by know-ledge, and sometimes in the two Sobhana Kusala Cittas,accompanied by knowledge, (4) ethical Upekkhà, found inall the Sobhana Cittas, especially in the fifth Jhàna.Brahmavihàrupekkhà and Saïkhàrupekkhà may beincluded in both intellectual and ethical Upekkhà.25The first is equanimity amidst all vicissitudes of life.The second is neither attachment õor aversion with re-spect to all conditioned things.24.Excluding Kàyavi¤¤àõa.25.See Compendium of Philosophy, pp. 14, 66, 229–232."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"74Visuddhimagga enumerates ten kinds of Upekkhà.See the Path of Purity — Vol. II pp. 184–186.43.

Aråpa Jhana—The Yogi who has developed the Råpa Jhànas and whowishes to develop the Aråpa Jhànas now concentrates onthe Pañibhàga Nimitta mentioned in the previous section.As he does so, a faint light, like a fire fly, issues from theKasiõa object.

The Realisation of Nibbàna.The Yogi who wishes to realise Nibbàna tries to under-stand things as they truly are. With his one-pointed mindhe scrutinises his self and, on due examination, discovers"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"84that his so-called “Ego-personality” is nothing but a merecomposition of mind and matter—the former consisting offleeting mental states that arise as a result of the sensescoming into contact with the sense-stimuli, and the latterof forces and qualities that manifest themselves in multi-farious phenomena.Having thus gained a correct view of the real natureof his self, freed from the false notion of an identical sub-stance of mind and matter, he attempts to investigate thecause of this “Ego-personality”. He realises that everythingworldly, himself not excluded, is conditioned by causespast or present, and that this existence is due to past igno-rance (avijjà), craving (taõhà), attachment (upàdàna),Kamma, and physical food (àhàra) of the present life. Onaccount of these five causes this personality has arisen andas the past activities have conditioned the present, so thepresent will condition the future. Meditating thus, he tran-scends all doubts with regard to the past, present, andfuture (Kankhàvitaraõavisuddhi). Thereupon he contem-plates that all conditioned things are transient (Anicca),subject to suffering (Dukkha), and devoid of an immortalsoul (Anattà). Wherever he turns his eyes, he sees noughtbut these three characteristics standing out in bold relief.He realises that life is a mere flowing, a continuous undi-vided movement. Neither in a celestial plane nor on earthdoes he find any genuine happiness, for every form ofpleasure is only a prelude to pain. What is transient istherefore subject to suffering and where change and sor-"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"85row prevail there cannot be a permanent ego.As he is thus absorbed in meditation, a day comeswhen, to his surprise, he witnesses an aura emanating fromhis body (Obhàsa). He experiences an unprecedented pleas-ure, happiness, and quietude. He becomes even-mindedand strenuous. His religious fervour increases, and mindful-ness becomes perfect, and Insight extraordinarily keen.Mistaking this advanced state of moral progress forSainthood, chiefly owing to the presence of the aura, hedevelops a liking to this mental state. Soon the realisationcomes that these new developments are only obstacles tomoral progress and he cultivates the ‘Purity of Knowledge’with regard to the ‘Path’ and ‘Non-Path’ (Maggàmagga-¤àõadassana Visuddhi).Perceiving the right path, he resumes his meditationon the arising (Udaya ¤àõa) and passing away (Vaya¤àõa) of conditioned things. Of these two characteristicsthe latter becomes more impressed in his mind, becausechange is more conspicuous than becoming. Therefore heturns his attention to the contemplation of the dissolutionof things (Bhanga ¤àõa). He perceives that both mind andmatter, which constitute his personality, are in a state ofconstant flux, not remaining for two consecutive momentsthe same. To him then comes the knowledge that all dis-solving things are fearful (Bhaya ¤àõa). The whole worldappears to him like a pit of burning embers, a source ofdanger. Subsequently he reflects on the wretchedness andvanity (âdãnava ¤aõa) of the fearful world and feeling dis-"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"86gusted with it (Nibbidà ¤àõa), wishes to escape therefrom(Mu¤citukamyatà ¤àõa).With this object in view, he meditates again on thethree characteristics (Pañisankhà ¤àõa), and thereafterbecomes completely indifferent to all conditioned things—having neither attachment nor aversion for any worldlyobject (Saïkhàrupekkhà ¤àõa). Reaching this point ofmental culture, he takes for his object of special endeavourone of the three characteristics that appeals to him most,and intently keeps on developing insight in that particulardirection, until that glorious day when, for the first time,he realises Nibbàna, his ultimate goal.30A Javana thought-process then runs as follows:—1234 56,7++++ +++Parikamma Upacàra Anuloma Gotrabhå Magga PhalaWhen there is no Parikamma thought-moment, in the caseof an individual with keen Insight, there arise three Phalathought-moments.These nine kinds of insight, viz:— Udaya, Vaya,Bhanga, Bhaya, âdãnava, Nibbidà, Mu¤citukamyatà, Pañi-sankhà and Saïkhàrupekkhà ¤àõas are collectively called“Pañipadà ¥àõadassana Visuddhi”— Purity of Knowledgeand Vision as regards the Practice.Insight found in this Supramundane Path-Consciousness is known as ¥àõadassana Visuddhi—30.See The Buddha and His Teachings—p. 545."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"87Purity of Knowledge and Vision.When the spiritual pilgrim realises Nibbàna for the firsttime, he is called a Sotàpanna—one who has entered theStream that leads to Nibbàna for the first time. He is no morea worldling (Puthujjana) but an Ariya. He eliminates threeFetters—namely, Self-illusion (Sakkàya diññhi), Doubts (Vici-kicchà), and Adherence to Wrongful Rites and Ceremonies(Sãlabbata Paràmàsa). As he has not eradicated all the Fet-ters that bind him to existence, he is reborn seven times atthe most. In his subsequent birth he may or may not beaware of the fact that he is a Sotàpanna. Nevertheless, hepossesses the characteristics peculiar to such a Saint.He gains implicit confidence in the Buddha, Dhammaand the Sangha, and would never violate any of the fivePrecepts. He is moreover absolved from states of woe, forhe is destined to Enlightenment.Summoning up fresh courage as a result of this dis-tant glimpse of Nibbàna, the Aryan pilgrim makes rapidprogress, and perfecting his Insight becomes a Sakadà-gàmi, (Once-Returner), by attenuating two other Fetters—namely, Sense-desire (Kàmaràga) and illwill (Pañigha).In this case, too, and in the case of the other twoadvanced stages of Sainthood, a Javana thought-processruns as above; but the Gotrabhå thought-moment istermed “Vodàna” (pure) as the individual is purified.A Sakadàgàmi is reborn on earth only once in case hedoes not attain Arahantship in that life itself. It is interest-ing to note that the pilgrim who has attained the second"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"88stage of Sainthood can only weaken these two powerfulfetters with which he is bound from a beginningless past.Occasionally he may be disturbed by thoughts of lust andanger to a slight extent.It is by attaining the third stage of Sainthood,Anàgàmi (State of a Never-Returner), that he completelydiscards the above two Fetters. Thereafter he neitherreturns to this world nor does he seek birth in celestialrealms, since he has rooted out the desire for sensualpleasures. After death he is reborn in the “Pure Abodes”(Suddhàvàsa) environment reserved for Anàgàmis andArahants. There he attains Arahantship and lives till theend of his life.Now the earnest pilgrim, encouraged by the unprec-edented success of his endeavours, makes his finaladvance, and destroying the remaining five Fetters—namely, Attachment to Form-Sphere (Råparàga), Attach-ment to Formless-Sphere (Aråpa ràga), Conceit (Màna),Restlessness (Uddhacca), and Ignorance (Avijjà), attainsArahantship, the final stage of Sainthood.It will be noted that the Fetters have to be eradicatedin four stages. The Path (Magga) thought-moment occursonly once. The Fruit (Phala) thought-moment immediatelyfollows. In the Supramundane classes of consciousness theeffect of the Kusala Cittas is instantaneous hence it is calledAkàlika (of immediate fruit); whereas in the case of LokiyaCittas effects may take place in this life, or in a subsequentlife, or at any time till one attains Parinibbàna."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"89In the Mundane consciousness Kamma is predomi-nant, while in the Supramundane Pa¤¤à or wisdom is pre-dominant.

Uttara means that which transcends. Lokut-tara therefore means that which transcends the world ofAggregates of Attachment. This definition strictly applies tothe Four Paths. The Fruits are called Lokuttara because theyhave transcended the world of Aggregates of Attachment.46. Forty Types of Lokuttara Cittas:—One who has attained the First Jhàna emerges from it andmeditates on the impermanence, sorrowfulness, and soul-lessness of those mental states in that particular conscious-ness and ultimately realises Nibbàna.

But he finds the subject interesting and edifying,when he seriously attempts to analyse and examine thevarious substances with different tests.In like manner a student of Abhidhamma who readsthis chapter should first try to analyse and examine care-fully every type of consciousness and see for himself themental states thereof according to his own reasoning.Later, he should compare his results with the original text.He will then find this chapter most illuminating, andinstead of wasting time in memorising numbers, he willintelligently grasp the meaning of the text.For example, let us analyse the first immoral type ofconsciousness, rooted in attachment.Somanassà-sahagata— Accompanied by pleasure,Diññhigata-sampayutta — Connected with misbelief,Asaõkhàrika — Unprompted.This consciousness, when analysed, will show that theVedanà or feeling is ‘Pleasure’.The 7 Universals and all the Particulars are found in it."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"96The 4 Immoral mental states common to all immor-als, such as Moha (delusion), Ahirika (shamelessness).Anottappa, (fearlessness), and Uddhacca (restlessness) mustarise in it.What about the remaining ten?Lobha — attachment must arise.Diññhi — misbelief must arise.Màna — conceit cannot arise.Conceit does not arise in lobha consciousness, togetherwith misbelief.

Like contact, feeling is an essential prop-erty of every consciousness. It may be pleasurable, painful,or neutral. Pain and pleasure pertain to body as well. Butphysical feeling is not of ethical importance.According to the commentators feeling is like a mas-ter who enjoys a dish prepared by a cook. The latter iscompared to the remaining mental states that constitute athought-complex. Strictly speaking, it is feeling that expe-riences an object when it comes in contact with thesenses.It is this feeling that experiences the desirable orundesirable fruits of an action done in this or in a previousbirth. Besides this mental state there is no soul or any otheragent to experience the result of the action.It should be understood here that Nibbànic bliss isnot connected with feeling. Nibbànic bliss is certainly thehighest happiness (Sukha), but it is the happiness of relieffrom suffering. It is not the enjoyment of a pleasurableobject.4.Sa¤¤à—Saü +√¤à, to know. (CompareLatin cognoscere, to know.)The meaning of this term widely varies according tothe context. To avoid unnecessary confusion, it is best tounderstand the specific meaning used in this particularconnection as a universal mental state.The chief characteristic of Sa¤¤à is the cognition ofan object by way of a mark as blue etc. It is Sa¤¤à that"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"106enables one to recognise an object that has once been per-ceived by the mind through the senses. “Its procedure islikened to the carpenter’s recognition of certain kinds ofwood by the mark he had made on each; to the treasurer’sspecifying certain articles of jewelry by the ticket on each;to the wild animal’s discernment in the scarecrow of thework of man.”Sa¤¤à, therefore, means simple sense-perception.“Perception”, according to a modern Dictionary ofPhilosophy, “ is the apprehension of ordinary sense-objects, such as trees, houses, chairs, etc., on the occasionof sensory stimulation.”Perception is not used here in the sense employed byearly modern philosophers such as Bacon, Descartes,Spinoza, and Leibniz.As one of the five Khandhas (Aggregates) Sa¤¤à isused in the sense of perception.Could it be that memory is due to this Sa¤¤à?Sa¤¤à, Vi¤¤àõa and Pa¤¤à should be differentiatedfrom one another. Sa¤¤à is like the mere perception of arupee coin by a child. By its whiteness, roundness and sizeit merely recognises the coin as a rupee, utterly ignorant ofits monetary value. A man, for instance, discerns its valueand its utility, but is not aware of its chemical composition.Vi¤¤àõa is comparable to the ordinary man’s knowledge ofthe rupee. Pa¤¤à is like the analytical knowledge of achemist who knows all its chemical properties in everydetail."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"1075.Cetanà—Both Cetanà and Citta are derived from the same root√cit, to think.In the case of Citta—mind or consciousness—theroot assumes the meaning of discernment (vijànana),while in Cetanà it is used in the sense of co-ordination(abhisandhàna) and accumulation (àyåhana).According to the Atthasàlinã and Vibhàvini TãkàCetanà is that which co-ordinates the mental states associ-ated with itself on the object of consciousness. (Attanàsampayutta-dhamme àrammaõe abhisandahati). Like achief disciple, or like a carpenter who fulfils his duties andregulates the work of others as well, so does Cetanà fulfilits own function and regulate the function of other con-comitants associated with itself.A further explanation has been offered. Cetanà isthat which arrives at action in conditioning the condi-tioned. (Saïkhatàbhisaïkharaõe và byàpàraü àpajjatã ’ticetanà). Cetanà is that which plays a predominant part inall actions, moral and immoral.Shwe Zan Aung says that according to Ledi Sayadaw,the Burmese Abhidhamma scholar, “Cetanà acts on its con-comitants, acts in getting the object, and acts on accom-plishing the task, i.e., determines action”. (Compendium,p. 236).The most significant mental state in the MundaneConsciousness (Lokiya) is this Cetanà, while in the Supra-"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"108mundane it is Pa¤¤à, wisdom or insight. Mundanethoughts tend to accumulate Kamma. Supramundanethoughts, on the contrary, tend to eradicate Kamma.Hence Cetanà in the supramundane consciousness doesnot constitute Kamma. Cetanà in every moral and immoraltype of mundane consciousness, on the other hand, isregarded as Kamma. Although Cetanà is found in Vipàkatypes of consciousness too, it is of no moral significance asit lacks accumulative power.It is this Cetanà that is alluded to as Saïkhàra and(Kamma) Bhava in the Pañicca-Samuppàda. In the Pa¤cak-khandha, by Saïkhàrakkhandha are meant the fifty men-tal states, excluding Vedanà and Sa¤¤à, with Cetanà as theforemost.From a psychological standpoint Cetanà determinesthe activities of the mental states associated with it. Froman ethical standpoint, it determines its inevitable conse-quences. Hence where there is no Cetanà, there is noKamma.6.Ekaggatà—Eka + agga + tà = One-pointedness, or concentration onone object, or focussing the mind on one object. It is like asteady lamp-flame in a windless place. It is like a firmlyfixed pillar that cannot be shaken by the wind. It is likewater that binds together several substances to form oneconcrete compound.

MentalStates are vitalized by psychic life, while material phenom-ena are vitalized by physical life.As lotuses are sustained by water, an infant is sus-tained by a nurse, so are mental states and material phe-nomena sustained by Jãvitindriya.One Råpa-Jãvitindriya lasts for seventeen thought-moments. Seventeen Nàma-Jãvitindriyas arise and perishduring the brief life of one Råpa-Jãvitindriya.There is a certain kind of Råpa-Jãvitindriya in plantlife.

It is like the rudder of a ship,which is indispensable to take her directly to her destina-tion. Mind without Manasikàra is like a rudderless ship.Manasikàra is also compared to a charioteer that sitswith close attention on two well-trained horses (mind andobject) as regards their rhythmical movements.

Vitakka is like a favourite courtier that intro-duces a villager (mind) into the presence of a king (object).Attention is the closest equivalent to Manasikàra,although the Pàli term does not fully connote the meaningattached to the English word from a strictly philosophicalstandpoint. As a mental state it is mere spontaneous atten-tion. In Manasikàra, as in attention, there is no peculiarvividness or clarity. To Sa¤¤à may be attributed this vivid-ness to some extent.Could Manasikàra also be an aid to memory, as it iscommon to all types of consciousness, whether mundaneor supramundane? Hence they are designated Sabbacitta-sàdhàranà.9.Vitakka—Vi + √ takk, to think.It is difficult to suggest a suitable rendering for thisPàli term which assumes different meanings in the Suttasand Abhidhamma.In the Sutta Piñaka it has been employed in the senseof notions, ideas, thoughts, reasoning etc. In the Abhi-dhamma it is used in a specific technical sense.‘Lifting’ of the concomitants to the object (abhini-ropaõa) is its chief characteristic. As someone ascends tothe king’s palace depending on a king’s favourite, relativeor friend, likewise consciousness ascends to the objectdepending on Vitakka (Atthasàlinã, p. 114).Vitakka may well be defined as the application of the"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"112concomitants on the object. Manasikàra, as stated above,is the directing of the concomitants to the object. The dis-tinguishing characteristics of these two Cetasikas shouldbe clearly understood.Different values are attached to Vitakka when it isused in different connections.As an ordinary particular (pakiõõaka) mental state itis simply called Vitakka. When it is developed and culti-vated it becomes the foremost factor of the First Jhàna.Then it is termed Appanà because the mind is steadfastlyfixed on the object. The ordinary Vitakka simply throwsthe mind to the surface of the object.In the subsequent Jhànas Vitakka is, however, inhib-ited, owing to the habitual association with the object.A villager, for instance, who visits the king’s palacefor the first time, needs the introduction of a favouritecourtier. For his subsequent visits no such introduction isnecessary as he is acquainted with the place.It is this developed Appanà-Vitakka that is known asSamàdhi or concentration.When Vitakka is present in the Supramundane PathConsciousness (Lokuttara Magga Citta) it is termedSammà Saïkappa (Right Thoughts) because it eliminateswrong thoughts and applies the mind to Nibbàna.Vitakka is used in entirely a different sense whenused in connection with the temperaments of individuals.Vitakka Carita means one of a discursive temperament.(See Ch. 1. note 38.)"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"11310.

Or, it is that which iseffected or carried out methodically (Vidhinà ãrayitabbaüpavattetabbaü và).It has the characteristic of supporting (upattham-bana) upholding (paggahaõa), sustaining (ussahana).As an old house is supported by new pillars even soconcomitants are aided and supported by Viriya.Just as a strong reinforcement would help an army tohold on instead of retreating, even so Viriya upholds oruplifts its concomitants.Viriya is regarded as a controlling factor (Indriya)because it overcomes idleness. It is also regarded as one ofthe five powers (Bala) because it cannot be shaken by itsopposite idleness. Viriya serves as one of the four means ofaccomplishing one’s ends (Iddhipàda). It is this Viriya thatappears as Four Modes of Supreme Efforts (Sammappad-hàna). Viriya is sublimated as one of the seven factors ofEnlightenment (Bojjhaïga).

It is opposed to Pa¤¤à—wisdom.The chief characteristic of Moha is confusion withregard to the nature of an object. Moha clouds one’s know-ledge with regard to Kamma and its consequences and thefour noble Truths.16. Ahirika—An abstract noun formed of “a” + hirika.He who is not ashamed of doing evil is ahiriko. Thestate of such a person is ahirikkariü = ahirikaü.One who has hiri recoils from evil just as a cock’sfeather shrinks in front of fire. One who has no Hiri, wouldcommit any evil without the least compunction.17. Anottappa—Na + ava + √tapp, to be tormented.Ottappa is fear to do evil, i.e., fear of the conse-quences.Anottappa is its opposite and is compared to a moththat is singed by fire. A person who is afraid of fire wouldnot touch it, but a moth, unaware of the consequences,"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"117attracted by fire, would get burnt. In the same way a per-son without Ottappa would commit evil and suffer instates of woe.Both these terms—Hiri and Ottappa—are found inconjunction. Hiri should be differentiated from ordinaryshyness and Ottappa from ordinary fear of any individual.Fear is regarded as one of the ten armies of Màra. A Bud-dhist is not expected to be afraid of any individual, even aGod, for Buddhism is not based on the fear of the unknown.Hiri arises from within, and Ottappa from without.Suppose, for instance, there is a piece of iron, one end ofwhich is heated, and the other smeared with filth. Thefilthy end one would not touch owing to disgust, and theother end through fear. Hiri is compared to the former andOttappa to the latter.The following note by Mrs. Rhys Davids on Hiri andOttappa clearly depicts the difference between these rela-tive mental constituents:—“Hiri and Ottappaü, as analysed by Buddhaghosa,present points of considerable ethical interest. Takentogether they give us the emotional and conative aspect ofthe modern notion of conscience, just as sati represents itsintellectual side. The former term ‘is equivalent to shame(lajjà), the latter to ‘anguish (ubbego) over evil-doing.’Hiri has its source within; ottappaü springs from without.Hiri is autonomous (attàdhipati); ottappaü, heterono-mous, influenced by society (lokàdhipati). The former isestablished on shame; the latter on dread. The former is"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"118marked by consistency; the latter by discernment of thedanger and fearsomeness of error. The subjective sourceof hiri is fourfold, viz., the idea of what is due to one’sbirth, age, worth, and education. Thus, one having hiriwill think ‘Only mean folk (fishers etc.) children, poorwretches, the blind and ignorant, would do such an act,’and refrains. The external source of ottappaü is, the ideathat ‘the body of the faithful will blame you,’ and henceone refrains. If a man has hiri, he is, as said the Buddha,his own best master. To one who is sensitive by way ofottappaü, the masters of the faith are the best guides”.In a supplementary paragraph the ‘marks’ (consist-ency etc.) are thus explained: “In Hiri one reflects on theworth of one’s birth, one’s teacher, one’s estate, and one’sfellow-students. In Ottappaü one feels dread at self-reproach, the blame of others, chastisement, and retribu-tion in another life.”(Buddhist Psychology, p. 20).Hiri and Ottappa are regarded as the two dominant factorsthat rule the world. No civilized society can exist withoutthem.18. Uddhacca—U = up, above, + √Dhu, to waver, to shake off.Uddhutassa bhàvo Uddhuccaü = Uddhaccaü =state of throwing up.

It is the unsettled"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"119state of mind, and is opposed to collectedness (vupasama).As one of the five Hindrances it is the antithesis of Sukha,happiness.In some rare instances Uddhacca is used in the senseof puffed-up state of mind, corresponding to conceit. Hereit is not used in that sense. As a rule Uddhacca is differen-tiated from Màna because both of them are treated asSaüyojanas (Fetters).These four, viz., Moha, Ahirika, Anottappa,Uddhacca—that head the list of Immoral Cetasikas—arecommon to all Immoral types of consciousness.19. Lobha—See Ch. 1, note 9.20. Diññhi—See Ch. 1, note 11.The difference between Moha and Diññhi should be noted.The former clouds the object; the latter deals with one’sviews, such as as ‘this indeed is truth, and the rest is false’.Diññhi is opposed to ¥àõa, wisdom. The former rejects thereal nature and views wrongly. The latter discerns theobject as it is.When the Pàli term Diññhi is used alone, unqualify-ingly, it is employed in the sense of Micchà Diññhi—wrongbelief.Sammà Diññhi or Amoha is used as the antithesis ofMoha.21.

Contrary to Issà, this is subjective.Both Issà and Macchariya are regarded as the friendsof Dosa because each of them arises with it.25. Kukkucca—Kukatassa bhàvo = kukkuccaü = the state of having doneamiss.According to the commentary evil that is done isku + kata, and so is good that is not done. Remorse overthe evil that is done is Kukkucca, and so is remorse overthe good that is not done.It has the characteristic of grieving over the evil thatis done and the good that is not done.Dhammasaïganã explains:—“What is worry?”"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"121“Consciousness of what is lawful in something that isunlawful, consciousness of what is unlawful in somethingthat is lawful; consciousness of what is immoral in some-thing that is moral; consciousness of what is moral insomething that is immoral—all this sort of worry, fidget-ing, over-scrupulousness, remorse of conscience, mentalsacrificing—this is what is called worry.”(Buddhist Psychology — p. 313.)Kukkucca is one of the five Hindrances and is usedtogether with Uddhacca. It pertains to past things only.According to Vinaya, Kukkucca is healthy doubt withregard to rules, and is commended. According to Abhi-dhamma, on the contrary, it is repentance which is notcommended.26.

Here body is not used in the sense of mate-rial form, but is applied to the body of mental factors, viz.,Vedanà, Sa¤¤a and Saïkhàrà (feeling, perception, and theremaining fifty mental factors). Hence Middha is the anti-thesis of Kàyakamma¤¤atà, Adaptability of mental factors.Both Thãna And Middha are explained in the Dham-masaïganã as follows:“What is stolidity (Thãna)?“That which is indisposition, unwieldiness of intel-lect; adhering and cohering; clinging, cleaving to, stick-iness; stolidity, that is, a stiffening, a rigidity of theintellect—this is called stolidity.“What is torpor (Middha)?“ That which is indisposition, unwieldiness of sense,a shrouding, enveloping, barricading within; torpor thatwhich is sleep, drowsiness; sleep, slumbering, somnolencethis is called torpor.”(Buddhist Psychology, pp. 311, 312.)28. Vicikicchà—See Ch. 1, note 13.Vicikicchà, as a Hindrance, does not mean doubts withregard to the Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha, etc.,Majjhima Nikàya commentary states — “it is socalled because it is incapable of deciding that it is as such,”"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"123(Idam’ev’idanti nicchetuü asamatthabhàvato’ti vicikicchà).29.

Purifica-tion (sampasàdana) of its mental associates is its chiefcharacteristic. It is compared to the water purifying gem ofthe universal monarch. This particular gem; when throwninto water, causes mud and water-weeds to subside. Thewater is consequently purified. In the same way Saddhàpurifies the mind of its stains.This Saddhà is not blind faith. It is confidence basedon knowledge.One might question whether a non-Buddhist couldalso possess this Saddhà.Atthasàlinã raises this very question and provides ananswer which is rather unsatisfactory and inadequate.“Do men of false opinions not believe in their own teach-ers?” questions Venerable Buddhaghosa. His answer is:—“ They do. But that is not Saddhà; it is a mere acqui-escence in words (Vacanasampañicchanamattameva).”If Saddhà is limited only to Buddhists, what shall wesay when a non-Buddhist places his faith or confidence inhis teacher?

In such a case there is no occasion for a non-Buddhist to experience a moral consciousness.Would it not be more correct to say that Saddhà ismere confidence or faith, instead of restricting to theTriple Gem?Dhammasaïganã explains Saddhà as follows:—“ The faith which on that occasion is trusting in, theprofessing confidence in, the sense of assurance, faith,faith as a faculty and as a power:”(Buddhist Psychology, p. 14.)Saddhà is also apprehension intuitively of experience orknowledge gathered in past births.30. Sati—Derived from √sar, to remember.Sati does not exactly correspond to the Western concep-tion of memory. Mindfulness is a better equivalent for Sati.It has to be developed. In the Satipaññhàna Sutta aredescribed in detail various methods to develop this Sati.When it is highly developed one acquires the power ofremembering past births. It is this Sati that is regarded asone of the factors of the Noble Eightfold Path.Sati tends to present before oneself good things with-out allowing them to be forgotten. Its chief characteristic is‘not floating away’ (apilàpana). Unlike pumpkins and potsthat float on water, Sati plunges into the object of thought.It should be noted that this particular Sati is not"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"125found in immoral types of consciousness.What is found in immoral consciousness is MicchàSati (wrong mindfulness.)Dhammasaïganã explains Sati as follows:—“ The mindfulness which on that occasion is recollect-ing, calling back to mind; the mindfulness which isremembering, bearing in mind the opposite of superficial-ity and of obliviousness; mindfulness as faculty: mindful-ness as power, right mindfulness”.(Buddhist Psychology, p. 16).Commenting on Sati, Mrs. Rhys Davids says:—“Buddhaghosa’s comment on Sati, in which heclosely follows and enlarges on the account in Mil. 37, 38,shows that the traditional conception of that aspect of con-sciousness had much in common with the Western moderntheory of conscience or moral sense. Sati appears underthe metaphor of an inward mentor, discriminatingbetween good and bad and prompting choice. Hardy wentso far as to render it by ‘conscience’, but this slurs over theinteresting divergencies between Eastern and Westernthought. The former is quite unmystical of the subject ofSati. It takes the psychological process or representativefunctioning (without bringing out the distinction betweenbare memory and judgment), and presents the same underan ethical aspect.”(Buddhist Psychology, p. 16.)31.

It is not mereabsence of hatred or aversion, but is a positive virtue.Adosa is synoymous with Mettà, Loving-kindness,which is one of the four Illimitables.Readers will note that in enumerating the Illimit-ables only two are mentioned, viz.—Karuõà and Mudità.The reason being that Mettà is implied by this Adosa; andUpekkhà, by Tatramajjhattatà, equanimity.Adosa is also one of the three roots of good.

Its function is thesuppression of annoyance or feverishness like sandal wood.Its manifestation is loveliness like the full moon. The char-acteristic, function, etc., of Amoha have been explainedin connection with the term Pa¤¤indriya (Faculty ofWisdom). Of these three, again, Alobha is opposed to thetaint of selfishness, Adosa to that of impurity (dussãlya),Amoha to the non-development of moral conditions.“Alobha is the cause of generosity, Adosa of morality,Amoha of meditation.“Through Alobha what is in excess is not taken, forthe greedy take what is in excess.

Tatramajjhattatà—Lit., tatra = there, i.e., with respect to objects; majhattatà= middleness, that is, equipoise.Impartial view of objects is its chief characteristic. Itis compared to a charioteer who views equally a pair ofwell-trained horses.Tatramajjhattatà and Upekkhà (equanimity) are some-times used as synonymous terms.

(See Ch. 1. note 42.)36. Kàya Passaddhi & Citta–Passaddhi—Passaddhi is composed of pa + √sambh, to calm, to betranquil.Pa + sambh + ti = passadhti = passaddhi. Passaddhiis tranquillity, calmness, quietude, serenity.The chief characteristic of Passaddhi is the suppres-sion or the allaying of feverishness of passions (Kilesa-daratha-våpasama). It is like the cool shade of a tree to aperson affected by the sun’s heat. Passaddhi is opposed toUddhacca, restlessness, or excitement. When highly devel-oped it becomes a factor of Enlightenment (Bojjhaïga).This tranquillity is twofold, viz., tranquillity of Kàyaand Citta. Here Kàya is not used in the sense of materialbody. It is the body of psychic factors—namely, Vedanà(feeling), Sa¤¤à) (perception), and Saïkhàrà (mentalstates). It should be understood that Kàya is used in thesame sense in the subsequent cetasikas. Citta connotes thewhole consciousness. The difference therefore lies betweenpsychic factors and consciousness as a whole. The sameexplanation applies to the other pairs as well.37. Kàya–Lahutà & Citta–Lahutà—Derived from Laghu, light, quick. (Skt. Laghutà). Lahutà isbouyancy or lightness. Suppression of the heaviness of themind and mental factors is its chief characteristic.

It is opposed to Thãna"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"133and Middha—sloth and torpor—which cause heavinessand rigidity in mental factors and consciousness.38. Kàya–Mudutà & Citta–Mudutà—The chief characteristic of Mudutà is the suppression of stiff-ness and resistance. It removes stiffness and becomes pli-able in receiving objects. It is compared to a skin that is wellmoulded by applying oil, water, etc. It. is opposed to falseviews and conceit (Diññhi and Màna) which cause stiffness.39. Kàya–Kamma¤¤atà & Citta–Kamma¤¤atà—Kamma + nya + tà = Kammanyatà = Kamma¤¤atà. Lit.,workableness or serviceableness.Its chief characteristic is the supression of unservice-ableness or unworkableness of consciousness and its fac-tors. It is like a heated metal made fit for any use. It isopposed to all the remaining Hindrances. Atthasàlinã statesthat these two allied concomitants produce serenity(Pasàda) in propitious things, and are adaptable like puregold, for beneficial works.40. Kaya–Pàgu¤¤atà & Citta–Pàgu¤¤atà—This is proficiency or skilfulness. Its chief characteristic isthe suppression of sickness of mind and its concomitants.It is opposed to such passions as faithlessness etc.41.

Its chief characteristic isstraightness.42.All these 19 concomitants are common to alltypes of moral consciousness, unlike the immoral concom-itants which do not arise in an immoral consciousnessin toto. No moral consciousness arises without all of them.Along with this ‘Beautiful’ group some other moral concom-itants may arise according to the type of Consciousness.43. Virati—Vi + √ram, to delight in. Virati is refraining from,delighting in, i.e., abstinence.According to the Atthasàlinã there are there kinds ofVirati—namely, Sampatta-Virati, Samàdàna-Virati, andSamuccheda-Virati.Sampatta-Virati is abstaining from evil as occasionarises considering one’s birth, age, education, etc.Samàdàna-Virati is abstaining from evil in accord-ance with one’s observances. For example, a Buddhistwould abstain from killing, stealing, etc., as he observesthe precepts not to kill etc.Samuccheda-Virati is the abstinence of an AriyanDisciple by completely eradicating all the roots of evil.In the case of the former two, violation of good prin-ciples is possible; but in the case of Arahants it is not,because they have destroyed all passions.Here are enumerated three Abstinences pertaining towrong speech, wrong actions, and wrong livelihood."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"135Strictly speaking, these three mental concomitantscollectively arise only in the Supramundane consciousness(Lokuttara Citta). In other cases they arise separatelybecause there are three Cetanàs.These three when present in the Lokuttara Citta areregarded as Factors of the Path (Magganga), and they con-stitute Sila (Morality). Sammà-Diññhi and SammàSankhappa which constitute Pa¤¤à (Wisdom) are impliedby Pa¤¤indriya and Vitakka-Cetasikas respectively.Sammà Vàyàma, Sammà Sati, and Sammà Samàdhi whichconstitute Samàdhi (Concentration) are implied by Viriya,Sati, and Ekaggatà Cetasikas respectively.Sammà Vàcà deals with abstinence from false speech(Musàvàda), slandering (Pisunavàcà), harsh speech(Pharusavàcà) and frivolous talk (Sampapphalàpa).Sammà Kammanta deals with abstinence from kill-ing (Pànàtipàta), stealing (Adinnàdàna), and sexual mis-conduct (Kàmesu Micchàcàra).Sammà âjiva deals with abstinence from selling poi-son, intoxicants, weapons, slaves and animals for slaughter.44. Appama¤¤à—As the object of these virtues is the infinite number ofbeings, they are called Appama¤¤à, lit., illimitable (Skt.Apràmànya). They are also- called Brahma vicara—Sub-lime Modes of Living.Mettà, Karåõà, Mudità, and Upekkhà are these fourIllimitables."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"136As explained above Mettà and Upekkhà are repre-sented by Adosa and Tatramajjhattatà.

Thatwhich softens the mind, or friendly disposition is Mettà.Goodwill, benevolence, loving-kindness are sug-gested as the best renderings. Mettà is not carnal love oraffection. The direct enemy of Mettà is hatred or illwill(Kodha), its indirect enemy is affection (Pema). Mettàembraces all beings without exception. The culmination ofMettà is the identification of oneself with all beings (Sab-battatà).Mettà is the sincere wish for the good and welfare ofall. It discards illwill.Benevolent attitude is its chief characteristic.46. Karuõà—√Kar, to do, to make + uõà.That which makes the hearts of the good quiver whenothers are afflicted with sorrow is Karuõà. That which dis-sipates the sufferings of others is Karuõà.The wish for the removal of sufferings of others is itschief characteristic.

Mudità—Derived from √mud, to be pleased.It is not mere sympathy but appreciative joy. Its directenemy is jealousy and its indirect enemy is exultation(Pahàsa). Its chief characteristic is happy acquiescence inothers’ prosperity (Anumodanà). Mudità embraces pros-perous beings. It discards dislike (Arati), and is the con-gratulatory attitude of a person.48. Upekkhà—Upa = impartially, justly +√ikkh, to see, to view, to look.Upekkhà is to view impartially, i.e., neither withattachment nor with aversion. It is the balanced state ofmind. Its direct enemy is passion (Ràga), and its indirectenemy is unintelligent indifference. Attachment and aver-sion are eliminated by Upekkhà. Impartial attitude is itschief characteristic.Here Upekkhà does not mean mere neutral feeling,but a sterling virtue is implied thereby. Equanimity is theclosest equivalent. That term, too, conveys only one aspectof Upekkhà. (See ch. 1, notes 10, 42). It is this Upekkhàthat is elevated to a Bojjhaïga factor.Upekkhà embraces all good and bad ones, loved andunloved ones, agreeable and disagreeable things, pleasureand pain and all such similar opposite pairs.49.The following illuminating note by Mrs. RhysDavids on these four virtues is well worth reading."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"138“On these four great exercises, see Rhys Davids, S.B.E.xi 201, n.; and on their emancipating efficacy, M. i. 38.Buddhaghosa again refers to the reader to his VisuddhiMagga for a more detailed commentary (vide chap. ix., andof Hardy, ‘Eastern Monachism’, p. 243 et seq.).... The objectof thought (ârammaõa) in this connexion will be ‘limited’ ifthe student dwells in love etc., on but a restricted numberof beings; ‘infinite’ if his heart embraces vast numbers.“ The commentator has not a little to say in thepresent work, however, on the nature and mutual rela-tions of the ‘Abodes’ (pp. 193–195). First, the characteris-tics of each are fully set forth, together with their falsemanifestation (Vipatti). Clinging (Sinehasambhavo) is theVipatti of love, the essential mark of which is the carryingon of beneficent conduct etc. Tears and the like are lesstruly characteristic of pity (Karuõà) than is the bearing andrelieving the woes of others. Laughter and the like are lessgenuine expressions of sympathy (Mudità) than is appre-ciation of what others have achieved. And there is a condi-tion of disinterestedness (Upekkhà) which is prompted byignorance, and not by that insight into the karma of man-kind which can avail to calm the passions.“He next designates the four antisocial attitudeswhich are to be extirpated by these ethical disciplinestaken in order—illwill (Vyàpàda), cruelty (Vihesa), aver-sion (Arati), and passion (Ràga)—and shows how eachvirtue has also a second vice opposed to it. This he termsits near enemy, as being less directly assailed by it than its"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"139ethical opposite, the latter resembling an enemy who hasto lurk afar in the jungle and the hills. Love and vengefulconduct cannot coexist. To prevail in this respect, let lovebe developed fearlessly. But where love and its object havetoo much in common, love is threatened by lust. On thisside let love be guarded well. Again the near enemy to pity,more insidious than cruelty, is the self-pity pining for onehas not got or has lost—a low, profane melancholy. Andthe corresponding worldly happiness in what one has, orin consequence of obliviousness as to what one has lost,lies in wait to stifle appreciation of the good fortune ofothers. Lastly, there is the unintelligent indifference of theworldling who has not triumphed over limitations normastered cause and effect, being unable to transcendexternal things.“ The remainder of his remarks are occupied with thenecessary sequence in the four Abodes, and the impor-tance of observing method in their cultivation, and finallywith their other technical appellation of Appama¤¤à orinfinitudes. In this connexion he repeats the touching illus-tration given in Hardy (op. Cit., 249) of the mother andthe four children. Her desire for the growth of the infant isas Mettà; for the recovery of the sick child as Karuõa; forthe maintenance of the gifts displayed by the youth asMudità; while her care not to hinder the career of hergrown-up son is as Upekkhà.“It may be remarked, by the way, that when Hardy,with a foreigner’s want of Mudità, calumniates the Bud-"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"140dhist mendicant (p. 250) as one who thinks about the vir-tues of solidarity without practising them, he quite for-gets that these exercises are but preparations of the willfor that ministering to the intellectual needs of others towhich the recluse’s life was largely devoted, and theimportance of which the Western, in his zeal for materialforms of charity, does not even now appreciate at its realvalue. And Buddhism did not believe in giving the rein togood impulses unregulated by intellectual control.”(Buddhist Psychology, pp. 65–67).50. Pa¤¤indriya—Pa = rightly; ¤à, to know. Pa¤¤à, literally, means rightknowing.Its chief characteristic is understanding as it really isor irresistible understanding, i.e., penetrative knowledge(Yathàsabhàva — pañivedho và akkhalita — pativedho).As Pa¤¤à dominates in understanding the real natureand as it overcomes ignorance, it is called a controlling fac-ulty (Indriya).In Abhidhamma ¥àõa, Pa¤¤à, and Amoha are usedas interchangeable terms. In types of consciousness con-nected with knowledge (¥àõa-sampayutta) the referenceis to this Pa¤¤à. By Amoha, one of the three moral roots, isalso meant this Pa¤¤à. As one of the four means of accom-plishing one’s ends (Iddhipàda) it assumes the name ofVãmàüsà (lit., examination). When purified by SamàdhiPa¤¤à assumes the honourable role of Abhi¤¤à (Higher"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"141Knowledge). Highly developed Pa¤¤à is elevated to thestate of a Bojjhaïga—Dhammavicaya (Investigation of theTruth) and Magga¤ga—Sammà Diññhi, Right View. Theculmination of Pa¤¤à is the Omniscience of a Buddha.Pa¤¤à, in the strictest sense of the term, is seeingthings as they truly are, i.e., in the light of Anicca (imper-manence), Dukkha, (sorrow), and Anattà, (soullessness).Reason, intellect, insight, knowledge, wisdom, intel-ligence—all convey some aspects of Pa¤¤à, but none ofthem exactly corresponds to the Pàli term. Both knowledgeand wisdom are employed here according to the context.Mrs. Rhys David’s comment on this important term isinteresting. She writes:—“ To fit the term Pa¤¤à with its approximate Euro-pean equivalent is one of the cruces of Buddhist philoso-phy. I have tried in turn reason, intellect, insight, science,understanding and knowledge. All of these have been, andare, used in the literature of philosophy with varyingshades of connotation, according as the sense to be con-veyed is popular and vague, psychological and precise ortranscendental and—passez-moi le mot—having precisevagueness.“And each of them might, with one implication oranother, represent Pa¤¤à. The main difficulty in choice layin determining whether, to the Buddhist, Pa¤¤à stood formental function, or for the aggregate product of certainmental functioning, or for both. When all the allusions toPa¤¤à in the Sutta Pitaka have been collated, a final trans-"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"142lation becomes possible. Here it must suffice to quote two.M. i. 292, he who has Pa¤¤à (Pa¤¤avà) is declared in vir-tue thereof to understand (Pajànàti) the nature of the phe-nomenon of pain or ill (the Four Noble Truths). In D. i. 124Gotama asks: what is this Pa¤¤à? and himself sets out itscontent as consisting in certain intellectual attainments,viz., the Jhànas, insight into the nature of impermanence,the mental image of one’s self, the power of Iddhi, the cos-mic Ear, insight into other minds, into one’s own past lives,the cosmic Eye, and the elimination of all vitiating tenden-cies. Buddhaghosa also(Visuddhi Magga Ch. xiv.) distin-guishes Pa¤¤à from Sa¤¤à and Vi¤¤àna. He describes it asadequate to discern not only what these can, viz., sense-objects and the Three Marks (impermanence, pain andnon-substantiality) respectively, but also the path. For him,then, it might be called intellect ‘at a higher power’. And inGotama’s reply, all those terms are described in terms ofintellectual process. Nevertheless, it is clear that the termdid not stand for bare mental process of a certain degree ofcomplexity, but that it also implied mental process as cul-tivated in accordance with a certain system of conceptsobjectively valid for all Buddhist adepts. Hence I think itbest to reject such terms as reason, intellect., and under-standing, and to choose wisdom, or science, or knowledge,or philosophy. Only they must be understood in this con-nexion as implying the body of learning as assimilated andapplied by the intellect of a given individual.”(Buddhist Psychology. pp. 17–18)."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"143_______Different Combinations of Mental States§ 3 Tesaü cittàviyuttànaü39— yathàyogam’ito paraüCittuppàdesu40 paccekaü — sampayogo pavuccatiSatta sabbattha yujjanti— Yathàyogaü pakiõõakàCuddasà’kusalesv’eva— sobhanesv’eva sobhanà._______§ 3.

But it does not follow that Màna is ever present in them.47.These four cannot arise in consciousness rooted in attachment because there is some form of aversion in them instead of any kind of clinging. Even Macchariya is a kind of aversion to other’s vying with oneself.48.Thina and Middha are by nature opposed to adaptability. They lack the urge.

In the Kàmàvacarakusala-cittas there is only a temporary inhibition of evil.As Kàmàvacara-Vipàka-cittas are merely effects theycannot arise in them. Since Kriyà-cittas are experiencedonly by Arahants, they do not arise in them.

Feeling is its char-acteristic (vedayita-lakkhana), and is born of contact.Sensation, therefore, is not an appropriate rendering forVedanà.Feeling is defined as “a conscious, subjective impres-sion which does not involve cognition or representation ofan object,.”85 Sensation is explained as “the content ofsensuous intuition, or the way in which a conscious subjectis modified by the presence of an object,.”86Vedanà modifies the stream of consciousness andserves both as a life-promoting and life-destroying force.Pleasure, for example, promotes life; pain impairs it. Assuch feeling plays a very important part in the life of man.Experiencing the taste of an object is the function ofVedanà (anubhavana rasa). Particular likes and dislikesdepend on the desirability and the undesirability of theexternal object. Generally they are mechanistic.Sometimes the freewill of a person determines themode of feeling independent of the nature of the object.The sight of an enemy, for example, would normally be a85.Dictionary of Philosophy—p. 108.86.

Socrates,for instance, drank that cup of poison with joy and faced ahappy death. Once a certain brahman poured a torrent ofabuse on the Buddha, but He kept smiling and returnedlove unto him. The ascetic Khantivàdi, who was brutallytortured by a drunkard king, wished him long life insteadof cursing him.A bigoted non-Buddhist, on the other hand, mayeven, at the sight of a Buddha, harbour a thought ofhatred. His feeling will be one of displeasure. Likewise asimilar feeling may arise in the heart of a bigoted Buddhistat the sight of a religious teacher of an alien faith. What ismeat and drink to one, maybe poison to another.Material pleasures, for instance, would be highlyprized by an average person. An understanding reclusewould find happiness in renouncing them and leading alife of voluntary poverty in perfect solitude. Such a solitarylife, a sensualist may view as hell. Yes, what is heaven toone may be hell to another; what is hell to one may beheaven to another. We ourselves create them, and they aremore or less mind-made.“There are, O Bhikkhus, two kinds of feeling—painand happiness”, says the Buddha. Well, then, how canthere be a third which is neither pain nor happiness? Thecommentary states that blameless neutral feeling isincluded in happiness and the blameworthy in pain."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"171Again, the Buddha has stated that whatever is felt inthis world, all that is pain. It is because of the changeablenature of all conditioned things.From another standpoint considering all forms offeeling as purely mental, there are only three kinds—namely, happiness (sukha), pain (dukkha), and neutral(adukkhamasukha).Atthasàlinã explains them as follows:—The term sukha means ‘pleasurable feeling’(sukkhavedanà), ‘root of happiness’ (sukha-måla), ‘pleas-urable object’ (sukhàrammaõa), ‘cause of happiness’(sukhahetu), ‘conditioning state of pleasure’ (sukhapacca-yatthàna), ‘free from troubles’ (abyàpajjhà), ‘Nibbàna’, etc.In the expression: “By eliminating sukha” — sukhameans pleasurable feeling.In the expression: “Sukha is non-attachment in thisworld”. Here sukha means root of pleasure.In the expression: “Since, O Mahàli, form is sukha,falls and descends on sukha”. Here sukha means object ofpleasure.“Merit, O Bhikkhus, is a synonym for sukha.” Heresukha means cause of pleasure.“Not easy. is it, O Bhikkhus, to attain to heavenlysukha by description”. “ They know not sukha who do notsee Nandana”. Here sukha means conditioning state ofpleasure.“ These states constitute a sukha life in this veryworld”. Here sukha means freedom from troubles."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"172“Nibbàna is supreme sukha”. Here sukha meansNibbàna.From these quotations the reader can understand inwhat different senses the term sukha is used in the texts.In this particular connection the term sukha is used in thesense of pleasurable feeling.Nibbàna is stated to be supreme bliss (sukha). Thisdoes not mean that there is a pleasurable feeling in Nib-bàna although the term sukha is used. Nibbàna is a bliss ofrelief. The release from suffering is itself Nibbànic bliss.The term dukkha means ‘painful feeling’, ‘basis ofpain’, ‘object of pain,’ ‘cause of pain,’ ‘conditioning state ofpain,’ etc.“By eliminating dukkha”—here dukkha means pain-ful feeling.“Birth too is dukkha”—here dukkha means basis ofpain.“Since, O Mahali, form is dukkha, falls and descendson pain”—here dukkha means object of dukkha.“Accumulation of evil is dukkha” — here dukkhameans cause of pain.“It is not easy, O Bhikkhus, to realise the pain of woe-ful states by description”—here dukkha means “condition-ing states of pain.”In this particular connection the term dukkha is usedin the sense of painful feeling.In the Dhammacakka Sutta the Buddha enumerateseight divisions of dukkha—namely,"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"1731. Birth is suffering, 2. decay is suffering, 3. disease issuffering, 4. death is suffering, 5. association with theunpleasant is suffering, 6. separation from the beloved is suf-fering, 7. when one does not obtain what one desires thereis suffering, 8. in brief the Five Aggregates are suffering.All these are the causes of dukkha.When the Buddha addresses Devas and men Hespeaks of eight kinds of dukkha. When He addresses onlymen He speaks of twelve. Instead of vyàdhi (disease) Hesays soka (grief), parideva (lamentation), dukkha (pain),domanassa (displeasure) upàyàsa (despair) are suffering.All these five are included in vyàdhi which embraces bothphysical and mental disharmony.Soka, domanassa, and upàyàsa are mental, whiledukkha and parideva are physical.Practically there is no marked difference between thetwo formulas.Adukkha—m—asukha is that which is neither painnor happiness. It is a neutral feeling. This corresponds toboth stolid indifference and Stoic indifference. The Pàliterm upekkhà, which has a wider connotation, is more fre-quently used to denote this kind of neutral feeling.In an immoral type of consciousness upekkhà assumesthe role of stolid indifference because it is prompted byignorance. In an ahetuka resultant consciousness, such as asense-impression, upekkhà means simple neutral feelingwhich has no ethical value. Adukkha-m-asukha strictlyapplies in this connection.

It is both ethical and intel-lectual.According to a still wider, classification vedanà isfivefold—namely,(i)Sukha (physical happiness),(ii) Somanassa (mental pleasure),(iii) Dukkha (physical pain),(iv) Domanassa (mental displeasure),(v) Upekkhà (indifference, equanimity, feeling).All feelings, from an ultimate standpoint, are mental be-cause vedanà is a cetasika. But a differentiation has beenmade with regard to sukha and dukkha.Of all the 89 types of consciousness only two areassociated with either sukha or dukkha. One is the body-consciousness associated with happiness, and the other isbody-consciousness associated with pain.Both these are the resultant types of consciousness,effects of good and evil Kamma.A soft touch, for instance, yields happiness. A pin prick,on the contrary, yields pain. In these cases one experiencesthe aforesaid two types of consciousness respectively."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"175Now a question arises—Why only the body-consciousness is associated with happiness and pain? Whynot the other sense-impressions?Mr. Aung provides an answer in his introductoryessay to the Compendium:—“The sense of touch alone is accompanied by the positivehedonic elements of pain and pleasure; the other foursenses are accompanied by hedonic indifference. Thisexceptional distinction is assigned to the sense of touch,because the impact between the sentient surface (pasàdaråpa) and the respective objects of other senses, both sets ofwhich are secondary qualities of body, is not strong enoughto produce physical pain or pleasure. But in the case oftouch there is contact with one or other, or all the three pri-mary qualities (locality—pañhavi, temperature—tejo, pres-sure—vàyo) and this is strong enough to affect those pri-mary qualities in the percipient’s own body. Just as cottonwool on the anvil does not affect the latter, but a hammerstriking cotton wool imparts its check to the anvil also.”(Compendium of Philosophy p. 14).In the case of touch the impact is strong. The “essentials”,pañhavi, tejo, and vàyo (extension, heat, and motion)—àpo, cohesion, is excluded being intangible—forcibly anddirectly strike against the essentials of the body. Conse-quently there is either pain or happiness.In the case of seeing, hearing, smelling, and tasting,there is a bare impact. The consequent feeling is neither"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"176pain nor happiness.Although these sense-impressions may be sukha,dukkha, or upekkhà the javana thought-processes condi-tioned thereby may not necessarily be associated with asimilar feeling.For instance, the Buddha experienced a body-consciousness associated with pain when a rock splinter struckHis foot, but His javana thought-process conditioned therebywould not necessarily be associated with displeasure. Un-affected by the pain, He would have experienced perfect equa-nimity. The immanent feeling in the stream of consciousnesswould have been upekkhà. Similarly at the sight of the Buddhaa right-understanding person would automatically experiencean eye-consciousness associated with indifference (upekkhà-sahagata cakkhu-vi¤¤àõa), but his javana thought would bemoral. The innate feeling would be pleasure (somanassa).This intricate point should be clearly understood.Somanassa (good-mindedness) and domanassa(bad-mindedness) are purely mental.These five kinds of feeling could be reduced to three,the three to two, and the two to one as follows:i.sukha+somanassa ; upekkhà; dukkha + domanassaii.sukha; upekkhà; dukkhaiii.  sukha  dukkhaiv.  dukkha(Upekkhà is merged in sukha, and sukha is ultimately mergedin dukkha)."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"1774.Sukha—physical happiness should be differ-entiated from somanassa—mental pleasure. So shoulddukkha—physical pain—be differentiated from doma-nassa—mental displeasure. There is only one conscious-ness accompanied by sukha. Similarly there is only oneaccompanied by dukkha. Both of them are the effects ofgood and bad actions respectively.When the Buddha, for instance, was injured byDevadatta Thera He experienced a body-consciousnessaccompanied by pain. This was the result of a past evilaction of His. When we sit on a comfortable seat we expe-rience a body-consciousness accompanied by happiness.This is the result of a past good action. All forms of physi-cal pain and happiness are the inevitable results of ourown Kamma.5.Readers will note that pleasurable types of con-sciousness exceed all others. As such during a lifetime a per-son experiences more happy moments than painful ones.This does not contradict the statement that life is sorrow(dukkha).

This type of consciousness is inAbhidhamma termed bhavaïga. Like any other conscious-ness it also consists of three aspects—genesis (uppàda),static (ñhiti) and cessation (bhaïga). Arising and perishingevery moment it flows on like a stream not remaining thesame for two consecutive moments.When an object enters this stream through the sense-doors, the bhavaïga consciousness is arrested and anothertype of consciousness appropriate to the object perceivedarises. Not only in a dreamless state but also in our wakingstate we experience bhavaïga thought-moments morethan any other types of consciousness. Hence bhavaïgabecomes an indispensable condition of life.Mrs. Rhys Davids and Mr. âung compare bhavaïgato “Leibniz’s state of obscure perception, not amounting toconsciousness, in dreamless sleep.”One cannot agree because bhavaïga is a type of con-sciousness. There is no obscure perception here.Some identify bhavaïga with sub-consciousness.According to the Dictionary of Philosophy sub-consciousnessis “a compartment of the mind alleged by certain psycholo-gists and philosophers to exist below the threshold of con-sciousness.” In the opiõion of Western philosophers sub-consciousness and consciousness coexist. According toAbhidhamma no two types of consciousness coexist. Nor isbhavaïga a sub-plane.The Compendium further states that “bhavaïga de-"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"190notes a functional state (or moment) of sub-consciousness.As such it is the sub-conscious state of mind—‘below thethreshold’ of consciousness—by which we conceive contin-uous subjective existence as possible.

Strictly speaking, itdoes not correspond to subliminal consciousness either.There does not seem to be any place for bhavaïga inWestern Psychology.Bhavaïga is so called because it is an essential condi-tion for continued subjective existence.Whenever the mind does not receive a fresh exter-nal object, one experiences a bhavaïga consciousness.88Immediately after a thought-process, too, there is a bha-vaïga consciousness.

The mental states occurring in all these thought-moments are similar, but the potential force differs.When the consciousness perceives a vivid object usu-ally seven moments of javana arise in the particularthought-process. In the case of death or when the Buddhaperforms the Twin Psychic Phenomenon (Yamaka Pàñihà-riya) only five thought-moments arise. In the Supramun-dane javana process the Path-consciousness arises only forone moment.This javana stage is the most important from an eth-ical standpoint. It is at this psychological stage that goodor evil is actually done. Irrespective of the desirability orthe undesirability of the object presented to the mind, onecan make the javana process good or bad. If, for instance,one meets an enemy, a thought of hatred will arise almostautomatically. A wise and forbearing person might, on thecontrary, harbour a thought of love towards him.

Theformer means a name or term such as chair, table, etc., thelatter means the object or idea conveyed thereby.73.What is time? Strictly speaking, it is a mere con-cept which does not exist in an absolute sense. On theother hand what space is to matter, time is to mind.Conventionally we speak of past (atãta), present(paccuppanna), and future (anàgata).Past is defined as that which has gone beyond its ownstate or the moments of genesis, development, and cessa-tion (attano sabhàvaü uppàdàdikkhaõaü và atãtà atikkantàatãtà).Present is that which on account of this and that rea-son enters, goes, exists above the moments of genesis etc.(taü taü kàraõaü pañicca uppàdàdikkhaõaü uddhaüpannà, gatà, pavattà == paccuppannà).Future is that which has not yet reached both states(tadubhayam’ pi na àgatà sampattà).According to Abhidhamma each consciousness con-sists of three phases—uppàda (genesis), ñhiti (develop-ment), and bhaïga (dissolution or cessation). In the viewof some commentators there is no intermediate ñhiti stagebut only the stages of arising and passing away. Eachthought-moment is followed by another. Time is thus the"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"216sine qua non of the succession of mental states. The funda-mental unit of time is the duration of a thought-moment.Commentators say that the rapidity of these fleetingthought-moments is such that within the brief duration ofa flash of lightning there may be billions of thought-moments.Matter, which also constantly changes, endures onlyfor seventeen thought-moments, being the time durationfor one thought-process.Past is gone. Future has not come. We live only forone thought-moment and that slips into the irrevocablepast. In one sense there is only the eternal now. In an-other sense the so-called present is the transitional stagefrom the future to the past.The Dictionary of Philosophy defines time “as thegeneral medium in which all events take place in succes-sion or appear to take place in succession”.Atthasàlinã states that time is a concept derived fromthis or that phenomenon. And it does not exist by nature,it is merely a concept. (Taü taü upàdàya pa¤¤atto kàlonàma.

The moral or immoral consciousness, experienced atthe particular moment, arises now as a fresh conscious-ness. This is technically known as ‘Kamma’.Being a thought, it is a dhammàrammaõa graspedthrough the mind-door, and is past.The object of the pañisandhi, bhavaõga, and cuticlasses of consciousness of the subsequent life is thisdhammàrammaõa.At times it may be a sign or symbol associated with thegood or bad action.

Here avat-thuka means objectless, without a thing or substance.Vatthu is the seat of sense-organs.There are six seats or physical bases corresponding tothe six senses.These will be fully described in the chapter on Råpa.94.The indeclinable particle ‘pi’ (too) in the textindicates that there is an exception in the case of thosewho are born blind, deaf, dumb, etc.95.The organs exist, but not their sensory facultiesas beings in these higher planes have temporarily inhibitedthe desire for sensual pleasures (kàmaràga) They possesseye and ear so that they may utilise them for good pur-poses.

The commen-tary gives an account of the eye, of which the following isthe substance: First the aggregate organism (sasambhàra-cakkhu). A ball of flesh fixed in a cavity, bound by thesocket-bone beneath and by the bone of the eyebrow above,by the angles of the eye at the sides, by the brain within andby the eyelashes without. There are fourteen constituents:the four elements, the six attributes dependent on them,viz., colour, odour, taste, sap of life, form (sanñhànaü), andcollocation (sambhavo); vitality, nature, body-sensibility(kàyappasàdo), and the visual sentient organ. The last fourhave their source in karma. When ‘the world’, seeing anobvious extended white object fancies it perceives the eye,it only perceives the basis (or seat—vatthu) of the eye Andthis ball of flesh, bound to the brain by nerve-fibres, iswhite, black and red, and contains the solid, the liquid, thelambent and the gaseous. It is white by superfluity ofhumour, black by superfluity of bile, red by superfluity ofblood, rigid by superfluity of the solid, exuding by superflu-ity of the liquid, inflamed by superfluity of the lambent,quivering by superfluity of the gaseous. But that sentientorgan (pasàdo) which is there bound, inherent, derivedfrom the four great principles—this is the visual sense(pasàda-cakkhu).

Hadayavatthu—heart-base.According to the commentators hadayavatthu is the seat ofconsciousness. Tradition says that within the cavity of theheart there is some blood, and depending on which lies theseat of consciousness. It was this cardiac theory that pre-vailed in the Buddha’s time, and this was evidently sup-ported by the Upanishads.The Buddha could have adopted this popular theory,but He did not commit Himself.Mr. Aung in his Compendium argues that the Buddhawas silent on this point. He did not positively assert thatthe seat of consciousness was either in the heart or in thebrain. In the Dhammasaïganã the term hadayavatthu haspurposely been omitted. In the Paññhàna, instead of usinghadaya as the seat of consciousness, the Buddha has sim-ply stated ‘yaü råpaü nissàya’—depending on that ‘råpa’.Mr. Aung’s opinion is that the Buddha did not want toreject the popular theory. Nor did He advance a new the-ory that brain is the seat of consciousness as is regarded bymodern scientists.See Buddhist Psychology—Introduction lxxviii, andCompendium of Philosophy, pp. 277–279."},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"22999.

The time-limit of such a consciousness is termedone thought-moment. The rapidity of the succession ofsuch thought-moments is hardly conceivable by the ken ofhuman knowledge. Books state that within the brief dura-tion of a flash of lightning, or in the twinkling of an eye bil-lions of thought-moments may arise and perish.Each thought-moment consists of three minor instants(khaõas). They are uppàda (arising or genesis), ñhiti (staticor development), and bhaïga (cessation or dissolution).Birth, decay, and death98 correspond to these threestates. The interval between birth and death is regarded asdecay.Immediately after the cessation stage of a thought-moment there results the genesis stage of the subsequentthought-moment. Thus each unit of consciousness per-ishes conditioning another, transmitting at the same timeall its potentialities to its successor. There is, therefore, a98.These three stages correspond to the Hindu view of Brahma (Creator), Vishnu (Preserver) and Siva (Destroyer)."},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"241continuous flow of consciousness like a stream withoutany interruption.When a material object is presented to the mindthrough one of the five sense-doors, a thought-processoccurs, consisting of a series of separate thought-momentsleading one to the other in a particular, uniform order. Thisorder is known as the citta-niyàma (psychic order). As arule for a complete perception of a physical object throughone of the sense-doors precisely 17 thought-moments mustpass. As such the time duration of matter is fixed at 17thought-moments. After the expiration of that time-limit,one fundamental unit of matter perishes giving birth toanother unit. The first moment is regarded as the genesis(uppàda), the last as dissolution (bhaïga), and the interval15 moments as decay or development (ñhiti or jarà).As a rule when an object enters the consciousnessthrough any of the doors one moment of the life-continuum elapses. This is known as atãta-bhavaïga. Thenthe corresponding thought-process runs uninterruptedlyfor 16 thought-moments. The object thus presented isregarded as ‘very great’.If the thought-process ceases at the expiration ofjavanas without giving rise to two retentive moments(tadàlambana), thus completing only 14 moments, thenthe object is called ‘great’.Sometimes the thought-process ceases at themoment of determining (votthapana) without giving riseto the javanas, completing only 7 thought-moments.

Then theobject is termed ‘very slight’.When a so-called ‘very great’ or ‘great’ object, per-ceived through the five sense-doors, is subsequently con-ceived by the mind-door, or when a thought process aris-ing through the mind-door extends up to the retentivestage, then the object is regarded as ‘clear’.When a thought-process, arising through the mind-door, ceases at the javana stage, the object is termed ‘obscure.’When, for instance, a person looks at the radiantmoon on a cloudless night, he gets a faint glimpse of thesurrounding stars as well. He focuses his attention on themoon, but he cannot avoid the sight of stars around. Themoon is regarded as a great object, while the stars areregarded as minor objects. Both moon and stars are per-ceived by the mind at different moments.

Here, under all circumstances (i.e., in both sense-door and mind-door) when an object (12) is undesirable,the five sense-impressions, reception, investigation, reten-tion (that arise) are immoral resultants. If desirable, theyare moral resultants. If the object is extremely desirable,investigation and retention are accompanied by pleasure.In this connection, at the end of functional javanasaccompanied by pleasure, there arise retentive thought-moments also accompanied by pleasure. At the end of func-tional javanas, accompanied by equanimity, the retentivethought-moments are also accompanied by equanimity.But at the end of javanas, accompanied by displeas-ure, the retentive thought-moments and the bhavaïgasare also accompanied by indifference. Hence to one whoserebirth-consciousness is accompanied by pleasure, at theend of javanas, accompanied by displeasure, retentivethought-moments do not arise. Then, there arises an inves-"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"252tigating consciousness, accompanied by indifference,hanging on to some sense-object with which one is familiarbefore. Immediately after, the teachers say, there is subsid-ence into the life-continuum.Likewise they expect retention at the end of Sense-sphere javanas to the Sense-sphere beings only whenSense-sphere phenomena become objects.§ 10. Retention occurs, they say, in connection with‘clear’ and ‘very great’ objects when there is certainty asregards the Sense-sphere javanas, beings, and objects.Herein this is the procedure of retention._______Notes:12. Objects—ArammanaThe desirability or undesirability of an object is deter-mined not according to individual temperament, butaccording to its intrinsic nature. The resultant conscious-ness conditioned thereby is regarded as the effect of one’sgood or bad action.The sight of the Buddha will perhaps be repulsive toa staunch heretic. His javana thoughts will naturally beunwholesome. But the passive wholesome resultant eye-consciousness, caused by a past good kamma, is a kusalavipàka. This vipàka is not conditioned by his will, but is aninevitable consequence. The javana process, on the con-trary, is conditioned by his own will."},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"253Again, for instance, the mere sight of excreta will bea source of delight to an ordinary dog. The object is gener-ally undesirable and is a bad effect (akusala vipàka), butthe javana process caused thereby will be wholesome to thedog. The accompanying feeling will also be pleasurable.Although even an Arahant experiences an akusalavipàka at the sight of an undesirable object, his javanaprocess will neither be wholesome nor unwholesome. Theaccompanying feeling will be one of equanimity.Now, when an undesirable object is presented eitherthrough the mind-door or five sense-doors, the sense-impressions, reception, investigation, retention that occurin the respective thought-processes, are all bad effects(akusala vipàkas). The accompanying feeling is invariablyupekkhà, except in the case of body-impression which isdukkha. These thought-moments are the inevitable resultsof past bad actions.If the presented object is desirable, then the aforesaidthought-moments are all good effects (kusala vipàkas).Here too the accompanying feeling is upekkhà, except inthe case of body-impression which is sukha. All thesethought-moments are the results of past good actions.When the object is extremely desirable, the feeling ofthe santãraõa moment differs. Instead of upekkhà it issomanassa.The tadàrammaõas followed by Sense-sphere func-tional javanas, accompanied by pleasure, are also associ-ated with a similar feeling. Likewise the upekkhà javanas"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"254are followed by upekkhà tadàrammaõas.As a rule the preceding javanas and the subsequenttadàrammaõas possess a similar feeling. Somanassa is fol-lowed by somanassa, and upekkhà by upekkhà.What happens when the javanas are accompanied bydomanassa as there are no domanassa tadàrammaõas?If the rebirth-consciousness (pañisandhi-citta) of theperson is accompanied by somanassa, then there will beno tadàrammaõas, as the bhavaïga that immediately fol-lows is also accompanied by somanassa. In that case anadventitious upekkhà santãraõa, without any special func-tion, merely intervenes for one moment. This adventitiousthought-moment is technically termed àgaïtukabha-vaïga. Usually the object of the javanas and that of thetadàrammanas are identical. But in this particular case theobjects differ. The object of this santãraõa is another kàmà-vacara object with which one is familiar in the course ofone’s life. This object is termed paritta (smaller or lesser)in comparison with the higher råpa, aråpa and lokuttaraobjects.If, on the other hand, the rebirth-consciousness is notassociated with somanassa, then the tadàrammaõas be-come upekkhà as are the bhavaïgas that follow.It should be noted that tadàrammanas occur only, atthe end of kàmàvacara javanas, only to kàmàvacarabeings, and only in connection with kàmàvacara objects,which are either ‘very intense’ or ‘clear’._______"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"255Javana—Niyamo_______§ 11.

Thereafter two or three Fruit thought-moments arise accordingly. Then comes subsidence intolife-continuum.At the time of Supreme Cessation (14) the fourtharåpa javana runs twice and then contacts Cessation. Whenemerging (from this ecstasy) either Anàgami Fruit-consciousness or Arahatta Fruit-consciousness arises accord-ingly.

Ani-mals are so called because as a rule quadrupeds walk hor-izontally. Buddhist belief is that beings are born as animalson account of evil Kamma. There is, however, the possibil-ity for animals to be born as human beings. Strictly speak-ing, it should be said that an animal may manifest itself inthe form of a human being, or vice versa just as an electriccurrent can be manifested in the forms of light, heat, andmotion successively—one not necessarily being evolvedfrom the other. An animal may be born in a blissful stateas a result of the good Kamma accumulated in the past.There are at times certain animals, particularly dogs andcats, who live a more comfortable life than even humanbeings. It is also due to their past good Kamma.It is one’s Kamma that determines the nature of one’smaterial form which varies according to the skill or unskil-fulness of one’s actions. And this again depends entirely onthe evolution of one’s understanding of reality.8.Peta = pa + ita: lit., departed beings, or(those) absolutely devoid of happiness. They are not dis-embodied spirits or ghosts. Although they possess materialforms generally they are invisible to the physical eye.

According to thejhàna factors that involve ecstasy it is fivefold.121. Of these ten, vi and vii are included in generosity (dàna), iv, and v in morality (sãla), viii, ix and x in meditation (bhàvanà)."},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"287Similarly moral Kamma of the aråpa-plane is mentalaction, and is also caused by meditation.

But during lifetime all thetwelve take effect (44).The seven unwholesome resultants are experiencedanywhere in the kàma plane and the råpa plane accordingto circumstances.Moral Kamma (45), of the kàma-plane produces re-birth in the blissful kàma-plane. Similarly the eight Great re-sultants (are experienced) during lifetime. The eight (whole-some) rootless resultants are experienced anywhere in thekàma plane and råpa-plane according to circumstances.Therein the highest moral Kamma (46) accompaniedby three roots, produces rebirth similarly accompanied bythe three roots. During lifetime it gives effect to sixteenkinds of resultants.124Moral Kamma, accompanied by three roots of alower class (47) and by two roots of a higher class, produc-es rebirth with two roots, and gives effect to twelve result-ants, excluding those with three roots, during lifetime.But moral Kamma, accompanied by two roots of alower class, produces rebirth without roots, and giveseffect to rootless resultants during lifetime.122.See Ch, I.123.Uddhacca is too weak to produce rebirth.124.

As regards moral Kamma of the råpa-plane, thosewho develop the first jhàna to a minor degree are bornamongst the Brahma’s Retinue. Developing the same to aMedium degree, they are born amongst the Brahma’s Min-isters.

Developing them to a medium degree, theyare born amongst gods of Infinite Lustre. Developing themto a high degree, they are born amongst the Radiant gods.Developing the fourth jhàna to a minor degree, theyare born amongst the gods of Minor Aura.

Thus sublimated merit, determined according tospheres, produces similar results (both) at rebirth and inone’s lifetime.Herein this is the fourfold Kamma._______Notes:—29. Kamma, Saüskrt Karma, lit., means action ordoing. Strictly speaking, Kamma means all moral andimmoral volition (cetanà). It covers all that is included inthe phrase—‘thought, word and deed’. It, is the law ofmoral causation. In other words, it is action and reactionin the ethical realm, or ‘action influence’ as Westernerssay. It is not fate or predestination. It is ones own doingreacting on oneself.Every volitional action, except that of a Buddha or ofan Arahant, is called Kamma. The Buddhas and Arahantsdo not accumulate fresh Kamma as they have eradicatedignorance and craving, the roots of Kamma."},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"290Kamma is action and Vipàka, fruit or result, is itsreaction. It is the cause and the effect. Like a seed isKamma. Vipàka (effect) is like the fruit arising from thetree. As we sow, we reap somewhere and sometime in thislife or in a future birth. What we reap today is what wehave sown either in the present or in the past.Kamma is a law in itself, and it operates in its ownfield without the intervention of an external, independentruling agency.Inherent in Kamma is the potentiality of producing itsdue effect. The cause produces the effect; the effect explainsthe cause. The seed produces the effect; the fruit explainsthe seed; such is their relationship. Even so are Kamma andits effect; “the effect already blooms in the cause.”According to Abhidhamma, Kamma constitutes thetwelve types of immoral consciousness, eight types ofmoral consciousness pertaining to the Sense-sphere(kàmàvacara), five types of moral consciousness pertain-ing to the realms of Forms (råpàvacara), and four types ofmoral consciousness pertaining to the Formless realms(aråpàvacara).The eight types of supramundane consciousness(Lokuttara Citta) are not regarded as Kamma and Vipàka,because they tend to eradicate the roots of Kamma thatcondition rebirth. In the supramundane consciousnesswisdom (pa¤¤à) is predominant, while in the ordinarytypes of consciousness volition (cetanà) is predominant.These twenty-nine types of consciousness are called"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"291Kamma because the reproductive power is inherent inthem. Just as every object is accompanied by a shadow,even so every volitional activity is accompanied by its dueeffect.These types of consciousness that are experiencedas inevitable consequence of good and bad thoughts arecalled resultant consciousness (vipaka). The 23 types(7 + 8 + 8) of resultant consciousness pertaining to theSense-sphere, the five types of resultant consciousnesspertaining to the realms of Form, and the four types ofresultant consciousness pertaining to the Formlessrealms, are called vipaka or fruition of Kamma.See ‘The Life of the Buddha and his Teachings’,pp. 129–133 and ‘Manual of Buddhism’, pp. 79–88.30.Every birth is conditioned by a past good or badKamma which predominates at the moment of death. TheKamma that conditions the future birth is called Reproduc-tive (Janaka) Kamma.The death of a person is merely “the temporary endof a temporary phenomenon”. Though the present formperishes another form which is neither the same nor abso-lutely different takes place according to the potentialthought-vibrations generated at the death moment, as theKammic force which propels the life-flux still survives. It isthis last thought, which is technically called ReproductiveKamma, that determines the state of a person in his sub-sequent birth. This may be either a good or bad Kamma."},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"292According to the commentary Janaka Kamma is thatwhich produces mental aggregates and material aggre-gates at the moment of conception. The initial conscious-ness which is termed the pañisandhi vi¤¤àõa (rebirth-consciousness) is conditioned by this Janaka Kamma.Simultaneous with the arising of the rebirth consciousnessthere arise the ‘body-decad’, ‘sex-decad’, and ‘base-decad’(kàya-bhava-vatthu dasaka).The body-decad is composed of the four elements—namely, the element of extension (pàñhavi), the element ofcohesion (àpo), the element of heat (tejo), the element ofmotion (vàyo); its four derivatives (upàdà råpa)—namely,colour (vaõõa), odour (gandha), taste (rasa), nutritiveessence (ojà), vitality (jãvitindriya), and body (kàya). Sex-decad and base-decad also consist of the first nine and sex(bhàva) and seat of consciousness (vatthu) respectively.From this it is evident that the sex is determined atthe very conception of a being. It is conditioned by Kammaand is not a fortuitous combination of sperm and ovumcells. Pain and happiness, one experiences in the course ofone’s lifetime, are the inevitable consequences of JanakaKamma.31. Upatthambhaka—that which comes near theReproductive Kamma and supports it. It is either good orbad and it assists or maintains the action of the Reproduc-tive Kamma in the course of one’s lifetime.

Amoral supportive Kamma assists in giving health, wealth,happiness, etc., to the person concerned. An immoral Sup-portive Kamma, on the other hand, assists in giving pain,sorrow, etc., to the person born with an immoral reproduc-tive Kamma as, for instance, to a beast of burden.32. Upapãóaka—Obstructive or CounteractiveKamma which, unlike the former, tends to weaken, inter-rupt and retard the fruition of the Reproductive Kamma.For instance, a person born with a good ReproductiveKamma may be subject to various ailments etc., thus pre-venting him from enjoying the blissful results of his goodaction. An animal, on the other hand, who is born with abad Reproductive Kamma, may lead a comfortable life bygetting good food, lodging, etc., as a result of his goodCounteractive Kamma preventing the fruition of the evilReproductive Kamma.33. Upaghàtaka—According to the Law of Kammathe potential energy of the Reproductive Kamma could benullified by a more powerful opposing Kamma of the past,which, seeking an opportunity, may quite unexpectedlyoperate, just as a counteractive powerful force canobstruct the path of a flying arrow and bring it down to theground. Such an action is called Destructive Kamma whichis more effective than the previous two in that it not onlyobstructs but also destroys the whole force. This Destruc-tive Kamma also may be either good or bad."},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"294As an instance of the operation of all four, the case ofDevadatta, who attempted to kill the Buddha and whocaused a schism in the Sangha, may be cited. His goodReproductive Kamma conditioned him a birth in a royalfamily. His continued comforts and prosperity were due tothe action of the Supportive Kamma. The counteractiveKamma came into operation when he was subject to muchhumiliation as a result of his being excommunicated fromthe Sangha. Finally the Destructive Kamma brought his lifeto a miserable end.34. Garuka—which means either weighty or seri-ous, may be either good or bad. It produces its results inthis life or in the next for certain. If good, it is purely men-tal as in the case of the Jhànas. Otherwise it is verbal orbodily. The five kinds of Weighty Kamma according totheir gravity are:— (i) The creation of a schism in theSangha, (ii) The wounding of a Buddha, (iii) The murderof an Arahant, (iv) matricide, and (v) parricide.These are also known as ânantariya Kamma becausethey definitely produce their effects in the subsequent life.Permanent Scepticism (niyata micchàdiññhi) is also termedone of the weighty Kammas.If, for instance, any person were to develop the jhà-nas and later were to commit one of these heinous crimes,his good Kamma would be obliterated by the powerful evilKamma. His subsequent birth will be conditioned by theevil Kamma in spite of his having gained the jhànas earlier."},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"295Devadatta lost his psychic powers and was born in an evilstate, because he wounded the Buddha and caused aschism in the Sangha.King Ajàtasattu would have attained the first stage ofSainthood if he had not committed parricide. In this casethe powerful evil Kamma acted as an obstacle to his gain-ing Sainthood.35. âsanna or Death-proximate Kamma is thatwhich one does or remembers immediately before thedying moment. Owing to its significance in determiningthe future birth, the custom of reminding the dying personof his good deeds and making him do good acts on hisdeath-bed still prevails in Buddhist countries.Sometimes a bad person may die happily and receivea good birth if fortunately he remembers or does a good actat the last moment. A story runs that a certain executioner,who casually happened to give some alms to the VenerableSàriputta, remembered this good act at the dying momentand was born in a state of bliss. This does not mean thatalthough he enjoys a good birth he will be exempt from theeffects of the evil deeds accumulated during his lifetime.They will have their due effects as occasions arise.At times a good person may die unhappily by sud-denly remembering an evil act of his or by harbouringsome unpleasant thought, perchance compelled by un-favourable circumstances.

Such reversechanges of birth account for the birth of virtuous childrento vicious parents and of vicious children to virtuous par-ents. As a rule the last thought-process is conditioned bythe general conduct of a person.36. âciõõa Kamma is that which one habituallyperforms and recollects and for which one has a greatliking.Habits whether good or bad become second nature.They tend to form the character of a person. At leisuremoments we often engage ourselves in our habitualthoughts and deeds. In the same way at the death-moment,unless influenced by other circumstances, we, as a rule,recall to mind such thoughts and deeds.Cunda, a butcher, who was living in the vicinity ofthe Buddha’s monastery, died squealing like a pig becausehe was earning his living by slaughtering pigs.King Duññhagàmani of Ceylon was in the habit of giv-ing alms to the Bhikkhus before he took his meals. It wasthis habitual Kamma that gladdened him at the dyingmoment and gave him birth in Tusita Realm.37. Kañattà—Reserve or Cumulative Kamma. Liter-ally, it means ‘because done’.

The effect of the first thought-moment,being the weakest, one may reap in this life itself. This iscalled the Immediately Effective Kamma. If it does notoperate in this life, it is called Defunct or Ineffective(Ahosi). The next weakest is the seventh thought-moment.Its evil effect one may reap in the subsequent birth. This iscalled Upapajjavedanãya Kamma. This, too, becomes inef-fective if it does not operate in the second birth. The effectsof the intermediate thought-moments may take place atany time until one attains Nibbàna. This type of Kamma isknown as Aparàparãyavedanãya—Indefinitely Effective.

Procedure with regard to Decease and Rebirth_______§ 11. The advent of death (51) is fourfold—namely,(i) through the expiration of the age-limit (52),(ii) through the expiration of the (Reproductive) Kammicforce (53) (iii) through the (simultaneous) expiration ofboth (54), and (iv) through (the intervention of a)Destructive Kamma (55).Now, to those who, are about to die, at the momentof death, by the power of Kamma, one of the followingpresents itself through any of the six doors:—i.A Kamma that produces rebirth in the subse-"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"303quent birth enters (the mind-door) according to circum-stances (56).ii.An object (57) such as a pre-perceived formand the like, or anything that was instrumental in the per-formance of the Kamma.iii.A symbolic destiny sign (58) that should be gotand experienced in the subsequent birth-place.Thereafter attending to that object thus presented (59),the stream of consciousness, in accordance with theKamma that is to be matured whether pure or corrupted,and in conformity with the place where one is to be born,continually flows, inclining mostly towards that state. Orthat birth-reproductive Kamma presents itself to a sense-door in the way of renewing.§ 12. To one who is nearing death, either at the end of athought-process or at the dissolution of bhavaïga, thedecease-consciousness, the consummation of the presentlife, arises and ceases in the way of death.At the end of the cessation, immediately after which,based on the object thus obtained, whether with heart-base (60) or not, rebirth-consciousness arises and is estab-lished in the subsequent existence, enveloped accordinglyby latent ignorance, rooted in latent craving, produced byaction (Kamma), conjoined with mental co-adjuncts, act-ing as the forerunner to the coexisting states, and linkingthe existences."},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"304§ 13. Herein in the dying thought-process only fivefeeble moments125 of javana should be expected.Therefore when death occurs while the present ob-ject is being presented to the avenues (i.e., Kamma nimittato one of the five sense-doors or gati nimitta to the mind-door) then the rebirth-consciousness and the bhavaïga-consciousness take a present object.Thus in rebirth in a Sense-Sphere the Kamma nimittataken by (any of) the six doors, or gati nimitta may be pastor present.But Kamma is perceived by the mind-door only as apast object.All these should be regarded as lesser objects (i.e.,belonging to the Kàma-sphere).In rebirth in the realms of Forms the Kamma symbolwhich is a concept (such as earth device etc.) becomes theobject.So, too, in rebirth in Formless realms, only a Kammasymbol which is a sublimated concept (such as a visualised‘space’) becomes an object, according to circumstances.To the mindless beings only the vital ‘nonad’126establishes itself in the way of rebirth. Hence they arecalled materially-reborn. Those born in Formless realmsare called mentally reborn. The rest are called materiallyand mentally reborn.125. Normally seven thought-moments.126. Namely, the four elements of extension, cohesion, heat, motion (pathavi, àpo, tejo, và yo), the four derivatives—colour, odour. taste, nutritive essence (vanna, gandha, rasa, oja), and physical life principle (jãvitindriya.)"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"305§ 14. After one passes away from a Formless realm, oneis similarly born in a Formless realm, but not in a lowerFormless plane, and also in the Sense-Sphere with threeroots.When one passes from a realm of Form, one is notborn without the three roots. After a birth with the threeroots one seeks rebirth in all states. The rest (namely,those with two roots and no roots) are reborn, in theSense-Spheres.Herein this is the procedure with regard to deceaseand rebirth._______Notes:—51.“Death is the temporary end of a temporaryphenomenon.” By death is meant the extinction of psychiclife (jãvitindriya), heat (usma = tejodhàtu), and conscious-ness (vi¤¤àõa) of one individual in a particular existence.Death is not the complete annihilation of a being. Death inone place means the birth in another place, just as, in con-ventional terms, the rising of the sun in one place meansthe setting of the sun in another place.52.What are commonly understood to be naturaldeaths due to old age may be classed under this category.To each of the various planes of existence is naturallyassigned a definite age-limit irrespective of the potentialenergy of the Reproductive Kamma that has yet to run.One must, however, succumb to death when the maximum"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"306age-limit is reached. It may also be said that if the Repro-ductive Kamma is extremely powerful, the Kammic energyrematerialises itself on the same plane or on some higherplane as in the case of the devas.53.As a rule the thought, volition, or desire whichwas extremely strong during lifetime becomes predomi-nant at the moment of death and conditions the subse-quent birth. In this last thought-moment is present aspecial potentiality. When the potential energy of thisReproductive Kamma is exhausted, the organic activitiesof the material form, in which is corporealised the life-force, cease even before the approach of old age.54.If a person is born at a time when the age-limitis 80 years and he dies at 80 owing to the exhaustion ofthe potential force of his reproductive Kamma, his deathis due to the simultaneous expiration of both age andKamma.55.There are powerful actions which suddenly cutoff the force of the Reproductive Kamma even before theexpiration of the life-term. A more powerful opposingforce, for instance, can check the path of a flying arrowand bring it down to the ground. Similarly, a very power-ful Kammic force of the past is capable of nullifying thepotential energy of the dying reproductive (janaka)thought-moment, and thus destroy the life of a being. The"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"307death of Devadatta was due to an upacchedaka Kammawhich he committed during his lifetime.The first three types of death are collectively calledkàlamaraõa (timely death), and the last one is known asakàlamaraõa (untimely death).An oil lamp, for instance, may be extinguished owingto any of the following four causes—namely, the exhaus-tion of the wick, the exhaustion of oil, simultaneousexhaustion of both wick and oil, and some extraneouscause like the gust of a wind. Death of a person may simi-larly be caused by any of the aforesaid four ways.56.As a person is about to die a good or bad actionmay present itself before his mind’s eye. It may be either ameritorious or a demeritorious Weighty action (GarukaKamma), such as jhànas (ecstasies) or parricide etc. Theyare so powerful that they totally eclipse all other actionsand appear very vividly before the mental eye. If there isno Weighty action, he may take for his object of the dyingthought a Kamma done or remembered immediately be-fore death (àsanna Kamma).If it is a past action, strictly speaking, it is the good orbad thought, experienced at the moment of performingthe action, that recurs at the death-moment.57. Kamma nimitta is any sight, sound, smell,taste, touch or idea which was obtained at the time of thecommission of the Kamma, such as knives in the case of a"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"308butcher, patients in the case of a physician, flowers in thecase of a devotee, etc.58.By gati nimitta is meant some sign of the placewhere he is to take birth, an event which invariably hap-pens to dying persons. When these indications of thefuture birth occur, and if they are bad, they can be turnedinto good. This is done by influencing the thoughts of thedying person, so that his good thoughts may now act as theproximate Kamma and counteract the influence of theReproductive Kamma which would otherwise affect hissubsequent birth.These symbols of one’s destiny may be hellish fires,forests, mountainous regions, mother’s womb, celestialmansions, etc.The Kamma is presented to the mind-door. Kamma-nimitta may be presented to any of the six doors accordingto circumstances. Gati-nimitta, being always a physicalsight, is presented to the mind-door as a dream.59.Taking one of the aforesaid objects, a thought-process runs its course even if the death be an instantane-ous one. It is said that even the fly which is crushed by ahammer on the anvil also experiences such a process ofthought before it actually dies.Let us imagine for the sake of convenience that thedying person is to be reborn in the human plane and thathis object is some good Kamma."},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"309His bhavaïga consciousness, interrupted, vibratesfor one thought-moment and passes away.

As such it lacks all reproduc-tive power, its main function being the mere regulation ofthe new existence—abhinavakaraõa.

The tadàlambana consciousness which hasfor its function a registering or identifying for twomoments of the object so perceived may or may not fol-low. After this occurs death consciousness (cuti citta), thelast thought-moment to be experienced in this present life.(See Diagram XI, p. 315).There is a misconception amongst some that the sub-sequent birth is conditioned by this last decease-thought.What actually conditions rebirth is not this decease-thought, which in itself has no special function to perform,but that which is experienced during the javana process.With the ceasing of the decease-consciousness deathactually occurs.

In one sense they form one complete book.The remaining four chapters are devoted to Råpa(matter), Nibbàna, Pañicca-Samuppàda (the Law ofDependent Arising), Paññhàna Naya (Causal Relations),Categories of good and evil, Mental Culture, Path ofPurity, and Great Attainments.The sixth chapter is confined mainly to Råpa andNibbàna.Twenty-eight species of Råpa are enumerated. Whatthey are, how they arise, persist, and perish are also ex-plained. Råpa is the third Paramattha mentioned in theAbhidhamma and is one of the two composite factors ofthis so-called being—the other being Nàma (mind). AsNàma, so Råpa too has been microscopically analysed. Butno logical definition of Råpa is found either in the Text orin the Commentaries.Råpa is derived from √rup, to break up, to perish(nàsa).According to the Vibhàvinã Tãkà, Råpa is that whichtransforms or assumes a different mode owing to the"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"318adverse physical conditions of cold, heat, etc. (sãtonhàdivirodhippaccayehi vikàraü àpajjati).From a Buddhist standpoint Råpa not only changesbut also perishes (khaya, vaya). It endures only for seven-teen thought-moments. Råpa changes so rapidly that onecannot strike an identical place twice.Råpa is also explained as that which manifests itself(√rup-pakàsane).Scholars suggest various renderings for Råpa. It isgenerally rendered by ‘form’, ‘body’, ‘matter’, ‘corporeal-ity’, etc. Meanings differ according to the context. One par-ticular meaning is not universally applicable.From a philosophical standpoint, ‘matter’ is the near-est equivalent for Råpa although scientists too find it diffi-cult to define matter.It should be noted that the atomic theory prevailed inIndia in the time of the Buddha. Paramàõu was the ancientterm for the modern atom. According to the ancient beliefone rathareõu consists of 16 tajjàris, one tajjàri, 16 aõus;one aõu, 16 paramàõus. The minute particles of dust seendancing in the sunbeam are called rathareõus. One para-màõu is, therefore, 4096th part of a rathareõu. This para-màõu was considered indivisible.With His supernormal knowledge the Buddha ana-lysed this so-called paramàõu and declared that it consistsof paramatthas—ultimate entities which cannot further besubdivided.The paramatthas are pañhavi, àpo, tejo, and vàyo. One"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"319must not understand that these elements are earth, water,fire and air as some Greek thinkers believed in the past.Pañhavi means the element of extension, the substra-tum of matter. Without it objects cannot occupy space. Thequalities of hardness and softness which are purely relativeare two conditions of this particular element. It may bestated that this element is present in earth, water, fire andair. For instance, the water above is supported by waterbelow. It is this element of extension in conjunction with theelement of motion that produces the upward pressure. Heator cold is the tejo element, while fluidity is the àpo element.âpo is the element of cohesion. Unlike pañhavi it isintangible. It is this element that makes scattered particlesof matter cohere and gives rise to the idea of ‘body’. Whensolid bodies are melted this element becomes more prom-inent in the resulting fluid. This element is found even inminute particles when solid bodies are reduced to powder.The element of extension and cohesion are so closely inter-related that when cohesion ceases extension disappears.Tejo is the element of heat. Cold is also a form of tejo.Both heat and cold are included in tejo because they pos-sess the power of maturing bodies. Tejo, in other words, isthe vitalizing energy. Preservation and decay are also dueto this element. Unlike the other three essentials of matter,this element has the power to regenerate matter by itself.Inseparably connected with heat is vàyo, the elementof motion. Movements are caused by this element. Motionis regarded as the force or the generator of heat. “Motion"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"320and heat in the material realm correspond respectively toconsciousness and Kamma in the mental.”These four elements coexist and are inseparable, butone may preponderate over another as, for instance,pañhavi in earth, àpo in water, tejo in fire, and vàyo in air.They are also called Mahàbhåtas or Great Essentialsbecause they are invariably found in all material sub-stances ranging from the infinitesimally small cell to themost massive object.Dependent on them are the four subsidiary materialqualities of colour (vaõõa)., smell (gandha), taste (rasa),and nutritive essence (ojà). These eight coexisting forcesand qualities constitute one material group called‘Suddhaññhaka Råpa kalàpa—pure-octad material group’.The remaining twenty kinds of råpa are equallyimportant.It should be noted that physical life-principle (råpajãvitindriya) and sex are also conditioned by Kamma. Lifein inorganic matter should be differentiated from life inanimate being.The fact that råpas arise in four ways such asKamma, mind, seasonal phenomena and food will be anovel idea to modern thinkers. All these four sources can,to a great extent, be brought under one’s control.To some extent we are responsible for the creation ofour own material phenomena, desirable or undesirable.The accumulated Kammic tendencies created by per-sons in the course of their previous lives, play at times a"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"321greater role than the hereditary parental cells and genes inthe formation of physical characteristics.The Buddha, for instance, inherited like every otherperson, the reproductive cells and genes from His parents,But physically there was none comparable to Him inHis long line of honourable ancestors. In the Buddha’s ownwords, He belonged not to the royal lineage, but to that ofthe Aryan Buddhas. He was certainly a superman, anextraordinary creation of His own Kamma.According to the Lakkhaõa Sutta (D. N. No. 30) theBuddha inherited these exceptional features, such as the32 major marks, as the result of His past meritoriousdeeds. The ethical reason for acquiring each physical fea-ture is clearly explained in the Sutta.In the sixth chapter only a few lines have beendevoted to the fourth paramattha—Nibbàna—the sum-mum bonum of Buddhism. But the path to Nibbàna hasbeen described in detail in the ninth chapter.The seventh chapter enumerates all ethical statesand classifies them into various groups.The two most profound philosophical teachingsof Buddhism—namely, the Law of Dependent Arising(Pañicca-Samuppàda) and the twenty-four CausalRelations (Paññhàna) are described in the eighth chapter.The last chapter is the most important and the mostinteresting as it deals with Mental Culture (bhàvanà) andEmancipation, the quintessence of Buddhism.To understand the intricacies of Abhidhamma one"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"322should critically read and re-read the AbhidhammatthaSaïgaha patiently and carefully, pondering at the sametime on the profound teachings embodied therein.One who understands the Abhidhamma well canfully comprehend the Word of the Buddha and therebyrealise one’s ultimate goal.Chapter VIRåpa—Saïgahavibhàgo_______§ 1.Ettàvatà vibhattà hi sappabhedappavattikà Cittacetasikà dhammà råpandàni pavuccatiSamuddesà vibhàgà ca samuññhànà kalàpato Pavattikkamato c’àti pa¤cadhà tattha saïgaho.§ 2.Cattàri mahàbhåtàni, catunna¤ ca mahà-bhåtànaü upàdàya råpan’ ti dvidham’petaü råpaü ekàdasavidhena saïgaharü gacchati.Kathaü?(1) Pañhavidhàtu, àpodhàtu, tejodhàtu, vàyodhàtu bhåtaråparaü nàma.(2) Cakkhu, sotaü, ghàõaü, jivhà, kàyo, pasàda-råpaü nàma.(3) Råpaü, saddo, gandho, raso, àpodhàtuvajjitaü bhåtattayasaïkhàtaü phoññhabba¤ ca gocararå-paü nàma."},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"323(4) Itthattaü, purisattaü bhàvaråpaü nàma.(5) Hadayavatthu hadayaråpaü nàma.(6) Jãvitindriyaü jãvitaråpaü nàma.(7) Kabalãkàro àhàro àhàraråpaü nàma.Iti ca aññhàrasavidhamp’ etaü sabhàvaråpaü,salakkhaõaråpaü nipphannaråpaü råparåpaü,sammasanaråpanti ca saïgaham gacchati.(8) âkàsadhàtu paricchedaråpaü nàma.(9) Kàyavi¤¤atti vacãvi¤¤atti vi¤¤attiråpaü nàma.(10) Råpassa lahutà mudutà kamma¤¤atà vi¤¤atti-dvayaü vikàraråpaü nàma.(11) Råpassa upacayo santati jaratà aniccatà lakkhanaråpaü nàma.Jàtiråpam’ eva pan’ ettha upacayasantatinà-mena pavuccatã’ ti ekàdasavidhamp’ etaü råpaü aññha-vãsatividhaü hoti saråpavasena.Kathaü?Bhåtappasàdavisayà bhàvo-hadayam’ icca’ pi Jãvitàhàraråpehi aññhàrasavidhaü tathà.Paricchedo ca vir¤¤atti vikàro lakkhaõanti ca Anipphannà dasa c’àti aññhavãsavidhaü bhave.Ayam’ ettha råpasamuddeso."},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"324Chapter 6Analysis of Matter_______Introductory§ 1.

So far, though not very satis-factory the closest equivalent for pañhavi-dhàtu is ‘theelement of extension’. Without it objects cannot occupyspace. Both hardness and softness are characteristics ofthis element.11. âpo-dhàtu—lit., the fluid element. âpo is de-rived from√ap, to arrive, or from à +√pày, togrow, to increase. It is ‘the element of cohesion.’ Accordingto Buddhism it is this element that makes different par-ticles of matter cohere, and thus prevents them from beingscattered about. Both fluidity and contraction are theproperties of this element. It should be understood thatcold is not a characteristic of this element.12. Tejo-dhàtu—lit., the fire-element is explainedas ‘the element of heat’. Tejo is derived from √tij, tosharpen, to mature. Vivacity and maturity are due to thepresence of this element. Both heat and cold are the prop-erties of tejo. Intense tejo is heat, and mild tejo is cold. Itshould not be understood that cold is the characteristic ofàpo and heat is that of tejo; for, in that case, both heat andcold should be found together as àpo and tejo coexist.13.Vàyo-dhàtu—lit., ‘the air-element’, is explainedas the element of motion.

Pasàda-råpa—They are the sensitive parts ofthe five organs—eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body. Theytend to clarify the coexisting material qualities. The percep-tible physical eye, for instance, is the sasambhàra cakkhu orcomposite eye, which consists of the four bhåtaråpas, fourupàdàråpas (colour, odour, taste, and sap), and jãvitindriya(vitality). The sensitive part which lies at the centre of theretina and which enables one to see objects is the cakkhu-pasàda. This is the basis of the eye-consciousness (cakkhu-vi¤¤àõa) and becomes the instrument for the eye-doorthought-process (cakkhu-dvàravãthi). The desire to seetends to develop the sense of sight. The eye, therefore, con-sists of ten material qualities of which pasàda is one.The other pasàdaråpas should be similarly under-stood.The Pasàdaråpas of ear, nose, and tongue are in theirrespective centres; the kàyapasàdaråpa is diffused through-out the body except on hair, on the tips of nails, and inwithered skin.15.

Phoññhabba—owing to its subtlety, the ele-ment of cohesion (àpo) cannot be felt by the sense oftouch. Only the other three Fundamental Elements areregarded as tangible. In water, for instance, the cold felt istejo, the softness is pañhavi, and the pressure is vàyo. Onecannot touch àpo as its property is cohesion.See Compendium, p. 155, n. 6.18. Itthattaü purisattaü—also termed itthindri-yaü, purisindriyaü — are collectively called in the abbre-viated form bhàvaråpa, the state by means of which mas-culinity and femininity are distinguished.19. Hadayavatthu—The seat of consciousness.Dhammasaïgani omits this råpa. In the Atthasàlini hadaya-vatthu is explained as cittassa vatthu (basis of consciousness).It is clear that the Buddha did not definitely assign aspecific seat for consciousness as He has done with the othersenses. It was the cardiac theory (the view that heart is theseat of consciousness) that prevailed in His time, and thiswas evidently supported by the Upanishads. The Buddhacould have accepted this popular theory, but He did notcommit Himself. In the Paññhàna, the Book of Relations, theBuddha refers to the basis of consciousness in such indirectterms as “yaü råpaü nissàya” “depending on that materialthing”, without positively asserting whether that råpa waseither the heart (hadaya) or the brain. But, according to theviews of commentators like Venerable Buddhaghosa andAnuruddha, the seat of consciousness is definitely the heart."},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"331It should be understood that the Buddha has neitheraccepted nor rejected this ancient popular cardiac theory.See Compendium, p. 156, n.l. and p. 277.20. Jãvitindriya—There is vitality both in mind andin matter. Psychic life, which is one of the fifty-two mentalstates (cetasikas) and physical life, which is one of thetwenty-eight råpas, are essential characteristics of this so-called being. Psychic life is one of the seven universals andphysical life is associated with almost every material groupexcept in dead matter. Simultaneous with the arising ofthe rebirth-consciousness, physical life also springs uptogether with the initial material groups. Jãvita is qualifiedby indriya because it has a dominating influence overother co-adjuncts in vivifying them.21. Kabalãkàro âhàro—So called because grossfood is taken in by making into morsels.

As such it is eternal. âkàsa is a dhàtu in the senseof a non-entity (nijjãva), not as an existing element like thefour Essentials. By àkàsa, as one of the 28 råpas, is meantnot so much the outside space as the intra-atomic spacethat ‘limits’ or separates material groups (råpakalàpas).Hence in Abhidhamma it is regarded as a ‘paricchedaråpa’.Although àkàsa is not an objective reality, as it is invariablyassociated with all material units that arise in four ways.Abhidhamma teaches that it, too, is produced by the samefour causes such as Kamma, mind, seasonal changes, andfood.

But the Determining Consciousness, Javanas of theKama Sphere, and super-knowledge consciousness pro-duce also (bodily and vocal) media of communication.Herein the thirteen pleasurable Javanas produce laughtertoo."},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"342(3) Material Phenomena arising from Seasonal conditions (55)The Tejo-element, which comprises both cold and heat, onreaching its static stage, produces, according to circum-stances, both internal and external material phenomena,resulting from seasonal conditions.(4) Material Phenomena arising from Food (56)Food, known as nutritive essence, during assimilation onreaching its static stage, produces material phenomenaresulting from food.Therein the heart and the (eight) material Facultiesare born of Kamma. The two media of communication areborn only of mind. Sound is born of mind and seasonalconditions. The triple qualities of lightness and so fortharise from seasonal conditions, mind, and food. The insep-arable material qualities and the element of space arisefrom four causes. Characteristic material qualities do notarise from any cause.Eighteen, fifteen, thirteen, and twelve arise respec-tively from Kamma, mind, seasonal conditions, and food.The characteristic marks of matter that arise and soforth are not produced by any cause, they say, since theyare wholly intrinsic._______Notes:—52. Råpasamutthàna—Buddhism does not attemptto solve the problem of the ultimate origin of matter. It"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"343takes for granted that matter exists and states that råpadevelops in four ways.53. Kammaja—Strictly speaking, by Kamma aremeant past moral and immoral types of consciousness. Itis only those classes of consciousness pertaining to theKàma and Råpa-Spheres that tend to produce råpa. Theyare 12 types of immoral consciousness, 8 types of moralconsciousness, and the 5 moral råpa jhànas. A moral orimmoral birth-reproductive Kamma generated at the dyingmoment of a person conditions the rebirth-consciousness(pañisandhicitta) in a subsequent birth. Simultaneous withthe arising of the rebirth-consciousness, råpas, condi-tioned by past Kamma, spring up at every instant, like theflame of a lamp, up to the I7th thought-moment reckonedfrom the dying moment of the person.At the very moment of conception there arise, as aresult of the reproductive Kammic force, three dasakas or‘decads’—namely, the kàya, bhàva, and vatthu—body, sexand base decads. The body decad is composed of the fourelements, four derivatives, vitality and the Kàyapasàda. Thesex-decad and the base-decad are similarly constituted.54. Cittaja—Mind, the invisible but more powerfulcomposite factor of the so-called being, has the potentialityto produce råpa. In other words, good and bad thoughtsproduce desirable and undesirable material phenomena.This is apparent from the physical changes that result fromthoughts generated by a person. According to Abhi-"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"344dhamma, it is from the arising moment of the first Bha-vaïga, that is, immediately after the rebirth-consciousness,that material phenomena arising from mind spring up. Therebirth-consciousness does not produce mind-born råpassince Kamma does that function and since it is a newcomerto the fresh existence. No mind-born råpas arise at thestatic and perishing thought-moments as they are weak.The ten sense-cognitives lack the potentiality to produceråpa. The four Aråpa Vipàka Jhànas do not produce råpaas they are developed through non-attachment to råpa.It is stated that Jhàna factors are essential to producemind-born råpa. One who possesses Jhànas can thereforeproduce powerful råpas which would enable him to live evenwithout edible food. The mentally alert do not lack vitality.One who experiences Nibbànic bliss could live without anyfood for a considerable period. For instance, the Buddhafasted 49 days immediately after His Enlightenment.Of the 75 types of consciousness, 26 Javanas(10 råpa kusala and kriyà + 8 aråpa kusala and kriyà and8 lokuttaras) could produce abnormal bodily movementssuch as passing through the air, diving into the earth, walk-ing on water, etc.Here the Determining consciousness is the mind-door consciousness (manodvàràvajjana). Kàmajavanas (29)are the 12 akusalas, 1 hasituppàda, and 16 sobhana kusalaand kriyà; and Abhi¤¤à cittas are the two fifth jhàna kus-ala and kriyà, accompanied by equanimity and connectedwith knowledge."},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"34513 pleasurable javanas are the 4 akusalas and 8 sob-hana kusalas and kriyàs, accompanied by pleasure, and1 hasituppàda.Worldlings, when laughing or smiling, experiencethe four akusalas and four sobhanas; Sekhas, the types ofconsciousness excluding the two akusalas accompanied bymisbelief; Arahants, the four kriyàs and one hasituppàda.The Buddhas smile only with the four sobhana kriyàs.55. Utuja—It was stated earlier that Kamma pro-duces, at the moment of rebirth, three decads — kàya,bhàva, and vatthu. The internal tejo element, found inthese three groups, combined with the external tejo ele-ment, produces material phenomena caused by seasonalconditions at the static stage of the rebirth-consciousness.At the genesis stage Kamma-born tejo element takes theplace of mind-born tejo element.It is clear that the term utu has been used in the senseof tejo which constitutes both heat and cold. Strictly speak-ing, it is the internal and external tejo elements which pro-duce råpa. It should he understood that råpas, producedby climatic conditions, are also included in the utuja class.56. âhàraja—By âhàra are meant the nutritiveessence present in physical food and the sap (ojà) con-tained in the material groups born of Kamma, mind, andseasonal conditions.

Thus jãvitindriya or the life-principle present in animate beings such as men and ani-mals should he differentiated from the inanimate life ofplants and inorganic substances, as they are not the inevit-able results of Kamma.They do possess a certain kind of life different fromhuman beings and animals.âkàsa—It is interesting to note that this intra-atomicspace is caused by all the four causes.Sadda—Articulate sounds are caused by mind; in-articulate sounds are caused by utu. Musical notes causedby men are produced by utu, conditioned by mind.Kammaja = 18. They are:— inseparables 8 +Space 1 + Heart 1 + Controlling faculties 8.Cittaja = 15.

All the rest are strictly internal.There are twenty-one material groups — nine, six,four and two produced in due order from Kamma, mind,seasonal phenomena, and food.As space demarcates, and characteristic marks just indi-cate, the wise state that they are not parts of material groups.Herein this is the formation of material groups.Section 6Råpapavattikkamo§ 6.

But at conception, to moisture-bornbeings and to those of spontaneous birth, there arise atmost the seven decads—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, sexand base. As a minimum sometimes, eye, ear, nose, andsex decads are not obtained. This is how deficiencies ofmaterial groups should be understood.To the womb-born creatures there arise three decads—body, sex and base. Sometimes, however, the sex-decad isnot obtained. From the conception and thereafter, duringlifetime, gradually there arise eye-decads and so forth.Thus the continuity of material groups,—producedin four ways—namely, Kamma-born from the time of con-ception, mind-born from the second moment of conscious-ness, season-born from the time of the static stage, food-born from the time of the diffusion of nutritive essence,—uninterruptedly flows on in the Kàma-sphere till the end oflife like the flame of a lamp, or the stream of a river.But at the time of death, from the seventeenth momentreckoned backward from the decease-consciousness, start-ing from the static stage of consciousness, Kamma-bornmaterial qualities that arose earlier exist till the decease-moment and then cease. Thereafter a continuity of materialqualities produced by physical changes persists while whatis called a corpse (lasts).Thus to the dead persons, again in a subsequent life,material qualities similarly arise starting from the conception.In the Råpa-plane decads of nose, tongue, body, sexand the material groups produced by food do not arise."},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"353Therefore to them at the time of rebirth there arise fourmaterial groups produced by Kamma, such as the threedecads of eye, ear, and base, and the vital nonad. Duringlife material qualities produced by mind and physicalchanges arise.But to the mindless beings there do not arise eye, ear,base and sound. Similarly mind-born material qualities donot arise. Therefore at the moment of their rebirth only thevital nonad arises. During lifetime material qualities pro-duced by physical changes, with the exception of sound,continue.Thus in the three planes of Kàma, Råpa and Asa¤¤a(Mindless) the procedure of material phenomena shouldbe understood in two ways as regards rebirth and lifetime.In the Kàma-sphere are obtained 28 material quali-ties, 23 in the Råpa-plane, 17 in the Asa¤¤a plane, butnone in the Aråpa-plane.At the moment of birth sound, mutation, decay, im-permanence are not obtained. During lifetime there isnothing that is not obtained.Herein this is the way how material qualities arise,Nibbàna (59)§ 7. Nibbàna however is termed supramundane, and is tobe realized by the wisdom of the Four Paths. It becomes anobject to the Paths and Fruits, and is called Nibbànabecause it is a departure (ni) from cord-like (vàna) craving.Nibbàna is onefold according to its intrinsic nature."},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"354According to the way (it is experienced) it is two-fold—namely, the element of Nibbàna with the substrataremaining and the element of Nibbàna without the sub-strata remaining.It is threefold according to its different aspects-namely. Void (60), Signless (61), and Longing-free (62).Great seers who are free from craving declare thatNibbàna is an objective state (63) which is deathless, abso-lutely endless, non-conditioned (64), and incomparable.Thus, as fourfold, the Tathàgatas reveal the Ultimateentities:—consciousness, mental states, matter, and Nibbàna._______In the Abhidhamma Compendium this is the sixth chapterwhich deals with the analysis of matter_______Notes:§ 5. 57. Råpas do not arise singly but collectivelyin groups. There are such 21 material groups.As all mental states possess four common characteris-tics, so råpas found in the aforesaid groups possess four sali-ent characteristics. For instance, in the ‘eye-decad’ all the tenassociated råpas arise and cease together (ekuppàda-ekanirodha). The earth-element, which is one of the ten, actsas a basis for the remaining nine (ekanissaya). All these tencoexist (sahavutti). It should be understood that the earth-element of the ‘eye-decad’ does not serve as a basis for theassociated råpas of the ‘ear-decad’. These four characteristicsapply only to the associated råpas of each particular group."},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"355§ 6. 58.This section deals with the manner inwhich these material groups come into being and how theyexist during lifetime, at the moment of conception, and indifferent states of birth.According to Buddhism there are four kinds ofbirth—namely, egg-born beings (aõóaja), womb-bornbeings (jalàbuja), moisture-born beings (saüsedaja), andbeings having spontaneous births (opapàtika).Embryos that take moisture as nidus for their growth,like certain lowly forms of animal life, belong to the third class.Sometimes moisture-born beings lack certain sensesand have no sex. They all must possess a consciousness asthey are all endowed with the base-decad, that is, the seatof consciousness. Beings having a spontaneous birth aregenerally invisible to the physical eye. Conditioned bytheir past Kamma, they appear spontaneously, withoutpassing through an embryonic stage. Petas and Devas nor-mally, and Brahmas belong to this class.Some of those who have spontaneous birth in theKàma-Sphere are asexual. But all beings who are sponta-neously born in the Råpa-Sphere are not only asexual butare also devoid of sensitive nose, tongue, and body thoughthey possess those physical organs. The sensitive materialqualities (pasàdaråpas) of those particular organs are lostas they are not of any practical use to Brahmas.Egg-born beings are also included among womb-born beings.

At times some are devoid of either masculinity orfemininity. From this it is seen that even eggs are consti-tuted with a consciousness.§ 7. 57. Nibbàna,131 Saüskrt Nirvàna, is composedof ni and vàna. Ni + vàna = Nivàna = Nibàna = Nibbàna.Ni is a particle implying negation. Vàna means weaving orcraving. It is this craving which acts as a cord to connectthe series of lives of any particular individual in the courseof his wanderings in Saüsàra.As long as one is entangled by craving or attachment,one accumulates fresh Kammic forces which must materi-alise in one form or other in the eternal cycle of birth anddeath. When all forms of craving are extirpated, Kammicforces cease to operate, and one, in conventional terms,attains Nibbàna, escaping the cycle of birth and death. TheBuddhist conception of Deliverance is this escape from theever-recurring cycle of birth and death, and is not merelyan escape from ‘sin and hell’.Etymologically, Nibbàna, derived from ni + √vu,to weave, means non-craving or non-attachment, or‘departure from craving’. Strictly speaking, Nibbàna is thatDhamma which is gained by the complete destruction ofall forms of craving.Nibbàna is also derived from ni +√và, to blow.In that case Nibbàna means the blowing out, the extinc-tion, or the annihilation of the flames of lust, hatred, and131. For details see “The Buddha and His Teachings,” pp. 489–510."},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"357ignorance. It should be understood that the mere destruc-tion of passions is not Nibbàna (khayamattam’ eva na nibbà-nanti vattabbaü). It is only the means to gain Nibbàna,and is not an end in itself.Nibbàna is an ultimate reality (vatthudhamma)which is supramundane (lokuttara), that is, beyond theworld of mind and body or the five ‘aggregates’.Nibbàna is to be understood by intuitive knowledgeand inferential knowledge (paccakkha or pañivedha ¤àõaand anumàna or anubodha ¤àõa). To express both ideas itis stated that Nibbàna is to be realized by means of the wis-dom pertaining to the four Paths of Sainthood and that itbecomes an object to the Paths and Fruits.Intrinsically (sabhàvato) Nibbàna is peaceful (santi).As such it is unique (kevala). This single Nibbàna is viewedas twofold according to the way it is experienced before andafter death. The text uses a simple but recondite Pàliphrase—kàraõa-pariyàyena. The Ceylon Commentary ex-plains—the cause for naming it as such with respect toits having or not having the aggregates as the remainder(sa-upàdisesàdivasena pa¤¤àpane kàraõabhåtassa upàdisesa-bhàvàbhàvassa lesena). Adding a note on this term S.Z. Aungwrites: “The Ceylon commentaries explain it by pa¤¤àpanekàraõassa lesena — by way of device of the means (of know-ing) in the matter of language” Compendium, p. 168, n. 6.Saupàdisesa—Sa = with; upàdi = aggregates(mind and body); sesa = remaining. Upàdi, derived from"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"358upa + à +√dà, to take, means the five aggregates asthey are firmly grasped by craving and false views. It alsosignifies passions (kilesas). According to the text and thecommentarial interpretations Nibbàna, experienced bySotàpannas, Sakadàgàmis, and Anàgàmis, is saupàdisesa-Nibbànadhàtu as they have the body and some passionsstill remaining. Nibbàna of the Arahants is also saupàdisesa-Nibbànadhàtu as they have the body still remaining. It isonly the Nibbàna of the Arahants after their death that istermed anupàdisesa-Nibbànadhàtu because the aggregatesand the passions are discarded by them.Itivuttaka refers to these two kinds of Nibbàna, butmention is made only of Nibbàna comprehended byArahants. It states:—“These two Nibbàna-states are shown by HimWho seeth, who is such and unattached.One state is that in this same life possessedWith base remaining, tho’ becoming’s streamBe cut off. While the state without a baseBelongeth to the future, wherein allBecomings utterly do come to cease.”Itivuttaka, p. 38.Woodward — As it was said, p. 143.(See The Buddha and His Teachings)60.

They are miscellaneously treatedin this chapter.2.âsavà— is derived from à +√ su, to flow.

These âsavas are latent in all worldlings and mayrise to the surface in any plane of existence. They lie dormantin all from an indefinite period and are treated as strongintoxicants or drugs that infatuate beings. Defilements,Corruptions, Depravities, Taints, Intoxicants, Stains are sug-gested as the closest equivalents for this ‘infamously famous’Pàli term. See Compendium, p. 170, n. 1, p. 227.Of the four âsavas kàmàsava means attachment tosensual pleasures, bhavàsava is attachment to Råpa andAråpa planes of existence, diññhàsava are the sixty-two kindsof erroneous views,132 and avijjàsava is ignorance withregard to the four Noble Truths, past life, future life, bothpast and future lives, and the Law of Dependent Arising.3.Ogha is derived from ava +√han, to harm orkill. Beings caught in the current of a great flood are over-turned and swept away directly to the sea and are hurledinto the bottom. In the same way these oghas drown beingscompletely and are swept away into states of misery.4.Yoga is derived from √yuj, to yoke. Yogasare those that yoke beings to the round of existence or tothe machine of existence.5.Ganthas are those that bind mind with body orthe present body with bodies of future existences.

Taõhàis like a thief groping in the dark to steal some thing.Upàdàna is like the actual stealing.7.Attavàdåpàdàna—Commentaries mention twentykinds of soul-theories associated with the five Aggregatesas follows:—(i)Soul is identical with the body,(ii) Soul is possessed of a body,(iii) Soul is in the body,(iv) Body is in the soul.Four soul-theories connected with each of the remainingfour Aggregates should be similarly understood.8.Nãvaraõàni—is derived from nã +√var, toobstruct, to hinder. They are so called because they obstructthe way to celestial and Nibbànic bliss. According to thecommentary this term means that which prevents the aris-ing of good thoughts in the way of jhànas etc., or that whichdoes not allow the jhànas to arise, or that which obstructsthe eye of wisdom.

As a feeling dukkha means thatwhich is difficult to endure. As an abstract truth dukkhais used in the sense of contemptible (du) emptiness(kha). The world rests on suffering—hence it is con-temptible. It is devoid of any reality—hence it is empty orvoid. Dukkha, therefore, means contemptible void.The cause of this suffering is craving or attachment(taõhà) which leads to repeated births.

Whenthere is no A there is no B. When there is do B thereis no C. In other words ‘this being so, that is; this notbeing so, that is not’ (imasmiü sati, idaü hoti; imas-miü asati, idaü na hoti).

The first embracesall volitions in the 12 types of immoral consciousness;the second, all volitions in the 8 types of Beautiful (kus-ala) consciousness and the 5 types of kusala Råpajhànaconsciousness; the third, all volitions in the 4 types ofkusala Aråpajhànas.

Hence both moral andimmoral actions are regarded as caused by ignorance.7.Vi¤¤àõa—strictly denotes the 19 types of rebirth-consciousness (pañisandhi vi¤¤àõa) described inchapter V.

They are reckoned as 36 when past,present and future are taken into consideration.When multiplied by the foregoing three kinds ofcraving they amount to 108.13. Upàdàna, derived from upa + à + √dà, to give,is intensive craving or firm grasping. Taõhà is likegroping in the dark to steal an object. Upàdàna cor-responds to the actual stealing. Grasping results withattachment and error. It gives rise to the false notionsof ‘I’ and “mine”.14. Bhava, lit., becoming, is explained as both moral andimmoral action which constitute Kamma (kamma-bhava)—active process of becoming—and the differ-ent planes of existence (upapattibhava)—passiveprocess of becoming.

Consciousness and mentalstates that immediately cease act as the powerful depend-ence of proximity. The powerful dependence of intrinsicnature is of several kinds:—states of lust etc. states of con-fidence etc., pleasure, pain, individual, food, season, lodg-ing—conditions, internal and external, as the case may be,are related to moral states etc. Kamma, too, is similarlyrelated to its effects.F.Mind and matter are related to mind and matter innine ways according to circumstances—namely, by way ofpredominance, co-nascence, reciprocity, dependence, nutri-ment, control, dissociation, presence, and non-separation.Therein relation of predominance is twofold:—i.The object to which weight is attached is re-lated to states of mind by way of objective predominance.ii.The fourfold coexisting predominance is relatedto coexisting mind and matter by way of co-nascence.The relation of co-nascence is threefold:—conscious-"},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"416ness and mental states are related to one another and tothe coexisting material states; the four Great Essentials,mutually to the derived material qualities; bases and theresultant consciousness, at the moment of rebirth, to oneanother.The relation of reciprocity is threefold:—conscious-ness and mental states are related to one another; the fourGreat Essentials, to one another; bases and the resultantconsciousness at the moment of rebirth, to one another.The relation of dependence is threefold:—conscious-ness and mental states are related to one another andcoexisting matter; the four chief elements, to one anotherand derived material qualities; and six bases, to the sevencognitive elements.The relation of nutriment is twofold:—edible food isrelated to this body; and immaterial nutriment, to thecoexisting mind and matter.The relation of control is threefold:—the five sensi-tive organs are related to the five kinds of cognition; thecontrolling power of material vitality, to the material qual-ities that have been grasped at; the immaterial controllingfactors, to the coexistent mind and matter.The law of dissociation is threefold:—at the momentof conception the basis of mind is related to the effects (ofkamma), and consciousness and mental states, to coexist-ent mind and matter by way of coexistence;, the subsequentconsciousness and mental states, to this antecedent bodyby way of post-occurrence; the six bases, in the course of"},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"417life, to the seven cognitive elements by way of antecedence.The five kinds of relations—coexistence, antecedence,post-occurrence, edible food, and material life—are, in everyway, the relation of presence and that of non-separation.All relations are included in the relations of object,powerful dependence, Kamma and presence.Herein coexisting material qualities should be under-stood as twofold:—throughout the course of life theyshould be understood as those born of mind, and at rebirthas those born of kamma._______SummaryThus the relative conditions pertaining to the three periodsof time and timeless, internal and external, conditionedand non-conditioned, are threefold by way of concept,mind and matter.In all the relations in Paññhàna are twenty-four._______Section 318. Hetu-paccaya—Here paccaya presents some diffi-culty. It is defined as that by means of which an effectcomes to be. In other words it is the cause. Further-more, it is explained as a ‘serviceable or supportivefactor’ (upakàrako dhammo). Hetu is defined as ‘thatby which an effect is established.’ It is used in the senseof ‘root’ (målaññhena). Like the roots of a tree are hetu;"},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"418like water and manure that aid its growth are paccaya.In the Abhidhamma these two cognate terms are usedin two different senses. In the Suttas, however, theyare invariably employed as synoymous terms, withoutany distinction, as, for example, ko hetu, ko paccayo—what is the reason? what is the cause?In the Paññhàna 24 such paccayas are enumerat-ed, and hetu is one of them. Hetupaccaya is ex-plained as ‘hetu itself is a paccaya’ or ‘as hetu it be-comes a paccaya.’ It is interpreted as a supportive orserviceable factor in the sense of root (målaññthenaupakàrako dhammo). The causal relation by way of‘root’ may be suggested as the closest rendering. (SeeCompendium, p. 279; Journal of the Pàli Text Society,1915–1916, pp. 29–53.‘Roots’ are purely mental. They are the six moraland immoral roots. See Chapter 1.19. ârammaõa—or âlambana—The former is derivedfrom à + √ram, to delight in; the latter from à +√lamb, to hang upon. Things on which the sub-ject delights in or hangs upon are ‘objects’. There aresix classes of objects. A form, for instance, acts as acausal relation to visual-consciousness by way of an‘object’. It should be stated that there is nothing mun-dane or supramundane that does not become anobject for mind.20. Adhipati—Lit., mastery or lordship over one’s own."},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"419One of the four dominant factors—-namely, wish,thought, effort and reasoning—may, at one time,causally relate itself to coexistent mental states andmaterial phenomena by way of predominance.“Whenever such phenomena as consciousnessand mental states arise by giving predominance toone of these four factors, then this phenomenon is tothe other phenomenon a condition by way of pre-dominance.” (Paññhàna).21. Anantara and Samanantara—In meaning there isno difference between the two terms. They differonly in etymology. According to Buddhist philosophyone thought-moment perishes immediately givingbirth to another. The succeeding thought-momentinherits all the potentialities of its immediate prede-cessor. The perishing preceding states causally relatethemselves to immediately following states by way ofcontiguity and immediacy.22. Sahajàta—The causal relation by way of co-nascence,as, for instance, the four mental aggregates, the differ-ent mental states that simultaneously arise in a partic-ular type of consciousness, the four Great Essentialsthat arise together, the appearance of the three ‘dec-ads’ at the moment of conception, etc. In the Pañicca-samuppàda it may be mentioned that both contactand feeling which appear as causes and effect are co-nascent."},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"420A mental state may be co-nascent with a mentalstate, a mental with a physical, a physical with aphysical, and a physical with a mental.23. A¤¤ama¤¤a—Just as the legs of a tripod are recipro-cally helpful, even so mental or physical state orstates may be causally related by way of reciprocity(or mutuality). Causal relations of co-nascence andreciprocity should be differentiated. They are notidentical. For instance, mind-born material phenom-ena are not reciprocally related to the coexistingmind, nor are the material derivatives to the coexist-ing Great Essentials. As a rule, mind and matter arereciprocally related.24. Nissaya and Upanissaya—derived from upa + ni +√si, to lie. Upa is an intensive prefix. As treesdepend on the ground for their support, and as pic-tures depend on a canvas on which they are painted,so is the causal relation of dependence. Upanissaya isdefined as a stronger species of Nissaya. It is com-pared to the rains on which depend the growth oftrees. S. Z. Aung renders upasnissaya by ‘sufficingcondition’. For instance, one of the five heinouscrimes such as matricide, parricide and so on willserve as an upanissaya to effect a birth in a woefulstate. Good environments, early education, etc. willserve as a causal relation by way of ‘dependence’(nissaya) for the acquisition of health, wealth and"},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"421knowledge in later life. Just as good actions becomeupanissaya for future good deeds, even so they maybecome upanissaya for evil too as, for instance, spir-itual pride. See Ledi Sayadaw’s learned article on thissubject in P. T. S. Journal, 1916, pp. 49 –53.25. Purejàta—lit., born before or that which pre-exists.The six physical bases and six sensual objects areregarded as pre-existent. The pre-existent things areregarded as causal relations only when they continueto exist in the present and not by mere antecedence.Priority is not a good rendering.26. Pacehàjàta—Of the 89 types of consciousness,85 types, excluding the four Aråpa resultants, andthe 52 mental states are causally related to the ante-cedent physical body by way of post-occurrence.27. âsevana—Repeated practice, as a rule, leads to pro-ficiency. This applies to both good and evil things. Byrepetition one acquires a certain amount of skill inany particular thing. âsevana denotes this repeatedpractice. In javana process the second thought-moment is causally related to the first, the third tothe second, the fourth to the third, by way of recur-rence. This is the reason why the fourth javanathought-moment is considered very powerful.28. Kamma means the volition that plays the mostimportant part in moral and immoral thoughts,"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"422words, and deeds. This volition, technically known asKamma, is causally related to the Kamma-born mate-rial phenomena etc. As a seed to a tree so is Kammacausally related to its inevitable results.29. Vipàka—Like a cool breeze that pacifies a personseated under the cool shade of a tree, even so mentalstates of resultant types of consciousness are causallyrelated to coexistent mental states and material phe-nomena by way of ‘effect’ due to their effortlesspeaceful nature.30. âhàra—Just as material food sustains the physicalbody, even so mental foods sustain mental states.Edible food is causally related to the body by way ofnutriment or food; so are mental contacts or impres-sions (phassa) to feelings, volitions or moraland immoral actions (manosa¤cetanà) to rebirth-consciousness (pañisandhi vi¤¤àõa), and rebirth-consciousness (vi¤¤àõa) to mind and matter.31. Indriya—The controlling factors enumerated inchapter VII become causally related to the coexistentmental states and material phenomena because theyexercise control in their respective spheres. Forinstance, confidence controls its co-adjuncts in reli-gious convictions; psychic and physical life, in vivify-ing mind and matter; mindfulness, in contemplativeexercise; feelings, in grief and happiness, etc."},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"42332. Jhàna—The seven jhàna factors of (1) initial applica-tion, (2), sustained application, (3) rapture, (4) happi-ness, (5) equanimity, (6) displeasure and (7) one-pointedness are causally related to one another andother concomitants by way of close perception and con-templation. For instance, the initial application (vitakka)is causally related to its concomitants in directing themtowards the desired object. See Chapter 1.1, 2, 3, 4, 7 are found in two classes of conscious-ness rooted in attachment; 1, 2, 6, 7, in hateful con-sciousness; 1, 2, 5, 7, in deluded consciousness.33. Magga—means a way or road. One way leads to woe-ful states; the other, to states of bliss. The vehiclesthat convey travellers to the former are the evil ‘Path-Constituents’ of wrong views, wrong application,wrong effort, and wrong one-pointedness. The vehiclesthat ply on the latter way are right understanding,right aspirations, right speech, right action, right live-lihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right one-pointedness. These path factors are causally relatedto both mind and body, leading downwards in thecase of bad ones, and leading away from existence(niyyàna) in the case of good ones.34. Sampayutta—Though possessing distinct character-istics from an ultimate standpoint yet, as certain men-tal states arise together, perish together, have oneidentical object and one identical base, they are caus-"},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"424ally related to one another by way of ‘association’.35. Vippayutta is the opposite of the foregoing. Sweetand bitter tastes may be helpful to each other inbeing dissimilar. For instance, mind that depends onthe heart-basis is causally related to it by way of dis-sociation because both mind and heart-basis are notmutually bound as water on a lotus leaf.36. Atthi is the causal relation of states that exist in thepresent to similar states like the causal relation ofcoexistence. The visibility of objects, for instance, isdue to the presence of light.37. Natthi—As with the disappearance of light, darknessspreads, so with the disappearance of the predeces-sor, the successor appears. Such is the causal relationby way of absence. For instance, the visual conscious-ness (dassana) is causally related to the immediatelyfollowing receiving consciousness (sampañicchana)by way of absence.38. Vigata and Avigata are similar to Natthi and Atthirespectively.Pa¤¤attibhedo§ 4.

Hereafter I will explain the twofold subjects of men-tal culture which deals with Calm (2) and Insight (3).§ 2. Of the two, in the Compendium of Calm, to beginwith, the objects of mental culture are sevenfold:—1. the"},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"435ten Kasiõas, 2. the ten Impurities, 3. the ten Reflections,4. the four Illimitables, 5. the one Perception 6. the oneAnalysis, 7. the four Aråpa-Jhànas.The six kinds of temperaments (4):—1. the lustful,2. the hateful. 3. the unintelligent, or ignorant, 4. the de-vout, or faithful, 5. the intellectual, or wise, 6. the discursive.The three stages of Mental Culture:—1. the prelimin-ary (5), 2. the proximate, 3. the concentrative.The three signs (6):—1. the preliminary, 2. theabstract, 3. the conceptualised.How?A.The ten kasiõas (7) are:—earth, water, fire, air,blue, yellow, red, white, space, and light.B.The ten Impurities (8) are:—a bloated (corpse)a discoloured (corpse), a festering (corpse), a disjointcorpse, an eaten (corpse), a mangled (corpse), a worm-infested (corpse) and a skeleton.C.The ten Reflections (9) are:—1. The Reflectionon the Buddha, 2. The Reflection on the Doctrine, 3. TheReflection on the Order, 4. The Reflection on morality,5. The Reflection on generosity, 6. The Reflection ondeities, 7. The Reflection on peace, 8. The Reflection ondeath, 9. Mindfulness regarding breathing. (10)D.The four Illimitables, also called SublimeStates, (II), are:— loving-kindness, compassion, apprecia-tive joy, and equanimity.E.The one Perception is the feeling of loathsome-ness about food (12)."},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"436F.The one Analysis is the analysis of the four ele-ments (13).G.The four Aråpa-Jhànas are the ‘Infinity of space’(14) and so forth. In the exposition of ‘Calm’ there are alto-gether forty (15) subjects of meditation._______Suitability of Subjects for different Temperaments§ 3. With respect to temperaments the ten ‘Impurities’and ‘Mindfulness regarding the body’ such as the 32 partsare suitable for those of a lustful temperament (16).The four ‘Illimitables’ and the four coloured Kasiõasare suitable for those of a hateful temperament. (17).The reflection on ‘breathing’ is suitable for those ofan unintelligent and discursive temperament.The six reflections on the Buddha and so forth aresuitable for those of a devout temperament; reflection on‘death’, ‘peace’, ‘perception’, and ‘analysis’, for those of anintellectual temperament; and all the remaining subjectsof mental culture, for all.Of the kasiõas a wide one is suitable for the unintel-ligent, and a small one for the discursive.Herein this is the section on suitability._______Stages of Mental Culture§ 4. The preliminary stage of mental culture is attainablein all these forty subjects of meditation. In the ten subjects"},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"437of mental culture such as the eight Reflections on theBuddha and so forth and the one ‘Perception’, and the one‘Analysis’ (18) only proximate mental culture is attainedbut not the concentrative stage. In the thirty remainingsubjects of mental culture the concentrative stage of men-tal culture is also attained.Therein the ten kasiõas and the ‘Breathing’ producefive Jhànas; the ten ‘Impurities’ and ‘Mindfulness regard-ing the body’ only the first Jhàna; the first three ‘Illimit-ables’ such as loving-kindness, four Jhànas; ‘equanimity’(19) the fifth Jhàna.Thus these twenty-six subjects of mental culture pro-duce Råpa-Jhànas.The four ‘formless’ objects produce the Aråpa-Jhànas.This is the section on mental culture._______Signs of Mental Culture§ 5. Of the three signs, the preliminary sign and theabstract sign are generally obtained in every case accordingto the object. But the conceptualised image is obtained in‘the ‘Kasiõas’, ‘Impurities’, ‘Parts of the body’, and ‘Breathing’.It is by means of the conceptualised image the proxi-mate one-pointedness and the ecstatic one-pointednessare developed.How ?Whatever object, amongst the earth kasiõas and so"},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"438forth, a beginner takes to practise meditation, is called apreliminary sign, and that meditation is preliminary men-tal culture. When that sign is perceived by the mind andenters the mind-door as if seen by the very (physical) eye,then it is called the abstract sign. That meditation becomeswell established.Likewise, when a counter-image born of meditation,freed from original defects (20), reckoned as a concept, iswell established and fixed in the mind of one who is wellcomposed and who, thereafter, practises meditation onthe abstract sign by means of preliminary concentration,then it is said that the conceptualised image has arisen._______Råpa JhànasThereafter ‘proximate concentration’, free from obstacles,pertaining to the Kàma-sphere, arises. Then he who devel-ops the conceptualised image by means of ‘proximate con-centration’ attains to the first Jhàna of the Råpa-sphere.Thenceforth by bringing that very first jhàna underone’s sway by means of these five kinds of mastery (21)—namely, reflection, attainment, resolution, emergence,and revision—the striving person, by inhibiting the coarsefactors like ‘initial application’ and so forth, and by devel-oping the subtle factors like ‘sustained application’ and soforth attains, by degrees, according to circumstances, tothe second jhàna and so forth.Thus with respect to twenty-two subjects of mental"},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"439culture such as the earth kasiõa etc. the conceptualisedimage is obtained. But in the remaining (eighteen) sub-jects of mental culture the ‘Illimitables’ relate to the con-cept of beings._______Aråpa Jhànas (22)Now, to one who practises concentration on spaceabstracted from any kasiõa excluding the àkàsa kasiõa,thinking—‘this is infinite’—there arises the first AråpaJhàna. To one who practises concentration on that veryfirst Aråpa Jhàna, thinking that ‘it is infinite’, there arisesthe second Aråpa Jhàna. To one who practises concentra-tion on the non-existence of the first Aråpa-consciousness,thinking ‘there is naught whatever’—there arises the thirdAråpa Jhàna. To him who practises concentration on thethird Aråpa-consciousness, thinking—it is calm, it is sub-lime’, there arises the fourth Aråpa Jhàna.In the remaining ten subjects of mental culture whenconcentration is practised on an object like the attributesof the Buddha and so forth and when the sign is wellgrasped ‘preliminary meditation’ becomes steadfast there-in and ‘proximate meditation’ is also accomplished._______Supernormal Knowledge (23)Emerging from the fifth jhàna (serving as a) basis forsupernormal knowledge, and reflecting on the ‘resolution’and so forth, when one practises concentration on physical"},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"440objects etc., there arises according to circumstances, thefifth Råpa-Jhàna induced in the way of developing super-normal knowledge.The five kinds of supernormal knowledge are:—Various Psychic Powers, Celestial Ear, Discerning others’thoughts, Reminiscence of past births, and Celestial Eye.Herein this is the section on mental culture.The method of meditation of Calm is ended._______Notes:—Section 11.Kammaññhàna—Here this term is used in a technicalsense. Kamma means the act of meditation or con-templation. òhàna, literally, station, ground, or occa-sion, implies subjects or exercises. Kammaññhàna,therefore, means ‘subjects of meditation’ or ‘medita-tion exercises’. There are forty such subjects of medi-tation.2.Samatha, derived from √sam, to lull, to subdue,denotes ‘tranquillity’ or ‘quietude’, gained by subdu-ing the Hindrances. It is synonymous with concentra-tion (samàdhi) which leads to the development ofjhànas. By concentration passions are only temporar-ily inhibited.3.Vipassanà, derived from vi + √dis, to see, liter-"},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"441ally, means perceiving in diverse ways, that is in thelight of transiency, sorrowfulness, and soullessness.It is rendered by ‘insight’, contemplation’, ‘intuition’,‘introspection’. The main object of vippassanà is tosee things as they truly are, in order to gain one’sEmancipation.4.Carita signifies the intrinsic nature of a person whichis revealed when one is in a normal state withoutbeing preoccupied with anything. The temperamentsof people differ owing to the diversity of their actionsor Kammas. Habitual actions tend to form particulartemperaments.Ràga (lust) is predominant in some, while dosa(anger, hatred or illwill), in others. Most peoplebelong to these two categories. There are a few oth-ers who lack intelligence and are more or less igno-rant (mohacarita). Akin to the ignorant are thosewhose minds oscillate, unable to focus their atten-tion deliberately on one thing (vitakkacarita). Bynature some are exceptionally devout (saddhà-carita), while others are exceptionally intelligent(buddhicarita).Thus, in brief, there are six kinds of temperaments.By combining them with one another, we get 63types. With the inclusion of diññhicarita (speculativetemperament) there are 64."},{"pageNumber":442,"pageContent":"4425.The preliminary stages of mental development aretermed Parikammabhàvanà. Mental culture, fromthe moment one develops the conceptualized imageand temporarily inhibits the Hindrances, until theGotrabhå thought-moment in the Jhàna Javana pro-cess, is termed Upacàrabhàvanà.The thought-moment that immediately followsthe Gotrabhå thought-moment is called Appanà,ecstatic concentration, because vitakka (initial appli-cation), the foremost Jhàna constituent, persists as iffirmly fixed upon the object of concentration.Jhàna Thought-Process:—Manodvàràvajjana / Parikamma, Upacàra,Anuloma, Gotrabhu, Appanà / Bhavaïga.6.Any object, such as a Kasiõa, used for preliminarymental culture is termed ‘Parikammanimitta’.The same object, when mentally perceived withclosed eyes, is termed ‘Uggahanimitta’.The identical visualised image, freed from allKasiõa defects, is termed ‘Pañibhàganimitta’ when itserves as an object of Upacàra and Appanà Bhàvanà.7.Kasiõa means ‘whole’, ‘all’, complete’ it is so calledbecause the light issuing from the conceptualizedimage is extended everywhere without any limitation.In the case of Pañhavikasiõa one makes a circle ofabout one span and four fingers in diameter and, cov-"},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"443ering it with dawn-coloured clay, smoothes it well. Ifthere be not enough clay of dawn-colour, he may putin some other kind of clay beneath. This hypnoticcircle is known as kasiõa-maõóala and is also calledParikammanimitta. Now he places this object twoand a half cubits away from him and concentrates onit, saying mentally or inaudibly—pañhavi, pathavi orearth, earth. The purpose is to gain the one-pointendeness of the mind. When he does this forsome time, perhaps weeks, or months, or year—hewould be able to close his eyes and visualise theobject. This visualised object is called ‘Uggaha-nimitta’. Then he concentrates on this visualisedimage until it develops into a conceptualised or counter-image, free from original kasiõa faults. This is knownas the ‘Pañhibhàganimitta’. As he continually concen-trates on this abstract concept he is said to be in pos-session of proximate or neighbourhood concentra-tion (Upacàrasamàdhi). At this stage the innate fiveHindrances are temporarily inhibited. Eventually hegains ‘ecstatic concentration’ (Appanà samàdhi).For the water-kasiõa one may take a vessel full ofcolourless water, preferably rain water, and concen-trate on it, saying—àpo, àpo, (water, water) until hegains one-pointedness of the mind.To develop the fire-Kasiõa one may kindle a firebefore him and concentrate on it through a hole, aspan and four fingers in diameter, in rush-mat, a"},{"pageNumber":444,"pageContent":"444piece of leather, or a piece of cloth, saying—tejo, tejo(fire, fire).One who develops the air-kasiõa concentrates onthe wind that enters through window-space or a holein the wall, saying—vàyo vàyo (air, air).To develop the colour kasiõas one may take amaõóala of the prescribed size and colour it blue, yel-low, red, or white and concentrate on it repeating thename of the colour as in the case of the other kasiõas.One may even concentrate on blue, yellow, red,and white flowers.Light-kasiõa may be developed by concentratingon the moon, or on an unflickering lamplight, or ona circle of light cast on the ground, or on the wall bysunlight or moonlight entering through a wall-crevice or holes, saying—àloka, àloka (light, light)Space-kasiõa can be developed by concentratingon a hole, a span and four fingers in diameter, ineither a well-covered pavilion or a piece of leather ora mat, saying—okàsa, okàsa (space, space).It may be mentioned that light and space kasiõasare not mentioned in the Texts.8.Asubha—Those ten kinds of corpses were found inancient Indian cemeteries and charnel places wheredead bodies were not buried or cremated and whereflesh-eating animals frequent.

Dhammànussati is the reflection on the virtuesof the Doctrine as, for example,“Well-expounded is the doctrine by the ExaltedOne, to be realized by oneself, of immediate fruit,inviting investigation, leading to Nibbàna, to beunderstood by the wise, each one for himself.”iii. Saïghànussati is the reflection on the virtues ofthe pure members of the Noble Celibate Order asfollows:“Of good conduct is the Order of the disciples ofthe Exalted One; of upright conduct is the Order ofthe disciples of the Exalted One; of wise conduct isthe Order of the disciples of the Exalted One; of duti-ful conduct is the Order of the disciples of the ExaltedOne.

Sãlànussati is reflection on the perfection ofone’s own virtuous conduct.v.Càgànussati is reflection on one’s own charit-able nature.vi. Devatànussati—“Deities are born in such ex-alted states on account of their faith and othervirtues. I too possess them.” Thus when one re-flects again and again on one’s own faith andother virtues, placing deities as witnesses it iscalled Devatànussati.vii. Upasamànussati is reflection on the attributivequalities of Nibbàna such as the cessation of suf-fering etc.viii. Maraõànussati is reflection on the terminationof psycho-physical life.Contemplation on death enables one to compre-hend the fleeting nature of life. When one under-stands that death is certain and life is uncertain oneendeavours to make the best use of one’s life byworking for self-development and for the develop-ment of others instead of wholly indulging in sensualpleasures. Constant meditation on death does not"},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"447make one pessimistic and lethargic, but, on the con-trary, it makes one more active and energetic.Besides, one can face death with serenity.While contemplating death, one may think thatlife is like a flame or that all so-called beings are theoutward temporary manifestations of the invisibleKammic energy just as an electric light is the outwardmanifestation of the invisible electric energy. Choos-ing various similies, one may meditate on the uncer-tainty of life and on the certainty of death.ix. Kàyagatàsati is reflection on the 32 impureparts of the body such as hair, hair of the body,nails, teeth, skin, etc.This meditation on the loathsomeness of thebody, leads to dispassion. Many Bhikkhus in the timeof the Buddha attained Arahantship by meditating onthese impurities. If one is not conversant with all thethirty-two parts, one may meditate on one part suchas bones.Within this body, is found a skeleton. It is full offlesh which is covered with a skin. Beauty is nothingbut skin deep. When one reflects thus on the impureparts of the body passionate attachment to this bodygradually disappears.This meditation may not appeal to those who arenot sensual. They may meditate on the innate crea-tive possibilities of this complex machinery of man."},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"448The thirty-two parts of the body are enumeratedas follows:—“Hair, hair of the body, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sin-ews, bones, marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm,spleen, lungs, bowels, mesentery, stomach, faeces,brain, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, lymph, tears,grease, saliva, nasal mucus, articular fluid, and urine.”x.ânàpànasati is mindfulness on respiration. ânameans inhalation and apàna exhalation. In somebooks these two terms are explained in thereverse way. Concentration on the breathingprocess leads to one-pointedness of the mind, andultimately to Insight which leads to Arahantship.This is one of the best subjects of meditation,which appeals equally to all. The Buddha also prac-tised ànàpànasati before His Enlightenment.A detailed exposition of this meditation is foundin the Satipaññhàna Sutta and in the Visuddhi Magga.A few practical hints are given here for the bene-fit of the average reader.Adopting a convenient posture, breathe out andclose the mouth. Then breathe in through the nostrilscalmly, without strain. Inhale first and count men-tally one. Exhale and count two, concentrating onthe breathing process. In this manner count up toten, constantly focusing your attention on respira-tion. It is possible for the mind to wander before one"},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":"449counts up to ten. But one need not be discouraged.Try again until success is achieved. Gradually onecan increase the number of series, say five series often. Later one can concentrate on the breathing proc-ess without counting. Some prefer counting as it aidsa concentration; while others prefer not to count.What is essential is concentration, and not countingwhich is secondary. When one does this concentra-tion exercise one feels light in body and mind andvery peaceful. One might perhaps feel as if one werefloating in the air. When one practises this concentra-tion for a certain period, a day might come when onewill realize that his so-called body is supported bymere breath, and that the body perishes whenbreathing ceases. Thus one fully realizes imperma-nence. Where there is change there cannot be a per-manent entity or an immortal soul. Insight mightthen be developed to gain Arahantship.It is now clear that the object of this concentra-tion on respiration is not merely to gain one-pointed-ness but also to cultivate Insight in order to obtainDeliverance.This simple method may be pursued by all with-out any harm.For more details readers are referred to theVisuddhi Magga.In some Suttas this simple method of respirationis explained as follows:—"},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":"450“Attentively he breathes in, attentively hebreathes out.1.

In the exercises on mental culture pertaining toInsight (24) the section on ‘Purity’ is sevenfold:—1.Purity of Morals, 2. Purity of Mind, 3. Purity ofViews, 4. Purity of Transcending Doubts, 5. Purity ofVision in discerning the Path and Non-Path, 6. Purity ofVision in discerning the method, 7. Purity of Vision regard-ing intuitive wisdom.There are three Characteristic Marks:—1.The Characteristic Mark of Impermanence(25), 2. The Characteristic Mark of Suffering (26), and3. The Characteristic Mark of No-soul (27).There are three Contemplations:—1.The Contemplation on Impermanence, 2. TheContemplation on Suffering and 3. The Contemplation onNo-soul.There are ten kinds of Insight:—1.Investigating knowledge (28), 2. Knowledgewith regard to the arising and passing away (of conditionedthings), 3. Knowledge with regard to the dissolution (ofthings), 4. Knowledge (of dissolving things) as fearful,5. Knowledge of (fearful) things as baneful, 6. Knowledge of(baneful) things as disgusting, 7. Knowledge as regards thewish to escape therefrom, 8. Knowledge of reflecting con-templation (29), 9. Knowledge of equanimity towards con-ditioned things (30), and 10.

Vipassanà or Insight is the third and final stage onthe Path of Sainthood. The chief object of Insight isto understand things as they truly are.25. Anicca, i. e., the fleeting nature of both mind andmatter. Changeableness is a characteristic of every-thing that is conditioned. All conditioned things areconstantly changing, not remaining static for twoconsecutive moments. Mind, in fact, changes evenfaster than matter. Normally matter endures only forseventeen thought-moments. Commentators statethat, during the time occupied by a flash of lightning,billions of thought-moments may arise.26. Dukkha—All conditioned things are subject to suf-fering. Birth is suffering, decay is suffering, disease issuffering, death is suffering. Union with the unpleas-ant is suffering. Separation from the pleasant is suf-fering. Not to get what one desires is suffering. Inbrief, the five aggregates of attachment are suffering."},{"pageNumber":463,"pageContent":"46327. Anattà—or Soullessness is the crux of Buddhism. Asthere is no permanent entity in matter, so also there isno unchanging entity in mind conceived as an ‘ego’ or‘soul’. In everything mundane and supramundane, con-ditioned and non-conditioned, there is no permanentsoul. Hence the Buddha in the Dhammapada stated —‘sabbe dhammà anattà—all Dhammas are soulless’.With regard to Anicca and Dukkha the Buddha said—‘saïkhàrà—conditioned things’. With regard to Anattà,the Buddha employed the term dhammà to includesupramundane unconditioned Nibbàna as well.It may be mentioned that it was after hearing the‘Anattalakkhaõa Sutta’, the discourse on soulless-ness, that the first five monks attained Arahantship.The aspirant does not usually meditate on allthese three characteristics. Of them, he takes onlythat which appeals to him most. Deliverance, gainedby meditating on each of them, is named accordingly.28. Sammasana¤àõa—Lit., ‘handling-knowledge’, is the in-vestigation of aggregates as composite (kalàpavasena).29. Pañisaïkhà¤àõa—is the re-contemplation of condi-tioned things in order to find out the means to escapetherefrom.30.

Anuloma¤àõa—is the ‘adaptation knowledge’gained by perfecting the foregoing nine kinds ofInsight. It is so called because it conforms itself to the37 Factors of Enlightenment and qualifies the aspir-ant for the higher path.32. Vimokkha—so called because they deliver one fromthe ten Fetters etc.33. Su¤¤ata—devoid of a soul. Emancipation gained bymeditating on soullessness (anattà) is called Su¤¤ata-vimokkha.34. Animitta—free from the signs of permanence etc.Emancipation gained by meditating on ‘imperma-nence’ (anicca) is called Animittavimokkha.35. Appaõihita—free from the hankering of craving.Emancipation gained by meditating on ‘suffering’(dukkha) is called Appaõihitavimokkha.36. Sãlavisuddhi—Purity of Morals, is the first of seven‘Purities’. It consists of four kinds, all pertaining tothe life of a Bhikkhu.The first is Pàtimokkhasaüvarasãla. ‘That whichsaves one who observes it from woeful states’ is the"},{"pageNumber":465,"pageContent":"465commentarial explanation of ‘Pàtimokkha’. Pà is alsoexplained as the Buddha’s Teaching. Atipamokkhameans extremely important. Pàtimokkha thereforemeans “Fundamental Teaching” or “Fundamental Pre-cepts”. It deals with 220137 disciplinary rules whichevery Bhikkhu is expected to observe. As it restrainsone from evil deeds etc., it is termed ‘saüvara’. Sãla isused in the sense of ‘composure’ (samàdhàna) and‘support’ (upadhàraõa). It is so called because it tendsto discipline thoughts, words, and deeds and becauseit acts as a support for other virtues. Indriyasaüvara-sãla, the second Sãla, deals with the control of the sixsenses. âjãvapàrisuddhisãla, the third Sãla, deals withthe right livelihood of a Bhikkhu. In obtaining the nec-essaries of life, a Bhikkhu should not act in an unbe-coming way. Paccayasannissitasãla, the fourth Sãla, isconcerned with the unselfish use of the four requi-sites—robes, alms, lodging, and medicine.37. Cittavisuddhi—is the second ‘Purity’. It is the purityof mind, gained by developing the Jhànas, temporar-ily inhibiting the Hindrances. A purified mind is like apolished mirror where everything is reflected in itstrue perspective. With a purified mind one can seethings as they truly are.38. Diññhivisuddhi—is the third purity. It is so called137. 227 including seven ways of settling disputes (adhikaraõa samatha dhamma)"},{"pageNumber":466,"pageContent":"466because it purifies one from the false theory of a per-manent soul. This correct comprehension results frominvestigating mind and matter as regards their salientcharacteristics (lakkhaõa), function or essential prop-erties (rasa), the way, of manifestation (paccu-paññhàna), and their immediate cause (padaññhàna).39. Kankhàvitaraõavisuddhi—is the fourth ‘Purity’ whichattempts to transcend sceptical doubts as regards causeand effect, the past, the present, and the future. This iscalled a purity because it removes the stain of errone-ous views of ‘chance’, ‘causelessness’, etc.To achieve this purity one meditates on the vari-ous causes that tend to produce present mind andmatter, and on the causes that sustain them in thepresent. He understands that present mind and mat-ter at conception were conditioned by past igno-rance, craving, grasping and Kamma, and, duringlifetime, matter is conditioned by kamma, mind, sea-sonal phenomena, and edible food, while mind issustained by the senses and their correspondingobjects. Thus he realizes the second noble truth ofthe cause of suffering and rids himself of doubts.40. Maggàmagga¤àõadassanavisuddhi—This is the fifth‘Purity’.The aspirant who has cleared his doubts meditatesagain with better understanding on the three charac-"},{"pageNumber":467,"pageContent":"467teristics of anicca, dukkha, and anatta. He realizes thatlife is a mere flowing, a continuous undivided move-ment. He finds no genuine happiness, for every formof pleasure is only a prelude to pain. What is transientis painful, and where change and sorrow prevail therecannot be a permanent ego or soul. The arising andpassing away of conditioned things become very con-spicuous to him. As he is thus absorbed in meditationhe witnesses an aura (obhàso) emanating from hisbody as a result of his keen insight. He experiencesalso an unprecedented joy (pãti), happiness (sukha)and quietude (passaddhi). He becomes strenuous(paggaho) and even-minded (upekkhà). His religiousfervour increases (adhimokkha), mindfulness (sati)strengthens, and wisdom (¤àõa) ripens. Labouringunder the misconception that he has attained Saint-hood, chiefly owing to the presence of the aura, heyearns (nikanti) for this state of mind. Soon he real-izes that these temptations are only impedi-ments(upakkilesa) to Insight and that he has notreally attained Sainthood. Accordingly he endeavoursto distinguish between the right and wrong path(maggàmagga¤àõadassana). It is called a ‘purity’because it clears up the misconception as regards theactual ‘path’. He understands, ‘This is the right path,that is the wrong path’.41.

It is called‘magga’ because it arises, destroying the passions.This Path thought-moment arises only once in thecourse of one’s lifetime, and is immediately fol-lowed by two or three ‘Fruit’ (phala) momentsbefore the stream of consciousness lapses into bha-vaïga. This is the reason why the Dhamma is called‘akàlika’ (immediately effective).47. Paccavekkhaõa¤àõàni—As a rule after each of thefour stages of Sainthood one reflects on the Path andFruit one has attained, on the Nibbàna one has real-ized, on the defilements one has destroyed, and, inthe case of the first three stages, on the defilementsone has yet to destroy. An Arahant who has no moredefilements to destroy knows that he is delivered.There are altogether 19 kinds of such reflectiveknowledge, 15 pertaining to the first three stages ofSainthood, and 4 to the last stage.The Pàli phrase—n’àparaü itthatthàya—No moreof this state again—refers to this process of reflection."},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"47048.

They may rise to the surface at quite unexpectedmoments.Discipline regulates words and deeds; concentra-tion controls the mind; but it is Insight (pa¤¤à), the thirdand the final stage, that enables the aspirant to Saint-hood to eradicate wholly the defilements inhibited bySamàdhi.At the outset he cultivates ‘Purity of Vision’ (diññhivisuddhi)138 in order to see things as they truly are. Witha one-pointed mind he analyses and examines this so-called being. This searching examination shows that whathe has called ‘I’, is merely a complex compound of mindand matter which are in a state of constant flux,Having thus gained a correct view of the real natureof this so-called being, freed from the false notion of a per-manent soul, he searches for the causes of this “I” person-ality. He realizes that there is nothing in the world whichis not conditioned by some cause or causes, past orpresent, and that his present existence is due to past igno-rance (avijjà), craving (taõhà), attachment (upàdàna),Kamma, and physical food of the present life. On accountof these five causes this so-called being has arisen, and aspast causes have conditioned the present, so the presentwill condition the future. Meditating thus, he transcends138.

He realizes thatlife is a flux conditioned by internal and external causes.Nowhere does he find any genuine happiness, for every-thing is fleeting.As he thus contemplates the real nature of life, and isabsorbed in meditation, a day comes, when, to his sur-prise, he witnesses an aura (obhàsa) emitted by his body.He experiences an unprecedented pleasure, happiness,and quietude. He becomes even-minded, his religious fer-vour increases, mindfulness becomes clear and insightkeen. Mistaking this advanced state of moral progress forSainthood, chiefly owing to the presence of the aura, hedevelops a liking for this mental states. Soon the realiza-tion comes that these new developments are impedimentsto moral progress and he cultivates the purity of know-ledge with regard to the Path and Non-Path.140Perceiving the right path, he resumes his meditationon the arising (udaya ¤àõa) and passing away (vaya ¤àõa)of all conditioned things. Of these two states the latterbecomes more impressed on his mind since change is moreconspicuous than becoming.

He perceives that both mind and matterwhich constitute this so-called being are in a state of con-stant flux, not remaining the same for two consecutivemoments. To him then comes the knowledge that all dis-solving things are fearful (bhava ¤àõa). The whole worldappears to him like a pit of burning embers — a source ofdanger. Subsequently he reflects on the wretchedness andvanity (àdãnava ¤àõa) of the fearful and deluded world,and develops a feeling of disgust (nibbidà ¤àõa), followedby a strong will for deliverance from it (mu¤citukamyatà¤àõa).With this object in view, he resumes his meditationon the three characteristics of transiency, sorrow, andsoullessness (patisankhà ¤àõa), and thereafter developscomplete equanimity towards all conditioned things, hav-ing neither attachment nor aversion for any worldly object(uppekkhà ¤àõa).141Reaching this point of spiritual culture, he choosesone of the three characteristics for his object of specialendeavour and intently cultivates Insight in that particu-lar direction until the glorious day when he first realizesNibbàna,142 his ultimate goal.141. These nine kinds of Insight—namely, udaya, vaya, bhaïga, bhaya, àdinava, nibbidà, mu¤citukamyatà, patisakhïà, and upekkhà ¤ànas are collectively termed Pañipadà¤ànadassanavisuddhi—Purity of Vision in discerning the method, the sixth member of the Path of Purity.142.

Here kàya refers to the five Aggregates of matter, feeling, perception, men-tal states, and consciousness, or, in other words, to the complex-compound of mind and matter. The view that there is one unchanging entity, a perma-nent soul, when there is a complex-compound of psycho-physical aggregates is termed sakkàya-diññhi. Dhammasaõgani enumerates twenty kinds 143.

He gains implicit con-fidence in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saïgha.

It is interesting to note that theAriya Saint who has attained the second stage of Sainthoodcan only weaken these two powerful Fetters with which heis bound from a beginningless past. At times, though to aslight extent, he harbours thoughts of lust and anger.It is by attaining the third Stage of Sainthood, thatof the Anàgàmi (Never-Returner), that he completelyeradicates these two Fetters. Thereafter he neither returnsto this world nor is he born in the celestial realms, sincehe has rooted out the desire for sensual gratification.
