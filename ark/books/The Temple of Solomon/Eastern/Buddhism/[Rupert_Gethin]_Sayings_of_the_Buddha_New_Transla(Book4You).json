I hope that the present volume might go some way to making these striking texts more accessible and familiar to a general readership.In translating this selection of suttas, I should like to acknowledge the debt I owe to previous scholars and translators generally, but in particular my understanding of Pali texts owes much to conversationswith and the published works of Steven Collins, Margaret Cone, L. S. Cousins, Oskar von Hinüber, and K. R. Norman; I am grateful to Mr Norman for answering my queries on several passages, while thefirst part (a – kh) of Margaret Cone’s Dictionary of Pali has been invaluable, and like all scholars of Pali I look forward to the publica-tion of the rest of this dictionary. Over the course of working on these translations I have had many conversations on questions relating to Pali literature with my wife, Rita Langer, and these, as well as her own work on Buddhist funeral rituals, have also fed into my understanding of Pali texts generally and of particular passages. I am also grateful to Ken Robinson, who read through the whole typescript meticulously, pointing out numerous mistakes and mak-ing valuable suggestions. Any mistakes that remain, however, are entirely my responsibility. Finally, I would like to thank Judith Luna, the editor of the Oxford World’s Classics series, for waiting and also for her quick and judicious advice.siddhir astuśubham astu"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"This page intentionally left blank"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"CONTENTSAbbreviationsxiIntroductionxiiiNote on the Text and Translation xlivSelect Bibliography lNote on the Pronunciation of Pali and Sanskrit liiiMap: The Ganges Basin at the Time of the Buddha lvSAYINGS OF THE BUDDHAfrom the collection of long sayings3The Fruits of the Ascetic Life (Sāmaññaphala-sutta)5The Buddha’s Final Nibbana (Mahāparinibbāna-sutta)37King Mahāsudassana (Mahāsudassana-sutta)98The Origin of Things (Aggañña-sutta)116Advice to Sigāla (Sigālovāda-sutta)129from the collection of middle-length sayings139Establishing Mindfulness (Satipa.t.thāna-sutta)141The Stilling of Thoughts (Vitakkasa.n.thāna-sutta)152The Simile of the Snake (Alagaddūpama-sutta)156The Short Dialogue with Mālun.kya(Cū.la-Mālu.nkya-sutta)168The Dialogue with Prince Bodhi (Bodhirājakumāra-sutta)173The Analysis of Acts (Mahā-Kammavibha.nga-sutta)195from the collection of grouped sayings205From the Chapter with Verses (Sagātha-vagga)209From the Chapter on Causes (Nidāna-vagga)210From the Chapter on the Aggregates (Khandha-vagga)216From the Chapter on the Six Sense Spheres (Sa.lāyatana-vagga)222From the Great Chapter (Mahā-vagga)226"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"xfrom the collection of numbered sayings247From the Section of Ones 250From the Section of Twos 251From the Section of Threes 251From the Section of Fours 256From the Section of Fives 259From the Section of Sixes 260From the Section of Sevens 261From the Section of Eights 263From the Section of Nines 265From the Section of Tens 266From the Section of Elevens 268Explanatory Notes 271Index293Contents"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"ABBREVIATIONSEditions of Pali texts (except for Vism) are those now published by the Pali Text Society; dates given are of the first publication of the editions, which are all kept in print by the PTS.

These texts are referred to in Pali as suttas or ‘well spoken utterances’.1 They have been selected from the Pali Nikāyas, ancient collections of the Buddha’s sayings. The Pali Nikāyas thus represent examples of Buddhist scriptures, and it might be tempting simply to characterize them as the Buddhist equivalent of the Bible or the Qur’an. And yet unlike, for example, Christianity, Judaism, or Islam, neither Hinduism nor Buddhism has a similarly strictly defined, closed ‘canon’ of scriptures universally accepted as uniquely authoritative by all those we would wish to call (or who would wish to be called) ‘Hindu’ or ‘Buddhist’. Certainly Hinduism has the Vedas, but as a body of literature these have never been defined as strictly as the Bible or Qur’an.2Moreover, for different groups of Hindus other collections of scriptures assume a greater significance than the Vedas.3As for Buddhism, we are faced with the existence of at least three canonical collections of Buddhist scriptures containing ‘the word of the Buddha’ (buddha-vacana): the Pali canon of ‘Three Baskets’ (Tipi.taka); the Chinese ‘Three Baskets’ (Sān zàng) or ‘Great Treasury of Sūtras’ (Dàzàng jīng); the Tibetan Kanjur or ‘Translated word of the Buddha’ (bKa’ ’gyur). Each of these canons is authoritative for different traditions of Buddhism: the Pali canon for the TheravādaBuddhists of South and South-East Asia (the Buddhists of present-day Sri Lanka, Burma, Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos); the Chinese Sān zàng for East Asian Buddhists of China, Korea, and Japan; the TibetanKanjur for the Buddhists of Tibet and Mongolia.4 While there 1 The precise meaning of Pali sutta is problematic. Buddhist tradition eventually took it as equivalent to Sanskrit sūtra, a word that came to be used to designate concise aphor-istic texts, as in Kāma-sūtra. But it seems more likely that it derives from Sanskrit sūktaor ‘well said’, a term which was used of the ancient verses of the Veda. See K. R. Norman, A Philological Approach to Buddhism,2nd edn. (Lancaster, 2006),135.2 J. Gonda, Vedic Literature (Wiesbaden, 1975).3 So, for example, in the case of a follower of Śaiva Siddhānta, it is the twenty-eight ŚaivaĀgamas that constitute the crucial divine revelation of Lord Śiva.4 Possibly we should include a fourth Buddhist canon, the Sanskrit Nava GranthaorNava Dharma of Newar Buddhism: Prajñāpārāmitā,Saddharmapu.n.darīka,"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Introductionxivis some overlap insofar as one canon might contain versions of certain scriptures contained in another canon, these versions are not straightforward translations into different languages, and it is not possible to identify a universally accepted common core. Moreover, while the Pali canon can be regarded as more or less fixed and closed by the fifth century ce, the Chinese and Tibetan canons have never been formally closed and there is no definitivefinal list of the works they contain. Certainly the Pali, Chinese, and Tibetan Buddhist canons are all considerably greater in extent than the Christian Bible. The Pali canon comprises twenty-eight works, and printed editions usuallyfill in the region of forty-five volumes. The older catalogues of the Chinese canon list some 1,500 works, while the modern Taishō edition (1924–32)fills fi fty-five volumes, each containing 1,000 pages of Chinese characters, with 2,184 separate works.5Editions of the Tibetan canon comprise some 700–800 works in just over100 volumes.6 In the case of the Chinese Buddhist canon espe-cially, what we have is not so much a strictly defined canon of scrip-tures as a library containing all the Chinese translations of Indian Buddhist texts made over the centuries, as well as a variety of indi-genous Chinese treatises relating to Buddhism.What this means in sum is that the defining text or texts of Buddhism are not identifiable in the same way as they are for Christianity, Judaism, and Islam: it is not entirely clear just what is the Buddhist equivalent to the Bible. The texts translated in the present volume are taken from the Pali canon of Buddhist scriptures. Does that mean they are Buddhist ‘classics’ only for the TheravādaBuddhist tradition? Strictly the answer has to be ‘yes’, but in import-ant and significant ways the texts translated here are classics of Buddhism as a whole. These texts, or versions of texts very like them Lalitavistara,Suvar.naprabhāsa,Lan.kāvatāra,Daśabhūmika,Gan.d.havyūha,Samādhirājā,Guhyasamāja-tantra, although as Lewis points out, other texts also have authority for Newar Buddhism; see Todd T.

To understand more clearly just how this is so, we must turn to the story of Buddhism’s beginnings in ancient India.The historical BuddhaThe diverse traditions of Buddhism that exist in the world today all refer back in one way or another to the Buddha or ‘Awakened One’. Who, and indeed what, was the Buddha? Buddhist tradition as a whole is agreed that he was Siddhattha Gotama (Skt: SiddhārthaGautama),7 Sakyamuni (Skt: Śākyamuni), the ‘sage of the Sakyapeople’ who lived in the distant past in India.While almost inevitably some early western scholars doubted that such a person ever existed, a more reasonable judgement is that of the great Belgian scholar of Buddhism, Étienne Lamotte. Lamotte observed that unless we accept that Buddhism has its origins in the strong personality of its founder, Buddhism would remain inexplicable.8 While the dating of this historical Buddha is not with-out its problems, there is today a more or less established consensus in modern scholarship that the man early Buddhist sources refer to as Gotama the Buddha lived and flourished during the fifth century bce in eastern India and died some time around 400 b c e.9 Thus, a critical evaluation of Buddhist textual sources as well as the earliest material Buddhist remains indicate that we can trace the origins of Buddhism to eastern India on the Gangetic plains during the second half of the first millennium bce.7As this book is primarily concerned with Pali literature, precedence is generally given to the Pali forms of names and technical terms, followed by the Sanskrit equiva-lents. However, in the Introduction, when referring to Buddhism more generally Sanskrit forms are used.8 Étienne Lamotte, History of Indian Buddhism (Louvain, 1988),639.9 Heinz Bechert (ed.), The Dating of the Historical Buddha,3 vols.

Cousins, ‘The Dating of the Historical Buddha: A Review Article’, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society,6 (1996),57–63."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"IntroductionxviIf we consider Buddhist sources alongside other ancient Indian sources, we can confirm that Gotama was a sama.na (Skt:śrama.na). This term means literally ‘one who strives’, and belongs to the tech nical vocabulary of Indian religion, referring as it does to ‘one who strives’ religiously or spiritually. The word sama.na can be conveniently ren-dered into English as ‘ascetic’, but the word points towards a particular tradition that in one way or another has been of great sig-nificance in Indian religious history, be it Buddhist, Jain, or Hindu. This tradition is sometimes called the ‘renouncer (sa.mnyāsin) tradi-tion’. What we are concerned with here is the phenomenon of indi-viduals renouncing their normal role in society as a member of an extended ‘household’ in order to devote themselves to some form of religious or spiritual life. The ‘renouncer’ abandons conventional means of livelihood, such as farming or trade, and adopts instead the religious life: he becomes a religious mendicant dependent on alms.The principal events that constitute the life of Gotama the Buddha for the most part simply follow from the bare fact of his existence as a wandering ascetic or sama.na in the fifth century bce who suc-ceeded in attracting a considerable following. It appears he was born into relatively wealthy and privileged circumstances and enjoyed a comfortable upbringing. At some point he became disillusioned and was attracted to the life of a wandering ascetic. If the tradition did not tell us, we might have assumed anyway that he at first pursued this vocation as part of a group of like-minded ascetics under the guidance of one or more teachers. Not satisfied with their teachings, he eventually went his own way. Subsequently it appears that he came to regard himself as having achieved ‘awakening’ (bodhi), an understanding of the nature of reality that for him represented a solution to the problems posed by the suffering and pain he experi-enced in his own life and that he saw in others. He spent the rest of his life attempting to communicate this understanding to others and to teach a method for its realization. To this end he founded a com-munity (sa.ngha) of mendicant monks (bhikkhu/bhik.su) and nuns (bhikkhunī/bhik.su.nī). This community was defined by formal ordina-tion procedures and a comprehensive monastic rule. Gotama died an old man, revered as a great teacher, an ‘awakened one’ (buddha), the Lord or ‘Blessed One’ (bhagavat), by a relatively established group of ascetics and their supporters. Such, in short, was the life of Gotama the Buddha, and thus we have ‘the three jewels’ (ti-ratana/tri-ratna)"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Introductionxviirevered by all Buddhists: the Buddha or awakened Teacher, the Dhamma (Skt: dharma) or profound Truth he taught, and the Sa.ngha or community of realized disciples.The development of Buddhist literature in IndiaOur canons of Buddhist scriptures all contain texts which relate the events of the first ‘communal recitation’ (sa.mgīti) of the Buddha’s teaching. Soon after his death 500 mendicant followers of the Buddha, all arahats (Skt: arhat) — Buddhist saints who had, like the Buddha, achieved awakening — gathered in Rājagaha (Skt: Rājagrha)to agree upon and recite the Buddha’s teachings.10 As far as we know, neither the Buddha nor any of his immediate disciples ever wrote any of the teachings down. At this period in India texts were composed and communicated entirely orally. A sense that knowledge is not properly communicated by the written word colours the traditional Indian attitude to learning in general: knowledge should be passed from teacher to pupil directly. The oral origins of traditional Indian learning continued to inform its structure long after texts had begun to be committed to writing.11Whether or not this first communal recitation, or Buddhist Council as it is often styled, is precisely an historical event cannot be known for certain. But that some early communal recitation took place at some point after the Buddha’s death seems almost certain. What texts were recited? Since recitation at this first council would lend a text authority, later Indian Buddhist schools tended to suggest that the texts just as their school preserved them were recited. Thus we are told that the master of ceremonies, the senior monk Mahākassapa (Skt: Mahākaśyapa), questioned Upāli as to the circumstances for the establishment of the 10 Not all sources agree on the place and number of participants; see Lamotte, Historyof Indian Buddhism,128.11 William Graham, Beyond the Written Word: Oral Aspects of Scripture in the History of Religion (Cambridge, 1987),56–77.

This latter category is taken to refer in the present context to a type of relatively short text relating a dialogue of the Buddha and subsequently known as a sutta (Skt: sūtra) — the type of text anthologized in the present volume. Buddhist suttas all begin with a stock phrase: ‘This is what I have heard. Once the Blessed One was stay-ing at . . .’ They then proceed to relate the dialogue of the Buddha on a particular occasion with monks, lay people, kings, gods, or some other interlocutor. The ‘I’ of the initial phrase is traditionally understood to beĀnanda, recalling at the first Buddhist Council what he had heard the Buddha teach. Yet from what we understand of the development of Indian Buddhist literature, it is hardly possible that any Buddhist text survives today just as it was recited at this first council. Nonetheless, it is extremely likely that at least some of these suttas that come down to us are among the oldest surviving Buddhist texts and contain material that goes back directly to the Buddha.The modern Buddhist canons also contain texts that tell some-thing of the story of the subsequent history and development of Buddhism in India, how from its beginnings in eastern India in the fifth century bce it spread across the whole of the Indian subconti-nent, until by the beginning of the first century ce it had become a pan-Indian phenomenon. The ancient sources for the history of Indian Buddhism are not always consistent, but their critical evalu-ation allows us to sketch a general outline.12 Perhaps one hundred years after the death of the Buddha (i.e. c.300 b c e) there was a sec-ond major communal recitation of the Buddha’s teaching in the city of Vesālī (Skt: Vaiśālī), prompted by certain disputes relating to the interpretation of the monastic rule. Matters seem to have been resolved, but not long afterwards the Sa.ngha or community of monks and nuns seems to have formally split into two parties: the Theras (Skt: Sthavira) or ‘elders’ on the one hand, and the Mahāsamghikas(Skt: Mahāsāmghika) or majority party on the other. Tradition records 12 The standard scholarly works on the early Buddhist councils and the evolution of the Indian Buddhist schools remain André Bareau’s Les Premiers Conciles bouddhiques(Paris,1955) and Les Sectes bouddhiques du petit véhicule (Paris, 1955). On the Buddhist councils and early Buddhist literature more generally see also Lamotte, History of Indian Buddhism,124–91,517–40. For a more introductory sketch and further references see R. Gethin, The Foundations of Buddhism (Oxford, 1998),35–58,307–9."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Introductionxixhow, over the next century or so, further subdivisions occurred within the Sa.ngha on both sides of this initial divide.It is important to register that we are dealing here with divisions in the monastic Sa .ngha and not splits in the Buddhist community as a whole. The divisions are matters of monastic affiliation, of how Buddhists monks and nuns trace back their line of ordination and relate to the monastic rule. How such monastic divisions would have affected and involved the wider Buddhist community in ancient India is unclear. The factors driving these divisions seem to have been varied and complex; they include the simple fact of the Sa.ngha’sdispersal across a vast subcontinent, groupings around particular monastic teachers, disagreement over approach to the monastic rule, and association with a particular understanding of points of Buddhist systematic thought or abhidhamma (Skt: abhidharma). We should also be extremely wary of the temptation to think of the evolution of these Buddhist monastic divisions by way of models derived from the history of early Christianity, and to imagine some sort of Buddhist equivalents of the early Church Councils of Nicea and Chalcedon ruling on issues of ‘heresy’ and ‘orthodoxy’. It is also worth noting that all three presently existing orders of Buddhist monks and nuns — the South and South-East Asian Theravādins, the East Asian Dharmaguptakas, and the Tibetan Mūlasarvāstivādins —derive their monastic lineage from the Sthavira side of the initial division.According to Buddhist tradition there were eventually eighteen different schools of Buddhism resulting from these divisions. The number eighteen appears to be ideal, and how many effective divi-sions there were in practice remains unclear; a number closer to ten is probably nearer the mark. In principle, it seems that all these ancient Indian schools of Buddhism would have preserved their own particular recensions of Buddhist texts: their own particular versions of the Tipi.taka (Skt: Tripi.taka) or ‘three baskets’, consisting of the Vinaya-pi.taka (containing the monastic rule), the Sutta-pi.taka (con-taining collections of the dialogues of the Buddha), and thirdly, by this stage in the development of Indian Buddhism, the Abhidhamma-pi.taka, a third basket of texts concerned with systematic Buddhist thought.If all the ancient schools did have their own distinctive versions of the Tripi.taka, then they have been largely lost. To give a rough"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Introductionxxindication, what has come down to us are six versions of the complete Vinaya (but only one in full in an ancient Indian language, the others in Chinese and Tibetan translation), one complete sūtra collection, and two complete Abhidharma collections (again only one in full in an ancient Indian language, the other in Chinese translation). Substantial portions of two other sūtra collections survive in ancient Indian languages and in Chinese translation. In short, there is only one ancient Tripi.taka that survives complete in an ancient Indian language, and that is the Pali Tipi.taka of the Theravādin school of Buddhism that flourishes today in Sri Lanka, Burma, Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos. This makes the Pali canon as a whole a uniquely important source for the study of ancient Buddhism, although it does not, of course, mean that the traditions it contains are necessar-ily older and closer to the Buddha than those of other schools whose texts happen to survive only in fragments or in Chinese translation.When were these ancient Buddhist canons fixed and closed? It is not easy to give a definite answer to this question. Certainly they remained open for some time. Thus, for example, the Vinaya-pi.takascontain accounts of the events of the second communal recitation at Vaiśālī which clearly could not have been included in the first com-munal recitation a hundred years earlier at Rājagrha. The Sūtra-pi.takas also contain discourses delivered by monks that are explicitly placed some time after the Buddha’s death. And the divergent con-tents of the two Abhidharma-pi.takas that survive suggest that they especially are the product of a period when Buddhism had already divided into schools. Equally, the substantial and broad correspond-ence in content in the case of the surviving Vinaya- and Sūtra-pi.takassuggests a relatively early date for these collections. Early on, it seems, the sayings of the Sūtra-pi.taka were arranged in four principal col-lections termed nikāya or āgama: the long (dīgha/dīrgha) sayings, the middle-length (majjhima/madhyama) sayings, the grouped (sa.myutta/sa.myukta) sayings, and the numbered (a.nguttara/ekottarika) sayings. While it is apparent that different Buddhist schools did not always distribute their versions of the dialogues across these collections in precisely the same way, and there are variations in the mode of expression and the arrangement of topics, there remains a signi fi-cant agreement; Étienne Lamotte pointed out fifty years ago that, as far as we can judge, the doctrinal basis common to the collections of sūtras surviving in Pali and Chinese translation, for example, is"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Introductionxxiremarkably uniform.13 Far from representing sectarian Buddhism, these sūtras above all constitute the common ancient heritage of Buddhism.Against this background, Buddhist sūtras continued to emerge in ancient India. Some of these sūtras were criticized as developing new and unwarranted ideas on the basis of the older ideas found in the more generally accepted sūtras. Their advocates, however, claimed that these sūtras contained the profoundest teachings of the Buddha, teachings that had hitherto been kept hidden. These were the sūtrasof the Mahāyāna or ‘great vehicle’. In India these sūtras, which began to emerge around the beginning of the first century ce, were for several centuries accepted only by a small minority and were never universally accepted. Even among the advocates of the Mahāyāna,the sūtras contained in the Nikāyas or Āgamas remained authorita-tive. Thus, when Buddhist texts began to be translated into Chinese in the second century ce, both Mahāyāna and pre-Mahāyāna materialswere translated. Over time, in certain circles the older pre-Mahāyānasūtras, although not rejected, became neglected, even though the teachings they contained continued to be referred to. Thus, among those Buddhists who took Buddhist thought and practice into Tibet from the seventh century, the teachings contained in the older sūtrashad in effect been subsumed in subsequent texts, with the result that only a handful of the older sūtras were ever translated into Tibetan.The Pali CanonThe sūtras, or rather suttas, contained in the present volume are, then, taken from the Pali canon, the only canon of ancient Indian Buddhist scriptures to survive complete in an ancient Indian language.The ancient Pali commentaries and chronicles, texts that come down to us in a form that was fixed in Ceylon14 (modern-day Sri Lanka) in the fourth or fifth century ce, relate how this particular canon of Buddhist texts was brought to Ceylon during the reign of the great Mauryan emperor Aśoka, who ruled from his capital in Pā.taliputra13 Lamotte, History of Indian Buddhism,156.14 I use the name ‘Ceylon’ to refer to the island, rather than ‘Sri Lanka’, which is the name of a modern state, just as India refers generally to the lands of the Indian subcon-tinent, which correspond generally to the modern states of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and parts of Nepal."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Introductionxxii(modern Patna) in the middle of the third century bce. Following a third communal recitation in Pā.taliputra, an elder monk named Moggaliputtatissa is said to have organized Buddhist missions to various border regions. One group of five monks, headed by the emperor’s own son, Mahinda, journeyed to Ceylon and is said to have brought the Pali canon with it. Whatever the value of this tradi-tion, from the third and second centuries bce we have material evi-dence of the presence of Buddhism in Ceylon in the form of monuments and donative inscriptions over caves that were adapted for use as Buddhist monastic dwellings. And if Buddhist monks were there, it seems likely that Buddhist texts were also there.At this stage in the history of Buddhist texts we are still dealing with an oral literature. Thus, we find in the ancient sources mention of schools of reciters (bhā.naka) who specialized in preserving and reciting the principal collections of suttas. According to the Pali sources, these schools traced their lineage back to the first communal recitation when the 500 arahats entrusted these collections to the Buddha’s direct disciples: thus the Dīgha-bhānakas or ‘reciters of the long sayings’ represented the lineage of Ānanda, the Majjhima-bhānakas or ‘reciters of the middle-length sayings’ that of Sāriputta’spupils (since Sāriputta himself had died before the first communal recitation), the Samyutta-bhānakas or ‘reciters of the grouped sayings’that of Anuruddha, the A.nguttara-bhānakas or ‘reciters of the num-bered sayings’ that of Mahākassapa.15 Pali tradition records that the texts of the Tipi.taka were in fact first written down during the firstcentury bce.16 It also records that the commentary (a.t.thakathā) on these texts was written down at the same time. To what extent the text of the Pali canon as we have it today can be traced back to the canon as it existed and was written down in the first century bceonce more remains unclear. We have no manuscripts that date back to anything like this period. Manuscripts do not survive well in a humid tropical climate, and probably the majority of the manuscripts of the Pali canon date from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries; and in general, the very oldest manuscripts do not date from before thefifteenth century.17 The oldest Pali manuscript that has so far 15 Sv I 15.16 Dīp XX 20–1; Mhv XXXIII 100–1; cf.

This is established by the existence of the Pali commentaries, which comment in detail on the text and can be dated to the fifth century ce. The Pali commentaries were fixed in their present form by a number of scholar monks, the most famous of whom was Buddhaghosa, who all belonged to the Mahāvihāra or Great Monastery, one of three principal monasteries in the ancient capital of Ceylon, Anurādhapura. These were the monks probably responsible for the final closing of the Pali canon.20According to their own account of their work, their commentaries were based on earlier commentaries (now lost) which seem to have been composed and, up until this point, handed down in various Middle Indian dialects or Prakrits. The language of the commentar-ies was now standardized in conformity with ‘the language of the canon’ or pāli-bhāsā. (This expression eventually came to be inter-preted as ‘the Pali language’, hence the modern usage of ‘Pali’ as the name of a language.)21 At the same time, the list of works that consti-tuted the Pali canon and were considered to be the ‘word of the Buddha’ (buddha-vacana) by the Mahāvihāra was finalized. While the final form of the Pali commentaries dates from the fifth century ce,the fact that they make no mention of people who lived after the firstcentury ce suggests that in terms of their contents they are in sub-stance works that belong to a period three or four centuries earlier.22And given that they comment on the text of the Pali canon, the works of the canon as we have it must date at least to a period a century or so before that.18 Oskar von Hinüber, The Oldest Pāli Manuscript: Four Folios of the Vinaya-Pi.takafrom the National Archives, Kathmandu (Mainz, 1991).19 Richard Salomon, Ancient Buddhist Scrolls from Gandhāra (London, 1999).20 S.

The broad correspondence in terms of structure and contents between the surviving recensions of the four principal collections (nikāya/āgama) that make up the Sūtra-pi.taka (the long, middle-length, grouped, and numbered sayings) is in itself indicative of a relatively early date, prior to the division of the Buddhist Sa.ngha into separate schools, for the basic contents of these collections. It seems likely, then, that these collections took on their current form during the third and second centuries bce. The language of the Pali canon also tells a tale. According to the traditions of the commentaries, the language of the Pali canon is Māgadhī, on the assumption, one presumes, that the canon contains the words of the Buddha and the Buddha lived in Magadha and therefore spoke its language. All the evidence suggests, however, that Pali is not in fact Māgadhī. The inscriptions which Aśoka commissioned in local dialects across the Indian subcontinent allow us to establish a general language map of India a century or so after the death of the Buddha.23This suggests that Pali — the language of the Pali canon — has more in common with a western dialect than an eastern dialect, of which Māgadhī would be an example. Nonetheless, Pali does seem to exhibit some eastern features — sometimes referred to as ‘Māgadhisms’. The detailed study of the language of the canon in fact suggests that various dialects through which the texts have been filtered in the course of their evolution have left their traces.24 Finally, we see in Pali the beginnings of ‘sanskritization’, the process by which Buddhist texts which had been preserved in different dialects were renderedcloser to the norms of Sanskrit. This linguistic story perhaps reflectsthe early history and evolution of the texts that have come down to us in the Pali canon. This history possibly begins with the Buddha teaching in some form of Māgadhī as opposed to Sanskrit, a lan-guage which at that time was too closely associated with the brah-manical tradition, to which the Buddha represented a challenge; subsequently his teachings are transposed into different local dialects as Buddhist monks spread out from Magadha; finally, as Sanskrit begins to lose its exclusively brahmanical association and to take on the role of the language in which to communicate learning and cul-ture right across India, certain terms, such as brāhma.na, signifying 23 Richard Salomon, Indian Epigraphy (New York, 1998),72–6.24 Norman, A Philological Approach to Buddhism,75–97."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Introductionxxva ‘brahman’ or member of the priestly class, are transposed into their Sanskritic forms. Thus, the language of the Pali canon does appear to have become frozen at a relatively early date, resisting both the more thoroughgoing sanskritization that is a feature of some other early Buddhist texts and also any influence from Sinhalese Prakrit during its long transmission in Ceylon.25In sum, although we cannot date the texts translated in this volume with any final certainty, we can say that they are likely to date in some-thing close to their present form to the third or second century bce.We cannot claim that the Pali version of the suttas translated here represent the oldest version or are closer than other surviving versions to some ideal original. Yet this is equally true of these other surviving versions. Certainly there have been some attempts to compare versions and date them relatively, and also attempts to distinguish earlier from later strata within the collections of Pali suttas themselves, yet the exercise is fraught with uncertainties, and the results of such attempts have proved inconclusive and not been universally accepted by scholars.26 The Pali suttas are, then, among the oldest Buddhist texts we have — certainly no texts can claim to be older. In their words we are presented with an understanding of what the Buddha taught that is likely to go back directly to his earliest disciples; here we are as close to the presence of the Buddha as we are likely to get.The texts of the Pali canon are arranged by way of three basic divi-sions or ‘baskets’ (pi.taka): the Vinaya-pi.taka or ‘basket of discipline’; the Sutta-pi.taka or ‘basket of sayings’; the Abhidhamma-pi.taka or ‘basket of further teaching’.The Vinaya-pi.taka consists of three works: (1) the Sutta-vibha.ngasets out and explains in detail the 227 and 311 ‘training rules’ (sikkhāpada) to be followed by Buddhist monks (bhikkhu) and nuns (bhikkhunī) respectively; (2) the Khandhaka sets out in twenty-two sections (khandhaka) the procedures for conducting the various for-mal communal acts of the Sa.ngha; (3) the Parivāra is an appendix that contains various kinds of material aimed at assisting the study and understanding of the Vinaya.The Sutta-pi.taka consists of five ‘collections’ (nikāya): (1) the Dīgha-nikāya or ‘collection of long sayings’ comprises thirty-four 25 K.

Thus we have five suttas from the Dīgha-nikāya; six from the Majjhima-nikāya; a selection of suttas representing the fivefold structure of the Samyutta-nikāya and the eleven most important sam.yuttas or ‘groups’ that underlie the arrangement of that collection; and finally a selection of eleven suttas reflecting the numerical arrangement of the A.nguttara-nikāya. The suttas are presented in the order in which they appear in the Nikāyas. Introductions to the individual suttas describe their contents in more detail.The selection is also intended to represent the principal teachings found in the Nikāyas — teachings on the Buddhist path and diffe r-ent types of meditation (Sāmaññaphala-sutta,Satipa.t.thāna-sutta,Vitakkasa.n.thāna-sutta, and the suttas from the Mahāvagga of the Samyutta-nikāya), teachings on the theories of the five ‘aggregates’ and ‘not self ’ (the Alagaddūpama-sutta, and the suttas from the khandha-sam.yutta and sa.lāyatana-sam.yutta), teachings on ‘dependent 27 The selection is perhaps in the order of 5% of the four Nikāyas."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Introductionxxviiarising’ (the suttas from the nidāna-sam.yutta), teachings on everyday conduct (the Sigālovāda-sutta), teachings on the evolution of the world and society (the Aggañña-sutta), teachings on actions and their consequences for rebirth (the Mahā-Kammavibha.nga-sutta).Three suttas focus on important episodes in the Buddha’s life: theBodhirājakumāra-sutta provides an account in the first person of the Buddha’s struggle for awakening and his ultimate success; theDhammacakkappavattana-sutta (of the Mahā-vagga of the Sam.yutta-nikāya) gives an account of the ‘turning of the wheel of the Teaching’, the first sermon of the Buddha; the Mahāparinibbāna-sutta relates the story of the Buddha’s final journey and of his death and funeral.The anthology also represents something of the different literary styles of the suttas, ranging from the more philosophical and technical analysis of, say, the Alagaddūpama-sutta to the mythic narrative and visual imagery of the Mahāsudassana-sutta. Finally, there are here suttas addressed to a variety of different audiences: to monks, brah-mans, laymen, kings, and gods.28Anyone reading Buddhist suttas for the first time is likely to be struck by a certain repetitiveness that manifests itself in various ways: the repetition of passages when events that have just been narrated are related to another person, and the use of stock formulas to describe events, people, ideas, to give but two examples. This repetitiveness is in part a reflection of the fact that suttas were com-posed orally and transmitted orally for several centuries before being 28 For full translations of the Pali Nikāyas, see the following works.

But repetition is also used by the suttas to affect both the reciter and listener, and is integral to the suttas as literary works that are in some sense to be performed.The use of repetition thus gives the suttas a particular literary rhythm: there is no hurry to get information across; ideas and similes that are repeated have a meditative and poetic effect; they evoke images in our minds and stir our emotions as slowly we contemplate them again and again. When the suttas were written down (and per-haps even when they were being recited in some contexts) they were abbreviated, usually with the word peyyāla (itself abbreviated to pe)meaning something like ‘repetition’, the Pali equivalent of ‘. . .’ to indicate omission.India at the time of the BuddhaIt is generally thought — though it is also a matter of some controversy — that some time after the beginning of the second mil-lennium bce groups of a nomadic tribal people began to move south from ancient Iran, through the passes of the Hindu Kush and down into the plains of the Indus valley.29 These people spoke dialects of Old Indo-Aryan, that is, of Sanskrit, and they are known as the Āryas. The Āryas who moved into India were descendants of nomadic pastoralists who had occupied the grasslands of central Asia, and some of whom similarly moved west into Europe.Once in India, the Āryas’ cultural influence gradually spread southwards and eastwards across the plains of northern India. By the time the Buddha was born, probably early in the fifth century bce,theĀryas had been in India for perhaps a thousand years, and their cultural influence extended down the Ganges valley as far as modern Bengal. Our sources indicate that the northern half of the Indian subcontinent then comprised sixteen ‘countries’ (mahājanapada).Of these, four constituted significant kingdoms: farthest to the east down the Ganges valley was Magadha, with its capital at Rājagaha(Skt: Rājagrha), further to the west up the Ganges valley was the kingdom of Vamsa (Skt: Vatsa), centred on the city of Kosambī29 On the sometimes heated debate provoked by the issue of the original homeland of theĀryas see Edwin F. Bryant and Laurie L. Patton (eds.), The Indo-Aryan Controversy: Evidence and Inference in Indian History (London, 2005)."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Introductionxxix(Skt: Kauśambī); to the north was the kingdom of Kosala (Skt: Kośala), centred on the city of Sāvatthī (Skt: Śrāvastī); some way to the south and west of these three kingdoms was Avanti, centred on the city of Ujjenī (Skt: Ujjayanī). Apart from these kingdoms there were a number of smaller republics (ga.na), the most important of which was that of the Vajjis (Skt: Vrji), lying to the north of Magadha and centring on the city of Vesālī. Further to the west, bordering on the kingdom of Kosala, were the smaller republics of the Mallas, centring on Pāpā, and of the Sākiyas, centring on Kapilavatthu (Skt: Kapilavastu) and the country of the Buddha’s birth.30Early Buddhist texts depict the Buddha leaving his homeland and journeying south-east into Magadha, where he finally achieved his awakening. From there he wandered west into Kāsī (Skt: Kāśī) to begin his teaching career in a deer park outside Bārānasī (modern Benares). The Buddha’s subsequent career is spent wandering and teaching in a region more or less defined by the kingdoms of Magadha, Vamsa, and Kosala, and the republic of the Vajjis.The coming of the Āryas did not bring political unity to northern India, but it did bring a certain cultural vision and ideology that constitutes one of the principal components of Indian culture. This vision of society was principally developed and articulated by a hereditary group within the society of the Āryas known as brāhma.nasor, in the Anglo-Indian spelling, brahmans. The original literature of the brahmans is known as the Vedas, the oldest portions of which, found in the ̊Rg Veda, date from about 1500 b c e. By the time of the Buddha, Vedic literature probably already comprised several differentclasses: the four collections (sa.mhitā) of verses attributed to the ancient seers ( ̊r.si), the ritual manuals (also known as brāhma.nas)giving instruction in the carrying out of the elaborate Vedic sacrificialritual, and ‘the forest books’ (āra.nyaka) explaining the esoteric meaning of this sacrificial ritual. The final class of Vedic literature, the Upanisads, containing further esoteric explanations of the sacrificial ritual, was still in the process of formation.Two aspects of the brahmanical vision are of particular import-ance, namely an understanding of society as reflecting a hierarchy of ritual ‘purity’, and a complex system of ritual and sacrifice. From the brahmanical perspective society comprises two groups: the Āryas30 On the early Indian kingdoms and republics, see A. L. Basham, The Wonder that was India,3rd edn. (London, 1967),44–136."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Introductionxxxand the non-Āryas. The former consists of the three hereditary classes (varn.a) in descending order of purity: brāhma.nas (whose pre-rogative and duty it is to teach and maintain the Vedic tradition), k.satriyas or rulers (whose prerogative and duty is to maintain order and where necessary inflict appropriate punishment), and the vaiśyas(whose prerogative and duty is to generate wealth through farming and trade). These three classes are termed ‘twice born’ (dvija) by virtue of the fact that traditionally male members undergo an initi-ation (upanayana) into a period of study of the Vedic tradition under the supervision of a brahman teacher; at the end of this period of study it is their duty to maintain the household sacrificialfires and, with the help of brahmans, carry out various sacrificial rituals —offerings into the sacrificialfire — in accordance with the prescrip-tions of Vedic tradition. The non-Āryas make up the fourth class, the śūdras or servants, whose basic duty it is to serve the three other classes. While it is important not to confuse these four classes (var.na)and the countless castes (jāti) of later Indian society, it is nonetheless the ideology of the relative ritual purity of the classes that underpins the medieval and modern Indian ‘caste system’.31The brahmans’ hereditary ritual status empowered them to carry out certain ritual functions that members of other classes were excluded from, but at the time of the Buddha not all brahmans were full-time ‘priests’. Precisely how brahmans related to the various groups of wandering ascetics is not clear. In part we must see the brahmanical vision of society and that of the wandering ascetics as opposed to each other, in part we must see the two as influencingeach other. To accept the brahmanical view of the world was to accept brahmanical authority as an aspect of the eternal structure of the universe and, as such, unassailable. Yet alongside the brahmans were the various groups of wandering ascetics or ‘renouncers’. At leastsome of these threatened brahmanical supremacy by offering rival visions of the world and society.32 On the other hand, within brah-manical circles we find the development of certain esoteric theories of the nature of the sacrificial ritual and philosophical views about the ultimate nature of man and his relationship to the universe at 31 On the early Vedic and brahmanical tradition generally see Thomas J. Hopkins, The Hindu Religious Tradition (Belmont, Calif., 1971),3–51.32 See Padmanabh S. Jaini, ‘Śrāma.nas: Their Conflict with Brāhmanical Society’, in J. W. Elder (ed.), Chapters in Indian Civilization, vol. 1 (Dubuque, 1970),39–81."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Introductionxxxilarge. These theories may to some extent have drawn on ideas devel-oping amongst the groups of wandering ascetics; at the same time they may have substantially contributed to the theories of the wan-derers themselves, since it is clear that brahman circles were an important recruiting-ground for the various groups of wandering ascetics. Yet it seems clear that in certain respects the Buddha’s teachings were formulated as a response to certain Brahmanical teachings.33The origins of the ‘renouncer’ tradition are not clear. Whether it is best understood as evolving within the context of specifically brah-manical religion or outside it is a matter of scholarly debate.34Nevertheless, by the fifth century bce the tradition was well estab-lished. Yet, while ‘renouncers’ had in common the fact that they had ‘gone forth from the household life into homelessness’ (to use a phrase common in Buddhist sources), the kinds of lifestyle they then adopted varied considerably. This is suggested by some of the terms that we find in the texts: in addition to ‘one who strives’ (śrama.na/sama.na) and ‘renouncer’ (sa.mnyāsin), we find ‘wanderer’ (parivrājaka/paribbājaka), ‘one who begs his share (of alms)’ (bhik.su/bhikkhu),‘naked ascetic’ (acelaka), ‘matted-hair ascetic’ (ja.tila), as well as a number of other terms. Some of these wanderers and ascetics seem to have been loners, while others seem to have organized themselves into groups and lived under a teacher. Early renouncers seem to have been for the most part male, although with the growth of Buddhism and Jainism it is certainly the case that women too began to be numbered among their ranks.Three kinds of activity seem to have preoccupied these wanderers and ascetics. First, there is the practice of austerities, such as going naked in all weather, enduring all physical discomforts, fasting, or undertaking the vow to live like a cow or even a dog.35 Secondly, there is the cultivation of meditative and contemplative techniques aimed at producing what might, for the lack of a suitable technical term in English, be referred to as ‘altered states of consciousness’. In the technical vocabulary of Indian religious texts such states 33 See Richard Gombrich, Theravāda Buddhism: A Social History from Ancient Benares to Modern Colombo (London, 1988), and ‘Recovering the Buddha’s Message’, in Tadeusz Skorupski (ed.), The Buddhist Forum, vol. 1 (London, 1990),5–20.34 See Gavin Flood, An Introduction to Hinduism (Cambridge, 1996),87–90.35 D I 161–77; M I 387–92."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Introductionxxxiicome to be termed ‘absorptions’ (dhyāna/jhāna) or ‘concentrations’ (samādhi); the attainment of such states of consciousness was gen-erally regarded as bringing the practitioner to some deeper knowl-edge and experience of the nature of the world. Lastly there is the development of various philosophical views providing the intellec-tual justification for particular practices and the theoretical expres-sion of the ‘knowledge’ to which they led. While some groups and individuals seem to have combined all three activities, others favoured one at the expense of the others, and the line between the practice of austerities and the practice of meditation may not always be clear: the practice of extreme austerity will certainly alter one’s state of mind.The existence of some of these different groups of ancient Indian wanderers and ascetics with their various practices and theories findsexpression in Buddhist texts in a stock description of ‘six teachers of other schools’, who are each represented as expounding a particular teaching and practice. Another list, with no details of the associated teachings and practices, gives ten types of renouncer. In fact, two other ancient Indian traditions that were subsequently of some importance in the religious life of India (the Ājīvikas and the Jains) find a place in both these ancient Buddhist lists; the Jain tradition, of course, survives to this day.36A sketch of early Buddhist thought and practice 37The word buddha means literally ‘one who has woken up’.38 In early Buddhist sources that word is used to characterize a particular type of person: a buddha is someone who has woken up from a particular kind of sleep: the sleep of ignorance.Buddhas are, from the perspective of ordinary humanity, extremely rare and quite extraordinary. In contrast to these buddhas or ‘awak-ened ones’, the mass of humanity is asleep — asleep in the sense that people pass through their lives never knowing and seeing the world ‘as it is’ (yathā-bhūta.m). As a consequence, they suffer. A buddha, on the 36 For the list of six teachers see e.g. D I 51–9 (below, pp. 10–16); for the list of ten see A III 276; cf. A. L.

Moreover — and this is per-haps the greatest significance of a buddha for the rest of humanity, and indeed for all the beings who make up the universe — a buddha teaches. He teaches out of sympathy and compassion for the suffering of beings, for the benefit and welfare of all beings; he teaches in order that others might awaken, like him, to the understanding that brings final relief from suffering. An ancient formula, part of which is still used in Buddhist devotions today, puts it as follows:For the following reasons is he the Blessed One — he is an arahat, a per-fect buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, happy, one who understands the world, an unsurpassed charioteer of men to be tamed, the teacher of gods and men, a blessed buddha . . . He gains for himself a direct knowledge of this world with its gods, its Māra and Brahmā, of this generation with its ascetics and brahmans, its princes and peoples, and having experienced this directly he makes it known. He teaches the Truth that is beautiful in the beginning, beautiful in the middle, beautiful in the end, both in its spirit and in its letter. He makes clear the pure spiritual life in all its perfection.39The formula describes a buddha as, amongst other things, one who gains ‘knowledge of this world with its gods, its Māra and Brahmā’.Buddhas appear in a world or universe made up of countless world spheres or systems, that consist of various levels and realms of beings ranging from the hellish to the divine. All beings in the universe —whether hellish, animal, human, or divine — are born, live, die, and are reborn again in accordance with their actions, their ‘karma’ (or, in Pali, kamma). This perpetual round of birth, death, and rebirth is calledsa.msāra, and has no known beginning and no known end. On a larger scale clusters of world systems go through great cycles of expansion and contraction across vast aeons of time. Again, this process has no known beginning and no known end. There is thus no definite limit that can be put on the universe, either temporally or spatially. This universe is inhabited by a great variety of beings, both seen and unseen, and including various gods, both minor and major. And yet the universe was not created by, nor is it controlled by, any one omnipotent God. Certain gods, such as the great Brahmā, may, however, have a certain limited jurisdiction over certain parts of the universe and may even get the idea that they created it; some human 39 D I 49,62;Sāmaññaphala-sutta, translated in full below."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Introductionxxxivbeings may also worship Brahmā as the creator. Other gods, such as Māra, ‘the Bad One’, and his retinue actively try to mislead and delude beings. But although these gods’ life-spans may be of incal-culable length, none is immortal. All will eventually die, to be reborn in some other part of the universe, though, in the case of Brahmā and Māra, another being will be reborn in their place to take over their roles. It is in this universe that buddhas appear; and it is this universe that buddhas get to know.40As we have seen, our earliest Buddhist sources present themselves as a record of the life and teachings of one particular buddha —Gotama or Sakyamuni, ‘the sage of the Sakya people’ — as remem-bered and passed down by his pupils. While the principal events that constitute the life of Gotama the Buddha for the most part simply follow from the bare fact of his existence as a wandering ascetic or sama.na in the fifth century bce, the later Buddhist tradition elabor-ates the Buddha’s life-story into a kind of parable of his teachings.41Thus, while the very earliest sources seem to indicate no more than that the Buddha was relatively wealthy and privileged, later versions of the story tell how the Buddha was born into fabulous luxury as a prince whose father did the utmost to shield and protect his son from all life’s unpleasantness, providing him with attendants who saw to his every need. Yet one day, while out enjoying the countryside, this privileged prince is confronted for the first time in his life by various sights that are shocking to him: first an old man, decrepit, leaning on a stick, his youth long vanished; secondly a sick man, in severe pain, lying in his own excrement and urine; and thirdly a funeral procession carrying a corpse to the cremation ground.Deeply affected by what he has seen, the young Gotama returns home to brood on the fact that his life of luxury and pleasure is lived overshadowed by old-age, sickness, and death. The moral of the story is a simple one: even if you have everything you could possibly want, you cannot escape the realities of old-age, sickness, and death. The story thus vividly illustrates what is the starting-point of Buddhist teaching: suffering is a fact, a reality that we cannot avoid. Even if we try to lose ourselves in life’s undoubted pleasures, sooner 40 On Buddhist cosmology more generally see Gethin, Foundations of Buddhism,112–32.41 For an account and discussion of the Buddha as presented in a variety of ancient sources see John S. Strong, The Buddha:A Short Biography (Oxford, 2001)."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Introductionxxxvor later we are going to have to face the fact that we, and those around us, will age, become sick, and die.Buddhist teaching thus seeks to speak to that in us which is troubled by life. The Buddhist term for this is dukkha. The term dukkha is perhaps most literally rendered into English as ‘pain’. Life’s pains come in various shapes and sizes. There is the obvious pain and associated mental anguish of physical injury and sickness. There is also the pain of having that which we want to keep taken away from us, or that which we would prefer not to have at all thrust upon us. There is also the deeper pain of simply finding that even when we manage to get and hold on to the things we want, somehow, strangely, they do not bring us the happiness and contentment we thought they would. There is thus suffering that is simply pain, suffering that consists of change, and suffering that consists in the conditioned nature of things.To return to the story of the Buddha’s life: there is one other thing we are told that the young Gotama saw: a wandering ascetic with shaven head, wearing ochre robes. To the troubled prince who had lost his appetite for his life of luxury, the sight of an ascetic is an inspiration. Gotama resolves that he will leave home and pursue the religious life, the life of a wandering, homeless ascetic.The life of the homeless wandering ascetic is often presented by the subsequent Buddhist tradition as the ideal way to pursue an answer to the questions posed by the problems of suffering. One early Buddhist source puts it like this: there are two kinds of quest —first the quest of ordinary life, when someone who is himself subject to old-age, sickness, and death dedicates his life to the pursuit of that which is also subject to old-age, sickness, and death; secondly the quest of the religious life, when someone who is subject to old-age, sickness, and death dedicates his life to seeking release from that which is subject to old-age, sickness, and death.In theory and ideally, the life of the Buddhist monk (bhikkhu) or nun (bhikkhunī) is conceived as the life of the wandering homeless ascetic who has dedicated his or her life to the religious or spiritual quest. The life of the Buddhist monk or nun involves in the first place a turning away from and letting go of the pursuit of worldly pleasure in order to focus efforts in a different direction. The monk or nun’s commitment to the religious quest is manifest in his or her appearance and simple lifestyle. Monks and nuns shave their heads and wear"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Introductionxxxvisimple robes; for a dwelling, they should be content with the root of a tree; for food, with whatever is offered to them in alms. Their life-style is further defined by a monastic rule aimed at restraining certain kinds of behaviour: they are prohibited from all sexual activity, from killing living creatures, from taking what is not given, from lying and deception, from handling gold and silver, from overeating. Whether or not all Buddhist monks and nuns have at all times and in all places lived up to this ideal, the values embodied in this lifestyle have been and remain an inspiration for both Buddhist monks and nuns and also their supporters. Mention of the supporters of Buddhist monks and nuns brings us to the point that not all those who have found comfort in and been followers of the Buddha’s teachings over the last two-and-a-half thousand years have been moved to leave behind entirely the quest for fulfilment in the pursuit of worldly aims.It is sometimes implied that the ideal of the Buddhist monk or nun who turns his or her back on society in order to pursue a personal religious quest betrays an antisocial spirit, even a certain selfishnessat the heart of Buddhism. Yet we should note that, even as Buddhist monks and nuns turn away from the values and aims that motivate much of ordinary secular society, their monastic rule forces them back into a relationship with society. Ideally a Buddhist monk or nun should eat only what has been offered to him or her by another; he or she should not store food or dig the ground. Thus the Buddhist monastic rule, far from encouraging isolation, independence, and self-sufficiency, forces the Buddhist monastic community into a position of dependence on society as a whole. Where there is no support for the monastic community, it cannot survive. Why might members of society who choose not to become monks and nuns give their support to those who do? Ultimately, because of a common set of shared values. Even though Buddhist laity remain to some degree commit-ted to the pursuit of worldly secular aims, they recognize in the lifestyle of monks and nuns something that they themselves aspire to. The monks and nuns are a reminder of a set of values other than those of profit, fame and gain, and so on. They are a pointer to some-thing beyond the endless routine, the cycle of day-to-day life. In return for the gift of material support, the monks and nuns give the gift of the Buddha’s teaching.The Buddhist quest for release from the pain of birth, old-age, sickness, and death has as its basis, then, a particular lifestyle and"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Introductionxxxviidiscipline that is exemplified by the Buddhist monk or nun. Yet something of that lifestyle can be incorporated into both a lay and monastic life: a monk and a layperson can undertake to live by the fiveprecepts or rules of training: to refrain from killing living creatures, to refrain from taking what is not given, to refrain from sexual mis-conduct, to refrain from untrue speech, to refrain from intoxicants that bring about heedlessness. While these precepts are the basis of the Buddhist path, Buddhist teaching is more than merely a system of moral training. In order to bring the quest for release from sufferingto its conclusion something more is required. This is, of course, once more illustrated by the story of the Buddha himself. After adopting the lifestyle of a wandering ascetic, he sought out various teachers and eventually followed a particular path of practice that brought him to awakening. And in order to understand this path we must firstattempt to understand something of Buddhist theory.As we have seen, prior to embarking on his religious quest Gotama the Buddha was confronted by the reality of life’s pain and suffering.The reality of life’s pain and suffering is sometimes likened to a dis-ease from which we all suffer. The Buddha is then likened to a phys-ician who diagnoses the disease, identifies its cause, assesses the possibility of cure, and then prescribes the appropriate medicine. So if suffering is the disease, what is its cause? The answer, in a word, is ta.nhā— ‘thirst’ or ‘craving’.The suggestion is that deep in the minds of beings there is a greed or desire that manifests as an unquenchable thirst which is the principal condition for the arising of suffering. This thirst or craving takes different forms: I may crave objects, things, and pos-sessions. Or I may crave to be some particular kind of person; I may crave fame and even immortality. Alternatively, I may bitterly and resentfully turn my back on ambition, craving to be a nobody; I may become depressed and long not to exist, wishing that I had never been born; in this state I may even take my own life. I may passionately believe that I possess an immortal soul and that I will exist after death; or I may be absolutely certain in my conviction that death will be the final end, and that I shall die and there will be no more of me. From the perspective of Buddhist thought, all these feelings, desires, and beliefs are the products of the workings of craving, and our attachment to them can in the long run only cause us suffering."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"IntroductionxxxviiiOf course, to crave in the way we do is perfectly natural: we think that when our craving is fulfilled we will find happiness. At this point it begins to become apparent just how and why, in the Buddhist view, craving leads to suffering. There is a discrepancy between our craving and the world we live in, between our expectations and the way things are. We want the world to be other than it is. Our craving is based on a fundamental misjudgement of the situation: a judge-ment that assumes that when our craving gets what it wants we will be happy, that when our craving possesses the objects of its desire we will be satisfied. But such a judgement assumes a world in which things are permanent, unchanging, stable, and reliable. But the world is simply not like that. In short, in craving we fail to see how things truly are, and in failing to see how things truly are we crave. Craving and ignorance become bound in a vicious circle: the more we crave, the more confused and muddled we become; and the more confused and muddled we become, the more we crave.It follows from this that if only we could suspend our craving for a while, and still and calm our minds, we might begin to see things more clearly; and in seeing things more clearly we might find that our craving, our thirst, is quenched. This brings us to the topic of Buddhist meditation. The methods and techniques of Buddhist meditation are many and diverse, but one common way of presenting these techniques and methods is in terms of calm meditation and insight meditation.Inasmuch as our minds are habitually restless with craving — chas-ing after objects, thoughts and ideas yet never finding contentment —it follows that in order to calm the mind we need to try to stop this restlessflitting from object to object and anchor the mind to one simple object or idea. This is the primary task of calm meditation: to take a suitable object or idea and focus on that to the exclusion of other objects or ideas. The Buddhist tradition suggests a variety of meditation objects. One example is the breath. One early Buddhist text puts it like this: ‘Just mindful, he breathes in. Just mindful, he breathes out. As he breathes in a long breath, he knows he is breath-ing in a long breath; as he breathes out a long breath, he knows he is breathing out a long breath. As he breathes in a short breath, he knows he is breathing in a short breath; as he breathes out a short breath, he knows he is breathing out a short breath.’42 Anyone who 42 M I 56;Satipa.t.thāna-sutta, translated in full below."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Introductionxxxixtries such an exercise for more than a few seconds will find that it is not as easy as it may sound. Soon our minds are wandering and we are not thinking of the breath at all. According to the theory of calm meditation, there are in our minds particular mental obstacles to stilling and calming the mind. In the earliest Buddhist sources these are often identified as five in number: desire for the objects of the senses, hostility, dullness and lethargy, agitation and worry, andfinally doubt.43 As long as we have not succeeded in overcoming these, our minds will not find even temporary stillness and peace. Of course, such mental obstacles are not exclusively the obstacles to meditation practice.Anyone who has sat down to apply his or her mind to some task —understanding a difficult intellectual concept, learning a musical instrument, learning another language — has grappled with the obstacles I have just mentioned. First there is the problem that we would rather be doing something else — watching a film, reading a novel, going out with friends. This is desire for the objects of the senses. Then there is the problem that everything seems to be conspiring to make it difficult for us to get on with our task — the neighbours or children are making too much noise, the room is too cold or hot, the task has not been explained to us properly. We findourselves getting irritable — the second obstacle in the form of hostility. Then, as we contemplate the task our eyelids begin to feel heavy and a little rest seems just what we need: dullness and lethargy. Strangely though, if someone were to knock on our door at that very moment and suggest some other, more interesting activity, our sleepiness and tiredness would vanish in a moment. Yet suppose we persevere with our original task and begin to make some progress. Suddenly we become overexcited at our success; and then when the task throws up further difficulties and complexities this excitement seems prema-ture; we become dispirited and anxious about it. We experience the ups and downs of agitation and worry. Finally we begin to doubt the point of the whole enterprise. Such are the five obstacles that the practitioner of calm meditation must confront.But what happens when the meditator perseveres and succeeds in overcoming these obstacles and hindrances? According to the ancient accounts, as the meditator’s mind becomes increasingly absorbed in 43 On the five hindrances, see the full translation of the Sāmaññaphala-sutta below (D I 71–3)."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Introductionxlthe object of contemplation, the meditator experiences deeper and deeper contentment and happiness. The suggestion seems to be that, far from needing a great variety of objects and ideas to make our minds happy, if we simplify our minds, if we bring our minds to rest on one simple object, we begin to discover that our minds were in fact content and happy all along. To quote just one of the ancient similes for the attainment of this kind of meditation: ‘It is as if there were a pool where water sprang up, but which had no water flowinginto it from the east, the west, the north, or the south . . . Now when the cool waters sprang up in that pool they would suffuse,fill, soak, and drench that same pool with cool water so that no part of that pool would be untouched by the cool water.’44The happiness and contentment the mind finds in this kind of mental absorption is associated with a clarity of mind. The mind can be compared to a bowl of water. Now the mind possessed and over-come by desire for the objects of the senses, by ill-will, by dullness and lethargy, by agitation and worry, by doubt is like a bowl of water that is mixed with colouring; that has been heated on a fire and is steaming and boiling; that is covered with moss and leaves; that is ruffled by the wind, disturbed, stirred round, and rippling; that is dirty, unclear, muddy, and placed in the dark. A person withgoodeyesight looking down into such a bowl of water for the reflection of his own face would not know and see it as it is. On the other hand, if a person with good eyesight should look down into a bowl of water that is unmixed with colouring; that has not been heated on a fire, is not steaming and boiling; that is not covered with moss and leaves; that is not ruffled by the wind, but is undisturbed, not stirred round, not rippling; that is clear, bright, clean, and placed in the light; then he would know and see the reflection of his face just as it is. The state of meditation achieved by calm meditation thus allows the possibility of seeing things more clearly. This brings us to what the later Buddhisttradition often refers to as insight meditation.If, according to Buddhist teaching, we are ordinarily befuddled by the sleep of ignorance, which means that we do not see things as they truly are, then what is it that we are supposed to see when we awake from this sleep to knowledge and understanding? How are things truly? Again, none of the various traditions of Buddhism would give 44 D I 74–5 (Sāmaññaphala-sutta)."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Introductionxliprecisely the same answer to this question, but there are some commonthemes. Because of craving and ignorance we tend to be taken in by superficial appearances. We are, as it were, immature and emotion-ally naive and fail to look beneath the surface. We see and experience, therefore, a world that consists of substantial objects and beings. But, so it is said, under closer scrutiny the substantial nature of things proves elusive; this world of substantial objects and beings begins to evaporate. Just as modern physics tells us that what we experience as a table is in reality a pattern of subatomic particles, and that these ‘particles’ are not so much little bits but rather forces of some sort, so too the Buddha tells us that what we think of as ‘me’, ‘you’, ‘others’ are rather patterns of mental and physical events. In ultimate reality there is no ‘I’ or ‘you’. Words such as ‘I’ or ‘self ’ or ‘person’ are mere conventional labels for patterns of thoughts, feelings, desires, and emotions. There is no separate ‘I’ or ‘self ’ apart from the thoughts, feelings, desires, and emotions; there is no separate ‘I’ or ‘self ’ having the thoughts, feelings, desires, and emotions. In truth, the world, the universe, consists not of substantial beings or entities, but of evanescent fleeting mental and physical events. And this, it is claimed, is what the Buddha came to see directly in the stillness of his meditation one full-moon night some two-and-a-half thousand years ago. This is what the meditator who follows in the path of the Buddha hopes to come to see directly too.According to the ancient accounts, as the meditator contemplates and investigates the things that constitute the world, he finds not a world consisting of enduring and solid objects, but rather things that vanish almost as soon as they appear — like dewdrops at sunrise, like a bubble on water, like a line drawn on water, like a mustard-seed placed on the point of an awl, like a flash of lightning. Moreover, these things lack substance and always elude one’s grasp — like a mirage, a conjuring trick, a dream, the circle formed by a whirling fire brand, a fairy city, foam, or like the trunk of a banana tree (which lacks any heartwood). There is nothing to grasp or hold on to. And so the meditator, like the Buddha, does the only thing he or she can do — and lets go. The meditator stops craving and lets go of every-thing — even what is perhaps the ultimate possession, his or her own ‘self ’. For, on the Buddhist view, as long as we cling to ‘self’ we are staking our own individual claim to some bit of reality, to some part of the universe as ‘mine’. We are, as it were, saying: ‘This is mine,"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Introductionxliinot yours. Keep off!’ So where does this leave the meditator? Lost in some dark nothingness, some meaningless void? On the contrary, says the Buddhist tradition; in this ultimate and final letting go of everything, the meditator finds an even profounder peace and happi-ness. In fact this is the only true peace and happiness there is. This is the peace and happiness of nibbāna (Skt: nirvā.na) — the peace and happiness of the unconditioned, where there is no birth, old-age, sickness, and death.Paradoxically, in letting go of the ‘self ’, of the conceit ‘I am’, in ceasing to strive to make our-selves happy, we find what we have been craving all along: true and lasting happiness. But not only is this good for us, it is good for others. In letting go of our -selves, of the conceit ‘I am’, we can at last truly act self-lessly, for the benefit of others. And, of course, this is precisely how the Buddhist tradition sees the Buddha acting. For forty-five years after he attained awakening he wandered the plains of eastern India teaching others and gathering a following. In his eightieth year it is said that he died in a small town called Kusinārā. So what became of the Buddha when he died? Certainly, it is said that he is not reborn in the normal way. One who has gained awakening like the Buddha escapes finally the perpetual round of birth, death, and rebirth known as sa.msāra. But does he somehow even now exist in the peace and happiness of nirvana? The early Buddhist tradition says that this question cannot be answered in categorical terms. The Buddha and all those who have reached awakening and died are strictly ‘untraceable’. One cannot say that they exist; one cannot say that they do not exist; one cannot say that they both exist and do not exist; one cannot say that they neither exist nor do not exist.Whatever the precise metaphysical status of the Buddha, it is clear that one thing remains, and that is what the Buddhist tradition calls thedhamma (or, in Sanskrit, dharma). The term dhamma refers in the first place to the Buddha’s teachings. But dhamma is not understood merely as a set of doctrines and theories contained in written texts. Thedhamma is also the practices — the Buddha’s prescriptions for how we should behave and what needs to be done in order to bring about a true understanding of the way things are. And this brings us to a third sense of dhamma. The dhamma is the profound truth about the world that the Buddha himself realized on the night of his awak-ening, and to which his teachings show the way. Dhamma is thus at"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Introductionxliiionce the Buddha’s teachings, practices, and realization. According to the Buddhist understanding, the Buddha’s teachings and practices will eventually, with the passing of time, disappear from the world. But the dhamma, in the sense of the ultimate truth about the world, remains whether or not there is any Buddha in the world who sees it and teaches it. And although the Buddha Gotama’s teachings will disappear and be lost, sooner or later the next Buddha will come and once more discover that truth and again teach it to the world. Indeed, according to Buddhist tradition Metteyya (Skt: Maitreya), a being far advanced on the path to awakening is even now waiting in one of the realms of the gods until the teachings of the present Buddha have disappeared. Then it will be time for Metteyya to be reborn in the human realm and become the next Buddha."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"1 On the tendency of modern scholars to treat Pali suttas as pieced together rather than redacted wholes, see S. Collins, Nirvana and Other Buddhist Felicities (Cambridge, 1998),480–1.2 On these questions generally, see William A. Graham, Beyond the Written Word: Oral Aspects of Scripture in the History of Religion (Cambridge,1987); see pp. 32–3 spe-cifically on the question of silent reading.3 See Norman, A Philological Approach to Buddhism,113.NOTE ON THE TEXT AND TRANSLATIONIn presenting a selection from the Pali canon I have made the deci-sion to present complete suttas. Over the last hundred years or so a number of anthologies of Buddhist scriptures including Pali suttas have been published. Quite often editors and translators have resorted to giving short extracts. While there is nothing wrong with this practice as a means of providing in a convenient single volume a comprehensive survey of Buddhist teachings as presented in the suttas themselves, it does obscure the literary quality of the suttas.1The suttas of the Pali canon have been composed as relatively short literary pieces that are complete works in their own right; character-istically, a particular Buddhist teaching is framed in a particular narrative that draws out and adds depth to the meaning of the ideas presented.Any modern translator of Pali texts is thus faced with the problem of how to present in the form of a modern book texts that were originally composed and performed orally. We are used today to reading silently in private, but things were not always so, even in cultures where the book has been predominant. Reading aloud was probably common even until quite recently, at least until the advent of radio and television.2 So in dealing with repetition I have had in mind the possibility of reading aloud, and would suggest that this is necessary to appreciate the particular literary quality of the suttas. As I indicated above, the MSS and editions themselves frequently resort to abbreviation, although they are not always consistent in this respect; modern western editors and translators have tended to be the most radical, such that on occasion they have provoked protest from traditionalists.3 While I too have in places introduced abbrevi-ations not found in the P T S editions of the texts, I have avoided the"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"xlvkinds of device that have sometimes been used by translators (ellipsis that interrupts the grammar of sentences, the use of phrases such as ‘the paragraph above is here repeated in full’); even in silent reading such devices tend to interrupt the flow of reading, and hence under-standing and appreciation, as we struggle to work out exactly what is repeated.All the suttas presented in this volume have been translated into English before, some (such as the Satipa.t.thāna-sutta) many times, others (such as the Mahāsudassana-sutta) perhaps only two or three times, but in comparison with translators of Homer or Virgil or the Jewish and Christian biblical texts, the translator of Pali texts is exploring relatively uncharted territory with the aid of the limited materials bequeathed by a small band of pioneers. Of course, given where they set out from little more than 150 years ago, what they achieved in less than a century remains truly impressive, and some-times it seems that most of us at least simply follow in their footsteps, hardly venturing into new territory. I would thus hesitate to claim any great advances in understanding for the present set of translations.Nevertheless, in certain places I do believe I have — either on the basis of my own understanding or perhaps more often on the basis of what has been pointed out by others in the scholarly literature —been able to correct some mistakes made by earlier translators. No doubt there are other mistakes that have gone unnoticed and been repeated. I should like to think that I have not introduced new mis-takes, but probably this is a vain hope.More generally, my aim has been to produce a readable and accessible English rendering. But the ideas and concepts of early Buddhism are sometimes technical and often unfamiliar to western readers. At the same time, certain English words have acquired the status of standard renderings of particular Buddhist technical terms, and have thereby become familiar as Buddhist terms for those in the know. This has led to a situation where some complain of a tendency among translators of Pali and Sanskrit Buddhist texts to produce incomprehensible translations in ‘Buddhist hybrid English’ (after an expression used to characterize the way Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit fails to conform to the norms of classical Sanskrit). I have done my best to avoid over-literalness and lapsing into Buddhist hybrid English by asking myself, as Margaret Cone recommends: ‘What would an Indian hearer have understood from this passage? . . . what Note on the Text and Translation"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"xlviis he saying?’4 But inevitably there is a question of balance between preserving something of the idiom in which ancient Buddhists chose to express themselves, and achieving patterns of expression familiar to the native speaker of English. Some may think I have gone too far, others not far enough.I have though aimed at full translation, and for the most part kept my translation free of technical Pali terms. Of course, some of the technical vocabulary of Indian culture and religion has found its way into the English language and into the Oxford English Dictionary(OED). Where this is the case I have sometimes, but not always, used the Pali or Sanskrit term in one of its accepted English spell-ings, even where the definitions offered in English dictionaries may leave something to be desired from the perspective of strict Buddhist understanding. Thus we have ‘brahman’ (brāhma.na) rather than ‘a member of the priestly class’; the awakened disciples of the Buddha, the Buddhist ‘worthy ones’ or ‘saints’, remain simply ‘arahats’; the final goal of the Buddhist path, the escape from the round of rebirth, is left as ‘nibbana’ (since this Pali spelling is recognized by the OEDalongside the more familiar Sanskrit ‘nirvana’). Another word now found in the OED, and which I have for the most part left untrans-lated, is ‘Tathāgata’, an epithet of the Buddha, and the term com-monly used by the Buddha apparently to refer to himself. The precise significance of the term is not clear, but in certain contexts it seems to be used more generally to refer to anyone who has achieved awakening, and in a sense close to its literal meaning of ‘one like this’ or ‘one who has reached this state’. Another, less frequent epithet of the Buddha, namely sugata or ‘one who has reached a happy or good state’, I have rendered as ‘the Happy One’.Another important epithet of the Buddha is bhagavat. This is the term normally used in Buddhist writings to refer to the Buddha. It means literally ‘possessing good fortune’, but early in Indian litera-ture came to be used as an honorific title for gods and holy men. In later literature it comes especially to be used as a term for ‘the Lord’ in the sense of the divine or God, as in Bhagavad-gītā or ‘song of the 4 Margaret Cone, ‘caveat lector’,Journal of the Pali Text Society,29 (2007),95–106.See also P. J. Griffiths, ‘Buddhist Hybrid English: Some Notes on Philology and Hermeneutics for Buddhologists’, Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies,4 (1981),17–32; K. R.

One term that is given in the OED in both its Sanskritic and Pali spelling is dharma or dhamma. This is, of course, a term of some complexity and depth. It is, I would argue, used in the Pali texts in a number of distinct senses which at the same time refer to and assume each other.5 In the first place, dhammais the fundamental basis or nature of things generally, the Truth about the way things are. Secondly, it is the behaviour, the practice, prescribed by the Buddha in order to achieve a direct realization of the Truth about the way things are; dhamma is the Teaching of the Buddha. And thirdly, dhammas are the good qualities that should be developed in order to progress along the Buddhist path. Fourthly, adhamma is the fundamental basis or nature of things taken indi-vidually;dhammas are the particular qualities that together are reality. Buddhist writings are at pains, however, to point out that the fundamental basis or nature of things is not some underlying, imma-nent absolute, but rather the ultimate quality of things is simply that they rise and fall in dependence on each other. Nonetheless, realiza-tion of this quality is the ultimate freedom from suffering. These meanings of dhamma are not always mutually exclusive in a given context, but having made the decision to translate dhamma in all contexts, I have nonetheless opted for one of ‘Truth’, ‘teaching’, ‘practice’, or ‘quality’.To some my choice will no doubt appear arbi-trary, and sometimes even wrong. Certainly, in some cases I might have chosen otherwise.Some Indian terms, while found in the OED, remain relatively unfamiliar. Thus, for example, despite the occurrence of both ‘bhikku’ and ‘bhikshu’ in the dictionary, I have rendered bhikkhu as ‘monk’. Some might complain that this is misleading, since a bhikkhu5 See R. Gethin, ‘He who sees dhamma sees dhammas: Dhamma in Early Buddhism’, Journal of Indian Philosophy,32 (2004),513–42.Note on the Text and Translation"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"xlviiiis not precisely the same as a Christian monk. True, but I have judged that to talk of Buddhist ‘monks’ is the norm among English speakers, and that ‘monk’ conveys a sufficiently meaningful sense of what a bhikkhu is.Another problem facing translators of Pali texts is the treatment of honorifics and forms of address. The tendency in the modern cultures where English is the first language is increasingly to do away with titles and surnames (‘Mrs Smith’, ‘Dr Jones’) as tied to an out-moded and even ‘politically incorrect’ social hierarchy. All exchanges, whatever the context, become reduced to first-name — or even nick-name — familiarity (‘Sue’ and ‘Bob’), often from the outset. The Pali suttas were composed in a culture where this was not so, where forms of respectful address indicated social status and standing relative to the person addressed. Thus, kings are addressed by some as deva or ‘god’, which I have rendered as ‘lord’, by others, such as the Buddha, asmahārāja which I have rendered as ‘your majesty’, though it might have been retained as sufficiently familiar in English. The term āvusois a polite form of address that nevertheless indicates that the speaker claims a rank that is at least equal to the person addressed; thus it is commonly used in the Pali texts when those who are not followers of the Buddha address the Buddha. Among Buddhist monks it is only to be used by a senior monk addressing a more junior monk. Brahmans, on the other hand, always address the Buddha as ‘bhoGotama’, using the honorificbho and his clan name; one might render this as ‘Mr Gotama’, except that its effect would be comical. Followers of the Buddha address monks as bhante without the addi-tion of any name. Such forms of address cannot be translated literally;like the English ‘Mr’, they have in Pali lost any meaning apart from their use as honorifics. I have chosen to render āvuso as ‘friend’, and bothbho and bhante as ‘sir’.Pali tends to repeat titles in full every time a person is mentioned. Thus, in the first sutta translated in this volume the king is always ‘King Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the princess of Videha’. Such repe-tition seems unnatural and excessive in English, so I have reduced it to ‘King Ajātasattu of Magadha’. Similarly, Pali tends to repeat vocative forms of address and the names of those addressed in a way that again seems unnatural and excessive in English, so these are sometimes omitted.Note on the Text and Translation"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"xlixThere are no standard critical editions of the texts of the Pali canon. Like other ancient Indian languages, Pali is also not associated with one particular system of writing and has for many centuries been written in a variety of scripts. These all ultimately derive from the Brahmī script used by the emperor Aśoka for his inscriptions in the third century bce. Most surviving Pali manuscripts are written in Sinhala, Burmese, or Mūl (Cambodian) script. The first printed editions of Pali texts were produced in the nineteenth century, and from1882 the Pali Text Society (P T S), founded by T. W. Rhys Davids(1843–1922) in 1881, began publishing European editions of the works of the Pali canon and its commentaries transliterated into a Roman alphabet expanded by the use of diacritical marks to reflect Indian scripts. By the end of the first decade of the twentieth century the P T S had published editions of most of the works of the canon. These were pioneering editions, often based on one or two manuscripts that happened to be available. While some have since been revised and corrected, most have not. Important Asian editions of the Pali canon have been published in Siam in Thai script (King Chulalongkorn’s edition of 1893–4 and the Syāmara.t.thassa Tepi.takam of 1925–8), in Burma in Burmese script (the Cha.t.thasamgīti or Sixth Council edi-tion of 1956–62), and in Ceylon in Sinhala script (the Buddha Jayanti Tripi.taka of 1957–89).6 The last three of these editions have also recently been digitized. Nevertheless, since the P T S editions have remained widely available and are kept in print to this day by the Society, it is these, despite their imperfections, that have become the scholarly basis for study of the Pali canon. The pre sent transla-tion is thus based in the first place on the edition of the Pali text as published by the P T S. I have, however, also referred to Asian edi-tions, and where I have preferred a reading from these that signifi-cantly affects the translation I have drawn attention to this in the notes. To allow cross-referencing with the original Pali text and other translations, the pagination of the PTS edition of the Pali text is given in the margins. An asterisk in the text refers to the Explanatory Notesat the back of the book.6 On editions of Pali texts see Günter Grönbold, Karl Dachs, and Renate Stephan, Die Worte des Buddha in den Sprachen der Welt (Munich, 2005),31–59.Note on the Text and Translation"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"SELECT BIBLIOGRAPHYAdikaram, E.

The bulk of the sutta takes the form of a dialogue between King Ajātasattu of Magadha and the Buddha. Ajātasattu is known also from Jain and Hindu sources. Considerable narrative tension at the beginning of the sutta derives from the fact that the listeners know that King Ajātasattu has been an associate of the monk Devadatta who, as an early Buddhist tradition tells us, sought to challenge the Buddha for authority over the San ̇gha and indeed on several occasions even attempted to kill him.1 Encouraged by Devadatta, Ajātasattu took the throne of Magadha and killed his father, King Bimbisāra. He is thus a deeply troubled man, tormented in his sleep by disturbing dreams;2 he is in desperate need of some means of salving his guilty conscience. At the opening of this sutta we find this king seated outside on a beautiful, still, moonlit night which, it seems, only has the effect of heightening his own sense of inner torment. His ministers, eager perhaps to please a potentially dangerous master, nervously suggest the names of various religious teachers he might visit, not daring, in view of the king’s past, to suggest the Buddha.3 But, as we presently find out, Ajātasattu has heard what these other well-known religious teachers of his day have to say, and he has not been impressed. In fact it is precisely a meeting with the Buddha that he desires; but, given his past conduct, he feels in need of some help in approaching the Buddha. Finally JīvakaKomārabhacca, the royal physician and one of the great lay supporters (upāsaka) of the Buddha and his monks, comes to his rescue.The six religious teachers whom it is suggested King Ajātasattu might visit are usually referred to in early Buddhist texts as a group; each is rep-resented as making a claim to ‘direct knowledge’ (abhiññā) (D II 150–1;M I 198). Collectively they come to be referred to by the Buddhist tradi-tion as the six titthiyas (Skt: tīrthika), a term which is often rendered ‘heretic’, but which seems to be short for añña-titthiya, meaning strictly only ‘belonging to a religious sect or school other than one’s own’. Three 1 Vin II 184–203.2 Sv 140.3 The ancient commentary records a slightly different motivation on the part of the king’s ministers: each is eager to promote his own religious teacher (Sv 142)."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"From the Collection of Long Sayings6of the teachers (Pūra.na Kassapa, Makkhali Gosāla, and Pakudha Kaccāyana)are to be associated with the ancient Indian religion of Ājīvikism, which taught a doctrine of strict determinism (niyati), and fl ourished at least down to the fourteenth century.4 Ajita Kesakambalin is associated with the materialist doctrine of the Lokāyata or Cārvāka system, known from other Indian sources; Niga.n.tha Nātaputta is none other than Mahāvīra, the historical founder of Jainism; finally Sañjaya Bela.t.thiputta expounds a kind of scepticism that refuses to commit to any proposition.At the heart of the discourse is an exposition of the progressive stages of the Buddha’s path: the cultivation of good conduct, the four stages of absorption (jhāna), the various direct knowledges (abhiññā) culminating in the knowledge of suffering, its arising, its cessation, and the path leading to its cessation (i.e. the four ariya-sacca or ‘noble truths’) which consti-tutes ‘awakening’ (bodhi). This is the classic early account of the Buddhist path, repeated in full in ten of the thirteen suttas of the first volume of the Dīgha-nikāya and, with some variation, in a number of suttas of the Majjhima-nikāya.5The sutta sets this account of the path in a framework which presents it as an answer to a basic question (here posed by Ajātasattu): why embark on the difficult and demanding life of an ascetic? The answer the sutta seeks to give is, in short, not because it promises rewards after death, but because, more surely than any other way of life, it brings with it a secure happiness here and now: the freedom of the life of a religious wanderer or ascetic (sama.na); the happiness of a guilt-free conscience (anavajja-sukha)that comes with a life lived in accordance with moral precepts; the happi-ness of the composed mind (avyāseka-sukha) of one who is mindful in all he does; the joy, happiness, and peace of the jhānas; such extraordinary abilities (iddhi) that come with mastery of the jhānas as multiplying one’s body, making oneself invisible, passing through walls, walking on water, flying through the air; and finally, the direct knowledge that one is freed from the endless cycle of rebirth.This is what I have heard.* Once the Blessed One was staying in Rājagaha in the mango grove of Jīvaka Komārabhacca* with a great 4 See A.

Now on that observance day King Ajātasattu of Magadha breathed a sigh: ‘Delightful indeed is this moonlit night! Beautiful indeed is this moonlit night! Lovely indeed is this moonlit night! Peaceful indeed is this moonlit night! Auspicious indeed is this moonlit night! What ascetic or brah-man might we visit tonight so that our heart might be set at rest?’At these words one of the ministers said to King Ajātasattu of Magadha: ‘There is, lord, Pūrana Kassapa. He has a company and a following and is the teacher of that following; he is well known, of some repute, one who has found a way across;* he is thought holy by many, and possesses the pearls of wisdom;* he went forth into the religious life long ago and is experienced and of great age.

Then the king said to Jīvaka Komārabhacca.‘But why, good Jīvaka, do you remain silent?’‘There is, lord, the Blessed One, an arahat and perfect buddha,* who is staying in my mango grove with a great company of monks — twelve hundred and fifty monks. Moreover this lovely report has been spread abroad concerning the Blessed Gotama: For the following reasons is he the Blessed One — he is an arahat, a perfect buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, happy, one who understands the world, an unsurpassed charioteer of men to be tamed, teacher of gods and men, a blessed buddha.

Then he announced to King Ajātasattu of Magadha: ‘The elephants have been made ready for your journey, lord. It is now time for you to do as you think fit.’Then King Ajātasattu of Magadha had one of his wives mounted on each of the five hundred she-elephants, while he himself mounted the riding tusker, and then accompanied by torch-bearers he went out from Rājagaha in great royal splendour, and set off towards Jīvaka Komārabhacca’s mango grove. Now not far from the mango grove King Ajātasattu of Magadha was gripped by fear; he was para-lysed and the hairs of his body stood on end. Frightened and agitated, with his hair standing on end, King Ajātasattu of Magadha said to Jīvaka Komārabhacca: ‘Are you perhaps deceiving me, good Jīvaka?Are you perhaps tricking me, good Jīvaka? Are you perhaps going to hand me over to my enemies, good Jīvaka? For how can it be that from a great company of twelve hundred and fifty monks there is not a sneeze, not a cough, not a murmur?’‘Do not be afraid, your majesty. I am not deceiving you. I am not tricking you. I am not going to hand you over to your enemies. Go on, your majesty! Go on! There are the lamps burning in the centre of the pavilion.’Then when he had gone by elephant as far as the ground would allow, King Ajātasattu of Magadha dismounted and approached the entrance of the assembly hall on foot. As he was approaching, he said to Jīvaka Komārabhacca: ‘But where is the Blessed One, good Jīvaka?’‘There is the Blessed One, your majesty. There is the Blessed One, your majesty, seated in front of the company of monks, resting his back on the central pole, facing east.’Then King Ajātasattu of Magadha approached the Blessed One and stood to one side. As he stood there surveying the company of monks which remained completely silent like a still pool, King Ajātasattu of Magadha breathed a sigh: ‘May my son the prince Udāyibhadda* come to possess such calm as is now possessed by the company of monks!’‘Your thoughts have turned to one you love.’‘The prince Udāyibhadda is dear to me, sir.

There are elephant riders, cavalrymen, charioteers, archers, standard-bearers, spies, quartermas-ters, high-ranking royal officers, front-line soldiers, great fighters, warriors, leather-clad soldiers, household slaves, cooks, barbers, bath attendants, sweet-makers, garland-makers, washermen, weavers, bas-ket makers, potters, those skilled in accounts and calculation, and various other professions of a similar sort. These people enjoy the evident fruits of their labour here and now: by their work they bring happiness and joy to themselves, they bring happiness and joy to their mothers and fathers, to their wives and children, and to their friends and acquaintances; and they provide ascetics and brahmans with excel-lent offerings, for the sake of the world to come, bringing happy results and making for a heavenly rebirth.

Is it possible to point out a fruit of the ascetic life that is similarly evident here and now?”‘When I had asked this, Pūrana Kassapa answered me as follows: “When one injures or gets another to injure, wounds or gets another to wound, tortures or gets another to torture, causes grief or distress, intimidates or gets others to intimidate; when one harms living crea-tures, takes what is not given, breaks into houses, plunders, commits burglary, waits in ambush on the road, goes with others’ wives, tells lies — when one acts then no wrong is done. If someone were to take a razor-edged discus and make of the creatures of this earth one sin-gle mass of flesh, one single heap of flesh, there would be nothing bad in that, nothing bad would come of it. Again, if someone were to go along the southern bank of the Ganges killing and getting others to kill, wounding and getting others to wound, torturing and getting others to torture, there would be nothing bad in that, nothing bad would come of it. Again, if someone were to go along the northern bank of the Ganges making gifts and getting others to make gifts, performing sacrifices and getting others to perform sacrifices, there would be nothing good in that, nothing good would come of it. In giving, discipline, restraint and speaking the truth, there is nothing good, nothing good comes of them.”‘In this way, sir, when he was asked about an evident fruit of the ascetic life, Pūrana Kassapa gave an explanation of the non-existence of action.* It is as if someone who was asked about a mango gave an explanation of a breadfruit, or someone who was asked about a breadfruit gave an explanation of a mango.‘Then, sir, I thought, “But how is a person like me to judge whether an ascetic or brahman living in my realm should be reproached?”* So I neither agreed nor disagreed with Pūrana Kassapa’s words.

Is it possible to point out a fruit of the ascetic life that is similarly evident here and now?”‘When I had asked this Makkhali Gosāla answered me as follows: “There is no reason nor cause for the defilement of beings: beings become defiled without any reason and without any cause. There is no reason nor cause for the purification of beings: beings become purified without any reason and without any cause. There is nothing one can do, nothing anyone else can do. No human action, no force, no effort, no human striving, no human endeavour has any effect. All beings, all breathing things, all living things, all organisms are impo-tent, without any power or strength: they are developed by fate, chance, and nature, experiencing happiness and unhappiness in the six types of existence.* There are 1,400,000 principal kinds of birth, plus 6,000 and 600; there are 500 actions, plus 5 actions, 3 actions, 1 action, and half an action; there are 62 ways, 62 lesser aeons,6 types, 8 human stages; there are 4,900 births as an ascetic, 4,900 as a wanderer, 4,900 among the Nāgas,*2,000 as companions of the chief of gods,*36 in dusty places, 7 sentient births, 7 insenti-ent births, 7 births without bonds, 7 divine, 7 human, 7 demonic; there are 7 lakes, 7 transferences of the soul plus 700,*7 falls plus 700,7 dreams plus 700—for 8,400,000 great aeons the fool and the wise man alike will roam and wander before bringing suffering to an end. So it is no use thinking that by means of virtuous behaviour, by some vow, penance, or spiritual practice, one can bring unripe karma to fruition, or deliberately exhaust ripe karma. This cannot be done. Happiness and unhappiness come in fixed measures, and the round of rebirth has a definite limit. There is no way to make it longer or shorter, no way to make it better or worse. It is just like a ball of string that has been let go so that it rolls out until it has unravelled —in exactly the same way the fool and wise man alike will roam and wander before bringing suffering to an end.”‘In this way, sir, when he was asked about an evident fruit of the ascetic life, Makkhali Gosāla gave an explanation of purificationthrough the round of birth. It is as if someone who was asked about 54"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"13a mango gave an explanation of a breadfruit, or someone who was asked about a breadfruit gave an explanation of a mango.‘Then, sir, I thought, “But how is a person like me to judge whether an ascetic or brahman living in my realm should be reproached?” So I neither agreed nor disagreed with Makkhali Gosāla’s words. And although my heart was not gladdened, I did not voice my dissatisfaction, but got up from my seat and went away, neither accepting his words nor countering them.‘And once, sir, I approached Ajita of the Blanket of Hair. Having approached, I saluted him respectfully and exchanged pleasing and polite words with him, before sitting down to one side. Once seated, I said to Ajita of the Blanket of Hair: “Ajita sir, there are various professions . . . These people enjoy the evident fruits of their labour here and now . . . Is it possible to point out a fruit of the ascetic life that is similarly evident here and now?”‘When I had asked this Ajita of the Blanket of Hair answered me as follows: “Giving is nothing, sacrifice and offerings are nothing; good and bad deeds have no fruit or result; there is no this world and the next; one’s mother and father are nothing; there are no beings born in heaven, no ascetics or brahmans who have reached perfection and live the perfect life, who gain for themselves a direct knowledge of this world and the next, and, having experienced it directly, make it known. A person is formed of the four elements, and when he dies the earth returns to and merges with the general mass of earth, the water with the general mass of water, the fire with the general mass offire, the air with the general mass of air; the sense faculties pass into the ether. Four men put the dead body on a bier and go. They talk about him as far as the cremation ground, and there his bones turn grey, and his offerings end in ashes. The idea of giving is stupid —the empty and lying prattle of those who declare there is some point to life. After the breaking up of the body the fool and the wise man alike are cut off and perish. They do not survive after death.”‘In this way, sir, when he was asked about an evident fruit of the ascetic life, Ajita of the Blanket of Hair gave an explanation of the doctrine of nihilism. It is as if someone who was asked about a mango gave an explanation of a breadfruit, or someone who was asked about a breadfruit gave an explanation of a mango.‘Then, sir, I thought, “But how is a person like me to judge whether an ascetic or brahman living in my realm should be The Fruits of the Ascetic Life5556"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"From the Collection of Long Sayings14reproached?” So I neither agreed nor disagreed with Ajita of the Blanket of Hair’s words.

Having approached, I saluted him respectfully and exchanged pleasing and polite words with him, before sitting down to one side. Once seated, I said to Pakudha Kaccāyana: “Kaccāyana sir, there are various pro-fessions . . . These people enjoy the evident fruits of their labour here and now . . . Is it possible to point out a fruit of the ascetic life that is similarly evident here and now?”‘When I had asked this Pakudha Kaccāyana answered me as fol-lows: “There are seven primary constituents that are not made nor constructed, not created nor produced; they cannot be damaged, and stand erect and firm as pillars. They do not move or alter; they can-not bring harm to one another, nor can one affect the happiness, unhappiness, or happiness and unhappiness of the others. What are these seven? The constituent of earth, the constituent of water, the constituent of fire, the constituent of wind, happiness, unhappiness, and the soul the seventh. These are the seven primary constituents . . . So there is no one who kills or causes one to kill, no one who hears or causes one to hear, no one who perceives or causes one to perceive. If someone cuts off someone’s head with a sharp sword, he doesn’t take anyone’s life: the sword just passes through the space between these seven constituents.”‘In this way, sir, when he was asked about an evident fruit of the ascetic life, Pakudha Kaccāyana gave an explanation of one thing in terms of another. It is as if someone who was asked about a mango gave an explanation of a breadfruit, or someone who was asked about a breadfruit gave an explanation of a mango.‘Then, sir, I thought, “But how is a person like me to judge whether an ascetic or brahman living in my realm should be reproached?” So I neither agreed nor disagreed with Pakudha Kaccāyana’s words. And although my heart was not gladdened, I did not voice my dissatisfaction, but got up from my seat and went away, neither accepting his words nor countering them.‘And once, sir, I approached the Nigan.tha Nātaputta.* Having approached, I saluted him respectfully and exchanged pleasing and polite words with him, before sitting down to one side.

And when, your majesty, a Nigan.tha is controlled by the discipline of the four restraints in this way, he is called one who is accomplished in himself, one who is controlled in himself, one who is firm in himself.”‘In this way, sir, when he was asked about an evident fruit of the ascetic life, the Nigan.tha Nātaputta gave an explanation of the disci-pline of the four restraints. It is as if someone who was asked about a mango gave an explanation of a breadfruit, or someone who was asked about a breadfruit gave an explanation of a mango.‘Then, sir, I thought, “But how is a person like me to judge whether an ascetic or brahman living in my realm should be reproached?” So I neither agreed nor disagreed with Nigan.thaNātaputta’s words.

From one point of view, it is a narrative stitched together by incorporating various shorter accounts, many of which are found elsewhere in the canon. Rhys Davids estimated that intoto only about one-third of the sutta is original. Nevertheless, as Steven Collins points out, the sutta is also a carefully crafted whole.1Beginning on Vultures’ Peak outside the Magadhan capital of Rājagaha,it tells the story of the Buddha’s final journey, death, and funeral. Two themes run throughout: the welfare of the Buddhist community after the death of the Buddha, and the devotions due the Buddha. But the sutta is also a majestic and poignant meditation on a more general Buddhist theme, that of impermanence and loss. We are reminded throughout the sutta that ‘we must lose and be deprived of and separated from everything pleasant and dear’, that it cannot happen ‘that something that is born, come into being, conditioned, and of a nature to decay should not decay’. At the same time, against the background of the Buddha’s attainment of final nibbana, the sutta reiterates that the Buddha has done what buddhas must do; he has established the monastic community and taught the way for others to also reach nibbana.At the beginning of the sutta the Buddha is visited by King Ajātasattu’sminister Vassakāra to seek advice on the wisdom of waging war on the republican state of the Vajjis. This becomes the prompt for the Buddha to set out at length the principles to be followed by the Buddhist Sa.ngha if it is to avoid decline. From Rājagaha the Buddha journeys north to Nālandāwhere he meets, apparently for the last time, his disciple who was said to be chief in wisdom, Sāriputta. From Nālandā he continues north-west to the village of Pā.tali where he once more encounters Vassakāra, this time engaged in building defences against the Vajjis in a village that will become capital of the Mauryan empire and the most important city in India: Pā.taliputra (modern Patna).The Buddha then crosses the Ganges and continues in stages to Vesālī,the principal city of the Vajjis. He spends the three months of the rainy season (July to October) at Beluva, a village outside Vesālī, where he falls ill. 1 Collins, Nirvana and Other Buddhist Felicities (Cambridge, 1998),437–45."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"From the Collection of Long Sayings38Although he recovers from this illness, he soon afterwards renounces the possibility of living longer, even until the end of the aeon; having informed Māra that he will die in three months’ time, he makes his announcement to the assembled monks of Vesālī. Continuing his journey northwestwards he reaches Pāvā, where he eats a meal offered to him by Cunda the smith which is the cause of his final sickness. On the way from Pāvā to Kusināra he meets Pukkusa and accepts him as his last lay disciple. Outside Kusinārā he asks Ānanda to prepare a bed for him between two sāl trees.In one of the most poignant episodes of the sutta, after a conversation with the Buddha about how his body should be treated after his death, the reality of his teacher’s imminent death is brought home to Ānanda, the Buddha’s faithful attendant, who has yet to reach the final goal of arahat-ship.Ānanda withdraws and breaks down in tears. He is summoned again by the Buddha, who encourages him to make the effort to achieve the finalgoal.Ānanda then urges the Buddha not to die in the tiny, insignificanttown of Kusinārā, at which the Buddha recounts how in ages long past Kusinārā was a fabulous royal capital. This tale itself becomes a mythic meditation on impermanence that, when expanded, forms a sutta in itself, theMahāsudassana-sutta, which follows the Mahāparinibbāna-sutta and is also included in the present volume.Having ordained his last monk, Subhadda, a wanderer from another school, the Buddha addresses the monks for the last time and attains finalnibbana. There then follow accounts of the arrival of a group of monks headed by Mahākassapa (destined to become the master of ceremonies at the communal recitation at Rājagaha), and of the Buddha’s funeral and the distribution of his relics.The sutta and its various parallels in Sanskrit, Chinese, and Tibetan have been the subject of considerable scholarly discussion; see, for example, D. Snellgrove, ‘S-ākyamuni’sfinal Nirvāna’,Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies,36 (1973),399–411; for further references and discus-sion of the Buddha’s funeral and his relics, see John Strong, Relics of the Buddha (Princeton: 2004),98–123, and Rita Langer, Buddhist Rituals of Death and Rebirth (London, 2007),99–115.[First section for recitation]This is what I have heard.

He has declared that he will attack the powerful and mighty Vajjis, that he will cut them down, that he will destroy them, that he will bring about their ruin and devastation!” Then you should note carefully what the Blessed One says in response and come and tell me, for the Tathāgatas do not speak what is untrue.’‘Yes, my lord,’ replied the brahman Vassakāra, the chief minister of Magadha.And then he had the best carriages harnessed, and mounting one he drove out of Rājagaha in a cortege of carriages and set off for Vultures’ Peak. When he had gone by carriage as far as the ground would allow, he dismounted and approached the Blessed One on foot. Having approached, he saluted the Blessed One respectfully and exchanged pleasing and polite words with him, before sitting down to one side.Once seated, he said to the Blessed One: ‘Gotama sir, King Ajātasattu of Magadha bows down at your feet with his head and asks if you are free of sickness and disease, if you are in good health and strong, if you live at ease.

Clearly King Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the princess of Videha, will not overcome the Vajjis in war without some intrigue, without creating dissension among them.* And now, Gotama sir, I should be going.

He has confidence in the Truth because he knows that the Truth that is clear, immediate, accessible, practical, and that one who is discerning can come to know for himself, has been well explained by the Blessed One.* He has confidence in the Community because he knows that the Community of the Blessed One consisting of the eight persons in four pairs* conducts itself well, honestly, skilfully, and properly, that it is a Community deserving of offerings, hospitality, presents, and respect, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world. He possesses ways of conduct that are dear to the noble ones, of the kind that are unbro-ken, without defect, unblemished, without flaw, clear, praised by the discerning, untarnished, and conducive to concentration. This, Ānanda, is the mirror of Truth, the way of Truth with which the noble disciple who wishes could by himself describe himself . . . ’Now while he was staying at Nādika, the Blessed One talked to the monks a lot about the teaching in these terms: he explained how it is The Buddha’s Final Nibbana94"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"From the Collection of Long Sayings54with good conduct, how it is with concentration, how it is with wisdom — how concentration that is invested with good conduct is of great fruit and of great benefit, how wisdom that is invested with concentration is of great fruit and of great benefit, and how the mind that is invested with wisdom is fully released from the taints, namely the taint of sense desire, the taint of being, the taint of view, the taint of ignorance.Now when the Blessed One had stayed at Nādika as long as he wanted, he spoke to the venerable Ānanda: ‘Come, Ānanda, we shall move on to Vesālī.’‘Yes, sir,’ replied the venerable Ānanda to the Blessed One.Then the Blessed One made his way with a large community of monks to Vesālī, where he stayed in Ambapālī’s grove.There the Blessed One addressed the monks: ‘A monk should live mindfully, with full awareness. This is my instruction to you. How does a monk live mindfully? In this case a monk lives watching the body as body; he is determined, fully aware, mindful, overcoming his longing for and discontent with the world. He lives watching feel-ings as feelings; he is determined, fully aware, mindful, overcoming his longing for and discontent with the world. He lives watching mind as mind; he is determined, fully aware, mindful, overcoming his longing for and discontent with the world. He lives watching qualities as qualities; he is determined, fully aware, mindful, over-coming his longing for and discontent with the world. It is in this way that a monk lives mindfully.‘How does a monk live with full awareness? In moving forward and turning back, a monk acts with full awareness; in looking ahead and looking around, he acts with full awareness; in bending and straightening his limbs, he acts with full awareness; in wearing his inner and outer robes and carrying his alms bowl, he acts with full awareness; in eating, drinking, chewing and swallowing, he acts with full awareness; in defecating and urinating, he acts with full aware-ness; in walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up, speak-ing, and keeping silent, he acts with full awareness. It is in this way that a monk lives with full awareness. A monk should live mindfully, with full awareness. This is my instruction to you.’Now when the courtesan Ambapālī* heard people say that the Blessed One had reached Vesālī and was staying in her mango grove, she had the best carriages harnessed, and mounting one, she drove 95"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"55out of Vesālī in a cortege of carriages and set off for the park. When she had gone by carriage as far as the ground would allow, she dis-mounted and approached the Blessed One on foot. Having approached, she saluted the Blessed One respectfully and exchanged pleasing and polite words with him, before sitting down to one side. Once Ambapālī was seated, the Blessed One instructed her with talk about the teaching, encouraging, enthusing, and inspiring her.Instructed, encouraged, enthused, and inspired by his talk, she said to the Blessed One: ‘May the Blessed One along with the com-munity of monks accept my invitation for tomorrow’s meal.’By his silence the Blessed One accepted. Understanding that he had accepted her invitation, Ambapālī got up from her seat, respect-fully saluted the Blessed One, and left, keeping him on her right. Now when the Licchavis* of Vesālī heard people say that the Blessed One [96] had reached Vesālī and was staying in Ambapālī’s grove, they had the best carriages harnessed, and mounting them, they drove out of Vesālī in a cortege of carriages. Some of these Licchavis were in blue — made up in blue, dressed in blue, and adorned with blue. Some were in yellow — made up in yellow, dressed in yellow, and adorned with yellow. Some were in red — made up in red, dressed in red, and adorned with red. Some were in white — made up in white, dressed in white, and adorned with white.And when the courtesan Ambapālī came past, scraping the young Licchavis’ axles, wheels, and yokes with hers, the Licchavis asked her: ‘Ambapālī, how come you are scraping past the young Licchavis like this?’‘Because, young men, I have just invited the Blessed One and the community of monks for tomorrow’s meal.’‘Ambapālī, give up this meal for a hundred thousand pieces!’‘Young men, even if you were to give me Vesālī and its country-side, I would not give up a meal of this importance.’Then the Licchavis snapped their fingers. ‘We’ve been outdone by the mango girl! We’ve been cheated by the mango girl!’*Then the Licchavis went on to Ambapālī’s grove. When the Blessed One saw the Licchavis coming in the distance, he said to the monks: ‘Any monks who have never seen the Gods of the Thirty-Three should just look at this group of Licchavis — gaze on it and focus on it as though it were the assembly of the Thirty-Three.’*The Buddha’s Final Nibbana9697"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"From the Collection of Long Sayings56When the Licchavis had gone by carriage as far as the ground would allow, they dismounted and approached the Blessed One on foot.

We’ve been cheated by the mango girl!’When the Licchavis had enjoyed and expressed their appreciation of what the Blessed One said, they got up from their seats, respect-fully saluted the Blessed One, and left, keeping him on their right.When the night was over, Ambapālī had fine foods of differentsorts prepared in her own park. Then she had the Blessed One informed: ‘It is time, sir. The meal is ready.’Then, early in the morning, the Blessed One put on his outer robes and, taking his bowl, went together with the community of monks to where the meal was being served and sat down on the pre-pared seat. Then Ambapālī the courtesan waited on the Blessed One and the community of monks, serving them with the fine foods with her own hands. And when the Blessed One had finished eating and washed his hands and bowl, she brought a low seat and sat down to one side.Once seated, she said to the Blessed One: ‘Sir, I am giving this park to the Buddha and his community of monks.’The Blessed One accepted the park, and then after he had instructed Ambapālī with talk about the teaching, encouraging, enthusing, and inspiring her, he left.Now while he was staying at Vesālī in Ambapālī’s grove, the Blessed One talked to the monks a lot about the teaching in these terms: he explained how it is with good conduct, how it is with con-centration, how it is with wisdom — how concentration that is invested with good conduct is of great fruit and of great benefit, how wisdom that is invested with concentration is of great fruit and of 98"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"57great benefit, and how the mind that is invested with wisdom is fully released from the taints, namely the taint of sense desire, the taint of being, the taint of view, the taint of ignorance.Now when the Blessed One had stayed in Ambapālī’s grove as long as he wanted, he spoke to the venerable Ānanda: ‘Come, Ānanda, we shall move on to the village of Beluva.’‘Yes, sir,’ replied the venerable Ānanda to the Blessed One. Then the Blessed One made his way with a large community of monks to the village of Beluva.While he was staying there he addressed the monks: ‘Monks, go anywhere around Vesālī— where you have friends, where you are known, where you have supporters — and enter upon the rainy sea-son* there. I will enter upon it here in the village of Beluva.’‘Yes, sir,’ replied those monks.And so they entered upon the rainy season around Vesālī . . . and the Blessed One entered upon it in Beluva. When the Blessed One had entered upon the rainy season he fell seriously ill, sufferingsevere pains as though he were close to death. Without complaining, the Blessed One accepted the pains mindfully and with full aware-ness. Then it occurred to the Blessed One: ‘It would not be right for me to reach final nibbana without my having addressed those attend-ing on me and having taken my leave of the community of monks. Suppose I should suppress this illness by force and live by control-ling the vital energy.’So the Blessed One suppressed his illness by force and lived by controlling his vital energy. And so he recovered from his illness. Soon after he had recovered he came out from his dwelling and sat down on the prepared seat in the shade of the building. Then the venerableĀnanda came to him and sat down to one side.Once seated, he spoke to the Blessed One: ‘I can see that the Blessed One is comfortable. I can see that the Blessed One is bearing up. And although when the Blessed One was ill my body seemed to be drugged and I did not know where to turn and things were not clear to me, nevertheless I had just enough confidence to feel that the Blessed One would not reach final nibbana without saying something about the Community of monks.’‘But what does the Community of monks want from me, Ānanda?I have taught the Truth without considering who is an insider and who an outsider.

Surely if there is someone who thinks that it is he who should be in charge of the Community of monks or that the Community of monks is his particular concern, then it is he who should say something about the Community of monks. But the Tathāgata does not think that it is he who should be in charge of the Community of monks or that the Community of monks is his particular concern, so why should he say something about the Community of monks?‘I am an old and aged man, Ānanda, an elder who has done his time and reached old age. I have turned eighty, and just as a worn-out cart is kept going with the help of repairs,* so it seems is the Tathāgata’sbody kept going with repairs. The only time that the Tathāgata can make his body comfortable is when he lives having attained a state of mental concentration without sensation, and specific feelings cease through not paying attention to any sensations.‘So,Ānanda, you should live with yourselves as your island of refuge and not someone else, with the Truth as your island of refuge*and not something else. And how does one live with oneself as one’s island of refuge, with the Truth as one’s island of refuge? A monk should live mindfully, with full awareness. This is my instruction to you. How does a monk live mindfully? In this case a monk lives watching the body as body; he is determined, fully aware, mindful, overcoming his longing for and discontent with the world. He lives watching feelings as feelings . . . mind as mind . . . qualities as quali-ties; he is determined, fully aware, mindful, overcoming his longing for and discontent with the world. It is in this way that a monk lives mindfully. This is how one lives with oneself as one’s island of ref-uge, with the Truth as one’s island of refuge.‘Whoever of my monks, either now or after I have gone, live with themselves as their island of refuge and not someone else, with the Truth as their island of refuge and not something else, they will be guides in the darkness,* whoever are desirous of training.’[Third section for recitation]Then, early in the morning, the Blessed One put on his outer robes and, taking his bowl, went into Vesālī for alms.

When the Blessed One reached the shrine of Cāpāla he sat down on the pre-pared seat, and having saluted him, the venerable Ānanda sat down to one side.Once the venerable Ānanda was seated, the Blessed One said to him: ‘How delightful is Vesālī!

It is now time for you to do as you think fit.’‘Yes, sir,’ replied the venerable Ānanda.And getting up from his seat, he saluted the Blessed One respect-fully, and keeping him to the right, he went and sat down at the root The Buddha’s Final Nibbana103104"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"From the Collection of Long Sayings60of a nearby tree.

So how else could it be? That something that is born, come into being, condi-tioned and of a nature to decay should not decay — this cannot happen. This is what the Tathāgata has renounced, cast off, let go, abandoned, relinquished: he has given up the force of life. The Tathāgata has said unequivocally that his final nibbana will not be long: three months from now he will attain final nibbana. That, in order to live, the Tathāgata should take back what he has said, this cannot happen.

After the meal he turned to look back at Vesālī as an elephant does,* and spoke to Ānanda.‘This is the last time the Tathāgata will see Vesālī. Come, we shall move on to the village of Bhanda.’‘Yes, sir,’ replied the venerable Ānanda to the Blessed One.Then the Blessed One made his way with a large community of monks to the village of Bhanda.While he was staying there he addressed the monks: ‘It is because of not understanding, not penetrating four qualities that you and I have run and wandered the round of rebirth in this way for such a long time. Which four? It is because of not understanding, not pene-trating noble conduct . . . noble concentration . . . noble wisdom . . . noble freedom that you and I have run and wandered the round of rebirth in this way for such a long time. But once noble conduct is understood and penetrated, once noble concentration is understood and penetrated, once noble wisdom is understood and penetrated, once noble freedom is understood and penetrated, then craving for existence is cut off, the conductor of existence is destroyed, and no longer is there rebirth.’This is what the Blessed One said. And when the Happy One had said this, the Teacher spoke again:‘Conduct, concentration, wisdom and freedom unsurpassed —These are the qualities that famed Gotama has understood.Knowing these directly, he has proclaimed the Truth to monks.The Teacher with vision has brought suffering to an end and is completely satisfied.’Now while he was staying at the village of Bhanda, the Blessed One talked to the monks a lot about the teaching in these terms: he explained how it is with good conduct, how it is with concentration, how it is with wisdom — how concentration that is invested with good conduct is of great fruit and of great benefit, how wisdom that is invested with concentration is of great fruit and of great benefit,and how the mind that is invested with wisdom is fully released from the taints, namely the taint of sense desire, the taint of being, the taint of view, the taint of ignorance.Now when the Blessed One had stayed at Bhanda as long as he wanted, he spoke to the venerable Ānanda: ‘Come, Ānanda, we shall move on to the village of Hatthi . . .

Listen. Pay careful attention to what I shall say.’‘Yes, sir,’ replied those monks to the Blessed One.This is what the Blessed One said: ‘Now if a monk should say that he has heard directly from the Blessed One, that he has learnt directly from him that such is the practice, such the discipline, such the Teacher’s instruction, then what this monk says should neither be accepted nor rejected.

Then the Blessed One made his way with a large community of monks to Pāvā, where he stayed in the mango grove of Cunda the smith. Now when Cunda heard people say that the Blessed One had reached Pāvāand was staying in his mango grove, he went to the Blessed One and on arrival saluted him respectfully before sitting down to one side. Once Cunda the smith was seated, the Blessed One instructed him with talk about the teaching, encouraging, enthusing, and inspiring him. Instructed, encouraged, enthused, and inspired by his talk, he said to the Blessed One: ‘May the Blessed One along with the com-munity of monks accept my invitation for tomorrow’s meal.’By his silence the Blessed One accepted. Understanding that he had accepted his invitation, Cunda got up from his seat, respect-fully saluted the Blessed One, and left, keeping him on his right. When the night was over, Cunda had fine foods of different sorts, including a large quantity of tender boar,* prepared in his own home. Then he had the Blessed One informed: ‘It is time, sir. The meal is ready.’Then early in the morning the Blessed One put on his outer robes and, taking his bowl, went together with the community of monks to Cunda the smith’s home and sat down on the prepared seat.When he had sat down he said to Cunda: ‘Cunda, serve me with the tender boar you have had prepared, serve the community of monks with the other sorts of food you have had prepared.’‘Yes, sir,’ replied Cunda the smith, and he served the Blessed One with the tender boar he had had prepared, and the community of monks with the other sorts of food he had had prepared.Then the Blessed One said to Cunda: ‘Whatever tender boar you have left, bury it in a hole. I do not see anyone in this world with its gods, its Māra and Brahmā, anyone of this generation with its ascet-ics and brahmans, its princes and peoples who could properly digest it once eaten, except the Tathāgata.’‘Yes, sir,’ replied Cunda the smith, and whatever tender boar was left he buried in a hole.127"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"73Then he went to the Blessed One and, having respectfully saluted him, sat down to one side.

After the Blessed One had eaten Cunda the smith’s meal he fell seriously ill, passing blood in his stools and suffering severe pains as though he were close to death. Without complaining, the Blessed One accepted the pains mindfully and with full awareness.Then the Blessed One spoke to the venerable Ānanda: ‘Come, Ānanda, we shall move on to Kusinārā.’‘Yes, sir,’ replied the venerable Ānanda to the Blessed One.What I have heard is that after eating Cunda the smith’s meal,The sage suffered a serious illness bringing him close to death.When he had eaten tender boarThe Teacher became seriously sick.The Blessed One, continually having to relieve himself, said:I am going to the town of Kusinārā.Then the Blessed One left the path and went over to the root of a tree.

And as he approached, the stream, which, cut through by wheels, had been flowing feebly, stirred up and muddy, appeared clear, bright, and free of mud.And the venerable Ānanda thought, ‘This is remarkable, this is extraordinary — the great accomplishment and great power of the Tathāgata! For this stream, which, cut through by wheels, was flowing feebly, stirred up and muddy, when I approach flows clear, bright, and free of mud.’Taking water in his bowl, the venerable Ānanda went to the Blessed One and said: ‘This is remarkable, this is extraordinary, sir — the great accomplishment and great power of the Tathāgata!The stream, which, cut through by wheels, had been flowing feebly, stirred up and muddy, when I approached just now appeared clear, bright, and free of mud.

So, expressing his deep faith in Ālāra the Kālāma, he went.’‘What do you think, Pukkusa? Which is harder to accomplish and master: that one should be conscious and awake and neither see nor hear the sound of five hundred carts passing right by, or that one should be conscious and awake and neither see anything nor hear a sound when the god rains down, the skies rumble, lightning flashes,and thunderbolts rend the air?’‘Whether it is five, six, seven, eight, nine, or ten hundred carts, whether a hundred or a thousand — what difference can it make? That one should be conscious and awake and neither see anything nor hear a sound when the god rains down, the skies rumble, light-ningflashes, and thunderbolts rend the air — certainly this is harder to accomplish and master.’‘Once I was staying at Ātumā in a threshing barn when the god rained down, the skies rumbled, lightning flashed and thunderbolts rent the air, and two ploughmen who were brothers and four oxen were killed. Now a great crowd of people came out from Ātumā and went to where the ploughmen and oxen had been killed. By that time I had come out of the threshing barn and was walking up and down in the open air by the entrance. A man from the crowd came up to me and, having approached, he saluted me respectfully and stood to one side. As he stood there I asked him why that great crowd had gathered: “Sir, just now,” he said, “the god rained down, the skies rumbled, lightning flashed and thunderbolts rent the air, and two ploughmen who were brothers and four oxen were killed. So this great crowd has gathered. But, sir, where were you?” “I was right here, friend.” “But didn’t you see anything?” “I did not.” “Then did you hear the noise, sir?” “I did not.” “Then were you asleep, sir?” “I was not asleep.” “Then were you conscious, sir?” “I was, friend.” “So, while conscious and awake you neither saw anything nor heard a sound when the god rained down, the skies rumbled, lightningflashed, and thunderbolts rent the air?” “That is so, friend.” And then, Pukkusa, that man thought how remarkable, how extraordinary that those who have gone forth live life in such peace that, while conscious and awake, they will neither see anything nor hear a sound when the god rains down, the skies rumble, lightning The Buddha’s Final Nibbana131132"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"From the Collection of Long Sayings76flashes, and thunderbolts rend the air.

Excellent, sir! Excellent! As if someone were to set upright what had been knocked down, or reveal what had been hid-den, or point out the way to someone who was lost, or hold a lamp up in the dark so that those with eyes could see — just so the Blessed One has made the Truth clear in various ways. Sir, I go to the Blessed One for refuge, and to the Teaching and the Community of monks. Let the Blessed One accept me as a lay follower who has taken refuge from this day for as long as I live.’Then Pukkusa spoke to one of his men: ‘Please, bring me a pair of garments of finished cloth, the colour of gold.’‘Yes, sir,’ he replied and brought a pair of garments of finishedcloth, the colour of gold.And Pukkusa offered that pair of garments to the Blessed One, saying: ‘Sir, out of sympathy may the Blessed One accept this pair of garments of finished cloth, the colour of gold.’‘Then clothe me in one, Pukkusa, and Ānanda in the other.’‘Yes, sir,’ he replied and clothed the Blessed One in one and Ānanda in the other.Then the Blessed One instructed Pukkusa with talk about the teaching, encouraging, enthusing, and inspiring him. Instructed, encouraged, enthused, and inspired by his talk, Pukkusa got up from his seat and respectfully saluted the Blessed One and, keeping him on his right, went away. Not long after he had left, the venerable Ānanda offered both the garments to the Blessed One to cover his body,* but once on his body they faded and seemed to lose their lustre.Then the venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One: ‘This is remarkable, sir, this is extraordinary — the colour of the Tathāgata’sskin is so pure and clear! I have offered the Blessed One both gar-ments of finished cloth the colour of gold to cover his body, but once on his body they fade and seem to lose their lustre.’‘That is so, Ānanda. There are two occasions when the colour of the Tathāgata’s skin is very pure and clear. Which are they? The night the Tathāgata awakens to the highest perfect awakening, and 133134"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"77the night he attains final nibbana by the element of nibbana that is without any remnant of attachment. These are the two occasions when the colour of the Tathāgata’s skin is very pure and clear. So tonight, in the last watch, at Upavattana, the sāl grove of the Mallas at Kusinārā, between two sāl trees,* the final nibbana of the Tathāgata will happen. Come, Ānanda, we shall move on to the River Kakutthā.’With two pieces of finished cloth, the colour of gold, Pukkusa came:Clothed in them the Teacher’s complexion shone like gold.Then the Blessed One went with a large community of monks to the River Kakutthā, where he went down into the water to bathe and drink. On coming back out, he went to the mango grove and spoke to the venerable Cundaka: ‘Could you fold my outermost robe in four for me, Cundaka? I am tired and must lie down.’‘Yes, sir,’ replied the venerable Cundaka and he folded the outer-most robe in four. Then the Blessed One lay down on his right side as a lion does, covering one foot with the other, mindful and fully aware, bringing to mind when he would get up, while the venerable Cundaka sat down there in front of him.The Buddha went to the River Kakutthā,Bright with water clear and good;His body exhausted, the Teacher plunged in —The Tathāgata, without equal in the world.And when the Teacher had bathed and drunk, he emerged,Revered among the company of monks.The Blessed Teacher who sets the Truth in motion here,The great sage, went to the mango grove.He addressed the monk called Cundaka:‘Spread the fourfold robe for me: I must lie down.’Directed* by the one realized in himself, CundaQuickly spread the fourfold robe.His body exhausted, the Teacher lay downAnd Cunda sat down there in front of him.Then the Blessed One said to the venerable Ānanda: ‘It is possible that someone might make Cunda regretful by suggesting to him that for the Tathāgata to have reached final peace after eating a last meal The Buddha’s Final Nibbana135"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"From the Collection of Long Sayings78offered by him is something that counts against him, something dis-advantageous to him. Any such regret of Cunda’s should be dispelled by telling him: “For the Tathāgata to have reached final peace after eating a last meal offered by you, Cunda, is something that counts for you, something very advantageous to you. I have heard directly from the Blessed One, I have learnt directly from him that there are two meals whose offering is exactly the same in result and effect but much greater in result and benefit than the offering of other meals: the offering of the meal after eating which the Tathāgata awakens to the unsurpassed complete awakening, and the offering of the meal after eating which the Tathāgata attains final nibbana with the element of nibbana that is without any remnant of attachment. These are the two meals whose offering is exactly the same in result and effect but much greater in result and benefit than the offering of other meals. The good Cunda has done a deed to his credit that will conduce to long life, to good looks, to fame, to happiness, to heaven, and to authority.” This is how any regret of Cunda the smith’s should be dispelled.’And the Blessed One, understanding the significance of this, immediately breathed a sigh:‘When one gives, merit increases; when one is in control of oneself, hostility is not stored up;The skilful man gives up what is bad; with the destruction of greed, hatred and delusion he is at peace.’[Fifth section for recitation: Hiraññavatī]Then the Blessed One said to the venerable Ānanda, ‘Come, Ānanda,we shall move on to the further bank of the River Hiraññavatī, to Upavattana, the sāl grove of the Mallas at Kusinārā.’‘Yes, sir,’ replied the venerable Ānanda to the Blessed One.Then the Blessed One made his way with a large community of monks across the Hiraññavatī to the sāl grove at Kusinārā in the land of the Mallas.There he spoke to the venerable Ānanda: ‘Ānanda, could you prepare a bed for me between two sāl trees with the head to the north?

Yet this does not amount to the showing of respect, honour, reverence, worship, or recognition to the Tathāgata: the one who respects, honours, reveres, and worships the Tathāgata with the ultimate worship is the monk or nun, the layman or laywoman, who lives practising the teaching and its subtleties, conducting him or herself properly, living in accordance with the Truth.

Long ago there was a king called Mahāsudassana — a wheel-turning king, a righteous king of Truth, a sovereign of the four quarters who maintained the stability of the country. This town of Kusinārā was the royal city of King Mahāsudassana and was called Kusāvatī. Twelve leagues in length on the east and west sides and seven leagues across on the north and south sides, the royal city of Kusāvatī was successful and prosperous with many inhabitants, full of people and well provided with food — just as Ālakamandā, the royal city of the gods, is successful and prosperous with many inhab-itants, full of divine beings, and well provided with food. Day and night the royal city of Kusāvatī was filled with the ten sounds: the sound of elephants, horses, carriages, kettle drums, tabors, vīnās,singing, cymbals, gongs, and lastly the sound of the cries of, “Eat, drink, and be merry!”‘Ānanda, go into Kusinārā and tell the Mallas there that tonight, in the last watch, the final nibbana of the Tathāgata will happen. Tell them that they must come and not later regret that, although the Tathāgata attained final nibbana in the vicinity of their village, they didn’t get to see him in his last hours.’‘Yes, sir,’ replied the venerable Ānanda to the Blessed One.Then he put on his outer robes and, taking his bowl, went into Kusinārā with a companion. At that time the Mallas of Kusinārā had sat down together in the meeting hall to deal with some matter. So the venerable Ānanda went to the meeting hall and told them: ‘Tonight, in the last watch, the final nibbana of the Tathāgata will happen. Vāset.t.has, you must come. Do not later regret that, although the Tathāgata attained final nibbana in the vicinity of your village, you didn’t get to see him in his last hours.’When they had heard this news from the venerable Ānanda, the Mallas and their sons and daughters and their wives felt wretched and unhappy, and were overcome with sadness. With dishevelled hair some spread their arms wide and called out; they fell to the ground, broken, and rolled back and forth: ‘All too soon will the Blessed One attain final nibbana! All too soon will the Happy One attain final nibbana! All too soon will the eye of the world disappear!’147148"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"85Then the Mallas and their sons and daughters and their wives, feeling wretched and unhappy, and overcome with sadness, went to Upavattana, the sāl grove of the Mallas, and approached the vener-ableĀnanda.Ānanda thought: ‘If I present the Mallas one by one to pay their respects to the Blessed One, it will be getting light and still they will not have finished paying their respects. I had better divide them into various family groups and then present them to the Blessed One to pay their respects, announcing that a Malla of such and such a name along with his sons, his wives, his retinue, and his friends bows down at the feet of the Blessed One.’So the venerable Ānanda divided the Mallas of Kusinārā into various family groups and presented them to the Blessed One to pay their respects, announcing that a Malla of such and such a name along with his sons, his wives, his retinue, and his friends bowed down at the feet of the Blessed One. In this way he presented the Mallas to the Blessed One to pay their respects in the first watch.Now at that time a wanderer called Subhadda was living in Kusinārā,and when he heard people say that the final nibbana of the ascetic Gotama would take place in the last watch of that very night he thought: ‘I have heard senior and elder wanderers, the teachers of teach-ers, say that only once in a while does a Tathāgata who is a perfectly awakened arahat appear in the world, and tonight in the last watch the final nibbana of the ascetic Gotama will take place. A particular doubt has arisen in me, but I feel confident the ascetic Gotama can teach me the Truth in a way that will allow me to get rid of this doubt.’So the wanderer Subhadda went to Upavattana, the sāl grove of the Mallas, and approached the venerable Ānanda and said to him: ‘I have heard . . . wanderers . . . say that only once in a while does a Tathāgata who is a perfectly awakened arahat appear in the world . . .

Do not refuse Subhadda. He should be allowed to see the Tathāgata. Everything Subhadda will ask me, he will ask only out of a concern to under-stand, not to bother me. And once I am asked, whatever I shall explain to him he will quickly understand.’Then the venerable Ānanda said to the wanderer Subhadda: ‘Go, Subhadda. The Blessed One gives you his permission.’Then the wanderer Subhadda approached the Blessed One, and having approached, he saluted the Blessed One respectfully, exchanging pleasing and polite words with him, before sitting down to one side.Once seated, he said to the Blessed One: ‘There are ascetics and brahmans who have communities and followings and are the teachers of those followings; who are well known and of some repute, who have found a way across and are thought holy by many — for example, Pūrana Kassapa, Makkhali Gosāla, Ajita of the Blanket of Hair, Pakudha Kaccāyana, Sañjaya Bela.t.thiputta, and Nigan.thaNātaputta. Now have all of these achieved direct knowledge as they claim, or has none achieved it, or have some achieved it and some not?’‘Enough, Subhadda. This question of whether all of these have achieved direct knowledge as they claim, or whether none has or some have and some have not can wait. I shall teach you the Truth, Subhadda. Listen and pay careful attention to what I shall say.’‘Yes, sir,’ replied the wanderer Subhadda to the Blessed One.The Blessed One said: ‘In a system of teaching and discipline where the noble eightfold path is not found, the ascetic is also not found, and neither are the second, third, and fourth ascetics.* But in a system of teaching and discipline where the noble eightfold path is found, the ascetic is also found, and so too are the second, third, and fourth ascetics. Now in this system of teaching and discipline the noble eightfold path is found, and certainly the ascetic is found here, and the second, third, and fourth ascetics. Other contrary systems are empty of ascetics, but if the monks here live properly, the world should not be empty of arahats.151"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"87I was twenty-nine years of age, Subhadda, When I went forth in search of what is good.Now it is more than fifty years Since I went forth, Subhadda,To abide in the realm of the way of Truth, Outside which there is no ascetic —nor the second, nor the third, nor the fourth ascetic. Other contrary systems are empty of ascetics, but if the monks here live properly, the world should not be empty of arahats.’At this Subhadda the wanderer said to the Blessed One: ‘Excellent, sir! Excellent! As if someone were to set upright what had been knocked down, or reveal what had been hidden, or point out the way to someone who was lost, or hold a lamp up in the dark so that those with eyes could see — just so the Blessed One has made the Truth clear in various ways. Sir, I go to the Blessed One for refuge, and to the Teaching and the Community of monks. I should like to receive the going-forth ordination in the presence of the Blessed One. I should like to receive higher ordination.’*‘Subhadda, someone who was previously a follower of another religious school and who wants to receive the going-forth and higher ordinations in this system of teaching and discipline should wait four months.

Straight after he had been ordained, the venerable Subhadda withdrew alone, and living attentive, determined, and resolute, he soon lived here and now hav-ing attained the ultimate goal of the spiritual life, experiencing it for himself through direct knowledge — the goal for the sake of which sons of families properly go forth from the household life into home-lessness. He understood: ‘Birth is destroyed, the spiritual life lived, done is what was to be done — there is nothing further required to this end!’So the venerable Subhadda became one of the arahats —He was the last of the direct disciples of the Blessed One.[Sixth section for recitation]Then the Blessed One spoke to the venerable Ānanda: ‘Perhaps you will think that there is no longer a teacher to give instruction, that you have no teacher.

After I have gone you should not address each other as “friend” as you do now. A more senior monk should address a junior monk by his name or fam-ily or as “friend”; a more junior monk should address a senior monk as “sir” or as “the venerable one”. After I have gone the community may, if it wishes, abolish the minor rules of training. After I have gone, the monk Channa* should be subject to the full punishment.’‘But what is the full punishment?’‘The monk Channa can say what he likes, Ānanda, but monks are strictly not to speak to him, nor give him advice or instruction.’Then the Blessed One addressed the monks: ‘Perhaps some monk has doubt or is confused about the Buddha, the teaching, the com-munity, the path, or the practice.

Then, taking the incense, garlands, and musical instru-ments, and five hundred sets of garments, they went to the body of the Blessed One in Upavattana, the sāl grove of the Mallas. There they paid their respects to the body, honouring, revering, and wor-shipping it with dances, songs, music, garlands, and incense, making awnings and preparing pavilions.

We were oppressed by his “this you are allowed, this you are not allowed,” but now we can do what we like and what we don’t like we don’t have to do.’The venerable Mahākassapa spoke to the monks: ‘Enough, sirs! Do not grieve and lament. Did not the Blessed One warn you about this before: we must lose and be deprived of and separated from everything pleasant and dear? So how else could it be? That some-thing that is born, come into being, conditioned, and of a nature to decay should not decay — this cannot happen.’At that time four eminent Mallas who had bathed their heads and put on new clothes, tried to light the Blessed One’s funeral pyre, but were unable to do so. Then the Mallas of Kusinārā asked the vener-able Anuruddha what was the cause, what was the reason why these four eminent Mallas, who had bathed their heads and put on new clothes, were unable to light the Blessed One’s funeral pyre when they tried to do so.‘You have one plan, but the gods have another.’‘Sir, what plan do the gods have?’‘Vāse.t.thas, the gods’ plan is that the Blessed One’s funeral pyre should not catch fire until the venerable Mahākassapa, who is travel-ling on the main road from Pāvā to Kusinārā with a large community offive hundred monks, has bowed down touching the feet of the Blessed One with his head.’‘Sir, let things happen according to the gods’ plan.’163"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"95Then the venerable Mahākassapa arrived at Maku.tabandhana, the shrine of the Mallas at Kusinārā, and approached the Blessed One’s funeral pyre. Then he arranged his outer robe on one shoulder, bowed with cupped hands, and, keeping it to his right, walked three times round the funeral pyre. Then he uncovered the feet and bowed down, touching the feet of the Blessed One with his head. Those fivehundred monks also arranged their outer robes on one shoulder, bowed with cupped hands, and, keeping it to their right, walked three times round the funeral pyre. Then they too bowed down, touching the feet of the Blessed One with their heads. And when the venerable Mahākassapa and the five hundred monks had finishedpaying their respects the Blessed One’s funeral pyre caught fire by itself.Now when the Blessed One’s body was cremated, no cinders or ash at all were formed from what had been the layers of skin, flesh,sinews, and oil of the joints, only the bones remained as relics. Just as when ghee or oil burns, no cinders or ash are formed at all, in exactly the same way when the Blessed One’s body was cremated, no cinders or ash were formed at all . . . only the bones remained as relics. And of those five hundred double layers of cloth, two — the innermost and the outermost — were in fact not burnt up.* And when the Blessed One’s body had been burnt up, a shower of water came from the sky and extinguished the funeral pyre, and water also burst forth from the sāl trees to extinguish the pyre, while the Mallas too extinguished it with perfumed water. Then the Mallas made a fence of spears and set up a wall of bows, and for seven days they paid their respects to the relics in their meeting hall, honouring,* rever-ing, and worshipping them with dances, songs, music, garlands, and incense.Now when the King Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the princess of Videha, heard people say that the Blessed One had attained final nib-bana at Kusinārā, he sent a messenger to the Mallas at Kusinārā,saying: ‘The Blessed One was of the Ruler class, I too am a Ruler. I deserve a share of the relics of the Blessed One.

In Indian mythology a wheel-turning king is a type of universal and ideal king who rules in perfect justice — an equivalent in British mythology might be King Arthur. Buddhist tradition relates how, after Gotama’s birth, brahman seers identify his body as possessing thirty-two marks of a ‘great man’ (mahāpurisa/mahāpurus.a), indicating that his fate will either be that of a buddha or a wheel-turning king. The Mahāsudassana-sutta relates how in fact in previous lives the Buddha had been a wheel-turning king. The sutta is thus a type of jātaka, a story of a previous life of the being who eventually became the Buddha.The type of mythic narrative presented in the Mahāsudassana-suttahas sometimes been read as providing the model and inspiration for the ideal Buddhist ruler, but it can also be seen as a complete mythic narrative of the Buddhist path which itself becomes a kind of meditation for the listener.At the beginning of the sutta Mahāsudassana is established within his city within his kingdom where everything is well. The first half of the sutta emphasizes Mahāsudassana’s perfect conduct (sīla) and the way in which he provides for his citizens — his generosity (dāna). He then constructs a ‘Palace of Truth’ (dhamma-pāsāda) and withdraws into it. Within the pal-ace Mahāsudassana enters its inner room, renouncing all thoughts of sensual desire, hostility, and malice. He then achieves the four ‘medita-tions’ (jhāna). On entering the palace, Mahāsudassana left behind all his possessions (fourteen lots of 84,000 possessions are enumerated), but these come to remind him of their existence. Dressed in all their finery, his 84,000 wives stream into the Palace of Truth, knocking on the door of the inner room. The chief queen then urges Mahāsudassana to arouse desire for all his possessions and for life, but he reprimands her: while they may have come to him as the result of his past good actions, continued"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"99attachment to them is an obstacle to his progress along the spiritual path. The long list of Mahāsudassana’s various possessions is repeated in full a total of six times in the second half of the sutta, providing the listener with a meditation on the beauties and splendours of the world and, crucially, their impermanence.The story of Mahāsudassana’s life and death forms a literary counter-point to the story of the Buddha’s death. Mahāsudassana’s withdrawal from the outer city into its inner sanctum, the Palace of Truth, is also something of a mythic equivalent of a Buddhist monk’s withdrawal from the household life; the king’s entering the Palace of Truth effectivelymarks the beginning of a life as a celibate ascetic removed from his posses-sions and his wives.This is a very straightforward and clear narrative of the Buddhist path: generosity (dāna) and good conduct (sīla) are followed by meditation (bhāvanā), consisting of the practice of calm (samatha), in the form of happy and peaceful absorptions (jhāna), and then of insight (vipassanā) into imper-manence, achieved by contemplating the death of the king and the disap-pearance of his fabulous city. The listener (and reader) is also led along that path by the narrative. The slow, unhurried description of the city with its groves of jewelled trees with tinkling bells and its lotus ponds, of the palace with its jewelled rooms and couches, evokes vivid images which bring a sense of well-being and calm. The story of the king’s conversation with his queen and of his death is a story of letting go, of the passing of the things to which we are deeply attached — the passing even of the Buddha himself.

Gethin, ‘Mythology as Meditation: From the Mahāsudassana Sutta to the Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra’, Journal of the Pali Text Society,28 (2006),63–110.[First section for recitation]This is what I have heard. Once the Blessed One was staying at Kusinārā, in the Upavattana sāl grove of the Mallas, between the two sāl trees at the time of his final nibbana. Now the venerable Ānandaapproached the Blessed One, and having approached he saluted the Blessed One respectfully and sat down to one side.Once seated, he said to the Blessed One: ‘Sir, the Blessed One should not enter final nibbana in this mud-wall town, this remote, provincial town. Sir, there are other important cities such as Campā,Rājagaha, Sāvatthī, Sāketa, Kosambī, and Benares — the Blessed One should enter final nibbana in one of these. In these cities there King Mahāsudassana169"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"From the Collection of Long Sayings100are many wealthy nobles, brahmans, and householders who have great faith in the Tathāgata and who will pay due honour to the remains of the Tathāgata.’‘Ānanda, do not say that this is a mud-wall town, a remote, pro-vincial town. Long ago there was a king called Mahāsudassana. He was an anointed prince, a sovereign of the four quarters who main-tained the stability of the country. This town of Kusinārā was the royal city of King Mahāsudassana and was called Kusāvatī. Twelve leagues in length on the east and west sides and seven leagues across on the north and south sides, the royal city of Kusāvatī was success-ful and prosperous, with many inhabitants, full of people and well provided with food — just as Ālakamandā, the royal city of the gods, is successful and prosperous, with many inhabitants, full of divine beings and well provided with food. Day and night the royal city of Kusāvatī was filled with the ten sounds: the sound of elephants, horses, carriages, kettle drums, tabors, vīnās, singing, cymbals, gongs, and lastly the sound of the cries of “Eat, drink, and be merry!”‘The city was encircled by seven walls: one of gold, one of silver, one of beryl, one of crystal, one of ruby, one of emerald, and one of all kinds of gems. And it had gates of four colours: one of gold, one of silver, one of beryl, one of crystal. At each gate seven pillars were set into the ground, three times the height of a man in circum-ference and in height four times that of a man.* One pillar was of gold, one of silver, one of beryl, one of crystal, one of ruby, one of emerald, one of all kinds of gems. The royal city of Kusāvatī was encircled by seven rows of palm trees: one of gold, one of silver, one of beryl, one of crystal, one of ruby, one of emerald, one of all kinds of gems. The trunks of the gold palm trees were gold, the leaves and fruits silver; the trunks of the silver palm trees were silver, the leaves and fruits gold; the trunks of the beryl palm trees were beryl, the leaves and fruits crystal; the trunks of the crystal palm trees were crystal, the leaves and fruits beryl; the trunks of the ruby palm trees were ruby, the leaves and fruits emerald; the trunks of the emerald palm trees were emerald, the leaves and fruits ruby; the trunks of the palm trees of all kinds of gems were of all kinds of gems, the leaves and fruits of all kinds of gems. And the sound of those trees when stirred by the wind was lovely, delightful, charming, enchanting —like the sound of the five kinds of musical instrument when well 170171"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"101played by musicians skilled in the arts of musicianship. And at that time those in the royal city of Kusāvatī who were revellers, fond of drink, keen drinkers, danced round* to the sound of the trees stirred by the wind.‘Now,Ānanda, King Mahāsudassana possessed seven treasures and was especially fortunate in four ways. What were the seven treas-ures? On the full-moon observance day on the fifteenth of the month, when King Mahāsudassana had bathed his head and gone up onto the roof of his fine palace to keep the observance day, there appeared to him the heavenly wheel-treasure, complete with a thousand spokes, rim and hub. When he saw this the king thought: “I have heard that when a king, an anointed prince, who has bathed his head goes up onto the roof of his fine palace on the observance day on the fifteenth to keep the observance day and there appears to him the heavenly wheel-treasure complete with a thousand spokes, and fur-nished with a rim and hub, then that king is a wheel-turning king. Would that I were indeed a wheel-turning king!” Then, Ānanda,King Mahāsudassana got up from his seat and, having arranged his robe over one shoulder, took a golden vessel in his left hand and sprinkled the wheel treasure with his right: “May the wheel-treasure roll on! May the wheel-treasure be victorious!”‘Then the wheel-treasure rolled forward to the east, with King Mahāsudassana and his fourfold army following behind. And in whatever country the wheel-treasure came to rest, there King Mahāsudassana took up residence with his fourfold army. And all the rival princes in the east approached King Mahāsudassana and said: “Come, your majesty, you are welcome. It is yours, your majesty. Instruct us!”‘King Mahāsudassana said: “Do not kill living beings. Do not take what is not given. Do not indulge in sexual misconduct. Do not tell lies. Do not drink intoxicants. Govern as you have governed.”* And so the rival princes in the east became obedient to King Mahāsudassana.‘Then,Ānanda, the wheel-treasure plunged down into the eastern ocean, rose out again, and rolled on to the south . . . Then it plunged down into the southern ocean, rose out again and rolled on to the west . . . Then it plunged down into the western ocean, rose out again, and rolled on to the north, with King Mahāsudassana and his fourfold army following behind. And in whatever country the King Mahāsudassana172173"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"From the Collection of Long Sayings102wheel-treasure came to rest, there King Mahāsudassana took up residence with his fourfold army. And all the rival princes in the north approached King Mahāsudassana and said: “Come, your majesty, you are welcome. It is yours, your majesty. Instruct us!”‘King Mahāsudassana said: “Do not kill living beings. Do not take what is not given. Do not indulge in sexual misconduct. Do not tell lies. Do not drink intoxicants. Govern as you have governed.” And so the rival princes in the north became obedient to King Mahāsudassana.‘And when, Ānanda, the wheel-treasure had conquered the entire earth to the edge of the ocean, it returned to the royal city of Kusāvatī and stopped as if fixed to an axle in front of the court at the entrance to King Mahāsudassana’s inner apartments, which it adorned. Such was the wheel-treasure that appeared to King Mahāsudassana.‘Next,Ānanda, there appeared to King Mahāsudassana the elephant-treasure, all white, firm in seven ways, with magic powers, flyingthrough the air, a king of elephants, called Changes of the Moon.*And when the king saw him his heart was inspired with confidence:“What an excellent mount! If only he would submit to control!” And then, just like a fine, thoroughbred elephant that has been well trained for a long time, that elephant-treasure submitted to control. And long ago, in order to test the elephant-treasure, King Mahāsudassana mounted him in the early dawn and travelled across the land to the edge of the ocean, returning to the royal city of Kusāvatī to take his breakfast. Such was the elephant-treasure that appeared to King Mahāsudassana.‘Next,Ānanda, there appeared to King Mahāsudassana the horse-treasure, all white, with a black head and fine mane,* with magic powers,flying through the air, a king of horses, called Thunder- cloud.* And when the king saw him his heart was inspired with confidence: “What an excellent mount! If only he would submit to control!” And then, just like a fine, thoroughbred horse that has been well trained for a long time, that horse-treasure submitted to control. And long ago, in order to test the horse-treasure, King Mahāsudassanamounted him in the early dawn and travelled across the land to the edge of the ocean, returning to the royal city of Kusāvatī to take his breakfast. Such was the horse-treasure that appeared to King Mahāsudassana.174175"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"103‘Next,Ānanda, there appeared to King Mahāsudassana the gem-treasure. This was a beautiful beryl, pure, expertly cut with eight facets, bright, clear, without flaw, perfect in every respect. Its bril-liance spread out for a league round about. And long ago, in order to test the gem-treasure, King Mahāsudassana summoned his fourfold army and, fixing the gem on the top of his standard, went out in the dark of the night. And because of the gem’s brilliance the villagers from round about thought it was day and started their work. Such was the gem-treasure that appeared to King Mahāsudassana.‘Next,Ānanda, there appeared to King Mahāsudassana the woman-treasure. Beautiful, of wonderful looks, and graceful, she had the most lovely appearance. She was neither too tall, nor too short; neither too fat, nor too thin; neither too dark, nor too fair. She had a beauty which was more than human, like that of a goddess. And the touch of the woman-treasure’s body was just like cotton or cotton wool; in the cool season her limbs felt warm, in the hot season cool; from her body wafted the scent of sandalwood, and from her mouth the scent of lotus. She got up before the king and went to bed after him; she waited for his instructions, was pleasing in her conduct, and gracious in her speech. And the woman-treasure was not even unfaithful to the king in thought, let alone in deed. Such was the woman-treasure that appeared to King Mahāsudassana.‘Next,Ānanda, there appeared to King Mahāsudassana the steward-treasure. As a result of his past actions he possessed a godlike vision with which he could see hidden treasure, whether belonging to people or not. And he approached King Mahāsudassanaand said to him: “You need have no worries, lord. I will manage your wealth properly.” And long ago, in order to test the steward-treasure, King Mahāsudassana boarded a boat and went out into the current in the middle of the River Ganges. And then he said to the steward-treasure: “Steward, I need gold coins.”‘ “Then let the boat go to one bank.”‘ “But, steward, it is right here that I need gold coins.”‘Then the steward reached down into the water with both hands and drew out a pot full of gold coins.‘ “Is that enough, your majesty? Have I done what you wished?” he asked.‘ “That is enough, steward. You have done what I wished. You have served me as I wished,” said the king.King Mahāsudassana176177"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"From the Collection of Long Sayings104‘Such was the steward-treasure that appeared to King Mahāsudassana.‘NextĀnanda, there appeared to King Mahāsudassana the adviser-treasure, a learned, clever, and wise man who knew when to advise the king to advance, when to advise him to retreat, and when to advise him to stand still. And he approached King Mahāsudassana and said to him: “You need have no worries, lord. I will advise you.” Such was the adviser-treasure that appeared to King Mahāsudassana.‘These, then, were the seven treasures possessed by King Mahāsudassana. Furthermore, Ānanda, King Mahāsudassana was blessed with good fortune in four ways. Handsome, of wonderful looks, and graceful, the king had the most lovely appearance, sur-passing that of other men. This was the first way in which he was blessed with good fortune. Again, he was long-lived, living longer than other men. This was the second way in which he was blessed with good fortune. Again, he was of good health, suffering little pain, with good, balanced digestion, without excessive heat or cold, sur-passing that of other men. This was the third way in which he was blessed with good fortune. Again, he was loved and cherished by brahmans and householders, just as a father is loved and cherished by his sons. And brahmans and householders were loved and cher-ished by the king, just as sons are loved and cherished by a father. Long ago, Ānanda, King Mahāsudassana went out into the park with his fourfold army, and the brahmans and householders came up to him and said: “Go slowly, lord, so that we can look at you for longer.” And the king too said to his charioteer: “Drive slowly, so that I can look at the brahmans and householders for longer.” This was the fourth way in which King Mahāsudassana was blessed with good fortune. So King Mahāsudassana was blessed with good for-tune in these four ways.‘Now King Mahāsudassana thought: “Why don’t I have lotus ponds built in the spaces between these palms* at every hundred-bows’ length?” So he had lotus ponds built in the spaces between those palms at every hundred-bows’ length. The lotus ponds were lined with tiles of four colours: some were of gold, some were of sil-ver, some were of beryl, and some were of crystal. And each lotus pond had four flights of steps: one of gold, one of silver, one of beryl, and one of crystal. The gold flights of steps had gold balustrades, 178179"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"105with silver crossbars and handrail; the silver flights of steps had silver balustrades, with gold crossbars and handrail; the beryl flights of steps had beryl balustrades, with crystal crossbars and handrail; the crystalflights of steps had crystal balustrades, with beryl crossbars and handrail. The lotus ponds were surrounded by two railings: one of gold, and one of silver. The gold railing had gold posts, with silver crossbars and handrail; the silver railing had silver posts, with gold crossbars and handrail.‘Now King Mahāsudassana thought: “Why don’t I have differentkinds of water lilies and lotuses for all seasons planted in these lotus ponds — blue lotuses, red lotuses, and white lotuses*— so that everyone can have garlands?”* So the king had lotuses for all seasons planted in those lotus ponds — blue lotuses, red lotuses, and white lotuses — so that everyone could have garlands.‘Then the king thought: “Why don’t I have bath attendants placed at the edge of these lotus ponds who can bathe people that come?” So the king had bath attendants placed at the edge of the lotus ponds who could bathe people that came.‘Then the king thought: “Why don’t I arrange for the giving out of different things at the edge of these lotus ponds: food for those who need food, drink for those who need drink, clothing for those who need clothing, transport for those who need transport, beds for those who need beds, wives for those who need wives, money and gold for those who need money and gold?” So the king arranged for the giving out of different things at the edge of the lotus ponds: food for those who needed food, drink for those who needed drink, cloth-ing for those who needed clothing, transport for those who needed transport, beds for those who needed beds, wives for those who needed wives, money and gold for those who needed money and gold.‘Then the brahmans and householders came to the king with a great sum of money, and said: “Lord, we have brought this great sum of money for your use. Please accept it.”‘ “Good sirs, enough! I have a great deal of money collected through proper taxation. You should keep this, and take away some more.”‘When they were refused by the king they withdrew to one side and considered together: “It is not right for us take this money back to our homes again. Why don’t we have a house built for King Mahāsudassana?”King Mahāsudassana180"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"From the Collection of Long Sayings106‘So they approached the king and said: “Lord, we will have a house built for you.”‘And by his silence the king agreed. ‘Then, Ānanda, Sakka, lord of the gods, knowing in his mind King Mahāsudassana’s thoughts, spoke to the god Vissakamma:* “Come now, friend Vissakamma. You must build a house for King Mahāsudassana, a palace called ‘Truth’.”‘ “Such good fortune for you!” replied Vissakamma to Sakka, and then, just as a strong man might straighten his bent arm or bend his straightened arm, he disappeared from the realm of the Thirty-Three Gods and appeared before King Mahāsudassana.‘Then he said to the king: “Lord, I shall build a house for you, a palace called ‘Truth’.”‘And by his silence the king agreed. So the god Vissakamma built a house for King Mahāsudassana, a palace called “Truth”. The Palace of Truth was one league in length on the east and west sides, and half a league across on the north and south sides. The ground floor of the palace was faced to a height three times that of a man with tiles of four colours: some were of gold, some were of silver, some were of beryl, and some were of crystal. It had 84,000 columns of four colours: some of gold, some of silver, some of beryl, and some of crystal. It was covered with boards* of four colours: some of gold, some of silver, some of beryl, and some of crystal. It had twenty-four staircases of four colours: some of gold, some of silver, some of beryl, and some of crystal. The gold staircases had gold balustrades, with silver crossbars and handrail; the silver staircases had silver balustrades, with gold crossbars and handrail; the beryl staircases had beryl balustrades, with crystal crossbars and handrail; the crystal staircases had crystal balustrades, with beryl crossbars and handrail.‘There were 84,000 chambers of four colours in the palace: some were of gold, some were of silver, some were of beryl, and some were of crystal. The golden chambers were furnished with silver couches, the silver chambers with golden couches; the beryl chambers were furnished with ivory couches, the crystal chambers with ebony couches. And at the doors to the golden chambers there stood silver palms with trunks of silver and leaves and fruits of gold; at the doors to the silver chambers there stood golden palms with trunks of gold and leaves and fruits of silver; at the doors to the beryl chambers 181182"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"107there stood crystal palms with trunks of crystal and leaves and fruits of beryl; at the doors to the crystal chambers there stood beryl palms with trunks of beryl and leaves and fruits of crystal.‘Then King Mahāsudassana thought: “Why don’t I have a grove of completely golden palm trees made at the door to the Room of the Great Array so that I can sit and spend the day there?” So the king had a grove of completely golden palm trees made at the door to the Room of the Great Array so he could sit and spend the day there.‘The Palace of Truth was encircled by two railings: one of gold, and one of silver.

It had twenty-four flights of steps: some of gold, some of silver, some of beryl, and some of crystal. The gold flights of steps had gold balustrades, with silver crossbars and handrail; the silver flights of steps had silver balus-trades, with gold crossbars and handrail; the beryl flights of steps had beryl balustrades, with crystal crossbars and handrail; the crystal flights of steps had crystal balustrades, with beryl crossbars and handrail. The Lotus Pond of Truth was encircled by two railings: one of gold, and one of silver. The gold railing had gold posts, with King Mahāsudassana183184"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"From the Collection of Long Sayings108silver crossbars and handrail; the silver railing had silver posts, with gold crossbars and handrail.‘The Lotus Pond of Truth was encircled by seven rows of palm trees: one of gold, one of silver, one of beryl, one of crystal, one of ruby, one of emerald, one of all kinds of gems. The trunks of the gold palm trees were gold, the leaves and fruits silver; the trunks of the silver palm trees were silver, the leaves and fruits gold; the trunks of the beryl palm trees were beryl, the leaves and fruits crystal; the trunks of the crystal palm trees were crystal, the leaves and fruits beryl; the trunks of the ruby palm trees were ruby, the leaves and fruits emerald; the trunks of the emerald palm trees were emerald, the leaves and fruits ruby; the trunks of the palm trees of all kinds of gems were of all kinds of gems, the leaves and fruits of all kinds of gems. And the sound of those trees when stirred by the wind was lovely, delightful, charming, enchanting — like the sound of the fivekinds of musical instrument when well played by musicians skilled in the arts of musicianship. And at that time those in the royal city of Kusāvatī who were revellers, fond of drink, keen drinkers, danced round to the sound of the trees stirred by the wind.‘Ānanda, when the Palace and Lotus Pond of Truth were finished,King Mahāsudassana provided those of the ascetics and brahmans of that time who were well known with all that they wanted and then went up into the Palace of Truth.’[Second section for recitation]‘Then,Ānanda, King Mahāsudassana thought: “It is as a fruit and result of what kind of action that I now have such great fortune and power?” Then he thought: “It is as a fruit and result of three kinds of action, namely giving, control, and restraint,* that I now have such great fortune and power.”‘Then the king approached the Room of the Great Array, and stand-ing at the door he breathed a sigh: “Stop here, thoughts of sensual desire! Stop here, thoughts of hostility! Stop here, thoughts of mal-ice! This is far enough, thoughts of sensual desire! This is far enough, thoughts of hostility! This is far enough, thoughts of malice!”*‘Then King Mahāsudassana went into the Room of the Great Array and sat down on the golden couch. Secluded from sense desires and unwholesome qualities, he attained and remained in the 185186"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"109joy and happiness of the first absorption, which is accompanied by thinking and examining, and born of seclusion. By stilling thinking and examining, he attained and remained in the joy and happiness of second absorption, a state of inner clarity and mental unification that is without thinking and examining, and is born of concentration. And then, by having no desire for joy, he remained equanimous, mindful, and fully aware; he experienced the bodily happiness of which the noble one speak, saying “equanimous and mindful, one lives happily”; and so he attained and remained in the third absorp-tion. By letting go of happiness and unhappiness, as a result of the earlier disappearance of pleasure and pain, he attained and remained in the pure equanimity and mindfulness of the fourth absorption, which is free of happiness and unhappiness.‘Then King Mahāsudassana came out of the Room of the Great Array, and went into a golden chamber. And, seated on a silver couch, he stayed, pervading the first quarter with a mind full of friendliness, likewise the second, third, and fourth quarters. In the same way he stayed completely pervading the whole world, above, below, around, everywhere, with a mind full of friendliness — a mind abundant, great, measureless, free from hostility, free from affliction. He stayed, pervading the first quarter with a mind full of compassion . . . with a mind full of sympathetic joy . . . with a mind of full equanimity, likewise the second, third and fourth quarters.

He had 84,000 plates for the serving of rice every evening and morning.‘Now at that time, Ānanda, the 84,000 elephants used to come to be of service to the king every evening and morning. And the king thought: “These 84,000 elephants come to be of service to me every morning and evening, but what if they should come in two groups of 42,000, one every hundred years?” So the king addressed the adviser-treasure: “These 84,000 elephants come to be of service to me every morning and evening, but, friend, let them come in two groups of 42,000, one every hundred years.” “Yes, lord,” replied the adviser-treasure to the king. And from that time they came in two groups of 42,000 elephants, one every hundred years.‘Now after many hundreds, many hundreds of thousands of years, Queen Subhaddā thought: “I have not seen King Mahāsudassana for a long time. What if I should go and see him?” So she addressed the court women: “Come, wash your hair and put on new clothes! We have not seen the king for a long time, so let’s go and see him.” “Yes, lady,” they replied to the queen. And when they had washed their hair and put on new clothes they went to the queen, and she addressed the adviser-treasure: “Friend Adviser-Treasure, get ready the fourfold army. We have not seen the king for a long time, so we shall go and see him.” “Yes, lady,” replied the adviser-treasure. And when he had got ready the fourfold army he announced to the queen: “The fourfold army is ready for you, lady. Now it is time for you to do as you think fit.”‘So Queen Subhaddā, accompanied by the fourfold army, went with the women of the court to the Palace of Truth, and there she went up into the palace to the Room of the Great Array, where she stood leaning by the door. And the king thought: “What is that noise, like a great crowd of people?” And coming out he saw Queen Subhaddā leaning by the door. When he saw her, he said: “Stay right 188189190"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"111there, lady! Do not come in.” Then he addressed one of his men: “Come, sir, bring out the golden couch from the Room of the Great Array and make it ready in the grove of completely golden palms.” “Yes, lord,” replied the man to the king. And he brought out the golden couch from the Room of the Great Array and made it ready in the grove of completely golden palms. Then the king lay down on his right side like a lion with one foot resting on the other, mindful and fully aware.‘Then Queen Subhaddā thought, “How serene King Mahāsudassana’s senses are! How pure and clear the colour of his skin!* Surely it can’t be that the king is dying!”‘Then she said to the king: “Lord, you have 84,000 cities, the chief of which is the royal city of Kusāvatī.

For 84,000 years King Mahāsudassana enjoyed the carefree life of a young prince; for 84,000 years he was viceroy; for 84,000years he ruled the kingdom; for 84,000 years he followed the spiritual life as a householder in the Palace of Truth. Having cultivated the four sublime ways of living, at the breaking up of the body after death he was born in the Brahma world.‘Now you might think, Ānanda, that at that time King Mahāsudassana was someone else, but you should not look at it in that way, Ānanda.

Conditioned things are like that, Ānanda: they are imper-manent, not lasting, unreliable. Therefore one should be disen-chanted with all conditioned things; one should have no desire for them, one should be free of them.‘I recall laying aside the body in this place six times when living as a wheel-turning king, a righteous king of Truth, sovereign of the four quarters, maintaining the stability of the country, possessing the seven treasures. This is the seventh laying aside of the body.* But I do not see any place in this world with its gods, its Māra and Brahmā,in this generation with its ascetics and brahmans, its princes and peoples, where the Tathāgata might lay aside an eighth body.’This is what the Blessed One said. And when the Happy One had said this, the Teacher spoke again:‘Impermanent are conditioned things! It is their nature to arise and fall.Having arisen, they cease. Their stilling is happy.’King Mahāsudassana198199"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"THE ORIGIN OF THINGSAGGAÑÑA-SUTTA(D III 80–98)IntroductionIn this sutta the Buddha is approached by two novice Buddhist monks who were born into the Brahman class (va.n.na/var.na). They report to the Buddha that brahmans now look down on them for having deserted their class, claiming that the brahman class is the highest of the four classes of ancient Indian society since its members were originally born of Brahmā’smouth, and that for a brahman to become a Buddhist monk is to fall in with inferiors, descended not from Brahmā’s mouth but his feet. This claim is a reference to a brahmanical idea expressed in a hymn of the R ̊g Veda, the ‘Hymn of the Man’ (Puru.sa-sūkta) (10.90) which states that the four classes were born from the body of a primordial man (subse-quently identified with Brahmā, as here) in the course of an original sacri-ficial act which in effect brought the world as we know it into existence: the mouth of this original man became the brahmans (brāhma.na), his arms the rulers (khattiya/k.satriya), his thighs the traders (vessa/vaiśya), and his feet the servants (sudda/śūdra). The Buddha counters by asserting that true status is not a matter of the class into which one is born but of how one behaves. He then offers an alternative account of the origin of the world, society, and, in particular, the four classes. This account is a clever piece of one-upmanship suggesting that if one must put one’s trust in birth, then the ruler class (into which the Buddha was born) is in fact the superior class, and that the brahmans of the Buddha’s day are mere shad-ows of the ancient brahmans, who in fact lived a life devoted to meditation, rather similar to that followed by Buddhist monks.Some modern commentators, most notably Richard Gombrich, have suggested that this alternative account was not originally intended to be read as a straight-faced and literal account of the evolution of the world (as the subsequent Buddhist tradition has tended to read it), but as a humor-ous parody and pastiche of brahmanical methods and theories. Certainly wefind the device of seeing in words and expressions a deeper significancebeneath their surface meaning put to effective use here. Yet it is possible that this is just intended as a serious attempt to better the brahmans at their own game. The fact that irony and humour may be used here to subvert brahmanical claims, does not of itself necessarily mean that the account was intended, or understood, as anything other than a true account of the evolution of the world and society.

Once the Blessed One was staying in Sāvatthī, in the Eastern Park, in the grand building built by Migāra’smother. At that time Vāset.t.ha and Bhāradvāja who hoped to become monks were living with the monks there. Now towards sunset, when he had finished his solitary meditation, the Blessed One had come out from the building and was walking up and down outside in its shade. Now Vāset.t.ha saw the Blessed One . . . walking up and down outside in the shade of the building, and on seeing this he said to Bhāradvāja, ‘Friend Bhāradvāja, there is the Blessed One. He has finished his solitary meditation and come out from the building and is walking up and down outside in its shade. Come, Bhāradvāja! We should approach the Blessed One. We might get to hear a talk on the teaching directly from the Blessed One.’‘That’s so,’ replied Bhāradvāja to Vāset.t.ha.So Vāset.t.ha and Bhāradvāja approached the Blessed One, and when they had approached they saluted him respectfully and began walking up and down with him. Then the Blessed One spoke to Vāset.t.ha.‘Vāset.t.ha,* you two are brahmans by birth from brahman families who have left behind your brahman family and gone forth from home into homelessness. I hope that brahmans don’t insult and rep-rimand you.’‘Brahmans certainly do insult and reprimand us, sir — with their personal reprimands and in full measure.’‘So, Vāset.t.ha, how do they insult and reprimand you with their personal reprimands and in full measure?’‘ “The Brahman class,” they say, “is the best; the other classes are inferior. The brahman class is fair, the other classes are dark. Only brahmans can be pure, not non-brahmans. Only brahmans are true sons of Brahmā, born from his mouth, coming from Brahmā, created by Brahmā, heirs of Brahmā.

On the contrary, brahman women are seen ovulating, getting pregnant, giving birth, and breast-feeding. And yet these very same brahmans who were born from the womb say the brahman class is the best . . . and that only brahmans are true sons of Brahmā, born from his mouth, coming from Brahmā, created by Brahmā, heirs of Brahmā. They are insult-ing Brahmā,* telling lies, and producing a lot of demerit.‘Vāset.t.ha, there are these four classes: Rulers, Brahmans, Traders, and Servants. Sometimes someone of the Ruler class kills living crea-tures, takes what is not given, practises sexual misconduct, tells lies, speaks maliciously, speaks unkindly, chatters idly, is given to longing, has hostility in his heart, holds wrong views. In that case qualities that are unwholesome and understood as such, that are blameworthy and understood as such, that should not be pursued and are understood as such, that do not deserve the name noble and are understood as such, dark and with dark result, condemned by the wise — these qualities are seen in someone of the Ruler class.

And why not? Because it is the monk, of any of these four classes, who is an arahat and has destroyed the taints, lived the spiritual life, done what was to be done, put down the burden, reached the true goal, destroyed the fetters of existence, and is freed through faultless knowledge — it is such a one who, in accordance with good practice, not bad practice,* is called the fore-most. For it is Truth, Vāset.t.ha, that is best in the world, both here and now and for the future.‘And that Truth is best in the world, both here and now and for the future, can be seen from the following example. King Pasenadi of Kosala is fully aware that the ascetic Gotama has gone forth from the Sakya family, a family of similar rank to his own. Yet the Sakyas are subjects of King Pasenadi of Kosala. They bow down before him, The Origin of Things83"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"From the Collection of Long Sayings120salute him respectfully, stand up, bow with cupped hands, and are at his service. All this bowing down, respectful salutation, standing up, bowing with cupped hands, and service the Sakyas do for King Pasenadi of Kosala, he does for the Tathāgata, thinking, “Surely the ascetic Gotama is well born, while I am of ill birth; the ascetic Gotama is strong while I am weak; the ascetic Gotama inspires faith, while I am threatening; the ascetic Gotama commands great respect, while I command little.” Now it is precisely Truth that King Pasenadi of Kosala honours, Truth that he respects, Truth that he esteems, Truth that he worships, Truth that he serves, when he bows down before the Tathāgata, salutes him respectfully, stands up, bows with cupped hands, and is at his service. So from this example it can be seen that Truth is best in the world, both here and now and for the future.‘Vāset.t.ha, you are people of different birth,* with different names, from different lineages and families, who have gone forth from home into homelessness. When you are asked who you are, you should affirm, “We are ascetics, the sons of the Sakya.” When someone has gained faith in the Tathāgata that has taken root and become estab-lished,firm, and incapable of being swayed by any ascetic, brahman, or god, by Māra or Brahmā or anyone else in the world, then it is right that he should say, “I am the Blessed One’s true son, born of his mouth, born of Truth, created by Truth, an heir of Truth.” Why is this? Because “the one whose body is Truth”, “the one whose body is the highest”, “the one who is Truth”, “the one who is the highest” are all designations of the Tathāgata.*‘Now there comes a time, Vāset.t.ha, when, at some point, after a long period of time this world contracts. When the world contracts beings for the most part go up to the realm of the Radiant. There they exist made of mind, feeding on joy, self-luminous, moving through the air, always beautiful. They remain like this for a long, long time. Then there comes a time, Vāset.t.ha, when, at some point, after a long period of time this world evolves. When the world evolves beings for the most part fall from the realm of the Radiant and come here to this world; and they exist made of mind, feeding on joy, self-luminous, moving through the air, always beautiful.

Its look, smell, and taste were excellent: like the finest ghee or butter in col-our, like pure honey in taste. Then a being of greedy disposition thought, “I say, what do we have here!” and using his finger he tasted that essence of earth. He liked what he tasted and was overcome by craving. Other beings, following his example, also used their fingersto taste the essence of earth. They liked what they tasted and were overcome by craving. Then beings set about eating the essence of earth, taking lumps in both hands. And when they set about eating the essence of earth like this, their self-luminosity disappeared. Once their self-luminosity had disappeared, the sun and moon appeared. And once the sun and moon had appeared, the constellations of the stars appeared. And once they had appeared, night and day were distinguished, then months and half-months, and seasons and years were also distinguished. Thus far, Vāset.t.ha, this world had once more evolved.‘For a long time, Vāset.t.ha, those beings remained eating the essence of earth, consuming it and feeding on it.

Then the beings with good looks looked down on the ugly beings, thinking, “We are better-looking than they are! They are uglier than we are!” As a result of their pride in their looks the essence of earth disappeared from those proud and conceited beings. And when the essence of earth had dis-appeared they gathered together lamenting, “Oh, the taste! Oh, the taste!” So still today, when people get something tasty, they say “Oh, tasty! Oh, tasty!”* They are repeating this same ancient, original expression, yet they do not understand its meaning.‘Vāset.t.ha, when the essence of earth had disappeared a soil crust appeared for beings — just like a mushroom appearing.

For a long time beings remained eating that wild rice, consuming it and feeding on it. The more they continued to consume and feed on it the more their bodies were increasingly overtaken by coarseness, and their good and bad looks became distinguished: the female characteristics appeared in woman and male characteristics in man, and then a woman looked at a man with uncontrolled longing, and a man at a woman. And as they looked at each other like this, desire arose in them, and their bodies were overtaken by burning lust. As a result of this burning lust they engaged in sexual practice.

At that time beings who engaged in sexual practice were not allowed to enter a town or village for one or two months. Because beings at that time became uncontrollably intoxicated with wrong practice, they set about building houses in order to hide that wrong practice.‘Now, Vāset.t.ha, it occurred to one being of lazy disposition, “Oh, I am fed up with collecting rice in the evening for the evening meal and in the morning for the morning meal.

Then, when another being came to him and said, “Come, we need to go and collect rice,” he replied, “I don’t need to, I have already collected rice for the evening and morning meals.” So that other being, following his example, collected rice just once for two days, saying, “This is certainly a good idea, friend.” Then, when another being came to thisbeing and said, “Come, we need to go and collect rice,” he replied, “I don’t need to, I have already collected rice for two days.” So that other being, following his example, collected rice just once for four days, saying, “This is certainly a good idea, friend.” Then, when another being came to this being and said, “Come, we need to go and collect rice,” he replied, “I don’t need to, I have already collected rice for four days.” So that other being, following his example, collected rice just once for eight days, saying, ‘This is certainly a good idea, friend.” Because beings set about eating rice that they had stored, the grain became covered with bran and a husk, what had been cut did not grow back again, harvesting appeared, and the rice plants stood in clusters.‘Then those beings gathered together, lamenting, “Alas, bad practices have appeared among beings.

This method of recasting what were originally concrete brahmanical rituals is character-istic of early Buddhism’s approach to the brahmanical tradition, though it is not entirely without a certain precedent in the Vedic tradition itself, where external rituals are reconceived by those in the know as something internal, such as breathing, the digestion, and the sexual act.1 In Buddhist terms the emphasis in the sutta is on conduct (sīla) rather than on medita-tion and knowledge. And this conduct is recommended on the grounds not that it will bring freedom from the round of rebirth in the form of nibbana, but that it will bring happiness and well-being in this life and rebirth in a heaven world. The commentary identifies the sutta as ‘the householder’s discipline’ (gihi-vinaya), the laity’s equivalent of the monastic rule.The sutta’s ethics share much in common with general ancient Indian conceptions of good conduct, including the dhamma set out and recom-mended by the great ‘Buddhist’ emperor Aśoka in his third-century BCEedicts. This is one of the reasons why a simple equation of Aśokandhammawith Buddhist dhamma becomes problematic. Equally though, the fact that, like Aśoka’s edicts, the Sigālovada-sutta contains no mention of specific Buddhist teachings such as the four noble truths and the eightfold path, and focuses on rebirth in heaven with no mention of reaching nib-bana, makes it harder to insist categorically that Aśoka’sdhamma is notBuddhist. The sutta is perhaps a reminder that throughout history, for most Buddhists in most places, ‘Buddhism’ has meant aspiring to the kind of behaviour outlined here and to a favourable rebirth in heaven rather than the attainment of nibbana.The sutta is also a nice example of a mnemonic numerical structure: four defilements of action, four causes of doing bad deeds, six ways of los-ing belongings (each with six dangers), four false friends (each for four reasons), four true friends (each for four reasons), and covering the six directions (each in five ways).1 On the internalization of the sacrifice see Gavin Flood, An Introduction to Hinduism(Cambridge,1996),83–4."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"From the Collection of Long Sayings130This is what I have heard. Once the Blessed One was staying in the Squirrels’ Feeding Ground in the Bamboo Grove at Rājagaha. On that occasion Sigāla,* a householder’s son, had got up early and left Rājagaha, and was honouring each of the directions, bowing with cupped hands to the east, the south, the west, the north, the direction below, and the direction above, his clothes and hair all wet.*Now the Blessed One, having dressed at dawn, took his robe and bowl and went into Rājagaha for alms. And he saw Sigāla . . . honour-ing each of the directions, bowing with cupped hands to the east, the south, the west, the north, the direction below, and the direction above, his clothes and hair all wet.Seeing him, the Blessed One said: ‘Young householder, why . . . are you honouring each of the directions, bowing with cupped hands to the east, the south, the west, the north, the direction below, and the direction above, your clothes and hair all wet?’‘Sir, when my father was dying he said to me, “Son, you should honour the directions.” So out of consideration for my father’s words which I revere, value, and respect, I have got up early and left Rājagaha, and am honouring each of the directions, bowing with cupped hands to the east, the south, the west, the north, the direction below, and the direction above, my clothes and hair all wet.’‘But, young householder, this is not the way to honour the six directions in the discipline of a noble one.’‘So how then, sir, should one honour the six directions in the disci-pline of a noble one? Could the Blessed One please teach me the right way* to honour the six directions in the discipline of a noble one?’‘Then listen, young householder, and pay careful attention to what I shall say.’‘Yes, sir,’ replied Sigāla the householder’s son, and the Blessed One began to speak.‘Young householder, when the disciple of the noble ones has given up four defilements of action, does no bad deed from four causes, does not pursue six ways of losing his belongings — when he avoids these fourteen bad ways, it is then that he covers the six directions.

People do bad deeds motivated by desire, they do bad deeds motivated by hatred, they do bad deeds motivated by delusion, and they do bad deeds motivated by fear.

The version translated here is from the Majjhima-nikāya, which appears identical to its Dīgha-nikāya counterpart apart from the omission towards the end of an expanded exposition of the four noble truths.The meaning of the term sati-pat.t.hāna is problematic. It is used to refer to the fourfold practice of watching the (1) body, (2) feelings, (3) mind, and (4)mental qualities. It is perhaps most often translated as ‘foundation’ (pat.t.hāna)of ‘mindfulness’ (sati), which might suggest that sati-pat.t.hāna refers to the body, feelings mind and qualities as ‘the foundations’, in the sense of objects of mindfulness. While Buddhist tradition certainly allows such an interpretation, more often it tends to interpret the expression in the light of such phrases as ‘causing mindfulness to stand near’ (satim.upat.t.hapetvā),and sees it as directly characterizing mindfulness as a mental state that has the quality of ‘standing near’ or ‘standing in attendance’; using an English idiom, we might say that sati is defined as ‘presence of mind’. A sati-(u)pat.t.hāna is thus the ‘presence of mind’ (upat.t.hāna) that is mindfulness; the four satipat.t.hānas are then ‘four practices in which the quality of pres-ence of mind is found in the form of mindfulness’. However, the precise significance of the expression in the earliest Buddhist texts remains unclear. The present translation — ‘four ways of establishing mindful-ness’ — is merely an attempt to convey something of its meaning while avoiding an overly clumsy English phrase.After setting out in basic terms the four contemplations that constitute ‘establishing mindfulness’ — watching the body, feelings, mind, and qualities — the sutta continues by providing a detailed exposition of each.In the account of watching the body there are fourteen basic sections: (1) the monk is mindful when breathing in and out; (2) he knows his different postures; (3) he acts with clear comprehension in his various activities; (4) he reflects on the body as full of different kinds of impurity; (5) he reflects on the body as constituted by the elements of earth, water, fire, and wind; (6–14) he compares his body to a corpse in nine differentstates of putrefaction. Appended to the description of each of these fourteen"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"From the Collection of Middle-Length Sayings142practices is an expanded description of the exercise of establishing mind-fulness, culminating in the statement that ‘the monk lives independently, not holding on to anything in the world’.The practice of watching feelings and mind are each dealt with in just one section, in both cases followed by the expanded formula. Lastly, watching qualities (dhamma) is dealt with in five sections: the monk watches qualities with regard to (1) the five hindrances, (2) the fiveaggregates, (3) the six internal and external spheres of sense, (4) the seven constituents of awakening, and (5) the four noble truths. Once again, each of these five sections concludes with the expanded formula.The sutta closes with an extended statement indicating that if anyone should practise these four ways of establishing mindfulness, awakening or something very close to awakening must be the result.The expanded formula (though it is lost in the abbreviations of the text) thus occurs a total of twenty-one times. The Pali commentaries take ‘living independently and not holding onto anything in the world’ as indi-cating the possibility of awakening, and thus characterize the sutta as ‘the teaching that culminates in arahatship in twenty-one places’.The sutta is often read today as describing a pure form of insight (vipassanā) meditation that bypasses calm (samatha) meditation and the four absorptions (jhāna), as outlined in the description of the Buddhist path found, for example, in the Sāmaññaphala-sutta (also translated in this volume). The earlier tradition, however, seems not to have always read it this way, associating accomplishment in the exercise of establishing mind-fulness with abandoning of the five hindrances and the first absorption (Rupert Gethin, The Buddhist Path to Awakening: A Study of the Bodhi-Pakkhiyā Dhammā (Leiden, 1992; repr: Oxford, 2001),47–53,58–9). Significantly, neither the term vipassanā nor its associated verbal forms occur in the sutta. A simple bifurcation between ‘calm’ and ‘insight’ is, any-way, probably inappropriate in the context of much of the Nikāya material.A recent comprehensive study of ‘establishing of mindfulness’ is Anālayo,Satipt.t.hāna: The Direct Path to Realization (Birmingham, 2003).This is what I have heard. Once the Blessed One was staying in the country of the Kurus in a small town belonging to the Kurus called Kammāsadamma.There the Blessed One addressed the monks: ‘Monks.’‘Yes, sir,’ the monks replied to the Blessed One.‘Monks, this is a path leading directly* to the purification of beings — to passing beyond sorrow and grief, to the disappearance 56"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"143of pain and discontent, to finding the proper way, to the direct experience of nibbana — namely the four ways of establishing mindfulness.‘What four?

He lives watching the way things arise in the case of qualities; or he lives watching the way things pass in the case of qualities; or he lives watching the way things arise and pass in the case of qualities. Furthermore his mindfulness that there are qualities is established so that there is knowledge and recollection in full degree; he lives independently, not holding on to anything in the world.

For the most part the specifictechniques of meditation practice seem assumed, and the Nikāyas describe meditation practice in general terms by reference to the various subjects and attainments. Thus, in the Sāmaññaphala-sutta (also included in this volume) we are simply told that the monk establishes mindfulness, abandons the five hindrances, and attains the four absorptions (jhāna);there is no real indication of how this is actually accomplished. Of course, suttas such as the Satipat.t.hāna-sutta (also included in this volume) and theĀnāpānasati-sutta (not included in this volume) on mindfulness of breathing do give some general indication of how to set about meditation practice, but probably, in keeping with the general Indian attitude to the communication of learning, specific instruction was considered best given by a teacher face to face with his pupils.The present sutta apparently assumes a meditator who is trying to develop concentration by focusing his attention on a particular, but unspecified, object, and who has to deal with distracting thoughts. A series of techniques is suggested. For a modern discussion see Padmal de Silva, ‘A Psychological Analysis of the Vitakkasant.hāna Sutta’, Buddhist Studies Review,18 (2001),65–72.This is what I have heard. Once the Blessed One was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s grove, in Anāthapin.dika’s park.*There the Blessed One addressed the monks: ‘Monks.’‘Yes, sir,’ the monks replied to the Blessed One.‘A monk who is intent on meditation must from time to time direct his attention to five types of sign. Which five? In this case, monks, if, when a monk is directing his attention to a particular sign, bad, unwholesome thoughts associated with desire, hatred, and delusion arise in connection with that sign, then he should direct his attention to a different sign, one that is associated with what is whole-some.

The first part concerns the monk Arit.t.ha,who holds the view that ‘those practices said by the Blessed One to be obstacles, need not be obstacles for someone pursuing them’. Although the specifics of this view are not spelt out in the sutta itself, the commen-tary understands that they pertain to sexual activity. In short, Arit.t.haseems to hold the view that if one remains free of attachment, then there is no harm in enjoying sexual activity. Developed Buddhist psychological theory as found in the Abhidhamma commentaries would argue that such a view presents something of a psychological contradiction: it is simply not possible to simultaneously enjoy sexual activity and yet have no attach-ment; the kind of pleasure associated with sexual activity is intrinsically bound up with greed. The commentary’s understanding of the nature of Arit.t.ha’s view gains some plausibility from the fact that the response to it on the part of the monks who hear it is to point out that the Buddha has spoken about the dangers of sense pleasures at length.The Buddha’s response is to reprimand Arit.t.ha and give two similes (of the eponymous snake and of the raft) which illustrate different ways in which someone might miss the point of his teachings. He then switches to issues connected with views of the self. The sutta proceeds to give a relatively full account of the Buddhist teaching that within the five aggre-gates of physical and mental phenomena that define our individual experi-ence of the world it is not possible to identify a basis for a ‘self ’ (attan/ātman), understood as some kind of underlying unchanging subject of our changing experiences; in short, whatever we experience is ‘not self ’ (anattan). In part this teaching seems certainly directed against some such theories of the self or ātman as found in the Upanisads. Yet the precise implications of the Buddhist understanding of what is ‘not self ’ have been the subject of much discussion, both within the Buddhist world and in modern scholarly literature. It appears from the present sutta that even during the Buddha’s lifetime, it prompted some to accuse him of nihilism, a charge which he denies."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"157The single most comprehensive scholarly study of ‘not self ’ remains S.

At that time the following harmful view had come up for a monk, the former vulture killer,* called Arit.t.ha: ‘This is how I understand the practice taught by the Blessed One: those practices* said by the Blessed One to be obstacles, need not be obstacles for someone pursuing them.’When a number of monks heard it said that this harmful view had come up for a monk . . . called Arit.t.ha . . . they went to him and asked him: ‘Is it true what people say — that this harmful view has come up for you . . . ?’‘Yes, this is how I understand the practice taught by the Blessed One: those practices said by him to be obstacles, need not be obstacles for someone pursuing them.’Then those monks, wishing to make him give up this harmful view, together reprimanded, reproved, and rebuked him: ‘Arit.t.ha, friend, do not say this. Do not misrepresent the Blessed One. It is certainly not good to misrepresent him and this is certainly not what he would say. For in many ways, Arit.t.ha, have the practices been said by the Blessed One to be obstacles, and necessarily obstacles for someone pursuing them.

Has the monk Arit.t.ha, the former vulture killer, got even a glimmer of understanding in this system of teaching and discipline?’‘How could that be, sir? Certainly not.’At this, the monk Arit.t.ha became silent and confused; he sat there with drooping shoulders, looking down, deep in thought, and not saying anything in response. Seeing him like that, the Blessed One said to him: ‘Foolish man, you will be remembered for this harmful view of yours. I shall ask the monks about it.’Then the Blessed One addressed the monks: ‘Is this how you understand the practice taught by me, like this monk Arit.t.ha, who, because of his wrong grasp of things, misrepresents us, damages himself, and produces great misfortune?’‘Certainly not, sir, for in many ways has the Blessed One stated those practices to be obstacles, and necessarily obstacles for some-one pursuing them.

The near shore is fearful and dangerous, the far shore safe and free of danger, but there is no ferry or bridge to cross from one side to the other.

Why did the Buddha refuse to give categorical answers to these questions? It has been claimed by some modern scholars that the Buddha was simply not interested in metaphysical questions and that he wished to leave these matters open. Yet it is possible that the Buddha’s refusal to answer has a philosophically more interesting basis. It is stated in this sutta that one reason he did not explain these matters was because they were not connected with the goal of the Buddhist path, namely the cessation of suffer-ing. This leaves no doubt as to the practical intent of the Buddha’s teaching, but what precisely is being said about these questions when it is declared that their explanation does not conduce to the cessation of suffering? Was the Buddha suggesting that he simply did not know the answers to these questions? The Buddha of the Nikāyas certainly never straightforwardly admits to not knowing the answers. Alternatively, the Buddha might have had answers to these questions which he simply refused to divulge on the stated grounds that they would not help his followers in their progress along the path. A third possibility would seem to be that these questions are some-how by their very nature unanswerable. The reason for this is because they assume categories and concepts — the world, the soul, the self, the Tathāgata — that the Buddha and the Buddhist tradition do not accept or at least criticize or understand in particular ways. That is, from the Buddhist perspective these questions are ill-formed and misconceived. To answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to any one of them is to be drawn into accepting the validity of the question and the terms in which it is couched — rather like answering ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to a question such as, ‘Are Martians green?’ One’s answer may be construed in ways one had not intended. See Collins, Selfless Persons,131–8; for a discussion of some contemporary scholarly inter-pretations of the ‘unanswered questions’ see R. Hayes, ‘Nāgārjuna’s Appeal’,Journal of Indian Philosophy,22 (1994),299–378 (at 356–61).This is what I have heard.

The various elements that make up the narra-tive are found in other suttas in the Nikāyas, but are here brought together to produce a single, extended, first-person narrative. The sutta is found in the middle of the second set of fifty suttas of the 152 suttas that constitute the Majjhima-nikāya. Because it combines and repeats material that is found earlier in different suttas, the Bodhirājakumāra-sutta is somewhat over-looked, being largely reduced to cross-references to two other suttas (the Mahāsaccaka- and Ariyapariyesana-suttas), in the two complete English translations of the Majjhima-nikāya (by I. B. Horner, and Bhikkhu Ñān.amoli and Bhikkhu Bodhi); this is also the case with the Pali Text Society’s edition of the Pali text, but not with other editions.1 Some schools of ancient Indian Buddhism included their version of this text in their collection of long sayings (Dīrghāgama).2What prompts the Buddha to give an account of his own spiritual quest is Prince Bodhi’s idea that ‘happiness can only be reached through pain’. The Buddha recounts how he left home to become a wandering ascetic and, having initially followed two different teachers in succession, took up the practice of painful austerities. When these failed to bring him the final free-dom from suffering he was seeking, he recalled his own previous attainment of ‘the joy and happiness of the first absorption’ (jhāna); realizing that he had nothing to fear from a ‘happiness that has nothing to do with sense pleas-ures, nothing to do with unwholesome qualities’, he decided to pursue this as the basis for the final attainment of awakening —with success. The Buddha 1 Thus the introducory and concluding sections of this sutta follow the Pali text of M II 91–7; the two sections dealing with (1) the bodhisatta’s going forth and practice underĀlāra Kālāma and Uddaka Rāmaputta and (2) his hesitation and then decision to teach following Brahmā’s request follow M I 61–73 from the Ariyapariyesana-sutta; the section in the middle describing his practice of austerities and his awakening follows M I 240–9 from the Mahāsaccaka-sutta.2 See Jens-Uwe Hartmann, ‘The Contents and Structure of the Dīrghāgama of the (Mūla-)Sarvāstivādins’,Annual Report of the International Research Institute for Advanced Buddhology at Soka University,7 (2004),119–37."},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"From the Collection of Middle-Length Sayings174goes on to tell of how the great god Brahmā himself requested him to teach what he had discovered, and how as a result he first set the wheel of Truth (dhamma-cakka) in motion in the animal park outside Benares. Prince Bodhifinally asks how quickly one might attain awakening, and reaffirmsthat he goes to the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha as refuge.No indication is given here that the Buddha was born the son of a great king, a prince who enjoyed a sumptuously wealthy youth and who was prompted to renounce his wealth by his encounter with an old man, a sick man, a corpse, and ascetic; in the four Nikāyas this famous story is only related in the mythic account of a previous buddha, Vipassin (D II 21–31).For further discussion and suggestions for further reading see Gethin, Foundations of Buddhism,7–34,306–7.This is what I have heard. Once the Blessed One was staying in the Bhagga country at Sumsumāragira, in the Bhesakalā grove in the animal park. At that time Prince Bodhi had recently had built a building called Kokanada, but it had not yet been occupied by any ascetic or brahman or by any human being.Then Prince Bodhi spoke to the brahman student Sañjikāputta:‘My good Sañjikāputta, go to the Blessed One, and having approached him bow down at his feet with your head in my name and ask if he is free of sickness and disease, if he is in good health and strong, if he lives at ease, saying, “Sir, Prince Bodhi bows down at your feet with his head and asks if you are free of sickness and disease, if you are in good health and strong, if you live at ease.” And then say, “Sir, may the Blessed One along with the community of monks accept Prince Bodhi’s invitation for tomorrow’s meal.” ’‘Yes, sir,’ replied the brahman student Sañjikāputta.Then he approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he saluted the Blessed One respectfully, and exchanged pleasing and polite words with him, before sitting down to one side.Once seated, he said to the Blessed One: ‘Gotama sir,* Prince Bodhi bows down at Gotama’s feet with his head and asks if you are free of sickness and disease, if you are in good health and strong, if you live at ease. He asks further whether Gotama along with the community of monks might accept Prince Bodhi’s invitation for tomorrow’s meal.’By his silence the Blessed One accepted. Understanding that he had accepted the invitation, the brahman student Sañjikāputta got up from his seat and approached Prince Bodhi."},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"175Having approached he said to him: ‘I have conveyed your message to Gotama as you asked . . .

Then, early in the morning, the Blessed One put on his outer robes and, taking his bowl, went together with the community of monks to Prince Bodhi’s home. At that time the Prince was standing in the outer porch waiting for the Blessed One. When he saw him he went out to salute him respectfully, and then, letting the Blessed One walk ahead, he approached the Kokanada building.By the lowest step the Blessed One stopped, and Prince Bodhi said to him: ‘Sir, may the Blessed One step on the cloths, may the Happy One step on the cloths, in order that it will contribute to my long- lasting welfare and happiness.’At this the Blessed One was silent.A second time Prince Bodhi said to him: ‘Sir, may the Blessed One step on the cloths . . .’A second time the Blessed One was silent.A third time Prince Bodhi said to him: ‘Sir, may the Blessed One step on the cloths . . .’Then the Blessed One looked towards the venerable Ānanda.The venerable Ānanda said to the prince: ‘Gather up your cloths, prince. The Blessed One will not walk on strips of cloth. The Tathāgata has regard for later generations.’*So Prince Bodhi had the cloths gathered up and had seats prepared on the upper floor of the Kokanada building. Then the Blessed One went up into the building with the company of monks and they sat down on the appointed seats. And Prince Bodhi waited on the Blessed One and the community of monks, serving them with thefine foods with his own hands. And when the Blessed One had The Dialogue with Prince Bodhi92"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"From the Collection of Middle-Length Sayings176finished eating and washed his hands and bowl, Prince Bodhi brought a low seat and sat down to one side.Once seated, he said to the Blessed One: ‘Sir, my idea is this: happiness cannot be reached through happiness, it can only be reached through pain.’‘Prince, before my awakening, when I was not fully awakened but merely intent on awakening,* I too had the idea that happiness could not be reached through happiness, but could only be reached through pain. So after some time, while still a young man with a head of black hair and the advantages of being in the firstflush of youth, against the wishes of my mother and father, who wept, their faces covered with tears, I shaved off my hair and beard, put on ochre robes, and went forth from home into homelessness. Once I had gone forth like this in search of what is wholesome, in quest of the ultimate state of sublime peace, I approached Ālāra Kālāma. Having approached, I said to Ālāra: “My friend Kālāma, I wish to follow the spiritual life according to this teaching and discipline.”‘At this, Ālāra Kālāma said to me: “Let the venerable sir stay here. This teaching is one in which a clever person can quite soon come to live, experiencing and attaining for himself through direct knowledge what the teacher has understood.” So I quite soon, quite quickly, learnt his teaching.* As far as mere mouthing of the words, mere repeating of what had been repeated to me, I declared my knowledge and assurance;* I— like the others — claimed, “I know, I see.” But then it occurred to me that Ālāra Kālāma did not declare himself just by faith alone to live, having experienced and attained this teaching for himself through direct knowledge; certainly he must live knowing and seeing this teaching. So I approached ĀlāraKālāma, and having approached I said to him: “Friend Kālāma, this teaching that you declare, how far have you experienced and attained it for yourself through direct knowledge?”* In response ĀlāraKālāma declared the sphere of nothingness.*‘Then it occurred to me: “Ālāra Kālāma is not the only one to have faith, I too have faith; he is not the only one to have energy, I too have energy; he is not the only one to have mindfulness, I too have mind-fulness; he is not the only one to have concentration, I too have concentration; he is not the only one to have wisdom, I too have wisdom.

Come, friend, the two of us together should look after this community now.”‘SoĀlāra Kālāma, who was my teacher, placed me, his pupil, on the exact same level as him, and showed me the highest respect. But it occurred to me that that teaching did not conduce to disenchant-ment, nor dispassion, nor cessation, nor peace, nor direct knowledge, nor awakening, nor nibbana, but only to rebirth in the sphere of nothingness. Finding no satisfaction in that teaching, I lost my enthusiasm for it, and left.‘In search of what is wholesome, in quest of the ultimate state of sublime peace, I approached Uddaka Rāmaputta. Having approached, I said to Uddaka: “My friend, I wish to follow the spiritual life according to this teaching and discipline.”‘At this, Uddaka Rāmaputta said to me: “Let the venerable sir stay here. This teaching is one in which a clever person can quite soon come to live, experiencing and attaining for himself through direct knowledge what the teacher has understood.” So I quite soon, quite quickly, learnt his teaching. As far as mere mouthing of the words, mere repeating of what had been repeated to me, I declared my knowledge and assurance; I— like the others — claimed, “I know, I see.” But then it occurred to me that Rāma had not declared him-selfjust by faith alone to live, having experienced and attained this The Dialogue with Prince Bodhi165"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"From the Collection of Middle-Length Sayings178teachingfor himself through direct knowledge; certainly he must have lived knowing and seeing this teaching. So I approached Uddaka Rāmaputta, and having approached I said to him: “Friend, this teaching that he declared, how far did Rāma* experience and attain for himself through direct knowledge?” In response, Uddaka Rāmaputta declared the sphere of neither consciousness nor unconsciousness.*‘Then it occurred to me: “Rāma was not the only one to have faith, I too have faith; he was not the only one to have energy, I too have energy; he was not the only one to have mindfulness, I too have mind-fulness; he was not the only one to have concentration, I too have con-centration; he was not the only one to have wisdom, I too have wisdom. Why shouldn’t I apply myself to experiencing that same teaching which he declared that he lived, having experienced and attained for himself through direct knowledge?”‘So I quite soon, quite quickly, came to live, experiencing and attaining that teaching for myself through direct knowledge. Then I approached Uddaka Rāmaputta, and having approached I asked him: “Friend, this teaching that he declared, is it this far that Rāmaexperienced and attained for himself through direct knowledge?”‘ “It is this far . . .”‘ “Friend, this far I too live, experiencing and attaining this teaching for myself through direct knowledge.”‘ “This is a gain for us, friend, a fortunate gain for us, that we should live to see such a companion in the spiritual life.

There I saw a delightful place, a pleasing grove of trees, a river flowing with clear water with easy access to its banks, and all around delightful villages for seeking alms. And it occurred to me that here was a delightful place . . . that was exactly what a son of family intent on striving needed for that striving. So I sat down right there with the idea that it was exactly the place for striving. Moreover, three similes, unheard of previously, spontaneously came to mind.

So I mentally held down my mind. I crushed it and overwhelmed it, gritting my teeth and pressing my tongue against the roof of my mouth, with the sweat pouring from my armpits.

He’s an arahat. This is exactly the way arahats live.”‘It occurred to me that I might take on the practice of cutting out food entirely. Then gods asked me not to take on the practice of cut-ting out food entirely. They told me that if I did they would feed me through the pores with divine nourishment, and that I would be sustained by that. Then I thought that if I claimed to be keeping a strict fast, yet gods were feeding me through the pores with divine nourishment and I was being sustained by that, then I would be lying. So I refused those gods and told them there was no need.‘So it occurred to me that I might take very little food, just a morsel at a time, whether of mung-bean soup, lentil soup, chickpea soup, or pea soup. So I took very little food, just a morsel at a time 245"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"183of mung-bean, lentil, chickpea, or pea soup. And when I did this my body became extremely emaciated: my limbs became like the jointed stems of creepers or bamboo because of eating so little; my backside became like a buffalo’s hoof; my backbone, bent or straight, became like corded beads; my ribs jutted and stuck out like the jutting and broken rafters of an old house; the pupils of my eyes when glimpsed sunk deep in their sockets were like the glint of water seen deep down at the bottom of a deep well; my scalp became withered and shrivelled like a fresh bitter gourd that has been withered and shrivelled by the wind and sun. When I wanted to touch the skin of my belly I felt my backbone, and when I wanted to touch my back-bone I felt the skin of my belly; in fact the skin of my belly stuck to my backbone because of eating so little. When I wanted to urinate or defecate I fell over right there on my face because of eating so little. I stroked my limbs with my hand in order to soothe my body, but because of eating so little, as I rubbed my limbs with my hand, the hairs, whose roots had grown rotten, dropped from my body. Moreover, when non-human beings saw me they said: “The ascetic Gotama is black.” But some non-human beings said: “The ascetic Gotama isn’t black, he’s brown.” And some non-human beings said: “The ascetic Gotama isn’t black, nor is he brown. His skin is sallow.” So much had my skin lost its clear complexion because of eating so little.‘And it occurred to me that whoever in the past were ascetics or brahmans who experienced feelings of sharp, violent, severe, pain as a result of their practices, it was not beyond this extreme. Whoever in the future will be ascetics or brahmans who will experience feelings of sharp, violent, severe pain as a result of their practices, it will not be beyond this extreme. Whoever in the present are ascetics or brahmans who experience feelings of sharp, violent, severe pain as a result of their practices in the present, it is not beyond this extreme. And yet by means of this severe, harsh practice* I had achieved no special knowledge and insight beyond the capacity of human beings and worthy of the noble ones: might there in fact be another path to awakening? Then it occurred to me that I remembered that when I was sitting in the cool shade of a rose apple tree while my Sakyan father was engaged in work, I had spent time having attained the joy and happiness of the first absorption, which is accompanied by thinking and examining, and is born of seclusion: might this in fact The Dialogue with Prince Bodhi246"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"From the Collection of Middle-Length Sayings184be the path to awakening? Then immediately following that memory I became aware that this was indeed the path to awakening. I asked myself why I feared this happiness, which was a happiness that had nothing to do with sense pleasures, nothing to do with unwholesome qualities. Then I decided that I would not fear this happiness, which was a happiness that had nothing to do with sense pleasures, nothing to do with unwholesome qualities.‘It occurred to me that it would not be easy to achieve this happi-ness with a body that had become so extremely emaciated, so I thought I should take some solid food, some rice gruel. Then I took solid food, some rice gruel. Now at that time there were five monks with me, who thought: “The ascetic Gotama* will inform us of any Truth he achieves.” But after I had taken some solid food, some rice gruel, those five monks lost their enthusiasm for me and left, thinking: “The ascetic Gotama is one for excess. He has given up the struggle and reverted to a life of excess.”‘Once I had taken solid food and regained my strength, I lived completely secluded from sense desires and unwholesome qualities of mind, having attained the joy and happiness of the first absorption, which is accompanied by thinking and examining, and born of seclu-sion. Then, by stilling thinking and examining, I lived having attained the joy and happiness of the second absorption, a state of inner clarity and mental unification without thinking and examining, and born of concentration. By having no desire for joy, I lived equanimously, mindful and fully aware; I experienced the bodily happiness of which the noble ones speak, saying “equanimous and mindful, one lives happily”, and so I lived, having attained the third absorption. By letting go of happiness and unhappiness, as a result of the earlier disappearance of pleasure and pain, I lived having attained the pure equanimity and mindfulness of the fourth absorption, which is free of happiness and unhappiness.‘Once my mind was concentrated in this way, once it was thoroughly purified and cleansed — stainless, without defilements,having become sensitive, workable, and steady, reaching a state that is unshakeable — I applied and directed my mind towards the knowl-edge of recollection of previous lives. I remembered my numerous previous lives: one birth, two births, three, four, five births; ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty births; a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand births; over many periods of expansion of the universe, 247248"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"185over many periods of contraction, over many periods of expansion and contraction. I remembered, “In that life I had that name, belonged to that family, that class, had that food, experienced that unhappiness, that happiness, and met my end in that way. When I died there I was born in that place. There I had that name, belonged to that family, that class, had that food, experienced that unhappi-ness, that happiness, and met my end in that way. When I died there I was born here.” In this way I remembered the various circum-stances and details of my many previous lives. Prince, this was the first knowledge I achieved in the first watch of the night: ignorance was dispelled, knowledge arose, darkness was dispelled, light arose, as I lived attentive, determined, applying myself to this.‘Once my mind was concentrated in this way, once it was thoroughly purified and cleansed — stainless, without defilements, having become sensitive, workable, and steady, reaching a state that is unshakeable — I applied and directed my mind towards the knowledge of the death and birth of beings. With the godlike vision that is purified, surpassing that of men, I saw beings dying and being born. I understood how beings are inferior or superior, fair or ugly, fortu-nate or unfortunate, according to their actions: “These beings behaved badly in body, badly in speech, badly in thought; disparaging the noble ones, they held wrong views and performed the sorts of action that follow from wrong view. At the breaking up of the body after death they were born in hell, a realm of loss, misfortune, and torment. These beings, on the other hand, behaved well in body, well in speech, well in thought; not disparaging the noble ones, they held right views and performed the sorts of action that follow from right view. At the breaking up of the body after death they were born in a happy heaven world.” In this way, with the godlike vision that is purified, surpassing that of men, I saw beings dying and being born. I understood how beings are inferior or superior, fair or ugly, fortunate or unfortunate, according to their actions. Prince, this was the second knowledge I achieved in the second watch of the night: ignorance was dispelled, knowledge arose, darkness was dis-pelled, light arose, as I lived attentive, determined, applying myself to this.‘Once my mind was concentrated in this way, once it was thoroughly purified and cleansed — stainless, without defilements, having become sensitive, workable, and steady, reaching a state that is The Dialogue with Prince Bodhi249"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"From the Collection of Middle-Length Sayings186unshakeable — I applied and directed my mind towards the knowledge of the destruction of taints.

I truly knew what taints are, I truly knew what the arising of taints is, I truly knew what the cessation of taints is, I truly knew what the practice leading to the cessation of taints is. In the course of know-ing this and seeing this, my mind was freed from the taint of sense desire, my mind was freed from the taint of being, my mind was freed from the taint of ignorance. And when it was freed, there was knowl-edge that it was freed: I understood, “Birth is destroyed. The spiritual life has been lived. Done is what should be done. There is nothing further required to this end.” Prince, this was the third knowledge I achieved in the third watch of the night: ignorance was dispelled, knowledge arose, darkness was dispelled, light arose, as I lived attentive, determined, applying myself to this.‘Then it occurred to me that the Truth I had found was profound, hard to see, hard to understand; it was peaceful, sublime, beyond the sphere of mere reasoning, subtle, to be experienced by the wise. But this generation takes delight in belongings, is delighted by belong-ings, enjoys belongings. And because it takes delight in belongings, is delighted by belongings, enjoys belongings it is hard for this gener-ation to see the possibility of things having specific causes and arising in dependence on things; it is hard for this generation to see the pos-sibility of stilling all volitional forces, of relinquishing all attachments, of destroying craving, of dispassion, cessation, nibbana. If I were to teach the Truth, others would not understand me, and that would be distressing and hurtful for me. Moreover these verses, unheard of previously, spontaneously came to mind:With difficulty I have made this discovery, there is no need now to explain it;Those overwhelmed by greed and hatred will not easily wake up to this Truth.Going against the stream, subtle, profound, hard to see, fine —Those impassioned by greed, enveloped in a thick darkness, will not see it.So, Prince, as I reflected in this way my mind inclined to the least discomfort, not to teaching the Truth.I 167168"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"187‘Then, Prince, when Brahmā, Lord of the Earth, understood in his mind what I was thinking, he thought, “The world is lost! The world is finished! For here is the Tathāgata, an arahat, perfectly awakened, and his mind inclines to the least discomfort, not to teach-ing the Truth.” Then, just as a strong man might straighten his bent arm or bend his straightened arm, Brahmā, Lord of the Earth, disap-peared from the world of Brahmā and appeared in front of me. Having arranged his robe over one shoulder, he bowed to me with cupped hands and said: “Sir, let the Blessed One teach the Truth!*Let the Happy One teach the Truth! There are beings with little dust in their eyes who will be lost if they do not hear the Truth. They will understand the Truth.”‘This is what Brahmā, Lord of the Earth, said. And then he spoke further:‘ “There appeared in Magadha previously a Truth that was impure,conceived by those who are tarnished.Open the door to the deathless!

As I surveyed the world I saw beings with little dust in their eyes and with much dust in their eyes, with keen faculties and with dull faculties, of good habits and of bad habits, easy to teach and difficult to teach, some who lived seeing the danger in wrongdoing for the next world, some who lived without seeing the danger in wrongdoing for the next world.

With the godlike vision that is purified, surpassing that of men, I saw the group of five monks were now living in Benares, in the animal park at Isipatana. So, having stayed at Uruvelā as long as I wanted, I set out to walk to Benares.‘On the road between the place of awakening and Gayā, Upaka, an Ājīvika,* saw me. When he saw me he said: “How serene your senses are, friend! How pure and clear the colour of your skin! Friend, under whom have you gone forth? Who is your teacher? Whose Truth do you follow?” When he had said this, I responded with these verses:‘ “I have overcome all, I know all.Where there are all qualities, I am unmarked.Letting go of all, in the destruction of craving I am freed.When I have direct knowledge by myself, to whom should I refer?I have no teacher, none like me is foundIn the world with its gods, no person is my equal.I am the one who is worthy, I am the incomparable teacher in the world;I alone am perfectly awakened, cooled, satisfied.To turn the wheel of Truth, I go to the city of Kāsi.In this world that is blind I will beat the drum for the deathless!”‘ “According to your claim, friend, you must be conqueror* of the infinite.”‘ “Like me, indeed, the conquerors are those who have achieved the destruction of taints.I have conquered bad qualities, therefore, Upaka, I am a conqueror!”‘At this, Upaka the Ājīvika said: “Maybe, friend. Maybe.” Then, shaking his head, he left, taking some other path.*‘Then I made my way in stages to the animal park at Isipatana in Benares, where I approached the group of five monks.

But we will allow him a seat: if he wants to, he can sit down.”‘Yet as I came nearer that group of five monks was unable to stick to their agreement: several came forward to meet me, several showed me to a seat, several set out water for my feet. However, they did address me by name and the title “friend”. At this I told the group offive monks: “Monks, do not address one who is like this (tathāgata)by name and the title friend. The one who is like this is an arahat, perfectly awakened. Listen! The deathless is achieved. I will give instruction, I will teach the Truth. If you practise as instructed then soon you will come to live, having experienced and attained here and now for yourselves through direct knowledge the ultimate goal of the spiritual life, for the sake of which the sons of families quite rightly go forth from home into homelessness.”‘At this the group of five monks replied: “Friend Gotama, by means of your conduct, by means of your practice, by means of your severe, harsh practice you achieved no special knowledge and insight beyond the capacity of human beings and worthy of the noble ones.

The subject of both suttas is actions and their results, that is, what is generally referred to in Indian thought as ‘karma’. According to the general Indian theory our actions (kamma/karman) bear fruit both in this life and, most significantly, in sub-sequent lives: bad actions bear pleasant fruit and good actions unpleasant. The beginnings of a theory of karma are found in the Vedic texts such as the Upanisads. Subsequent Indian thought develops the theory in various ways. The different traditions — Jain, Buddhist, Hindu — all have distinc-tive notions of precisely what constitutes a good or bad action and of the manner in which actions yield their karmic results.The Buddhist understanding is that it is intentional actions that are significant — actions motivated either by greed, hatred, and delusion or by non-attachment, friendliness, and wisdom. In the Cūl.a-Kammavibhan.ga-sutta the Buddha gives a straightforward explanation of how bad actions result in rebirth in unfortunate and unpleasant circumstances. In the Mahā-Kammavibhan.ga-sutta he explains that in practice things are not quite as simple as this: in short, the acts do not always bear their fruits in strict order, and a person’s state of mind at the time of death is also significant in determining rebirth. Thus, it is possible that someone who commits bad actions in one life may be reborn in the immediately following life in pleasant circumstances, and vice versa.The sutta anticipates ideas that are developed and articulated in consid-erable technical detail in later Buddhist systematic thought; see R. Gethin, ‘Bhavan.ga and Rebirth According to the Abhidhamma’, in Tadeusz Skorupski and Ulrich Pagel (eds.), The Buddhist Forum, vol. 3 (London: School of Oriental and African Studies, 1994),11–35. For the notion of karma more generally in Indian thought see W. Doniger (ed.), Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian Traditions (Berkeley, 1980).1 M III 202–6."},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"From the Collection of Middle-Length Sayings196This is what I have heard. Once the Blessed One was staying at Rājagaha, in the Squirrels’ Feeding Ground in the Bamboo Grove.*At that time the venerable Samiddhi was living in a forest hut. Now the wanderer Potaliputta, who was on the move, walking and roaming about, approached the venerable Samiddhi. Having approached, he saluted him respectfully, exchanging pleasing and polite words with him before sitting down to one side.Once seated, he said to the venerable Samiddhi: ‘I have heard this directly from the ascetic Gotama, I have learnt this directly from him: acts of the body are futile, acts of speech are futile, acts of the mind are alone real. And also that there is an attainment in which a person who attains it experiences nothing!’‘Don’t speak in this way, friend Potaliputta! Don’t speak in this way! Don’t misrepresent the Blessed One. It is not good to misrepresent theBlessed One. Certainly he wouldn’t say that acts of the body and speech are futile, and that acts of the mind are alone real. And in fact there is an attainment in which a person who attains it experiences nothing.’‘How long is it since you went forth, friend Samiddhi?’‘Not long. Three years.’‘Now why should we speak to the senior monks when a junior monk thinks his teacher can be defended in this way? Samiddhi, when one performs an act intentionally by body, speech, or mind, what does one experience?’‘When one performs an act intentionally by body, speech, or mind, one experiences pain.’Thereupon the wanderer Potaliputta neither agreed nor disagreed with the venerable Samiddhi’s words, but simply got up from his seat and went away. Not long after Potaliputta had left, the venerable Samiddhi approached the venerable Ānanda. Having approached, he saluted him respectfully, exchanging pleasing and polite words with him before sitting down to one side. Once seated, the venerable Samiddhi told the venerable Ānanda in full of the discussion he had had with the wanderer Potaliputta.When he had finished, the venerable Ānanda said: ‘Friend Samiddhi, the subject raised in your conversation is a reason for visiting the Blessed One. Come, friend Samiddhi, let us approach the Blessed One. Having approached him, we should tell him about this, and then we can remember how he explains the matter.’208"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"197‘Yes, friend,’ replied the venerable Samiddhi to the venerable Ānanda.’Then the venerable Samiddhi and the venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One.

But this confused person Samiddhi has responded to the wanderer Potaliputta’s question categorically when it should have been answered after analysis.’At this, the venerable Udāyin said to the Blessed One: ‘But perhaps the venerable Samiddhi said what he did with reference to the fact that whatever is experienced counts as pain.’‘See,Ānanda, how this confused person Udāyin has jumped to a conclusion! I knew just now that he was trying to come up with something and that he would come up with the wrong idea! From the start the wanderer Potaliputta was asking about the three feelings. If this confused Samiddhi had explained to the wanderer Potaliputta as follows when he had been asked this question — that when one performs an act intentionally by body, speech, or mind that is to be experienced as pleasure, one experiences pleasure; when one per-forms an act intentionally by body, speech, or mind that is to be experienced as pain, one experiences pain; when one performs an act intentionally by body, speech, or mind that is to be experienced as neither pleasure nor pain, one experiences neither pleasure nor pain — then this confused Samiddhi would have explained the mat-ter correctly. And yet which of these childish and foolish followers of another school would understand the Tathāgata’s full analysis of action? But what if you, Ānanda, were to listen to the Tathāgata as he sets out the full analysis of action?’‘It is the time for this, Blessed One. It is the time for this, Happy One — time for the Blessed One to set out the full analysis of action. What the monks hear from the Blessed One they will remember.’‘Then listen, Ānanda.

The Nidāna-,Khandha-, and Sa.lāyatana-vaggas are each named after the particular group of suttas that dominates them, and which accounts for around half the material in each of these vaggas: the groups of suttas on causes (nidāna-sa.myutta), aggregates (khandha-sa.myutta), and the six senses (sa.lāyatana-sa.myutta) respectively. The ‘with verses’ chapter is a miscellaneous collection of grouped suttas that all contain verses. The final ‘Great Chapter’, while not dominated by a single group, nevertheless centres on a particular set of seven groups: suttas on the path (magga-sa.myutta), the constituents of awakening (bojjha.nga-sa.myutta), the establishing of mindfulness (satipa.t t.hāna-sa.myutta), the faculties (indriya-sa.myutta), right application (sammappadhāna-sa.myutta), the powers (bala-sa.myutta), the bases of accomplishment (iddhipāda-sa.myutta). These seven sets are, in a number of places in the Nikāyas (such as the Mahā-Parinibbāna-sutta, also included in this volume), presented as encapsulat-ing the Buddhist path to awakening. Later Buddhist tradition identifiesthe individual items that constitute these seven sets as collectively the thirty-seven ‘qualities that contribute to awakening’ (bodhi-pakkhiya-dhamma/bodhi-pāk. sika-dharma).1 The Great Chapter also includes the group of suttas on the four noble truths (sacca-sa.myutta).What is evident is that the Samyutta-nikāya is structured around a basic list (mātikā) of fundamental items of Buddhist teaching:2 The current selection is intended to reflect this overall structure of the Samyutta-nikāya. We begin with one sutta from the Sagātha-vagga, and then have two suttas each from the principal groups of the remaining four chapters. The selection is necessarily somewhat arbitrary, but is intended to exemplify something of the flavour of the generally shorter pieces that characterize this Nikāya.1 R. Gethin, The Buddhist Path to Awakening: A Study of the Bodhi-PakkhiyāDhammā,2nd edn. (Oxford, 2001).2 R. Gethin, ‘The Mātikās: Memorization, Mindfulness and the List’, in J. Gyatso (ed.),In The Mirror of Memory: Reflections on Mindfulness and Remembrance in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism (Albany, NY, 1992),149–72."},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"From the Collection of Grouped Sayings208In the case of the Mahā-vagga or Great Chapter, the second sutta in each case is an example of one of the ‘repetition’ ( peyyāla) sections, although in three of the groups the repetition sections are all there is, so it is the only sutta. These repetition sections are characteristic of the Samyutta-nikāya generally and the Great Chapter in particular. Modern editors and translators have not always looked kindly on these repetitions, but they remain integral to Pali literature. A ‘repetition’ works by setting down a basic pattern in the form of an initial sutta and then repeats the sutta changing one element in that pattern each time. The repetition section chosen for the present volume is the ‘Ganges repetition’ (Ga.ngā-peyyāla), which, if recited in full, would involve the recitation of forty-eight separate suttas (6 ¥2 ¥4):Just as the river (1) Ganges, (2) Yamunā, (3) Aciravatī, (4) Sarabhū, (5) Mahī,(6) great rivers incline[s] to (1) the east, (2) the ocean, so a monk who cultivates the eight constituents of the path (1) based on seclusion . . . (2) ending in the removal of greed . . . (3) immersed in the deathless . . . (4) inclining to nibbana . . ., himself inclines to nibbana.All manuscripts, editions, and translations abbreviate such repetitions, though some more than others. Such repetitions seem to have a number of effects. In the first place the doctrinal and practical importance of the items that are the subject of the repetitions is highlighted and enhanced. Moreover, in the case of the Ganges repetition as applied to various qualities that contribute to awakening, something of the depth and richness of the awakening experience is evoked. This kind of repetition also requires and develops a certain mental alertness and agility that goes beyond mere rote repetition, such that it can be considered a practice for developing the Buddhist meditative virtues of mindfulness and concentration. It is a meditation in itself for reciter, listener, and reader.3A set of five repetitions beginning with the Ganges repetition is applied in eight of the Great Chapter’s twelve groups of suttas: the eighth group in addition to the groups mentioned above is the ‘absorption’ (jhāna)group, indicating a close relationship between the cultivation of the ways of establishing mindfulness, the ways of right application, the bases of accomplishment, the faculties, the powers, the constituents of awakening, and the eightfold path on the one hand and the four absorptions on the other.In the Samyutta-nikāya, the names of suttas are not as fixed by the tradi-tion as in the Dīgha- and Majjhima-nikāyas, and I introduce them by the usually single terms that are used as something of a mnemonic tag but which are not always consistent in the manuscripts and editions.3 See R.

Once the Blessed One was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s grove, in Anāthapindika’s park. Then, well into the night, a god, Rohitassa, of surpassing beauty approached the Blessed One, illuminating the whole Jeta grove. When he had approached, he saluted the Blessed One respectfully and stood to one side. Standing there, the god Rohitassa spoke to the Blessed One.‘Sir, by travelling is it possible to know or see or reach the end of the world, where one is not born, does not grow old, does not die, does not fall away, is not reborn?’‘Friend, I say that not by travelling could one know or see or reach the end of the world, where one is not born, does not grow old, does not die, does not fall away, is not reborn.’‘It is remarkable, extraordinary, sir, how this is well put by the Blessed One when you say that not by travelling could one know or see or reach the end of the world, where one is not born, does not grow old, does not die, does not fall away, is not reborn.‘Once in the past I was a seer called Rohitassa, a pupil of Bhoja’s, who had the power to travel through the sky.

As from the eastern to the western ocean, such was my stride. This wish arose in me: “By travelling I shall reach the end of the world.” Possessing such speed and such a stride, having a life of a hundred years, and living a hundred years, I travelled for a hundred years, only stopping to eat, drink, and take meals, to defecate and urinate, to relieve my tiredness in sleep, and still I died on the way without reaching the end of the world.‘It is remarkable, extraordinary, sir, how this is well put by the Blessed One when you say that not by travelling could one know or see or reach the end of the world, where one is not born, does not grow old, does not die, does not fall away, is not reborn.’‘And yet, friend, I say that there is no making an end to sufferingwithout reaching the end of the world. But it is in this fathom-long body which has a mind and conceives, that I declare the world, the arising of the world, the ceasing of the world, and the practice lead-ing to the ceasing of the world.‘By travelling, the end of the world will never be reached;But without reaching its end, from suffering there is no release.And so the wise one, knowing the world,Dwelling in the spiritual life goes to the end of the world,And knowing the world’s end, he is still,Not wishing for this world nor another.’FROM THE CHAPTER ON CAUSESNIDĀNA-VAGGAAnalysis (S II 2–4)This is what I have heard. Once the Blessed One was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s grove, in Anāthapindika’s park.‘I shall teach you, monks, dependent arising and I shall analyse it. Listen. Pay careful attention to what I shall say.’‘Yes, sir,’ replied those monks to the Blessed One.This is what the Blessed One said: ‘And what is dependent arising?

Once the Blessed One was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s grove, in Anāthapindika’s park.‘I say that it is when one knows, when one sees that one destroys the taints, not when one does not know, when one does not see.

Once the Blessed One was staying in the Bhagga country at Sumsumāragira, in the Bhesakalā grove in the animal park. Now the householder Nakulapitar approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he sat down to one side.Once seated, he said to the Blessed One: ‘Sir, I am old, getting on, of a venerable age and experienced in life. Having reached a great age, I am sick in body and frequently ill. So I cannot always get to see the Blessed One or revered monks. Sir, could the Blessed One please direct me, please instruct me, as this would contribute to my welfare and happiness for a long time to come?’‘This is the way it is, householder. This is the way it is. Your body is sick, oppressed,* and afflicted. For how could anyone carrying around this body claim freedom from disease for even a second, unless, that is, he was being childish? Therefore you should practise so that although your body is sick your mind will not be sick. This is how you should practise.’When the householder Nakulapitar had enjoyed and expressed his appreciation of what the Blessed One said, he got up from his seat, respectfully saluted the Blessed One, keeping him on his right, and then approached the venerable Sāriputta.

Once the Blessed One was staying at Sāvatthī . . .Now in the morning a considerable number of monks, having dressed, took their robes and bowls and went into Sāvatthī in search of alms. Then it occurred to those monks that since it was still too early to be collecting alms, they might go to the park of the wander-ers belonging to another school. So they approached their park, and having approached, they saluted the wanderers of the other school respectfully, exchanging pleasing and polite words with them before sitting down to one side.Once the monks were seated, the wanderers said to them: ‘Friends, the ascetic Gotama teaches the following practice to his disciples: “Come, monks, abandon the five hindrances that come as defilementsof the mind weakening wisdom, and truly cultivate the seven con-stituents of awakening.” We too teach our disciples this practice . . .So what is the distinction, what is the difference, between the ascetic Gotama’s teaching or instruction and ours or of our teaching or instruction and the ascetic Gotama’s? What makes them unlike each other?’The monks neither agreed nor disagreed with the words of the wanderers of the other school, but simply got up from their seats and went away, thinking, ‘We will get to understand the significance of what has been said when we see the Blessed One.’Then, after they had collected alms, eaten their meal, and returned from the alms round, the monks approached the Blessed One. Having approached, they saluted him respectfully and sat down to one side.Once seated, those monks said to the Blessed One: ‘Sir, this morn-ing, having dressed, we took our robes and bowls and went into Sāvatthī in search of alms.

When the mind is stirred up, which of the constituents of awakening is it not the right time to cultivate, and which of the con-stituents of awakening is it the right time to cultivate?” When ques-tioned in this way, the wanderers of the other school will not succeed in their response and will stray further towards failure. What is the reason for this? Because this falls beyond their reach: I do not see anyone in this world with its gods, with its Māra and Brahmā, or in this generation with its ascetics and brahmans, its princes and peoples, who could satisfy the mind with his explanation of these questions, unless it was the Tathāgata or a disciple of the Tathāgataor someone who had heard it from them.‘When the mind is dull, then it is not the right time to cultivate tranquillity as a constituent of awakening, concentration as a constituent of awakening, and equanimity as a constituent of awak-ening.

Now at that time a lot of the monks who lived on the lower floor of the building were agitated, uncontrolled, restless, talkative, conversing about this and that; with their minds astray, they were not fully aware, not concentrated; their thoughts wandered and their senses were uncontrolled.

Go and shake those monks up!’*‘Yes, sir,’ the venerable Moggallāna the Great replied to the Blessed One.So he contrived an act of accomplishment in meditation such that with his big toe he made the building of Migāra’s mother shake, shudder, and quake.

Once the Blessed One was staying in Benares, at Isipatana in the animal park.There the Blessed One addressed the group of five monks: ‘Monks, there are two extremes that someone who has gone forth should not be involved in.

Not approaching either of these two extremes, the Tathāgata has thor-oughly understood that it is the middle way of practice that brings insight and knowledge, that conduces to peace, to direct knowledge, to awakening, to nibbana.‘And what is this middle way of practice that the Tathāgata has thoroughly understood brings insight and knowledge, conduces to peace, to direct knowledge, to awakening, to nibbana? Just this eightfold path, namely, right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration. This is the middle way of practice that the Tathāgatahas thoroughly understood brings insight and knowledge, conduces to peace, to direct knowledge, to awakening, to nibbana.‘Monks, this is the noble truth of suffering:* birth is suffering,old-age is suffering, sickness is suffering, death is suffering, being brought together with things disliked is suffering, separation from things liked is suffering, not to get what one wants is suffering; in sum, the five aggregates of attachment are suffering.‘Monks, this is the noble truth of the cause of suffering: the craving for further existence that is associated with greed and satisfaction, that takes pleasure in this and that, namely, craving for the objects of the senses, craving for existence, craving for non-existence.‘Monks, this is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering: the complete cessation and fading away of that very craving — giving it up, letting go, being free, not tied to it.‘Monks, this is the noble truth of the practice leading to the cessa-tion of suffering: just this eightfold path, namely, right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration.‘Monks, insight into things not previously heard came to me —knowledge, understanding, wisdom, light: the noble truth that this was suffering.

Gladdened, the group of fivemonks felt joy at the Blessed One’s words. And while this explana-tion was being given, there arose in the venerable Kondañña a vision of truth without blemish, untarnished: ‘The nature of everything whose nature it is to arise is to cease.’And when the Blessed One had turned the wheel of Truth, the Gods of the Earth proclaimed: ‘This wheel of Truth that the Blessed has turned in Benares, at Isipatana in the animal park, no ascetic, nor brahman, nor god, nor Māra, nor Brahmā, nor anyone in the world can stop!’From the Collection of Grouped Sayings423"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"From the Collection of Grouped Sayings246And when the Gods of the Four Kings heard their proclamation, they proclaimed: ‘This wheel of Truth that the Blessed One has turned in Benares, at Isipatana in the animal park, no ascetic, nor brahman, nor god, nor Māra, nor Brahmā, nor anyone in the world can stop!’And when the Gods of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three . . . the Yāma Gods . . . the Contented Gods . . . the Gods who Delight in Creation . . . the Gods who Master the Creations of Others heard their proclamation, they proclaimed: ‘This wheel of Truth that the Blessed One has turned in Benares, at Isipatana in the animal park, no ascetic, nor brahman, nor god, nor Māra, nor Brahmā, nor anyone in the world can stop!’Thus, at that moment, that instant, that second the proclamation reached the world of Brahmā, and this ten-thousandfold world system shook, trembled, and quaked.

Like the Samyutta-nikāya, it contains miscellaneous and generally shorter suttas, but in this case not arranged according to topic but simply according to the number of items discussed in a sutta, so suttas concerned with a single item are grouped first, then suttas concerned with two items, three items, and so on up to eleven items. The main focus is in principle, then, numbered lists. Such lists are char-acteristic of early Buddhist literature and indeed early Indian literature more generally. Such numbered lists are in part mnemonic devices, and reflect the oral origins of Buddhist literature.Numbered lists are also a feature of the Samyutta-nikāya, where we findsuttas on the five aggregates, six sense spheres, and so on. But for the most part the A.nguttara-nikāya focuses on the less prominent numbered list, so that while, for example, the five aggregates are mentioned incidentally in the A.nguttara-nikāya, we do not find a whole series of suttas on the fiveaggregates in ‘the section of fives’. Sometimes, however, it is not obvious why a particular sutta has been placed in a particular numbered section (as in the case of ‘the Kālāma-sutta’, taken here as the representative of ‘the section of threes’).Except in the case of ‘the section of ones’, I have taken just one sutta to represent each numbered section. As with the Samyutta-nikāya, the selec-tion is inevitably somewhat arbitrary, though I have aimed at variety of subject-matter across the eleven sections. Thus we begin with five very short suttas that highlight the significance of a single quality, and then move on to the debt owed to our mothers and fathers (twos), the so-called Kālāma-sutta (threes), the fear of death (fours), a simile for the way the Buddha helps his pupils (fives), the relations of those who take differentapproaches to meditation (sixes), a series of similes for the fleetingness of our lives (sevens), the qualities that make the world go around (eights), things that it is impossible for an arahat to do (nines), the powers of the Tathāgata (tens), and the benefits of the meditation on friendliness (mettā)(elevens).As in the Samyutta-nikāya, names of the suttas in the A.nguttara-nikāyaare not as fixed by the tradition as in the Dīgha-and Majjhima-nikāyas,and I introduce them by the usually single terms that are used as some-thing of a mnemonic tag but are not always consistent in the manuscripts and editions."},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"FROM THE SECTION OF ONESA Finger-Snap (A I 11)This is what I have heard . . .‘Monks, if a monk pays attention to the mental state of friendliness for just a finger-snap, then he is to be called a monk: he lives as someone whose meditation is not in vain; he carries out the teacher’s instruction, he responds to his advice, and his consumption of the country’s alms is not useless.

One might establish one’s mother and father as rulers of supreme authority over this whole earth with its abundance of seven treasures, but still one would not have done enough, one would not have repaid them. Why is this? Mothers and fathers do much for their children, bringing them up, feeding them, guiding them through this world.‘And yet one who brings about the fullness of faith in parents who have little faith, who directs them towards and establishes them in the fullness of faith; one who brings about the fullness of virtue in parents who have little virtue, who directs them towards and estab-lishes them in the fullness of virtue; one who brings about the full-ness of generosity in parents who are stingy, who directs them towards and establishes them in the fullness of generosity; one who brings about the fullness of wisdom in parents who have little wisdom, who directs them towards and establishes them in the fullness of wisdom — by doing these things he has done enough, he has repaid them, he has done more than enough.’FROM THE SECTION OF THREESKesaputta (A I 188–193)This is what I have heard.

When a son of good family lays aside his scythe and carrying-pole* and goes forth from home into homelessness, it can be said that he has gone forth out of faith. Why is this? Because pleas-ures of the senses of various kinds are to be enjoyed in one’s youth. And all pleasures of the senses, whether they are basic, normal, or extreme, can be reckoned simply pleasures of the senses.‘As if there were a charming little baby boy lying on his back, and because of the nurse’s inattentiveness he had put a stick or piece of pottery in his mouth. The nurse would immediately notice this, and as soon as she had noticed it she would remove it. But if she were unable to remove it immediately, then she would hold his head with her left hand and, hooking a finger of her right hand, remove it, even drawing blood. Why is this? It causes the boy pain, that I don’t deny. Yet the nurse has to act in this way if she desires the boy’s good, cares for his welfare, is kind, and motivated by kindness. But when that boy is old enough to understand himself, then the nurse need not worry; her attitude to the boy is that he will look after himself and will not be careless.‘In exactly the same way, monks, as long as a monk has not achieved what he must concerning wholesome qualities through faith, through self respect, through conscience, through energy, through wisdom, I must watch over that monk.

Just as a river that has arisen far away in the mountains and is flowing swiftly along, taking everything with it, never for a moment, a second, an instant stops, but just moves, swirls, and flows on; even so, like a river from the mountains, the life of human beings is brief and fleeting, full of pain and despair. You should heed advice . . . Just as a strong man might form a ball of spit at the tip of his tongue and simply spit it out; even so, like a ball of spit, the life of human beings is brief and fleeting, full of pain and despair.

At that time, monks, human beings only suffered six afflictions: cold and heat, hunger and thirst, excreting and urinating. And yet this teacher Araka, even while human beings were so long-lived, lasted so long, had so few afflictions, taught his disciples this teaching: “Short is the life of human beings . . . there is no escape from death for one who is born.” To speak appropriately about this nowadays, one would have to say: “Short is the life of human beings . . . there is no escape from death for one who is born.”‘Nowadays, to live a long time is to live a hundred years, more or less. To live a hundred years, monks, is to live for just 300 seasons: a hundred cool seasons, a hundred hot seasons, a hundred rainy seasons. To live for 300 seasons is to live for just 1,200 months: 400 months of cool season, 400 months of hot season, 400 months of rainy season.

The reasons for missing meals are these: when one is upset one does not eat, when one is in pain, sick, keeping the observance-day fast one does not eat, and also when one cannot get food. In this way, monks, I have reckoned the life of a man who lives for a hundred years — I have reckoned his lifespan, the seasons, the years, the months, the half-months, the days and nights, the meals, and the meals missed.‘Whatever a teacher, desiring his disciples’ welfare, should do for them out of kindness, through kindness, this I have done for you.

Monks, an uninformed ordinary person will experience both gain and loss, renown and disgrace, criticism and praise, happiness and unhappiness.

Buddhist tradition recognizes two ways of punctuating the phrase. The Pali tradition prefers the punctuation that appears in my translation; the Buddhist scriptural traditions that have come down to us from North India, and China and Tibet, prefer the alternative punctu-ation (This is what I heard on one occasion. The Blessed One was staying . . .), although both traditions appear to know both ways of punctuating the phrase. There is no modern scholarly consensus on which should be regarded as the ‘original’ or ‘correct’ punctuation — nor on what differ-ence it makes. See J.

According to tradition, he was the son of a courtesan. Abandoned at birth, he was found and brought up in the royal household. Having studied medicine in Takkasilā (Taxila) in North-West India, he returned to Rājagaha where he became the royal physician. He also treated the Buddha, of whom he became a great supporter, donating the mango grove mentioned in the present sutta as the place where the Buddha was staying.7 twelve hundred and fifty monks: the number of the Buddha’s full assembly (sannipāta) of awakened monks or arahats (D II 6). observance day known as White Lotus: the full moon at the end of Kattikā(October – November), the fourth month of the rainy season (vassa) and the time when the white lotus is said to flower; ‘observance days’ (uposa-tha) are the days of the new and full moon when monks traditionally recite and confess breaches of the monastic rule (pātimokkha) and the laity undertake additional religious observances and precepts. son of the Princess of Videha: elsewhere (e.g. Ja II 403) we are told that Ajātasattu’s mother was a princess of Kosala; Buddhaghosa, by resort to a play on vedehi, explains that the epithet means ‘wise woman’ (Sv 139);cf.DPPN, s.v.

The epithet is given in the text every time the king’s name is mentioned, though I have omitted it except at the beginning and close of the sutta. one who has found a way across:titthakara (Skt: tīrthakara), literally one who makes a ford across a stream or river.

The term, like a number of other terms, including buddhaandjina (‘conqueror’), is common to Indian religion as a whole, although in the course of India’s long religious history particular terms have come to have a special association with particular traditions, and so Buddhism talks more of buddhas, and Jainism (the tradition of the Jina) more of jinasandtīrthakaras.7 possesses the pearls of wisdom: the term rataññū is traditionally taken as deriving from rātri (‘night’) and √jñā (‘know’) and as meaning ‘knowing [many] nights’, i.e. of some experience (Sv 143); K. R. Norman, however, has suggested a more convincing derivation from Sanskrit ratna (‘jewel’); seeJournal of the Pali Text Society,9 (1981),40–1. 8 an arahat and perfect buddha: both arahat and buddha are honorific titles with particular implications in Indian religious literature; the former means literally ‘worthy one’ and the latter ‘one who has woken up [to the knowledge of the way things are]’. Both are used in Buddhist texts only of the fully realized Buddhist saint. But such terms are not exclusively Buddhist but common to various Indian religious traditions. This formula lists nine qualities of the Buddha; these form the basis of the traditional meditation practice of ‘recollection of the Buddha’ (buddhānussati); see Vism VII 1–67. 9 my son the prince Udāyibhadda: in fact tradition has it that Ajātasattu was eventually also murdered by his son, and he in turn by his son (Mhv IV 1–2); see also DPPN, s.v.

MW, CPD,DOP) seems originally to have referred to a gesture of holding out the cupped hands to make an offering; it can also refer to the gesture of holding the joined palms before the chest or forehead. 11 non-existence of action: later Indian sources associate Pūrana Kassapa’s name with Ājīvikism, and it seems clear that he was an early Ājīvikateacher, his antinomian ethics being consonant with Ājīvika determinism. Later Buddhist sources give what must be a largely legendary account of his life that ends in his suicide; see A. L. Basham, History and Doctrines of the Ājīvikas (London, 1951),80–90. From the Buddhist point of view, Pūrana’s denial that how we behave matters constitutes a basic ‘wrong view’ (micchā-dit.t.hi), since it denies the fundamental principle of the law of karma (Pali: kamma), namely, that good and bad actions have their due results (e.g. M III 72). But how is a person like me . . . reproached?: as a good Indian king, Ajātasattu should provide for all ascetics and brahmans living in his realm. 12 six types of existence: these abhijāti are discussed by Basham, History and Doctrine of the Ājīvikas,243–6, and seem to involve a classificationaccording to a scheme of colours relating to psychological dispositions.

The lists contained in the middle and long sections include many obscure single terms which can only be translated with the help of the explanations found in the commentary; it does not seem that the com-mentator himself always understood what the terms signified.

Developed Buddhist thought did not accept that plants were sentient, but nevertheless, injuring plants was perhaps a sensitive issue among wandering ascetics. See L.

Great One:mahat, which in later Indian literature refers to the primordial intelligence that, according to the Sāmkhya system of thought, existed at the start of the universe; but there is no evidence for this concept at this early date. Buddhaghosa suggests Mahā-Brahmā, a god who might be thought of as a kind of personalized form of Mahat.

Sirī:(Skt: Śrī), the goddess of good fortune, the consort of the god Visnu. 25 administering emetics . . . medicines: the point here, as with the other ‘child-ish arts’, is not so much that these practices are proscribed for the Buddhist monk per se, but that if a monk renders these services to those who give alms, then he is earning his living as a doctor and not a monk. In practice, Buddhist monks have been involved in the practice of medi-cine; see Kenneth G.

Most translators have taken the ‘being thus/here’ as referring to ‘this (kind of ) existence’ and have then rendered the expression along the lines of ‘there is no more of this (kind of ) existence’; the justification for weakening the sense of the dative in this way is not clear. Context in fact suggests that ‘being thus/here’ refers rather to the state of having achieved the aim of the spiritual life (brahmacariya); the monk understands that there is nothing further required of him in order to reach his goal. The commentaries (Sp 169;Sv226; Ps I 128,180–1; Spk I 205; Mp II 264) offer two alternative interpretations which correspond in intent to those just outlined: (1) the monk understands that he has nothing further to do in order to know the four truths and destroy the defilements; (2) he understands that nothing more comes after the present ‘arrangement’ (pakāra) and that after the current stream of aggregates there will be no further stream.

See notes to the Mahā-Parinibbāna-sutta. 39 Vajjis: the most significant of the republican tribal confederacies at the time of the Buddha; subsequently Ajātasattu was to wage war on them and annex their lands. the Blessed One spoke to him: asked about an issue related to a potential war, it is perhaps significant that the Buddha does not address Vassakāradirectly, but rather through Ānanda; cf.

Sāriputta: along with Moggallāna (see pp. 239–41), Sāriputta, ‘the disci-ple chief in wisdom’, was considered one of the two great disciples of the Buddha; this was apparently his last meeting with the Buddha; according to tradition he died before the Buddha and was not present at his death or thefirst communal recitation. 46 by abandoning the five hindrances .. . constituents of awakening: another important summary statement of the Buddhist path; the Satipat.t.hāna-sutta(see below) might be read as an expansion of this summary. 49 the seed sacks are split open: a play on the name Pāt.aliputta: ‘pāt.ali seed sacks ( put.a)’; in the century after the Buddha’s death Pāt.aliputta became the capital of the Mauryan empire.50 washed his hands and bowl: for this understanding of onīta-patta-pān.i see K.

For a discussion of the problems and of the development of the practice of ‘giving merit’, see Rita Langer, Buddhist Rituals of Death and Rebirth(London,2007),166–85. appreciation: the corollary of sharing one’s own merit (see previous note) is participating in the merit of others by rejoicing and appreciation (anu-modana); in the practice of contemporary Theravāda Buddhism, this is formally done by monks after receiving alms, and is to be cultivated more generally as an attitude when witnessing meritorious actions. Gotama Gate: presumably why no crossing is called ‘Gotama Crossing’ is because, as becomes apparent, he does not use a crossing. 52 what is their fate?: In what follows the Buddha explains the fate of these various disciples with reference to the ten ‘fetters’ (sam.yojana) that bind beings to the round of rebirth (the view of individuality, doubt, clinging to precepts and vows, sensual desire, aversion, desire for form, desire for the formless, pride, agitation, and ignorance). By the practice of the Buddhist path these fetters are progressively weakened and then broken. By the abandoning of the first three fetters one becomes a ‘stream-enterer’ (sotāpanna), that is, one whose final awakening is assured within seven rebirths. By the abandoning of the first three and the permanent weakening of the next two, one becomes a ‘once-returner’ (sakadāgāmin), that is, one whose final awakening is assured and who will be reborn as a human being no more than once. By the complete abandon-ing of the five lower fetters one becomes a ‘non-returner’ (anāgāmin), that is, one who at death will not be reborn as a human being but in one of five‘pure abodes’ where that being will gain final awakening and become an arahat by abandoning all ten fetters. It is noteworthy that here a number of lay disciples are mentioned as stream enterers, etc., but not as arahats. reborn purely: they are not born from an egg, womb, or ‘moisture’; they simply come into being fully grown.53 the Truth that is clear . . . by the Blessed One: this formula provides the basis for ‘recollection of the Dhamma’ (dhammānussati); see Vism VII 68–88. eight persons in four pairs: the persons who have attained the paths and fruits of stream entry, once return, non-return, and arahatship; see note to p. 52.

Waldschmidt, Das Māhaparinirvān.asv-tra: Text in Sanskrit und Tibetisch (Berlin, 1951),200) suggests an early tradition in favour of ‘island’ (dvīpa). Note that ‘island’ here should not be taken as having the connotation of cutting oneself off, but rather of a place of safety when crossing the ocean of exist-ence; cf. MW, s.v. dvīpa. darkness: Rhys Davids and Walshe both translate this following the firstof the commentary’s interpretations, taking tama as an indicator of the superlative: ‘at the topmost’. But the commentary (Sv 548, Spk III 205)also recognizes that tama(s) here might be taken as ‘darkness’; agge might then be taken in the sense of ‘in front of ’ (MW, s.v. agra). 59 an aeon or what remains of it: later Buddhist thought distinguishes various types of aeons (kappa/kalpa), all of which are fantastically long. Most commonly an aeon is the immeasurable time it takes for the universe to pass through one full cycle of expansion and contraction (see R. Gethin, TheFoundations of Buddhism (Oxford,1998),112–32). Some ancient Buddhist commentators accepted the implications of the current passage; others, including Buddhaghosa, suggested, not entirely convin-cingly, that ‘aeon’ here stands for the maximum human life-span (100 years). See P. S. Jaini, ‘Buddha’s Prolongation of Life’, Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies,21 (1958),546–52; R.

In effect, two ‘attain-ments of nibbana’ are distinguished: the initial attainment at the moment of awakening, when the defilements are extinguished (kilesa-nibbāna), and thefinal awakening at death, when the aggregates of physical and mental experience are extinguished (khandha-nibbāna); see Gethin, Foundationsof Buddhism,74–9.

The stupa has a developed symbolism: it is at once a representation of the cosmos and of the stages of the Buddhist path. See A. L.Dallapiccola,The Stūpa: Its Religious, Historical and Archaeological Signifi cance (Wiesbaden, 1980). paste: translates van.n.aka or, following a variant reading, cun.n.aka, both of which seem to refer to some form of coloured or perfumed paste used for anointing.82 one-off buddha: a pacceka-buddha or someone who (in contrast to an arahat) has achieved awakening without hearing the teaching of a buddha and (in contrast to a perfect buddha) does not establish a buddha’s tradi-tion of instruction (sāsana) by teaching; in effect, a pacceka-buddha is a non-Buddhist who achieves awakening. 86 the ascetic . . . fourth ascetics: the commentary suggests that the ascetic and the second, third, and fourth ascetics are the stream-enterer, once-returner, non-returner, and arahat respectively; however, this is the only place in the Explanatory Notes280"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"four Nikāyas where they are referred to in this manner.

The candidate for upasampadā or ‘higher ordination’ must be at least 20; the ceremony confers the full status of a bhikkhu who must live by the 227 precepts of the monastic rule (pāt.imokkha). 88 Channa: tradition identifies him with the Channa who was the young Gotama’s charioteer and who drove him out to encounter the four ‘signs’ — an old man, a sick and dying man, a corpse, and an ascetic — that prompted him to leave behind his comfortable life. Elsewhere in the Pali canon we are told how, when Ānanda communi-cated the punishment to him after the Buddha’s death, Channa was immediately motivated to achieve awakening and so became an arahat (Vin II 292). 90 Brahmā, Lord of the Earth: who first requested the Buddha to teach; see Bodhirājakumāra-sutta below; as Brahmā, he resides with his retinue in the Brahma realms, beyond the more ordinary heavens, such as that of the ‘Thirty-Three Gods’ ruled over by Sakka, who is mentioned a few lines later. 91 gods . . .

The reading na d.ayhim.suis supported by other accounts of the Buddha’s funeral, including the SanskritMahāparinirvān.a-sūtra edited by Waldschmidt (Berlin, 1951).John Strong, Relics of the Buddha (Princeton, 2004),104–5, suggests that the unburnt layers have to do with keeping the relics separate from the ashes of the fire; Strong does not mention the Pali variant. Rhys Davids and Walshe translate the sentence as indicating that all the layers were burnt up, which is hardly possible as a translation. honouring: the PTS edition has parikarim.su, but other editions have garum.karim.su, which is usual in this standard sequence.Explanatory Notes281"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"Explanatory Notes282 97 There were eight portions . . . hard to find: the commentary says that these final verses were added later by the elders in Ceylon (Sv 615). 100 four times that of a man: so the PTS edition (but mistranslated by Rhys Davids and Walshe); other editions have ‘three times the height of a man in circumference, set into the ground to a depth three times the height of a man, and in height twelve times that of a man’. 101 danced round: Walshe has (p. 280) ‘had their desires assuaged by the sound’, and dismisses (p. 576) Rhys Davids’s ‘danced’, but this is certainly how the commentary understood paricāresum.: ‘with movements of their hands or feet they enjoyed themselves dancing’ (Sv 617).

Thundercloud: again borrowing from Rhys Davids. 104 those palms: the palm trees outside the gates of the city, mentioned earlier. 105 blue lotuses, red lotuses, and white lotuses: four kinds are mentioned; the colours of each are not strictly fixed (both kumuda and pun.d.arīka are usually considered white) and it is not possible to convey the distinction in translation. everyone can have garlands: literally, ‘a garland is not-closed (i.e. available) to everyone’, reading anāvat.am. with the Burmese edition as suggested by CPD (s.v. anāvat.a).106 Vissakamma: the ‘all-maker’, the divine architect who resides in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three along with Sakka (Indra). covered with boards:phalaka (also mentioned in the Sanskrit versions); while MW gives ‘a wooden bench’ (which explains Rhys Davids’s ‘seats’), a ‘flat board or surface’ seems to be the general meaning. 108 giving, control, and restraint: the commentary (Sv 630) says that ‘control’ (dama) should here be understood as observing the new and full-moon days (uposatha-kamma); ‘restraint’ (sam.yama) is proper conduct (sīla). So far in the sutta we have thus had the first stages of the Buddhist path: generosity (dāna) and proper conduct (sīla); what follows is in effect the cultivation (bhāvanā) of calm and insight.

These are among the most important subjects of meditation. While they can be used as a basis for awakening itself, their practice is traditionally regarded as leading directly to rebirth in the sublime Brahma World, a world free of all ill-feeling.

While this may be correct in certain contexts, the primary meaning of sammada (q.v. MW) in Sanskrit is ‘delight’, ‘exhilaration’, and in the present context the emphasis would appear to be on the happiness of King Mahāsudassana’s state of mind at death, rather than on his drowsiness. 115 seventh laying aside of the body: that is, his death as the Buddha. Both Rhys Davids and Walshe translate as if the seventh time referred to the death of Mahāsudassana, but this cannot be correct since, as there will be no eighth laying aside of the body, it would imply that the Buddha will not die. 117 Vāset.t.ha: a singular vocative is used here and throughout the discourse (although some manuscripts witness a variant in the plural), but the pronouns ‘you’ and the second-person verbs are in the plural: Vāset.t.hahas taken the initiative in approaching the Buddha and so the Buddha addresses him directly, but Bhāradvāja is standing close by listening, so he says ‘you’ in the plural.118 ancestor’s feet: that is, Brahmā’s feet. insulting Brahmā: they are insulting Brahmā for, as the commentary points out (Sv 862), if what they say is true, then Brahmā’s mouth must be a brahman woman’s vaginal passage. 119 good practice, not bad practice:dhamma and adhamma.120 of different birth: or, as Collins has it, ‘from various castes’; the term here isjāti, which is literally ‘birth’, but comes to be used also in the sense of ‘caste’. one whose body is Truth . . . designations of the Tathāgata: Sv 865: ‘Why is the Tathāgata “the one whose body is dhamma”?

So when people call brahmans jhāyakas they take this as indicating how brahmans keep sacrificialfires. However, the Buddha says, this is a misunderstanding of the original import of the epi-thet, which was in fact a reference to the brahmans’ original taste for meditation.

The precise significance of ekāyana (literally ‘one-way’) is uncertain; in describing actual paths it is clearly used in the sense of narrow (a way for only one person), and in the sense of a single path (without forks) going to only one place. What is meant in the present context seems to be that the ways of establishing mindfulness represent a path that is unified,clear, well defined, and single — not confusing and difficult to follow as a result of forks and side-roads. On the expression see Gethin, BuddhistPath to Awakening,59–68.143 a monk: the commentary points out that ‘monk’ is stated here as the ideal practitioner, but other ‘gods and people’ also succeed (sampādenti) in the practice, and that ‘monk’ indicates anyone who so succeeds (Ps I 241; Sv 755). qualities:dhamma.

The park and buildings that he erected there and donated to the community of monks became one of the Buddha’s favourite residences. 157 former vulture killer: the expression gaddha-bādhi-pubba is obscure. The Buddhist tradition interprets it as ‘the former vulture killer’, meaning that he had been born into a family of vulture killers (Ps II 102), but what ‘vulture killers’ were is not clear; it might just be possible to interpret it as meaning ‘he who had previously been one to check his desires’ or possibly ‘one whose obstacle was formerly desire’; these at least fit the logic of the discourse. practices:dhamma. like a skeleton . . . the danger in them: most of these similes are found elaborated in the Potaliyā-sutta (M I 359–68), not included here. 158 who are you . . . : taking kassa as ko ssa; cf.

The sutta opens with Arit.t.ha using dhamma in the sense of practices (that may or may not be obstacles). In the simile of the snakedhamma clearly refers to the teachings in the sense of oral texts. In the simile of the raft we seem to return to the sense of ‘practices’; here what seems to be at issue is attachment to ‘bad practices’ (adhamma) and even ‘good practices’ (dhamma); the commentary suggests (Ps II 109) that what is meant is that one must give up attachment (chandarāga) to calm and insight.

My translation of this passage owes something to both Norman and to Ñānamoli and Bodhi’s Middle Length Discourses,233. which previously has been fully understood: it has previously been fully understood as not self. What this seems to be saying is that the Buddha’s awakening consisted of a full understanding of how ‘this’, the things the unawakened consider ‘self ’, are not self, so he does not think of these acts as being done to him or his self. The sentence seems to be very deliberately couched in impersonal terms, and we should take tattha me as a sandhiorelision for tattha (i)me, and reject Trenckner’s emendation at M I 140(line32) where the sentence is repeated and he conjectures (see M I 542)tattha no but the Burmese edition retains tattha me. This emendation seems to have led some translators to misinterpret the passage and take meas the enclitic form of the first-person pronoun, and so take the sense as ‘such acts are done to/by me’ rather than ‘these kinds of acts are done’. Such an interpretation is not supported by the commentary, which explicitly takes tattha me as tattha ime, and explains that when people honour the Buddha for teaching the four truths, he neither thinks that people do these things to him, nor that it is he who experiences them, but rather that it is the collection of aggregates (which he fully understood at the time of his awakening) that is experiencing them (Ps II 118–19).167 destined for heaven: we have here a descending sequence of six types of people defined with reference to the point they reach along the Buddhist path; the firstfive are described as ‘monks’, while the last are simply those who have a degree of faith (saddhā) and affection (pema),which is presum-ably intended to include laypeople; the point is, of course, not that they are precluded from attaining nibbana, but that if they do no more than achieve faith and affection in the Buddha, they are destined for heaven. 171 the wild or cultivated: following the commentarial explanations (Ps III 142). sithilahanu: according to the commentary, ‘the bird of this name’ (Ps III 142). whether the man by whom I was struck . . . or an ‘oleander leaf ’: curiously, the man wounded by the arrow has eleven questions rather than ten. 174 Gotama sir: in his instructions to the brahman Sañjikāputta, Prince Bodhi refers to the Buddha as ‘the Blessed One’ (bhagavat), but when he talks to the Buddha, Sañjikāputta addresses him in characteristic brahman fash-ion as ‘Gotama sir’ (bho Gotama), indicating that he does not acknowledge the Buddha as his superior. 175 Gather up your cloths . . . later generations: this incident — also found (with slight variation in wording) at Vin II 127–9— is at best obscure. The commentarial tradition relates it to Prince Bodhi’s wish for a son: if the Buddha stepped on the cloths his wish would be fulfilled; knowing that"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"Explanatory Notes288Bodhi was destined to remain without a son, the Buddha thus refused to step on the cloths. The Buddha also saw, the commentary tells us, that while at that time monks could read others’ minds and see what would and would not happen, in the future they would not be able to do so and thus in similar situations would not know whether or not to step on a cloth and might get it wrong; this would lead to disillusion among those whose wishes based on honouring monks were not fulfilled; understand-ing this, Ānanda comments that the Buddha has regard for the gener-ations to come (Ps III 322–3; Dhp-a III 134–9).176 intent on awakening: the term used is bodhisatta, later Sanskritized asbodhisattva, an ‘awakening being’, and understood as someone on the path to becoming a ‘perfectly and fully awakened one’ (sammāsambuddha/samyaksambuddha) as opposed to an arahat or ‘awakened disciple’ (sāvaka/śrāvaka-buddha). In the present context the second element of bodhisattais perhaps better interpreted following the Pali commentaries (e.g. Ps I 113) in terms of either Skt sakta (past participle from√sañj) in the sense of ‘intent on’ or Skt śakta in the sense of ‘capable of ’; cf. K. R. Norman, A Philological Approach to Buddhism,2nd edn.

The commentaries give both interpretations: ‘inside the deathless’ (amatogadhan ti amatabbhantaram. at Spk III 247) and ‘established in the deathless’ (amatogadhā ti nibbānogadhā nibbānapatit.t.hā ti attho at Mp III351).CPD (s.v. amatogadha) acknowledges the former but implies (s.v.ogadha) that the latter is the original meaning; Bodhi, ConnectedDiscourses,1093–4, n. 243, argues for the latter, while DOP (s.vv. ogadha1andogadha2) accepts the former. In fact, the ambiguity seems ancient and it is probably not possible to be definitive about the meaning of this expression in the Nikāyas. 232 monkey lime: the commentary says that they prepare a sticky paste by combining the sap of the banyan tree with other ingredients. In Europe the similar use of bird-lime was once widespread.233 to that same piece of wood: the Pali text reads kat.t.hakatan.gāre, which appears corrupt; following others, I have taken this as equivalent to kat.t.hakal.in.gara, found regularly in the Pali commentaries in the sense of ‘block of wood’.

It was given to the group offive monks who were originally fellow companions in his quest for awakening but abandoned him when he gave up the practice of severe austerities (see the Bodhirājakumāra-sutta, translated above). In it the Buddha sets out the famous noble eightfold path and four noble truths. 244 this is the noble truth of suffering: the grammar and syntax of the various statements of the four noble truths in Buddhist sources has become confused at points as a result of the insertion of the expression ‘noble truth’ (ariya-sacca). This means that a strictly grammatical translation is not possible. Existing translations tend to offer statements such as ‘the noble truth of the cause of suffering must be abandoned’, when clearly what is meant is that the cause of suffering must be abandoned, rather than the truth of the cause of suffering.

The twelve aspects are merely the sum of the three stages applied to each truth. 251 Kālāma town called Kesaputta: this sutta is often referred to as the Kālāma-sutta in modern literature. 253 How is it for you: there is some confusion over the correct reading here: katham. vā ettha hotī ti (‘or how is it in this case’) or katham. vo ettha hotī ti(‘how is it for you in this case’); since the response is consistently evam. no ettha hotī ti (‘it is like this for us in this case’), I have opted for the latter, although the former is the more frequent reading. 256 doubly purified: this passage has been variously understood by previous translators. Woodward (Gradual Sayings, I 175) suggests that a person is doubly purified because he does no evil act ‘whether inadvertently or intentionally’, Nyanaponika and Bodhi (Numerical Discourses,67) because no evil is done by him or befalls him. I take karoto in the phrase sace kho pana karoto na karīyati pāpam. as an agent genitive: ‘if evil is done by one acting’. Thus the third reason to breathe easily rests on the assumption that evil acts are real and matter: then if one intends and does no evil act one can breathe easily. The fourth reason rests on the assumption that evil acts are not real and do not matter: then one is doubly purified — because one does no evil act and because acts do not matter anyway. The commentary explains: ‘in that I do no evil and also in that nothing is done when one acts’ (Mp II 306:yañ ca pāpam. na karomi, yañ ca karoto pi na karīyati), although Nyanaponika and Bodhi (p. 287, n. 51) take the commentary in line with their understanding of the sutta. 257 refuge from danger: according to the interpretation given in the Pali commentaries, what is meant is that he has not done any deed that will protect him from the danger and fear that arise at the time of death (Sp436). 258 does not think: the not is missing in the PTS edition, but is clearly required. 259 excited: taking palāl.ita as equivalent to *pralod.ita (rather than *pralalita)in the sense of ‘strongly agitated’ rather than ‘led astray’; cf. PED s.v. palal.ita;BHSD s.vv. pralud.ita,pralulita. The word occurs also at S IV 197, juxtaposed with pamatta, ‘excited’, etc. scythe and carrying-pole: for cutting and carrying grass respectively (Mp III224). 260 specialists in the teachings: the expression dhamma-yoga is found only here in the Pali canon, although BHSD records the occurrence of dharma-yoga(q.v.) in the Sanskrit Lalitavistara. In the present context the commentary explains it as dhamma-kathika, ‘a speaker on or expounder of the dhamma’.What the expression seems to signify is someone who is familiar with the"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"Explanatory Notes292dhamma in the specific sense of ‘teachings’ or ‘texts’ as found, for example, at M I 133, which talks of someone who learns the dhamma and then lists various categories of text (see above, p. 000). This sutta thus anticipates a certain tension that later arose in Buddhist monasticism in some countries between two vocations: the work of directly realizing insight into the four truths (vipassanā-dhura), and the work of studying books (gantha-dhura);see Walpola Rahula, History of Buddhism in Ceylon: The AnurādhapuraPeriod,2nd edn. (Colombo, 1966),158–61.260 of the many: this form of this stock expression, repeating ‘of the many’, is peculiar to the An.guttara-nikāya and Itivuttaka of the Khuddaka-nikāya;the more common form found elsewhere (and in the An.guttara-nikāyaandItivuttaka) has instead ‘out of sympathy for the world’ (lokānukampāya). 261 brahmans: the vocative is singular, but a plural seems required in English. 265 Blessed One: although a wanderer rather than a Buddhist monk, he refers to the Buddha as ‘the Blessed One’ (bhagavat). incapable of . . . when he lived in a house: according to a later tradition, if a layman attains the full awakening of an arahat, he will die or become a monk the same day (Mil 264). 267 sublime wheel: here brahma-cakka rather than dhamma-cakka (the wheel of Truth), but nevertheless equated with the latter by the commentary. emerge from them: the commentary points out that, since emerging from an attainment may involve moving to a higher attainment, it is closely associated with purifying a meditative attainment (Mp V 15)."},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"INDEXAbhidhamma xix, xx, xxv, xxvi, 156,195,279abhiññā5,6;see direct knowledgeabsorption (jh ̄āna) xxxii, xl, 208,267,288 – 9; four 6,28 – 9,89 – 90,109,152,184,242 – 3,274 – 5; the Buddha’s recollection of the first173,183;without breathing 181 – 2;see also meditationAciravatī208,227,231,234,236,237,238,242,243action (kamma) xxvii, xxxiii, 12,34,103,108,127 – 8,13,138,185,195,198 – 204,212,226,267,268,272,275,277,284; analysis of 197,202;course of (kammapatha)266;defilements of 129 – 31; denial of 11;right/wrong (sammā/micchā-kammanta)226,227,244;see alsokamma, karma Adikaram, E.
